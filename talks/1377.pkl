VWhen I was nine years old,
p5
aVI went off to summer camp for the first time.
p6
aVAnd my mother packed me a suitcase full of books,
p7
aVwhich to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do.
p8
aVBecause in my family, reading was the primary group activity.
p9
aVAnd this might sound antisocial to you,
p10
aVbut for us it was really just a different way of being social.
p11
aVYou have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you,
p12
aVbut you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland
p13
aVinside your own mind.
p14
aVAnd I had this idea
p15
aVthat camp was going to be just like this, but better.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VI had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin
p20
aVcozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VCamp was more like a keg party without any alcohol.
p25
aVAnd on the very first day,
p26
aVour counselor gathered us all together
p27
aVand she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing
p28
aVevery day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit.
p29
aVAnd it went like this:
p30
aV"R-O-W-D-I-E,
p31
aVthat's the way we spell rowdie.
p32
aVRowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VYeah.
p37
aVSo I couldn't figure out for the life of me
p38
aVwhy we were supposed to be so rowdy,
p39
aVor why we had to spell this word incorrectly.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VBut I recited a cheer. I recited a cheer along with everybody else.
p44
aVI did my best.
p45
aVAnd I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase,
p48
aVthe coolest girl in the bunk came up to me
p49
aVand she asked me, "Why are you being so mellow?" \u2014
p50
aVmellow, of course, being the exact opposite
p51
aVof R-O-W-D-I-E.
p52
aVAnd then the second time I tried it,
p53
aVthe counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face
p54
aVand she repeated the point about camp spirit
p55
aVand said we should all work very hard to be outgoing.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd so I put my books away,
p58
aVback in their suitcase,
p59
aVand I put them under my bed,
p60
aVand there they stayed for the rest of the summer.
p61
aVAnd I felt kind of guilty about this.
p62
aVI felt as if the books needed me somehow,
p63
aVand they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them.
p64
aVBut I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again
p65
aVuntil I was back home with my family at the end of the summer.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, I tell you this story about summer camp.
p68
aVI could have told you 50 others just like it \u2014
p69
aVall the times that I got the message
p70
aVthat somehow my quiet and introverted style of being
p71
aVwas not necessarily the right way to go,
p72
aVthat I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert.
p73
aVAnd I always sensed deep down that this was wrong
p74
aVand that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were.
p75
aVBut for years I denied this intuition,
p76
aVand so I became a Wall Street lawyer, of all things,
p77
aVinstead of the writer that I had always longed to be \u2014
p78
aVpartly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too.
p79
aVAnd I was always going off to crowded bars
p80
aVwhen I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.
p81
aVAnd I made these self-negating choices so reflexively,
p82
aVthat I wasn't even aware that I was making them.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow this is what many introverts do,
p85
aVand it's our loss for sure,
p86
aVbut it is also our colleagues' loss
p87
aVand our communities' loss.
p88
aVAnd at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss.
p89
aVBecause when it comes to creativity and to leadership,
p90
aVwe need introverts doing what they do best.
p91
aVA third to a half of the population are introverts \u2014
p92
aVa third to a half.
p93
aVSo that's one out of every two or three people you know.
p94
aVSo even if you're an extrovert yourself,
p95
aVI'm talking about your coworkers
p96
aVand your spouses and your children
p97
aVand the person sitting next to you right now \u2014
p98
aVall of them subject to this bias
p99
aVthat is pretty deep and real in our society.
p100
aVWe all internalize it from a very early age
p101
aVwithout even having a language for what we're doing.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, to see the bias clearly,
p104
aVyou need to understand what introversion is.
p105
aVIt's different from being shy.
p106
aVShyness is about fear of social judgment.
p107
aVIntroversion is more about,
p108
aVhow do you respond to stimulation,
p109
aVincluding social stimulation.
p110
aVSo extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation,
p111
aVwhereas introverts feel at their most alive
p112
aVand their most switched-on and their most capable
p113
aVwhen they're in quieter, more low-key environments.
p114
aVNot all the time \u2014 these things aren't absolute \u2014
p115
aVbut a lot of the time.
p116
aVSo the key then to maximizing our talents
p117
aVis for us all to put ourselves
p118
aVin the zone of stimulation that is right for us.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut now here's where the bias comes in.
p121
aVOur most important institutions,
p122
aVour schools and our workplaces,
p123
aVthey are designed mostly for extroverts
p124
aVand for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation.
p125
aVAnd also we have this belief system right now
p126
aVthat I call the new groupthink,
p127
aVwhich holds that all creativity and all productivity
p128
aVcomes from a very oddly gregarious place.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo if you picture the typical classroom nowadays:
p131
aVWhen I was going to school, we sat in rows.
p132
aVWe sat in rows of desks like this,
p133
aVand we did most of our work pretty autonomously.
p134
aVBut nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks \u2014
p135
aVfour or five or six or seven kids all facing each other.
p136
aVAnd kids are working in countless group assignments.
p137
aVEven in subjects like math and creative writing,
p138
aVwhich you think would depend on solo flights of thought,
p139
aVkids are now expected to act as committee members.
p140
aVAnd for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone,
p141
aVthose kids are seen as outliers often
p142
aVor, worse, as problem cases.
p143
aVAnd the vast majority of teachers
p144
aVreports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert
p145
aVas opposed to an introvert,
p146
aVeven though introverts actually get better grades
p147
aVand are more knowledgeable,
p148
aVaccording to research.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VOkay, same thing is true in our workplaces.
p153
aVNow, most of us work in open plan offices,
p154
aVwithout walls,
p155
aVwhere we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers.
p156
aVAnd when it comes to leadership,
p157
aVintroverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions,
p158
aVeven though introverts tend to be very careful,
p159
aVmuch less likely to take outsize risks \u2014
p160
aVwhich is something we might all favor nowadays.
p161
aVAnd interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School
p162
aVhas found that introverted leaders
p163
aVoften deliver better outcomes than extroverts do,
p164
aVbecause when they are managing proactive employees,
p165
aVthey're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas,
p166
aVwhereas an extrovert can, quite unwittingly,
p167
aVget so excited about things
p168
aVthat they're putting their own stamp on things,
p169
aVand other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.
p172
aVI'll give you some examples.
p173
aVEleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi \u2014
p174
aVall these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.
p175
aVAnd they all took the spotlight,
p176
aVeven though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to.
p177
aVAnd this turns out to have a special power all its own,
p178
aVbecause people could feel that these leaders were at the helm
p179
aVnot because they enjoyed directing others
p180
aVand not out of the pleasure of being looked at;
p181
aVthey were there because they had no choice,
p182
aVbecause they were driven to do what they thought was right.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow I think at this point it's important for me to say
p185
aVthat I actually love extroverts.
p186
aVI always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts,
p187
aVincluding my beloved husband.
p188
aVAnd we all fall at different points, of course,
p189
aValong the introvert/extrovert spectrum.
p190
aVEven Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms,
p191
aVsaid that there's no such thing as a pure introvert
p192
aVor a pure extrovert.
p193
aVHe said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum,
p194
aVif he existed at all.
p195
aVAnd some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum,
p196
aVand we call these people ambiverts.
p197
aVAnd I often think that they have the best of all worlds.
p198
aVBut many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd what I'm saying is that culturally, we need a much better balance.
p201
aVWe need more of a yin and yang between these two types.
p202
aVThis is especially important
p203
aVwhen it comes to creativity and to productivity,
p204
aVbecause when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people,
p205
aVwhat they find
p206
aVare people who are very good at exchanging ideas
p207
aVand advancing ideas,
p208
aVbut who also have a serious streak of introversion in them.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd this is because solitude
p211
aVis a crucial ingredient often to creativity.
p212
aVSo Darwin,
p213
aVhe took long walks alone in the woods
p214
aVand emphatically turned down dinner-party invitations.
p215
aVTheodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,
p216
aVhe dreamed up many of his amazing creations
p217
aVin a lonely bell tower office that he had
p218
aVin the back of his house in La Jolla, California.
p219
aVAnd he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books
p220
aVfor fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure
p221
aVand would be disappointed with his more reserved persona.
p222
aVSteve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer
p223
aVsitting alone in his cubicle in Hewlett-Packard
p224
aVwhere he was working at the time.
p225
aVAnd he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place
p226
aVhad he not been too introverted to leave the house
p227
aVwhen he was growing up.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow, of course,
p230
aVthis does not mean that we should all stop collaborating \u2014
p231
aVand case in point, is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs
p232
aVto start Apple Computer \u2014
p233
aVbut it does mean that solitude matters
p234
aVand that for some people it is the air that they breathe.
p235
aVAnd in fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude.
p236
aVIt's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it.
p237
aVIf you look at most of the world's major religions,
p238
aVyou will find seekers \u2014
p239
aVMoses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad \u2014
p240
aVseekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness,
p241
aVwhere they then have profound epiphanies and revelations
p242
aVthat they then bring back to the rest of the community.
p243
aVSo, no wilderness, no revelations.
p244
aa(lp245
VThis is no surprise, though,
p246
aVif you look at the insights of contemporary psychology.
p247
aVIt turns out that we can't even be in a group of people
p248
aVwithout instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions.
p249
aVEven about seemingly personal and visceral things
p250
aVlike who you're attracted to,
p251
aVyou will start aping the beliefs of the people around you
p252
aVwithout even realizing that that's what you're doing.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd groups famously follow the opinions
p255
aVof the most dominant or charismatic person in the room,
p256
aVeven though there's zero correlation
p257
aVbetween being the best talker and having the best ideas \u2014
p258
aVI mean zero.
p259
aVSo \u2014
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VYou might be following the person with the best ideas,
p264
aVbut you might not.
p265
aVAnd do you really want to leave it up to chance?
p266
aVMuch better for everybody to go off by themselves,
p267
aVgenerate their own ideas
p268
aVfreed from the distortions of group dynamics,
p269
aVand then come together as a team
p270
aVto talk them through in a well-managed environment
p271
aVand take it from there.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow if all this is true,
p274
aVthen why are we getting it so wrong?
p275
aVWhy are we setting up our schools this way, and our workplaces?
p276
aVAnd why are we making these introverts feel so guilty
p277
aVabout wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time?
p278
aVOne answer lies deep in our cultural history.
p279
aVWestern societies,
p280
aVand in particular the U.S.,
p281
aVhave always favored the man of action over the "man" of contemplation.
p282
aVBut in America's early days,
p283
aVwe lived in what historians call a culture of character,
p284
aVwhere we still, at that point, valued people
p285
aVfor their inner selves and their moral rectitude.
p286
aVAnd if you look at the self-help books from this era,
p287
aVthey all had titles with things like
p288
aV"Character, the Grandest Thing in the World."
p289
aVAnd they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln,
p290
aVwho was praised for being modest and unassuming.
p291
aVRalph Waldo Emerson called him
p292
aV"A man who does not offend by superiority."
p293
aa(lp294
VBut then we hit the 20th century,
p295
aVand we entered a new culture
p296
aVthat historians call the culture of personality.
p297
aVWhat happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy
p298
aVto a world of big business.
p299
aVAnd so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities.
p300
aVAnd instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives,
p301
aVnow they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers.
p302
aVSo, quite understandably,
p303
aVqualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important.
p304
aVAnd sure enough, the self-help books change to meet these new needs
p305
aVand they start to have names
p306
aVlike "How to Win Friends and Influence People."
p307
aVAnd they feature as their role models really great salesmen.
p308
aVSo that's the world we're living in today.
p309
aVThat's our cultural inheritance.
p310
aa(lp311
VNow none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant,
p312
aVand I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all.
p313
aVThe same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops
p314
aValso teach us love and trust.
p315
aVAnd the problems that we are facing today
p316
aVin fields like science and in economics
p317
aVare so vast and so complex
p318
aVthat we are going to need armies of people coming together
p319
aVto solve them working together.
p320
aVBut I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves,
p321
aVthe more likely that they are
p322
aVto come up with their own unique solutions to these problems.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today.
p325
aVGuess what?
p326
aVBooks.
p327
aVI have a suitcase full of books.
p328
aVHere's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."
p329
aVHere's a novel by Milan Kundera.
p330
aVAnd here's "The Guide for the Perplexed" by Maimonides.
p331
aVBut these are not exactly my books.
p332
aVI brought these books with me
p333
aVbecause they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors.
p334
aa(lp335
VMy grandfather was a rabbi
p336
aVand he was a widower
p337
aVwho lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn
p338
aVthat was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up,
p339
aVpartly because it was filled with his very gentle, very courtly presence
p340
aVand partly because it was filled with books.
p341
aVI mean literally every table, every chair in this apartment
p342
aVhad yielded its original function
p343
aVto now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books.
p344
aVJust like the rest of my family,
p345
aVmy grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read.
p346
aa(lp347
VBut he also loved his congregation,
p348
aVand you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave
p349
aVevery week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi.
p350
aVHe would takes the fruits of each week's reading
p351
aVand he would weave
p352
aVthese intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought.
p353
aVAnd people would come from all over to hear him speak.
p354
aa(lp355
VBut here's the thing about my grandfather.
p356
aVUnderneath this ceremonial role,
p357
aVhe was really modest and really introverted \u2014
p358
aVso much so that when he delivered these sermons,
p359
aVhe had trouble making eye contact
p360
aVwith the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years.
p361
aVAnd even away from the podium,
p362
aVwhen you called him to say hello,
p363
aVhe would often end the conversation prematurely
p364
aVfor fear that he was taking up too much of your time.
p365
aVBut when he died at the age of 94,
p366
aVthe police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood
p367
aVto accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him.
p368
aVAnd so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example
p369
aVin my own way.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo I just published a book about introversion,
p372
aVand it took me about seven years to write.
p373
aVAnd for me, that seven years was like total bliss,
p374
aVbecause I was reading, I was writing,
p375
aVI was thinking, I was researching.
p376
aVIt was my version
p377
aVof my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library.
p378
aVBut now all of a sudden my job is very different,
p379
aVand my job is to be out here talking about it,
p380
aVtalking about introversion.
p381
aa(lp382
V(Laughter)
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd that's a lot harder for me,
p385
aVbecause as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now,
p386
aVthis is not my natural milieu.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo I prepared for moments like these as best I could.
p389
aVI spent the last year practicing public speaking
p390
aVevery chance I could get.
p391
aVAnd I call this my "year of speaking dangerously."
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd that actually helped a lot.
p396
aVBut I'll tell you, what helps even more
p397
aVis my sense, my belief, my hope that when it comes to our attitudes
p398
aVto introversion and to quiet and to solitude,
p399
aVwe truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change.
p400
aVI mean, we are.
p401
aVAnd so I am going to leave you now
p402
aVwith three calls for action for those who share this vision.
p403
aa(lp404
VNumber one:
p405
aVStop the madness for constant group work.
p406
aVJust stop it.
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VThank you.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Applause)
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd I want to be clear about what I'm saying,
p415
aVbecause I deeply believe our offices
p416
aVshould be encouraging casual, chatty cafe-style types of interactions \u2014
p417
aVyou know, the kind where people come together
p418
aVand serendipitously have an exchange of ideas.
p419
aVThat is great.
p420
aVIt's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts.
p421
aVBut we need much more privacy and much more freedom
p422
aVand much more autonomy at work.
p423
aVSchool, same thing.
p424
aVWe need to be teaching kids to work together, for sure,
p425
aVbut we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own.
p426
aVThis is especially important for extroverted children too.
p427
aVThey need to work on their own
p428
aVbecause that is where deep thought comes from in part.
p429
aa(lp430
VOkay, number two: Go to the wilderness.
p431
aVBe like Buddha, have your own revelations.
p432
aVI'm not saying
p433
aVthat we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods
p434
aVand never talk to each other again,
p435
aVbut I am saying that we could all stand to unplug
p436
aVand get inside our own heads a little more often.
p437
aa(lp438
VNumber three:
p439
aVTake a good look at what's inside your own suitcase
p440
aVand why you put it there.
p441
aVSo extroverts,
p442
aVmaybe your suitcases are also full of books.
p443
aVOr maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment.
p444
aVWhatever it is, I hope you take these things out every chance you get
p445
aVand grace us with your energy and your joy.
p446
aVBut introverts, you being you,
p447
aVyou probably have the impulse to guard very carefully
p448
aVwhat's inside your own suitcase.
p449
aVAnd that's okay.
p450
aVBut occasionally, just occasionally,
p451
aVI hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see,
p452
aVbecause the world needs you and it needs the things you carry.

At least one-third of the people we know are introverts, notes Cain in her book&nbsp;<em>QUIET: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#39;t Stop Talking</em>. Although our culture undervalues them dramatically, introverts have made some of the great contributions to society -- from Chopin&#39;s nocturnes to the invention of the personal computer to Ghandi&#39;s transformative leadership. Cain argues that we design our schools, workplaces and religious institutions for extroverts, and that this bias creates a waste of talent, energy and happiness. Based on intensive research in psychology and neurobiology and on prolific interviews, she also explains why introverts are capable of great love and great achievement, not in spite of their temperament -- but because of them.</span></p>  <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">In 2015 Susan Cain announced the launch of her mission-based organization <a href=\\"http://www.quietrev.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Quiet Revolution</a> that aims to change the lives of introverts by empowering them with the information, tools and resources they need to survive and thrive.</span></p>  <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">In the workplace, companies are not fully harnessing the talents of their introverted employees and leadership teams are often imbalanced with many more extroverts than introverts. <a href=\\"http://qli.quietrev.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Quiet Leadership Institute</a> has worked with companies from LinkedIn to GE to Procter and Gamble to help them achieve their potential by providing learning experiences that unlock the power of introverts.</span></p>  <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">At the heart and center of the Quiet Revolution is empowering the next generation of children to know their own strengths and be freed from the sense of inadequacy that has shadowed the children of previous generations.

In addition, Susan has created a portal and a online learning experience for the parents of quiet children and has also established the Quiet Schools Network. Susan&#39;s <a href=\\"http://www.quietrev.com/susan-cain-quiet-podcast/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">podcast</a>, Quiet: The Power of Introverts debuted in February 2016 as a 10-part series designed to give parents and teachers the tools they need to empower quiet kids.</span></p>  <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Susan and the Quiet Revolution have received numerous accolades and press including <a href=\\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/03/susan-cain-quiet-revolution/\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Fortune</em> magazine</a>, <a href=\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/fashion/susan-cain-instigating-a-quiet-revolution-of-introverts.html?_r=0\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The New York Times</a>, <a href=\\"http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/02/18/465999756/how-parents-and-teachers-can-nurture-the-quiet-power-of-introverts\\" target=\\"_blank\\">NPR</a>and many more.</span></p>", "slug": "susan_cain", "whotheyare": "Our world prizes extroverts\\u2014but Susan Cain makes a case for the quiet and contemplative.

I thought my mother had taught me decent table manners, but my classmates had an elegant way of holding their utensils that would forever elude me.

I thought they were competing to make extra money washing dishes at the dining hall, and couldn\'t figure out why they needed the cash.

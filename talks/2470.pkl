VHere are two reasons companies fail:
p5
aVthey only do more of the same,
p6
aVor they only do what's new.
p7
aa(lp8
VTo me the real, real solution to quality growth
p9
aVis figuring out the balance between two activities:
p10
aVexploration and exploitation.
p11
aVBoth are necessary,
p12
aVbut it can be too much of a good thing.
p13
aa(lp14
VConsider Facit.
p15
aVI'm actually old enough to remember them.
p16
aVFacit was a fantastic company.
p17
aVThey were born deep in the Swedish forest,
p18
aVand they made the best mechanical calculators in the world.
p19
aVEverybody used them.
p20
aVAnd what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along?
p21
aVThey continued doing exactly the same.
p22
aVIn six months, they went from maximum revenue ...
p23
aVand they were gone.
p24
aVGone.
p25
aa(lp26
VTo me, the irony about the Facit story
p27
aVis hearing about the Facit engineers,
p28
aVwho had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan
p29
aVthat they used to double-check their calculators.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VFacit did too much exploitation.
p34
aVBut exploration can go wild, too.
p35
aa(lp36
VA few years back,
p37
aVI worked closely alongside a European biotech company.
p38
aVLet's call them OncoSearch.
p39
aVThe company was brilliant.
p40
aVThey had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure,
p41
aVcertain forms of blood cancer.
p42
aVEvery day was about creating something new.
p43
aVThey were extremely innovative,
p44
aVand the mantra was, "When we only get it right,"
p45
aVor even, "We want it perfect."
p46
aVThe sad thing is,
p47
aVbefore they became perfect \u2014
p48
aVeven good enough \u2014
p49
aVthey became obsolete.
p50
aVOncoSearch did too much exploration.
p51
aa(lp52
VI first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago,
p53
aVwhen I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University.
p54
aVThe founder of the idea is Jim March.
p55
aVAnd to me the power of the idea is its practicality.
p56
aa(lp57
VExploration.
p58
aVExploration is about coming up with what's new.
p59
aVIt's about search,
p60
aVit's about discovery,
p61
aVit's about new products,
p62
aVit's about new innovations.
p63
aVIt's about changing our frontiers.
p64
aVOur heroes are people who have done exploration:
p65
aVMadame Curie,
p66
aVPicasso,
p67
aVNeil Armstrong,
p68
aVSir Edmund Hillary, etc.
p69
aVI come from Norway;
p70
aVall our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be.
p71
aVWe all know that exploration is risky.
p72
aVWe don't know the answers,
p73
aVwe don't know if we're going to find them,
p74
aVand we know that the risks are high.
p75
aa(lp76
VExploitation is the opposite.
p77
aVExploitation is taking the knowledge we have
p78
aVand making good, better.
p79
aVExploitation is about making our trains run on time.
p80
aVIt's about making good products faster and cheaper.
p81
aVExploitation is not risky \u2014
p82
aVin the short term.
p83
aVBut if we only exploit,
p84
aVit's very risky in the long term.
p85
aVAnd I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups
p86
aVwho keep singing the same songs again and again,
p87
aVuntil they become obsolete or even pathetic.
p88
aVThat's the risk of exploitation.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo if we take a long-term perspective, we explore.
p91
aVIf we take a short-term perspective, we exploit.
p92
aVSmall children, they explore all day.
p93
aVAll day it's about exploration.
p94
aVAs we grow older,
p95
aVwe explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on.
p96
aVThe same goes for companies.
p97
aVCompanies become, by nature, less innovative
p98
aVas they become more competent.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs.
p101
aVAnd I hear very often questions phrased in different ways.
p102
aVFor example,
p103
aV"How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?"
p104
aVOr, "How can I make sure
p105
aVthat our company changes before we become obsolete
p106
aVor are hit by a crisis?"
p107
aVSo, doing one well is difficult.
p108
aVDoing both well as the same time is art \u2014
p109
aVpushing both exploration and exploitation.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo one thing we've found
p112
aVis only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore
p113
aVand exploit at the same time, in parallel.
p114
aVBut when they do,
p115
aVthe payoffs are huge.
p116
aVSo we have lots of great examples.
p117
aVWe have Nestlé creating Nespresso,
p118
aVwe have Lego going into animated films,
p119
aVToyota creating the hybrids,
p120
aVUnilever pushing into sustainability \u2014
p121
aVthere are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge.
p122
aa(lp123
VWhy is balancing so difficult?
p124
aVI think it's difficult because there are so many traps
p125
aVthat keep us where we are.
p126
aVSo I'll talk about two, but there are many.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo let's talk about the perpetual search trap.
p129
aVWe discover something,
p130
aVbut we don't have the patience or the persistence
p131
aVto get at it and make it work.
p132
aVSo instead of staying with it, we create something new.
p133
aVBut the same goes for that,
p134
aVthen we're in the vicious circle
p135
aVof actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated.
p136
aVOncoSearch was a good example.
p137
aVA famous example is, of course, Xerox.
p138
aVBut we don't only see this in companies.
p139
aVWe see this in the public sector as well.
p140
aVWe all know that any kind of effective reform of education,
p141
aVresearch, health care, even defense,
p142
aVtakes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.
p143
aVBut still, we change much more often.
p144
aVWe really don't give them the chance.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnother trap is the success trap.
p147
aVFacit fell into the success trap.
p148
aVThey literally held the future in their hands,
p149
aVbut they couldn't see it.
p150
aVThey were simply so good at making what they loved doing,
p151
aVthat they wouldn't change.
p152
aVWe are like that, too.
p153
aVWhen we know something well, it's difficult to change.
p154
aVBill Gates has said:
p155
aV"Success is a lousy teacher.
p156
aVIt seduces us into thinking we cannot fail."
p157
aVThat's the challenge with success.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us.
p160
aVAnd they apply to our companies.
p161
aVThe first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis.
p162
aVAnd any company that's able to innovate
p163
aVis actually able to also buy an insurance in the future.
p164
aVNetflix \u2014 they could so easily have been content
p165
aVwith earlier generations of distribution,
p166
aVbut they always \u2014 and I think they will always \u2014
p167
aVkeep pushing for the next battle.
p168
aVI see other companies that say,
p169
aV"I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes."
p170
aa(lp171
VSecond one: think in multiple time scales.
p172
aVI'll share a chart with you,
p173
aVand I think it's a wonderful one.
p174
aVAny company we look at,
p175
aVtaking a one-year perspective
p176
aVand looking at the valuation of the company,
p177
aVinnovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent.
p178
aVSo when we think one year,
p179
aVinnovation isn't really that important.
p180
aVMove ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company \u2014
p181
aVsuddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent.
p182
aVBut companies can't choose.
p183
aVThey need to fund the journey and lead the long term.
p184
aa(lp185
VThird:
p186
aVinvite talent.
p187
aVI don't think it's possible for any of us
p188
aVto be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves.
p189
aVI think it's a team sport.
p190
aVI think we need to allow challenging.
p191
aVI think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged,
p192
aVand the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge.
p193
aVI think that's also what good parenting is about.
p194
aa(lp195
VLast one: be skeptical of success.
p196
aVMaybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome,
p197
aVwhen the generals, after a big victory,
p198
aVwere given their celebration.
p199
aVRiding into Rome on the carriage,
p200
aVthey always had a companion whispering in their ear,
p201
aV"Remember, you're only human."
p202
aa(lp203
VSo I hope I made the point:
p204
aVbalancing exploration and exploitation
p205
aVhas a huge payoff.
p206
aVBut it's difficult, and we need to be conscious.
p207
aa(lp208
VI want to just point out two questions that I think are useful.
p209
aVFirst question is, looking at your own company:
p210
aVIn which areas do you see that the company is at the risk
p211
aVof falling into success traps,
p212
aVof just going on autopilot?
p213
aVAnd what can you do to challenge?
p214
aa(lp215
VSecond question is:
p216
aVWhen did I explore something new last,
p217
aVand what kind of effect did it have on me?
p218
aVIs that something I should do more of?
p219
aVIn my case, yes.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo let me leave you with this.
p222
aVWhether you're an explorer by nature
p223
aVor whether you tend to exploit what you already know,
p224
aVdon't forget: the beauty is in the balance.
p225
aa(lp226
VThank you.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)

VFirst place I'd like to take you
p5
aVis what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.
p6
aVAnd I say believe because this process is still ongoing.
p7
aVRight now there are major expeditions being planned for next year
p8
aVthat I'll talk a little bit about.
p9
aa(lp10
VOne of the things that's changed here,
p11
aVin the last 150 years since Jules Verne
p12
aVhad great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,
p13
aVis that technology has enabled us to go to these places
p14
aVthat were previously completely unknown and speculated about.
p15
aVWe can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.
p16
aVAlong the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large
p17
aVthat you can see for hundreds of meters
p18
aVwithout a break in the line of sight.
p19
aVWhen you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field
p20
aVfor anywhere from two to four months,
p21
aVwith a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd a lot of people ask me, you know,
p24
aVwhat kind of people do you get for a project like this?
p25
aVWhile our selection process
p26
aVis not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.
p27
aVWe're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.
p28
aVIn case you're wondering, this is our strength test.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVBut we also value esprit de corps
p31
aVand the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict
p32
aVwhile under great stress in remote locations.
p33
aa(lp34
VWe have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.
p35
aVFrom the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.
p36
aVYou're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.
p37
aVWe're roughly two days from the entrance at that point.
p38
aVAnd it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse,
p39
aVexcept that you're now running a string of these things down.
p40
aVThe idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort
p41
aVwhile you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.
p42
aVI should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,
p43
aVis artificially illuminated at great effort.
p44
aVOtherwise it is completely dark in these places.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.
p47
aVIt's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.
p48
aVAnd eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous
p49
aVand unfortunately slides just don't do justice.
p50
aVSo I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.
p51
aVSo descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.
p52
aV(Video)
p53
aVNow I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here
p54
aVare obsolete and dangerous.
p55
aVWe would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VAlong that same line, I have to tell you
p59
aVthat with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,
p60
aVwe have never seen monsters underground \u2014
p61
aVat least the kind that eat you.
p62
aVIf there is a monster underground,
p63
aVit is the crushing psychological remoteness
p64
aVthat begins to hit every member of the team
p65
aVonce you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.
p66
aa(lp67
VNext year I'll be leading an international team to J2.
p68
aVWe're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters \u2014
p69
aVthat's a little over 8,600 feet down \u2014
p70
aVat 30 kilometers from the entrance.
p71
aVThe lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.
p72
aVI don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.
p73
aa(lp74
VEventually, if you keep going down in these things,
p75
aVprobability says that you're going to run into a place like this.
p76
aVIt's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum
p77
aVthat collects water and fills to the roof.
p78
aVAnd when you used to find these things,
p79
aVthey would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.
p80
aVNow I remember that term really well for two reasons.
p81
aVNumber one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,
p82
aVis because the confrontation of these things
p83
aVforced me to become an inventor.
p84
aVAnd we've since gone on to develop
p85
aVmany generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.
p86
aa(lp87
VThis is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.
p88
aVAnd you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally
p89
aVunderwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.
p90
aVWhen you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.
p91
aVIt's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,
p92
aVbut at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.
p93
aVSo it makes you think about how to design your equipment
p94
aVfor long range, away from a safe haven.
p95
aa(lp96
VHere's a clip from a National Geographic movie
p97
aVthat came out in 1999.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process
p100
aVof putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.
p101
aVThis is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.
p102
aVTo experience it is a privilege.
p103
aa(lp104
VBill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.
p105
aVCouple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment
p106
aVthat you saw in there did not exist before 1999.
p107
aVIt was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.
p108
aVThis gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,
p109
aVand it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done
p110
aVof a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.
p111
aVIt was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door
p112
aVto another unexplored world.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis is Europa.
p115
aVCarolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.
p116
aVThis is one of the places where planetary scientists
p117
aVbelieve there is a highest probability of the detection
p118
aVof the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.
p119
aVFor those who have never seen this story,
p120
aVJim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie
p121
aVcouple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep."
p122
aVThere was a brief clip \u2014
p123
aa(lp124
V(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa
p125
aVwould be the ultimate robotic challenge.
p126
aVEuropa is so far away that even at the speed of light,
p127
aVit would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.
p128
aVIt has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards
p129
aVand to find a good landing site on the ice.
p130
aVNow we have to get through the ice.
p131
aVYou need a melt probe.
p132
aVIt's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.
p133
aVThe ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.
p134
aVWeek after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight
p135
aVthrough the ancient ice, until finally \u2014
p136
aVNow, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?
p137
aVYou need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.
p138
aVIt needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate
p139
aVand make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.
p140
aa(lp141
VBS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie
p142
aVwas that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled
p143
aVto develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.
p144
aVI mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design
p145
aVand system integration, and introduced DEPTHX \u2014
p146
aVDeep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.
p147
aVAnd as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.
p148
aVIt's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,
p149
aV100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code,
p150
aVpacks more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.
p151
aa(lp152
VThis is the target site,
p153
aVthe world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.
p154
aVIt's been explored to a depth of 292 meters
p155
aVand beyond that nobody knows anything.
p156
aVThis is part of DEPTHX's mission.
p157
aa(lp158
VThere are two primary targets we're doing here.
p159
aVOne is, how do you do science autonomy underground?
p160
aVHow do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?
p161
aVThere are more stages involved here
p162
aVthan I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive
p163
aVthrough the space, we populate it with environmental variables \u2014
p164
aVsulphide, halide, things like that.
p165
aVWe calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall
p166
aVwhere there's a high probability of life.
p167
aVWe move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,
p168
aVlooking for changes in color.
p169
aVIf we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.
p170
aVIf it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.
p171
aVWe either draw in a liquid sample,
p172
aVor we can actually take a solid core from the wall.
p173
aVNo hands at the wheel.
p174
aVThis is all behavioral autonomy here
p175
aVthat's being conducted by the robot on its own.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe real hat trick for this vehicle, though,
p178
aVis a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,
p179
aVknown as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.
p180
aVDEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.
p181
aVIts sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,
p182
aVallowing it to do new exploration
p183
aVwhile it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock
p184
aVon what it's gone through already.
p185
aa(lp186
VWhat I'm going to show you next
p187
aVis the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground
p188
aVthat's ever been done.
p189
aVThis May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,
p190
aVand if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first
p191
aVrobotically-discovered division of bacteria.
p192
aVThe next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,
p193
aVif the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,
p194
aVwe could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019
p195
aVwe may have the first evidence of life off this planet.
p196
aa(lp197
VWhat then of manned space exploration?
p198
aVThe government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.
p199
aVThe successful conclusion of that mission will result
p200
aVin infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number
p201
aVof government scientists and pilots.
p202
aVIt will leave us no further along in the general expansion
p203
aVof humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.
p204
aVSomething fundamental has to change
p205
aVif we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.
p206
aa(lp207
VWhat I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.
p208
aVAnd I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith
p209
aVthat there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.
p210
aVThere are three underpinnings of working in space privately.
p211
aVOne of them is the requirement
p212
aVfor economical earth-to-space transport.
p213
aVThe Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world
p214
aVhave got this in their sights and I salute them.
p215
aVGo, go, go.
p216
aa(lp217
VThe next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.
p218
aVOrbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.
p219
aVThe final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:
p220
aVa gas station on orbit.
p221
aVIt's not going to look like that.
p222
aVIf it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow, to give you a chance to understand
p225
aVwhy there is power in that statement,
p226
aVI've got to give you the basics of Space 101.
p227
aVAnd the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.
p228
aVAnybody drink one of these here this week?
p229
aVYou'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.
p230
aVThat's more than you pay for TED,
p231
aVif Google dropped their sponsorship.
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aVThe second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.
p234
aVThus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,
p235
aVyou are literally blowing away enormous sums of money
p236
aVevery time you hit the accelerator.
p237
aVNot even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?
p240
aVThere is a place where you can.
p241
aVIn fact, you can get it better \u2014 you can get it at 14 times lower
p242
aVif you can find propellant on the moon.
p243
aVThere is a little-known mission that was launched
p244
aVby the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.
p245
aVAnd the most amazing thing that came out of that mission
p246
aVwas a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater
p247
aVon the south pole of the moon.
p248
aVThat signal was so strong,
p249
aVit could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water
p250
aVburied in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years
p251
aVby the impact of asteroids and comet material.
p252
aa(lp253
VIf we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible,
p254
aVwe have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.
p255
aVWe can't do that right now.
p256
aVThe way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack
p257
aVthat has to be launched from the ground,
p258
aVand resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.
p259
aVWe have to beat that.
p260
aVWe can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.
p261
aVWe can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.
p262
aVThis is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,
p263
aVwith Dr. Lowell Wood's group.
p264
aVAnd we can extend that now to just about everything.
p265
aVBob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.
p266
aVWe can go much further.
p267
aVWe can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.
p268
aVThere's another thing.
p269
aVWhen you're coming back from the moon,
p270
aVyou have to deal with orbital mechanics.
p271
aVIt says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster
p272
aVthan you really want to be to get back to your gas station.
p273
aa(lp274
VYou got two choices.
p275
aVYou can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.
p276
aVYou can dive into the stratosphere,
p277
aVand precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.
p278
aVIt has never been done.
p279
aVIt's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride \u2014
p280
aVbetter than Disney.
p281
aVThe traditional approach to space exploration
p282
aVhas been that you carry all the fuel you need
p283
aVto get everybody back in case of an emergency.
p284
aVIf you try to do that for the moon,
p285
aVyou're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.
p286
aVBut if you send a mining team there,
p287
aVwithout the return propellant, first \u2014
p288
aV(Laughter)
p289
aVDid any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?
p290
aVThis is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.
p291
aVI like this equipment, you know, and I really value it
p292
aVso we're not going to burn the gear.
p293
aVBut, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,
p294
aVand it would be the most dramatic demonstration
p295
aVthat you could do something worthwhile off this planet
p296
aVthat has ever been done.
p297
aVThere's a myth that you can't do anything in space
p298
aVfor less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.
p299
aVThat's not true.
p300
aVIn seven years, we could pull off
p301
aVan industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate
p302
aVthat you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.
p303
aa(lp304
VWe're living in one of the most exciting times in history.
p305
aVWe're at a magical confluence where private wealth
p306
aVand imagination are driving the demand for access to space.
p307
aVThe orbital refueling stations I've just described
p308
aVcould create an entirely new industry and provide the final key
p309
aVfor opening space to the general exploration.
p310
aVTo bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.
p311
aVWe can do it by jump-starting with an industrial
p312
aVLewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,
p313
aVto mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate
p314
aVthey can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.
p315
aa(lp316
VTalk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities
p317
aVof purpose and timing.
p318
aVI would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.
p319
aVI intend to lead that expedition.
p320
aV(Applause)
p321
aVIt can be done in seven years with the right backing.
p322
aVThose who join me in making it happen will become a part of history
p323
aVand join other bold individuals from time past
p324
aVwho, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.
p325
aa(lp326
VThere was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.
p327
aVWe have collectively forgotten that lesson.
p328
aVNow we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.
p329
aV100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words,
p330
aVI intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon
p331
aVand complete the final piece
p332
aVthat will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.
p333
aVThank you.
p334
aV(Applause)

After years of crawling through the deepest unexplored <a href=\\"http://geni.us/beyondthedeep\\" target=\\"_blank\\">caves</a>  on the planet, he&#39;s building robots to go where he can&#39;t. His company <a href=\\"http://www.stoneaerospace.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Stone Aerospace</a>  built DepthX, an autonomous robot, which descended 1,099 feet down Mexico&#39;s deepest watery sinkhole.

VSadly,
p5
aVin the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,
p6
aVfour Americans that are alive
p7
aVwill be dead through the food that they eat.
p8
aa(lp9
VMy name's Jamie Oliver.
p10
aVI'm 34 years old.
p11
aVI'm from Essex in England
p12
aVand for the last seven years
p13
aVI've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way.
p14
aVI'm not a doctor;
p15
aVI'm a chef,
p16
aVI don't have expensive equipment
p17
aVor medicine.
p18
aVI use information, education.
p19
aa(lp20
VI profoundly believe that the power of food
p21
aVhas a primal place in our homes
p22
aVthat binds us to the best bits of life.
p23
aVWe have an awful, awful reality right now.
p24
aVAmerica, you're at the top of your game.
p25
aVThis is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.
p26
aa(lp27
VCan I please just see a raise of hands
p28
aVfor how many of you have children in this room today?
p29
aVPut your hands up.
p30
aVYou can continue to put your hands up, aunties and uncles as well.
p31
aVMost of you. OK.
p32
aVWe, the adults of the last four generations,
p33
aVhave blessed our children with the destiny
p34
aVof a shorter lifespan than their own parents.
p35
aVYour child will live a life ten years younger than you
p36
aVbecause of the landscape of food that we've built around them.
p37
aVTwo-thirds of this room,
p38
aVtoday, in America, are statistically overweight or obese.
p39
aVYou lot, you're all right,
p40
aVbut we'll get you eventually, don't worry.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VThe statistics of bad health are clear,
p45
aVvery clear.
p46
aVWe spend our lives being paranoid about death, murder, homicide,
p47
aVyou name it; it's on the front page of every paper, CNN.
p48
aVLook at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake.
p49
aVRight?
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
V(Applause)
p54
aa(lp55
VEvery single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease.
p56
aVAny doctor, any specialist will tell you that.
p57
aVFact: diet-related disease is the biggest killer
p58
aVin the United States, right now, here today.
p59
aVThis is a global problem.
p60
aVIt's a catastrophe.
p61
aVIt's sweeping the world.
p62
aVEngland is right behind you, as usual.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VI know they were close, but not that close.
p67
aVWe need a revolution.
p68
aVMexico, Australia, Germany,
p69
aVIndia, China,
p70
aVall have massive problems of obesity and bad health.
p71
aVThink about smoking.
p72
aVIt costs way less than obesity now.
p73
aVObesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your health-care bills,
p74
aV150 billion dollars a year.
p75
aVIn 10 years, it's set to double:
p76
aV300 billion dollars a year.
p77
aVLet's be honest, guys, you haven't got that cash.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VI came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in.
p82
aVWe need it. The time is now.
p83
aVWe're in a tipping-point moment.
p84
aVI've been doing this for seven years.
p85
aVI've been trying in America for seven years.
p86
aVNow is the time when it's ripe \u2014 ripe for the picking.
p87
aVI went to the eye of the storm.
p88
aVI went to West Virginia, the most unhealthy state in America.
p89
aVOr it was last year.
p90
aVWe've got a new one this year, but we'll work on that next season.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VHuntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.
p95
aVI wanted to put heart and soul and people,
p96
aVyour public,
p97
aVaround the statistics that we've become so used to.
p98
aVI want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about:
p99
aVyour public, your children.
p100
aVI want to show a picture of my friend Brittany.
p101
aVShe's 16 years old.
p102
aVShe's got six years to live
p103
aVbecause of the food that she's eaten.
p104
aVShe's the third generation of Americans
p105
aVthat hasn't grown up within a food environment
p106
aVwhere they've been taught to cook at home or in school,
p107
aVor her mom, or her mom's mom.
p108
aVShe has six years to live.
p109
aVShe's eating her liver to death.
p110
aa(lp111
VStacy, the Edwards family.
p112
aVThis is a normal family, guys.
p113
aVStacy does her best, but she's third-generation as well;
p114
aVshe was never taught to cook at home or at school.
p115
aVThe family's obese.
p116
aVJustin here, 12 years old, he's 350 pounds.
p117
aVHe gets bullied, for God's sake.
p118
aVThe daughter there, Katie, she's four years old.
p119
aVShe's obese before she even gets to primary school.
p120
aVMarissa, she's all right, she's one of your lot.
p121
aVBut you know what?
p122
aVHer father, who was obese, died in her arms,
p123
aVAnd then the second most important man in her life,
p124
aVher uncle, died of obesity,
p125
aVand now her step-dad is obese.
p126
aVYou see, the thing is,
p127
aVobesity and diet-related disease
p128
aVdoesn't just hurt the people that have it;
p129
aVit's all of their friends, families, brothers, sisters.
p130
aa(lp131
VPastor Steve:
p132
aVan inspirational man,
p133
aVone of my early allies in Huntington, West Virginia.
p134
aVHe's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem.
p135
aVHe has to bury the people, OK?
p136
aVAnd he's fed up with it.
p137
aVHe's fed up with burying his friends, his family, his community.
p138
aVCome winter, three times as many people die.
p139
aVHe's sick of it.
p140
aVThis is preventable disease. Waste of life.
p141
aVBy the way, this is what they get buried in.
p142
aVWe're not geared up to do this.
p143
aVCan't even get them out the door, and I'm being serious.
p144
aVCan't even get them there. Forklift.
p145
aa(lp146
VOK, I see it as a triangle, OK?
p147
aVThis is our landscape of food.
p148
aVI need you to understand it.
p149
aVYou've probably heard all this before.
p150
aVOver the last 30 years,
p151
aVwhat's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country?
p152
aVLet's be frank and honest.
p153
aVWell, modern-day life.
p154
aa(lp155
VLet's start with the Main Street.
p156
aVFast food has taken over the whole country; we know that.
p157
aVThe big brands are some of the most important powers,
p158
aVpowerful powers, in this country.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Sighs)
p161
aa(lp162
VSupermarkets as well.
p163
aVBig companies. Big companies.
p164
aVThirty years ago, most of the food
p165
aVwas largely local and largely fresh.
p166
aVNow it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives,
p167
aVextra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story.
p168
aVPortion size is obviously a massive, massive problem.
p169
aVLabeling is a massive problem.
p170
aVThe labeling in this country is a disgrace.
p171
aVThe industry wants to self-police themselves.
p172
aVWhat, in this kind of climate? They don't deserve it.
p173
aVHow can you say something is low-fat when it's full of so much sugar?
p174
aa(lp175
VHome.
p176
aVThe biggest problem with the home
p177
aVis that used to be the heart of passing on food culture,
p178
aVwhat made our society.
p179
aVThat is not happening anymore.
p180
aVAnd you know, as we go to work and as life changes,
p181
aVand as life always evolves,
p182
aVwe kind of have to look at it holistically \u2014
p183
aVstep back for a moment, and re-address the balance.
p184
aVIt hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?
p185
aVI want to show you a situation
p186
aVthat is very normal right now; the Edwards family.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.
p189
aVThis stuff goes through you and your family's body every week.
p190
aVAnd I need you to know
p191
aVthat this is going to kill your children early.
p192
aVHow are you feeling?
p193
aa(lp194
VStacy: Just feeling really sad and depressed right now.
p195
aVBut, you know, I want my kids to succeed in life
p196
aVand this isn't going to get them there.
p197
aVBut I'm killing them.
p198
aa(lp199
VJO: Yes you are. You are.
p200
aVBut we can stop that.
p201
aVNormal.
p202
aVLet's get on schools,
p203
aVsomething that I'm fairly much a specialist in.
p204
aVOK, school.
p205
aVWhat is school? Who invented it? What's the purpose of school?
p206
aVSchool was always invented to arm us with the tools
p207
aVto make us creative, do wonderful things,
p208
aVmake us earn a living, etc., etc.
p209
aVYou know, it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long, long time, OK?
p210
aVBut we haven't really evolved it
p211
aVto deal with the health catastrophes of America, OK?
p212
aVSchool food is something
p213
aVthat most kids \u2014 31 million a day, actually \u2014
p214
aVhave twice a day, more than often, breakfast and lunch,
p215
aV180 days of the year.
p216
aVSo you could say that school food is quite important, really,
p217
aVjudging the circumstances.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VBefore I crack into my rant,
p222
aVwhich I'm sure you're waiting for \u2014
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VI need to say one thing, and it's so important
p227
aVin, hopefully, the magic that happens and unfolds
p228
aVin the next three months.
p229
aVThe lunch ladies, the lunch cooks of America \u2014
p230
aVI offer myself as their ambassador.
p231
aVI'm not slagging them off.
p232
aVThey're doing the best they can do.
p233
aVThey're doing their best.
p234
aVBut they're doing what they're told,
p235
aVand what they're being told to do is wrong.
p236
aVThe system is highly run by accountants;
p237
aVthere's not enough, or any, food-knowledgeable people in the business.
p238
aVThere's a problem:
p239
aVIf you're not a food expert, and you've got tight budgets
p240
aVand it's getting tighter, then you can't be creative,
p241
aVyou can't duck and dive and write different things around things.
p242
aVIf you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,
p243
aVthe only thing you can do in these circumstances
p244
aVis buy cheaper shit.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow, the reality is,
p247
aVthe food that your kids get every day is fast food,
p248
aVit's highly processed,
p249
aVthere's not enough fresh food in there at all.
p250
aVYou know, the amount of additives, E numbers,
p251
aVingredients you wouldn't believe \u2014
p252
aVthere's not enough veggies at all.
p253
aVFrench fries are considered a vegetable.
p254
aVPizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery.
p255
aVKnives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.
p256
aVThey have scissors in the classroom,
p257
aVbut knives and forks? No.
p258
aVAnd the way I look at it is:
p259
aVIf you don't have knives and forks in your school,
p260
aVyou're purely endorsing,
p261
aVfrom a state level, fast food, because it's handheld.
p262
aVAnd yes, by the way, it is fast food:
p263
aVIt's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,
p264
aVit's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Sighs)
p267
aa(lp268
VTen percent of what we spend on health care, as I said earlier,
p269
aVis on obesity, and it's going to double.
p270
aVWe're not teaching our kids.
p271
aVThere's no statutory right to teach kids about food,
p272
aVelementary or secondary school, OK?
p273
aVWe don't teach kids about food, right?
p274
aVAnd this is a little clip from an elementary school,
p275
aVwhich is very common in England.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Video) Who knows what this is?
p278
aa(lp279
VChild: Potatoes.
p280
aa(lp281
VJamie Oliver: Potato? So, you think these are potatoes?
p282
aVDo you know what that is?
p283
aVDo you know what that is?
p284
aa(lp285
VChild: Broccoli?
p286
aa(lp287
VJO: What about this? Our good old friend.
p288
aa(lp289
VChild: Celery.
p290
aa(lp291
VJO: No. What do you think this is?
p292
aa(lp293
VChild: Onion. JO: Onion? No.
p294
aa(lp295
VJO: Immediately you get a really clear sense
p296
aVof "Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?"
p297
aVWho knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?
p298
aa(lp299
VJO: What do you think this is? Child: I don't know.
p300
aa(lp301
VJO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,
p302
aVthen they will never eat it.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VJO: Normal. England and America,
p307
aVEngland and America.
p308
aVGuess what fixed that.
p309
aVTwo one-hour sessions.
p310
aVWe've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools, period.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VI want to tell you about something
p315
aVthat kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in, guys, OK?
p316
aVI want to talk about something so basic as milk.
p317
aVEvery kid has the right to milk at school.
p318
aVYour kids will be having milk at school, breakfast and lunch, right?
p319
aVThey'll be having two bottles, OK?
p320
aVAnd most kids do.
p321
aVBut milk ain't good enough anymore.
p322
aVDon't get me wrong, I support milk \u2014
p323
aVbut someone at the milk board
p324
aVprobably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out
p325
aVthat if you put loads of flavorings,
p326
aVcolorings and sugar in milk,
p327
aVmore kids will drink it.
p328
aVYeah.
p329
aa(lp330
VObviously now that's going to catch on
p331
aVthe apple board is going to work out
p332
aVthat if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well.
p333
aVDo you know what I mean?
p334
aVFor me, there isn't any need to flavor the milk.
p335
aVOkay? There's sugar in everything.
p336
aVI know the ins and outs of those ingredients.
p337
aVIt's in everything.
p338
aVEven the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems.
p339
aVThere's our milk. There's our carton.
p340
aVIn that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,
p341
aVand they are having two a day.
p342
aVSo, let me just show you.
p343
aVWe've got one kid, here \u2014
p344
aVhaving, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day.
p345
aVYou know, there's your week.
p346
aVThere's your month.
p347
aVAnd I've taken the liberty of putting in
p348
aVjust the five years of elementary school sugar,
p349
aVjust from milk.
p350
aVNow, I don't know about you guys,
p351
aVbut judging the circumstances, right,
p352
aVany judge in the whole world,
p353
aVwould look at the statistics and the evidence,
p354
aVand they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse.
p355
aVThat's my belief.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
V(Applause ends)
p360
aa(lp361
VNow, if I came up here, and I wish I could come up here today
p362
aVand hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,
p363
aVyou'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me.
p364
aVThis, all this bad news, is preventable.
p365
aVThat's the good news.
p366
aVIt's very, very preventable.
p367
aVSo, let's just think about, we got a problem here,
p368
aVwe need to reboot.
p369
aVOkay so, in my world, what do we need to do?
p370
aVHere is the thing, right,
p371
aVit cannot just come from one source.
p372
aVTo reboot and make real tangible change,
p373
aVreal change, so that I could look you in the white of the eyes
p374
aVand say, "In 10 years' time,
p375
aVthe history of your children's lives,
p376
aVhappiness \u2014 and let's not forget, you're clever if you eat well,
p377
aVyou know you're going to live longer \u2014
p378
aVall of that stuff, it will look different. OK?"
p379
aa(lp380
VSo, supermarkets.
p381
aVWhere else do you shop so religiously?
p382
aVWeek in, week out.
p383
aVHow much money do you spend, in your life, in a supermarket?
p384
aVLove them.
p385
aVThey just sell us what we want. All right.
p386
aVThey owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket.
p387
aVThey need to help us shop.
p388
aVThey need to show us how to cook quick, tasty, seasonal meals
p389
aVfor people that are busy.
p390
aVThis is not expensive.
p391
aVIt is done in some, and it needs to be done across the board
p392
aVin America soon, and quick.
p393
aVThe big brands, you know, the food brands,
p394
aVneed to put food education at the heart of their businesses.
p395
aVI know, easier said than done.
p396
aVIt's the future. It's the only way.
p397
aa(lp398
VFast food.
p399
aVWith the fast-food industry
p400
aVyou know, it's very competitive.
p401
aVI've had loads of secret papers and dealings
p402
aVwith fast food restaurants.
p403
aVI know how they do it.
p404
aVI mean, basically they've weaned us on
p405
aVto these hits of sugar, salt and fat, and x, y, and z,
p406
aVand everyone loves them, right?
p407
aVSo, these guys are going to be part of the solution.
p408
aVBut we need to get the government to work
p409
aVwith all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry,
p410
aVand over a five, six, seven year period
p411
aVwean of us off the extreme amounts
p412
aVof fat, sugar and all the other non-food ingredients.
p413
aa(lp414
VNow, also, back to the sort of big brands:
p415
aVlabeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce
p416
aVand has got to be sorted.
p417
aVOK, school.
p418
aVObviously, in schools, we owe it to them
p419
aVto make sure those 180 days of the year,
p420
aVfrom that little precious age of four,
p421
aVuntil 18, 20, 24, whatever,
p422
aVthey need to be cooked proper, fresh food
p423
aVfrom local growers on site, OK?
p424
aVThere needs to be a new standard of fresh, proper food
p425
aVfor your children, yeah?
p426
aa(lp427
V(Applause)
p428
aa(lp429
VUnder the circumstances, it's profoundly important
p430
aVthat every single American child leaves school
p431
aVknowing how to cook 10 recipes
p432
aVthat will save their life.
p433
aVLife skills.
p434
aa(lp435
V(Applause)
p436
aa(lp437
VThat means that they can be students, young parents,
p438
aVand be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking,
p439
aVno matter what recession hits them next time.
p440
aVIf you can cook, recession money doesn't matter.
p441
aVIf you can cook, time doesn't matter.
p442
aVThe workplace, we haven't really talked about it.
p443
aVYou know, it's now time for corporate responsibility
p444
aVto really look at what they feed or make available to their staff.
p445
aVThe staff are the moms and dads of America's children.
p446
aVMarissa, her father died in her hand,
p447
aVI think she'd be quite happy
p448
aVif corporate America could start feeding their staff properly.
p449
aVDefinitely they shouldn't be left out.
p450
aVLet's go back to the home.
p451
aa(lp452
VNow, look, if we do all this stuff, and we can,
p453
aVit's so achievable.
p454
aVYou can care and be commercial.
p455
aVAbsolutely.
p456
aVBut the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.
p457
aVFor sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
p458
aVAnd for me, it's quite romantic,
p459
aVbut it's about if one person teaches three people
p460
aVhow to cook something,
p461
aVand they teach three of their mates,
p462
aVthat only has to repeat itself 25 times,
p463
aVand that's the whole population of America.
p464
aVRomantic, yes, but most importantly,
p465
aVit's about trying to get people to realize

VThat's all it takes, six-and-a-half grand per school.

He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for inspiring people to eat fresh, honest, delicious food. While serving as sous chef at the River Cafe in London, the BBC took note of him. His series, <em>The Naked Chef</em>, debuted in 1999. In the years since, he has built a worldwide media empire of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>As much as Oliver&#39;s cooking is generous, so is his business model. The Jamie Oliver Food Foundation trains young chefs from disadvantaged backgrounds to work in his restaurants and runs an extensive gardening program that teaches children where food comes from. Series like <em>Jamie&#39;s School Dinner</em>, <em>Jamie&#39;s Ministry of Food</em> and <em>Jamie Oliver&#39;s Food Revolution</em>&nbsp;combine his work in the kitchen with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.</p><p>Oliver uses his fame and charm to highlight the changes people need to make in their diet and lifestyles.

"middleinitial": "", "whylisten": "<p>Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father&#39;s pub. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for inspiring people to eat fresh, honest, delicious food. While serving as sous chef at the River Cafe in London, the BBC took note of him. His series, <em>The Naked Chef</em>, debuted in 1999. In the years since, he has built a worldwide media empire of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>As much as Oliver&#39;s cooking is generous, so is his business model. The Jamie Oliver Food Foundation trains young chefs from disadvantaged backgrounds to work in his restaurants and runs an extensive gardening program that teaches children where food comes from. Series like <em>Jamie&#39;s School Dinner</em>, <em>Jamie&#39;s Ministry of Food</em> and <em>Jamie Oliver&#39;s Food Revolution</em>&nbsp;combine his work in the kitchen with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.</p><p>Oliver uses his fame and charm to highlight the changes people need to make in their diet and lifestyles. With the&nbsp;<a href=\\"/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/food-revolution\\" target=\\"_blank\\" onclick=\\"window.open(\'\',\'\',\'\');return false;\\">2010 TED Prize</a>, he set the vision for&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.jamiesfoodrevolution.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" onclick=\\"window.open(\'\',\'\',\'\');return false;\\">Jamie&#39;s Food Revolution</a>, a global campaign to educate kids about food and inspire families to cook again. More than 750,000 people have signed up to be a part of it.

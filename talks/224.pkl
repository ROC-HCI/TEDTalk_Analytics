VRoy Gould: Less than a year from now,
p5
aVthe world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy,
p6
aVwhich marks the 400th anniversary
p7
aVof Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope.
p8
aVIn a few months, the world is also going to celebrate
p9
aVthe launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research,
p10
aVwhich I think is going to have as profound an impact
p11
aVon the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago.
p12
aVIt's called the WorldWide Telescope,
p13
aVand I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention.
p14
aVAnd I want to urge you, when you get a chance,
p15
aVto give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe WorldWide Telescope takes the best images
p18
aVfrom the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space,
p19
aVand has woven them seamlessly
p20
aVto produce a holistic view of the universe.
p21
aVIt's going to change the way we do astronomy,
p22
aVit's going to change the way we teach astronomy
p23
aVand I think most importantly
p24
aVit's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe.
p25
aa(lp26
VIf we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day,
p27
aVthat might not be so big a claim.
p28
aVIn 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink;
p29
aVif you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote;
p30
aVand if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night,
p31
aVwhat you saw was thought to be the entire universe.
p32
aVIn fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then
p33
aVgave a great debate in which he argued
p34
aVthat the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe.
p35
aa(lp36
VHarvard was wrong, big time. (Laughter)
p37
aVOf course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy.
p38
aVWe can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe,
p39
aVall the way back in time,
p40
aValmost to the moment of the Big Bang itself.
p41
aVWe can see across the entire spectrum of light,
p42
aVrevealing worlds that had previously been invisible.
p43
aVWe see these magnificent star nurseries,
p44
aVwhere nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers
p45
aVand just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise.
p46
aVWe see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems \u2014
p47
aV300 now, and still counting \u2014
p48
aVand they're not like us.
p49
aVWe see black holes at the heart of our galaxy,
p50
aVin the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe,
p51
aVwhere time itself seems to stand still.
p52
aVBut until now, our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented,
p53
aVand I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us
p54
aVhave fallen through the cracks. And that's changing.
p55
aa(lp56
VI want to just briefly mention three reasons
p57
aVwhy my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education,
p58
aVare so excited about the WorldWide Telescope
p59
aVand why we think it's truly transformative.
p60
aVFirst, it enables you to experience the universe:
p61
aVthe WorldWide Telescope, for me, is a kind of magic carpet
p62
aVthat lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go.
p63
aVSecond: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides.
p64
aVAnd I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing,
p65
aVbut really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe,
p66
aVwho can share their enthusiasm
p67
aVand can make the universe a welcoming place.
p68
aVAnd third, you can create your own tours \u2014
p69
aVyou can share them with friends, you can create them with friends \u2014
p70
aVand that's the part that I think I'm most excited about
p71
aVbecause I think that at heart, we are all storytellers.
p72
aVAnd in telling stories,
p73
aVeach of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.
p74
aVWe're going to have a personal universe.
p75
aVI think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge.
p76
aa(lp77
VBefore I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope,
p78
aVI just want to leave you with this brief thought:
p79
aVwhen I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?"
p80
aVthey often say, "Oh, tiny. I feel tiny and insignificant."
p81
aVWell, our gaze fills the universe.
p82
aVAnd thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope,
p83
aVwe can now start to have a dialogue with the universe.
p84
aVI think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you
p85
aVthat we may be tiny, but we are truly, wonderfully significant.
p86
aVThank you.
p87
aV(Applause)
p88
aa(lp89
VI can't tell you what a privilege it is
p90
aVto introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. (Applause)
p91
aa(lp92
VCurtis Wong: Thank you, Roy.
p93
aVSo, what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation,
p94
aVbut it's one of the tours.
p95
aVAnd actually this tour is one that was created earlier.
p96
aVAnd the tours are all totally interactive,
p97
aVso that if I were to go somewhere ...
p98
aVyou may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way,
p99
aVpull up other information \u2014
p100
aVthere are lots of Web and information sources
p101
aVabout places you might want to go \u2014
p102
aVyou can zoom in, you can pull back out.
p103
aVThe whole resources are there available for you.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo, Microsoft \u2014 this is a project that \u2014 WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray,
p106
aVwho's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did
p107
aVis really what makes this project possible.
p108
aVIt's a labor of love for us and our small team,
p109
aVand we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.
p110
aVSo basically, kids of all ages, like us.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring.
p113
aVIt'll be a free download \u2014 thank you, Craig Mundie \u2014
p114
aVand it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org,
p115
aVwhich is something new.
p116
aVAnd so, what you've seen today
p117
aVis less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here,
p118
aVand in the TED Lab, we have a tour
p119
aVthat was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin
p120
aVthat will knock your socks off. (Laughter)
p121
aVSo we'll see you there. Thank you.
p122
aV(Applause)

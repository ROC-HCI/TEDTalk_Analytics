VWhen I graduated UCLA, I moved to northern California,
p5
aVand I lived in a little town called Elk
p6
aVon the Mendocino coast,
p7
aVand I didn't have a phone or TV, but I had U.S. mail,
p8
aVand life was good back then, if you could remember it.
p9
aVI'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee
p10
aVand a brownie, and I'd ship my film
p11
aVto San Francisco, and lo and behold, two days later,
p12
aVit would end up on my front door,
p13
aVwhich was way better than having to fight the traffic
p14
aVof Hollywood. (Music)
p15
aVI didn't have much money,
p16
aVbut I had time and a sense of wonder. (Music)
p17
aa(lp18
VSo I started shooting time-lapse photography.
p19
aVIt would take me a month to shoot a four-minute
p20
aVroll of film, because that's all I could afford.
p21
aa(lp22
VI've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously,
p23
aVnon-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
p24
aVfor over 30 years, and to see them move
p25
aVis a dance I'll never get tired of.
p26
aVTheir beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.
p27
aVIt also provides a third of the food we eat.
p28
aV(Music)
p29
aVBeauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival,
p30
aVbecause we protect what we fall in love with.
p31
aVIt opens our hearts, and makes us realize
p32
aVwe are a part of nature and we're not separate from it.
p33
aVWhen we see ourselves in nature, it also connects us
p34
aVto every one of us, because it's clear
p35
aVthat it's all connected in one.
p36
aa(lp37
VWhen people see my images, a lot of times they'll say,
p38
aV"Oh my God." Have you ever wondered what that meant?
p39
aVThe "oh" means it caught your attention,
p40
aVmakes you present, makes you mindful.
p41
aVThe "my" means it connects with something deep
p42
aVinside your soul.
p43
aVIt creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up
p44
aVand be heard. And "God"?
p45
aVGod is that personal journey we all want to be on,
p46
aVto be inspired, to feel like we're connected to a universe
p47
aVthat celebrates life.
p48
aa(lp49
VDid you know that 80 percent
p50
aVof the information we receive comes through our eyes?
p51
aVAnd if you compare light energy to musical scales,
p52
aVit would only be one octave that the naked eye could see,
p53
aVwhich is right in the middle?
p54
aVAnd aren't we grateful for our brains that can, you know,
p55
aVtake this electrical impulse that comes from light energy
p56
aVto create images in order for us to explore our world?
p57
aVAnd aren't we grateful that we have hearts
p58
aVthat can feel these vibrations
p59
aVin order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure
p60
aVand the beauty of nature?
p61
aV(Music)
p62
aa(lp63
VNature's beauty is a gift that cultivates
p64
aVappreciation and gratitude.
p65
aV(Music)
p66
aVSo I have a gift I want to share with you today,
p67
aVa project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed,
p68
aVand it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective
p69
aVfrom the point of view of a child and an elderly man
p70
aVof that world.
p71
aa(lp72
VChild: When I watch TV,
p73
aVit's just some shows that you just \u2014 that are pretend,
p74
aVand when you explore, you get
p75
aVmore imagination than you already had,
p76
aVand when you get more imagination,
p77
aVit makes you want to go deeper in
p78
aVso you can get more and see beautifuller things,
p79
aVlike the path, if it's a path, it could lead you to a beach,
p80
aVor something, and it could be beautiful.
p81
aV(Music)
p82
aa(lp83
VElderly Man: You think this is just another day in your life?
p84
aVIt's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you
p85
aVtoday.
p86
aVIt's given to you. It's a gift.
p87
aVIt's the only gift that you have right now,
p88
aVand the only appropriate response
p89
aVis gratefulness.
p90
aVIf you do nothing else but to cultivate that response
p91
aVto the great gift that this unique day is,
p92
aVif you learn to respond
p93
aVas if it were the first day in your life
p94
aVand the very last day,
p95
aVthen you will have spent this day very well.
p96
aa(lp97
VBegin by opening your eyes and be surprised
p98
aVthat you have eyes you can open,
p99
aVthat incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us
p100
aVfor pure enjoyment.
p101
aVLook at the sky.
p102
aVWe so rarely look at the sky.
p103
aVWe so rarely note how different it is
p104
aVfrom moment to moment, with clouds coming and going.
p105
aVWe just think of the weather,
p106
aVand even with the weather, we don't think of
p107
aVall the many nuances of weather.
p108
aVWe just think of good weather and bad weather.
p109
aVThis day, right now, has unique weather,
p110
aVmaybe a kind that will never exactly
p111
aVin that form come again.
p112
aVThat formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same
p113
aVas it is right now.
p114
aVOpen your eyes. Look at that.
p115
aa(lp116
VLook at the faces of people whom you meet.
p117
aVEach one has an incredible story behind their face,
p118
aVa story that you could never fully fathom,
p119
aVnot only their own story, but the story of their ancestors.
p120
aVWe all go back so far,
p121
aVand in this present moment, on this day,
p122
aVall the people you meet, all that life from generations
p123
aVand from so many places all over the world
p124
aVflows together and meets you here
p125
aVlike a life-giving water, if you only open your heart and drink.
p126
aV(Music)
p127
aa(lp128
VOpen your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization
p129
aVgives to us.
p130
aVYou flip a switch and there is electric light.
p131
aVYou turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water,
p132
aVand drinkable water.
p133
aVIt's a gift that millions and millions in the world
p134
aVwill never experience.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts
p137
aVto which we can open your heart.
p138
aVAnd so I wish you that you will open your heart
p139
aVto all these blessings, and let them flow through you,
p140
aVthat everyone whom you will meet on this day
p141
aVwill be blessed by you,
p142
aVjust by your eyes,
p143
aVby your smile,
p144
aVby your touch,
p145
aVjust by your presence.
p146
aVLet the gratefulness overflow
p147
aVinto blessing all around you,
p148
aVand then it will really be a good day. (Music)

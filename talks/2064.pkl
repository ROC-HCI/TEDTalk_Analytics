VI would like to share with you today
p5
aVa project that has changed how I approach
p6
aVand practice architecture:
p7
aVthe Fez River Rehabilitation Project.
p8
aa(lp9
VMy hometown of Fez, Morocco,
p10
aVboasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world,
p11
aVcalled the medina, nestled in a river valley.
p12
aVThe entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
p13
aVSince the 1950s, as the population of the medina grew,
p14
aVbasic urban infrastructure
p15
aVsuch as green open spaces and sewage
p16
aVquickly changed and got highly stressed.
p17
aVOne of the biggest casualties of the situation
p18
aVwas the Fez River, which bisects the medina in its middle
p19
aVand has been considered for many centuries
p20
aVas the city's very soul.
p21
aVIn fact, one can witness the presence
p22
aVof the river's extensive water network
p23
aVall throughout the city,
p24
aVin places such as private and public fountains.
p25
aa(lp26
VUnfortunately, because of the pollution of the river,
p27
aVit has been covered little by little
p28
aVby concrete slabs since 1952.
p29
aVThis process of erasure was coupled
p30
aVwith the destruction of many houses
p31
aValong the river banks
p32
aVto be able to make machineries
p33
aVenter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina.
p34
aVThose urban voids quickly became illegal parking
p35
aVor trash yards.
p36
aVActually, the state of the river
p37
aVbefore entering the medina is pretty healthy.
p38
aVThen pollution takes its toll,
p39
aVmainly due to untreated sewage
p40
aVand chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning.
p41
aVAt some point, I couldn't bear
p42
aVthe desecration of the river,
p43
aVsuch an important part of my city,
p44
aVand I decided to take action,
p45
aVespecially after I heard that the city
p46
aVreceived a grant to divert sewage water
p47
aVand to treat it.
p48
aa(lp49
VWith clean water, suddenly
p50
aVthe uncovering of the river became possible,
p51
aVand with luck and actually a lot of pushing,
p52
aVmy partner Takako Tajima and I
p53
aVwere commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers
p54
aVto uncover the river.
p55
aVHowever, we were sneaky,
p56
aVand we proposed more:
p57
aVto convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways,
p58
aVand then to connect these pathways
p59
aVback to the city fabric,
p60
aVand finally to convert the urban voids
p61
aValong the riverbanks into public spaces
p62
aVthat are lacking in the Medina of Fez.
p63
aVI will show you briefly now
p64
aVtwo of these public spaces.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe first one is the Rcif Plaza,
p67
aVwhich sits actually right on top of the river,
p68
aVwhich you can see here in dotted lines.
p69
aVThis plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub
p70
aVthat actually compromised the urban integrity
p71
aVof the medina, that has the largest
p72
aVpedestrian network in the world.
p73
aVAnd right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here,
p74
aVright next to the plaza,
p75
aVyou can see that the river looked like
p76
aVa river of trash.
p77
aVInstead, what we proposed is to make
p78
aVthe plaza entirely pedestrian,
p79
aVto cover it with recycled leather canopies,
p80
aVand to connect it to the banks of the river.
p81
aa(lp82
VThe second site of intervention
p83
aVis also an urban void along the river banks,
p84
aVand it used to be an illegal parking,
p85
aVand we proposed to transform it
p86
aVinto the first playground in the medina.
p87
aVThe playground is constructed using recycled tires
p88
aVand also is coupled with a constructed wetland
p89
aVthat not only cleans the water of the river
p90
aVbut also retains it when floods occur.
p91
aa(lp92
VAs the project progressed and received several design awards,
p93
aVnew stakeholders intervened
p94
aVand changed the project goals and design.
p95
aVThe only way for us to be able to bring
p96
aVthe main goals of the project ahead
p97
aVwas for us to do something very unusual
p98
aVthat usually architects don't do.
p99
aVIt was for us to take our design ego
p100
aVand our sense of authorship
p101
aVand put it in the backseat
p102
aVand to focus mainly on being activists
p103
aVand on trying to coalesce
p104
aVall of the agendas of stakeholders
p105
aVand focus on the main goals of the project:
p106
aVthat is, to uncover the river, treat its water,
p107
aVand provide public spaces for all.
p108
aVWe were actually very lucky,
p109
aVand many of those goals happened
p110
aVor are in the process of happening.
p111
aVLike, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza.
p112
aVThis is how it looked like about six years ago.
p113
aVThis is how it looks like today.
p114
aVIt's still under construction,
p115
aVbut actually it is heavily used
p116
aVby the local population.
p117
aVAnd finally, this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like
p118
aVwhen the project is completed.
p119
aVThis is the river, covered, used as a trash yard.
p120
aVThen after many years of work,
p121
aVthe river with clean water, uncovered.
p122
aVAnd finally, you can see here the river
p123
aVwhen the project will be completed.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo for sure, the Fez River Rehabilitation
p126
aVwill keep on changing and adapting
p127
aVto the sociopolitical landscape of the city,
p128
aVbut we strongly believe that by reimagining
p129
aVthe role and the agency of the architect,
p130
aVwe have set up the core idea of the project into motion;
p131
aVthat is, to transform the river from sewage
p132
aVto public space for all,
p133
aVthereby making sure that the city of Fez
p134
aVwill remain a living city for its inhabitants
p135
aVrather than a mummified heritage.
p136
aa(lp137
VThank you very much.

architect Aziza Chaouni creates sustainable, built environments in the developing world, focusing on the deserts of the Middle East. Chaouni&rsquo;s design philosophy holds that it is not enough for sustainable buildings to have zero impact&mdash;they must give back to the community on social, economic, infrastructural and environmental levels too.&nbsp;The founding principal of Aziza Chaouni Projects, she&nbsp;collaborates closely with local communities and experts from other disciplines to integrate architecture, landscape and infrastructure in innovative ways.</p><p>Born and raised in Fez, Morocco, Chaouni has long found herself fascinated with the Fez River, which winds through the city&#39;s ancient Medina. Once considered the city&#39;s soul, sending water to both public and private fountains, in the 1950s, the stream started to become a toxic sewer because of overcrowding, over-development and pollution. The city responded by covering the river over with concrete slabs, bit by bit, in the process destroying houses and creating dumping grounds. When Fez received a grant to divert and clean the river&#39;s water, Chaouni proposed the Fez River Project to uncover the river, restore its riverbanks and create pedestrian pathways. Her vision: to reclaim these areas as public spaces and reconnect them to the rest of the city.</p><p>A project that Chaouni has been working on for two decades, her mission to transform the Fez River began with her thesis in graduate school and has continued throughout her career. Over the course of years, the river is gradually being uncovered&mdash;illegal parking lots are being transformed into playgrounds, trees and vegetation are being planted to create public spaces. Overall, the project is revitalizing Fez as a living city.</p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>       ", "slug": "aziza_chaouni", "whotheyare": "Aziza Chaouni focuses on projects that integrate architecture and landscape, and that ultimately give back to their communities.

VI'd like you to come back with me for a moment
p5
aVto the 19th century,
p6
aVspecifically to June 24, 1833.
p7
aVThe British Association for the Advancement of Science
p8
aVis holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge.
p9
aVIt's the first night of the meeting,
p10
aVand a confrontation is about to take place
p11
aVthat will change science forever.
p12
aa(lp13
VAn elderly, white-haired man stands up.
p14
aVThe members of the Association are shocked to realize
p15
aVthat it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
p16
aVwho hadn't even left his house in years until that day.
p17
aVThey're even more shocked by what he says.
p18
aa(lp19
V"You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers."
p20
aa(lp21
VColeridge felt that true philosophers like himself
p22
aVpondered the cosmos from their armchairs.
p23
aVThey were not mucking around in the fossil pits
p24
aVor conducting messy experiments with electrical piles
p25
aVlike the members of the British Association.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly.
p28
aVA young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up
p29
aVand quieted the audience.
p30
aVHe politely agreed that an appropriate name
p31
aVfor the members of the association did not exist.
p32
aa(lp33
V"If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term,"
p34
aVhe said, "then, by analogy with 'artist,'
p35
aVwe may form 'scientist.'"
p36
aVThis was the first time the word scientist
p37
aVwas uttered in public,
p38
aVonly 179 years ago.
p39
aa(lp40
VI first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school,
p41
aVand it kind of blew me away.
p42
aVI mean, how could the word scientist
p43
aVnot have existed until 1833?
p44
aVWhat were scientists called before?
p45
aVWhat had changed to make a new name necessary
p46
aVprecisely at that moment?
p47
aVPrior to this meeting, those who studied the natural world
p48
aVwere talented amateurs.
p49
aVThink of the country clergyman or squire
p50
aVcollecting his beetles or fossils,
p51
aVlike Charles Darwin, for example,
p52
aVor, the hired help of a nobleman, like Joseph Priestley,
p53
aVwho was the literary companion
p54
aVto the Marquis of Lansdowne
p55
aVwhen he discovered oxygen.
p56
aVAfter this, they were scientists,
p57
aVprofessionals with a particular scientific method,
p58
aVgoals, societies and funding.
p59
aa(lp60
VMuch of this revolution can be traced to four men
p61
aVwho met at Cambridge University in 1812:
p62
aVCharles Babbage, John Herschel, Richard Jones and William Whewell.
p63
aVThese were brilliant, driven men
p64
aVwho accomplished amazing things.
p65
aVCharles Babbage, I think known to most TEDsters,
p66
aVinvented the first mechanical calculator
p67
aVand the first prototype of a modern computer.
p68
aVJohn Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere,
p69
aVand, in his spare time, co-invented photography.
p70
aVI'm sure we could all be that productive
p71
aVwithout Facebook or Twitter to take up our time.
p72
aVRichard Jones became an important economist
p73
aVwho later influenced Karl Marx.
p74
aVAnd Whewell not only coined the term scientist,
p75
aVas well as the words anode, cathode and ion,
p76
aVbut spearheaded international big science
p77
aVwith his global research on the tides.
p78
aVIn the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813,
p79
aVthe four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts.
p80
aVThey talked about science
p81
aVand the need for a new scientific revolution.
p82
aVThey felt science had stagnated
p83
aVsince the days of the scientific revolution that had happened
p84
aVin the 17th century.
p85
aVIt was time for a new revolution,
p86
aVwhich they pledged to bring about,
p87
aVand what's so amazing about these guys is,
p88
aVnot only did they have these
p89
aVgrandiose undergraduate dreams,
p90
aVbut they actually carried them out,
p91
aVeven beyond their wildest dreams.
p92
aVAnd I'm going to tell you today
p93
aVabout four major changes to science these men made.
p94
aa(lp95
VAbout 200 years before,
p96
aVFrancis Bacon and then, later, Isaac Newton,
p97
aVhad proposed an inductive scientific method.
p98
aVNow that's a method that starts from
p99
aVobservations and experiments
p100
aVand moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws,
p101
aVwhich are always subject to revision or rejection
p102
aVshould new evidence arise.
p103
aVHowever, in 1809, David Ricardo muddied the waters
p104
aVby arguing that the science of economics
p105
aVshould use a different, deductive method.
p106
aVThe problem was that an influential group at Oxford
p107
aVbegan arguing that because it worked so well in economics,
p108
aVthis deductive method ought to be applied
p109
aVto the natural sciences too.
p110
aVThe members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed.
p111
aVThey wrote books and articles promoting inductive method
p112
aVin all the sciences
p113
aVthat were widely read by natural philosophers,
p114
aVuniversity students and members of the public.
p115
aVReading one of Herschel's books
p116
aVwas such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin
p117
aVthat he would later say, "Scarcely anything in my life
p118
aVmade so deep an impression on me.
p119
aVIt made me wish to add my might
p120
aVto the accumulated store of natural knowledge."
p121
aVIt also shaped Darwin's scientific method,
p122
aVas well as that used by his peers.
p123
aV[Science for the public good]
p124
aa(lp125
VPreviously, it was believed that scientific knowledge
p126
aVought to be used for the good of the king or queen,
p127
aVor for one's own personal gain.
p128
aVFor example, ship captains needed to know
p129
aVinformation about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.
p130
aVHarbormasters would gather this knowledge
p131
aVand sell it to the ship captains.
p132
aVThe philosophical breakfast club changed that,
p133
aVworking together.
p134
aVWhewell's worldwide study of the tides
p135
aVresulted in public tide tables and tidal maps
p136
aVthat freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge
p137
aVto all ship captains.
p138
aVHerschel helped by making tidal observations
p139
aVoff the coast of South Africa,
p140
aVand, as he complained to Whewell,
p141
aVhe was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble.
p142
aVThe four men really helped each other in every way.
p143
aVThey also relentlessly lobbied the British government
p144
aVfor the money to build Babbage's engines
p145
aVbecause they believed these engines
p146
aVwould have a huge practical impact on society.
p147
aVIn the days before pocket calculators,
p148
aVthe numbers that most professionals needed \u2014
p149
aVbankers, insurance agents, ship captains, engineers \u2014
p150
aVwere to be found in lookup books like this,
p151
aVfilled with tables of figures.
p152
aVThese tables were calculated
p153
aVusing a fixed procedure over and over
p154
aVby part-time workers known as \u2014 and this is amazing \u2014 computers,
p155
aVbut these calculations were really difficult.
p156
aVI mean, this nautical almanac
p157
aVpublished the lunar differences for every month of the year.
p158
aVEach month required 1,365 calculations,
p159
aVso these tables were filled with mistakes.
p160
aVBabbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator
p161
aVdevised to accurately compute any of these tables.
p162
aVTwo models of his engine were built in the last 20 years
p163
aVby a team from the Science Museum of London
p164
aVusing his own plans.
p165
aVThis is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California,
p166
aVand it calculates accurately. It actually works.
p167
aVLater, Babbage's analytical engine
p168
aVwas the first mechanical computer in the modern sense.
p169
aVIt had a separate memory and central processor.
p170
aVIt was capable of iteration, conditional branching
p171
aVand parallel processing,
p172
aVand it was programmable using punched cards,
p173
aVan idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom.
p174
aVTragically, Babbage's engines never were built in his day
p175
aVbecause most people thought that
p176
aVnon-human computers would have no usefulness
p177
aVfor the public.
p178
aV[New scientific institutions]
p179
aa(lp180
VFounded in Bacon's time, the Royal Society of London
p181
aVwas the foremost scientific society in England
p182
aVand even in the rest of the world.
p183
aVBy the 19th century, it had become
p184
aVa kind of gentleman's club
p185
aVpopulated mainly by antiquarians, literary men and the nobility.
p186
aVThe members of the philosophical breakfast club
p187
aVhelped form a number of new scientific societies,
p188
aVincluding the British Association.
p189
aVThese new societies required
p190
aVthat members be active researchers publishing their results.
p191
aVThey reinstated the tradition of the Q&A
p192
aVafter scientific papers were read,
p193
aVwhich had been discontinued by the Royal Society
p194
aVas being ungentlemanly.
p195
aVAnd for the first time, they gave women a foot in the door of science.
p196
aVMembers were encouraged to bring their wives,
p197
aVdaughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association,
p198
aVand while the women were expected to attend
p199
aVonly the public lectures and the social events like this one,
p200
aVthey began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well.
p201
aVThe British Association would later be the first
p202
aVof the major national science organizations in the world
p203
aVto admit women as full members.
p204
aV[External funding for science]
p205
aa(lp206
VUp to the 19th century,
p207
aVnatural philosophers were expected to pay
p208
aVfor their own equipment and supplies.
p209
aVOccasionally, there were prizes,
p210
aVsuch as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century,
p211
aVfor solving the so-called longitude problem,
p212
aVbut prizes were only given after the fact,
p213
aVwhen they were given at all.
p214
aVOn the advice of the philosophical breakfast club,
p215
aVthe British Association began to use the extra money
p216
aVgenerated by its meetings to give grants
p217
aVfor research in astronomy, the tides, fossil fish,
p218
aVshipbuilding, and many other areas.
p219
aVThese grants not only allowed
p220
aVless wealthy men to conduct research,
p221
aVbut they also encouraged thinking outside the box,
p222
aVrather than just trying to solve one pre-set question.
p223
aVEventually, the Royal Society
p224
aVand the scientific societies of other countries followed suit,
p225
aVand this has become \u2014 fortunately it's become \u2014
p226
aVa major part of the scientific landscape today.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo the philosophical breakfast club
p229
aVhelped invent the modern scientist.
p230
aVThat's the heroic part of their story.
p231
aVThere's a flip side as well.
p232
aVThey did not foresee at least one consequence
p233
aVof their revolution.
p234
aVThey would have been deeply dismayed
p235
aVby today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture.
p236
aVIt's shocking to realize
p237
aVthat only 28 percent of American adults
p238
aVhave even a very basic level of science literacy,
p239
aVand this was tested by asking simple questions like,
p240
aV"Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time?"
p241
aVand "What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?"
p242
aVOnce scientists became members of a professional group,
p243
aVthey were slowly walled off from the rest of us.
p244
aVThis is the unintended consequence of the revolution
p245
aVthat started with our four friends.
p246
aa(lp247
VCharles Darwin said,
p248
aV"I sometimes think that general and popular treatises
p249
aVare almost as important for the progress of science
p250
aVas original work."
p251
aVIn fact, "Origin of Species" was written
p252
aVfor a general and popular audience,
p253
aVand was widely read when it first appeared.
p254
aVDarwin knew what we seem to have forgotten,
p255
aVthat science is not only for scientists.
p256
aa(lp257
VThank you.

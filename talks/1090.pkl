VKhan Academy is most known for its collection of videos,
p5
aVso before I go any further,
p6
aVlet me show you a little bit of a montage.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse is now going to be five.
p9
aVThis animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America \u2014
p10
aVa nice clean band here \u2014
p11
aVand this part of Africa.
p12
aVWe can integrate over the surface,
p13
aVand the notation usually is a capital sigma.
p14
aVNational Assembly: They create the Committee of Public Safety,
p15
aVwhich sounds like a very nice committee.
p16
aVNotice, this is an aldehyde, and it's an alcohol.
p17
aVStart differentiating into effector and memory cells.
p18
aVA galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy. Oh, look! There's another galaxy.
p19
aVAnd for dollars, is their 30 million,
p20
aVplus the 20 million dollars from the American manufacturer.
p21
aVIf this does not blow your mind,
p22
aVthen you have no emotion.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
V(Applause)
p27
aa(lp28
V(Live) SK: We now have on the order of 2,200 videos,
p29
aVcovering everything from basic arithmetic, all the way to vector calculus,
p30
aVand some of the stuff that you saw up there.
p31
aVWe have a million students a month using the site,
p32
aVwatching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day.
p33
aVBut what we're going to talk about in this is how we're going to the next level.
p34
aVBut before I do that,
p35
aVI want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started.
p36
aVAnd some of you all might know,
p37
aVabout five years ago, I was an analyst at a hedge fund,
p38
aVand I was in Boston,
p39
aVand I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans, remotely.
p40
aVAnd I started putting the first YouTube videos up,
p41
aVreally just as a kind of nice-to-have,
p42
aVjust kind of a supplement for my cousins,
p43
aVsomething that might give them a refresher or something.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up,
p46
aVsomething interesting happened.
p47
aVActually, a bunch of interesting things happened.
p48
aVThe first was the feedback from my cousins.
p49
aVThey told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd once you get over the backhanded nature of that,
p54
aVthere was actually something very profound there.
p55
aVThey were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin
p56
aVto their cousin.
p57
aVAt first it's very unintuitive,
p58
aVbut when you think about it from their point of view, it makes a ton of sense.
p59
aVYou have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin,
p60
aVwithout feeling like they're wasting my time.
p61
aVIf they have to review something
p62
aVthat they should have learned a couple of weeks ago,
p63
aVor maybe a couple of years ago,
p64
aVthey don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin.
p65
aVThey can just watch those videos; if they're bored, they can go ahead.
p66
aVThey can watch at their own time and pace.
p67
aVProbably the least-appreciated aspect of this
p68
aVis the notion that the very first time
p69
aVthat you're trying to get your brain around a new concept,
p70
aVthe very last thing you need
p71
aVis another human being saying, "Do you understand this?"
p72
aVAnd that's what was happening
p73
aVwith the interaction with my cousins before,
p74
aVand now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room.
p75
aa(lp76
VThe other thing that happened is \u2014
p77
aVI put them on YouTube just \u2014
p78
aVI saw no reason to make it private,
p79
aVso I let other people watch it,
p80
aVand then people started stumbling on it,
p81
aVand I started getting some comments and some letters
p82
aVand all sorts of feedback
p83
aVfrom random people around the world.
p84
aVThese are just a few.
p85
aVThis is actually from one of the original calculus videos.
p86
aVSomeone wrote it on YouTube, it was a YouTube comment:
p87
aV"First time I smiled doing a derivative."
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VLet's pause here.
p92
aVThis person did a derivative,
p93
aVand then they smiled.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VIn response to that same comment \u2014
p98
aVthis is on the thread, you can go on YouTube and look at the comments \u2014
p99
aVsomeone else wrote: "Same thing here.
p100
aVI actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day,
p101
aVsince I remember seeing all of this matrix text in class,
p102
aVand here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'"
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VWe get a lot of feedback along those lines.
p107
aVThis clearly was helping people.
p108
aVBut then, as the viewership kept growing and kept growing,
p109
aVI started getting letters from people,
p110
aVand it was starting to become clear
p111
aVthat it was more than just a nice-to-have.
p112
aVThis is just an excerpt from one of those letters:
p113
aV"My 12 year-old son has autism,
p114
aVand has had a terrible time with math.
p115
aVWe have tried everything,
p116
aVviewed everything, bought everything.
p117
aVWe stumbled on your video on decimals, and it got through.
p118
aVThen we went on to the dreaded fractions.
p119
aVAgain, he got it.
p120
aVWe could not believe it.
p121
aVHe is so excited."
p122
aVAnd so you can imagine,
p123
aVhere I was, an analyst at a hedge fund \u2014
p124
aVit was very strange for me to do something of social value.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aa(lp130
VBut I was excited, so I kept going.
p131
aVAnd then a few other things started to dawn on me;
p132
aVthat not only would it help my cousins right now,
p133
aVor these people who were sending letters,
p134
aVbut that this content will never grow old,
p135
aVthat it could help their kids or their grandkids.
p136
aVIf Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus,
p137
aVI wouldn't have to.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VAssuming he was good. We don't know.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VThe other thing that happened \u2014 and even at this point, I said,
p146
aV"OK, maybe it's a good supplement. It's good for motivated students.
p147
aVIt's good for maybe home-schoolers."
p148
aVBut I didn't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom.
p149
aVThen I started getting letters from teachers,
p150
aVand the teachers would write, saying,
p151
aV"We've used your videos to flip the classroom.
p152
aVYou've given the lectures, so now what we do \u2014"
p153
aVAnd this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow \u2014
p154
aV"what I do is I assign the lectures for homework,
p155
aVand what used to be homework,
p156
aVI now have the students doing in the classroom."
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd I want to pause here \u2014
p159
aa(lp160
V(Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VI want to pause here, because there's a couple of interesting things.
p163
aVOne, when those teachers are doing that,
p164
aVthere's the obvious benefit \u2014
p165
aVthe benefit that now their students
p166
aVcan enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did,
p167
aVthey can pause, repeat at their own pace, at their own time.
p168
aVBut the more interesting thing \u2014 and this is the unintuitive thing
p169
aVwhen you talk about technology in the classroom \u2014
p170
aVby removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom,
p171
aVand letting students have a self-paced lecture at home,
p172
aVthen when you go to the classroom,
p173
aVletting them do work, having the teacher walk around,
p174
aVhaving the peers actually be able to interact with each other,
p175
aVthese teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom.
p176
aVThey took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience \u2014
p177
aV30 kids with their fingers on their lips,
p178
aVnot allowed to interact with each other.
p179
aVA teacher, no matter how good,
p180
aVhas to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students \u2014
p181
aVblank faces, slightly antagonistic \u2014
p182
aVand now it's a human experience,
p183
aVnow they're actually interacting with each other.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo once the Khan Academy \u2014
p186
aVI quit my job,
p187
aVand we turned into a real organization \u2014
p188
aVwe're a not-for-profit \u2014
p189
aVthe question is, how do we take this to the next level?
p190
aVHow do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion?
p191
aVAnd so, what I'm showing over here,
p192
aVthese are actual exercises
p193
aVthat I started writing for my cousins.
p194
aVThe ones I started were much more primitive.
p195
aVThis is a more competent version of it.
p196
aVBut the paradigm here is, we'll generate as many questions as you need,
p197
aVuntil you get that concept, until you get 10 in a row.
p198
aVAnd the Khan Academy videos are there.
p199
aVYou get hints, the actual steps for that problem,
p200
aVif you don't know how to do it.
p201
aVThe paradigm here seems like a very simple thing:
p202
aV10 in a row, you move on.
p203
aVBut it's fundamentally different
p204
aVthan what's happening in classrooms right now.
p205
aa(lp206
VIn a traditional classroom,
p207
aVyou have homework, lecture, homework, lecture,
p208
aVand then you have a snapshot exam.
p209
aVAnd that exam, whether you get a 70 percent, an 80 percent,
p210
aVa 90 percent or a 95 percent,
p211
aVthe class moves on to the next topic.
p212
aVAnd even that 95 percent student \u2014
p213
aVwhat was the five percent they didn't know?
p214
aVMaybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zeroth power.
p215
aVThen you build on that in the next concept.
p216
aVThat's analogous to \u2014 imagine learning to ride a bicycle.
p217
aVMaybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,
p218
aVand I give you a bicycle for two weeks, then I come back after two weeks,
p219
aVand say, "Well, let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns.
p220
aVYou can't quite stop. You're an 80 percent bicyclist."
p221
aVSo I put a big "C" stamp on your forehead \u2014
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
Vand then I say, "Here's a unicycle."
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VBut as ridiculous as that sounds,
p230
aVthat's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now.
p231
aVAnd the idea is you fast forward
p232
aVand good students start failing algebra all of the sudden,
p233
aVand start failing calculus all of the sudden,
p234
aVdespite being smart, despite having good teachers,
p235
aVand it's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps
p236
aVthat kept building throughout their foundation.
p237
aVSo our model is: learn math the way you'd learn anything,
p238
aVlike riding a bicycle.
p239
aVStay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle.
p240
aVDo it as long as necessary, until you have mastery.
p241
aVThe traditional model,
p242
aVit penalizes you for experimentation and failure,
p243
aVbut it does not expect mastery.
p244
aVWe encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to fail.
p245
aVBut we do expect mastery.
p246
aa(lp247
VThis is just another one of the modules.
p248
aVThis is trigonometry.
p249
aVThis is shifting and reflecting functions.
p250
aVAnd they all fit together.
p251
aVWe have about 90 of these right now.
p252
aVYou can go to the site right now,
p253
aVit's all free, not trying to sell anything.
p254
aVBut the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map.
p255
aVThat top node right there, that's literally single-digit addition,
p256
aVit's like one plus one is equal to two.
p257
aVThe paradigm is, once you get 10 in a row on that,
p258
aVit keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules.
p259
aa(lp260
VFurther down the knowledge map,
p261
aVwe're getting into more advanced arithmetic.
p262
aVFurther down, you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra.
p263
aVFurther down, you start getting into algebra one, algebra two,
p264
aVa little bit of precalculus.
p265
aVAnd the idea is, from this we can actually teach everything \u2014
p266
aVwell, everything that can be taught in this type of a framework.
p267
aVSo you can imagine \u2014 and this is what we are working on \u2014
p268
aVfrom this knowledge map, you have logic, you have computer programming,
p269
aVyou have grammar, you have genetics,
p270
aVall based off of that core of, if you know this and that,
p271
aVnow you're ready for this next concept.
p272
aVNow that can work well for an individual learner,
p273
aVand I encourage you to do it with your kids,
p274
aVbut I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself.
p275
aVIt'll change what happens at the dinner table.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut what we want to do
p278
aVis use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom
p279
aVthat those early teachers had emailed me about.
p280
aVAnd so what I'm showing you here,
p281
aVthis is data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district,
p282
aVwhere they took two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes,
p283
aVand completely gutted their old math curriculum.
p284
aVThese kids aren't using textbooks, or getting one-size-fits-all lectures.
p285
aVThey're doing Khan Academy, that software, for roughly half of their math class.
p286
aVI want to be clear: we don't view this as a complete math education.
p287
aVWhat it does is \u2014 this is what's happening in Los Altos \u2014
p288
aVit frees up time \u2014 it's the blocking and tackling,
p289
aVmaking sure you know how to move through a system of equations,
p290
aVand it frees up time for the simulations, for the games,
p291
aVfor the mechanics, for the robot-building,
p292
aVfor the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day,
p295
aVevery kid works at their own pace \u2014
p296
aVthis is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district \u2014
p297
aVand they look at this dashboard.
p298
aVEvery row is a student.
p299
aVEvery column is one of those concepts.
p300
aVGreen means the student's already proficient.
p301
aVBlue means they're working on it \u2014 no need to worry.
p302
aVRed means they're stuck.
p303
aVAnd what the teacher does is literally just say,
p304
aV"Let me intervene on the red kids."
p305
aVOr even better, "Let me get one of the green kids,
p306
aVwho are already proficient in that concept,
p307
aVto be the first line of attack, and actually tutor their peer."
p308
aa(lp309
V(Applause)
p310
aa(lp311
VNow, I come from a very data-centric reality,
p312
aVso we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene
p313
aVand have to ask the kid awkward questions:
p314
aV"What don't you understand? What do you understand?" and all the rest.
p315
aVSo our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible \u2014
p316
aVdata that, in any other field, is expected,
p317
aVin finance, marketing, manufacturing \u2014
p318
aVso the teachers can diagnose what's wrong with the students
p319
aVso they can make their interaction as productive as possible.
p320
aVNow teachers know exactly what the students have been up to,
p321
aVhow long they've spent each day, what videos they've watched,
p322
aVwhen did they pause the videos, what did they stop watching,
p323
aVwhat exercises are they using, what have they focused on?
p324
aVThe outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on.
p325
aVThe inner circle shows the videos they're focused on.
p326
aVThe data gets pretty granular,
p327
aVso you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong.
p328
aVRed is wrong, blue is right.
p329
aVThe leftmost question is the first one the student attempted.
p330
aVThey watched the video over there.
p331
aVAnd you can see, eventually they were able to get 10 in a row.
p332
aVIt's almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems.
p333
aVThey also got faster \u2014 the height is how long it took them.
p334
aa(lp335
VWhen you talk about self-paced learning, it makes sense for everyone \u2014
p336
aVin education-speak, "differentiated learning" \u2014
p337
aVbut it's kind of crazy, what happens when you see it in a classroom.
p338
aVBecause every time we've done this, in every classroom we've done,
p339
aVover and over again, if you go five days into it,
p340
aVthere's a group of kids who've raced ahead
p341
aVand a group who are a little bit slower.
p342
aVIn a traditional model, in a snapshot assessment,
p343
aVyou say, "These are the gifted kids, these are the slow kids.
p344
aVMaybe they should be tracked differently.
p345
aVMaybe we should put them in different classes."
p346
aVBut when you let students work at their own pace \u2014
p347
aVwe see it over and over again \u2014
p348
aVyou see students who took a little bit extra time
p349
aVon one concept or the other,
p350
aVbut once they get through that concept,
p351
aVthey just race ahead.
p352
aVAnd so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago,
p353
aVyou now would think are gifted.
p354
aVAnd we're seeing it over and over again.
p355
aVIt makes you really wonder
p356
aVhow much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from
p357
aVwere really just due to a coincidence of time.
p358
aa(lp359
VNow as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos,
p360
aVour goal is to use technology
p361
aVto humanize, not just in Los Altos, but on a global scale,
p362
aVwhat's happening in education.
p363
aVAnd that brings up an interesting point.
p364
aVA lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom
p365
aVis focused on student-to-teacher ratios.
p366
aVIn our mind, the relevant metric is:
p367
aVstudent-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio.
p368
aVSo in a traditional model, most of the teacher's time
p369
aVis spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot.
p370
aVMaybe five percent of their time is sitting next to students
p371
aVand working with them.
p372
aVNow, 100 percent of their time is.
p373
aVSo once again, using technology, not just flipping the classroom,
p374
aVyou're humanizing the classroom, I'd argue,
p375
aVby a factor of five or 10.
p376
aa(lp377
VAs valuable as that is in Los Altos,
p378
aVimagine what it does to the adult learner,
p379
aVwho's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff
p380
aVthey should have known before going back to college.
p381
aVImagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta,
p382
aVwho has to help his family during the day,
p383
aVand that's the reason he or she can't go to school.
p384
aVNow they can spend two hours a day and remediate,
p385
aVor get up to speed and not feel embarrassed
p386
aVabout what they do or don't know.
p387
aVNow imagine what happens where \u2014
p388
aVwe talked about the peers teaching each other
p389
aVinside of a classroom.
p390
aVBut this is all one system.
p391
aVThere's no reason why you can't have that peer-to-peer tutoring
p392
aVbeyond that one classroom.
p393
aVImagine what happens if that student in Calcutta
p394
aVall of the sudden can tutor your son,
p395
aVor your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta.
p396
aVAnd I think what you'll see emerging
p397
aVis this notion of a global one-world classroom.
p398
aVAnd that's essentially what we're trying to build.
p399
aa(lp400
VThank you.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Applause)
p403
aa(lp404
VBill Gates: I'll ask about two or three questions.
p405
aa(lp406
VSalman Khan: Oh, OK.
p407
aa(lp408
V(Applause continues)
p409
aa(lp410
V(Applause ends)
p411
aa(lp412
VBG: I've seen some things you're doing in the system,
p413
aVthat have to do with motivation and feedback \u2014
p414
aVenergy points, merit badges.
p415
aVTell me what you're thinking there.
p416
aa(lp417
VSK: Oh yeah. No, we have an awesome team working on it.
p418
aVI have to be clear, it's not just me anymore.
p419
aVI'm still doing all the videos,
p420
aVbut we have a rock-star team doing the software.
p421
aVWe've put a bunch of game mechanics in there, where you get badges,
p422
aVwe're going to start having leader boards by area, you get points.
p423
aVIt's actually been pretty interesting.
p424
aVJust the wording of the badging,
p425
aVor how many points you get for doing something,
p426
aVwe see on a system-wide basis,
p427
aVlike tens of thousands of fifth-graders or sixth-graders
p428
aVgoing one direction or another, depending what badge you give them.
p429
aa(lp430
V(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VBG: And the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos,
p433
aVhow did that come about?
p434
aa(lp435
VSK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.
p436
aVOnce again, I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms.
p437
aVSomeone from their board came and said,
p438
aV"What would you do if you had carte Blanche in a classroom?"
p439
aVI said, "Well, every student would work at their own pace,
p440
aVon something like this, we'd give a dashboard."
p441
aVThey said, "This is kind of radical. We have to think about it."
p442
aVMe and the rest of the team were like, "They're never going to want to do this."
p443
aVBut literally the next day they were like, "Can you start in two weeks?"
p444
aa(lp445
V(Laughter)
p446
aa(lp447
VBG: So fifth-grade math is where that's going on right now?
p448
aa(lp449
VSK: It's two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes.
p450
aVThey're doing it at the district level.
p451
aVI think what they're excited about is they can follow these kids,
p452
aVnot only in school; on Christmas, we saw some of the kids were doing it.
p453
aVWe can track everything, track them as they go through the entire district.
p454
aVThrough the summers, as they go from one teacher to the next,
p455
aVyou have this continuity of data that even at the district level, they can see.
p456
aa(lp457
VBG: So some of those views we saw were for the teacher
p458
aVto go in and track actually what's going on with those kids.
p459
aVSo you're getting feedback on those teacher views
p460
aVto see what they think they need?
p461
aa(lp462
VSK: Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers.
p463
aVWe made some of those for students so they could see their data,
p464
aVbut we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves.
p465
aVAnd they're saying, "Hey, this is nice, but \u2014"
p466
aVLike that focus graph, a lot of the teachers said,
p467
aV"I have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around
p468
aVand not focusing on one topic."
p469
aVSo we made that focus diagram.
p470
aVSo it's all been teacher-driven. It's been pretty crazy.
p471
aa(lp472
VBG: Is this ready for prime time?
p473
aVDo you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out?
p474
aa(lp475
VSK: Yeah, it's ready.
p476
aVWe've got a million people on the site already,
p477
aVso we can handle a few more.
p478
aa(lp479
V(Laughter)
p480
aa(lp481
VNo, no reason why it really can't happen
p482
aVin every classroom in America tomorrow.
p483
aa(lp484
VBG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.
p485
aVThe idea there is, if I'm confused about a topic,
p486
aVsomehow right in the user interface,
p487
aVI'd find people who are volunteering,
p488
aVmaybe see their reputation,
p489
aVand I could schedule and connect up with those people?
p490
aa(lp491
VSK: Absolutely. And this is something I recommend everyone in this audience do.
p492
aVThose dashboards the teachers have, you can go log in right now
p493
aVand you can essentially become a coach
p494
aVfor your kids, your nephews, your cousins,
p495
aVor maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club.
p496
aVAnd yeah, you can start becoming a mentor, a tutor,
p497
aVreally immediately.
p498
aVBut yeah, it's all there.
p499
aa(lp500
VBG: Well, it's amazing.
p501
aVI think you just got a glimpse of the future of education.
p502
aa(lp503
VBG: Thank you. SK: Thank you.

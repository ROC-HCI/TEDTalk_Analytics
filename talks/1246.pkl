(lp4
VOkay, now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room,
p5
aVbut it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAlso, the person to your left is a liar.
p10
aVAlso the person sitting in your very seats is a liar.
p11
aVWe're all liars.
p12
aVWhat I'm going to do today
p13
aVis I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars,
p14
aVhow you can become a liespotter
p15
aVand why you might want to go the extra mile
p16
aVand go from liespotting to truth seeking,
p17
aVand ultimately to trust building.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, speaking of trust,
p20
aVever since I wrote this book, "Liespotting,"
p21
aVno one wants to meet me in person anymore, no, no, no, no, no.
p22
aVThey say, "It's okay, we'll email you."
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VI can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks.
p27
aVMy husband's like, "Honey, deception?
p28
aVMaybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking?"
p29
aa(lp30
VSo before I get started, what I'm going to do
p31
aVis I'm going to clarify my goal for you,
p32
aVwhich is not to teach a game of Gotcha.
p33
aVLiespotters aren't those nitpicky kids,
p34
aVthose kids in the back of the room that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha!
p35
aVYour eyebrow twitched. You flared your nostril.
p36
aVI watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.' I know you're lying."
p37
aVNo, liespotters are armed
p38
aVwith scientific knowledge of how to spot deception.
p39
aVThey use it to get to the truth,
p40
aVand they do what mature leaders do everyday;
p41
aVthey have difficult conversations with difficult people,
p42
aVsometimes during very difficult times.
p43
aVAnd they start up that path by accepting a core proposition,
p44
aVand that proposition is the following:
p45
aVLying is a cooperative act.
p46
aVThink about it, a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance.
p47
aVIts power emerges
p48
aVwhen someone else agrees to believe the lie.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo I know it may sound like tough love,
p51
aVbut look, if at some point you got lied to,
p52
aVit's because you agreed to get lied to.
p53
aVTruth number one about lying: Lying's a cooperative act.
p54
aVNow not all lies are harmful.
p55
aVSometimes we're willing participants in deception
p56
aVfor the sake of social dignity,
p57
aVmaybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret, secret.
p58
aVWe say, "Nice song."
p59
aV"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."
p60
aVOr we say, favorite of the digiratti,
p61
aV"You know, I just fished that email out of my Spam folder.
p62
aVSo sorry."
p63
aa(lp64
VBut there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception.
p65
aVAnd that can have dramatic costs for us.
p66
aVLast year saw 997 billion dollars
p67
aVin corporate fraud alone in the United States.
p68
aVThat's an eyelash under a trillion dollars.
p69
aVThat's seven percent of revenues.
p70
aVDeception can cost billions.
p71
aVThink Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.
p72
aVOr in the case of double agents and traitors,
p73
aVlike Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames,
p74
aVlies can betray our country,
p75
aVthey can compromise our security, they can undermine democracy,
p76
aVthey can cause the deaths of those that defend us.
p77
aa(lp78
VDeception is actually serious business.
p79
aVThis con man, Henry Oberlander, he was such an effective con man,
p80
aVBritish authorities say
p81
aVhe could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world.
p82
aVAnd you can't find this guy on Google; you can't find him anywhere.
p83
aVHe was interviewed once, and he said the following.
p84
aVHe said, "Look, I've got one rule."
p85
aVAnd this was Henry's rule, he said,
p86
aV"Look, everyone is willing to give you something.
p87
aVThey're ready to give you something for whatever it is they're hungry for."
p88
aVAnd that's the crux of it.
p89
aVIf you don't want to be deceived, you have to know,
p90
aVwhat is it that you're hungry for?
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd we all kind of hate to admit it.
p93
aVWe wish we were better husbands, better wives,
p94
aVsmarter, more powerful, taller, richer \u2014
p95
aVthe list goes on.
p96
aVLying is an attempt to bridge that gap,
p97
aVto connect our wishes and our fantasies
p98
aVabout who we wish we were, how we wish we could be,
p99
aVwith what we're really like.
p100
aVAnd boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies.
p101
aa(lp102
VOn a given day, studies show that you may be lied to
p103
aVanywhere from 10 to 200 times.
p104
aVNow granted, many of those are white lies.
p105
aVBut in another study,
p106
aVit showed that strangers lied three times
p107
aVwithin the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VNow when we first hear this data, we recoil.
p112
aVWe can't believe how prevalent lying is.
p113
aVWe're essentially against lying.
p114
aVBut if you look more closely, the plot actually thickens.
p115
aVWe lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers.
p116
aVExtroverts lie more than introverts.
p117
aVMen lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people.
p118
aVWomen lie more to protect other people.
p119
aVIf you're an average married couple,
p120
aVyou're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions.
p121
aVNow, you may think that's bad.
p122
aVIf you're unmarried, that number drops to three.
p123
aa(lp124
VLying's complex.
p125
aVIt's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives.
p126
aVWe're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
p127
aVWe parse it out on an as-needed basis,
p128
aVsometimes for very good reasons,
p129
aVother times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives.
p130
aVThat's truth number two about lying.
p131
aVWe're against lying,
p132
aVbut we're covertly for it
p133
aVin ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries.
p134
aVIt's as old as breathing.
p135
aVIt's part of our culture, it's part of our history.
p136
aVThink Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VLying has evolutionary value to us as a species.
p141
aVResearchers have long known that the more intelligent the species,
p142
aVthe larger the neocortex,
p143
aVthe more likely it is to be deceptive.
p144
aVNow you might remember Koko.
p145
aVDoes anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language?
p146
aVKoko was taught to communicate via sign language.
p147
aVHere's Koko with her kitten.
p148
aVIt's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.
p149
aVKoko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VWe're hardwired to become leaders of the pack.
p154
aVIt's starts really, really early.
p155
aVHow early?
p156
aVWell babies will fake a cry,
p157
aVpause, wait to see who's coming
p158
aVand then go right back to crying.
p159
aVOne-year-olds learn concealment.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VTwo-year-olds bluff.
p164
aVFive-year-olds lie outright.
p165
aVThey manipulate via flattery.
p166
aVNine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up.
p167
aVBy the time you enter college,
p168
aVyou're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions.
p169
aVBy the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners,
p170
aVwe enter a world that is just cluttered with Spam, fake digital friends,
p171
aVpartisan media,
p172
aVingenious identity thieves,
p173
aVworld-class Ponzi schemers,
p174
aVa deception epidemic \u2014
p175
aVin short, what one author calls a post-truth society.
p176
aVIt's been very confusing for a long time now.
p177
aa(lp178
VWhat do you do?
p179
aVWell, there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass.
p180
aVTrained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time.
p181
aVThe rest of us, we're only 54 percent accurate.
p182
aVWhy is it so easy to learn?
p183
aVThere are good liars and bad liars.
p184
aVThere are no real original liars.
p185
aVWe all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques.
p186
aVSo what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you two patterns of deception.
p187
aVAnd then we're going to look at the hot spots
p188
aVand see if we can find them ourselves.
p189
aVWe're going to start with speech.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Video) Bill Clinton: I want you to listen to me.
p192
aVI'm going to say this again.
p193
aVI did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.
p194
aVI never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never.
p195
aVAnd these allegations are false.
p196
aVAnd I need to go back to work for the American people.
p197
aVThank you.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Applause)
p200
aa(lp201
VPamela Meyer: Okay, what were the telltale signs?
p202
aVWell first we heard what's known as a non-contracted denial.
p203
aVStudies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial
p204
aVwill resort to formal rather than informal language.
p205
aVWe also heard distancing language: "that woman."
p206
aVWe know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves
p207
aVfrom their subject,
p208
aVusing language as their tool.
p209
aVNow if Bill Clinton had said, "Well, to tell you the truth ..."
p210
aVor Richard Nixon's favorite, "In all candor ..."
p211
aVhe would have been a dead giveaway
p212
aVfor any liespotter that knows
p213
aVthat qualifying language, as it's called, qualifying language like that,
p214
aVfurther discredits the subject.
p215
aVNow if he had repeated the question in its entirety,
p216
aVor if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail \u2014
p217
aVand we're all really glad he didn't do that \u2014
p218
aVhe would have further discredited himself.
p219
aa(lp220
VFreud had it right.
p221
aVFreud said, look, there's much more to it than speech:
p222
aV"No mortal can keep a secret.
p223
aVIf his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips."
p224
aVAnd we all do it no matter how powerful you are.
p225
aVWe all chatter with our fingertips.
p226
aVI'm going to show you Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama
p227
aVwho's chattering with his fingertips.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VNow this brings us to our next pattern, which is body language.
p232
aVWith body language, here's what you've got to do.
p233
aVYou've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door.
p234
aVLet the science temper your knowledge a little bit.
p235
aVBecause we think liars fidget all the time.
p236
aVWell guess what, they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying.
p237
aVWe think liars won't look you in the eyes.
p238
aVWell guess what, they look you in the eyes a little too much
p239
aVjust to compensate for that myth.
p240
aVWe think warmth and smiles convey honesty, sincerity.
p241
aVBut a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away.
p242
aVCan you all spot the fake smile here?
p243
aVYou can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks.
p244
aVBut the real smile's in the eyes, the crow's feet of the eyes.
p245
aVThey cannot be consciously contracted,
p246
aVespecially if you overdid the Botox.
p247
aVDon't overdo the Botox; nobody will think you're honest.
p248
aa(lp249
VNow we're going to look at the hot spots.
p250
aVCan you tell what's happening in a conversation?
p251
aVCan you start to find the hot spots
p252
aVto see the discrepancies
p253
aVbetween someone's words and someone's actions?
p254
aVNow, I know it seems really obvious,
p255
aVbut when you're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception,
p256
aVattitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators.
p257
aa(lp258
VAn honest person is going to be cooperative.
p259
aVThey're going to show they're on your side.
p260
aVThey're going to be enthusiastic.
p261
aVThey're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth.
p262
aVThey're going to be willing to brainstorm, name suspects,
p263
aVprovide details.
p264
aVThey're going to say,
p265
aV"Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks."
p266
aVThey're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused
p267
aVthroughout the entire course of the interview, not just in flashes;
p268
aVthey'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview.
p269
aVAnd if you ask someone honest
p270
aVwhat should happen to whomever did forge those checks,
p271
aVan honest person is much more likely
p272
aVto recommend strict rather than lenient punishment.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow let's say you're having that exact same conversation
p275
aVwith someone deceptive.
p276
aVThat person may be withdrawn,
p277
aVlook down, lower their voice,
p278
aVpause, be kind of herky-jerky.
p279
aVAsk a deceptive person to tell their story,
p280
aVthey're going to pepper it with way too much detail
p281
aVin all kinds of irrelevant places.
p282
aVAnd then they're going to tell their story in strict chronological order.
p283
aVAnd what a trained interrogator does
p284
aVis they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours,
p285
aVthey will ask that person to tell that story backwards,
p286
aVand then they'll watch them squirm,
p287
aVand track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells.
p288
aa(lp289
VWhy do they do that? Well, we all do the same thing.
p290
aVWe rehearse our words,
p291
aVbut we rarely rehearse our gestures.
p292
aVWe say "yes," we shake our heads "no."
p293
aVWe tell very convincing stories, we slightly shrug our shoulders.
p294
aVWe commit terrible crimes,
p295
aVand we smile at the delight in getting away with it.
p296
aVNow, that smile is known in the trade as "duping delight."
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd we're going to see that in several videos moving forward,
p299
aVbut we're going to start \u2014 for those of you who don't know him,
p300
aVthis is presidential candidate John Edwards
p301
aVwho shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock.
p302
aVWe're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test.
p303
aVSee now if you can spot him saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no,"
p304
aVslightly shrugging his shoulders.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy to participate in one.
p307
aVI know that it's not possible that this child could be mine,
p308
aVbecause of the timing of events.
p309
aVSo I know it's not possible.
p310
aVHappy to take a paternity test, and would love to see it happen.
p311
aa(lp312
VInterviewer: Are you going to do that soon? Is there somebody \u2014
p313
aa(lp314
VJE: Well, I'm only one side. I'm only one side of the test.
p315
aVBut I'm happy to participate in one.
p316
aa(lp317
VPM: Okay, those head shakes are much easier to spot
p318
aVonce you know to look for them.
p319
aVThere are going to be times when someone makes one expression
p320
aVwhile masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash.
p321
aVMurderers are known to leak sadness.
p322
aVYour new joint venture partner might shake your hand,
p323
aVcelebrate, go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger.
p324
aVAnd we're not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here,
p325
aVbut there's one I can teach you that's very dangerous
p326
aVand it's easy to learn,
p327
aVand that's the expression of contempt.
p328
aVNow with anger, you've got two people on an even playing field.
p329
aVIt's still somewhat of a healthy relationship.
p330
aVBut when anger turns to contempt, you've been dismissed.
p331
aVIt's associated with moral superiority.
p332
aVAnd for that reason, it's very, very hard to recover from.
p333
aVHere's what it looks like.
p334
aVIt's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in.
p335
aVIt's the only asymmetrical expression.
p336
aVAnd in the presence of contempt, whether or not deception follows \u2014
p337
aVand it doesn't always follow \u2014
p338
aVlook the other way, go the other direction,
p339
aVreconsider the deal,
p340
aVsay, "No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you."
p341
aa(lp342
VScience has surfaced many, many more indicators.
p343
aVWe know, for example,
p344
aVwe know liars will shift their blink rate,
p345
aVpoint their feet towards an exit.
p346
aVThey will take barrier objects
p347
aVand put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them.
p348
aVThey'll alter their vocal tone,
p349
aVoften making their vocal tone much lower.
p350
aa(lp351
VNow here's the deal.
p352
aVThese behaviors are just behaviors.
p353
aVThey're not proof of deception.
p354
aVThey're red flags.
p355
aVWe're human beings.
p356
aVWe make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long.
p357
aVThey don't mean anything in and of themselves.
p358
aVBut when you see clusters of them, that's your signal.
p359
aVLook, listen, probe, ask some hard questions,
p360
aVget out of that very comfortable mode of knowing,
p361
aVwalk into curiosity mode, ask more questions,
p362
aVhave a little dignity, treat the person you're talking to with rapport.
p363
aVDon't try to be like those folks on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows
p364
aVthat pummel their subjects into submission.
p365
aVDon't be too aggressive, it doesn't work.
p366
aa(lp367
VNow, we've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who's lying
p368
aVand how to spot a lie.
p369
aVAnd as I promised, we're now going to look at what the truth looks like.
p370
aVBut I'm going to show you two videos,
p371
aVtwo mothers \u2014 one is lying, one is telling the truth.
p372
aVAnd these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California.
p373
aVAnd I think they're an excellent example of what the truth looks like.
p374
aa(lp375
VThis mother, Diane Downs,
p376
aVshot her kids at close range,
p377
aVdrove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car,
p378
aVclaimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.
p379
aVAnd you'll see when you see the video,
p380
aVshe can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother.
p381
aVWhat you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy
p382
aVbetween horrific events that she describes and her very, very cool demeanor.
p383
aVAnd if you look closely, you'll see duping delight throughout this video.
p384
aa(lp385
V(Video) Diane Downs: At night when I close my eyes,
p386
aVI can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving,
p387
aVand the blood just kept coming out of her mouth.
p388
aVAnd that \u2014 maybe it'll fade too with time \u2014
p389
aVbut I don't think so.
p390
aVThat bothers me the most.
p391
aa(lp392
VPM: Now I'm going to show you a video
p393
aa(lp394
Vof an actual grieving mother, Erin Runnion,
p395
aVconfronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court.
p396
aVHere you're going to see no false emotion,
p397
aVjust the authentic expression of a mother's agony.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Video) Erin Runnion: I wrote this statement
p400
aVon the third anniversary of the night you took my baby,
p401
aVand you hurt her,
p402
aVand you crushed her,
p403
aVyou terrified her until her heart stopped.
p404
aVAnd she fought, and I know she fought you.
p405
aVBut I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes,
p406
aVand you still wanted to kill her.
p407
aVAnd I don't understand it,
p408
aVand I never will.
p409
aa(lp410
VPM: Okay, there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions.
p411
aa(lp412
VNow the technology around what the truth looks like
p413
aVis progressing on, the science of it.
p414
aVWe know, for example,
p415
aVthat we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans,
p416
aVMRI's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out
p417
aVwhen we're trying to be deceptive.
p418
aVAnd these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us
p419
aVas panaceas for deceit,
p420
aVand they will prove incredibly useful some day.
p421
aVBut you've got to ask yourself in the meantime:
p422
aVWho do you want on your side of the meeting,
p423
aVsomeone who's trained in getting to the truth
p424
aVor some guy who's going to drag a 400-pound electroencephalogram
p425
aVthrough the door?
p426
aa(lp427
VLiespotters rely on human tools.
p428
aVThey know, as someone once said,
p429
aV"Character's who you are in the dark."
p430
aVAnd what's kind of interesting is that today, we have so little darkness.
p431
aVOur world is lit up 24 hours a day.
p432
aVIt's transparent with blogs and social networks
p433
aVbroadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people
p434
aVthat have made a choice to live their lives in public.
p435
aVIt's a much more noisy world.

aVSo one challenge we have is to remember,
p437
aVoversharing, that's not honesty.
p438
aVOur manic tweeting and texting can blind us
p439
aVto the fact that the subtleties of human decency \u2014 character integrity \u2014
p440
aVthat's still what matters, that's always what's going to matter.
p441
aVSo in this much noisier world,
p442
aVit might make sense for us
p443
aVto be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code.
p444
aa(lp445
VWhen you combine the science of recognizing deception
p446
aVwith the art of looking, listening,
p447
aVyou exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie.
p448
aVYou start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit,
p449
aVbecause you signal to everyone around you,
p450
aVyou say, "Hey, my world, our world, it's going to be an honest one.
p451
aVMy world is going to be one where truth is strengthened
p452
aVand falsehood is recognized and marginalized."
p453
aVAnd when you do that,
p454
aVthe ground around you starts to shift just a little bit.
p455
aa(lp456
VAnd that's the truth. Thank you.

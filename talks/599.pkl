VI have a studio in Berlin \u2014
p5
aVlet me cue on here \u2014
p6
aVwhich is down there in this snow, just last weekend.
p7
aVIn the studio we do a lot of experiments.
p8
aVI would consider the studio more like a laboratory.
p9
aVI have occasional meetings with scientists.
p10
aVAnd I have an academy, a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin.
p11
aVWe have an annual gathering of people,
p12
aVand that is called Life in Space.
p13
aVLife in Space is really not necessarily about
p14
aVhow we do things, but why we do things.
p15
aa(lp16
VDo you mind looking, with me, at that little cross in the center there?
p17
aVSo just keep looking. Don't mind me.
p18
aVSo you will have a yellow circle, and we will do an after-image experiment.
p19
aVWhen the circle goes away you will have another color, the complementary color.
p20
aVI am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back.
p21
aVThis whole idea of sharing, the idea of constituting reality
p22
aVby overlapping what I say and what you say \u2014
p23
aVthink of a movie.
p24
aa(lp25
VSince two years now, with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin,
p26
aVI've been working on these films
p27
aVwhere we produce the film together.
p28
aVI don't necessarily think the film is so interesting.
p29
aVObviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative.
p30
aVBut nevertheless, what the potential is \u2014
p31
aVand just keep looking there \u2014
p32
aVwhat the potential is, obviously,
p33
aVis to kind of move the border of who is the author,
p34
aVand who is the receiver.
p35
aVWho is the consumer, if you want,
p36
aVand who has responsibility for what one sees?
p37
aVI think there is a socializing dimension
p38
aVin, kind of, moving that border.
p39
aVWho decides what reality is?
p40
aa(lp41
VThis is the Tate Modern in London.
p42
aVThe show was, in a sense, about that.
p43
aVIt was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.
p44
aVI also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze.
p45
aVAnd my idea was to make the space tangible.
p46
aVWith such a big space, the problem is
p47
aVobviously that there is a discrepancy
p48
aVbetween what your body can embrace,
p49
aVand what the space, in that sense, is.
p50
aVSo here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements,
p51
aVif you want \u2014 some fog \u2014 I could make the space tangible.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd what happens is that people, they start to see themselves in this space.
p54
aVSo look at this. Look at the girl.
p55
aVOf course they have to look through a bloody camera
p56
aVin a museum. Right? That's how museums are working today.
p57
aVBut look at her face there,
p58
aVas she's checking out, looking at herself in the mirror.
p59
aV"Oh! That was my foot there!"
p60
aVShe wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.
p61
aVAnd in that whole idea,
p62
aVhow do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?
p63
aVHow do we reconfigure it?
p64
aVHow do we know that being in a space makes a difference?
p65
aa(lp66
VDo you see when I said in the beginning, it's about
p67
aVwhy, rather than how?
p68
aVThe why meant really,
p69
aV"What consequences does it have when I take a step?"
p70
aV"What does it matter?"
p71
aV"Does it matter if I am in the world or not?"
p72
aV"And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take
p73
aVfilter into a sense of responsibility?"
p74
aVIs art about that?
p75
aVI would say yes. It is obviously about
p76
aVnot just about decorating the world, and making it look even better,
p77
aVor even worse, if you ask me.
p78
aa(lp79
VIt's obviously also about taking responsibility,
p80
aVlike I did here when throwing some green dye in the river
p81
aVin L.A., Stockholm, Norway and Tokyo,
p82
aVamong other places.
p83
aVThe green dye is not environmentally dangerous,
p84
aVbut it obviously looks really rather frightening.
p85
aVAnd it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful,
p86
aVas it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas,
p87
aVin these different places of the world.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe "Green river," as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition,
p90
aVit was really about showing people,
p91
aVin this city, as they walk by,
p92
aVthat space has dimensions. A space has time.
p93
aVAnd the water flows through the city with time.
p94
aVThe water has an ability to make
p95
aVthe city negotiable, tangible.
p96
aVNegotiable meaning that it makes a difference
p97
aVwhether you do something or not.
p98
aVIt makes a difference whether you say, "I'm a part of this city.
p99
aVAnd if I vote it makes a difference.
p100
aVIf I take a stand, it makes a difference."
p101
aa(lp102
VThis whole idea of a city not being a picture is,
p103
aVI think, something that art, in a sense,
p104
aValways was working with.
p105
aVThe idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship
p106
aVbetween what it means to be in a picture,
p107
aVand what it means to be in a space. What is the difference?
p108
aVThe difference between thinking and doing.
p109
aVSo these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them.
p110
aVIceland, lower right corner, my favorite place.
p111
aa(lp112
VThese kinds of experiments, they filter into architectural models.
p113
aVThese are ongoing experiments.
p114
aVOne is an experiment I did for BMW,
p115
aVan attempt to make a car.
p116
aVIt's made out of ice.
p117
aVA crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top,
p118
aVwhich I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.
p119
aVA sort of a run track, or a walk track,
p120
aVon the top of a museum in Denmark,
p121
aVwhich is made of colored glass, going all around.
p122
aVSo the movement with your legs
p123
aVwill change the color of your horizon.
p124
aVAnd two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London,
p125
aVwith the Serpentine Gallery:
p126
aVa kind of a temporal pavilion where
p127
aVmoving was the only way you could see the pavilion.
p128
aVThis summer, in New York:
p129
aVthere is one thing about falling water which is very much about
p130
aVthe time it takes for water to fall.
p131
aVIt's quite simple and fundamental.
p132
aa(lp133
VI've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.
p134
aVAnd as you come to a new valley,
p135
aVas you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.
p136
aVIf you stand still, the landscape
p137
aVdoesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.
p138
aVIt doesn't really tell you what you're looking at.
p139
aVThe moment you start to move, the mountain starts to move.
p140
aVThe big mountains far away, they move less.
p141
aVThe small mountains in the foreground, they move more.
p142
aVAnd if you stop again, you wonder,
p143
aV"Is that a one-hour valley?
p144
aVOr is that a three-hour hike, or is that a whole day I'm looking at?"
p145
aa(lp146
VIf you have a waterfall in there,
p147
aVright out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall
p148
aVand you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly."
p149
aVAnd you go, "My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall."
p150
aVIf a waterfall is falling faster,
p151
aVit's a smaller waterfall which is closer by \u2014
p152
aVbecause the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere.
p153
aVAnd your body somehow knows that.
p154
aVSo this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space.
p155
aa(lp156
VOf course being an iconic city like New York,
p157
aVthat has had an interest in somehow
p158
aVplaying around with the sense of space, you could say that New York
p159
aVwants to seem as big as possible.
p160
aVAdding a measurement
p161
aVto that is interesting:
p162
aVthe falling water suddenly gives you a sense
p163
aVof, "Oh, Brooklyn is exactly this much \u2014
p164
aVthe distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan, in this case
p165
aVthe lower East River is this big."
p166
aa(lp167
VSo it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities.
p168
aVIt was also about giving the city a sense of dimension.
p169
aVAnd why would we want to do that?
p170
aVBecause I think it makes a difference
p171
aVwhether you have a body
p172
aVthat feels a part of a space,
p173
aVrather than having a body which is just in front of a picture.
p174
aVAnd "Ha-ha, there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter?"
p175
aVIs there a sense of consequences?
p176
aa(lp177
VSo if I have a sense of the space,
p178
aVif I feel that the space is tangible,
p179
aVif I feel there is time,
p180
aVif there is a dimension I could call time,
p181
aVI also feel that I can change the space.
p182
aVAnd suddenly it makes a difference
p183
aVin terms of making space accessible.
p184
aVOne could say this is about
p185
aVcommunity, collectivity.
p186
aVIt's about being together.
p187
aa(lp188
VHow do we create public space?
p189
aVWhat does the word "public" mean today anyway?
p190
aVSo, asked in that way,
p191
aVI think it raises great things about
p192
aVparliamentary ideas, democracy, public space,
p193
aVbeing together, being individual.
p194
aVHow do we create
p195
aVan idea which is both tolerant to individuality,
p196
aVand also to collectivity,
p197
aVwithout polarizing the two
p198
aVinto two different opposites?
p199
aVOf course the political agendas in the world
p200
aVhas been very obsessed, polarizing the two against each other
p201
aVinto different, very normative ideas.
p202
aa(lp203
VI would claim that art and culture,
p204
aVand this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting
p205
aVin the times we're living in now,
p206
aVhave proven that one can
p207
aVcreate a kind of a space
p208
aVwhich is both sensitive to individuality
p209
aVand to collectivity.
p210
aVIt's very much about this causality, consequences.
p211
aVIt's very much about the way we link
p212
aVthinking and doing.
p213
aVSo what is between thinking and doing?
p214
aVAnd right in-between thinking and doing,
p215
aVI would say, there is experience.
p216
aVAnd experience is not just
p217
aVa kind of entertainment in a non-casual way.
p218
aVExperience is about responsibility.
p219
aVHaving an experience is taking part in the world.
p220
aVTaking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility.
p221
aVSo art, in that sense,
p222
aVI think holds an incredible relevance
p223
aVin the world in which we're moving into,
p224
aVparticularly right now.
p225
aVThat's all I have. Thank you very much.

His immensely popular The Weather Project, at London&#39;s Tate Museum, immersed spectators in <strong>an artificial mirrored environment with its own looming sun (and its own analog of London fog)</strong>, and attracted 2 million visitors in the process. In the summer of 2008, his four massive waterfalls spectacularly punctuated key sites in New York&#39;s harbor -- including one pouring from beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. <br /><br />Eliasson&#39;s works emphasize tricks of light, refraction and scale, and <strong>tend to involve each viewer in his or her own unique experience</strong>, as in Beauty, which, by passing light through a wall of fine mist, produces a different rainbow when viewed from different points in the gallery. And his works engage passers-by in urban environments -- Eye See You,&nbsp; a project for Louis Vuitton (and meant to publicize <a href=\\"http://www.121ethiopia.org/\\">121 Ethiopia</a>, an African nonprofit&nbsp; Eliasson co-founded with his wife), grabs viewers in the street with a beam of light shot from the window by an eye-shaped lamp.</p>", "slug": "olafur_eliasson", "whotheyare": "The transparent simplicity and experiential nature of his work has built Olafur Eliasson\'s reputation as one of the world\'s most accessible creators of contemporary art.", "whatotherssay": "Many of his best-known works explore architecture and the mechanics of perception, almost as if the fantastical imaginings of Buckminster Fuller were reinterpreted by a cognitive scientist.", "id": 336, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/102084_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Playing with space and light", "take_action": null, "comments": 491, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/102083_800x600.jpg", "description": "In the spectacular large-scale projects he\'s famous for (such as \\"Waterfalls\\" in New York harbor), Olafur Eliasson creates art from a palette of space, distance, color and light.

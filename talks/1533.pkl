VIn Oxford in the 1950s,
p5
aVthere was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual,
p6
aVnamed Alice Stewart.
p7
aVAnd Alice was unusual partly because, of course,
p8
aVshe was a woman, which was pretty rare in the 1950s.
p9
aVAnd she was brilliant, she was one of the,
p10
aVat the time, the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians.
p11
aVShe was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married,
p12
aVafter she had kids,
p13
aVand even after she got divorced and was a single parent,
p14
aVshe continued her medical work.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science,
p17
aVthe emerging field of epidemiology,
p18
aVthe study of patterns in disease.
p19
aVBut like every scientist, she appreciated
p20
aVthat to make her mark, what she needed to do
p21
aVwas find a hard problem and solve it.
p22
aVThe hard problem that Alice chose
p23
aVwas the rising incidence of childhood cancers.
p24
aVMost disease is correlated with poverty,
p25
aVbut in the case of childhood cancers,
p26
aVthe children who were dying seemed mostly to come
p27
aVfrom affluent families.
p28
aVSo, what, she wanted to know,
p29
aVcould explain this anomaly?
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, Alice had trouble getting funding for her research.
p32
aVIn the end, she got just 1,000 pounds
p33
aVfrom the Lady Tata Memorial prize.
p34
aVAnd that meant she knew she only had one shot
p35
aVat collecting her data.
p36
aVNow, she had no idea what to look for.
p37
aVThis really was a needle in a haystack sort of search,
p38
aVso she asked everything she could think of.
p39
aVHad the children eaten boiled sweets?
p40
aVHad they consumed colored drinks?
p41
aVDid they eat fish and chips?
p42
aVDid they have indoor or outdoor plumbing?
p43
aVWhat time of life had they started school?
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back,
p46
aVone thing and one thing only jumped out
p47
aVwith the statistical clarity of a kind that
p48
aVmost scientists can only dream of.
p49
aVBy a rate of two to one,
p50
aVthe children who had died
p51
aVhad had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant.
p52
aVNow that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom.
p53
aVConventional wisdom held
p54
aVthat everything was safe up to a point, a threshold.
p55
aVIt flew in the face of conventional wisdom,
p56
aVwhich was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology
p57
aVof that age, which was the X-ray machine.
p58
aVAnd it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves,
p59
aVwhich was as people who helped patients,
p60
aVthey didn't harm them.
p61
aa(lp62
VNevertheless, Alice Stewart rushed to publish
p63
aVher preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956.
p64
aVPeople got very excited, there was talk of the Nobel Prize,
p65
aVand Alice really was in a big hurry
p66
aVto try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find
p67
aVbefore they disappeared.
p68
aVIn fact, she need not have hurried.
p69
aVIt was fully 25 years before the British and medical \u2014
p70
aVBritish and American medical establishments
p71
aVabandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women.
p72
aVThe data was out there, it was open, it was freely available,
p73
aVbut nobody wanted to know.
p74
aVA child a week was dying,
p75
aVbut nothing changed.
p76
aVOpenness alone can't drive change.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands.
p79
aVSo, how did she know that she was right?
p80
aVWell, she had a fantastic model for thinking.
p81
aVShe worked with a statistician named George Kneale,
p82
aVand George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't.
p83
aVSo, Alice was very outgoing and sociable,
p84
aVand George was a recluse.
p85
aVAlice was very warm, very empathetic with her patients.
p86
aVGeorge frankly preferred numbers to people.
p87
aVBut he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship.
p88
aVHe said, "My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong."
p89
aVHe actively sought disconfirmation.
p90
aVDifferent ways of looking at her models,
p91
aVat her statistics, different ways of crunching the data
p92
aVin order to disprove her.
p93
aVHe saw his job as creating conflict around her theories.
p94
aVBecause it was only by not being able to prove
p95
aVthat she was wrong,
p96
aVthat George could give Alice the confidence she needed
p97
aVto know that she was right.
p98
aa(lp99
VIt's a fantastic model of collaboration \u2014
p100
aVthinking partners who aren't echo chambers.
p101
aVI wonder how many of us have,
p102
aVor dare to have, such collaborators.
p103
aVAlice and George were very good at conflict.
p104
aVThey saw it as thinking.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo what does that kind of constructive conflict require?
p107
aVWell, first of all, it requires that we find people
p108
aVwho are very different from ourselves.
p109
aVThat means we have to resist the neurobiological drive,
p110
aVwhich means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves,
p111
aVand it means we have to seek out people
p112
aVwith different backgrounds, different disciplines,
p113
aVdifferent ways of thinking and different experience,
p114
aVand find ways to engage with them.
p115
aVThat requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd the more I've thought about this,
p118
aVthe more I think, really, that that's a kind of love.
p119
aVBecause you simply won't commit that kind of energy
p120
aVand time if you don't really care.
p121
aVAnd it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds.
p122
aVAlice's daughter told me
p123
aVthat every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist,
p124
aVthey made her think and think and think again.
p125
aV"My mother," she said, "My mother didn't enjoy a fight,
p126
aVbut she was really good at them."
p127
aa(lp128
VSo it's one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship.
p129
aVBut it strikes me that the biggest problems we face,
p130
aVmany of the biggest disasters that we've experienced,
p131
aVmostly haven't come from individuals,
p132
aVthey've come from organizations,
p133
aVsome of them bigger than countries,
p134
aVmany of them capable of affecting hundreds,
p135
aVthousands, even millions of lives.
p136
aVSo how do organizations think?
p137
aVWell, for the most part, they don't.
p138
aVAnd that isn't because they don't want to,
p139
aVit's really because they can't.
p140
aVAnd they can't because the people inside of them
p141
aVare too afraid of conflict.
p142
aa(lp143
VIn surveys of European and American executives,
p144
aVfully 85 percent of them acknowledged
p145
aVthat they had issues or concerns at work
p146
aVthat they were afraid to raise.
p147
aVAfraid of the conflict that that would provoke,
p148
aVafraid to get embroiled in arguments
p149
aVthat they did not know how to manage,
p150
aVand felt that they were bound to lose.
p151
aVEighty-five percent is a really big number.
p152
aVIt means that organizations mostly can't do
p153
aVwhat George and Alice so triumphantly did.
p154
aVThey can't think together.
p155
aVAnd it means that people like many of us,
p156
aVwho have run organizations,
p157
aVand gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can,
p158
aVmostly fail to get the best out of them.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo how do we develop the skills that we need?
p161
aVBecause it does take skill and practice, too.
p162
aVIf we aren't going to be afraid of conflict,
p163
aVwe have to see it as thinking,
p164
aVand then we have to get really good at it.
p165
aVSo, recently, I worked with an executive named Joe,
p166
aVand Joe worked for a medical device company.
p167
aVAnd Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on.
p168
aVHe thought that it was too complicated
p169
aVand he thought that its complexity
p170
aVcreated margins of error that could really hurt people.
p171
aVHe was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help.
p172
aVBut when he looked around his organization,
p173
aVnobody else seemed to be at all worried.
p174
aVSo, he didn't really want to say anything.
p175
aVAfter all, maybe they knew something he didn't.
p176
aVMaybe he'd look stupid.
p177
aVBut he kept worrying about it,
p178
aVand he worried about it so much that he got to the point
p179
aVwhere he thought the only thing he could do
p180
aVwas leave a job he loved.
p181
aa(lp182
VIn the end, Joe and I found a way
p183
aVfor him to raise his concerns.
p184
aVAnd what happened then is what almost always
p185
aVhappens in this situation.
p186
aVIt turned out everybody had exactly the same
p187
aVquestions and doubts.
p188
aVSo now Joe had allies. They could think together.
p189
aVAnd yes, there was a lot of conflict and debate
p190
aVand argument, but that allowed everyone around the table
p191
aVto be creative, to solve the problem,
p192
aVand to change the device.
p193
aa(lp194
VJoe was what a lot of people might think of
p195
aVas a whistle-blower,
p196
aVexcept that like almost all whistle-blowers,
p197
aVhe wasn't a crank at all,
p198
aVhe was passionately devoted to the organization
p199
aVand the higher purposes that that organization served.
p200
aVBut he had been so afraid of conflict,
p201
aVuntil finally he became more afraid of the silence.
p202
aVAnd when he dared to speak,
p203
aVhe discovered much more inside himself
p204
aVand much more give in the system than he had ever imagined.
p205
aVAnd his colleagues don't think of him as a crank.
p206
aVThey think of him as a leader.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo, how do we have these conversations more easily
p209
aVand more often?
p210
aVWell, the University of Delft
p211
aVrequires that its PhD students
p212
aVhave to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend.
p213
aVIt doesn't really matter what the statements are about,
p214
aVwhat matters is that the candidates are willing and able
p215
aVto stand up to authority.
p216
aVI think it's a fantastic system,
p217
aVbut I think leaving it to PhD candidates
p218
aVis far too few people, and way too late in life.
p219
aVI think we need to be teaching these skills
p220
aVto kids and adults at every stage of their development,
p221
aVif we want to have thinking organizations
p222
aVand a thinking society.
p223
aa(lp224
VThe fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed
p225
aVrarely come from information that is secret or hidden.
p226
aVIt comes from information that is freely available and out there,
p227
aVbut that we are willfully blind to,
p228
aVbecause we can't handle, don't want to handle,
p229
aVthe conflict that it provokes.
p230
aVBut when we dare to break that silence,
p231
aVor when we dare to see,
p232
aVand we create conflict,
p233
aVwe enable ourselves and the people around us
p234
aVto do our very best thinking.
p235
aa(lp236
VOpen information is fantastic,
p237
aVopen networks are essential.
p238
aVBut the truth won't set us free
p239
aVuntil we develop the skills and the habit and the talent
p240
aVand the moral courage to use it.
p241
aVOpenness isn't the end.
p242
aVIt's the beginning.

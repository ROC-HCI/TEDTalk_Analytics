VSuppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy.
p5
aVThey go to see Michelangelo's "David,"
p6
aVand when they finally come face to face with the statue,
p7
aVthey both freeze dead in their tracks.
p8
aVThe first guy \u2014 we'll call him Adam \u2014
p9
aVis transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form.
p10
aVThe second guy \u2014 we'll call him Bill \u2014
p11
aVis transfixed by embarrassment, at staring at the thing there in the center.
p12
aVSo here's my question for you:
p13
aVwhich one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush,
p14
aVwhich for Al Gore?
p15
aa(lp16
VI don't need a show of hands
p17
aVbecause we all have the same political stereotypes.
p18
aVWe all know that it's Bill.
p19
aVAnd in this case, the stereotype corresponds to reality.
p20
aVIt really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives
p21
aVon a major personality trait called openness to experience.
p22
aVPeople who are high in openness to experience
p23
aVjust crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel.
p24
aVPeople low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable.
p25
aa(lp26
VIf you know about this trait,
p27
aVyou can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior.
p28
aVYou can understand why artists are so different from accountants.
p29
aVYou can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read,
p30
aVwhat kinds of places they like to travel to,
p31
aVand what kinds of food they like to eat.
p32
aVOnce you understand this trait, you can understand
p33
aVwhy anybody would eat at Applebee's, but not anybody that you know.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVThis trait also tells us a lot about politics.
p36
aVThe main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae says that,
p37
aV"Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views" \u2014
p38
aVthey like a society which is open and changing \u2014
p39
aV"whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views."
p40
aa(lp41
VThis trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join.
p42
aVSo here's the description of a group I found on the Web.
p43
aVWhat kinds of people would join a global community
p44
aVwelcoming people from every discipline and culture,
p45
aVwho seek a deeper understanding of the world,
p46
aVand who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all?
p47
aVThis is from some guy named Ted.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVWell, let's see now, if openness predicts who becomes liberal,
p50
aVand openness predicts who becomes a TEDster,
p51
aVthen might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal?
p52
aVLet's find out.
p53
aVI'm going to ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center \u2014
p54
aVon social issues, we're talking about, primarily \u2014
p55
aVor conservative, and I'll give a third option,
p56
aVbecause I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience.
p57
aVSo, right now, please raise your hand \u2014
p58
aVdown in the simulcast rooms, too,
p59
aVlet's let everybody see who's here \u2014
p60
aVplease raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center.
p61
aVPlease raise your hand high right now. OK.
p62
aVPlease raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian.
p63
aVOK, about a \u2014 two dozen.
p64
aVAnd please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative.
p65
aVOne, two, three, four, five \u2014 about eight or 10.
p66
aa(lp67
VOK. This is a bit of a problem.
p68
aVBecause if our goal is to understand the world,
p69
aVto seek a deeper understanding of the world,
p70
aVour general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.
p71
aVBecause when people all share values, when people all share morals,
p72
aVthey become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams,
p73
aVit shuts down open-minded thinking.
p74
aVWhen the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004,
p75
aVand as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVWe try to explain why half of America voted for the other team.
p78
aVWe think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aV(Applause)
p81
aVSo, if you think that half of America votes Republican
p82
aVbecause they are blinded in this way,
p83
aVthen my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix,
p84
aVin a particular moral matrix.
p85
aVAnd by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie "The Matrix."
p86
aa(lp87
VBut I'm here today to give you a choice.
p88
aVYou can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions,
p89
aVor you can take the red pill,
p90
aVlearn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix.
p91
aVNow, because I know \u2014
p92
aV(Applause) \u2014
p93
aVOK, I assume that answers my question.
p94
aVI was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need.
p95
aVYou're all high in openness to experience, and besides,
p96
aVit looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures.
p97
aVSo anyway, let's go with the red pill.
p98
aVLet's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us.
p99
aa(lp100
VLet's start at the beginning.
p101
aVWhat is morality and where does it come from?
p102
aVThe worst idea in all of psychology
p103
aVis the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.
p104
aVDevelopmental psychology has shown
p105
aVthat kids come into the world already knowing so much
p106
aVabout the physical and social worlds,
p107
aVand programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things
p108
aVand hard to learn others.
p109
aVThe best definition of innateness I've ever seen \u2014
p110
aVthis just clarifies so many things for me \u2014
p111
aVis from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.
p112
aVHe says, "The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience.
p113
aVNature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.
p114
aVBuilt-in doesn't mean unmalleable;
p115
aVit means organized in advance of experience."
p116
aVOK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind?
p117
aVTo find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I
p118
aVread through the literature on anthropology,
p119
aVon culture variation in morality
p120
aVand also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches.
p121
aVWhat are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines?
p122
aVThat you find across cultures and even across species?
p123
aVWe found five \u2014 five best matches,
p124
aVwhich we call the five foundations of morality.
p125
aa(lp126
VThe first one is harm/care.
p127
aVWe're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming
p128
aVthat makes us really bond with others, care for others,
p129
aVfeel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.
p130
aVIt gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.
p131
aVThis moral foundation underlies about 70 percent
p132
aVof the moral statements I've heard here at TED.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.
p135
aVThere's actually ambiguous evidence
p136
aVas to whether you find reciprocity in other animals,
p137
aVbut the evidence for people could not be clearer.
p138
aVThis Norman Rockwell painting is called "The Golden Rule,"
p139
aVand we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course,
p140
aVas the foundation of so many religions.
p141
aVThat second foundation underlies the other 30 percent
p142
aVof the moral statements I've heard here at TED.
p143
aa(lp144
VThe third foundation is in-group/loyalty.
p145
aVYou do find groups in the animal kingdom \u2014
p146
aVyou do find cooperative groups \u2014
p147
aVbut these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings.
p148
aVIt's only among humans that you find very large groups of people
p149
aVwho are able to cooperate, join together into groups,
p150
aVbut in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.
p151
aVThis probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology.
p152
aVAnd this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable
p153
aVthat even when we don't have tribes,
p154
aVwe go ahead and make them, because it's fun.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVSports is to war as pornography is to sex.
p157
aVWe get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives.
p158
aa(lp159
VThe fourth foundation is authority/respect.
p160
aVHere you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species.
p161
aVBut authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality,
p162
aVas it is in other primates.
p163
aVIt's based on more voluntary deference,
p164
aVand even elements of love, at times.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.
p167
aVThis painting is called "The Allegory Of Chastity,"
p168
aVbut purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality.
p169
aVIt's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea
p170
aVthat tells you that you can attain virtue
p171
aVby controlling what you do with your body,
p172
aVby controlling what you put into your body.
p173
aVAnd while the political right may moralize sex much more,
p174
aVthe political left is really doing a lot of it with food.
p175
aVFood is becoming extremely moralized nowadays,
p176
aVand a lot of it is ideas about purity,
p177
aVabout what you're willing to touch, or put into your body.
p178
aa(lp179
VI believe these are the five best candidates
p180
aVfor what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.
p181
aVI think this is what we come with, at least
p182
aVa preparedness to learn all of these things.
p183
aVBut as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town,
p184
aVhow is this first draft going to get revised?
p185
aVAnd how will it end up being different
p186
aVfrom a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia?
p187
aVTo think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor.
p188
aVIf there really are five systems at work in the mind \u2014
p189
aVfive sources of intuitions and emotions \u2014
p190
aVthen we can think of the moral mind
p191
aVas being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels,
p192
aVwhere you can set it to a different setting on every channel.
p193
aVAnd my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I,
p194
aVmade a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.
p195
aVAnd so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too.
p196
aVHere are the results.
p197
aVHere are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.
p198
aVOn the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals;
p199
aVon the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates.
p200
aVThe blue line shows you people's responses
p201
aVon the average of all the harm questions.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo, as you see, people care about harm and care issues.
p204
aVThey give high endorsement of these sorts of statements
p205
aVall across the board, but as you also see,
p206
aVliberals care about it a little more than conservatives \u2014 the line slopes down.
p207
aVSame story for fairness.
p208
aVBut look at the other three lines.
p209
aVFor liberals, the scores are very low.
p210
aVLiberals are basically saying, "No, this is not morality.
p211
aVIn-group, authority, purity \u2014 this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it."
p212
aVBut as people get more conservative, the values rise.
p213
aVWe can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel,
p214
aVor two-foundation morality.
p215
aVConservatives have more of a five-foundation,
p216
aVor five-channel morality.
p217
aa(lp218
VWe find this in every country we look at.
p219
aVHere's the data for 1,100 Canadians.
p220
aVI'll just flip through a few other slides.
p221
aVThe U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe,
p222
aVLatin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.
p223
aVNotice also that on all of these graphs,
p224
aVthe slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity.
p225
aVWhich shows that within any country,
p226
aVthe disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.
p227
aVEverybody \u2014 I mean, we debate over what's fair \u2014
p228
aVbut everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.
p229
aVMoral arguments within cultures
p230
aVare especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.
p231
aa(lp232
VThis effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.
p233
aVIn one recent study,
p234
aVwe asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog.
p235
aVYou picked a particular breed,
p236
aVyou learned some new information about the breed.
p237
aVSuppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded,
p238
aVand relates to its owner as a friend and an equal?
p239
aVWell, if you are a liberal, you say, "Hey, that's great!"
p240
aVBecause liberals like to say, "Fetch, please."
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aVBut if you're conservative, that's not so attractive.
p243
aVIf you're conservative, and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal
p244
aVto its home and family, and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers,
p245
aVfor conservatives, well, loyalty is good \u2014 dogs ought to be loyal.
p246
aVBut to a liberal, it sounds like this dog
p247
aVis running for the Republican nomination.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VSo, you might say, OK,
p251
aVthere are these differences between liberals and conservatives,
p252
aVbut what makes those three other foundations moral?
p253
aVAren't those just the foundations of xenophobia
p254
aVand authoritarianism and Puritanism?
p255
aVWhat makes them moral?
p256
aVThe answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch,
p257
aV"The Garden of Earthly Delights."
p258
aVIn the first panel, we see the moment of creation.
p259
aVAll is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animals
p260
aVare doing what they're supposed to be doing, where they're supposed to be.
p261
aVBut then, given the way of the world, things change.
p262
aVWe get every person doing whatever he wants,
p263
aVwith every aperture of every other person and every other animal.
p264
aVSome of you might recognize this as the '60s.
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aVBut the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s,
p267
aVwhere the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more.
p268
aVOf course, Bosch called this hell.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo this triptych, these three panels
p271
aVportray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.
p272
aVThe truth of social entropy.
p273
aVBut lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination
p274
aVwhere Christians have this weird problem with pleasure,
p275
aVhere's the same story, the same progression,
p276
aVtold in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago,
p277
aVin which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma.
p278
aVA game in which you give people money,
p279
aVand then, on each round of the game,
p280
aVthey can put money into a common pot,
p281
aVand then the experimenter doubles what's in there,
p282
aVand then it's all divided among the players.
p283
aVSo it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues,
p284
aVwhere we're asking people to make a sacrifice
p285
aVand they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice.
p286
aVBut you really want everybody else to sacrifice,
p287
aVbut everybody has a temptation to a free ride.
p288
aVAnd what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative \u2014
p289
aVand this is all played anonymously.
p290
aVOn the first round, people give about half of the money that they can.
p291
aVBut they quickly see, "You know what, other people aren't doing so much though.
p292
aVI don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate."
p293
aVAnd so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut then \u2014 and here's the trick \u2014
p296
aVFehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people,
p297
aV"You know what? New rule.
p298
aVIf you want to give some of your own money
p299
aVto punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that."
p300
aVAnd as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on,
p301
aVcooperation shoots up.
p302
aVIt shoots up and it keeps going up.
p303
aVThere's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.
p304
aVIt's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives.
p305
aVIt really helps to have some sort of punishment.
p306
aVEven if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip,
p307
aVyou need some sort of punishment to bring people,
p308
aVwhen they're in large groups, to cooperate.
p309
aVThere's even some recent research suggesting that religion \u2014
p310
aVpriming God, making people think about God \u2014
p311
aVoften, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.
p312
aa(lp313
VSome people think that religion is an adaptation
p314
aVevolved both by cultural and biological evolution
p315
aVto make groups to cohere,
p316
aVin part for the purpose of trusting each other,
p317
aVand then being more effective at competing with other groups.
p318
aVI think that's probably right,
p319
aValthough this is a controversial issue.
p320
aVBut I'm particularly interested in religion,
p321
aVand the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us.
p322
aVBecause I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon.
p323
aVThe Grand Canyon is really simple.
p324
aVIt's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time,
p325
aVand you get the Grand Canyon.
p326
aVIt's not that complicated.
p327
aVThis is what's really complicated,
p328
aVthat there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon,
p329
aVcooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa,
p330
aVor on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villages
p331
aVgrew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan.
p332
aVHow did this happen?
p333
aVThis is an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.
p334
aa(lp335
VThe answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox.
p336
aVIt took all of our moral psychology
p337
aVto create these cooperative groups.
p338
aVYes, you do need to be concerned about harm,
p339
aVyou do need a psychology of justice.
p340
aVBut it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups,
p341
aVand if those sub-groups have some internal structure,
p342
aVand if you have some ideology that tells people
p343
aVto suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends.
p344
aVAnd now we get to the crux of the disagreement
p345
aVbetween liberals and conservatives.
p346
aVBecause liberals reject three of these foundations.
p347
aVThey say "No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership."
p348
aVThey say, "Let's question authority."
p349
aVAnd they say, "Keep your laws off my body."
p350
aa(lp351
VLiberals have very noble motives for doing this.
p352
aVTraditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive,
p353
aVand restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in.
p354
aVSo liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.
p355
aVThey want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.
p356
aVThis guy's shirt says, "Stop bitching, start a revolution."
p357
aVIf you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good,
p358
aVit's change, it's fun.
p359
aVConservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.
p360
aVThey want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.
p361
aVThe great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.
p362
aVIt's really precious, and it's really easy to lose.
p363
aVSo as Edmund Burke said, "The restraints on men,
p364
aVas well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights."
p365
aVThis was after the chaos of the French Revolution.
p366
aVSo once you see this \u2014 once you see
p367
aVthat liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute,
p368
aVthat they form a balance on change versus stability \u2014
p369
aVthen I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix.
p370
aa(lp371
VThis is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained.
p372
aVThink about yin and yang.
p373
aVYin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other.
p374
aVYin and yang are both necessary, like night and day,
p375
aVfor the functioning of the world.
p376
aVYou find the same thing in Hinduism.
p377
aVThere are many high gods in Hinduism.
p378
aVTwo of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.
p379
aVThis image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body.
p380
aVYou have the markings of Vishnu on the left,
p381
aVso we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god.
p382
aVYou have the markings of Shiva on the right,
p383
aVShiva's the liberal god. And they work together.
p384
aVYou find the same thing in Buddhism.
p385
aVThese two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights
p386
aVthat have ever been attained into moral psychology.
p387
aVFrom the Zen master Seng-ts'an:
p388
aV"If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against.
p389
aVThe struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease."
p390
aVNow unfortunately, it's a disease
p391
aVthat has been caught by many of the world's leaders.
p392
aVBut before you feel superior to George Bush,
p393
aVbefore you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this?
p394
aVDo you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil?
p395
aVCan you be not for or against anything?
p396
aa(lp397
VSo, what's the point? What should you do?
p398
aVWell, if you take the greatest insights
p399
aVfrom ancient Asian philosophies and religions,
p400
aVand you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology,
p401
aVI think you come to these conclusions:
p402
aVthat our righteous minds were designed by evolution
p403
aVto unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams
p404
aVand then to blind us to the truth.
p405
aVSo what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive?
p406
aVAm I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop,
p407
aVstop with this struggle of for and against?
p408
aVNo, absolutely not. I'm not saying that.
p409
aVThis is an amazing group of people who are doing so much,
p410
aVusing so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money,
p411
aVto make the world a better place, to fight \u2014
p412
aVto fight wrongs, to solve problems.
p413
aa(lp414
VBut as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story
p415
aVabout Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in,
p416
aVsaying, "You're wrong, and I'm right."
p417
aVBecause, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.
p418
aVA lot of the problems we have to solve
p419
aVare problems that require us to change other people.
p420
aVAnd if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it
p421
aVis to first understand who we are \u2014 understand our moral psychology,
p422
aVunderstand that we all think we're right \u2014 and then step out,
p423
aVeven if it's just for a moment, step out \u2014 check in with Seng-ts'an.
p424
aVStep out of the moral matrix,
p425
aVjust try to see it as a struggle playing out,
p426
aVin which everybody does think they're right,
p427
aVand everybody, at least, has some reasons \u2014 even if you disagree with them \u2014
p428
aVeverybody has some reasons for what they're doing.
p429
aVStep out.
p430
aVAnd if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility,
p431
aVto get yourself out of this self-righteousness,
p432
aVwhich is the normal human condition.
p433
aVThink about the Dalai Lama.
p434
aVThink about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama \u2014
p435
aVand it comes from his moral humility.
p436
aa(lp437
VSo I think the point \u2014 the point of my talk,
p438
aVand I think the point of TED \u2014
p439
aVis that this is a group that is passionately engaged
p440
aVin the pursuit of changing the world for the better.
p441
aVPeople here are passionately engaged
p442
aVin trying to make the world a better place.
p443
aVBut there is also a passionate commitment to the truth.
p444
aVAnd so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment
p445
aVto the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all.
p446
aVThank you.
p447
aV(Applause)

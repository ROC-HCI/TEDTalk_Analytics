VI'm going to talk to you about optimism \u2014
p5
aVor more precisely, the optimism bias.
p6
aVIt's a cognitive illusion
p7
aVthat we've been studying in my lab for the past few years,
p8
aVand 80 percent of us have it.
p9
aa(lp10
VIt's our tendency to overestimate
p11
aVour likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives
p12
aVand underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.
p13
aVSo we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer,
p14
aVbeing in a car accident.
p15
aVWe overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.
p16
aVIn short, we're more optimistic than realistic,
p17
aVbut we are oblivious to the fact.
p18
aa(lp19
VTake marriage for example.
p20
aVIn the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.
p21
aVThat means that out of five married couples,
p22
aVtwo will end up splitting their assets.
p23
aVBut when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce,
p24
aVthey estimate it at zero percent.
p25
aVAnd even divorce lawyers, who should really know better,
p26
aVhugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce.
p27
aVSo it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce,
p28
aVbut they are more likely to remarry.
p29
aVIn the words of Samuel Johnson,
p30
aV"Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience."
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VSo if we're married, we're more likely to have kids.
p35
aVAnd we all think our kids will be especially talented.
p36
aVThis, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy.
p37
aVAnd I just want to make it absolutely clear
p38
aVthat he's a really bad example of the optimism bias,
p39
aVbecause he is in fact uniquely talented.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I'm not alone.
p44
aVOut of four British people, three said
p45
aVthat they were optimistic about the future of their own families.
p46
aVThat's 75 percent.
p47
aVBut only 30 percent said
p48
aVthat they thought families in general
p49
aVare doing better than a few generations ago.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd this is a really important point,
p52
aVbecause we're optimistic about ourselves,
p53
aVwe're optimistic about our kids,
p54
aVwe're optimistic about our families,
p55
aVbut we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us,
p56
aVand we're somewhat pessimistic
p57
aVabout the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country.
p58
aVBut private optimism about our own personal future
p59
aVremains persistent.
p60
aVAnd it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay,
p61
aVbut rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow I'm a scientist, I do experiments.
p64
aVSo to show you what I mean,
p65
aVI'm going to do an experiment here with you.
p66
aVSo I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics,
p67
aVand I want you to think for each of these abilities
p68
aVwhere you stand relative to the rest of the population.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe first one is getting along well with others.
p71
aVWho here believes they're at the bottom 25 percent?
p72
aVOkay, that's about 10 people out of 1,500.
p73
aVWho believes they're at the top 25 percent?
p74
aVThat's most of us here.
p75
aVOkay, now do the same for your driving ability.
p76
aVHow interesting are you?
p77
aVHow attractive are you?
p78
aVHow honest are you?
p79
aVAnd finally, how modest are you?
p80
aa(lp81
VSo most of us put ourselves above average
p82
aVon most of these abilities.
p83
aVNow this is statistically impossible.
p84
aVWe can't all be better than everyone else.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVBut if we believe we're better than the other guy,
p87
aVwell that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married,
p88
aVbecause we're more social, more interesting.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd it's a global phenomenon.
p91
aVThe optimism bias has been observed
p92
aVin many different countries \u2014
p93
aVin Western cultures, in non-Western cultures,
p94
aVin females and males,
p95
aVin kids, in the elderly.
p96
aVIt's quite widespread.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut the question is, is it good for us?
p99
aVSo some people say no.
p100
aVSome people say the secret to happiness
p101
aVis low expectations.
p102
aVI think the logic goes something like this:
p103
aVIf we don't expect greatness,
p104
aVif we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful,
p105
aVwell we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen.
p106
aVAnd if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen,
p107
aVand we're pleasantly surprised when they do,
p108
aVwe will be happy.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo it's a very good theory,
p111
aVbut it turns out to be wrong for three reasons.
p112
aVNumber one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail,
p113
aVpeople with high expectations always feel better.
p114
aVBecause how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month
p115
aVdepends on how we interpret that event.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown
p118
aVstudied students with high and low expectations.
p119
aVAnd they found that when people with high expectations succeed,
p120
aVthey attribute that success to their own traits.
p121
aV"I'm a genius, therefore I got an A,
p122
aVtherefore I'll get an A again and again in the future."
p123
aVWhen they failed, it wasn't because they were dumb,
p124
aVbut because the exam just happened to be unfair.
p125
aVNext time they will do better.
p126
aVPeople with low expectations do the opposite.
p127
aVSo when they failed it was because they were dumb,
p128
aVand when they succeeded
p129
aVit was because the exam just happened to be really easy.
p130
aVNext time reality would catch up with them.
p131
aVSo they felt worse.
p132
aa(lp133
VNumber two: Regardless of the outcome,
p134
aVthe pure act of anticipation makes us happy.
p135
aVThe behavioral economist George Lowenstein
p136
aVasked students in his university
p137
aVto imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity.
p138
aVThen he said, "How much are you willing to pay
p139
aVto get a kiss from a celebrity
p140
aVif the kiss was delivered immediately,
p141
aVin three hours, in 24 hours, in three days,
p142
aVin one year, in 10 years?
p143
aVHe found that the students were willing to pay the most
p144
aVnot to get a kiss immediately,
p145
aVbut to get a kiss in three days.
p146
aVThey were willing to pay extra in order to wait.
p147
aVNow they weren't willing to wait a year or 10 years;
p148
aVno one wants an aging celebrity.
p149
aVBut three days seemed to be the optimum amount.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo why is that?
p152
aVWell if you get the kiss now, it's over and done with.
p153
aVBut if you get the kiss in three days,
p154
aVwell that's three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait.
p155
aVThe students wanted that time
p156
aVto imagine where is it going to happen,
p157
aVhow is it going to happen.
p158
aVAnticipation made them happy.
p159
aa(lp160
VThis is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday.
p161
aVIt's a really curious fact,
p162
aVbecause Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure,
p163
aVso you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday,
p164
aVbut they don't.
p165
aVIt's not because they really, really like being in the office
p166
aVand they can't stand strolling in the park
p167
aVor having a lazy brunch.
p168
aVWe know that, because when you ask people
p169
aVabout their ultimate favorite day of the week,
p170
aVsurprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first,
p171
aVthen Friday, then Sunday.
p172
aVPeople prefer Friday
p173
aVbecause Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead,
p174
aVall the plans that you have.
p175
aVOn Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to
p176
aVis the work week.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future,
p179
aVmore strolls in the park.
p180
aVAnd that anticipation enhances their wellbeing.
p181
aVIn fact, without the optimism bias,
p182
aVwe would all be slightly depressed.
p183
aVPeople with mild depression,
p184
aVthey don't have a bias when they look into the future.
p185
aVThey're actually more realistic than healthy individuals.
p186
aVBut individuals with severe depression,
p187
aVthey have a pessimistic bias.
p188
aVSo they tend to expect the future
p189
aVto be worse than it ends up being.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo optimism changes subjective reality.
p192
aVThe way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it.
p193
aVBut it also changes objective reality.
p194
aVIt acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
p195
aVAnd that is the third reason
p196
aVwhy lowering your expectations will not make you happy.
p197
aVControlled experiments have shown
p198
aVthat optimism is not only related to success,
p199
aVit leads to success.
p200
aVOptimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics.
p201
aVAnd maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health.
p202
aVIf we expect the future to be bright,
p203
aVstress and anxiety are reduced.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.
p206
aVBut the question that was really confusing to me was,
p207
aVhow do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?
p208
aVAs an neuroscientist, this was especially confusing,
p209
aVbecause according to all the theories out there,
p210
aVwhen your expectations are not met, you should alter them.
p211
aVBut this is not what we find.
p212
aVWe asked people to come into our lab
p213
aVin order to try and figure out what was going on.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe asked them to estimate their likelihood
p216
aVof experiencing different terrible events in their lives.
p217
aVSo, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer?
p218
aVAnd then we told them the average likelihood
p219
aVof someone like them to suffer these misfortunes.
p220
aVSo cancer, for example, is about 30 percent.
p221
aVAnd then we asked them again,
p222
aV"How likely are you to suffer from cancer?"
p223
aa(lp224
VWhat we wanted to know was
p225
aVwhether people will take the information that we gave them
p226
aVto change their beliefs.
p227
aVAnd indeed they did \u2014
p228
aVbut mostly when the information we gave them
p229
aVwas better than what they expected.
p230
aVSo for example,
p231
aVif someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer
p232
aVis about 50 percent,"
p233
aVand we said, "Hey, good news.
p234
aVThe average likelihood is only 30 percent,"
p235
aVthe next time around they would say,
p236
aV"Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent."
p237
aVSo they learned quickly and efficiently.
p238
aVBut if someone started off saying,
p239
aV"My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent,"
p240
aVand we said, "Hey, bad news.
p241
aVThe average likelihood is about 30 percent,"
p242
aVthe next time around they would say,
p243
aV"Yep. Still think it's about 11 percent."
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VSo it's not that they didn't learn at all \u2014 they did \u2014
p248
aVbut much, much less than when we gave them
p249
aVpositive information about the future.
p250
aVAnd it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them;
p251
aVeveryone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer
p252
aVis about 30 percent
p253
aVand the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.
p254
aVBut they didn't think that those numbers were related to them.
p255
aa(lp256
VWhat this means is that warning signs such as these
p257
aVmay only have limited impact.
p258
aVYes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.
p259
aa(lp260
VWhat I wanted to know was
p261
aVwhat was going on inside the human brain
p262
aVthat prevented us from taking these warning signs personally.
p263
aVBut at the same time,
p264
aVwhen we hear that the housing market is hopeful,
p265
aVwe think, "Oh, my house is definitely going to double in price."
p266
aVTo try and figure that out,
p267
aVI asked the participants in the experiment
p268
aVto lie in a brain imaging scanner.
p269
aVIt looks like this.
p270
aVAnd using a method called functional MRI,
p271
aVwe were able to identify regions in the brain
p272
aVthat were responding to positive information.
p273
aa(lp274
VOne of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.
p275
aVSo if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent,"
p276
aVand we said, "Hey, good news.
p277
aVAverage likelihood is 30 percent,"
p278
aVthe left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely.
p279
aVAnd it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist, a mild optimist
p280
aVor slightly pessimistic,
p281
aVeveryone's left inferior frontal gyrus
p282
aVwas functioning perfectly well,
p283
aVwhether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen.
p284
aa(lp285
VOn the other side of the brain,
p286
aVthe right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news.
p287
aVAnd here's the thing: it wasn't doing a very good job.
p288
aVThe more optimistic you were,
p289
aVthe less likely this region was
p290
aVto respond to unexpected negative information.
p291
aVAnd if your brain is failing
p292
aVat integrating bad news about the future,
p293
aVyou will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo we wanted to know, could we change this?
p296
aVCould we alter people's optimism bias
p297
aVby interfering with the brain activity in these regions?
p298
aVAnd there's a way for us to do that.
p299
aa(lp300
VThis is my collaborator Ryota Kanai.
p301
aVAnd what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse
p302
aVthrough the skull of the participant in our study
p303
aVinto their inferior frontal gyrus.
p304
aVAnd by doing that,
p305
aVhe's interfering with the activity of this brain region
p306
aVfor about half an hour.
p307
aVAfter that everything goes back to normal, I assure you.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VSo let's see what happens.
p312
aVFirst of all, I'm going to show you
p313
aVthe average amount of bias that we see.
p314
aVSo if I was to test all of you now,
p315
aVthis is the amount that you would learn
p316
aVmore from good news relative to bad news.
p317
aVNow we interfere with the region
p318
aVthat we found to integrate negative information in this task,
p319
aVand the optimism bias grew even larger.
p320
aVWe made people more biased in the way that they process information.
p321
aVThen we interfered with the brain region
p322
aVthat we found to integrate good news in this task,
p323
aVand the optimism bias disappeared.
p324
aVWe were quite amazed by these results
p325
aVbecause we were able to eliminate
p326
aVa deep-rooted bias in humans.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves,
p329
aVwould we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits?
p330
aVIf we could do that, would we want to take people's optimism bias away?
p331
aVWell I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias,
p332
aVwhich probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life.
p333
aVBut there are, of course, pitfalls,
p334
aVand it would be really foolish of us to ignore them.
p335
aa(lp336
VTake for example this email I recieved
p337
aVfrom a firefighter here in California.
p338
aVHe says, "Fatality investigations for firefighters
p339
aVoften include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that,'
p340
aVeven when all of the available information
p341
aVwas there to make safe decisions."
p342
aVThis captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias
p343
aVto try to explain to the firefighters
p344
aVwhy they think the way they do,
p345
aVto make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior,
p348
aVto financial collapse, to faulty planning.
p349
aVThe British government, for example,
p350
aVhas acknowledged that the optimism bias
p351
aVcan make individuals more likely
p352
aVto underestimate the costs and durations of projects.
p353
aVSo they have adjusted the 2012 Olympic budget
p354
aVfor the optimism bias.
p355
aa(lp356
VMy friend who's getting married in a few weeks
p357
aVhas done the same for his wedding budget.
p358
aVAnd by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce,
p359
aVhe said he was quite sure it was zero percent.
p360
aa(lp361
VSo what we would really like to do,
p362
aVis we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism,
p363
aVbut at the same time remain hopeful,
p364
aVbenefiting from the many fruits of optimism.
p365
aVAnd I believe there's a way for us to do that.
p366
aVThe key here really is knowledge.
p367
aVWe're not born with an innate understanding of our biases.
p368
aVThese have to be identified by scientific investigation.
p369
aVBut the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias
p370
aVdoes not shatter the illusion.
p371
aVIt's like visual illusions,
p372
aVin which understanding them does not make them go away.
p373
aVAnd this is good because it means
p374
aVwe should be able to strike a balance,
p375
aVto come up with plans and rules
p376
aVto protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism,
p377
aVbut at the same time remain hopeful.
p378
aa(lp379
VI think this cartoon portrays it nicely.
p380
aVBecause if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there
p381
aVwho just does not believe they can fly,
p382
aVyou certainly never will.
p383
aVBecause to make any kind of progress,
p384
aVwe need to be able to imagine a different reality,
p385
aVand then we need to believe that that reality is possible.
p386
aVBut if you are an extreme optimistic penguin
p387
aVwho just jumps down blindly hoping for the best,
p388
aVyou might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground.
p389
aVBut if you're an optimistic penguin
p390
aVwho believes they can fly,
p391
aVbut then adjusts a parachute to your back
p392
aVjust in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned,
p393
aVyou will soar like an eagle,
p394
aVeven if you're just a penguin.
p395
aa(lp396
VThank you.

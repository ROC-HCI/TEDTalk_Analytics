VToday, I want to talk to you about dreams.
p5
aa(lp6
VI have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,
p7
aVand it's cooler than in the movies.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVBeyond flying, breathing fire,
p10
aVand making hot men spontaneously appear ...
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aVI can do things like read and write music.
p13
aVFun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college
p14
aVin a dream.
p15
aVAnd I did accepted. So, yeah.
p16
aa(lp17
VI am a very visual thinker.
p18
aVI think in pictures, not words.
p19
aVTo me, words are more like instincts and language.
p20
aa(lp21
VThere are many people like me;
p22
aVNikola Tesla, for example,
p23
aVwho could visualize, design, test, and troubleshoot everything \u2014
p24
aVall of his inventions \u2014 in his mind, accurately.
p25
aa(lp26
VLanguage is kind of exclusive to our species, anyway.
p27
aVI am a bit more primitive,
p28
aVlike a beta version of Google Translate.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VMy brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me.
p32
aVFor example, once I had an affair with calculus
p33
aVthat lasted longer than some celebrity marriages.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VThere are some other unusual things about me.
p37
aVYou may have noticed that I don't have much inflection
p38
aVin my voice.
p39
aVThat's why people often confuse me with a GPS.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVThis can make basic communication a challenge, unless you need directions.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVThank you.
p44
aV(Applause)
p45
aa(lp46
VA few years ago, when I started doing presentations,
p47
aVI went to get head shots done for the first time.
p48
aVThe photographer told me to look flirty.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVAnd I had no idea what she was talking about.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VShe said, "Do that thing, you know, with your eyes,
p54
aVwhen you're flirting with guys."
p55
aa(lp56
V"What thing?" I asked.
p57
aa(lp58
V"You know, squint."
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd so I tried, really.
p61
aVIt looked something like this.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVI looked like I was searching for Waldo.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VThere's a reason for this,
p67
aVas there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VI have Asperger's,
p71
aVa high-functioning form of autism
p72
aVthat impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display.
p73
aVIt's made life difficult in many ways,
p74
aVand growing up, I struggled to fit in socially.
p75
aVMy friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them.
p76
aVMy personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert \u2014
p77
aVand they taught me humor.
p78
aVMy personality switched from being shy and awkward
p79
aVto being defiant and cursing out a storm.
p80
aVNeedless to say, I did not have many friends.
p81
aVI was also hypersensitive to texture.
p82
aVThe feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles,
p83
aVand so for years, I refused to shower.
p84
aVI can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now, though.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VI had to do a lot to get here, and my parents \u2014
p88
aVthings kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer,
p89
aVand on top of everything, it made a difficult situation worse.
p90
aVAnd I had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment,
p91
aVbut within days of them prescribing a new medication,
p92
aVmy life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead.
p93
aVI became paranoid, and began to hallucinate
p94
aVthat rotting corpses were coming towards me.
p95
aVMy family finally rescued me,
p96
aVbut by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks,
p97
aVas well as developing severe anemia,
p98
aVand was on the verge of suicide.
p99
aa(lp100
VI transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions,
p101
aVmy trauma, and my social anxiety,
p102
aVand they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed.
p103
aVAnd after 18 months of hard work,
p104
aVI went on to do incredible things.
p105
aa(lp106
VOne of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes,
p107
aVthese people have a very complex inner life,
p108
aVand I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality,
p109
aVrich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind.
p110
aVBut there's a gap between where that stands,
p111
aVand how I communicate it with the rest of the world.
p112
aVAnd this can make basic communication a challenge.
p113
aa(lp114
VNot many places would hire me, due to my lack of social skills,
p115
aVwhich is why I applied to Waffle House.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aVWaffle House is an exceptional 24-hour diner \u2014
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aV(Applause)
p120
aVthank you \u2014
p121
aVwhere you can order your hash browns
p122
aVthe many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse ...
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVSliced, diced, peppered, chunked, topped, capped, and covered.
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aVAs social norms would have it,
p127
aVyou should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVSo one time, at 2 am, I was chatting with a waitress, and I asked her,
p130
aV"What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job?"
p131
aVAnd she told me that one time, a man walked in completely naked.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVI said, "Great! Sign me up for the graveyard shift!"
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVNeedless to say, Waffle House did not hire me.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo in terms of having Asperger's, it can be viewed as a disadvantage,
p138
aVand sometimes it is a real pain in the butt,
p139
aVbut it's also the opposite.
p140
aVIt's a gift, and it allows me to think innovatively.
p141
aVAt 19, I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs,
p142
aVand I ended up speaking
p143
aVat the UN Convention of Biological Diversity,
p144
aVpresenting this research.
p145
aV(Applause)
p146
aVThank you.
p147
aV(Applause)
p148
aVAnd at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college,
p149
aVand I am a co-founder of a biotech company called AutismSees.
p150
aV(Applause)
p151
aVThank you.
p152
aV(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VBut consider what I had to do to get here:
p155
aV25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses, and years of pain and trauma.
p156
aVI spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way,
p157
aVand I think there is: autism-assistive technology.
p158
aVThis technology could play an integral role
p159
aVin helping people with autistic spectrum disorder,
p160
aVor ASD.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe app Podium, released by my company, AutismSees,
p163
aVhas the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills.
p164
aVIn addition to this, it tracks eye contact through camera
p165
aVand simulates a public-speaking and job-interview experience.
p166
aVAnd so maybe one day, Waffle House will hire me,
p167
aVafter practicing on it some more.
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aVAnd one of the great things is that I've used Podium
p170
aVto help me prepare for today, and it's been a great help.
p171
aVBut it's more than that.
p172
aVThere's more that can be done.
p173
aVFor people with ASD \u2014
p174
aVit has been speculated that many innovative scientists,
p175
aVresearchers, artists, and engineers have it;
p176
aVlike, for example, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates
p177
aVare some examples.
p178
aVBut the problem that's encountered
p179
aVis that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared
p180
aVif there are communication roadblocks.
p181
aVAnd so, many people with autism are being overlooked every day,
p182
aVand they're being taken advantage of.
p183
aVSo my dream for people with autism is to change that,
p184
aVto remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding.
p185
aa(lp186
VOne of the reasons I love lucid dreaming
p187
aVis because it allows me to be free,
p188
aVwithout judgment of social and physical consequences.
p189
aVWhen I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind,
p190
aVI am at peace.
p191
aVI am free from judgment,
p192
aVand so I can do whatever I want, you know?
p193
aVI'm making out with Brad Pitt, and Angelina is totally cool with it.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VBut the goal of autism-assistive technology is bigger than that,
p197
aVand more important.
p198
aVMy goal is to shift people's perspective
p199
aVof autism and people with higher-functioning Asperger's
p200
aVbecause there is a lot they can do.
p201
aVI mean, look at Temple Grandin, for example.
p202
aVAnd by doing so, we allow people to share their talents with this world
p203
aVand move this world forward.
p204
aVIn addition, we give them the courage to pursue their dreams
p205
aVin the real world, in real time.
p206
aa(lp207
VThank you.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VThank you.

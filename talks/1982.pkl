VThe Earth needs no introduction.
p5
aVIt needs no introduction in part  because the Apollo 17 astronauts,
p6
aVwhen they were hurtling  around the moon in 1972,
p7
aVtook this iconic image.
p8
aVIt galvanized a whole  generation of human beings
p9
aVto realize that we're on  Spaceship Earth,
p10
aVfragile and finite as it is,
p11
aVand that we need  to take care of it.
p12
aVBut while this picture is beautiful, it's static,
p13
aVand the Earth is constantly changing.
p14
aVIt's changing on days' time scales with human activity.
p15
aVAnd the satellite imagery we  have of it today is old.
p16
aVTypically, years old.
p17
aVAnd that's important because you can't fix what you can't see.
p18
aVWhat we'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day.
p19
aVSo, what's standing in our way?
p20
aa(lp21
VWhat's the problem?
p22
aVThis is the problem:
p23
aVSatellites are big, expensive  and they're slow.
p24
aVThis one weighs three tons.
p25
aVIt's six meters tall, four meters wide.
p26
aVIt took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it.
p27
aVOne satellite, one rocket.
p28
aVIt cost 855 million dollars.
p29
aVSatellites like these have  done an amazing job
p30
aVat helping us to understand our planet.
p31
aVBut if we want to understand  it much more regularly,
p32
aVwe need lots of satellites,
p33
aVand this model isn't scalable.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo me and my friends,  we started Planet Labs
p36
aVto make satellites ultra-compact
p37
aVand small and highly capable.
p38
aVI'm going to show you what  our satellite looks like:
p39
aVThis is our satellite.
p40
aa(lp41
VThis is not a scale model,
p42
aVthis is the real size.
p43
aVIt's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters,
p44
aVit weighs four kilograms,
p45
aVand we've stuffed the latest  and greatest electronics
p46
aVand sensor systems into  this little package
p47
aVso that even though this is really small,
p48
aVthis can take pictures 10 times the resolution of the big satellite here,
p49
aVeven though it weighs one  thousandth of the mass.
p50
aVAnd we call this satellite  "Dove" \u2014 Thank you.
p51
aV(Applause)
p52
aVWe call this satellite "Dove,"
p53
aVand we call it "Dove" because  satellites are typically named
p54
aVafter birds, but normally birds of prey:
p55
aVlike Eagle, Hawk, Swoop,  Kill, I don't know,
p56
aVKestrel, these sort of things.
p57
aVBut ours have a  humanitarian mission,
p58
aVso we wanted to call them Doves.
p59
aVAnd we haven't just  built them, though.
p60
aVWe've launched them.
p61
aVAnd not just one, but many.
p62
aa(lp63
VIt all started in our garage.
p64
aVYes, we built our first satellite prototype in our garage.
p65
aVNow, this is pretty normal for a Silicon Valley company that we are,
p66
aVbut we believe it's the first time  for a space company.
p67
aVAnd that's not the only trick we learned from Silicon Valley.
p68
aVWe rapidly prototype our satellites.
p69
aVWe use "release early,  release often" on our software.
p70
aVAnd we take a different  risk approach.
p71
aVWe take them outside and test them.
p72
aVWe even put satellites in space just to test the satellites,
p73
aVand we've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale.
p74
aVWe've used modern production techniques
p75
aVso we can build large numbers of them,
p76
aVI think for the first time.
p77
aVWe call it agile aerospace,
p78
aVand that's what's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, what has bonded  our team over the years
p81
aVis the idea of democratizing access to satellite information.
p82
aVIn fact, the founders of our  company, Chris, Robbie and I,
p83
aVwe met over 15 years ago  at the United Nations
p84
aVwhen they were hosting a conference  about exactly that question:
p85
aVHow do you use satellites  to help humanity?
p86
aVHow do you use satellites to help  people in developing countries
p87
aVor with climate change?
p88
aVAnd this is what has bonded us.
p89
aVOur entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity.
p90
aVYou could say  we're space geeks,
p91
aVbut not only do we care  about what's up there,
p92
aVwe care about what's down here, too.
p93
aa(lp94
VI'm going to show you a video
p95
aVfrom just four weeks ago  of two of our satellites
p96
aVbeing launched from the International Space Station.
p97
aVThis is not an animation,
p98
aVthis is a video taken by the astronaut  looking out of the window.
p99
aVIt gives you a bit of a sense of  scale of our two satellites.
p100
aVIt's like some of the  smallest satellites ever
p101
aVare being launched from  the biggest satellite ever.
p102
aVAnd right at the end, the solar array glints in the sun.
p103
aVIt's really cool. Wait for it.
p104
aVBoom! Yeah. It's the money shot.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VSo we didn't just launch  two of them like this,
p108
aVwe launched 28 of them.
p109
aVIt's the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites in human history,
p110
aVand it's going to provide a completely radical new data set
p111
aVabout our changing planet.
p112
aVBut that's just the beginning.
p113
aVYou see, we're going to launch more than 100 of these satellites
p114
aVlike these over the  course of the next year.
p115
aVIt's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history.
p116
aVAnd this is what it's going to do:
p117
aVActing in a single-orbit plane that  stays fixed with respect to the sun,
p118
aVthe Earth rotates underneath.
p119
aVThey're all cameras pointed down,
p120
aVand they slowly scan across as  the Earth rotates underneath.
p121
aVThe Earth rotates every 24 hours,
p122
aVso we scan every point on the  planet every 24 hours.
p123
aVIt's a line scanner for the planet.
p124
aVWe don't take a picture of  anywhere on the planet every day,
p125
aVwe take a picture of every single place on the planet every day.
p126
aVEven though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago,
p127
aVwe've already got some initial imagery from the satellites
p128
aVand I'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now.
p129
aVThis is the very first picture taken by our satellite.
p130
aVIt happened to be over  UC-Davis' campus
p131
aVin California when we  turned the camera on.
p132
aVBut what's even cooler is when
p133
aVwe compare it to the previous latest image of that area,
p134
aVwhich was taken many months ago.
p135
aVAnd the image on the left  is from our satellite,
p136
aVand we see buildings are being built.
p137
aVThe general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens
p138
aVaround the whole world in all cities, every day.
p139
aa(lp140
VWater as well.
p141
aa(lp142
VThank you.
p143
aV(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VWe'll be able to see  the extent of all water bodies
p146
aVaround the whole world every day and help water security.
p147
aVFrom water security  to food security.
p148
aVWe'll see crops as they  grow in all the fields
p149
aVin every farmer's field around the planet every day.
p150
aVand help them to improve crop yield.
p151
aVThis is a beautiful image that was taken
p152
aVjust a few hours ago when the  satellite was flying over Argentina.
p153
aVThe general point is
p154
aVthere are probably hundreds and  thousands of applications of this data,
p155
aVI've mentioned a few, but there's others:
p156
aVdeforestation, the ice caps melting.
p157
aVWe can track all of these things, every tree on the planet every day.
p158
aVIf you took the difference between today's image and yesterday's image,
p159
aVyou'd see much of the world news \u2014 you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes.
p160
aVAnd we have decided, therefore, that the  best thing that we could do with our data
p161
aVis to ensure universal access to it.
p162
aVWe want to ensure everyone can see it.
p163
aVThank you. (Applause)
p164
aVWe want to empower NGOs and  companies and scientists and journalists
p165
aVto be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet.
p166
aVWe want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data.
p167
aVIn short, we want to democratize access to information about our planet.
p168
aa(lp169
VWhich brings me back to this.
p170
aVYou see, this will be an entirely new global data set.
p171
aVAnd we believe that together,
p172
aVwe can help to take care  of our Spaceship Earth.
p173
aVAnd what I would like to leave you with is the following question:
p174
aVIf you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day,
p175
aVwhat would you do with that data?
p176
aVWhat problems would you solve?
p177
aVWhat exploration would you do?
p178
aVWell, I invite you to come and explore with us.
p179
aa(lp180
VThank you very much.

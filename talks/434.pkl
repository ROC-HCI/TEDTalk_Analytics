VI'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on
p5
aVin the very fabric of the modern economy.
p6
aVAnd to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning,
p7
aVbecause in the beginning were commodities.
p8
aVCommodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground:
p9
aVbasically, animal, mineral, vegetable.
p10
aVAnd then you extract them out of the ground,
p11
aVand sell them on the open marketplace.
p12
aVCommodities were the basis of the agrarian economy
p13
aVthat lasted for millennia.
p14
aVBut then along came the industrial revolution,
p15
aVand then goods became the predominant economic offering,
p16
aVwhere we used commodities as a raw material
p17
aVto be able to make or manufacture goods.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.
p20
aVWell, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years,
p21
aVis that goods have become commoditized.
p22
aVCommoditized: where they're treated like a commodity,
p23
aVwhere people don't care who makes them.
p24
aVThey just care about three things and three things only:
p25
aVprice, price and price.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, there's an antidote to commoditization,
p28
aVand that is customization.
p29
aVMy first book was called "Mass Customization" \u2014
p30
aVit came up a couple of times yesterday \u2014
p31
aVand how I discovered this progression of economic value
p32
aVwas realizing that customizing a good
p33
aVautomatically turned it into a service,
p34
aVbecause it was done just for a particular person,
p35
aVbecause it wasn't inventoried,
p36
aVit was delivered on demand to that individual person.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.
p39
aVBut over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is that
p40
aVservices are being commoditized as well.
p41
aVLong-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;
p42
aVfast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;
p43
aVand even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods,
p44
aVbut services as well.
p45
aVWhat that means is that it's time
p46
aVto move to a new level of economic value.
p47
aVTime to go beyond the goods and the services,
p48
aVand use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?
p49
aVWhat happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person \u2014
p50
aVthat's exactly what they need at this moment in time?
p51
aVThen you can't help but make them go "wow";
p52
aVyou can't help but turn it into a memorable event \u2014
p53
aVyou can't help but turn it into an experience.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo we're shifting to an experience economy,
p56
aVwhere experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.
p57
aVNow most places that I talk to,
p58
aVwhen I talk about experience, I talk about Disney \u2014
p59
aVthe world's premier experience-stager.
p60
aVI talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail,
p61
aVand boutique hotels, and Las Vegas \u2014
p62
aVthe experience capital of the world.
p63
aVBut here, when you think about experiences,
p64
aVthink about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.
p65
aVThink about meaningful places.
p66
aVThink about drinking wine,
p67
aVabout a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.
p68
aVThose are all experiences. Think about TED itself.
p69
aVThe experience capital in the world of conferences.
p70
aVAll of these are experiences.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe,
p73
aVand particularly in the Netherlands,
p74
aVand whenever I talk about the experience economy there,
p75
aVI'm always greeted at the end with one particular question,
p76
aValmost invariably.
p77
aVAnd the question isn't really so much a question
p78
aVas an accusation.
p79
aVAnd the Dutch, when they usually put it,
p80
aVit always starts with the same two words.
p81
aVYou know the words I mean?
p82
aVYou Americans.
p83
aVThey say, you Americans.
p84
aVYou like your fantasy environments,
p85
aVyour fake, your Disneyland experiences.
p86
aVThey say, we Dutch, we like real,
p87
aVnatural, authentic experiences.
p88
aVSo much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response,
p89
aVwhich is: I point out that first of all,
p90
aVyou have to understand that there is no such thing
p91
aVas an inauthentic experience.
p92
aVWhy? Because the experience happens inside of us.
p93
aVIt's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.
p94
aVSo, as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings,
p95
aVthen every experience we have is authentic.
p96
aVNow, there may be more or less natural or artificial
p97
aVstimuli for the experience,
p98
aVbut even that is a matter of degree, not kind.
p99
aVAnd there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.
p100
aVEven if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods,
p101
aVthere is a company that manufactured the car
p102
aVthat delivered you to the edge of the woods;
p103
aVthere's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have
p104
aVto protect yourself from the ground of the woods.
p105
aVThere's a company that provides a cell phone service you have
p106
aVin case you get lost in the woods.
p107
aVRight? All of those are man-made,
p108
aVartificiality brought into the woods by you,
p109
aVand by the very nature of being there.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd then I always finish off
p112
aVby talking about \u2014 the thing that amazes me the most about this question,
p113
aVparticularly coming from the Dutch,
p114
aVis that the Netherlands
p115
aVis every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aVAnd the Dutch, they always go ...
p118
aVand they realize, I'm right!
p119
aVThere isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country
p120
aVthat hasn't been reclaimed from the sea,
p121
aVor otherwise moved, modified and manicured
p122
aVto look as if it had always been there.
p123
aVIt's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VBut nonetheless, not just the Dutch,
p127
aVbut everyone has this desire for the authentic.
p128
aVAnd authenticity is therefore
p129
aVbecoming the new consumer sensibility \u2014
p130
aVthe buying criteria by which consumers
p131
aVare choosing who are they going to buy from,
p132
aVand what they're going to buy.
p133
aVBecoming the basis of the economy.
p134
aVIn fact, you can look at how each of these economies developed,
p135
aVthat each one has their own business imperative,
p136
aVmatched with a consumer sensibility.
p137
aVWe're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.
p138
aVIt's about supply and availability.
p139
aVGetting the commodities to market.
p140
aa(lp141
VWith the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs \u2014
p142
aVgetting the costs down as low as possible
p143
aVso we can offer them to the masses.
p144
aVWith the service economy, it is about
p145
aVimproving quality.
p146
aVThat has \u2014 the whole quality movement has risen
p147
aVwith the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd now, with the experience economy,
p150
aVit's about rendering authenticity.
p151
aVRendering authenticity \u2014 and the keyword is "rendering."
p152
aVRight? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers \u2014
p153
aVas business people \u2014
p154
aVto percieve your offerings as authentic.
p155
aVBecause there is a basic paradox:
p156
aVno one can have an inauthentic experience,
p157
aVbut no business can supply one.
p158
aVBecause all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money;
p159
aVall business is a matter of using machinery,
p160
aVand all those things make something inauthentic.
p161
aVSo, how do you render authenticity,
p162
aVis the question.
p163
aVAre you rendering authenticity?
p164
aa(lp165
VWhen you think about that, let me go back to
p166
aVwhat Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity,
p167
aV"Sincerity and Authenticity" \u2014 came out in 1960 \u2014
p168
aVpoints to as the seminal point
p169
aVat which authenticity entered the lexicon,
p170
aVif you will.
p171
aVAnd that is, to no surprise, in Shakespeare,
p172
aVand in his play, Hamlet.
p173
aVAnd there is one part in this play, Hamlet,
p174
aVwhere the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet, Polonius,
p175
aVsays something profoundly real.
p176
aVAt the end of a laundry list of advice
p177
aVhe's giving to his son, Laertes,
p178
aVhe says this:
p179
aVAnd this above all: to thine own self be true.
p180
aVAnd it doth follow, as night the day,
p181
aVthat thou canst not then be false to any man.
p182
aVAnd those three verses are the core of authenticity.
p183
aVThere are two dimensions to authenticity:
p184
aVone, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.
p185
aVTwo, is other-directed:
p186
aVbeing what you say you are to others.
p187
aVAnd I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions,
p188
aVI immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!
p189
aVAll right? Anybody else like that, no?
p190
aVWell, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get
p191
aVa two-by-two.
p192
aVWhere, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.
p193
aVAs businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing \u2014
p194
aVare they true to themselves?
p195
aVAnd the other dimension is:
p196
aVare they what they say they are to others?
p197
aVIf not, you have,
p198
aV"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,"
p199
aVyielding a two-by-two matrix.
p200
aVAnd of course, if you are both true to yourself,
p201
aVand are what you say you are, then you're real real!
p202
aV(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VThe opposite, of course, is \u2014 fake fake.
p205
aVAll right, now, there is value for fake.
p206
aVThere will always be companies around to supply the fake,
p207
aVbecause there will always be desire for the fake.
p208
aVFact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake;
p209
aVif you do like it, it's faux.
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, the other two sides of the coin are:
p213
aVbeing a real fake \u2014
p214
aVis what it says it is,
p215
aVbut is not true to itself,
p216
aVor being a fake real:
p217
aVis true to itself, but not what it says it is.
p218
aVYou can think about those two \u2014 you know, both of these
p219
aVbetter than being fake fake \u2014 not quite as good as being real real.
p220
aVYou can contrast them by thinking about
p221
aVUniversal City Walk versus
p222
aVDisney World, or Disneyland.
p223
aVUniversal City Walk is a real fake \u2014
p224
aVin fact, we got this very term
p225
aVfrom Ada Louise Huxtable's book, "The Unreal America."
p226
aVA wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as \u2014
p227
aVyou know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake,
p228
aVright, because you can see behind the facade, right?
p229
aVIt is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio;
p230
aVit's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot.
p231
aVRight? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles,
p232
aVwell, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot,
p233
aVoutside in this city.
p234
aVBut is it really true to itself?
p235
aVRight? Is it really in the city?
p236
aVIs it \u2014
p237
aVyou can see behind all of it,
p238
aVand see what is going on in the facades of it.
p239
aVSo she calls it a real fake.
p240
aa(lp241
VDisney World, on the other hand, is a fake real,
p242
aVor a fake reality.
p243
aVRight? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aVBut it is \u2014 oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to \u2014
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aV\u2014 sorry.
p248
aVWe won't talk about Santa Claus then.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVBut Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.
p251
aVRight? Just wonderfully true to itself.
p252
aVWhen you are there you are just immersed
p253
aVin this wonderful environment.
p254
aVSo, it's a fake real.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow the easiest way
p257
aVto fall down in this,
p258
aVand not be real real,
p259
aVright, the easiest way not to be true to yourself
p260
aVis not to understand your heritage,
p261
aVand thereby repudiate that heritage.
p262
aVRight, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.
p263
aVKnowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.
p264
aVAnd what you have done in the past limits what you can do,
p265
aVwhat you can get away with, essentially, in the future.
p266
aVSo, you have to understand that past.
p267
aa(lp268
VThink about Disney again.
p269
aVDisney,
p270
aV10 or 15 years ago, right,
p271
aVthe Disney \u2014 the company that is probably
p272
aVbest-known for family values out there,
p273
aVDisney bought the ABC network.
p274
aVThe ABC network, affectionately known in the trade
p275
aVas the T&A network, right \u2014
p276
aVthat's not too much jargon, is it?
p277
aVRight, the T&A network. Then it bought Miramax,
p278
aVknown for its NC-17 fare,
p279
aVand all of a sudden, families everywhere
p280
aVcouldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.
p281
aVIt was no longer true to its heritage;
p282
aVno longer true to Walt Disney.
p283
aVThat's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today,
p284
aVand why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.
p285
aVBecause it is no longer true to itself.
p286
aVSo, understand what \u2014 your past limits what you can do in the future.
p287
aa(lp288
VWhen it comes to being what you say you are, the easiest mistake that companies make
p289
aVis that they advertise
p290
aVthings that they are not.
p291
aVThat's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company \u2014
p292
aVadvertizing things that you're not.
p293
aVThink about any hotel, any airline,
p294
aVany hospital.
p295
aVRight, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience.
p296
aV(Laughter)
p297
aVBut unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel,
p298
aVairline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect.
p299
aVThen you have that perception that you are phony.
p300
aVSo, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are,
p301
aVis to provide places for people to experience
p302
aVwho you are.
p303
aVFor people to experience who you are.
p304
aVRight, it's not advertising does it.
p305
aa(lp306
VThat's why you have companies like Starbucks,
p307
aVright, that doesn't advertise at all.
p308
aVThey said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.
p309
aVAnd think about the economic value they have provided
p310
aVby that experience.
p311
aVRight? Coffee, at its core, is what?
p312
aVRight? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.
p313
aVYou know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?
p314
aVTwo or three cents per cup \u2014 that's what coffee is worth.
p315
aVBut grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf,
p316
aVand now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents,
p317
aVwhen you treat it as a good.
p318
aVTake that same good,
p319
aVand perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer,
p320
aVin a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere,
p321
aVyou get 50 cents, maybe a buck
p322
aVper cup of coffee.
p323
aVBut surround the brewing of that coffee
p324
aVwith the ambiance of a Starbucks,
p325
aVwith the authentic cedar that goes inside of there,
p326
aVand now, because of that authentic experience,
p327
aVyou can charge two, three, four, five dollars
p328
aVfor a cup of coffee.
p329
aVSo, authenticity is becoming
p330
aVthe new consumer sensibility.
p331
aa(lp332
VLet me summarize it, for the business people in the audience,
p333
aVwith three rules, three basic rules.
p334
aVOne, don't say you're authentic
p335
aVunless you really are authentic.
p336
aVTwo, it's easier to be authentic
p337
aVif you don't say you're authentic.
p338
aVAnd three, if you say you're authentic,
p339
aVyou better be authentic.
p340
aVAnd then for the consumers, for everyone else in the audience,
p341
aVlet me simply summarize it by saying, increasingly,
p342
aVwhat we \u2014 what will make us happy,
p343
aVis spending our time and our money
p344
aVsatisfying the desire for authenticity.
p345
aVThank you.

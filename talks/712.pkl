VI'm going to show you how terrorism
p5
aVactually interacts with our daily life.
p6
aV15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.
p7
aVAt the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners
p8
aVin Italian jails.
p9
aVHe asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.
p10
aVNow, as many of you may remember,
p11
aVthe Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization
p12
aVwhich was very active in Italy
p13
aVfrom the 1960s until the mid-1980s.
p14
aVAs part of their strategy
p15
aVthe Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.
p16
aVThey sat in silence through their trails,
p17
aVwaving occasionally at family and friends.
p18
aa(lp19
VIn 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.
p20
aVAnd they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,
p21
aVand tell their story.
p22
aVAnd I was one of those people.
p23
aVWhen I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,
p24
aVhe said that the female members of the organization
p25
aVhad actually supported my name.
p26
aVIn particular, one person had put it forward.
p27
aVShe was my childhood friend.
p28
aVShe had joined the Red Brigades
p29
aVand became a leader of the organization.
p30
aa(lp31
VNaturally, I didn't know that
p32
aVuntil the day she was arrested.
p33
aVIn fact, I read it in the newspaper.
p34
aVAt the time of the phone call
p35
aVI just had a baby,
p36
aVI successfully completed a management buyout
p37
aVto the company I was working with,
p38
aVand the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home
p39
aVand touring the high-security prisons.
p40
aVBut this is exactly what I did
p41
aVbecause I wanted to know
p42
aVwhat had turned my best friend
p43
aVinto a terrorist,
p44
aVand why she'd never tried to recruit me.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aV(Applause)
p47
aa(lp48
VSo, this is exactly what I did.
p49
aVNow, I found the answer very quickly.
p50
aVI actually had failed
p51
aVthe psychological profiling of a terrorist.
p52
aVThe center committee of the Red Brigades
p53
aVhad judged me too single-minded
p54
aVand too opinionated to become a good terrorist.
p55
aVMy friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist
p56
aVbecause she was very good at following orders.
p57
aVShe also embraced violence.
p58
aVBecause she believed that the only way
p59
aVto unblock what, at the time,
p60
aVwas known as a blocked democracy,
p61
aVItaly, a country run by the same party for 35 years
p62
aVwas the arms struggle.
p63
aa(lp64
VAt the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades,
p65
aVI also discovered that their life was not ruled
p66
aVby politics or ideology,
p67
aVbut actually was ruled by economics.
p68
aVThey were constantly short of cash.
p69
aVThey were constantly searching for cash.
p70
aVNow, contrary to what many people believe,
p71
aVterrorism is actually a very expensive business.
p72
aVI'll give you an idea.
p73
aVIn the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades
p74
aVon a yearly basis
p75
aVwas seven million dollars.
p76
aVThis is roughly between 100
p77
aVand 150 million, today.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, you know, if you live underground
p80
aVit's really hard to produce this amount of money.
p81
aVBut this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,
p82
aVand then, later on, other arms organizations,
p83
aVincluding members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,
p84
aVeverybody was extremely reluctant
p85
aVto talk about ideology, or politics.
p86
aVBecause they had no idea.
p87
aVThe political vision of a terrorist organization
p88
aVis decided by the leadership,
p89
aVwhich, generally, is never more than five to seven people.
p90
aVAll the others do, day in and day out,
p91
aVis search for money.
p92
aa(lp93
VOnce, for example, I was interviewing
p94
aVthis part-timer from the Red Brigades.
p95
aVIt was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.
p96
aVHe was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.
p97
aVAnd he told me that the best time of his life
p98
aVwas when he was a member of the Red Brigades
p99
aVand he went sailing, every summer, back and forth
p100
aVfrom Lebanon, where he would pick up
p101
aVSoviet weapons from the PLO,
p102
aVand then carry them all the way to Sardinia
p103
aVwhere the other arms organization from Europe would go
p104
aVand take their share of the arms.
p105
aVFor that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,
p106
aVwhich went to fund their organization.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo, because I am a trained economist
p109
aVand I think in economic terms,
p110
aVall of the sudden I thought,
p111
aVmaybe there is something here.
p112
aVMaybe there is a link, a commercial link,
p113
aVbetween one organization and another one.
p114
aVBut it was only when I interviewed
p115
aVMario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,
p116
aVthe man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,
p117
aVItalian former prime minister,
p118
aVthat I finally realized
p119
aVthat terrorism is actually business.
p120
aVI was having lunch with him
p121
aVin a high-security prison in Italy.
p122
aVAnd as we were eating,
p123
aVI had the distinct feeling
p124
aVthat I was back in the city of London,
p125
aVhaving lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.
p126
aVThis guy thought in the same way I did.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.
p129
aVNaturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.
p130
aVIn fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.
p131
aVYou know, that woman that goes around to foundations
p132
aVasking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.
p133
aVSo, in the end, I took a decision
p134
aVthat, in retrospect, did change my life.
p135
aVI sold my company,
p136
aVand funded the research myself.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd what I discovered
p139
aVis this parallel reality,
p140
aVanother international economic system,
p141
aVwhich runs parallel to our own,
p142
aVwhich has been created by arms organizations
p143
aVsince the end of World War II.
p144
aVAnd what is even more shocking
p145
aVis that this system
p146
aVhas followed, step by step, the evolution
p147
aVof our own system,
p148
aVof our Western capitalism.
p149
aVAnd there are three main stages.
p150
aVThe first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.
p151
aa(lp152
VThe second one is the privatization of terrorism.
p153
aVAnd the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.
p154
aVSo, state sponsor of terrorism,
p155
aVfeature of the Cold War.
p156
aVThis is when the two superpowers were fighting
p157
aVa war by proxy,
p158
aValong the periphery of the sphere of influence,
p159
aVfully funding arms organizations.
p160
aVA mix of legal and illegal activities is used.
p161
aVSo, the link between crime and terror
p162
aVis established very early on.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd here is the best example,
p165
aVthe Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,
p166
aVlegally funded by the U.S. Congress,
p167
aVillegally funded by the Reagan administration
p168
aVvia covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.
p169
aVThen comes the late 1970s, early '80s,
p170
aVand some groups successfully carry out
p171
aVthe privatization of terrorism.
p172
aVSo, they gain independence from the sponsor,
p173
aVand start funding themselves.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.
p176
aVSo, Arafat used to get a percentage
p177
aVof the smuggling of hashish
p178
aVfrom Bekáa Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.
p179
aVAnd the IRA, which control the private transportation system
p180
aVin Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.
p181
aVSo, every single time
p182
aVthat somebody got into a taxi in Belfast
p183
aVwithout knowing, actually,
p184
aVwas funding the IRA.
p185
aa(lp186
VBut the great change came, of course,
p187
aVwith globalization and deregulation.
p188
aVThis is when arms organization were able to link up,
p189
aValso financially, with each other.
p190
aVBut above all, they started to do
p191
aVserious business with the world of crime.
p192
aVAnd together they money-laundered
p193
aVtheir dirty business through the same channel.
p194
aVThis is when we see the birth of the transnational
p195
aVarms organization Al Qaeda.
p196
aVThis is an organization that can raise money across border.
p197
aVBut also that is able to carry out attacks
p198
aVin more than one country.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, deregulation also brought back
p201
aVrogue economics.
p202
aVSo what is rogue economics?
p203
aVRogue economics is a force which is constantly
p204
aVlurking in the background of history.
p205
aVIt comes back at times of great transformation,
p206
aVglobalization being one of those transformations.
p207
aVIt is at this times in which
p208
aVpolitics actually loses control of the economy,
p209
aVand the economy becomes a rogue force
p210
aVworking against us.
p211
aVIt has happened before in history.
p212
aVIt has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.
p213
aVIt has happened with Industrial Revolution.
p214
aVAnd it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, I calculated how big was this international
p217
aVeconomic system composed by crime,
p218
aVterror, and illegal economy,
p219
aVbefore 9-11.
p220
aVAnd it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.
p221
aVIt is trillions, it's not billions.
p222
aVThis is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,
p223
aVsoon will be more,
p224
aVconsidering where this country is going.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, until 9-11,
p228
aVthe bulk of all this money
p229
aVflew into the U.S. economy
p230
aVbecause the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars
p231
aVand the money laundering was taking place
p232
aVinside the United States.
p233
aVThe entry point, of course, of most of this money
p234
aVwere the off-shore facilities.
p235
aVSo, this was a vital injection of cash
p236
aVinto the U.S. economy.
p237
aVNow, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,
p238
aVthe U.S. money supply is the amount
p239
aVof dollars that the Federal Reserve
p240
aVprints every year
p241
aVin order to satisfy
p242
aVthe increase in the demand for dollars,
p243
aVwhich, of course, reflects the growth
p244
aVof the economy.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s
p247
aVa growing number of these dollars
p248
aVwas actually leaving the United States,
p249
aVnever to come back.
p250
aVThese were money taken out
p251
aVin suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.
p252
aVThese were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.
p253
aVThese were money taken out to fund
p254
aVthe growth of the terror,
p255
aVillegal and criminal economy.
p256
aVSo, you see, what is the relationship?
p257
aa(lp258
VThe United States actually is a country
p259
aVthat is the reserve currency of the world.
p260
aVWhat does it mean? That means that
p261
aVit has a privilege that other countries do not have.
p262
aVIt can borrow against the total amount of dollars
p263
aVin circulation in the world.
p264
aVThis privilege is called seigniorage.
p265
aVNo other country can do that.
p266
aVAll the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,
p267
aVcan borrow only against the amount of money
p268
aVin circulation inside its own borders.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo, here is the implication of the relationship
p271
aVbetween the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.
p272
aVThe U.S. in the 1990s
p273
aVwas borrowing against the growth
p274
aVof the terror, illegal and criminal economy.
p275
aVThis is how close we are with this world.
p276
aVNow, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,
p277
aVbecause George Bush launched the War on Terror.
p278
aVPart of the War on Terror
p279
aVwas the introduction of the Patriot Act.
p280
aVNow, many of you know that the Patriot Act
p281
aVis a legislation that greatly reduces
p282
aVthe liberties of Americans in order to protect them
p283
aVagainst terrorism.
p284
aa(lp285
VBut there is a section of the Patriot Act
p286
aVwhich refers specifically to finance.
p287
aVAnd it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.
p288
aVWhat the Patriot Act did was
p289
aVto prohibit U.S. bank,
p290
aVand U.S.-registered foreign banks
p291
aVfrom doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.
p292
aVIt closed that door between the money laundering
p293
aVin dollars, and the U.S. economy.
p294
aVIt also gave the U.S. monetary authorities
p295
aVthe right to monitor any dollar transaction
p296
aVtaking place anywhere in the world.
p297
aa(lp298
VNow, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international
p299
aVfinance and banking.
p300
aVAll the bankers said to their clients,
p301
aV"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else."
p302
aVNow, the Euro was a newly born currency
p303
aVof great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.
p304
aVAnd this is what people did.
p305
aVNobody wants the U.S. monetary authority
p306
aVto check their relationship,
p307
aVto monitor their relationship with their clientele.
p308
aVThe same thing happened, of course,
p309
aVin the world of crime and terror.
p310
aVPeople simply moved their money-laundering activities
p311
aVaway from the United States
p312
aVinto Europe.
p313
aa(lp314
VWhy did this happen? This happened because
p315
aVthe Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.
p316
aVIt was introduced only in the United States.
p317
aVAnd it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.
p318
aVIn Europe, a similar legislation
p319
aVwas not introduced.
p320
aVSo, within six months
p321
aVEurope became the epicenter
p322
aVof the money-laundering activities
p323
aVof the world.
p324
aVSo, this is how incredible are the relationship
p325
aVbetween the world of crime
p326
aVand the world of terror,
p327
aVand our own life.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo, why did I tell you this story?
p330
aVI told you this story because you
p331
aVmust understand that there is a world
p332
aVthat goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,
p333
aVincluding the personal relationship that you have
p334
aVwith friends and family.
p335
aVYou got to question everything that is told to you,
p336
aVincluding what I just told you today.
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aVThis is the only way for you
p339
aVto step into the dark side, and have a look at it.
p340
aVAnd believe me,
p341
aVit's going to be scary.
p342
aVIt's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.
p343
aVAnd, above all, it's not going to be boring.
p344

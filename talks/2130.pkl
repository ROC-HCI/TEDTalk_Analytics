VWhat has the War on Drugs  done to the world?
p5
aVLook at the murder and mayhem in Mexico,
p6
aVCentral America, so many  other parts of the planet,
p7
aVthe global black market estimated
p8
aVat 300 billion dollars a year,
p9
aVprisons packed in the  United States and elsewhere,
p10
aVpolice and military drawn  into an unwinnable war
p11
aVthat violates basic rights,  and ordinary citizens
p12
aVjust hope they don't get  caught in the crossfire,
p13
aVand meanwhile, more people using
p14
aVmore drugs than ever.
p15
aVIt's my country's history  with alcohol prohibition
p16
aVand Al Capone, times 50.
p17
aa(lp18
VWhich is why it's  particularly galling to me
p19
aVas an American that we've  been the driving force
p20
aVbehind this global drug war.
p21
aVAsk why so many countries criminalize
p22
aVdrugs they'd never heard of,
p23
aVwhy the U.N. drug treaties emphasize
p24
aVcriminalization over health,
p25
aVeven why most of the money worldwide
p26
aVfor dealing with drug abuse goes not
p27
aVto helping agencies but those that punish,
p28
aVand you'll find the good old U.S. of A.
p29
aa(lp30
VWhy did we do this?
p31
aVSome people, especially in Latin America,
p32
aVthink it's not really about drugs.
p33
aVIt's just a subterfuge for advancing
p34
aVthe realpolitik interests of the U.S.
p35
aVBut by and large, that's not it.
p36
aVWe don't want gangsters and guerrillas
p37
aVfunded with illegal drug money
p38
aVterrorizing and taking over other nations.
p39
aVNo, the fact is, America really is crazy
p40
aVwhen it comes to drugs.
p41
aVI mean, don't forget, we're  the ones who thought
p42
aVthat we could prohibit alcohol.
p43
aVSo think about our global drug war
p44
aVnot as any sort of rational policy,
p45
aVbut as the international projection
p46
aVof a domestic psychosis.
p47
aV(Applause)
p48
aa(lp49
VBut here's the good news.
p50
aVNow it's the Russians leading the Drug War and not us.
p51
aVMost politicians in my country
p52
aVwant to roll back the Drug War now,
p53
aVput fewer people behind bars, not more,
p54
aVand I'm proud to say as an American
p55
aVthat we now lead the world
p56
aVin reforming marijuana policies.
p57
aVIt's now legal for medical purposes
p58
aVin almost half our 50 states,
p59
aVmillions of people can  purchase their marijuana,
p60
aVtheir medicine, in government- licensed dispensaries,
p61
aVand over half my fellow  citizens now say it's time
p62
aVto legally regulate and tax marijuana
p63
aVmore or less like alcohol.
p64
aVThat's what Colorado and  Washington are doing,
p65
aVand Uruguay, and others  are sure to follow.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo that's what I do:
p68
aVwork to end the Drug War.
p69
aVI think it all started growing up
p70
aVin a fairly religious, moral family,
p71
aVeldest son of a rabbi,
p72
aVgoing off to university where I
p73
aVsmoked some marijuana
p74
aVand I liked it. (Laughter)
p75
aVAnd I liked drinking too, but it was obvious
p76
aVthat alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two,
p77
aVbut my friends and I could get busted
p78
aVfor smoking a joint.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, that hypocrisy kept bugging me,
p81
aVso I wrote my Ph.D dissertation on international drug control.
p82
aVI talked my way into the State Department.
p83
aVI got a security clearance.
p84
aVI interviewed hundreds of DEA and other law enforcement agents
p85
aVall around Europe and the Americas,
p86
aVand I'd ask them,
p87
aV"What do you think the answer is?"
p88
aVWell, in Latin America, they'd say to me,
p89
aV"You can't really cut off the supply.
p90
aVThe answer lies back in the U.S.,
p91
aVin cutting off the demand."
p92
aVSo then I go back home and I talk to people
p93
aVinvolved in anti-drug efforts there, and they'd say,
p94
aV"You know, Ethan, you can't  really cut off the demand.
p95
aVThe answer lies over there. You've got to cut off the supply."
p96
aVThen I'd go and talk  to the guys in customs
p97
aVtrying to stop drugs at the borders,
p98
aVand they'd say, "You're  not going to stop it here.
p99
aVThe answer lies over there,
p100
aVin cutting off supply and demand."
p101
aVAnd it hit me:
p102
aVEverybody involved in this
p103
aVthought the answer lay in that area
p104
aVabout which they knew the least.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo that's when I started  reading everything I could
p107
aVabout psychoactive drugs:  the history, the science,
p108
aVthe politics, all of it,
p109
aVand the more one read,
p110
aVthe more it hit you how a thoughtful,
p111
aVenlightened, intelligent  approach took you over here,
p112
aVwhereas the politics and laws of my country
p113
aVwere taking you over here.
p114
aVAnd that disparity struck me as this incredible
p115
aVintellectual and moral puzzle.
p116
aa(lp117
VThere's probably never been
p118
aVa drug-free society.
p119
aVVirtually every society
p120
aVhas ingested psychoactive substances
p121
aVto deal with pain, increase  our energy, socialize,
p122
aVeven commune with God.
p123
aVOur desire to alter our consciousness
p124
aVmay be as fundamental as our desires
p125
aVfor food, companionship and sex.
p126
aVSo our true challenge
p127
aVis to learn how to live with drugs
p128
aVso they cause the least possible harm
p129
aVand in some cases the  greatest possible benefit.
p130
aa(lp131
VI'll tell you something else I learned,
p132
aVthat the reason some drugs  are legal and others not
p133
aVhas almost nothing to do  with science or health
p134
aVor the relative risk of drugs,
p135
aVand almost everything to do with who uses
p136
aVand who is perceived  to use particular drugs.
p137
aVIn the late 19th century,
p138
aVwhen most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal,
p139
aVthe principal consumers  of opiates in my country
p140
aVand others were middle-aged white women,
p141
aVusing them to alleviate aches and pains
p142
aVwhen few other analgesics were available.
p143
aVAnd nobody thought about  criminalizing it back then
p144
aVbecause nobody wanted to  put Grandma behind bars.
p145
aVBut when hundreds of thousands of Chinese
p146
aVstarted showing up in my country,
p147
aVworking hard on the railroads and the mines
p148
aVand then kicking back in the evening
p149
aVjust like they had in the old country
p150
aVwith a few puffs on that opium pipe,
p151
aVthat's when you saw the  first drug prohibition laws
p152
aVin California and Nevada,
p153
aVdriven by racist fears of Chinese
p154
aVtransforming white women
p155
aVinto opium-addicted sex slaves.
p156
aVThe first cocaine prohibition  laws, similarly prompted
p157
aVby racist fears of black men  sniffing that white powder
p158
aVand forgetting their proper place
p159
aVin Southern society.
p160
aVAnd the first marijuana prohibition laws,
p161
aVall about fears of Mexican migrants
p162
aVin the West and the Southwest.
p163
aVAnd what was true in my country,
p164
aVis true in so many others as well,
p165
aVwith both the origins of these laws
p166
aVand their implementation.
p167
aVPut it this way,
p168
aVand I exaggerate only slightly:
p169
aVIf the principal smokers of cocaine
p170
aVwere affluent older white men
p171
aVand the principal consumers of Viagra
p172
aVwere poor young black men,
p173
aVthen smokable cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor
p174
aVand selling Viagra would get you  five to 10 years behind bars.
p175
aV(Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VI used to be a professor teaching about this.
p178
aVNow I'm an activist, a human rights activist,
p179
aVand what drives me is my shame
p180
aVat living in an otherwise great nation
p181
aVthat has less than five percent of the world's population
p182
aVbut almost 25 percent of the world's incarcerated population.
p183
aVIt's the people I meet  who have lost someone
p184
aVthey love to drug-related  violence or prison
p185
aVor overdose or AIDS
p186
aVbecause our drug policies emphasize
p187
aVcriminalization over health.
p188
aVIt's good people who have lost their jobs,
p189
aVtheir homes, their freedom,  even their children
p190
aVto the state, not because they hurt anyone
p191
aVbut solely because they chose to use one drug
p192
aVinstead of another.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo is legalization the answer?
p195
aVOn that, I'm torn:
p196
aVthree days a week I think yes, three days a week I think no,
p197
aVand on Sundays I'm agnostic.
p198
aVBut since today is Tuesday,
p199
aVlet me just say that legally  regulating and taxing
p200
aVmost of the drugs that  are now criminalized
p201
aVwould radically reduce  the crime, violence,
p202
aVcorruption and black markets,
p203
aVand the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs,
p204
aVand improve public safety,
p205
aVand allow taxpayer resources to be developed
p206
aVto more useful purposes.
p207
aVI mean, look, the markets  in marijuana, cocaine,
p208
aVheroin and methamphetamine
p209
aVare global commodities markets
p210
aVjust like the global markets  in alcohol, tobacco,
p211
aVcoffee, sugar, and so many other things.
p212
aVWhere there is a demand,
p213
aVthere will be a supply.
p214
aVKnock out one source and another
p215
aVinevitably emerges.
p216
aVPeople tend to think of prohibition
p217
aVas the ultimate form of regulation
p218
aVwhen in fact it represents  the abdication of regulation
p219
aVwith criminals filling the void.
p220
aVWhich is why putting criminal laws and police
p221
aVfront and center in trying to control
p222
aVa dynamic global commodities market
p223
aVis a recipe for disaster.
p224
aVAnd what we really need to do
p225
aVis to bring the underground drug markets
p226
aVas much as possible aboveground
p227
aVand regulate them as  intelligently as we can
p228
aVto minimize both the harms of drugs
p229
aVand the harms of prohibitionist policies.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow, with marijuana, that obviously means
p232
aVlegally regulating and  taxing it like alcohol.
p233
aVThe benefits of doing so are enormous, the risks minimal.
p234
aVWill more people use marijuana?
p235
aVMaybe, but it's not  going to be young people,
p236
aVbecause it's not going to  be legalized for them,
p237
aVand quite frankly, they already have
p238
aVthe best access to marijuana.
p239
aVI think it's going to be older people.
p240
aVIt's going to be people in their 40s and 60s
p241
aVand 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana
p242
aVto that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill
p243
aVor that it helps with  their arthritis or diabetes
p244
aVor maybe helps spice up a  long-term marriage. (Laughter)
p245
aVAnd that just might be a  net public health benefit.
p246
aa(lp247
VAs for the other drugs,
p248
aVlook at Portugal, where  nobody goes to jail
p249
aVfor possessing drugs,
p250
aVand the government's made  a serious commitment
p251
aVto treating addiction as a health issue.
p252
aVLook at Switzerland,  Germany, the Netherlands,
p253
aVDenmark, England, where people who have
p254
aVbeen addicted to heroin for many years
p255
aVand repeatedly tried to quit and failed
p256
aVcan get pharmaceutical  heroin and helping services
p257
aVin medical clinics, and  the results are in:
p258
aVIllegal drug abuse and disease
p259
aVand overdoses and crime  and arrests all go down,
p260
aVhealth and well-being improve,
p261
aVtaxpayers benefit,
p262
aVand many drug users even put their addictions behind them.
p263
aa(lp264
VLook at New Zealand, which  recently enacted a law
p265
aVallowing certain recreational  drugs to be sold legally
p266
aVprovided their safety had been established.
p267
aVLook here in Brazil, and some other countries,
p268
aVwhere a remarkable psychoactive substance,
p269
aVayahuasca, can be legally  bought and consumed
p270
aVprovided it's done so  within a religious context.
p271
aVLook in Bolivia and Peru,
p272
aVwhere all sorts of products  made from the coca leaf,
p273
aVthe source of cocaine,
p274
aVare sold legally over the counter
p275
aVwith no apparent harm to people's public health.
p276
aVI mean, don't forget, Coca-Cola had cocaine in it until 1900,
p277
aVand so far as we know was no more addictive
p278
aVthan Coca-Cola is today.
p279
aa(lp280
VConversely, think about cigarettes:
p281
aVNothing can both hook you  and kill you like cigarettes.
p282
aVWhen researchers ask heroin addicts
p283
aVwhat's the toughest drug to  quit, most say cigarettes.
p284
aVYet in my country and many others,
p285
aVhalf of all the people who  were ever addicted
p286
aVto cigarettes have quit
p287
aVwithout anyone being  arrested or put in jail
p288
aVor sent to a "treatment program"
p289
aVby a prosecutor or a judge.
p290
aVWhat did it were higher taxes
p291
aVand time and place  restrictions on sale and use
p292
aVand effective anti-smoking campaigns.
p293
aVNow, could we reduce smoking even more
p294
aVby making it totally illegal? Probably.
p295
aVBut just imagine the drug war nightmare
p296
aVthat would result.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo the challenges we face today
p299
aVare twofold.
p300
aVThe first is the policy challenge
p301
aVof designing and implementing alternatives
p302
aVto ineffective prohibitionist policies,
p303
aVeven as we need to get  better at regulating
p304
aVand living with the drugs  that are now legal.
p305
aVBut the second challenge is tougher,
p306
aVbecause it's about us.
p307
aVThe obstacles to reform  lie not just out there
p308
aVin the power of the  prison industrial complex
p309
aVor other vested interests  that want to keep things
p310
aVthe way they are,
p311
aVbut within each and every one of us.
p312
aVIt's our fears and our lack of knowledge
p313
aVand imagination that stands  in the way of real reform.
p314
aVAnd ultimately, I think that  boils down to the kids,
p315
aVand to every parent's desire to put our baby in a bubble,
p316
aVand the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble
p317
aVand put our young ones at risk.
p318
aVIn fact, sometimes it  seems like the entire
p319
aVWar on Drugs gets justified
p320
aVas one great big child protection act,
p321
aVwhich any young person  can tell you it's not.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo here's what I say to teenagers.
p324
aVFirst, don't do drugs.
p325
aVSecond, don't do drugs.
p326
aVThird, if you do do drugs,
p327
aVthere's some things I want you to know,
p328
aVbecause my bottom line as your parent is,
p329
aVcome home safely at the end of the night
p330
aVand grow up and lead a  healthy and good adulthood.
p331
aVThat's my drug education  mantra: Safety first.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo this is what I've dedicated my life to,
p334
aVto building an organization and a movement
p335
aVof people who believe we  need to turn our backs
p336
aVon the failed prohibitions of the past
p337
aVand embrace new drug  policies grounded in science,
p338
aVcompassion, health and human rights,
p339
aVwhere people who come from across the political spectrum
p340
aVand every other spectrum as well,
p341
aVwhere people who love our drugs,
p342
aVpeople who hate drugs,
p343
aVand people who don't give  a damn about drugs,
p344
aVbut every one of us believes  that this War on Drugs,
p345
aVthis backward, heartless,  disastrous War on Drugs,
p346
aVhas got to end.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Applause)
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you. Thank you.
p353
aa(lp354
VChris Anderson: Ethan,
p355
aVcongrats \u2014 quite the reaction.
p356
aVThat was a powerful talk.
p357
aVNot quite a complete standing O, though,
p358
aVand I'm guessing that some people here
p359
aVand maybe a few watching online,
p360
aVmaybe someone knows a teenager or a friend
p361
aVor whatever who got sick,
p362
aVmaybe died from some drug overdose.
p363
aVI'm sure you've had these people approach you before.
p364
aVWhat do you say to them?
p365
aa(lp366
VEthan Nadelmann: Chris, the most amazing thing that's happened of late
p367
aVis that I've met a growing number of people
p368
aVwho have actually  lost a sibling or a child
p369
aVto a drug overdose,
p370
aVand 10 years ago, those  people just wanted to say,
p371
aVlet's line up all the drug  dealers and shoot them
p372
aVand that will solve it.
p373
aVAnd what they've come to understand
p374
aVis that the Drug War did  nothing to protect their kids.
p375
aVIf anything, it made it more likely
p376
aVthat those kids were put at risk.
p377
aVAnd so they're now becoming part of this
p378
aVdrug policy reform movement.
p379
aVThere's other people who have kids,
p380
aVone's addicted to alcohol, the other one's addicted to cocaine or heroin,
p381
aVand they ask themselves the question:
p382
aVWhy does this kid get to  take one step at a time
p383
aVand try to get better
p384
aVand that one's got to deal with jail
p385
aVand police and criminals all the time?
p386
aVSo everybody's understanding,
p387
aVthe Drug War's not protecting anybody.
p388
aa(lp389
VCA: Certainly in the U.S.,  you've got political gridlock
p390
aVon most issues.
p391
aVIs there any realistic chance of anything
p392
aVactually shifting on this  issue in the next five years?
p393
aa(lp394
VEN: I'd say it's quite remarkable.  I'm getting all these calls
p395
aVfrom journalists now who are saying to me,
p396
aV"Ethan, it seems like the only two issues
p397
aVadvancing politically in America right now
p398
aVare marijuana law reform and gay marriage.
p399
aVWhat are you doing right?"
p400
aVAnd then you're looking at  bipartisanship breaking out
p401
aVwith, actually, Republicans in the Congress
p402
aVand state legislatures  allowing bills to be enacted
p403
aVwith majority Democratic support,
p404
aVso we've gone from being sort of the third rail,
p405
aVthe most fearful issue of American politics,
p406
aVto becoming one of the most successful.
p407
aa(lp408
VCA: Ethan, thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal. EN: Chris, thanks so much.
p409
aa(lp410

VThis year, Germany is celebrating
p5
aVthe 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution
p6
aVin East Germany.
p7
aVIn 1989, the Communist regime was moved away,
p8
aVthe Berlin Wall came down, and one year later,
p9
aVthe German Democratic Republic, the GDR,
p10
aVin the East was unified
p11
aVwith the Federal Republic of Germany in the West
p12
aVto found today's Germany.
p13
aVAmong many other things, Germany inherited
p14
aVthe archives of the East German secret police,
p15
aVknown as the Stasi.
p16
aVOnly two years after its dissolution,
p17
aVits documents were opened to the public,
p18
aVand historians such as me started
p19
aVto study these documents
p20
aVto learn more about how the GDR surveillance state
p21
aVfunctioned.
p22
aa(lp23
VPerhaps you have watched the movie
p24
aV"The Lives of Others."
p25
aVThis movie made the Stasi known worldwide,
p26
aVand as we live in an age where words
p27
aVsuch as "surveillance" or "wiretapping"
p28
aVare on the front pages of newspapers,
p29
aVI would like to speak about how the Stasi
p30
aVreally worked.
p31
aa(lp32
VAt the beginning, let's have a short look
p33
aVat the history of the Stasi,
p34
aVbecause it's really important for understanding
p35
aVits self-conception.
p36
aVIts origins are located in Russia.
p37
aVIn 1917, the Russian Communists founded
p38
aVthe Emergency Commission for Combating
p39
aVCounter-Revolution and Sabotage,
p40
aVshortly Cheka.
p41
aVIt was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.
p42
aVThe Cheka was an instrument of the Communists
p43
aVto establish their regime by terrorizing the population
p44
aVand executing their enemies.
p45
aVIt evolved later into the well-known KGB.
p46
aVThe Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers.
p47
aVThey called themselves Chekists,
p48
aVand even the emblem was very similar,
p49
aVas you can see here.
p50
aVIn fact, the secret police of Russia
p51
aVwas the creator and instructor of the Stasi.
p52
aVWhen the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945,
p53
aVit immediately expanded there,
p54
aVand soon it started to train the German Communists
p55
aVto build up their own secret police.
p56
aVBy the way, in this hall where we are now,
p57
aVthe ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946.
p58
aa(lp59
VFive years later, the Stasi was established,
p60
aVand step by step, the dirty job of oppression
p61
aVwas handed over to it.
p62
aVFor instance, the central jail
p63
aVfor political prisoners,
p64
aVwhich was established by the Russians,
p65
aVwas taken over by the Stasi
p66
aVand used until the end of Communism.
p67
aVYou see it here.
p68
aVAt the beginning, every important step
p69
aVtook place under the attendance of the Russians.
p70
aVBut the Germans are known to be very effective,
p71
aVso the Stasi grew very quickly,
p72
aVand already in 1953, it had more employees
p73
aVthan the Gestapo had,
p74
aVthe secret police of Nazi Germany.
p75
aVThe number doubled in each decade.
p76
aVIn 1989, more than 90,000 employees
p77
aVworked for the Stasi.
p78
aVThis meant that one employee
p79
aVwas responsible for 180 inhabitants,
p80
aVwhich was really unique in the world.
p81
aa(lp82
VAt the top of this tremendous apparatus,
p83
aVthere was one man, Erich Mielke.
p84
aVHe ruled the Ministry of State Security
p85
aVfor more than 30 years.
p86
aVHe was a scrupulous functionary \u2014
p87
aVin his past, he killed two policemen
p88
aVnot far away from here \u2014
p89
aVwho in fact personalized the Stasi.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut what was so exceptional about the Stasi?
p92
aVForemost, it was its enormous power,
p93
aVbecause it united different functions
p94
aVin one organization.
p95
aVFirst of all, the Stasi
p96
aVwas an intelligence service.
p97
aVIt used all the imaginable instruments
p98
aVfor getting information secretly,
p99
aVsuch as informers, or tapping phones,
p100
aVas you can see it on the picture here.
p101
aVAnd it was not only active in East Germany,
p102
aVbut all over the world.
p103
aVSecondly, the Stasi was a secret police.
p104
aVIt could stop people on the street
p105
aVand arrest them in its own prisons.
p106
aVThirdly, the Stasi worked
p107
aVas a kind of public prosecutor.
p108
aVIt had the right to open preliminary investigations
p109
aVand to interrogate people officially.
p110
aVLast but not least,
p111
aVthe Stasi had its own armed forces.
p112
aVMore than 11,000 soldiers were serving
p113
aVin its so-called Guards Regiment.
p114
aVIt was founded to crash down protests and uprisings.
p115
aVDue to this concentration of power,
p116
aVthe Stasi was called a state in the state.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut let's look in more and more detail
p119
aVat the tools of the Stasi.
p120
aVPlease keep in mind that at that time
p121
aVthe web and smartphones were not yet invented.
p122
aVOf course, the Stasi used all kinds
p123
aVof technical instruments to survey people.
p124
aVTelephones were wiretapped,
p125
aVincluding the phone of the German chancellor in the West,
p126
aVand often also the apartments.
p127
aVEvery day, 90,000 letters were being opened
p128
aVby these machines.
p129
aVThe Stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people
p130
aVusing specially trained agents and secret cameras
p131
aVto document every step one took.
p132
aVIn this picture, you can see me
p133
aVas a young man just in front of this building
p134
aVwhere we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent.
p135
aVThe Stasi even collected the smell of people.
p136
aVIt stored samples of it in closed jars
p137
aVwhich were found after the peaceful revolution.
p138
aVFor all these tasks, highly specialized departments
p139
aVwere responsible.
p140
aVThe one which was tapping phone calls
p141
aVwas completely separated
p142
aVfrom the one which controlled the letters,
p143
aVfor good reasons,
p144
aVbecause if one agent quit the Stasi,
p145
aVhis knowledge was very small.
p146
aVContrast that with Snowden, for example.
p147
aVBut the vertical specialization was also important
p148
aVto prevent all kinds of empathy
p149
aVwith the object of observation.
p150
aVThe agent who shadowed me
p151
aVdidn't know who I was
p152
aVor why I was surveyed.
p153
aVIn fact, I smuggled forbidden books
p154
aVfrom West to East Germany.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut what was even more typical for the Stasi
p157
aVwas the use of human intelligence,
p158
aVpeople who reported secretly to the Stasi.
p159
aVFor the Minister of State Security,
p160
aVthese so-called unofficial employees
p161
aVwere the most important tools.
p162
aVFrom 1975 on, nearly 200,000 people
p163
aVcollaborated constantly with the Stasi,
p164
aVmore than one percent of the population.
p165
aVAnd in a way, the minister was right,
p166
aVbecause technical instruments
p167
aVcan only register what people are doing,
p168
aVbut agents and spies can also report
p169
aVwhat people are planning to do
p170
aVand what they are thinking.
p171
aVTherefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants.
p172
aVThe system of how to get them
p173
aVand how to educate them, as it was called,
p174
aVwas very sophisticated.
p175
aVThe Stasi had its own university,
p176
aVnot far away from here,
p177
aVwhere the methods were explored
p178
aVand taught to the officers.
p179
aVThis guideline gave a detailed description
p180
aVof every step you have to take
p181
aVif you want to convince human beings
p182
aVto betray their fellow citizens.
p183
aVSometimes it's said that informants were pressured
p184
aVto becoming one,
p185
aVbut that's mostly not true,
p186
aVbecause a forced informant is a bad informant.
p187
aVOnly someone who wants to give you the information you need
p188
aVis an effective whistleblower.
p189
aVThe main reasons why people cooperated with the Stasi
p190
aVwere political conviction and material benefits.
p191
aVThe officers also tried to create a personal bond
p192
aVbetween themselves and the informant,
p193
aVand to be honest, the example of the Stasi shows
p194
aVthat it's not so difficult to win someone
p195
aVin order to betray others.
p196
aVEven some of the top dissidents in East Germany
p197
aVcollaborated with the Stasi,
p198
aVas for instance Ibrahim Böhme.
p199
aVIn 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolution
p200
aVand he nearly became the first freely elected Prime Minister of the GDR
p201
aVuntil it came out that he was an informant.
p202
aa(lp203
VThe net of spies was really broad.
p204
aVIn nearly every institution,
p205
aVeven in the churches or in West Germany,
p206
aVthere were many of them.
p207
aVI remember telling a leading Stasi officer,
p208
aV"If you had sent an informant to me,
p209
aVI would surely have recognized him."
p210
aVHis answer was,
p211
aV"We didn't send anyone.
p212
aVWe took those who were around you."
p213
aVAnd in fact, two of my best friends
p214
aVreported about me to the Stasi.
p215
aVNot only in my case, informers were very close.
p216
aVFor example, Vera Lengsfeld, another leading dissident,
p217
aVin her case it was her husband who spied on her.
p218
aVA famous writer was betrayed by his brother.
p219
aVThis reminds me of the novel "1984" by George Orwell,
p220
aVwhere the only apparently trustable person
p221
aVwas an informer.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut why did the Stasi collect all this information
p224
aVin its archives?
p225
aVThe main purpose was to control the society.
p226
aVIn nearly every speech, the Stasi minister
p227
aVgave the order to find out who is who,
p228
aVwhich meant who thinks what.
p229
aVHe didn't want to wait until somebody
p230
aVtried to act against the regime.
p231
aVHe wanted to know in advance
p232
aVwhat people were thinking and planning.
p233
aVThe East Germans knew, of course,
p234
aVthat they were surrounded by informers,
p235
aVin a totalitarian regime that created mistrust
p236
aVand a state of widespread fear,
p237
aVthe most important tools to oppress people
p238
aVin any dictatorship.
p239
aa(lp240
VThat's why not many East Germans tried
p241
aVto fight against the Communist regime.
p242
aVIf yes, the Stasi often used a method
p243
aVwhich was really diabolic.
p244
aVIt was called Zersetzung,
p245
aVand it's described in another guideline.
p246
aVThe word is difficult to translate because it means
p247
aVoriginally "biodegradation."
p248
aVBut actually, it's a quite accurate description.
p249
aVThe goal was to destroy secretly
p250
aVthe self-confidence of people,
p251
aVfor example by damaging their reputation,
p252
aVby organizing failures in their work,
p253
aVand by destroying their personal relationships.
p254
aVConsidering this, East Germany was a very modern dictatorship.
p255
aVThe Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident.
p256
aVIt preferred to paralyze them,
p257
aVand it could do so because
p258
aVit had access to so much personal information
p259
aVand to so many institutions.
p260
aVDetaining someone was used only
p261
aVas a last resort.
p262
aVFor this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons,
p263
aVone in every district.
p264
aVHere, the Stasi also developed
p265
aVquite modern methods of detention.
p266
aVNormally, the interrogation officer
p267
aVdidn't torture the prisoner.
p268
aVInstead, he used a sophisticated system
p269
aVof psychological pressure
p270
aVin which strict isolation was central.
p271
aVNearly no prisoner resisted
p272
aVwithout giving a testimony.
p273
aVIf you have the occasion,
p274
aVdo visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin
p275
aVand attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner
p276
aVwho will explain to you how this worked.
p277
aa(lp278
VOne more question needs to be answered:
p279
aVIf the Stasi were so well organized,
p280
aVwhy did the Communist regime collapse?
p281
aVFirst, in 1989, the leadership in East Germany
p282
aVwas uncertain what to do against
p283
aVthe growing protest of people.
p284
aVIt was especially confused
p285
aVbecause in the mother country of socialism,
p286
aVthe Soviet Union,
p287
aVa more liberal policy took place.
p288
aVIn addition, the regime was dependent
p289
aVon the loans from the West.
p290
aVTherefore, no order to crash down the uprising
p291
aVwas given to the Stasi.
p292
aVSecondly, in the Communist ideology,
p293
aVthere's no place for criticism.
p294
aVInstead, the leadership stuck to the belief
p295
aVthat socialism is a perfect system,
p296
aVand the Stasi had to confirm that, of course.
p297
aVThe consequence was
p298
aVthat despite all the information,
p299
aVthe regime couldn't analyze its real problems,
p300
aVand therefore it couldn't solve them.
p301
aVIn the end, the Stasi died
p302
aVbecause of the structures
p303
aVthat it was charged with protecting.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe ending of the Stasi
p306
aVwas something tragic,
p307
aVbecause these officers
p308
aVwere kept busy during the peaceful revolution
p309
aVwith only one thing:
p310
aVto destroy the documents
p311
aVthey had produced during decades.
p312
aVFortunately,
p313
aVthey had been stopped by human rights activists.
p314
aVThat's why today we can use the files
p315
aVto get a better understanding
p316
aVof how a surveillance state functions.
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Applause)
p321
aa(lp322
VBruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you very much.
p323
aVSo Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questions
p324
aVbecause I have here Der Spiegel from last week.
p325
aV"Mein Nachbar NSA." My neighbor, the NSA.
p326
aVAnd you just told us about my neighbor,
p327
aVthe spies and the informant from East Germany.
p328
aVSo there is a direct link between these two stories
p329
aVor there isn't?
p330
aVWhat's your reaction as a historian when you see this?
p331
aa(lp332
VHubertus Knabe: I think there are
p333
aVseveral aspects to mention.
p334
aVAt first, I think there's a difference
p335
aVof why you are collecting this data.
p336
aVAre you doing that for protecting your people
p337
aVagainst terrorist attacks,
p338
aVor are you doing that for oppressing your people?
p339
aVSo that makes a fundamental difference.
p340
aVBut on the other hand,
p341
aValso in a democracy, these instruments can be abused,
p342
aVand that is something where we really have
p343
aVto be aware to stop that,
p344
aVand that also the intelligence services
p345
aVare respecting the rules we have.
p346
aVThe third point, probably,
p347
aVwe really can be happy that we live in a democracy,
p348
aVbecause you can be sure that Russia and China
p349
aVare doing the same,
p350
aVbut nobody speaks about that
p351
aVbecause nobody could do that.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Applause)
p354
aa(lp355
VBG: When the story came out first,
p356
aVlast July, last year,
p357
aVyou filed a criminal complaint
p358
aVwith a German tribunal. Why?
p359
aVHK: Yeah, I did so because of the second point I mentioned,
p360
aVthat I think especially in a democracy,
p361
aVthe rules are for everybody.
p362
aVThey are made for everybody, so it's not allowed
p363
aVthat any institution doesn't respect the rules.
p364
aVIn the criminal code of Germany, it's written
p365
aVthat it's not allowed to tap somebody
p366
aVwithout the permission of the judge.
p367
aVFortunately, it's written in the criminal code of Germany,
p368
aVso if it's not respected, then I think
p369
aVan investigation is necessary,
p370
aVand it took a very long time that
p371
aVthe public prosecutor of Germany started this,
p372
aVand he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel,
p373
aVand not in the case of all the other people living in Germany.
p374
aa(lp375
VBG: That doesn't surprise me because \u2014
p376
aV(Applause) \u2014
p377
aVbecause of the story you told.
p378
aVSeen from the outside, I live outside of Germany,
p379
aVand I expected the Germans to react
p380
aVmuch more strongly, immediately.
p381
aVAnd instead, the reaction really came only
p382
aVwhen Chancellor Merkel was revealed
p383
aVas being wiretapped. Why so?
p384
aa(lp385
VHK: I take it as a good sign,
p386
aVbecause people feel secure in this democracy.
p387
aVThey aren't afraid that they will be arrested,
p388
aVand if you leave this hall after the conference,
p389
aVnobody has to be afraid that the secret police
p390
aVis standing out and is arresting you.
p391
aVSo that's a good sign, I think.
p392
aVPeople are not really scared, as they could be.
p393
aVBut of course, I think, the institutions
p394
aVare responsible to stop illegal actions
p395
aVin Germany or wherever they happen.
p396
aa(lp397
VBG: A personal question, and this is the last one.
p398
aVThere has been a debate in Germany about
p399
aVgranting asylum to Edward Snowden.
p400
aVWould you be in favor or against?
p401
aa(lp402
VHK: Oh, that's a difficult question,
p403
aVbut if you ask me,
p404
aVand if I answer honestly,
p405
aVI would give him the asylum,
p406
aVbecause I think it was really brave what he did,
p407
aVand he destroyed his whole life
p408
aVand his family and everything.
p409
aVSo I think, for these people, we should do something,
p410
aVand especially if you see the German history,
p411
aVwhere so many people had to escape
p412
aVand they asked for asylum in other countries
p413
aVand they didn't get it,
p414
aVso it would be a good sign to give him asylum.
p415
aa(lp416
V(Applause)
p417
aa(lp418
VBG: Hubertus, thank you very much.

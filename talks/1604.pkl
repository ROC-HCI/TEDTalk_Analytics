VSo I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world
p5
aVfrom a totally unique point of view,
p6
aVand this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world.
p7
aVI've found, after doing this for many, many years,
p8
aVthat there's a magical world behind reality.
p9
aVAnd that can be seen directly through a microscope,
p10
aVand I'm going to show you some of this today.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small,
p13
aVsomething that we can see with our naked eye,
p14
aVand that's a bee. So when you look at this bee,
p15
aVit's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.
p16
aVBut to really see the details of the bee, and really
p17
aVappreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.
p18
aVSo that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope,
p19
aVand now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has
p20
aVthousands of individual eyes called ommatidia,
p21
aVand they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes
p22
aVso they know when they're right up close to something,
p23
aVbecause they can't see in stereo.
p24
aa(lp25
VAs we go smaller, here is a human hair.
p26
aVA human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.
p27
aVIt's about a tenth of a millimeter.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd as we go smaller again,
p30
aVabout ten times smaller than that, is a cell.
p31
aVSo you could fit 10 human cells
p32
aVacross the diameter of a human hair.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo when we would look at cells, this is how I really got
p35
aVinvolved in biology and science is by looking
p36
aVat living cells in the microscope.
p37
aVWhen I first saw living cells in a microscope, I was
p38
aVabsolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.
p39
aVSo if you look at the cell like that from the immune system,
p40
aVthey're actually moving all over the place.
p41
aVThis cell is looking for foreign objects,
p42
aVbacteria, things that it can find.
p43
aVAnd it's looking around, and when it finds something,
p44
aVand recognizes it being foreign,
p45
aVit will actually engulf it and eat it.
p46
aVSo if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium,
p47
aVand it engulfs it and eats it.
p48
aVIf you take some heart cells from an animal,
p49
aVand put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat.
p50
aVThat's their job. Every cell has a mission in life,
p51
aVand these cells, the mission is
p52
aVto move blood around our body.
p53
aVThese next cells are nerve cells, and right now,
p54
aVas we see and understand what we're looking at,
p55
aVour brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this
p56
aVright now. They're not just static. They're moving around
p57
aVmaking new connections, and that's what happens when we learn.
p58
aa(lp59
VAs you go farther down this scale here,
p60
aVthat's a micron, or a micrometer, and we go
p61
aVall the way down to here to a nanometer
p62
aVand an angstrom. Now, an angstrom is the size
p63
aVof the diameter of a hydrogen atom.
p64
aVThat's how small that is.
p65
aVAnd microscopes that we have today can actually see
p66
aVindividual atoms. So these are some pictures
p67
aVof individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom.
p68
aVThis is a ring of cobalt atoms.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo this whole world, the nano world, this area in here
p71
aVis called the nano world, and the nano world,
p72
aVthe whole micro world that we see,
p73
aVthere's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and
p74
aVthe whole \u2014 and that is the world of molecules and atoms.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut I want to talk about this larger world,
p77
aVthe world of the micro world.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower,
p80
aVwhat would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?
p81
aVIt wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see
p82
aVwhen we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here,
p83
aVand you're a little bug, if you're on that surface
p84
aVof that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.
p85
aVThe petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant
p86
aVis kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look
p87
aVa little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here,
p88
aVthis is the style of that flower, and you notice
p89
aVthat it's got these little \u2014 these are like little jelly-like things
p90
aVthat are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.
p91
aVSo this little ant that's crawling here, it's like
p92
aVit's in a little Willy Wonka land.
p93
aVIt's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.
p94
aVThese are little bits of individual grain of pollen
p95
aVthere and there, and here is a \u2014
p96
aVwhat you see as one little yellow dot of pollen,
p97
aVwhen you look in a microscope, it's actually made
p98
aVof thousands of little grains of pollen.
p99
aVSo this, for example, when you see bees flying around
p100
aVthese little plants, and they're collecting pollen,
p101
aVthose pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack
p102
aVinto their legs and they take it back to the hive,
p103
aVand that's what makes the beehive,
p104
aVthe wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar,
p105
aVand that's what makes the honey that we eat.
p106
aa(lp107
VHere's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture
p108
aVof a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision,
p109
aVwith your naked eye, you'd see it about that well.
p110
aVThere's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen
p111
aVand the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen.
p112
aVSo that's thousands of little grains of pollen there,
p113
aVand there's the pistil there, and these are the little things
p114
aVcalled trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give
p115
aVa fragrance, and plants actually communicate
p116
aVwith one another through their fragrances.
p117
aa(lp118
VI want to talk about something really ordinary,
p119
aVjust ordinary sand.
p120
aVI became interested in sand about 10 years ago,
p121
aVwhen I first saw sand from Maui,
p122
aVand in fact, this is a little bit of sand from Maui.
p123
aVSo sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.
p124
aVEach sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.
p125
aVBut when you look closer at this, look at what's there.
p126
aVIt's really quite amazing. You have microshells there.
p127
aVYou have things like coral.
p128
aVYou have fragments of other shells. You have olivine.
p129
aVYou have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit
p130
aVof a volcano there. You have tube worms.
p131
aVAn amazing array of incredible things exist in sand.
p132
aVAnd the reason that is, is because in a place like this island,
p133
aVa lot of the sand is made of biological material
p134
aVbecause the reefs provide a place where all these
p135
aVmicroscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow,
p136
aVand when they die, their shells and their teeth
p137
aVand their bones break up and they make grains of sand,
p138
aVthings like coral and so forth.
p139
aVSo here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.
p140
aVThis is from Lahaina,
p141
aVand when we're walking along a beach, we're actually
p142
aVwalking along millions of years of biological and geological history.
p143
aVWe don't realize it, but it's actually a record
p144
aVof that entire ecology.
p145
aVSo here we see, for example, a sponge spicule,
p146
aVtwo bits of coral here,
p147
aVthat's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo when I first looked at this, I was \u2014 I thought,
p150
aVgee, this is like a little treasure trove here.
p151
aVI couldn't believe it, and I'd go around dissecting
p152
aVthe little bits out and making photographs of them.
p153
aVHere's what most of the sand in our world looks like.
p154
aVThese are quartz crystals and feldspar,
p155
aVso most sand in the world on the mainland
p156
aVis made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock.
p157
aVSo mountains are built up, and they erode away by water
p158
aVand rain and ice and so forth,
p159
aVand they become grains of sand.
p160
aVThere's some sand that's really much more colorful.
p161
aVThese are sand from near the Great Lakes,
p162
aVand you can see that it's filled with minerals
p163
aVlike pink garnet and green epidote, all kinds of amazing stuff,
p164
aVand if you look at different sands from different places,
p165
aVevery single beach, every single place you look at sand,
p166
aVit's different. Here's from Big Sur, like they're little jewels.
p167
aVThere are places in Africa where they do the mining
p168
aVof jewels, and you go to the sand where the rivers have
p169
aVthe sand go down to the ocean, and it's like literally looking
p170
aVat tiny jewels through the microscope.
p171
aVSo every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different.
p172
aVEvery single grain is different. There are no two grains
p173
aVof sand alike in the world.
p174
aVEvery grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere.
p175
aVThey're like a snapshot in time.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow sand is not only on Earth, but sand is
p178
aVubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact, outer space
p179
aVis filled with sand, and that sand comes together
p180
aVto make our planets and the Moon.
p181
aVAnd you can see those in micrometeorites.
p182
aVThis is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me,
p183
aVand they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole.
p184
aVAnd they're quite amazing-looking, and these are the
p185
aVtiny constituents that make up the world that we live in \u2014
p186
aVthe planets and the Moon.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand,
p189
aVso they sent me sand from all the different landings
p190
aVof the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.
p191
aVAnd I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes.
p192
aVThis was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.
p193
aVI thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting.
p194
aVNow, the way my microscopes work is, normally
p195
aVin a microscope you can see very little at one time,
p196
aVso what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope,
p197
aVkeep taking pictures, and then I have a computer program
p198
aVthat puts all those pictures together
p199
aVinto one picture so you can see actually what it looks like,
p200
aVand I do that in 3D. So there, you can see,
p201
aVis a left-eye view. There's a right-eye view.
p202
aVSo sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow something's interesting here. This looks very different
p205
aVthan any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've
p206
aVseen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me. (Laughter)
p207
aVLook at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused
p208
aVby a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.
p209
aVNow, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites
p210
aVcome in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon
p211
aVis covered with powder now, because for four billion years
p212
aVit's been bombarded by micrometeorites,
p213
aVand when micrometeorites come in at about
p214
aV20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact.
p215
aVAnd you can see here that that is \u2014
p216
aVthat's sort of vaporized, and that material is holding this
p217
aVlittle clump of little sand grains together.
p218
aVThis is a very small grain of sand, this whole thing.
p219
aVAnd that's called a ring agglutinate.
p220
aVAnd many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that,
p221
aVand you'd never find that on Earth.
p222
aVMost of the sand on the Moon,
p223
aVespecially \u2014 and you know when you look at the Moon,
p224
aVthere's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas
p225
aVare lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows,
p226
aVand that's what this sand looks like, very similar
p227
aVto the sand that you would see in Haleakala.
p228
aVOther sands, when these micrometeorites come in,
p229
aVthey vaporize and they make these fountains,
p230
aVthese microscopic fountains that go up into the \u2014
p231
aVI was going to say "up into the air," but there is no air \u2014
p232
aVgoes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads
p233
aVare formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time
p234
aVthey fall down back to the surface of the Moon,
p235
aVthey have these beautiful colored glass spherules.
p236
aVAnd these are actually microscopic;
p237
aVyou need a microscope to see these.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon,
p240
aVand you can see that the entire
p241
aVcrystal structure is still there.
p242
aVThis grain of sand is probably about
p243
aVthree and a half or four billion years old,
p244
aVand it's never eroded away like the way we have sand
p245
aVon Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling,
p246
aVair, and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion
p247
aVdown here by the Sun, has these solar storms,
p248
aVand that's erosion by solar radiation.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo what I've been trying to tell you today is
p251
aVthings even as ordinary as a grain of sand
p252
aVcan be truly extraordinary if you look closely
p253
aVand if you look from a different and a new point of view.
p254
aVI think that this was best put by William Blake when he said,
p255
aV"To see a world in a grain of sand
p256
aVand a heaven in a wild flower,
p257
aVhold infinity in the palm of your hand,
p258
aVand eternity in an hour."
p259
aVThank you. (Applause)

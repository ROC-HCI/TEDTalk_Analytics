VSo I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills
p5
aVand why this is an incredibly important,
p6
aVlong, oily, hot summer,
p7
aVand why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted.
p8
aVBut before I talk about the political chemistry,
p9
aVI actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is a photograph from when I visited
p12
aVPrudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002
p13
aVto watch the Minerals Management Service
p14
aVtesting their ability
p15
aVto burn oil spills in ice.
p16
aVAnd what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil,
p17
aVyou see some ice cubes,
p18
aVand you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.
p19
aVThe napalm is burning there quite nicely.
p20
aVAnd the thing is, is that
p21
aVoil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer.
p22
aVWe're four percent of the world's population;
p23
aVwe use 25 percent of the world's oil production.
p24
aVAnd we don't really understand what oil is,
p25
aVuntil you check out its molecules,
p26
aVAnd you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn.
p27
aVSo this is what happens as that burn gets going.
p28
aVIt takes off. It's a big woosh.
p29
aVI highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday,
p30
aVbecause you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture
p31
aVon the geopolitics of oil again.
p32
aVIt'll just bake your retinas.
p33
aVSo there it is; the retinas are baking.
p34
aa(lp35
VLet me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.
p36
aVOil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.
p37
aVIt starts of with the very small ones,
p38
aVwhich are one carbon, four hydrogen \u2014
p39
aVthat's methane \u2014 it just floats off.
p40
aVThen there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon.
p41
aVYou've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic.
p42
aVAnd it goes all the way over
p43
aVto these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons,
p44
aVand they have thousands of hydrogens,
p45
aVand they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur
p46
aVand all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.
p47
aVThose are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt.
p48
aVThey're very important in oil spills.
p49
aa(lp50
VLet me tell you a little bit about
p51
aVthe chemistry of oil in water.
p52
aVIt is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.
p53
aVOil doesn't sink, it floats.
p54
aVIf it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
p55
aVAnd the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.
p56
aVIt spreads out to be really thin,
p57
aVso you have a hard time corralling it.
p58
aVThe next thing that happens
p59
aVis the light ends evaporate,
p60
aVand some of the toxic things float into the water column
p61
aVand kill fish eggs
p62
aVand smaller fish and things like that, and shrimp.
p63
aVAnd then the asphaltenes \u2014 and this is the crucial thing \u2014
p64
aVthe asphaltenes get whipped by the waves
p65
aVinto a frothy emulsion, something like mayonnaise.
p66
aVIt triples the amount
p67
aVof oily, messy goo that you have in the water,
p68
aVand it makes it very hard to handle.
p69
aVIt also makes it very viscous.
p70
aVWhen the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain,
p71
aVthere were big, floating cushions the size of sofa cushions
p72
aVof emulsified oil,
p73
aVwith the consistency, or the viscosity, of chewing gum.
p74
aVIt's incredibly hard to clean up.
p75
aVAnd every single oil is different when it hits water.
p76
aa(lp77
VWhen the chemistry of the oil and water
p78
aValso hits our politics,
p79
aVit's absolutely explosive.
p80
aVFor the first time, American consumers
p81
aVwill kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves.
p82
aVThey have a "eureka!" moment,
p83
aVwhen we suddenly understand oil in a different context.
p84
aVSo I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics,
p85
aVbecause it's really crucial to understanding
p86
aVwhy this summer is so important, why we need to stay focused.
p87
aVNobody gets up in the morning and thinks,
p88
aV"Wow! I'm going to go buy
p89
aVsome three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank
p90
aVand drive happily to work."
p91
aVNo, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas.
p92
aVI'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off.
p93
aVThey set the prices, and I don't even know.
p94
aVI am helpless over this."
p95
aVAnd this is what happens to us at the gas pump \u2014
p96
aVand actually, gas pumps are specifically designed
p97
aVto diffuse that anger.
p98
aVYou might notice that many gas pumps, including this one,
p99
aVare designed to look like ATMs.
p100
aVI've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger,
p101
aVbecause supposedly we feel good about ATMs.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVThat shows you how bad it is.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness
p106
aVcomes in because most Americans actually feel
p107
aVthat oil prices are the result of a conspiracy,
p108
aVnot of the vicissitudes of the world oil market.
p109
aVAnd the thing is, too,
p110
aVis that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume,
p111
aVwhich is somewhat reasonable,
p112
aVbecause in fact, we have designed this system
p113
aVwhere, if you want to get a job,
p114
aVit's much more important to have a car that runs,
p115
aVto have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED.
p116
aVAnd that's actually very perverse.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas,
p119
aVwhich is that we'd rather be doing anything else.
p120
aVThis is BP's gas station
p121
aVin downtown Los Angeles.
p122
aVIt is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.
p123
aV"Now," you think, "why would something so lame
p124
aVwork on people so smart?"
p125
aVWell, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas,
p126
aVwe're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.
p127
aVI mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else.
p128
aVWe don't want to be buying oil;
p129
aVwe want to be doing something green.
p130
aVAnd we get kind of in on our own con.
p131
aVI mean \u2014 and this is funny,
p132
aVit looks funny here.
p133
aVBut in fact, that's why the slogan "beyond petroleum" worked.
p134
aVBut it's an inherent part of our energy policy,
p135
aVwhich is we don't talk about
p136
aVreducing the amount of oil that we use.
p137
aVWe talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars.
p138
aVWe talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet.
p139
aVAnd so, cognitive dissonance
p140
aVis part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil,
p141
aVand it's really important to dealing with this oil spill.
p142
aa(lp143
VOkay, so the politics of oil
p144
aVare very moral in the United States.
p145
aVThe oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus
p146
aVof engineering and finance
p147
aVand everything else,
p148
aVbut we actually see it in very moral terms.
p149
aVThis is an early-on photograph \u2014 you can see, we had these gushers.
p150
aVEarly journalists looked at these spills,
p151
aVand they said, "This is a filthy industry."
p152
aVBut they also saw in it
p153
aVthat people were getting rich for doing nothing.
p154
aVThey weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground.
p155
aVIt's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically.
p156
aVBut in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing,
p157
aVlong before it became funny.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd then, of course, there was John D. Rockefeller.
p160
aVAnd the thing about John D. is that
p161
aVhe went into this chaotic wild-east
p162
aVof oil industry,
p163
aVand he rationalized it
p164
aVinto a vertically integrated company, a multinational.
p165
aVIt was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now,
p166
aVimagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.
p167
aVAnd it also the kind of root
p168
aVof how we see oil as a conspiracy.
p169
aVBut what's really amazing is that
p170
aVIda Tarbell, the journalist,
p171
aVwent in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller
p172
aVand actually got the whole antitrust laws
p173
aVput in place.
p174
aVBut in many ways,
p175
aVthat image of the conspiracy still sticks with us.
p176
aVAnd here's one of the things
p177
aVthat Ida Tarbell said \u2014
p178
aVshe said, "He has a thin nose like a thorn.
p179
aVThere were no lips.
p180
aVThere were puffs under the little colorless eyes
p181
aVwith creases running from them."
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVOkay, so that guy is actually still with us.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVI mean, this is a very pervasive \u2014 this is part of our DNA.
p186
aVAnd then there's this guy, okay.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, you might be wondering why it is that,
p189
aVevery time we have high oil prices or an oil spill,
p190
aVwe call these CEOs down to Washington,
p191
aVand we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.
p192
aVAnd this is something that we've been doing since 1974,
p193
aVwhen we first asked them, "Why are there these obscene profits?"
p194
aVAnd we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry
p195
aVinto these CEOs.
p196
aVAnd we take it as, you know \u2014
p197
aVwe look at it on a moral level,
p198
aVrather than looking at it on a legal and financial level.
p199
aVAnd so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions \u2014
p200
aVI'm just saying that, when you focus on
p201
aVwhether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards,
p202
aVyou don't actually get around to the point
p203
aVof making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate,
p204
aVor you're going to get around
p205
aVto really reducing the amount of oil
p206
aVand reducing our dependence on oil.
p207
aVSo I'm saying this is kind of a distraction.
p208
aVBut it makes for good theater,
p209
aVand it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo the thing about water oil spills
p212
aVis that they are very politically galvanizing.
p213
aVI mean, these pictures \u2014 this is from the Santa Barbara spill.
p214
aVYou have these pictures of birds.
p215
aVThey really influence people.
p216
aVWhen the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969,
p217
aVit formed the environmental movement in its modern form.
p218
aVIt started Earth Day.
p219
aVIt also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act,
p220
aVthe Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.
p221
aVEverything that we are really stemmed from this period.
p222
aVI think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds
p223
aVand understand what happens to us.
p224
aVHere we are normally;
p225
aVwe're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless.
p226
aVWe look at these pictures
p227
aVand we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain.
p228
aVWe connect the dots in the supply chain.
p229
aVAnd we have this kind of \u2014
p230
aVas voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment.
p231
aVThis is why these moments of these oil spills
p232
aVare so important.
p233
aVBut it's also really important that we don't get distracted
p234
aVby the theater or the morals of it.
p235
aVWe actually need to go in
p236
aVand work on the roots of the problem.
p237
aa(lp238
VOne of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills
p239
aVwas that we really worked on some of the symptoms.
p240
aVWe were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive
p241
aVabout what happened.
p242
aVAnd so what we did was, actually,
p243
aVwe made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.
p244
aVWe stopped drilling in ANWR,
p245
aVbut we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.
p246
aVIn fact, it's continued to increase.
p247
aVThe only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume
p248
aVis much higher prices.
p249
aVAs you can see, our own production has fallen off
p250
aVas our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out.
p251
aVWe only have two percent of the world's oil reserves;
p252
aV65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.
p253
aa(lp254
VOne of the things that's happened because of this
p255
aVis that, since 1969,
p256
aVthe country of Nigeria, or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil,
p257
aVwhich is the delta \u2014 which is two times the size of Maryland \u2014
p258
aVhas had thousands of oil spills a year.
p259
aVI mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills
p260
aVwhen we import oil from places
p261
aVwithout tight environmental regulations.
p262
aVThat has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill
p263
aVevery year since 1969.
p264
aVAnd we can wrap our heads around the spills,
p265
aVbecause that's what we see here,
p266
aVbut in fact, these guys actually live in a war zone.
p267
aVThere's a thousand battle-related deaths a year
p268
aVin this area twice the size of Maryland,
p269
aVand it's all related to the oil.
p270
aVAnd these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S.,
p271
aVthey might be actually here in this room.
p272
aVThey have degrees in political science, degrees in business \u2014
p273
aVthey're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing.
p274
aVAnd it's sort of one of the other groups of people
p275
aVwho pay a price for us.
p276
aa(lp277
VThe other thing that we've done,
p278
aVas we've continued to increase demand,
p279
aVis that we kind of play a shell game with the costs.
p280
aVOne of the places we put in a big oil project
p281
aVin Chad, with Exxon.
p282
aVSo the U.S. taxpayer paid for it;
p283
aVthe World Bank, Exxon paid for it.
p284
aVWe put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem.
p285
aVI was there in 2003.
p286
aVWe were driving along this dark, dark road,
p287
aVand the guy in the green stepped out,
p288
aVand I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it."
p289
aVAnd then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out,
p290
aVand we realized it was okay.
p291
aVThey have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.
p292
aVBut at the same time,
p293
aVChad has become much more unstable,
p294
aVand we are not paying for that price at the pump.
p295
aVWe pay for it in our taxes on April 15th.
p296
aa(lp297
VWe do the same thing
p298
aVwith the price of policing the Persian Gulf
p299
aVand keeping the shipping lanes open.
p300
aVThis is 1988 \u2014
p301
aVwe actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.
p302
aVThat was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there
p303
aVthat we do not pay for at the pump.
p304
aVWe pay for it on April 15th,
p305
aVand we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement.
p306
aVThe other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil
p307
aVand our increased consumption
p308
aVis the Gulf of Mexico,
p309
aVwhich was not part of the moratoriums.
p310
aVNow what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 as you can see,
p311
aVthis is the Minerals Management diagram
p312
aVof wells for gas and oil.
p313
aVIt's become this intense industrialized zone.
p314
aVIt doesn't have the same resonance for us
p315
aVthat the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has,
p316
aVbut it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary.
p317
aVAlso, every time you buy gasoline in the United States,
p318
aVhalf of it is actually being refined along the coast,
p319
aVbecause the Gulf actually has
p320
aVabout 50 percent of our refining capacity
p321
aVand a lot of our marine terminals as well.
p322
aVSo the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us
p323
aVthrough a less-clean environment.
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd finally, American families also pay a price for oil.
p326
aVNow on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high
p327
aVwhen you consider the actual cost of the oil,
p328
aVbut on the other hand,
p329
aVthe fact that people have no other transit options
p330
aVmeans that they pay a large amount of their income
p331
aVinto just getting back and forth to work,
p332
aVgenerally in a fairly crummy car.
p333
aVIf you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids,
p334
aVthey might have three jobs or more,
p335
aVand then they have to really commute.
p336
aVThey're actually spending more on their car and fuel
p337
aVthan they are on taxes or on health care.
p338
aVAnd the same thing happens
p339
aVat the 50th percentile, around 80,000.
p340
aVGasoline costs are a tremendous drain
p341
aVon the American economy,
p342
aVbut they're also a drain on individual families
p343
aVand it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo, what I'm going to talk to you about now is:
p346
aVwhat do we have to do this time?
p347
aVWhat are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused?
p348
aVOne thing is \u2014 we need to stay away from the theater.
p349
aVWe need to stay away from the moratoriums.
p350
aVWe need to focus really back again
p351
aVon the molecules.
p352
aVThe moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus
p353
aVon the molecules on the oil.
p354
aVOne of the things that we also need to do,
p355
aVis we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves
p356
aVinto thinking that you can have a green world,
p357
aVbefore you reduce the amount of oil that we use.
p358
aVWe need to focus on reducing the oil.
p359
aa(lp360
VWhat you see in this top drawing is a schematic
p361
aVof how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy.
p362
aVIt comes in on the side \u2014 the useful stuff is the dark gray,
p363
aVand the un-useful stuff,
p364
aVwhich is called the rejected energy \u2014 the waste,
p365
aVgoes up to the top.
p366
aVNow you can see that the waste far outweighs
p367
aVthe actually useful amount.
p368
aVAnd one of the things that we need to do
p369
aVis, not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles
p370
aVand make them much more efficient,
p371
aVbut we also need to fix the economy in general.
p372
aa(lp373
VWe need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel.
p374
aVFor example, we have an insurance system
p375
aVwhere the person who drives 20,000 miles a year
p376
aVpays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000.
p377
aVWe actually encourage people to drive more.
p378
aVWe have policies that reward sprawl \u2014 we have all kinds of policies.
p379
aVWe need to have more mobility choices.
p380
aVWe need to make the gas price
p381
aVbetter reflect the real cost of oil.
p382
aVAnd we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry,
p383
aVwhich is at least 10 billion dollars a year,
p384
aVinto something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute.
p385
aVWhether that's getting a much more efficient car
p386
aVand also kind of building markets
p387
aVfor new cars and new fuels down the road,
p388
aVthis is where we need to be.
p389
aVWe need to kind of rationalize this whole thing,
p390
aVand you can find more about this policy.
p391
aVIt's called STRONG, which is "Secure Transportation
p392
aVReducing Oil Needs Gradually,"
p393
aVand the idea is instead of being helpless, we need to be more strong.
p394
aVThey're up at NewAmerica.net.
p395
aVWhat's important about these
p396
aVis that we try to move
p397
aVfrom feeling helpless at the pump,
p398
aVto actually being active
p399
aVand to really sort of thinking about who we are,
p400
aVhaving kind of that special moment,
p401
aVwhere we connect the dots actually at the pump.
p402
aa(lp403
VNow supposedly, oil taxes
p404
aVare the third rail of American politics \u2014 the no-fly zone.
p405
aVI actually \u2014 I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil
p406
aVis probably too much,
p407
aVbut I think that if we started this year
p408
aVwith three cents a gallon on gasoline,
p409
aVand upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year,
p410
aVall the way up to 30 cents by 2020,
p411
aVthat we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption,
p412
aVand at the same time we would give people time to prepare,
p413
aVtime to respond,
p414
aVand we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.
p415
aVLet me give you a little sense of how this would work.
p416
aa(lp417
VThis is a gas receipt, hypothetically, for a year from now.
p418
aVThe first thing that you have on the tax is \u2014
p419
aVyou have a tax for a stronger America \u2014 33 cents.
p420
aVSo you're not helpless at the pump.
p421
aVAnd the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign,
p422
aVvery similar to what you would find
p423
aVon a cigarette pack.
p424
aVAnd what it says is, "The National Academy of Sciences
p425

p426
aVcreates 29 cents in health care costs."
p427
aVThat's a lot.
p428
aVAnd so this \u2014 you can see that you're paying considerably less
p429
aVthan the health care costs on the tax.
p430
aVAnd also, the hope is that
p431
aVyou start to be connected to the whole greater system.
p432
aVAnd at the same time, you have a number that you can call
p433
aVto get more information on commuting,
p434
aVor a low-interest loan on a different kind of car,
p435
aVor whatever it is you're going to need
p436
aVto actually reduce your gasoline dependence.
p437
aVWith this whole sort of suite of policies,
p438
aVwe could actually reduce our gasoline consumption \u2014
p439
aVor our oil consumption \u2014
p440
aVby 20 percent by 2020.
p441
aVSo, three million barrels a day.
p442
aa(lp443
VBut in order to do this,
p444
aVone of the things we really need to do, is we need to remember
p445
aVwe are people of the hydrocarbon.
p446
aVWe need to keep or minds on the molecules
p447
aVand not get distracted by the theater,
p448
aVnot get distracted by the cognitive dissonance
p449
aVof the green possibilities that are out there.
p450
aVWe need to kind of get down and do the gritty work
p451
aVof reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules.

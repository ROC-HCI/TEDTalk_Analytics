VLooking deeply inside nature,
p5
aVthrough the magnifying glass of science,
p6
aVdesigners extract principles, processes and materials
p7
aVthat are forming the very basis of design methodology.
p8
aVFrom synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials,
p9
aVto computational methods that emulate neural processes,
p10
aVnature is driving design.
p11
aVDesign is also driving nature.
p12
aVIn realms of genetics, regenerative medicine and synthetic biology,
p13
aVdesigners are growing novel technologies,
p14
aVnot foreseen or anticipated by nature.
p15
aa(lp16
VBionics explores the interplay between biology and design.
p17
aVAs you can see, my legs are bionic.
p18
aVToday, I will tell human stories of bionic integration;
p19
aVhow electromechanics attached to the body, and implanted inside the body
p20
aVare beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability,
p21
aVbetween human limitation and human potential.
p22
aa(lp23
VBionics has defined my physicality.
p24
aVIn 1982, both of my legs were amputated
p25
aVdue to tissue damage from frostbite,
p26
aVincurred during a mountain-climbing accident.
p27
aVAt that time, I didn't view my body as broken.
p28
aVI reasoned that a human being can never be "broken."
p29
aVTechnology is broken.
p30
aVTechnology is inadequate.
p31
aVThis simple but powerful idea was a call to arms,
p32
aVto advance technology for the elimination of my own disability,
p33
aVand ultimately, the disability of others.
p34
aVI began by developing specialized limbs
p35
aVthat allowed me to return to the vertical world
p36
aVof rock and ice climbing.
p37
aVI quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable;
p38
aVable to take on any form, any function \u2014
p39
aVa blank slate for which to create,
p40
aVperhaps, structures that could extend beyond biological capability.
p41
aVI made my height adjustable.
p42
aVI could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VSo when I was feeling bad about myself,
p47
aVinsecure, I would jack my height up.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VBut when I was feeling confident and suave,
p52
aVI would knock my height down a notch, just to give the competition a chance.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VNarrow-edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures,
p59
aVwhere the human foot cannot penetrate,
p60
aVand spiked feet enabled me to climb vertical ice walls,
p61
aVwithout ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue.
p62
aVThrough technological innovation,
p63
aVI returned to my sport, stronger and better.
p64
aVTechnology had eliminated my disability,
p65
aVand allowed me a new climbing prowess.
p66
aVAs a young man, I imagined a future world where technology so advanced
p67
aVcould rid the world of disability,
p68
aVa world in which neural implants would allow
p69
aVthe visually impaired to see.
p70
aVA world in which the paralyzed could walk, via body exoskeletons.
p71
aa(lp72
VSadly, because of deficiencies in technology,
p73
aVdisability is rampant in the world.
p74
aVThis gentleman is missing three limbs.
p75
aVAs a testimony to current technology, he is out of the wheelchair,
p76
aVbut we need to do a better job in bionics, to allow, one day, full rehabilitation
p77
aVfor a person with this level of injury.
p78
aVAt the MIT Media Lab, we've established the Center for Extreme Bionics.
p79
aVThe mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science
p80
aVand technological capability
p81
aVthat will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans,
p82
aVacross a broad range of brain and body disabilities.
p83
aa(lp84
VToday, I'm going to tell you how my legs function, how they work,
p85
aVas a case in point for this center.
p86
aVNow, I made sure to shave my legs last night,
p87
aVbecause I knew I'd be showing them off.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VBionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces.
p92
aVThere's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs:
p93
aVmechanical, how my limbs are attached to my biological body;
p94
aVdynamic, how they move like flesh and bone;
p95
aVand electrical, how they communicate with my nervous system.
p96
aa(lp97
VI'll begin with mechanical interface.
p98
aVIn the area of design, we still do not understand
p99
aVhow to attach devices to the body mechanically.
p100
aVIt's extraordinary to me that in this day and age,
p101
aVone of the most mature, oldest technologies
p102
aVin the human timeline, the shoe, still gives us blisters.
p103
aVHow can this be?
p104
aVWe have no idea how to attach things to our bodies.
p105
aVThis is the beautifully lyrical design work
p106
aVof Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab,
p107
aVshowing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances,
p108
aVshown here by color variation in this 3D-printed model.
p109
aVImagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it,
p110
aVwhen you need it, for optimal support and flexibility,
p111
aVwithout ever causing discomfort.
p112
aa(lp113
VMy bionic limbs are attached to my biological body
p114
aVvia synthetic skins with stiffness variations,
p115
aVthat mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics.
p116
aVTo achieve that mirroring, we first developed a mathematical model
p117
aVof my biological limb.
p118
aVTo that end, we used imaging tools such as MRI,
p119
aVto look inside my body,
p120
aVto figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues.
p121
aVWe also took robotic tools \u2014
p122
aVhere's a 14-actuator circle that goes around the biological limb.
p123
aVThe actuators come in, find the surface of the limb,
p124
aVmeasure its unloaded shape,
p125
aVand then they push on the tissues
p126
aVto measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point.
p127
aa(lp128
VWe combine these imaging and robotic data
p129
aVto build a mathematical description of my biological limb, shown on the left.
p130
aVYou see a bunch of points, or nodes?
p131
aVAt each node, there's a color that represents tissue compliance.
p132
aVWe then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin,
p133
aVshown on the right.
p134
aVAnd we've discovered optimality is:
p135
aVwhere the body is stiff, the synthetic skin should be soft,
p136
aVwhere the body is soft, the synthetic skin is stiff,
p137
aVand this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances.
p138
aVWith this framework, we've produced bionic limbs
p139
aVthat are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn.
p140
aVClearly, in the future, our clothing, our shoes, our braces, our prostheses,
p141
aVwill no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies,
p142
aVbut rather, data-driven quantitative frameworks.
p143
aVIn that future, our shoes will no longer give us blisters.
p144
aa(lp145
VWe're also embedding sensing and smart materials
p146
aVinto the synthetic skins.
p147
aVThis is a material developed by SRI International, California.
p148
aVUnder electrostatic effect, it changes stiffness.
p149
aVSo under zero voltage, the material is compliant,
p150
aVit's floppy like paper.
p151
aVThen the button's pushed, a voltage is applied,
p152
aVand it becomes stiff as a board.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Tapping sounds)
p155
aa(lp156
VWe embed this material into the synthetic skin
p157
aVthat attaches my bionic limb to my biological body.
p158
aVWhen I walk here, it's no voltage.
p159
aVMy interface is soft and compliant.
p160
aVThe button's pushed, voltage is applied, and it stiffens,
p161
aVoffering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb.
p162
aa(lp163
VWe're also building exoskeletons.
p164
aVThis exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft
p165
aVin just the right areas of the running cycle,
p166
aVto protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation.
p167
aVIn the future, we'll all be wearing exoskeletons
p168
aVin common activities, such as running.
p169
aa(lp170
VNext, dynamic interface.
p171
aVHow do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone?
p172
aVAt my MIT lab, we study how humans with normal physiologies
p173
aVstand, walk and run.
p174
aVWhat are the muscles doing,
p175
aVand how are they controlled by the spinal cord?
p176
aVThis basic science motivates what we build.
p177
aVWe're building bionic ankles, knees and hips.
p178
aVWe're building body parts from the ground up.
p179
aVThe bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs.
p180
aVThey've been fitted to nearly 1,000 patients,
p181
aV400 of which have been wounded U.S. soldiers.
p182
aa(lp183
VHow does it work?
p184
aa(lp185
VAt heel strike, under computer control,
p186
aVthe system controls stiffness,
p187
aVto attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground.
p188
aVThen at mid-stance, the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers
p189
aVto lift the person into the walking stride,
p190
aVcomparable to how muscles work in the calf region.
p191
aVThis bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients.
p192
aVSo on the left, you see the bionic device worn by a lady,
p193
aVon the right, a passive device worn by the same lady,
p194
aVthat fails to emulate normal muscle function,
p195
aVenabling her to do something everyone should be able to do:
p196
aVgo up and down their steps at home.
p197
aVBionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats.
p198
aVHere's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway.
p199
aVThis is Steve Martin \u2014 not the comedian \u2014
p200
aVwho lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan.
p201
aa(lp202
VWe're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles,
p203
aVthat wrap around the biological limb.
p204
aVThis gentleman does not have any leg condition, any disability.
p205
aVHe has a normal physiology,
p206
aVso these exoskeletons are applying muscle-like torques and powers,
p207
aVso that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers.
p208
aVThis is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking.
p209
aVIt significantly reduces metabolic cost.
p210
aVIt's so profound in its augmentation,
p211
aVthat when a normal, healthy person wears the device for 40 minutes
p212
aVand then takes it off,
p213
aVtheir own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward.
p214
aVWe're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies
p215
aVwill make us stronger and faster and more efficient.
p216
aa(lp217
VMoving on to electrical interface:
p218
aVHow do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system?
p219
aVAcross my residual limb are electrodes
p220
aVthat measure the electrical pulse of my muscles.
p221
aVThat's communicated to the bionic limb,
p222
aVso when I think about moving my phantom limb,
p223
aVthe robot tracks those movement desires.
p224
aVThis diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled.
p225
aVSo we model the missing biological limb,
p226
aVand we've discovered what reflexes occurred,
p227
aVhow the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles.
p228
aVAnd that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb.
p229
aVWhat we've done, then, is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex,
p230
aVthe modeled spinal reflex, with the neural signal,
p231
aVso when I relax my muscles in my residual limb,
p232
aVI get very little torque and power,
p233
aVbut the more I fire my muscles, the more torque I get,
p234
aVand I can even run.
p235
aVAnd that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command.
p236
aVFeels great.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VWe want to go a step further.
p241
aVWe want to actually close the loop
p242
aVbetween the human and the bionic external limb.
p243
aVWe're doing experiments
p244
aVwhere we're growing nerves, transected nerves,
p245
aVthrough channels, or micro-channel arrays.
p246
aVOn the other side of the channel,
p247
aVthe nerve then attaches to cells,
p248
aVskin cells and muscle cells.
p249
aVIn the motor channels, we can sense how the person wishes to move.
p250
aVThat can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb,
p251
aVthen [sensory information] on the bionic limb
p252
aVcan be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels,
p253
aVsensory channels.
p254
aVSo when this is fully developed and for human use,
p255
aVpersons like myself will not only have
p256
aVsynthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone,
p257
aVbut actually feel like flesh and bone.
p258
aa(lp259
VThis video shows Lisa Mallette,
p260
aVshortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs.
p261
aVIndeed, bionics is making a profound difference in people's lives.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.
p264
aVLM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!
p265
aa(lp266

p267
aa(lp268
VLM: It's just like I've got a real leg!
p269
aa(lp270
VWoman: Now, don't start running.
p271
aa(lp272
VMan: Now turn around, and do the same thing walking up,
p273
aVbut get on your heel to toe, like you would normally just walk on level ground.
p274
aVTry to walk right up the hill.
p275
aa(lp276
VLM: Oh my God.
p277
aa(lp278
VMan: Is it pushing you up?
p279
aa(lp280
VLM: Yes! I'm not even \u2014 I can't even describe it.
p281
aa(lp282
VMan: It's pushing you right up.
p283
aa(lp284
VHugh Herr: Next week, I'm visiting the Center \u2014
p285
aa(lp286
VThank you. Thank you.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you.
p291
aa(lp292
VNext week I'm visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
p293
aVand I'm going to try to convince CMS
p294
aVto grant appropriate code language and pricing,
p295
aVso this technology can be made available to the patients that need it.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Applause)
p298
aa(lp299
VThank you.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VIt's not well appreciated, but over half of the world's population
p304
aVsuffers from some form of cognitive, emotional, sensory or motor condition,
p305
aVand because of poor technology, too often, conditions result in disability
p306
aVand a poorer quality of life.
p307
aVBasic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights.
p308
aVEvery person should have the right to live life without disability
p309
aVif they so choose \u2014
p310
aVthe right to live life without severe depression;
p311
aVthe right to see a loved one, in the case of seeing-impaired;
p312
aVor the right to walk or to dance,
p313
aVin the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation.
p314
aVAs a society, we can achieve these human rights,
p315
aVif we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled.
p316
aVA person can never be broken.
p317
aVOur built environment, our technologies,
p318
aVare broken and disabled.
p319
aVWe the people need not accept our limitations,
p320
aVbut can transcend disability through technological innovation.
p321
aVIndeed, through fundamental advances in bionics in this century,
p322
aVwe will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience,
p323
aVand we will end disability.
p324
aa(lp325
VI'd like to finish up with one more story, a beautiful story.
p326
aVThe story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.
p327
aVAdrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack.
p328
aVI met Adrianne when this photo was taken, at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
p329
aVAdrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.
p330
aa(lp331
VAdrianne breathes and lives dance.
p332
aVIt is her expression. It is her art form.
p333
aVNaturally, when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack,
p334
aVshe wanted to return to the dance floor.
p335
aa(lp336
VAfter meeting her and driving home in my car,
p337
aVI thought, I'm an MIT professor. I have resources.
p338
aVLet's build her a bionic limb,
p339
aVto enable her to go back to her life of dance.
p340
aVI brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics,
p341
aVrobotics, machine learning and biomechanics,
p342
aVand over a 200-day research period, we studied dance.
p343
aVWe brought in dancers with biological limbs,
p344
aVand we studied how they move,
p345
aVwhat forces they apply on the dance floor,
p346
aVand we took those data,
p347
aVand we put forth fundamental principles of dance,
p348
aVreflexive dance capability,
p349
aVand we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb.
p350
aVBionics is not only about making people stronger and faster.
p351
aVOur expression, our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics.
p352
aa(lp353
VIt was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack.
p354
aVIn 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor.
p355
aVIn 200 days, we put her back.
p356
aVWe will not be intimidated, brought down, diminished, conquered or stopped
p357
aVby acts of violence.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Applause)
p360
aa(lp361
VLadies and gentlemen, please allow me to introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis,
p362
aVher first performance since the attack.
p363
aVShe's dancing with Christian Lightner.

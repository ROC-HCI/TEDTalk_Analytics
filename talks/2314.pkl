VFor more than 100 years,
p5
aVthe telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments.
p6
aa(lp7
VFor much of this time, this assistance was manual.
p8
aVSurveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand.
p9
aVCalls were recorded to tape.
p10
aVBut as in so many other industries,
p11
aVcomputing has changed everything.
p12
aVThe telephone companies built surveillance features
p13
aVinto the very core of their networks.
p14
aVI want that to sink in for a second:
p15
aVOur telephones and the networks that carry our calls
p16
aVwere wired for surveillance first.
p17
aVFirst and foremost.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse,
p20
aVyour children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone,
p21
aVsomeone could be listening.
p22
aVNow, that someone might be your own government;
p23
aVit could also be another government, a foreign intelligence service,
p24
aVor a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker
p25
aVor any other party that breaks into the surveillance system,
p26
aVthat hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority,
p29
aVSilicon Valley companies have not.
p30
aVAnd increasingly, over the last couple years,
p31
aVSilicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology
p32
aVinto their communications products
p33
aVthat makes surveillance extremely difficult.
p34
aa(lp35
VFor example, many of you might have an iPhone,
p36
aVand if you use an iPhone to send a text message
p37
aVto other people who have an iPhone,
p38
aVthose text messages cannot easily be wiretapped.
p39
aVAnd in fact, according to Apple,
p40
aVthey're not able to even see the text messages themselves.
p41
aVLikewise, if you use FaceTime to make an audio call
p42
aVor a video call with one of your friends or loved ones,
p43
aVthat, too, cannot be easily wiretapped.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd it's not just Apple.
p46
aVWhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook
p47
aVand used by hundreds of millions of people around the world,
p48
aValso has built strong encryption technology into its product,
p49
aVwhich means that people in the Global South can easily communicate
p50
aVwithout their governments, often authoritarian,
p51
aVwiretapping their text messages.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call \u2014
p54
aVanytime, anywhere \u2014
p55
aVyou might imagine that government officials are not very happy.
p56
aVAnd in fact, that's what's happening.
p57
aVGovernment officials are extremely mad.
p58
aVAnd they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available.
p59
aVWhat upsets them the most
p60
aVis that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products
p61
aVand turned them on by default.
p62
aVIt's the default piece that matters.
p63
aa(lp64
VIn short, the tech companies have democratized encryption.
p65
aVAnd so, government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron,
p66
aVthey believe that all communications \u2014 emails, texts, voice calls \u2014
p67
aVall of these should be available to governments,
p68
aVand encryption is making that difficult.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, look \u2014 I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view.
p71
aVWe live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world,
p72
aVand there really are bad people out there.
p73
aVThere are terrorists and other serious national security threats
p74
aVthat I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut those surveillance features come at a cost.
p77
aVThe reason for that is
p78
aVthat there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop,
p79
aVor a drug dealer's cell phone.
p80
aVWe all use the same communications devices.
p81
aVWhat that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls
p82
aVor the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted,
p83
aVthen so can the rest of ours, too.
p84
aVAnd I think we really need to ask:
p85
aVShould a billion people around the world be using devices
p86
aVthat are wiretap friendly?
p87
aa(lp88
VSo the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described \u2014
p89
aVthis is not imaginary.
p90
aVIn 2009,
p91
aVthe surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks \u2014
p92
aVthe systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests
p93
aVfrom the police \u2014
p94
aVthose systems were compromised by the Chinese government,
p95
aVbecause the Chinese government wanted to figure out
p96
aVwhich of their own agents the US government was monitoring.
p97
aa(lp98
VBy the same token,
p99
aVin 2004, the surveillance system built into the network
p100
aVof Vodafone Greece \u2014 Greece's largest telephone company \u2014
p101
aVwas compromised by an unknown entity,
p102
aVand that feature, the surveillance feature,
p103
aVwas used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister
p104
aVand members of the Greek cabinet.
p105
aVThe foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features,
p108
aVor backdoors.
p109
aVWhen you build a backdoor into a communications network
p110
aVor piece of technology,
p111
aVyou have no way of controlling who's going to go through it.
p112
aVYou have no way of controlling
p113
aVwhether it'll be used by your side or the other side,
p114
aVby good guys, or by bad guys.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd so for that reason, I think that it's better
p117
aVto build networks to be as secure as possible.
p118
aVYes, this means that in the future,
p119
aVencryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult.
p120
aVIt means that the police are going to have a tougher time
p121
aVcatching bad guys.
p122
aVBut the alternative would mean to live in a world
p123
aVwhere anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled
p124
aVby criminals, by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies.
p125
aVAnd I don't want to live in that kind of world.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd so right now, you probably have the tools
p128
aVto thwart many kinds of government surveillance
p129
aValready on your phones and already in your pockets,
p130
aVyou just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are,
p131
aVor how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd so, my message to you is this:
p134
aVWe need to use these tools.
p135
aVWe need to secure our telephone calls.
p136
aVWe need to secure our text messages.
p137
aVI want you to use these tools.
p138
aVI want you to tell your loved ones, I want you to tell your colleagues:
p139
aVUse these encrypted communications tools.
p140
aVDon't just use them because they're cheap and easy,
p141
aVbut use them because they're secure.
p142
aa(lp143
VThank you.

On a landline, it could be anyone, says privacy activist Christopher Soghoian, because surveillance backdoors are built into the phone system by default, to allow governments to listen in. But then again, so could a foreign intelligence service ... or a criminal. Which is why, says Soghoian, some tech companies are resisting governments\' call to build the same backdoors into mobile phones and new messaging systems.

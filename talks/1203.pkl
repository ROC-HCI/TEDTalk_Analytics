VEach of you possesses
p5
aVthe most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait
p6
aVthat natural selection has ever devised.
p7
aVIt's a piece of neural audio technology
p8
aVfor rewiring other people's minds.
p9
aVI'm talking about your language, of course,
p10
aVbecause it allows you to implant a thought from your mind
p11
aVdirectly into someone else's mind,
p12
aVand they can attempt to do the same to you,
p13
aVwithout either of you having to perform surgery.
p14
aVInstead, when you speak,
p15
aVyou're actually using a form of telemetry
p16
aVnot so different
p17
aVfrom the remote control device for your television.
p18
aVIt's just that, whereas that device
p19
aVrelies on pulses of infrared light,
p20
aVyour language relies on pulses,
p21
aVdiscrete pulses, of sound.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd just as you use the remote control device
p24
aVto alter the internal settings of your television
p25
aVto suit your mood,
p26
aVyou use your language
p27
aVto alter the settings inside someone else's brain
p28
aVto suit your interests.
p29
aVLanguages are genes talking,
p30
aVgetting things that they want.
p31
aVAnd just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby
p32
aVwhen it first discovers that, merely by uttering a sound,
p33
aVit can get objects to move across a room
p34
aVas if by magic,
p35
aVand maybe even into its mouth.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow language's subversive power
p38
aVhas been recognized throughout the ages
p39
aVin censorship, in books you can't read,
p40
aVphrases you can't use
p41
aVand words you can't say.
p42
aVIn fact, the Tower of Babel story in the Bible
p43
aVis a fable and warning
p44
aVabout the power of language.
p45
aVAccording to that story, early humans developed the conceit
p46
aVthat, by using their language to work together,
p47
aVthey could build a tower
p48
aVthat would take them all the way to heaven.
p49
aVNow God, angered at this attempt to usurp his power,
p50
aVdestroyed the tower,
p51
aVand then to ensure
p52
aVthat it would never be rebuilt,
p53
aVhe scattered the people by giving them different languages \u2014
p54
aVconfused them by giving them different languages.
p55
aVAnd this leads to the wonderful irony
p56
aVthat our languages exist to prevent us from communicating.
p57
aVEven today,
p58
aVwe know that there are words we cannot use,
p59
aVphrases we cannot say,
p60
aVbecause if we do so,
p61
aVwe might be accosted, jailed,
p62
aVor even killed.
p63
aVAnd all of this from a puff of air
p64
aVemanating from our mouths.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow all this fuss about a single one of our traits
p67
aVtells us there's something worth explaining.
p68
aVAnd that is how and why
p69
aVdid this remarkable trait evolve,
p70
aVand why did it evolve
p71
aVonly in our species?
p72
aVNow it's a little bit of a surprise
p73
aVthat to get an answer to that question,
p74
aVwe have to go to tool use
p75
aVin the chimpanzees.
p76
aVNow these chimpanzees are using tools,
p77
aVand we take that as a sign of their intelligence.
p78
aVBut if they really were intelligent,
p79
aVwhy would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground
p80
aVrather than a shovel?
p81
aVAnd if they really were intelligent,
p82
aVwhy would they crack open nuts with a rock?
p83
aVWhy wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts
p84
aVthat somebody else had already cracked open for them?
p85
aVWhy not? I mean, that's what we do.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow the reason the chimpanzees don't do that
p88
aVis that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call
p89
aVsocial learning.
p90
aVThey seem to lack the ability
p91
aVto learn from others
p92
aVby copying or imitating
p93
aVor simply watching.
p94
aVAs a result,
p95
aVthey can't improve on others' ideas
p96
aVor learn from others' mistakes \u2014
p97
aVbenefit from others' wisdom.
p98
aVAnd so they just do the same thing
p99
aVover and over and over again.
p100
aVIn fact, we could go away for a million years and come back
p101
aVand these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing
p102
aVwith the same sticks for the termites
p103
aVand the same rocks to crack open the nuts.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow this may sound arrogant, or even full of hubris.
p106
aVHow do we know this?
p107
aVBecause this is exactly what our ancestors, the Homo erectus, did.
p108
aVThese upright apes
p109
aVevolved on the African savanna
p110
aVabout two million years ago,
p111
aVand they made these splendid hand axes
p112
aVthat fit wonderfully into your hands.
p113
aVBut if we look at the fossil record,
p114
aVwe see that they made the same hand axe
p115
aVover and over and over again
p116
aVfor one million years.
p117
aVYou can follow it through the fossil record.
p118
aVNow if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived,
p119
aVwhat their generation time was,
p120
aVthat's about 40,000 generations
p121
aVof parents to offspring, and other individuals watching,
p122
aVin which that hand axe didn't change.
p123
aVIt's not even clear
p124
aVthat our very close genetic relatives, the Neanderthals,
p125
aVhad social learning.
p126
aVSure enough, their tools were more complicated
p127
aVthan those of Homo erectus,
p128
aVbut they too showed very little change
p129
aVover the 300,000 years or so
p130
aVthat those species, the Neanderthals,
p131
aVlived in Eurasia.
p132
aa(lp133
VOkay, so what this tells us
p134
aVis that, contrary to the old adage,
p135
aV"monkey see, monkey do,"
p136
aVthe surprise really is
p137
aVthat all of the other animals
p138
aVreally cannot do that \u2014 at least not very much.
p139
aVAnd even this picture
p140
aVhas the suspicious taint of being rigged about it \u2014
p141
aVsomething from a Barnum & Bailey circus.
p142
aa(lp143
VBut by comparison,
p144
aVwe can learn.
p145
aVWe can learn by watching other people
p146
aVand copying or imitating
p147
aVwhat they can do.
p148
aVWe can then choose, from among a range of options,
p149
aVthe best one.
p150
aVWe can benefit from others' ideas.
p151
aVWe can build on their wisdom.
p152
aVAnd as a result, our ideas do accumulate,
p153
aVand our technology progresses.
p154
aVAnd this cumulative cultural adaptation,
p155
aVas anthropologists call
p156
aVthis accumulation of ideas,
p157
aVis responsible for everything around you
p158
aVin your bustling and teeming everyday lives.
p159
aVI mean the world has changed out of all proportion
p160
aVto what we would recognize
p161
aVeven 1,000 or 2,000 years ago.
p162
aVAnd all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation.
p163
aVThe chairs you're sitting in, the lights in this auditorium,
p164
aVmy microphone, the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you \u2014
p165
aVall are a result
p166
aVof cumulative cultural adaptation.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow to many commentators,
p169
aVcumulative cultural adaptation, or social learning,
p170
aVis job done, end of story.
p171
aVOur species can make stuff,
p172
aVtherefore we prospered in a way that no other species has.
p173
aVIn fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" \u2014
p174
aVas I just said, all the stuff around us.
p175
aVBut in fact, it turns out
p176
aVthat some time around 200,000 years ago,
p177
aVwhen our species first arose
p178
aVand acquired social learning,
p179
aVthat this was really the beginning of our story,
p180
aVnot the end of our story.
p181
aVBecause our acquisition of social learning
p182
aVwould create a social and evolutionary dilemma,
p183
aVthe resolution of which, it's fair to say,
p184
aVwould determine not only the future course of our psychology,
p185
aVbut the future course of the entire world.
p186
aVAnd most importantly for this,
p187
aVit'll tell us why we have language.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd the reason that dilemma arose
p190
aVis, it turns out, that social learning is visual theft.
p191
aVIf I can learn by watching you,
p192
aVI can steal your best ideas,
p193
aVand I can benefit from your efforts,
p194
aVwithout having to put in the time and energy that you did
p195
aVinto developing them.
p196
aVIf I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish,
p197
aVor I can watch how you flake your hand axe
p198
aVto make it better,
p199
aVor if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch,
p200
aVI can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills,
p201
aVand maybe even catch that fish
p202
aVbefore you do.
p203
aVSocial learning really is visual theft.
p204
aVAnd in any species that acquired it,
p205
aVit would behoove you
p206
aVto hide your best ideas,
p207
aVlest somebody steal them from you.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd so some time around 200,000 years ago,
p210
aVour species confronted this crisis.
p211
aVAnd we really had only two options
p212
aVfor dealing with the conflicts
p213
aVthat visual theft would bring.
p214
aVOne of those options
p215
aVwas that we could have retreated
p216
aVinto small family groups.
p217
aVBecause then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge
p218
aVwould flow just to our relatives.
p219
aVHad we chosen this option,
p220
aVsometime around 200,000 years ago,
p221
aVwe would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were
p222
aVwhen we first entered Europe 40,000 years ago.
p223
aVAnd this is because in small groups
p224
aVthere are fewer ideas, there are fewer innovations.
p225
aVAnd small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck.
p226
aVSo if we'd chosen that path,
p227
aVour evolutionary path would have led into the forest \u2014
p228
aVand been a short one indeed.
p229
aa(lp230
VThe other option we could choose
p231
aVwas to develop the systems of communication
p232
aVthat would allow us to share ideas
p233
aVand to cooperate amongst others.
p234
aVChoosing this option would mean
p235
aVthat a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom
p236
aVwould become available to any one individual
p237
aVthan would ever arise from within an individual family
p238
aVor an individual person on their own.
p239
aVWell, we chose the second option,
p240
aVand language is the result.
p241
aa(lp242
VLanguage evolved to solve the crisis
p243
aVof visual theft.
p244
aVLanguage is a piece of social technology
p245
aVfor enhancing the benefits of cooperation \u2014
p246
aVfor reaching agreements, for striking deals
p247
aVand for coordinating our activities.
p248
aVAnd you can see that, in a developing society
p249
aVthat was beginning to acquire language,
p250
aVnot having language
p251
aVwould be a like a bird without wings.
p252
aVJust as wings open up this sphere of air
p253
aVfor birds to exploit,
p254
aVlanguage opened up the sphere of cooperation
p255
aVfor humans to exploit.
p256
aVAnd we take this utterly for granted,
p257
aVbecause we're a species that is so at home with language,
p258
aa(lp259
Vbut you have to realize
p260
aVthat even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in
p261
aVare utterly dependent upon language.
p262
aVAnd to see why, consider two scenarios
p263
aVfrom early in our evolution.
p264
aVLet's imagine that you are really good
p265
aVat making arrowheads,
p266
aVbut you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts
p267
aVwith the flight feathers attached.
p268
aVTwo other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts,
p269
aVbut they're hopeless at making the arrowheads.
p270
aVSo what you do is \u2014
p271
aVone of those people has not really acquired language yet.
p272
aVAnd let's pretend the other one is good at language skills.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads,
p275
aVand you walk up to the one that can't speak very well,
p276
aVand you put the arrowheads down in front of him,
p277
aVhoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads
p278
aVfor finished arrows.
p279
aVBut he looks at the pile of arrowheads, thinks they're a gift,
p280
aVpicks them up, smiles and walks off.
p281
aVNow you pursue this guy, gesticulating.
p282
aVA scuffle ensues and you get stabbed
p283
aVwith one of your own arrowheads.
p284
aVOkay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language.
p285
aVYou put down your arrowheads and say,
p286
aV"I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you 50/50."
p287
aVThe other one says, "Fine. Looks good to me.
p288
aVWe'll do that."
p289
aVNow the job is done.
p290
aa(lp291
VOnce we have language,
p292
aVwe can put our ideas together and cooperate
p293
aVto have a prosperity
p294
aVthat we couldn't have before we acquired it.
p295
aVAnd this is why our species
p296
aVhas prospered around the world
p297
aVwhile the rest of the animals
p298
aVsit behind bars in zoos, languishing.
p299
aVThat's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals
p300
aVwhile the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground
p301
aVto extract termites.
p302
aVAll right, if this view of language
p303
aVand its value
p304
aVin solving the crisis of visual theft is true,
p305
aVany species that acquires it
p306
aVshould show an explosion of creativity and prosperity.
p307
aVAnd this is exactly what the archeological record shows.
p308
aa(lp309
VIf you look at our ancestors,
p310
aVthe Neanderthals and the Homo erectus, our immediate ancestors,
p311
aVthey're confined to small regions of the world.
p312
aVBut when our species arose
p313
aVabout 200,000 years ago,
p314
aVsometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa
p315
aVand spread around the entire world,
p316
aVoccupying nearly every habitat on Earth.
p317
aVNow whereas other species are confined
p318
aVto places that their genes adapt them to,
p319
aVwith social learning and language,
p320
aVwe could transform the environment
p321
aVto suit our needs.
p322
aVAnd so we prospered in a way
p323
aVthat no other animal has.
p324
aVLanguage really is
p325
aVthe most potent trait that has ever evolved.
p326
aVIt is the most valuable trait we have
p327
aVfor converting new lands and resources
p328
aVinto more people and their genes
p329
aVthat natural selection has ever devised.
p330
aa(lp331
VLanguage really is
p332
aVthe voice of our genes.
p333
aVNow having evolved language, though,
p334
aVwe did something peculiar,
p335
aVeven bizarre.
p336
aVAs we spread out around the world,
p337
aVwe developed thousands of different languages.
p338
aVCurrently, there are about seven or 8,000
p339
aVdifferent languages spoken on Earth.
p340
aVNow you might say, well, this is just natural.
p341
aVAs we diverge, our languages are naturally going to diverge.
p342
aVBut the real puzzle and irony
p343
aVis that the greatest density of different languages on Earth
p344
aVis found where people are most tightly packed together.
p345
aa(lp346
VIf we go to the island of Papua New Guinea,
p347
aVwe can find about 800 to 1,000
p348
aVdistinct human languages,
p349
aVdifferent human languages,
p350
aVspoken on that island alone.
p351
aVThere are places on that island
p352
aVwhere you can encounter a new language
p353
aVevery two or three miles.
p354
aVNow, incredible as this sounds,
p355
aVI once met a Papuan man, and I asked him if this could possibly be true.
p356
aVAnd he said to me, "Oh no.
p357
aVThey're far closer together than that."
p358
aVAnd it's true; there are places on that island
p359
aVwhere you can encounter a new language in under a mile.
p360
aVAnd this is also true of some remote oceanic islands.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd so it seems that we use our language,
p363
aVnot just to cooperate,
p364
aVbut to draw rings around our cooperative groups
p365
aVand to establish identities,
p366
aVand perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills
p367
aVfrom eavesdropping from outside.
p368
aVAnd we know this
p369
aVbecause when we study different language groups
p370
aVand associate them with their cultures,
p371
aVwe see that different languages
p372
aVslow the flow of ideas between groups.
p373
aVThey slow the flow of technologies.
p374
aVAnd they even slow the flow of genes.
p375
aVNow I can't speak for you,
p376
aVbut it seems to be the case
p377
aVthat we don't have sex with people we can't talk to.
p378
aV(Laughter)
p379
aVNow we have to counter that, though,
p380
aVagainst the evidence we've heard
p381
aVthat we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances
p382
aVwith the Neanderthals and the Denisovans.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
VOkay, this tendency we have,
p387
aVthis seemingly natural tendency we have,
p388
aVtowards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves,
p389
aVcrashes head first into our modern world.
p390
aVThis remarkable image
p391
aVis not a map of the world.
p392
aVIn fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.
p393
aVAnd when you plot those friendship links
p394
aVby their latitude and longitude,
p395
aVit literally draws a map of the world.
p396
aVOur modern world is communicating
p397
aVwith itself and with each other
p398
aVmore than it has
p399
aVat any time in its past.
p400
aVAnd that communication, that connectivity around the world,
p401
aVthat globalization
p402
aVnow raises a burden.
p403
aVBecause these different languages
p404
aVimpose a barrier, as we've just seen,
p405
aVto the transfer of goods and ideas
p406
aVand technologies and wisdom.
p407
aVAnd they impose a barrier to cooperation.
p408
aa(lp409
VAnd nowhere do we see that more clearly
p410
aVthan in the European Union,
p411
aVwhose 27 member countries
p412
aVspeak 23 official languages.
p413
aVThe European Union
p414
aVis now spending over one billion euros annually
p415
aVtranslating among their 23 official languages.
p416
aVThat's something on the order
p417
aVof 1.45 billion U.S. dollars
p418
aVon translation costs alone.
p419
aVNow think of the absurdity of this situation.
p420
aVIf 27 individuals
p421
aVfrom those 27 member states
p422
aVsat around table, speaking their 23 languages,
p423
aVsome very simple mathematics will tell you
p424
aVthat you need an army of 253 translators
p425
aVto anticipate all the pairwise possibilities.
p426
aVThe European Union employs a permanent staff
p427
aVof about 2,500 translators.
p428
aVAnd in 2007 alone \u2014
p429
aVand I'm sure there are more recent figures \u2014
p430
aVsomething on the order of 1.3 million pages
p431
aVwere translated into English alone.
p432
aa(lp433
VAnd so if language really is
p434
aVthe solution to the crisis of visual theft,
p435
aVif language really is
p436
aVthe conduit of our cooperation,
p437
aVthe technology that our species derived
p438
aVto promote the free flow and exchange of ideas,
p439
aVin our modern world,
p440
aVwe confront a question.
p441
aVAnd that question is whether
p442
aVin this modern, globalized world
p443
aVwe can really afford to have all these different languages.
p444
aa(lp445
VTo put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance
p446
aVin which functionally equivalent traits coexist.
p447
aVOne of them always drives the other extinct.
p448
aVAnd we see this in the inexorable march
p449
aVtowards standardization.
p450
aVThere are lots and lots of ways of measuring things \u2014
p451
aVweighing them and measuring their length \u2014
p452
aVbut the metric system is winning.
p453
aVThere are lots and lots of ways of measuring time,
p454
aVbut a really bizarre base 60 system
p455
aVknown as hours and minutes and seconds
p456
aVis nearly universal around the world.
p457
aVThere are many, many ways
p458
aVof imprinting CDs or DVDs,
p459
aVbut those are all being standardized as well.
p460
aVAnd you can probably think of many, many more
p461
aVin your own everyday lives.
p462
aa(lp463
VAnd so our modern world now
p464
aVis confronting us with a dilemma.
p465
aVAnd it's the dilemma
p466
aVthat this Chinese man faces,
p467
aVwho's language is spoken
p468
aVby more people in the world
p469
aVthan any other single language,
p470
aVand yet he is sitting at his blackboard,
p471
aVconverting Chinese phrases
p472
aVinto English language phrases.
p473
aVAnd what this does is it raises the possibility to us
p474
aVthat in a world in which we want to promote
p475
aVcooperation and exchange,
p476
aVand in a world that might be dependent more than ever before
p477
aVon cooperation
p478
aVto maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity,
p479
aVhis actions suggest to us

VMatt Ridley: Mark, one question.
p489
aVSvante found that the FOXP2 gene,
p490
aVwhich seems to be associated with language,
p491
aVwas also shared in the same form
p492
aVin Neanderthals as us.
p493
aVDo we have any idea
p494
aVhow we could have defeated Neanderthals
p495
aVif they also had language?
p496
aa(lp497
VMark Pagel: This is a very good question.
p498
aVSo many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP2
p499
aVthat seems to be implicated in some ways
p500
aVin the fine motor control that's associated with language.
p501
aVThe reason why I don't believe that tells us
p502
aVthat the Neanderthals had language
p503
aVis \u2014 here's a simple analogy:
p504
aVFerraris are cars that have engines.
p505
aVMy car has an engine,
p506
aVbut it's not a Ferrari.
p507
aVNow the simple answer then
p508
aVis that genes alone don't, all by themselves,
p509
aVdetermine the outcome
p510
aVof very complicated things like language.
p511
aVWhat we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals
p512
aVis that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths \u2014 who knows.
p513
aVBut that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language.

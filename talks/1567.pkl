VI want to talk to you today
p5
aVabout a difficult topic that is close to me,
p6
aVand closer than you might realize to you.
p7
aa(lp8
VI came to the UK 21 years ago, as an asylum-seeker.
p9
aVI was 21.
p10
aVI was forced to leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
p11
aVmy home, where I was a student activist.
p12
aVI would love my children to be able to meet my family in the Congo.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut I want to tell you what the Congo has got to do with you.
p15
aVBut first of all, I want you to do me a favor.
p16
aVCan you all please reach into your pockets and take out your mobile phone?
p17
aVFeel that familiar weight ...
p18
aVhow naturally your finger slides towards the buttons.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VCan you imagine your world without it?
p23
aVIt connects us to our loved ones,
p24
aVour family, friends and colleagues,
p25
aVat home and overseas.
p26
aVIt is a symbol of an interconnected world.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut what you hold in your hand leaves a bloody trail,
p29
aVand it all boils down to a mineral:
p30
aVtantalum, mined in the Congo as coltan.
p31
aVIt is an anticorrosive heat conductor.
p32
aVIt stores energy in our mobile phones, PlayStations and laptops.
p33
aVIt is used in aerospace and medical equipment as an alloy.
p34
aVIt is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts.
p35
aVIt would be great if the story ended there.
p36
aa(lp37
VUnfortunately, what you hold in your hand
p38
aVhas not only enabled incredible technological development
p39
aVand industrial expansion,
p40
aVbut it has also contributed to unimaginable human suffering.
p41
aa(lp42
VSince 1996,
p43
aVover five million people have died in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
p44
aVCountless women, men and children have been raped, tortured or enslaved.
p45
aVRape is used as a weapon of war,
p46
aVinstilling fear and depopulating whole areas.
p47
aVThe quest for extracting this mineral
p48
aVhas not only aided, but it has fueled
p49
aVthe ongoing war in the Congo.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut don't throw away your phones yet.
p52
aVThirty thousand children are enlisted
p53
aVand are made to fight in armed groups.
p54
aVThe Congo consistently scores dreadfully
p55
aVin global health and poverty rankings.
p56
aVBut remarkably,
p57
aVthe UN Environmental Programme has estimated the wealth of the country
p58
aVto be over 24 trillion dollars.
p59
aVThe state-regulated mining industry has collapsed,
p60
aVand control over mines has splintered.
p61
aVColtan is easily controlled by armed groups.
p62
aVOne well-known illicit trade route is that across the border to Rwanda,
p63
aVwhere Congolese tantalum is disguised as Rwandan.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut don't throw away your phones yet,
p66
aVbecause the incredible irony
p67
aVis that the technology that has placed such unsustainable,
p68
aVdevastating demands on the Congo
p69
aVis the same technology that has brought this situation to our attention.
p70
aVWe only know so much about the situation in the Congo and in the mines
p71
aVbecause of the kind of communication the mobile phone allows.
p72
aVAs with the Arab Spring,
p73
aVduring the recent elections in the Congo,
p74
aVvoters were able to send text messages of local polling stations
p75
aVto the headquarters in the capital, Kinshasa.
p76
aVAnd in the wake of the result,
p77
aVthe diaspora has joined with the Carter Center,
p78
aVthe Catholic Church and other observers,
p79
aVto draw attention to the undemocratic result.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe mobile phone has given people around the world
p82
aVan important tool towards gaining their political freedom.
p83
aVIt has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet.
p84
aVIt has allowed momentous political change to take place.
p85
aVSo, we are faced with a paradox.
p86
aVThe mobile phone is an instrument of freedom
p87
aVand an instrument of oppression.
p88
aa(lp89
VTED has always celebrated what technology can do for us,
p90
aVtechnology in its finished form.
p91
aVIt is time to be asking questions about technology.
p92
aVWhere does it come from?
p93
aVWho makes it?
p94
aVAnd for what?
p95
aVHere, I am speaking directly to you,
p96
aVthe TED community,
p97
aVand to all those who might be watching on a screen,
p98
aVon your phone, across the world,
p99
aVin the Congo.
p100
aVAll the technology is in place for us to communicate,
p101
aVand all the technology is in place to communicate this.
p102
aa(lp103
VAt the moment,
p104
aVthere is no clear fair-trade solution.
p105
aVBut there has been a huge amount of progress.
p106
aVThe US has recently passed legislation
p107
aVto target bribery and misconduct in the Congo.
p108
aVRecent UK legislation could be used in the same way.
p109
aVIn February, Nokia unveiled its new policy on sourcing minerals in the Congo,
p110
aVand there is a petition to Apple to make a conflict-free iPhone.
p111
aVThere are campaigns spreading across university campuses
p112
aVto make their colleges conflict-free.
p113
aVBut we're not there yet.
p114
aVWe need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies
p115
aVto change their sourcing processes.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhen I first came to the UK, 21 years ago,
p118
aVI was homesick.
p119
aVI missed my family and the friends I left behind.
p120
aVCommunication was extremely difficult.
p121
aVSending and receiving letters took months \u2014
p122
aVif you were lucky.
p123
aVOften, they never arrived.
p124
aVEven if I could have afforded the phone bills home,
p125
aVlike most people in the Congo,
p126
aVmy parents did not own a phone line.
p127
aa(lp128
VToday, my two sons \u2014
p129
aVDavid and Daniel,
p130
aVcan talk to my parents and get to know them.
p131
aVWhy should we allow
p132
aVsuch a wonderful, brilliant and necessary product
p133
aVto be the cause of unnecessary suffering
p134
aVfor human beings?
p135
aa(lp136
VWe demand fair-trade food and fair-trade clothes.
p137
aVIt is time to demand fair-trade phones.
p138
aVThis is an idea worth spreading.
p139
aa(lp140
VThank you.

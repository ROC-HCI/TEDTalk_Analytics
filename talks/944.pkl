VMartin Luther King
p5
aVdid not say,
p6
aV"I have a nightmare,"
p7
aVwhen he inspired the civil rights movements.
p8
aVHe said, "I have a dream."
p9
aVAnd I have a dream.
p10
aVI have a dream that we can stop thinking
p11
aVthat the future will be a nightmare,
p12
aVand this is going to be a challenge,
p13
aVbecause, if you think
p14
aVof every major blockbusting film of recent times,
p15
aVnearly all of its visions for humanity
p16
aVare apocalyptic.
p17
aVI think this film
p18
aVis one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."
p19
aVIt's a beautiful piece of filmmaking,
p20
aVbut everything is desolate,
p21
aVeverything is dead.
p22
aVAnd just a father and son
p23
aVtrying to survive, walking along the road.
p24
aVAnd I think the environmental movement
p25
aVof which I am a part of
p26
aVhas been complicit
p27
aVin creating this vision of the future.
p28
aa(lp29
VFor too long,
p30
aVwe have peddled a nightmarish vision
p31
aVof what's going to happen.
p32
aVWe have focused on the worst-case scenario.
p33
aVWe have focused on the problems.
p34
aVAnd we have not thought enough
p35
aVabout the solutions.
p36
aVWe've used fear, if you like,
p37
aVto grab people's attention.
p38
aVAnd any psychologist will tell you
p39
aVthat fear in the organism
p40
aVis linked to flight mechanism.
p41
aVIt's part of the fight and flight mechanism,
p42
aVthat when an animal is frightened \u2014
p43
aVthink of a deer.
p44
aVA deer freezes very, very still,
p45
aVpoised to run away.
p46
aVAnd I think that's what we're doing
p47
aVwhen we're asking people to engage with our agenda
p48
aVaround environmental degradation and climate change.
p49
aVPeople are freezing and running away
p50
aVbecause we're using fear.
p51
aVAnd I think the environmental movement has to grow up
p52
aVand start to think about
p53
aVwhat progress is.
p54
aa(lp55
VWhat would it be like to be improving the human lot?
p56
aVAnd one of the problems that we face, I think,
p57
aVis that the only people that have cornered the market
p58
aVin terms of progress
p59
aVis a financial definition of what progress is,
p60
aVan economic definition of what progress is \u2014
p61
aVthat somehow,
p62
aVif we get the right numbers to go up,
p63
aVwe're going to be better off,
p64
aVwhether that's on the stock market,
p65
aVwhether that's with GDP
p66
aVand economic growth,
p67
aVthat somehow life is going to get better.
p68
aVThis is somehow appealing to human greed
p69
aVinstead of fear \u2014
p70
aVthat more is better.
p71
aVCome on. In the Western world, we have enough.
p72
aVMaybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.
p73
aVAnd we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure
p74
aVof the welfare of nations.
p75
aVIn fact, the architect of our national accounting system,
p76
aVSimon Kuznets, in the 1930s,
p77
aVsaid that, "A nation's welfare
p78
aVcan scarcely be inferred from their national income."
p79
aVBut we've created a national accounting system
p80
aVwhich is firmly based on production
p81
aVand producing stuff.
p82
aVAnd indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.
p83
aVIn the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.
p84
aVAnd indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff
p85
aVthat we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.
p86
aVAnd so our national accounting system
p87
aVbecame fixated on what we can produce.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut as early as 1968,
p90
aVthis visionary man, Robert Kennedy,
p91
aVat the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign,
p92
aVgave the most eloquent deconstruction
p93
aVof gross national product
p94
aVthat ever has been.
p95
aVAnd he finished his talk with the phrase,
p96
aVthat, "The gross national product
p97
aVmeasures everything except that
p98
aVwhich makes life worthwhile."
p99
aVHow crazy is that? That our measure of progress,
p100
aVour dominant measure of progress in society,
p101
aVis measuring everything
p102
aVexcept that which makes life worthwhile?
p103
aVI believe, if Kennedy was alive today,
p104
aVhe would be asking statisticians such as myself
p105
aVto go out and find out
p106
aVwhat makes life worthwhile.
p107
aVHe'd be asking us to redesign
p108
aVour national accounting system
p109
aVto be based upon
p110
aVsuch important things as social justice,
p111
aVsustainability
p112
aVand people's well-being.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd actually, social scientists have already gone out
p115
aVand asked these questions around the world.
p116
aVThis is from a global survey.
p117
aVIt's asking people, what do they want.
p118
aVAnd unsurprisingly, people all around the world
p119
aVsay that what they want
p120
aVis happiness, for themselves,
p121
aVfor their families, their children,
p122
aVtheir communities.
p123
aVOkay, they think money is slightly important.
p124
aVIt's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness,
p125
aVand it's not nearly as important as love.
p126
aVWe all need to love and be loved in life.
p127
aVIt's not nearly as important as health.
p128
aVWe want to be healthy and live a full life.
p129
aVThese seem to be natural human aspirations.
p130
aVWhy are statisticians not measuring these?
p131
aVWhy are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms,
p132
aVinstead of just how much stuff we have?
p133
aVAnd really, this is what I've done with my adult life \u2014
p134
aVis think about how do we measure happiness,
p135
aVhow do we measure well-being,
p136
aVhow can we do that within environmental limits.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd we created, at the organization that I work for,
p139
aVthe New Economics Foundation,
p140
aVsomething we call the Happy Planet Index,
p141
aVbecause we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.
p142
aVWhy don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?
p143
aVAnd what we do,
p144
aVis we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation
p145
aVis how successful is it
p146
aVat creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
p147
aVThat should be the goal
p148
aVof every nation on the planet.
p149
aVBut we have to remember
p150
aVthat there's a fundamental input to that,
p151
aVand that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
p152
aVWe all have one planet. We all have to share it.
p153
aVIt is the ultimate scarce resource,
p154
aVthe one planet that we share.
p155
aVAnd economics is very interested in scarcity.
p156
aVWhen it has a scarce resource
p157
aVthat it wants to turn into
p158
aVa desirable outcome,
p159
aVit thinks in terms of efficiency.
p160
aVIt thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.
p161
aVAnd this is a measure of how much well-being
p162
aVwe get for our planetary resource use.
p163
aVIt is an efficiency measure.
p164
aVAnd probably the easiest way to show you that,
p165
aVis to show you this graph.
p166
aa(lp167
VRunning horizontally along the graph,
p168
aVis "ecological footprint,"
p169
aVwhich is a measure of how much resources we use
p170
aVand how much pressure we put on the planet.
p171
aVMore is bad.
p172
aVRunning vertically upwards,
p173
aVis a measure called "happy life years."
p174
aVIt's about the well-being of nations.
p175
aVIt's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.
p176
aVIt's like quality and quantity of life in nations.
p177
aVAnd the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.
p178
aVNow, there's a huge array of nations
p179
aVaround that global average.
p180
aVTo the top right of the graph,
p181
aVare countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being,
p182
aVbut they're using a lot of planet to get there.
p183
aVThey are the U.S.A.,
p184
aVother Western countries going across in those triangles
p185
aVand a few Gulf states in there actually.
p186
aVConversely, at the bottom left of the graph,
p187
aVare countries that are not producing much well-being \u2014
p188
aVtypically, sub-Saharan Africa.
p189
aVIn Hobbesian terms,
p190
aVlife is short and brutish there.
p191
aVThe average life expectancy in many of these countries
p192
aVis only 40 years.
p193
aVMalaria, HIV/AIDS
p194
aVare killing a lot of people
p195
aVin these regions of the world.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut now for the good news!
p198
aVThere are some countries up there, yellow triangles,
p199
aVthat are doing better than global average,
p200
aVthat are heading up towards the top left of the graph.
p201
aVThis is an aspirational graph.
p202
aVWe want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.
p203
aVThey're Latin American.
p204
aVThe country on its own up at the top
p205
aVis a place I haven't been to.
p206
aVMaybe some of you have.
p207
aVCosta Rica.
p208
aVCosta Rica \u2014
p209
aVaverage life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.
p210
aVThat is longer than in the USA.
p211
aVThey are, according to the latest Gallup world poll,
p212
aVthe happiest nation on the planet \u2014
p213
aVthan anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.
p214
aVThey are the happiest place.
p215
aVThey are doing that
p216
aVon a quarter of the resources
p217
aVthat are used typically in [the] Western world \u2014
p218
aVa quarter of the resources.
p219
aa(lp220
VWhat's going on there?
p221
aVWhat's happening in Costa Rica?
p222
aVWe can look at some of the data.
p223
aV99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.
p224
aVTheir government is one of the first to commit
p225
aVto be carbon neutral by 2021.
p226
aVThey abolished the army
p227
aVin 1949 \u2014
p228
aV1949.
p229
aVAnd they invested in social programs \u2014
p230
aVhealth and education.
p231
aVThey have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America
p232
aVand in the world.
p233
aVAnd they have that Latin vibe, don't they.
p234
aVThey have the social connectedness.
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVThe challenge is, that possibly \u2014 and the thing we might have to think about \u2014
p237
aVis that the future
p238
aVmight not be North American,
p239
aVmight not be Western European.
p240
aVIt might be Latin American.
p241
aVAnd the challenge, really,
p242
aVis to pull the global average up here.
p243
aVThat's what we need to do.
p244
aVAnd if we're going to do that,
p245
aVwe need to pull countries from the bottom,
p246
aVand we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.
p247
aVAnd then we're starting to create a happy planet.
p248
aVThat's one way of looking at it.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnother way of looking at it is looking at time trends.
p251
aVWe don't have good data going back for every country in the world,
p252
aVbut for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.
p253
aVAnd this is the trend in well-being over that time,
p254
aVa small increase,
p255
aVbut this is the trend in ecological footprint.
p256
aVAnd so in strict happy-planet methodology,
p257
aVwe've become less efficient
p258
aVat turning our ultimate scarce resource
p259
aVinto the outcome we want to.
p260
aVAnd the point really is, is that I think,
p261
aVprobably everybody in this room
p262
aVwould like society to get to 2050
p263
aVwithout an apocalyptic
p264
aVsomething happening.
p265
aVIt's actually not very long away.
p266
aVIt's half a human lifetime away.
p267
aVA child entering school today
p268
aVwill be my age in 2050.
p269
aVThis is not the very distant future.
p270
aVThis is what the U.K. government target
p271
aVon carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.
p272
aVAnd I put it to you, that is not business as usual.
p273
aVThat is changing our business.
p274
aVThat is changing the way we create our organizations,
p275
aVwe do our government policy and we live our lives.
p276
aVAnd the point is,
p277
aVwe need to carry on increasing well-being.
p278
aVNo one can go to the polls
p279
aVand say that quality of life is going to reduce.
p280
aVNone of us, I think,
p281
aVwant human progress to stop.
p282
aVI think we want it to carry on.
p283
aVI think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.
p284
aVAnd I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.
p285
aVI think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.
p286
aVThey want to hold on to what they've got.
p287
aVAnd if we're going to engage them,
p288
aVI think that's what we've got to do.
p289
aVAnd that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that,
p292
aVbut the point is we need to turn those curves.
p293
aVAnd this is where I think we can take a leaf
p294
aVout of systems theory, systems engineers,
p295
aVwhere they create feedback loops,
p296
aVput the right information at the right point of time.
p297
aVHuman beings are very motivated by the "now."
p298
aVYou put a smart meter in your home,
p299
aVand you see how much electricity you're using right now,
p300
aVhow much it's costing you,
p301
aVyour kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.
p302
aVWhat would that look like for society?
p303
aVWhy is it, on the radio news every evening,
p304
aVI hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio \u2014
p305
aVI don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.
p306
aVAnd why do I hear that?
p307
aVWhy don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday,
p308
aVor American used yesterday?
p309
aVDid we meet our three percent annual target
p310
aVon reducing carbon emissions?
p311
aVThat's how you create a collective goal.
p312
aVYou put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.
p313
aVAnd we need positive feedback loops
p314
aVfor increasing well-being
p315
aVAt a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.
p316
aVAt a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees,
p317
aVwhich we know is really linked to creativity,
p318
aVwhich is linked to innovation,
p319
aVand we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
p320
aVAt a personal level, we need these nudges too.
p321
aVMaybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.
p322
aVIn the U.K., we have a strong public health message
p323
aVon five fruit and vegetables a day
p324
aVand how much exercise we should do \u2014 never my best thing.
p325
aVWhat are these for happiness?
p326
aVWhat are the five things that you should do every day
p327
aVto be happier?
p328
aa(lp329
VWe did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago,
p330
aVa big program called the Foresight program \u2014
p331
aVlots and lots of people \u2014 involved lots of experts \u2014
p332
aVeverything evidence based \u2014 a huge tome.
p333
aVBut a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do
p334
aVto improve well-being in your life?
p335
aVAnd the point of these is
p336
aVthey are, not quite, the secrets of happiness,
p337
aVbut they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd the first of these is to connect,
p340
aVis that your social relationships
p341
aVare the most important cornerstones of your life.
p342
aVDo you invest the time with your loved ones
p343
aVthat you could do, and energy?
p344
aVKeep building them.
p345
aVThe second one is be active.
p346
aVThe fastest way out of a bad mood:
p347
aVstep outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.
p348
aVBeing active is great for our positive mood.
p349
aVThe third one is take notice.
p350
aVHow aware are you of things going on around the world,
p351
aVthe seasons changing, people around you?
p352
aVDo you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?
p353
aVBased on a lot of evidence for mindfulness,
p354
aVcognitive behavioral therapy,
p355
aV[very] strong for our well being.
p356
aVThe fourth is keep learning
p357
aVand keep is important \u2014
p358
aVlearning throughout the whole life course.
p359
aVOlder people who keep learning and are curious,
p360
aVthey have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
p361
aVBut it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.
p362
aVIt's more curiosity.
p363
aVIt can be learning to cook a new dish,
p364
aVpicking up an instrument you forgot as a child.
p365
aVKeep learning.
p366
aVAnd the final one
p367
aVis that most anti-economic of activities,
p368
aVbut give.
p369
aVOur generosity, our altruism,
p370
aVour compassion,
p371
aVare all hardwired
p372
aVto the reward mechanism in our brain.
p373
aVWe feel good if we give.
p374
aVYou can do an experiment where you give
p375
aVtwo groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.
p376
aVYou tell one of them to spend it on themselves
p377
aVand one on other people.
p378
aVYou measure their happiness at the end of the day,
p379
aVthose that have gone and spent on other people are much happier
p380
aVthat those that spent it on themselves.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd these five ways,
p383
aVwhich we put onto these handy postcards,
p384
aVI would say, don't have to cost the earth.
p385
aVThey don't have any carbon content.
p386
aVThey don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.
p387
aVAnd so I think it's really quite feasible
p388
aVthat happiness does not cost the earth.
p389
aVNow, Martin Luther King,
p390
aVon the eve of his death,
p391
aVgave an incredible speech.
p392
aVHe said, "I know there are challenges ahead,
p393
aVthere may be trouble ahead,
p394
aVbut I fear no one. I don't care.
p395
aVI have been to the mountain top,
p396
aVand I have seen the Promised Land."
p397
aVNow, he was a preacher,
p398
aVbut I believe the environmental movement
p399
aVand, in fact, the business community, government,
p400
aVneeds to go to the top of the mountain top,
p401
aVand it needs to look out,
p402
aVand it needs to see the Promised Land,
p403
aVor the land of promise,
p404
aVand it needs to have a vision
p405
aVof a world that we all want.
p406
aVAnd not only that, we need to create a Great Transition
p407
aVto get there,
p408
aVand we need to pave that great transition with good things.
p409
aa(lp410
VHuman beings want to be happy.
p411
aVPave them with the five ways.
p412
aVAnd we need to have signposts
p413
aVgathering people together and pointing them \u2014
p414
aVsomething like the Happy Planet Index.
p415
aVAnd then I believe
p416
aVthat we can all create a world we all want,
p417
aVwhere happiness does not cost the earth.

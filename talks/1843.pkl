VSo I'm a city planner, an urban designer,
p5
aVformer arts advocate,
p6
aVtrained in architecture and art history,
p7
aVand I want to talk to you today not about design
p8
aVbut about America
p9
aVand how America can be more economically resilient,
p10
aVhow America can be healthier,
p11
aVand how America can be
p12
aVmore environmentally sustainable.
p13
aVAnd I realize this is a global forum,
p14
aVbut I think I need to talk about America
p15
aVbecause there is a history,
p16
aVin some places, not all,
p17
aVof American ideas being appropriated,
p18
aVbeing emulated, for better or for worse,
p19
aVaround the world.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd the worst idea we've ever had
p22
aVis suburban sprawl.
p23
aVIt's being emulated in many places as we speak.
p24
aVBy suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization
p25
aVof the landscape and the creation of the landscape
p26
aVaround the requirement of automobile use,
p27
aVand that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom
p28
aVhas become a gas-belching,
p29
aVtime-wasting and life-threatening
p30
aVprosthetic device
p31
aVthat many of us need just to,
p32
aVmost Americans, in fact, need,
p33
aVjust to live their daily lives.
p34
aVAnd there's an alternative.
p35
aVYou know, we say, half the world is living in cities.
p36
aVWell, in America, that living in cities,
p37
aVfor many of them, they're living in cities still
p38
aVwhere they're dependent on that automobile.
p39
aVAnd what I work for, and to do,
p40
aVis to make our cities more walkable.
p41
aVBut I can't give design arguments for that
p42
aVthat will have as much impact
p43
aVas the arguments that I've learned
p44
aVfrom the economists, the epidemiologists
p45
aVand the environmentalists.
p46
aVSo these are the three arguments that I'm going
p47
aVto give you quickly today.
p48
aa(lp49
VWhen I was growing up in the '70s,
p50
aVthe typical American spent one tenth of their income,
p51
aVAmerican family, on transportation.
p52
aVSince then, we've doubled the number of roads
p53
aVin America, and we now spend one fifth
p54
aVof our income on transportation.
p55
aVWorking families, which are defined as
p56
aVearning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars
p57
aVa year in America
p58
aVare spending more now on transportation
p59
aVthan on housing, slightly more,
p60
aVbecause of this phenomenon called "drive till you qualify,"
p61
aVfinding homes further and further and further
p62
aVfrom the city centers and from their jobs,
p63
aVso that they're locked in this, two, three hours,
p64
aVfour hours a day of commuting.
p65
aVAnd these are the neighborhoods, for example,
p66
aVin the Central Valley of California
p67
aVthat weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst
p68
aVand when the price of gas went up;
p69
aVthey were decimated.
p70
aVAnd in fact, these are many
p71
aVof the half-vacant communities that you see today.
p72
aVImagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,
p73
aVit goes underwater, and you have to pay
p74
aVtwice as much for all the driving that you're doing.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo we know what it's done to our society
p77
aVand all the extra work we have to do
p78
aVto support our cars.
p79
aVWhat happens when a city decides
p80
aVit's going to set other priorities?
p81
aVAnd probably the best example we have here
p82
aVin America is Portland, Oregon.
p83
aVPortland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s
p84
aVthat began to distinguish it
p85
aVfrom almost every other American city.
p86
aVWhile most other cities were growing
p87
aVan undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,
p88
aVthey instituted an urban growth boundary.
p89
aVWhile most cities were reaming out their roads,
p90
aVremoving parallel parking and trees
p91
aVin order to flow more traffic,
p92
aVthey instituted a skinny streets program.
p93
aVAnd while most cities were investing in more roads
p94
aVand more highways, they actually invested
p95
aVin bicycling and in walking.
p96
aVAnd they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,
p97
aVwhich seems like a lot of money,
p98
aVbut it was spent over about 30 years,
p99
aVso two million dollars a year \u2014 not that much \u2014
p100
aVand half the price of the one cloverleaf
p101
aVthat they decided to rebuild in that city.
p102
aVThese changes and others like them changed
p103
aVthe way that Portlanders live,
p104
aVand their vehicle-miles traveled per day,
p105
aVthe amount that each person drives,
p106
aVactually peaked in 1996,
p107
aVhas been dropping ever since,
p108
aVand they now drive 20 percent less
p109
aVthan the rest of the country.
p110
aVThe typical Portland citizen drives
p111
aVfour miles less, and 11 minutes less per day
p112
aVthan they did before.
p113
aVThe economist Joe Cortright did the math
p114
aVand he found out that those four miles
p115
aVplus those 11 minutes
p116
aVadds up to fully three and a half percent
p117
aVof all income earned in the region.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo if they're not spending that money on driving \u2014
p120
aVand by the way, 85 percent of the money
p121
aVwe spend on driving leaves the local economy \u2014
p122
aVif they're not spending that money on driving,
p123
aVwhat are they spending it on?
p124
aVWell, Portland is reputed to have
p125
aVthe most roof racks per capita,
p126
aVthe most independent bookstores per capita,
p127
aVthe most strip clubs per capita.
p128
aVThese are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations
p129
aVof a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders
p130
aVspend a lot more on recreation of all kinds
p131
aVthan the rest of America.
p132
aVActually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol
p133
aVthan most other states,
p134
aVwhich may be a good thing or a bad thing,
p135
aVbut it makes you glad they're driving less.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VBut actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,
p140
aVand home investment is about as local
p141
aVan investment as you can get.
p142
aVBut there's a whole other Portland story,
p143
aVwhich isn't part of this calculus,
p144
aVwhich is that young, educated people
p145
aVhave been moving to Portland in droves,
p146
aVso that between the last two censuses,
p147
aVthey had a 50-percent increase
p148
aVin college-educated millennials,
p149
aVwhich is five times what you saw anywhere else
p150
aVin the country, or, I should say, of the national average.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents
p153
aVby being more walkable and more bikeable,
p154
aVbut on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city
p155
aVthat people want to be in these days.
p156
aVSo the best economic strategy
p157
aVyou can have as a city
p158
aVis not the old way of trying to attract corporations
p159
aVand trying to have a biotech cluster
p160
aVor a medical cluster,
p161
aVor an aerospace cluster,
p162
aVbut to become a place where people want to be.
p163
aVAnd millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,
p164
aV64 percent of whom decide first
p165
aVwhere they want to live,
p166
aVthen they move there, then they look for a job,
p167
aVthey will come to your city.
p168
aa(lp169
VThe health argument is a scary one,
p170
aVand you've probably heard part of this argument before.
p171
aVAgain, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,
p172
aVback in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.
p173
aVNow one out of three Americans is obese,
p174
aVand a second third of the population is overweight.
p175
aVTwenty-five percent of young men
p176
aVand 40 percent of young women are too heavy
p177
aVto enlist in our own military forces.
p178
aVAccording to the Center for Disease Control,
p179
aVfully one third of all children born after 2000
p180
aVwill get diabetes.
p181
aVWe have the first generation of children in America
p182
aVwho are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.
p183
aa(lp184
VI believe that this American healthcare crisis
p185
aVthat we've all heard about
p186
aVis an urban design crisis,
p187
aVand that the design of our cities lies at the cure.
p188
aVBecause we've talked a long time about diet,
p189
aVand we know that diet impacts weight,
p190
aVand weight of course impacts health.
p191
aVBut we've only started talking about inactivity,
p192
aVand how inactivity born of our landscape,
p193
aVinactivity that comes from the fact that we live
p194
aVin a place where there is no longer any such thing
p195
aVas a useful walk, is driving our weight up.
p196
aVAnd we finally have the studies,
p197
aVone in Britain called "Gluttony versus sloth"
p198
aVthat tracked weight against diet
p199
aVand tracked weight against inactivity,
p200
aVand found a much higher, stronger correlation
p201
aVbetween the latter two.
p202
aVDr. James Levine at, in this case,
p203
aVthe aptly-named Mayo Clinic
p204
aVput his test subjects in electronic underwear,
p205
aVheld their diet steady,
p206
aVand then started pumping the calories in.
p207
aVSome people gained weight,
p208
aVsome people didn't gain weight.
p209
aVExpecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,
p210
aVthey were shocked to learn that the only difference
p211
aVbetween the subjects that they could figure out
p212
aVwas the amount they were moving,
p213
aVand that in fact those who gained weight
p214
aVwere sitting, on average, two hours more per day
p215
aVthan those who didn't.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo we have these studies that tie
p218
aVweight to inactivity, but even more,
p219
aVwe now have studies that tie weight to where you live.
p220
aVDo you live in a more walkable city
p221
aVor do you live in a less walkable city,
p222
aVor where in your city do you live?
p223
aVIn San Diego, they used Walk Score \u2014
p224
aVWalk Score rates every address in America
p225
aVand soon the world
p226
aVin terms of how walkable it is \u2014
p227
aVthey used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods
p228
aVand less walkable neighborhoods.
p229
aVWell guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,
p230
aVyou were 35 percent likely to be overweight.
p231
aVIf you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,
p232
aVyou were 60 percent likely to be overweight.
p233
aVSo we have study after study now
p234
aVthat's tying where you live
p235
aVto your health, particularly as in America,
p236
aVthe biggest health crisis we have is this one
p237
aVthat's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.
p238
aVAnd I learned a new word last week.
p239
aVThey call these neighborhoods "obesageneric."
p240
aVI may have that wrong, but you get the idea.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow that's one thing, of course.
p243
aVBriefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic
p244
aVin this country.
p245
aVYou probably haven't thought that much about it.
p246
aVFourteen Americans die each day from asthma,
p247
aVthree times what it was in the '90s,
p248
aVand it's almost all coming from car exhaust.
p249
aVAmerican pollution does not come
p250
aVfrom factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,
p251
aVand the amount that people are driving in your city,
p252
aVyour urban VMT, is a good prediction
p253
aVof the asthma problems in your city.
p254
aa(lp255
VAnd then finally, in terms of driving,
p256
aVthere's the issue of the single-largest killer
p257
aVof healthy adults, and one of the largest killers
p258
aVof all people, is car crashes.
p259
aVAnd we take car crashes for granted.
p260
aVWe figure it's a natural risk
p261
aVof being on the road.
p262
aVBut in fact, here in America, 12 people
p263
aVout of every 100,000
p264
aVdie every year from car crashes.
p265
aVWe're pretty safe here.
p266
aVWell, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.
p267
aVIt's Japan, it's four per 100,000.
p268
aVDo you know where it's three per 100,000?
p269
aVNew York City.
p270
aVSan Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.
p271
aVOh, so cities make us safer
p272
aVbecause we're driving less?
p273
aVTulsa: 14 per 100,000.
p274
aVOrlando: 20 per 100,000.
p275
aVIt's not whether you're in the city or not,
p276
aVit's how is your city designed?
p277
aVWas it designed around cars or around people?
p278
aVBecause if your city is designed around cars,
p279
aVit's really good at smashing them into each other.
p280
aa(lp281
VThat's part of a much larger health argument.
p282
aa(lp283
VFinally, the environmental argument is fascinating,
p284
aVbecause the environmentalists turned on a dime
p285
aVabout 10 years ago.
p286
aVThe environmental movement in America
p287
aVhas historically been an anti-city movement
p288
aVfrom Jefferson on.
p289
aa(lp290
V"Cities are pestilential to the health,
p291
aVto the liberties, to the morals of man.
p292
aVIf we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,
p293
aVas they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt
p294
aVas they are in Europe
p295
aVand take to eating one another as they do there."
p296
aa(lp297
VHe apparently had a sense of humor.
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd then the American environmental movement
p300
aVhas been a classically Arcadian movement.
p301
aVTo become more environmental, we move into the country,
p302
aVwe commune with nature, we build suburbs.
p303
aVBut, of course, we've seen what that does.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe carbon mapping of America,
p306
aVwhere is the CO2 being emitted,
p307
aVfor many years only
p308
aVhammered this argument in more strongly.
p309
aVIf you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,
p310
aVany carbon map of the U.S.,
p311
aVit looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,
p312
aVhottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,
p313
aVdark, peaceful in the countryside.
p314
aVUntil some economists said, you know,
p315
aVis that the right way to measure CO2?
p316
aVThere are only so many people in this country at any given time,
p317
aVand we can choose to live where perhaps
p318
aVwe would have a lighter impact.
p319
aVAnd they said, let's measure CO2 per household,
p320
aVand when they did that, the maps just flipped,
p321
aVcoolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,
p322
aVand red hot in these exurban
p323
aV"drive till you qualify" neighborhoods.
p324
aVSo a fundamental shift, and now you have
p325
aVenvironmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser
p326
aVsaying we are a destructive species.
p327
aVIf you love nature, the best thing you can do
p328
aVis stay the heck away from it,
p329
aVmove to a city, and the denser the better,
p330
aVand the denser cities like Manhattan
p331
aVare the cities that perform the best.
p332
aVSo the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline
p333
aVat the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,
p334
aVconsuming half of the electricity of Dallas.
p335
aVBut of course, we can do better.
p336
aVCanadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.
p337
aVEuropean cities consume half as much again.
p338
aVSo obviously, we can do better,
p339
aVand we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.
p340
aa(lp341
VMy final argument in this topic is that
p342
aVI think we're trying to be green the wrong way,
p343
aVand I'm one of many people who believes that
p344
aVthis focus on gadgets,
p345
aVon accessorizing \u2014
p346
aVWhat can I add to my house,
p347
aVwhat can I add to what I've already got
p348
aVto make my lifestyle more sustainable? \u2014
p349
aVhas kind of dominated the discussion.
p350
aVSo I'm not immune to this.
p351
aVMy wife and I built a new house
p352
aVon an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,
p353
aVand we did our best to clear the shelves
p354
aVof the sustainability store.
p355
aVWe've got the solar photovoltaic system,
p356
aVsolar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,
p357
aVbamboo floors.
p358
aVA log burning in my German high-tech stove
p359
aVapparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon
p360
aVto the atmosphere than were it left alone
p361
aVto decompose in the forest.
p362
aVYet all of these innovations \u2014
p363
aVThat's what they said in the brochure.
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aVAll of these innovations together
p366
aVcontribute a fraction of what we contribute
p367
aVby living in a walkable neighborhood
p368
aVthree blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.
p369
aVWe've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,
p370
aVand you should do the same thing,
p371
aVbut changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers
p372
aVsaves as much energy in a year
p373
aVas moving to a walkable city does in a week.
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd we don't want to have this argument.
p376
aVPoliticians and marketers are afraid
p377
aVof marketing green as a "lifestyle choice."
p378
aVYou don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,
p379
aVthat they have to change their lifestyle.
p380
aVBut what if lifestyle was really about quality of life
p381
aVand about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,
p382
aVsomething that would be better than what we have right now?
p383
aa(lp384
VWell, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,
p385
aVit's called the Mercer Survey.
p386
aVYou may have heard of it.
p387
aVThey rank hundreds of nations worldwide
p388
aVaccording to 10 criteria that they believe add up
p389
aVto quality of life: health, economics, education,
p390
aVhousing, you name it.
p391
aVThere's six more. Short talk.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd it's very interesting to see that
p396
aVthe highest-ranking American city, Honolulu,
p397
aVnumber 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects
p398
aVof Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities.
p399
aVThe driving cities in the Sun Belt,
p400
aVthe Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta,
p401
aVthese cities are not appearing on the list.
p402
aVBut who's doing even better?
p403
aVThe Canadian cities like Vancouver,
p404
aVwhere again, they're burning half the fuel.
p405
aVAnd then it's usually won by cities where they speak German,
p406
aVlike Dusseldorf or Vienna,
p407
aVwhere they're burning, again, half as much fuel.
p408
aVAnd you see this alignment, this strange alignment.
p409
aa(lp410
VIs being more sustainble
p411
aVwhat gives you a higher quality of life?
p412
aVI would argue the same thing
p413
aVthat makes you more sustainble
p414
aVis what gives you a higher quality of life,
p415
aVand that's living in a walkable neighborhood.
p416
aVSo sustainability, which includes our wealth
p417
aVand our health
p418
aVmay not be a direct function of our sustainability.
p419
aVBut particularly here in America,
p420
aVwe are polluting so much
p421
aVbecause we're throwing away our time
p422
aVand our money and our lives on the highway,
p423
aVthen these two problems would seem to share
p424
aVthe same solution, which is to make our cities
p425
aVmore walkable.
p426
aa(lp427
VDoing so isn't easy, but it can be done,
p428
aVit has been done,
p429
aVand it's being done now in more than a few cities,
p430
aVaround the globe and in our country.
p431
aVI take some solace from Winston Churchill,
p432
aVwho put it this way:
p433
aV"The Americans can be counted on
p434
aVto do the right thing
p435
aVonce they have exhausted the alternatives." (Laughter)
p436
aa(lp437
VThank you.

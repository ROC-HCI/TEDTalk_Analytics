VI want to argue to you that in fact, politics and religion,
p5
aVwhich are the two primary factors \u2014
p6
aVnot the sole, but overwhelmingly, the primary factors \u2014
p7
aVwhich are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely \u2014
p8
aVbordering on the inevitable at this point,
p9
aVwhether one is in favor of that or not \u2014
p10
aVthat politics and religion are, in fact, themselves
p11
aVbetter conceptualized as kinds of technology,
p12
aVand subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider
p13
aVin the space of conceptual design.
p14
aa(lp15
VHere's what I mean. Politics and \u2014
p16
aVlet's focus on the political system in particular question here,
p17
aVwhich is the system of democracy.
p18
aVDemocracy, as a type of politics, is a technology
p19
aVfor the control and deployment of power.
p20
aVYou can deploy power in a wide range of ways.
p21
aVThe famous ones \u2014 despotism is a good one;
p22
aVanarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way,
p23
aVto do it in a radically diffused fashion;
p24
aVand democracy is a set of technologies,
p25
aVwhich have the effect of, in principle,
p26
aVdiffusing the power source to a large number of people
p27
aVand then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern,
p28
aVand who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern
p29
aVby virtue of what the broader public has done.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, consider religion \u2014 in this case Islam,
p32
aVwhich is the religion that, in some direct sense,
p33
aVcan be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter.
p34
aVLet me say parenthetically why I think that's the case,
p35
aVbecause I think it's a potentially controversial statement.
p36
aVI would put it in the following equation: no 9/11, no war.
p37
aVAt the beginning of the Bush administration,
p38
aVwhen President Bush, now President Bush, was running for president,
p39
aVhe made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world.
p40
aVIn fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world.
p41
aVThat's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example.
p42
aVAfter 9/11, the tables were turned.
p43
aVAnd the president decided, with his advisors,
p44
aVto undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us.
p45
aVThat began with Afghanistan,
p46
aVand when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly,
p47
aVa decision was made through the technology of democracy \u2014
p48
aVagain, notice, not a perfect technology \u2014
p49
aVbut through the technology of democracy
p50
aVthat this administration was going to push in the direction of another war \u2014
p51
aVthis time, a war in Iraq.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, the reason I begin by saying "no 9/11, no war"
p54
aVis that we have to acknowledge that Islam,
p55
aVas interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people,
p56
aVwas a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks \u2014
p57
aVthe precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks \u2014
p58
aVand as a consequence, at one degree of remove,
p59
aVthe precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in.
p60
aVAnd I would add that bin Laden and his followers
p61
aVare consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy,
p62
aVor at least capitalist democracy, on the one hand,
p63
aVand the world of Islam as they see and define it.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus?
p66
aVWell, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense.
p67
aVIt's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe
p68
aVin a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer,
p69
aVbut it's also meant by the Islamists \u2014
p70
aVand I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam \u2014
p71
aVthey follow the slogan, Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions,
p72
aVwhether they're social, or political, or personal, or spiritual.
p73
aVWithin the sphere of people who have that view,
p74
aVand it's a large number of people in the Muslim world
p75
aVwho disagree with bin Laden in his application,
p76
aVbut agree that Islam is the answer.
p77
aVIslam represents a way of engaging the world
p78
aVthrough which one can achieve certain desirable goals.
p79
aVAnd the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle,
p80
aVpeace, justice and equality,
p81
aVbut on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, I don't want to leave a misimpression
p84
aVby identifying either of these propositions \u2014
p85
aVrather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam \u2014 as technologies.
p86
aVI don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to.
p87
aVAnd I think a good way to prove this
p88
aVis simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was
p89
aVwhen deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke.
p90
aVAnd I ran immediately into a conceptual problem:
p91
aVyou can't show a picture of democracy.
p92
aVYou can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.
p93
aVYou can show the Capitol \u2014
p94
aVI had the same problem when I was designing the cover
p95
aVof my forthcoming book, in fact \u2014
p96
aVwhat do you put on the cover to show democracy?
p97
aVAnd the same problem with respect to Islam.
p98
aVYou can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers,
p99
aVbut there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam.
p100
aVThat's because these are the kinds of concepts
p101
aVthat are not susceptible to easy representation.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, it follows from that, that they're deeply contestable.
p104
aVIt follows from that that all of the people in the world
p105
aVwho say that they are Muslims can, in principle,
p106
aVsubscribe to a wide range of different interpretations
p107
aVof what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy.
p108
aVIn other words, unlike the word hope,
p109
aVwhich one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for,
p110
aVand, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis,
p111
aVthese are essentially contested concepts.
p112
aVThey're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.
p113
aVAnd as a consequence of this disagreement,
p114
aVit's very, very difficult for anyone to say,
p115
aV"I have the right version of Islam."
p116
aVYou know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon
p117
aVof George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace."
p118
aVWell, so says George W. Bush.
p119
aVOther people would say it means something else.
p120
aVSome people would say that Islam means submission.
p121
aVOther people would say it means an acknowledgement
p122
aVor recognition of God's sovereignty.
p123
aVThere are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean.
p124
aVAnd ostensibly, the same is true of democracy.
p125
aVSome people say that democracy consists basically in elections.
p126
aVOther people say no, that's not enough,
p127
aVthere have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens.
p128
aVThese are contested points, and it's impossible to answer them by saying,
p129
aV"Ah ha, I looked in the right place, and I found out what these concepts mean."
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, if Islam and democracy are at present
p132
aVin a moment of great confrontation,
p133
aVwhat does that mean?
p134
aVWell, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks.
p135
aVYou could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago,
p136
aVwhich was fear.
p137
aVFear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner
p138
aVand with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die
p139
aVas a consequence of this confrontation \u2014
p140
aVa confrontation which many, many people
p141
aVin the Muslim world do not want,
p142
aVmany, many people in the American democracy do not want,
p143
aVmany people elsewhere in the world do not want,
p144
aVbut which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people \u2014
p145
aVat least in the relevant space, which is the United States \u2014
p146
aVto actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all.
p147
aVAnd I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response.
p148
aa(lp149
VWhat I want to suggest to you, though, in the next couple of minutes
p150
aVis that there's also a hopeful response to this.
p151
aVAnd the hopeful response derives from recognizing
p152
aVthat Islam and democracy are technologies.
p153
aVAnd by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable.
p154
aVAnd they're manipulable in ways
p155
aVthat can produce some extremely positive outcomes.
p156
aVWhat do I have in mind?
p157
aVWell, all over the Muslim world there are people
p158
aVwho take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam,
p159
aVfor whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values,
p160
aVor just a source of powerful personal identity,
p161
aVwho think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy
p162
aVare in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.
p163
aVAnd these Muslims \u2014 and it's the vast majority of Muslims \u2014
p164
aVdisagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly.
p165
aVAnd they furthermore think overwhelmingly \u2014
p166
aVagain one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly,
p167
aVand one can find this by reading any of the sources
p168
aVthat they have produced, and they're all over the Internet
p169
aVand in all sorts of languages \u2014 one can see that they're saying
p170
aVthat their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves
p171
aVto have choice in the spheres of personal life,
p172
aVin the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics,
p173
aVand, yes, in the sphere of religion,
p174
aVwhich is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd many of these Muslims further say
p177
aVthat their disagreement with the United States
p178
aVis that it, in the past and still in the present,
p179
aVhas sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world
p180
aVin order to promote America's short-term interests.
p181
aVNow, during the Cold War, that may have been
p182
aVa defensible position for the United States to take.
p183
aVThat's an academic question.
p184
aVIt may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East,
p185
aVand it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism.
p186
aVAnd it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other,
p187
aVand as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them.
p188
aVBut now that the Cold War is over,
p189
aVthere's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world \u2014
p190
aVand pretty close to the same here in the United States,
p191
aVif you talk to people and ask them \u2014
p192
aVthat in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist.
p193
aVAnd we see this among activist, practical Muslims,
p194
aVlike the Muslims who are presently the elected,
p195
aVparliamentary, democratic government of Turkey,
p196
aVwho are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically,
p197
aVwho are promoting their own religious values,
p198
aVwho are elected by their own people
p199
aVbecause they were perceived as honest and sincere
p200
aVbecause of their religious values,
p201
aVbut who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance
p202
aVare fundamentally incompatible.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam
p205
aVconvinces us that it can't possibly be compatible
p206
aVwith what we consider the core of democracy \u2014
p207
aVnamely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.
p208
aVBut I'm here to tell you that technologies
p209
aVare more malleable than that.
p210
aVI'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe \u2014
p211
aVthe vast majority, in fact \u2014 in fact I think I would go so far as to say
p212
aVthat many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam,
p213
aVnamely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty
p214
aVand basic human equality before God,
p215
aVare themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice.
p216
aVAnd there are Muslims, many Muslims out there, who are saying precisely this.
p217
aVAnd they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it.
p218
aVBut their governments, needless to say, are relatively threatened by this.
p219
aVAnd for the most part try to stop them from making this argument.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo, for example, a group of young activists in Egypt
p222
aVtry to form a party known as the Center Party,
p223
aVwhich advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy.
p224
aVThey weren't even allowed to form a party.
p225
aVThey were actually blocked from even forming a party
p226
aVunder the political system there. Why?
p227
aVBecause they would have done extraordinarily well.
p228
aVIn the most recent elections in the Muslim world \u2014
p229
aVwhich are those in Pakistan, those in Morocco
p230
aVand those in Turkey \u2014 in each case,
p231
aVpeople who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats
p232
aVwere far and away the most successful vote-getters
p233
aVevery place they were allowed to run freely.
p234
aVSo in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race
p235
aVbut they were only allowed to contest half the seats.
p236
aVSo had they contested a larger number of the seats,
p237
aVthey would have done even better.
p238
aVNow what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case
p239
aVis that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world.
p240
aVAnd that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims \u2014
p241
aVwho care very, very deeply about their traditions,
p242
aVwho do not want to compromise those values \u2014
p243
aVbelieve, through the malleability of the technology of democracy
p244
aVand the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam,
p245
aVthat these two ideas can work together.
p246
aa(lp247
VNow what would that look like?
p248
aVWhat does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy?
p249
aVWell, one thing is, it's not going to look identical
p250
aVto democracy as we know it in the United States.
p251
aVThat may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today \u2014
p252
aVfor example, in the regulatory context \u2014 of what democracy produces.
p253
aVIt will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room,
p254
aVor Muslims out in the rest of the world \u2014
p255
aVI don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are \u2014
p256
aVconceptualize Islam.
p257
aVIt will be transformative of Islam as well.
p258
aVAnd as a result of this convergence,
p259
aVthis synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together,
p260
aVthere's a real possibility that, instead of a clash
p261
aVof Islamic civilization \u2014 if there is such a thing \u2014
p262
aVand democratic civilization \u2014 if there is such a thing \u2014
p263
aVwe'll in fact have close compatibility.
p264
aa(lp265
VNow, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room,
p266
aVand you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war
p267
aVif you're talking about these issues.
p268
aVThe war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing
p269
aVbecause it's very possible that as a consequence of a war,
p270
aVmany Muslims will conclude that the United States
p271
aVis not the kind of place that they want to emulate
p272
aVwith respect to its forms of political government.
p273
aVOn the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans,
p274
aVswept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think
p275
aVthat Islam is the enemy somehow \u2014
p276
aVthat Islam ought to be construed as the enemy.
p277
aVAnd even though, for political tactical reasons,
p278
aVthe president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy,
p279
aVnonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war
p280
aVto think of the other side as an enemy.
p281
aVAnd one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible,
p282
aVin defining who that enemy is.
p283
aVSo the risks are very great.
p284
aa(lp285
VOn the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war
p286
aVare also not to be underestimated,
p287
aVeven by, and I would say especially by, people
p288
aVwho are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.
p289
aVThose who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens,
p290
aVit cannot be the right strategy,
p291
aVeither pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war,
p292
aV"Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out,
p293
aVbecause we opposed the war in the first place."
p294
aVThat's not the way human circumstances operate.
p295
aVYou face the circumstances you have in front of you
p296
aVand you go forward.
p297
aa(lp298
VWell, what I'm here to say then is,
p299
aVfor people who are skeptical about the war,
p300
aVit's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war
p301
aVthere is a possibility for the government of the United States
p302
aVand the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts
p303
aVto create real forms of government that are truly democratic
p304
aVand also truly Islamic.
p305
aVAnd it is crucial \u2014 it is crucial in a practical, activist way \u2014
p306
aVfor people who care about these issues to make sure
p307
aVthat within the technology of democracy, in this system,
p308
aVthey exercise their preferences, their choices and their voices
p309
aVto encourage that outcome.
p310
aVThat's a hopeful message,
p311
aVbut it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it
p312
aVas incurring serious obligation for all of us.
p313
aVAnd I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation,
p314
aVbut only if we put what we can into it.
p315
aVAnd if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether.
p316
aa(lp317
VThanks.

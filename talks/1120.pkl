VI am the daughter of a forger,
p5
aVnot just any forger ...
p6
aVWhen you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary."
p7
aVYou understand "forged currency," "forged pictures."
p8
aVMy father is no such man.
p9
aVFor 30 years of his life,
p10
aVhe made false papers \u2014
p11
aVnever for himself, always for other people,
p12
aVand to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.
p13
aVLet me introduce him.
p14
aVHere is my father at age 19.
p15
aVIt all began for him during World War II,
p16
aVwhen at age 17 he found himself thrust
p17
aVinto a forged documents workshop.
p18
aVHe quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.
p19
aVAnd it's not a banal story \u2014
p20
aVafter the liberation he continued
p21
aVto make false papers until the '70s.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhen I was a child
p24
aVI knew nothing about this, of course.
p25
aVThis is me in the middle making faces.
p26
aVI grew up in the Paris suburbs
p27
aVand I was the youngest of three children.
p28
aVI had a "normal" dad like everybody else,
p29
aVapart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...
p30
aVwell, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.
p31
aVAnyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,
p32
aVand he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.
p33
aVAnd, of course, he never talked about his past life
p34
aVwhen he was a forger.
p35
aa(lp36
VThere was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about,
p37
aVthat perhaps could have led me suspect something.
p38
aVI was in high school and got a bad grade,
p39
aVa rare event for me,
p40
aVso I decided to hide it from my parents.
p41
aVIn order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.
p42
aVI started working on my mother's signature,
p43
aVbecause my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.
p44
aVSo, I got working. I took some sheets of paper
p45
aVand started practicing, practicing, practicing,
p46
aVuntil I reached what I thought was a steady hand,
p47
aVand went into action.
p48
aVLater, while checking my school bag,
p49
aVmy mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.
p50
aVShe yelled at me like she never had before.
p51
aVI went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,
p52
aVand then I waited for my father to come back from work
p53
aVwith, one could say, much apprehension.
p54
aVI heard him come in.
p55
aVI remained under the blankets. He entered my room,
p56
aVsat on the corner of the bed,
p57
aVand he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,
p58
aVand when he saw me he started laughing.
p59
aVHe was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.
p60
aVThen he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"
p61
aVIndeed, it's rather small.
p62
aa(lp63
VI was born in Algeria.
p64
aVThere I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid"
p65
aVand that means "fighter."
p66
aVLater on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations,
p67
aVand I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life,
p68
aVespecially that he had "done" World War II,
p69
aVthat he had "done" the Algerian war.
p70
aVAnd in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.
p71
aVBut knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,
p72
aVI found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.
p73
aVAnd indeed, I was very far from the mark.
p74
aa(lp75
VOne day, while my father was working on a file
p76
aVfor us to obtain French nationality,
p77
aVI happened to see some documents
p78
aVthat caught my attention.
p79
aVThese are real!
p80
aVThese are mine, I was born an Argentinean.
p81
aVBut the document I happened to see
p82
aVthat would help us build a case for the authorities
p83
aVwas a document from the army
p84
aVthat thanked my father for his work
p85
aVon behalf of the secret services.
p86
aVAnd then, suddenly, I went "wow!"
p87
aVMy father, a secret agent?
p88
aVIt was very James Bond.
p89
aVI wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.
p90
aVAnd later, I told myself that
p91
aVone day I would have to question him.
p92
aVAnd then I became a mother and had a son,
p93
aVand finally decided it was time \u2014 that he absolutely had to talk to us.
p94
aVI had become a mother
p95
aVand he was celebrating his 77th birthday,
p96
aVand suddenly I was very, very afraid.
p97
aVI feared he'd go
p98
aVand take his silences with him,
p99
aVand take his secrets with him.
p100
aVI managed to convince him that it was important for us,
p101
aVbut possibly also for other people
p102
aVthat he shared his story.
p103
aVHe decided to tell it to me
p104
aVand I made a book,
p105
aVfrom which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo, his story. My father was born in Argentina.
p108
aVHis parents were of Russian descent.
p109
aVThe whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.
p110
aVHis parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.
p111
aVSo at the age of 14 my father had to work.
p112
aVAnd with his only diploma,
p113
aVhis primary education certificate,
p114
aVhe found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.
p115
aVThat's where he discovered something totally magical,
p116
aVand when he talks about it, it's fascinating \u2014
p117
aVit's the magic of dyeing chemistry.
p118
aVDuring that time the war was happening
p119
aVand his mother was killed when he was 15.
p120
aVThis coincided with the time when
p121
aVhe threw himself body and soul into chemistry
p122
aVbecause it was the only consolation for his sadness.
p123
aVAll day he would ask many questions to his boss
p124
aVto learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,
p125
aVand at night, when no one was looking,
p126
aVhe'd put his experience to practice.
p127
aVHe was mostly interested in ink bleaching.
p128
aa(lp129
VAll this to tell you
p130
aVthat if my father became a forger, actually,
p131
aVit was almost by accident.
p132
aVHis family was Jewish, so they were hounded.
p133
aVFinally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp
p134
aVand they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.
p135
aVWell, they were out,
p136
aVbut they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.
p137
aVIt was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.
p138
aVMy father had been instilled with such respect for the law
p139
aVthat although he was being persecuted,
p140
aVhe'd never thought of false papers.
p141
aVBut it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.
p142
aa(lp143
VIn those times documents had hard covers,
p144
aVthey were filled in by hand,
p145
aVand they stated your job.
p146
aVIn order to survive, he needed
p147
aVto be working. He asked the man
p148
aVto write "dyer."
p149
aVSuddenly the man looked very, very interested.
p150
aVAs a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?
p151
aVOf course he knew.
p152
aVAnd suddenly the man started explaining that
p153
aVactually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:
p154
aVeven the top experts
p155
aVcould not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible,"
p156
aVthe "Waterman" blue ink.
p157
aVAnd my father immediately replied that he knew exactly
p158
aVhow to bleach it.
p159
aVNow, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17
p160
aVwho could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.
p161
aVAnd actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something
p162
aVwe can find in every schoolchild's pencil case:
p163
aVthe so-called "correction pen."
p164
aV(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
VBut it was only the beginning.
p167
aVThat's my father.
p168
aVAs soon as he got to the lab,
p169
aVeven though he was the youngest,
p170
aVhe immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.
p171
aVAll the movements stopped at falsifying.
p172
aVBut demand was ever-growing
p173
aVand it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.
p174
aVHe told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.
p175
aVHe started a press. He started photoengraving.
p176
aVHe started making rubber stamps.
p177
aVHe started inventing all kind of things \u2014
p178
aVwith some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.
p179
aVAnyway, he had to do all this
p180
aVbecause he was completely obsessed with output.
p181
aVHe had made a simple calculation:
p182
aVIn one hour he could make 30 forged documents.
p183
aVIf he slept one hour, 30 people would die.
p184
aa(lp185
VThis sense of
p186
aVresponsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 \u2014
p187
aVand also his guilt for being a survivor,
p188
aVsince he had escaped the camp when his friends had not \u2014
p189
aVstayed with him all his life.
p190
aVAnd this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,
p191
aVhe continued to make false papers
p192
aVat the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.
p193
aVI'd like to talk about those sacrifices,
p194
aVbecause there were many.
p195
aVThere were obviously financial sacrifices
p196
aVbecause he always refused to be paid.
p197
aVTo him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.
p198
aVIf he had accepted payment,
p199
aVhe wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no"
p200
aVdepending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.
p201
aVSo he was a photographer by day,
p202
aVand a forger by night for 30 years.
p203
aVHe was broke all of the time.
p204
aa(lp205
VThen there were the emotional sacrifices:
p206
aVHow can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?
p207
aVHow can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?
p208
aVOf course, there was another kind of sacrifice
p209
aVinvolving his family that I understood much later.
p210
aVOne day my father introduced me to my sister.
p211
aVHe also explained to me that I had a brother, too,
p212
aVand the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,
p213
aVand they were 30 years older than me.
p214
aVThey are both in their sixties now.
p215
aa(lp216
VIn order to write the book,
p217
aVI asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,
p218
aVwho was the father she had known.
p219
aVShe explained that the father that she'd had
p220
aVwould tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.
p221
aVThey would get all dressed up and wait for him,
p222
aVbut he would almost never come.
p223
aVHe'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.
p224
aVAnd then he would not come.
p225
aVThen one day he totally disappeared.
p226
aVTime passed,
p227
aVand they thought he had surely forgotten them,
p228
aVat first.
p229
aVThen as time passed,
p230
aVat the end of almost two years, they thought,
p231
aV"Well, perhaps our father has died."
p232
aVAnd then I understood
p233
aVthat asking my father so many questions
p234
aVwas stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about
p235
aVbecause it was painful.
p236
aVAnd while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned,
p237
aVorphaned,
p238
aVmy father was making false papers.
p239
aVAnd if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.
p240
aa(lp241
VAfter the liberation he made false papers
p242
aVto allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine
p243
aVbefore the creation of Israel.
p244
aVAnd then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,
p245
aVhe made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.
p246
aVAfter the Algerian war,
p247
aVat the heart of the international resistance movements,
p248
aVhis name circulated
p249
aVand the whole world came knocking at his door.
p250
aVIn Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:
p251
aVGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.
p252
aVAnd then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.
p253
aVHe made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.
p254
aa(lp255
VThere was also Latin America.
p256
aVMy father helped those who resisted dictatorships
p257
aVin the Dominican Republic, Haiti,
p258
aVand then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua,
p259
aVColombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.
p260
aVThen there was the Vietnam War.
p261
aVMy father made false papers for the American deserters
p262
aVwho did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.
p263
aVEurope was not spared either.
p264
aVMy father made false papers for the dissidents
p265
aVagainst Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal,
p266
aVagainst the colonels' dictatorship in Greece,
p267
aVand even in France.
p268
aVThere, just once, it happened in May of 1968.
p269
aVMy father watched, benevolently, of course,
p270
aVthe demonstrations of the month of May,
p271
aVbut his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time
p272
aVbecause he had over 15 countries to serve.
p273
aa(lp274
VOnce, though, he agreed to make false papers
p275
aVfor someone you might recognize.
p276
aV(Laughter)
p277
aVHe was much younger in those days,
p278
aVand my father agreed to make false papers
p279
aVto enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.
p280
aVHe told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant
p281
aVand the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.
p282
aVBut, he agreed to do it,
p283
aVeven though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger,
p284
aVjust because
p285
aVit was a good opportunity
p286
aVto mock the authorities,
p287
aVand to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders \u2014
p288
aVand that ideas have no borders.
p289
aa(lp290
VAll my childhood,
p291
aVwhile my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales,
p292
aVmy father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes
p293
aVwith unshakeable utopias
p294
aVwho managed to make miracles.
p295
aVAnd those heroes did not need an army behind them.
p296
aVAnyhow, nobody would have followed them,
p297
aVexcept for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.
p298
aVI understood much later
p299
aVthat actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.
p300
aVI asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make,
p301
aVhe ever had any regrets.
p302
aVHe said no.
p303
aVHe told me that he would have been unable
p304
aVto witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.
p305
aVHe was persuaded, and he's still convinced
p306
aVthat another world is possible \u2014
p307
aVa world where no one would ever need a forger.
p308
aVHe's still dreaming about it.
p309
aVMy father
p310
aVis here in the room today.
p311
aVHis name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.
p312
aV(Applause)
p313
aVThank you.

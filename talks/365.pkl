VI think all of us have been interested, at one time or another,
p5
aVin the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed,
p6
aVsuch as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders,
p7
aVthe Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe
p8
aVand so on. And within the last decade or two,
p9
aVarchaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems
p10
aVunderlying many of these past collapses.
p11
aVBut there were also plenty of places in the world
p12
aVwhere societies have been developing for thousands of years
p13
aVwithout any sign of a major collapse,
p14
aVsuch as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies
p15
aVin some areas are more fragile than in other areas.
p16
aVHow can we understand what makes some societies more fragile
p17
aVthan other societies? The problem is obviously relevant
p18
aVto our situation today, because today as well, there are
p19
aVsome societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia
p20
aVand Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also
p21
aVsocieties today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhat about ourselves?
p24
aVWhat is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid
p25
aVdeclining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?
p26
aVObviously the answer to this question is not going
p27
aVto be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor
p28
aVexplanation for societal collapses, you know right away
p29
aVthat they're an idiot. This is a complex subject.
p30
aVBut how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?
p31
aVIn analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a
p32
aVfive-point framework \u2014 a checklist of things that I go through
p33
aVto try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point
p34
aVframework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.
p35
aVThis is a European society with literate records,
p36
aVso we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.
p37
aVIn AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,
p38
aVand around 1450 they died out \u2014 the society collapsed,
p39
aVand every one of them ended up dead.
p40
aa(lp41
VWhy did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework,
p42
aVthe first item on the framework is to look for human impacts
p43
aVon the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource
p44
aVbase on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse,
p45
aVthe Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,
p46
aVwhich was a particular problem for them because
p47
aVthey required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.
p48
aVSo they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually
p49
aVunable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is
p50
aVclimate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.
p51
aVIn the case of the Vikings \u2014 in Greenland, the climate got colder
p52
aVin the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate
p53
aVisn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit \u2014 the Eskimos inhabiting
p54
aVGreenland at the same time \u2014 did better, rather than worse,
p55
aVwith cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?
p56
aa(lp57
VThe third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring
p58
aVfriendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that
p59
aVfriendly support is pulled away, that may make a society
p60
aVmore likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,
p61
aVthey had trade with the mother country \u2014 Norway \u2014
p62
aVand that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker,
p63
aVpartly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies.
p66
aVIn the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit \u2014
p67
aVthe Eskimos sharing Greenland \u2014 with whom the Norse
p68
aVgot off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit
p69
aVkilled the Norse and, probably of greater importance,
p70
aVmay have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which
p71
aVthe Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political,
p74
aVeconomic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it
p75
aVmore or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its
p76
aVenvironmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse,
p77
aVcultural factors that made it difficult for them
p78
aVto solve their problems were: their commitments to a
p79
aVChristian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being
p80
aVa competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit,
p81
aVfrom whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part
p82
aVframework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhat about a society today?
p85
aVFor the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to
p86
aVSouthwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager
p87
aVon the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems
p88
aVlike the most pristine environment in the United States.
p89
aVBut scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems.
p90
aVGoing through the same checklist: human environmental impacts?
p91
aVYes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste
p92
aVhave caused damage of billions of dollars.
p93
aVProblems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly
p94
aV200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas
p95
aVfrom salinization, problems of forest management,
p96
aVproblems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:
p97
aVclimate change. Yes \u2014 the climate in Montana is getting warmer
p98
aVand drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation
p99
aVfrom the snow pack, and as the snow is melting \u2014 for example,
p100
aVas the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing \u2014
p101
aVthat's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.
p102
aa(lp103
VThird thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies
p104
aVthat can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of
p105
aVthe income of Montana is not earned within Montana,
p106
aVbut is derived from out of state: transfer payments from
p107
aVsocial security, investments and so on \u2014
p108
aVwhich makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States.
p109
aa(lp110
VFourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems
p111
aVas do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems
p112
aVcreated by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies,
p113
aVand terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:
p114
aVquestion of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes
p115
aVplay into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today
p116
aVseem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.
p117
aVLong-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,
p118
aVand to no government regulation; values that worked well
p119
aVin the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo, I'm looking at these issues of collapses
p122
aVfor a lot of past societies and for many present societies.
p123
aVAre there any general conclusions that arise?
p124
aVIn a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage
p125
aVbeing different, every collapsed or endangered society is different \u2014
p126
aVthey all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain
p127
aVcommon threads that emerge from these comparisons
p128
aVof past societies that did or did not collapse
p129
aVand threatened societies today. One interesting common thread
p130
aVhas to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse
p131
aVafter a society reaches its peak. There are many societies
p132
aVthat don't wind down gradually, but they build up \u2014 get richer
p133
aVand more powerful \u2014 and then within a short time, within a few decades
p134
aVafter their peak, they collapse. For example,
p135
aVthe classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the
p136
aVearly 800s \u2014 literally a few decades after the Maya were building
p137
aVtheir biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.
p138
aa(lp139
VOr again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place
p140
aVwithin a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time
p141
aVwhen the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.
p142
aVAn analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.
p143
aVThese rapid collapses are especially likely where there's
p144
aVa mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,
p145
aVor a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.
p146
aVIn a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,
p147
aVand five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,
p148
aVand then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation
p149
aVhalf empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still
p150
aVbeing half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.
p151
aVSo, this is a frequent theme:
p152
aVsocieties collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.
p153
aa(lp154
VWhat it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned
p155
aVabout a society today, you should be looking not at the value
p156
aVof the mathematical function \u2014 the wealth itself \u2014 but you should
p157
aVbe looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives
p158
aVof the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme
p159
aVis that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make
p160
aVsome societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors
p161
aVare not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,
p162
aVof those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as
p163
aVthe most devastating case of complete deforestation?
p164
aVIt turns out that there were about nine different environmental
p165
aVfactors \u2014 some, rather subtle ones \u2014 that were working against
p166
aVthe Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,
p167
aVlatitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them
p168
aVis that it turns out that a major input of nutrients
p169
aVwhich protects island environments in the Pacific is from
p170
aVthe fallout of continental dust from central Asia.
p171
aVEaster, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust
p172
aVfrom Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's
p173
aVa factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons,
p176
aVare more fragile than others. And then finally,
p177
aVanother generalization. I'm now teaching a course
p178
aVat UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses
p179
aVof societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,
p180
aVhow on earth did these societies not see what they were doing?
p181
aVHow could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?
p182
aVWhat did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree?
p183
aVDidn't they see what they were doing? How could societies
p184
aVnot perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time?
p185
aVAnd I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on,
p186
aVthen maybe in the next century people will be asking,
p187
aVwhy on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see
p188
aVthe obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action?
p189
aVIt seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem
p190
aVincredible what we are doing today. And so I've been
p191
aVtrying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations
p192
aVabout why societies fail to solve their problems \u2014
p193
aVwhy they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them,
p194
aVwhy they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them,
p195
aVwhy do they fail to succeed in solving them?
p196
aa(lp197
VI'll just mention two generalizations in this area.
p198
aVOne blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,
p199
aVis where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term
p200
aVinterest of the decision-making elites and the long-term
p201
aVinterest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites
p202
aVare able to insulate themselves from the consequences
p203
aVof their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite
p204
aVis bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite
p205
aVdoing things that would bring the society down in the long run.
p206
aVFor example, among the Greenland Norse \u2014
p207
aVa competitive rank society \u2014 what the chiefs really wanted
p208
aVis more followers and more sheep and more resources
p209
aVto outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs
p210
aVto do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land,
p211
aVforcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made
p212
aVthe chiefs powerful in the short run,
p213
aVbut led to the society's collapse in the long run.
p214
aa(lp215
VThose same issues of conflicts of interest are acute
p216
aVin the United States today. Especially because
p217
aVthe decision makers in the United States are frequently
p218
aVable to insulate themselves from consequences
p219
aVby living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water
p220
aVand so on. And within the last couple of years,
p221
aVit's been obvious that the elite in the business world
p222
aVcorrectly perceive that they can advance
p223
aVtheir short-term interest by doing things that are
p224
aVgood for them but bad for society as a whole,
p225
aVsuch as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron
p226
aVand other businesses. They are quite correct
p227
aVthat these things are good for them in the short term,
p228
aValthough bad for society in the long term.
p229
aVSo, that's one general conclusion about why societies
p230
aVmake bad decisions: conflicts of interest.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd the other generalization that I want to mention
p233
aVis that it's particularly hard for a society to make
p234
aVquote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving
p235
aVstrongly held values that are good in many circumstances
p236
aVbut are poor in other circumstances. For example,
p237
aVthe Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment,
p238
aVwere held together for four-and-a-half centuries
p239
aVby their shared commitment to religion,
p240
aVand by their strong social cohesion. But those two things \u2014
p241
aVcommitment to religion and strong social cohesion \u2014
p242
aValso made it difficult for them to change at the end
p243
aVand to learn from the Inuit. Or today \u2014 Australia.
p244
aVOne of the things that enabled Australia to survive
p245
aVin this remote outpost of European civilization
p246
aVfor 250 years has been their British identity.
p247
aVBut today, their commitment to a British identity
p248
aVis serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt
p249
aVto their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult
p250
aVto change course when the things that get you in trouble
p251
aVare the things that are also the source of your strength.
p252
aa(lp253
VWhat's going to be the outcome today?
p254
aVWell, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs
p255
aVgoing on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses
p256
aVof a few decades to \u2014 all of them, not more than 50 years,
p257
aVand any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water,
p258
aVof soil, of climate change, invasive species,
p259
aVthe photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. \u2014
p260
aVlisting about 12 of them. And while these time bombs \u2014
p261
aVnone of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them
p262
aVhave fuses of a few decades \u2014 some of them, in some places,
p263
aVhave much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now,
p264
aVthe Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest
p265
aVwithin five years. And the Solomon Islands are only
p266
aVone year away from losing their loggable forest,
p267
aVwhich is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular
p268
aVfor the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,
p269
aVJared, what's the most important thing that we need to do
p270
aVabout the world's environmental problems?
p271
aVAnd my answer is, the most important thing we need to do
p272
aVis to forget about there being any single thing that is
p273
aVthe most important thing we need to do.
p274
aVInstead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.
p275
aVAnd we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,
p276
aVwe fail to solve the 12th \u2014 we're in trouble. For example,
p277
aVif we solve our problems of water and soil and population,
p278
aVbut don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.
p279
aa(lp280
VThe fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course,
p281
aVwhich means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.
p282
aVAnd the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.
p283
aVThat means that those of us in this room who are less than
p284
aV50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved,
p285
aVand those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see
p286
aVthe resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will.
p287
aVThe resolution is going to achieve either of two forms:
p288
aVeither we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses
p289
aVin pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action,
p290
aVor else these conflicts are going to get settled
p291
aVin unpleasant ways not of our choice \u2014 namely, by war,
p292
aVdisease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our
p293
aVnon-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another
p294
aVin a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session
p295
aVis choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should
p296
aVget pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion.
p297
aa(lp298
VThe big problems facing the world today are not at all
p299
aVthings beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid
p300
aVabout to crash into us, something we can do nothing about.
p301
aVInstead, all the major threats facing us today are problems
p302
aVentirely of our own making. And since we made the problems,
p303
aVwe can also solve the problems. That then means that it's
p304
aVentirely in our power to deal with these problems.
p305
aVIn particular, what can all of us do? For those of you
p306
aVwho are interested in these choices, there are lots of things
p307
aVyou can do. There's a lot that we don't understand,
p308
aVand that we need to understand. And there's a lot that
p309
aVwe already do understand, but aren't doing, and that
p310
aVwe need to be doing. Thank you.

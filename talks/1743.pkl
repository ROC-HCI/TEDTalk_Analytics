VHey guys.
p5
aVIt's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver,
p6
aVbecause that was, like, I loved it,
p7
aVand when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill
p8
aVand I was like, "Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden."
p9
aVAnd \u2014 (Drilling noise) (Laughter)
p10
aVAnd it worked really well there.
p11
aVAnd you know, it had a profound effect on me.
p12
aVIt sounds silly, but I thought, okay,
p13
aVthe way the world works can be changed,
p14
aVand it can be changed by me in these small ways.
p15
aVAnd my relationship to
p16
aVespecially human-made objects
p17
aVwhich someone else said they work like this,
p18
aVwell, I can say they work a different way, a little bit.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd so, about 20 years later,
p21
aVI didn't realize the full effect of this,
p22
aVbut I went to Costa Rica
p23
aVand I stayed with these Guaymí natives there,
p24
aVand they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them,
p25
aVand they could make beds out of trees,
p26
aVand they could \u2014 I watched this woman for three days.
p27
aVI was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart,
p28
aVthese little threads off of it, and she'd roll the threads together
p29
aVand make little thicker threads, like strings,
p30
aVand she would weave the strings together,
p31
aVand as the materiality of this exact very bag
p32
aVformed before my eyes over those three days,
p33
aVthe materiality of the way the world works,
p34
aVof reality, kind of started to unravel in my mind,
p35
aVbecause I realized that this bag and these clothes
p36
aVand the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener,
p37
aVeverything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock
p38
aVor something we dug out of the ground and did some process to,
p39
aVmaybe a more complicated one, but still, everything was made that way.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd so I had to start studying,
p42
aVwho is it that's making these decisions?
p43
aVWho's making these things? How did they make them?
p44
aVWhat stops us from making them?
p45
aVBecause this is how reality is created.
p46
aVSo I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab,
p47
aVand I was studying the maker movement
p48
aVand makers and creativity.
p49
aVAnd I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís
p50
aVdoing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp,
p53
aVwhere there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out
p54
aVand willing to try anything.
p55
aVSo I said, "Let's go into the woods near this stream
p56
aVand just put stuff together, you know, make something,
p57
aVI don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you.
p58
aVWe won't bring anything with us.
p59
aVAnd, like, within minutes, this is very easy for adults
p60
aVand teens to do.
p61
aVHere's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream,
p62
aVand the shape of an oak leaf being made
p63
aVby other small oak leaves being put together.
p64
aVA leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass.
p65
aVThe materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom
p66
aVbeing explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it.
p67
aVAnd after about 45 minutes, you get really intricate projects
p68
aVlike leaves sorted by hue, so you get a color fade
p69
aVand put in a circle like a wreath.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd the creator of this, he said,
p72
aV"This is fire. I call this fire."
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd someone asked him, "How do you get those sticks
p75
aVto stay on that tree?"
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd he's like, "I don't know, but I can show you."
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd I'm like, "Wow, that's really amazing.
p80
aVHe doesn't know, but he can show you."
p81
aVSo his hands know and his intuition knows,
p82
aVbut sometimes what we know gets in the way
p83
aVof what could be, especially
p84
aVwhen it comes to the human-made, human-built world.
p85
aVWe think we already know how something works,
p86
aVso we can't imagine how it could work.
p87
aVWe know how it's supposed to work,
p88
aVso we can't suppose all the things that could be possible.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo kids don't have as hard of a time with this,
p91
aVand I saw in my own son, I gave him this book.
p92
aVI'm a good hippie dad, so I'm like,
p93
aV"Okay, you're going to learn to love the moon.
p94
aVI'm going to give you some building blocks
p95
aVand they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks,
p96
aVso it's totally legit."
p97
aVBut he doesn't really know what to do with these.
p98
aVI didn't show him.
p99
aVAnd so he's like, "Okay, I'll just mess around with this."
p100
aVThis is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest.
p101
aVJust going to try to put them in shapes
p102
aVand push on them and stuff.
p103
aVAnd before long, he's kind of got this mechanism
p104
aVwhere you can almost launch and catapult objects around,
p105
aVand he enlists us in helping him.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd at this point, I'm starting to wonder,
p108
aVwhat kind of tools can we give people,
p109
aVespecially adults, who know too much,
p110
aVso that they can see the world as malleable,
p111
aVso they see themselves as agents of change
p112
aVin their everyday lives.
p113
aVBecause the most advanced scientists are really
p114
aVjust kind of pushing the way the world itself works,
p115
aVpushing what matter can do,
p116
aVthe most advanced artists are just pushing the medium,
p117
aVand any sufficiently complicated task,
p118
aVwhether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child \u2014
p119
aVanything that's complicated \u2014
p120
aVcomes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it,
p121
aVand you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say,
p122
aV"Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this.
p123
aVI don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing.
p124
aVI'm going to use them a different way."
p125
aa(lp126
VSo let me show you a little demo.
p127
aVThis is a little piano circuit right in here,
p128
aVand this is an ordinary paintbrush
p129
aVthat I smashed it together with. (Beeping)
p130
aVAnd so, with some ketchup,
p131
aV\u2014 (musical notes) \u2014
p132
aVand then I can kind of
p133
aV\u2014 (musical notes) \u2014
p134
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd that's awesome, right?
p137
aVBut this is not what's awesome.
p138
aVWhat's awesome is what happens
p139
aVwhen you give the piano circuit to people.
p140
aVA pencil is not just a pencil.
p141
aVLook what it has in the middle of it.
p142
aVThat's a wire running down the middle,
p143
aVand not only is it a wire,
p144
aVif you take that piano circuit, you can thumbtack
p145
aVinto the middle of a pencil,
p146
aVand you can lay out wire on the page, too,
p147
aVand get electrical current to run through it.
p148
aVAnd so you can kind of hack a pencil,
p149
aVjust by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd the electricity runs through your body too.
p152
aVAnd then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil.
p153
aVYou can make one of these brushes just on the fly.
p154
aVAll you do is connect to the bristles,
p155
aVand the bristles are wet, so they conduct,
p156
aVand the person's body conducts,
p157
aVand leather is great to paint on,
p158
aVand then you can start hooking to everything,
p159
aVeven the kitchen sink.
p160
aVThe metal in the sink is conductive.
p161
aVFlowing water acts like a theremin or a violin.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Musical notes)
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd you can even hook to the trees.
p166
aVAnything in the world is either conductive or not conductive,
p167
aVand you can use those together.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p170
aVI took this to those same teens, because those teens are
p171
aVreally awesome, and they'll try things that I won't try.
p172
aVI don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.
p173
aVAnd this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper,
p174
aVand as the hula hoop traveled around her body,
p175
aVshe has a circuit taped to her shirt right there.
p176
aVYou can see her pointing to it in the picture.
p177
aVAnd every time the hula hoop would smush against her body,
p178
aVit would connect two little pieces of copper tape,
p179
aVand it would make a sound, and the next sound,
p180
aVand it would loop the same sounds over and over again.
p181
aa(lp182
VI ran these workshops everywhere.
p183
aVIn Taiwan, at an art museum, this 12-year-old girl
p184
aVmade a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan
p185
aVand some electrical tape and hot glue.
p186
aVAnd professional designers were making artifacts
p187
aVwith this thing strapped onto it.
p188
aVAnd big companies like Intel
p189
aVor smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump,
p190
aVwere inviting me to give workshops,
p191
aVjust to practice this idea of smashing electronics
p192
aVand everyday objects together.
p193
aVAnd then we came up with this idea
p194
aVto not just use electronics,
p195
aVbut let's just smash computers with everyday objects
p196
aVand see how that goes over.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd so I just want to do a quick demo.
p199
aVSo this is the MaKey MaKey circuit,
p200
aVand I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you.
p201
aVSo I'll just plug it in, and now it's on by USB.
p202
aVAnd I'll just hook up the forward arrow.
p203
aVYou guys are facing that way, so I'll hook it to this one.
p204
aVAnd I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it.
p205
aVAnd now, if I touch this piece of pizza,
p206
aVthe slides that I showed you before should go forward.
p207
aVAnd now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it
p208
aVto the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up,
p209
aVnow I have a left arrow and a right arrow,
p210
aVso I should be able to go forwards and backwards
p211
aVand forwards and backwards. Awesome.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd so we're like, "We gotta put a video out about this."
p214
aVBecause no one really believed that this was important
p215
aVor meaningful except me and, like, one other guy.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo we made a video to prove that
p218
aVthere's lots of stuff you can do.
p219
aVYou can kind of sketch with Play-Doh
p220
aVand just Google for game controllers.
p221
aVJust ordinary Play-Doh, nothing special.
p222
aVAnd you can literally draw joysticks
p223
aVand just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up. (Video game noises)
p224
aVAnd you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target?
p225
aVWell, if you take those out, they hold water great,
p226
aVbut you can totally cut your toes,
p227
aVso yeah, just be careful.
p228
aa(lp229
VYou know the Happiness Project, where the experts
p230
aVare setting up the piano stairs, and how cool that is?
p231
aVWell, I think it's cool,
p232
aVbut we should be doing that stuff ourselves.
p233
aVIt shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works.
p234
aVWe should all be participating
p235
aVin changing the way the world works together.
p236
aa(lp237
VAluminum foil. Everybody has a cat.
p238
aVGet a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS.
p239
aVHover the mouse over the "take a photo" button,
p240
aVand you've got a little cat photo booth.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd so we needed hundreds of people to buy this.
p243
aVIf hundreds of people didn't buy this, we couldn't put it on the market.
p244
aVAnd so we put it up on Kickstarter,
p245
aVand hundreds of people bought it in the first day.
p246
aVAnd then 30 days later,
p247
aV11,000 people had backed the project.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd then what the best part is, we started getting
p250
aVa flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it.
p251
aVSo this is "The Star-Spangled Banner" by eating lunch,
p252
aVincluding drinking Listerine.
p253
aVAnd we actually sent this guy materials.
p254
aVWe're like, "We're sponsoring you, man.
p255
aVYou're, like, a pro maker."
p256
aa(lp257
VOkay, just wait for this one. This is good.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aV(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd these guys at the exploratorium are
p263
aVplaying house plants as if they were drums.
p264
aVAnd dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd then this brother \u2014 look at this diagram.
p267
aVSee where it says "sister"?
p268
aVI love when people put humans on the diagram.
p269
aVI always add humans to any technical \u2014
p270
aVif you're drawing a technical diagram, put a human in it.
p271
aVAnd this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister
p272
aVso that on her birthday, she could be the star of the show,
p273
aVjumping on the trampoline to advance the slides.
p274
aVAnd this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd this is fun,
p277
aVand what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun?
p278
aVBut it's also very serious because
p279
aVall this accessibility stuff started coming up,
p280
aVwhere people can't use computers, necessarily.
p281
aVLike this dad who wrote us, his son has cerebral palsy
p282
aVand he can't use a normal keyboard.
p283
aVAnd so his dad couldn't necessarily afford
p284
aVto buy all these custom controllers.
p285
aVAnd so, with the MaKey MaKey, he planned to make
p286
aVthese gloves to allow him to navigate the web.
p287
aVAnd a huge eruption of discussion
p288
aVaround accessibility came, and we're really excited about that.
p289
aVWe didn't plan for that at all.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd then all these professional musicians started using it,
p292
aVlike at Coachella, just this weekend
p293
aVJurassic 5 was using this onstage,
p294
aVand this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here,
p295
aVand he put this up last month.
p296
aVAnd I love the carrot on the turntable.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Music: Massive Attack \u2014 "Teardrop")
p299
aa(lp300
VMost people cannot play them that way. (Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd when this started to get serious,
p303
aVI thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in,
p304
aVbecause otherwise people are going to be getting this
p305
aVand they're going to be turning into agents of creative change,
p306
aVand governments will be crumbling,
p307
aVand I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them.
p308
aVAnd I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid
p309
aVof the box, it says, "The world is a construction kit."
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd as you start to mess around this way,
p312
aVI think that, in some small ways, you do start to see
p313
aVthe landscape of your everyday life
p314
aVa little bit more like something you could express yourself with,
p315
aVand a little bit more like you could participate
p316
aVin designing the future of the way the world works.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd so next time you're on an escalator
p319
aVand you drop an M&M by accident,
p320
aVyou know, maybe that's an M&M surfboard, not an escalator,
p321
aVso don't pick it up right away.
p322
aVMaybe take some more stuff out of your pockets
p323
aVand throw it down, and maybe some chapstick, whatever.
p324
aa(lp325
VI used to want to design a utopian society
p326
aVor a perfect world or something like that.
p327
aVBut as I'm kind of getting older
p328
aVand kind of messing with all this stuff,
p329
aVI'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world
p330
aVreally can't be designed by one person
p331
aVor even by a million experts.
p332
aVIt's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands,
p333
aVeach following their own passions,
p334
aVand each kind of like a mosaic coming up
p335
aVand creating this world in their backyards
p336
aVand in their kitchens.
p337
aVAnd that's the world I really want to live in.
p338
aa(lp339
VThank you.

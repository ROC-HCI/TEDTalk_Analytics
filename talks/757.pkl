VAs a researcher, every once in a while
p5
aVyou encounter something
p6
aVa little disconcerting.
p7
aVAnd this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you,
p8
aVand teaches you that you're very wrong
p9
aVabout something that you really believed firmly in.
p10
aVAnd these are unfortunate moments,
p11
aVbecause you go to sleep that night
p12
aVdumber than when you woke up.
p13
aVSo, that's really the goal of my talk,
p14
aVis to A, communicate that moment to you
p15
aVand B, have you leave this session
p16
aVa little dumber than when you entered.
p17
aVSo, I hope I can really accomplish that.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, this incident that I'm going to describe
p20
aVreally began with some diarrhea.
p21
aVNow, we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea.
p22
aVThat's why there's a glass of water up there.
p23
aVFor us, it's a problem, the people in this room.
p24
aVFor babies, it's deadly.
p25
aVThey lack nutrients, and diarrhea dehydrates them.
p26
aVAnd so, as a result, there is a lot of death,
p27
aVa lot of death.
p28
aVIn India in 1960,
p29
aVthere was a 24 percent child mortality rate,
p30
aVlots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate.
p31
aVOne of the big reasons this happened was
p32
aVbecause of diarrhea.
p33
aVNow, there was a big effort to solve this problem,
p34
aVand there was actually a big solution.
p35
aVThis solution has been called, by some,
p36
aV"potentially the most important medical
p37
aVadvance this century."
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, the solution turned out to be simple.
p40
aVAnd what it was was oral rehydration salts.
p41
aVMany of you have probably used this.
p42
aVIt's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium
p43
aVand glucose together so that when you add it to water
p44
aVthe child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.
p45
aVRemarkable impact on mortality.
p46
aVMassive solution to the problem.
p47
aVFlash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortality
p48
aVhas dropped to 6.5 percent today.
p49
aa(lp50
VStill a big number, but a big drop.
p51
aVIt looks like the technological problem is solved.
p52
aVBut if you look, even today
p53
aVthere are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths
p54
aVin India alone.
p55
aVWhat's going on here?
p56
aVWell the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts
p57
aVto those people.
p58
aVThat's actually not true.
p59
aVIf you look in areas where these salts are completely available,
p60
aVthe price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated.
p61
aVMaybe there's a biological answer.
p62
aVMaybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration
p63
aValone doesn't solve. That's not true either.
p64
aVMany of these deaths were completely preventable,
p65
aVand this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing,
p66
aVwhat I want to call "the last mile" problem.
p67
aa(lp68
VSee, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains \u2014
p69
aVtechnological, scientific, hard work,
p70
aVcreativity, human ingenuity \u2014
p71
aVto crack important social problems with technology solutions.
p72
aVThat's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years,
p73
aVthat's mankind moving forward.
p74
aVBut in this case we cracked it,
p75
aVbut a big part of the problem still remains.
p76
aVNine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well,
p77
aVthe last mile's proving incredibly stubborn.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, that's for oral rehydration therapy.
p80
aVMaybe this is something unique about diarrhea.
p81
aVWell, it turns out \u2014 and this is where things get really disconcerting \u2014
p82
aVit's not unique to diarrhea.
p83
aVIt's not even unique to poor people in India.
p84
aVHere's an example from a variety of contexts.
p85
aVI've put a bunch of examples up here.
p86
aa(lp87
VI'll start with insulin, diabetes
p88
aVmedication in the U.S.
p89
aVOK, the American population.
p90
aVOn Medicaid \u2014 if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid,
p91
aVor if you have health insurance \u2014 insulin is pretty straightforward.
p92
aVYou get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection;
p93
aVyou have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.
p94
aVMassive technological advance:
p95
aVtook an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.
p96
aVAdherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?
p97
aVAbout on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.
p98
aVAs a result, 25,000 people a year go blind,
p99
aVhundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year,
p100
aVfor something that's solvable.
p101
aa(lp102
VHere I have a bunch of other examples,
p103
aVall suffer from the last mile problem.
p104
aVIt's not just medicine.
p105
aVHere's another example from technology:
p106
aVagriculture. We think
p107
aVthere's a food problem, so we create new seeds.
p108
aVWe think there's an income problem, so we create
p109
aVnew ways of farming that increase income.
p110
aVWell, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked.
p111
aVIntercropping. Intercropping really increases income.
p112
aVSometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield
p113
aVwhen you mix different varieties of rice side by side.
p114
aVSome people are doing that,
p115
aVmany are not. What's going on?
p116
aVThis is the last mile.
p117
aVThe last mile is, everywhere, problematic.
p118
aa(lp119
VAlright, what's the problem?
p120
aVThe problem is this little three-pound machine
p121
aVthat's behind your eyes and between your ears.
p122
aVThis machine is really strange,
p123
aVand one of the consequences is that people are weird.
p124
aVThey do lots of inconsistent things.
p125
aV(Applause)
p126
aVThey do lots of inconsistent things.
p127
aVAnd the inconsistencies
p128
aVcreate, fundamentally, this last mile problem.
p129
aVSee, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria,
p130
aVthe genes, the things inside here, the blood?
p131
aVThat's complex, but it's manageable.
p132
aVWhen we're dealing with people like this?
p133
aVThe mind is more complex.
p134
aVThat's not as manageable, and that's what we're struggling with.
p135
aa(lp136
VLet me go back to diarrhea for a second.
p137
aVHere's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey,
p138
aVwhich is a survey asked of many Indian women:
p139
aV"Your child has diarrhea.
p140
aVShould you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?"
p141
aVJust so you don't embarrass yourselves, I'll give you the right answer:
p142
aVIt's increase.
p143
aVNow, diarrhea's interesting
p144
aVbecause it's been around for thousands of years,
p145
aVever since humankind really
p146
aVlived side by side enough to have really polluted water.
p147
aVOne Roman strategy that was very interesting
p148
aVwas that \u2014 and it really gave them a comparative advantage \u2014
p149
aVthey made sure their soldiers didn't drink
p150
aVeven remotely muddied waters.
p151
aVBecause if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective
p152
aVon the battlefield.
p153
aVSo, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields,
p154
aVthe breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo, here are these women. They've seen their parents
p157
aVhave struggled with diarrhea, they've struggled with diarrhea,
p158
aVthey've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question?
p159
aVIn India, 35 to 50 percent say "Reduce."
p160
aVThink about what that means for a second.
p161
aVThirty-five to 50 percent of women
p162
aVforget oral rehydration therapy,
p163
aVthey are increasing \u2014
p164
aVthey are actually making their child
p165
aVmore likely to die through their actions.
p166
aVHow is that possible?
p167
aVWell, one possibility \u2014 I think that's how most people respond to this \u2014
p168
aVis to say, "That's just stupid."
p169
aVI don't think that's stupid.
p170
aVI think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.
p171
aVAnd that is, you don't put water
p172
aVinto a leaky bucket.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake.
p175
aVJust doesn't make sense.
p176
aVNow, the model is intuitively right.
p177
aVIt just doesn't happen to be right about the world.
p178
aVBut it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level.
p179
aVAnd that, to me, is the fundamental challenge
p180
aVof the last mile.
p181
aa(lp182
VThis first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.
p183
aVConvincing people to do something \u2014
p184
aVtake oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be \u2014
p185
aVis not an act of information:
p186
aV"Let's give them the data,
p187
aVand when they have data they'll do the right thing."
p188
aVIt's more complex than that.
p189
aVAnd if you want to understand how it's more complex
p190
aVlet me start with something kind of interesting.
p191
aa(lp192
VI'm going to give you a little math problem,
p193
aVand I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.
p194
aVA bat and a ball together cost $1.10.
p195
aVThe bat costs a dollar more than the ball.
p196
aVHow much does the ball cost? Quick.
p197
aVSo, somebody out there says, "Five."
p198
aVA lot of you said, "Ten."
p199
aVLet's think about 10 for a second.
p200
aVIf the ball costs 10, the bat costs...
p201
aVthis is easy, $1.10.
p202
aVYeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.
p203
aVSo, here you all are, ostensibly educated people.
p204
aVMost of you look smart.
p205
aVThe combination of that produces
p206
aVsomething that is actually, you got this thing wrong.
p207
aa(lp208
VHow is that possible? Let's go to something else.
p209
aVI know algebra can be complicated.
p210
aVSo, let's dial this back. That's what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade?
p211
aVLet's go back to kindergarten. OK?
p212
aVThere's a great show on American television that you have to watch.
p213
aVIt's called "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?"
p214
aVI think we've learned the answer to that here.
p215
aVLet's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five-year-olds.
p216
aVHere's what I'm going to do: I'm going to put objects on the screen.
p217
aVI just want you to name the color of the object.
p218
aVThat's all it is. OK?
p219
aa(lp220
VI want you to do it fast, and say it out loud with me,
p221
aVand do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you.
p222
aVReady? Black.
p223
aVNow the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud.
p224
aVReady? Go.
p225
aa(lp226
VAudience: Red. Green.
p227
aVYellow. Blue. Red.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VSendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.
p231
aVAlmost out of kindergarten.
p232
aVWhat is all this telling us?
p233
aVYou see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem
p234
aVis that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world,
p235
aVsome models that you use to understand the world.
p236
aVThese models, like the leaky bucket,
p237
aVwork well in most situations.
p238
aVI suspect most of you \u2014
p239
aVI hope that's true for the rest of you \u2014
p240
aVactually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world.
p241
aa(lp242
VI found a problem, a specific problem
p243
aVthat actually found an error with that.
p244
aVDiarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that.
p245
aVThey are situations where the mental model
p246
aVdoesn't match the reality.
p247
aVSame thing here:
p248
aVYou had an intuitive response to this that was very quick.
p249
aVYou read "blue" and you wanted to say "blue," even though you knew your task was red.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow, I do this stuff because it's fun.
p252
aVBut it's more profound than fun.
p253
aVI'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion.
p254
aVBMW is a pretty safe car.
p255
aVAnd they are trying to figure out, "Safety is good.
p256
aVI want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?"
p257
aV"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests."
p258
aVBut the truth of the matter is, you look at that car,
p259
aVit doesn't look like a Volvo,
p260
aVand it doesn't look like a Hummer.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo, what I want you to think about for a few minutes
p263
aVis: How would you convey safety of the BMW? Okay?
p264
aVSo now, while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task.
p265
aVThe second task is fuel efficiency. Okay?
p266
aa(lp267
VHere's another puzzle for all of you.
p268
aVOne person walks into a car lot,
p269
aVand they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris.
p270
aVThey are saying, "This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do
p271
aVthe environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius,
p272
aV50 miles per gallon."
p273
aVAnother person walks into the lot,
p274
aVand they're about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon,
p275
aVfully loaded, luxury.
p276
aVAnd they say, "You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?"
p277
aVI'm going to do something good for the environment.
p278
aVI'm going to take off some of that weight,
p279
aVand I'm going to buy a Hummer that's 11 miles per gallon."
p280
aa(lp281
VWhich one of these people has done more for the environment?
p282
aVSee, you have a mental model.
p283
aVFifty versus 35, that's a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on.
p284
aVTurns out, go home and do the math,
p285
aVthe nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons.
p286
aVWhy? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about
p287
aVgallons per mile.
p288
aVThink about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency.
p289
aVMiles per gallon is the way we present things.
p290
aa(lp291
VIf we want to encourage change of behavior,
p292
aVgallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.
p293
aVResearchers have found these type of anomalies.
p294
aVOkay, back to BMW. What should they do?
p295
aVThe problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.
p296
aVThis car, which is my Mini, doesn't look that safe.
p297
aVHere was BMW's brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign.
p298
aVThey showed a BMW driving down the street.
p299
aVThere's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck.
p300
aVThe car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident.
p301
aa(lp302
VBWM realizes safety, in people's minds, has two components.
p303
aVYou can be safe because when you're hit, you survive,
p304
aVor you can be safe because you avoid accidents.
p305
aVRemarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.
p306
aVIt harnesses something you already believe.
p307
aVNow, even if I persuaded you to do something,
p308
aVit's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result.
p309
aVYou all probably intended to wake up,
p310
aVI don't know, 6:30, 7 a.m.
p311
aVThis is a battle we all fight every day,
p312
aValong with trying to get to the gym.
p313
aVNow, this is an example of that battle,
p314
aVand makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action,
p315
aVand so one of the fundamental challenges
p316
aVis how we would actually do that. OK?
p317
aa(lp318
VSo, let me now talk about the last mile problem.
p319
aVSo far, I've been pretty negative.
p320
aVI've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior.
p321
aVAnd I think maybe I'm being too negative.
p322
aVMaybe it's the diarrhea.
p323
aVMaybe the last mile problem really should be thought of
p324
aVas the last mile opportunity.
p325
aa(lp326
VLet's go back to diabetes.
p327
aVThis is a typical insulin injection.
p328
aVNow, carrying this thing around is complicated.
p329
aVYou gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe.
p330
aVIt's also painful.
p331
aVNow, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it,
p332
aVyou know, I would obviously use it every day."
p333
aVBut the pain, the discomfort,
p334
aVyou know, paying attention, remembering to put it in your purse
p335
aVwhen you go on a long trip:
p336
aVThese are the day-to-day of life, and they do pose problems.
p337
aVHere is an innovation, a design innovation.
p338
aVThis is a pen, it's called an insulin pen, preloaded.
p339
aVThe needle is particularly sharp.
p340
aVYou just gotta carry this thing around.
p341
aVIt's much easier to use, much less painful.
p342
aVAnywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence,
p343
aVjust as a result of this.
p344
aa(lp345
VThat's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity.
p346
aVYou see, we tend to think the problem is solved
p347
aVwhen we solve the technology problem.
p348
aVBut the human innovation, the human problem
p349
aVstill remains, and that's a great frontier that we have left.
p350
aVThis isn't about the biology of people;
p351
aVthis is now about the brains, the psychology of people,
p352
aVand innovation needs to continue all the way through
p353
aVthe last mile.
p354
aa(lp355
VHere's another example of this.
p356
aVThis is from a company called Positive Energy.
p357
aVThis is about energy efficiency.
p358
aVWe're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now.
p359
aVWhat this company does is they send a letter
p360
aVto households that say, "Here's your energy use,
p361
aVhere's your neighbor's energy use: You're doing well." Smiley face.
p362
aV"You're doing worse." Frown.
p363
aVAnd what they find is just this letter, nothing else,
p364
aVhas a two to three percent reduction in electricity use.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd you want to think about the social value of that
p367
aVin terms of carbon offsets, reduced electricity,
p368
aV900 million dollars per year.
p369
aVWhy? Because for free,
p370
aVthis isn't a new technology, this is a letter \u2014
p371
aVwe're getting a Big Bang in behavior.
p372
aVSo, how do we tackle the last mile?
p373
aVI think this tells us there is an opportunity.
p374
aVAnd I think to tackle it, we need to combine
p375
aVpsychology,
p376
aVmarketing,
p377
aVart, we've seen that.
p378
aVBut you know what we need to combine it with?
p379
aVWe need to combine this with the scientific method.
p380
aa(lp381
VSee what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me,
p382
aVis that the first 999 miles are all about science.
p383
aVNo one would say, "Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it."
p384
aVWe have testing, we go to the lab, we try it again, we have refinement.
p385
aVBut you know what we do on the last mile?
p386
aV"Oh, this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there."
p387
aVThe amount of resources we put in are disparate.
p388
aVWe put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies.
p389
aVHow much are we putting into
p390
aVenergy behavior change
p391
aVin a credible, systematic, testing way?
p392
aa(lp393
VNow, I think that we're on the verge of something big.
p394
aVWe're on the verge of a whole new social science.
p395
aVIt's a social science that recognizes \u2014
p396
aVmuch like science recognizes the complexity of the body,
p397
aVbiology recognizes the complexity of the body \u2014 we'll recognize
p398
aVthe complexity of the human mind.
p399
aVThe careful testing, retesting, design,
p400
aVare going to open up vistas of understanding,
p401
aVcomplexities, difficult things.
p402
aVAnd those vistas will both create new science,
p403
aVand fundamental change in the world as we see it, in the next hundred years.
p404
aVAll right. Thank you very much.
p405
aV(Applause)
p406
aa(lp407
VChris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much.
p408
aVSo, this whole area is so fascinating.
p409
aVI mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists
p410
aVthat they are kind of putting into place
p411
aVacademically, what great marketers
p412
aVhave sort of intuitively known for a long time.
p413
aVHow much is your field talking to great marketers
p414
aVabout their insights into human psychology?
p415
aVBecause they've seen it on the ground.
p416
aa(lp417
VSendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers,
p418
aVand I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say,
p419
aVthere are insights to be gleaned there.
p420
aVForty percent of it is about what marketing is.
p421
aVMarketing is selling an ad to a firm.
p422
aVSo, in some sense, a lot of marketing is about
p423
aVconvincing a CEO, "This is a good ad campaign."
p424
aVSo, there is a little bit of slippage there.
p425
aVThat's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign.
p426
aVAnd one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actually
p427

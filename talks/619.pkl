VEarly visions of wireless power
p5
aVactually were thought of by Nikola Tesla
p6
aVbasically about 100 years ago.
p7
aVThe thought that
p8
aVyou wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly,
p9
aVno one ever thought of that.
p10
aVThey thought, "Who would use it if you didn't?"
p11
aVAnd so, in fact, he actually set about
p12
aVdoing a variety of things.
p13
aVBuilt the Tesla coil. This tower was built
p14
aVon Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.
p15
aVAnd the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power
p16
aVanywhere on Earth.
p17
aVWe'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually, I think the
p18
aVFederal Bureau of Investigation
p19
aVtook it down for security purposes,
p20
aVsometime in the early 1900s.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut the one thing that did come out of electricity
p23
aVis that we love this stuff so much.
p24
aVI mean, think about how much we love this.
p25
aVIf you just walk outside, there are trillions of dollars
p26
aVthat have been invested in infrastructure around the world,
p27
aVputting up wires to get power from where it's created
p28
aVto where it's used.
p29
aVThe other thing is, we love batteries.
p30
aVAnd for those of us that have an environmental element to us,
p31
aVthere is something like 40 billion
p32
aVdisposable batteries built every year
p33
aVfor power that, generally speaking,
p34
aVis used within a few inches or a few feet
p35
aVof where there is very inexpensive power.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo, before I got here,
p38
aVI thought, "You know, I am from North America.
p39
aVWe do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States."
p40
aVSo I thought I'd better look it up first.
p41
aVSo definition number six is the North American
p42
aVdefinition of the word "suck."
p43
aVWires suck, they really do.
p44
aVThink about it. Whether that's you in that picture
p45
aVor something under your desk.
p46
aVThe other thing is, batteries suck too.
p47
aVAnd they really, really do.
p48
aVDo you ever wonder what happens to this stuff?
p49
aV40 billion of these things built.
p50
aVThis is what happens.
p51
aVThey fall apart, they disintegrate,
p52
aVand they end up here.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo when you talk about expensive power,
p55
aVthe cost per kilowatt-hour
p56
aVto supply battery power to something
p57
aVis on the order of two to three hundred pounds.
p58
aVThink about that.
p59
aVThe most expensive grid power in the world
p60
aVis thousandths of that.
p61
aVSo fortunately, one of the other definitions
p62
aVof "suck" that was in there, it does create a vacuum.
p63
aVAnd nature really does abhor a vacuum.
p64
aa(lp65
VWhat happened back a few years ago
p66
aVwas a group of theoretical physicists at MIT
p67
aVactually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance.
p68
aVBasically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb
p69
aVat a distance of about two meters.
p70
aVIt got about 50 percent of the efficiency \u2014
p71
aVby the way, that's still a couple thousand times
p72
aVmore efficient than a battery would be, to do the same thing.
p73
aVBut were able to light that,
p74
aVand do it very successfully.
p75
aVThis was actually the experiment. So you can see
p76
aVthe coils were somewhat larger.
p77
aVThe light bulb was a fairly simple task, from their standpoint.
p78
aa(lp79
VThis all came from a professor
p80
aVwaking up at night to the third night in a row
p81
aVthat his wife's cellphone was beeping
p82
aVbecause it was running out of battery power.
p83
aVAnd he was thinking, "With all the electricity that's out there in the walls,
p84
aVwhy couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep?"
p85
aVAnd he actually came up with this concept
p86
aVof resonant energy transfer.
p87
aVBut inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire.
p88
aVAnd those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other,
p89
aVand actually do transfer power
p90
aVmagnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhat Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do
p93
aVwas separate the coils in a transformer
p94
aVto a greater distance than the size of those transformers
p95
aVusing this technology, which is not dissimilar
p96
aVfrom the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room.
p97
aVIt's a resonant phenomenon
p98
aVfor which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award,
p99
aVwhich is nicknamed the Genius Award,
p100
aVlast September, for his discovery.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo how does it work?
p103
aVImagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers,
p104
aVthere's a capacitor attached to it too.
p105
aVAnd if you can cause that coil to resonate,
p106
aVwhat will happen is it will pulse
p107
aVat alternating current frequencies \u2014
p108
aVat a fairly high frequency, by the way.
p109
aVAnd if you can bring another device
p110
aVclose enough to the source,
p111
aVthat will only work at exactly that frequency,
p112
aVyou can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple,
p113
aVand transfer magnetic energy between them.
p114
aVAnd then what you do is, you start out with electricity,
p115
aVturn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field,
p116
aVturn it back into electricity,
p117
aVand then you can use it.
p118
aa(lp119
VNumber one question I get asked.
p120
aVI mean, people are worried about cellphones being safe.
p121
aVYou know. What about safety?
p122
aVThe first thing is this is not a "radiative" technology.
p123
aVIt doesn't radiate.
p124
aVThere aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field.
p125
aVIt stays within either what we call the source,
p126
aVor within the device.
p127
aVAnd actually, the magnetic fields we're using
p128
aVare basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field.
p129
aVWe live in a magnetic field.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is
p132
aVthat it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency.
p133
aVAnd it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen.
p134
aVThen finally we have governmental bodies everywhere
p135
aVthat will regulate everything we do.
p136
aVThey've pretty much set field exposure limits,
p137
aVwhich all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today
p138
aVsort of sit underneath those guidelines.
p139
aa(lp140
VMobile electronics.
p141
aVHome electronics.
p142
aVThose cords under your desk, I bet everybody here
p143
aVhas something that looks like that or those batteries.
p144
aVThere are industrial applications.
p145
aVAnd then finally, electric vehicles.
p146
aVThese electric cars are beautiful.
p147
aVBut who is going to want to plug them in?
p148
aVImagine driving into your garage \u2014 we've built a system to do this \u2014
p149
aVyou drive into your garage, and the car charges itself,
p150
aVbecause there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall.
p151
aVAnd it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently.
p152
aVThen there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices,
p153
aVwhere people don't have to die of infections anymore
p154
aVif you can seal the thing up.
p155
aVCredit cards, robot vacuum cleaners.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo what I'd like to do is take a couple minutes
p158
aVand show you, actually, how it works.
p159
aVAnd what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here.
p160
aVYou've got a coil.
p161
aVThat coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier
p162
aVthat creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.
p163
aVWe put one on the back of the television set.
p164
aVBy the way, I do make it look a little bit easier than it is.
p165
aVThere's lots of electronics and secret sauce
p166
aVand all kinds of intellectual property that go into it.
p167
aVBut then what's going to happen is, it will create a field.
p168
aVIt will cause one to get created
p169
aVon the other side.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd if the demo gods are willing,
p172
aVin about 10 seconds or so we should see it.
p173
aVThe 10 seconds actually are because we \u2014
p174
aVI don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in
p175
aVwhen you use just a cord.
p176
aVGenerally, you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought
p177
aVwe put a little computer in it that has to wake up
p178
aVto tell it to do that.
p179
aVSo, I'll plug that in.
p180
aVIt creates a magnetic field here.
p181
aVIt causes one to be created out here.
p182
aVAnd as I said, in sort of about 10 seconds
p183
aVwe should start to see ...
p184
aa(lp185
VThis is a commercially \u2014
p186
aV(Applause)
p187
aVavailable color television set.
p188
aVImagine, you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall.
p189
aVHow many people want to hang them on the wall?
p190
aVThink about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down.
p191
aVImagine if you can get rid of it.
p192
aa(lp193
VThe other thing I wanted to talk about was safety.
p194
aVSo, there is nothing going on. I'm okay.
p195
aVAnd I'll do it again, just for safety's sake.
p196
aVAlmost immediately, though, people ask,
p197
aV"How small can you make this? Can you make this small enough?"
p198
aVBecause remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea
p199
aVwas his wife's cellphone beeping.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo, I wanted to show you something.
p202
aVWe're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing.
p203
aVThis a Google G1.
p204
aVYou know, it's the latest thing that's come out.
p205
aVIt runs the Android operating system.
p206
aVI think I heard somebody talk about that before.
p207
aVIt's odd. It has a battery.
p208
aVIt also has coiled electronics
p209
aVthat WiTricity has put into the back of it.
p210
aVAnd if I can get the camera \u2014
p211
aVokay, great \u2014
p212
aVyou'll see, as I get sort of close...
p213
aVyou're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly.
p214
aV(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd I know some of you are Apple aficionados.
p217
aVSo, you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones.
p218
aVSo we put a little sleeve on the back,
p219
aVbut we should be able to get this guy to wake up too.
p220
aVAnd those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center.
p221
aV(Applause)
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd Nokia as well.
p224
aVYou'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that,
p225
aVand it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.
p226
aVBut they typically use it to light up the screen.
p227
aVSo, imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling.
p228
aVThey could go in the floor. They could go, actually, underneath your desktop.
p229
aVSo that when you walk in or you come in from home,
p230
aVif you carry a purse, it works in your purse.
p231
aVYou never have to worry about plugging these things in again.
p232
aVAnd think of what that would do for you.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo I think in closing,
p235
aVsort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine,
p236
aVI thought I'd put up one more slide.
p237
aVAnd for those of you who can't read it, it says,
p238
aV"It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology."
p239
aVSo, thank you very much.
p240
aV(Applause)

If the two coils are correctly tuned to one another, energy flows from the connected one (installed, say, on the ceiling of a room) into the other (inside, say, your laptop).

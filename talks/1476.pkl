VEvidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures
p5
aVcreate their identity in some kind of narrative form.
p6
aVFrom mother to daughter, preacher to congregant,
p7
aVteacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.
p8
aVWhether in cave paintings
p9
aVor the latest uses of the Internet,
p10
aVhuman beings have always told their histories and truths
p11
aVthrough parable and fable.
p12
aVWe are inveterate storytellers.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut where, in our increasingly secular and fragmented world,
p15
aVdo we offer communality of experience,
p16
aVunmediated by our own furious consumerism?
p17
aVAnd what narrative, what history,
p18
aVwhat identity, what moral code
p19
aVare we imparting to our young?
p20
aa(lp21
VCinema is arguably
p22
aVthe 20th century's most influential art form.
p23
aVIts artists told stories
p24
aVacross national boundaries,
p25
aVin as many languages, genres and philosophies
p26
aVas one can imagine.
p27
aVIndeed, it is hard to find a subject
p28
aVthat film has yet to tackle.
p29
aVDuring the last decade
p30
aVwe've seen a vast integration of global media,
p31
aVnow dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.
p32
aVWe are increasingly offered a diet
p33
aVin which sensation, not story, is king.
p34
aVWhat was common to us all 40 years ago \u2014
p35
aVthe telling of stories between generations \u2014
p36
aVis now rarified.
p37
aVAs a filmmaker, it worried me.
p38
aVAs a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.
p39
aVWhat future could the young build
p40
aVwith so little grasp
p41
aVof where they've come from
p42
aVand so few narratives of what's possible?
p43
aVThe irony is palpable;
p44
aVtechnical access has never been greater,
p45
aVcultural access never weaker.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB,
p48
aVan organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools
p49
aVfollowed by discussions.
p50
aVIf we could raid the annals of 100 years of film,
p51
aVmaybe we could build a narrative
p52
aVthat would deliver meaning
p53
aVto the fragmented and restless world of the young.
p54
aVGiven the access to technology,
p55
aVeven a school in a tiny rural hamlet
p56
aVcould project a DVD onto a white board.
p57
aa(lp58
VIn the first nine months
p59
aVwe ran 25 clubs across the U.K.,
p60
aVwith kids in age groups between five and 18
p61
aVwatching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.
p62
aVThe films were curated and contextualized.
p63
aVBut the choice was theirs,
p64
aVand our audience quickly grew
p65
aVto choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.
p66
aVThe outcome, immediate.
p67
aVIt was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.
p68
aVIn groups as large as 150 and as small as three,
p69
aVthese young people discovered new places,
p70
aVnew thoughts, new perspectives.
p71
aVBy the time the pilot had finished,
p72
aVwe had the names of a thousand schools
p73
aVthat wished to join.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe film that changed my life
p76
aVis a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."
p77
aVIt's a remarkable comment
p78
aVon slums, poverty and aspiration.
p79
aVI had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.
p80
aVTechnology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema,
p81
aVfind and pay for the print and the projectionist.
p82
aVBut for my father,
p83
aVthe emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great
p84
aVthat he chose to celebrate his half-century
p85
aVwith his three teenage children and 30 of their friends,
p86
aV"In order," he said,
p87
aV"to pass the baton of concern and hope
p88
aVon to the next generation."
p89
aa(lp90
VIn the last shot of "Miracle in Milan,"
p91
aVslum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.
p92
aVSixty years after the film was made
p93
aVand 30 years after I first saw it,
p94
aVI see young faces tilt up in awe,
p95
aVtheir incredulity matching mine.
p96
aVAnd the speed with which they associate it
p97
aVwith "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio
p98
aVspeaks to the enduring nature.
p99
aa(lp100
VIn a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government,
p101
aVwe screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
p102
aVMade in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.
p103
aVFrank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.
p104
aVIt shows how to do right,
p105
aVhow to be heroically awkward.
p106
aVIt is also an expression of faith
p107
aVin the political machine as a force of honor.
p108
aa(lp109
VShortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic,
p110
aVthere was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.
p111
aVAnd it was with great delight
p112
aVthat we found young people up and down the country
p113
aVexplaining with authority
p114
aVwhat filibustering was
p115
aVand why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.
p116
aVAfter all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels.
p117
aa(lp118
VIn choosing "Hotel Rwanda,"
p119
aVthey explored genocide of the most brutal kind.
p120
aVIt provoked tears as well as incisive questions
p121
aVabout unarmed peace-keeping forces
p122
aVand the double-dealing of a Western society
p123
aVthat picks its moral fights with commodities in mind.
p124
aVAnd when "Schindler's List" demanded that they never forget,
p125
aVone child, full of the pain of consciousness, remarked,
p126
aV"We already forgot,
p127
aVotherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen?"
p128
aa(lp129
VAs they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.
p130
aV"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.
p131
aV"To Sir, with Love" ignited its teen audience.
p132
aVThey celebrated a change in attitude
p133
aVtowards non-white Britons,
p134
aVbut railed against our restless school system
p135
aVthat does not value collective identity,
p136
aVunlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.
p137
aa(lp138
VBy now, these thoughtful, opinionated, curious young people
p139
aVthought nothing of tackling films of all forms \u2014
p140
aVblack and white, subtitled,
p141
aVdocumentary, non-narrative, fantasy \u2014
p142
aVand thought nothing of writing detailed reviews
p143
aVthat competed to favor one film over another
p144
aVin passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose.
p145
aVSix thousand reviews each school week
p146
aVvying for the honor of being review of the week.
p147
aa(lp148
VFrom 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands,
p149
aVuntil we were nearly a quarter of a million kids
p150
aVin 7,000 clubs right across the country.
p151
aVAnd although the numbers were, and continue to be, extraordinary,
p152
aVwhat became more extraordinary
p153
aVwas how the experience of critical and curious questioning
p154
aVtranslated into life.
p155
aVSome of our kids started talking with their parents,
p156
aVothers with their teachers,
p157
aVor with their friends.
p158
aVAnd those without friends
p159
aVstarted making them.
p160
aa(lp161
VThe films provided communality across all manner of divide.
p162
aVAnd the stories they held provided a shared experience.
p163
aV"Persepolis" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother,
p164
aVand "Jaws" became the way in which one young boy
p165
aVwas able to articulate the fear he'd experienced
p166
aVin flight from violence
p167
aVthat killed first his father then his mother,
p168
aVthe latter thrown overboard on a boat journey.
p169
aa(lp170
VWho was right, who wrong?
p171
aVWhat would they do under the same conditions?
p172
aVWas the tale told well?
p173
aVWas there a hidden message?
p174
aVHow has the world changed? How could it be different?
p175
aVA tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children
p176
aVwho the world didn't think were interested.
p177
aVAnd they themselves had not known they cared.
p178
aVAnd as they wrote and debated,
p179
aVrather than seeing the films as artifacts,
p180
aVthey began to see themselves.
p181
aa(lp182
VI have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller.
p183
aVIn a moment she can invoke images
p184
aVof running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers.
p185
aVQuite recently she told me
p186
aVthat in 1948, two of her sisters and my father
p187
aVtraveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.
p188
aVWhen the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions,
p189
aVit was these teenagers that fed the crew.
p190
aVI was past 40 when my father died.
p191
aVHe never mentioned that journey.
p192
aa(lp193
VMy mother's mother left Europe in a hurry
p194
aVwithout her husband, but with her three-year-old daughter
p195
aVand diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt.
p196
aVAfter two years in hiding,
p197
aVmy grandfather appeared in London.
p198
aVHe was never right again.
p199
aVAnd his story was hushed as he assimilated.
p200
aa(lp201
VMy story started in England
p202
aVwith a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents.
p203
aVI had "Anne Frank," "The Great Escape,"
p204
aV"Shoah," "Triumph of the Will."
p205
aVIt was Leni Riefenstahl
p206
aVin her elegant Nazi propaganda
p207
aVwho gave context to what the family had to endure.
p208
aVThese films held what was too hurtful to say out loud,
p209
aVand they became more useful to me
p210
aVthan the whispers of survivors
p211
aVand the occasional glimpse of a tattoo
p212
aVon a maiden aunt's wrist.
p213
aa(lp214
VPurists may feel that fiction dissipates
p215
aVthe quest of real human understanding,
p216
aVthat film is too crude
p217
aVto tell a complex and detailed history,
p218
aVor that filmmakers always serve drama over truth.
p219
aVBut within the reels lie purpose and meaning.
p220
aVAs one 12-year-old said after watching "Wizard of Oz,"
p221
aV"Every person should watch this,
p222
aVbecause unless you do
p223
aVyou may not know that you too have a heart."
p224
aa(lp225
VWe honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?
p226
aVConsider "Citizen Kane" as valuable as Jane Austen.
p227
aVAgree that "Boyz n the Hood," like Tennyson,
p228
aVoffers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding
p229
aVthat work together.
p230
aVEach a piece of memorable art,
p231
aVeach a brick in the wall of who we are.
p232
aVAnd it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks
p233
aVbetter than astronaut Jim Lovell
p234
aVor have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's.
p235
aVAnd though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce
p236
aVare an opportunity to discover
p237
aVwhat it is to be human,
p238
aVand no less helpful to understanding our life and times
p239
aVas Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.
p240
aa(lp241
VWe guessed that film,
p242
aVwhose stories are a meeting place
p243
aVof drama, music, literature and human experience,
p244
aVwould engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.
p245
aVWhat we could not have foreseen
p246
aVwas the measurable improvements
p247
aVin behavior, confidence and academic achievement.
p248
aVOnce-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers,
p249
aVfight, not on the playground,
p250
aVbut to choose next week's film \u2014
p251
aVyoung people who have found self-definition, ambition
p252
aVand an appetite for education and social engagement
p253
aVfrom the stories they have witnessed.
p254
aa(lp255
VOur members defy the binary description
p256
aVof how we so often describe our young.
p257
aVThey are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.
p258
aVThey are, like other young people,
p259
aVnegotiating a world with infinite choice,
p260
aVbut little culture of how to find meaningful experience.
p261
aVWe appeared surprised at the behaviors
p262
aVof those who define themselves
p263
aVby the size of the tick on their shoes,
p264
aVyet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.
p265
aa(lp266
VIf we want different values
p267
aVwe have to tell a different story,
p268
aVa story that understands that an individual narrative
p269
aVis an essential component of a person's identity,
p270
aVthat a collective narrative
p271
aVis an essential component of a cultural identity,
p272
aVand without it it is impossible to imagine yourself
p273
aVas part of a group.
p274
aVBecause when these people get home
p275
aVafter a screening of "Rear Window"
p276
aVand raise their gaze to the building next door,
p277
aVthey have the tools to wonder who, apart from them,
p278
aVis out there
p279
aVand what is their story.
p280
aa(lp281
VThank you.

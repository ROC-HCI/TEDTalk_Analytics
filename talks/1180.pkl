VI'd like to begin with a thought experiment.
p5
aVImagine that it's 4,000 years into the future.
p6
aVCivilization as we know it
p7
aVhas ceased to exist \u2014
p8
aVno books,
p9
aVno electronic devices,
p10
aVno Facebook or Twitter.
p11
aVAll knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet
p12
aVhas been lost.
p13
aVNow imagine archeologists
p14
aVdigging through the rubble of one of our cities.
p15
aVWhat might they find?
p16
aVWell perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic
p17
aVwith strange symbols on them.
p18
aVPerhaps some circular pieces of metal.
p19
aVMaybe some cylindrical containers
p20
aVwith some symbols on them.
p21
aVAnd perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity
p22
aVwhen she discovers \u2014
p23
aVburied in the hills somewhere in North America \u2014
p24
aVmassive versions of these same symbols.
p25
aVNow let's ask ourselves,
p26
aVwhat could such artifacts say about us
p27
aVto people 4,000 years into the future?
p28
aa(lp29
VThis is no hypothetical question.
p30
aVIn fact, this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with
p31
aVwhen we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization,
p32
aVwhich existed 4,000 years ago.
p33
aVThe Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous
p34
aVwith the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations,
p35
aVbut it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations.
p36
aVIt occupied the area
p37
aVof approximately one million square kilometers,
p38
aVcovering what is now Pakistan,
p39
aVNorthwestern India
p40
aVand parts of Afghanistan and Iran.
p41
aVGiven that it was such a vast civilization,
p42
aVyou might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings,
p43
aVand huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings.
p44
aVIn fact,
p45
aVwhat archeologists have found is none of that.
p46
aVThey've found small objects such as these.
p47
aa(lp48
VHere's an example of one of these objects.
p49
aVWell obviously this is a replica.
p50
aVBut who is this person?
p51
aVA king? A god?
p52
aVA priest?
p53
aVOr perhaps an ordinary person
p54
aVlike you or me?
p55
aVWe don't know.
p56
aVBut the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them.
p57
aVWell no, not pieces of plastic,
p58
aVbut stone seals, copper tablets,
p59
aVpottery and, surprisingly,
p60
aVone large sign board,
p61
aVwhich was found buried near the gate of a city.
p62
aVNow we don't know if it says Hollywood,
p63
aVor even Bollywood for that matter.
p64
aVIn fact, we don't even know
p65
aVwhat any of these objects say,
p66
aVand that's because the Indus script is undeciphered.
p67
aVWe don't know what any of these symbols mean.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe symbols are most commonly found on seals.
p70
aVSo you see up there one such object.
p71
aVIt's the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it.
p72
aVNow that's a magnificent piece of art.
p73
aVSo how big do you think that is?
p74
aVPerhaps that big?
p75
aVOr maybe that big?
p76
aVWell let me show you.
p77
aVHere's a replica of one such seal.
p78
aVIt's only about one inch by one inch in size \u2014
p79
aVpretty tiny.
p80
aVSo what were these used for?
p81
aVWe know that these were used for stamping clay tags
p82
aVthat were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other.
p83
aVSo you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes?
p84
aVThese were used to make those kinds of packing slips.
p85
aVYou might wonder what these objects contain
p86
aVin terms of their text.
p87
aVPerhaps they're the name of the sender
p88
aVor some information about the goods
p89
aVthat are being sent from one place to the other \u2014 we don't know.
p90
aVWe need to decipher the script to answer that question.
p91
aa(lp92
VDeciphering the script
p93
aVis not just an intellectual puzzle;
p94
aVit's actually become a question
p95
aVthat's become deeply intertwined
p96
aVwith the politics and the cultural history of South Asia.
p97
aVIn fact, the script has become a battleground of sorts
p98
aVbetween three different groups of people.
p99
aVFirst, there's a group of people
p100
aVwho are very passionate in their belief
p101
aVthat the Indus script
p102
aVdoes not represent a language at all.
p103
aVThese people believe that the symbols
p104
aVare very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs
p105
aVor the emblems you find on shields.
p106
aVThere's a second group of people
p107
aVwho believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language.
p108
aVIf you look at a map of India today,
p109
aVyou'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India
p110
aVbelong to the Indo-European language family.
p111
aVSo some people believe that the Indus script
p112
aVrepresents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit.
p113
aa(lp114
VThere's a last group of people
p115
aVwho believe that the Indus people
p116
aVwere the ancestors of people living in South India today.
p117
aVThese people believe that the Indus script
p118
aVrepresents an ancient form
p119
aVof the Dravidian language family,
p120
aVwhich is the language family spoken in much of South India today.
p121
aVAnd the proponents of this theory
p122
aVpoint to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North,
p123
aVactually near Afghanistan,
p124
aVand they say that perhaps, sometime in the past,
p125
aVDravidian languages were spoken all over India
p126
aVand that this suggests
p127
aVthat the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhich of these hypotheses can be true?
p130
aVWe don't know, but perhaps if you deciphered the script,
p131
aVyou would be able to answer this question.
p132
aVBut deciphering the script is a very challenging task.
p133
aVFirst, there's no Rosetta Stone.
p134
aVI don't mean the software;
p135
aVI mean an ancient artifact
p136
aVthat contains in the same text
p137
aVboth a known text and an unknown text.
p138
aVWe don't have such an artifact for the Indus script.
p139
aVAnd furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke.
p140
aVAnd to make matters even worse,
p141
aVmost of the text that we have are extremely short.
p142
aVSo as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals
p143
aVthat are very, very tiny.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd so given these formidable obstacles,
p146
aVone might wonder and worry
p147
aVwhether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script.
p148
aVIn the rest of my talk,
p149
aVI'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying
p150
aVand love the challenge posed by the Indus script.
p151
aVI've always been fascinated by the Indus script
p152
aVever since I read about it in a middle school textbook.
p153
aVAnd why was I fascinated?
p154
aVWell it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world.
p155
aVMy career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist,
p156
aVso in my day job,
p157
aVI create computer models of the brain
p158
aVto try to understand how the brain makes predictions,
p159
aVhow the brain makes decisions,
p160
aVhow the brain learns and so on.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script.
p163
aVThat's when I was in India,
p164
aVand I had the wonderful opportunity
p165
aVto meet with some Indian scientists
p166
aVwho were using computer models to try to analyze the script.
p167
aVAnd so it was then that I realized
p168
aVthere was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists,
p169
aVand so I jumped at that opportunity.
p170
aVAnd I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found.
p171
aVOr better yet, let's all collectively decipher.
p172
aVAre you ready?
p173
aa(lp174
VThe first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script
p175
aVis try to figure out the direction of writing.
p176
aVHere are two texts that contain some symbols on them.
p177
aVCan you tell me
p178
aVif the direction of writing is right to left or left to right?
p179
aVI'll give you a couple of seconds.
p180
aVOkay. Right to left, how many? Okay.
p181
aVOkay. Left to right?
p182
aVOh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.
p183
aVThe answer is:
p184
aVif you look at the left-hand side of the two texts,
p185
aVyou'll notice that there's a cramping of signs,
p186
aVand it seems like 4,000 years ago,
p187
aVwhen the scribe was writing from right to left,
p188
aVthey ran out of space.
p189
aVAnd so they had to cram the sign.
p190
aVOne of the signs is also below the text on the top.
p191
aVThis suggests the direction of writing
p192
aVwas probably from right to left,
p193
aVand so that's one of the first things we know,
p194
aVthat directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts.
p195
aVAnd the Indus script now has
p196
aVthis particular property.
p197
aa(lp198
VWhat other properties of language does the script show?
p199
aVLanguages contain patterns.
p200
aVIf I give you the letter Q
p201
aVand ask you to predict the next letter, what do you think that would be?
p202
aVMost of you said U, which is right.
p203
aVNow if I asked you to predict one more letter,
p204
aVwhat do you think that would be?
p205
aVNow there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A,
p206
aVbut certainly not B, C or D, right?
p207
aVThe Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns.
p208
aVThere's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol.
p209
aVAnd this in turn tends to be followed
p210
aVby this quotation marks-like symbol.
p211
aVAnd this is very similar to a Q and U example.
p212
aVThis symbol can in turn be followed
p213
aVby these fish-like symbols and some other signs,
p214
aVbut never by these other signs at the bottom.
p215
aVAnd furthermore, there's some signs
p216
aVthat really prefer the end of texts,
p217
aVsuch as this jar-shaped sign,
p218
aVand this sign, in fact, happens to be
p219
aVthe most frequently occurring sign in the script.
p220
aa(lp221
VGiven such patterns, here was our idea.
p222
aVThe idea was to use a computer
p223
aVto learn these patterns,
p224
aVand so we gave the computer the existing texts.
p225
aVAnd the computer learned a statistical model
p226
aVof which symbols tend to occur together
p227
aVand which symbols tend to follow each other.
p228
aVGiven the computer model,
p229
aVwe can test the model by essentially quizzing it.
p230
aVSo we could deliberately erase some symbols,
p231
aVand we can ask it to predict the missing symbols.
p232
aVHere are some examples.
p233
aVYou may regard this
p234
aVas perhaps the most ancient game
p235
aVof Wheel of Fortune.
p236
aa(lp237
VWhat we found
p238
aVwas that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases
p239
aVin predicting the correct symbol.
p240
aVIn the rest of the cases,
p241
aVtypically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer.
p242
aVThere's also practical use
p243
aVfor this particular procedure.
p244
aVThere's a lot of these texts that are damaged.
p245
aVHere's an example of one such text.
p246
aVAnd we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text
p247
aVand make a best guess prediction.
p248
aVHere's an example of a symbol that was predicted.
p249
aVAnd this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script
p250
aVby generating more data that we can analyze.
p251
aa(lp252
VNow here's one other thing you can do with the computer model.
p253
aVSo imagine a monkey
p254
aVsitting at a keyboard.
p255
aVI think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this.
p256
aVSuch a random jumble of letters
p257
aVis said to have a very high entropy.
p258
aVThis is a physics and information theory term.
p259
aVBut just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters.
p260
aVHow many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard?
p261
aVYou might have encountered the stuck-key problem \u2014
p262
aVso basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again.
p263
aVThis kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy
p264
aVbecause there's no variation at all.
p265
aVLanguage, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy;
p266
aVit's neither too rigid,
p267
aVnor is it too random.
p268
aVWhat about the Indus script?
p269
aVHere's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences.
p270
aVAt the very top you find the uniformly random sequence,
p271
aVwhich is a random jumble of letters \u2014
p272
aVand interestingly, we also find
p273
aVthe DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music.
p274
aVAnd both of these are very, very flexible,
p275
aVwhich is why you find them in the very high range.
p276
aVAt the lower end of the scale,
p277
aVyou find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A's,
p278
aVand you also find a computer program,
p279
aVin this case in the language Fortran,
p280
aVwhich obeys really strict rules.
p281
aVLinguistic scripts
p282
aVoccupy the middle range.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow what about the Indus script?
p285
aVWe found that the Indus script
p286
aVactually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.
p287
aVWhen this result was first published,
p288
aVit was highly controversial.
p289
aVThere were people who raised a hue and cry,
p290
aVand these people were the ones who believed
p291
aVthat the Indus script does not represent language.
p292
aVI even started to get some hate mail.
p293
aVMy students said
p294
aVthat I should really seriously consider getting some protection.
p295
aVWho'd have thought
p296
aVthat deciphering could be a dangerous profession?
p297
aVWhat does this result really show?
p298
aVIt shows that the Indus script
p299
aVshares an important property of language.
p300
aVSo, as the old saying goes,
p301
aVif it looks like a linguistic script
p302
aVand it acts like a linguistic script,
p303
aVthen perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands.
p304
aVWhat other evidence is there
p305
aVthat the script could actually encode language?
p306
aa(lp307
VWell linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages.
p308
aVSo for example, here's the same sentence written in English
p309
aVand the same sentence written in Dutch
p310
aVusing the same letters of the alphabet.
p311
aVIf you don't know Dutch and you only know English
p312
aVand I give you some words in Dutch,
p313
aVyou'll tell me that these words contain
p314
aVsome very unusual patterns.
p315
aVSome things are not right,
p316
aVand you'll say these words are probably not English words.
p317
aVThe same thing happens in the case of the Indus script.
p318
aVThe computer found several texts \u2014
p319
aVtwo of them are shown here \u2014
p320
aVthat have very unusual patterns.
p321
aVSo for example the first text:
p322
aVthere's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.
p323
aVThis sign is the most frequently-occurring sign
p324
aVin the Indus script,
p325
aVand it's only in this text
p326
aVthat it occurs as a doubling pair.
p327
aa(lp328
VWhy is that the case?
p329
aVWe went back and looked at where these particular texts were found,
p330
aVand it turns out that they were found
p331
aVvery, very far away from the Indus Valley.
p332
aVThey were found in present day Iraq and Iran.
p333
aVAnd why were they found there?
p334
aVWhat I haven't told you is that
p335
aVthe Indus people were very, very enterprising.
p336
aVThey used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived,
p337
aVand so in this case, they were traveling by sea
p338
aVall the way to Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq.
p339
aVAnd what seems to have happened here
p340
aVis that the Indus traders, the merchants,
p341
aVwere using this script to write a foreign language.
p342
aVIt's just like our English and Dutch example.
p343
aVAnd that would explain why we have these strange patterns
p344
aVthat are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text
p345
aVthat are found within the Indus Valley.
p346
aVThis suggests that the same script, the Indus script,
p347
aVcould be used to write different languages.
p348
aVThe results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion
p349
aVthat the Indus script probably does represent language.
p350
aa(lp351
VIf it does represent language,
p352
aVthen how do we read the symbols?
p353
aVThat's our next big challenge.
p354
aVSo you'll notice that many of the symbols
p355
aVlook like pictures of humans, of insects,
p356
aVof fishes, of birds.
p357
aVMost ancient scripts
p358
aVuse the rebus principle,
p359
aVwhich is, using pictures to represent words.
p360
aVSo as an example, here's a word.
p361
aVCan you write it using pictures?
p362
aVI'll give you a couple seconds.
p363
aVGot it?
p364
aVOkay. Great.
p365
aVHere's my solution.
p366
aVYou could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf \u2014
p367
aVand that's "belief," right.
p368
aVThere could be other solutions.
p369
aVIn the case of the Indus script,
p370
aVthe problem is the reverse.
p371
aVYou have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures
p372
aVsuch that the entire sequence makes sense.
p373
aVSo this is just like a crossword puzzle,
p374
aVexcept that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles
p375
aVbecause the stakes are so high if you solve it.
p376
aa(lp377
VMy colleagues, Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola,
p378
aVhave been making some headway on this particular problem.
p379
aVAnd I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work.
p380
aVHere's a really short text.
p381
aVIt contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign.
p382
aVAnd I want to mention that these seals were used
p383
aVfor stamping clay tags
p384
aVthat were attached to bundles of goods,
p385
aVso it's quite likely that these tags, at least some of them,
p386
aVcontain names of merchants.
p387
aVAnd it turns out that in India
p388
aVthere's a long tradition
p389
aVof names being based on horoscopes
p390
aVand star constellations present at the time of birth.
p391
aVIn Dravidian languages,
p392
aVthe word for fish is "meen"
p393
aVwhich happens to sound just like the word for star.
p394
aVAnd so seven stars
p395
aVwould stand for "elu meen,"
p396
aVwhich is the Dravidian word
p397
aVfor the Big Dipper star constellation.
p398
aVSimilarly, there's another sequence of six stars,
p399
aVand that translates to "aru meen,"
p400
aVwhich is the old Dravidian name
p401
aVfor the star constellation Pleiades.
p402
aVAnd finally, there's other combinations,
p403
aVsuch as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.
p404
aVAnd that could be translated into "mey meen,"
p405
aVwhich is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn.
p406
aVSo that was pretty exciting.
p407
aVIt looks like we're getting somewhere.
p408
aa(lp409
VBut does this prove
p410
aVthat these seals contain Dravidian names
p411
aVbased on planets and star constellations?
p412
aVWell not yet.
p413
aVSo we have no way of validating
p414
aVthese particular readings,
p415
aVbut if more and more of these readings start making sense,
p416
aVand if longer and longer sequences
p417
aVappear to be correct,
p418
aVthen we know that we are on the right track.
p419
aVToday,
p420
aVwe can write a word such as TED
p421
aVin Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script,
p422
aVbecause both of these were deciphered
p423
aVin the 19th century.
p424
aVThe decipherment of these two scripts
p425
aVenabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.
p426
aVThe Mayans
p427
aVstarted speaking to us in the 20th century,
p428
aVbut the Indus civilization remains silent.
p429
aa(lp430
VWhy should we care?
p431
aVThe Indus civilization does not belong
p432
aVto just the South Indians or the North Indians
p433
aVor the Pakistanis;
p434
aVit belongs to all of us.
p435
aVThese are our ancestors \u2014
p436
aVyours and mine.
p437
aVThey were silenced
p438
aVby an unfortunate accident of history.
p439
aVIf we decipher the script,
p440
aVwe would enable them to speak to us again.
p441
aVWhat would they tell us?
p442
aVWhat would we find out about them? About us?
p443
aVI can't wait to find out.
p444
aa(lp445
VThank you.
p446

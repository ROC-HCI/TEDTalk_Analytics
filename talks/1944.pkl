VLet me start by asking you a question, just with a show of hands:
p5
aVWho has an iPhone?
p6
aVWho has an Android phone?
p7
aVWho has a Blackberry?
p8
aVWho will admit in public to having a Blackberry?
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd let me guess, how many of you,
p12
aVwhen you arrived here, like me, went and bought
p13
aVa pay-as-you-go SIM card? Yeah?
p14
aVI'll bet you didn't even know
p15
aVyou're using African technology.
p16
aVPay-as-you-go was a technology, or an idea,
p17
aVpioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom
p18
aVa good 15 years ago,
p19
aVand now, like franchising,
p20
aVpay-as-you-go is one of the most dominant forces
p21
aVof economic activity in the world.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa,
p24
aVwhich I think is the purest form,
p25
aVinnovation out of necessity.
p26
aVBut first, I'm going to ask you some other questions.
p27
aVYou don't have to put your hands up.
p28
aVThese are rhetorical.
p29
aa(lp30
VWhy did Nikola Tesla have to invent
p31
aVthe alternating current that powers the lights
p32
aVin this building or the city that we're in?
p33
aa(lp34
VWhy did Henry Ford have to invent the production line
p35
aVto produce these Fords that came in anything
p36
aVas long as they were black?
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos?
p39
aVBlank stares. That is what a dolos looks like,
p40
aVand in the background, you can see Robben Island.
p41
aVThis is a small dolos, and Eric Merrifield
p42
aVis the most famous inventor you've never heard of.
p43
aVIn 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor
p44
aVin a small South African town called East London,
p45
aVand while he was watching his kids playing
p46
aVwith toys made from oxen bones called dolosse,
p47
aVhe had the idea for this.
p48
aVIt's a bit like a huge jumping jack,
p49
aVand they have used this in every harbor in the world
p50
aVas a breakwater.
p51
aVThe global shipping economy would not be possible
p52
aVwithout African technology like this.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo whenever you talk about Africa,
p55
aVyou have to put up this picture of the world from space,
p56
aVand people go, "Look, it's the Dark Continent."
p57
aVActually, it isn't.
p58
aVWhat it is is a map of innovation.
p59
aVAnd it's really easy to see where innovation's going on.
p60
aVAll the places with lots of electricity, it isn't.
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aV(Applause)
p63
aVAnd the reason it isn't is because everybody's
p64
aVwatching television or playing Angry Birds.
p65
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VSo where it's happening is in Africa.
p68
aVNow, this is real innovation,
p69
aVnot the way people have expropriated the word
p70
aVto talk about launching new products.
p71
aVThis is real innovation, and I define it as problem-solving.
p72
aVPeople are solving real problems in Africa.
p73
aVWhy? Because we have to.
p74
aVBecause we have real problems.
p75
aVAnd when we solve real problems for people,
p76
aVwe solve them for the rest of the world
p77
aVat the same time.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo in California, everybody's really excited
p80
aVabout a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone
p81
aVand you can swipe your credit card,
p82
aVand people say, "We've liberated the credit card
p83
aVfrom the point of sale terminal."
p84
aVFantastic. Why do you even need a credit card?
p85
aVIn Africa, we've been doing that for years,
p86
aVand we've been doing it on phones like this.
p87
aVThis is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela,
p88
aVabout an hour south of Nairobi,
p89
aVand the thing that's so remarkable about the payment system
p90
aVthat's been pioneered in Africa called M-Pesa
p91
aVis that it works on phones like this.
p92
aVIt works on every single phone possible,
p93
aVbecause it uses SMS.
p94
aVYou can pay bills with it,  you can buy your groceries,
p95
aVyou can pay your kids' school fees,
p96
aVand I'm told you can even bribe customs officials.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVSomething like 25 million dollars a day
p99
aVis transacted through M-Pesa.
p100
aVForty percent of Kenya's GDP
p101
aVmoves through M-Pesa using phones like this.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd you think this is just a feature phone.
p104
aVActually it's the smartphone of Africa.
p105
aVIt's also a radio, and it's also a torch,
p106
aVand more than anything else,
p107
aVit has really superb battery life.
p108
aVWhy? Because that's what we need.
p109
aVWe have really severe energy problems in Africa.
p110
aVBy the way, you can update Facebook
p111
aVand send Gmail from a phone like this.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo we have found a way to use
p114
aVthe available technology to send money via M-Pesa,
p115
aVwhich is a bit like a check system
p116
aVfor the mobile age.
p117
aVI come from Johannesburg, which is a mining town.
p118
aVIt's built on gold.
p119
aVThis is a picture I Instagrammed earlier.
p120
aVAnd the difference today is that  the gold of today is mobile.
p121
aVIf you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked,
p122
aVfirst came the infrastructure,
p123
aVthen came the industry around it, the brothels \u2014
p124
aVit's a bit like the Internet today, right? \u2014
p125
aVand everything else that worked with it:
p126
aVbars, saloons, etc.
p127
aVThe gold of today is mobile,
p128
aVand mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo what are some of the things that you can do with it?
p131
aVWell, this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana,
p132
aVand what you do is you take medication,
p133
aVsomething that some people might spend their entire month's salary on,
p134
aVand you scratch off the code,
p135
aVand you send that to an SMS number,
p136
aVand it tells you if that is legitimate
p137
aVor if it's expired.
p138
aVReally simple, really effective, really life-saving.
p139
aVIn Kenya, there's a service called iCow,
p140
aVwhich just sends you really important information
p141
aVabout how to look after your dairy.
p142
aVThe dairy business in Kenya
p143
aVis a $463 million business,
p144
aVand the difference between a subsistence farmer
p145
aVand an abundance farmer
p146
aVis only a couple of liters of milk a day.
p147
aVAnd if you can do that, you can rise out of poverty.
p148
aVReally simple, using a basic phone.
p149
aVIf you don't have electricity, no problem!
p150
aVWe'll just make it out of old bicycle parts
p151
aVusing a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did.
p152
aVThere's another great African that you've heard
p153
aVthat's busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world.
p154
aVHe's also finding a way to reinvent solar power
p155
aVand the electricity industry in North America,
p156
aVand if he's lucky, he'll get us to Mars,
p157
aVhopefully in my lifetime.
p158
aVHe comes from Pretoria, the capital of [South Africa],
p159
aVabout 50 kilometers from where I live.
p160
aVSo back to Joburg, which is sometimes called Egoli,
p161
aVwhich means City of Gold.
p162
aVAnd not only is mobile the gold of today,
p163
aVI don't believe that the gold is under the ground.
p164
aVI believe we are the gold.
p165
aVLike you've heard the other economists say,
p166
aVwe are at the point where China was
p167
aVwhen its boom years began,
p168
aVand that's where we're going.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo, you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge.
p171
aVWell, of course it's happening at the edge,
p172
aVbecause in the middle, everybody's updating Facebook,
p173
aVor worse still, they're trying to understand
p174
aVFacebook's privacy settings.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVThis is not that catchy catchphrase.
p177
aVThis is innovation over the edge.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo, people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent,
p180
aVbut actually it's mobile-only,
p181
aVso while everybody else is doing all of those things,
p182
aVwe're solving the world's problems.
p183
aVSo there's only one thing left to say.
p184
aa(lp185
V["You're welcome"] (Laughter)

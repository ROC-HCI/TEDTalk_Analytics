VI'm here to show you
p5
aVhow something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.
p6
aVYou're about to experience a new, available
p7
aVand exciting technology that's going to make us rethink
p8
aVhow we waterproof our lives.
p9
aa(lp10
VWhat I have here is a cinder block
p11
aVthat we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray
p12
aVthat can be applied to almost any material.
p13
aVIt's called Ultra-Ever Dry,
p14
aVand when you apply it to any material,
p15
aVit turns into a superhydrophobic shield.
p16
aVSo this is a cinder block, uncoated,
p17
aVand you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.
p18
aVNot anymore.
p19
aVPorous, nonporous.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo what's superhydrophobic?
p22
aVSuperhydrophobic is how we measure
p23
aVa drop of water on a surface.
p24
aVThe rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is,
p25
aVand if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.
p26
aVA freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump
p27
aVto about 90 degrees.
p28
aVA windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.
p29
aVBut what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees,
p30
aVand anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.
p31
aVSo as part of the demonstration,
p32
aVwhat I have is a pair of gloves,
p33
aVand we've coated one of the gloves
p34
aVwith the nanotechnology coating,
p35
aVand let's see if you can tell which one,
p36
aVand I'll give you a hint.
p37
aa(lp38
VDid you guess the one that was dry?
p39
aa(lp40
VWhen you have nanotechnology and nanoscience,
p41
aVwhat's occurred is that we're able to now
p42
aVlook at atoms and molecules and actually control them
p43
aVfor great benefits.
p44
aVAnd we're talking really small here.
p45
aVThe way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers,
p46
aVand one nanometer is a billionth of a meter,
p47
aVand to put some scale to that,
p48
aVif you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick,
p49
aVand you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them,
p50
aVyou'd be the width of a human hair.
p51
aVSo very small, but very useful.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd it's not just water that this works with.
p54
aVIt's a lot of water-based materials like concrete,
p55
aVwater-based paint,
p56
aVmud,
p57
aVand also some refined oils as well.
p58
aa(lp59
VYou can see the difference.
p60
aa(lp61
VMoving onto the next demonstration,
p62
aVwe've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it,
p63
aVwe've framed it with the nanotechnology coating,
p64
aVand we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle,
p65
aVand you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass
p66
aVlike you'd normally think it would,
p67
aVexcept when it hits the coating, it stops,
p68
aVand I can't even coax it to leave.
p69
aVIt's that afraid of the water.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Applause)
p72
aa(lp73
VSo what's going on here? What's happening?
p74
aVWell, the surface of the spray coating
p75
aVis actually filled with nanoparticles
p76
aVthat form a very rough and craggly surface.
p77
aVYou'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.
p78
aVAnd it has billions of interstitial spaces,
p79
aVand those spaces, along with the nanoparticles,
p80
aVreach up and grab the air molecules,
p81
aVand cover the surface with air.
p82
aVIt's an umbrella of air all across it,
p83
aVand that layer of air is what the water hits,
p84
aVthe mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.
p85
aVSo if I put this inside this water here,
p86
aVyou can see a silver reflective coating around it,
p87
aVand that silver reflective coating
p88
aVis the layer of air that's protecting the water
p89
aVfrom touching the paddle, and it's dry.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo what are the applications?
p92
aVI mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.
p93
aVEveryone that sees this gets excited, and says,
p94
aV"Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."
p95
aVThe applications in a general sense
p96
aVcould be anything that's anti-wetting.
p97
aVWe've certainly seen that today.
p98
aVIt could be anything that's anti-icing,
p99
aVbecause if you don't have water, you don't have ice.
p100
aVIt could be anti-corrosion.
p101
aVNo water, no corrosion.
p102
aVIt could be anti-bacterial.
p103
aVWithout water, the bacteria won't survive.
p104
aVAnd it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo imagine how something like this
p107
aVcould help revolutionize your field of work.
p108
aVAnd I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration,
p109
aVbut before I do that, I would like to say thank you,
p110
aVand think small.
p111
aV(Applause)
p112
aVIt's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.
p113
aa(lp114
VChris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? (Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
V[Two minutes later...]
p117
aa(lp118
VHe ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.
p119
aVIt's happening!
p120

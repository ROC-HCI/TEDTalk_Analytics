VThe child's symptoms begin
p5
aVwith mild fever, headache, muscle pains,
p6
aVfollowed by vomiting and diarrhea,
p7
aVthen bleeding from the mouth, nose and gums.
p8
aVDeath follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure.
p9
aa(lp10
VSounds familiar?
p11
aVIf you're thinking this is Ebola,
p12
aVactually, in this case, it's not.
p13
aVIt's an extreme form of dengue fever, a mosquito-born disease
p14
aVwhich also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine,
p15
aVand kills 22,000 people each year.
p16
aVThat is actually twice the number of people
p17
aVthat have been killed by Ebola
p18
aVin the nearly four decades that we've known about it.
p19
aVAs for measles, so much in the news recently,
p20
aVthe death toll is actually tenfold higher.
p21
aVYet for the last year,
p22
aVit has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear.
p23
aa(lp24
VClearly, there is something deeply rooted about it,
p25
aVsomething which scares us and fascinates us
p26
aVmore than other diseases.
p27
aVBut what is it, exactly?
p28
aVWell, it's hard to acquire Ebola,
p29
aVbut if you do, the risk of a horrible death is high.
p30
aVWhy?
p31
aVBecause right now, we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd so, that's the clue.
p34
aVWe may have it someday.
p35
aVSo we rightfully fear Ebola,
p36
aVbecause it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases.
p37
aVIn fact, it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles.
p38
aVWe fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it.
p39
aVWe fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola.
p40
aVEbola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut wait a second, why is that?
p43
aVWe've known about Ebola since 1976.
p44
aVWe've known what it's capable of.
p45
aVWe've had ample opportunity to study it
p46
aVin the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.
p47
aVAnd in fact, we've actually had vaccine candidates available now
p48
aVfor more than a decade.
p49
aVWhy is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now?
p50
aa(lp51
VThis goes to the fundamental problem we have
p52
aVwith vaccine development for infectious diseases.
p53
aVIt goes something like this:
p54
aVThe people most at risk for these diseases
p55
aVare also the ones least able to pay for vaccines.
p56
aVThis leaves little in the way of market incentives
p57
aVfor manufacturers to develop vaccines,
p58
aVunless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries.
p59
aVIt's simply too commercially risky.
p60
aa(lp61
VAs for Ebola, there is absolutely no market at all,
p62
aVso the only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now,
p63
aVis actually because of a somewhat misguided fear.
p64
aVEbola was relatively ignored
p65
aVuntil September 11 and the anthrax attacks,
p66
aVwhen all of a sudden, people perceived Ebola
p67
aVas, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhy is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point?
p70
aVWell, partially, because it was really difficult \u2014
p71
aVor thought to be difficult \u2014 to weaponize the virus,
p72
aVbut mainly because of the financial risk in developing it.
p73
aVAnd this is really the point.
p74
aVThe sad reality is, we develop vaccines
p75
aVnot based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people,
p76
aVbut on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines.
p77
aVVaccine development is expensive and complicated.
p78
aVIt can cost hundreds of millions of dollars
p79
aVto take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine.
p80
aa(lp81
VFortunately for diseases like Ebola,
p82
aVthere are things we can do to remove some of these barriers.
p83
aVThe first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure.
p84
aVIn that case, if we want vaccines,
p85
aVwe have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy.
p86
aVWe also need to do a better job at being able to figure out
p87
aVwhich are the diseases that most threaten us.
p88
aVBy creating capabilities within countries, we then create the ability
p89
aVfor those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks
p90
aVwhich are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens.
p91
aVThe data from that then can be used
p92
aVto understand the geographic and genetic diversity,
p93
aVwhich then can be used to help us understand
p94
aVhow these are being changed immunologically,
p95
aVand what type of reactions they promote.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo these are the things that can be done,
p98
aVbut to do this, if we want to deal with a complete market failure,
p99
aVwe have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases.
p100
aVWe have to stop waiting until we see evidence
p101
aVof a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one.
p102
aVSo, for Ebola,
p103
aVthe paranoid fear of an infectious disease,
p104
aVfollowed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries,
p105
aVled the global community to come together,
p106
aVand with the work of dedicated vaccine companies,
p107
aVwe now have these:
p108
aVTwo Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries \u2014
p109
aa(lp110
V(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
Vand a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind.
p113
aa(lp114
VEvery year, we spend billions of dollars,
p115
aVkeeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans
p116
aVto protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen.
p117
aVAnd yet, we spend virtually nothing
p118
aVto prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain
p119
aVas epidemic infectious diseases.
p120
aVAnd make no mistake about it \u2014 it's not a question of "if," but "when."
p121
aVThese bugs are going to continue to evolve
p122
aVand they're going to threaten the world.
p123
aVAnd vaccines are our best defense.
p124
aVSo if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola,
p125
aVwe need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development
p126
aVand in stockpile creation.
p127
aVAnd we need to view this, then, as the ultimate deterrent \u2014
p128
aVsomething we make sure is available,
p129
aVbut at the same time, praying we never have to use it.
p130
aa(lp131
VThank you.

VThis is my great uncle,
p5
aVmy father's father's younger brother.
p6
aVHis name was Joe McKenna.
p7
aVHe was a young husband and a semi-pro basketball player
p8
aVand a fireman in New York City.
p9
aVFamily history says he loved being a fireman,
p10
aVand so in 1938, on one of his days off,
p11
aVhe elected to hang out at the firehouse.
p12
aVTo make himself useful that day, he started polishing all the brass,
p13
aVthe railings on the fire truck, the fittings on the walls,
p14
aVand one of the fire hose nozzles,
p15
aVa giant, heavy piece of metal,
p16
aVtoppled off a shelf and hit him.
p17
aVA few days later, his shoulder started to hurt.
p18
aVTwo days after that, he spiked a fever.
p19
aVThe fever climbed and climbed.
p20
aVHis wife was taking care of him,
p21
aVbut nothing she did made a difference, and when they got the local doctor in,
p22
aVnothing he did mattered either.
p23
aa(lp24
VThey flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital.
p25
aVThe nurses there recognized right away that he had an infection,
p26
aVwhat at the time they would have called "blood poisoning,"
p27
aVand though they probably didn't say it,
p28
aVthey would have known right away
p29
aVthat there was nothing they could do.
p30
aa(lp31
VThere was nothing they could do because the things we use now
p32
aVto cure infections didn't exist yet.
p33
aVThe first test of penicillin, the first antibiotic,
p34
aVwas three years in the future.
p35
aVPeople who got infections either recovered, if they were lucky,
p36
aVor they died.
p37
aVMy great uncle was not lucky.
p38
aVHe was in the hospital for a week, shaking with chills,
p39
aVdehydrated and delirious,
p40
aVsinking into a coma as his organs failed.
p41
aVHis condition grew so desperate
p42
aVthat the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions
p43
aVhoping to dilute the infection surging through his blood.
p44
aa(lp45
VNothing worked. He died.
p46
aVHe was 30 years old.
p47
aa(lp48
VIf you look back through history,
p49
aVmost people died the way my great uncle died.
p50
aVMost people didn't die of cancer or heart disease,
p51
aVthe lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the West today.
p52
aVThey didn't die of those diseases because they didn't live long enough
p53
aVto develop them.
p54
aVThey died of injuries \u2014
p55
aVbeing gored by an ox,
p56
aVshot on a battlefield,
p57
aVcrushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution \u2014
p58
aVand most of the time from infection,
p59
aVwhich finished what those injuries began.
p60
aa(lp61
VAll of that changed when antibiotics arrived.
p62
aVSuddenly, infections that had been a death sentence
p63
aVbecame something you recovered from in days.
p64
aVIt seemed like a miracle,
p65
aVand ever since, we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd now, we are coming to an end of it.
p68
aVMy great uncle died in the last days of the pre-antibiotic era.
p69
aVWe stand today on the threshold of the post-antibiotic era,
p70
aVin the earliest days of a time when simple infections
p71
aVsuch as the one Joe had will kill people once again.
p72
aa(lp73
VIn fact, they already are.
p74
aVPeople are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon
p75
aVcalled antibiotic resistance.
p76
aVBriefly, it works like this.
p77
aVBacteria compete against each other for resources, for food,
p78
aVby manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other.
p79
aVOther bacteria, to protect themselves,
p80
aVevolve defenses against that chemical attack.
p81
aVWhen we first made antibiotics,
p82
aVwe took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them,
p83
aVand bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had.
p84
aa(lp85
VHere is what happened next:
p86
aVPenicillin was distributed in 1943,
p87
aVand widespread penicillin resistance arrived by 1945.
p88
aVVancomycin arrived in 1972,
p89
aVvancomycin resistance in 1988.
p90
aVImipenem in 1985,
p91
aVand resistance to in 1998.
p92
aVDaptomycin, one of the most recent drugs, in 2003,
p93
aVand resistance to it just a year later in 2004.
p94
aa(lp95
VFor 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog \u2014
p96
aVour drug and their resistance,
p97
aVand then another drug, and then resistance again \u2014
p98
aVand now the game is ending.
p99
aVBacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies
p100
aVhave decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest,
p101
aVso there are infections moving across the world
p102
aVfor which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics
p103
aVavailable on the market,
p104
aVtwo drugs might work with side effects,
p105
aVor one drug,
p106
aVor none.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis is what that looks like.
p109
aVIn 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC,
p110
aVidentified a single case
p111
aVin a hospital in North Carolina
p112
aVof an infection resistant to all but two drugs.
p113
aVToday, that infection, known as KPC,
p114
aVhas spread to every state but three,
p115
aVand to South America, Europe
p116
aVand the Middle East.
p117
aVIn 2008, doctors in Sweden
p118
aVdiagnosed a man from India with a different infection
p119
aVresistant to all but one drug that time.
p120
aVThe gene that creates that resistance,
p121
aVknown as NDM, has now spread from India into China, Asia, Africa,
p122
aVEurope and Canada, and the United States.
p123
aa(lp124
VIt would be natural to hope
p125
aVthat these infections are extraordinary cases,
p126
aVbut in fact,
p127
aVin the United States and Europe,
p128
aV50,000 people a year
p129
aVdie of infections which no drugs can help.
p130
aVA project chartered by the British government
p131
aVknown as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance
p132
aVestimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700,000 deaths a year.
p133
aa(lp134
VThat is a lot of deaths,
p135
aVand yet, the chances are good that you don't feel at risk,
p136
aVthat you imagine these people were hospital patients
p137
aVin intensive care units
p138
aVor nursing home residents near the ends of their lives,
p139
aVpeople whose infections are remote from us,
p140
aVin situations we can't identify with.
p141
aa(lp142
VWhat you didn't think about, none of us do,
p143
aVis that antibiotics support almost all of modern life.
p144
aa(lp145
VIf we lost antibiotics,
p146
aVhere's what else we'd lose:
p147
aVFirst, any protection for people with weakened immune systems \u2014
p148
aVcancer patients, AIDS patients,
p149
aVtransplant recipients, premature babies.
p150
aa(lp151
VNext, any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body:
p152
aVstents for stroke, pumps for diabetes,
p153
aVdialysis, joint replacements.
p154
aVHow many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees?
p155
aVA recent study estimates that without antibiotics,
p156
aVone out of ever six would die.
p157
aa(lp158
VNext, we'd probably lose surgery.
p159
aVMany operations are preceded
p160
aVby prophylactic doses of antibiotics.
p161
aVWithout that protection,
p162
aVwe'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body.
p163
aVSo no heart operations,
p164
aVno prostate biopsies,
p165
aVno Cesarean sections.
p166
aVWe'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor.
p167
aVStrep throat used to cause heart failure.
p168
aVSkin infections led to amputations.
p169
aVGiving birth killed, in the cleanest hospitals,
p170
aValmost one woman out of every 100.
p171
aVPneumonia took three children out of every 10.
p172
aa(lp173
VMore than anything else,
p174
aVwe'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives.
p175
aVIf you knew that any injury could kill you,
p176
aVwould you ride a motorcycle,
p177
aVbomb down a ski slope,
p178
aVclimb a ladder to hang your Christmas lights,
p179
aVlet your kid slide into home plate?
p180
aVAfter all, the first person to receive penicillin,
p181
aVa British policeman named Albert Alexander,
p182
aVwho was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus
p183
aVand doctors had to take out an eye,
p184
aVwas infected by doing something very simple.
p185
aVHe walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn.
p186
aVThat British project I mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll
p187
aVright now is 700,000 deaths a year
p188
aValso predicts that if we can't get this under control by 2050,
p189
aVnot long, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year.
p190
aa(lp191
VHow did we get to this point
p192
aVwhere what we have to look forward to
p193
aVis those terrifying numbers?
p194
aVThe difficult answer is, we did it to ourselves.
p195
aVResistance is an inevitable biological process,
p196
aVbut we bear the responsibility for accelerating it.
p197
aVWe did this by squandering antibiotics
p198
aVwith a heedlessness that now seems shocking.
p199
aVPenicillin was sold over the counter until the 1950s.
p200
aVIn much of the developing world, most antibiotics still are.
p201
aVIn the United States, 50 percent
p202
aVof the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary.
p203
aVForty-five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor's offices
p204
aVare for conditions that antibiotics cannot help.
p205
aVAnd that's just in healthcare.
p206
aVOn much of the planet, most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives,
p207
aVnot to cure illnesses,
p208
aVbut to fatten them up and to protect them against
p209
aVthe factory farm conditions they are raised in.
p210
aVIn the United States, possibly 80 percent
p211
aVof the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals, not to humans,
p212
aVcreating resistant bacteria that move off the farm
p213
aVin water, in dust,
p214
aVin the meat the animals become.
p215
aVAquaculture depends on antibiotics too,
p216
aVparticularly in Asia,
p217
aVand fruit growing relies on antibiotics
p218
aVto protect apples, pears, citrus, against disease.
p219
aVAnd because bacteria can pass their DNA to each other
p220
aVlike a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport,
p221
aVonce we have encouraged that resistance into existence,
p222
aVthere is no knowing where it will spread.
p223
aa(lp224
VThis was predictable.
p225
aVIn fact, it was predicted
p226
aVby Alexander Fleming, the man who discovered penicillin.
p227
aVHe was given the Nobel Prize in 1945 in recognition,
p228
aVand in an interview shortly after, this is what he said:
p229
aa(lp230
V"The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment
p231
aVis morally responsible for the death of a man
p232
aVwho succumbs to infection
p233
aVwith a pencillin-resistant organism."
p234
aVHe added, "I hope this evil can be averted."
p235
aa(lp236
VCan we avert it?
p237
aVThere are companies working on novel antibiotics,
p238
aVthings the superbugs have never seen before.
p239
aVWe need those new drugs badly,
p240
aVand we need incentives:
p241
aVdiscovery grants, extended patents,
p242
aVprizes, to lure other companies into making antibiotics again.
p243
aa(lp244
VBut that probably won't be enough.
p245
aVHere's why: Evolution always wins.
p246
aVBacteria birth a new generation every 20 minutes.
p247
aVIt takes pharmaceutical chemistry 10 years to derive a new drug.
p248
aVEvery time we use an antibiotic,
p249
aVwe give the bacteria billions of chances
p250
aVto crack the codes
p251
aVof the defenses we've constructed.
p252
aVThere has never yet been a drug
p253
aVthey could not defeat.
p254
aa(lp255
VThis is asymmetric warfare,
p256
aVbut we can change the outcome.
p257
aVWe could build systems to harvest data to tell us automatically and specifically
p258
aVhow antibiotics are being used.
p259
aVWe could build gatekeeping into drug order systems
p260
aVso that every prescription gets a second look.
p261
aVWe could require agriculture to give up antibiotic use.
p262
aVWe could build surveillance systems
p263
aVto tell us where resistance is emerging next.
p264
aa(lp265
VThose are the tech solutions.
p266
aVThey probably aren't enough either,
p267
aVunless we help.
p268
aVAntibiotic resistance is a habit.
p269
aVWe all know how hard it is to change a habit.
p270
aVBut as a society, we've done that in the past.
p271
aVPeople used to toss litter into the streets,
p272
aVused to not wear seatbelts,
p273
aVused to smoke inside public buildings.
p274
aVWe don't do those things anymore.
p275
aVWe don't trash the environment
p276
aVor court devastating accidents
p277
aVor expose others to the possibility of cancer,
p278
aVbecause we decided those things were expensive,
p279
aVdestructive, not in our best interest.
p280
aVWe changed social norms.
p281
aVWe could change social norms around antibiotic use too.
p282
aa(lp283
VI know that the scale of antibiotic resistance
p284
aVseems overwhelming,
p285
aVbut if you've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb
p286
aVbecause you were concerned about climate change,
p287
aVor read the label on a box of crackers
p288
aVbecause you think about the deforestation from palm oil,
p289
aVyou already know what it feels like
p290
aVto take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem.
p291
aVWe could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too.
p292
aVWe could forgo giving an antibiotic if we're not sure it's the right one.
p293
aVWe could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid's ear infection
p294
aVbefore we're sure what caused it.
p295
aVWe could ask every restaurant,
p296
aVevery supermarket,
p297
aVwhere their meat comes from.
p298
aVWe could promise each other
p299
aVnever again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit
p300
aVraised with routine antibiotic use,
p301
aVand if we did those things,
p302
aVwe could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.
p303
aa(lp304
VBut we have to do it soon.
p305
aVPenicillin began the antibiotic era in 1943.
p306
aVIn just 70 years, we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster.
p307
aVWe won't get 70 years
p308
aVto find our way back out again.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you very much.

VSo how would you run a whole country without oil?
p5
aVThat's the question that sort of hit me
p6
aVin the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.
p7
aVIt never left my brain.
p8
aVAnd I started playing with it more like a puzzle.
p9
aVThe original thought I had: this must be ethanol.
p10
aVSo I went out and researched ethanol,
p11
aVand found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.
p12
aVAbout six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,
p13
aVuntil some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,
p14
aVwhich is, you actually use more
p15
aVclean electrons than the ones you get
p16
aVinside a car, if you use hydrogen.
p17
aVSo that is not going to be the path to go.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd then sort of through a process of
p20
aVwandering around, I got to the thought
p21
aVthat actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars,
p22
aVin a way that is convenient and affordable,
p23
aVyou could get to a solution.
p24
aVNow I started this from a point of view that
p25
aVit has to be something that scales en masse.
p26
aVNot how do you build one car,
p27
aVbut how do you scale this so that it can become
p28
aVsomething that is used by 99 percent of the population?
p29
aVThe thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good
p30
aVas any car that you would have today.
p31
aVSo one, it has to be more convenient than a car.
p32
aVAnd two, it has be more affordable than today's cars.
p33
aVAffordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?
p34
aVAlright? That's not something that we can finance or buy today.
p35
aVAnd convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo we're bound with the laws of physics
p38
aVand the laws of economics.
p39
aVAnd so the thought that I started with was
p40
aVhow do you do this, still within the boundary
p41
aVof the science we know today \u2014
p42
aVno time for science fair, no time for playing around with things
p43
aVor waiting for the magic battery to show up.
p44
aVHow do you do it within the economics that we have today?
p45
aVHow do you do it from the power of the consumer up?
p46
aVAnd not from the power of an edict down.
p47
aa(lp48
VOn a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon,
p49
aVI actually found out that the answer comes
p50
aVfrom separating between the car ownership
p51
aVand the battery ownership.
p52
aVIn a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic
p53
aV"batteries not included."
p54
aVNow if you separate between the two,
p55
aVyou could actually answer the need for a convenient car
p56
aVby creating a network,
p57
aVby creating a network before the cars show up.
p58
aVThe network has two components in them.
p59
aVFirst component is you charge the car whenever you stop \u2014
p60
aVends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive
p61
aVfor about two hours and park for about 22 hours.
p62
aVIf you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon
p63
aVthe ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute.
p64
aVAnd so the first thought that came to mind is,
p65
aVeverywhere we park we have electric power.
p66
aVNow it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world,
p67
aVlike Scandinavia, you already have that.
p68
aVIf you park your car and didn't plug in the heater,
p69
aVwhen you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow that last mile,
p72
aVlast foot, in a sense,
p73
aVis the first step of the infrastructure.
p74
aVThe second step of the infrastructure needs to take care
p75
aVof the range extension.
p76
aVSee we're bound by today's technology on batteries,
p77
aVwhich is about 120 miles if you want to stay within
p78
aVreasonable space and weight limitations.
p79
aV120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people.
p80
aVBut you never want to get stuck.
p81
aVSo what we added is a second element to our network,
p82
aVwhich is a battery swap system.
p83
aVYou drive. You take your depleted battery out.
p84
aVA full battery comes on. And you drive on.
p85
aVYou don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.
p86
aVIt looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash.
p87
aVAnd a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, and
p88
aVwithin two minutes you're back on the road
p89
aVand you can go again.
p90
aVIf you had charge spots everywhere,
p91
aVand you had battery swap stations everywhere,
p92
aVhow often would you do it? And it ends up
p93
aVthat you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.
p94
aVAs a matter of fact, we added to the contract.
p95
aVWe said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year
p96
aVwe start paying you money
p97
aVbecause it's an inconvenience.
p98
aa(lp99
VThen we looked at the question of the affordability.
p100
aVWe looked at the question, what happens when the battery is
p101
aVdisconnected from the car.
p102
aVWhat is the cost of that battery?
p103
aVEverybody tells us batteries are so expensive.
p104
aVWhat we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons,
p105
aVsomething interesting happens.
p106
aVWe can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again.
p107
aVThe battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.
p108
aVRemember in your car you have a gas tank.
p109
aVYou have the crude oil.
p110
aVAnd you have refining and delivery of that crude oil
p111
aVas what we call petrol or gasoline.
p112
aVThe battery in this sense, is the crude oil.
p113
aVWe have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars
p114
aVas the gas tank.
p115
aVBut the crude oil is replaced with a battery.
p116
aVJust it doesn't burn. It consumes itself
p117
aVstep after step after step.
p118
aVIt has 2,000 life cycles these days.
p119
aVAnd so it's sort of a mini well.
p120
aVWe were asked in the past when we bought an electric car
p121
aVto pay for the entire well, for the life of the car.
p122
aVNobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.
p123
aVIn a sense what we've done is
p124
aVwe've created a new consumable.
p125
aa(lp126
VYou, today, buy gasoline miles.
p127
aVAnd we created electric miles.
p128
aVAnd the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.
p129
aVToday 2010, in volume,
p130
aVwhen we come to market, it is eight cents a mile.
p131
aVThose of you who have a hard time calculating what that means \u2014
p132
aVin the average consumer
p133
aVenvironment we're in in the U.S.
p134
aV20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon.
p135
aVThat's cheaper than today's gasoline, even in the U.S.
p136
aVIn Europe where taxes are in place,
p137
aVthat's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel.
p138
aVBut e-miles follow Moore's Law.
p139
aVThey go from eight cents a mile in 2010,
p140
aVto four cents a mile in 2015,
p141
aVto two cents a mile by 2020.
p142
aVWhy? Because batteries life cycle improve \u2014
p143
aVa bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price.
p144
aVAnd these prices are actually with clean electrons.
p145
aVWe do not use any electrons that come from coal.
p146
aVSo in a sense this is
p147
aVan absolute zero-carbon, zero-fossil fuel
p148
aVelectric mile at two cents a mile by 2020.
p149
aVNow even if we get to 40 miles per gallon
p150
aVby 2020, which is our desire.
p151
aVImagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road.
p152
aVThat is an 80 cent gallon.
p153
aVAn 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific
p154
aVwould convert to crude oil,
p155
aVand we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it,
p156
aVthey still can't compete with two cents a mile.
p157
aVThat's a new economic factor,
p158
aVwhich is fascinating to most people.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow this would have been a wonderful paper.
p161
aVThat's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments.
p162
aVAnd some governments told me that it's fascinating
p163
aVthat the younger generation actually thinks about these things.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVUntil I got to the
p166
aVtrue young global leader, Shimon Peres, President of Israel,
p167
aVand he ran a beautiful manipulation on me.
p168
aVFirst he let me go to the prime minister of the country,
p169
aVwho told me, if you can find the money you need for this network,
p170
aV200 million dollars,
p171
aVand if you can find a car company
p172
aVthat will build that car in mass volume,
p173
aVin two million cars \u2014 that's what we needed in Israel \u2014
p174
aVI'll give you country to invest the 200 million into.
p175
aVPeres thought that was a great idea.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo we went out, and we looked at all the car companies.
p178
aVWe sent letters to all the car companies.
p179
aVThree of them never showed up. One of them asked us
p180
aVif we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount.
p181
aVBut one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan,
p182
aVwhen asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.
p183
aVHe said hybrids are like mermaids.
p184
aVWhen you want a fish you get a woman and
p185
aVwhen you need a woman you get a fish.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVAnd Ghosn came up and said,
p188
aV"I have the car, Mr. Peres; I will build you the cars."
p189
aVAnd actually true to form, Renault has put a billion and a half dollars
p190
aVin building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model
p191
aVthat will come into the market in mass volume \u2014
p192
aVmass volume being the first year, 100 thousand cars.
p193
aVIt's the first mass-volume electric car,
p194
aVzero-emission electric car in the market.
p195
aVI was running, as Chris said,
p196
aVto be the CEO of a large software company called SAP
p197
aVAnd then Peres said, "Well won't you run this project?"
p198
aVAnd I said, "I'm ready for CEO" And he said,
p199
aV"Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me,
p200
aVwhat is more important than saving your country and saving the world,
p201
aVthat you would go and do?"
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.
p204
aVWe then decided to scale it up.
p205
aVWe went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.
p206
aVAnd Denmark set this beautiful policy;
p207
aVit's called the IQ test.
p208
aVIt's inversely proportional to taxes.
p209
aVThey put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars
p210
aVand zero tax on zero-emission cars.
p211
aVSo if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros.
p212
aVIf you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros.
p213
aVIf you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country.
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VWe then were sort of coined as the guys
p217
aVwho run only in small islands.
p218
aVI know most people don't think of Israel as a small island,
p219
aVbut Israel is an island \u2014 it's a transportation island.
p220
aVIf your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen.
p221
aV(Laughter)
p222
aVIf you're thinking about it in terms of islands,
p223
aVwe decided to go to the biggest island that we could find,
p224
aVand that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia.
p225
aVIt's got three centers \u2014
p226
aVin Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney \u2014
p227
aVand one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them.
p228
aVThe next island
p229
aVwas not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii.
p230
aVWe decided to come into the U.S.
p231
aVand pick the two best places \u2014
p232
aVthe one where you didn't need any range extension.
p233
aVHawaii you can drive around the island on one battery.
p234
aVAnd if you really have a long day you can switch,
p235
aVand keep on driving around the island.
p236
aa(lp237
VThe second one was the San Francisco Bay Area
p238
aVwhere Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors.
p239
aVHe decided that he's going to take over
p240
aVthe state, unofficially, and then officially,
p241
aVand then created this beautiful Region One policy.
p242
aVIn the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have
p243
aVthe highest concentration of Priuses,
p244
aVbut you also have the perfect range extender.
p245
aVIt's called the other car.
p246
aVAs we stared scaling it up
p247
aVwe looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.?
p248
aVWhy is this a big issue?
p249
aVAnd the most fascinating thing we've learned is that,
p250
aVwhen you have small problems on the individual level,
p251
aVlike the price of gasoline to drive every morning.
p252
aVYou don't notice it, but when the aggregate comes up
p253
aVyou're dead. Alright?
p254
aa(lp255
VSo the price of oil, much like
p256
aVlots of other curves that we've seen,
p257
aVgoes along a depletion curve.
p258
aVThe foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.
p259
aVAnd we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.
p260
aVIt becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out.
p261
aVYou think, well it's been up, it's been down,
p262
aVits been up, it's going to keep on going up and down.
p263
aVHere is the problem:
p264
aVat 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago,
p265
aVthe U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.
p266
aVThen we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 \u2014
p267
aVsometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.
p268
aVNow we're running a stimulus package.
p269
aVIt's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.
p270
aVWe're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and 2015,
p271
aVsomewhere in that space.
p272
aVWhat happens when the economy recovers?
p273
aVBy 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars
p274
aVeven at the pace we're going at right now.
p275
aVThat's another 30 percent demand on oil.
p276
aVThat is another 25 million barrels a day.
p277
aVThat's all the U.S. usage today.
p278
aVIn other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.
p279
aVAnd then we do the OPEC stimulus package
p280
aValso known as 200 dollars a barrel.
p281
aVWe take our money and we give it away.
p282
aVYou know what happens at that point?
p283
aVWe go back down. It's going to go up and down.
p284
aVAnd the downs are going to be much longer
p285
aVand the ups are going to be much shorter.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd that's the difference between problems that are additive,
p288
aVlike CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip,
p289
aVand problems that are depletive,
p290
aVin which we lose what we have,
p291
aVwhich oscillate, and they oscillate until
p292
aVwe lose everything we've got.
p293
aVNow we actually looked at what the answer would be.
p294
aVRight? Remember in the campaign: one million
p295
aVhybrid cars by 2015.
p296
aVThat is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.
p297
aVThat is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.
p298
aVThat won't do much difference.
p299
aa(lp300
VWe looked at an MIT study:
p301
aVten million electric cars on the global roads.
p302
aVTen million out of 500 million we will add between now and then.
p303
aVThat is the most pessimistic number you can have.
p304
aVIt's also the most optimistic number
p305
aVbecause it means we will scale this industry
p306
aVfrom 100 thousand cars is 2011,
p307
aVto 10 million cars by 2016 \u2014
p308
aV100 x growth in less than five years.
p309
aVYou have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars.
p310
aVWe have 10 million cars by region.
p311
aVThat's an enormous amount of cars.
p312
aa(lp313
VChina is adding those cars \u2014
p314
aVIndia, Russia, Brazil.
p315
aVWe have all these regions.
p316
aVEurope has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline.
p317
aVThey'll be the first in line to get off
p318
aVbecause their prices are high.
p319
aVChina solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare
p320
aVthat no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.
p321
aVThe Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem
p322
aVbecause most people in India fill two or three gallons every time.
p323
aVFor them to get a battery that goes 120 miles
p324
aVis an extension on range, not a reduction in range.
p325
aVWe're the only ones who don't have the price set right.
p326
aVWe don't have the industry set right.
p327
aVWe don't have any incentive to go and resolve it
p328
aVacross the U.S.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow where is the car industry on that?
p331
aVVery interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.
p332
aVThey basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0
p333
aVwe'll solve everything within the car itself."
p334
aVNo infrastructure, no problem.
p335
aVWe forgot about the entire chain around us.
p336
aVAll this stuff that happens around.
p337
aVWe are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 \u2014
p338
aVa whole new market, a whole new business model.
p339
aVThe business model in which the money that is actually coming in,
p340
aVto drive the car \u2014
p341
aVthe minutes, the miles if you want,
p342
aVthat you are all familiar with \u2014
p343
aVsubsidize the price of the car,
p344
aVjust like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles.
p345
aVAnd some of it will go back to the car maker.
p346
aVSome of it will go back to your own pocket.
p347
aVBut our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars.
p348
aa(lp349
VYou're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills.
p350
aVIn Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark
p351
aVfrom windmills, not from oil.
p352
aVIn Israel, we've asked to put a solar farm
p353
aVin the south of Israel.
p354
aVAnd people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for."
p355
aVAnd we said, "What if we had proven that in the same space
p356
aVwe found oil for the country for the next hundred years?"
p357
aVAnd they said, "We tried. There isn't any."
p358
aVWe said, "No no, but what if we prove it?"
p359
aVAnd they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up,
p360
aVinstead of digging down.
p361
aVThese are perfect matches to one another.
p362
aa(lp363
VNow all you need is about 10 percent
p364
aVof the electricity generated.
p365
aVThink of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.
p366
aVThat's one percent a year.
p367
aVNow when we're looking at solving big problems,
p368
aVwe need to start thinking in two numbers.
p369
aVAnd those are not 20 percent by 2020.
p370
aVThe two numbers are zero \u2014 as in zero footprint or zero oil \u2014
p371
aVand scale it infinity.
p372
aVAnd when we go to COP15 at the end of this year
p373
aVwe can't stop thinking of padding CO2.
p374
aVWe have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries
p375
aVthat are willing to go to this kind of scale.
p376
aa(lp377
VOne car emits four tons.
p378
aVAnd actually 700 and change million cars today
p379
aVemit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.
p380
aVThat's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.
p381
aVCars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.
p382
aVWe have to come and attack this problem
p383
aVwith a focus, with an effort that actually says,
p384
aVwe're going to go to zero before the world ends.
p385
aVI actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.
p386
aVI shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is one of my idols.
p387
aVI told him one of the reasons that
p388
aVhis uncle was remembered
p389
aVis because he said we're going to send a man to the moon,
p390
aVand we'll do it by the end of the decade.
p391
aVWe didn't say we're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon.
p392
aVAnd there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him.
p393
aV(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VHe actually shared with me another story, which is from about 200 years ago.
p396
aV200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain,
p397
aVthere was a long argument
p398
aVover economy versus morality.
p399
aV25 percent \u2014 just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars \u2014
p400
aV25 percent of their energy
p401
aVfor the entire industrial world in the U.K.
p402
aVcame from a source of energy that was immoral:
p403
aVhuman slaves.
p404
aVAnd there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves?
p405
aVAnd what would it do to our economy?
p406
aVAnd people said, "Well we need to take time to do it.
p407
aVLet's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids
p408
aVand keep the slaves.
p409
aVAnd after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery,

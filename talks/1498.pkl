VI'd like to talk about my dad.
p5
aVMy dad has Alzheimer's disease.
p6
aVHe started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago,
p7
aVand he was officially diagnosed in 2005.
p8
aVNow he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating,
p9
aVhe needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is
p10
aVor when it is, and it's been really, really hard.
p11
aVMy dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life,
p12
aVand I've spent the last decade watching him disappear.
p13
aa(lp14
VMy dad's not alone. There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia,
p15
aVand by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million.
p16
aVThat's a lot of people.
p17
aVDementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia,
p18
aVthe big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us.
p19
aVAnd because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things:
p20
aVWe go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me."
p21
aVOr, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia,
p22
aVand it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us.
p23
aVI'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
p24
aa(lp25
VPrevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's.
p26
aVI'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active,
p27
aVthat's what the research says you should do.
p28
aVBut the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you.
p29
aVIf the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
p30
aVThat's what happened with my dad.
p31
aVMy dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVHe got dementia anyway.
p34
aVIf the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
p35
aVEspecially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families.
p36
aVSo I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
p37
aa(lp38
VBased on what I've learned from taking care of my father,
p39
aVand researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation:
p40
aVI'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength,
p41
aVand \u2014 this is the hard one \u2014 I'm trying to become a better person.
p42
aVLet's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.
p43
aVYou can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are.
p44
aVIt's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening.
p45
aVAnd reading is just about impossible.
p46
aVWhen you care for someone with dementia, and you get training,
p47
aVthey train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.
p48
aVWith my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.
p49
aVHe was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like.
p50
aVHe'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes,
p51
aVhe'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.
p52
aVBut it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?
p53
aVI'm my father's daughter. I read, I write, I think about global health a lot.
p54
aVWould they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?
p55
aVWould they give me charts and graphs that I could color?
p56
aVSo I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.
p57
aVI've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.
p58
aVI am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aVAnd I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it.
p63
aVBecause the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do,
p64
aVthe more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore.
p65
aVThey say that people who are engaged in activities are happier,
p66
aVeasier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease.
p67
aVThat all seems like win to me.
p68
aVI want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.
p69
aVA lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms,
p70
aVas well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance,
p71
aVyou get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile.
p72
aVThey get scared to walk around. They get scared to move.
p73
aVSo I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.
p74
aVI'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it,
p75
aVI'll still be able to be mobile.
p76
aVI'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength
p77
aVso that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around.
p78
aa(lp79
VFinally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person.
p80
aVMy dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now.
p81
aVI've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills,
p82
aVbut I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons,
p83
aVhe loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers.
p84
aVAnd that love makes us want to be around him, even now.
p85
aVeven when it's so hard.
p86
aVWhen you take away everything that he ever learned in this world,
p87
aVhis naked heart still shines.
p88
aVI was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving.
p89
aVAnd what I need now is to learn to be like that.
p90
aVI need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive.
p91
aa(lp92
VI don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.
p93
aVWhat I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me.
p94
aVBut if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready.
p95
aVThank you.

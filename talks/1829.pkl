VSo I'm going to talk about trust,
p5
aVand I'm going to start by reminding you
p6
aVof the standard views that people have about trust.
p7
aVI think these are so commonplace,
p8
aVthey've become clichés of our society.
p9
aVAnd I think there are three.
p10
aVOne's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,
p11
aVvery widely believed.
p12
aVThe second is an aim: we should have more trust.
p13
aVAnd the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.
p14
aa(lp15
VI think that the claim, the aim and the task
p16
aVare all misconceived.
p17
aVSo what I'm going to try to tell you today
p18
aVis a different story about a claim, an aim and a task
p19
aVwhich I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
p20
aa(lp21
VFirst the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?
p22
aVAnd if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,
p23
aVI don't know the answer.
p24
aVI'm inclined to think it may have declined
p25
aVin some activities or some institutions
p26
aVand it might have grown in others.
p27
aVI don't have an overview.
p28
aVBut, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,
p29
aVand the opinion polls are supposedly
p30
aVthe source of a belief that trust has declined.
p31
aVWhen you actually look at opinion polls across time,
p32
aVthere's not much evidence for that.
p33
aVThat's to say, the people who were mistrusted
p34
aV20 years ago,
p35
aVprincipally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.
p36
aVAnd the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago
p37
aVare still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.
p38
aVThe rest of us are in between,
p39
aVand by the way, the average person in the street
p40
aVis almost exactly midway.
p41
aVBut is that good evidence?
p42
aVWhat opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.
p43
aVWhat else can they record?
p44
aVSo they're looking at the generic attitudes
p45
aVthat people report when you ask them certain questions.
p46
aVDo you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
p47
aa(lp48
VNow if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?
p49
aVDo you trust fishmongers?
p50
aVDo you trust elementary school teachers?"
p51
aVyou would probably begin by saying, "To do what?"
p52
aVAnd that would be a perfectly sensible response.
p53
aVAnd you might say, when you understood the answer to that,
p54
aV"Well, I trust some of them, but not others."
p55
aVThat's a perfectly rational thing.
p56
aVIn short, in our real lives,
p57
aVwe seek to place trust in a differentiated way.
p58
aVWe don't make an assumption that the level of trust
p59
aVthat we will have in every instance of a certain type
p60
aVof official or office-holder or type of person
p61
aVis going to be uniform.
p62
aVI might, for example, say that I certainly trust
p63
aVa certain elementary school teacher I know
p64
aVto teach the reception class to read,
p65
aVbut in no way to drive the school minibus.
p66
aVI might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.
p67
aVI might trust my most loquacious friend
p68
aVto keep a conversation going
p69
aVbut not \u2014 but perhaps not to keep a secret.
p70
aVSimple.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives
p73
aVof the way that trust is differentiated,
p74
aVwhy do we sort of drop all that intelligence
p75
aVwhen we think about trust more abstractly?
p76
aVI think the polls are very bad guides
p77
aVto the level of trust that actually exists,
p78
aVbecause they try to obliterate the good judgment
p79
aVthat goes into placing trust.
p80
aa(lp81
VSecondly, what about the aim?
p82
aVThe aim is to have more trust.
p83
aVWell frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.
p84
aVIt's not what I would aim at.
p85
aVI would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy
p86
aVbut not in the untrustworthy.
p87
aVIn fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.
p88
aVAnd I think, of those people who, for example,
p89
aVplaced their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,
p90
aVwho then made off with them,
p91
aVand I think of them, and I think, well, yes,
p92
aVtoo much trust.
p93
aVMore trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.
p94
aVIntelligently placed and intelligently refused trust
p95
aVis the proper aim.
p96
aVWell once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,
p97
aVthat means that what matters in the first place
p98
aVis not trust but trustworthiness.
p99
aVIt's judging how trustworthy people are
p100
aVin particular respects.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.
p103
aVAre they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
p104
aVAnd if we find that a person is competent
p105
aVin the relevant matters,
p106
aVand reliable and honest,
p107
aVwe'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,
p108
aVbecause they'll be trustworthy.
p109
aVBut if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.
p110
aVI have friends who are competent and honest,
p111
aVbut I would not trust them to post a letter,
p112
aVbecause they're forgetful.
p113
aVI have friends who are very confident
p114
aVthey can do certain things,
p115
aVbut I realize that they overestimate their own competence.
p116
aVAnd I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends
p117
aVwho are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVIf so, I haven't yet spotted it.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut that's what we're looking for:
p122
aVtrustworthiness before trust.
p123
aVTrust is the response.
p124
aVTrustworthiness is what we have to judge.
p125
aVAnd, of course, it's difficult.
p126
aVAcross the last few decades, we've tried to construct
p127
aVsystems of accountability for all sorts of institutions
p128
aVand professionals and officials and so on
p129
aVthat will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
p130
aVA lot of these systems have the converse effect.
p131
aVThey don't work as they're supposed to.
p132
aVI remember I was talking with a midwife who said,
p133
aV"Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer
p134
aVto do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."
p135
aVAnd all over our public life, our institutional life,
p136
aVwe find that problem,
p137
aVthat the system of accountability
p138
aVthat is meant to secure trustworthiness
p139
aVand evidence of trustworthiness
p140
aVis actually doing the opposite.
p141
aVIt is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,
p142
aVlike midwives, from doing them
p143
aVby requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.
p144
aVYou can all give your own examples there.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo so much for the aim.
p147
aVThe aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,
p148
aVand that is going to be different
p149
aVif we are trying to be trustworthy
p150
aVand communicate our trustworthiness to other people,
p151
aVand if we are trying to judge whether other people
p152
aVor office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.
p153
aVIt's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,
p154
aVattitudes, don't do adequately here.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow thirdly, the task.
p157
aVCalling the task rebuilding trust, I think,
p158
aValso gets things backwards.
p159
aVIt suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
p160
aVWell, we can do that for ourselves.
p161
aVWe can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
p162
aVWe can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
p163
aVBut trust, in the end, is distinctive
p164
aVbecause it's given by other people.
p165
aVYou can't rebuild what other people give you.
p166
aVYou have to give them the basis
p167
aVfor giving you their trust.
p168
aVSo you have to, I think, be trustworthy.
p169
aVAnd that, of course, is because you can't fool
p170
aVall of the people all of the time, usually.
p171
aVBut you also have to provide usable evidence
p172
aVthat you are trustworthy.
p173
aVHow to do it?
p174
aVWell every day, all over the place, it's being done
p175
aVby ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,
p176
aVquite effectively.
p177
aVLet me give you a simple commercial example.
p178
aVThe shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,
p179
aVand they don't ask any questions.
p180
aVThey take them back and give me the money
p181
aVor give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.
p182
aVThat's super. I trust them
p183
aVbecause they have made themselves vulnerable to me.
p184
aVI think there's a big lesson in that.
p185
aVIf you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,
p186
aVthen that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy
p187
aVand you have confidence in what you are saying.
p188
aVSo in the end, I think what we are aiming for
p189
aVis not very difficult to discern.
p190
aVIt is relationships in which people are trustworthy
p191
aVand can judge when and how the other person
p192
aVis trustworthy.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo the moral of all this is,
p195
aVwe need to think much less about trust,
p196
aVlet alone about attitudes of trust
p197
aVdetected or mis-detected by opinion polls,
p198
aVmuch more about being trustworthy,
p199
aVand how you give people adequate, useful
p200
aVand simple evidence that you're trustworthy.
p201
aa(lp202
VThanks.

VTwo years ago, I have to say there was no problem.
p5
aVTwo years ago, I knew exactly  what an icon looked like.
p6
aVIt looks like this.
p7
aVEverybody's icon, but also the default position
p8
aVof a curator of Italian Renaissance  paintings, which I was then.
p9
aVAnd in a way, this is also another default selection.
p10
aVLeonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image
p11
aVof the "Lady with an Ermine."
p12
aVAnd I use that word, soulful, deliberately.
p13
aVOr then there's this, or rather these:
p14
aVthe two versions of Leonardo's "Virgin of the Rocks"
p15
aVthat were about to come together  in London for the very first time.
p16
aVIn the exhibition that I was then in  the absolute throes of organizing.
p17
aVI was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo,
p18
aVand I had been for three years.
p19
aVSo, he was occupying every part of my brain.
p20
aVLeonardo had taught me, during that three years,
p21
aVabout what a picture can do.
p22
aVAbout taking you from your own  material world into a spiritual world.
p23
aVHe said, actually, that he believed  the job of the painter
p24
aVwas to paint everything that was visible  and invisible in the universe.
p25
aVThat's a huge task. And yet,  somehow he achieves it.
p26
aVHe shows us, I think, the human soul.
p27
aVHe shows us the capacity of ourselves
p28
aVto move into a spiritual realm.
p29
aVTo see a vision of the universe that's  more perfect than our own.
p30
aVTo see God's own plan, in some sense.
p31
aVSo this, in a sense, was really  what I believed an icon was.
p32
aa(lp33
VAt about that time, I started talking to Tom Campbell,
p34
aa(lp35
Vdirector here of the Metropolitan Museum,
p36
aVabout what my next move might be.
p37
aVThe move, in fact, back to an earlier life,
p38
aVone I'd begun at the British Museum,
p39
aVback to the world of three dimensions \u2014
p40
aVof sculpture and of decorative arts \u2014
p41
aVto take over the department of European sculpture  and decorative arts, here at the Met.
p42
aVBut it was an incredibly busy time.
p43
aVAll the conversations were done  at very peculiar times of the day \u2014
p44
aVover the phone.
p45
aVIn the end, I accepted the job
p46
aVwithout actually having been here.
p47
aVAgain, I'd been there a couple of years before,
p48
aVbut on that particular visit.
p49
aVSo, it was just before the time that  the Leonardo show was due to open
p50
aVwhen I finally made it back to the Met, to New York,
p51
aVto see my new domain.
p52
aVTo see what European sculpture  and decorative arts looked like,
p53
aVbeyond those Renaissance collections  with which I was so already familiar.
p54
aVAnd I thought, on that very first day,  I better tour the galleries.
p55
aVFifty-seven of these galleries \u2014
p56
aVlike 57 varieties of baked beans, I believe.
p57
aVI walked through and I started in my comfort zone in the Italian Renaissance.
p58
aVAnd then I moved gradually around,
p59
aVfeeling a little lost sometimes.
p60
aVMy head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition
p61
aVthat was about to open, and I came across this.
p62
aVAnd I thought to myself: What the hell have I done?
p63
aVThere was absolutely no connection in my mind
p64
aVat all and, in fact, if there was any emotion going on,
p65
aVit was a kind of repulsion.
p66
aVThis object felt utterly and completely alien.
p67
aVSilly at a level that I hadn't yet  understood silliness to be.
p68
aVAnd then it was made worse \u2014
p69
aVthere were two of them.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVSo, I started thinking about why it was, in fact,
p72
aVthat I disliked this object so much.
p73
aVWhat was the anatomy of my distaste?
p74
aVWell, so much gold, so vulgar.
p75
aVYou know, so nouveau riche, frankly.
p76
aVLeonardo himself had preached  against the use of gold,
p77
aVso it was absolutely anathema at that moment.
p78
aVAnd then there's little pretty sprigs  of flowers everywhere. (Laughter)
p79
aVAnd finally, that pink. That damned pink.
p80
aVIt's such an extraordinarily artificial color.
p81
aVI mean, it's a color that I can't think of  anything that you actually see in nature,
p82
aVthat looks that shade.
p83
aVThe object even has its own tutu. (Laughter)
p84
aVThis little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit
p85
aVthat sits at the bottom of the vase.
p86
aVIt reminded me, in an odd kind of way,
p87
aVof my niece's fifth birthday party.
p88
aVWhere all the little girls would come  either as a princess or a fairy.
p89
aVThere was one who would come as a fairy princess.
p90
aVYou should have seen the looks.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVAnd I realize that this object was in my mind,
p93
aVborn from the same mind, from the same womb,
p94
aVpractically, as Barbie Ballerina. (Laughter)
p95
aVAnd then there's the elephants. (Laughter)
p96
aVThose extraordinary elephants
p97
aVwith their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions
p98
aVand Greta Garbo eyelashes, with  these golden tusks and so on.
p99
aVI realized this was an elephant that had
p100
aVabsolutely nothing to do with a majestic  march across the Serengeti.
p101
aVIt was a Dumbo nightmare. (Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VBut something more profound  was happening as well.
p104
aVThese objects, it seemed to me,
p105
aVwere quintessentially the kind that I  and my liberal left friends in London
p106
aVhad always seen as summing up
p107
aVsomething deplorable about the French aristocracy
p108
aVin the 18th century.
p109
aVThe label had told me that these pieces were made
p110
aVby the Sèvres Manufactory,
p111
aVmade of porcelain in the late 1750s,
p112
aVand designed by a designer called  Jean-Claude Duplessis,
p113
aVactually somebody of extraordinary distinction
p114
aVas I later learned.
p115
aVBut for me, they summed up a kind of,
p116
aVthat sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy
p117
aVin the 18th century.
p118
aVI and my colleagues had always thought
p119
aVthat these objects, in way, summed up the idea of,
p120
aVyou know \u2014 no wonder there was a revolution.
p121
aVOr, indeed, thank God there was a revolution.
p122
aVThere was a sort of idea really, that,
p123
aVif you owned a vase like this,
p124
aVthen there was really only one fate possible.
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VSo, there I was \u2014 in a sort of paroxysm of horror.
p128
aVBut I took the job and I went  on looking at these vases.
p129
aVI sort of had to because they're  on a through route in the Met.
p130
aVSo, almost anywhere I went, there they were.
p131
aVThey had this kind of odd sort of fascination,
p132
aVlike a car accident.
p133
aVWhere I couldn't stop looking.
p134
aVAnd as I did so, I started thinking:
p135
aVWell, what are we actually looking at here?
p136
aVAnd what I started with was understanding this
p137
aVas really a supreme piece of design.
p138
aVIt took me a little time.
p139
aVBut, that tutu for example \u2014
p140
aVactually, this is a piece that  does dance in its own way.
p141
aVIt has an extraordinary lightness
p142
aVand yet, it is also amazing balanced.
p143
aVIt has these kinds of sculptural ingredients.
p144
aVAnd then the play between \u2014
p145
aVactually really quite carefully disposed  color and gilding, and the sculptural surface,
p146
aVis really rather remarkable.
p147
aVAnd then I realized that this piece went into the kiln
p148
aVfour times, at least four times  in order to arrive at this.
p149
aVHow many moments for accident can you think of
p150
aVthat could have happened to this piece?
p151
aVAnd then remember, not just one, but two.
p152
aVSo he's having to arrive at two exactly matched
p153
aVvases of this kind.
p154
aVAnd then this question of uselessness.
p155
aVWell actually, the end of the trunks  were originally candle holders.
p156
aVSo what you would have had  were candles on either side.
p157
aVImagine that effect of candlelight on that surface.
p158
aVOn the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold.
p159
aVIt would have glittered in an interior,
p160
aVa little like a little firework.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd at that point, actually,  a firework went off in my brain.
p163
aVSomebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' \u2014
p164
aVwhich in a sense for me, encapsulated this object \u2014
p165
aVactually comes from the same  root as the word 'fantasy.'
p166
aVAnd that what this object was just as much in a way,
p167
aVin its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting,
p168
aVis a portal to somewhere else.
p169
aVThis is an object of the imagination.
p170
aVIf you think about the mad 18th-century  operas of the time \u2014 set in the Orient.
p171
aVIf you think about divans and perhaps even  opium-induced visions of pink elephants,
p172
aVthen at that point, this object starts to make sense.
p173
aVThis is an object which is all about escapism.
p174
aVIt's about an escapism that happens \u2014
p175
aVthat the aristocracy in France sought
p176
aVvery deliberately
p177
aVto distinguish themselves from ordinary people.
p178
aa(lp179
VIt's not an escapism that
p180
aVwe feel particularly happy with today, however.
p181
aVAnd again, going on thinking about this,
p182
aVI realize that in a way we're all victims
p183
aVof a certain kind of tyranny
p184
aVof the triumph of modernism
p185
aVwhereby form and function in an object
p186
aVhave to follow one another, or are deemed to do so.
p187
aVAnd the extraneous ornament is seen as really,
p188
aVessentially, criminal.
p189
aVIt's a triumph, in a way, of bourgeois values rather than aristocratic ones.
p190
aVAnd that seems fine.
p191
aVExcept for the fact that it becomes a kind of  sequestration of imagination.
p192
aVSo just as in the 20th century, so many people
p193
aVhad the idea that their faith
p194
aVtook place on the Sabbath day,
p195
aVand the rest of their lives \u2014
p196
aVtheir lives of washing machines and orthodontics \u2014
p197
aVtook place on another day.
p198
aVThen, I think we've started doing the same.
p199
aVWe've allowed ourselves to
p200
aVlead our fantasy lives in front of screens.
p201
aVIn the dark of the cinema, with the television in the corner of the room.
p202
aVWe've eliminated, in a sense, that constant
p203
aVof the imagination that these vases  represented in people's lives.
p204
aVSo maybe it's time we got this back a little.
p205
aVI think it's beginning to happen.
p206
aVIn London, for example,
p207
aVwith these extraordinary buildings
p208
aVthat have been appearing over the last few years.
p209
aVRedolent, in a sense, of science fiction,
p210
aVturning London into a kind of fantasy playground.
p211
aVIt's actually amazing to look out of  a high building nowadays there.
p212
aVBut even then, there's a resistance.
p213
aVLondon has called these buildings the  Gherkin, the Shard, the Walkie Talkie \u2014
p214
aVbringing these soaring buildings down to Earth.
p215
aVThere's an idea that we don't want these
p216
aVanxious-making, imaginative journeys  to happen in our daily lives.
p217
aVI feel lucky in a way,
p218
aVI've encountered this object.
p219
aV(Laughter)
p220
aVI found him on the Internet when  I was looking up a reference.
p221
aVAnd there he was.
p222
aVAnd unlike the pink elephant vase,
p223
aVthis was a kind of love at first sight.
p224
aVIn fact, reader, I married him. I bought him.
p225
aVAnd he now adorns my office.
p226
aVHe's a Staffordshire figure made  in the middle of the 19th century.
p227
aVHe represents the actor, Edmund Kean,  playing Shakespeare's Richard III.
p228
aVAnd it's based, actually, on a more  elevated piece of porcelain.
p229
aVSo I loved, on an art historical level,
p230
aVI loved that layered quality that he has.
p231
aVBut more than that, I love him.
p232
aVIn a way that I think would have been impossible
p233
aVwithout the pink Sèvres vase in my Leonardo days.
p234
aVI love his orange and pink breeches.
p235
aVI love the fact that he seems to be going off to war,
p236
aVhaving just finished the washing up. (Laughter)
p237
aVHe seems also to have forgotten his sword.
p238
aVI love his pink little cheeks, his munchkin energy.
p239
aVIn a way, he's become my sort of alter ego.
p240
aVHe's, I hope, a little bit dignified,
p241
aVbut mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter)
p242
aVAnd energetic, I hope, too.
p243
aVI let him into my life because the Sèvres pink elephant vase allowed me to do so.
p244
aVAnd before that Leonardo,
p245
aVI understood that this object could become  part of a journey for me every day,
p246
aVsitting in my office.
p247
aVI really hope that others, all of you,
p248
aVvisiting objects in the museum,
p249
aVand taking them home and  finding them for yourselves,
p250
aVwill allow those objects to flourish  in your imaginative lives.
p251
aVThank you very much.
p252
aV(Applause)

VFor the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy,
p5
aVand it's going to be a bit of a varied talk.
p6
aVI'll try to spin a story about energy,
p7
aVand oil's a convenient starting place.
p8
aVThe talk will be broadly about energy,
p9
aVbut oil's a good place to start.
p10
aVAnd one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff.
p11
aVYou take about eight or so carbon atoms,
p12
aVabout 20 hydrogen atoms,
p13
aVyou put them together in exactly the right way
p14
aVand you get this marvelous liquid:
p15
aVvery energy-dense and very easy to refine
p16
aVinto a number of very useful products and fuels.
p17
aVIt's great stuff.
p18
aVNow, as far as it goes,
p19
aVthere's a lot of oil out there in the world.
p20
aa(lp21
VHere's my little pocket map
p22
aVof where it's all located.
p23
aVA bigger one for you to look at.
p24
aVBut this is it, this is the oil in the world.
p25
aVGeologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.
p26
aVThis is about 100 trillion gallons
p27
aVof crude oil
p28
aVstill to be developed and produced in the world today.
p29
aVNow, that's just one story about oil,
p30
aVand we could end it there and say,
p31
aV"Well, oil's going to last forever
p32
aVbecause, well, there's just a lot of it."
p33
aVBut there's actually more to the story than that.
p34
aVOh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil,
p35
aV1000 meters below where you're all sitting
p36
aVis one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.
p37
aVCome talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.
p40
aVBut what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?
p41
aVHere's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil,
p42
aVand it's been a dominant part of our energy system
p43
aVfor most of those 150 years.
p44
aVNow, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about:
p45
aVFor the last 25 years,
p46
aVoil has been playing less and less of a role
p47
aVin global energy systems.
p48
aVThere was one kind of peak oil in 1985,
p49
aVwhen oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.
p50
aVNow, it's about 35 percent.
p51
aVIt's been declining
p52
aVand I believe it will continue to decline.
p53
aVGasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007
p54
aVand is declining.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo oil is playing a less significant role
p57
aVevery year.
p58
aVAnd so, 25 years ago,
p59
aVthere was a peak oil;
p60
aVjust like, in the 1920s,
p61
aVthere was a peak coal;
p62
aVand a hundred years before that,
p63
aVthere was a peak wood.
p64
aVThis is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems.
p65
aVAnd what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades?
p66
aVWell, a lot of natural gas
p67
aVand a little bit of nuclear, for starters.
p68
aVAnd what goes on in the future?
p69
aVWell, I think out ahead of us a few decades
p70
aVis peak gas,
p71
aVand beyond that,
p72
aVpeak renewables.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, I'll tell you another little, very important
p75
aVstory about this picture.
p76
aVNow, I'm not pretending that energy use in total
p77
aVisn't increasing, it is \u2014
p78
aVthat's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it,
p79
aVwe'll fill in some of the details \u2014
p80
aVbut there's a very important message here:
p81
aVThis is 200 years of history,
p82
aVand for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing
p83
aVour energy system.
p84
aVEnergy systems of the world
p85
aVbecoming progressively \u2014 year on year,
p86
aVdecade on decade, century on century \u2014
p87
aVbecoming less carbon intense.
p88
aVAnd that continues into the future
p89
aVwith the renewables that we're developing today,
p90
aVreaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy
p91
aVby mid century.
p92
aVNow that might be the end of the story \u2014
p93
aVOkay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables \u2014
p94
aVbut I think, actually, there's more to the story than that.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd to tell the next part of the story \u2014
p97
aVand this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.
p98
aVWhat is the future
p99
aVof truly sustainable, carbon-free energy?
p100
aVWell, we have to take a little excursion,
p101
aVand we'll start in central Texas.
p102
aVHere's a piece of limestone.
p103
aVI picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.
p104
aVIt's about 400 million years old.
p105
aVAnd it's just limestone, nothing really special about it.
p106
aVNow, here's a piece of chalk.
p107
aVI picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger.
p108
aVAnd it's different than this limestone, you can see that.
p109
aVYou wouldn't build a building out of this stuff,
p110
aVand you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this.
p111
aVYeah, it's very different \u2014 no, it's not different.
p112
aVIt's not different, it's the same stuff:
p113
aVcalcium carbonate, calcium carbonate.
p114
aVWhat's different is how the molecules are put together.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, if you think that's kind of neat,
p117
aVthe story gets really neat right now.
p118
aVOff the coast of California comes this:
p119
aVIt's an abalone shell.
p120
aVNow, millions of abalone every year
p121
aVmake this shell.
p122
aVOh, by the way, just in case you weren't already guessing,
p123
aVit's calcium carbonate.
p124
aVIt's the same stuff as this
p125
aVand the same stuff as this.
p126
aVBut it's not the same stuff; it's different.
p127
aVIt's thousands of times,
p128
aVmaybe 3,000 times tougher than this.
p129
aVAnd why? Because the lowly abalone
p130
aVis able to lay down
p131
aVthe calcium carbonate crystals in layers,
p132
aVmaking this beautiful, iridescent
p133
aVmother of pearl.
p134
aVVery specialized material
p135
aVthat the abalone self-assembles,
p136
aVmillions of abalone,
p137
aVall the time, every day, every year.
p138
aVThis is pretty incredible stuff.
p139
aVAll the same, what's different?
p140
aVHow the molecules are put together.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow, what does this have to do with energy?
p143
aVHere's a piece of coal.
p144
aVAnd I'll suggest that this coal
p145
aVis about as exciting
p146
aVas this chalk.
p147
aVNow, whether we're talking about fuels
p148
aVor energy carriers,
p149
aVor perhaps novel materials for batteries
p150
aVor fuel cells,
p151
aVnature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet
p152
aVbecause nature didn't need to.
p153
aVNature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell,
p154
aVthe survival of a species didn't depend
p155
aVon building those materials,
p156
aVuntil maybe now when it might just matter.
p157
aVSo, when we think about the future of energy,
p158
aVimagine
p159
aVwhat would it be like
p160
aVif instead of this,
p161
aVwe could build the energy equivalent of this
p162
aVjust by rearranging the molecules differently.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd so that is my story.
p165
aVThe oil will never run out.
p166
aVIt's not because we have a lot of it.
p167
aVIt's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills.
p168
aVIt's because, well,
p169
aVthousands of years ago,
p170
aVpeople invented ideas \u2014
p171
aVthey had ideas, innovations, technology \u2014
p172
aVand the Stone Age ended,
p173
aVnot because we ran out of stones.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVIt's ideas, it's innovation, it's technology
p176
aVthat will end the age of oil, long before we run out of oil.
p177
aa(lp178
VThank you very much.

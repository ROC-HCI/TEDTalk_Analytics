VHi everybody. So my name is Mac.
p5
aVMy job is that I lie to children,
p6
aVbut they're honest lies.
p7
aa(lp8
VI write children's books,
p9
aVand there's a quote from Pablo Picasso,
p10
aV"We all know that Art is not truth.
p11
aVArt is a lie that makes us realize truth
p12
aVor at least the truth that is  given us to understand.
p13
aVThe artist must know the manner whereby
p14
aVto convince others of the  truthfulness of his lies."
p15
aa(lp16
VI first heard this when I was a kid,
p17
aVand I loved it,
p18
aVbut I had no idea what it meant.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VSo I thought, you know what, it's what I'm here
p22
aVto talk to you today about, though,
p23
aVtruth and lies, fiction and reality.
p24
aVSo how could I untangle
p25
aVthis knotted bunch of sentences?
p26
aVAnd I said, I've got PowerPoint. Let's do a Venn diagram.
p27
aV["Truth. Lies."] (Laughter)
p28
aVSo there it is, right there, boom.
p29
aVWe've got truth and lies
p30
aVand then there's this little space,
p31
aVthe edge, in the middle.
p32
aVThat liminal space, that's art.
p33
aVAll right. Venn diagram. (Laughter) (Applause)
p34
aa(lp35
VBut that's actually not very helpful either.
p36
aVThe thing that made me understand
p37
aVthat quote and really kind of what art,
p38
aVat least the art of fiction, was,
p39
aVwas working with kids.
p40
aVI used to be a summer camp counselor.
p41
aVI would do it on my summers off from college,
p42
aVand I loved it.
p43
aVIt was a sports summer camp
p44
aVfor four- to six-year-olds.
p45
aVI was in charge of the four-year-olds,
p46
aVwhich is good, because
p47
aVfour-year-olds can't play  sports, and neither can I.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVI play sports at a four-year-old level,
p50
aVso what would happen is the kids would
p51
aVdribble around some cones, and then got hot,
p52
aVand then they would go sit underneath the tree
p53
aVwhere I was already sitting \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p54
aVand I would just make up stories and tell them to them
p55
aVand I would tell them stories about my life.
p56
aVI would tell them about how, on the weekends,
p57
aVI would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England.
p58
aVAnd soon, other kids
p59
aVwho weren't even in my group of kids,
p60
aVthey would come up to me, and they would say,
p61
aV"You're Mac Barnett, right?
p62
aVYou're the guy who spies for the Queen of England."
p63
aVAnd I had been waiting my whole life for strangers
p64
aVto come up and ask me that question.
p65
aVIn my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women,
p66
aVbut, you know, four-year-olds \u2014
p67
aVyou take what you can get in Berkeley, California.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd I realized that the stories that I was telling
p70
aVwere real in this way that was familiar to me
p71
aVand really exciting.
p72
aVI think the pinnacle of this for  me \u2014 I'll never forget this \u2014
p73
aVthere was this little girl  named Riley. She was tiny,
p74
aVand she used to always take  out her lunch every day
p75
aVand she would throw out her fruit.
p76
aVShe would just take her fruit,
p77
aVher mom packed her a melon every day,
p78
aVand she would just throw it in the ivy
p79
aVand then she would eat fruit snacks
p80
aVand pudding cups, and I was like, "Riley,
p81
aVyou can't do that, you  have to eat the fruit."
p82
aVAnd she was like, "Why?"
p83
aVAnd I was like, "Well, when you throw the fruit in the ivy,
p84
aVpretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons,"
p85
aVwhich is why I think I ended up
p86
aVtelling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children.
p87
aVAnd so Riley was like, "That will never happen.
p88
aVThat's not going to happen."
p89
aVAnd so, on the last day of camp,
p90
aVI got up early and I got a big cantaloupe
p91
aVfrom the grocery store
p92
aVand I hid it in the ivy,
p93
aVand then at lunchtime, I was like,
p94
aV"Riley, why don't you go over there and see what you've done."
p95
aVAnd \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p96
aVshe went trudging through  the ivy, and then her eyes
p97
aVjust got so wide, and she pointed out this melon
p98
aVthat was bigger than her head,
p99
aVand then all the kids ran over  there and rushed around her,
p100
aVand one of the kids was like, "Hey,
p101
aVwhy is there a sticker on this?"
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVAnd I was like, "That is also why I say
p104
aVdo not throw your stickers in the ivy.
p105
aVPut them in the trash can. It ruins nature when you do this."
p106
aVAnd Riley carried that melon around with her all day,
p107
aVand she was so proud.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd Riley knew she didn't  grow a melon in seven days,
p110
aVbut she also knew that she did,
p111
aVand it's a weird place,
p112
aVbut it's not just a place that kids can get to.
p113
aVIt's anything. Art can get us to that place.
p114
aVShe was right in that place in the middle,
p115
aVthat place which you could call art or fiction.
p116
aVI'm going to call it wonder.
p117
aVIt's what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief
p118
aVor poetic faith,
p119
aVfor those moments where a story, no matter how strange,
p120
aVhas some semblance of the truth,
p121
aVand then you're able to believe it.
p122
aVIt's not just kids who can get there.
p123
aVAdults can too, and we get there when we read.
p124
aVIt's why in two days, people will be
p125
aVdescending on Dublin to take the walking tour
p126
aVof Bloomsday and see everything that happened in "Ulysses,"
p127
aVeven though none of that happened.
p128
aVOr people go to London and they visit Baker Street
p129
aVto see Sherlock Holmes' apartment,
p130
aVeven though 221B is just a number that was painted
p131
aVon a building that never  actually had that address.
p132
aVWe know these characters aren't real,
p133
aVbut we have real feelings about them,
p134
aVand we're able to do that.
p135
aVWe know these characters aren't real,
p136
aVand yet we also know that they are.
p137
aa(lp138
VKids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,
p139
aVand that's why I love writing for kids.
p140
aVI think kids are the best audience
p141
aVfor serious literary fiction.
p142
aVWhen I was a kid,
p143
aVI was obsessed with secret door novels,
p144
aVthings like "Narnia,"
p145
aVwhere you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land.
p146
aVAnd I was convinced that secret doors really did exist
p147
aVand I would look for them and try to go through them.
p148
aVI wanted to live and cross over into  that fictional world, which is \u2014
p149
aVI would always just open people's closet doors.  (Laughter)
p150
aVI would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet,
p151
aVand there was not a secret magical land there.
p152
aVThere was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVAnd I was happy to tell her all about it.
p155
aa(lp156
VAfter college, my first job was working
p157
aVbehind one of these secret doors.
p158
aVThis is a place called 826 Valencia.
p159
aVIt's at 826 Valencia Street
p160
aVin the Mission in San Francisco,
p161
aVand when I worked there, there was a publishing company
p162
aVheadquartered there called McSweeney's,
p163
aVa nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia,
p164
aVbut then the front of it
p165
aVwas a strange shop.
p166
aVYou see, this place was zoned retail,
p167
aVand in San Francisco, they were not going to give us a variance,
p168
aVand so the writer who founded it, a writer named Dave Eggers,
p169
aVto come into compliance  with code, he said, "Fine,
p170
aVI'm just going to build a pirate supply store."
p171
aVAnd that's what he did. (Laughter)
p172
aVAnd it's beautiful. It's all wood.
p173
aVThere's drawers you can pull out and get citrus
p174
aVso you don't get scurvy.
p175
aVThey have eyepatches in lots of colors,
p176
aVbecause when it's springtime, pirates want to go wild.
p177
aVYou don't know. Black is boring. Pastel.
p178
aVOr eyes, also in lots of colors,
p179
aVjust glass eyes, depending on how you want
p180
aVto deal with that situation.
p181
aVAnd the store, strangely,
p182
aVpeople came to them and bought things,
p183
aVand they ended up paying the rent
p184
aVfor our tutoring center, which was behind it,
p185
aVbut to me, more important was the fact
p186
aVthat I think the quality of work you do,
p187
aVkids would come and get instruction in writing,
p188
aVand when you have to walk this weird, liminal, fictional space like this to go do your writing,
p189
aVit's going to affect the kind of work that you make.
p190
aVIt's a secret door that you can walk through.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo I ran the 826 in Los Angeles,
p193
aVand it was my job to build the store down there.
p194
aVSo we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart.
p195
aVThat's our motto: "Whenever you are, we're already then."
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aVAnd it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
p198
aVOur friendly staff is ready to help you.
p199
aVThey're from all eras,
p200
aVincluding just the 1980s, that guy on the end,
p201
aVhe's from the very recent past.
p202
aVThere's our Employees of the Month,
p203
aVincluding Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens.
p204
aVSome great people have come up through our ranks.
p205
aVThis is our kind of pharmacy section.
p206
aVWe have some patent medicines,
p207
aVCanopic jars for your organs,
p208
aVcommunist soap that says,
p209
aV"This is your soap for the year." (Laughter)
p210
aVOur slushy machine broke
p211
aVon the opening night and  we didn't know what to do.
p212
aVOur architect was covered in red syrup.
p213
aVIt looked like he had just murdered somebody,
p214
aVwhich it was not out of the question
p215
aVfor this particular architect,
p216
aVand we didn't know what to do.
p217
aVIt was going to be the highlight of our store.
p218
aVSo we just put that sign on it that said,
p219
aV"Out of order. Come back yesterday." (Laughter)
p220
aVAnd that ended up being a better joke than slushies,
p221
aVso we just left it there forever.
p222
aVMammoth Chunks. These things weigh, like, seven pounds each.
p223
aVBarbarian repellent. It's full of salad
p224
aVand potpourri \u2014 things that barbarians hate.
p225
aVDead languages.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVLeeches, nature's tiny doctors.
p228
aVAnd Viking Odorant, which comes in lots of great scents:
p229
aVtoenails, sweat and rotten vegetables, pyre ash.
p230
aVBecause we believe that Axe Body Spray
p231
aVis something that you should only find on the battlefield,
p232
aVnot under your arms. (Laughter)
p233
aVAnd these are robot emotion chips,
p234
aVso robots can feel love or fear.
p235
aVOur biggest seller is Schadenfreude,
p236
aVwhich we did not expect.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVWe did not think that was going to happen.
p239
aVBut there's a nonprofit behind it,
p240
aVand kids go through a door that says "Employees Only"
p241
aVand they end up in this space
p242
aVwhere they do homework and write stories
p243
aVand make films and this is a book release party
p244
aVwhere kids will read.
p245
aVThere's a quarterly that's published
p246
aVwith just writing that's done by the kids
p247
aVwho come every day after school,
p248
aVand we have release parties
p249
aVand they eat cake and read for their parents
p250
aVand drink milk out of champagne glasses.
p251
aVAnd it's a very special space,
p252
aVbecause it's this weird space in the front.
p253
aVThe joke isn't a joke.
p254
aVYou can't find the seams on the fiction,
p255
aVand I love that. It's this little bit of fiction
p256
aVthat's colonized the real world.
p257
aVI see it as kind of a book in three dimensions.
p258
aa(lp259
VThere's a term called metafiction,
p260
aVand that's just stories about stories,
p261
aVand meta's having a moment now.
p262
aVIts last big moment was probably in the 1960s
p263
aVwith novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis,
p264
aVbut it's been around.
p265
aVIt's almost as old as storytelling itself.
p266
aVAnd one metafictive technique
p267
aVis breaking the fourth wall. Right?
p268
aVIt's when an actor will turn to the audience
p269
aVand say, "I am an actor,
p270
aVthese are just rafters."
p271
aVAnd even that supposedly honest moment,
p272
aVI would argue, is in service of the lie,
p273
aVbut it's supposed to foreground the artificiality
p274
aVof the fiction.
p275
aVFor me, I kind of prefer the opposite.
p276
aVIf I'm going to break down the fourth wall,
p277
aVI want fiction to escape
p278
aVand come into the real world.
p279
aVI want a book to be a secret door that opens
p280
aVand lets the stories out into reality.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd so I try to do this in my books.
p283
aVAnd here's just one example.
p284
aVThis is the first book that I ever made.
p285
aVIt's called "Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem."
p286
aVAnd it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet
p287
aVbut it's a punishment
p288
aVand it ruins his life.
p289
aVSo it's delivered overnight by FedUp.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aVAnd he has to take it to school with him.
p292
aVHe lives in San Francisco \u2014
p293
aVvery tough city to own a blue whale in.
p294
aVA lot of hills, real estate is at a premium.
p295
aVThis market's crazy, everybody.
p296
aVBut underneath the jacket is this case,
p297
aVand that's the cover underneath the book, the jacket,
p298
aVand there's an ad
p299
aVthat offers a free 30-day risk-free trial
p300
aVfor a blue whale.
p301
aVAnd you can just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope
p302
aVand we'll send you a whale.
p303
aVAnd kids do write in.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo here's a letter. It says, "Dear people,
p306
aVI bet you 10 bucks you won't send me a blue whale.
p307
aVEliot Gannon (age 6)."
p308
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VSo what Eliot and the other kids
p311
aVwho send these in get back
p312
aVis a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm \u2014
p313
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p314
aVthat says that due to a change in customs laws,
p315
aVtheir whale has been held up in Sognefjord,
p316
aVwhich is a very lovely fjord,
p317
aVand then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord
p318
aVand Norwegian food for  a little while. It digresses.
p319
aV(Laughter)
p320
aVBut it finishes off by saying that
p321
aVyour whale would love to hear from you.
p322
aVHe's got a phone number,
p323
aVand you can call and leave him a message.
p324
aVAnd when you call and leave him a message,
p325
aVyou just, on the outgoing message,
p326
aVit's just whale sounds and then a beep,
p327
aVwhich actually sounds a lot like a whale sound.
p328
aVAnd they get a picture of their whale too.
p329
aVSo this is Randolph,
p330
aVand Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico
p331
aVwho was one of the first kids to ever call in,
p332
aVand I'll play you some of Nico's message.
p333
aVThis is the first message I ever got from Nico.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Audio) Nico: Hello, this is Nico.
p336
aVI am your owner, Randolph. Hello.
p337
aVSo this is the first time I can ever talk to you,
p338
aVand I might talk to you soon another day. Bye.
p339
aa(lp340
VMac Barnett: So Nico called back, like, an hour later.
p341
aV(Laughter)
p342
aVAnd here's another one of Nico's messages.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph, this is Nico.
p345
aVI haven't talked to you for a long time,
p346
aVbut I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday,
p347
aVyeah, Saturday or Sunday,
p348
aVso now I'm calling you again
p349
aVto say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now,
p350
aVand I'm going to probably call you again
p351
aVtomorrow or today,
p352
aVso I'll talk to you later. Bye.
p353
aa(lp354
VMB: So he did, he called back that day again.
p355
aVHe's left over 25 messages for Randolph
p356
aVover four years.
p357
aVYou find out all about him
p358
aVand the grandma that he loves
p359
aVand the grandma that  he likes a little bit less \u2014
p360
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p361
aVand the crossword puzzles that he does,
p362
aVand this is \u2014 I'll play you one  more message from Nico.
p363
aVThis is the Christmas message from Nico.
p364
aa(lp365
V[Beep] (Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph,
p366
aVsorry I haven't talked to you in a long time.
p367
aVIt's just that I've been so busy
p368
aVbecause school started,
p369
aVas you might not know, probably,
p370
aVsince you're a whale, you don't know,
p371
aVand I'm calling you to just say,
p372
aVto wish you a merry Christmas.
p373
aVSo have a nice Christmas,
p374
aVand bye-bye, Randolph. Goodbye.
p375
aVMB: I actually got Nico,
p376
aVI hadn't heard from in 18 months,
p377
aVand he just left a message two days ago.
p378
aVHis voice is completely different,
p379
aVbut he put his babysitter on the phone,
p380
aVand she was very nice to Randolph as well.
p381
aa(lp382
VBut Nico's the best reader I could hope for.
p383
aVI would want anyone I was writing for
p384
aVto be in that place emotionally
p385
aVwith the things that I create.
p386
aVI feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers,
p387
aVand they deserve the best stories we can give them.
p388
aa(lp389
VThank you very much.

VIt's said that to be a poet
p5
aVyou have to go to hell and back.
p6
aa(lp7
VThe first time I visited the prison,
p8
aVI was not surprised by the noise of the padlocks,
p9
aVor the closing doors, or the cell bars,
p10
aVor by any of the things I had imagined.
p11
aa(lp12
VMaybe because the prison is in a quite open space.
p13
aVYou can see the sky.
p14
aVSeagulls fly overhead, and you feel like you're next to the sea,
p15
aVthat you're really close to the beach.
p16
aVBut in fact, the gulls are looking for food in the dump near the prison.
p17
aa(lp18
VI went farther inside and I suddenly saw inmates moving across the corridors.
p19
aVThen it was as if I stepped back and thought
p20
aVthat I could have very well been one of them.
p21
aVIf I had another story, another context, different luck.
p22
aVBecause nobody - nobody - can choose where they're born.
p23
aa(lp24
VIn 2009, I was invited to join a project
p25
aVthat San Martín National University conducted at the Unit 48 penitentiary,
p26
aVto coordinate a writing workshop.
p27
aVThe prison service ceded some land at the end of the prison,
p28
aVwhich is where they constructed the University Center building.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe first time I met with the prisoners,
p31
aVI asked them why they were asking for a writing workshop
p32
aVand they told me they wanted  to put on paper
p33
aVall that they couldn't say and do.
p34
aa(lp35
VRight then I decided that I wanted poetry to enter the prison.
p36
aVSo I said to them why don't we work with poetry,
p37
aVif they knew what poetry was.
p38
aVBut nobody had a clue what poetry really was.
p39
aVThey also suggested to me
p40
aVthat the workshop should be not just for the inmates
p41
aVtaking university classes,  but for all the inmates.
p42
aVAnd so I said that to start this workshop,
p43
aVI needed to find a tool that we all had in common.
p44
aVThat tool was language.
p45
aa(lp46
VWe had language, we had the workshop. We could have poetry.
p47
aVBut what I hadn't considered was that inequality exists in prison, too.
p48
aVMany of the prisoners hadn't even completed grammar school.
p49
aVMany couldn't use cursive, could barely print.
p50
aVThey didn't write fluently, either.
p51
aVSo we started looking for short poems.
p52
aVVery short, but very powerful.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd we started to read, and we'd read one author, then another author,
p55
aVand by reading such short poems, they all began to realize
p56
aVthat what the poetic language did was to break a certain logic,
p57
aVand create another system.
p58
aVBreaking the logic of language also breaks the logic of the system
p59
aVunder which they've learned to respond.
p60
aVSo a new system appeared,
p61
aVnew rules that made them understand very quickly,
p62
aV- very quickly -
p63
aVthat with poetic language
p64
aVthey would be able to say absolutely whatever they wanted.
p65
aa(lp66
VIt's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back.
p67
aVAnd they have plenty of hell. Plenty of hell.
p68
aa(lp69
VOne of them once said: "In prison you never sleep.
p70
aVYou can never sleep in jail. You can never close your eyelids."
p71
aVAnd so, like I\u2019m doing now, I gave them a moment of silence,
p72
aVthen said, \u201cThat's what poetry is, you guys.
p73
aVIt's in this prison universe that you have all around you.
p74
aVEverything you say about how you never sleep,
p75
aVit exudes fear.
p76
aVAll the things that go unwritten \u2014 all of that is poetry."
p77
aa(lp78
VSo we started appropriating that hell;
p79
aVwe plunged ourselves, headfirst, into the seventh circle.
p80
aVAnd in that seventh circle of hell, our very own, beloved circle,
p81
aVthey learned that they could make the walls invisible,
p82
aVthat they could make the windows yell,
p83
aVand that we could hide inside the shadows.
p84
aVWhen the first year of the workshop had ended,
p85
aVwe organized a little closing party,
p86
aVlike you do when a job is done with so much love,
p87
aVand you want to celebrate with a party.
p88
aa(lp89
VWe called family, friends,  the university authorities.
p90
aVThe only thing the inmates had to do was read a poem,
p91
aVand receive their diplomas and applause.
p92
aVThat was our simple party.
p93
aVThe only thing I want to leave you with
p94
aVis the moment in which those men,
p95
aVsome of them just huge when standing next to me,
p96
aVor the young boys - so young, but with an enormous pride,
p97
aVheld their papers and trembled like little kids and sweated,
p98
aVand read their poems with their voices completely broken.
p99
aa(lp100
VThat moment made me think a lot
p101
aVthat for most of them, it was surely the very first time
p102
aVthat someone applauded them for something they had done.
p103
aVIn prison there are things that can't be done.
p104
aVIn prison, you can't dream. In prison, you can't cry.
p105
aVThere are words that are virtually forbidden, like the word "time,"
p106
aVthe word "future," the word "wish".
p107
aVBut we dared to dream, and to dream a lot.
p108
aVWe decided that they were going to write a book.
p109
aVNot only did they write a book, but they also bound it themselves.
p110
aVThat was at the end of 2010.
p111
aVThen, we doubled the bet and wrote another book.
p112
aVAnd we bound that one, too.
p113
aVThat was a short time ago, at the end of last year.
p114
aVWhat I see week after week,
p115
aVis how they're turning into different people;
p116
aVhow they're being transformed.
p117
aVHow words are empowering them with a dignity they had never known,
p118
aVthat they couldn't even imagine.
p119
aVThey had no idea such dignity could come from them.
p120
aa(lp121
VAt the workshop, in that beloved hell we share, we all give something.
p122
aVWe open our hands and hearts and give what we have, what we can.
p123
aVAll of us; all of us equally.
p124
aVAnd so you feel that at least in a small way
p125
aVyou're repairing that huge social fracture
p126
aVwhich makes it so that for many of them,
p127
aVprison is their only destination.
p128
aVI remember a verse by a tremendous poet, a great poet,
p129
aVfrom our Unit 48 workshop, Nicolás Dorado:
p130
aV"I will need an infinite thread to sew up this huge wound."
p131
aa(lp132
VPoetry does that; it sews up the wounds of exclusion.
p133
aVIt opens doors.  Poetry works as a mirror.
p134
aVIt creates a mirror, which is the poem.
p135
aVThey recognize themselves, they look at themselves in the poem
p136
aVand write from who they are, and are from what they write.
p137
aa(lp138
VIn order to write,
p139
aVthey need to appropriate the moment of writing
p140
aVwhich is a moment of extraordinary freedom.
p141
aVThey have to get into their heads, search for that bit of freedom
p142
aVthat can never be taken away when they write
p143
aVand that is also useful to realize that freedom is possible
p144
aVeven inside a prison,
p145
aVand that the only bars we have in our wonderful space
p146
aVis the word "bars,"
p147
aVand that all of us in our hell burn with happiness
p148
aVwhen we light the wick of the word.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Applause)
p151
aa(lp152
VI told you a lot about the prison, a lot about what I experience
p153
aVevery week, and how I enjoy it and transform myself with the inmates.
p154
aVBut you don't know how much I'd like it
p155
aVif you could feel, live, experience, even for a few seconds,
p156
aVwhat I enjoy every week and what makes me who I am.
p157
aV(Applause)
p158
aVMartín Bustamante:  The heart chews tears of time;
p159
aVblinded by that light,
p160
aVit hides the speed of existence
p161
aVwhere the images go rowing by.
p162
aVIt fights; it hangs on.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe heart cracks under sad gazes,
p165
aVrides on storms that spread fire,
p166
aVlifts chests lowered by shame,
p167
aVknows that it's not just reading and going on,
p168
aVit also wishes to see the infinite blue.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe heart sits down to think about things,
p171
aVfights to avoid being ordinary,
p172
aVtries to love without hurting,
p173
aVbreathes the sun, giving courage to itself,
p174
aVsurrenders, travels toward reason.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe heart fights among the swamps,
p177
aVskirts the edge of the underworld,
p178
aVfalls exhausted, but won't give in to what's easy,
p179
aVwhile irregular steps of intoxication
p180
aVwake up,
p181
aVwake the stillness.
p182
aa(lp183
VI'm Martín Bustamante,
p184
aVI'm a prisoner in Unit 48 of San Martín,
p185
aVtoday is my day of temporary release.
p186
aVAnd for me, poetry and literature have changed my life.
p187
aa(lp188
VThank you very much!
p189
aa(lp190
VCristina Domenech: Thank you!

VWell, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.
p5
aVI started with that sentence about 12 years ago,
p6
aVand I started in the context
p7
aVof developing countries,
p8
aVbut you're sitting here from every corner of the world.
p9
aVSo if you think of a map of your country,
p10
aVI think you'll realize
p11
aVthat for every country on Earth,
p12
aVyou could draw little circles to say,
p13
aV"These are places where good teachers won't go."
p14
aVOn top of that,
p15
aVthose are the places from where trouble comes.
p16
aVSo we have an ironic problem \u2014
p17
aVgood teachers don't want to go
p18
aVto just those places where they're needed the most.
p19
aa(lp20
VI started in 1999
p21
aVto try and address this problem with an experiment,
p22
aVwhich was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.
p23
aVI basically embedded a computer
p24
aVinto a wall of a slum in New Delhi.
p25
aVThe children barely went to school, they didn't know any English \u2014
p26
aVthey'd never seen a computer before,
p27
aVand they didn't know what the internet was.
p28
aVI connected high speed internet to it \u2014 it's about three feet off the ground \u2014
p29
aVturned it on and left it there.
p30
aVAfter this,
p31
aVwe noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.
p32
aVBut I repeated this all over India
p33
aVand then through
p34
aVa large part of the world
p35
aVand noticed
p36
aVthat children will learn to do
p37
aVwhat they want to learn to do.
p38
aa(lp39
VThis is the first experiment that we did \u2014
p40
aVeight year-old boy on your right
p41
aVteaching his student, a six year-old girl,
p42
aVand he was teaching her how to browse.
p43
aVThis boy here in the middle of central India \u2014
p44
aVthis is in a Rajasthan village,
p45
aVwhere the children recorded their own music
p46
aVand then played it back to each other
p47
aVand in the process,
p48
aVthey've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
p49
aVThey did all of this in four hours
p50
aVafter seeing the computer for the first time.
p51
aVIn another South Indian village,
p52
aVthese boys here
p53
aVhad assembled a video camera
p54
aVand were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.
p55
aVThey downloaded it from Disney.com,
p56
aVor one of these websites,
p57
aV14 days after putting the computer in their village.
p58
aVSo at the end of it,
p59
aVwe concluded that groups of children
p60
aVcan learn to use computers and the internet on their own,
p61
aVirrespective of who
p62
aVor where they were.
p63
aa(lp64
VAt that point, I became a little more ambitious
p65
aVand decided to see
p66
aVwhat else could children do with a computer.
p67
aVWe started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India,
p68
aVwhere I gave a group of children \u2014
p69
aVthey spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.
p70
aVI gave them a computer
p71
aVwith a speech-to-text interface,
p72
aVwhich you now get free with Windows,
p73
aVand asked them to speak into it.
p74
aVSo when they spoke into it,
p75
aVthe computer typed out gibberish,
p76
aVso they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying."
p77
aVSo I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.
p78
aVMake yourself understood
p79
aVto the computer."
p80
aVSo the children said, "How do we do that."
p81
aVAnd I said,
p82
aV"I don't know, actually."
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd I left.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVTwo months later \u2014
p87
aVand this is now documented
p88
aVin the Information Technology
p89
aVfor International Development journal \u2014
p90
aVthat accents had changed
p91
aVand were remarkably close to the neutral British accent
p92
aVin which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.
p93
aVIn other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aVSo they could do that on their own.
p96
aVAfter that, I started to experiment
p97
aVwith various other things
p98
aVthat they might learn to do on their own.
p99
aa(lp100
VI got an interesting phone call once from Columbo,
p101
aVfrom the late Arthur C. Clarke,
p102
aVwho said, "I want to see what's going on."
p103
aVAnd he couldn't travel, so I went over there.
p104
aVHe said two interesting things,
p105
aV"A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be."
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVThe second thing he said was that,
p108
aV"If children have interest,
p109
aVthen education happens."
p110
aVAnd I was doing that in the field,
p111
aVso every time I would watch it and think of him.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely
p114
aVhelp people,
p115
aVbecause children quickly learn to navigate
p116
aVthe web and find things which interest them.
p117
aVAnd when you've got interest, then you have education.
p118
aa(lp119
VSugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa.
p120
aVThis is a 15 year-old boy.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Video) Boy: ... just mention, I play games
p123
aVlike animals,
p124
aVand I listen to music.
p125
aa(lp126
VSM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?"
p127
aVAnd he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean."
p128
aVThis is in Cambodia,
p129
aVrural Cambodia \u2014
p130
aVa fairly silly arithmetic game,
p131
aVwhich no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
p132
aVThey would, you know, throw it back at you.
p133
aVThey'd say, "This is very boring."
p134
aVIf you leave it on the pavement
p135
aVand if all the adults go away,
p136
aVthen they will show off with each other
p137
aVabout what they can do.
p138
aVThis is what these children are doing.
p139
aVThey are trying to multiply, I think.
p140
aVAnd all over India,
p141
aVat the end of about two years,
p142
aVchildren were beginning to Google their homework.
p143
aVAs a result, the teachers reported
p144
aVtremendous improvements in their English \u2014
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVrapid improvement and all sorts of things.
p147
aVThey said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aVAnd indeed they had.
p150
aVI mean, if there's stuff on Google,
p151
aVwhy would you need to stuff it into your head?
p152
aVSo at the end of the next four years,
p153
aVI decided that groups of children can navigate the internet
p154
aVto achieve educational objectives on their own.
p155
aa(lp156
VAt that time, a large amount of money
p157
aVhad come into Newcastle University
p158
aVto improve schooling in India.
p159
aVSo Newcastle gave me a call. I said, "I'll do it from Delhi."
p160
aVThey said, "There's no way you're going to handle
p161
aVa million pounds-worth of University money
p162
aVsitting in Delhi."
p163
aVSo in 2006,
p164
aVI bought myself a heavy overcoat
p165
aVand moved to Newcastle.
p166
aVI wanted to test the limits
p167
aVof the system.
p168
aVThe first experiment I did out of Newcastle
p169
aVwas actually done in India.
p170
aVAnd I set myself and impossible target:
p171
aVcan Tamil speaking
p172
aV12-year-old children
p173
aVin a South Indian village
p174
aVteach themselves biotechnology
p175
aVin English on their own?
p176
aVAnd I thought, I'll test them, they'll get a zero \u2014
p177
aVI'll give the materials, I'll come back and test them \u2014
p178
aVthey get another zero,
p179
aVI'll go back and say, "Yes, we need teachers for certain things."
p180
aa(lp181
VI called in 26 children.
p182
aVThey all came in there, and I told them
p183
aVthat there's some really difficult stuff on this computer.
p184
aVI wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything.
p185
aVIt's all in English, and I'm going.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVSo I left them with it.
p188
aVI came back after two months,
p189
aVand the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.
p190
aVI said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?"
p191
aVThey said, "Yes, we did."
p192
aV"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing."
p193
aVSo I said,
p194
aV"Well, how long did you practice on it
p195
aVbefore you decided you understood nothing?"
p196
aVThey said, "We look at it every day."
p197
aVSo I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?"
p198
aVSo a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says,
p199
aVliterally,
p200
aV"Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule
p201
aVcauses genetic disease,
p202
aVwe've understood nothing else."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
V(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VIt took me three years to publish that.
p211
aVIt's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology.
p212
aVOne of the referees who refereed the paper said,
p213
aV"It's too good to be true,"
p214
aVwhich was not very nice.
p215
aVWell, one of the girls had taught herself
p216
aVto become the teacher.
p217
aVAnd then that's her over there.
p218
aVRemember, they don't study English.
p219
aVI edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"
p220
aVand she says, "The neuron? The neuron,"
p221
aVand then she looked and did this.
p222
aVWhatever the expression, it was not very nice.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent,
p225
aVwhich is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.
p226
aVBut 30 percent is not a pass.
p227
aVSo I found that they had a friend,
p228
aVa local accountant, a young girl,
p229
aVand they played football with her.
p230
aVI asked that girl, "Would you teach them
p231
aVenough biotechnology to pass?"
p232
aVAnd she said, "How would I do that? I don't know the subject."
p233
aVI said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."
p234
aVShe said, "What's that?"
p235
aVI said, "Well, what you've got to do
p236
aVis stand behind them
p237
aVand admire them all the time.
p238
aVJust say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic.
p239
aVWhat is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?'"
p240
aVShe did that for two months.
p241
aVThe scores went up to 50,
p242
aVwhich is what the posh schools of New Delhi,
p243
aVwith a trained biotechnology teacher were getting.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo I came back to Newcastle
p246
aVwith these results
p247
aVand decided
p248
aVthat there was something happening here
p249
aVthat definitely was getting very serious.
p250
aVSo, having experimented in all sorts of remote places,
p251
aVI came to the most remote place that I could think of.
p252
aV(Laughter)
p253
aVApproximately 5,000 miles from Delhi
p254
aVis the little town of Gateshead.
p255
aVIn Gateshead, I took 32 children
p256
aVand I started to fine-tune the method.
p257
aVI made them into groups of four.
p258
aVI said, "You make your own groups of four.
p259
aVEach group of four can use one computer and not four computers."
p260
aVRemember, from the Hole in the Wall.
p261
aV"You can exchange groups.
p262
aVYou can walk across to another group,
p263
aVif you don't like your group, etc.
p264
aVYou can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing,
p265
aVcome back to you own group and claim it as your own work."
p266
aVAnd I explained to them
p267
aVthat, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
V(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VThe children enthusiastically got after me and said,
p274
aV"Now, what do you want us to do?"
p275
aVI gave them six GCSE questions.
p276
aVThe first group \u2014 the best one \u2014
p277
aVsolved everything in 20 minutes.
p278
aVThe worst, in 45.
p279
aVThey used everything that they knew \u2014
p280
aVnews groups, Google, Wikipedia,
p281
aVAsk Jeeves, etc.
p282
aVThe teachers said, "Is this deep learning?"
p283
aVI said, "Well, let's try it.
p284
aVI'll come back after two months.
p285
aVWe'll give them a paper test \u2014
p286
aVno computers, no talking to each other, etc."
p287
aVThe average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups
p288
aVwas 76 percent.
p289
aVWhen I did the experiment, when I did the test,
p290
aVafter two months, the score
p291
aVwas 76 percent.
p292
aVThere was photographic recall
p293
aVinside the children,
p294
aVI suspect because they're discussing with each other.
p295
aVA single child in front of a single computer
p296
aVwill not do that.
p297
aVI have further results,
p298
aVwhich are almost unbelievable,
p299
aVof scores which go up with time.
p300
aVBecause their teachers say
p301
aVthat after the session is over,
p302
aVthe children continue to Google further.
p303
aa(lp304
VHere in Britain, I put out a call
p305
aVfor British grandmothers,
p306
aVafter my Kuppam experiment.
p307
aVWell, you know,
p308
aVthey're very vigorous people, British grandmothers.
p309
aV200 of them volunteered immediately.
p310
aV(Laughter)
p311
aVThe deal was that they would give me
p312
aVone hour of broadband time,
p313
aVsitting in their homes,
p314
aVone day in a week.
p315
aVSo they did that,
p316
aVand over the last two years,
p317
aVover 600 hours of instruction
p318
aVhas happened over Skype,
p319
aVusing what my students call the granny cloud.
p320
aVThe granny cloud sits over there.
p321
aVI can beam them to whichever school I want to.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Video) Teacher: You can't catch me.
p324
aVYou say it.
p325
aVYou can't catch me.
p326
aa(lp327
VChildren: You can't catch me.
p328
aa(lp329
VTeacher: I'm the gingerbread man.
p330
aa(lp331
VChildren: I'm the gingerbread man.
p332
aa(lp333
VTeacher: Well done. Very good ...
p334
aa(lp335
VSM: Back at Gateshead,
p336
aVa 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism
p337
aVin 15 minutes.
p338
aVYou know, stuff which I don't know anything about.
p339
aVTwo children watch a TEDTalk.
p340
aVThey wanted to be footballers before.
p341
aVAfter watching eight TEDTalks,
p342
aVhe wants to become Leonardo da Vinci.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
V(Applause)
p347
aa(lp348
VIt's pretty simple stuff.
p349
aa(lp350
VThis is what I'm building now \u2014
p351
aVthey're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.
p352
aVThe furniture is designed
p353
aVso that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens,
p354
aVbig broadband connections, but in groups.
p355
aVIf they want, they can call the granny cloud.
p356
aVThis is a SOLE in Newcastle.
p357
aVThe mediator is from Pune, India.
p358
aa(lp359
VSo how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop.
p360
aVI went to Turin in May.
p361
aVI sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.
p362
aVI speak only English, they speak only Italian,
p363
aVso we had no way to communicate.
p364
aVI started writing English questions on the blackboard.
p365
aVThe children looked at it and said, "What?"
p366
aVI said, "Well, do it."
p367
aVThey typed it into Google, translated it into Italian,
p368
aVwent back into Italian Google.
p369
aVFifteen minutes later \u2014
p370
aVnext question: where is Calcutta?
p371
aVThis one, they took only 10 minutes.
p372
aVI tried a really hard one then.
p373
aVWho was Pythagoras, and what did he do?
p374
aVThere was silence for a while,
p375
aVthen they said, "You've spelled it wrong.
p376
aVIt's Pitagora."
p377
aVAnd then,
p378
aVin 20 minutes,
p379
aVthe right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.
p380
aVThis sent shivers up my spine.
p381
aVThese are 10 year-olds.
p382
aVText: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then?
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
V(Applause)
p387
aa(lp388
VSM: So you know what's happened?
p389
aVI think we've just stumbled across
p390
aVa self-organizing system.
p391
aVA self-organizing system is one
p392
aVwhere a structure appears
p393
aVwithout explicit intervention from the outside.
p394
aVSelf-organizing systems also always show emergence,
p395
aVwhich is that the system starts to do things,
p396
aVwhich it was never designed for.
p397
aVWhich is why you react the way you do,
p398
aVbecause it looks impossible.
p399
aVI think I can make a guess now \u2014
p400
aVeducation is self-organizing system,
p401
aVwhere learning is an emergent phenomenon.
p402
aVIt'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally,
p403
aVbut I'm going to try.
p404
aVBut in the meanwhile, there is a method available.
p405
aVOne billion children, we need 100 million mediators \u2014
p406
aVthere are many more than that on the planet \u2014
p407
aV10 million SOLEs,
p408
aV180 billion dollars and 10 years.
p409
aVWe could change everything.
p410
aa(lp411
VThanks.

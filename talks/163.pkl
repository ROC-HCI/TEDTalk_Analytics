VImages like this, from the Auschwitz concentration camp,
p5
aVhave been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century
p6
aVand have given us a new understanding of who we are,
p7
aVwhere we've come from and the times we live in.
p8
aVDuring the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities
p9
aVof Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides,
p10
aVand even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old,
p11
aVwe have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur
p12
aVand the daily horrors of Iraq.
p13
aVThis has led to a common understanding of our situation,
p14
aVnamely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps
p15
aVthat native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril.
p16
aa(lp17
VHere is an example
p18
aVfrom an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe
p19
aVa couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life
p20
aVwas a difficult one, but there were no employment problems,
p21
aVcommunity harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown,
p22
aVcrime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes
p23
aVwas largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate
p24
aVor wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle.
p25
aVWe teach it to our children. We hear it on television
p26
aVand in storybooks. Now, the original title of this session
p27
aVwas, "Everything You Know Is Wrong," and I'm going to present evidence
p28
aVthat this particular part of our common understanding is wrong,
p29
aVthat, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are,
p30
aVthat violence has been in decline for long stretches of time,
p31
aVand that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, in the decade of Darfur and Iraq,
p34
aVa statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory
p35
aVand obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you
p36
aVthat that is the correct picture. The decline of violence
p37
aVis a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia,
p38
aVover centuries, over decades and over years,
p39
aValthough there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset
p40
aVof the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it
p41
aVall over the world, although not homogeneously.
p42
aVIt's especially evident in the West, beginning with England
p43
aVand Holland around the time of the Enlightenment.
p44
aa(lp45
VLet me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 \u2014
p46
aVfrom the millennium scale to the year scale \u2014
p47
aVto try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans
p48
aVlived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements
p49
aVor government. And this is the state that's commonly thought
p50
aVto be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist
p51
aVLawrence Keeley, looking at casualty rates
p52
aVamong contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best source
p53
aVof evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion.
p54
aa(lp55
VHere is a graph that he put together
p56
aVshowing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare
p57
aVin a number of foraging, or hunting and gathering societies.
p58
aVThe red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die
p59
aVat the hands of another man, as opposed to passing away
p60
aVof natural causes, in a variety of foraging societies
p61
aVin the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest.
p62
aVAnd they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die
p63
aVat the hands of another man to, in the case of the Gebusi,
p64
aVonly a 15 percent chance. The tiny, little blue bar in the lower
p65
aVleft-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States
p66
aVand Europe in the twentieth century, and includes all the deaths
p67
aVof both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed
p68
aVduring the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million.
p69
aa(lp70
VAlso at the millennium scale, we can look
p71
aVat the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described
p72
aVin the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values,
p73
aVone can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare,
p74
aVsuch as the following from Numbers 31: "And they warred
p75
aVagainst the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses,
p76
aVand they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them,
p77
aV'Have you saved all the women alive? Now, therefore, kill every male
p78
aVamong the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man
p79
aVby lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a man
p80
aVby lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'" In other words,
p81
aVkill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins,
p82
aVthen you can keep them alive so that you can rape them.
p83
aVYou can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk.
p84
aVAlso in the Bible, one sees that the death penalty
p85
aVwas the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality,
p86
aVadultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents \u2014
p87
aV(Laughter) \u2014 and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.
p88
aVWell, let's click the zoom lens
p89
aVdown one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.
p90
aVAlthough we don't have statistics for warfare throughout
p91
aVthe Middle Ages to modern times,
p92
aVwe know just from conventional history \u2014 the evidence
p93
aVwas under our nose all along that there has been a reduction
p94
aVin socially sanctioned forms of violence.
p95
aa(lp96
VFor example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture
p97
aVwere routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction
p98
aVtoday that would give you a fine, in those days would result in
p99
aVyour tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded,
p100
aVa hand being chopped off and so on.
p101
aVThere were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment:
p102
aVburning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel,
p103
aVbeing pulled apart by horses and so on.
p104
aVThe death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes:
p105
aVcriticizing the king, stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery, of course,
p106
aVwas the preferred labor-saving device, and cruelty was
p107
aVa popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example
p108
aVwas the practice of cat burning, in which a cat was hoisted
p109
aVon a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire,
p110
aVand the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat, howling in pain,
p111
aVwas burned to death.
p112
aa(lp113
VWhat about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics,
p114
aVbecause many municipalities recorded the cause of death.
p115
aVThe criminologist Manuel Eisner
p116
aVscoured all of the historical records across Europe
p117
aVfor homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, county
p118
aVthat he could find, and he supplemented them
p119
aVwith national data, when nations started keeping statistics.
p120
aVHe plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deaths
p121
aVper 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rate
p122
aVof homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down
p123
aVto less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year
p124
aVin seven or eight European countries. Then, there is a slight uptick
p125
aVin the 1960s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead
p126
aVto the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that.
p127
aVBut there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude
p128
aVin homicide from the Middle Ages to the present,
p129
aVand the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century.
p130
aa(lp131
VLet's click down now to the decade scale.
p132
aVAccording to non-governmental organizations
p133
aVthat keep such statistics, since 1945, in Europe and the Americas,
p134
aVthere has been a steep decline in interstate wars,
p135
aVin deadly ethnic riots or pogroms, and in military coups,
p136
aVeven in South America. Worldwide, there's been a steep decline
p137
aVin deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number
p138
aVof deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present.
p139
aVAnd, as you can see, the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths
p140
aVper conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths
p141
aVper conflict per year in this decade, as horrific as it is.
p142
aVEven in the year scale, one can see a decline of violence.
p143
aVSince the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars,
p144
aVfewer genocides \u2014 indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs \u2014
p145
aVand even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.
p146
aVThis is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see
p147
aVthat there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,
p148
aVthen it soared upward for several decades, and began
p149
aVa precipitous decline, starting in the 1990s, so that it went back
p150
aVto the level that was last enjoyed in 1960.
p151
aVPresident Clinton, if you're here, thank you.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VSo the question is, why are so many people so wrong
p155
aVabout something so important? I think there are a number of reasons.
p156
aVOne of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press
p157
aVis a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth
p158
aVthan sixteenth-century monks were.
p159
aVThere's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is
p160
aVto recall specific instances of something,
p161
aVthe higher the probability that you assign to it.
p162
aVThings that we read about in the paper with gory footage
p163
aVburn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying
p164
aVin their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion
p165
aVand advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers, advocates
p166
aVand donors by saying
p167
aVthings just seem to be getting better and better.
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VThere's guilt about our treatment of native peoples
p171
aVin modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledge
p172
aVthere could be anything good about Western culture.
p173
aVAnd of course, our change in standards can outpace the change
p174
aVin behavior. One of the reasons violence went down
p175
aVis that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time.
p176
aVThat's a process that seems to be continuing,
p177
aVbut if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day,
p178
aVthings always look more barbaric than they would have been
p179
aVby historic standards. So today, we get exercised \u2014 and rightly so \u2014
p180
aVif a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection
p181
aVin Texas after a 15-year appeal process. We don't consider
p182
aVthat a couple of hundred years ago, they may have been burned
p183
aVat the stake for criticizing the king after a trial
p184
aVthat lasted 10 minutes, and indeed, that that would have been repeated
p185
aVover and over again. Today, we look at capital punishment
p186
aVas evidence of how low our behavior can sink,
p187
aVrather than how high our standards have risen.
p188
aa(lp189
VWell, why has violence declined? No one really knows,
p190
aVbut I have read four explanations, all of which, I think,
p191
aVhave some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybe
p192
aVThomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said
p193
aVthat life in a state of nature was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish
p194
aVand short." Not because, he argued,
p195
aVhumans have some primordial thirst for blood
p196
aVor aggressive instinct or territorial imperative,
p197
aVbut because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy,
p198
aVthere's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively,
p199
aVbefore they invade you. More recently, Thomas Schelling
p200
aVgives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling
p201
aVin the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistol
p202
aVin the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs.
p203
aVAnd what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand.
p204
aVNow, each one of them is thinking,
p205
aV"I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me.
p206
aVMaybe I had better shoot him, before he shoots me,
p207
aVespecially since, even if he doesn't want to kill me,
p208
aVhe's probably worrying right now that I might kill him
p209
aVbefore he kills me." And so on.
p210
aVHunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought,
p211
aVand will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.
p214
aVYou don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy
p215
aVthat you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded.
p216
aVThe only thing is that it's
p217
aVliable to having its bluff called, and therefore can only work
p218
aVif it's credible. To make it credible, you must avenge all insults
p219
aVand settle all scores, which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta.
p220
aVLife becomes an episode of "The Sopranos." Hobbes' solution,
p221
aVthe "Leviathan," was that if authority for the legitimate use
p222
aVof violence was vested in a single democratic agency \u2014 a leviathan \u2014
p223
aVthen such a state can reduce the temptation of attack,
p224
aVbecause any kind of aggression will be punished,
p225
aVleaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation
p226
aVto invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first.
p227
aVIt removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation
p228
aVto make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore, it would lead
p229
aVto a state of peace. Eisner \u2014 the man who plotted the homicide rates
p230
aVthat you failed to see in the earlier slide \u2014
p231
aVargued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe
p232
aVcoincided with the rise of centralized states.
p233
aVSo that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.
p234
aVAlso supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence
p235
aVin zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires,
p236
aVfrontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on.
p237
aa(lp238
VThe second explanation is that in many times and places,
p239
aVthere is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.
p240
aVIn earlier times, when suffering and early death were common
p241
aVin one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them
p242
aVon others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life
p243
aVlonger and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general.
p244
aVThis was an argument from the political scientist James Payne.
p245
aa(lp246
VA third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game,
p247
aVand was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalist
p248
aVRobert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances,
p249
aVcooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties
p250
aVin an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade
p251
aVtheir surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties
p252
aVlay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend
p253
aVthat results in them not having to fight the whole time.
p254
aVWright argues that technology has increased the number
p255
aVof positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in,
p256
aVby allowing the trade of goods, services and ideas
p257
aVover longer distances and among larger groups of people.
p258
aVThe result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead,
p259
aVand violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it,
p260
aV"Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb
p261
aVthe Japanese is that they built my mini-van."
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VThe fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book
p265
aVcalled "The Expanding Circle," by the philosopher Peter Singer,
p266
aVwho argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense
p267
aVof empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interests
p268
aVas comparable to one's own. Unfortunately, by default
p269
aVwe apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family.
p270
aVPeople outside that circle are treated as sub-human,
p271
aVand can be exploited with impunity. But, over history,
p272
aVthe circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record,
p273
aVit expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe,
p274
aVto the nation, to other races, to both sexes,
p275
aVand, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extend
p276
aVto other sentient species. The question is,
p277
aVif this has happened, what has powered that expansion?
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles
p280
aVof reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.
p281
aVThe logic of the golden rule \u2014 the more you think about and interact
p282
aVwith other people, the more you realize that it is untenable
p283
aVto privilege your interests over theirs,
p284
aVat least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say
p285
aVthat my interests are special compared to yours,
p286
aVanymore than you can say that the particular spot
p287
aVthat I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe
p288
aVbecause I happen to be standing on it that very minute.
p289
aVIt may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories,
p290
aVand journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel,
p291
aVand literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the lives
p292
aVof other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human,
p293
aVand also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station
p294
aVin life, the sense that "there but for fortune go I."
p295
aa(lp296
VWhatever its causes, the decline of violence, I think,
p297
aVhas profound implications. It should force us to ask not just, why
p298
aVis there war? But also, why is there peace? Not just,
p299
aVwhat are we doing wrong? But also, what have we been doing right?
p300
aVBecause we have been doing something right,
p301
aVand it sure would be good to find out what it is.
p302
aVThank you very much.
p303
aV(Applause).
p304
aa(lp305
VChris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say
p306
aVthat that expansion of \u2014 that you were talking about,
p307
aVthat Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology,
p308
aVby greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world
p309
aVis therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth?
p310
aa(lp311
VSteven Pinker: Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory,
p312
aVthat it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation
p313
aVover larger and larger circles. But also, I think it helps us
p314
aVimagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read
p315
aVthese horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages, you think,
p316
aVhow could they possibly have done it,
p317
aVhow could they have not have empathized with the person
p318
aVthat they're disemboweling? But clearly,
p319
aVas far as they're concerned, this is just an alien being
p320
aVthat does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think,
p321
aVthat makes it easier to imagine trading places
p322
aVwith someone else means that it increases your moral consideration
p323
aVto that other person.
p324
aa(lp325
VCA: Well, Steve, I would love every news media owner to hear that talk
p326
aVat some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much.
p327
aa(lp328
VSP: My pleasure.

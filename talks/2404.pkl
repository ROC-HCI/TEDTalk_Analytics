VOur grandparents' generation created an amazing system
p5
aVof canals and reservoirs that made it possible
p6
aVfor people to live in places where there wasn't a lot of water.
p7
aVFor example, during the Great Depression,
p8
aVthey created the Hoover Dam,
p9
aVwhich in turn, created Lake Mead
p10
aVand made it possible for the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix
p11
aVand Los Angeles to provide water
p12
aVfor people who lived in a really dry place.
p13
aa(lp14
VIn the 20th century, we literally spent trillions of dollars
p15
aVbuilding infrastructure to get water to our cities.
p16
aVIn terms of economic development, it was a great investment.
p17
aVBut in the last decade, we've seen the combined effects
p18
aVof climate change, population growth and competition for water resources
p19
aVthreaten these vital lifelines and water resources.
p20
aa(lp21
VThis figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead
p22
aVthat happened in the last 15 years.
p23
aVYou can see starting around the year 2000,
p24
aVthe lake level started to drop.
p25
aVAnd it was dropping at such a rate
p26
aVthat it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.
p27
aVThe city became so concerned about this
p28
aVthat they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure
p29
aVthat they referred to as the "Third Straw"
p30
aVto pull water out of the greater depths of the lake.
p31
aa(lp32
VThe challenges associated with providing water to a modern city
p33
aVare not restricted to the American Southwest.
p34
aVIn the year 2007, the third largest city in Australia, Brisbane,
p35
aVcame within 6 months of running out of water.
p36
aVA similar drama is playing out today in São Paulo, Brazil,
p37
aVwhere the main reservoir for the city
p38
aVhas gone from being completely full in 2010,
p39
aVto being nearly empty today
p40
aVas the city approaches the 2016 Summer Olympics.
p41
aa(lp42
VFor those of us who are fortunate enough
p43
aVto live in one of the world's great cities,
p44
aVwe've never truly experienced the effects of a catastrophic drought.
p45
aVWe like to complain about the navy showers we have to take.
p46
aVWe like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns.
p47
aVBut we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap
p48
aVand having nothing come out.
p49
aVAnd that's because when things have gotten bad in the past,
p50
aVit's always been possible to expand a reservoir
p51
aVor dig a few more groundwater wells.
p52
aVWell, in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for,
p53
aVit's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way
p54
aVof providing ourselves with water.
p55
aa(lp56
VSome people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem
p57
aVby taking water from our rural neighbors.
p58
aVBut that's an approach that's fraught with political, legal and social dangers.
p59
aVAnd even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors,
p60
aVwe're just transferring the problem to someone else
p61
aVand there's a good chance it will come back and bite us
p62
aVin the form of higher food prices
p63
aVand damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water.
p64
aa(lp65
VI think that there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis
p66
aVand I think that's to open up four new local sources of water
p67
aVthat I liken to faucets.
p68
aVIf we can make smart investments in these new sources of water
p69
aVin the coming years,
p70
aVwe can solve our urban water problem
p71
aVand decrease the likelihood that we'll ever run across
p72
aVthe effects of a catastrophic drought.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, if you told me 20 years ago
p75
aVthat a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water,
p76
aVI probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.
p77
aVBut my own experiences
p78
aVworking with some of the world's most water-starved cities in the last decades
p79
aVhave shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills
p80
aVto actually transition away from imported water,
p81
aVand that's what I want to tell you about tonight.
p82
aa(lp83
VThe first source of local water supply that we need to develop
p84
aVto solve our urban water problem
p85
aVwill flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities.
p86
aVOne of the great tragedies of urban development
p87
aVis that as our cities grew,
p88
aVwe started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt.
p89
aVAnd when we did that, we had to build storm sewers
p90
aVto get the water that fell on the cities out
p91
aVbefore it could cause flooding,
p92
aVand that's a waste of a vital water resource.
p93
aVLet me give you an example.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis figure here shows you the volume of water
p96
aVthat could be collected in the city of San Jose
p97
aVif they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits.
p98
aVYou can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line
p99
aVthat if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city,
p100
aVthey'd have enough water to get them through an entire year.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, I know what some of you are probably thinking.
p103
aV"The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks
p104
aVand attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters,
p105
aVrainwater harvesting."
p106
aVNow, that's an idea that might work in some places.
p107
aVBut if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time
p108
aVand most of the water demand is in the summertime,
p109
aVit's not a very cost-effective way to solve a water problem.
p110
aVAnd if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought,
p111
aVlike California's currently experiencing,
p112
aVyou just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem.
p113
aa(lp114
VI think there's a lot more practical way
p115
aVto harvest the stormwater and the rainwater that falls in our cities,
p116
aVand that's to capture it and let it percolate into the ground.
p117
aVAfter all, many of our cities are sitting on top of a natural water storage system
p118
aVthat can accommodate huge volumes of water.
p119
aa(lp120
VFor example, historically, Los Angeles has obtained
p121
aVabout a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer
p122
aVthat underlies the San Fernando Valley.
p123
aVNow, when you look at the water that comes off of your roof
p124
aVand runs off of your lawn and flows down the gutter,
p125
aVyou might say to yourself, "Do I really want to drink that stuff?"
p126
aVWell, the answer is you don't want to drink it
p127
aVuntil it's been treated a little bit.
p128
aVAnd so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting
p129
aVis to capture the water, clean the water
p130
aVand get it underground.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles is doing
p133
aVwith a new project that they're building in Burbank, California.
p134
aVThis figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building
p135
aVby hooking a series of stormwater collection systems, or storm sewers,
p136
aVand routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry.
p137
aVThe water that's captured in the quarry
p138
aVis slowly passed through a man-made wetland,
p139
aVand then it goes into that ball field there
p140
aVand percolates into the ground,
p141
aVrecharging the drinking water aquifer of the city.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd in the process of passing through the wetland
p144
aVand percolating through the ground,
p145
aVthe water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants
p146
aVand the surfaces of the soil,
p147
aVand that purifies the water.
p148
aVAnd if the water's still not clean enough to drink
p149
aVafter it's been through this natural treatment process,
p150
aVthe city can treat it again
p151
aVwhen they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers
p152
aVbefore they deliver it to people to drink.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem
p155
aVwill flow with the wastewater
p156
aVthat comes out of our sewage treatment plants.
p157
aVNow, many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water.
p158
aVYou've probably seen signs like this
p159
aVthat tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median
p160
aVand the local golf course
p161
aVis being watered with water
p162
aVthat used to be in a sewage treatment plant.
p163
aVWe've been doing this for a couple of decades now.
p164
aVBut what we're learning from our experience
p165
aVis that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be.
p166
aVBecause once we build the first few water recycling systems
p167
aVclose to the sewage treatment plant,
p168
aVwe have to build longer and longer pipe networks
p169
aVto get that water to where it needs to go.
p170
aVAnd that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost.
p171
aa(lp172
VWhat we're finding is
p173
aVthat a much more cost-effective and practical way of recycling wastewater
p174
aVis to turn treated wastewater into drinking water
p175
aVthrough a two-step process.
p176
aVIn the first step in this process we pressurize the water
p177
aVand pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane:
p178
aVa thin, permeable plastic membrane
p179
aVthat allows water molecules to pass through
p180
aVbut traps and retains the salts, the viruses and the organic chemicals
p181
aVthat might be present in the wastewater.
p182
aa(lp183
VIn the second step in the process,
p184
aVwe add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide
p185
aVand shine ultraviolet light on the water.
p186
aVThe ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide
p187
aVinto two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals,
p188
aVand these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen
p189
aVthat break down most organic chemicals.
p190
aa(lp191
VAfter the water's been through this two-stage process,
p192
aVit's safe to drink.
p193
aVI know,
p194
aVI've been studying recycled water
p195
aVusing every measurement technique known to modern science
p196
aVfor the past 15 years.
p197
aVWe've detected some chemicals
p198
aVthat can make it through the first step in the process,
p199
aVbut by the time we get to the second step,
p200
aVthe advanced oxidation process,
p201
aVwe rarely see any chemicals present.
p202
aVAnd that's in stark contrast to the taken-for-granted water supplies
p203
aVthat we regularly drink all the time.
p204
aa(lp205
VThere's another way we can recycle water.
p206
aVThis is an engineered treatment wetland that we recently built
p207
aVon the Santa Ana River in Southern California.
p208
aVThe treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River
p209
aVthat in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent
p210
aVfrom cities like Riverside and San Bernardino.
p211
aVThe water comes into our treatment wetland,
p212
aVit's exposed to sunlight and algae
p213
aVand those break down the organic chemicals,
p214
aVremove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.
p215
aVThe water gets put back in the Santa Ana River,
p216
aVit flows down to Anaheim,
p217
aVgets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground,
p218
aVand becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim,
p219
aVcompleting the trip from the sewers of Riverside County
p220
aVto the drinking water supply of Orange County.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, you might think that this idea of drinking wastewater
p223
aVis some sort of futuristic fantasy or not commonly done.
p224
aVWell, in California, we already recycle about 40 billion gallons a year
p225
aVof wastewater through the two-stage advanced treatment process
p226
aVI was telling you about.
p227
aVThat's enough water to be the supply of about a million people
p228
aVif it were their sole water supply.
p229
aa(lp230
VThe third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all,
p231
aVit will be a kind of virtual tap,
p232
aVit will be the water conservation that we manage to do.
p233
aVAnd the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors
p234
aVbecause in California and other modern American cities,
p235
aVabout half of our water use happens outdoors.
p236
aa(lp237
VIn the current drought,
p238
aVwe've seen that it's possible
p239
aVto have our lawns survive and our plants survive
p240
aVwith about half as much water.
p241
aVSo there's no need to start painting concrete green
p242
aVand putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses.
p243
aVWe can have California-friendly landscaping with soil moisture detectors
p244
aVand smart irrigation controllers
p245
aVand have beautiful green landscapes in our cities.
p246
aa(lp247
VThe fourth and final water tap that we need to open up
p248
aVto solve our urban water problem
p249
aVwill flow with desalinated seawater.
p250
aVNow, I know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination.
p251
aV"It's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil, not a lot of water
p252
aVand you don't care about climate change."
p253
aVSeawater desalination is energy-intensive no matter how you slice it.
p254
aVBut that characterization of seawater desalination
p255
aVas being a nonstarter is hopelessly out of date.
p256
aVWe've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination
p257
aVin the past two decades.
p258
aa(lp259
VThis picture shows you
p260
aVthe largest seawater desalination plant in the Western hemisphere
p261
aVthat's currently being built north of San Diego.
p262
aVCompared to the seawater desalination plant
p263
aVthat was built in Santa Barbara 25 years ago,
p264
aVthis treatment plant will use about half the energy
p265
aVto produce a gallon of water.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut just because seawater desalination has become less energy-intensive,
p268
aVdoesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere.
p269
aVAmong the different choices we have,
p270
aVit's probably the most energy-intensive
p271
aVand potentially environmentally damaging
p272
aVof the options to create a local water supply.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo there it is.
p275
aVWith these four sources of water,
p276
aVwe can move away from our reliance on imported water.
p277
aVThrough reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and our properties,
p278
aVwe can reduce outdoor water use by about 50 percent,
p279
aVthereby increasing  the water supply by 25 percent.
p280
aVWe can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer,
p281
aVthereby increasing our water supply by 40 percent.
p282
aVAnd we can make up the difference through a combination
p283
aVof stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo, let's create a water supply
p286
aVthat will be able to withstand any of the challenges
p287
aVthat climate change throws at us in the coming years.
p288
aVLet's create a water supply that uses local sources
p289
aVand leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food.
p290
aVLet's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values.
p291
aVAnd let's do it for our children and our grandchildren
p292
aVand let's tell them this is the system
p293
aVthat they have to take care of in the future
p294
aVbecause it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system.
p295
aa(lp296
VThank you very much for your attention.

He began this research in 1996 when he developed simple methods for measuring steroid hormones in wastewater. Since that time, he and his students have studied the fate of hormones, pharmaceuticals, toxic disinfection byproducts and other chemicals.

VSo the machine I'm going to talk you about
p5
aVis what I call the greatest machine that never was.
p6
aVIt was a machine that was never built,
p7
aVand yet, it will be built.
p8
aVIt was a machine that was designed
p9
aVlong before anyone thought about computers.
p10
aa(lp11
VIf you know anything about the history of computers,
p12
aVyou will know that in the '30s and the '40s,
p13
aVsimple computers were created
p14
aVthat started the computer revolution we have today,
p15
aVand you would be correct,
p16
aVexcept for you'd have the wrong century.
p17
aVThe first computer was really designed
p18
aVin the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.
p19
aVIt was designed, and parts of it were prototyped,
p20
aVand the bits of it that were built are here
p21
aVin South Kensington.
p22
aa(lp23
VThat machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage.
p24
aVNow, I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage
p25
aVbecause his hair is always completely unkempt like this
p26
aVin every single picture. (Laughter)
p27
aVHe was a very wealthy man, and a sort of,
p28
aVpart of the aristocracy of Britain,
p29
aVand on a Saturday night in Marylebone,
p30
aVwere you part of the intelligentsia of that period,
p31
aVyou would have been invited round to his house
p32
aVfor a soiree \u2014 and he invited everybody:
p33
aVkings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people \u2014
p34
aVand he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.
p35
aa(lp36
VI really miss that era, you know, where you could
p37
aVgo around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer
p38
aVget demonstrated to you. (Laughter)
p39
aVBut Babbage, Babbage himself was born
p40
aVat the end of the 18th century,
p41
aVand was a fairly famous mathematician.
p42
aVHe held the post that Newton held at Cambridge,
p43
aVand that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.
p44
aVHe's less well known than either of them because
p45
aVhe got this idea to make mechanical computing devices
p46
aVand never made any of them.
p47
aa(lp48
VThe reason he never made any of them, he's a classic nerd.
p49
aVEvery time he had a good idea, he'd think,
p50
aV"That's brilliant, I'm going to start building that one.
p51
aVI'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea.
p52
aVI'm going to work on this one. (Laughter) And I'm going to do this one."
p53
aVHe did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister,
p54
aVbasically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street,
p55
aVand kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying,
p56
aV"I bid you good day, sir." (Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VThe thing he designed was this monstrosity here,
p59
aVthe analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,
p60
aVthis is a view from above.
p61
aVEvery one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs,
p62
aVand this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.
p63
aVSo as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine
p64
aVthis gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds
p65
aVof what this thing would have sounded like.
p66
aVAnd I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine
p67
aV\u2014 that's why it's computer architecture \u2014
p68
aVand tell you about this machine, which is a computer.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo let's talk about the memory. The memory
p71
aVis very like the memory of a computer today,
p72
aVexcept it was all made out of metal,
p73
aVstacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.
p74
aVImagine a thing this high of cogs,
p75
aVhundreds and hundreds of them,
p76
aVand they've got numbers on them.
p77
aVIt's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.
p78
aVAnd he thought about using binary. The problem
p79
aVwith using binary is that the machine would have been so
p80
aVtall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it's enormous.
p81
aVSo he's got memory.
p82
aVThe memory is this bit over here.
p83
aVYou see it all like this.
p84
aa(lp85
VThis monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.
p86
aVOf course, it's this big.
p87
aVCompletely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical.
p88
aVThis is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU
p89
aVwhich is in the Science Museum.
p90
aa(lp91
VThe CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic \u2014
p92
aVso addition, multiplication, subtraction, division \u2014
p93
aVwhich already is a bit of a feat in metal,
p94
aVbut it could also do something that a computer does
p95
aVand a calculator doesn't:
p96
aVthis machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.
p97
aVIt could do the "if then" for basic programmers,
p98
aVand that fundamentally made it into a computer.
p99
aVIt could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute,
p102
aVand we think about chips today, we can't
p103
aVlook inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny.
p104
aVYet if you did, you would see something
p105
aVvery, very similar to this.
p106
aVThere's this incredible complexity in the CPU,
p107
aVand this incredible regularity in the memory.
p108
aVIf you've ever seen an electron microscope picture,
p109
aVyou'll see this. This all looks the same,
p110
aVthen there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.
p111
aa(lp112
VAll this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does,
p113
aVbut of course you need to program this thing, and of course,
p114
aVBabbage used the technology of the day
p115
aVand the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s,
p116
aVwhich is punch cards. This thing over here
p117
aVis one of three punch card readers in here,
p118
aVand this is a program in the Science Museum, just
p119
aVnot far from here, created by Charles Babbage,
p120
aVthat is sitting there \u2014 you can go see it \u2014
p121
aVwaiting for the machine to be built.
p122
aVAnd there's not just one of these, there's many of them.
p123
aVHe prepared programs anticipating this would happen.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard,
p126
aVin France, had created the Jacquard loom,
p127
aVwhich was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards,
p128
aVso he was just repurposing the technology of the day,
p129
aVand like everything else he did, he's using the technology
p130
aVof his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam,
p131
aVmechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year
p132
aVas Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday,
p133
aVwho would completely revolutionize everything
p134
aVwith the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.
p135
aVBabbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology,
p136
aVso steam and things.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, he needed accessories.
p139
aVObviously, you've got a computer now.
p140
aVYou've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.
p141
aVYou need accessories you're going to come with.
p142
aVYou're not just going to have that,
p143
aa(lp144
VSo, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell,
p145
aVso if anything went wrong \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p146
aVor the machine needed the attendant to come to it,
p147
aVthere was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)
p148
aVAnd there's actually an instruction on the punch card
p149
aVwhich says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!"
p150
aVYou know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises,
p151
aVthis thing, "Click, clack click click click,"
p152
aVsteam engine, "Ding," right? (Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VYou also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer.
p155
aVThis is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for
p156
aVanother machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2,
p157
aVwhich he never built, but which the Science Museum
p158
aVdid build in the '80s and '90s.
p159
aVIt's completely mechanical, again, a printer.
p160
aVIt prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers,
p161
aVbut it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping,
p162
aVso if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that.
p163
aa(lp164
VYou also need graphics, right?
p165
aVI mean, if you're going to do anything with graphics,
p166
aVso he said, "Well, I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper
p167
aVand an ink pen and I'll make it plot."
p168
aVSo he designed a plotter as well,
p169
aVand, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much
p170
aVa pretty good machine.
p171
aa(lp172
VAlong comes this woman, Ada Lovelace.
p173
aVNow, imagine these soirees, all these great and good comes along.
p174
aVThis lady is the daughter of the mad, bad
p175
aVand dangerous-to-know Lord Byron,
p176
aVand her mother, being a bit worried that she might have
p177
aVinherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness,
p178
aVthought, "I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution.
p179
aVWe'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down."
p180
aV(Laughter) Because of course,
p181
aVthere's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy,
p182
aVso, you know, that'll be fine. (Laughter)
p183
aVEverything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training,
p184
aVand she goes to one of these soirees with her mother,
p185
aVand Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.
p186
aVThe Duke of Wellington is there, you know,
p187
aVget out the machine, obviously demonstrates it,
p188
aVand she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really,
p189
aVwho said, "I understand what this does,
p190
aVand I understand the future of this machine."
p191
aVAnd we owe to her an enormous amount because we know
p192
aVa lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build
p193
aVbecause of her.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, some people call her the first programmer.
p196
aVThis is actually from one of \u2014 the paper that she translated.
p197
aVThis is a program written in a particular style.
p198
aVIt's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer,
p199
aVand actually, she did something more amazing.
p200
aVRather than just being a programmer,
p201
aVshe saw something that Babbage didn't.
p202
aa(lp203
VBabbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.
p204
aVHe was building a machine to do mathematics,
p205
aVand Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics
p206
aVon this machine." And just as you do,
p207
aVeveryone in this room already's got a computer on them
p208
aVright now, because they've got a phone.
p209
aVIf you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone
p210
aVor computer or any other computing device
p211
aVis mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.
p212
aVWhether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers,
p213
aVit's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening,
p214
aVand Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing
p215
aVmathematical functions and symbols
p216
aVdoesn't mean these things can't represent
p217
aVother things in the real world, such as music."
p218
aVThis was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying,
p219
aV"We could compute these amazing functions and print out
p220
aVtables of numbers and draw graphs," \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p221
aVand Lovelace is there and she says, "Look,
p222
aVthis thing could even compose music if you
p223
aVtold it a representation of music numerically."
p224
aVSo this is what I call Lovelace's Leap.
p225
aVWhen you say she's a programmer, she did do some,
p226
aVbut the real thing is to have said the future is going to be
p227
aVmuch, much more than this.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow, a hundred years later, this guy comes along,
p230
aVAlan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.
p231
aVNow, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical.
p232
aVTuring's machine was entirely theoretical.
p233
aVBoth of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective,
p234
aVbut Turing told us something very important.
p235
aVHe laid down the mathematical foundations
p236
aVfor computer science, and said,
p237
aV"It doesn't matter how you make a computer."
p238
aVIt doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical,
p239
aVlike Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today,
p240
aVor perhaps in the future, cells, or, again,
p241
aVmechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.
p242
aVWe could go back to Babbage's machine
p243
aVand just make it tiny. All those things are computers.
p244
aVThere is in a sense a computing essence.
p245
aVThis is called the Church\u2013Turing thesis.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd so suddenly, you get this link where you say
p248
aVthis thing Babbage had built really was a computer.
p249
aVIn fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today
p250
aVwith computers, only really slowly. (Laughter)
p251
aVTo give you an idea of how slowly,
p252
aVit had about 1k of memory.
p253
aVIt used punch cards, which were being fed in,
p254
aVand it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
p255
aVIt did have a RAM pack.
p256
aVYou could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter) So, where does that bring us today?
p259
aVSo there are plans.
p260
aVOver in Swindon, the Science Museum archives,
p261
aVthere are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages
p262
aVof notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.
p263
aVOne of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28,
p264
aVand that is also the name of a charity that I started
p265
aVwith Doron Swade, who was the curator of computing
p266
aVat the Science Museum, and also the person who drove
p267
aVthe project to build a difference engine,
p268
aVand our plan is to build it.
p269
aVHere in South Kensington, we will build the analytical engine.
p270
aa(lp271
VThe project has a number of parts to it.
p272
aVOne was the scanning of Babbage's archive.
p273
aVThat's been done. The second is now the study
p274
aVof all of those plans to determine what to build.
p275
aVThe third part is a computer simulation of that machine,
p276
aVand the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.
p277
aa(lp278
VWhen it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works,
p279
aVbecause rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,
p280
aVyou've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah,
p281
aVI see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating,
p282
aVI hear it operating. I probably smell it operating." (Laughter)
p283
aVBut in between that we're going to do a simulation.
p284
aa(lp285
VBabbage himself wrote, he said,
p286
aVas soon as the analytical engine exists,
p287
aVit will surely guide the future course of science.
p288
aVOf course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling
p289
aVwith new plans, but when it did get built, of course,
p290
aVin the 1940s, everything changed.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow, I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like
p293
aVin motion with a video which shows
p294
aVjust one part of the CPU mechanism working.
p295
aVSo this is just three sets of cogs,
p296
aVand it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism
p297
aVin action, so you imagine this gigantic machine.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo, give me five years.
p300
aVBefore the 2030s happen, we'll have it.
p301
aa(lp302
VThank you very much. (Applause)

VI would like to share with you a new model of higher education,
p5
aVa model that, once expanded,
p6
aVcan enhance the collective intelligence
p7
aVof millions of creative and motivated individuals
p8
aVthat otherwise would be left behind.
p9
aVLook at the world.
p10
aVPick a place and focus on it.
p11
aVYou will find humans chasing higher education.
p12
aVLet's meet some of them.
p13
aa(lp14
VPatrick.
p15
aVPatrick was born in Liberia to a family of 20 children.
p16
aVDuring the civil war,
p17
aVhe and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria.
p18
aVThere, in spite of his situation,
p19
aVhe graduated high school with nearly perfect grades.
p20
aVHe wanted to continue to higher education,
p21
aVbut due to his family living on the poverty line,
p22
aVhe was soon sent to South Africa
p23
aVto work and send back money to feed his family.
p24
aVPatrick never gave up his dream of higher education.
p25
aVLate at night, after work,
p26
aVhe surfed the net, looking for ways to study.
p27
aa(lp28
VMeet Debbie.
p29
aVDebbie is from Florida.
p30
aVHer parents didn't go to college, and neither did any of her siblings.
p31
aVDebbie has worked all her life,
p32
aVpays taxes, supports herself month to month,
p33
aVproud of the American dream,
p34
aVa dream that just won't be complete without higher education.
p35
aVBut Debbie doesn't have the savings for higher education.
p36
aVShe can't pay the tuition.
p37
aVNeither could she leave work.
p38
aa(lp39
VMeet Wael.
p40
aVWael is from Syria.
p41
aVHe's experiencing firsthand
p42
aVthe misery, fear and failure imposed on his country.
p43
aVHe's a big believer in education.
p44
aVHe knew that if he could find an opportunity for higher education,
p45
aVan opportunity to get ahead of the rest,
p46
aVhe has a better chance to survive in a world turned upside down.
p47
aa(lp48
VThe higher education system
p49
aVfailed Patrick, Debbie and Wael,
p50
aVexactly as it is failing millions of potential students \u2014
p51
aVmillions that graduate high school,
p52
aVmillions that are qualified for higher education,
p53
aVmillions that want to study yet cannot access it for various reasons.
p54
aVFirst: financial.
p55
aVUniversities are expensive; we all know it.
p56
aVIn large parts of the world,
p57
aVhigher education is unattainable for an average citizen.
p58
aVThis is probably the biggest problem facing our society.
p59
aVHigher education stopped being a right for all
p60
aVand became a privilege for the few.
p61
aa(lp62
VSecond: cultural.
p63
aVStudents who are qualified for higher education
p64
aVcan afford \u2014 want to study \u2014 cannot,
p65
aVbecause it is not decent, it is not a place for a woman.
p66
aVThis is the story of countless women in Africa, for example,
p67
aVprevented from higher education because of cultural barriers.
p68
aVAnd here comes the third reason:
p69
aVUNESCO stated that in 2025,
p70
aV100 million students will be deprived of higher education,
p71
aVsimply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them,
p72
aVto meet the demand.
p73
aVThey will take a placement test, they will pass it,
p74
aVbut they still won't have access, because there are no places available.
p75
aa(lp76
VThese are the reasons I founded University of the People,
p77
aVa nonprofit, tuition-free, degree-granting university
p78
aVto give an alternative,
p79
aVto create an alternative, to those who have no other;
p80
aVan alternative that will be affordable and scalable,
p81
aVan alternative that will disrupt the current education system,
p82
aVand open the gates to higher education for every qualified student
p83
aVregardless of what they earn, where they live,
p84
aVor what society says about them.
p85
aVPatrick, Debbie and Wael
p86
aVare only three examples out of the 1,700 accepted students
p87
aVfrom 143 countries.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Applause)
p90
aVThank you.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VWe didn't need to reinvent the wheel.
p95
aVWe just looked at what wasn't working
p96
aVand used the amazing power of the Internet
p97
aVto get around it.
p98
aVWe set out to build a model
p99
aVthat will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education.
p100
aVAnd that's how we did it.
p101
aVFirst, bricks and mortar cost money.
p102
aVUniversities have expenses that virtual universities don't.
p103
aVWe don't need to pass these expenses on to our students.
p104
aVThey don't exist.
p105
aVWe also don't need to worry about capacity.
p106
aVThere are no limits of seats in virtual university.
p107
aVActually, nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall.
p108
aVTextbooks are also something our students don't need to buy.
p109
aVBy using open educational resources
p110
aVand the generosity of professors
p111
aVwho are putting their material up free and accessible,
p112
aVwe don't need to send our students to buy textbooks.
p113
aVAll of our materials come free.
p114
aa(lp115
VEven professors,
p116
aVthe most expensive line in any university balance sheet,
p117
aVcome free to our students.
p118
aVOver 3,000 of them,
p119
aVincluding presidents, vice chancellors, professors and academic advisers
p120
aVfrom top universities such as NYU, Yale, Berkeley and Oxford,
p121
aVcame on board to help our students.
p122
aa(lp123
VFinally, is our belief in peer-to-peer learning.
p124
aVWe use this sound pedagogical model
p125
aVto encourage our students from all over the world
p126
aVto interact and study together,
p127
aVand also to reduce the time our professors need
p128
aVto labor over class assignments.
p129
aa(lp130
VIf the Internet has made us a global village,
p131
aVthis model can develop its future leadership.
p132
aVLook how we do it.
p133
aVWe only offer two programs:
p134
aVbusiness administration and computer science,
p135
aVthe two programs most in demand worldwide,
p136
aVthe two programs that are likeliest to help our students find a job.
p137
aVWhen our students are accepted,
p138
aVthey are placed in a small classroom of 20 to 30 students,
p139
aVto ensure that those who need personalized attention get it.
p140
aVMoreover, for every nine-week course, they meet a new peer,
p141
aVa whole new set of students from all over the world.
p142
aVEvery week, when they go into the classroom,
p143
aVthey find the lecture notes of the week,
p144
aVthe reading assignment, the homework assignment,
p145
aVand the discussion question, which is the core of our studies.
p146
aVEvery week, every student must contribute to the class discussion,
p147
aVand also must comment on the contribution of others.
p148
aVThis way, we open our students' minds,
p149
aVwe develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures.
p150
aVBy the end of each week, the students take a quiz,
p151
aVhand in their homework,
p152
aVwhich are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors,
p153
aVget a grade, move to the next week.
p154
aVBy the end of the course, they take the final exam,
p155
aVget a grade, and follow to the next course.
p156
aa(lp157
VWe open the gates for higher education for every qualified student.
p158
aVEvery student with a high school diploma,
p159
aVsufficient English and Internet connection
p160
aVcan study with us.
p161
aVWe don't use audio, we don't use video.
p162
aVBroadband is not necessary.
p163
aVAny student from any part of the world with any Internet connection
p164
aVcan study with us.
p165
aVWe are tuition free.
p166
aVAll we ask our students to cover is the cost of their exams,
p167
aV100 dollars per exam.
p168
aVA full-time bachelor's degree student taking 40 courses
p169
aVwill pay 1,000 dollars a year,
p170
aV4,000 dollars for the entire degree.
p171
aVAnd for those who cannot afford even this,
p172
aVwe offer them a variety of scholarships.
p173
aVIt is our mission that nobody will be left behind
p174
aVfor financial reasons.
p175
aVWith 5,000 students in 2016, this model is financially sustainable.
p176
aa(lp177
VFive years ago, it was a vision.
p178
aVToday, it is a reality.
p179
aVLast month, we got the ultimate academic endorsement to our model.
p180
aVUniversity of the People is now fully accredited.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Applause)
p183
aa(lp184
VThank you.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
VWith this accreditation, it's our time now to scale up.
p189
aVWe have demonstrated that our model works.
p190
aVI invite universities and, even more important,
p191
aVdeveloping countries' governments,
p192
aVto replicate this model
p193
aVto ensure that the gates of higher education will open widely.
p194
aVA new era is coming \u2014
p195
aVan era that will witness the disruption of the higher education model
p196
aVas we know it today,
p197
aVfrom being a privilege for the few
p198
aVto becoming a basic right, affordable and accessible for all.
p199
aa(lp200
VThank you.

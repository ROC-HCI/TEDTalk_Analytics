VChris Anderson: Thank you so much, Prime Minister,
p5
aVthat was both fascinating and quite inspiring.
p6
aVSo, you're calling for a global ethic.
p7
aVWould you describe that as global citizenship?
p8
aVIs that an idea that you believe in, and how would you define that?
p9
aa(lp10
VGordon Brown: It is about global citizenship
p11
aVand recognizing our responsibilities to others.
p12
aVThere is so much to do over the next few years
p13
aVthat is obvious to so many of us
p14
aVto build a better world.
p15
aVAnd there is so much shared sense of what we need to do,
p16
aVthat it is vital that we all come together.
p17
aVBut we don't necessarily have the means to do so.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo there are challenges to be met.
p20
aVI believe the concept of global citizenship
p21
aVwill simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents.
p22
aVBut of course the task is to create the institutions
p23
aVthat make that global society work.
p24
aVBut I don't think we should underestimate
p25
aVthe extent to which massive changes in technology
p26
aVmake possible the linking up of people across the world.
p27
aa(lp28
VCA: But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship,
p29
aVbut then they get confused a bit again
p30
aVwhen they start thinking about patriotism,
p31
aVand how to combine these two.
p32
aVI mean, you're elected as Prime Minister
p33
aVwith a brief to bat for Britain.
p34
aVHow do you reconcile the two things?
p35
aa(lp36
VGB: Well, of course national identity remains important.
p37
aVBut it's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities.
p38
aVAnd I think one of the problems of recession
p39
aVis that people become more protectionist,
p40
aVthey look in on themselves,
p41
aVthey try to protect their own nation,
p42
aVperhaps at the expense of other nations.
p43
aVWhen you actually look at the motor of the world economy,
p44
aVit cannot move forward
p45
aVunless there is trade between the different countries.
p46
aVAnd any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years
p47
aVwould deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits
p48
aVof growth in the world economy.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo, you've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism;
p51
aVthat's absolutely important.
p52
aVBut you've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally,
p53
aVand the problems we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone.
p54
aa(lp55
VCA: Well, indeed.
p56
aVBut what do you do when the two come into conflict
p57
aVand you're forced to make a decision
p58
aVthat either is in Britain's interest, or the interest of Britons,
p59
aVor citizens elsewhere in the world?
p60
aa(lp61
VGB: Well I think we can persuade people
p62
aVthat what is necessary for Britain's long-term interests,
p63
aVwhat is necessary for America's long-term interests,
p64
aVis proper engagement with the rest of the world,
p65
aVand taking the action that is necessary.
p66
aa(lp67
VThere is a great story, again, told about Richard Nixon.
p68
aV1958, Ghana becomes independent,
p69
aVso it is just over 50 years ago.
p70
aVRichard Nixon goes to represent the United States government
p71
aVat the celebrations for independence in Ghana.
p72
aVAnd it's one of his first outings as Vice President to an African country.
p73
aVHe doesn't quite know what to do,
p74
aVso he starts going around the crowd
p75
aVand starts talking to people
p76
aVand he says to people in this rather unique way,
p77
aV"How does it feel to be free?"
p78
aVAnd he's going around, "How does it feel to be free?"
p79
aV"How does it feel to be free?"
p80
aVAnd then someone says,
p81
aV"How should I know? I come from Alabama."
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd that was the 1950s.
p86
aVNow, what is remarkable
p87
aVis that civil rights in America were achieved in the 1960s.
p88
aVBut what is equally remarkable
p89
aVis socioeconomic rights in Africa have not moved forward very fast
p90
aVeven since the age of colonialism.
p91
aVAnd yet, America and Africa have got a common interest.
p92
aVAnd we have got to realize that if we don't link up
p93
aVwith those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa,
p94
aVto work together for common causes,
p95
aVthen the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups
p96
aVmaking progress in Africa is very big.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo, I would say that what seems sometimes
p99
aVto be altruism, in relation to Africa, or in relation to developing countries,
p100
aVis more than that.
p101
aVIt is enlightened self-interest for us to work with other countries.
p102
aVAnd I would say that national interest
p103
aVand, if you like, what is the global interest
p104
aVto tackle poverty and climate change
p105
aVdo, in the long run, come together.
p106
aVAnd whatever the short-run price for taking action on climate change
p107
aVor on security, or taking action to provide opportunities
p108
aVfor people for education,
p109
aVthese are prices that are worth paying
p110
aVso that you build a stronger global society
p111
aVwhere people feel able to feel comfortable with each other
p112
aVand are able to communicate with each other in such a way
p113
aVthat you can actually build stronger links between different countries.
p114
aa(lp115
VCA: I still just want to draw out on this issue.
p116
aVSo, you're on vacation at a nice beach,
p117
aVand word comes through that there's been a massive earthquake
p118
aVand that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach.
p119
aVOne end of the beach, there is a house containing a family of five Nigerians.
p120
aVAnd at the other end of the beach there is a single Brit.
p121
aVYou have time to \u2014
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
Vyou have time to alert one house.
p126
aVWhat do you do?
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VGB: Modern communications.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VAlert both.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Applause)
p137
aa(lp138
VI do agree that my responsibility
p139
aVis first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe.
p140
aVAnd I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest
p141
aVthat I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility
p142
aVthat each leader has for their own country.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut I'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity
p145
aVopen to us that was never open to us before.
p146
aVBut the power to communicate across borders
p147
aVallows us to organize the world in a different way.
p148
aVAnd I think, look at the tsunami, it's a classic example.
p149
aVWhere was the early warning systems?
p150
aVWhere was the world acting together
p151
aVto deal with the problems that they knew arose
p152
aVfrom the potential for earthquakes,
p153
aVas well as the potential for climate change?
p154
aVAnd when the world starts to work together,
p155
aVwith better early-warning systems,
p156
aVyou can deal with some of these problems in a better way.
p157
aVI just think we're not seeing, at the moment,
p158
aVthe huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate
p159
aVin a world where either there was isolationism before
p160
aVor there was limited alliances based on convenience
p161
aVwhich never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems.
p162
aa(lp163
VCA: But I think this is the frustration
p164
aVthat perhaps a lot of people have, like people in the audience here,
p165
aVwhere we love the kind of language that you're talking about.
p166
aVIt is inspiring.
p167
aVA lot of us believe that that has to be the world's future.
p168
aVAnd yet, when the situation changes,
p169
aVyou suddenly hear politicians talking as if,
p170
aVyou know, for example, the life of one American soldier
p171
aVis worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians.
p172
aVWhen the pedal hits the metal,
p173
aVthe idealism can get moved away.
p174
aVI'm just wondering whether you can see that changing over time,
p175
aVwhether you see in Britain
p176
aVthat there are changing attitudes,
p177
aVand that people are actually more supportive
p178
aVof the kind of global ethic that you talk about.
p179
aa(lp180
VGB: I think every religion, every faith,
p181
aVand I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion \u2014
p182
aVit has this global ethic at the center of its credo.
p183
aVAnd whether it's Jewish or whether it's Muslim
p184
aVor whether it's Hindu, or whether it's Sikh,
p185
aVthe same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions.
p186
aVSo, I think you're dealing with something
p187
aVthat people instinctively see as part of their moral sense.
p188
aVSo you're building on something that is not pure self-interest.
p189
aVYou're building on people's ideas and values \u2014
p190
aVthat perhaps they're candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions.
p191
aVBut it is a set of values that cannot, in my view, be extinguished.
p192
aa(lp193
VThen the question is,
p194
aVhow do you make that change happen?
p195
aVHow do you persuade people that it is in their interest
p196
aVto build strong \u2014
p197
aVAfter the Second World War,
p198
aVwe built institutions, the United Nations,
p199
aVthe IMF, the World Bank,
p200
aVthe World Trade Organization, the Marshall Plan.
p201
aVThere was a period in which people talked about an act of creation,
p202
aVbecause these institutions were so new.
p203
aVBut they are now out of date. They don't deal with the problems.
p204
aVYou can't deal with the environmental problem
p205
aVthrough existing institutions.
p206
aVYou can't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to.
p207
aVYou can't deal with the economic and financial problem.
p208
aVSo we have got to rebuild our global institutions,
p209
aVbuild them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd I believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face,
p212
aVit is to persuade people to have the confidence
p213
aVthat we can build a truly global society
p214
aVwith the institutions that are founded on these rules.
p215
aVSo, I come back to my initial point.
p216
aVSometimes you think things are impossible.
p217
aVNobody would have said 50 years ago
p218
aVthat apartheid would have gone in 1990,
p219
aVor that the Berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the '80s and '90s,
p220
aVor that polio could be eradicated,
p221
aVor perhaps 60 years ago,
p222
aVnobody would have said a man could gone to the Moon.
p223
aVAll these things have happened.
p224
aVBy tackling the impossible, you make the impossible possible.
p225
aa(lp226
VCA: And we have had a speaker who said that very thing,
p227
aVand swallowed a sword right after that, which was quite dramatic.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VGB: Followed my sword and swallow.
p232
aa(lp233
VCA: But, surely a true global ethic is for someone to say,
p234
aV"I believe that the life of every human on the planet
p235
aVis worth the same, equal consideration,
p236
aVregardless of nationality and religion."
p237
aVAnd you have politicians who have \u2014
p238
aVyou're elected.
p239
aVIn a way, you can't say that.
p240
aVEven if, as a human being, you believe that,
p241
aVyou can't say that.
p242
aVYou're elected for Britain's interests.
p243
aa(lp244
VGB: We have a responsibility to protect.
p245
aVI mean look, 1918, the Treaty of Versailles,
p246
aVand all the treaties before that,
p247
aVthe Treaty of Westphalia and everything else,
p248
aVwere about protecting the sovereign right of countries
p249
aVto do what they want.
p250
aVSince then, the world has moved forward,
p251
aVpartly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust,
p252
aVand people's concern about the rights of individuals
p253
aVwithin territories where they need protection,
p254
aVpartly because of what we saw in Rwanda,
p255
aVpartly because of what we saw in Bosnia.
p256
aVThe idea of the responsibility to protect
p257
aVall individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk
p258
aVis now being established as a principle which governs the world.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo, while I can't automatically say
p261
aVthat Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country, in danger,
p262
aVI can say that Britain is in a position
p263
aVwhere we're working with other countries
p264
aVso that this idea that you have a responsibility
p265
aVto protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack,
p266
aVis something that is accepted by the whole world.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow, in the end, that can only be achieved
p269
aVif your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so.
p270
aVAnd that comes back to what the future role of the United Nations,
p271
aVand what it can do, actually is.
p272
aVBut, the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is, in a sense,
p273
aVtaken over from the idea of self-determination
p274
aVas the principle governing the international community.
p275
aa(lp276
VCA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes,
p277
aVa politician ever going out on a platform
p278
aVof the kind of full-form global ethic, global citizenship?
p279
aVAnd basically saying, "I believe that all people across the planet
p280
aVhave equal consideration,
p281
aVand if in power we will act in that way.
p282
aVAnd we believe that the people of this country
p283
aVare also now global citizens and will support that ethic."
p284
aa(lp285
VGB: Is that not what we're doing in the debate about climate change?
p286
aVWe're saying that you cannot solve
p287
aVthe problem of climate change in one country;
p288
aVyou've got to involve all countries.
p289
aVYou're saying that you must, and you have a duty to help those countries
p290
aVthat cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves.
p291
aVYou're saying you want a deal
p292
aVwith all the different countries of the world
p293
aVwhere we're all bound together
p294
aVto cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world.
p295
aVWe've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work.
p296
aVIf you could get a deal at Copenhagen, where people agreed,
p297
aVA, that there was a long-term target for carbon emission cuts,
p298
aVB, that there was short-range targets that had to be met
p299
aVso this wasn't just abstract;
p300
aVit was people actually making decisions now
p301
aVthat would make a difference now,
p302
aVand if you could then find a financing mechanism
p303
aVthat meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt
p304
aVby our inability to deal with climate change
p305
aVover many, many years and decades
p306
aVare given special help
p307
aVso that they can move to energy-efficient technologies,
p308
aVand they are in a position financially
p309
aVto be able to afford the long-term investment
p310
aVthat is associated with cutting carbon emissions,
p311
aVthen you are treating the world equally,
p312
aVby giving consideration to every part of the planet
p313
aVand the needs they have.
p314
aa(lp315
VIt doesn't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing,
p316
aVbecause we've actually got to do more financially
p317
aVto help the poorest countries,
p318
aVbut it does mean there is equal consideration
p319
aVfor the needs of citizens in a single planet.
p320
aa(lp321
VCA: Yes.
p322
aVAnd then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart
p323
aVby different countries fighting over their own individual interests.
p324
aa(lp325
VGB: Yes, but I think Europe has got a position,
p326
aVwhich is 27 countries have already come together.
p327
aVI mean, the great difficulty in Europe
p328
aVis if you're at a meeting and 27 people speak,
p329
aVit takes a very, very long time.
p330
aVBut we did get an agreement on climate change.
p331
aVAmerica has made its first disposition on this
p332
aVwith the bill that President Obama should be congratulated
p333
aVfor getting through Congress.
p334
aVJapan has made an announcement.
p335
aVChina and India have signed up to the scientific evidence.
p336
aVAnd now we've got to move them to accept
p337
aVa long-term target, and then short-term targets.
p338
aVBut more progress has been made, I think, in the last few weeks
p339
aVthan had been made for some years.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd I do believe that there is a strong possibility
p342
aVthat if we work together, we can get that agreement to Copenhagen.
p343
aVI certainly have been putting forward proposals
p344
aVthat would have allowed the poorest parts of the world
p345
aVto feel that we have taken into account their specific needs.
p346
aVAnd we would help them adapt.
p347
aVAnd we would help them make the transition to a low-carbon economy.
p348
aa(lp349
VI do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this.
p350
aVWhen the IMF was created in the 1940s,
p351
aVit was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world's GDP.
p352
aVThe IMF now has limited resources, one percent.
p353
aVIt can't really make the difference
p354
aVthat ought to be made in a period of crisis.
p355
aVSo, we've got to rebuild the world institutions.
p356
aVAnd that's a big task:
p357
aVpersuading all the different countries
p358
aVwith the different voting shares in these institutions to do so.
p359
aa(lp360
VThere is a story told about the three world leaders
p361
aVof the day getting a chance to get some advice from God.
p362
aVAnd the story is told that Bill Clinton went to God
p363
aVand he asked when there will be successful climate change
p364
aVand a low-carbon economy.
p365
aVAnd God shook his head and said,
p366
aV"Not this year, not this decade, perhaps not even in [your] lifetime."
p367
aVAnd Bill Clinton walked away in tears
p368
aVbecause he had failed to get what he wanted.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd then the story is that Barroso, the president of the European Commission,
p371
aVwent to God and he asked,
p372
aV"When will we get a recovery of global growth?"
p373
aVAnd God said, "Not this year, not in this decade,
p374
aVperhaps not in your lifetime."
p375
aVSo Barroso walked away crying and in tears.
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd then the Secretary-General of the United Nations
p378
aVcame up to speak to God and said,
p379
aV"When will our international institutions work?"
p380
aVAnd God cried.
p381
aa(lp382
V(Laughter)
p383
aa(lp384
VIt is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions
p385
aVis the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves
p386
aVthat there is a clear ethic upon which we can build.
p387
aa(lp388
VCA: Prime Minister, I think there are many in the audience
p389
aVwho are truly appreciative of the efforts you made
p390
aVin terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into.
p391
aVAnd there are certainly many people in the audience
p392
aVwho will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic.
p393
aa(lp394
VThank you so much for coming to TED.
p395
aa(lp396
VGB: Well, thank you.
p397

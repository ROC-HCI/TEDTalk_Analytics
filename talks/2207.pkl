VWe need to change the culture in our jails and prisons,
p5
aVespecially for young inmates.
p6
aVNew York state is one of only two in the U.S.
p7
aVthat automatically arrests and tries 16- to 17-year-olds as adults.
p8
aVThis culture of violence takes these young people
p9
aVand puts them in a hostile environment,
p10
aVand the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on.
p11
aVThere's not really much for these young people to do
p12
aVto actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them.
p13
aVUntil we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18,
p14
aVwe need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people.
p15
aa(lp16
VI know firsthand.
p17
aVBefore I ever turned 18,
p18
aVI spent approximately 400 days on Rikers Island,
p19
aVand to add to that
p20
aVI spent almost 300 days in solitary confinement,
p21
aVand let me tell you this:
p22
aVScreaming at the top of your lungs all day on your cell door
p23
aVor screaming at the top of your lungs out the window,
p24
aVit gets tiring.
p25
aVSince there's not much for you to do while you're in there,
p26
aVyou start pacing back and forth in your cell,
p27
aVyou start talking to yourself,
p28
aVyour thoughts start running wild,
p29
aVand then your thoughts become your own worst enemy.
p30
aVJails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person,
p31
aVnot cause him or her to become more angry,
p32
aVfrustrated, and feel more hopeless.
p33
aVSince there's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people,
p34
aVthey pretty much  reenter society with nothing.
p35
aVAnd there's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut it all starts with the C.O.s.
p38
aVIt's very easy for some people
p39
aVto look at these correctional officers as the good guys
p40
aVand the inmates as the bad guys,
p41
aVor vice versa for some,
p42
aVbut it's a little more than that.
p43
aVSee, these C.O.s are normal, everyday people.
p44
aVThey come from the same neighborhoods as the population they "serve."
p45
aVThey're just normal people.
p46
aVThey're not robots, and there's  nothing special about them.
p47
aVThey do pretty much everything anybody else in society does.
p48
aVThe male C.O.s want to talk and flirt with the female C.O.s.
p49
aVThey play the little high school kid games with each other.
p50
aVThey politic with one another.
p51
aVAnd the female C.O.s gossip to each other.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo I spent numerous amounts of time with numerous amounts of C.O.s,
p54
aVand let me tell you about this one in particular named Monroe.
p55
aVOne day he pulled me in between the A and B doors
p56
aVwhich separate the north and south sides of our housing unit.
p57
aVHe pulled me there because I had a physical altercation
p58
aVwith another young man in my housing unit,
p59
aVand he felt, since there was a female officer working on the floor,
p60
aVthat I violated his shift.
p61
aVSo he punched me in my chest.
p62
aVHe kind of knocked the wind out of me.
p63
aVI wasn't impulsive, I didn't react right away,
p64
aVbecause I know this is their house.
p65
aVI have no wins.
p66
aVAll he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately.
p67
aVSo I just gave him a look in his eyes
p68
aVand I guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning,
p69
aVand he said to me,
p70
aV"Your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble,
p71
aVbecause you're looking like you want to fight."
p72
aVSo he commenced to taking off his utility belt,
p73
aVhe took off his shirt and his badge,
p74
aVand he said, "We could fight."
p75
aa(lp76
VSo I asked him, "You gonna hold it down?"
p77
aVNow, that's a term that's commonly used on Rikers Island
p78
aVmeaning that you're not going to say anything to anybody,
p79
aVand you're not going to report it.
p80
aVHe said, "Yeah, I'm gonna hold it down. You gonna hold it down?"
p81
aVI didn't even respond.
p82
aVI just punched him right in his face,
p83
aVand we began fighting right then and there.
p84
aa(lp85
VTowards the end of the fight, he slammed me up against the wall,
p86
aVso while we were tussled up, he said to me, "You good?"
p87
aVas if he got the best of me,
p88
aVbut in my mind, I know I got the best of him,
p89
aVso I replied very cocky,
p90
aV"Oh, I'm good, you good?"
p91
aVHe said, "Yeah, I'm good,  I'm good."
p92
aVWe let go, he shook my hand, said he gave me my respect,
p93
aVgave me a cigarette and sent me on my way.
p94
aa(lp95
VBelieve it or not, you come across some C.O.s on Rikers Island
p96
aVthat'll fight you one-on-one.
p97
aVThey feel that they understand how it is,
p98
aVand they feel that I'm going to meet you where you're at.
p99
aVSince this is how you commonly handle your disputes,
p100
aVwe can handle it in that manner.
p101
aVI walk away from it like a man, you walk away from it like a man,
p102
aVand that's it.
p103
aVSome C.O.s feel that they're jailing with you.
p104
aVThis is why they have that mentality and that attitude
p105
aVand they go by that concept.
p106
aVIn some instances, we're in it together with the C.O.s.
p107
aVHowever, institutions need to give these correctional officers
p108
aVproper trainings on how to properly deal with the adolescent population,
p109
aVand they also need to give them proper trainings
p110
aVon how to deal with  the mental health population as well.
p111
aVThese C.O.s play a big factor in these young people's lives
p112
aVfor x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case.
p113
aVSo why not try to mentor these young people while they're there?
p114
aVWhy not try to give them some type of insight to make a change,
p115
aVso once they reenter back into society,
p116
aVthey're doing something positive?
p117
aa(lp118
VA second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming.
p119
aVWhen I was on Rikers Island, the huge thing was solitary confinement.
p120
aVSolitary confinement was originally designed
p121
aVto break a person mentally, physically and emotionally.
p122
aVThat's what it was designed for.
p123
aVThe U.S. Attorney General recently released a report
p124
aVstating that they're going to ban solitary confinement
p125
aVin New York state for teens.
p126
aa(lp127
VOne thing that kept me sane while I was in solitary confinement was reading.
p128
aVI tried to educate myself as much as possible.
p129
aVI read any and everything I could get my hands on.
p130
aVAnd aside from that, I wrote music and short stories.
p131
aVSome programs that I feel would benefit our young people
p132
aVare art therapy programs
p133
aVfor the kids that like to draw and have that talent,
p134
aVand what about the young individuals that are musically inclined?
p135
aVHow about a music program for them that actually teaches them
p136
aVhow to write and make music?
p137
aVJust a thought.
p138
aa(lp139
VWhen adolescents come to Rikers Island,
p140
aVC74, RNDC is the building that they're housed in.
p141
aVThat's nicknamed "gladiator school,"
p142
aVbecause you have a young individual coming in from the street
p143
aVthinking that they're tough,
p144
aVbeing surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals
p145
aVfrom all of the five boroughs, and everybody feels that they're tough.
p146
aVSo now you have a bunch of young gentlemen poking their chests out
p147
aVfeeling that I have to prove I'm equally as tough as you
p148
aVor I'm tougher than you, you and you.
p149
aVBut let's be honest:
p150
aVThat culture is very dangerous and damaging to our young people.
p151
aVWe need to help institutions and these teens realize
p152
aVthat they don't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led
p153
aVwhen they were on the street, that they can actually make a change.
p154
aa(lp155
VIt's sad to report that while I was in prison,
p156
aVI used to hear dudes talking about when they get released from prison,
p157
aVwhat type of crimes they're going to commit
p158
aVwhen they get back in the street.
p159
aVThe conversations used to sound something like this:
p160
aV"Oh, when I hit the street, my brother got this connection
p161
aVfor this, that and the third,"
p162
aVor, "My man over here got this connection for the low price.
p163
aVLet's exchange information,"
p164
aVand, "When we hit the town, we're going to do it real big."
p165
aVI used to hear these conversations and think to myself, "Wow,
p166
aVthese dudes are really talking about going back in the street
p167
aVand committing future crimes."
p168
aVSo I came up with a name for that:
p169
aVI called it a go-back-to-jail-quick scheme
p170
aVbecause really, how long is that going to last?
p171
aVYou get a retirement plan with that?
p172
aVNice little pension? 401(k)? 403(b)?
p173
aVYou get health insurance? Dental?
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VBut I will tell you this:
p177
aVBeing in jail and being in prison,
p178
aVI came across some of the most intelligent, brilliant,
p179
aVand talented people that I would ever meet.
p180
aVI've seen individuals take a potato chip bag
p181
aVand turn it into the most beautiful picture frame.
p182
aVI've seen individuals take the state soap that's provided for free
p183
aVand turn them into the most beautiful sculptures
p184
aVthat would make Michelangelo look like a kindergartner made it.
p185
aa(lp186
VAt the age of 21, I was in a maximum-security prison
p187
aVcalled Elmira Correctional Facility.
p188
aVI just came out of the weight shack from working out,
p189
aVand I saw an older gentleman that I knew standing in the middle of the yard
p190
aVjust looking up at the sky.
p191
aVMind you, this older gentlemen was serving a 33-and-a-third-to-life sentence
p192
aVin which he already had served 20 years of that sentence.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo I walk up to him and I said,
p195
aV"O.G., what's going on, man, you good?"
p196
aa(lp197
VHe looked at me, and he said, "Yeah, I'm good, young blood."
p198
aa(lp199
VI'm like, "So what are you looking up at the sky for, man?
p200
aVWhat's so fascinating up there?"
p201
aa(lp202
VHe said, "You look up and you tell me what you see."
p203
aa(lp204
V"Clouds." (Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VHe said, "All right. What else do you see?"
p207
aVAt that time, it was a plane passing by.
p208
aa(lp209
VI said, "All right, I see an airplane."
p210
aa(lp211
VHe said, "Exactly, and what's  on that airplane?" "People."
p212
aV"Exactly. Now where's that plane and those people going?"
p213
aa(lp214
V"I don't know. You know?
p215
aVPlease let me know if you do. Then let me get some lottery numbers."
p216
aa(lp217
VHe said, "You're missing the big picture, young blood.
p218
aVThat plane with those people is going somewhere,
p219
aVwhile we're here stuck.
p220
aVThe big picture is this:
p221
aVThat plane with those people going somewhere,
p222
aVthat's life passing us by while we behind these walls, stuck."
p223
aa(lp224
VEver since that day,
p225
aVthat sparked something in my mind and made me know I had to make a change.
p226
aVGrowing up, I was always a good, smart kid.
p227
aVSome people would say I was a little too smart for my own good.
p228
aVI had dreams of becoming an architect or an archaeologist.
p229
aa(lp230
VCurrently, I'm working at the Fortune Society,
p231
aVwhich is a reentry program,
p232
aVand I work with people as a case manager that are at high risk for recidivism.
p233
aVSo I connect them with the services that they need
p234
aVonce they're released from jail and prison
p235
aVso they can make a positive transition back into society.
p236
aVIf I was to see my 15-year-old self today,
p237
aVI would sit down and talk to him and try to educate him
p238
aVand I would let him know, "Listen, this is me. I'm you.
p239
aVThis is us. We are one.
p240
aVEverything that you're about to do, I know what you're gonna do
p241
aVbefore you do it because I already did it,
p242
aVand I would encourage him not to hang out with x, y and z people.
p243
aVI would tell him not to be in such-and-such place.
p244
aVI would tell him, keep your behind in school, man,
p245
aVbecause that's where you need to be,
p246
aVbecause that's what's going to get you somewhere in life.
p247
aVThis is the message that we should be sharing
p248
aVwith our young men and young women.
p249
aVWe shouldn't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence
p250
aVthat are nearly impossible for them to escape.
p251
aa(lp252
VThank you.

VWhen I was seven years old,
p5
aVsome well-meaning adult asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.
p6
aVProudly, I said: "An artist."
p7
aV"No, you don't," he said,
p8
aV"You can't make a living being an artist!"
p9
aa(lp10
VMy little seven-year-old Picasso dreams were crushed.
p11
aVBut I gathered myself,
p12
aVwent off in search of a new dream,
p13
aVeventually settling on being a scientist,
p14
aVperhaps something like the next Albert Einstein.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VI have always loved math and science,
p19
aVlater, coding.
p20
aVAnd so I decided to study computer programming in college.
p21
aVIn my junior year,
p22
aVmy computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films.
p23
aVIt was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen.
p24
aVI watched these films in wonder, transfixed,
p25
aVfireworks going off in my head,
p26
aVthinking, "That is what I want to do with my life."
p27
aVThe idea that all the math, science and code I had been learning
p28
aVcould come together to create these worlds and characters
p29
aVand stories I connected with,
p30
aVwas pure magic for me.
p31
aa(lp32
VJust two years later, I started working
p33
aVat the place that made those films, Pixar Animation Studios.
p34
aVIt was here I learned how we actually execute those films.
p35
aVTo create our movies,
p36
aVwe create a three-dimensional world inside the computer.
p37
aVWe start with a point that makes a line that makes a face
p38
aVthat creates characters,
p39
aVor trees and rocks that eventually become a forest.
p40
aVAnd because it's a three-dimensional world,
p41
aVwe can move a camera around inside that world.
p42
aVI was fascinated by all of it.
p43
aVBut then I got my first taste of lighting.
p44
aa(lp45
VLighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world.
p46
aVI actually have icons of lights I move around in there.
p47
aVHere you can see I've added a light,
p48
aVI'm turning on the rough version of lighting in our software,
p49
aVturn on shadows
p50
aVand placing the light.
p51
aVAs I place a light,
p52
aVI think about what it might look like in real life,
p53
aVbut balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story.
p54
aVSo it might look like this at first,
p55
aVbut as we adjust this and move that
p56
aVin weeks of work,
p57
aVin rough form it might look like this,
p58
aVand in final form, like this.
p59
aa(lp60
VThere's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it.
p61
aVIt's where we go from this
p62
aVto this.
p63
aVIt's the moment where all the pieces come together,
p64
aVand suddenly the world comes to life
p65
aVas if it's an actual place that exists.
p66
aVThis moment never gets old,
p67
aVespecially for that little seven-year-old girl that wanted to be an artist.
p68
aa(lp69
VAs I learned to light,
p70
aVI learned about using light to help tell story,
p71
aVto set the time of day,
p72
aVto create the mood,
p73
aVto guide the audience's eye,
p74
aVhow to make a character look appealing
p75
aVor stand out in a busy set.
p76
aa(lp77
VDid you see WALL-E?
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VThere he is.
p82
aa(lp83
VAs you can see,
p84
aVwe can create any world that we want inside the computer.
p85
aVWe can make a world with monsters,
p86
aVwith robots that fall in love,
p87
aVwe can even make pigs fly.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VWhile this is an incredible thing,
p92
aVthis untethered artistic freedom,
p93
aVit can create chaos.
p94
aVIt can create unbelievable worlds,
p95
aVunbelievable movement,
p96
aVthings that are jarring to the audience.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo to combat this, we tether ourselves with science.
p99
aVWe use science and the world we know
p100
aVas a backbone,
p101
aVto ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable.
p102
aV"Finding Nemo" is an excellent example of this.
p103
aVA major portion of the movie takes place underwater.
p104
aVBut how do you make it look underwater?
p105
aa(lp106
VIn early research and development,
p107
aVwe took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer.
p108
aVThen we broke it back down
p109
aVto see which elements make up that underwater look.
p110
aVOne of the most critical elements
p111
aVwas how the light travels through the water.
p112
aVSo we coded up a light that mimics this physics \u2014
p113
aVfirst, the visibility of the water,
p114
aVand then what happens with the color.
p115
aVObjects close to the eye have their full, rich colors.
p116
aVAs light travels deeper into the water,
p117
aVwe lose the red wavelengths,
p118
aVthen the green wavelengths,
p119
aVleaving us with blue at the far depths.
p120
aa(lp121
VIn this clip you can see two other important elements.
p122
aVThe first is the surge and swell,
p123
aVor the invisible underwater current
p124
aVthat pushes the bits of particulate around in the water.
p125
aVThe second is the caustics.
p126
aVThese are the ribbons of light,
p127
aVlike you might see on the bottom of a pool,
p128
aVthat are created when the sun bends through the crests
p129
aVof the ripples and waves on the ocean's surface.
p130
aVHere we have the fog beams.
p131
aVThese give us color depth cues,
p132
aVbut also tells which direction is up
p133
aVin shots where we don't see the water surface.
p134
aVThe other really cool thing you can see here
p135
aVis that we lit that particulate only with the caustics,
p136
aVso that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light,
p137
aVit appears and disappears,
p138
aVlending a subtle, magical sparkle to the underwater.
p139
aa(lp140
VYou can see how we're using the science \u2014
p141
aVthe physics of water, light and movement \u2014
p142
aVto tether that artistic freedom.
p143
aVBut we are not beholden to it.
p144
aVWe considered each of these elements
p145
aVand which ones had to be scientifically accurate
p146
aVand which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood.
p147
aa(lp148
VWe realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with.
p149
aVSo here's a traditionally colored underwater scene.
p150
aVBut here, we can take Sydney Harbor and push it fairly green
p151
aVto suit the sad mood of what's happening.
p152
aVIn this scene, it's really important we see deep into the underwater,
p153
aVso we understand what the East Australian Current is,
p154
aVthat the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride.
p155
aVSo we pushed the visibility of the water
p156
aVwell past anything you would ever see in real life.
p157
aVBecause in the end,
p158
aVwe are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world,
p159
aVwe're trying to create a believable world,
p160
aVone the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story.
p161
aa(lp162
VWe use science to create something wonderful.
p163
aVWe use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder.
p164
aVThis guy, WALL-E, is a great example of that.
p165
aVHe finds beauty in the simplest things.
p166
aVBut when he came in to lighting, we knew we had a big problem.
p167
aVWe got so geeked-out on making WALL-E this convincing robot,
p168
aVthat we made his binoculars practically optically perfect.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VHis binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has.
p173
aVHe doesn't have a face or even traditional dialogue, for that matter.
p174
aVSo the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars
p175
aVto sell his acting and emotions.
p176
aa(lp177
VWe started lighting and we realized
p178
aVthe triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections.
p179
aVHe was starting to look glassy-eyed.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, glassy-eyed is a fundamentally awful thing
p184
aVwhen you are trying to convince an audience
p185
aVthat a robot has a personality and he's capable of falling in love.
p186
aVSo we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars,
p187
aVtrying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials
p188
aVbut solve this reflection problem.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo we started with the lenses.
p191
aVHere's the flat-front lens,
p192
aVwe have a concave lens
p193
aVand a convex lens.
p194
aVAnd here you see all three together,
p195
aVshowing us all these reflections.
p196
aVWe tried turning them down,
p197
aVwe tried blocking them,
p198
aVnothing was working.
p199
aVYou can see here,
p200
aVsometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes \u2014
p201
aVusually Eve.
p202
aVSo we couldn't just use some faked abstract image on the lenses.
p203
aVSo here we have Eve on the first lens,
p204
aVwe put Eve on the second lens,
p205
aVit's not working.
p206
aVWe turn it down,
p207
aVit's still not working.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd then we have our eureka moment.
p210
aVWe add a light to WALL-E that accidentally leaks into his eyes.
p211
aVYou can see it light up these gray aperture blades.
p212
aVSuddenly, those aperture blades are poking through that reflection
p213
aVthe way nothing else has.
p214
aVNow we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.
p215
aVAs humans we have the white of our eye,
p216
aVthe colored iris
p217
aVand the black pupil.
p218
aVNow WALL-E has the black of an eye,
p219
aVthe gray aperture blades
p220
aVand the black pupil.
p221
aVSuddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul,
p222
aVlike there's a character with emotion inside.
p223
aVLater in the movie towards the end,
p224
aVWALL-E loses his personality,
p225
aVessentially going dead.
p226
aVThis is the perfect time to bring back that glassy-eyed look.
p227
aVIn the next scene, WALL-E comes back to life.
p228
aVWe bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back,
p229
aVand he returns to that sweet, soulful robot we've come to love.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Video) WALL-E: Eva?
p232
aa(lp233
VDanielle Feinberg: There's a beauty in these unexpected moments \u2014
p234
aVwhen you find the key to unlocking a robot's soul,
p235
aVthe moment when you discover what you want to do with your life.
p236
aVThe jellyfish in "Finding Nemo" was one of those moments for me.
p237
aa(lp238
VThere are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together.
p239
aVThis was one of those scenes.
p240
aVThe director had a vision for this scene
p241
aVbased on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the South Pacific.
p242
aVAs we went along,
p243
aVwe were floundering.
p244
aVThe reviews with the director
p245
aVturned from the normal look-and-feel conversation
p246
aVinto more and more questions about numbers and percentages.
p247
aVMaybe because unlike normal,
p248
aVwe were basing it on something in real life,
p249
aVor maybe just because we had lost our way.
p250
aVBut it had become about using our brain without our eyes,
p251
aVthe science without the art.
p252
aVThat scientific tether was strangling the scene.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut even through all the frustrations,
p255
aVI still believed it could be beautiful.
p256
aVSo when it came in to lighting,
p257
aVI dug in.
p258
aVAs I worked to balance the blues and the pinks,
p259
aVthe caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells,
p260
aVthe undulating fog beams,
p261
aVsomething promising began to appear.
p262
aVI came in one morning and checked the previous night's work.
p263
aVAnd I got excited.
p264
aVAnd then I showed it to the lighting director
p265
aVand she got excited.
p266
aVSoon, I was showing to the director in a dark room full of 50 people.
p267
aa(lp268
VIn director review,
p269
aVyou hope you might get some nice words,
p270
aVthen you get some notes and fixes, generally.
p271
aVAnd then, hopefully, you get a final,
p272
aVsignaling to move on to the next stage.
p273
aVI gave my intro, and I played the jellyfish scene.
p274
aVAnd the director was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time.
p275
aVJust long enough for me to think,
p276
aV"Oh no, this is doomed."
p277
aVAnd then he started clapping.
p278
aVAnd then the production designer started clapping.
p279
aVAnd then the whole room was clapping.
p280
aVThis is the moment that I live for in lighting.
p281
aVThe moment where it all comes together
p282
aVand we get a world that we can believe in.
p283
aa(lp284
VWe use math, science and code to create these amazing worlds.
p285
aVWe use storytelling and art to bring them to life.
p286
aVIt's this interweaving of art and science
p287
aVthat elevates the world to a place of wonder,
p288
aVa place with soul,
p289
aVa place we can believe in,
p290
aVa place where the things you imagine can become real \u2014
p291
aVand a world where a girl suddenly realizes
p292
aVnot only is she a scientist,
p293
aVbut also an artist.
p294
aa(lp295
VThank you.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Applause)

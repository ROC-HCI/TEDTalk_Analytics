VI study the future
p5
aVof crime and terrorism,
p6
aVand frankly, I'm afraid.
p7
aVI'm afraid by what I see.
p8
aVI sincerely want to believe
p9
aVthat technology can bring us
p10
aVthe techno-utopia that we've been promised,
p11
aVbut, you see,
p12
aVI've spent a career in law enforcement,
p13
aVand that's informed my perspective on things.
p14
aVI've been a street police officer,
p15
aVan undercover investigator,
p16
aVa counter-terrorism strategist,
p17
aVand I've worked in more than 70 countries
p18
aVaround the world.
p19
aVI've had to see more than my fair share
p20
aVof violence and the darker underbelly of society,
p21
aVand that's informed my opinions.
p22
aVMy work with criminals and terrorists
p23
aVhas actually been highly educational.
p24
aVThey have taught me a lot, and I'd like to be able
p25
aVto share some of these observations with you.
p26
aa(lp27
VToday I'm going to show you the flip side
p28
aVof all those technologies that we marvel at,
p29
aVthe ones that we love.
p30
aVIn the hands of the TED community,
p31
aVthese are awesome tools which will bring about
p32
aVgreat change for our world,
p33
aVbut in the hands of suicide bombers,
p34
aVthe future can look quite different.
p35
aa(lp36
VI started observing
p37
aVtechnology and how criminals were using it
p38
aVas a young patrol officer.
p39
aVIn those days, this was the height of technology.
p40
aVLaugh though you will,
p41
aVall the drug dealers and gang members
p42
aVwith whom I dealt had one of these
p43
aVlong before any police officer I knew did.
p44
aa(lp45
VTwenty years later, criminals are still using
p46
aVmobile phones, but they're also building
p47
aVtheir own mobile phone networks,
p48
aVlike this one, which has been deployed
p49
aVin all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos.
p50
aVThey have a national encrypted
p51
aVradio communications system.
p52
aVThink about that.
p53
aVThink about the innovation that went into that.
p54
aVThink about the infrastructure to build it.
p55
aVAnd then think about this:
p56
aVWhy can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco? (Laughter)
p57
aVHow is this possible? (Laughter) It makes no sense. (Applause)
p58
aa(lp59
VWe consistently underestimate
p60
aVwhat criminals and terrorists can do.
p61
aVTechnology has made our world
p62
aVincreasingly open, and for the most part,
p63
aVthat's great, but all of this openness
p64
aVmay have unintended consequences.
p65
aa(lp66
VConsider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai.
p67
aVThe men that carried that attack out were armed
p68
aVwith AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades.
p69
aVThey threw these hand grenades
p70
aVat innocent people as they sat eating in cafes
p71
aVand waited to catch trains on their way home from work.
p72
aVBut heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations.
p73
aVGuns and bombs are nothing new.
p74
aVWhat was different this time
p75
aVis the way that the terrorists used
p76
aVmodern information communications technologies
p77
aVto locate additional victims and slaughter them.
p78
aVThey were armed with mobile phones.
p79
aVThey had BlackBerries.
p80
aVThey had access to satellite imagery.
p81
aVThey had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles.
p82
aVBut perhaps their greatest innovation was this.
p83
aVWe've all seen pictures like this
p84
aVon television and in the news. This is an operations center.
p85
aVAnd the terrorists built their very own op center
p86
aVacross the border in Pakistan,
p87
aVwhere they monitored the BBC,
p88
aVal Jazeera, CNN and Indian local stations.
p89
aVThey also monitored the Internet and social media
p90
aVto monitor the progress of their attacks
p91
aVand how many people they had killed.
p92
aVThey did all of this in real time.
p93
aa(lp94
VThe innovation of the terrorist operations center
p95
aVgave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness
p96
aVand tactical advantage over the police
p97
aVand over the government.
p98
aVWhat did they do with this?
p99
aVThey used it to great effect.
p100
aa(lp101
VAt one point during the 60-hour siege,
p102
aVthe terrorists were going room to room
p103
aVtrying to find additional victims.
p104
aVThey came upon a suite on the top floor
p105
aVof the hotel, and they kicked down the door
p106
aVand they found a man hiding by his bed.
p107
aVAnd they said to him, "Who are you,
p108
aVand what are you doing here?"
p109
aVAnd the man replied,
p110
aV"I'm just an innocent schoolteacher."
p111
aVOf course, the terrorists knew
p112
aVthat no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj.
p113
aVThey picked up his identification,
p114
aVand they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room,
p115
aVwhere the terrorist war room Googled him,
p116
aVand found a picture and called their operatives
p117
aVon the ground and said,
p118
aV"Your hostage, is he heavyset?
p119
aVIs he bald in front? Does he wear glasses?"
p120
aV"Yes, yes, yes," came the answers.
p121
aVThe op center had found him and they had a match.
p122
aVHe was not a schoolteacher.
p123
aVHe was the second-wealthiest businessman in India,
p124
aVand after discovering this information,
p125
aVthe terrorist war room gave the order
p126
aVto the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai.
p127
aV("Kill him.")
p128
aa(lp129
VWe all worry about our privacy settings
p130
aVon Facebook,
p131
aVbut the fact of the matter is,
p132
aVour openness can be used against us.
p133
aVTerrorists are doing this.
p134
aVA search engine can determine
p135
aVwho shall live and who shall die.
p136
aVThis is the world that we live in.
p137
aa(lp138
VDuring the Mumbai siege,
p139
aVterrorists were so dependent on technology
p140
aVthat several witnesses reported that
p141
aVas the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand,
p142
aVthey were checking their mobile phone messages
p143
aVin the very other hand.
p144
aVIn the end, 300 people were gravely wounded
p145
aVand over 172 men, women and children
p146
aVlost their lives that day.
p147
aa(lp148
VThink about what happened.
p149
aVDuring this 60-hour siege on Mumbai,
p150
aV10 men armed not just with weapons,
p151
aVbut with technology,
p152
aVwere able to bring a city of 20 million people
p153
aVto a standstill.
p154
aVTen people brought 20 million people
p155
aVto a standstill, and this traveled around the world.
p156
aVThis is what radicals can do with openness.
p157
aa(lp158
VThis was done nearly four years ago.
p159
aVWhat could terrorists do today
p160
aVwith the technologies available that we have?
p161
aVWhat will they do tomorrow?
p162
aVThe ability of one to affect many
p163
aVis scaling exponentially,
p164
aVand it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil.
p165
aa(lp166
VIt's not just about terrorism, though.
p167
aVThere's also been a big paradigm shift in crime.
p168
aVYou see, you can now commit more crime as well.
p169
aVIn the old days, it was a knife and a gun.
p170
aVThen criminals moved to robbing trains.
p171
aVYou could rob 200 people on a train, a great innovation.
p172
aVMoving forward, the Internet
p173
aVallowed things to scale even more.
p174
aVIn fact, many of you will remember
p175
aVthe recent Sony PlayStation hack.
p176
aVIn that incident, over 100 million people were robbed.
p177
aVThink about that.
p178
aVWhen in the history of humanity
p179
aVhas it ever been possible for one person
p180
aVto rob 100 million?
p181
aa(lp182
VOf course, it's not just about stealing things.
p183
aVThere are other avenues of technology
p184
aVthat criminals can exploit.
p185
aVMany of you will remember this super cute video
p186
aVfrom the last TED,
p187
aVbut not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute.
p188
aVThey don't all have drumsticks.
p189
aVSome can be armed with HD cameras
p190
aVand do countersurveillance on protesters,
p191
aVor, as in this little bit of movie magic,
p192
aVquadcopters can be loaded with firearms
p193
aVand automatic weapons.
p194
aVLittle robots are cute when they play music to you.
p195
aVWhen they swarm and chase you down the block
p196
aVto shoot you, a little bit less so.
p197
aa(lp198
VOf course, criminals and terrorists weren't the first
p199
aVto give guns to robots. We know where that started.
p200
aVBut they're adapting quickly.
p201
aVRecently, the FBI arrested
p202
aVan al Qaeda affiliate in the United States,
p203
aVwho was planning on using these remote-controlled
p204
aVdrone aircraft to fly C4 explosives
p205
aVinto government buildings in the United States.
p206
aVBy the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour.
p207
aa(lp208
VEvery time a new technology is being introduced,
p209
aVcriminals are there to exploit it.
p210
aVWe've all seen 3D printers.
p211
aVWe know with them that you can print
p212
aVin many materials ranging from plastic
p213
aVto chocolate to metal and even concrete.
p214
aVWith great precision
p215
aVI actually was able to make this
p216
aVjust the other day, a very cute little ducky.
p217
aVBut I wonder to myself,
p218
aVfor those people that strap bombs to their chests
p219
aVand blow themselves up,
p220
aVhow might they use 3D printers?
p221
aa(lp222
VPerhaps like this.
p223
aVYou see, if you can print in metal,
p224
aVyou can print one of these,
p225
aVand in fact
p226
aVyou can also print one of these too.
p227
aVThe UK I know has some very strict firearms laws.
p228
aVYou needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore.
p229
aVYou just bring the 3D printer
p230
aVand print the gun while you're here,
p231
aVand, of course, the magazines for your bullets.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut as these get bigger in the future,
p234
aVwhat other items will you be able to print?
p235
aVThe technologies are allowing bigger printers.
p236
aa(lp237
VAs we move forward,
p238
aVwe'll see new technologies also, like the Internet of Things.
p239
aVEvery day we're connecting more and more of our lives
p240
aVto the Internet, which means
p241
aVthat the Internet of Things will soon be
p242
aVthe Internet of Things To Be Hacked.
p243
aVAll of the physical objects in our space
p244
aVare being transformed into information technologies,
p245
aVand that has a radical implication for our security,
p246
aVbecause more connections to more devices
p247
aVmeans more vulnerabilities.
p248
aVCriminals understand this.
p249
aVTerrorists understand this. Hackers understand this.
p250
aVIf you control the code, you control the world.
p251
aVThis is the future that awaits us.
p252
aa(lp253
VThere has not yet been an operating system
p254
aVor a technology that hasn't been hacked.
p255
aVThat's troubling, since the human body itself
p256
aVis now becoming an information technology.
p257
aVAs we've seen here, we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs.
p258
aVEvery year, thousands of cochlear implants,
p259
aVdiabetic pumps, pacemakers
p260
aVand defibrillators are being implanted in people.
p261
aVIn the United States, there are 60,000 people
p262
aVwho have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet.
p263
aVThe defibrillators allow a physician at a distance
p264
aVto give a shock to a heart
p265
aVin case a patient needs it.
p266
aVBut if you don't need it,
p267
aVand somebody else gives you the shock,
p268
aVit's not a good thing.
p269
aa(lp270
VOf course, we're going to go even deeper than the human body.
p271
aVWe're going down to the cellular level these days.
p272
aVUp until this point, all the technologies
p273
aVI've been talking about have been silicon-based, ones and zeroes,
p274
aVbut there's another operating system out there:
p275
aVthe original operating system, DNA.
p276
aVAnd to hackers, DNA is just another operating system
p277
aVwaiting to be hacked.
p278
aVIt's a great challenge for them.
p279
aVThere are people already working on hacking the software of life,
p280
aVand while most of them are doing this to great good
p281
aVand to help us all,
p282
aVsome won't be.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo how will criminals abuse this?
p285
aVWell, with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things.
p286
aVFor example, I predict that we will move away
p287
aVfrom a plant-based narcotics world
p288
aVto a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore?
p289
aVYou can just take the DNA code from marijuana
p290
aVor poppies or coca leaves
p291
aVand cut and past that gene
p292
aVand put it into yeast,
p293
aVand you can take those yeast
p294
aVand make them make the cocaine for you,
p295
aVor the marijuana, or any other drug.
p296
aVSo how we use yeast in the future
p297
aVis going to be really interesting.
p298
aVIn fact, we may have some really interesting bread and beer
p299
aVas we go into this next century.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously.
p302
aVIt was proceeding at Moore's Law pace,
p303
aVbut then in 2008, something changed.
p304
aVThe technologies got better,
p305
aVand now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace
p306
aVfive times that of Moore's Law.
p307
aVThat has significant implications for us.
p308
aa(lp309
VIt took us 30 years to get from
p310
aVthe introduction of the personal computer
p311
aVto the level of cybercrime we have today,
p312
aVbut looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly,
p313
aVand knowing criminals and terrorists as I do,
p314
aVwe may get there a lot faster
p315
aVwith biocrime in the future.
p316
aVIt will be easy for anybody to go ahead
p317
aVand print their own bio-virus,
p318
aVenhanced versions of ebola or anthrax,
p319
aVweaponized flu.
p320
aa(lp321
VWe recently saw a case where some researchers
p322
aVmade the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.
p323
aVIt already has a 70 percent mortality rate
p324
aVif you get it, but it's hard to get.
p325
aVEngineers, by moving around a small number
p326
aVof genetic changes,
p327
aVwere able to weaponize it
p328
aVand make it much more easy for human beings to catch,
p329
aVso that not thousands of people would die,
p330
aVbut tens of millions.
p331
aVYou see, you can go ahead and create
p332
aVnew pandemics, and the researchers who did this
p333
aVwere so proud of their accomplishments,
p334
aVthey wanted to publish it openly
p335
aVso that everybody could see this
p336
aVand get access to this information.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut it goes deeper than that.
p339
aVDNA researcher Andrew Hessel
p340
aVhas pointed out quite rightly
p341
aVthat if you can use cancer treatments,
p342
aVmodern cancer treatments,
p343
aVto go after one cell while leaving all the other cells
p344
aVaround it intact,
p345
aVthen you can also go after any one person's cell.
p346
aVPersonalized cancer treatments
p347
aVare the flip side of personalized bioweapons,
p348
aVwhich means you can attack any one individual,
p349
aVincluding all the people in this picture.
p350
aVHow will we protect them in the future?
p351
aa(lp352
VWhat to do? What to do about all this?
p353
aVThat's what I get asked all the time.
p354
aVFor those of you who follow me on Twitter,
p355
aVI will be tweeting out the answer later on today. (Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VActually, it's a bit more complex than that,
p358
aVand there are no magic bullets.
p359
aVI don't have all the answers,
p360
aVbut I know a few things.
p361
aVIn the wake of 9/11,
p362
aVthe best security minds
p363
aVput together all their innovation
p364
aVand this is what they created for security.
p365
aVIf you're expecting the people who built this to protect you
p366
aVfrom the coming robopocalypse \u2014 (Laughter)
p367
aV\u2014 uh, you may want to have a backup plan. (Laughter)
p368
aVJust saying. Just think about that. (Applause)
p369
aa(lp370
VLaw enforcement is currently a closed system.
p371
aVIt's nation-based, while the threat is international.
p372
aVPolicing doesn't scale globally. At least, it hasn't,
p373
aVand our current system of guns, border guards, big gates and fences
p374
aVare outdated in the new world into which we're moving.
p375
aVSo how might we prepare for some of these specific threats,
p376
aVlike attacking a president or a prime minister?
p377
aVThis would be the natural government response,
p378
aVto hide away all our government leaders
p379
aVin hermetically sealed bubbles.
p380
aVBut this is not going to work.
p381
aVThe cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial.
p382
aVAnybody will have it and we will all have them in the future.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this.
p385
aVWhat happens if we were to take
p386
aVthe President's DNA, or a king or queen's,
p387
aVand put it out to a group of a few hundred
p388
aVtrusted researchers so they could
p389
aVstudy that DNA and do penetration testing against it
p390
aVas a means of helping our leaders?
p391
aVOr what if we sent it out to a few thousand?
p392
aVOr, controversially, and not without its risks,
p393
aVwhat happens if we just gave it to the whole public?
p394
aVThen we could all be engaged in helping.
p395
aa(lp396
VWe've already seen examples of this working well.
p397
aVThe Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project
p398
aVis staffed by journalists and citizens
p399
aVwhere they are crowd-sourcing
p400
aVwhat dictators and terrorists are doing
p401
aVwith public funds around the world,
p402
aVand, in a more dramatic case,
p403
aVwe've seen in Mexico,
p404
aVa country that has been racked
p405
aVby 50,000 narcotics-related murders
p406
aVin the past six years.
p407
aVThey're killing so many people
p408
aVthey can't even afford to bury them all
p409
aVin anything but these unmarked graves
p410
aVlike this one outside of Ciudad Juarez.
p411
aVWhat can we do about this? The government has proven ineffective.
p412
aVSo in Mexico, citizens, at great risk to themselves,
p413
aVare fighting back to build an effective solution.
p414
aVThey're crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers.
p415
aa(lp416
VWhether or not you realize it,
p417
aVwe are at the dawn of a technological arms race,
p418
aVan arms race between people
p419
aVwho are using technology for good
p420
aVand those who are using it for ill.
p421
aVThe threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now.
p422
aVI can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are.
p423
aa(lp424
VMy personal belief is that,
p425
aVrather than having a small, elite force
p426
aVof highly trained government agents
p427
aVhere to protect us all,
p428
aVwe're much better off
p429
aVhaving average and ordinary citizens
p430
aVapproaching this problem as a group
p431
aVand seeing what we can do.
p432
aVIf we all do our part,
p433
aVI think we'll be in a much better space.
p434
aVThe tools to change the world
p435
aVare in everybody's hands.
p436
aVHow we use them is not just up to me,
p437
aVit's up to all of us.
p438
aa(lp439
VThis was a technology I would frequently deploy
p440
aVas a police officer.
p441
aVThis technology has become outdated in our current world.
p442
aVIt doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally,
p443
aVand it surely doesn't work virtually.
p444
aa(lp445
VWe've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism.
p446
aVThey call for a shift to a more open form
p447
aVand a more participatory form of law enforcement.
p448
aVSo I invite you to join me.
p449
aVAfter all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals.
p450
aa(lp451
VThank you. (Applause)

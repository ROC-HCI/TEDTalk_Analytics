VI'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor,
p5
aVand you may think that sculptors,
p6
aVwell, they deal with meta, they deal with objects,
p7
aVthey deal with bodies,
p8
aVbut I think, really, what I care about most
p9
aVis making space, and that's what I've called this talk:
p10
aVMaking Space.
p11
aVSpace that exists within us,
p12
aVand without us.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, when I was a child,
p15
aVI don't know how many of you grew up in the '50s,
p16
aVbut I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest. (Laughter)
p17
aVIt's a really bad idea. I mean, after lunch, you're, you know,
p18
aVyou're six, and you want to go and climb a tree.
p19
aVBut I had to go upstairs, this tiny little room
p20
aVthat was actually made out of an old balcony,
p21
aVso it was incredibly hot, small and light,
p22
aVand I had to lie there. It was ridiculous.
p23
aVBut anyway, for some reason, I promised myself
p24
aVthat I wasn't going to move,
p25
aVthat I was going to do this thing that Mummy
p26
aVwanted me to do.
p27
aVAnd there I was, lying there in this tiny space,
p28
aVhot, dark, claustrophobic, matchbox-sized, behind my eyes,
p29
aVbut it was really weird, like, after this went on
p30
aVfor days, weeks, months, that space would get bigger
p31
aVand darker and cooler
p32
aVuntil I really looked forward to that half an hour
p33
aVof enforced immobility and rest,
p34
aVand I really looked forward to going to that place
p35
aVof darkness.
p36
aa(lp37
VDo you mind if we do something completely different?
p38
aVCan we all just close our eyes for a minute?
p39
aVNow, this isn't going to be freaky.
p40
aVIt isn't some cultic thing. (Laughter)
p41
aVIt's just, it's just, I just would like us all to go there.
p42
aVSo I'm going to do it too. We'll all be there together.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo close your eyes for a minute.
p45
aVHere we are, in a space,
p46
aVthe subjective, collective space of the darkness of the body.
p47
aVI think of this as the place of imagination,
p48
aVof potential,
p49
aVbut what are its qualities?
p50
aVIt is objectless. There are no things in it.
p51
aVIt is dimensionless. It is limitless.
p52
aVIt is endless.
p53
aa(lp54
VOkay, open your eyes.
p55
aa(lp56
VThat's the space that I think sculpture \u2014
p57
aVwhich is a bit of a paradox, sculpture that is about
p58
aVmaking material propositions \u2014
p59
aVbut I think that's the space
p60
aVthat sculpture can connect us with.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, imagine we're in the middle of America.
p63
aVYou're asleep. You wake up,
p64
aVand without lifting your head from the earth
p65
aVon your sleeping bag, you can see for 70 miles.
p66
aVThis is a dry lake bed.
p67
aVI was young. I'd just finished art school.
p68
aVI wanted to do something that was working
p69
aVdirectly with the world, directly with place.
p70
aVThis was a wonderful place, because it was a place
p71
aVwhere you could imagine that you were the
p72
aVfirst person to be there.
p73
aVIt was a place where nothing very much had happened.
p74
aVAnyway, bear with me.
p75
aVI picked up a hand-sized stone,
p76
aVthrew it as far as I was able,
p77
aVit was about 22 meters.
p78
aVI then cleared all the stones within that radius
p79
aVand made a pile.
p80
aVAnd that was the pile, by the way.
p81
aVAnd then, I stood on the pile,
p82
aVand threw all of those rocks out again,
p83
aVand here is rearranged desert.
p84
aa(lp85
VYou could say, well, it doesn't look very different
p86
aVfrom when he started.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVWhat's all the fuss about?
p89
aVIn fact, Chris was worried and said,
p90
aV"Look, don't show them that slide,
p91
aVbecause they're just going to think you're another one of
p92
aVthose crazy modern artists who doesn't do much.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VBut the fact is, this is evidence
p96
aVof a living body on other bodies,
p97
aVrocks that have been the subject of geological formation,
p98
aVerosion, the action of time on objects.
p99
aVThis is a place, in a way, that I just
p100
aVwould like you to, in a way, look at differently
p101
aVbecause of this event that has happened in it,
p102
aVa human event,
p103
aVand in general, it just asks us to look again
p104
aVat this world, so different from, in a way,
p105
aVthe world that we have been sharing with each other,
p106
aVthe technological world,
p107
aVto look again at the elemental world.
p108
aVThe elemental world that we all live in is that space
p109
aVthat we all visited together, the darkness of the body.
p110
aVI wanted to start again with that environment,
p111
aVthe environment of the intimate, subjective space
p112
aVthat each of us lives in, but from the other side
p113
aVof appearance.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo here is a daily activity of the studio.
p116
aVYou can see I don't do much. I'm just standing there,
p117
aVagain with my eyes closed, and other people
p118
aVare molding me, evidential.
p119
aVThis is an indexical register of a lived moment
p120
aVof a body in time.
p121
aa(lp122
VCan we map that space, using the language of neutrinos
p123
aVor cosmic rays, taking the bounding condition of the body
p124
aVas its limit, but in complete reversal of, in a way,
p125
aVthe most traditional Greek idea of pointing?
p126
aVIn the old days they used to take a lump of Pentelic marble
p127
aVand drill from the surface in order to identify the skin,
p128
aVthe appearance,
p129
aVwhat Aristotle defined as the distinction
p130
aVbetween substance and appearance,
p131
aVthe thing that makes things visible,
p132
aVbut here we're working from the other side.
p133
aa(lp134
VOr can we do it as an exclusive membrane?
p135
aVThis is a lead case made around the space
p136
aVthat my body occupied, but it's now void.
p137
aVThis is a work called "Learning To See."
p138
aVIt's a bit of, well, we could call it night,
p139
aVwe could call it the 96 percent of gravity
p140
aVthat we don't know about, dark matter,
p141
aVplaced in space, anyway, another version of a human space
p142
aVin space at large, but I don't know if you can see,
p143
aVthe eyes are indicated, they're closed.
p144
aVIt's called "Learning To See" because it's about an object
p145
aVthat hopefully works reflexively and talks about that
p146
aVvision or connection with the darkness of the body
p147
aVthat I see as a space of potential.
p148
aa(lp149
VCan we do it another way, using the language
p150
aVof particles around a nucleus, and talk about the body
p151
aVas an energy center?
p152
aVNo longer about statues, no longer having to take that
p153
aVduty of standing, the standing of a human body,
p154
aVor the standing of a statue, release it,
p155
aVallow it to be an energy field, a space in space
p156
aVthat talks about human life, between becoming an entropy
p157
aVas a sort of concentration of attention,
p158
aVa human place of possibility in space at large.
p159
aa(lp160
VIs there another way?
p161
aVDark matter now placed against a horizon.
p162
aVIf minds live in bodies, if bodies live in clothes,
p163
aVand then in rooms, and then in buildings,
p164
aVand then in cities, do they also have a final skin,
p165
aVand is that skin perceptual?
p166
aVThe horizon.
p167
aVAnd is art about
p168
aVtrying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon?
p169
aVCan we use, in a way, a body as an empty catalyst
p170
aVfor a kind of empathy with the experience
p171
aVof space-time as it is lived, as I am standing here
p172
aVin front of you trying to feel and make a connection
p173
aVin this space-time that we are sharing,
p174
aVcan we use, at it were, the memory of a body,
p175
aVof a human space in space to catalyze
p176
aVan experience, again, firsthand experience,
p177
aVof elemental time.
p178
aVHuman time, industrial time, tested against
p179
aVthe time of the tides, in which these memories
p180
aVof a particular body, that could be any body,
p181
aVmultiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction,
p182
aVmany times, placed over three square miles,
p183
aVa mile out to sea,
p184
aVdisappearing, in different conditions of day and night.
p185
aVYou can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey,
p186
aVjust outside Liverpool.
p187
aVAnd there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like
p188
aVon a typical afternoon.
p189
aVThe pieces appear and disappear,
p190
aVbut maybe more importantly \u2014
p191
aVthis is just looking north from the center of the installation \u2014
p192
aVthey create a field, a field that involves
p193
aVliving and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation,
p194
aVa relation with each other and a relation with that limit,
p195
aVthe edge, the horizon.
p196
aa(lp197
VJust moving on, is it possible,
p198
aVtaking that idea of mind, body, body-building,
p199
aVto supplant the first body,
p200
aVthe biological body, with the second,
p201
aVthe body of architecture and the built environment.
p202
aa(lp203
VThis is a work called "Room for the Great Australian Desert."
p204
aVIt's in an undefined location
p205
aVand I've never published where it is.
p206
aVIt's an object for the mind.
p207
aVI think of it as a 21st-century Buddha.
p208
aVAgain, the darkness of the body,
p209
aVnow held within this bunker shape
p210
aVof the minimum position that a body needs to occupy,
p211
aVa crouching body.
p212
aVThere's a hole at the anus, penis level.
p213
aVThere are holes at ears. There are no holes at the eyes.
p214
aVThere's a slot for the mouth. It's two and a half inches thick,
p215
aVconcrete with a void interior.
p216
aVAgain, a site found with a completely flat
p217
aV360-degree horizon.
p218
aVThis is just simply asking, again,
p219
aVas if we had arrived for the first time,
p220
aVwhat is the relationship of the human project
p221
aVto time and space?
p222
aa(lp223
VTaking that idiom of, as it were,
p224
aVthe darkness of the body transferred to architecture,
p225
aVcan you use architectural space not for living
p226
aVbut as a metaphor,
p227
aVand use its systolic, diastolic
p228
aVsmaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of
p229
aVfirsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space,
p230
aVlight and darkness?
p231
aVThis is a work of some proportion and some weight
p232
aVthat makes the body into a city, an aggregation of cells
p233
aVthat are all interconnected
p234
aVand that allow certain visual access
p235
aVat certain places.
p236
aa(lp237
VThe last work that I just wanted to share with you
p238
aVis "Blind Light," which is perhaps
p239
aVthe most open work,
p240
aVand in a conference of radical openness,
p241
aVI think maybe this is as radical as I get,
p242
aVusing light and water vapor as my materials.
p243
aVHere is a box
p244
aVfilled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure,
p245
aVwith a cloud and with very bright light.
p246
aVAs you walk towards the ever-open threshold,
p247
aVyou disappear, both to yourselves and to others.
p248
aVIf you hold your hand out in front of you,
p249
aVyou can't see it.
p250
aVIf you look down, you can't see your feet.
p251
aVYou are now consciousness without an object,
p252
aVfreed from the dimensionful
p253
aVand measured way in which life links us
p254
aVto the obligatory.
p255
aVBut this is a space that is actually filled with people,
p256
aVdisembodied voices,
p257
aVand out of that ambient environment,
p258
aVwhen people come close to your own body zone,
p259
aVvery close, they appear to you as representations.
p260
aVWhen they appear close to the edge,
p261
aVthey are representations, representations in which
p262
aVthe viewers have become the viewed.
p263
aa(lp264
VFor me, art is not about objects of high monetary exchange.
p265
aVIt's about reasserting our firsthand experience
p266
aVin present time.
p267
aVAs John Cage said,
p268
aV"We are not moving towards some kind of goal.
p269
aVWe are at the goal, and it is changing with us.
p270
aVIf art has any purpose, it is to open our eyes to that fact."
p271
aVThank you very much.
p272
aV(Applause)

VIf there's any power in design,
p5
aVthat's the power of synthesis.
p6
aVThe more complex the problem,
p7
aVthe more the need for simplicity.
p8
aVSo allow me to share three cases
p9
aVwhere we tried to apply
p10
aVdesign's power of synthesis.
p11
aa(lp12
VLet's start with the global challenge of urbanization.
p13
aVIt's a fact that people are moving towards cities.
p14
aVand even if counterintuitive, it's good news.
p15
aVEvidence shows that people are better off in cities.
p16
aVBut there's a problem that I would call
p17
aVthe "3S" menace:
p18
aVThe scale, speed, and scarcity of means
p19
aVwith which we will have to respond to this phenomenon
p20
aVhas no precedence in history.
p21
aVFor you to have an idea,
p22
aVout of the three billion  people living in cities today,
p23
aVone billion are under the line of poverty.
p24
aVBy 2030, out of the five billion people
p25
aVthat will be living in cities,
p26
aVtwo billion are going to  be under the line of poverty.
p27
aVThat means that we will have to build
p28
aVa one million-person city per week
p29
aVwith 10,000 dollars per family
p30
aVduring the next 15 years.
p31
aVA one million-person city per week
p32
aVwith 10,000 dollars per family.
p33
aVIf we don't solve this equation,
p34
aVit is not that people  will stop coming to cities.
p35
aVThey will come anyhow,
p36
aVbut they will live in slums, favelas
p37
aVand informal settlements.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo what to do? Well, an answer may come
p40
aVfrom favelas and slums themselves.
p41
aVA clue could be in this  question we were asked
p42
aV10 years ago.
p43
aVWe were asked to accommodate 100 families
p44
aVthat had been occupying illegally
p45
aVhalf a hectare in the center
p46
aVof the city of Iquique  in the north of Chile
p47
aVusing a $10,000 subsidy
p48
aVwith which we had to buy the land,
p49
aVprovide the infrastructure,
p50
aVand build the houses that,  in the best of the cases,
p51
aVwould be of around 40 square meters.
p52
aVAnd by the way, they said,
p53
aVthe cost of the land,
p54
aVbecause it's in the center of the city,
p55
aVis three times more
p56
aVthan what social housing can normally afford.
p57
aVDue to the difficulty of the question,
p58
aVwe decided to include the families
p59
aVin the process of understanding the constraints,
p60
aVand we started a participatory design process,
p61
aVand testing what was  available there in the market.
p62
aVDetached houses,
p63
aV30 families could be accommodated.
p64
aVRow houses, 60 families.
p65
aV["100 families"] The only way to accommodate all of them
p66
aVwas by building in height,
p67
aVand they threatened us
p68
aVto go on a hunger strike
p69
aVif we even dared to offer this
p70
aVas a solution,
p71
aVbecause they could not  make the tiny apartments
p72
aVexpand.
p73
aVSo the conclusion with the families \u2014
p74
aVand this is important,  not our conclusion \u2014
p75
aVwith the families, was that we had a problem.
p76
aVWe had to innovate.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo what did we do?
p79
aVWell, a middle-class family
p80
aVlives reasonably well
p81
aVin around 80 square meters,
p82
aVbut when there's no money,
p83
aVwhat the market does
p84
aVis to reduce the size of the house
p85
aVto 40 square meters.
p86
aVWhat we said was,
p87
aVwhat if,
p88
aVinstead of thinking of 40 square meters
p89
aVas a small house,
p90
aVwhy don't we consider it
p91
aVhalf of a good one?
p92
aVWhen you rephrase the problem
p93
aVas half of a good house
p94
aVinstead of a small one,
p95
aVthe key question is, which half do we do?
p96
aVAnd we thought we had  to do with public money
p97
aVthe half that families won't  be able to do individually.
p98
aVWe identified five design conditions
p99
aVthat belonged to the hard half of a house,
p100
aVand we went back to the  families to do two things:
p101
aVjoin forces and split tasks.
p102
aVOur design was something in between
p103
aVa building and a house.
p104
aVAs a building, it could pay
p105
aVfor expensive, well-located land,
p106
aVand as a house, it could expand.
p107
aVIf, in the process of not being expelled
p108
aVto the periphery while getting a house,
p109
aVfamilies kept their  network and their jobs,
p110
aVwe knew that the expansion  would begin right away.
p111
aVSo we went from this initial social housing
p112
aVto a middle-class unit achieved by families themselves
p113
aVwithin a couple of weeks.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis was our first project
p116
aVin Iquique 10 years ago.
p117
aVThis is our last project in Chile.
p118
aVDifferent designs, same principle:
p119
aVYou provide the frame,
p120
aVand from then on, families take over.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo the purpose of design,
p123
aVtrying to understand and  trying to give an answer
p124
aVto the "3S" menace,
p125
aVscale, speed, and scarcity,
p126
aVis to channel people's own building capacity.
p127
aVWe won't solve the one million people per week equation
p128
aVunless we use people's own power for building.
p129
aVSo, with the right design,
p130
aVslums and favelas may not be the problem
p131
aVbut actually the only possible solution.
p132
aVThe second case is how design can contribute
p133
aVto sustainability.
p134
aVIn 2012, we entered the competition
p135
aVfor the Angelini Innovation Center,
p136
aVand the aim was to build
p137
aVthe right environment for knowledge creation.
p138
aVIt is accepted that for such an aim,
p139
aVknowledge creation,
p140
aVinteraction among people,  face-to-face contact,
p141
aVit's important, and we agreed on that.
p142
aVBut for us, the question  of the right environment
p143
aVwas a very literal question.
p144
aVWe wanted to have a working space
p145
aVwith the right light, with the right temperature,
p146
aVwith the right air.
p147
aVSo we asked ourselves:
p148
aVDoes the typical office building
p149
aVhelp us in that sense?
p150
aVWell, how does that  building look, typically?
p151
aVIt's a collection of floors,
p152
aVone on top of each other,
p153
aVwith a core in the center
p154
aVwith elevators, stairs,  pipes, wires, everything,
p155
aVand then a glass skin on the outside
p156
aVthat, due to direct sun radiation,
p157
aVcreates a huge greenhouse effect inside.
p158
aVIn addition to that, let's say a guy
p159
aVworking on the seventh floor
p160
aVgoes every single day  through the third floor,
p161
aVbut has no idea what the guy on that floor
p162
aVis working on.
p163
aVSo we thought, well, maybe  we have to turn this scheme
p164
aVinside out.
p165
aVAnd what we did was,
p166
aVlet's have an open atrium,
p167
aVa hollowed core,
p168
aVthe same collection of floors,
p169
aVbut have the walls and the mass in the perimeter,
p170
aVso that when the sun hits,
p171
aVit's not impacting directly glass, but a wall.
p172
aVWhen you have an open atrium inside,
p173
aVyou are able to see what others are doing
p174
aVfrom within the building, and you have
p175
aVa better way to control light,
p176
aVand when you place the mass and the walls
p177
aVin the perimeter,
p178
aVthen you are preventing direct sun radiation.
p179
aVYou may also open those windows
p180
aVand get cross-ventilation.
p181
aVWe just made those openings
p182
aVof such a scale that they could work
p183
aVas elevated squares,
p184
aVoutdoor spaces throughout
p185
aVthe entire height of the building.
p186
aVNone of this is rocket science.
p187
aVYou don't require sophisticated programming.
p188
aVIt's not about technology.
p189
aVThis is just archaic,  primitive common sense,
p190
aVand by using common sense,
p191
aVwe went from 120 kilowatts
p192
aVper square meter per year,
p193
aVwhich is the typical energy consumption
p194
aVfor cooling a glass tower,
p195
aVto 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.
p196
aVSo with the right design,
p197
aVsustainability is nothing but the rigorous use
p198
aVof common sense.
p199
aVLast case I would like  to share is how design
p200
aVcan provide more comprehensive answers
p201
aVagainst natural disasters.
p202
aVYou may know that Chile, in 2010,
p203
aVwas hit by an 8.8 Richter scale
p204
aVearthquake and tsunami,
p205
aVand we were called to work
p206
aVin the reconstruction of the Constitución,
p207
aVin the southern part of the country.
p208
aVWe were given 100 days, three months,
p209
aVto design almost everything,
p210
aVfrom public buildings to public space,
p211
aVstreet grid, transportation, housing,
p212
aVand mainly how to protect the city
p213
aVagainst future tsunamis.
p214
aVThis was new in Chilean urban design,
p215
aVand there were in the  air a couple of alternatives.
p216
aVFirst one:
p217
aVForbid installation on ground zero.
p218
aVThirty million dollars spent mainly
p219
aVin land expropriation.
p220
aVThis is exactly what's being discussed in Japan nowadays,
p221
aVand if you have a disciplined population
p222
aVlike the Japanese, this may work,
p223
aVbut we know that in Chile,
p224
aVthis land is going to be  occupied illegally anyhow,
p225
aVso this alternative was  unrealistic and undesirable.
p226
aVSecond alternative: build a big wall,
p227
aVheavy infrastructure to resist
p228
aVthe energy of the waves.
p229
aVThis alternative was conveniently lobbied
p230
aVby big building companies,
p231
aVbecause it meant 42 million  dollars in contracts,
p232
aVand was also politically preferred,
p233
aVbecause it required no land expropriation.
p234
aVBut Japan proved that trying to resist
p235
aVthe force of nature is useless.
p236
aVSo this alternative was irresponsible.
p237
aVAs in the housing process,
p238
aVwe had to include the community
p239
aVin the way of finding a solution for this,
p240
aVand we started a participatory design process.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Video) [In Spanish] Loudspeaker: What kind of city do you want?
p243
aVVote for Constitución.
p244
aVGo to the Open House and express your options.
p245
aVParticipate!
p246
aa(lp247
VFisherman: I am a fisherman.
p248
aVTwenty-five fishermen work for me.
p249
aVWhere should I take them? To the forest?
p250
aa(lp251
VMan: So why can't we have a concrete defense?
p252
aVDone well, of course.
p253
aa(lp254
VMan 2: I am the history of Constitución.
p255
aVAnd you come here to tell me that I cannot keep on living here?
p256
aVMy whole family has lived here,
p257
aVI raised my children here,
p258
aVand my children will also  raise their children here.
p259
aVand my grandchildren  and everyone else will.
p260
aVBut why are you imposing this on me?
p261
aVYou! You are imposing this on me!
p262
aVIn danger zone I am not authorized to build.
p263
aVHe himself is saying that.
p264
aa(lp265
VMan 3: No, no, no, Nieves...
p266
aa(lp267
VAlejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able
p268
aVto read the subtitles, but you can tell
p269
aVfrom the body language
p270
aVthat participatory design
p271
aVis not a hippie, romantic,
p272
aVlet's-all-dream-together-about- the-future-of-the-city
p273
aVkind of thing.
p274
aVIt is actually \u2014 (Applause)
p275
aVIt is actually not even with the families
p276
aVtrying to find the right answer.
p277
aVIt is mainly trying to identify with precision
p278
aVwhat is the right question.
p279
aVThere is nothing worse than answering well
p280
aVthe wrong question.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo it was pretty obvious after this process
p283
aVthat, well, we chicken out here
p284
aVand go away because it's too tense,
p285
aVor we go even further in asking,
p286
aVwhat else is bothering you?
p287
aVWhat other problems do you have
p288
aVand you want us to take  care of now that the city
p289
aVwill have to be rethought from scratch?
p290
aVAnd what they said was,
p291
aVlook, fine to protect the city  against future tsunamis,
p292
aVwe really appreciate, but the next one  is going to come in, what, 20 years?
p293
aVBut every single year, we have problems
p294
aVof flooding due to rain.
p295
aVIn addition, we are in the middle
p296
aVof the forest region of the country,
p297
aVand our public space sucks.
p298
aVIt's poor and it's scarce.
p299
aVAnd the origin of the city, our identity,
p300
aVis not really connected to the buildings that fell,
p301
aVit is connected to the river,
p302
aVbut the river cannot be accessed publicly,
p303
aVbecause its shores are privately owned.
p304
aVSo we thought that we had to produce a third alternative,
p305
aVand our approach was  against geographical threats,
p306
aVhave geographical answers.
p307
aVWhat if, in between the city
p308
aVand the sea
p309
aVwe have a forest,
p310
aVa forest that doesn't try to resist
p311
aVthe energy of nature,
p312
aVbut dissipates it by introducing friction?
p313
aVA forest that may be able to laminate the water
p314
aVand prevent the flooding?
p315
aVThat may pay the historical debt of public space,
p316
aVand that may provide, finally,
p317
aVdemocratic access to the river.
p318
aVSo as a conclusion of the participatory design,
p319
aVthe alternative was validated politically and socially,
p320
aVbut there was still the problem of the cost:
p321
aV48 million dollars.
p322
aVSo what we did was a survey
p323
aVin the public investment system,
p324
aVand found out that there  were three ministries
p325
aVwith three projects in  the exact same place,
p326
aVnot knowing of the existence  of the other projects.
p327
aVThe sum of them: 52 million dollars.
p328
aVSo design's power of synthesis
p329
aVis trying to make a more efficient use
p330
aVof the scarcest resource in cities,
p331
aVwhich is not money but coordination.
p332
aVBy doing so, we were able to save
p333
aVfour million dollars, and  that is why the forest
p334
aVis today under construction.
p335
aV(Applause)
p336
aa(lp337
VSo be it the force of self construction,
p338
aVthe force of common sense,
p339
aVor the force of nature, all these forces
p340
aVneed to be translated into form,
p341
aVand what that form is modeling and shaping
p342
aVis not cement, bricks, or wood.
p343
aVIt is life itself.
p344
aVDesign's power of synthesis
p345
aVis just an attempt to put
p346
aVat the innermost core of architecture
p347
aVthe force of life.
p348
aa(lp349
VThank you so much.

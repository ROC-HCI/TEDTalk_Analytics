VI live in Washington, D.C.,
p5
aVbut I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa, in India.
p6
aVMy father was a government worker.
p7
aVMy mother could not read or write, but she
p8
aVwould say to me, "A king is  worshipped only in his
p9
aVown kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."
p10
aVSo I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.
p11
aVBut I almost didn't go to college
p12
aVuntil an aunt offered financial help.
p13
aa(lp14
VI went to study in Sambalpur,
p15
aVthe largest town in the region,
p16
aVwhere, already in college, I saw a television for the first time.
p17
aVI had dreams of going to the United States
p18
aVfor higher studies.
p19
aVWhen the opportunity came,
p20
aVI crossed two oceans, with borrowed money
p21
aVfor airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.
p22
aVIn the U.S., I worked in a research center,
p23
aVpart-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.
p24
aVAnd with the little I earned, I would
p25
aVfinance myself and then I would send
p26
aVmoney home to my brother and my father.
p27
aa(lp28
VMy story is not unique.
p29
aVThere are millions of people who migrate each year.
p30
aVWith the help of the family, they cross oceans,
p31
aVthey cross deserts, they cross  rivers, they cross mountains.
p32
aVThey risk their lives to realize a dream,
p33
aVand that dream is as simple as having a
p34
aVdecent job somewhere so they can send money home
p35
aVand help the family,
p36
aVwhich has helped them before.
p37
aa(lp38
VThere are 232 million international  migrants in the world.
p39
aVThese are people who live in a country
p40
aVother than their country of birth.
p41
aVIf there was a country made up of
p42
aVonly international migrants,
p43
aVthat would be larger, in population,
p44
aVthan Brazil.
p45
aVThat would be larger, in its size
p46
aVof the economy, than France.
p47
aVSome 180 million of them, from poor countries,
p48
aVsend money home regularly.
p49
aa(lp50
VThose sums of money are called remittances.
p51
aVHere is a fact that might surprise you:
p52
aV413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollars
p53
aVwas the amount of remittances sent last year
p54
aVby migrants to developing countries.
p55
aVMigrants from developing countries,
p56
aVmoney sent to developing countries \u2014
p57
aV413 billion dollars.
p58
aVThat's a remarkable number because
p59
aVthat is three times the size of
p60
aVthe total of development aid money.
p61
aVAnd yet, you and I,
p62
aVmy colleagues in Washington,
p63
aVwe endlessly debate and
p64
aVdiscuss about development aid,
p65
aVwhile we ignore remittances as small change.
p66
aa(lp67
VTrue, people send 200 dollars per month,
p68
aVon average. But, repeated month after month,
p69
aVby millions of people,
p70
aVthese sums of money add up to rivers  of foreign currency.
p71
aVSo India, last year, received 72  billion dollars, larger than
p72
aVits IT exports.
p73
aVIn Egypt remittances are three times
p74
aVthe size of revenues from the Suez Canal.
p75
aVIn Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.
p76
aVAnd in poorer countries, smaller  countries, fragile countries,
p77
aVconflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,
p78
aVas in Somalia or in Haiti.
p79
aa(lp80
VNo wonder these flows have huge
p81
aVimpacts on economies and on poor people.
p82
aVRemittances, unlike private investment money,
p83
aVthey don't flow back at the first
p84
aVsign of trouble in the country.
p85
aVThey actually act like an insurance.
p86
aVWhen the family is in trouble,
p87
aVfacing hardship, facing hard times,
p88
aVremittances increase, they act like an insurance.
p89
aVMigrants send more money then.
p90
aVUnlike development aid money,
p91
aVthat must go through official agencies,
p92
aVthrough governments, remittances
p93
aVdirectly reach the poor,
p94
aVreach the family,
p95
aVand often with business advice.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo in Nepal, the share of poor
p98
aVpeople was 42 percent in 1995,
p99
aVthe share of poor people in the population.
p100
aVBy 2005, a decade later, at a
p101
aVtime of political crisis, economic crisis,
p102
aVthe share of poor people went down to 31 percent.
p103
aVThat decline in poverty, most of it,
p104
aVabout half of it, is believed to be
p105
aVbecause of remittances from India,
p106
aVanother poor country.
p107
aVIn El Salvador, the school dropout
p108
aVrate among children is lower
p109
aVin families that receive remittances.
p110
aVIn Mexico and Sri Lanka,
p111
aVthe birth weight of children is higher
p112
aVamong families that receive remittances.
p113
aa(lp114
VRemittances are dollars wrapped with care.
p115
aVMigrants send money home for food,
p116
aVfor buying necessities, for building houses,
p117
aVfor funding education, for funding
p118
aVhealthcare for the elderly, for business
p119
aVinvestments for friends and family.
p120
aVMigrants send even more money home
p121
aVfor special occasions like a surgery
p122
aVor a wedding. And migrants also send
p123
aVmoney, perhaps far too many times,
p124
aVfor unexpected funerals that
p125
aVthey cannot attend.
p126
aa(lp127
VMuch as these flows do all that good,
p128
aVthere are barriers to these
p129
aVflows of remittances, these
p130
aV400 billion dollars of remittances.
p131
aVForemost among them is
p132
aVthe exorbitant cost of sending money home.
p133
aVMoney transfer companies structure
p134
aVtheir fees to milk the poor.
p135
aVThey will say, "Up to 500 dollars
p136
aVif you want to send, we will charge you
p137
aV30 dollars fixed."
p138
aVIf you are poor and if you have  only 200 dollars to send,
p139
aVyou have to pay that $30 fee.
p140
aVThe global average cost of sending
p141
aVmoney is eight percent.
p142
aVThat means you send 100 dollars,
p143
aVthe family on the other side receives only
p144
aV92 dollars.
p145
aVTo send money to Africa,
p146
aVthe cost is even higher:
p147
aV12 percent.
p148
aVTo send money within Africa,
p149
aVthe cost is even higher:
p150
aVover 20 percent.
p151
aVFor example, sending money from Benin  to Nigeria.
p152
aVAnd then there is the case of Venezuela, where,
p153
aVbecause of exchange controls,
p154
aVyou send 100 dollars and you
p155
aVare lucky if the family on the other side
p156
aVreceives even 10 dollars.
p157
aVOf course, nobody sends money to Venezuela
p158
aVthrough the official channel.
p159
aVIt all goes in suitcases.
p160
aVWhereever costs are high,
p161
aVmoney goes underground.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd what is worse,
p164
aVmany developing countries actually
p165
aVhave a blanket ban on sending money
p166
aVout of the country.
p167
aVMany rich nations also have a
p168
aVblanket ban on sending money  to specific countries.
p169
aVSo, is it that there are no options,
p170
aVno better options, cheaper options, to send money?
p171
aa(lp172
VThere are.
p173
aVM-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money
p174
aVand receive money at a fixed cost of only
p175
aV60 cents per transaction.
p176
aVU.S. Fed started a program with Mexico
p177
aVto enable money service businesses
p178
aVto send money to Mexico
p179
aVfor a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.
p180
aVAnd yet, these faster, cheaper, better options
p181
aVcan't be applied internationally
p182
aVbecause of the fear of money laundering,
p183
aVeven though there is little data
p184
aVto support any connection, any significant
p185
aVconnection between money laundering
p186
aVand these small remittance transactions.
p187
aVMany international banks now
p188
aVare wary of hosting bank accounts
p189
aVof money service businesses, especially
p190
aVthose serving Somalia.
p191
aa(lp192
VSomalia, a country where the
p193
aVper capita income is only 250 dollars per year.
p194
aVMonthly remittances, on average, to Somalia
p195
aVis larger than that amount.
p196
aVRemittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.
p197
aVAnd yet, this is an example of
p198
aVthe right hand giving a lot of aid,
p199
aVwhile the left hand is cutting the lifeblood
p200
aVto that economy, through regulations.
p201
aVThen there is the case of poor people from villages, like me.
p202
aVIn the villages, the only place where you can
p203
aVget money is through the post office.
p204
aVMost of the governments in the world
p205
aVhave allowed their post offices to have
p206
aVexclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.
p207
aVSo, if I have to send money to my
p208
aVfather in the village, I must send money
p209
aVthrough that particular money transfer company,
p210
aVeven if the cost is high.
p211
aVI cannot go to a cheaper option.
p212
aVThis has to go.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo, what can international organizations and
p215
aVsocial entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost
p216
aVof sending money home?
p217
aVFirst, relax regulations on small remittances under 1,000 dollars.
p218
aVGovernments should recognize that
p219
aVsmall remittances are not money laundering.
p220
aVSecond, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships
p221
aVbetween their post office and the money  transfer company.
p222
aVFor that matter, between the post office
p223
aVand any national banking system that
p224
aVhas a large network that serves the poor.
p225
aVIn fact, they should promote competition,
p226
aVopen up the partnership so that
p227
aVwe will bring down costs like we did,
p228
aVlike they did, in the telecommunications industry.
p229
aVYou have seen what has happened there.
p230
aVThird, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations
p231
aVshould create a remittance platform
p232
aVon a nonprofit basis.
p233
aVThey should create a nonprofit
p234
aVremittance platform to serve the money transfer
p235
aVcompanies so that they can send money at a low cost,
p236
aVwhile complying with all the complex
p237
aVregulations all over the world.
p238
aa(lp239
VThe development community should
p240
aVset a goal of reducing remittance costs
p241
aVto one percent from the current eight percent.
p242
aVIf we reduce costs to one percent,
p243
aVthat would release a saving of  30 billion dollars per year.
p244
aVThirty billion dollars, that's  larger than the entire
p245
aVbilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.
p246
aVThat is larger than, or almost similar to,
p247
aVthe total aid budget of the United States government,
p248
aVthe largest donor on the planet.
p249
aVActually, the savings would be larger
p250
aVthan that 30 billion because remittance channels
p251
aVare also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnother major impediment to the
p254
aVflow of remittances reaching the family
p255
aVis the large and exorbitant
p256
aVand illegal cost of recruitment,
p257
aVfees that migrants pay, migrant workers
p258
aVpay to laborers who found them the job.
p259
aa(lp260
VI was in Dubai a few years ago.
p261
aVI visited a camp for workers.
p262
aVIt was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.
p263
aVWorkers were coming back from
p264
aVtheir grueling day of work,
p265
aVand I struck a conversation
p266
aVwith a Bangladeshi construction worker.
p267
aVHe was preoccupied that he is sending
p268
aVmoney home, he has been
p269
aVsending money home for a few months now,
p270
aVand the money is mostly going
p271
aVto the recruitment agent, to the labor agent
p272
aVwho found him that job.
p273
aVAnd in my mind, I could picture
p274
aVthe wife waiting for
p275
aVthe monthly remittance.
p276
aVThe remittance arrives.
p277
aVShe takes the money and hands
p278
aVit over to the recruitment agent,
p279
aVwhile the children are looking on.
p280
aVThis has to stop.
p281
aa(lp282
VIt is not only construction  workers from Bangladesh,
p283
aVit is all the workers. There are millions of migrant
p284
aVworkers who suffer from this problem.
p285
aVA construction worker from Bangladesh,
p286
aVon an average, pays about 4,000  dollars in recruitment fees
p287
aVfor a job that gives him only 2,000  dollars per year in income.
p288
aVThat means that for the two years or three years
p289
aVof his life, he is basically sending money
p290
aVto pay for the recruitment fees.
p291
aVThe family doesn't get to see any of it.
p292
aa(lp293
VIt is not only Dubai, it is the dark
p294
aVunderbelly of every major city in the world.
p295
aVIt is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,
p296
aVit is workers from all over the world.
p297
aVIt is not only men.
p298
aVWomen are especially vulnerable to
p299
aVrecruitment malpractices.
p300
aa(lp301
VOne of the most exciting and newest
p302
aVthing happening in the area of remittances
p303
aVis how to mobilize, through innovation,
p304
aVdiaspora saving and diaspora giving.
p305
aVMigrants send money home,
p306
aVbut they also save a large amount of
p307
aVmoney where they live.
p308
aVAnnually, migrant savings are estimated
p309
aVto be 500 billion dollars.
p310
aVMost of that money is parked in
p311
aVbank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.
p312
aVIf a country were to come  and offer a three percent
p313
aVor four percent interest rate, and then say
p314
aVthat the money would be used for building schools,
p315
aVroads, airports, train systems
p316
aVin the country of origin, a lot
p317
aVof migrants would be interested in
p318
aVparting with their money because
p319
aVit's not only financial gains that
p320
aVgive them an opportunity
p321
aVto stay engaged with their country's development.
p322
aVRemittance channels can be used
p323
aVto sell these bonds to migrants
p324
aVbecause when they come
p325
aVon a monthly basis to send remittances,
p326
aVthat's when you can actually sell it to them.
p327
aVYou can also do the same
p328
aVfor mobilizing diaspora giving.
p329
aVI would love to invest in a
p330
aVbullet train system in India
p331
aVand I would love to contribute to efforts
p332
aVto fight malaria in my village.
p333
aVRemittances are a great way of
p334
aVsharing prosperity between places
p335
aVin a targeted way that benefits
p336
aVthose who need them most.
p337
aa(lp338
VRemittances empower people.
p339
aVWe must do all we can to make remittances
p340
aVand recruitment
p341
aVsafer and cheaper.
p342
aVAnd it can be done.
p343
aa(lp344
VAs for myself, I have been
p345
aVaway from India for two decades now.
p346
aVMy wife is a Venezuelan.
p347
aVMy children are Americans.
p348
aVIncreasingly, I feel like a global citizen.
p349
aVAnd yet, I am growing nostalgic
p350
aVabout my country of birth.
p351
aVI want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.
p352
aVMy parents are not there anymore.
p353
aVMy brothers and sisters have moved on.
p354
aVThere is no real urgency for me to send money home.
p355
aVAnd yet, from time to time,
p356
aVI send money home to friends,
p357
aVto relatives, to the village,
p358
aVto be there, to stay engaged \u2014
p359
aVthat's part of my identity.
p360
aVAnd, I'm still striving to be a poet
p361
aVfor the hardworking migrants
p362
aVand their struggle to break free
p363
aVof the cycle of poverty.
p364
aVThank you.

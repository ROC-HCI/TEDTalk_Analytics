VI run a design studio in New York.
p5
aVEvery seven years, I close it for one year
p6
aVto pursue
p7
aVsome little experiments, things that
p8
aVare always difficult to accomplish
p9
aVduring the regular working year.
p10
aVIn that year, we are not available
p11
aVfor any of our clients.
p12
aVWe are totally closed.
p13
aVAnd as you can imagine,
p14
aVit is a lovely and very energetic time.
p15
aa(lp16
VI originally had opened the studio in New York
p17
aVto combine my two loves, music and design.
p18
aVAnd we created videos and packaging
p19
aVfor many musicians that you know,
p20
aVand for even more that you've never heard of.
p21
aVAs I realized, just like with many many things in my life
p22
aVthat I actually love,
p23
aVI adapt to it.
p24
aVAnd I get, over time, bored by them.
p25
aVAnd for sure, in our case,
p26
aVour work started to look the same.
p27
aVYou see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.
p28
aVQuite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged
p29
aVin a book, in a die cut.
p30
aVSo I decided to close it down for one year.
p31
aa(lp32
VAlso is the knowledge that
p33
aVright now we spend about
p34
aVin the first 25 years of our lives learning,
p35
aVthen there is another 40 years
p36
aVthat's really reserved for working.
p37
aVAnd then tacked on at the end of it
p38
aVare about 15 years for retirement.
p39
aVAnd I thought it might be helpful
p40
aVto basically cut off five of those retirement years
p41
aVand intersperse them in between those working years.
p42
aV(Applause)
p43
aVThat's clearly enjoyable for myself.
p44
aVBut probably even more important is
p45
aVthat the work that comes out of these years
p46
aVflows back into the company
p47
aVand into society at large,
p48
aVrather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.
p49
aa(lp50
VThere is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago,
p51
aVJonathan Haidt,
p52
aVwho defined his work into three different levels.
p53
aVAnd they rang very true for me.
p54
aVI can see my work as a job. I do it for money.
p55
aVI likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.
p56
aVAnd I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.
p57
aVIn a career I'm definitely more engaged.
p58
aVBut at the same time, there will be periods when I think
p59
aVis all that really hard work really worth my while?
p60
aVWhile in the third one, in the calling,
p61
aVvery much likely I would do it also
p62
aVif I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.
p63
aa(lp64
VI am not a religious person myself,
p65
aVbut I did look for nature.
p66
aVI had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.
p67
aVLooked for something different for the second one.
p68
aVEurope and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing
p69
aVbecause I knew them too well. So Asia it was.
p70
aVThe most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia
p71
aVwere Sri Lanka and Bali.
p72
aVSri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.
p73
aVIt's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.
p74
aa(lp75
VI arrived there in September 2008,
p76
aVand pretty much started to work right away.
p77
aVThere is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.
p78
aVHowever the first thing that I needed was
p79
aVmosquito repellent typography
p80
aVbecause they were definitely around heavily.
p81
aVAnd then I needed some sort of way
p82
aVto be able to get back to all the wild dogs
p83
aVthat surround my house,
p84
aVand attacked me during my morning walks.
p85
aVSo we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.
p86
aVEvery single dog on one tee shirt.
p87
aVAs a little retaliation
p88
aVwith a just ever so slightly menacing message
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVon the back of the shirt.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VJust before I left New York
p94
aVI decided I could actually renovate my studio.
p95
aVAnd then just leave it all to them.
p96
aVAnd I don't have to do anything.
p97
aVSo I looked for furniture.
p98
aVAnd it turned out that
p99
aVall the furniture that I really liked,
p100
aVI couldn't afford.
p101
aVAnd all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.
p102
aVSo one of the things that we pursued in Bali
p103
aVwas pieces of furniture.
p104
aVThis one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.
p105
aVIt's not quite finished yet.
p106
aVAnd I think by the time this lamp came about,
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVI had finally made peace with those dogs.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VThen there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.
p112
aVIt's called Be Here Now.
p113
aVIt includes 330 compasses.
p114
aVAnd we had custom espresso cups made
p115
aVthat hide a magnet inside,
p116
aVand make those compasses go crazy,
p117
aValways centering on them.
p118
aVThen this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.
p119
aVI also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.
p120
aVAnd at the same time, I'm extremely aware
p121
aVhow boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.
p122
aVSo I will not really go too far into it.
p123
aa(lp124
VMany of you will know this TEDster,
p125
aVDanny Gilbert, whose book, actually,
p126
aVI got it through the TED book club.
p127
aVI think it took me four years
p128
aVto finally read it, while on sabbatical.
p129
aVAnd I was pleased to see
p130
aVthat he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.
p131
aVAnd I'll show you a couple of people
p132
aVthat did well by pursuing sabbaticals.
p133
aa(lp134
VThis is Ferran Adria. Many people think
p135
aVhe is right now the best chef in the world
p136
aVwith his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.
p137
aVHis restaurant is open seven months every year.
p138
aVHe closes it down for five months
p139
aVto experiment with a full kitchen staff.
p140
aVHis latest numbers are fairly impressive.
p141
aVHe can seat, throughout the year,
p142
aVhe can seat 8,000 people.
p143
aVAnd he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.
p144
aa(lp145
VIf I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,
p146
aVit's 12.5 percent of my time.
p147
aVAnd if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,
p148
aV3M since the 1930s
p149
aVis giving all their engineers
p150
aV15 percent to pursue whatever they want.
p151
aVThere is some good successes.
p152
aVScotch tape came out of this program,
p153
aVas well as Art Fry developed
p154
aVsticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.
p155
aVGoogle, of course, very famously
p156
aVgives 20 percent for their software engineers
p157
aVto pursue their own personal projects.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?
p160
aVThat's about five percent of everybody.
p161
aVSo I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.
p162
aVTalk to them about if it was successful or not.
p163
aVI've found that
p164
aVfinding out about what I'm going to like in the future,
p165
aVmy very best way is to talk to people
p166
aVwho have actually done it
p167
aVmuch better than myself envisioning it.
p168
aa(lp169
VWhen I had the idea of doing one,
p170
aVthe process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.
p171
aVAnd then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it
p172
aVso that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VIn the beginning, on the first sabbatical,
p176
aVit was rather disastrous.
p177
aVI had thought that I should do this without any plan,
p178
aVthat this vacuum of time somehow would
p179
aVbe wonderful and enticing
p180
aVfor idea generation. It was not.
p181
aVI just, without a plan, I just reacted
p182
aVto little requests, not work requests,
p183
aVthose I all said no to, but other little requests.
p184
aVSending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.
p185
aVSo I became my own intern.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd I very quickly
p189
aVmade a list of the things I was interested in,
p190
aVput them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time
p191
aVand then made a plan, very much like in grade school.
p192
aVWhat does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;
p193
aV9 to 10: future thinking.
p194
aVWas not very successful. And so on and so forth.
p195
aVAnd that actually, specifically as a starting point
p196
aVof the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.
p197
aVWhat came out of it?
p198
aVI really got close to design again.
p199
aVI had fun.
p200
aVFinancially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.
p201
aVBecause of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd probably most importantly,
p204
aVbasically everything we've done
p205
aVin the seven years following the first sabbatical
p206
aVcame out of thinking of that one single year.
p207
aVAnd I'll show you a couple of projects
p208
aVthat came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.
p209
aVOne of the strands of thinking I was involved in was
p210
aVthat sameness is so incredibly overrated.
p211
aVThis whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same
p212
aVworks for a very very few strand of companies,
p213
aVand not for everybody else.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,
p216
aVthe Rem Koolhaas-built music center
p217
aVin Porto, in Portugal.
p218
aVAnd even though I desired to do an identity
p219
aVthat doesn't use the architecture,
p220
aVI failed at that.
p221
aVAnd mostly also because I realized
p222
aVout of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where
p223
aVhe talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.
p224
aVWhich I understood after I
p225
aVtranslated it from architecture speech
p226
aVin to regular English,
p227
aVbasically as logo making.
p228
aVAnd I understood that the building itself was a logo.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo then it became quite easy.
p231
aVWe put a mask on it,
p232
aVlooked at it deep down in the ground,
p233
aVchecked it out from all sides,
p234
aVwest, north, south, east,
p235
aVtop and bottom.
p236
aVColored them in a very particular way
p237
aVby having a friend of mine write a piece of software,
p238
aVthe Casa da Musica Logo Generator.
p239
aVThat's connected to a scanner.
p240
aVYou put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.
p241
aVAnd the software, in a second,
p242
aVwill give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.
p243
aVWhich, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,
p244
aVcomes in handy, because the visual information of the logo
p245
aVand the actual poster is exactly the same.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.
p248
aVIf Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.
p249
aVOr Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,
p250
aVwho all performed there, get their own
p251
aVCasa da Musica logo.
p252
aVIt works the same internally with the president or the musical director,
p253
aVwhose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.
p254
aVThere is a full-blown orchestra
p255
aVliving inside the building.
p256
aVIt has a more transparent identity.
p257
aVThe truck they go on tour with.
p258
aVOr there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,
p259
aV12 people that remixes its own title.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd one of the handy things that came about
p262
aVwas that you could take the logo type
p263
aVand create advertising out of it.
p264
aVLike this Donna Toney poster,
p265
aVor Chopin, or Mozart,
p266
aVor La Monte Young.
p267
aVYou can take the shape and make typography out of it.
p268
aVYou can grow it underneath the skin.
p269
aVYou can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,
p270
aVor a rave underneath the house
p271
aVor a weekly program,
p272
aVas well as educational services.
p273
aa(lp274
VSecond insight. So far, until that point I had
p275
aVbeen mostly involved
p276
aVor used the language of design
p277
aVfor promotional purposes,
p278
aVwhich was fine with me.
p279
aVOn one hand I have nothing against selling.
p280
aVMy parents are both salespeople.
p281
aVBut I did feel that
p282
aVI spent so much time learning this language,
p283
aVwhy do I only promote with it?
p284
aVThere must be something else.
p285
aVAnd the whole series of work came out of it.
p286
aVSome of you might have seen it.
p287
aVI showed some of it
p288
aVat earlier TEDs before,
p289
aVunder the title "Things I've Learned in My Life So Far."
p290
aVI'll just show two now.
p291
aa(lp292
VThis is a whole wall of bananas
p293
aVat different ripenesses
p294
aVon the opening day in this gallery in New York.
p295
aVIt says, "Self-confidence produces fine results."
p296
aVThis is after a week.
p297
aVAfter two weeks,
p298
aVthree weeks, four weeks, five weeks.
p299
aVAnd you see the self confidence almost comes back,
p300
aVbut not quite.
p301
aVThese are some pictures visitors sent to me.
p302
aV(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd then the city of Amsterdam
p305
aVgave us a plaza and asked us to do something.
p306
aVWe used the stone plates as a grid
p307
aVfor our little piece.
p308
aVWe got 250,000 coins from the central bank,
p309
aVat different darknesses.
p310
aVSo we got brand new ones, shiny ones,
p311
aVmedium ones, and very old, dark ones.
p312
aVAnd with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,
p313
aVcreated this fairly floral typography
p314
aVthat spelled, "Obsessions make my life worse
p315
aVand my work better."
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd the idea of course was to
p318
aVmake the type so precious
p319
aVthat as an audience
p320
aVyou would be in between,
p321
aV"Should I really take as much money as I can?
p322
aVOr should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"
p323
aVWhile we built all this up
p324
aVduring that week, with the 100 volunteers,
p325
aVa good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza
p326
aVgot very close to it and quite loved it.
p327
aVSo when it was finally done,
p328
aVand in the first night
p329
aVa guy came with big plastic bags
p330
aVand scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,
p331
aVone of the neighbors called the police.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd the Amsterdam police
p334
aVin all their wisdom,
p335
aVcame, saw,
p336
aVand they wanted to protect the artwork.
p337
aVAnd they swept it all up and put it into custody
p338
aVat police headquarters.
p339
aV(Laughter)
p340
aVI think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here.
p341
aVThat's the police, getting rid of it all.
p342
aVSo after eight hours
p343
aVthat's pretty much all that was left
p344
aVof the whole thing.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VWe are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali.
p348
aVIt's a movie about happiness.
p349
aVAnd here we asked some nearby pigs
p350
aVto do the titles for us.
p351
aVThey weren't quite slick enough.
p352
aVSo we asked the goose to do it again,
p353
aVand hoped she would do somehow,
p354
aVa more elegant or pretty job.
p355
aVAnd I think she overdid it.
p356
aVJust a bit too ornamental.
p357
aVAnd my studio is very close to the monkey forest.
p358
aVAnd the monkeys in that monkey forest
p359
aVlooked, actually, fairly happy.
p360
aVSo we asked those guys to do it again.
p361
aVThey did a fine job, but had
p362
aVa couple of readability problems.
p363
aVSo of course whatever you don't really do yourself
p364
aVdoesn't really get done properly.
p365
aa(lp366
VThat film we'll be working on for the next two years.
p367
aVSo it's going to be a while.
p368
aVAnd of course you might think that
p369
aVdoing a film on happiness
p370
aVmight not really be worthwhile.
p371
aVThen you can of course always
p372
aVgo and see this guy.
p373
aa(lp374
VVideo: (Laughter)
p375
aVAnd I'm happy I'm alive.
p376
aVI'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.
p377
aa(lp378
VStefan Sagmeister: Thank you.

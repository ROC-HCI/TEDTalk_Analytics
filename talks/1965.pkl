VRight now
p5
aVthere is an aspiring teacher
p6
aVwho is working on a 60-page paper
p7
aVbased on some age-old education theory
p8
aVdeveloped by some dead education professor
p9
aVwondering to herself what this task
p10
aVthat she's engaging in
p11
aVhas to do with what she wants to do with her life,
p12
aVwhich is be an educator,
p13
aVchange lives, and spark magic.
p14
aVRight now there is an aspiring teacher
p15
aVin a graduate school of education
p16
aVwho is watching a professor babble on and on
p17
aVabout engagement
p18
aVin the most disengaging way possible.
p19
aVRight now
p20
aVthere's a first-year teacher at home
p21
aVwho is pouring through lesson plans
p22
aVtrying to make sense of standards,
p23
aVwho is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately,
p24
aVwhile at the same time saying to herself
p25
aVover and over again,
p26
aV"Don't smile till November,"
p27
aVbecause that's what she was taught
p28
aVin her teacher education program.
p29
aVRight now there's a student
p30
aVwho is coming up with a way
p31
aVto convince his mom or dad
p32
aVthat he's very, very sick
p33
aVand can't make it to school tomorrow.
p34
aVOn the other hand, right now
p35
aVthere are amazing educators
p36
aVthat are sharing information,
p37
aVinformation that is shared in such a beautiful way
p38
aVthat the students are sitting at the edge of their seats
p39
aVjust waiting for a bead of sweat
p40
aVto drop off the face of this person
p41
aVso they can soak up all that knowledge.
p42
aVRight now there is also a person
p43
aVwho has an entire audience rapt with attention,
p44
aVa person that is weaving a powerful narrative
p45
aVabout a world
p46
aVthat the people who are listening
p47
aVhave never imagined or seen before,
p48
aVbut if they close their eyes tightly enough,
p49
aVthey can envision that world
p50
aVbecause the storytelling is so compelling.
p51
aVRight now there's a person who can tell an audience
p52
aVto put their hands up in the air
p53
aVand they will stay there till he says,
p54
aV"Put them down."
p55
aVRight now.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo people will then say,
p58
aV"Well, Chris, you describe the guy
p59
aVwho is going through some awful training
p60
aVbut you're also describing these powerful educators.
p61
aVIf you're thinking about the world of education
p62
aVor urban education in particular,
p63
aVthese guys will probably cancel each other out,
p64
aVand then we'll be okay."
p65
aa(lp66
VThe reality is, the folks I described
p67
aVas the master teachers,
p68
aVthe master narrative builders,
p69
aVthe master storytellers
p70
aVare far removed from classrooms.
p71
aVThe folks who know the skills about how to teach
p72
aVand engage an audience
p73
aVdon't even know what teacher certification means.
p74
aVThey may not even have the degrees
p75
aVto be able to have anything
p76
aVto call an education.
p77
aVAnd that to me is sad.
p78
aVIt's sad because the people who I described,
p79
aVthey were very disinterested in the learning process,
p80
aVwant to be effective teachers,
p81
aVbut they have no models.
p82
aVI'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain.
p83
aVMark Twain says that proper preparation,
p84
aVor teaching,
p85
aVis so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good,
p86
aVit can turn awful practices into powerful ones,
p87
aVit can change men and transform them
p88
aVinto angels.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe folks who I described earlier
p91
aVgot proper preparation in teaching,
p92
aVnot in any college or university,
p93
aVbut by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage.
p94
aVGuess where those places are?
p95
aVBarber shops,
p96
aVrap concerts, and most importantly,
p97
aVin the black church.
p98
aVAnd I've been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy.
p99
aVWho here has been to a black church?
p100
aVWe got a couple of hands.
p101
aVYou go to a black church,
p102
aVtheir preacher starts off
p103
aVand he realizes that he has to engage the audience,
p104
aVso he starts off with this sort of wordplay
p105
aVin the beginning oftentimes,
p106
aVand then he takes a pause,
p107
aVand he says, "Oh my gosh, they're not quite paying attention."
p108
aVSo he says, "Can I get an amen?"
p109
aa(lp110
VAudience: Amen.
p111
aa(lp112
VChris Emdin: So I can I get an amen? Audience: Amen.
p113
aa(lp114
VCE: And all of a sudden, everybody's reawoken.
p115
aVThat preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention.
p116
aVHe drops his voice at a very, very low volume
p117
aVwhen he wants people to key into him,
p118
aVand those things are the skills that we need
p119
aVfor the most engaging teachers.
p120
aVSo why does teacher education
p121
aVonly give you theory and theory
p122
aVand tell you about standards and tell you about
p123
aVall of these things that have nothing to do
p124
aVwith the basic skills, that magic that you need
p125
aVto engage an audience, to engage a student?
p126
aVSo I make the argument that we reframe teacher education,
p127
aVthat we could focus on content, and that's fine,
p128
aVand we could focus on theories, and that's fine,
p129
aVbut content and theories
p130
aVwith the absence of the magic
p131
aVof teaching and learning means nothing.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow people oftentimes say, "Well, magic is just magic."
p134
aVThere are teachers who,
p135
aVdespite all their challenges, who have those skills,
p136
aVget into those schools and are  able to engage an audience,
p137
aVand the administrator walks by and says,
p138
aV"Wow, he's so good, I wish all my teachers could be that good."
p139
aVAnd when they try to describe what that is,
p140
aVthey just say, "He has that magic."
p141
aa(lp142
VBut I'm here to tell you
p143
aVthat magic can be taught.
p144
aVMagic can be taught.
p145
aVMagic can be taught.
p146
aVNow, how do you teach it?
p147
aVYou teach it by allowing people
p148
aVto go into those spaces
p149
aVwhere the magic is happening.
p150
aVIf you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education,
p151
aVyou've got to leave the confines of that university
p152
aVand go into the hood.
p153
aVYou've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop,
p154
aVyou've got to attend that black church,
p155
aVand you've got to view those folks
p156
aVthat have the power to engage
p157
aVand just take notes on what they do.
p158
aVAt our teacher education classes at my university,
p159
aVI've started a project where every single student
p160
aVthat comes in there sits and watches rap concerts.
p161
aVThey watch the way that the rappers move
p162
aVand talk with their hands.
p163
aVThey study the way that he walks proudly across that stage.
p164
aVThey listen to his metaphors and analogies,
p165
aVand they start learning these little things
p166
aVthat if they practice enough
p167
aVbecomes the key to magic.
p168
aVThey learn that if you just stare at a student
p169
aVand raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch,
p170
aVyou don't have to say a word
p171
aVbecause they know that that means that you want more.
p172
aVAnd if we could transform teacher education
p173
aVto focus on teaching teachers
p174
aVhow to create that magic
p175
aVthen poof! we could make dead classes come alive,
p176
aVwe could reignite imaginations,
p177
aVand we can change education.
p178
aa(lp179
VThank you.

VHello, everybody.
p5
aVI brought with me today a baby diaper.
p6
aVYou'll see why in a second.
p7
aVBaby diapers have interesting properties.
p8
aVThey can swell enormously when you add water to them,
p9
aVan experiment done by millions of kids every day.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VBut the reason why
p14
aVis that they're designed in a very clever way.
p15
aVThey're made out of a thing called a swellable material.
p16
aVIt's a special kind of material that, when you add water,
p17
aVit will swell up enormously,
p18
aVmaybe a thousand times in volume.
p19
aVAnd this is a very useful, industrial kind of polymer.
p20
aVBut what we're trying to do in my group at MIT
p21
aVis to figure out if we can do something similar to the brain.
p22
aVCan we make it bigger,
p23
aVbig enough that you can peer inside
p24
aVand see all the tiny building blocks, the biomolecules,
p25
aVhow they're organized in three dimensions,
p26
aVthe structure, the ground truth structure of the brain, if you will?
p27
aVIf we could get that,
p28
aVmaybe we could have a better understanding of how the brain is organized
p29
aVto yield thoughts and emotions
p30
aVand actions and sensations.
p31
aVMaybe we could try to pinpoint the exact changes in the brain
p32
aVthat result in diseases,
p33
aVdiseases like Alzheimer's and epilepsy and Parkinson's,
p34
aVfor which there are few treatments, much less cures,
p35
aVand for which, very often, we don't know the cause or the origins
p36
aVand what's really causing them to occur.
p37
aVNow, our group at MIT
p38
aVis trying to take a different point of view
p39
aVfrom the way neuroscience has been done over the last hundred years.
p40
aVWe're designers. We're inventors.
p41
aVWe're trying to figure out how to build technologies
p42
aVthat let us look at and repair the brain.
p43
aVAnd the reason is,
p44
aVthe brain is incredibly, incredibly complicated.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo what we've learned over the first century of neuroscience
p47
aVis that the brain is a very complicated network,
p48
aVmade out of very specialized cells called neurons
p49
aVwith very complex geometries,
p50
aVand electrical currents will flow through these complexly shaped neurons.
p51
aVFurthermore, neurons are connected in networks.
p52
aVThey're connected by little junctions called synapses that exchange chemicals
p53
aVand allow the neurons to talk to each other.
p54
aVThe density of the brain is incredible.
p55
aVIn a cubic millimeter of your brain,
p56
aVthere are about 100,000 of these neurons
p57
aVand maybe a billion of those connections.
p58
aVBut it's worse.
p59
aVSo, if you could zoom in to a neuron,
p60
aVand, of course, this is just our artist's rendition of it.
p61
aVWhat you would see are thousands and thousands of kinds of biomolecules,
p62
aVlittle nanoscale machines organized in complex, 3D patterns,
p63
aVand together they mediate those electrical pulses,
p64
aVthose chemical exchanges that allow neurons to work together
p65
aVto generate things like thoughts and feelings and so forth.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, we don't know how the neurons in the brain are organized
p68
aVto form networks,
p69
aVand we don't know how the biomolecules are organized
p70
aVwithin neurons
p71
aVto form these complex, organized machines.
p72
aVIf we really want to understand this,
p73
aVwe're going to need new technologies.
p74
aVBut if we could get such maps,
p75
aVif we could look at the organization of molecules and neurons
p76
aVand neurons and networks,
p77
aVmaybe we could really understand how the brain conducts information
p78
aVfrom sensory regions,
p79
aVmixes it with emotion and feeling,
p80
aVand generates our decisions and actions.
p81
aVMaybe we could pinpoint the exact set of molecular changes that occur
p82
aVin a brain disorder.
p83
aVAnd once we know how those molecules have changed,
p84
aVwhether they've increased in number or changed in pattern,
p85
aVwe could use those as targets for new drugs,
p86
aVfor new ways of delivering energy into the brain
p87
aVin order to repair the brain computations that are afflicted
p88
aVin patients who suffer from brain disorders.
p89
aa(lp90
VWe've all seen lots of different technologies over the last century
p91
aVto try to confront this.
p92
aVI think we've all seen brain scans
p93
aVtaken using MRI machines.
p94
aVThese, of course, have the great power that they are noninvasive,
p95
aVthey can be used on living human subjects.
p96
aVBut also, they're spatially crude.
p97
aVEach of these blobs that you see, or voxels, as they're called,
p98
aVcan contain millions and millions of neurons.
p99
aVSo it's not at the level of resolution
p100
aVwhere it can pinpoint the molecular changes that occur
p101
aVor the changes in the wiring of these networks
p102
aVthat contributes to our ability to be conscious and powerful beings.
p103
aa(lp104
VAt the other extreme, you have microscopes.
p105
aVMicroscopes, of course, will use light to look at little tiny things.
p106
aVFor centuries, they've been used to look at things like bacteria.
p107
aVFor neuroscience,
p108
aVmicroscopes are actually how neurons were discovered in the first place,
p109
aVabout 130 years ago.
p110
aVBut light is fundamentally limited.
p111
aVYou can't see individual molecules with a regular old microscope.
p112
aVYou can't look at these tiny connections.
p113
aVSo if we want to make our ability to see the brain more powerful,
p114
aVto get down to the ground truth structure,
p115
aVwe're going to need to have even better technologies.
p116
aa(lp117
VMy group, a couple years ago, started thinking:
p118
aVWhy don't we do the opposite?
p119
aVIf it's so darn complicated to zoom in to the brain,
p120
aVwhy can't we make the brain bigger?
p121
aVIt initially started
p122
aVwith two grad students in my group, Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg.
p123
aVNow many others in my group are helping with this process.
p124
aVWe decided to try to figure out if we could take polymers,
p125
aVlike the stuff in the baby diaper,
p126
aVand install it physically within the brain.
p127
aVIf we could do it just right, and you add water,
p128
aVyou can potentially blow the brain up
p129
aVto where you could distinguish those tiny biomolecules from each other.
p130
aVYou would see those connections and get maps of the brain.
p131
aVThis could potentially be quite dramatic.
p132
aa(lp133
VWe brought a little demo here.
p134
aVWe got some purified baby diaper material.
p135
aVIt's much easier just to buy it off the Internet
p136
aVthan to extract the few grains that actually occur in these diapers.
p137
aVI'm going to put just one teaspoon here
p138
aVof this purified polymer.
p139
aVAnd here we have some water.
p140
aVWhat we're going to do
p141
aVis see if this teaspoon of the baby diaper material
p142
aVcan increase in size.
p143
aVYou're going to see it increase in volume by about a thousandfold
p144
aVbefore your very eyes.
p145
aVI could pour much more of this in there,
p146
aVbut I think you've got the idea
p147
aVthat this is a very, very interesting molecule,
p148
aVand if can use it in the right way,
p149
aVwe might be able to really zoom in on the brain
p150
aVin a way that you can't do with past technologies.
p151
aa(lp152
VOK. So a little bit of chemistry now.
p153
aVWhat's going on in the baby diaper polymer?
p154
aVIf you could zoom in,
p155
aVit might look something like what you see on the screen.
p156
aVPolymers are chains of atoms arranged in long, thin lines.
p157
aVThe chains are very tiny,
p158
aVabout the width of a biomolecule,
p159
aVand these polymers are really dense.
p160
aVThey're separated by distances
p161
aVthat are around the size of a biomolecule.
p162
aVThis is very good
p163
aVbecause we could potentially move everything apart in the brain.
p164
aVIf we add water, what will happen is,
p165
aVthis swellable material is going to absorb the water,
p166
aVthe polymer chains will move apart from each other,
p167
aVand the entire material is going to become bigger.
p168
aVAnd because these chains are so tiny
p169
aVand spaced by biomolecular distances,
p170
aVwe could potentially blow up the brain
p171
aVand make it big enough to see.
p172
aa(lp173
VHere's the mystery, then:
p174
aVHow do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain
p175
aVso we can move all the biomolecules apart?
p176
aVIf we could do that,
p177
aVmaybe we could get ground truth maps of the brain.
p178
aVWe could look at the wiring.
p179
aVWe can peer inside and see the molecules within.
p180
aVTo explain this, we made some animations
p181
aVwhere we actually look at, in these artist renderings,
p182
aVwhat biomolecules might look like and how we might separate them.
p183
aVStep one: what we'd have to do, first of all,
p184
aVis attach every biomolecule, shown in brown here,
p185
aVto a little anchor, a little handle.
p186
aVWe need to pull the molecules of the brain apart from each other,
p187
aVand to do that, we need to have a little handle
p188
aVthat allows those polymers to bind to them
p189
aVand to exert their force.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, if you just take baby diaper polymer and dump it on the brain,
p192
aVobviously, it's going to sit there on top.
p193
aVSo we need to find a way to make the polymers inside.
p194
aVAnd this is where we're really lucky.
p195
aVIt turns out, you can get the building blocks,
p196
aVmonomers, as they're called,
p197
aVand if you let them go into the brain
p198
aVand then trigger the chemical reactions,
p199
aVyou can get them to form those long chains,
p200
aVright there inside the brain tissue.
p201
aVThey're going to wind their way around biomolecules
p202
aVand between biomolecules,
p203
aVforming those complex webs
p204
aVthat will allow you, eventually, to pull apart the molecules
p205
aVfrom each other.
p206
aVAnd every time one of those little handles is around,
p207
aVthe polymer will bind to the handle, and that's exactly what we need
p208
aVin order to pull the molecules apart from each other.
p209
aa(lp210
VAll right, the moment of truth.
p211
aVWe have to treat this specimen
p212
aVwith a chemical to kind of loosen up all the molecules from each other,
p213
aVand then, when we add water,
p214
aVthat swellable material is going to start absorbing the water,
p215
aVthe polymer chains will move apart,
p216
aVbut now, the biomolecules will come along for the ride.
p217
aVAnd much like drawing a picture on a balloon,
p218
aVand then you blow up the balloon,
p219
aVthe image is the same,
p220
aVbut the ink particles have moved away from each other.
p221
aVAnd that's what we've been able to do now, but in three dimensions.
p222
aa(lp223
VThere's one last trick.
p224
aVAs you can see here,
p225
aVwe've color-coded all the biomolecules brown.
p226
aVThat's because they all kind of look the same.
p227
aVBiomolecules are made out of the same atoms,
p228
aVbut just in different orders.
p229
aVSo we need one last thing
p230
aVin order to make them visible.
p231
aVWe have to bring in little tags,
p232
aVwith glowing dyes that will distinguish them.
p233
aVSo one kind of biomolecule might get a blue color.
p234
aVAnother kind of biomolecule might get a red color.
p235
aVAnd so forth.
p236
aVAnd that's the final step.
p237
aVNow we can look at something like a brain
p238
aVand look at the individual molecules,
p239
aVbecause we've moved them far apart enough from each other
p240
aVthat we can tell them apart.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo the hope here is that we can make the invisible visible.
p243
aVWe can turn things that might seem small and obscure
p244
aVand blow them up
p245
aVuntil they're like constellations of information about life.
p246
aVHere's an actual video of what it might look like.
p247
aVWe have here a little brain in a dish \u2014
p248
aVa little piece of a brain, actually.
p249
aVWe've infused the polymer in,
p250
aVand now we're adding water.
p251
aVWhat you'll see is that, right before your eyes \u2014
p252
aVthis video is sped up about sixtyfold \u2014
p253
aVthis little piece of brain tissue is going to grow.
p254
aVIt can increase by a hundredfold or even more in volume.
p255
aVAnd the cool part is, because those polymers are so tiny,
p256
aVwe're separating biomolecules evenly from each other.
p257
aVIt's a smooth expansion.
p258
aVWe're not losing the configuration of the information.
p259
aVWe're just making it easier to see.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo now we can take actual brain circuitry \u2014
p262
aVhere's a piece of the brain involved with, for example, memory \u2014
p263
aVand we can zoom in.
p264
aVWe can start to actually look at how circuits are configured.
p265
aVMaybe someday we could read out a memory.
p266
aVMaybe we could actually look at how circuits are configured
p267
aVto process emotions,
p268
aVhow the actual wiring of our brain is organized
p269
aVin order to make us who we are.
p270
aVAnd of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully,
p271
aVthe actual problems in the brain at a molecular level.
p272
aVWhat if we could actually look into cells in the brain
p273
aVand figure out, wow, here are the 17 molecules that have altered
p274
aVin this brain tissue that has been undergoing epilepsy
p275
aVor changing in Parkinson's disease
p276
aVor otherwise being altered?
p277
aVIf we get that systematic list of things that are going wrong,
p278
aVthose become our therapeutic targets.
p279
aVWe can build drugs that bind those.
p280
aVWe can maybe aim energy at different parts of the brain
p281
aVin order to help people with Parkinson's or epilepsy
p282
aVor other conditions that affect over a billion people
p283
aVaround the world.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow, something interesting has been happening.
p286
aVIt turns out that throughout biomedicine,
p287
aVthere are other problems that expansion might help with.
p288
aVThis is an actual biopsy from a human breast cancer patient.
p289
aVIt turns out that if you look at cancers,
p290
aVif you look at the immune system,
p291
aVif you look at aging, if you look at development \u2014
p292
aVall these processes are involving large-scale biological systems.
p293
aVBut of course, the problems begin with those little nanoscale molecules,
p294
aVthe machines that make the cells and the organs in our body tick.
p295
aVSo what we're trying to do now is to figure out
p296
aVif we can actually use this technology to map the building blocks of life
p297
aVin a wide variety of diseases.
p298
aVCan we actually pinpoint the molecular changes in a tumor
p299
aVso that we can actually go after it in a smart way
p300
aVand deliver drugs that might wipe out exactly the cells that we want to?
p301
aa(lp302
VYou know, a lot of medicine is very high risk.
p303
aVSometimes, it's even guesswork.
p304
aVMy hope is we can actually turn what might be a high-risk moon shot
p305
aVinto something that's more reliable.
p306
aVIf you think about the original moon shot,
p307
aVwhere they actually landed on the moon,
p308
aVit was based on solid science.
p309
aVWe understood gravity;
p310
aVwe understood aerodynamics.
p311
aVWe knew how to build rockets.
p312
aVThe science risk was under control.
p313
aVIt was still a great, great feat of engineering.
p314
aVBut in medicine, we don't necessarily have all the laws.
p315
aVDo we have all the laws that are analogous to gravity,
p316
aVthat are analogous to aerodynamics?
p317
aVI would argue that with technologies
p318
aVlike the kinds I'm talking about today,
p319
aVmaybe we can actually derive those.
p320
aVWe can map the patterns that occur in living systems,
p321
aVand figure out how to overcome the diseases that plague us.
p322
aa(lp323
VYou know, my wife and I have two young kids,
p324
aVand one of my hopes as a bioengineer is to make life better for them
p325
aVthan it currently is for us.
p326
aVAnd my hope is, if we can turn biology and medicine
p327
aVfrom these high-risk endeavors that are governed by chance and luck,
p328
aVand make them things that we win by skill and hard work,
p329
aVthen that would be a great advance.
p330
aa(lp331
VThank you very much.

leads the Synthetic Neurobiology Group, which develops tools for analyzing and repairing complex biological systems such as the brain. His group applies these tools in a systematic way in order to reveal ground truth scientific understandings of biological systems, which in turn reveal radical new approaches for curing diseases and repairing disabilities. These technologies include expansion microscopy, which enables complex biological systems to be imaged with nanoscale precision, and optogenetic tools, which enable the activation and silencing of neural activity with light (TED Talk:&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.ted.com/talks/ed_boyden\\" target=\\"_blank\\">A light switch for neurons</a>).&nbsp;Boyden also co-directs the MIT Center for Neurobiological Engineering, which aims to develop new tools to accelerate neuroscience progress.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Amongst other recognitions, Boyden has received the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences (2016), the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (2015), the Carnegie Prize in Mind and Brain Sciences (2015), the Jacob Heskel Gabbay Award (2013), the Grete Lundbeck Brain Prize (2013) and the NIH Director&#39;s Pioneer Award (2013). He was also named to the World Economic Forum Young Scientist list (2013) and the <em>Technology Review World&#39;</em>s &quot;Top 35 Innovators under Age 35&quot; list (2006). His group has hosted hundreds of visitors to learn how to use new biotechnologies and spun out several companies to bring inventions out of his lab and into the world. Boyden received his Ph.D. in neurosciences from Stanford University as a Hertz Fellow, where he discovered that the molecular mechanisms used to store a memory are determined by the content to be learned. Before that, he received three degrees in electrical engineering, computer science and physics from MIT. He has contributed to over 300 peer-reviewed papers, current or pending patents and articles, and he has given over 300 invited talks on his group&#39;s work.</p>", "slug": "ed_boyden", "whotheyare": "Ed Boyden is a professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at the MIT Media Lab and the MIT McGovern Institute.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 890, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/fd2c79e1b1a6aa4e9f59f1b4bbb704969bb7e06e_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "A new way to study the brain\'s invisible secrets", "take_action": [], "comments": 27175, "more_resources": [], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/eec0be6feefef0950540ec844664ed485ec83d8d_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Neuroengineer Ed Boyden wants to know how the tiny biomolecules in our brains generate emotions, thoughts and feelings -- and he wants to find the molecular changes that lead to disorders like epilepsy and Alzheimer\'s.

VThere are two groups of women
p5
aVwhen it comes to screening mammography \u2014
p6
aVwomen in whom mammography works very well
p7
aVand has saved thousands of lives
p8
aVand women in whom it doesn't work well at all.
p9
aVDo you know which group you're in?
p10
aVIf you don't, you're not alone.
p11
aVBecause the breast has become
p12
aVa very political organ.
p13
aVThe truth has become lost
p14
aVin all the rhetoric
p15
aVcoming from the press, politicians,
p16
aVradiologists
p17
aVand medical imaging companies.
p18
aVI will do my best this morning
p19
aVto tell you what I think is the truth.
p20
aVBut first, my disclosures.
p21
aVI am not a breast cancer survivor.
p22
aVI'm not a radiologist.
p23
aVI don't have any patents,
p24
aVand I've never received any money from a medical imaging company,
p25
aVand I am not seeking your vote.
p26

VWhat I am
p30
aVis a doctor of internal medicine
p31
aVwho became passionately interested in this topic
p32
aVabout 10 years ago
p33
aVwhen a patient asked me a question.
p34
aVShe came to see me
p35
aVafter discovering a breast lump.
p36
aVHer sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer
p37
aVin her 40s.
p38
aVShe and I were both very pregnant at that time,
p39
aVand my heart just ached for her,
p40
aVimagining how afraid she must be.
p41
aVFortunately, her lump proved to be benign.
p42
aVBut she asked me a question:
p43
aVhow confident was I
p44
aVthat I would find a tumor early on her mammogram
p45
aVif she developed one?
p46
aVSo I studied her mammogram,
p47
aVand I reviewed the radiology literature,
p48
aVand I was shocked to discover
p49
aVthat, in her case,
p50
aVour chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram
p51
aVwere less than the toss of a coin.
p52
aa(lp53
VYou may recall a year ago
p54
aVwhen a firestorm erupted
p55
aVafter the United States Preventive Services Task Force
p56
aVreviewed the world's mammography screening literature
p57
aVand issued a guideline
p58
aVrecommending against screening mammograms
p59
aVin women in their 40s.
p60
aVNow everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,
p61
aVeven though most of them weren't in anyway familiar
p62
aVwith the mammography studies.
p63
aVIt took the Senate just 17 days
p64
aVto ban the use of the guidelines
p65
aVin determining insurance coverage.
p66
aVRadiologists were outraged
p67
aVby the guidelines.
p68
aVThe pre-eminent mammographer in the United States
p69
aVissued the following quote
p70
aVto the Washington Post.
p71
aVThe radiologists were, in turn, criticized
p72
aVfor protecting their own financial self-interest.
p73
aVBut in my view,
p74
aVthe radiologists are heroes.
p75
aVThere's a shortage of radiologists
p76
aVqualified to read mammograms,
p77
aVand that's because mammograms are one of the most complex
p78
aVof all radiology studies to interpret,
p79
aVand because radiologists
p80
aVare sued more often
p81
aVover missed breast cancer
p82
aVthan any other cause.
p83
aVBut that very fact is telling.
p84
aa(lp85
VWhere there is this much legal smoke,
p86
aVthere is likely to be some fire.
p87
aVThe factor most responsible for that fire
p88
aVis breast density.
p89
aVBreast density refers to the relative amount of fat \u2014
p90
aVpictured here in yellow \u2014
p91
aVversus connective and epithelial tissues \u2014
p92
aVpictured in pink.
p93
aVAnd that proportion
p94
aVis primarily genetically determined.
p95
aVTwo-thirds of women in their 40s
p96
aVhave dense breast tissue,
p97
aVwhich is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.
p98
aVAnd although breast density generally declines with age,
p99
aVup to a third of women
p100
aVretain dense breast tissue
p101
aVfor years after menopause.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo how do you know if your breasts are dense?
p104
aVWell, you need to read the details
p105
aVof your mammography report.
p106
aVRadiologists classify breast density
p107
aVinto four categories
p108
aVbased on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.
p109
aVIf the breast is less than 25 percent dense,
p110
aVthat's called fatty-replaced.
p111
aVThe next category
p112
aVis scattered fibroglandular densities,
p113
aVfollowed by heterogeneously dense
p114
aVand extremely dense.
p115
aVAnd breasts that fall into these two categories
p116
aVare considered dense.
p117
aVThe problem with breast density
p118
aVis that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.
p119
aVBoth tumors and dense breast tissue
p120
aVappear white on a mammogram,
p121
aVand the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.
p122
aVSo it's easy to see this tumor
p123
aVin the upper part of this fatty breast.
p124
aVBut imagine how difficult it would be
p125
aVto find that tumor in this dense breast.
p126
aVThat's why mammograms find
p127
aVover 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,
p128
aVbut as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow it's bad enough that breast density
p131
aVmakes it hard to find a cancer,
p132
aVbut it turns out
p133
aVthat it's also a powerful predictor
p134
aVof your risk for breast cancer.
p135
aVIt's a stronger risk factor
p136
aVthan having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.
p137
aVAt the time my patient posed this question to me,
p138
aVbreast density was an obscure topic
p139
aVin the radiology literature,
p140
aVand very few women having mammograms,
p141
aVor the physicians ordering them,
p142
aVknew about this.
p143
aVBut what else could I offer her?
p144
aa(lp145
VMammograms have been around since the 1960's,
p146
aVand it's changed very little.
p147
aVThere have been surprisingly few innovations,
p148
aVuntil digital mammography was approved
p149
aVin 2000.
p150
aVDigital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,
p151
aVbut the images
p152
aVcan be stored and manipulated digitally,
p153
aVjust like we can with a digital camera.
p154
aVThe U.S. has invested
p155
aVfour billion dollars
p156
aVconverting to digital mammography equipment,
p157
aVand what have we gained from that investment?
p158
aVIn a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,
p159
aVdigital mammography was found
p160
aVto be no better over all
p161
aVthan traditional mammography,
p162
aVand in fact, it was worse in older women.
p163
aVBut it was better in one group,
p164
aVand that was women under 50
p165
aVwho were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,
p166
aVand in those women,
p167
aVdigital mammography found twice as many cancers,
p168
aVbut it still only found 60 percent.
p169
aVSo digital mammography
p170
aVhas been a giant leap forward
p171
aVfor manufacturers
p172
aVof digital mammography equipment,
p173
aVbut it's been a very small step forward for
p174
aVwomankind.
p175
aa(lp176
VWhat about ultrasound?
p177
aVUltrasound generates more biopsies
p178
aVthat are unnecessary relative to other technologies,
p179
aVso it's not widely used.
p180
aVAnd MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,
p181
aVbut it's also very expensive.
p182
aVIf we think about disruptive technology,
p183
aVwe see an almost ubiquitous pattern
p184
aVof the technology getting smaller and less expensive.
p185
aVThink about iPods compared to stereos.
p186
aVBut it's the exact opposite in health care.
p187
aVThe machines get ever bigger
p188
aVand ever more expensive.
p189
aVScreening the average young woman with an MRI
p190
aVis kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.
p191
aVIt's just way too much equipment.
p192
aVOne MRI scan
p193
aVcosts 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.
p194
aVAnd sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact
p195
aVthat health care innovation
p196
aVcan't always come at a much higher price.
p197
aa(lp198
VMalcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker
p199
aVon innovation,
p200
aVand he made the case that scientific discoveries
p201
aVare rarely the product of one individual's genius.
p202
aVRather, big ideas can be orchestrated,
p203
aVif you can simply gather
p204
aVpeople with different perspectives in a room
p205
aVand get them to talk about things
p206
aVthat they don't ordinarily talk about.
p207
aVIt's like the essence of TED.
p208
aVHe quotes one innovator who says,
p209
aV"The only time a physician and a physicist get together
p210
aVis when the physicist gets sick."
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aVThis makes no sense,
p213
aVbecause physicians have all kinds of problems
p214
aVthat they don't realize have solutions.
p215
aVAnd physicists have all kinds of solutions for things
p216
aVthat they don't realize are problems.
p217
aVNow, take a look at this cartoon
p218
aVthat accompanied Gladwell's article,
p219
aVand tell me if you see something disturbing
p220
aVabout this depiction of innovative thinkers.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VSo if you will allow me a little creative license,
p225
aVI will tell you the story
p226
aVof the serendipitous collision
p227
aVof my patient's problem
p228
aVwith a physicist's solution.
p229
aVShortly after her visit,
p230
aVI was introduced to a nuclear physicist
p231
aVat Mayo
p232
aVnamed Michael O'Conner,
p233
aVwho was a specialist in cardiac imaging,
p234
aVsomething I had nothing to do with.
p235
aVAnd he happened to tell me
p236
aVabout a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,
p237
aVwhere they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.
p238
aVNow gamma imaging has been around for a long time
p239
aVto image the heart,
p240
aVand it had even been tried to image the breast.
p241
aVBut the problem was
p242
aVthat the gamma detectors
p243
aVwere these huge, bulky tubes,
p244
aVand they were filled with these scintillating crystals,
p245
aVand you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast
p246
aVto find small tumors.
p247
aVBut the potential advantage was
p248
aVthat gamma rays, unlike X-rays,
p249
aVare not influenced by breast density.
p250
aVBut this technology
p251
aVcould not find tumors when they're small,
p252
aVand finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
p253
aVIf you can find a tumor
p254
aVwhen it's less than a centimeter,
p255
aVsurvival exceeds 90 percent,
p256
aVbut drops off rapidly
p257
aVas tumor size increases.
p258
aVBut Michael told me about
p259
aVa new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,
p260
aVand this is it.
p261
aVIt's made
p262
aVnot of a bulky tube,
p263
aVbut of a thin layer of a semiconductor material
p264
aVthat serves as the gamma detector.
p265
aVAnd I started talking to him
p266
aVabout this problem with breast density,
p267
aVand we realized that we might be able to get this detector
p268
aVclose enough around the breast
p269
aVto actually find small tumors.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo after putting together
p272
aVa grid of these cubes with tape \u2014
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aV\u2014 Michael hacked off the X-ray plate
p275
aVof a mammography machine
p276
aVthat was about to be thrown out,
p277
aVand we attached the new detector,
p278
aVand we decided to call this machine
p279
aVMolecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.
p280
aVThis is an image from our first patient.
p281
aVAnd you can see, using the old gamma technology,
p282
aVthat it just looked like noise.
p283
aVBut using our new detector,
p284
aVwe could begin to see the outline of a tumor.
p285
aa(lp286
VSo here we were, a nuclear physicist,
p287
aVan internist,
p288
aVsoon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,
p289
aVand two radiologists,
p290
aVand we were trying to take on
p291
aVthe entrenched world of mammography
p292
aVwith a machine that was held together by duct tape.
p293
aVTo say that we faced
p294
aVhigh doses of skepticism
p295
aVin those early years
p296
aVis just a huge understatement,
p297
aVbut we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work
p298
aVthat we chipped away with incremental modifications
p299
aVto this system.
p300
aVThis is our current detector.
p301
aVAnd you can see that it looks a lot different.
p302
aVThe duct tape is gone,
p303
aVand we added a second detector on top of the breast,
p304
aVwhich has further improved our tumor detection.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo how does this work?
p307
aVThe patient receives an injection of a radio tracer
p308
aVthat's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,
p309
aVbut not by normal cells,
p310
aVand this is the key difference from mammography.
p311
aVMammography relies on differences
p312
aVin the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,
p313
aVand we've seen that those differences
p314
aVcan be obscured in a dense breast.
p315
aVBut MBI exploits
p316
aVthe different molecular behavior of tumors,
p317
aVand therefore, it's impervious to breast density.
p318
aVAfter the injection,
p319
aVthe patient's breast is placed between the detectors.
p320
aVAnd if you've ever had a mammogram \u2014
p321
aVif you're old enough to have had a mammogram \u2014
p322
aVyou know what comes next:
p323
aVpain.
p324
aVYou may be surprised to know
p325
aVthat mammography is the only radiologic study
p326
aVthat's regulated by federal law,
p327
aVand the law requires
p328
aVthat the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery
p329
aVcome down on your breast during this study.
p330
aVBut with MBI,
p331
aVwe use just light, pain-free compression.
p332
aV(Applause)
p333
aVAnd the detector
p334
aVthen transmits the image to the computer.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo here's an example.
p337
aVYou can see, on the right, a mammogram
p338
aVshowing a faint tumor,
p339
aVthe edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.
p340
aVBut the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,
p341
aVas well as a second tumor,
p342
aVwhich profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.
p343
aVIn this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,
p344
aVwe were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors \u2014
p345
aVone is small as three millimeters.
p346
aa(lp347
VOur big break came in 2004.
p348
aVAfter we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,
p349
aVwe used these images
p350
aVto submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
p351
aVAnd we were elated when they took a chance
p352
aVon a team of completely unknown investigators
p353
aVand funded us to study
p354
aV1,000 women with dense breasts,
p355
aVcomparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.
p356
aVOf the tumors that we found,
p357
aVmammography found
p358
aVonly 25 percent of those tumors.
p359
aVMBI found 83 percent.
p360
aVHere's an example from that screening study.
p361
aVThe digital mammogram was read as normal
p362
aVand shows lots of dense tissue,
p363
aVbut the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,
p364
aVwhich correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.
p365
aVIn this case, a one-centimeter tumor.
p366
aVAnd in this case,
p367
aVa 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,
p368
aVwho had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,
p369
aVwanted to enroll in our study.
p370
aVAnd her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,
p371
aVbut her MBI showed an area
p372
aVof worrisome uptake,
p373
aVwhich we can also see on a color image.
p374
aVAnd this corresponded
p375
aVto a tumor the size of a golf ball.
p376
aVBut fortunately it was removed
p377
aVbefore it had spread to her lymph nodes.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo now that we knew that this technology
p380
aVcould find three times more tumors in a dense breast,
p381
aVwe had to solve one very important problem.
p382
aVWe had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,
p383
aVand we have spent the last three years
p384
aVmaking modifications to every aspect of the imaging system
p385
aVto allow this.
p386
aVAnd I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation
p387
aVthat is equivalent to the effective dose
p388
aVfrom one digital mammogram.
p389
aVAnd at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,
p390
aVand this image from three weeks ago
p391
aVin a 67-year-old woman
p392
aVshows a normal digital mammogram,
p393
aVbut an MBI image
p394
aVshowing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.
p395
aVSo this is not just young women that it's benefiting.
p396
aVIt's also older women with dense tissue.
p397
aVAnd we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose
p398
aVthat's used in any other type of gamma technology.
p399
aa(lp400
VMBI generates four images per breast.
p401
aVMRI generates over a thousand.
p402
aVIt takes a radiologist
p403
aVyears of specialty training
p404
aVto become expert in differentiating
p405
aVthe normal anatomic detail
p406
aVfrom the worrisome finding.
p407
aVBut I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room
p408
aVcan find the tumor on the MBI image.
p409
aVBut this is why MBI
p410
aVis so potentially disruptive \u2014
p411
aVit's as accurate as MRI,
p412
aVit's far less complex to interpret,
p413
aVand it's a fraction of the cost.
p414
aVBut you can understand why there may be
p415
aVforces in the breast-imaging world
p416
aVwho prefer the status quo.
p417
aa(lp418
VAfter achieving what we felt were remarkable results,
p419
aVour manuscript was rejected
p420
aVby four journals.
p421
aVAfter the fourth rejection,
p422
aVwe requested reconsideration of the manuscript,
p423
aVbecause we strongly suspected
p424
aVthat one of the reviewers who had rejected it
p425
aVhad a financial conflict of interest
p426
aVin a competing technology.
p427
aVOur manuscript was then accepted
p428
aVand will be published later this month
p429
aVin the journal Radiology.
p430
aV(Applause)
p431
aVWe still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,
p432
aVand then our findings will need to be replicated
p433
aVat other institutions,
p434
aVand this could take five or more years.
p435
aVIf this technology is widely adopted,
p436
aVI will not benefit financially in any way,
p437
aVand that is very important to me,
p438
aVbecause it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.
p439
aVBut I recognize \u2014
p440
aV(Applause)
p441
aVI recognize that the adoption of this technology
p442
aVwill depend as much on economic
p443
aVand political forces
p444
aVas it will on the soundness of the science.
p445
aa(lp446
VThe MBI unit has now been FDA approved,
p447
aVbut it's not yet widely available.
p448
aVSo until something is available
p449
aVfor women with dense breasts,
p450
aVthere are things that you should know
p451
aVto protect yourself.
p452
aVFirst, know your density.
p453
aVNinety percent of women don't,
p454
aVand 95 percent of women don't know
p455
aVthat it increases your breast cancer risk.
p456
aVThe State of Connecticut became the first and only state
p457
aVto mandate that women receive notification
p458
aVof their breast density
p459
aVafter a mammogram.
p460
aVI was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging
p461
aVlast week in Chicago,
p462
aVand I was stunned that there was a heated debate
p463
aVas to whether we should be telling women
p464
aVwhat their breast density is.
p465
aVOf course we should.
p466
aVAnd if you don't know, please ask your doctor
p467
aVor read the details of your mammography report.
p468
aVSecond, if you're pre-menopausal,
p469
aVtry to schedule your mammogram
p470
aVin the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,
p471
aVwhen breast density is relatively lower.
p472
aVThird, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,
p473
aVinsist on additional imaging.
p474
aVAnd fourth and most important,
p475
aVthe mammography debate will rage on,
p476
aVbut I do believe that all women 40 and older
p477
aVshould have an annual mammogram.
p478
aa(lp479
VMammography isn't perfect,
p480
aVbut it's the only test that's been proven
p481
aVto reduce mortality from breast cancer.
p482
aVBut this mortality banner
p483
aVis the very sword
p484
aVwhich mammography's most ardent advocates use
p485
aVto deter innovation.
p486
aVSome women who develop breast cancer
p487
aVdie from it many years later,
p488
aVand most women, thankfully, survive.

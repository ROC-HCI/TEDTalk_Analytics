VSo it's 1995,
p5
aVI'm in college,
p6
aVand a friend and I go on a road trip
p7
aVfrom Providence, Rhode Island
p8
aVto Portland, Oregon.
p9
aVAnd you know, we're young and unemployed,
p10
aVso we do the whole thing on back roads
p11
aVthrough state parks
p12
aVand national forests \u2014
p13
aVbasically the longest route we can possibly take.
p14
aVAnd somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,
p15
aVI turn to my friend
p16
aVand I ask her a question
p17
aVthat's been bothering me
p18
aVfor 2,000 miles.
p19
aV"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"
p20
aVMy friend looks at me totally blankly.
p21
aVThere's actually a gentleman in the front row
p22
aVwho's doing a perfect imitation of her look.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVAnd I'm like, "You know,
p25
aVall the signs we keep seeing
p26
aVwith the Chinese character on them."
p27
aVShe just stares at me for a few moments,
p28
aVand then she cracks up,
p29
aVbecause she figures out what I'm talking about.
p30
aVAnd what I'm talking about is this.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVRight, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VI've spent the last five years of my life
p37
aVthinking about situations
p38
aVexactly like this \u2014
p39
aVwhy we sometimes misunderstand
p40
aVthe signs around us,
p41
aVand how we behave when that happens,
p42
aVand what all of this can tell us about human nature.
p43
aVIn other words, as you heard Chris say,
p44
aVI've spent the last five years
p45
aVthinking about being wrong.
p46
aVThis might strike you as a strange career move,
p47
aVbut it actually has one great advantage:
p48
aVno job competition.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVIn fact, most of us do everything we can
p51
aVto avoid thinking about being wrong,
p52
aVor at least to avoid thinking about the possibility
p53
aVthat we ourselves are wrong.
p54
aVWe get it in the abstract.
p55
aVWe all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.
p56
aVThe human species, in general, is fallible \u2014 okay fine.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut when it comes down to me, right now,
p59
aVto all the beliefs I hold,
p60
aVhere in the present tense,
p61
aVsuddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility
p62
aVgoes out the window \u2014
p63
aVand I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.
p64
aVAnd the thing is, the present tense is where we live.
p65
aVWe go to meetings in the present tense;
p66
aVwe go on family vacations in the present tense;
p67
aVwe go to the polls and vote in the present tense.
p68
aVSo effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,
p69
aVtrapped in this little bubble
p70
aVof feeling very right about everything.
p71
aa(lp72
VI think this is a problem.
p73
aVI think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,
p74
aVin our personal and professional lives,
p75
aVand I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.
p76
aVSo what I want to do today
p77
aVis, first of all, talk about why we get stuck
p78
aVinside this feeling of being right.
p79
aVAnd second, why it's such a problem.
p80
aVAnd finally, I want to convince you
p81
aVthat it is possible
p82
aVto step outside of that feeling
p83
aVand that if you can do so,
p84
aVit is the single greatest
p85
aVmoral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo why do we get stuck
p88
aVin this feeling of being right?
p89
aVOne reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.
p90
aVSo let me ask you guys something \u2014
p91
aVor actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:
p92
aVHow does it feel \u2014 emotionally \u2014
p93
aVhow does it feel to be wrong?
p94
aVDreadful. Thumbs down.
p95
aVEmbarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.
p96
aVDreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing \u2014
p97
aVthank you, these are great answers,
p98
aVbut they're answers to a different question.
p99
aVYou guys are answering the question:
p100
aVHow does it feel to realize you're wrong?
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVRealizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?
p103
aVI mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,
p104
aVit can actually be quite funny,
p105
aVlike my stupid Chinese character mistake.
p106
aVBut just being wrong
p107
aVdoesn't feel like anything.
p108
aa(lp109
VI'll give you an analogy.
p110
aVDo you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon
p111
aVwhere there's this pathetic coyote
p112
aVwho's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?
p113
aVIn pretty much every episode of this cartoon,
p114
aVthere's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner
p115
aVand the roadrunner runs off a cliff,
p116
aVwhich is fine \u2014 he's a bird, he can fly.
p117
aVBut the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.
p118
aVAnd what's funny \u2014
p119
aVat least if you're six years old \u2014
p120
aVis that the coyote's totally fine too.
p121
aVHe just keeps running \u2014
p122
aVright up until the moment that he looks down
p123
aVand realizes that he's in mid-air.
p124
aVThat's when he falls.
p125
aVWhen we're wrong about something \u2014
p126
aVnot when we realize it, but before that \u2014
p127
aVwe're like that coyote
p128
aVafter he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.
p129
aVYou know, we're already wrong,
p130
aVwe're already in trouble,
p131
aVbut we feel like we're on solid ground.
p132
aVSo I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.
p133
aVIt does feel like something to be wrong;
p134
aVit feels like being right.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VSo this is one reason, a structural reason,
p139
aVwhy we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.
p140
aVI call this error blindness.
p141
aVMost of the time,
p142
aVwe don't have any kind of internal cue
p143
aVto let us know that we're wrong about something,
p144
aVuntil it's too late.
p145
aVBut there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well \u2014
p146
aVand this one is cultural.
p147
aVThink back for a moment to elementary school.
p148
aVYou're sitting there in class,
p149
aVand your teacher is handing back quiz papers,
p150
aVand one of them looks like this.
p151
aVThis is not mine, by the way.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVSo there you are in grade school,
p154
aVand you know exactly what to think
p155
aVabout the kid who got this paper.
p156
aVIt's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,
p157
aVthe one who never does his homework.
p158
aVSo by the time you are nine years old,
p159
aVyou've already learned, first of all,
p160
aVthat people who get stuff wrong
p161
aVare lazy, irresponsible dimwits \u2014
p162
aVand second of all,
p163
aVthat the way to succeed in life
p164
aVis to never make any mistakes.
p165
aa(lp166
VWe learn these really bad lessons really well.
p167
aVAnd a lot of us \u2014
p168
aVand I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room \u2014
p169
aVdeal with them by just becoming
p170
aVperfect little A students,
p171
aVperfectionists, over-achievers.
p172
aVRight,
p173
aVMr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVYou're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.
p176
aVOkay, so fine.
p177
aVExcept that then we freak out
p178
aVat the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.
p179
aVBecause according to this,
p180
aVgetting something wrong
p181
aVmeans there's something wrong with us.
p182
aVSo we just insist that we're right,
p183
aVbecause it makes us feel smart and responsible
p184
aVand virtuous and safe.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo let me tell you a story.
p187
aVA couple of years ago,
p188
aVa woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.
p189
aVBeth Israel's in Boston.
p190
aVIt's the teaching hospital for Harvard \u2014
p191
aVone of the best hospitals in the country.
p192
aVSo this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.
p193
aVShe's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing \u2014
p194
aVstitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.
p195
aVEverything seems to have gone fine.
p196
aVAnd she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,
p197
aVand she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"
p198
aVWell the wrong side of her body is in bandages
p199
aVbecause the surgeon has performed a major operation
p200
aVon her left leg instead of her right one.
p201
aVWhen the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel
p202
aVspoke about this incident,
p203
aVhe said something very interesting.
p204
aVHe said, "For whatever reason,
p205
aVthe surgeon simply felt
p206
aVthat he was on the correct side of the patient."
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aVThe point of this story
p209
aVis that trusting too much in the feeling
p210
aVof being on the correct side of anything
p211
aVcan be very dangerous.
p212
aa(lp213
VThis internal sense of rightness
p214
aVthat we all experience so often
p215
aVis not a reliable guide
p216
aVto what is actually going on in the external world.
p217
aVAnd when we act like it is,
p218
aVand we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,
p219
aVwell that's when we end up doing things
p220
aVlike dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,
p221
aVor torpedoing the global economy.
p222
aVSo this is a huge practical problem.
p223
aVBut it's also a huge social problem.
p224
aa(lp225
VThink for a moment about what it means to feel right.
p226
aVIt means that you think that your beliefs
p227
aVjust perfectly reflect reality.
p228
aVAnd when you feel that way,
p229
aVyou've got a problem to solve,
p230
aVwhich is, how are you going to explain
p231
aVall of those people who disagree with you?
p232
aVIt turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,
p233
aVby resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.
p234
aVThe first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us
p235
aVis we just assume they're ignorant.
p236
aVThey don't have access to the same information that we do,
p237
aVand when we generously share that information with them,
p238
aVthey're going to see the light and come on over to our team.
p239
aVWhen that doesn't work,
p240
aVwhen it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do
p241
aVand they still disagree with us,
p242
aVthen we move on to a second assumption,
p243
aVwhich is that they're idiots.
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aVThey have all the right pieces of the puzzle,
p246
aVand they are too moronic to put them together correctly.
p247
aVAnd when that doesn't work,
p248
aVwhen it turns out that people who disagree with us
p249
aVhave all the same facts we do
p250
aVand are actually pretty smart,
p251
aVthen we move on to a third assumption:
p252
aVthey know the truth,
p253
aVand they are deliberately distorting it
p254
aVfor their own malevolent purposes.
p255
aVSo this is a catastrophe.
p256
aa(lp257
VThis attachment to our own rightness
p258
aVkeeps us from preventing mistakes
p259
aVwhen we absolutely need to
p260
aVand causes us to treat each other terribly.
p261
aVBut to me, what's most baffling
p262
aVand most tragic about this
p263
aVis that it misses the whole point of being human.
p264
aVIt's like we want to imagine
p265
aVthat our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows
p266
aVand we just gaze out of them
p267
aVand describe the world as it unfolds.
p268
aVAnd we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window
p269
aVand see the exact same thing.
p270
aVThat is not true,
p271
aVand if it were, life would be incredibly boring.
p272
aVThe miracle of your mind
p273
aVisn't that you can see the world as it is.
p274
aVIt's that you can see the world as it isn't.
p275
aVWe can remember the past,
p276
aVand we can think about the future,
p277
aVand we can imagine what it's like
p278
aVto be some other person in some other place.
p279
aVAnd we all do this a little differently,
p280
aVwhich is why we can all look up at the same night sky
p281
aVand see this
p282
aVand also this
p283
aVand also this.
p284
aVAnd yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.
p285
aa(lp286
V1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing
p287
aVabout "I think therefore I am,"
p288
aVthis guy, St. Augustine, sat down
p289
aVand wrote "Fallor ergo sum" \u2014
p290
aV"I err therefore I am."
p291
aVAugustine understood
p292
aVthat our capacity to screw up,
p293
aVit's not some kind of embarrassing defect
p294
aVin the human system,
p295
aVsomething we can eradicate or overcome.
p296
aVIt's totally fundamental to who we are.
p297
aVBecause, unlike God,
p298
aVwe don't really know what's going on out there.
p299
aVAnd unlike all of the other animals,
p300
aVwe are obsessed with trying to figure it out.
p301
aVTo me, this obsession
p302
aVis the source and root
p303
aVof all of our productivity and creativity.
p304
aa(lp305
VLast year, for various reasons,
p306
aVI found myself listening to a lot of episodes
p307
aVof the Public Radio show This American Life.
p308
aVAnd so I'm listening and I'm listening,
p309
aVand at some point, I start feeling
p310
aVlike all the stories are about being wrong.
p311
aVAnd my first thought was,
p312
aV"I've lost it.
p313
aVI've become the crazy wrongness lady.
p314
aVI just imagined it everywhere,"
p315
aVwhich has happened.
p316
aVBut a couple of months later,
p317
aVI actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.
p318
aVAnd I mentioned this to him,
p319
aVand he was like, "No actually, that's true.
p320
aVIn fact," he says,
p321
aV"as a staff, we joke
p322
aVthat every single episode of our show
p323
aVhas the same crypto-theme.
p324
aVAnd the crypto-theme is:
p325
aV'I thought this one thing was going to happen
p326
aVand something else happened instead.'
p327
aVAnd the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.
p328
aVWe need these moments
p329
aVof surprise and reversal and wrongness
p330
aVto make these stories work."
p331
aVAnd for the rest of us, audience members,
p332
aVas listeners, as readers,
p333
aVwe eat this stuff up.
p334
aVWe love things like plot twists
p335
aVand red herrings and surprise endings.
p336
aVWhen it comes to our stories,
p337
aVwe love being wrong.
p338
aa(lp339
VBut, you know, our stories are like this
p340
aVbecause our lives are like this.
p341
aVWe think this one thing is going to happen
p342
aVand something else happens instead.
p343
aVGeorge Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,
p344
aVfind a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,
p345
aVliberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.
p346
aVAnd something else happened instead.
p347
aVAnd Hosni Mubarak
p348
aVthought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,
p349
aVuntil he got too old or too sick
p350
aVand could pass the reigns of power onto his son.
p351
aVAnd something else happened instead.
p352
aVAnd maybe you thought
p353
aVyou were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart
p354
aVand move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.
p355
aVAnd something else happened instead.
p356
aVAnd I have to tell you
p357
aVthat I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book
p358
aVabout a subject everybody hates
p359
aVfor an audience that would never materialize.
p360
aVAnd something else happened instead.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VI mean, this is life.
p365
aVFor good and for ill,
p366
aVwe generate these incredible stories
p367
aVabout the world around us,
p368
aVand then the world turns around and astonishes us.
p369
aVNo offense, but this entire conference
p370
aVis an unbelievable monument
p371
aVto our capacity to get stuff wrong.
p372
aVWe just spent an entire week
p373
aVtalking about innovations and advancements
p374
aVand improvements,
p375
aVbut you know why we need all of those innovations
p376
aVand advancements and improvements?
p377
aVBecause half the stuff
p378
aVthat's the most mind-boggling and world-altering \u2014
p379
aVTED 1998 \u2014
p380
aVeh.
p381
aV(Laughter)
p382
aVDidn't really work out that way, did it?
p383
aV(Laughter)
p384
aVWhere's my jet pack, Chris?
p385
aa(lp386
V(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
V(Applause)
p389
aa(lp390
VSo here we are again.
p391
aVAnd that's how it goes.
p392
aVWe come up with another idea.
p393
aVWe tell another story.
p394
aVWe hold another conference.
p395
aVThe theme of this one,
p396
aVas you guys have now heard seven million times,
p397
aVis the rediscovery of wonder.
p398
aVAnd to me,
p399
aVif you really want to rediscover wonder,
p400
aVyou need to step outside
p401
aVof that tiny, terrified space of rightness
p402
aVand look around at each other
p403
aVand look out at the vastness
p404
aVand complexity and mystery
p405
aVof the universe
p406
aVand be able to say,
p407
aV"Wow, I don't know.
p408
aVMaybe I'm wrong."
p409
aa(lp410
VThank you.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Applause)
p413
aa(lp414
VThank you guys.

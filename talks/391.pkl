V(Applause)
p7
aa(lp8
VThank you for being here.
p9
aVAnd I say "thank you for being here" because I was silent for 17 years.
p10
aVAnd the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C.,
p11
aVon the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.
p12
aVAnd my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak.
p13
aVAnd I said, "Thank you for being here."
p14
aVMy mother, out in the audience, she jumped up,
p15
aV"Hallelujah, Johnny\u2019s talking!"
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VImagine if you were quiet for 17 years
p20
aVand your mother was out in the audience, say.
p21
aVMy dad said to me, "That\u2019s one" \u2014
p22
aVI\u2019ll explain that.
p23
aVBut I turned around because I didn\u2019t recognize where my voice was coming from.
p24
aVI hadn\u2019t heard my voice in 17 years,
p25
aVso I turned around and I looked and I said,
p26
aV"God, who's saying what I\u2019m thinking?"
p27
aVAnd then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed.
p28
aVAnd I could see my father: "Yeah, he really is crazy."
p29
aVWell, I want to take you on this journey.
p30
aVAnd the journey, I believe, is a metaphor for all of our journeys.
p31
aVEven though this one is kind of unusual,
p32
aVI want you to think about your own journey.
p33
aa(lp34
VMy journey began in 1971
p35
aVwhen I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate,
p36
aVand a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay.
p37
aVIt disturbed me so much
p38
aVthat I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles.
p39
aVThat\u2019s a big thing in California.
p40
aVAnd it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station
p41
aVin Inverness, California, because there were only
p42
aVabout 350 people there in the winter \u2013 this was back in '71 now.
p43
aVAnd so when I came in and I started walking around, people \u2014
p44
aVthey just knew what was going on.
p45
aVAnd people would drive up next to me
p46
aVand say, "John, what are you doing?"
p47
aVAnd I\u2019d say, "Well, I\u2019m walking for the environment."
p48
aVAnd they said, "No, you\u2019re walking to make us look bad, right?
p49
aVYou\u2019re walking to make us feel bad."
p50
aVAnd maybe there was some truth to that,
p51
aVbecause I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow.
p52
aVBecause of the oil, everybody talked about the polllution.
p53
aVAnd so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued.
p54
aVI called my parents up.
p55
aVI said, "I\u2019ve given up riding and driving in cars."
p56
aVMy dad said, "Why didn\u2019t you do that when you were 16?"
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VI didn\u2019t know about the environment then.
p61
aVThey\u2019re back in Philadelphia.
p62
aVAnd so I told my mother, "I\u2019m happy though, I\u2019m really happy."
p63
aVShe said, "If you were happy, son, you wouldn\u2019t have to say it."
p64
aVMothers are like that.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much
p67
aVand I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking
p68
aVfor just one day \u2014 one day \u2014 to give it a rest.
p69
aVAnd so I did.
p70
aVI got up in the morning and I didn\u2019t say a word.
p71
aVAnd I have to tell you, it was a very moving experience,
p72
aVbecause for the first time, I began listening \u2014 in a long time.
p73
aVAnd what I heard, it kind of disturbed me.
p74
aVBecause what I used to do, when I thought I was listening,
p75
aVwas I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say
p76
aVand think that I could \u2014 I knew what they were going to say,
p77
aVand so I stopped listening.
p78
aVAnd in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead
p79
aVand thought of what I was going to say back,
p80
aVwhile they were still finishing up.
p81
aVAnd then I would launch in.
p82
aVWell, that just ended communication.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo on this first day I actually listened.
p85
aVAnd it was very sad for me,
p86
aVbecause I realized that for those many years I had not been learning.
p87
aVI was 27. I thought I knew everything.
p88
aVI didn\u2019t.
p89
aVAnd so I decided I\u2019d better do this for another day,
p90
aVand another day, and another day until finally,
p91
aVI promised myself for a year I would keep quiet
p92
aVbecause I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more.
p93
aVSo for a year I said I would keep quiet,
p94
aVand then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned
p95
aVand maybe I would talk again.
p96
aVWell, that lasted 17 years.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow during that time \u2014 those 17 years \u2014 I walked and I played the banjo
p99
aVand I painted and I wrote in my journal, and
p100
aVI tried to study the environment by reading books.
p101
aVAnd I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did.
p102
aVI walked up to Ashland, Oregon,
p103
aVwhere they were offering an environmental studies degree.
p104
aVIt\u2019s only 500 miles.
p105
aVAnd I went into the Registrar\u2019s office and \u2014
p106
aV"What, what, what?"
p107
aVI had a newspaper clipping.
p108
aV"Oh, so you really want to go to school here?
p109
aVYou don\u2019t \u2026?
p110
aVWe have a special program for you." They did.
p111
aVAnd in those two years, I graduated with my first degree \u2014 a bachelor\u2019s degree.
p112
aVAnd my father came out, he was so proud.
p113
aVHe said, "Listen, we\u2019re really proud of you son,
p114
aVbut what are you going to do with a bachelor\u2019s degree?
p115
aVYou don\u2019t ride in cars, you don\u2019t talk \u2014
p116
aVyou\u2019re going to have to do those things."
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VI hunched my shoulder, I picked my backpack up again
p121
aVand I started walking.
p122
aVI walked all the way up to Port Townsend, Washington, where I built a wooden boat,
p123
aVrode it across Puget Sound
p124
aVand walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula, Montana.
p125
aVI had written the University of Montana two years earlier
p126
aVand said I'd like to go to school there.
p127
aVI said I'd be there in about two years.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd I was there. I showed up in two years and they \u2014
p132
aVI tell this story because they really helped me.
p133
aVThere are two stories in Montana.
p134
aVThe first story is I didn\u2019t have any money \u2014 that\u2019s a sign I used a lot.
p135
aVAnd they said,"Don't worry about that."
p136
aVThe director of the program said, "Come back tomorrow."
p137
aVHe gave me 150 dollars,
p138
aVand he said, "Register for one credit.
p139
aVYou\u2019re going to go to South America, aren\u2019t you?"
p140
aVAnd I said \u2014
p141
aVRivers and lakes, the hydrological systems, South America.
p142
aVSo I did that.
p143
aVHe came back; he said to me,
p144
aV"OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit,
p145
aVyou can have a key to an office, you can matriculate \u2014
p146
aVyou\u2019re matriculating, so you can use the library.
p147
aVAnd what we\u2019re going to do
p148
aVis, we\u2019re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class.
p149
aVThey\u2019re going to save your grade,
p150
aVand when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money,
p151
aVthen you can register for that class and they\u2019ll give you the grade."
p152
aVWow, they don\u2019t do that in graduate schools, I don\u2019t think.
p153
aVBut I use that story because they really wanted to help me.
p154
aVThey saw that I was really interested in the environment,
p155
aVand they really wanted to help me along the way.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd during that time, I actually taught classes without speaking.
p158
aVI had 13 students when I first walked into the class.
p159
aVI explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language,
p160
aVthat I was John Francis, I was walking around the world,
p161
aVI didn\u2019t talk and this was the last time
p162
aVthis person\u2019s going to be here interpreting for me.
p163
aVAll the students sat around and they went ...
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VI could see they were looking for the schedule,
p168
aVto see when they could get out.
p169
aVThey had to take that class with me.
p170
aVTwo weeks later, everyone was trying to get into our class.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd I learned in that class \u2014 because I would do things like this ...
p173
aVand they were all gathered around, going, "What's he trying to say?"
p174
aV"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting."
p175
aV"No, no, no, that's not clear cutting, that\u2019s \u2014 he's using a handsaw."
p176
aV"Well, you can\u2019t clearcut with a ..."
p177
aV"Yes, you can clear cut ..."
p178
aV"No, I think he\u2019s talking about selective forestry."
p179
aVNow this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion.
p180
aVI just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying.
p181
aVBut what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign
p182
aVand they said things that I absolutely did not mean,
p183
aVbut I should have.
p184
aVAnd so what came to me is, if you were a teacher
p185
aVand you were teaching, if you weren\u2019t learning
p186
aVyou probably weren\u2019t teaching very well.
p187
aVAnd so I went on.
p188
aa(lp189
VMy dad came out to see me graduate
p190
aVand, you know, I did the deal,
p191
aVand my father said, "We\u2019re really proud of you son, but ... "
p192
aVYou know what went on,
p193
aVhe said, "You\u2019ve got to start riding and driving and start talking.
p194
aVWhat are you going to do with a master\u2019s degree?"
p195
aVI hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack
p196
aVand I went on to the University of Wisconsin.
p197
aa(lp198
VI spent two years there writing on oil spills.
p199
aVNo one was interested in oil spills.
p200
aVBut something happened \u2014
p201
aVExxon Valdez.
p202
aVAnd I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills.
p203
aVMy dad came out again.
p204
aVHe said, "I don't know how you do this, son \u2014
p205
aVI mean, you don't ride in cars, you don\u2019t talk.
p206
aVMy sister said maybe I should leave you alone,
p207
aVbecause you seem to be doing a lot better
p208
aVwhen you\u2019re not saying anything."
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VWell, I put on my backpack again.
p213
aVI put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast,
p214
aVput my foot in the Atlantic Ocean \u2014
p215
aVit was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd on Earth Day, 1990 \u2014
p218
aVthe 20th anniversary of Earth Day \u2014 that\u2019s when I began to speak.
p219
aVAnd that\u2019s why I said, "Thank you for being here."
p220
aVBecause it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling;
p221
aVand if there's no one there to hear, does it really make a sound?
p222
aVAnd I\u2019m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family
p223
aVbecause they had come to hear me speak.
p224
aVAnd that\u2019s communication.
p225
aVAnd they also taught me about listening \u2014 that they listened to me.
p226
aVAnd it\u2019s one of those things that came out of the silence,
p227
aVthe listening to each other.
p228
aVReally, very important \u2014
p229
aVwe need to listen to each other.
p230
aVWell, my journey kept going on.
p231
aVMy dad said, "That\u2019s one,"
p232
aVand I still didn\u2019t let that go.
p233
aa(lp234
VI worked for the Coastguard, was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador.
p235
aVI wrote regulations for the United States \u2014
p236
aVI mean, I wrote oil spill regulations.
p237
aV20 years ago, if someone had said to me,
p238
aV"John, do you really want to make a difference?"
p239
aV"Yeah, I want to make a difference."
p240
aVHe said, "You just start walking east;
p241
aVget out of your car and just start walking east."
p242
aVAnd as I walked off a little bit, they'd say, "Yeah, and shut up, too."
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
V"You\u2019re going to make a difference, buddy."
p247
aVHow could that be, how could that be?
p248
aVHow could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking
p249
aVmake a difference?
p250
aa(lp251
VWell, my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time.
p252
aVAnd after that \u2014 I only worked one year \u2014
p253
aVI said, "That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that."
p254
aVI got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean,
p255
aVand walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela.
p256
aVAnd you know, I forgot the most important thing,
p257
aVwhich is why I started talking, which I have to tell you.
p258
aVI started talking because I had studied environment.
p259
aVI\u2019d studied environment at this formal level,
p260
aVbut there was this informal level.
p261
aVAnd the informal level \u2014
p262
aVI learned about people, and what we do and how we are.
p263
aVAnd environment changed from just being about trees and birds
p264
aVand endangered species to being about how we treated each other.
p265
aVBecause if we are the environment,
p266
aVthen all we need to do is look around us
p267
aVand see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.
p268
aVAnd so that\u2019s the message that I had.
p269
aVAnd I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message."
p270
aVAnd I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean \u2014
p271
aVit wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat \u2014
p272
aVgot to Venezuela and I started walking.
p273
aa(lp274
VThis is the last part of this story, because it\u2019s how I got here,
p275
aVbecause I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles.
p276
aVI was walking through El Dorado \u2014 it's a prison town, famous prison,
p277
aVor infamous prison \u2014 in Venezuela, and I don\u2019t know what possessed me,
p278
aVbecause this was not like me.
p279
aVThere I am, walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says,
p280
aV"Pasaporte, pasaporte," and with an M16 pointed at me.
p281
aVAnd I looked at him and I said, "Passport, huh?
p282
aVI don't need to show you my passport. It\u2019s in the back of my pack.
p283
aVI'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world."
p284
aVAnd I started walking off.
p285
aVWhat possessed me to say this thing?
p286
aVThe road turned into the jungle.
p287
aVI didn\u2019t get shot.
p288
aVAnd I got to \u2014 I start saying, "Free at last \u2014
p289
aVthank God Almighty, I\u2019m free at last."
p290
aV"What was that about," I\u2019m saying. What was that about?
p291
aa(lp292
VIt took me 100 miles to figure out that, in my heart, in me,
p293
aVI had become a prisoner.
p294
aVI was a prisoner and I needed to escape.
p295
aVThe prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive
p296
aVor use motorized vehicles.
p297
aVNow how could that be?
p298
aVBecause when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me
p299
aVnot to use motorized vehicles.
p300
aVBut the thing that was different
p301
aVwas that every birthday, I asked myself about silence,
p302
aVbut I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet.
p303
aVI had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador.
p304
aVI had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me,
p307
aVand that I was going to have to change.
p308
aVYou know, we can do it.
p309
aVI was going to have to change.
p310
aVAnd I was afraid to change,
p311
aVbecause I was so used to the guy who only just walked.
p312
aVI was so used to that person that I didn\u2019t want to stop.
p313
aVI didn\u2019t know who I would be if I changed.
p314
aVBut I know I needed to.
p315
aVI know I needed to change, because it would be the only way
p316
aVthat I could be here today.
p317
aVAnd I know that a lot of times
p318
aVwe find ourselves in this wonderful place where we\u2019ve gotten to,
p319
aVbut there\u2019s another place for us to go.
p320
aVAnd we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we\u2019ve become,
p321
aVand go to the place of who we are becoming.
p322
aVAnd so, I want to encourage you to go to that next place,
p323
aVto let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in,
p324
aVas comfortable as it may be, because we have to do something now.
p325
aVWe have to change now.
p326
aVAs our former Vice President said,
p327
aVwe have to become activists.
p328
aVSo if my voice can touch you,
p329
aVif my actions can touch you, if my being here can touch you,
p330
aVplease let it be.
p331
aVAnd I know that all of you have touched me
p332
aVwhile I\u2019ve been here.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo, let\u2019s go out into the world
p335
aVand take this caring, this love, this respect
p336
aVthat we\u2019ve shown each other right here at TED,
p337
aVand take this out into the world.
p338
aVBecause we are the environment,
p339
aVand how we treat each other
p340
aVis really how we\u2019re going to treat the environment.
p341
aVSo I want to thank you for being here
p342
aVand I want to end this in five seconds of silence.
p343
aa(lp344
VThank you.

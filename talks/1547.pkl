VI'm afraid I'm one of those speakers
p5
aVyou hope you're not going to meet at TED.
p6
aVFirst, I don't have a mobile,
p7
aVso I'm on the safe side.
p8
aVSecondly, a political theorist
p9
aVwho's going to talk about the crisis of democracy
p10
aVis probably not the most exciting topic you can think about.
p11
aVAnd plus, I'm not going to give you any answers.
p12
aVI'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about.
p13
aVAnd one of the things that I want to question
p14
aVis this very popular hope these days
p15
aVthat transparency and openness
p16
aVcan restore the trust in democratic institutions.
p17
aa(lp18
VThere is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me.
p19
aVYou people, the Church of TED, are a very optimistic community.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVBasically you believe in complexity, but not in ambiguity.
p22
aVAs you have been told, I'm Bulgarian.
p23
aVAnd according to the surveys,
p24
aVwe are marked the most pessimistic people in the world.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVThe Economist magazine recently wrote an article
p27
aVcovering one of the recent studies on happiness,
p28
aVand the title was "The Happy, the Unhappy and the Bulgarians."
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VSo now when you know what to expect,
p33
aVlet's give you the story.
p34
aVAnd this is a rainy election day in a small country \u2014
p35
aVthat can be my country, but could be also your country.
p36
aVAnd because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon,
p37
aVnobody went to the polling stations.
p38
aVBut then the rain stopped,
p39
aVpeople went to vote.
p40
aVAnd when the votes had been counted,
p41
aVthree-fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot.
p42
aVThe government and the opposition,
p43
aVthey have been simply paralyzed.
p44
aVBecause you know what to do about the protests.
p45
aVYou know who to arrest, who to negotiate with.
p46
aVBut what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?
p47
aVSo the government decided to have the elections once again.
p48
aVAnd this time even a greater number,
p49
aV83 percent of the people, voted with blank ballots.
p50
aVBasically they went to the ballot boxes
p51
aVto tell that they have nobody to vote for.
p52
aa(lp53
VThis is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago
p54
aVcalled "Seeing."
p55
aVBut in my view it very well captures
p56
aVpart of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days.
p57
aVOn one level nobody's questioning
p58
aVthat democracy is the best form of government.
p59
aVDemocracy is the only game in town.
p60
aVThe problem is that many people start to believe
p61
aVthat it is not a game worth playing.
p62
aa(lp63
VFor the last 30 years, political scientists have observed
p64
aVthat there is a constant decline in electoral turnout,
p65
aVand the people who are least interested to vote
p66
aVare the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.
p67
aVI mean the unemployed, the under-privileged.
p68
aVAnd this is a major issue.
p69
aVBecause especially now with the economic crisis,
p70
aVyou can see that the trust in politics,
p71
aVthat the trust in democratic institutions,
p72
aVwas really destroyed.
p73
aVAccording to the latest survey being done by the European Commission,
p74
aV89 percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap
p75
aVbetween the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public.
p76
aVOnly 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeks
p77
aVbelieve that their vote matters.
p78
aVBasically people start to understand that they can change governments,
p79
aVbut they cannot change policies.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd the question which I want to ask is the following:
p82
aVHow did it happen that we are living in societies
p83
aVwhich are much freer than ever before \u2014
p84
aVwe have more rights, we can travel easier,
p85
aVwe have access to more information \u2014
p86
aVat the same time that trust in our democratic institutions
p87
aVbasically has collapsed?
p88
aVSo basically I want to ask:
p89
aVWhat went right and what went wrong in these 50 years
p90
aVwhen we talk about democracy?
p91
aVAnd I'll start with what went right.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd the first thing that went right was, of course,
p94
aVthese five revolutions which, in my view,
p95
aVvery much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience.
p96
aVAnd the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s,
p97
aVwhich put the individual at the center of politics.
p98
aVIt was the human rights moment.
p99
aVBasically this was also a major outbreak, a culture of dissent,
p100
aVa culture of basically non-conformism,
p101
aVwhich was not known before.
p102
aVSo I do believe that even things like that
p103
aVare very much the children of '68 \u2014
p104
aVnevertheless that most of us had been even not born then.
p105
aVBut after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s.
p106
aVAnd nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it,
p107
aVthe truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message:
p108
aV"The government does not know better."
p109
aVAnd you have more choice-driven societies.
p110
aVAnd of course, you have 1989 \u2014 the end of Communism, the end of the Cold War.
p111
aVAnd it was the birth of the global world.
p112
aVAnd you have the Internet.
p113
aVAnd this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach
p114
aVto what extent the Internet empowered people.
p115
aVIt has changed the way we are communicating
p116
aVand basically we are viewing politics.
p117
aVThe very idea of political community totally has changed.
p118
aVAnd I'm going to name one more revolution,
p119
aVand this is the revolution in brain sciences,
p120
aVwhich totally changed the way
p121
aVwe understand how people are making decisions.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo this is what went right.
p124
aVBut if we're going to see what went wrong,
p125
aVwe're going to end up with the same five revolutions.
p126
aVBecause first you have the 1960s and 1970s,
p127
aVcultural and social revolution,
p128
aVwhich in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.
p129
aVThe very idea, all these collective nouns that we have been taught about \u2014
p130
aVnation, class, family.
p131
aVWe start to like divorcing, if we're married at all.
p132
aVAll this was very much under attack.
p133
aVAnd it is so difficult to engage people in politics
p134
aVwhen they believe that what really matters
p135
aVis where they personally stand.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd you have the market revolution of the 1980s
p138
aVand the huge increase of inequality in societies.
p139
aVRemember, until the 1970s,
p140
aVthe spread of democracy has always been accompanied
p141
aVby the decline of inequality.
p142
aVThe more democratic our societies have been,
p143
aVthe more equal they have been becoming.
p144
aVNow we have the reverse tendency.
p145
aVThe spread of democracy now is very much accompanied
p146
aVby the increase in inequality.
p147
aVAnd I find this very much disturbing
p148
aVwhen we're talking about what's going on right and wrong
p149
aVwith democracy these days.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd if you go to 1989 \u2014
p152
aVsomething that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize \u2014
p153
aVbut many are going to tell you, "Listen, it was the end of the Cold War
p154
aVthat tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe."
p155
aVWhen the Soviet Union was still there,
p156
aVthe rich and the powerful, they needed the people,
p157
aVbecause they feared them.
p158
aVNow the elites basically have been liberated.
p159
aVThey're very mobile. You cannot tax them.
p160
aVAnd basically they don't fear the people.
p161
aVSo as a result of it, you have this very strange situation
p162
aVin which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters.
p163
aVSo this is not by accident
p164
aVthat the voters are not interested to vote anymore.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd when we talk about the Internet,
p167
aVyes, it's true, the Internet connected all of us,
p168
aVbut we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos
p169
aVin which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to.
p170
aVAnd it's becoming more and more difficult
p171
aVto understand the people who are not like you.
p172
aVI know that many people here
p173
aVhave been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation,
p174
aVbut [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days?
p175
aVThis is also partly a result of the Internet revolution.
p176
aVThis is the other side of the things that we like.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd when you go to the brain sciences,
p179
aVwhat political consultants learned from the brain scientists
p180
aVis don't talk to me about ideas anymore,
p181
aVdon't talk to me about policy programs.
p182
aVWhat really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.
p183
aVAnd you have this very strongly
p184
aVto the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days,
p185
aVthese revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas.
p186
aVBefore, revolutions used to have ideological names.
p187
aVThey could be communist, they could be liberal,
p188
aVthey could be fascist or Islamic.
p189
aVNow the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used.
p190
aVYou have Facebook revolutions, Twitter revolutions.
p191
aVThe content doesn't matter anymore, the problem is the media.
p192
aa(lp193
VI'm saying this because one of my major points
p194
aVis what went right is also what went wrong.
p195
aVAnd when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation,
p196
aVwhen basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy,
p197
aVwe should keep this ambiguity in mind.
p198
aVBecause probably some of the things that we love most
p199
aVare going to be also the things that can hurt us most.
p200
aVThese days it's very popular to believe
p201
aVthat this push for transparency,
p202
aVthis kind of a combination between active citizens, new technologies
p203
aVand much more transparency-friendly legislation
p204
aVcan restore trust in politics.
p205
aVYou believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this,
p206
aVit can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie,
p207
aVit's going to be more difficult for them to steal
p208
aVand probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill.
p209
aVThis is probably true.
p210
aVBut I do believe that we should be also very clear
p211
aVthat now when we put the transparency at the center of politics
p212
aVwhere the message is, "It's transparency, stupid."
p213
aa(lp214
VTransparency is not about restoring trust in institutions.
p215
aVTransparency is politics' management of mistrust.
p216
aVWe are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust.
p217
aVAnd by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy.
p218
aVThis is why you have checks and balances.
p219
aVThis is why basically you have all this creative mistrust
p220
aVbetween the representatives and those whom they represent.
p221
aVBut when politics is only management of mistrust,
p222
aVthen \u2014 I'm very glad that "1984" has been mentioned \u2014
p223
aVnow we're going to have "1984" in reverse.
p224
aVIt's not going to be the Big Brother watching you,
p225
aVit's going to be we being the Big Brother
p226
aVwatching the political class.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut is this the idea of a free society?
p229
aVFor example, can you imagine
p230
aVthat decent, civic, talented people are going to run for office
p231
aVif they really do believe
p232
aVthat politics is also about managing mistrust?
p233
aVAre you not afraid with all these technologies
p234
aVthat are going to track down
p235
aVany statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues,
p236
aVare you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians
p237
aVto repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions,
p238
aVbecause consistency is going to be more important than common sense?
p239
aVAnd the Americans who are in the room,
p240
aVare you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern
p241
aVon the basis of what they said in the primary elections?
p242
aa(lp243
VI find this extremely important,
p244
aVbecause democracy is about people changing their views
p245
aVbased on rational arguments and discussions.
p246
aVAnd we can lose this with the very noble idea
p247
aVto keep people accountable
p248
aVfor showing the people that we're not going to tolerate
p249
aVpoliticians the opportunism in politics.
p250
aVSo for me this is extremely important.
p251
aVAnd I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days,
p252
aVprobably it makes sense
p253
aVto look also at this type of a story.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut also don't forget, any unveiling is also veiling.
p256
aV[Regardless of] how transparent our governments want to be,
p257
aVthey're going to be selectively transparent.
p258
aVIn a small country that could be my country,
p259
aVbut could be also your country,
p260
aVthey took a decision \u2014 it is a real case story \u2014
p261
aVthat all of the governmental decisions,
p262
aVdiscussions of the council of ministers,
p263
aVwere going to be published on the Internet
p264
aV24 hours after the council discussions took place.
p265
aVAnd the public was extremely all for it.
p266
aVSo I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister,
p267
aVwhy he made this decision.
p268
aVHe said, "Listen, this is the best way
p269
aVto keep the mouths of my ministers closed.
p270
aVBecause it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent
p271
aVknowing that 24 hours after
p272
aVthis is going to be on the public space,
p273
aVand this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis."
p274
aa(lp275
VSo when we talk about transparency,
p276
aVwhen we talk about openness,
p277
aVI really do believe that what we should keep in mind
p278
aVis that what went right is what went wrong.
p279
aVAnd this is Goethe, who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist,
p280
aVsome centuries ago he said,
p281
aV"There is a big shadow where there is much light."
p282
aa(lp283
VThank you very much.

VHawa Abdi: Many people \u2014 20 years for Somalia \u2014
p5
aV[were] fighting.
p6
aVSo there was no job, no food.
p7
aVChildren, most of them,
p8
aVbecame very malnourished, like this.
p9
aVDeqo Mohamed: So as you know,
p10
aValways in a civil war,
p11
aVthe ones affected most [are] the women and children.
p12
aVSo our patients are women and children.
p13
aVAnd they are in our backyard.
p14
aVIt's our home. We welcome them.
p15
aVThat's the camp that we have in now
p16
aV90,000 people,
p17
aVwhere 75 percent of them are women and children.
p18
aVPat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside.
p19
aVHA: We are doing C-sections and different operations
p20
aVbecause people need some help.
p21
aVThere is no government to protect them.
p22
aVDM: Every morning we have about 400 patients,
p23
aVmaybe more or less.
p24
aVBut sometimes we are only five doctors
p25
aVand 16 nurses,
p26
aVand we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them.
p27
aVBut we take the severe ones,
p28
aVand we reschedule the other ones the next day.
p29
aVIt is very tough.
p30
aVAnd as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children;
p31
aVit's the women who come into the hospitals;
p32
aVit's the women [are] building the houses.
p33
aVThat's their house.
p34
aVAnd we have a school. This is our bright \u2014
p35
aVwe opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school
p36
aVwhere we have 850 children,
p37
aVand the majority are women and girls.
p38
aV(Applause)
p39
aVPM: And the doctors have some very big rules
p40
aVabout who can get treated at the clinic.
p41
aVWould you explain the rules for admission?
p42
aVHA: The people who are coming to us,
p43
aVwe are welcoming.
p44
aVWe are sharing with them
p45
aVwhatever we have.
p46
aVBut there are only two rules.
p47
aVFirst rule:
p48
aVthere is no clan distinguished and political division
p49
aVin Somali society.
p50
aV[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.
p51
aVThe second:
p52
aVno man can beat his wife.
p53
aVIf he beat,
p54
aVwe will put [him] in jail,
p55
aVand we will call the eldest people.
p56
aVUntil they identify this case,
p57
aVwe'll never release him.
p58
aVThat's our two rules.
p59
aV(Applause)
p60
aVThe other thing that I have realized,
p61
aVthat the woman is the most strong person
p62
aVall over the world.
p63
aVBecause the last 20 years,
p64
aVthe Somali woman has stood up.
p65
aVThey were the leaders,
p66
aVand we are the leaders
p67
aVof our community
p68
aVand the hope of our future generations.
p69
aVWe are not just the helpless
p70
aVand the victims of the civil war.
p71
aVWe can reconcile.
p72
aVWe can do everything.
p73
aV(Applause)
p74
aVDM: As my mother said, we are the future hope,
p75
aVand the men are only killing in Somalia.
p76
aVSo we came up with these two rules.
p77
aVIn a camp with 90,000 people,
p78
aVyou have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights.
p79
aVSo there is no clan division,
p80
aVand no man can beat his wife.
p81
aVAnd we have a little storage room
p82
aVwhere we converted a jail.
p83
aVSo if you beat your wife, you're going to be there.
p84
aV(Applause)
p85
aVSo empowering the women and giving the opportunity \u2014
p86
aVwe are there for them. They are not alone for this.
p87
aVPM: You're running a medical clinic.
p88
aVIt brought much, much needed medical care
p89
aVto people who wouldn't get it.
p90
aVYou're also running a civil society.
p91
aVYou've created your own rules,
p92
aVin which women and children
p93
aVare getting a different sense of security.
p94
aVTalk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi,
p95
aVand your decision, Dr. Mohamed,
p96
aVto work together \u2014
p97
aVfor you to become a doctor
p98
aVand to work with your mother in these circumstances.
p99
aVHA: My age \u2014
p100
aVbecause I was born in 1947 \u2014
p101
aVwe were having, at that time,
p102
aVgovernment, law and order.
p103
aVBut one day, I went to the hospital \u2014
p104
aVmy mother was sick \u2014
p105
aVand I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors,
p106
aVhow they [are] committed
p107
aVto help the sick people.
p108
aVI admired them,
p109
aVand I decided to become a doctor.
p110
aVMy mother died, unfortunately,
p111
aVwhen I was 12 years [old].
p112
aVThen my father allowed me
p113
aVto proceed [with] my hope.
p114
aVMy mother died
p115
aVin [a] gynecology complication,
p116
aVso I decided to become
p117
aVa gynecology specialist.
p118
aVThat's why I became a doctor.
p119
aVSo Dr. Deqo has to explain.
p120
aVDM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child
p121
aVto become a doctor, but I really didn't want to.
p122
aVMaybe I should become an historian,
p123
aVor maybe a reporter.
p124
aVI loved it, but it didn't work.
p125
aVWhen the war broke out \u2014 civil war \u2014
p126
aVI saw how my mother was helping
p127
aVand how she really needed the help,
p128
aVand how the care is essential to the woman
p129
aVto be a woman doctor in Somalia
p130
aVand help the women and children.
p131
aVAnd I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVSo I went to Russia, and my mother also,
p134
aV[during the] time of [the] Soviet Union.
p135
aVSo some of our character,
p136
aVmaybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training.
p137
aVSo that's how I decided [to do] the same.
p138
aVMy sister was different.
p139
aVShe's here. She's also a doctor.
p140
aVShe graduated in Russia also.
p141
aV(Applause)
p142
aVAnd to go back and to work with our mother
p143
aVis just what we saw in the civil war \u2014
p144
aVwhen I was 16, and my sister was 11,
p145
aVwhen the civil war broke out.
p146
aVSo it was the need and the people we saw
p147
aVin the early '90s \u2014
p148
aVthat's what made us go back
p149
aVand work for them.
p150
aVPM: So what is the biggest challenge
p151
aVworking, mother and daughter,
p152
aVin such dangerous
p153
aVand sometimes scary situations?
p154
aVHA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation,
p155
aVvery dangerous.
p156
aVAnd when I saw the people who needed me,
p157
aVI was staying with them to help,
p158
aVbecause I [could] do something for them.
p159
aVMost people fled abroad.
p160
aVBut I remained with those people,
p161
aVand I was trying to do something \u2014
p162
aV[any] little thing I [could] do.
p163
aVI succeeded in my place.
p164
aVNow my place is 90,000 people
p165
aVwho are respecting each other,
p166
aVwho are not fighting.
p167
aVBut we try to stand on our feet,
p168
aVto do something, little things, we can for our people.
p169
aVAnd I'm thankful for my daughters.
p170
aVWhen they come to me,
p171
aVthey help me to treat the people,
p172
aVto help.
p173
aVThey do everything for them.
p174
aVThey have done what I desire to do for them.
p175
aVPM: What's the best part
p176
aVof working with your mother,
p177
aVand the most challenging part for you?
p178
aVDM: She's very tough; it's most challenging.
p179
aVShe always expects us to do more.
p180
aVAnd really when you think [you] cannot do it,
p181
aVshe will push you, and I can do it.
p182
aVThat's the best part.
p183
aVShe shows us, trains us how to do
p184
aVand how to be better [people]
p185
aVand how to do long hours in surgery \u2014
p186
aV300 patients per day,
p187
aV10, 20 surgeries,
p188
aVand still you have to manage the camp \u2014
p189
aVthat's how she trains us.
p190
aVIt is not like beautiful offices here,
p191
aV20 patients, you're tired.
p192
aVYou see 300 patients, 20 surgeries
p193
aVand 90,000 people to manage.
p194
aVPM: But you do it for good reasons.
p195
aV(Applause)
p196
aVWait. Wait.
p197
aVHA: Thank you.
p198
aVDM: Thank you.
p199
aV(Applause)
p200
aVHA: Thank you very much. DM: Thank you very much.

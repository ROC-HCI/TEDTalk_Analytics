VSome people think that there's a TED Talk formula:
p5
aa(lp6
V"Give a talk on a round, red rug."
p7
aa(lp8
V"Share a childhood story."
p9
aa(lp10
V"Divulge a personal secret."
p11
aa(lp12
V"End with an inspiring call to action."
p13
aa(lp14
VNo.
p15
aVThat's not how to think of a TED Talk.
p16
aVIn fact, if you overuse those devices,
p17
aVyou're just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common,
p20
aVand I would like to share that thing with you,
p21
aa(lp22
Vbecause over the past 12 years, I've had a ringside seat,
p23
aVlistening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers, like these.
p24
aVI've helped them prepare their talks for prime time,
p25
aVand learned directly from them
p26
aVtheir secrets of what makes for a great talk.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd even though these speakers and their topics all seem
p29
aVcompletely different,
p30
aVthey actually do have one key common ingredient.
p31
aVAnd it's this:
p32
aVYour number one task as a speaker
p33
aVis to transfer into your listeners' minds an extraordinary gift \u2014
p34
aVa strange and beautiful object that we call an idea.
p35
aa(lp36
VLet me show you what I mean.
p37
aVHere's Haley.
p38
aVShe is about to give a TED Talk
p39
aVand frankly, she's terrified.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!
p42
aa(lp43
V(Applause)
p44
aa(lp45
VOver the course of 18 minutes,
p46
aV1,200 people, many of whom have never seen each other before,
p47
aVare finding that their brains are starting to sync with Haley's brain
p48
aVand with each other.
p49
aVThey're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns.
p50
aVAnd I don't just mean they're feeling the same emotions.
p51
aVThere's something even more startling happening.
p52
aa(lp53
VLet's take a look inside Haley's brain for a moment.
p54
aVThere are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle.
p55
aVBut look here, right here \u2014
p56
aVa few million of them are linked to each other
p57
aVin a way which represents a single idea.
p58
aVAnd incredibly, this exact pattern is being recreated in real time
p59
aVinside the minds of everyone listening.
p60
aVThat's right; in just a few minutes,
p61
aVa pattern involving millions of neurons
p62
aVis being teleported into 1,200 minds,
p63
aVjust by people listening to a voice and watching a face.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut wait \u2014 what is an idea anyway?
p66
aVWell, you can think of it as a pattern of information
p67
aVthat helps you understand and navigate the world.
p68
aVIdeas come in all shapes and sizes,
p69
aVfrom the complex and analytical
p70
aVto the simple and aesthetic.
p71
aa(lp72
VHere are just a few examples shared from the TED stage.
p73
aVSir Ken Robinson \u2014 creativity is key to our kids' future.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Video) Sir Ken Robinson: My contention is that creativity now
p76
aVis as important in education as literacy,
p77
aVand we should treat it with the same status.
p78
aa(lp79
VChris Anderson: Elora Hardy \u2014 building from bamboo is beautiful.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Video) Elora Hardy: It is growing all around us,
p82
aVit's strong, it's elegant, it's earthquake-resistant.
p83
aa(lp84
VCA: Chimamanda Adichie \u2014 people are more than a single identity.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Video) Chimamanda Adichie: The single story creates stereotypes,
p87
aVand the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue,
p88
aVbut that they are incomplete.
p89
aa(lp90
VCA: Your mind is teeming with ideas,
p91
aVand not just randomly.
p92
aVThey're carefully linked together.
p93
aVCollectively they form an amazingly complex structure
p94
aVthat is your personal worldview.
p95
aVIt's your brain's operating system.
p96
aVIt's how you navigate the world.
p97
aVAnd it is built up out of millions of individual ideas.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, for example, if one little component of your worldview
p100
aVis the idea that kittens are adorable,
p101
aVthen when you see this,
p102
aVyou'll react like this.
p103
aVBut if another component of your worldview
p104
aVis the idea that leopards are dangerous,
p105
aVthen when you see this,
p106
aVyou'll react a little bit differently.
p107
aVSo, it's pretty obvious
p108
aVwhy the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial.
p109
aVYou need them to be as reliable as possible \u2014 a guide,
p110
aVto the scary but wonderful real world out there.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, different people's worldviews can be dramatically different.
p113
aVFor example,
p114
aVhow does your worldview react when you see this image:
p115
aa(lp116
V(Video) Dalia Mogahed: What do you think when you look at me?
p117
aV"A woman of faith," "an expert," maybe even "a sister"?
p118
aVOr "oppressed," "brainwashed,"
p119
aV"a terrorist"?
p120
aa(lp121
VCA: Whatever your answer,
p122
aVthere are millions of people out there who would react very differently.
p123
aVSo that's why ideas really matter.
p124
aVIf communicated properly, they're capable of changing, forever,
p125
aVhow someone thinks about the world,
p126
aVand shaping their actions both now and well into the future.
p127
aVIdeas are the most powerful force shaping human culture.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo if you accept
p130
aVthat your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea
p131
aVinside the minds of your audience,
p132
aVhere are four guidelines for how you should go about that task:
p133
aa(lp134
VOne, limit your talk to just one major idea.
p135
aVIdeas are complex things;
p136
aVyou need to slash back your content so that you can focus
p137
aVon the single idea you're most passionate about,
p138
aVand give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly.
p139
aVYou have to give context, share examples, make it vivid.
p140
aVSo pick one idea,
p141
aVand make it the through-line running through your entire talk,
p142
aVso that everything you say links back to it in some way.
p143
aa(lp144
VTwo, give your listeners a reason to care.
p145
aVBefore you can start building things inside the minds of your audience,
p146
aVyou have to get their permission to welcome you in.
p147
aVAnd the main tool to achieve that?
p148
aVCuriosity.
p149
aVStir your audience's curiosity.
p150
aVUse intriguing, provocative questions
p151
aVto identify why something doesn't make sense and needs explaining.
p152
aVIf you can reveal a disconnection in someone's worldview,
p153
aVthey'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap.
p154
aVAnd once you've sparked that desire,
p155
aVit will be so much easier to start building your idea.
p156
aa(lp157
VThree, build your idea, piece by piece,
p158
aVout of concepts that your audience already understands.
p159
aVYou use the power of language
p160
aVto weave together concepts that already exist
p161
aVin your listeners' minds \u2014
p162
aVbut not your language, their language.
p163
aVYou start where they are.
p164
aVThe speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with
p165
aVare completely unfamiliar to their audiences.
p166
aVNow, metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together,
p167
aVbecause they reveal the desired shape of the pattern,
p168
aVbased on an idea that the listener already understands.
p169
aa(lp170
VFor example, when Jennifer Kahn
p171
aVwanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR,
p172
aVshe said, "It's as if, for the first time,
p173
aVyou had a word processor to edit DNA.
p174
aVCRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily."
p175
aVNow, a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment
p176
aVas it snaps into place in our minds.
p177
aVIt's important, therefore, to test your talk on trusted friends,
p178
aVand find out which parts they get confused by.
p179
aa(lp180
VFour, here's the final tip:
p181
aVMake your idea worth sharing.
p182
aVBy that I mean, ask yourself the question:
p183
aV"Who does this idea benefit?"
p184
aVAnd I need you to be honest with the answer.
p185
aVIf the idea only serves you or your organization,
p186
aVthen, I'm sorry to say, it's probably not worth sharing.
p187
aVThe audience will see right through you.
p188
aVBut if you believe that the idea has the potential
p189
aVto brighten up someone else's day
p190
aVor change someone else's perspective for the better
p191
aVor inspire someone to do something differently,
p192
aVthen you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk,
p193
aVone that can be a gift to them and to all of us.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\\"p1\\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>", "slug": "chris_anderson_ted", "whotheyare": "After a long career in journalism and publishing, Chris Anderson became the curator of the TED Conference in 2002 and has developed it as a platform for identifying and disseminating ideas worth spreading.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 187, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/15a78b07d0340fcf8f391e7529b6f4b050a60cc0_254x191.jpg"}], "current_talk": 2485, "description": "There\'s no single formula for a great talk, but there is a secret ingredient that all the best ones have in common.

Curator of TED, a nonprofit devoted to sharing valuable ideas, primarily through the medium of &#39;TED Talks&#39; -- short talks that are offered free online to a global audience.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Chris was born in a remote village in Pakistan in 1957. He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\\"p1\\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>", "slug": "chris_anderson_ted", "whotheyare": "After a long career in journalism and publishing, Chris Anderson became the curator of the TED Conference in 2002 and has developed it as a platform for identifying and disseminating ideas worth spreading.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 187, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/15a78b07d0340fcf8f391e7529b6f4b050a60cc0_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "TED\'s secret to great public speaking", "take_action": [], "comments": 27103, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "start_at": null, "author": "Chris Anderson", "headline": "TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking", "link_url": "http://www.amazon.com/TED-Talks-Official-Public-Speaking/dp/0544634497/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20", "published": true, "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "http://tedcdnpe-a.akamaihd.net/images/ted/bae9943b7010b8d83c0cca96523a988ba1dc3b80_596x908.jpg", "year": "2016", "type": "book", "blurb": null}], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/69d74807799b754a4ce42394fb5b2134766f27f2_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "There\'s no single formula for a great talk, but there is a secret ingredient that all the best ones have in common.

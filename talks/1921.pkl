VHi. So today, I'd like to share some works in progress.
p5
aVSince we are still realizing these works,
p6
aVwe are largely working within the realm
p7
aVof intuition and mystery, still.
p8
aVSo I'm going to try and describe
p9
aVsome of the experiences that we're looking for
p10
aVthrough each of the works.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes.
p13
aVA viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room,
p14
aVand catches a glimpse of these panels
p15
aVin a messy composition on the wall.
p16
aVWithin seconds, as if the panels have noticed
p17
aVthe presence of the viewer,
p18
aVthey appear to panic and sort of get into
p19
aVa strict symmetry.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVSo this is the sketch of the two states.
p22
aVOne is total chaos. The other is absolute order.
p23
aVAnd we were interested in seeing how little change
p24
aVit takes to move from one state to the other state.
p25
aVThis also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions.
p26
aVOne is the altar tablets of the 15th century,
p27
aVand the other is about 100 years ago,
p28
aVMalevich's abstract compositions.
p29
aVSo I'm just going to take you to a video.
p30
aVTo give you a sense of scale,
p31
aVthe largest panel is about two meters high.
p32
aVThat's about this much.  And the smallest one is an A4.
p33
aVSo a viewer enters the space,
p34
aVand they snap to attention.
p35
aVAnd after a while, if the viewer continues
p36
aVto remain in the space,
p37
aVthe panels will sort of become immune
p38
aVto the presence of the viewer
p39
aVand become lax and autonomous again,
p40
aVuntil they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement,
p41
aVwhen they will again snap to attention.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVSo here it appears as if it's the viewer
p44
aVthat's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels,
p45
aVbut it could also be the other way around,
p46
aVthat the panels are so stuck within
p47
aVtheir preconditioned behaviors
p48
aVthat they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo this brings me to a quieter, small work
p51
aVcalled Handheld.
p52
aVThe viewer sees a piece of paper
p53
aVthat's mounted on the far end of the wall,
p54
aVbut when you go closer, you see that it's a blank
p55
aVA4, or a letter-sized piece of paper,
p56
aVthat's held on either side
p57
aVby two small hands
p58
aVthat appear to be carved with a great deal
p59
aVof attention and care from a small block of wood.
p60
aVThe viewer also sees that this entire sculpture
p61
aVis sort of moving very slightly,
p62
aVas if these two hands are trying
p63
aVto hold the paper very still
p64
aVfor a long period of time,
p65
aVand somehow are not managing to.
p66
aVSo this instability in the movement
p67
aVvery closely resembles the unsteady nature
p68
aVof images seen through a handheld camera.
p69
aVSo here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.
p70
aVOne is through a still camera
p71
aVand the other is through a handheld camera.
p72
aVAnd you immediately see how the unsteady nature
p73
aVof the video suggests the presence
p74
aVof an observer and a subjective point of view.
p75
aVSo we've just removed the camera
p76
aVand transferred that movement onto the panel.
p77
aVSo here's a video.
p78
aVYou have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet.
p79
aVBut to us, we're sort of trying to evoke
p80
aVa self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person
p81
aVwith outstretched arms
p82
aVbehind this enormous piece of paper.
p83
aVThat sort of likens it to the amount of strain
p84
aVto be at the service of the observer and present
p85
aVthis piece of paper very delicately to the viewer
p86
aVin front of them.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe next work is Decoy.
p89
aVThis is a cardboard model, so the object
p90
aVis about as tall as I am.
p91
aVIt has a rounded body, two arms,
p92
aVand a very tall, head-like antenna,
p93
aVand its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself.
p94
aVSo when a viewer passes by,
p95
aVit sort of tilts from side to side,
p96
aVand moves its arms more and more frantically
p97
aVas the person gets closer.
p98
aVSo here is the first test scenario.
p99
aVYou see the two movements integrated,
p100
aVand the object seems to be employing
p101
aVits entire being in this expression of desperation.
p102
aVBut the idea is that once it's got the person's attention,
p103
aVit's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVSo this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.
p106
aVIt appears to be mass-manufactured
p107
aVlike it came out of a factory
p108
aVlike vacuum cleaners and washing machines.
p109
aVBecause we are always working
p110
aVfrom a very personal space,
p111
aVwe like how this consumer aesthetic
p112
aVsort of depersonalizes the object
p113
aVand gives us a bit of distance
p114
aVin its appearance, at least.
p115
aVAnd so to us this is a kind of sinister being
p116
aVwhich is trying to distract you from the things
p117
aVthat actually need your attention,
p118
aVbut it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.
p119
aVThe next work is an object,
p120
aVthat's also a kind of sound instrument.
p121
aVIn the shape of an amphitheater
p122
aVthat's scaled to the size of an audience
p123
aVas perceived from somebody from the stage.
p124
aVSo from where I'm standing,
p125
aVeach of you appears to be this big,
p126
aVand the audience sort of takes the entire
p127
aVfield of my vision.
p128
aVSeated in this audience are 996 small figures.
p129
aVThey're mechanically enabled to clap
p130
aVof their own free will.
p131
aVThis means that each of them can decide
p132
aVif and when they want to clap,
p133
aVhow hard, for how long,
p134
aVhow they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others,
p135
aVand if they want to contribute to innovation.
p136
aVSo when the viewer steps in front of the audience,
p137
aVthere will be a response.
p138
aVIt could be a few claps or a strong applause,
p139
aVand then nothing happens until the viewer
p140
aVleaves the stage, and again the audience will respond.
p141
aVIt could be anything from a few feeble claps
p142
aVfrom members in the audience,
p143
aVor it could be a very loud ovation.
p144
aVSo to us, I think we're really looking
p145
aVat an audience as its own object
p146
aVor its own organism
p147
aVthat's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it,
p148
aVan instrument.
p149
aVSo the viewer can play it
p150
aVby eliciting quite complex and varied,
p151
aVnuanced musical or sound patterns,
p152
aVbut cannot really provoke the audience
p153
aVinto any particular kind of response.
p154
aVSo there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness
p155
aVand uneasiness involved.
p156
aVIt also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.
p157
aVSo here if you see we're quite excited about
p158
aVthe image of the head splitting to form the two hands.
p159
aVSo here's a small visual animation,
p160
aVas if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing
p161
aVagainst each other to kind of make sense
p162
aVof the duality and the tension.
p163
aVAnd here is a prototype.
p164
aVSo we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.
p165
aa(lp166
VOkay, this is the last work. It's called the Framerunners.
p167
aVIt comes out of the idea of a window.
p168
aVThis is an actual window in our studio,
p169
aVand as you can see, it's made up of three
p170
aVdifferent thicknesses of wooden sections.
p171
aVSo we used the same window vocabulary
p172
aVto construct our own frame or grid
p173
aVthat's suspended in the room and that can
p174
aVbe viewed from two sides.
p175
aVThis grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.
p176
aVThey're also made up of three different sizes,
p177
aVas if to suggest a kind of perspective
p178
aVor landscape on the single plain.
p179
aVEach of these figures can also run backward
p180
aVand forward in the track
p181
aVand hide behind two adjacent tracks.
p182
aVSo in contrast to this very tight grid,
p183
aVwe wanted to give these figures a very comical
p184
aVand slapstick-like quality,
p185
aVas if a puppeteer has taken them
p186
aVand physically animated them down the path.
p187
aVSo we like the idea of these figures
p188
aVsort of skipping along
p189
aVlike they're oblivious and carefree
p190
aVand happy-go-lucky and content,
p191
aVuntil they sort of sense a movement from the viewer
p192
aVand they will hide behind the fastest wall.
p193
aVSo to us, this work also presents its own contradiction.
p194
aVThese figures are sort of entrapped
p195
aVwithin this very strong grid,
p196
aVwhich is like a prison, but also a fortress,
p197
aVbecause it allows them to be oblivious
p198
aVand naive and carefree and quite oblivious
p199
aVof the external world.
p200
aVSo all these real life qualities that I talk about
p201
aVare sort of translated to a very specific
p202
aVtechnical configuration,
p203
aVand we were very lucky to collaborate
p204
aVwith ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.
p205
aVSo you see they extracted the motion cogs
p206
aVfrom our animations and created a wiggle
p207
aVthat integrated the head-bobbing movement
p208
aVand the back-and-forth movement.
p209
aVSo it's really quite small.
p210
aVYou can see it can fit into the palm of my hand.
p211
aVSo imagine our excitement when we saw it
p212
aVreally working in the studio, and here it is.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VThank you.

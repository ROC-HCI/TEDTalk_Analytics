VOnce there was a star.
p5
aVLike everything else, she was born;
p6
aVgrew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun
p7
aVand lived for a very long time.
p8
aVExactly how long,
p9
aVpeople cannot really tell.
p10
aVJust like everything in life,
p11
aVshe reached the end of her regular star days
p12
aVwhen her heart, the core of her life,
p13
aVexhausted its fuel.
p14
aVBut that was no end.
p15
aa(lp16
VShe transformed into a supernova, and in the process
p17
aVreleasing a tremendous amount of energy,
p18
aVoutshining the rest of the galaxy
p19
aVand emitting, in one second,
p20
aVthe same amount of energy our sun will release in 10 days.
p21
aVAnd she evolved into another role in our galaxy.
p22
aa(lp23
VSupernova explosions are very extreme.
p24
aVBut the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme.
p25
aVIn the process of becoming a supernova,
p26
aVthe interior of the star collapses under its own weight
p27
aVand it starts rotating ever faster,
p28
aVlike an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body.
p29
aVIn that way, it starts rotating very fast and it increases, powerfully,
p30
aVits magnetic field.
p31
aVThe matter around the star is dragged around,
p32
aVand some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter
p33
aVand the magnetic field is increased even further.
p34
aVIn that way, our star had extra energy to outshine the rest of the galaxy
p35
aVin brightness and gamma ray emission.
p36
aa(lp37
VMy star, the one in my story,
p38
aVbecame what is known as a magnetar.
p39
aVAnd just for your information,
p40
aVthe magnetic field of a magnetar is 1,000 trillion times
p41
aVthe magnetic field of Earth.
p42
aVThe most energetic events ever measured by astronomers
p43
aVcarry the name gamma-ray bursts
p44
aVbecause we observe them as bursts most or explosions,
p45
aVmost strongly measured as gamma-ray light.
p46
aVOur star, like the one in our story that became a magnetar,
p47
aVis detected as a gamma-ray burst
p48
aVduring the most energetic portion of the explosion.
p49
aVYet, even though gamma-ray bursts are the strongest events
p50
aVever measured by astronomers,
p51
aVwe cannot see them with our naked eye.
p52
aVWe depend, we rely on other methods
p53
aVin order to study this gamma-ray light.
p54
aVWe cannot see them with our naked eye.
p55
aVWe can only see an itty bitty, tiny portion
p56
aVof the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light.
p57
aVAnd beyond that, we rely on other methods.
p58
aa(lp59
VYet as astronomers, we study a wider range of light
p60
aVand we depend on other methods to do that.
p61
aVOn the screen, it may look like this.
p62
aVYou're seeing a plot.
p63
aVThat is a light curve.
p64
aVIt's a plot of intensity of light over time.
p65
aVIt is a gamma-ray light curve.
p66
aVSighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot
p67
aVin order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time.
p68
aVOn the left, you will be seeing the light intensity without a burst,
p69
aVand on the right, you will be seeing the light intensity with the burst.
p70
aa(lp71
VEarly during my career, I could also see this kind of plot.
p72
aVBut then, I lost my sight.
p73
aVI completely lost my sight because of extended illness,
p74
aVand with it, I lost the opportunity to see this plot
p75
aVand the opportunity to do my physics.
p76
aVIt was a very strong transition for me in many ways.
p77
aVAnd professionally, it left me without a way to do my science.
p78
aVI longed to access and scrutinize this energetic light
p79
aVand figure out the astrophysical cause.
p80
aVI wanted to experience the spacious wonder, the excitement,
p81
aVthe joy produced by the detection of such a titanic celestial event.
p82
aa(lp83
VI thought long and hard about it,
p84
aVwhen I suddenly realized that all a light curve is,
p85
aVis a table of numbers converted into a visual plot.
p86
aVSo along with my collaborators,
p87
aVwe worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound.
p88
aVI achieved access to the data,
p89
aVand today I'm able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer,
p90
aVusing sound.
p91
aVAnd what people have been able to do,
p92
aVmainly visually,
p93
aVfor hundreds of years,
p94
aVnow I do it using sound.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Applause)
p97
aVListening to this gamma-ray burst
p98
aVthat you're seeing on the \u2014 (Applause continues)
p99
aa(lp100
VThank you.
p101
aa(lp102
VListening to this burst that you're seeing on the screen
p103
aVbrought something to the ear beyond the obvious burst.
p104
aVNow I'm going to play the burst for you.
p105
aVIt's not music, it's sound.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Digital beeping sounds)
p108
aa(lp109
VThis is scientific data converted into sound,
p110
aVand it's mapped in pitch.
p111
aVThe process is called sonification.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo listening to this brought something to the ear
p114
aVbesides the obvious burst.
p115
aVWhen I examine the very strong low-frequency regions,
p116
aVor bass line \u2014 I'm zooming into the bass line now.
p117
aVWe noted resonances characteristic of electrically charged gasses
p118
aVlike the solar wind.
p119
aVAnd I want you to hear what I heard.
p120
aVYou will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume.
p121
aVAnd because you're sighted, I'm giving you a red line
p122
aVindicating what intensity of light is being converted into sound.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Digital hum and whistling sound)
p125
aa(lp126
VThe (Whistles) is frogs at home, don't pay attention to that.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
V(Digital hum and whistling sound)
p131
aa(lp132
VI think you heard it, right?
p133
aa(lp134
VSo what we found
p135
aVis that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances,
p136
aVwhich are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles
p137
aVthat may have been excited,
p138
aVthat depend on the volume.
p139
aVYou may remember that I said that the matter around the star
p140
aVis dragged around?
p141
aVIt transmits power with frequency and field distribution
p142
aVdetermined by the dimensions.
p143
aVYou may remember that we were talking about a super-massive star
p144
aVthat became a very strong magnetic field magnetar.
p145
aVIf this is the case, then outflows from the exploding star
p146
aVmay be associated with this gamma-ray burst.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhat does that mean?
p149
aVThat star formation may be a very important part
p150
aVof these supernova explosions.
p151
aVListening to this very gamma-ray burst brought us to the notion
p152
aVthat the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display
p153
aVmay also support sighted astronomers
p154
aVin the search for more information in the data.
p155
aVSimultaneously, I worked on analyzing measurements from other telescopes,
p156
aVand my experiments demonstrated
p157
aVthat when you use sound as an adjunctive visual display,
p158
aVastronomers can find more information
p159
aVin this now more accessible data set.
p160
aVThis ability to transform data into sound
p161
aVgives astronomy a tremendous power of transformation.
p162
aVAnd the fact that a field that is so visual may be improved
p163
aVin order to include anyone with interest in understanding what lies in the heavens
p164
aVis a spirit-lifter.
p165
aa(lp166
VWhen I lost my sight,
p167
aVI noticed that I didn't have access
p168
aVto the same amount and quality of information
p169
aVa sighted astronomer had.
p170
aVIt was not until we innovated with the sonification process
p171
aVthat I regained the hope to be a productive member of the field
p172
aVthat I had worked so hard to be part of.
p173
aa(lp174
VYet, information access is not the only area in astronomy
p175
aVwhere this is important.
p176
aVThe situation is systemic
p177
aVand scientific fields are not keeping up.
p178
aVThe body is something changeable \u2014
p179
aVanyone may develop a disability at any point.
p180
aVLet's think about, for example,
p181
aVscientists that are already at the top of their careers.
p182
aVWhat happens to them if they develop a disability?
p183
aVWill they feel excommunicated as I did?
p184
aVInformation access empowers us to flourish.
p185
aVIt gives us equal opportunities to display our talents
p186
aVand choose what we want to do with our lives,
p187
aVbased on interest and not based on potential barriers.
p188
aVWhen we give people the opportunity to succeed without limits,
p189
aVthat will lead to personal fulfillment and prospering life.
p190
aVAnd I think that the use of sound in astronomy
p191
aVis helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science.
p192
aa(lp193
VWhile other countries told me that the study of perception techniques
p194
aVin order to study astronomy data is not relevant to astronomy
p195
aVbecause there are no blind astronomers in the field,
p196
aVSouth Africa said, "We want people with disabilities
p197
aVto contribute to the field."
p198
aVRight now, I'm working
p199
aVat the South African Astronomical Observatory,
p200
aVat the Office of Astronomy for Development.
p201
aVThere, we are working on sonification techniques and analysis methods
p202
aVto impact the students of the Athlone School for the Blind.
p203
aVThese students will be learning radio astronomy,
p204
aVand they will be learning the sonification methods
p205
aVin order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy
p206
aVfrom the sun, known as coronal mass ejections.
p207
aVWhat we learn with these students \u2014
p208
aVthese students have multiple disabilities and coping strategies
p209
aVthat will be accommodated \u2014
p210
aVwhat we learn with these students will directly impact
p211
aVthe way things are being done at the professional level.
p212
aVI humbly call this development.
p213
aVAnd this is happening right now.
p214
aa(lp215
VI think that science is for everyone.
p216
aVIt belongs to the people,
p217
aVand it has to be available to everyone,
p218
aVbecause we are all natural explorers.
p219
aVI think that if we limit people with disabilities
p220
aVfrom participating in science,
p221
aVwe'll sever our links with history and with society.
p222
aVI dream of a level scientific playing field,
p223
aVwhere people encourage respect and respect each other,
p224
aVwhere people exchange strategies and discover together.
p225
aVIf people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field,
p226
aVan explosion, a huge titanic burst of knowledge will take place,
p227
aVI am sure.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Digital beeping sounds)
p230
aa(lp231
VThat is the titanic burst.
p232
aa(lp233
VThank you.
p234
aa(lp235
VThank you.

VOne of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.
p5
aVI love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.
p6
aVSo when I thought about compassion,
p7
aVmy mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,
p8
aVwhere he's lying there and he says,
p9
aV"I really understand, and I really appreciate
p10
aVhow one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.
p11
aVThe only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them."
p12
aVThis, in a way, is one of the challenges
p13
aVof how to interpret a really good idea.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe all, I think, believe in compassion.
p16
aVIf you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,
p17
aVyou'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.
p18
aVSo in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,
p19
aVthat you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.
p20
aVAnd within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,
p21
aVwho taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.
p22
aVAnd all the main religions have similar teachings.
p23
aVAnd again, within Judaism,
p24
aVwe have a teaching about God,
p25
aVwho is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.
p26
aVAfter all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?
p27
aVAnd we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,
p28
aVso we too have to be compassionate.
p29
aVBut what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?
p30
aVSometimes, of course, being compassionate
p31
aVcan produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.
p32
aa(lp33
VI know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral,
p34
aVor when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,
p35
aVand I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,
p36
aVthe challenge that is there for the family, for the person.
p37
aVAnd I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.
p38
aVAnd yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,
p39
aVI wouldn't be doing my job \u2014
p40
aVbecause I have to actually be there for them
p41
aVand make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.
p42
aVAnd yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,
p43
aVthen I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe
p44
aVand give up being a rabbi.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.
p47
aVWho cannot be touched by compassion
p48
aVwhen we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,
p49
aVor famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?
p50
aVI know some people who say
p51
aV"Well, you know there's just so much out there \u2014 I can't do anything,
p52
aVI'm not going to even begin to try."
p53
aVAnd there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.
p54
aVThere are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore,
p55
aVand so they turn off the television and don't watch.
p56
aVIn Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.
p57
aa(lp58
VYou have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others,
p59
aVbut you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life
p60
aVand be of help to people.
p61
aVSo part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.
p62
aVAnd, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation,
p65
aVwhich says that when God created the world,
p66
aVGod thought that it would be best to create the world
p67
aVonly with the divine attribute of justice.
p68
aVBecause, after all, God is just.
p69
aVTherefore, there should be justice throughout the world.
p70
aVAnd then God looked to the future and realized,
p71
aVif the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion."
p74
aVAnd then God looked to the future and realized that,
p75
aVin fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,
p76
aVthere would be anarchy and chaos.
p77
aVThere had to be limits to all things.
p78
aVThe rabbis describe this as being like a king
p79
aVwho has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.
p80
aVIf you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.
p81
aVIf you put boiling water in, it will shatter.
p82
aVWhat do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.
p83
aVAnd so God put both of these possibilities into the world.
p84
aa(lp85
VThere is something more though that has to be there.
p86
aVAnd that is the translation of the feelings
p87
aVthat we may have about compassion
p88
aVinto the wider world, into action.
p89
aVSo, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there
p90
aVand think great thoughts about our neighbors.
p91
aVWe actually have to do something about it.
p92
aVAnd so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness
p93
aVthat becomes very important: "chesed."
p94
aa(lp95
VAll these three things, then, have to be melded together.
p96
aVThe idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives
p97
aVand gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living,
p98
aVwhat should we be doing, social justice.
p99
aVThere has to be a willingness to do good deeds,
p100
aVbut not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.
p101
aVYou know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone
p102
aVif you overdo things.
p103
aVAnd balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,
p104
aVwhich has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.
p105
aa(lp106
VThis idea of compassion comes to us
p107
aVbecause we're made in the image of God,
p108
aVwho is ultimately the compassionate one.
p109
aVWhat does this compassion entail?
p110
aVIt entails understanding the pain of the other.
p111
aVBut even more than that,
p112
aVit means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation:
p113
aVunderstanding that one is part of that creation,
p114
aVthat there is a unity that underlies all that we see,
p115
aVall that we hear, all that we feel.
p116
aVI call that unity God.
p117
aVAnd that unity is something that connects all of creation.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement,
p120
aVwe're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,
p121
aVthat something I do here actually does matter in Africa,
p122
aVthat if I use too much of my carbon allowance,
p123
aVit seems to be that we are causing
p124
aVa great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.
p125
aVSo there is a connectivity,
p126
aVand I have to understand that \u2014 as part of the creation,
p127
aVas part of me being made in the image of God.
p128
aVAnd I have to understand that my needs
p129
aVsometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.
p130
aa(lp131
VThis "18 minutes" business, I find quite fascinating.
p132
aVBecause in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,
p133
aVstands for life \u2014 the word "life."
p134
aVSo, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,
p135
aV"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."
p136
aVBut, something else as well:
p137
aVactually, 18 minutes is important.
p138
aVBecause at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,
p139
aVthe rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,
p140
aVand dough that is made into unleavened bread, or "matzah"?
p141
aVAnd they say "It's 18 minutes."
p142
aVBecause that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.
p143
aVWhat does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?
p144
aVIt means it gets filled with hot air.
p145
aVWhat's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.
p146
aa(lp147
VSymbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover,
p148
aVwhat we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air \u2014 our pride,
p149
aVour feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,
p150
aVand that everything should revolve round us.
p151
aVSo we try and get rid of those,
p152
aVand so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas
p153
aVthat enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision
p154
aVso we don't see the needs of others \u2014
p155
aVand free ourselves and free ourselves from that.
p156
aVAnd that too is a basis for having compassion,
p157
aVfor understanding our place in the world.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story
p160
aVof a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.
p161
aVAnd, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.
p162
aVAnd as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.
p163
aVAnd they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,
p164
aVthe priests used to have bread,
p165
aVwhich they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.
p166
aVThe man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.
p167
aVHe said, "God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants."
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread,
p170
aVtook them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,
p171
aVopened the ark and said, "God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."
p172
aVAnd he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.
p173
aVThen he went home.
p174
aa(lp175
VThe cleaner came into the synagogue.
p176
aV"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.
p177
aVMy wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"
p178
aVHe goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me?
p179
aVAh, what a wonderful smell."
p180
aVHe goes to the ark. He opens the ark.
p181
aV"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question."
p182
aVTakes the bread and goes home.
p183
aa(lp184
VMeanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,
p185
aV"I'm an idiot. God wants bread?
p186
aVGod, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"
p187
aVHe rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."
p188
aVHe goes in there, and it's not there.
p189
aVAnd he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.
p190
aVNext week, with raisins."
p191
aa(lp192
VThis went on for years.
p193
aVEvery week, the man would bring bread with raisins,
p194
aVwith all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.
p195
aVEvery week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."
p196
aVTake the bread. Take it home.
p197
aa(lp198
VWent on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.
p199
aVThe rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
p200
aVAnd he called the two of them to his office.
p201
aVAnd he said, you know, "This is what's happening."
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd the rich man \u2014 oh, dear \u2014 crestfallen.
p204
aV"You mean God didn't want my bread?"
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd the poor man said, "And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?"
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd the rabbi said, "You've misunderstood me.
p209
aVYou've misunderstood totally," he said.
p210
aV"Of course, what you are doing," he said to the rich man,
p211
aV"is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate.
p212
aVAnd God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea
p213
aVthat people should be compassionate and give."
p214
aVHe looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said,
p215
aV"Don't you understand?" He said, "These are the hands of God."
p216
aa(lp217
VSo that is the way I feel:
p218
aVthat I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate,
p219
aVof understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world;
p220
aVthat I want to try and serve that unity,
p221
aVand that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope,
p222
aVtrying to understand something of the pain of others;
p223
aVbut understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility
p224
aVfor some of the problems that come upon them;
p225
aVand that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy,
p226
aVto the giving I can give.
p227
aVI have to reevaluate them,
p228
aVtry and separate out the material things
p229
aVand my emotions that may be enslaving me,
p230
aVso that I can see the world clearly.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd then I have to try to see in what ways
p233
aVI can make these the hands of God.
p234
aVAnd so try to bring compassion to life in this world.

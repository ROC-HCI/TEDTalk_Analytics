VOkay, this morning I'm speaking
p5
aVon the question of corruption.
p6
aVAnd corruption is defined
p7
aVas the abuse of a position of trust
p8
aVfor the benefit of yourself \u2014 or, in the case of our context,
p9
aVyour friends, your family or your financiers.
p10
aVOkay? Friends, family and financiers.
p11
aVBut we need to understand what we understand about corruption,
p12
aVand we need to understand that
p13
aVwe have been miseducated about it, and we have to admit that.
p14
aVWe have to have the courage to admit that
p15
aVto start changing how we deal with it.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe first thing is that the big myth, number one,
p18
aVis that in fact it's not really a crime.
p19
aVWhen we get together with friends and family
p20
aVand we discuss crime in our country,
p21
aVcrime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella,
p22
aVnobody's speaking about corruption.
p23
aVThat's the honest truth.
p24
aVWhen the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime,
p25
aVhe isn't speaking about corruption.
p26
aVAnd we know for sure when the Minister of National Security
p27
aVis speaking about crime, he's not talking about corruption either.
p28
aVThe point I'm making is that it is a crime.
p29
aVIt is an economic crime, because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money.
p30
aVPublic and private corruption is a reality.
p31
aVAs somebody who comes from the private sector,
p32
aVI can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption
p33
aVin the private sector that has nothing to do with government.
p34
aVThe same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table,
p35
aVit all takes place in the private sector.
p36
aVToday, I'm focusing on public sector corruption,
p37
aVwhich the private sector also participates in.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe second important myth to understand \u2014
p40
aVbecause we have to destroy these myths,
p41
aVdismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them \u2014
p42
aVthe second important myth to understand
p43
aVis the one that says
p44
aVthat in fact corruption is only a small problem \u2014
p45
aVif it is a problem, it's only a small problem,
p46
aVthat in fact it's only a little 10 or 15 percent,
p47
aVit's been going on forever, it probably will continue forever,
p48
aVand there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it.
p49
aVAnd I want to demonstrate that that, too,
p50
aVis a dangerous myth, very dangerous.
p51
aVIt's a piece of public mischief.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd I want to speak a little bit,
p54
aVtake us back about 30 years.
p55
aVWe're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago,
p56
aVa resource-rich, small Caribbean country,
p57
aVand in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth,
p58
aVand that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices.
p59
aVWe call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money.
p60
aVAnd it's ironic, because
p61
aVwe're standing today in the Central Bank.
p62
aVYou see, history's rich in irony.
p63
aVWe're standing today in the Central Bank,
p64
aVand the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about.
p65
aVOkay? We're talking about irresponsibility in public office.
p66
aVWe're speaking about the fact that across the terrace,
p67
aVthe next tower is the Ministry of Finance,
p68
aVand there's a lot of connection with us today,
p69
aVso we're speaking within your temple today. Okay?
p70
aa(lp71
V(Applause)
p72
aa(lp73
VThe first thing I want to talk about is that
p74
aVwhen all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago,
p75
aVwe embarked, the government of the day embarked
p76
aVon a series of government-to-government arrangements
p77
aVto have rapidly develop the country.
p78
aVAnd some of the largest projects in the country
p79
aVwere being constructed through government-to-government arrangements
p80
aVwith some of the leading countries in the world,
p81
aVthe United States and Britain and France and so on and so on.
p82
aVAs I said, even this building we're standing in \u2014 that's one of the ironies \u2014
p83
aVthis building was part of that series of complexes,
p84
aVwhat they called the Twin Towers.
p85
aVIt became so outrageous, the whole situation,
p86
aVthat in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed,
p87
aVand it reported in 1982, 30 years ago it reported \u2014
p88
aVthe Ballah Report \u2014 30 years ago,
p89
aVand immediately the government-to-government arrangements were stopped.
p90
aVThe then-Prime Minister went to Parliament
p91
aVto give a budget speech, and he said some things that I'll never forget.
p92
aVThey went right in here. I was a young man at the time.
p93
aVIt went right into my heart.
p94
aVAnd he said that, in fact \u2014 Let me see if this thing works.
p95
aVAre we getting a, yeah?\u2014
p96
aVThat's what he told us.
p97
aVHe told us that, in fact,
p98
aVtwo out of every three dollars of our petrodollars
p99
aVthat we spent, the taxpayers' money,
p100
aVwas wasted or stolen.
p101
aVSo the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief.
p102
aVAs we say, it's a nancy-story. Forget it.
p103
aVThat's for little children. We are big people,
p104
aVand we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society.
p105
aVOkay? This is the size of the problem.
p106
aVOkay? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted.
p107
aVThat was 30 years ago. 1982 was Ballah.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo what has changed?
p110
aVI don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets
p111
aVto an international audience, but I have to.
p112
aVFour months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country.
p113
aVWe call it the Section 34 fiasco, the Section 34 fiasco,
p114
aVa suspicious piece of law, and I'm going to say it like it is,
p115
aVa suspicious piece of law
p116
aVwas passed at a suspicious time
p117
aVto free some suspects. (Laughter)
p118
aVAnd it was called, those people are called
p119
aVthe Piarco Airport accused.
p120
aVI'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today.
p121
aVThey are the Piarco Airport accused.
p122
aVIt was a constitutional outrage of the first order,
p123
aVand I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament.
p124
aVOur highest institution in our country was perverted.
p125
aVWe are dealing with perverts here
p126
aVof an economic and financial nature.
p127
aVDo you get how serious this problem is?
p128
aVThere was massive protest. A lot of us in this room
p129
aVtook part in the protest in different forms.
p130
aVMost importantly, the American embassy complained,
p131
aVso Parliament was swiftly reconvened,
p132
aVand the law was reversed, it was repealed.
p133
aVThat's the word lawyers use. It was repealed.
p134
aVBut the point is
p135
aVthat Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events,
p136
aVbecause what really happened is that,
p137
aVbecause of the suspicious passage of that law,
p138
aVthe law was actually passed into effect
p139
aVon the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence,
p140
aVour jubilee of independence.
p141
aVSo that is the kind of outrage of the thing.
p142
aVIt was kind of a nasty way to get maturation, but we got it,
p143
aVbecause we all understood it,
p144
aVand for the first time that I could remember,
p145
aVthere were mass protests against this corruption.
p146
aVAnd that gave me a lot of hope. Okay?
p147
aVThose of us who are, sometimes you feel like
p148
aVyou're a little bit on your own doing some of this work.
p149
aVThat passage of the law and the repeal of the law
p150
aVfortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused.
p151
aVSo it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut what were they accused of?
p154
aVWhat was it that they were accused of?
p155
aVI'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of?
p156
aVWe were trying to build, or reconstruct largely,
p157
aVan airport that had grown outdated.
p158
aVThe entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars,
p159
aVTrinidad and Tobago dollars,
p160
aVand in fact, we had a lot of bid-rigging
p161
aVand suspicious activity, corrupt activity took place.
p162
aVAnd to get an idea of what it consisted of,
p163
aVand to put it in context in relationship to this whole
p164
aVsecond myth about it being no big thing,
p165
aVwe can look at this second slide here.
p166
aVAnd what we have here \u2014 I am not saying so,
p167
aVthis is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so.
p168
aVAnd he's telling us that for the $1.6 billion cost of the project,
p169
aVone billion dollars has been traced
p170
aVto offshore bank accounts.
p171
aVOne billion dollars of our taxpayers' money
p172
aVhas been located in offshore bank accounts.
p173
aa(lp174
VBeing the kind of suspicious person I am,
p175
aVI am outraged at that, and I'm going to pause here,
p176
aVI'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things.
p177
aVI'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw
p178
aVin November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park.
p179
aVIt was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark.
p180
aVAnd I was walking around with the protesters
p181
aVlooking at the One Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street movement walking around.
p182
aVAnd there was a lady with a sign, a very simple sign,
p183
aVa kind of battered-looking blonde lady,
p184
aVand the sign was made out of Bristol board, as we say in these parts,
p185
aVand it was made with a marker.
p186
aVAnd what it said on that sign hit me right in the center.
p187
aVIt said, "If you're not outraged, you haven't been paying attention."
p188
aVIf you're not outraged by all of this, you haven't been paying attention.
p189
aVSo listen up, because we're getting into even deeper waters.
p190
aa(lp191
VMy brain started thinking.
p192
aVWell, what if \u2014
p193
aVbecause I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff.
p194
aVWhat if \u2014 (Laughter)
p195
aVBut to make it in these wrongs,
p196
aVyou have to read a lot of spy novels
p197
aVand follow some of that stuff, right? (Laughter)
p198
aVBut what if this wasn't the first time?
p199
aVWhat if this is just the first time
p200
aVthat the so-and-sos had been caught?
p201
aVWhat if it had happened before? How would I find out?
p202
aVNow, the previous two examples I gave
p203
aVwere to do with construction sector corruption, okay?
p204
aVAnd I have the privilege at this time
p205
aVto lead the Joint Consultative Council, which is a not-for-profit.
p206
aVWe're at jcc.org.tt, and we have the \u2014 we are the leaders
p207
aVin the struggle to produce a new public procurement system
p208
aVabout how public money is transacted.
p209
aVSo those of you interested in finding out more about it,
p210
aVor joining us or signing up on any of our petitions, please get involved.
p211
aa(lp212
VBut I'm going to segue to another thing that relates,
p213
aVbecause one of my private campaigns I've been conducting
p214
aVfor over three and a half years
p215
aVis for transparency and accountability
p216
aVaround the bailout of CL Financial.
p217
aVCL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate, okay?
p218
aVAnd without getting into all of the details,
p219
aVit is said to have collapsed \u2014 I'm using my words very carefully \u2014
p220
aVit's said to have collapsed in January of '09,
p221
aVwhich is just coming up to nearly four years.
p222
aVIn an unprecedented fit of generosity \u2014
p223
aVand you have to be very suspicious about these people \u2014
p224
aVin an unprecedented \u2014 and I'm using that word carefully \u2014
p225
aVunprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day
p226
aVsigned, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors.
p227
aVAnd I can tell you without fear of contradiction
p228
aVthat hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet.
p229
aVLet's understand, because we lack context.
p230
aVPeople are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street.
p231
aVTrinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something.
p232
aVIt's not just like anywhere. (Applause)
p233
aVIt's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere.
p234
aVHere is here, and out there is out there. Okay?
p235
aVI'm serious now.
p236
aVListen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street.
p237
aVThey've had bailouts in London.
p238
aVThey've had bailouts in Europe.
p239
aVIn Africa, they've had bailouts. In Nigeria, six of the major
p240
aVcommercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours, eh?
p241
aVIt's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has \u2014
p242
aVhow they've treated it, and they've treated it
p243
aVvery well compared to us.
p244
aVNowhere on the planet
p245
aVhave all the creditors been bailed out
p246
aVin excess of what their statutory entitlements were.
p247
aVOnly here. So what was the reason for the generosity?
p248
aVIs our government that generous? And maybe they are.
p249
aVLet's look at it. Let's look into it.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo I started digging and writing and so and so on,
p252
aVand that work can be found, my personal work
p253
aVcan be found at AfraRaymond.com, which is my name.
p254
aVIt's a not-for-profit blog that I run.
p255
aVNot as popular as some of the other people, but there you go.
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aVBut the point is that the bitter experience of Section 34,
p258
aVthat plot to pervert Parliament, that bitter experience
p259
aVthat took place in August,
p260
aVwhen we were supposed to be celebrating our independence,
p261
aVgoing into September, forced me to check myself
p262
aVand recalculate my bearings,
p263
aVand to go back into some of the work, some of the stuff I'd written
p264
aVand some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials
p265
aVto see what was really what.
p266
aVAs we say in Trinidad and Tobago, who is who and what is what?
p267
aVOkay? We want to try to recalculate.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd I made a Freedom of Information application
p270
aVin May this year to the Ministry of Finance.
p271
aVThe Ministry of Finance is the next tower over.
p272
aVThis is the other context.
p273
aVThe Ministry of Finance, we are told,
p274
aVis subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
p275
aVI'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so.
p276
aVThe Central Bank in which we stand this morning
p277
aVis immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
p278
aVSo in fact, you can't ask them anything,
p279
aVand they don't have to answer anything.
p280
aVThat is the law since 1999.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo I plunged into this struggle, and I asked four questions.
p283
aVAnd I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply,
p284
aVso you could understand, as I said, where we are.
p285
aVHere is not like anywhere else.
p286
aa(lp287
VQuestion number one:
p288
aVI asked to see the accounts of CL Financial,
p289
aVand if you can't show me the accounts \u2014
p290
aVthe Minister of Finance is making statements,
p291
aVpassing new laws and giving speeches and so on.
p292
aVWhat are the figures he's relying on?
p293
aVIt's like that joke: I want whatever he's drinking.
p294
aVAnd they wrote back and said to me,
p295
aVwell what do you really mean?
p296
aVSo they hit my question with a question.
p297
aa(lp298
VSecond point: I want to see
p299
aVwho are the creditors of the group who have been repaid?
p300
aVLet me pause here to point out to you all
p301
aVthat 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this.
p302
aVThat is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars
p303
aVcoming out of a small \u2014 we used to be resource-rich \u2014
p304
aVCaribbean country. Okay?
p305
aVAnd I asked the question,
p306
aVwho was getting that three and a half billion dollars?
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd I want to pause again to bring up context,
p309
aVbecause context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing.
p310
aVThere's a particular individual who is in the government now.
p311
aVThe name of the person doesn't matter.
p312
aVAnd that person made a career
p313
aVout of using the Freedom of Information Act
p314
aVto advance his political cause.
p315
aVOkay? His name isn't important.
p316
aVI wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point.
p317
aVThe point is, that person made a career out of using
p318
aVthe Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause.
p319
aVAnd the most famous case
p320
aVwas what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal,
p321
aVwhere in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money
p322
aVthat had been dispersed in a series of scholarships,
p323
aVand the scholarships hadn't been advertised, and so and so on and so on.
p324
aVAnd he was able to get the court, using that act of Parliament,
p325
aVFreedom of Information Act,
p326
aVto release the information,
p327
aVand I thought that was excellent.
p328
aVFantastic.
p329
aVBut you see, the question is this:
p330
aVIf it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act
p331
aVand to use the court
p332
aVto force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money,
p333
aVit must be right and proper
p334
aVfor us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars.
p335
aVYou see? But the Ministry of Finance,
p336
aVthe Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance,
p337
aVwrote me and said to me, that information is exempt too.
p338
aVYou see? This is what we're dealing with, okay?
p339
aa(lp340
VThe third thing I will tell you
p341
aVis that I also asked
p342
aVfor the directors of CL Financial,
p343
aVwhether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act.
p344
aVWe have an Integrity in Public Life Act
p345
aVas part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest.
p346
aVAnd public officials are supposed to file
p347
aVto say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities.
p348
aVAnd of course I've since discovered that they're not filing,
p349
aVand in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file.
p350
aVSo here we have it. We have a situation where
p351
aVthe basic safeguards of integrity and accountability
p352
aVand transparency have all been discarded.
p353
aVI've asked the question in the legal and required fashion.
p354
aVIt's been ignored.
p355
aa(lp356
VThe sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34,
p357
aVwe need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it.
p358
aVI have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history.
p359
aVIt's also the single largest example
p360
aVof public corruption according to this equation.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd this is my reality check.
p363
aVWhere you have an expenditure of public money
p364
aVand it is without accountability
p365
aVand it's without transparency,
p366
aVit will always be equal to corruption,
p367
aVwhether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska,
p368
aVit will always be equal to corruption, and that is what we are dealing with here.
p369
aa(lp370
VI'm going to continue the work
p371
aVto press on, to get some resolution
p372
aVof those matters at the Ministry of Finance.
p373
aVIf it is I have to go to court personally, I will do that.
p374
aVWe will continue to press on.
p375
aVWe will continue to work within JCC.
p376
aa(lp377
VBut I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context
p378
aVand bring something new to the table
p379
aVin terms of an international example.
p380
aVWe had the journalist [Heather] Brooke speaking
p381
aVabout her battle against government corruption,
p382
aVand she introduced me to this website, Alaveteli.com.
p383
aVAnd Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database
p384
aVfor Freedom of Information applications,
p385
aVand speak with each other.
p386
aVI could see what you're applying for.
p387
aVYou could see what I applied for and what replies I got.
p388
aVWe can work on it together. We need to build a collective database
p389
aVand a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point.
p390
aVWe need to increase the consciousness.
p391
aa(lp392
VThe final thing I want to say is in relation to this one,
p393
aVwhich is a lovely website from India
p394
aVcalled IPaidABribe.com.
p395
aVThey have international branches,
p396
aVand it's important for us to tune into this one.
p397
aVIPaidABribe.com is really important,
p398
aVa good one to log on to and see.
p399
aa(lp400
VI'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage.
p401
aVDiscard the first myth; it is a crime.
p402
aVDiscard the second myth; it is a big thing.
p403
aVIt's a huge problem. It's an economic crime.
p404
aVAnd let us continue working together
p405
aVto betterment in this situation,
p406
aVstability and sustainability in our society. Thank you.

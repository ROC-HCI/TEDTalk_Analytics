VChris Anderson: Welcome to TED.
p5
aa(lp6
VRichard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.
p7
aa(lp8
VCA: Have you met anyone interesting?
p9
aa(lp10
VRB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.
p11
aVI was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,
p12
aVbecause I had an apology to make to her.
p13
aVI'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd \u2014
p14
aVshe had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.
p15
aVAnd I went home to my wife that night
p16
aVand she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,
p17
aVmassive, big wedding ring on my finger.
p18
aVAnd, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler
p19
aVand get it cut off.
p20
aVSo \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p21
aVso apologies to Goldie.
p22
aa(lp23
VCA: That's pretty good.
p24
aVSo, we're going to put up some slides
p25
aVof some of your companies here.
p26
aVYou've started one or two in your time.
p27
aVSo, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records \u2014
p28
aVI guess it all started with a magazine called Student.
p29
aVAnd then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?
p30
aa(lp31
VRB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:
p32
aVyou must not talk about your own business, and this,
p33
aVand now you ask me.
p34
aVSo I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,
p35
aVsince you asked the question.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VCA: It depends what the answer is though.
p39
aa(lp40
VRB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,
p41
aVyou can really run any companies.
p42
aVI mean, companies are all about finding the right people,
p43
aVinspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.
p44
aVAnd I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive
p45
aVand I love taking on, you know, the status quo
p46
aVand trying to turn it upside down.
p47
aVSo I've seen life as one long learning process.
p48
aVAnd if I see \u2014 you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline
p49
aVand find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,
p50
aV21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create
p51
aVthe kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.
p52
aVAnd so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.
p53
aa(lp54
VCA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,
p55
aVbecause you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.
p56
aVAnd in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.
p57
aVI had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,
p58
aVat the time when you basically sold Virgin Records
p59
aVand invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,
p60
aVand his view was that you were trading, you know,
p61
aVthe world's fourth biggest record company
p62
aVfor the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.
p63
aVWhy did you do that?
p64
aa(lp65
VRB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.
p66
aVAnd I think if you start a business without financial backing,
p67
aVyou're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.
p68
aVWe had \u2014 we were being attacked by British Airways.
p69
aVThey were trying to put our airline out of business,
p70
aVand they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.
p71
aVAnd I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down
p72
aVunless I chipped in a chip.
p73
aVAnd in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,
p74
aVand protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,
p75
aVI had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.
p76
aa(lp77
VCA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,
p78
aVfor that as well.
p79
aa(lp80
VRB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.
p81
aVBut, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.
p82
aa(lp83
VCA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lot
p84
aVand it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.
p85
aVWhat does the brand stand for in your head?
p86
aa(lp87
VRB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,
p88
aVthat you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they \u2014
p89
aa(lp90
VCA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?
p91
aa(lp92
VRB: No, but I was going to move on this.
p93
aVWe have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.
p94
aVAs I say, we go in and shake up other industries,
p95
aVand I think, you know, we do it differently
p96
aVand I think that industries are not quite the same
p97
aVas a result of Virgin attacking the market.
p98
aa(lp99
VCA: I mean, there are a few launches you've done
p100
aVwhere the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.
p101
aVI mean, Virgin Brides \u2014 what happened there?
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VRB: We couldn't find any customers.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VCA: I was actually also curious why \u2014
p109
aVI think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.
p110
aVI mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?
p111
aVAin't virgin no longer, or something.
p112
aa(lp113
VRB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.
p114
aVI mean, we had \u2014 often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,
p115
aVyou know, you can deal with them.
p116
aVBut about three months after the launch of the condom company,
p117
aVI had a letter, a complaint,
p118
aVand I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.
p119
aVBut obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.
p120
aVAnd then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,
p121
aVI got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby
p122
aVasking if I'd be godfather, which I became.
p123
aVSo, it all worked out well.
p124
aa(lp125
VCA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.
p126
aa(lp127
VRB: I should have.
p128
aa(lp129
VCA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.
p130
aVI mean, what are the numbers on this?
p131
aVI mean, how big is the group overall?
p132
aVHow much \u2014 what's the total revenue?
p133
aa(lp134
VRB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.
p135
aa(lp136
VCA: And how many employees?
p137
aa(lp138
VRB: About 55,000.
p139
aa(lp140
VCA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various times
p141
aVand never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.
p142
aVWhat was that? Was that real?
p143
aa(lp144
VRB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.
p145
aVNo, I mean, I think \u2014
p146
aVCA: But is that your hair?
p147
aVRB: No.
p148
aVCA: What was that one?
p149
aa(lp150
VRB: Dropping in for tea.
p151
aa(lp152
VCA: OK.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VRB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which \u2014
p156
aa(lp157
VCA: Oh, that car that we \u2014 actually we \u2014
p158
aVit was a TEDster event there, I think.
p159
aVIs that \u2014 could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VRB: It's a tough job, isn't it?
p163
aa(lp164
VCA: I mean, it is a tough job.
p165
aV(Laughter)
p166
aVWhen I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well
p167
aVand they kind of \u2014 they have these different rules over here,
p168
aVit's very strange.
p169
aa(lp170
VRB: I know, I have \u2014 the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but \u2014
p171
aa(lp172
VCA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about \u2014
p173
aa(lp174
VRB: "Pammy" we launched, you know \u2014
p175
aVmistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola,
p176
aVand we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy"
p177
aVand it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.
p178
aVBut the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but \u2014
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VCA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?
p182
aa(lp183
VRB: Of course.
p184
aa(lp185
VCA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.
p186
aVAnd, OK, so stop there. This was \u2014 you had some award I think?
p187
aa(lp188
VRB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols'
p189
aV"God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expected
p190
aVthat 25 years later \u2014 that she'd actually knight us.
p191
aVBut somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.
p192
aa(lp193
VCA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.
p194
aVDo you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?
p195
aa(lp196
VRB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.
p197
aVOccasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richard
p198
aVand think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.
p199
aVBut nowhere else anyway.
p200
aa(lp201
VCA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...
p202
aa(lp203
VRB: No. I suppose if you're having problems
p204
aVgetting a booking in a restaurant or something,
p205
aVthat might be worth using it.
p206
aa(lp207
VCA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.
p208
aa(lp209
VRB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.
p210
aa(lp211
VCA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.
p212
aVI think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,
p213
aVand Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video)
p214
aVSo that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?
p215
aa(lp216
VRB: Yeah, it'll be ready in \u2014 well, ready in 12 months
p217
aVand then we do 12 months extensive testing.
p218
aVAnd then 24 months from now,
p219
aVpeople will be able to take a ride into space.
p220
aa(lp221
VCA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed?
p222
aa(lp223
VRB: Philippe has done the \u2014 yeah, quite a bit of it:
p224
aVthe logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.
p225
aVAnd basically, he's just taken an eye
p226
aVand the space station will be one giant eye,
p227
aVso when you're in space,
p228
aVyou ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.
p229
aVAnd when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.
p230
aVBut he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.
p231
aa(lp232
VCA: But you didn't have him design the engine?
p233
aa(lp234
VRB: Philippe is quite erratic,
p235
aVso I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.
p236
aa(lp237
VCA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.
p238
aa(lp239
VRB: Yeah? No, he is a \u2014
p240
aa(lp241
VCA: Well, some people found it wonderful,
p242
aVsome people found it completely bizarre.
p243
aVBut, I personally found it wonderful.
p244
aa(lp245
VRB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ...
p246
aa(lp247
VCA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.
p248
aVHave you ever regretted that?
p249
aa(lp250
VRB: Many times.
p251
aVI mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.
p252
aVWell, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so \u2014
p253
aVand each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.
p254
aVSo in those moments,
p255
aVyou certainly wonder what you're doing up there or \u2014
p256
aa(lp257
VCA: What was the closest you got to \u2014
p258
aVwhen did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?
p259
aa(lp260
VRB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were \u2014 each one was,
p261
aVeach one, actually, I think we came close.
p262
aVAnd, I mean, first of all we \u2014
p263
aVnobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,
p264
aVso we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,
p265
aVand we weren't quite sure,
p266
aVwhen a balloon actually got into the jet stream,
p267
aVwhether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.
p268
aVAnd so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,
p269
aVas we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon \u2014
p270
aVthe top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,
p271
aVthe capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,
p272
aVand it just took off.
p273
aVAnd it was like holding onto a thousand horses.
p274
aVAnd we were just crossing every finger,
p275
aVpraying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.
p276
aVBut the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know \u2014
p277
aVsomething seemed to go wrong every time,
p278
aVand on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me
p279
aVjumped, and left me holding on for dear life.
p280
aV(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VCA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ...
p283
aa(lp284
VRB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,
p285
aVthe balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...
p286
aa(lp287
VCA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.
p288
aa(lp289
VRB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,
p290
aVwith my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,
p291
aVtrying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which \u2014
p292
aVand it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.
p293
aVBut, anyway, we managed to survive it.
p294
aa(lp295
VCA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?
p296
aa(lp297
VRB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,
p298
aVand I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,
p299
aVI would only have a couple of minutes of life left.
p300
aVSo I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried
p301
aVto make sure that I was making the right decision.
p302
aVAnd wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,
p303
aVlooked down at those clouds again,
p304
aVclimbed back into the capsule again.
p305
aVAnd then finally, just thought, there's a better way.
p306
aVI've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,
p307
aVit's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?
p308
aVAnd so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,
p309
aVand about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.
p310
aVAnd the balloon hit the sea
p311
aVand went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.
p312
aVBut it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and \u2014
p313
aa(lp314
VCA: What did you write to your family?
p315
aa(lp316
VRB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:
p317
aVjust I love you very much. And
p318
aVI'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which \u2014
p319
aVjust in case anything had happened.
p320
aVBut fortunately, they never had to use it.
p321
aa(lp322
VCA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.
p323
aVThe years \u2014 and until I stopped looking at the polls,
p324
aVyou were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.
p325
aVAnd cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy
p326
aVdoing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.
p327
aVHow much was the PR value part of this?
p328
aVRB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,
p329
aVthe last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,
p330
aVand crashing into the seas.
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VCA: They have a point, Richard.
p334
aa(lp335
VRB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,
p336
aVyou know, come on, Richard,
p337
aVthere are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VCA: To do all this,
p341
aVyou must have been a genius from the get-go, right?
p342
aa(lp343
VRB: Well, I won't contradict that.
p344
aV(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VCA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK.
p347
aa(lp348
VDidn't \u2014 weren't you just terrible at school?
p349
aa(lp350
VRB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.
p351
aVI certainly would have failed IQ tests.
p352
aVAnd it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.
p353
aVAnd if I \u2014 if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.
p354
aVAs somebody who's dyslexic,
p355
aVyou also have some quite bizarre situations.
p356
aVI mean, for instance, I've had to \u2014 you know,
p357
aVI've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,
p358
aVbut haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.
p359
aVAnd so the board meetings have been fascinating.
p360
aV(Laughter)
p361
aVAnd so, it's like, good news or bad news?
p362
aVAnd generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.
p363
aa(lp364
VCA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aa(lp367
VRB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having \u2014
p368
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p369
aVI've got it right.
p370
aa(lp371
VCA: No, trust me, it's gross.
p372
aV(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VRB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,
p375
aV"Look Richard, here's a \u2014 let me draw on a diagram.
p376
aVHere's a net in the sea,
p377
aVand the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.
p378
aVAnd that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,
p379
aVeverything else is eaten."
p380
aVAnd I finally worked it all out.
p381
aV(Laughter)
p382
aV(Applause)
p383
aa(lp384
VCA: But, I mean, at school \u2014 so as well as being,
p385
aVyou know, doing pretty miserably academically,
p386
aVbut you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.
p387
aVSo you were kind of a \u2014 you were a natural leader,
p388
aVbut just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...
p389
aa(lp390
VRB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and \u2014 but I ... And I was,
p391
aVyeah, I was fortunately good at sport,
p392
aVand so at least I had something to excel at, at school.
p393
aa(lp394
VCA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.
p395
aVI mean, there's the story about your mother
p396
aVallegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home."
p397
aVDid this really happen?
p398
aa(lp399
VRB: She was, you know,
p400
aVshe felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.
p401
aVSo she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,
p402
aVsuch as pushing us out of the car,
p403
aVand telling us to find our own way to Granny's,
p404
aVabout five miles before we actually got there.
p405
aVAnd making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.
p406
aVAnd we were never allowed to watch television and the like.
p407
aa(lp408
VCA: But is there a risk here?
p409
aVI mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,
p410
aVand we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.
p411
aVDo you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think
p412
aVthey're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,
p413
aVwe're going to raise a generation of privileged ...
p414
aa(lp415
VRB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,
p416
aVyou just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.
p417
aVSo I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.
p418
aa(lp419
VCA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ...
p420
aVYour headmaster said to you \u2014
p421
aVI mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school \u2014
p422
aVhe said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,
p423
aVand I'm not sure which.
p424
aVWhich of those happened first?
p425
aV(Laughter)
p426
aa(lp427
VRB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.
p428
aVI was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.
p429
aVI was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act
p430
aVand the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.
p431
aVOn the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which \u2014
p432
aVwe had a center where we would help young people who had problems.
p433
aVAnd one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.
p434
aVAnd there's an ancient law that says
p435
aVyou can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.
p436
aVSo the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest us
p437
aVif we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.
p438
aVWe changed it to social diseases
p439
aVand people came along with acne and spots,
p440
aVbut nobody came with VD any more.
p441
aVSo, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.
p442
aVAnd then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"
p443
aVthe word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested
p444
aVfor using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.
p445
aVAnd John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.
p446
aVAnd he asked if I could find a linguistics expert
p447
aVto come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.
p448
aVAnd so I rang up Nottingham University,
p449
aVand I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.
p450
aVAnd he said, "Look, bollocks is not a \u2014 has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.
p451
aVIt's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century."
p452
aV(Laughter)
p453
aVAnd he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself."
p454
aVAnd so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?"
p455
aVAnd he said he'd be delighted. And I said \u2014
p456
aVand he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"
p457
aVAnd I said, "Yes, definitely. Please."
p458
aV(Laughter)
p459
aa(lp460
VCA: That's great.
p461
aa(lp462
VRB: So our key witness argued that it was actually
p463
aV"Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols."
p464
aV(Laughter)
p465
aVAnd the judge found us \u2014 reluctantly found us not guilty, so ...
p466
aV(Laughter)
p467
aa(lp468
VCA: That is outrageous.
p469
aV(Applause)
p470
aVSo seriously, is there a dark side?
p471
aVA lot of people would say there's no way
p472
aVthat someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses
p473
aVwithout knifing a few people in the back,
p474
aVyou know, doing some ugly things.
p475
aVYou've been accused of being ruthless.
p476
aVThere was a nasty biography written about you by someone.
p477
aVIs any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?
p478
aa(lp479
VRB: I don't actually think that the stereotype
p480
aVof a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,
p481
aVgenerally speaking, works.
p482
aVI think if you treat people well,
p483
aVpeople will come back and come back for more.
p484
aVAnd I think all you have in life is your reputation
p485
aVand it's a very small world.
p486
aVAnd I actually think that the best way
p487
aVof becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,
p488
aVand I like to think that's how we run Virgin.
p489
aa(lp490
VCA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending \u2014
p491
aVyou keep getting caught up in these new projects,
p492
aVbut it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.
p493
aVYou get excited by an idea and, kapow!
p494
aVI mean, do you think about life balance?
p495
aVHow do your family feel about
p496
aVeach time you step into something big and new?
p497
aa(lp498
VRB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,
p499
aVso from the time the kids were very young,
p500
aVyou know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.
p501
aVAnd so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.
p502
aVYes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,
p503
aVwe have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can \u2014
p504
aVso I can take them there and we can bring friends,
p505
aVand we can play together,
p506
aVbut I can also keep in touch with what's going on.
p507
aa(lp508
VCA: You started talking in recent years
p509
aVabout this term capitalist philanthropy.
p510
aVWhat is that?
p511
aa(lp512
VRB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.
p513
aVYou know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.
p514
aVBut the problem with capitalism is
p515
aVextreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,
p516
aVand therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.
p517
aVAnd I think it's important that the individuals,
p518
aVwho are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing
p519
aVfor bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,
p520
aVbut, you know, use that money to either create new jobs
p521
aVor to tackle issues around the world.
p522
aa(lp523
VCA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,
p524
aVwant to turn your resources toward?
p525
aa(lp526
VRB: Well, there's \u2014 I mean there's a lot of issues.
p527
aVI mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind
p528
aVand we are putting a lot of time and energy into,
p529
aVA, trying to come up with alternative fuels
p530
aVand, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize
p531
aVin case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,
p532
aVin case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions
p533
aVcut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.
p534
aVWe need to try to encourage people to come up with a way
p535
aVof extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.
p536
aVAnd we just \u2014 you know, there weren't really people
p537
aVworking on that before, so we wanted people to try to \u2014
p538
aVall the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,
p539
aVand also to try to extract the methane
p540
aVout of the Earth's atmosphere as well.
p541
aVAnd actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the forms
p542
aVsaying they want to give it a go.
p543
aVAnd so we only need one, so we're hopeful.
p544
aa(lp545
VCA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?
p546
aa(lp547
VRB: Yes, I mean, we've got \u2014 we're setting up something called
p548
aVthe war room, which is maybe the wrong word.
p549
aVWe're trying to \u2014 maybe we'll change it \u2014 but anyway, it's a war room
p550
aVto try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,
p551
aVall the different social problems in Africa,
p552
aVand try to look at best practices.
p553
aVSo, for instance,
p554
aVthere's a doctor in Africa that's found that
p555
aVif you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,
p556
aVthat the baby will not have HIV when it's born.
p557
aVAnd so disseminating that information to
p558
aVaround the rest of Africa is important.
p559
aa(lp560
VCA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.
p561
aVAnd is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West
p562
aVget so excited about \u2014 I mean, they're used to having an idea,
p563
aVgetting stuff done, and they believe profoundly
p564
aVin their ability to make a difference in the world.
p565
aVIs there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,
p566
aVwe've got to fix this problem and we can do it,
p567
aVI've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da \u2014
p568
aVhere's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation
p569
aVand actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?
p570
aa(lp571
VRB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually \u2014
p572
aVwe're working with the government on it.
p573
aVI mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting
p574
aVHIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,
p575
aVof him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,
p576
aVit's a way of working with him, with his government.
p577
aVIt's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,
p578
aVthey don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.
p579
aVIt's got to be consistent.
p580
aVBut I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how
p581
aVand help governments approach things slightly differently.
p582
aVFor instance, we're setting up clinics in Africa
p583
aVwhere we're going to be giving
p584
aVfree antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatment
p585
aVand free malaria treatment.
p586
aVBut we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,
p587
aVso that people pay for some other aspects.
p588
aa(lp589
VCA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,
p590
aVor whatever, that this is really being \u2014 it's almost driven by
p591
aVsome sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,
p592
aVfor guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.
p593
aVWhat would you say to them?
p594
aa(lp595
VRB: Well, I think that everybody \u2014
p596
aVpeople do things for a whole variety of different reasons
p597
aVand I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,
p598
aVI will want to feel that I've made a difference
p599
aVto other people's lives.
p600
aVAnd that may be a selfish thing to think,
p601
aVbut it's the way I've been brought up.
p602
aVI think if I'm in a position to
p603
aVradically change other people's lives for the better,
p604
aVI should do so.
p605
aa(lp606
VCA: How old are you?
p607
aa(lp608
VRB: I'm 56.
p609
aa(lp610
VCA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that \u2014 as I understand him
p611
aVand I'm a total amateur \u2014 but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by
p612
aVthis desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.
p613
aV50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom
p614
aVand a search for legacy.
p615
aVI mean, it seems like you're still
p616
aVa little bit in the growth phases,
p617
aVyou're still doing these incredible new plans.
p618
aVHow much do you think about legacy,
p619
aVand what would you like your legacy to be?
p620
aa(lp621
VRB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.
p622
aVI mean, I like to \u2014 you know, my grandmother lived to 101,
p623
aVso hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.
p624
aVNo, I just want to live life to its full.
p625
aVYou know, if I can make a difference,
p626
aVI hope to be able to make a difference.
p627
aVAnd I think one of the positive things at the moment is
p628
aVyou've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,
p629
aVwho are good friends.
p630
aVAnd, thank God, you've got two people
p631
aVwho genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.
p632
aVIf they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,
p633
aVit would be very worrying.
p634
aVAnd you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.
p635
aVAnd I think it's important
p636
aVthat people in that kind of position do make a difference.
p637
aa(lp638
VCA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,
p639
aVI knew nothing about it and I also was sort of \u2014
p640
aVI thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless
p641
aVand that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.
p642
aVAnd you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,
p643
aVwell, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.
p644
aVSo I would like to thank you for that inspiration,
p645
aVand for coming to TED today. Thank you.
p646
aVThank you so much.
p647
aV(Applause)

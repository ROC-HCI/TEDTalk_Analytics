(lp4
VI was born and raised in North Korea.
p5
aVAlthough my family constantly struggled against poverty,
p6
aVI was always loved and cared for first,
p7
aVbecause I was the only son
p8
aVand the youngest of two in the family.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut then the great famine began in 1994.
p11
aVI was four years old.
p12
aVMy sister and I would go searching for firewood
p13
aVstarting at 5 in the morning
p14
aVand come back after midnight.
p15
aVI would wander the streets searching for food,
p16
aVand I remember seeing a small child
p17
aVtied to a mother's back eating chips,
p18
aVand wanting to steal them from him.
p19
aa(lp20
VHunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness.
p21
aVFor a hungry child, politics and freedom
p22
aVare not even thought of.
p23
aVOn my ninth birthday, my parents
p24
aVcouldn't give me any food to eat.
p25
aVBut even as a child, I could feel the heaviness
p26
aVin their hearts.
p27
aa(lp28
VOver a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time,
p29
aVand in 2003, when I was 13 years old,
p30
aVmy father became one of them.
p31
aVI saw my father wither away and die.
p32
aVIn the same year, my mother disappeared one day,
p33
aVand then my sister told me
p34
aVthat she was going to China to earn money,
p35
aVbut that she would return with money and food soon.
p36
aVSince we had never been separated,
p37
aVand I thought we would be together forever,
p38
aVI didn't even give her a hug when she left.
p39
aVIt was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life.
p40
aVBut again, I didn't know
p41
aVit was going to be a long goodbye.
p42
aVI have not seen my mom or my sister since then.
p43
aa(lp44
VSuddenly, I became an orphan and homeless.
p45
aVMy daily life became very hard,
p46
aVbut very simple.
p47
aVMy goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash.
p48
aVBut that is no way to survive.
p49
aVI started to realize, begging would not be the solution.
p50
aVSo I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets.
p51
aVSometimes, I found small jobs
p52
aVin exchange for food.
p53
aVOnce, I even spent two months in the winter
p54
aVworking in a coal mine,
p55
aV33 meters underground without any protection
p56
aVfor up to 16 hours a day.
p57
aVI was not uncommon.
p58
aVMany other orphans survived this way, or worse.
p59
aa(lp60
VWhen I could not fall asleep from bitter cold
p61
aVor hunger pains,
p62
aVI hoped that, the next morning,
p63
aVmy sister would come back to wake me up
p64
aVwith my favorite food.
p65
aVThat hope kept me alive.
p66
aVI don't mean big, grand hope.
p67
aVI mean the kind of hope that made me believe
p68
aVthat the next trash can had bread,
p69
aVeven though it usually didn't.
p70
aVBut if I didn't believe it, I wouldn't even try,
p71
aVand then I would die.
p72
aVHope kept me alive.
p73
aVEvery day, I told myself,
p74
aVno matter how hard things got,
p75
aVstill I must live.
p76
aa(lp77
VAfter three years of waiting for my sister's return,
p78
aVI decided to go to China to look for her myself.
p79
aVI realized
p80
aVI couldn't survive much longer this way.
p81
aVI knew the journey would be risky,
p82
aVbut I would be risking my life either way.
p83
aVI could die of starvation like my father in North Korea,
p84
aVor at least I could try for a better life
p85
aVby escaping to China.
p86
aa(lp87
VI had learned that many people tried to cross
p88
aVthe border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen.
p89
aVNorth Korean border guards often shoot and kill people
p90
aVtrying to cross the border without permission.
p91
aVChinese soldiers will catch
p92
aVand send back North Koreans,
p93
aVwhere they face severe punishment.
p94
aVI decided to cross during the day,
p95
aVfirst because I was still a kid and scared of the dark,
p96
aVsecond because I knew I was already taking a risk,
p97
aVand since not many people tried to cross during the day,
p98
aVI thought I might be able to cross
p99
aVwithout being seen by anyone.
p100
aa(lp101
VI made it to China on February 15, 2006.
p102
aVI was 16 years old.
p103
aVI thought things in China would be easier,
p104
aVsince there was more food.
p105
aVI thought more people would help me.
p106
aVBut it was harder than living in North Korea,
p107
aVbecause I was not free.
p108
aVI was always worried about being caught
p109
aVand sent back.
p110
aa(lp111
VBy a miracle, some months later,
p112
aVI met someone who was running
p113
aVan underground shelter for North Koreans,
p114
aVand was allowed to live there
p115
aVand eat regular meals for the first time in many years.
p116
aVLater that year, an activist helped me escape China
p117
aVand go to the United States as a refugee.
p118
aa(lp119
VI went to America without knowing a word of English,
p120
aVyet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school.
p121
aVEven in North Korea, I was an F student.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVAnd I barely finished elementary school.
p124
aVAnd I remember I fought in school more than once a day.
p125
aVTextbooks and the library were not my playground.
p126
aVMy father tried very hard to motivate me into studying,
p127
aVbut it didn't work.
p128
aVAt one point, my father gave up on me.
p129
aVHe said, "You're not my son anymore."
p130
aVI was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply.
p131
aVBut nevertheless, my level of motivation
p132
aVstill didn't change before he died.
p133
aVSo in America, it was kind of ridiculous
p134
aVthat they said I should go to high school.
p135
aVI didn't even go to middle school.
p136
aVI decided to go, just because they told me to,
p137
aVwithout trying much.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut one day, I came home and my foster mother
p140
aVhad made chicken wings for dinner.
p141
aVAnd during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing,
p142
aVbut I realized there were not enough for everyone,
p143
aVso I decided against it.
p144
aVWhen I looked down at my plate,
p145
aVI saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his.
p146
aVI was so happy.
p147
aVI looked at him sitting next to me.
p148
aVHe just looked back at me very warmly,
p149
aVbut said no words.
p150
aVSuddenly I remembered my biological father.
p151
aVMy foster father's small act of love
p152
aVreminded me of my father,
p153
aVwho would love to share his food with me
p154
aVwhen he was hungry, even if he was starving.
p155
aVI felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America,
p156
aVyet my father died of starvation.
p157
aVMy only wish that night was to cook a meal for him,
p158
aVand that night I also thought of what else I could do
p159
aVto honor him.
p160
aVAnd my answer was to promise to myself
p161
aVthat I would study hard and get the best education
p162
aVin America to honor his sacrifice.
p163
aa(lp164
VI took school seriously,
p165
aVand for the first time ever in my life,
p166
aVI received an academic award for excellence,
p167
aVand made dean's list from the first semester in high school.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Applause)
p170
aa(lp171
VThat chicken wing changed my life.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VHope is personal. Hope is something
p175
aVthat no one can give to you.
p176
aVYou have to choose to believe in hope.
p177
aVYou have to make it yourself.
p178
aVIn North Korea, I made it myself.
p179
aVHope brought me to America.
p180
aVBut in America, I didn't know what to do,
p181
aVbecause I had this overwhelming freedom.
p182
aVMy foster father at that dinner gave me a direction,
p183
aVand he motivated me and gave me a purpose
p184
aVto live in America.
p185
aa(lp186
VI did not come here by myself.
p187
aVI had hope, but hope by itself is not enough.
p188
aVMany people helped me along the way to get here.
p189
aVNorth Koreans are fighting hard to survive.
p190
aVThey have to force themselves to survive,
p191
aVhave hope to survive,
p192
aVbut they cannot make it without help.
p193
aa(lp194
VThis is my message to you.
p195
aVHave hope for yourself,
p196
aVbut also help each other.
p197
aVLife can be hard for everyone, wherever you live.
p198
aVMy foster father didn't intend to change my life.
p199
aVIn the same way, you may also change someone's life
p200
aVwith even the smallest act of love.
p201
aVA piece of bread can satisfy your hunger,
p202
aVand having the hope will bring you bread
p203
aVto keep you alive.
p204
aVBut I confidently believe that
p205
aVyour act of love and caring
p206
aVcan also save another Joseph's life
p207
aVand change thousands of other Josephs
p208
aVwho are still having hope to survive.
p209
aa(lp210
VThank you.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Applause)
p213
aa(lp214
VAdrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing
p215
aVthat very personal and special story with us.
p216
aVI know you haven't seen your sister for, you said,
p217
aVit was almost exactly a decade,
p218
aVand in the off chance that she may be able to see this,
p219
aVwe wanted to give you an opportunity
p220
aVto send her a message.
p221
aa(lp222
VJoseph Kim: In Korean?
p223
aa(lp224
VAH: You can do English, then Korean as well.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VJK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean
p229
aVbecause I don't think I can make it
p230
aVwithout tearing up.
p231
aa(lp232
VNuna, it has been already 10 years
p233
aVthat I haven\u2019t seen you.
p234
aVI just wanted to say
p235
aVthat I miss you, and I love you,
p236
aVand please come back to me and stay alive.
p237
aVAnd I \u2014 oh, gosh.
p238
aVI still haven't given up my hope to see you.
p239
aVI will live my life happily
p240
aVand study hard
p241
aVuntil I see you,
p242
aVand I promise I will not cry again.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVYes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you,
p245
aVand if you can't find me,
p246
aVI will also look for you,
p247
aVand I hope to see you one day.
p248
aVAnd can I also make a small message to my mom?
p249
aa(lp250
VAH: Sure, please.
p251
aa(lp252
VJK: I haven't spent much time with you,
p253
aVbut I know that you still love me,
p254
aVand you probably still pray for me
p255
aVand think about me.
p256
aVI just wanted to say thank you
p257
aVfor letting me be in this world.
p258
aVThank you.

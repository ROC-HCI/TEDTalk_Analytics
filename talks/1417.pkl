VI was born in Den Bosch,
p5
aVwhere the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after.
p6
aVAnd I've always been very fond of this painter
p7
aVwho lived and worked in the 15th century.
p8
aVAnd what is interesting about him in relation to morality
p9
aVis that he lived at a time where religion's influence was waning,
p10
aVand he was sort of wondering, I think,
p11
aVwhat would happen with society if there was no religion
p12
aVor if there was less religion.
p13
aVAnd so he painted this famous painting, "The Garden of Earthly Delights,"
p14
aVwhich some have interpreted as being humanity before the Fall,
p15
aVor being humanity without any Fall at all.
p16
aVAnd so it makes you wonder,
p17
aVwhat would happen if we hadn't tasted the fruit of knowledge, so to speak,
p18
aVand what kind of morality would we have.
p19
aa(lp20
VMuch later, as a student, I went to a very different garden,
p21
aVa zoological garden in Arnhem where we keep chimpanzees.
p22
aVThis is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd I discovered there
p27
aVthat the chimpanzees are very power-hungry and wrote a book about it.
p28
aVAnd at that time the focus in a lot of animal research
p29
aVwas on aggression and competition.
p30
aVI painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom
p31
aVand humanity included, was that deep down we are competitors, we are aggressive,
p32
aVwe are all out for our own profit, basically.
p33
aVThis is the launch of my book.
p34
aVI'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it,
p35
aVbut they surely seemed interested in the book.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VNow in the process of doing all this work
p40
aVon power and dominance and aggression and so on,
p41
aVI discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights.
p42
aVAnd so what you see here is two males who have had a fight.
p43
aVThey ended up in a tree, and one of them holds out a hand to the other.
p44
aVAnd about a second after I took the picture,
p45
aVthey came together in the fork of the tree
p46
aVand kissed and embraced each other.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd this is very interesting
p49
aVbecause at the time, everything was about competition and aggression,
p50
aVso it wouldn't make any sense.
p51
aVThe only thing that matters is that you win or you lose.
p52
aVBut why reconcile after a fight? That doesn't make any sense.
p53
aVThis is the way bonobos do it. Bonobos do everything with sex.
p54
aVAnd so they also reconcile with sex.
p55
aVBut the principle is exactly the same.
p56
aVThe principle is that you have a valuable relationship
p57
aVthat is damaged by conflict, so you need to do something about it.
p58
aVSo my whole picture of the animal kingdom, and including humans also,
p59
aVstarted to change at that time.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo we have this image in political science, economics, the humanities,
p62
aVthe philosophy for that matter, that man is a wolf to man.
p63
aVAnd so deep down, our nature is actually nasty.
p64
aVI think it's a very unfair image for the wolf.
p65
aVThe wolf is, after all, a very cooperative animal.
p66
aVAnd that's why many of you have a dog at home,
p67
aVwhich has all these characteristics also.
p68
aVAnd it's really unfair to humanity,
p69
aVbecause humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic
p70
aVthan given credit for.
p71
aVSo I started getting interested in those issues
p72
aVand studying that in other animals.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo these are the pillars of morality.
p75
aVIf you ask anyone, "What is morality based on?"
p76
aVthese are the two factors that always come out.
p77
aVOne is reciprocity,
p78
aVand associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness.
p79
aVAnd the other one is empathy and compassion.
p80
aVAnd human morality is more than this, but if you would remove these two pillars,
p81
aVthere would be not much remaining, I think.
p82
aVSo they're absolutely essential.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo let me give you a few examples here.
p85
aVThis is a very old video from the Yerkes Primate Center,
p86
aVwhere they trained chimpanzees to cooperate.
p87
aVSo this is already about a hundred years ago
p88
aVthat we were doing experiments on cooperation.
p89
aVWhat you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box,
p90
aVand the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in.
p91
aVAnd of course, there's food on the box.
p92
aVOtherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard.
p93
aVAnd so they're bringing in the box.
p94
aVAnd you can see that they're synchronized.
p95
aVYou can see that they work together, they pull at the same moment.
p96
aVIt's already a big advance over many other animals
p97
aVwho wouldn't be able to do that.
p98
aVNow you're going to get a more interesting picture,
p99
aVbecause now one of the two chimps has been fed.
p100
aVSo one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
V[- and sometimes appears to convey its wishes and meanings by gestures.]
p109
aVNow look at what happens at the very end of this.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VHe takes basically everything.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VThere are two interesting parts about this.
p118
aVOne is that the chimp on the right
p119
aVhas a full understanding he needs the partner \u2014
p120
aVso a full understanding of the need for cooperation.
p121
aVThe second one is that the partner is willing to work
p122
aVeven though he's not interested in the food.
p123
aVWhy would that be?
p124
aVWell, that probably has to do with reciprocity.
p125
aVThere's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals
p126
aVthat they return favors.
p127
aVHe will get a return favor at some point in the future.
p128
aVAnd so that's how this all operates.
p129
aa(lp130
VWe do the same task with elephants.
p131
aVNow, it's very dangerous to work with elephants.
p132
aVAnother problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus
p133
aVthat is too heavy for a single elephant.
p134
aVNow you can probably make it,
p135
aVbut it's going to be a pretty clumsy apparatus, I think.
p136
aVAnd so what we did in that case \u2014
p137
aVwe do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik \u2014
p138
aVis we have an apparatus around which there is a rope, a single rope.
p139
aVAnd if you pull on this side of the rope, the rope disappears on the other side.
p140
aVSo two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time, and pull.
p141
aVOtherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears.
p142
aa(lp143
VThe first tape you're going to see
p144
aVis two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus.
p145
aVThe apparatus is on the left, with food on it.
p146
aVAnd so they come together, they arrive together,
p147
aVthey pick it up together, and they pull together.
p148
aVSo it's actually fairly simple for them.
p149
aVThere they are.
p150
aVSo that's how they bring it in.
p151
aVBut now we're going to make it more difficult.
p152
aVBecause the purpose of this experiment
p153
aVis to see how well they understand cooperation.
p154
aVDo they understand that as well as the chimps, for example?
p155
aa(lp156
VWhat we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other
p157
aVand that elephant needs to be smart enough
p158
aVto stay there and wait and not pull at the rope \u2014
p159
aVbecause if he pulls at the rope, it disappears and the whole test is over.
p160
aVNow this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it.
p161
aVBut it shows the understanding he has,
p162
aVbecause he puts his big foot on the rope,
p163
aVstands on the rope and waits there for the other,
p164
aVand then the other is going to do all the work for him.
p165
aVSo it's what we call freeloading.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VBut it shows the intelligence that the elephants have.
p170
aVThey developed several of these alternative techniques
p171
aVthat we did not approve of, necessarily.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VSo the other elephant is now coming ...
p176
aVand is going to pull it in.
p177
aVNow look at the other; it doesn't forget to eat, of course.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VThis was the cooperation and reciprocity part.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow something on empathy.
p184
aVEmpathy is my main topic at the moment, of research.
p185
aVAnd empathy has two qualities:
p186
aVOne is the understanding part of it.
p187
aVThis is just a regular definition:
p188
aVthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
p189
aVAnd the emotional part.
p190
aVEmpathy has basically two channels: One is the body channel,
p191
aVIf you talk with a sad person,
p192
aVyou're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture,
p193
aVand before you know it, you feel sad.
p194
aVAnd that's sort of the body channel of emotional empathy,
p195
aVwhich many animals have.
p196
aVYour average dog has that also.
p197
aVThat's why people keep mammals in the home
p198
aVand not turtles or snakes or something like that,
p199
aVwho don't have that kind of empathy.
p200
aVAnd then there's a cognitive channel,
p201
aVwhich is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else.
p202
aVAnd that's more limited.
p203
aVVery few animals, I think elephants and apes, can do that kind of thing.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo synchronization,
p206
aVwhich is part of that whole empathy mechanism,
p207
aVis a very old one in the animal kingdom.
p208
aVIn humans, of course, we can study that with yawn contagion.
p209
aVHumans yawn when others yawn.
p210
aVAnd it's related to empathy.
p211
aVIt activates the same areas in the brain.
p212
aVAlso, we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion
p213
aVare highly empathic.
p214
aVPeople who have problems with empathy, such as autistic children,
p215
aVthey don't have yawn contagion.
p216
aVSo it is connected.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head.
p219
aVSo that's what you see on the upper-left, an animated head that yawns.
p220
aVAnd there's a chimpanzee watching,
p221
aVan actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen
p222
aVon which we play these animations.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VSo yawn contagion that you're probably all familiar with \u2014
p227
aVand maybe you're going to start yawning soon now \u2014
p228
aVis something that we share with other animals.
p229
aVAnd that's related to that whole body channel of synchronization
p230
aVthat underlies empathy,
p231
aVand that is universal in the mammals, basically.
p232
aa(lp233
VWe also study more complex expressions \u2014 This is consolation.
p234
aVThis is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he's screaming,
p235
aVand a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him
p236
aVand calms him down.
p237
aVThat's consolation.
p238
aVIt's very similar to human consolation.
p239
aVAnd consolation behavior \u2014
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
Vit's empathy driven.
p244
aVActually, the way to study empathy in human children
p245
aVis to instruct a family member to act distressed,
p246
aVand then to see what young children do.
p247
aVAnd so it is related to empathy,
p248
aVand that's the kind of expressions we look at.
p249
aa(lp250
VWe also recently published an experiment you may have heard about.
p251
aVIt's on altruism and chimpanzees,
p252
aVwhere the question is: Do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else?
p253
aVAnd for decades it had been assumed that only humans can do that,
p254
aVthat only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else.
p255
aVNow we did a very simple experiment.
p256
aVWe do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville,
p257
aVin the field station of Yerkes.
p258
aVAnd so that's how they live.
p259
aVAnd we call them into a room and do experiments with them.
p260
aVIn this case, we put two chimpanzees side-by-side,
p261
aVand one has a bucket full of tokens, and the tokens have different meanings.
p262
aVOne kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses,
p263
aVthe other one feeds both of them.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo this is a study we did with Vicki Horner.
p266
aVAnd here, you have the two color tokens.
p267
aVSo they have a whole bucket full of them.
p268
aVAnd they have to pick one of the two colors.
p269
aVYou will see how that goes.
p270
aVSo if this chimp makes the selfish choice,
p271
aVwhich is the red token in this case,
p272
aVhe needs to give it to us,
p273
aVwe pick it up, we put it on a table where there's two food rewards,
p274
aVbut in this case, only the one on the right gets food.
p275
aVThe one on the left walks away because she knows already
p276
aVthat this is not a good test for her.
p277
aVThen the next one is the pro-social token.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo the one who makes the choices \u2014 that's the interesting part here \u2014
p280
aVfor the one who makes the choices, it doesn't really matter.
p281
aVSo she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed.
p282
aVSo the one who makes the choices always gets a reward.
p283
aVSo it doesn't matter whatsoever.
p284
aVAnd she should actually be choosing blindly.
p285
aVBut what we find is that they prefer the pro-social token.
p286
aVSo this is the 50 percent line, that's the random expectation.
p287
aVAnd especially if the partner draws attention to itself, they choose more.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd if the partner puts pressure on them \u2014
p290
aVso if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them \u2014
p291
aVthen the choices go down.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VIt's as if they're saying,
p296
aV"If you're not behaving, I'm not going to be pro-social today."
p297
aVAnd this is what happens without a partner,
p298
aVwhen there's no partner sitting there.
p299
aVSo we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well-being of somebody else \u2014
p300
aVespecially, these are other members of their own group.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo the final experiment that I want to mention to you
p303
aVis our fairness study.
p304
aVAnd so this became a very famous study.
p305
aVAnd there are now many more,
p306
aVbecause after we did this about 10 years ago,
p307
aVit became very well-known.
p308
aVAnd we did that originally with Capuchin monkeys.
p309
aVAnd I'm going to show you the first experiment that we did.
p310
aVIt has now been done with dogs and with birds
p311
aVand with chimpanzees.
p312
aVBut with Sarah Brosnan, we started out with Capuchin monkeys.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo what we did is we put two Capuchin monkeys side-by-side.
p315
aVAgain, these animals, live in a group, they know each other.
p316
aVWe take them out of the group, put them in a test chamber.
p317
aVAnd there's a very simple task that they need to do.
p318
aVAnd if you give both of them cucumber for the task,
p319
aVthe two monkeys side-by-side,
p320
aVthey're perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row.
p321
aVSo cucumber, even though it's only really water in my opinion,
p322
aVbut cucumber is perfectly fine for them.
p323
aVNow if you give the partner grapes \u2014
p324
aVthe food preferences of my Capuchin monkeys
p325
aVcorrespond exactly with the prices in the supermarket \u2014
p326
aVand so if you give them grapes \u2014 it's a far better food \u2014
p327
aVthen you create inequity between them.
p328
aVSo that's the experiment we did.
p329
aa(lp330
VRecently, we videotaped it with new monkeys
p331
aVwho'd never done the task,
p332
aVthinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction,
p333
aVand that turned out to be right.
p334
aVThe one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber.
p335
aVThe one on the right is the one who gets grapes.
p336
aVThe one who gets cucumber \u2014
p337
aVnote that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine.
p338
aVThe first piece she eats.
p339
aVThen she sees the other one getting grape, and you will see what happens.
p340
aVSo she gives a rock to us. That's the task.
p341
aVAnd we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it.
p342
aVThe other one needs to give a rock to us.
p343
aVAnd that's what she does.
p344
aVAnd she gets a grape ...
p345
aVand eats it.
p346
aVThe other one sees that.
p347
aVShe gives a rock to us now,
p348
aVgets, again, cucumber.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter ends)
p353
aa(lp354
VShe tests a rock now against the wall.
p355
aVShe needs to give it to us.
p356
aVAnd she gets cucumber again.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Laughter)
p359
aa(lp360
VSo this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
V(Applause)
p365
aa(lp366
VI still have two minutes left \u2014
p367
aVlet me tell you a funny story about this.
p368
aVThis study became very famous and we got a lot of comments,
p369
aVespecially anthropologists, economists, philosophers.
p370
aVThey didn't like this at all.
p371
aVBecause they had decided in their minds, I believe,
p372
aVthat fairness is a very complex issue, and that animals cannot have it.
p373
aVAnd so one philosopher even wrote us
p374
aVthat it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness
p375
aVbecause fairness was invented during the French Revolution.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VAnd another one wrote a whole chapter
p380
aVsaying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness,
p381
aVif the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes.
p382
aVNow the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan, who's been doing this with chimpanzees,
p383
aVhad a couple of combinations of chimpanzees
p384
aVwhere, indeed, the one who would get the grape
p385
aVwould refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape.
p386
aVSo we're getting very close to the human sense of fairness.
p387
aVAnd I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for a while.
p388
aa(lp389
VSo let me summarize.
p390
aVI believe there's an evolved morality.
p391
aVI think morality is much more than what I've been talking about,
p392
aVbut it would be impossible without these ingredients
p393
aVthat we find in other primates,
p394
aVwhich are empathy and consolation,
p395
aVpro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness.
p396
aVAnd so we work on these particular issues
p397
aVto see if we can create a morality from the bottom up, so to speak,
p398
aVwithout necessarily god and religion involved,
p399
aVand to see how we can get to an evolved morality.
p400
aa(lp401
VAnd I thank you for your attention.

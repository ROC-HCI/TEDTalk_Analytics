VThis is poo,
p5
aVand what I want to do today is share my passion
p6
aVfor poo with you,
p7
aVwhich might be quite difficult,
p8
aVbut I think what you might find more fascinating
p9
aVis the way these small animals deal with poo.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo this animal here has got a brain
p12
aVabout the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things
p13
aVthat you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.
p14
aVAnd basically it's all evolved to handle its food source,
p15
aVwhich is dung.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo the question is, where do we start this story?
p18
aVAnd it seems appropriate to start at the end,
p19
aVbecause this is a waste product that comes out
p20
aVof other animals, but it still contains nutrients
p21
aVand there are sufficient nutrients in there
p22
aVfor dung beetles basically to make a living,
p23
aVand so dung beetles eat dung, and their larvae
p24
aVare also dung-feeders.
p25
aVThey are grown completely in a ball of dung.
p26
aVWithin South Africa, we've got about 800 species of dung beetles,
p27
aVin Africa we've got 2,000 species of dung beetles,
p28
aVand in the world we have about 6,000 species of dung beetles.
p29
aVSo, according to dung beetles, dung is pretty good.
p30
aa(lp31
VUnless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails
p32
aVand root through the dung itself, you'll never see
p33
aV90 percent of the dung beetle species,
p34
aVbecause they go directly into the dung,
p35
aVstraight down below it, and then they shuttle back and forth
p36
aVbetween the dung at the soil surface
p37
aVand a nest they make underground.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo the question is, how do they deal with this material?
p40
aVAnd most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.
p41
aVTen percent of the species actually make a ball,
p42
aVand this ball they roll away from the dung source,
p43
aVusually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source,
p44
aVand they have a very particular behavior
p45
aVby which they are able to roll their balls.
p46
aVSo this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball.
p47
aVYou can see it's a male
p48
aVbecause he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there,
p49
aVand he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there.
p50
aVAnd then he's about to become a victim
p51
aVof a vicious smash-and-grab. (Laughter)
p52
aVAnd this is a clear indication
p53
aVthat this is a valuable resource.
p54
aVAnd so valuable resources have to be looked after
p55
aVand guarded in a particular way, and we think
p56
aVthe reason they roll the balls away is because of this,
p57
aVbecause of the competition that is involved
p58
aVin getting hold of that dung.
p59
aVSo this dung pat was actually \u2014 well, it was a dung pat
p60
aV15 minutes before this photograph was taken,
p61
aVand we think it's the intense competition
p62
aVthat makes the beetles so well-adapted
p63
aVto rolling balls of dung.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo what you've got to imagine here is this animal here
p66
aVmoving across the African veld.
p67
aVIts head is down. It's walking backwards.
p68
aVIt's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction,
p69
aVand at the same time it's got to deal with the heat.
p70
aVThis is Africa. It's hot.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo what I want to share with you now
p73
aVare some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues
p74
aVhave used to investigate how dung beetles
p75
aVdeal with these problems.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo watch this beetle,
p78
aVand there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.
p79
aVThe first is how it deals with this obstacle
p80
aVthat we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance,
p81
aVand then it carries on in exactly the same direction
p82
aVthat it took in the first place.
p83
aVA little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.
p84
aVSo clearly this animal knows where it's going
p85
aVand it knows where it wants to go,
p86
aVand that's a very, very important thing,
p87
aVbecause if you think about it, you're at the dung pile,
p88
aVyou've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else,
p89
aVand the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.
p90
aVSo we gave them some more tasks to deal with,
p91
aVand what we did here is we turned the world
p92
aVunder their feet. And watch its response.
p93
aVSo this animal has actually had the whole world
p94
aVturned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees.
p95
aVBut it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go,
p96
aVand it heads off in that particular direction.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo our next question then was,
p99
aVhow are they doing this?
p100
aVWhat are they doing? And there was a cue that was available to us.
p101
aVIt was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball
p102
aVand they'd take a look at the world around them.
p103
aVAnd what do you think they could be looking at
p104
aVas they climb on top of the ball?
p105
aVWhat are the obvious cues that this animal could use
p106
aVto direct its movement? And the most obvious one
p107
aVis to look at the sky, and so we thought,
p108
aVnow what could they be looking at in the sky?
p109
aVAnd the obvious thing to look at is the sun.
p110
aVSo a classic experiment here,
p111
aVin that what we did was we moved the sun.
p112
aVWhat we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board
p113
aVand then move the sun with a mirror
p114
aVto a completely different position.
p115
aVAnd look at what the beetle does.
p116
aVIt does a little double dance,
p117
aVand then it heads back in exactly the same direction
p118
aVit went in the first place.
p119
aVWhat happens now? So clearly they're looking at the sun.
p120
aVThe sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe thing is the sun is not always available to you,
p123
aVbecause at sunset it disappears below the horizon.
p124
aVWhat is happening in the sky here
p125
aVis that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky
p126
aVthat you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built.
p127
aVBut the sun is at the horizon over here
p128
aVand we know that when the sun is at the horizon,
p129
aVsay it's over on this side,
p130
aVthere is a north-south, a huge pathway across the sky
p131
aVof polarized light that we can't see
p132
aVthat the beetles can see.
p133
aVSo how do we test that? Well, that's easy.
p134
aVWhat we do is we get a great big polarization filter,
p135
aVpop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right angles
p136
aVto the polarization pattern of the sky.
p137
aVThe beetle comes out from underneath the filter
p138
aVand it does a right-hand turn,
p139
aVbecause it comes back under the sky
p140
aVthat it was originally orientated to
p141
aVand then reorientates itself back
p142
aVto the direction it was originally going in.
p143
aVSo obviously beetles can see polarized light.
p144
aa(lp145
VOkay, so what we've got so far is,
p146
aVwhat are beetles doing? They're rolling balls.
p147
aVHow are they doing it? Well, they're rolling them in a straight line.
p148
aVHow are they maintaining it in a particular straight line?
p149
aVWell, they're looking at celestial cues in the sky,
p150
aVsome of which you and I can't see.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut how do they pick up those celestial cues?
p153
aVThat was what was of interest to us next.
p154
aVAnd it was this particular little behavior, the dance,
p155
aVthat we thought was important, because look,
p156
aVit takes a pause every now and then,
p157
aVand then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in.
p158
aVSo what are they doing when they do this dance?
p159
aVHow far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?
p160
aVAnd in this experiment here, what we did was we forced them
p161
aVinto a channel, and you can see he wasn't
p162
aVparticularly forced into this particular channel,
p163
aVand we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees
p164
aVuntil this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction
p165
aVthat it wanted to go in, in the first place.
p166
aVAnd let's see what his reaction is
p167
aVas he's headed through 90 degrees here,
p168
aVand now he's going to \u2014 when he ends up down here,
p169
aVhe's going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
p170
aVAnd see what his response is.
p171
aVHe does a little dance, he turns around,
p172
aVand heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going.
p173
aVHe knows exactly what the problem is,
p174
aVand he knows exactly how to deal with it,
p175
aVand the dance is this transition behavior
p176
aVthat allows them to reorientate themselves.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo that's the dance, but after spending many years
p179
aVsitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days,
p180
aVwe noticed that there was another behavior
p181
aVassociated with the dance behavior.
p182
aVEvery now and then, when they climb on top of the ball,
p183
aVthey wipe their face.
p184
aVAnd you see him do it again.
p185
aVNow we thought, now what could be going on here?
p186
aVClearly the ground is very hot, and when the ground is hot,
p187
aVthey dance more often, and when they do this particular dance,
p188
aVthey wipe the bottom of their face.
p189
aVAnd we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior.
p190
aVWe thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to
p191
aVget off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face
p192
aVto cool their head down.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo what we did was design a couple of arenas.
p195
aVone was hot, one was cold.
p196
aVWe shaded this one. We left that one hot.
p197
aVAnd then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera.
p198
aVSo what you're looking at here is a heat image
p199
aVof the system, and what you can see here emerging
p200
aVfrom the poo is a cool dung ball.
p201
aVSo the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here,
p202
aVdung is cool. (Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature
p205
aVof the beetle against the background.
p206
aVSo the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade.
p207
aVThe beetle itself and the ball are probably around about
p208
aV30 to 35 degrees centigrade,
p209
aVso this is a great big ball of ice cream
p210
aVthat this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.
p211
aVIt isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because
p212
aVits body temperature is actually relatively low.
p213
aVIt's about the same as yours and mine.
p214
aVAnd what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool.
p215
aVBut if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment,
p216
aVlook at the temperature of the soil.
p217
aVIt's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.
p218
aVWatch how often the beetle dances.
p219
aVAnd look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot.
p220
aVSo the ball leaves a little thermal shadow,
p221
aVand the beetle climbs on top of the ball
p222
aVand wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down,
p223
aVwe think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd what we did then was put little boots on these legs,
p226
aVbecause this was a way to test if the legs
p227
aVwere involved in sensing the temperature of the soil.
p228
aVAnd if you look over here, with boots they climb onto the ball
p229
aVfar less often when they had no boots on.
p230
aVSo we described these as cool boots.
p231
aVIt was a dental compound that we used to make these boots.
p232
aVAnd we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able
p233
aVto put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball,
p234
aVand they climbed onto that ball far less often
p235
aVthan when they had a hot ball.
p236
aVSo this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior
p237
aVthat you and I do if we cross the beach,
p238
aVwe jump onto a towel, somebody has this towel \u2014
p239
aV"Sorry, I've jumped onto your towel." \u2014
p240
aVand then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel,
p241
aVand that way you don't burn your feet.
p242
aVAnd that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.
p243
aa(lp244
VHowever, there's one more story I'd like to share with you,
p245
aVand that's this particular species.
p246
aVIt's from a genus called Pachysoma.
p247
aVThere are 13 species in the genus, and they have
p248
aVa particular behavior that I think you will find interesting.
p249
aVThis is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing.
p250
aVCan you spot the difference?
p251
aVThey don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion.
p252
aVbut it's walking forwards,
p253
aVand it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it.
p254
aVThis is a different species in the same genus
p255
aVbut exactly the same foraging behavior.
p256
aa(lp257
VThere's one more interesting aspect of this
p258
aVdung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating,
p259
aVand that's that it forages and provisions a nest.
p260
aVSo watch this individual here, and what he's trying to do
p261
aVis set up a nest.
p262
aVAnd he doesn't like this first position,
p263
aVbut he comes up with a second position,
p264
aVand about 50 minutes later, that nest is finished,
p265
aVand he heads off to forage and provision
p266
aVat a pile of dry dung pellets.
p267
aVAnd what I want you to notice is the outward path
p268
aVcompared to the homeward path, and compare the two.
p269
aVAnd by and large, you'll see that the homeward path
p270
aVis far more direct than the outward path.
p271
aVOn the outward path, he's always on the lookout
p272
aVfor a new blob of dung.
p273
aVOn the way home, he knows where home is,
p274
aVand he wants to go straight to it.
p275
aVThe important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip,
p276
aVas in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated
p277
aVback and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site.
p278
aVAnd watch, you're going to see
p279
aVanother South African crime taking place right now. (Laughter)
p280
aVAnd his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo what we're looking at here
p283
aVis a behavior called path integration.
p284
aVAnd what's taking place is that the beetle
p285
aVhas got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path
p286
aVlooking for food, and then when it finds food,
p287
aVit heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.
p288
aVNow there's two ways it could be doing that,
p289
aVand we can test that by displacing the beetle
p290
aVto a new position when it's at the foraging site.
p291
aVIf it's using landmarks, it will find its home.
p292
aVIf it is using something called path integration,
p293
aVit will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot,
p294
aVand what it's doing here if it's using path integration
p295
aVis it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.
p296
aVIt knows the bearing home, and it knows it should be in that direction.
p297
aVIf you displace it, it ends up in the wrong place.
p298
aVSo let's see what happens when we put this beetle
p299
aVto the test with a similar experiment.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo here's our cunning experimenter.
p302
aVHe displaces the beetle,
p303
aVand now we have to see what is going to take place.
p304
aVWhat we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was.
p305
aVThe forage has been displaced to a new position.
p306
aVIf he's using landmark orientation,
p307
aVhe should be able to find the burrow,
p308
aVbecause he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it.
p309
aVIf he's using path integration,
p310
aVthen it should end up in the wrong spot over here.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo let's watch what happens
p313
aVwhen we put the beetle through the whole test.
p314
aVSo there he is there.
p315
aVHe's about to head home, and look what happens.
p316
aVShame.
p317
aVIt hasn't a clue.
p318
aVIt starts to search for its house in the right distance
p319
aVaway from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.
p320
aVSo we know now that this animal uses path integration
p321
aVto find its way around, and the callous experimenter
p322
aVleads it top left and leaves it. (Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VSo what we're looking at here are a group of animals
p325
aVthat use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass
p326
aVto find their way around,
p327
aVand they have some sort of system
p328
aVfor measuring that distance,
p329
aVand we know that these species here actually
p330
aVcount the steps. That's what they use as an odometer,
p331
aVa step-counting system, to find their way back home.
p332
aVWe don't know yet what dung beetles use.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo what have we learned from these animals
p335
aVwith a brain that's the size of a grain of rice?
p336
aVWell, we know that they can roll balls in a straight line
p337
aVusing celestial cues.
p338
aVWe know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior
p339
aVand it's also a thermoregulation behavior,
p340
aVand we also know that they use a path integration system
p341
aVfor finding their way home.
p342
aVSo for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance
p343
aVwe can actually learn an awful lot from these things
p344
aVdoing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do.
p345
aVThank you. (Applause)

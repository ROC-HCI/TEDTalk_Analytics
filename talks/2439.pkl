V1.3 billion years ago,
p5
aVin a distant, distant galaxy,
p6
aVtwo black holes locked into a spiral,
p7
aVfalling inexorably towards each other
p8
aVand collided,
p9
aVconverting three Suns' worth of stuff
p10
aVinto pure energy in a tenth of a second.
p11
aVFor that brief moment in time,
p12
aVthe glow was brighter than all the stars
p13
aVin all the galaxies
p14
aVin all of the known Universe.
p15
aVIt was a very
p16
aVbig
p17
aVbang.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut they didn't release their energy in light.
p20
aVI mean, you know, they're black holes.
p21
aVAll that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself,
p22
aVmaking the Universe explode in gravitational waves.
p23
aa(lp24
VLet me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.
p25
aV1.3 billion years ago,
p26
aVEarth had just managed to evolve multicellular life.
p27
aVSince then, Earth has made and evolved
p28
aVcorals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even \u2014 God save us \u2014 the Internet.
p29
aVAnd about 25 years ago,
p30
aVa particularly audacious set of people \u2014
p31
aVRai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech \u2014
p32
aVdecided that it would be really neat
p33
aVto build a giant laser detector
p34
aVwith which to search for the gravitational waves
p35
aVfrom things like colliding black holes.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, most people thought they were nuts.
p38
aVBut enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts
p39
aVthat the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea.
p40
aVSo after decades of development,
p41
aVconstruction and imagination
p42
aVand a breathtaking amount of hard work,
p43
aVthey built their detector, called LIGO:
p44
aVThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
p45
aa(lp46
VFor the last several years,
p47
aVLIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy,
p48
aVa tremendous improvement in its detection ability.
p49
aVIt's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.
p50
aa(lp51
VIn early September of 2015,
p52
aVLIGO turned on for a final test run
p53
aVwhile they sorted out a few lingering details.
p54
aVAnd on September 14 of 2015,
p55
aVjust days after the detector had gone live,
p56
aVthe gravitational waves from those colliding black holes
p57
aVpassed through the Earth.
p58
aVAnd they passed through you and me.
p59
aVAnd they passed through the detector.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Audio) Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life
p62
aVmore emotionally intense than that.
p63
aVOne is the birth of my daughter.
p64
aVThe other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill.
p65
aVYou know, it was the payoff of my career, basically.
p66
aVEverything I'd been working on \u2014 it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)
p67
aa(lp68
VAllan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes,
p69
aVa theoretical physicist at MIT,
p70
aVwho has been studying gravitational waves from black holes
p71
aVand the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO,
p72
aVfor the past 23 years.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.
p75
aVA gravitational wave is a ripple
p76
aVin the shape of space and time.
p77
aVAs the wave passes by,
p78
aVit stretches space and everything in it
p79
aVin one direction,
p80
aVand compresses it in the other.
p81
aVThis has led to countless instructors of general relativity
p82
aVdoing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.
p83
aV"It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands."
p84
aa(lp85
VSo the trouble with gravitational waves
p86
aVis that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.
p87
aVFor example, the waves that hit us on September 14 \u2014
p88
aVand yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed
p89
aVunder the action of that wave \u2014
p90
aVwhen the waves hit, they stretched the average person
p91
aVby one part in 10 to the 21.
p92
aVThat's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,
p93
aVand a one.
p94
aVThat's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.
p95
aVEven with a laser detector five kilometers long \u2014 and that's already crazy \u2014
p96
aVthey would have to measure the length of those detectors
p97
aVto less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus
p98
aVof an atom.
p99
aVAnd that's preposterous.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo towards the end of his classic text on gravity,
p102
aVLIGO co-founder Kip Thorne
p103
aVdescribed the hunt for gravitational waves as follows:
p104
aVHe said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted
p105
aVin constructing such detectors
p106
aVare enormous.
p107
aVBut physicists are ingenious,
p108
aVand with the support of a broad lay public,
p109
aVall obstacles will surely be overcome."
p110
aVThorne published that in 1973,
p111
aV42 years before he succeeded.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, coming back to LIGO,
p114
aVScott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear
p115
aVmore than it does like an eye.
p116
aVI want to explain what that means.
p117
aVVisible light has a wavelength, a size,
p118
aVthat's much smaller than the things around you,
p119
aVthe features on people's faces,
p120
aVthe size of your cell phone.
p121
aVAnd that's really useful,
p122
aVbecause it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you,
p123
aVby looking at the light coming from different spots
p124
aVin the scene about you.
p125
aa(lp126
VSound is different.
p127
aVAudible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long.
p128
aVAnd that makes it really difficult \u2014
p129
aVin fact, in practical purposes, impossible \u2014 to make an image
p130
aVof something you really care about.
p131
aVYour child's face.
p132
aVInstead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch
p133
aVand tone and rhythm and volume
p134
aVto infer a story behind the sounds.
p135
aVThat's Alice talking.
p136
aVThat's Bob interrupting.
p137
aVSilly Bob.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo, the same is true of gravitational waves.
p140
aVWe can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.
p141
aVBut by listening to changes
p142
aVin the amplitude and frequency of those waves,
p143
aVwe can hear the story that those waves are telling.
p144
aVAnd at least for LIGO,
p145
aVthe frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.
p146
aVSo if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound,
p147
aVwe can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.
p148
aVFor example, listening to gravity, just in this way,
p149
aVcan tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes,
p150
aVsomething my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Audio) SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning,
p153
aVyou get a very simple chirp: whoop!
p154
aVIf the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp,
p155
aVbut with a modulation on top of it,
p156
aVso it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!
p157
aVIt's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.
p158
aa(lp159
VAA: So on September 14, 2015,
p160
aVa date that's definitely going to live in my memory,
p161
aVLIGO heard this:
p162
aa(lp163
V[Whirring sound]
p164
aa(lp165
VSo if you know how to listen, that is the sound of \u2014
p166
aa(lp167
V(Audio) SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses,
p168
aVthat were whirling around at a rate
p169
aVcomparable to what goes on in your blender.
p170
aa(lp171
VAA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.
p172
aVTwo black holes, the densest thing in the Universe,
p173
aVone with a mass of 29 Suns
p174
aVand one with a mass of 36 Suns,
p175
aVwhirling around each other 100 times per second
p176
aVbefore they collide.
p177
aVJust imagine the power of that.
p178
aVIt's fantastic.
p179
aVAnd we know it because we heard it.
p180
aa(lp181
VThat's the lasting importance of LIGO.
p182
aVIt's an entirely new way to observe the Universe
p183
aVthat we've never had before.
p184
aVIt's a way that lets us hear the Universe
p185
aVand hear the invisible.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd there's a lot out there that we can't see \u2014
p188
aVin practice or even in principle.
p189
aVSo supernova, for example:
p190
aVI would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae.
p191
aVThey're very useful;
p192
aVwe've learned a lot about the Universe from them.
p193
aVThe problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core,
p194
aVand the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers
p195
aVof iron and carbon and silicon.
p196
aVWe'll never see through it, it's opaque to light.
p197
aVGravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass \u2014
p198
aVtotally transparent.
p199
aVThe Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore
p200
aVthe first few moments of the Universe,
p201
aVbut we'll never see them,
p202
aVbecause the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow.
p203
aVWith gravitational waves,
p204
aVwe should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.
p205
aVPerhaps most importantly,
p206
aVI'm positive that there are things out there
p207
aVthat we've never seen
p208
aVthat we may never be able to see
p209
aVand that we haven't even imagined \u2014
p210
aVthings that we'll only discover by listening.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd in fact, even in that very first event,
p213
aVLIGO found things that we didn't expect.
p214
aVHere's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration,
p215
aVMatt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:
p216
aa(lp217
V(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes
p218
aVthat we observed here
p219
aVare the dinosaurs of the Universe.
p220
aVThey're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times,
p221
aVand the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones
p222
aVwith which we do this archeology.
p223
aVSo it lets us really get a whole nother angle
p224
aVon what's out there in the Universe
p225
aVand how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course,
p226
aVhow we came to be out of this whole mess.
p227
aa(lp228
VAA: Our challenge now
p229
aVis to be as audacious as possible.
p230
aVThanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors
p231
aVthat can listen to the Universe,
p232
aVto the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.
p233
aVOur job is to dream up and build new observatories \u2014
p234
aVa whole new generation of observatories \u2014
p235
aVon the ground, in space.
p236
aVI mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself?
p237
aVOur job now is to dream big.
p238
aVDream with us.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you.

His research in theoretical physics focuses on string  theory both as a model of quantum gravity and as a strong-coupling  description of non-gravitational systems. </p><p>Like water, string theory enjoys many distinct phases in which the  low-energy phenomena take qualitatively different forms. In its most  familiar phases, string theory reduces to a perturbative theory of  quantum gravity. These phases are useful for studying, for example, the  resolution of singularities in classical gravity, or the set of  possibilities for the geometry and fields of spacetime. Along these  lines, Adams is particularly interested in microscopic quantization of  flux vacua, and in the search for constraints on low-energy physics  derived from consistency of the stringy UV completion.</p>In other phases, when the gravitational interactions become strong  and a smooth spacetime geometry ceases to be a good approximation, a  more convenient description of string theory may be given in terms of a  weakly-coupled non-gravitational quantum field theory. Remarkably, these  two descriptions&mdash;with and without gravity&mdash;appear to be completely  equivalent, with one remaining weakly-coupled when its dual is strongly  interacting. This equivalence, known as gauge-gravity duality, allows us  to study strongly-coupled string and quantum field theories by studying  perturbative features of their weakly-coupled duals. Gauge-gravity  duals have already led to interesting predictions for the quark-gluon  plasma studied at RHIC. A major focus of Adams&#39;s present research is to  use such dualities to find weakly-coupled descriptions of  strongly-interacting condensed matter systems which can be realized in  the lab.", "slug": "allan_adams", "whotheyare": "Allan Adams is a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of fluid dynamics, quantum field theory and string theory.

theoretical physicist working at the intersection of fluid dynamics, quantum field theory and string theory. His research in theoretical physics focuses on string  theory both as a model of quantum gravity and as a strong-coupling  description of non-gravitational systems. </p><p>Like water, string theory enjoys many distinct phases in which the  low-energy phenomena take qualitatively different forms. In its most  familiar phases, string theory reduces to a perturbative theory of  quantum gravity. These phases are useful for studying, for example, the  resolution of singularities in classical gravity, or the set of  possibilities for the geometry and fields of spacetime. Along these  lines, Adams is particularly interested in microscopic quantization of  flux vacua, and in the search for constraints on low-energy physics  derived from consistency of the stringy UV completion.</p>In other phases, when the gravitational interactions become strong  and a smooth spacetime geometry ceases to be a good approximation, a  more convenient description of string theory may be given in terms of a  weakly-coupled non-gravitational quantum field theory. Remarkably, these  two descriptions&mdash;with and without gravity&mdash;appear to be completely  equivalent, with one remaining weakly-coupled when its dual is strongly  interacting. This equivalence, known as gauge-gravity duality, allows us  to study strongly-coupled string and quantum field theories by studying  perturbative features of their weakly-coupled duals. Gauge-gravity  duals have already led to interesting predictions for the quark-gluon  plasma studied at RHIC. A major focus of Adams&#39;s present research is to  use such dualities to find weakly-coupled descriptions of  strongly-interacting condensed matter systems which can be realized in  the lab.", "slug": "allan_adams", "whotheyare": "Allan Adams is a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of fluid dynamics, quantum field theory and string theory.

VNamaste. Good morning.
p5
aVI'm very happy to be here in India.
p6
aVAnd I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned
p7
aVover these last particularly 11 years
p8
aVwith V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues,"
p9
aVtraveling the world,
p10
aVessentially meeting with women and girls across the planet
p11
aVto stop violence against women.
p12
aa(lp13
VWhat I want to talk about today
p14
aVis this particular cell,
p15
aVor grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.
p16
aVAnd I want to call it the girl cell.
p17
aVAnd it's in men as well as in women.
p18
aVI want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells
p19
aVis central to the evolution of our species
p20
aVand the continuation of the human race.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd I want you imagine that at some point in history
p23
aVa group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world
p24
aVunderstood that the suppression of this particular cell,
p25
aVthe oppression of these cells,
p26
aVthe reinterpretation of these cells,
p27
aVthe undermining of these cells,
p28
aVgetting us to believe in the weakness of these cells
p29
aVand the crushing, eradicating, destroying,
p30
aVreducing these cells,
p31
aVbasically began the process of killing off the girl cell,
p32
aVwhich was, by the way, patriarchy.
p33
aa(lp34
VI want you to imagine that the girl is a chip
p35
aVin the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.
p36
aVAnd it is essential to balance, to wisdom
p37
aVand to actually the future of all of us.
p38
aVAnd then I want you to imagine that this girl cell
p39
aVis compassion,
p40
aVand it's empathy, and it's passion itself,
p41
aVand it's vulnerability,
p42
aVand it's openness, and it's intensity,
p43
aVand it's association, and it's relationship,
p44
aVand it is intuitive.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd then let's think how compassion informs wisdom,
p47
aVand that vulnerability is our greatest strength,
p48
aVand that emotions have inherent logic,
p49
aVwhich lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.
p50
aVAnd then let's remember that we've been taught
p51
aVthe exact opposite by the powers that be,
p52
aVthat compassion clouds your thinking,
p53
aVthat it gets in the way,
p54
aVthat vulnerability is weakness,
p55
aVthat emotions are not to be trusted,
p56
aVand you're not supposed to take things personally,
p57
aVwhich is one of my favorites.
p58
aa(lp59
VI think the whole world has essentially
p60
aVbeen brought up not to be a girl.
p61
aVHow do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?
p62
aVTo be a boy really means not to be a girl.
p63
aVTo be a man means not to be a girl.
p64
aVTo be a woman means not to be a girl.
p65
aVTo be strong means not to be a girl.
p66
aVTo be a leader means not to be a girl.
p67
aVI actually think that
p68
aVbeing a girl is so powerful
p69
aVthat we've had to train everyone not to be that.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd I'd also like to say that the irony
p73
aVof course, is that denying girl,
p74
aVsuppressing girl, suppressing emotion,
p75
aVrefusing feeling has lead thus here.
p76
aVWhere we have now come to live in a world where
p77
aVthe most extreme forms of violence,
p78
aVthe most horrific poverty,
p79
aVgenocide, mass rapes,
p80
aVthe destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.
p81
aVAnd because we have suppressed our girl cells
p82
aVand suppressed our girl-ship,
p83
aVwe do not feel what is going on.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo, we are not being charged with
p86
aVthe adequate response to what is happening.
p87
aVI want to talk a little bit about
p88
aVthe Democratic Republic of Congo.
p89
aVFor me, it was the turning point of my life.
p90
aVI have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.
p91
aVI feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world,
p92
aVa lot of violence.
p93
aa(lp94
VI essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.
p95
aVBut the Democratic Republic of Congo
p96
aVreally was the turning point in my soul.
p97
aVI went and I spent time
p98
aVin a place called Bukavu
p99
aVin a hospital called the Panzi Hospital,
p100
aVwith a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.
p101
aVHis name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.
p102
aVIn the Congo, for those of you who don't know,
p103
aVthere has been a war raging for the last 12 years,
p104
aVa war that has killed nearly six million people.
p105
aVIt is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women
p106
aVhave been raped there.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhen I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital
p109
aVI sat with women
p110
aVwho sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.
p111
aVTheir stories were so horrific,
p112
aVand so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,
p113
aVthat to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.
p114
aVAnd I will tell you that what happened
p115
aVis through that shattering,
p116
aVlistening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated,
p117
aVwho had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them
p118
aVso they had holes, literally, inside them
p119
aVwhere their pee and poop came out of them.
p120
aa(lp121
VListening to the story of 80-year-old women
p122
aVwho were tied to chains and circled,
p123
aVand where groups of men would come and rape them periodically,
p124
aVall in the name of economic exploitation
p125
aVto steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.
p126
aVMy mind was so shattered.
p127
aa(lp128
VBut what happened for me is that that shattering
p129
aVactually emboldened me
p130
aVin a way I have never been emboldened.
p131
aVThat shattering, that opening of my girl cell,
p132
aVthat kind of massive breakthrough of my heart
p133
aVallowed me to become more courageous, and braver,
p134
aVand actually more clever
p135
aVthan I had been in the past in my life.
p136
aa(lp137
VI want to say that I think the powers that be
p138
aVknow that empire-building
p139
aVis actually \u2014 that feelings get in the way of empire-building.
p140
aVFeelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,
p141
aVand excavating the Earth, and destroying things.
p142
aVI remember, for example, when my father,
p143
aVwho was very, very violent, used to beat me.
p144
aVAnd he would actually say, while he was beating me,
p145
aV"Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry."
p146
aVBecause my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.
p147
aVAnd even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded
p148
aVof what he was doing.
p149
aa(lp150
VI know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.
p151
aVAnd I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.
p152
aVAnd I think in some ways
p153
aVwe've been much harsher to men
p154
aVin the annihilation of their girl cell.
p155
aV(Applause)
p156
aVI see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet:
p157
aVto be tough, to be hardened,
p158
aVto distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.
p159
aVI actually realized once in Kosovo,
p160
aVwhen I watched a man break down,
p161
aVthat bullets are actually hardened tears,
p162
aVthat when we don't allow men to have their girl self
p163
aVand have their vulnerability, and have their compassion,
p164
aVand have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful
p165
aVand violent.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd I think we have taught men to be secure
p168
aVwhen they are insecure,
p169
aVto pretend they know things when they don't know things,
p170
aVor why would we be where we are?
p171
aVTo pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.
p172
aVAnd I will tell you a very funny story.
p173
aVOn my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.
p174
aVAnd all these men, literally at least 10 men,
p175
aVwere in their little seats watching chick flicks.
p176
aVAnd they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men."
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VI've traveled, as I said,
p180
aVto many, many countries,
p181
aVand I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us
p182
aVthen obviously it's horrific to think
p183
aVwhat we do to girls in the world.
p184
aVAnd we heard from Sunitha yesterday,
p185
aVand Kavita about what we do to girls.
p186
aVBut I just want to say that
p187
aVI've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns,
p188
aVwho are literally being treated like ashtrays.
p189
aVI've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.
p190
aVI've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers
p191
aVand brothers and fathers and uncles.
p192
aVI've seen girls starving themselves to death in America
p193
aVin institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.
p194
aa(lp195
VI've seen that we cut girls and we control them
p196
aVand we keep them illiterate,
p197
aVor we make them feel bad about being too smart.
p198
aVWe silence them. We make them feel guilty
p199
aVfor being smart. We get them to behave,
p200
aVto tone it down, not to be too intense.
p201
aVWe sell them, we kill them as embryos,
p202
aVwe enslave them, we rape them.
p203
aVWe are so accustomed to robbing girls
p204
aVof the subject of being the subjects of their lives
p205
aVthat we have now actually objectified them
p206
aVand turned them into commodities.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe selling of girls is rampant across the planet.
p209
aVAnd in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.
p210
aVBut I also want to talk about the fact that
p211
aVif one in eight people on the planet
p212
aVare girls between the ages of 10 to 24,
p213
aVthey are they key, really, in the developing world,
p214
aVas well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.
p215
aVAnd if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages
p216
aVthat keep them where society wants them to be,
p217
aVincluding lack of access to healthcare,
p218
aVeducation, healthy foods,
p219
aVlabor force participation.
p220
aVThe burden of all the household tasks
p221
aVusually falls on girls and younger siblings,
p222
aVwhich ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.
p223
aa(lp224
VThe state of girls, the condition of girls,
p225
aVwill, in my belief \u2014 and that's the girl inside us
p226
aVand the girl in the world \u2014 determine whether
p227
aVthe species survives.
p228
aVAnd what I want to suggest is that,
p229
aVhaving talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called
p230
aV"I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World,"
p231
aVI've been talking to girls for five years,
p232
aVand one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere
p233
aVis that the verb that's been enforced on girl
p234
aVis the verb "to please."
p235
aVGirls are trained to please.
p236
aVI want to change the verb.
p237
aVI want us all to change the verb.
p238
aVI want the verb to be "educate,"
p239
aVor "activate," or "engage,"
p240
aVor "confront," or "defy," or "create."
p241
aVIf we teach girls to change the verb
p242
aVwe will actually enforce the girl inside us
p243
aVand the girl inside them.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd I have to now share a few stories
p246
aVof girls I've seen across the planet
p247
aVwho have engaged their girl,
p248
aVwho have taken on their girl in spite of
p249
aVall the circumstances around them.
p250
aVI know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands,
p251
aVfor example, who is demanding that she take a boat
p252
aVand go around the entire world by herself.
p253
aa(lp254
VThere is a teenage girl who just recently
p255
aVwent out and knew that she needed 56 stars
p256
aVtattooed on the right side of her face.
p257
aa(lp258
VThere is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill,
p259
aVwho lived for a year in a tree
p260
aVbecause she wanted to protect the wild oaks.
p261
aa(lp262
VThere is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan
p263
aVwho I have adopted as my daughter
p264
aVbecause her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary.
p265
aVAnd this girl, when she was 17 years old,
p266
aVwore a burqa in Afghanistan,
p267
aVand went into the stadiums
p268
aVand documented the atrocities that were going on towards women,
p269
aVunderneath her burqa, with a video.
p270
aVAnd that video became the video that went out all over the world
p271
aVafter 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan.
p272
aa(lp273
VI want to talk about Rachel Corrie
p274
aVwho was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank
p275
aVto say, "End the occupation."
p276
aVAnd she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down
p277
aVand rolled over by that tank.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently
p280
aVin Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.
p281
aVAnd she was holding her baby.
p282
aVAnd I asked her if she loved her baby.
p283
aVAnd she looked into her baby's eyes and she said,
p284
aV"Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?
p285
aVIt's my baby and it's full of love."
p286
aa(lp287
VThe capacity for girls to overcome situations
p288
aVand to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.
p289
aVThere is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya.
p290
aVDorcas is 15 years old,
p291
aVand she was trained in self-defense.
p292
aVA few months ago she was picked up on the street
p293
aVby three older men.
p294
aVThey kidnapped her, they put her in a car.
p295
aVAnd through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples,
p296
aVshe punched them in the eyes
p297
aVand she got herself free and out of the car.
p298
aa(lp299
VIn Kenya, in August,
p300
aVI went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls,
p301
aVa house we opened seven years ago
p302
aVwith an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.
p303
aVAgnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl,
p304
aVshe was female genitally mutilated.
p305
aVAnd she made a decision as many women do across this planet,
p306
aVthat what was done to her would not be enforced and done
p307
aVto other women and girls.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.
p310
aVShe taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like,
p311
aVand what a mutilated vagina looked like.
p312
aVAnd in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her
p313
aVwe asked her what we could do for her,
p314
aVand she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."
p315
aVSo, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?"
p318
aVAnd she said, "Well, now, I need a house."
p319
aVSo, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house
p320
aVin Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.
p321
aVAnd it was a house where girls could run away,
p322
aVthey could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut,
p323
aVthey could go to school.
p324
aVAnd in the years that Agnes has had the house,
p325
aVshe has changed the situation there.
p326
aVShe has literally become deputy mayor.
p327
aVShe's changed the rules.
p328
aVThe whole community has bought in to what she's doing.
p329
aa(lp330
VWhen we were there she was doing a ritual
p331
aVwhere she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.
p332
aVAnd there was a young girl named Jaclyn.
p333
aVJaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family
p334
aVand there's a drought in Kenya.
p335
aVSo cows are dying, and cows are the most
p336
aVvalued possession.
p337
aVAnd Jaclyn overheard her father
p338
aVtalking to an old man about
p339
aVhow he was about to sell her for the cows.
p340
aVAnd she knew that meant she would be cut.
p341
aVShe knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.
p342
aVShe knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.
p343
aVShe knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house,
p346
aVJaclyn left her father's house
p347
aVand she walked for two days, two days
p348
aVthrough Masai land.
p349
aVShe slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.
p350
aVShe imagined her father killing her on one hand,
p351
aVand Mama Agnes greeting her,
p352
aVwith the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.
p353
aVAnd when she got to the house she was greeted.
p354
aVAgnes took her in, and Agnes loved her,
p355
aVand Agnes supported her for the year.
p356
aVShe went to school and she found her voice,
p357
aVand she found her identity, and she found her heart.
p358
aa(lp359
VThen, her time was ready
p360
aVwhen she had to go back to talk to her father
p361
aVabout the reconciliation, after a year.
p362
aVI had the privilege of being in the hut
p363
aVwhen she was reunited with her father and reconciled.
p364
aVIn that hut, we walked in,
p365
aVand her father and his four wives were sitting there,
p366
aVand her sisters who had just returned because
p367
aVthey had all fled when she had fled,
p368
aVand her primary mother, who had been beaten
p369
aVin standing up for her with the elders.
p370
aVWhen her father saw her and saw who she had become,
p371
aVin her full girl self,
p372
aVhe threw his arms around her and broke down crying.
p373
aVHe said, "You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.
p374
aVWe will not cut you.
p375
aVAnd I give you my word, here and now,
p376
aVthat we will not cut your sisters either."
p377
aa(lp378
VAnd what she said to him was,
p379
aV"You were willing to sell me for four cows,
p380
aVand a calf and some blankets.
p381
aVBut I promise you, now that I will be educated
p382
aVI will always take care of you,
p383
aVand I will come back and I will build you a house.
p384
aVAnd I will be in your corner for the rest of your life."
p385
aa(lp386
VFor me, that is the power of girls.
p387
aVAnd that is the power of transformation.
p388
aVI want to close today
p389
aVwith a new piece from my book.
p390
aVAnd I want to do it tonight
p391
aVfor the girl in everybody here.
p392
aVAnd I want to do it for Sunitha.
p393
aVAnd I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday,
p394
aVthe girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.
p395
aVBut I really want to do it for each and every person here,
p396
aVto value the girl in us,
p397
aVto value the part that cries,
p398
aVto value the part that's emotional,
p399
aVto value the part that's vulnerable,
p400
aVto understand that's where the future lies.
p401
aa(lp402
VThis is called "I'm An Emotional Creature."
p403
aVAnd it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.
p404
aVI was asking girls if they like being a girl,
p405
aVand all the girls were like, "No, I hate it. I can't stand it.
p406
aVIt's all bad. My brothers get everything."
p407
aVAnd this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl.
p408
aVI'm an emotional creature!"
p409
aV(Laughter)
p410
aVThis is for her:
p411
aa(lp412
VI love being a girl.
p413
aVI can feel what you're feeling
p414
aVas you're feeling inside the feeling before.
p415
aVI am an emotional creature.
p416
aVThings do not come to me as intellectual theories
p417
aVor hard-pressed ideas.
p418
aVThey pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears.
p419
aVOh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off,
p420
aVeven though she appears to give you what you want.
p421
aVI know when a storm is coming.
p422
aVI can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.
p423
aVI can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share.
p424
aa(lp425
VI am an emotional creature.
p426
aVI love that I do not take things lightly.
p427
aVEverything is intense to me,
p428
aVthe way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up,
p429
aVthe way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news.
p430
aa(lp431
VI am an emotional creature.
p432
aVI am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that.
p433
aVDon't you say all negative
p434
aVthat it's only only a teenage thing,
p435
aVor it's only because I'm a girl.
p436
aVThese feelings make me better.
p437
aVThey make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong.
p438
aa(lp439
VI am an emotional creature.
p440
aVThere is a particular way of knowing.
p441
aVIt's like the older women somehow forgot.
p442
aVI rejoice that it's still in my body.
p443
aVOh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.
p444
aVI know we have pushed the Earth too far.
p445
aVI know my father isn't coming back,
p446
aVand that no one's prepared for the fire.
p447
aVI know that lipstick means more than show,
p448
aVand boys are super insecure,

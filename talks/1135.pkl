VMy name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.
p5
aVI've been making toys for the last 30 years.
p6
aVThe early '70s, I was in college.
p7
aVIt was a very revolutionary time.
p8
aVIt was a political ferment, so to say \u2014
p9
aVstudents out in the streets of Paris,
p10
aVrevolting against authority.
p11
aVAmerica was jolted
p12
aVby the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.
p13
aVIn India, we had the Naxalite movement,
p14
aVthe [unclear] movement.
p15
aVBut you know, when there is a political churning of society,
p16
aVit unleashes a lot of energy.
p17
aVThe National Movement of India
p18
aVwas testimony to that.
p19
aVLots of people resigned from well-paid jobs
p20
aVand jumped into the National Movement.
p21
aVNow in the early '70s,
p22
aVone of the great programs in India
p23
aVwas to revitalize
p24
aVprimary science in village schools.
p25
aa(lp26
VThere was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech
p27
aVand returned back as a molecular biologist
p28
aVin India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR.
p29
aVAt 31, he was not able
p30
aVto relate the kind of [unclear] research,
p31
aVwhich he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people.
p32
aVSo he designed and went and started a village science program.
p33
aVMany people were inspired by this.
p34
aVThe slogan of the early '70s
p35
aVwas "Go to the people.
p36
aVLive with them; love them.
p37
aVStart from what they know. Build on what they have."
p38
aVThis was kind of the defining slogan.
p39
aa(lp40
VWell I took one year.
p41
aVI joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune.
p42
aVI worked there for two years,
p43
aVand I realized that I was not born to make trucks.
p44
aVOften one doesn't know what one wants to do,
p45
aVbut it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.
p46
aVSo I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.
p47
aVAnd it was a turning point.
p48
aVIt was a very small village \u2014
p49
aVa weekly bazaar
p50
aVwhere people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats.
p51
aVSo I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here."
p52
aVSo I just bought one specimen
p53
aVof everything which was sold on the roadside.
p54
aVAnd one thing which I found
p55
aVwas this black rubber.
p56
aa(lp57
VThis is called a cycle valve tube.
p58
aVWhen you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.
p59
aVAnd some of these models \u2014
p60
aVso you take a bit of this cycle valve tube,
p61
aVyou can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.
p62
aVIt's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles \u2014
p63
aVan acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.
p64
aVIt's like its own little coupling.
p65
aVIf you have three of them, and you loop them together,
p66
aVwell you make a triangle.
p67
aVWith four, you make a square,
p68
aVyou make a pentagon, you make a hexagon,
p69
aVyou make all these kind of polygons.
p70
aVAnd they have some wonderful properties.
p71
aVIf you look at the hexagon, for instance,
p72
aVit's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.
p73
aVYou can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.
p74
aVYou give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.
p75
aVBut this is very shaky.
p76
aVLook at the pentagon, for instance,
p77
aVpull this out \u2014 it becomes a boat shape trapezium.
p78
aVPush it and it becomes house shaped.
p79
aVThis becomes an isosceles triangle \u2014
p80
aVagain, very shaky.
p81
aVThis square might look very square and prim.
p82
aVGive it a little push \u2014 this becomes a rhombus.
p83
aVIt becomes kite-shaped.
p84
aVBut give a child a triangle,
p85
aVhe can't do a thing to it.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhy use triangles?
p88
aVBecause triangles are the only rigid structures.
p89
aVWe can't make a bridge with squares
p90
aVbecause the train would come, it would start doing a jig.
p91
aVOrdinary people know about this
p92
aVbecause if you go to a village in India,
p93
aVthey might not have gone to engineering college,
p94
aVbut no one makes a roof placed like this.
p95
aVBecause if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.
p96
aVThey always make a triangular roof.
p97
aVNow this is people science.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd if you were to just poke a hole over here
p100
aVand put a third matchstick,
p101
aVyou'll get a T joint.
p102
aVAnd if I were to poke all the three legs of this
p103
aVin the three vertices of this triangle,
p104
aVI would make a tetrahedron.
p105
aVSo you make all these 3D shapes.
p106
aVYou make a tetrahedron like this.
p107
aVAnd once you make these,
p108
aVyou make a little house.
p109
aVPut this on top.
p110
aVYou can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six.
p111
aVYou just need a ton.
p112
aVNow this was \u2014 you make a joint of six,
p113
aVyou make an icosahedron.
p114
aVYou can play around with it.
p115
aVThis makes an igloo.
p116
aVNow this is in 1978.
p117
aVI was a 24-year-old young engineer.
p118
aVAnd I thought this was so much better than making trucks.
p119
aV(Applause)
p120
aVIf you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside,
p121
aVyou simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.
p122
aVFour atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron,
p123
aVwhich means the little carbon atom.
p124
aa(lp125
VWell since then,
p126
aVI just thought that I've been really privileged
p127
aVto go to over 2,000 schools in my country \u2014
p128
aVvillage schools, government schools,
p129
aVmunicipal schools, Ivy League schools \u2014
p130
aVI've been invited by most of them.
p131
aVAnd every time I go to a school,
p132
aVI see a gleam in the eyes of the children.
p133
aVI see hope. I see happiness in their faces.
p134
aVChildren want to make things. Children want to do things.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow this, we make lots and lots of pumps.
p137
aVNow this is a little pump
p138
aVwith which you could inflate a balloon.
p139
aVIt's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.
p140
aVAnd we have a slogan
p141
aVthat the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.
p142
aVSo all you do is \u2014
p143
aVit's a very kind of provocative statement \u2014
p144
aVthis old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear]
p145
aVThis filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.
p146
aVAnd this is how you make a valve.
p147
aVYou put a little sticky tape.
p148
aVThis is one-way traffic.
p149
aVWell we make lots and lots of pumps.
p150
aVAnd this is the other one \u2014
p151
aVthat you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside
p152
aVand you make two half-cuts.
p153
aVNow this is what you do,
p154
aVis you bend both these legs into a triangle,
p155
aVand you just wrap some tape around.
p156
aVAnd this is the pump.
p157
aVAnd now, if you have this pump,
p158
aVit's like a great, great sprinkler.
p159
aVIt's like a centrifuge.
p160
aVIf you spin something, it tends to fly out.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Applause)
p163
aa(lp164
VWell in terms of \u2014 if you were in Andhra Pradesh,
p165
aVyou would make this with the palmyra leaf.
p166
aVMany of our folk toys
p167
aVhave great science principles.
p168
aVIf you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.
p169
aVIf I do it with both hands, you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man.
p170
aVRight.
p171
aVThis is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing.
p172
aVThere are four pictures.
p173
aVYou see insects,
p174
aVyou see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies,
p175
aVfrogs, snakes, eagles.
p176
aVHere's a paper which you could [unclear] \u2014
p177
aVdesigned by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928,
p178
aVArthur Stone,
p179
aVdocumented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.
p180
aVBut this is great fun for children.
p181
aVThey all study about the food chain.
p182
aVThe insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes;
p183
aVthe snakes are eaten by the eagles.
p184
aVAnd this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper \u2014
p185
aVA4 size paper \u2014
p186
aVyou could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school \u2014
p187
aVa paper, a scale and a pencil \u2014 no glue, no scissors.
p188
aVIn three minutes, you just fold this up.
p189
aVAnd what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.
p190
aVIf you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.
p191
aVWith a bigger one, you make a bigger one.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow this is a pencil with a few slots over here.
p194
aVAnd you put a little fan here.
p195
aVAnd this is a hundred-year-old toy.
p196
aVThere have been six major research papers on this.
p197
aVThere's some grooves over here, you can see.
p198
aVAnd if I take a reed \u2014 if I rub this,
p199
aVsomething very amazing happens.
p200
aVSix major research papers on this.
p201
aVAs a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this.
p202
aVHe wrote a paper on this.
p203
aVAnd you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider
p204
aVfor doing this. (Laughter) (Applause)
p205
aVThis is there for every child,
p206
aVand every child can enjoy this.
p207
aVIf you want to put a colored disk,
p208
aVwell all these seven colors coalesce.
p209
aVAnd this is what Newton talked about 400 years back,
p210
aVthat white light's made of seven colors,
p211
aVjust by spinning this around.
p212
aa(lp213
VThis is a straw.
p214
aVWhat we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape,
p215
aVnipped the right corner and the bottom left corner,
p216
aVso there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here.
p217
aVThis is a kind of a blowing straw.
p218
aVI just put this inside this.
p219
aVThere's a hole here, and I shut this.
p220
aVAnd this costs very little money to make \u2014
p221
aVgreat fun for children to do.
p222
aa(lp223
VWhat we do
p224
aVis make a very simple electric motor.
p225
aVNow this is the simplest motor on Earth.
p226
aVThe most expensive thing is the battery inside this.
p227
aVIf you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.
p228
aVThis is an old bicycle tube,
p229
aVwhich gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins.
p230
aVThis is a permanent magnet.
p231
aVWhenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.
p232
aVIt's the interaction of both these magnets
p233
aVwhich makes this motor spin.
p234
aVWe made 30,000.
p235
aa(lp236
VTeachers who have been teaching science for donkey years,
p237
aVthey just muck up the definition and they spit it out.
p238
aVWhen teachers make it, children make it.
p239
aVYou can see a gleam in their eye.
p240
aVThey get a thrill
p241
aVof what science is all about.
p242
aVAnd this science is not a rich man's game.
p243
aVIn a democratic country,
p244
aVscience must reach to our most oppressed,
p245
aVto the most marginalized children.
p246
aVThis program started with 16 schools
p247
aVand spread to 1,500 government schools.
p248
aVOver 100,000 children learn science this way.
p249
aVAnd we're just trying to see possibilities.
p250
aa(lp251
VLook, this is the tetrapak \u2014
p252
aVawful materials from the point of view of the environment.
p253
aVThere are six layers \u2014 three layers of plastic, aluminum \u2014
p254
aVwhich are are sealed together.
p255
aVThey are fused together, so you can't separate them.
p256
aVNow you can just make a little network like this
p257
aVand fold them and stick them together
p258
aVand make an icosahedron.
p259
aVSo something which is trash,
p260
aVwhich is choking all the seabirds,
p261
aVyou could just recycle this into a very, very joyous \u2014
p262
aVall the platonic solids can be made with things like this.
p263
aa(lp264
VThis is a little straw,
p265
aVand what you do is you just nip two corners here,
p266
aVand this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.
p267
aVYou put this in your mouth, and you blow.
p268
aV(Honk)
p269
aVIt's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say.
p270
aVYou're not able to see how the sound is produced,
p271
aVbecause the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.
p272
aVI'm going to keep this outside, to blow out. I'm going to suck in air.
p273
aV(Honk)
p274
aVSo no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound
p275
aVwith wire vibrations.
p276
aVThe other is that you keep blowing at it,
p277
aVkeep making the sound,
p278
aVand you keep cutting it.
p279
aVAnd something very, very nice happens.
p280
aV(Honk)
p281
aV(Applause)
p282
aVAnd when you get a very small one \u2014
p283
aV(Honk)
p284
aVThis is what the kids teach you. You can also do this.
p285
aa(lp286
VWell before I go any further,
p287
aVthis is something worth sharing.
p288
aVThis is a touching slate meant for blind children.
p289
aVThis is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate,
p290
aVand this is my drawing pen,
p291
aVwhich is basically a film box.
p292
aVIt's basically like a fisherman's line,
p293
aVa fishing line.
p294
aVAnd this is wool over here.
p295
aVIf I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.
p296
aVAnd what a blind child can do is to just draw this.
p297
aVWool sticks on Velcro.
p298
aVThere are 12 million blind children in our country \u2014
p299
aV(Applause)
p300
aVwho live in a world of darkness.
p301
aVAnd this has come as a great boon to them.
p302
aVThere's a factory out there making our children blind,
p303
aVnot able to provide them with food,
p304
aVnot able to provide them with vitamin A.
p305
aVBut this has come as a great boon for them.
p306
aVThere are no patents. Anyone can make it.
p307
aa(lp308
VThis is very, very simple.
p309
aVYou can see, this is the generator. It's a crank generator.
p310
aVThese are two magnets.
p311
aVThis is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs.
p312
aVSmall pulley and two strong magnets.
p313
aVAnd this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.
p314
aVIf I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster.
p315
aVThere will be a spinning magnetic field.
p316
aVLines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.
p317
aVAnd you can see, this LED is going to glow.
p318
aVSo this is a small crank generator.
p319
aa(lp320
VWell, this is, again,
p321
aVit's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts.
p322
aVAnd what you can do
p323
aVis just, if you give it a twirl,
p324
aVwell they just keep going on.
p325
aVAnd imagine a bunch of kids
p326
aVstanding in a circle
p327
aVand just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on.
p328
aVAnd they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this.
p329
aa(lp330
VWell in the end, what we can also do:
p331
aVwe use a lot of old newspapers
p332
aVto make caps.
p333
aVThis is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.
p334
aVIt's a great cricket cap. (Laughter) (Applause)
p335
aVWhen first you see Nehru and Gandhi,
p336
aVthis is the Nehru cap \u2014 just half a newspaper.
p337
aVWe make lots of toys with newspapers,
p338
aVand this is one of them.
p339
aVAnd this is \u2014 you can see \u2014
p340
aVthis is a flapping bird.
p341
aVAll of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.
p342
aVAnd if you have one of these birds \u2014
p343
aVchildren in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.
p344
aVAnd you can see,
p345
aVthis is a little fantail bird.
p346
aa(lp347
VWell in the end, I'll just end with a story.
p348
aVThis is called "The Captain's Hat Story."
p349
aVThe captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.
p350
aVIt goes very slowly.
p351
aVAnd there were lots of passengers on the ship,
p352
aVand they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.
p353
aV"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance,
p354
aVand I'll provide you with good food and drinks."
p355
aVAnd the captain would wear a cap everyday
p356
aVand join in the regalia.
p357
aVThe first day, it was a huge umbrella cap,
p358
aVlike a captain's cap.
p359
aVThat night, when the passengers would be sleeping,
p360
aVhe would give it one more fold,
p361
aVand the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap \u2014
p362
aVwith a little shoot just like a designer cap,
p363
aVbecause it protects the spinal cord.
p364
aVAnd the second night, he would take the same cap
p365
aVand give it another fold.
p366
aVAnd the third day, it would be a Shikari cap \u2014
p367
aVjust like an adventurer's cap.
p368
aVAnd the third night, he would give it two more folds \u2014
p369
aVand this is a very, very famous cap.
p370
aVIf you've seen any of our Bollywood films,
p371
aVthis is what the policeman wears,
p372
aVit's called a zapalu cap.
p373
aVIt's been catapulted to international glory.
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.
p376
aVSo that's a ship.
p377
aVAnd now the end:
p378
aVeveryone was enjoying the journey very much.
p379
aVThey were singing and dancing.
p380
aVSuddenly there was a storm and huge waves.
p381
aVAnd all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.
p382
aVA huge wave comes and slaps the front
p383
aVand knocks it down.
p384
aVAnd another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.
p385
aVAnd there's a third one over here.
p386
aVThis swallows the bridge and knocks it down.
p387
aVAnd the ship sinks,
p388
aVand the captain has lost everything,
p389
aVbut for a life jacket.
p390
aa(lp391
VThank you so much.
p392

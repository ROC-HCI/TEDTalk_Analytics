VI've spent my life working on sustainability.
p5
aVI set up a climate change NGO
p6
aVcalled The Climate Group.
p7
aVI worked on forestry issues in WWF.
p8
aVI worked on development and agriculture issues
p9
aVin the U.N. system.
p10
aVAbout 25 years in total,
p11
aVand then three years ago, I found myself talking to
p12
aVIKEA's CEO about joining his team.
p13
aVLike many people here, well,
p14
aVI want to maximize my personal impact in the world,
p15
aVso I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut first, let's just take three numbers.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe first number is three:
p20
aVthree billion people.
p21
aVThis is the number of people joining
p22
aVthe global middle class by 2030,
p23
aVcoming out of poverty.
p24
aVIt's fantastic for them and their families,
p25
aVbut we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,
p26
aVand this swells that number to five,
p27
aVa big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe second number is six:
p30
aVThis is six degrees centigrade,
p31
aVwhat we're heading towards in terms of global warming.
p32
aVWe're not heading towards one degree or three degrees
p33
aVor four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.
p34
aVAnd if you think about it, all of the weird weather
p35
aVwe've been having the last few years,
p36
aVmuch of that is due to just one degree warming,
p37
aVand we need CO2 emissions to peak
p38
aVby the end of this decade globally
p39
aVand then come down.
p40
aVIt's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe third number is 12:
p43
aVThat's the number of cities in the world
p44
aVthat had a million or more people
p45
aVwhen my grandmother was born.
p46
aVYou can see my grandmother there.
p47
aVThat was in the beginning of the last century.
p48
aVSo just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,
p49
aVthe ninth largest city in the world.
p50
aVNow there are 500 cities, nearly,
p51
aVwith a million people or more in them.
p52
aVAnd if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,
p53
aVthat's the century when we build all the world's cities,
p54
aVthe century that we're in the middle of right now.
p55
aVEvery other century was kind of practice,
p56
aVand this lays down a blueprint for how we live.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo think about it.
p59
aVWe're building cities like never before,
p60
aVbringing people out of poverty like never before,
p61
aVand changing the climate like never before.
p62
aVSustainability has gone from a nice-to-do
p63
aVto a must-do.
p64
aVit's about what we do right here, right now,
p65
aVand for the rest of our working lives.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I'm going to talk a little bit about
p68
aVwhat business can do
p69
aVand what a business like IKEA can do,
p70
aVand we have a sustainability strategy
p71
aVcalled "people and planet positive"
p72
aVto help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.
p73
aVWhy would we not want to have a positive impact
p74
aVon the world as a business?
p75
aVOther companies have sustainability strategies.
p76
aVI'm going to refer to some of those as well,
p77
aVand I'm just going to mention a few
p78
aVof the commitments as illustrations that we've got.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut first, let's think of customers.
p81
aVWe know from asking people from China to the U.S.
p82
aVthat the vast majority of people care about sustainability
p83
aVafter the day-to-day issues,
p84
aVthe day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?
p85
aVCan I pay the bills at the end of the month?
p86
aVThen they care about big issues like climate change.
p87
aVBut they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,
p88
aVand they expect business to help,
p89
aVand they're a little bit disappointed today.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo take your mind back and think
p92
aVof the first sustainable products.
p93
aVWe had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.
p94
aVWe had the early energy-efficient light bulbs
p95
aVthat took five minutes to warm up
p96
aVand then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.
p97
aVAnd we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.
p98
aVSo every time you pulled on a t-shirt,
p99
aVor switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,
p100
aVor sometimes all three together,
p101
aVyou were reminded sustainability was about compromise.
p102
aVIt wasn't a great start.
p103
aa(lp104
VToday we have choices.
p105
aVWe can make products that are beautiful or ugly,
p106
aVsustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,
p107
aVfunctional or useless.
p108
aVSo let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,
p109
aVsustainable products.
p110
aa(lp111
VLet's take the LED.
p112
aVThe LED is the next best thing to daylight.
p113
aVThe old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs \u2014
p114
aVI'm not going to ask for a show of hands
p115
aVof how many of you still have them in your homes,
p116
aVwasting energy every time you switch them on \u2014
p117
aVchange them after this \u2014
p118
aVor whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not \u2014
p119
aVbut those old incandescent light bulbs
p120
aVreally should have been sold as heaters.
p121
aVThey were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.
p122
aVThey produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.
p123
aVNow we have lights that produce light
p124
aVand a little bit of heat on the side.
p125
aVYou save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED
p126
aVthat you would have done in an old incandescent.
p127
aVAnd the best thing is, they'll also last
p128
aVfor more than 20 years.
p129
aVSo think about that.
p130
aVYou'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,
p131
aVprobably more if you're in this audience.
p132
aVYou'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.
p133
aVYour kids could go to school, go to college,
p134
aVgo away and have kids of their own, come back,
p135
aVbring the grandkids,
p136
aVyou'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.
p137
aVSo LEDs are fantastic.
p138
aVWhat we decided to do
p139
aVwas not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high
p140
aVand continue to push all the old bulbs,
p141
aVthe halogens and the CFLs.
p142
aVWe decided, over the next two years,
p143
aVwe will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.
p144
aVWe will go all in.
p145
aVAnd this is what business needs to do: go all-in,
p146
aVgo 100 percent,
p147
aVbecause then you stop investing in the old stuff,
p148
aVyou invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,
p149
aVyou use your supply chain and your creativity
p150
aVand you get the prices down so everybody can afford
p151
aVthe best lights so they can save energy.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Applause)
p154
aa(lp155
VIt's not just about products in people's homes.
p156
aVWe've got to think about the raw materials
p157
aVthat produce our products.
p158
aVObviously there's fantastic opportunities
p159
aVwith recycled materials,
p160
aVand we can and will go zero waste.
p161
aVAnd there's opportunities in a circular economy.
p162
aVBut we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.
p163
aVLet's take cotton.
p164
aVCotton's brilliant. Probably many people
p165
aVare wearing cotton right now.
p166
aVIt's a brilliant textile in use.
p167
aVIt's really dirty in production.
p168
aVIt uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.
p169
aVSo we've worked with others,
p170
aVwith other businesses and NGOs,
p171
aVon the Better Cotton Initiative,
p172
aVworking right back down to the farm,
p173
aVand there you can halve the amount of water
p174
aVand halve the chemical inputs,
p175
aVthe yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs
p176
aVof running many of these farms
p177
aVwith farmers with low incomes
p178
aVcan be chemical imports.
p179
aVYields increase, and you halve the input costs.
p180
aVFarmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.
p181
aVAlready hundreds of thousands of farmers
p182
aVhave been reached,
p183
aVand now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.
p184
aVAgain, we're going all-in.
p185
aVBy 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.
p186
aa(lp187
VTake the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.
p188
aVPeople sometimes think that
p189
aV100 percent's going to be hard,
p190
aVand we've had the conversation in the business.
p191
aVActually, we found 100 percent is easier to do
p192
aVthan 90 percent or 50 percent.
p193
aVIf you have a 90 percent target,
p194
aVeveryone in the business finds a reason
p195
aVto be in the 10 percent.
p196
aVWhen it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,
p197
aVand businesspeople like clarity,
p198
aVbecause then you just get the job done.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.
p201
aVYou've got illegal logging
p202
aVand deforestation still on a very large scale,
p203
aVor you can have fantastic, responsible forestry
p204
aVthat we can be proud of.
p205
aVIt's a simple choice, so we've worked
p206
aVfor many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,
p207
aVwith literally hundreds of other organizations,
p208
aVand there's a point here about collaboration.
p209
aVSo hundreds of others, of NGOs,
p210
aVof forest workers' unions, and of businesses,
p211
aVhave helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,
p212
aVwhich sets standards for forestry
p213
aVand then checks the forestry's good on the ground.
p214
aVNow together, through our supply chain,
p215
aVwith partners, we've managed to certify
p216
aV35 million hectares of forestry.
p217
aVThat's about the size of Germany.
p218
aVAnd we've decided in the next three years,
p219
aVwe will double the volume of certified material
p220
aVwe put through our business.
p221
aVSo be decisive on these issues.
p222
aVUse your supply chain to drive good.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut then it comes to your operations.
p225
aVSome things are certain, I think.
p226
aVWe know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.
p227
aVWe know the sun will be shining somewhere,
p228
aVand the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.
p229
aVSo why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?
p230
aVAnd why not take control of it ourselves?
p231
aVSo we're going 100 percent renewable.
p232
aVBy 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy
p233
aVthan the energy we consume as a business.
p234
aVFor all of our stores, our own factories,
p235
aVour distribution centers,
p236
aVwe've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,
p237
aVand we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate
p238
aVin six countries, and we're not done yet.
p239
aVBut think of a solar panel.
p240
aVA solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.
p241
aVThe electricity is free.
p242
aVEvery time the sun comes out after that,
p243
aVthe electricity is free.
p244
aVSo this is a good thing for the CFO,
p245
aVnot just the sustainability guy.
p246
aVEvery business can do things like this.
p247
aa(lp248
VBut then we've got to look beyond our operations,
p249
aVand I think everybody would agree
p250
aVthat now business has to take full responsibility
p251
aVfor the impacts of your supply chain.
p252
aVMany businesses now, fortunately,
p253
aVhave codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,
p254
aVbut not every business. Far from it.
p255
aVAnd this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.
p256
aVWe found there was a risk
p257
aVof child labor in the supply chain,
p258
aVand people in the business were shocked.
p259
aVAnd it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.
p260
aVSo a code of conduct was developed,
p261
aVand now we have 80 auditors out in the world
p262
aVevery day making sure all our factories
p263
aVsecure good working conditions
p264
aVand protect human rights
p265
aVand make sure there is no child labor.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut it's not just as simple as making sure
p268
aVthere's no child labor.
p269
aVYou've got to say that's not enough today.
p270
aVI think we'd all agree that children
p271
aVare the most important people in the world
p272
aVand the most vulnerable.
p273
aVSo what can a business do today
p274
aVto actually use your total value chain
p275
aVto support a better quality of life
p276
aVand protect child rights?
p277
aVWe've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children
p278
aVon developing some new business principles
p279
aVwith children's rights.
p280
aVIncreasing numbers of businesses
p281
aVare signing up to these,
p282
aVbut actually in a survey, many business leaders
p283
aVsaid they thought their business had nothing to do with children.
p284
aVSo what we decided to do was, we will look
p285
aVand ask ourselves the tough questions
p286
aVwith partners who know more than us,
p287
aVwhat can we do to go beyond our business
p288
aVto help improve the lives of children?
p289
aVWe also have a foundation
p290
aVthat's committed to work through partners
p291
aVand help improve the lives and protect the rights
p292
aVof 100 million children by 2015.
p293
aa(lp294
VYou know the phrase,
p295
aVyou can manage what you measure?
p296
aVWell, you should measure what you care about.
p297
aVIf you're not measuring things,
p298
aVyou don't care and you don't know.
p299
aVSo let's take an example, measure the things
p300
aVthat are important in your business.
p301
aVIsn't it about time that businesses
p302
aVwere led equally by men and women?
p303
aa(lp304
V(Applause)
p305
aa(lp306
VSo we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA
p307
aVthat 47 percent are women today,
p308
aVbut it's not enough, and we want to close the gap
p309
aVand follow it all the way through to senior management.
p310
aVAnd we do not want to wait another hundred years.
p311
aVSo we've launched a women's open network
p312
aVthis week in IKEA,
p313
aVand we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.
p314
aVSo the message here is,
p315
aVmeasure what you care about and lead the change,
p316
aVand don't wait a hundred years.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo we've gone from sustainability
p319
aVbeing a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.
p320
aVIt's still nice to do, but it's a must-do.
p321
aVAnd everybody can do something on this as an individual.
p322
aVBe a discerning consumer.
p323
aVVote with your wallets.
p324
aVSearch out the companies
p325
aVthat are acting on this.
p326
aVBut also, there are other businesses already acting.
p327
aVI mentioned renewable energy.
p328
aVYou go to Google or Lego,
p329
aVthey're going 100 percent renewable too,
p330
aVin the same way that we are.
p331
aVOn having really good sustainability strategies,
p332
aVthere are companies like Nike, Patagonia,
p333
aVTimberland, Marks & Spencer.
p334
aVBut I don't think any of those businesses would say
p335
aVthey're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.
p336
aVWe'll make mistakes going forward,
p337
aVbut it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent,
p338
aVhaving a dialogue with the right partners,
p339
aVand choosing to lead on the issues that really count.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo if you're a business leader,
p342
aVif you're not already weaving sustainability
p343
aVright into the heart of your business model,
p344
aVI'd urge you to do so.
p345
aVAnd together, we can help create
p346
aVa sustainable world,
p347
aVand, if we get it right,
p348
aVwe can make sustainability
p349
aVaffordable for the many people,
p350
aVnot a luxury for the few.
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you.

Steve Howard, the chief sustainability officer, is charged with making that supply chain, and the company&#39;s 298 stores and almost 3,000 products, live more lightly upon the earth.<br />&nbsp;<br />Coming to Ikea from the nonprofit consultancy Climate Group, Howard has embraced the challenge of working with a single big company, and the improvements he&#39;s made so far include helping farmers grow more-sustainable cotton around the world, remaking classic products to use fewer parts, and investing &euro;1.5 billion through 2015 in renewable energy sources, notably wind and solar.

And if you&#39;ve been to an Ikea lately, you probably already know this, through signs and explainers posted all over the store.

an Ikea store in 2012; the company sold &euro;27 billion worth of low-priced sofas, lamps, bookshelves and other goods (including &euro;1.3 billion just in food) from more than 1,000 suppliers. Steve Howard, the chief sustainability officer, is charged with making that supply chain, and the company&#39;s 298 stores and almost 3,000 products, live more lightly upon the earth.<br />&nbsp;<br />Coming to Ikea from the nonprofit consultancy Climate Group, Howard has embraced the challenge of working with a single big company, and the improvements he&#39;s made so far include helping farmers grow more-sustainable cotton around the world, remaking classic products to use fewer parts, and investing &euro;1.5 billion through 2015 in renewable energy sources, notably wind and solar. (Like the rollout in the UK of <a href=\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carol-pierson-holding/sun-shines-on-ikeas-uk_b_4079850.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Ikea solar panel systems</a>  for the home.) And if you&#39;ve been to an Ikea lately, you probably already know this, through signs and explainers posted all over the store. Telling the story of sustainability is key, Howard believes, as companies like his become agents of transformative change.

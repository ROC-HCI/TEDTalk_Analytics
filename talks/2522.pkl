VI've been living in rural East Africa for about 10 years,
p5
aVand I want to share a field perspective with you on global poverty.
p6
aVI believe that the greatest failure of the human race
p7
aVis the fact that we've left more than one billion of our members behind.
p8
aVHungry, extreme poverty:
p9
aVthese often seem like gigantic, insurmountable problems,
p10
aVtoo big to solve.
p11
aVBut as a field practitioner,
p12
aVI believe these are actually very solvable problems
p13
aVif we just take the right strategies.
p14
aa(lp15
VArchimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,
p16
aVand he taught us that if we lean on the right levers,
p17
aVwe can move the world.
p18
aVIn the fight against extreme poverty, I believe there are three powerful levers
p19
aVthat we can lean on.
p20
aVThis talk is all about those levers, and why they make poverty
p21
aVa winnable fight in our lifetimes.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhat is extreme poverty?
p24
aVWhen I first moved to rural East Africa,
p25
aVI stayed overnight with a farm family.
p26
aVThey were wonderful people.
p27
aVThey invited me into their home. We sang songs together
p28
aVand ate a simple dinner.
p29
aVThey gave me a blanket to sleep on the floor.
p30
aVIn the morning, however, there was nothing to eat.
p31
aVAnd then at lunchtime, I watched with an increasingly sick feeling
p32
aVas the eldest girl in the family cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.
p33
aVFor that meal, every child drank one cup to survive.
p34
aVAnd I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt
p35
aVwhen they handed one of those cups to me,
p36
aVand I knew I had to accept their hospitality.
p37
aa(lp38
VChildren need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally.
p39
aVEvery day they fail to eat, they lose a little bit of their future.
p40
aVAmongst the extreme poor, one in three children
p41
aVare permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough.
p42
aVWhen that's combined with poor access to health care,
p43
aVone in 10 extremely poor children die before they reach age five.
p44
aVAnd only one quarter of children complete high school
p45
aVbecause they lack school fees.
p46
aVHunger and extreme poverty curb human potential in every possible way.
p47
aVWe see ourselves as a thinking, feeling and moral human race,
p48
aVbut until we solve these problems for all of our members,
p49
aVwe fail that standard,
p50
aVbecause every person on this planet matters.
p51
aVThis child matters.
p52
aVThese children matter.
p53
aVThis girl matters.
p54
aa(lp55
VYou know, we see things like this,
p56
aVand we're upset by them,
p57
aVbut they seem like such big problems.
p58
aVWe don't know how to take effective action.
p59
aVBut remember our friend Archimedes.
p60
aVGlobal poverty has powerful levers.
p61
aVIt's a problem like any other.
p62
aVI live and work in the field, and as a practitioner,
p63
aVI believe these are very solvable problems.
p64
aVSo for the next 10 minutes,
p65
aVlet's not be sad about the state of the world.
p66
aVLet's engage our brains.
p67
aVLet's engage our collective passion for problem-solving
p68
aVand figure out what those levers are.
p69
aa(lp70
VLever number one: most of the world's poor are farmers.
p71
aVThink about how extraordinary this is.
p72
aVIf this picture represents the world's poor,
p73
aVthen more than half engage in farming as a major source of income.
p74
aVThis gets me really excited.
p75
aVAll of these people, one profession.
p76
aVThink how powerful this is.
p77
aVWhen farmers become more productive, then more than half the world's poor
p78
aVearn more money and climb out of poverty.
p79
aVAnd it gets better.
p80
aVThe product of farming is, of course, food.
p81
aVSo when farmers become more productive, they earn more food,
p82
aVand they don't just help themselves,
p83
aVbut they help to feed healthy communities and thriving economies.
p84
aVAnd when farmers become more productive, they reduce environmental pressure.
p85
aVWe only have two ways we can feed the world:
p86
aVwe can either make our existing farmland a lot more productive,
p87
aVor we can clear cut forest and savannah to make more farmland,
p88
aVwhich would be environmentally disastrous.
p89
aVFarmers are basically a really important leverage point.
p90
aVWhen farmers become more productive,
p91
aVthey earn more income, they climb out of poverty,
p92
aVthey feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure.
p93
aVFarmers stand at the center of the world.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd not a farmer like this one,
p96
aVbut rather this lady.
p97
aVMost of the farmers I know are actually women.
p98
aVLook at the strength and the will radiating from this woman.
p99
aVShe is physically strong, mentally tough,
p100
aVand she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children.
p101
aVIf we're going to put the future of humanity in one person's hands,
p102
aVthen I'm really glad it's her.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Applause)
p105
aa(lp106
VThere's just one problem:
p107
aVmany smallholder farmers lack access to basic tools and knowledge.
p108
aVCurrently, they take a little bit of saved food grain from the prior year,
p109
aVthey plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe.
p110
aVThese are tools and techniques that date to the Bronze Age,
p111
aVand it's why many farmers are still very poor.
p112
aa(lp113
VBut good news, again.
p114
aVLever number two:
p115
aVhumanity actually solved the problem of agricultural poverty a century ago.
p116
aVLet me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming.
p117
aVFirst, hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together.
p118
aVIf you naturally pollinate a high-yielding variety
p119
aVtogether with a drought-resistant variety,
p120
aVyou get a hybrid that inherits positive traits from both of its parents.
p121
aVNext, conventional fertilizer, if used responsibly,
p122
aVis environmentally sustainable.
p123
aVIf you micro-dose just a pinch of fertilizer
p124
aVto a plant that's taller than I am,
p125
aVyou unlock enormous yield gain.
p126
aVThese are known as farm inputs.
p127
aVFarm inputs need to be combined with good practice.
p128
aVWhen you space your seeds and plant with massive amounts of compost,
p129
aVfarmers multiply their harvests.
p130
aVThese proven tools and practices have more than tripled
p131
aVagricultural productivity in every major region of the world,
p132
aVmoving mass numbers of people out of poverty.
p133
aVWe just haven't finished delivering these things to everybody just yet,
p134
aVparticularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo overall, this is amazing news.
p137
aVHumanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago,
p138
aVin theory.
p139
aVWe just haven't delivered these things to everybody just yet.
p140
aVIn this century, the reason that people remain poor
p141
aVis because maybe they live in remote places.
p142
aVThey lack access to these things.
p143
aVTherefore, ending poverty is simply a matter
p144
aVof delivering proven goods and services to people.
p145
aVWe don't need more genius types right now.
p146
aVThe humble delivery guy is going to end global poverty in our lifetime.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo these are the three levers,
p149
aVand the most powerful lever is simply delivery.
p150
aVWherever the world's companies, governments and nonprofits
p151
aVset up delivery networks for life-improving goods,
p152
aVwe eliminate poverty.
p153
aa(lp154
VOK, so that sounds really nice in theory,
p155
aVbut what about in practice?
p156
aVWhat do these delivery networks look like?
p157
aVI want to share the concrete example that I know best,
p158
aVmy organization, One Acre Fund.
p159
aVWe only serve the farmer,
p160
aVand our job is to provide her with the tools that she needs to succeed.
p161
aVWe start off by delivering farm inputs to really rural places.
p162
aVNow, this may appear initially very challenging,
p163
aVbut it's pretty possible. Let me show you.
p164
aVWe buy farm inputs with the combined power of our farmer network,
p165
aVand store it in 20 warehouses like this.
p166
aVThen, during input delivery, we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks
p167
aVand send them out to where farmers are waiting in the field.
p168
aVThey then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms.
p169
aVIt's kind of like Amazon for rural farmers.
p170
aVImportantly, realistic delivery also includes finance, a way to pay.
p171
aVFarmers pay us little by little over time, covering most of our expenses.
p172
aVAnd then we surround all that with training.
p173
aVOur rural field officers deliver practical, hands-on training
p174
aVto farmers in the field
p175
aVevery two weeks.
p176
aa(lp177
VWherever we deliver our services, farmers use these tools
p178
aVto climb out of poverty.
p179
aVThis is a farmer in our program, Consolata.
p180
aVLook at the pride on her face.
p181
aVShe has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right
p182
aVof every hardworking person on the planet.
p183
aVToday, I'm proud to say that we're serving about 400,000 farmers like Consolata.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VThe key to doing this is scalable delivery.
p188
aVIn any given area, we hire a rural field officer
p189
aVwho delivers our services to 200 farmers, on average,
p190
aVwith more than 1,000 people living in those families.
p191
aVToday, we have 2,000 of these rural field officers
p192
aVgrowing very quickly.
p193
aVThis is our delivery army,
p194
aVand we're just one organization.
p195
aVThere are many companies, governments and nonprofits
p196
aVthat have delivery armies just like this.
p197
aVAnd I believe we stand at a moment in time
p198
aVwhere collectively, we are capable of delivering farm services to all farmers.
p199
aa(lp200
VLet me show you how possible this is.
p201
aVThis is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,
p202
aVwith a map of the United States for scale.
p203
aVI chose Sub-Saharan Africa because this is a huge delivery territory.
p204
aVIt's very challenging.
p205
aVBut we analyzed every 50-mile by 50-mile block on the continent,
p206
aVand we found that half of farmers live in just these shaded regions.
p207
aVThat's a remarkably small area overall.
p208
aVIf you were to lay these boxes next to each other
p209
aVwithin a map of the United States,
p210
aVthey would only cover the Eastern United States.
p211
aVYou can order pizza anywhere in this territory
p212
aVand it'll arrive to your house hot, fresh and delicious.
p213
aVIf America can deliver pizza to an area of this size,
p214
aVthen Africa's companies, governments and non-profits
p215
aVcan deliver farm services to all of her farmers.
p216
aVThis is possible.
p217
aa(lp218
VI'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming.
p219
aVIn every field of human development,
p220
aVhumanity has already invented effective tools to end poverty.
p221
aVWe just need to deliver them.
p222
aVSo again, in every area of human development,
p223
aVsuper-smart people a long time ago invented inexpensive,
p224
aVhighly effective tools.
p225
aVHumanity is armed to the teeth
p226
aVwith simple, effective solutions to poverty.
p227
aVWe just need to deliver these to a pretty small area.
p228
aVAgain using the map of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,
p229
aVremember that rural poverty is concentrated in these blue shaded areas.
p230
aVUrban poverty is even more concentrated, in these green little dots.
p231
aVAgain, using a map of the United States for scale,
p232
aVthis is what I would call a highly achievable delivery zone.
p233
aVIn fact, for the first time in human history,
p234
aVwe have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us.
p235
aVThe world's companies, governments and non-profits
p236
aVhave delivery armies that are fully capable
p237
aVof covering this relatively small area.
p238
aVWe just lack the will.
p239
aa(lp240
VIf we are willing,
p241
aVevery one of us has a role to play.
p242
aVWe first need more people to pursue careers in human development,
p243
aVespecially if you live in a developing nation.
p244
aVWe need more front line health workers, teachers, farmer trainers,
p245
aVsales agents for life-improving goods.
p246
aVThese are the delivery people that dedicate their careers
p247
aVto improving the lives of others.
p248
aVBut we also need a lot of support roles.
p249
aVThese are roles available at just my organization alone,
p250
aVand we're just one out of many.
p251
aVThis may surprise you, but no matter what your technical specialty,
p252
aVthere is a role for you in this fight.
p253
aVAnd no matter how logistically possible it is to end poverty,
p254
aVwe need a lot more resources.
p255
aVThis is our number one constraint.
p256
aVFor private investors, we need a big expansion of venture capital,
p257
aVprivate equity, working capital, available in emerging markets.
p258
aVBut there are also limits to what private business can accomplish.
p259
aVPrivate businesses often struggle to profitably serve the extreme poor,
p260
aVso philanthropy still has a major role to play.
p261
aVAnybody can give, but we need more leadership.
p262
aVWe need more visionary philanthropists
p263
aVand global leaders who will take problems in human development
p264
aVand lead humanity to wipe them off the face of the planet.
p265
aVIf you're interested in these ideas, check out this website.
p266
aa(lp267
VWe need more leaders.
p268
aVHumanity has put people on the moon.
p269
aVWe've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets
p270
aVand connect us with anybody on the planet.
p271
aVWe've run marathons at a five-minute mile pace.
p272
aVWe are an exceptional people.
p273
aVBut we've left more than one billion of our members behind.
p274
aVUntil every girl like this one has an opportunity
p275
aVto earn her full human potential,
p276
aVwe have failed to become a truly moral and just human race.
p277
aVLogistically speaking, it's incredibly possible
p278
aVto end extreme poverty.
p279
aVWe just need to deliver proven goods and services
p280
aVto everybody.
p281
aVIf we have the will, every one of us has a role to play.
p282
aVLet's deploy our time, our careers,
p283
aVour collective wealth.
p284
aVLet us deliver an end to extreme poverty
p285
aVin this lifetime.
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you.

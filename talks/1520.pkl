VDoc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity
p5
aVwith this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple,
p6
aVand exposure just a millionth of a second.
p7
aVBut now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster
p8
aVand see the world not at a million or a billion,
p9
aVbut one trillion frames per second.
p10
aa(lp11
VI present to you a new type of photography,
p12
aVfemto-photography,
p13
aVa new imaging technique so fast
p14
aVthat it can create slow motion videos of light in motion.
p15
aVAnd with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners,
p16
aVbeyond line of sight,
p17
aVor see inside our body without an x-ray,
p18
aVand really challenge what we mean by a camera.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off
p21
aVin one trillionth of a second \u2014
p22
aVwhich is several femtoseconds \u2014
p23
aVI'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide.
p24
aVAnd that packet of photons, that bullet,
p25
aVwill travel at the speed of light,
p26
aVand again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet.
p27
aVNow, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons
p28
aVand fire into this bottle,
p29
aVhow will those photons shatter into this bottle?
p30
aVHow does light look in slow motion?
p31
aa(lp32
V[Light in Slow Motion ... 10 Billion x Slow]
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, the whole event \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
V(Applause)
p37
aa(lp38
VNow remember, the whole event is effectively taking place
p39
aVin less than a nanosecond \u2014
p40
aVthat's how much time it takes for light to travel.
p41
aVBut I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion,
p42
aVso you can see the light in motion.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VBut Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, there's a lot going on in this movie,
p51
aVso let me break this down and show you what's going on.
p52
aVSo the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet,
p53
aVwith a packet of photons that start traveling through
p54
aVand that start scattering inside.
p55
aVSome of the light leaks, goes on the table,
p56
aVand you start seeing these ripples of waves.
p57
aVMany of the photons eventually reach the cap
p58
aVand then they explode in various directions.
p59
aVAs you can see, there's a bubble of air
p60
aVand it's bouncing around inside.
p61
aVMeanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table,
p62
aVand because of the reflections at the top,
p63
aVyou see at the back of the bottle, after several frames,
p64
aVthe reflections are focused.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, if you take an ordinary bullet
p67
aVand let it go the same distance and slow down the video \u2014
p68
aVagain, by a factor of 10 billion \u2014
p69
aVdo you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie?
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VA day, a week? Actually, a whole year.
p74
aVIt'll be a very boring movie \u2014
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
Vof a slow, ordinary bullet in motion.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd what about some still-life photography?
p81
aVYou can watch the ripples, again, washing over the table,
p82
aVthe tomato and the wall in the back.
p83
aVIt's like throwing a stone in a pond of water.
p84
aa(lp85
VI thought: this is how nature paints a photo,
p86
aVone femto frame at a time,
p87
aVbut of course our eye sees an integral composite.
p88
aVBut if you look at this tomato one more time,
p89
aVyou will notice, as the light washes over the tomato,
p90
aVit continues to glow.
p91
aVIt doesn't become dark. Why is that?
p92
aVBecause the tomato is actually ripe,
p93
aVand the light is bouncing around inside the tomato,
p94
aVand it comes out after several trillionths of a second.
p95
aVSo in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone,
p96
aVyou might be able to go to a supermarket
p97
aVand check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VSo how did my team at MIT create this camera?
p102
aVNow, as photographers, you know,
p103
aVif you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light.
p104
aVBut we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure,
p105
aVso you're going to get hardly any light.
p106
aVSo what we do is we send that bullet \u2014
p107
aVthat packet of photons \u2014 millions of times,
p108
aVand record again and again with very clever synchronization,
p109
aVand from the gigabytes of data,
p110
aVwe computationally weave together
p111
aVto create those femto-videos I showed you.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways.
p114
aVSo, Superman can fly.
p115
aVSome other heroes can become invisible.
p116
aVBut what about a new power for a future superhero:
p117
aVTo see around corners.
p118
aVThe idea is that we could shine some light on the door,
p119
aVit's going to bounce, go inside the room,
p120
aVsome of that is going to reflect back on the door,
p121
aVand then back to the camera.
p122
aVAnd we could exploit these multiple bounces of light.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd it's not science fiction. We have actually built it.
p125
aVOn the left, you see our femto-camera.
p126
aVThere's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,
p127
aVand we're going to bounce light off the door.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo after our paper was published in Nature Communications,
p130
aVit was highlighted by Nature.com,
p131
aVand they created this animation.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Music)
p134
aa(lp135
V[A laser pulse is fired]
p136
aa(lp137
V(Music)
p138
aa(lp139
VRamesh Raskar: We're going to fire those bullets of light,
p140
aVand they're going to hit this wall,
p141
aVand because of the packet of the photons,
p142
aVthey will scatter in all the directions,
p143
aVand some of them will reach our hidden mannequin,
p144
aVwhich in turn will again scatter that light,
p145
aVand again in turn, the door will reflect some of that scattered light.
p146
aVAnd a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera,
p147
aVbut most interestingly,
p148
aVthey will all arrive at a slightly different time slot.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Music)
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd because we have a camera that can run so fast \u2014
p153
aVour femto-camera \u2014 it has some unique abilities.
p154
aVIt has very good time resolution,
p155
aVand it can look at the world at the speed of light.
p156
aVAnd this way, we know the distances, of course to the door,
p157
aVbut also to the hidden objects,
p158
aVbut we don't know which point corresponds to which distance.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Music)
p161
aa(lp162
VBy shining one laser, we can record one raw photo,
p163
aVwhich, if you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense.
p164
aVBut then we will take a lot of such pictures,
p165
aVdozens of such pictures, put them together,
p166
aVand try to analyze the multiple bounces of light,
p167
aVand from that, can we see the hidden object?
p168
aVCan we see it in full 3D?
p169
aa(lp170
VSo this is our reconstruction.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Music)
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VNow, we have some ways to go
p177
aVbefore we take this outside the lab on the road,
p178
aVbut in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions
p179
aVwith what's around the bend.
p180
aVOr we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions
p181
aVby looking at light reflected through open windows.
p182
aVOr we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders,
p183
aVand also for cardioscopes.
p184
aVBut of course, because of tissue and blood,
p185
aVthis is quite challenging,
p186
aVso this is really a call for scientists
p187
aVto start thinking about femto-photography
p188
aVas really a new imaging modality
p189
aVto solve the next generation of health-imaging problems.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself,
p192
aVscience became art \u2014
p193
aVan art of ultra-fast photography.
p194
aVAnd I realized
p195
aVthat all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time,
p196
aVare not just for scientific imaging.
p197
aVBut we can also do a new form of computational photography,
p198
aVwith time-lapse and color coding.
p199
aVAnd we look at those ripples.
p200
aVRemember:
p201
aVThe time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut there's also something funny going on here.
p204
aVWhen you look at the ripples under the cap,
p205
aVthe ripples are moving away from us.
p206
aVThe ripples should be moving towards us.
p207
aVWhat's going on here?
p208
aa(lp209
VIt turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light,
p210
aVwe have strange effects,
p211
aVand Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VThe order at which events take place in the world
p216
aVappears in the camera sometimes in reversed order.
p217
aVSo by applying the corresponding space and time warp,
p218
aVwe can correct for this distortion.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo whether it's for photography around corners,
p221
aVor creating the next generation of health imaging,
p222
aVor creating new visualizations,
p223
aVsince our invention,
p224
aVwe have open-sourced all the data and details on our website,
p225
aVand our hope is that the DIY, the creative and the research communities
p226
aVwill show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras \u2014
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
Vand start focusing on the next dimension in imaging.
p231
aVIt's about time.
p232
aa(lp233
VThank you.

Edgerton, pioneer of stop-action photography, famously took a photo of a bullet piercing an apple using exposures as short as a few nanoseconds. Inspired by his work, Ramesh Raskar and his team set out to create a camera that could capture not just a bullet (traveling at 850 meters per second) but light itself (nearly 300 million meters per second).</p>  <p>Stop a moment to take that in: photographing light as it moves. For that, they built a camera and software that can visualize pictures as if they are recorded at 1 trillion frames per second. The same photon-imaging technology can also be used to create <a href=\\"http://cornar.info\\" target=\\"_blank\\">a camera that can peer &quot;around&quot; corners</a> , by exploiting specific properties of the photons when they bounce off surfaces and objects.</p>  <p>Among the other projects that Raskar is leading, with the MIT Media Lab&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://cameraculture.media.mit.edu\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Camera Culture</a>&nbsp;research group, are low-cost eye care devices, a next generation CAT-Scan machine and human-computer interaction systems.</p><p>Papers:&nbsp;</p><p>Andreas Velten, Thomas Willwacher, Otkrist Gupta, Ashok Veeraraghavan, Moungi G.

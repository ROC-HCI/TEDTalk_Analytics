VI love to collect things.
p5
aVEver since I was a kid, I've had massive collections
p6
aVof random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces
p7
aVfrom all around the world to insects
p8
aVthat I've captured and put in jars.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, it's no secret, because I like collecting things,
p11
aVthat I love the Natural History Museum
p12
aVand the collections of animals
p13
aVat the Natural History Museum in dioramas.
p14
aVThese, to me, are like living sculptures, right,
p15
aVthat you can go and look at,
p16
aVand they memorialize a specific point of time
p17
aVin this animal's life.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo I was thinking about my own life,
p20
aVand how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know,
p21
aVfor the ages, and also \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p22
aVthe lives of my friends, but
p23
aVthe problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen
p24
aVon the idea of me taxidermy-ing them. (Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VSo instead, I turned to video,
p27
aVand video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize
p28
aVsomeone and to capture a specific moment in time.
p29
aVSo what I did was, I filmed six of my friends
p30
aVand then, using video mapping and video projection,
p31
aVI created a video sculpture, which was these six friends
p32
aVprojected into jars. (Laughter)
p33
aVSo now I have this collection of my friends
p34
aVI can take around with me whenever I go,
p35
aVand this is called Animalia Chordata,
p36
aVfrom the Latin nomenclature for
p37
aVhuman being, classification system.
p38
aVSo this piece memorializes my friends in these jars,
p39
aVand they actually move around. (Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VSo, this is interesting to me,
p42
aVbut it lacked a certain human element. (Laughter)
p43
aVIt's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add
p44
aVan interaction system. So what I did was,
p45
aVI added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close
p46
aVto the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.
p47
aVYou know, just like people on the street
p48
aVwhen you get too close to them.
p49
aVSome people reacted in terror. (Laughter)
p50
aVOthers reacted in asking you for help,
p51
aVand some people hide from you.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo this was really interesting to me, this idea of
p54
aVtaking video off the screen and putting it in real life,
p55
aVand also adding interactivity to sculpture.
p56
aVSo over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends
p57
aVand trapped them in jars as well
p58
aVand created a piece known as Garden,
p59
aVwhich is literally a garden of humanity.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut something about the first piece,
p62
aVthe Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me,
p63
aVthis idea of interaction with art,
p64
aVand I really liked the idea of people being able to interact,
p65
aVand also being challenged by interacting with art.
p66
aVSo I wanted to create a new piece that actually
p67
aVforced people to come and interact with something,
p68
aVand the way I did this was actually by projecting
p69
aVa 1950s housewife into a blender. (Laughter)
p70
aVThis is a piece called Blend, and what it does is
p71
aVit actually makes you implicit in the work of art.
p72
aVYou may never experience the entire thing yourself.
p73
aVYou can walk away, you can just watch as this character
p74
aVstands there in the blender and looks at you,
p75
aVor you can actually choose to interact with it.
p76
aVSo if you do choose to interact with the piece,
p77
aVand you press the blender button, it actually sends
p78
aVthis character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment.
p79
aVBy doing that, you are now part of my piece.
p80
aVYou, like the people that are trapped in my work
p81
aV\u2014 (Blender noises, laughter) \u2014
p82
aVhave become part of my work as well. (Laughter)
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aV(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VBut, but this seems a bit unfair, right?
p87
aVI put my friends in jars, I put this character,
p88
aVthis sort of endangered species character in a blender.
p89
aVBut I'd never done anything about myself.
p90
aVI'd never really memorialized myself.
p91
aVSo I decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece.
p92
aVThis is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece
p93
aVcalled A Point Just Passed,
p94
aVin which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock,
p95
aVand it's up to you.
p96
aVIf you want to choose to punch that punch card clock,
p97
aVyou actually age me.
p98
aVSo I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock,
p99
aVyou'll actually transform the baby into a toddler,
p100
aVand then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager.
p101
aVFrom a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self.
p102
aVFrom my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man,
p103
aVand then, from there, into an elderly man.
p104
aVAnd if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times
p105
aVin one day, the piece goes black
p106
aVand is not to be reset until the next day.
p107
aVSo, in doing so, you're erasing time.
p108
aVYou're actually implicit in this work
p109
aVand you're erasing my life.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I like this about interactive video sculpture,
p112
aVthat you can actually interact with it,
p113
aVthat all of you can actually touch an artwork
p114
aVand be part of the artwork yourselves,
p115
aVand hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you
p116
aVtrapped in one of my jars. (Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VThank you. (Applause)

His latest work is a DNA Vending Machine, which dispenses vials of DNA extracted from friends at dinner parties.

Call it &quot;artwork with consequences.&quot;</p><p>As he explains it: &quot;While formally implemented by natural history museums and collections  (which find their roots in Renaissance-era &#39;cabinets of curiosity&#39;),  this process has grown more pointed and pervasive in the modern-day  obsession with personal digital archiving and the corresponding growth  of social media culture. My video sculptures play upon this exigency in  our culture to chronicle, preserve and wax nostalgic, an idea which I  render visually by &#39;collecting&#39; human beings (alongside cultural  archetypes) as scientific specimens.

American artist who creates installation pieces that both delight and point to the strangeness of our modern, digital world. His latest work is a DNA Vending Machine, which dispenses vials of DNA extracted from friends at dinner parties. He&#39;s also created video installations of &quot;miniature people&quot; encased inside ordinary objects like suitcases,  blenders and more. His work comments on the act of leaving one&#39;s imprint for the next generation.  Call it &quot;artwork with consequences.&quot;</p><p>As he explains it: &quot;While formally implemented by natural history museums and collections  (which find their roots in Renaissance-era &#39;cabinets of curiosity&#39;),  this process has grown more pointed and pervasive in the modern-day  obsession with personal digital archiving and the corresponding growth  of social media culture. My video sculptures play upon this exigency in  our culture to chronicle, preserve and wax nostalgic, an idea which I  render visually by &#39;collecting&#39; human beings (alongside cultural  archetypes) as scientific specimens. I repurpose everyday objects like blenders, suitcases and cans of Spam  into venues for projecting and inserting videos of people.&quot; </p><p>Barcia-Colombo is an alumnus and instructor at NYU&#39;s <a href=\\"http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Interactive Telecommunications Program</a>.

VOn November 5th, 1990,
p5
aVa man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked
p6
aVinto a hotel in Manhattan
p7
aVand assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane,
p8
aVthe leader of the Jewish Defense League.
p9
aVNosair was initially found not guilty of the murder,
p10
aVbut while serving time on lesser charges,
p11
aVhe and other men began planning attacks
p12
aVon a dozen New York City landmarks,
p13
aVincluding tunnels, synagogues
p14
aVand the United Nations headquarters.
p15
aVThankfully, those plans were foiled
p16
aVby an FBI informant.
p17
aVSadly, the 1993 bombing
p18
aVof the World Trade Center was not.
p19
aVNosair would eventually be convicted
p20
aVfor his involvement in the plot.
p21
aVEl-Sayyid Nosair is my father.
p22
aa(lp23
VI was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
p24
aVin 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer,
p25
aVand a loving American mother and grade school teacher,
p26
aVwho together tried their best
p27
aVto create a happy childhood for me.
p28
aVIt wasn't until I was seven years old
p29
aVthat our family dynamic started to change.
p30
aVMy father exposed me to a side of Islam
p31
aVthat few people, including the majority of Muslims,
p32
aVget to see.
p33
aVIt's been my experience that when people
p34
aVtake the time to interact with one another,
p35
aVit doesn't take long to realize that for the most part,
p36
aVwe all want the same things out of life.
p37
aVHowever, in every religion, in every population,
p38
aVyou'll find a small percentage of people
p39
aVwho hold so fervently to their beliefs
p40
aVthat they feel they must use any means necessary
p41
aVto make others live as they do.
p42
aa(lp43
VA few months prior to his arrest,
p44
aVhe sat me down and explained that
p45
aVfor the past few weekends, he and some friends
p46
aVhad been going to a shooting range on Long Island
p47
aVfor target practice.
p48
aVHe told me I'd be going with him the next morning.
p49
aVWe arrived at Calverton Shooting Range,
p50
aVwhich unbeknownst to our group was being watched
p51
aVby the FBI.
p52
aVWhen it was my turn to shoot,
p53
aVmy father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder
p54
aVand explained how to aim at the target
p55
aVabout 30 yards off.
p56
aVThat day, the last bullet I shot
p57
aVhit the small orange light that sat on top of the target
p58
aVand to everyone's surprise, especially mine,
p59
aVthe entire target burst into flames.
p60
aVMy uncle turned to the other men,
p61
aVand in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh."
p62
aVLike father, like son.
p63
aVThey all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment,
p64
aVbut it wasn't until a few years later
p65
aVthat I fully understood what they thought was so funny.
p66
aVThey thought they saw in me the same destruction
p67
aVmy father was capable of.
p68
aVThose men would eventually be convicted
p69
aVof placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives
p70
aVinto the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower,
p71
aVcausing an explosion that killed six people
p72
aVand injured over 1,000 others.
p73
aVThese were the men I looked up to.
p74
aVThese were the men I called ammu, which means uncle.
p75
aa(lp76
VBy the time I turned 19,
p77
aVI had already moved 20 times in my life,
p78
aVand that instability during my childhood
p79
aVdidn't really provide an opportunity
p80
aVto make many friends.
p81
aVEach time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone,
p82
aVit was time to pack up and move to the next town.
p83
aVBeing the perpetual new face in class,
p84
aVI was frequently the target of bullies.
p85
aVI kept my identity a secret from my classmates
p86
aVto avoid being targeted,
p87
aVbut as it turns out, being the quiet, chubby new kid in class
p88
aVwas more than enough ammunition.
p89
aVSo for the most part, I spent my time at home
p90
aVreading books and watching TV
p91
aVor playing video games.
p92
aVFor those reasons, my social skills were lacking,
p93
aVto say the least,
p94
aVand growing up in a bigoted household,
p95
aVI wasn't prepared for the real world.
p96
aVI'd been raised to judge people
p97
aVbased on arbitrary measurements,
p98
aVlike a person's race or religion.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo what opened my eyes?
p101
aVOne of my first experiences
p102
aVthat challenged this way of thinking
p103
aVwas during the 2000 presidential elections.
p104
aVThrough a college prep program,
p105
aVI was able to take part
p106
aVin the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.
p107
aVMy particular group's focus was on youth violence,
p108
aVand having been the victim of bullying for most of my life,
p109
aVthis was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate.
p110
aVThe members of our group came from many different walks of life.
p111
aVOne day toward the end of the convention,
p112
aVI found out that one of the kids I had befriended
p113
aVwas Jewish.
p114
aVNow, it had taken several days
p115
aVfor this detail to come to light,
p116
aVand I realized that there was no natural animosity
p117
aVbetween the two of us.
p118
aVI had never had a Jewish friend before,
p119
aVand frankly I felt a sense of pride
p120
aVin having been able to overcome a barrier
p121
aVthat for most of my life I had been led to believe
p122
aVwas insurmountable.
p123
aVAnother major turning point came when
p124
aVI found a summer job at Busch Gardens,
p125
aVan amusement park.
p126
aVThere, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures,
p127
aVand that experience proved to be fundamental
p128
aVto the development of my character.
p129
aVMost of my life, I'd been taught
p130
aVthat homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,
p131
aVthat all gay people were a negative influence.
p132
aVAs chance would have it, I had the opportunity
p133
aVto work with some of the gay performers
p134
aVat a show there,
p135
aVand soon found that many were the kindest,
p136
aVleast judgmental people I had ever met.
p137
aVBeing bullied as a kid
p138
aVcreated a sense of empathy in me
p139
aVtoward the suffering of others,
p140
aVand it comes very unnaturally to me
p141
aVto treat people who are kind
p142
aVin any other way than how I would want to be treated.
p143
aVBecause of that feeling, I was able
p144
aVto contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child
p145
aVwith real life experience and interaction.
p146
aVI don't know what it's like to be gay,
p147
aVbut I'm well acquainted with being judged
p148
aVfor something that's beyond my control.
p149
aa(lp150
VThen there was "The Daily Show."
p151
aVOn a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me
p152
aVto be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry
p153
aVand helped me to realize that a person's race,
p154
aVreligion or sexual orientation
p155
aVhad nothing to do with the quality of one's character.
p156
aVHe was in many ways a father figure to me
p157
aVwhen I was in desperate need of one.
p158
aVInspiration can often come from an unexpected place,
p159
aVand the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more
p160
aVto positively influence my worldview
p161
aVthan my own extremist father
p162
aVis not lost on me.
p163
aa(lp164
VOne day, I had a conversation with my mother
p165
aVabout how my worldview was starting to change,
p166
aVand she said something to me
p167
aVthat I will hold dear to my heart
p168
aVfor as long as I live.
p169
aVShe looked at me with the weary eyes
p170
aVof someone who had experienced
p171
aVenough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,
p172
aV"I'm tired of hating people."
p173
aVIn that instant, I realized how much negative energy
p174
aVit takes to hold that hatred inside of you.
p175
aa(lp176
VZak Ebrahim is not my real name.
p177
aVI changed it when my family decided
p178
aVto end our connection with my father
p179
aVand start a new life.
p180
aVSo why would I out myself
p181
aVand potentially put myself in danger?
p182
aVWell, that's simple.
p183
aVI do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday
p184
aVwho is compelled to use violence
p185
aVmay hear my story and realize
p186
aVthat there is a better way,
p187
aVthat although I had been subjected
p188
aVto this violent, intolerant ideology,
p189
aVthat I did not become fanaticized.
p190
aVInstead, I choose to use my experience
p191
aVto fight back against terrorism,
p192
aVagainst the bigotry.
p193
aVI do it for the victims of terrorism
p194
aVand their loved ones,
p195
aVfor the terrible pain and loss
p196
aVthat terrorism has forced upon their lives.
p197
aVFor the victims of terrorism, I will speak out
p198
aVagainst these senseless acts
p199
aVand condemn my father's actions.
p200
aVAnd with that simple fact, I stand here as proof
p201
aVthat violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,
p202
aVand the son does not have to follow
p203
aVthe ways of his father.
p204
aVI am not my father.
p205
aa(lp206
VThank you. (Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VThank you, everybody. (Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VThank you all. (Applause)
p211
aa(lp212
VThanks a lot. (Applause)

family went on the run. His father, El Sayyid Nosair, had hoped Zak would follow in his footsteps -- and become a jihadist. Instead, Zak was at the beginning of a long journey to comprehend his past.<br /><br />Zak Ebrahim kept his family history a secret as they moved through a long succession of towns. In 2010, he realized his experience as a terrorist&rsquo;s son not only gave him a unique perspective, but also a unique chance to show that if he could escape a violent heritage, anyone could. As he told <a href=\\"http://www.truthdig.com/report/page2/wisdom_of_the_terrorists_son_20100920\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Truthdig.com</a>, &ldquo;We must embrace tolerance and nonviolence.

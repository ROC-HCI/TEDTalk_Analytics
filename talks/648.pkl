VI have a very difficult task.
p5
aVI'm a spectroscopist.
p6
aVI have to talk about astronomy without showing you
p7
aVany single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc.
p8
aVbecause my job is spectroscopy.
p9
aVI never deal with images.
p10
aVBut I'll try to convince you
p11
aVthat spectroscopy is actually something which can
p12
aVchange this world.
p13
aVSpectroscopy can probably answer the question,
p14
aV"Is there anybody out there?"
p15
aVAre we alone? SETI.
p16
aVIt's not very fun to do spectroscopy.
p17
aa(lp18
VOne of my colleagues in Bulgaria,
p19
aVNevena Markova, spent about 20 years
p20
aVstudying these profiles.
p21
aVAnd she published 42 articles
p22
aVjust dedicated to the subject.
p23
aVCan you imagine? Day and night, thinking,
p24
aVobserving, the same star for 20 years
p25
aVis incredible.
p26
aVBut we are crazy. We do these things.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd I'm not that far.
p30
aVI spent about eight months working on these profiles.
p31
aVBecause I've noticed
p32
aVa very small symmetry
p33
aVin the profile of one of the planet host stars.
p34
aVAnd I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star,
p35
aVwhich is an indication that this star
p36
aVhas swallowed a planet.
p37
aVBecause apparently you can't have this fragile isotope
p38
aVof Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.
p39
aVBut you have it in planets and asteroids.
p40
aVSo if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids,
p41
aVyou will have this Lithium-6 isotope
p42
aVin the spectrum of the star.
p43
aVSo I invested more than eight months
p44
aVjust studying the profile of this star.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd actually it's amazing,
p47
aVbecause I got phone calls from many reporters asking,
p48
aV"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?"
p49
aVBecause they thought that if you are having a telescope,
p50
aVyou are an astronomer so what you are doing
p51
aVis actually looking in a telescope.
p52
aVAnd you might have seen the planet going into a star.
p53
aVAnd I was saying, "No, excuse me.
p54
aVWhat I see is this one."
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVIt's just incredible. Because nobody understood really.
p57
aVI bet that there were very few people
p58
aVwho really understood what I'm talking about.
p59
aVBecause this is the indication that the planet went into the star.
p60
aVIt's amazing.
p61
aa(lp62
VThe power of spectroscopy
p63
aVwas actually realized
p64
aVby Pink Floyd already in 1973.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVBecause they actually said that
p67
aVyou can get any color you like
p68
aVin a spectrum.
p69
aVAnd all you need is time and money
p70
aVto make your spectrograph.
p71
aVThis is the number one high resolution,
p72
aVmost precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS,
p73
aVwhich is actually used to detect
p74
aVextrasolar planets and sound waves
p75
aVin the atmospheres of stars.
p76
aa(lp77
VHow we get spectra?
p78
aVI'm sure most of you know from school physics
p79
aVthat it's basically splitting a white light
p80
aVinto colors.
p81
aVAnd if you have a liquid hot mass,
p82
aVit will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum.
p83
aVA hot gas is producing emission lines only,
p84
aVno continuum.
p85
aVAnd if you place a cool gas in front of a
p86
aVhot source,
p87
aVyou will see certain patterns
p88
aVwhich we call absorption lines.
p89
aVWhich is used actually to identify chemical elements
p90
aVin a cool matter,
p91
aVwhich is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, what we can do with the spectra?
p94
aVWe can actually study line-of-sight velocities
p95
aVof cosmic objects.
p96
aVAnd we can also study chemical composition
p97
aVand physical parameters of stars,
p98
aVgalaxies, nebulae.
p99
aVA star is the most simple object.
p100
aVIn the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on,
p101
aVcreating chemical elements.
p102
aVAnd we have a cool atmosphere.
p103
aVIt's cool for me.
p104
aVCool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees.
p105
aVMy colleagues in infra-red astronomy
p106
aVcall minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them.
p107
aVBut you know, everything is relative.
p108
aVSo for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VThis is the spectrum of the Sun \u2014
p112
aV24,000 spectral lines,
p113
aVand about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified.
p114
aVIt is amazing. So we are in the 21st century,
p115
aVand we still cannot properly understand
p116
aVthe spectrum of the sun.
p117
aVSometimes we have to deal with
p118
aVjust one tiny, weak spectral line
p119
aVto measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere.
p120
aVFor instance, you see the spectral line of the gold
p121
aVis the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.
p122
aVAnd we use this weak feature
p123
aVto measure the composition
p124
aVof gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd now this is a work in progress.
p127
aVWe have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature,
p128
aVwhich belongs to osmium.
p129
aVIt's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear
p130
aVexplosions of supernovae.
p131
aVIt's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium.
p132
aVJust comparing the composition of osmium
p133
aVin one of the planet host stars,
p134
aVwe want to understand why there is so much
p135
aVof this element.
p136
aVPerhaps we even think that maybe
p137
aVsupernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars.
p138
aVIt can be an indication.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe other day, my colleague from Berkeley,
p141
aVGibor Basri, emailed me
p142
aVa very interesting spectrum,
p143
aVasking me, "Can you have a look at this?"
p144
aVAnd I couldn't sleep, next two weeks,
p145
aVwhen I saw the huge amount of oxygen
p146
aVand other elements in the spectrum of the stars.
p147
aVI knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy.
p148
aVIt was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this
p149
aVis clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion
p150
aVin this system, which polluted the atmosphere
p151
aVof this star.
p152
aVAnd later a black hole was formed
p153
aVin a binary system,
p154
aVwhich is still there with a mass of about
p155
aVfive solar masses.
p156
aVThis was considered as first evidence that actually black holes
p157
aVcome from supernovae explosions.
p158
aa(lp159
VMy colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements
p160
aVin different galactic stars,
p161
aVactually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.
p162
aVIt's amazing that you can go so far
p163
aVsimply studying the chemical composition of stars.
p164
aVThey actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra
p165
aVis an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.
p166
aVThere is interaction of galaxies. We know this.
p167
aVAnd sometimes they just capture stars.
p168
aa(lp169
VYou've heard about solar flares.
p170
aVWe were very surprised to discover
p171
aVa super flare,
p172
aVa flare which is thousands of millions of times
p173
aVmore powerful than those we see in the Sun.
p174
aVIn one of the binary stars in our galaxy
p175
aVcalled FH Leo,
p176
aVwe discovered the super flare.
p177
aVAnd later we went to study the spectral stars
p178
aVto see is there anything strange with these objects.
p179
aVAnd we found that everything is normal.
p180
aVThese stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.
p181
aVSo this is a mystery.
p182
aVIt's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.
p183
aVAnd there are six or seven similar cases
p184
aVreported in the literature.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow to go ahead with this,
p187
aVwe really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.
p188
aVIt's very complicated. I don't really want you to
p189
aVtry to understand what is here.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVBut it's to show you how complicated is the whole story
p192
aVof the production of chemical elements.
p193
aVYou have two channels \u2014
p194
aVthe massive stars and low-mass stars \u2014
p195
aVproducing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.
p196
aVAnd doing this for 14 billion years,
p197
aVwe end up with this picture,
p198
aVwhich is a very important graph,
p199
aVshowing relative abundances of chemical elements
p200
aVin sun-like stars
p201
aVand in the interstellar medium.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo which means that it's really impossible
p204
aVto find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,
p205
aVfive times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.
p206
aVAnd if you find one, I will say that
p207
aVthis is something related to SETI,
p208
aVbecause naturally you can't do it.
p209
aVDoppler Effect is something very important
p210
aVfrom fundamental physics.
p211
aVAnd this is related to the change of the frequency
p212
aVof a moving source.
p213
aVThe Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.
p214
aa(lp215
VThe precision which we need
p216
aVto discover a Jupiter-like planet
p217
aVaround a sun-like star
p218
aVis something like 28.4 meters per second.
p219
aVAnd we need nine centimeters per second
p220
aVto detect an Earth-like planet.
p221
aVThis can be done with the future spectrographs.
p222
aVI, myself, I'm actually involved in the team
p223
aVwhich is developing a CODEX,
p224
aVhigh resolution, future generation spectrograph
p225
aVfor the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.
p226
aVAnd this is going to be an instrument
p227
aVto detect Earth-like planets
p228
aVaround sun-like stars.
p229
aVIt is an amazing tool called astroseismology
p230
aVwhere we can detect sound waves
p231
aVin the atmospheres of stars.
p232
aa(lp233
VThis is the sound of an Alpha Cen.
p234
aVWe can detect sound waves
p235
aVin the atmospheres of sun-like stars.
p236
aVThose waves have frequencies
p237
aVin infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.
p238
aVComing back to the most important question,
p239
aV"Is there anybody out there?"
p240
aVThis is closely related
p241
aVto tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.
p242
aVConnection between life
p243
aVand radioactive nuclei
p244
aVis straightforward.
p245
aVNo life without tectonic activity,
p246
aVwithout volcanic activity.
p247
aVAnd we know very well that geothermal energy
p248
aVis mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.
p249
aa(lp250
VHow to measure, if we have planets
p251
aVwhere the amount of those elements is small,
p252
aVso those planets are tectonically dead,
p253
aVthere cannot be life.
p254
aVIf there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,
p255
aVprobably, again, there would be no life.
p256
aVBecause can you imagine everything boiling?
p257
aVIt's too much energy on a planet.
p258
aVNow, we have been measuring abundance
p259
aVof thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.
p260
aVIt's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.
p261
aa(lp262
VWe are actually trying to measure this profile
p263
aVand to detect thorium.
p264
aVIt's very tough. It's very tough.
p265
aVAnd you have to, first you have to convince yourself.
p266
aVThen you have to convince your colleagues.
p267
aVAnd then you have to convince the whole world
p268
aVthat you have actually detected something like this
p269
aVin the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet
p270
aVhost star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.
p271
aVIt's really difficult.
p272
aVBut if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,
p273
aVyou have to do this job.
p274
aVBecause you have to know how much of radioactive element you have
p275
aVin those systems.
p276
aa(lp277
VThe one way to discover about aliens
p278
aVis to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.
p279
aVIf you receive something interesting,
p280
aVwell that's what SETI does actually,
p281
aVwhat SETI has been doing for many years.
p282
aVI think the most promising way
p283
aVis to go for biomarkers.
p284
aVYou can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,
p285
aVand that is a very clear signal.
p286
aVThe slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,
p287
aVis a detection of vegetated area.
p288
aVIt's amazing that we can detect vegetation
p289
aVfrom a spectrum.
p290
aVNow imagine doing this test
p291
aVfor other planets.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow very recently, very recently,
p294
aVI'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,
p295
aVwater, methane, carbon dioxide
p296
aVhave been detected in the spectrum
p297
aVof a planet outside the solar system.
p298
aVIt's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.
p299
aVYou can actually go and detect
p300
aVand study a chemical composition of planets
p301
aVfar, far, far from solar system.
p302
aVWe have to detect oxygen or ozone
p303
aVto make sure that we have all necessary conditions
p304
aVto have life.
p305
aa(lp306
VCosmic miracles are something
p307
aVwhich can be related to SETI.
p308
aVNow imagine an object, amazing object,
p309
aVor something which we cannot explain
p310
aVwhen we just stand up and say,
p311
aV"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work."
p312
aVSo it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,
p313
aV"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow."
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd with the known physics etc,
p316
aVit's something actually which has been pointed out
p317
aVby Frank Drake,
p318
aVmany years ago, and Shklovsky.
p319
aVIf you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,
p320
aVif you see strange chemical elements,
p321
aVit can be a signal from a civilization
p322
aVwhich is there and they want to signal about it.
p323
aVThey want to actually signal their presence
p324
aVthrough these spectral lines,
p325
aVin the spectrum of a star, in different ways.
p326
aa(lp327
VThere can be different ways doing this.
p328
aVOne is, for instance, technetium
p329
aVis a radioactive element
p330
aVwith a decay time of 4.2 million years.
p331
aVIf you suddenly observe technetium
p332
aVin a sun-like star,
p333
aVyou can be sure that somebody has put this
p334
aVelement in the atmosphere,
p335
aVbecause in a natural way it is impossible to do this.
p336
aVNow we are reviewing the spectra of about
p337
aV300 stars with extrasolar planets.
p338
aVAnd we are doing this job since 2000
p339
aVand it's a very heavy project.
p340
aVWe have been working very hard.
p341
aVAnd we have some interesting cases,
p342
aVcandidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.
p343
aVAnd I hope in the near future
p344
aVwe can confirm this.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo the main question: "Are we alone?"
p347
aVI think it will not come from UFOs.
p348
aVIt will not come from radio signals.
p349
aVI think it will come from a spectrum like this.
p350
aVIt is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,
p351
aVshowing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,
p352
aVas a clear signal of life,
p353
aVand oxygen and ozone.
p354
aVIf, one day, and I think it will be
p355
aVwithin 15 years from now, or 20 years.
p356
aVIf we discover a spectrum like this
p357
aVwe can be sure that there is life on that planet.
p358
aVIn about five years we will discover
p359
aVplanets like Earth, around sun-like stars,
p360
aVthe same distance as the Earth from the Sun.
p361
aVIt will take about five years.
p362
aVAnd then we will need another 10, 15 years
p363
aVwith space projects
p364
aVto get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.
p365
aVAnd if we see the nitrogen dioxide
p366
aVand oxygen,
p367
aVI think we have the perfect E.T.
p368
aVThank you very much.
p369
aV(Applause)

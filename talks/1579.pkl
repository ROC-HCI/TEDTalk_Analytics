VWhen I was considering a career in the art world,
p5
aVI took a course in London,
p6
aVand one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian
p7
aVcalled Pietro, who drank too much,
p8
aVsmoked too much and swore much too much.
p9
aVBut he was a passionate teacher,
p10
aVand I remember one of our earlier classes with him,
p11
aVhe was projecting images on the wall,
p12
aVasking us to think about them,
p13
aVand he put up an image of a painting.
p14
aVIt was a landscape with figures, semi-dressed,
p15
aVdrinking wine. There was a nude woman
p16
aVin the lower foreground, and on the hillside in the back,
p17
aVthere was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus,
p18
aVand he said, "What is this?"
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd I \u2014 no one else did, so I put up my hand, and I said,
p21
aV"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."
p22
aa(lp23
VHe said, "It's a what?"
p24
aa(lp25
VI thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.
p26
aV"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."
p27
aa(lp28
VHe said, "It's a what?"
p29
aa(lp30
VI said, "It's a Bacchanal by Titian." (Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VHe said, "You boneless bookworm!
p33
aVIt's a fucking orgy!"
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVAs I said, he swore too much.
p36
aa(lp37
VThere was an important lesson for me in that.
p38
aVPietro was suspicious of formal art training,
p39
aVart history training, because he feared
p40
aVthat it filled people up with jargon, and then they just
p41
aVclassified things rather than looking at them,
p42
aVand he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary,
p43
aVand he wanted us to use our eyes,
p44
aVand he was especially evangelical about this message,
p45
aVbecause he was losing his sight.
p46
aVHe wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects.
p47
aVWhat is it? How is it made? Why was it made?
p48
aVHow is it used?
p49
aVAnd these were important lessons to me when
p50
aVI subsequently became a professional art historian.
p51
aa(lp52
VMy kind of eureka moment came a few years later,
p53
aVwhen I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe,
p54
aVand of course it was very much discussed in terms of
p55
aVthe paintings and the sculptures
p56
aVand the architecture of the day.
p57
aVBut as I began to read historical documents
p58
aVand contemporary descriptions,
p59
aVI found there was a kind of a missing component,
p60
aVfor everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries.
p61
aVTapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages
p62
aVand, really, well into the 18th century,
p63
aVand it was pretty apparent why.
p64
aVTapestries were portable. You could roll them up,
p65
aVsend them ahead of you, and in the time
p66
aVit took to hang them up, you could transform a cold,
p67
aVdank interior into a richly colored setting.
p68
aVTapestries effectively provided a vast canvas
p69
aVon which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes
p70
aVwith whom they wanted to be associated,
p71
aVor even themselves,
p72
aVand in addition to that, tapestries were hugely expensive.
p73
aVThey required scores of highly skilled weavers
p74
aVworking over extended periods of time
p75
aVwith very expensive materials \u2014 the wools, the silks,
p76
aVeven gold and silver thread.
p77
aVSo, all in all, in an age when the visual image
p78
aVof any kind was rare, tapestries were an incredibly potent
p79
aVform of propaganda.
p80
aa(lp81
VWell, I became a tapestry historian.
p82
aVIn due course, I ended up as a curator
p83
aVat the Metropolitan Museum, because I saw the Met
p84
aVas one of the few places where I could organize
p85
aVreally big exhibitions about the subject
p86
aVI cared so passionately about.
p87
aVAnd in about 1997, the then-director Philippe de Montebello
p88
aVgave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition
p89
aVfor 2002. We normally have these very long lead-in times.
p90
aa(lp91
VIt wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question
p92
aVof chucking a tapestry in the back of a car.
p93
aVThey have to be wound on huge rollers,
p94
aVshipped in oversized freighters.
p95
aVSome of them are so big we had, to get them into the museum,
p96
aVwe had to take them up the great steps at the front.
p97
aa(lp98
VWe thought very hard about how to present this
p99
aVunknown subject to a modern audience:
p100
aVthe dark colors to set off the colors that remained
p101
aVin objects that were often faded;
p102
aVthe placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread;
p103
aVthe labeling.
p104
aVYou know, we live in an age where we are so used
p105
aVto television images and photographs,
p106
aVa one-hit image. These were big, complex things,
p107
aValmost like cartoons with multiple narratives.
p108
aVWe had to draw our audience in, get them to slow down,
p109
aVto explore the objects.
p110
aa(lp111
VThere was a lot of skepticism. On the opening night,
p112
aVI overheard one of the senior members of staff saying,
p113
aV"This is going to be a bomb."
p114
aVBut in reality, in the course of the coming weeks and months,
p115
aVhundreds of thousands of people came to see the show.
p116
aVThe exhibition was designed to be an experience,
p117
aVand tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs.
p118
aVSo I want you to use your imaginations,
p119
aVthinking of these wall-high objects,
p120
aVsome of them 10 meters wide,
p121
aVdepicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies
p122
aVwho would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today,
p123
aVthick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth
p124
aVin pursuit of wild boars and deer,
p125
aVviolent battles with scenes of fear and heroism.
p126
aVI remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time,
p127
aVand all the little boys, they kind of \u2014 you know, they were little boys,
p128
aVand then the thing that caught their attention
p129
aVwas in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog
p130
aVpooping in the foreground \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p131
aVkind of an in-your-face joke by the artist.
p132
aVAnd you can just imagine them.
p133
aVBut it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw
p134
aVthat these weren't just old faded tapestries.
p135
aVThese were images of the world in the past,
p136
aVand that it was the same for our audience.
p137
aVAnd for me as a curator, I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little.
p138
aVThrough this experience that could only be created
p139
aVin a museum, I'd opened up the eyes of my audience \u2014
p140
aVhistorians, artists, press, the general public \u2014
p141
aVto the beauty of this lost medium.
p142
aa(lp143
VA few years later, I was invited to be the director
p144
aVof the museum, and after I got over that \u2014
p145
aV"Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!" \u2014
p146
aVI realized the fact: I believe passionately in that
p147
aVcurated museum experience.
p148
aVWe live in an age of ubiquitous information,
p149
aVand sort of "just add water" expertise,
p150
aVbut there's nothing that compares with the presentation
p151
aVof significant objects in a well-told narrative,
p152
aVwhat the curator does, the interpretation of a complex,
p153
aVesoteric subject, in a way that retains the integrity
p154
aVof the subject, that makes it \u2014 unpacks it
p155
aVfor a general audience.
p156
aVAnd that, to me, today, is now the challenge and the fun
p157
aVof my job, supporting the vision of my curators,
p158
aVwhether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords,
p159
aVearly Byzantine artifacts, Renaissance portraits,
p160
aVor the show we heard mentioned earlier,
p161
aVthe McQueen show, with which we enjoyed
p162
aVso much success last summer.
p163
aa(lp164
VThat was an interesting case.
p165
aVIn the late spring, early summer of 2010, shortly after
p166
aVMcQueen's suicide,
p167
aVour curator of costume, Andrew Bolton, came to see me,
p168
aVand said, "I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen,
p169
aVand now is the moment. We have to, we have to do it fast."
p170
aa(lp171
VIt wasn't easy. McQueen had worked throughout his career
p172
aVwith a small team of designers and managers
p173
aVwho were very protective of his legacy,
p174
aVbut Andrew went to London and worked with them
p175
aVover the summer and won their confidence, and that of
p176
aVthe designers who created his amazing fashion shows,
p177
aVwhich were works of performance art in their own right,
p178
aVand we proceeded to do something at the museum,
p179
aVI think, we've never done before.
p180
aVIt wasn't just your standard installation.
p181
aVIn fact, we ripped down the galleries to recreate
p182
aVentirely different settings, a recreation of his first studio,
p183
aVa hall of mirrors,
p184
aVa curiosity box,
p185
aVa sunken ship, a burned-out interior,
p186
aVwith videos and soundtracks that ranged from
p187
aVoperatic arias to pigs fornicating.
p188
aVAnd in this extraordinary setting, the costumes
p189
aVwere like actors and actresses, or living sculptures.
p190
aVIt could have been a train wreck.
p191
aVIt could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue
p192
aVat Christmas, but because of the way that Andrew
p193
aVconnected with the McQueen team, he was channeling
p194
aVthe rawness and the brilliance of McQueen,
p195
aVand the show was quite transcendant,
p196
aVand it became a phenomenon in its own right.
p197
aVBy the end of the show, we had people queuing
p198
aVfor four or five hours to get into the show,
p199
aVbut no one really complained.
p200
aVI heard over and over again, "Wow, that was worth it.
p201
aVIt was a such a visceral, emotive experience."
p202
aa(lp203
VNow, I've described two very immersive exhibitions,
p204
aVbut I also believe that collections, individual objects,
p205
aVcan also have that same power.
p206
aVThe Met was set up not as a museum of American art,
p207
aVbut of an encyclopedic museum,
p208
aVand today, 140 years later, that vision
p209
aVis as prescient as ever,
p210
aVbecause, of course, we live in a world of crisis,
p211
aVof challenge, and we're exposed to it
p212
aVthrough the 24/7 newsreels.
p213
aVIt's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations,
p214
aVthe cultures, that we're seeing the current manifestation of.
p215
aVWhether it's Libya, Egypt, Syria,
p216
aVit's in our galleries that we can explain
p217
aVand give greater understanding.
p218
aa(lp219
VI mean, our new Islamic galleries are a case in point,
p220
aVopened 10 years, almost to the week, after 9/11.
p221
aVI think for most Americans, knowledge of the Islamic world
p222
aVwas pretty slight before 9/11, and then it was thrust upon us
p223
aVin one of America's darkest hours,
p224
aVand the perception was through the polarization
p225
aVof that terrible event.
p226
aVNow, in our galleries, we show 14 centuries
p227
aVof the development of different Islamic cultures
p228
aVacross a vast geographic spread,
p229
aVand, again, hundreds of thousands of people have come
p230
aVto see these galleries since they opened last October.
p231
aa(lp232
VI'm often asked, "Is digital media replacing the museum?"
p233
aVand I think those numbers are a resounding rejection
p234
aVof that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong,
p235
aVI'm a huge advocate of the Web.
p236
aVIt gives us a way of reaching out to audiences
p237
aVaround the globe, but nothing replaces the authenticity
p238
aVof the object presented with passionate scholarship.
p239
aVBringing people face to face with our objects
p240
aVis a way of bringing them face to face with people
p241
aVacross time, across space, whose lives may have been
p242
aVvery different to our own, but who, like us,
p243
aVhad hopes and dreams, frustrations and achievements
p244
aVin their lives. And I think this is a process
p245
aVthat helps us better understand ourselves,
p246
aVhelps us make better decisions about where we're going.
p247
aa(lp248
VThe Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world,
p249
aVawe-inspiring, like a medieval cathedral.
p250
aVFrom there, you can walk in any direction
p251
aVto almost any culture.
p252
aVI frequently go out into the hall and the galleries
p253
aVand I watch our visitors coming in.
p254
aVSome of them are comfortable. They feel at home.
p255
aVThey know what they're looking for.
p256
aVOthers are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place.
p257
aVThey feel that the institution is elitist.
p258
aVI'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism.
p259
aVI want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind,
p260
aVwhere they're prepared to be a little bit lost, to explore,
p261
aVto see the unfamiliar in the familiar,
p262
aVor to try the unknown.
p263
aVBecause for us, it's all about bringing them face to face
p264
aVwith great works of art,
p265
aVcapturing them at that moment of discomfort,
p266
aVwhen the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone,
p267
aVyour Blackberry, but to create a zone
p268
aVwhere their curiosity can expand.
p269
aVAnd whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture
p270
aVthat reminds you of a friend,
p271
aVor a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry,
p272
aVor, to bring it back to my tutor Pietro,
p273
aVthose dancing figures
p274
aVwho are indeed knocking back the wine,
p275
aVand that nude figure in the left foreground.
p276
aVWow. She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality.
p277
aVIn that moment, our scholarship can tell you
p278
aVthat this is a bacchanal,
p279
aVbut if we're doing our job right,
p280
aVand you've checked the jargon at the front door,
p281
aVtrust your instinct.
p282
aVYou know it's an orgy.
p283
aVThank you. (Applause)
p284
aV(Applause)

Campbell became the ninth Director of&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.metmuseum.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>&nbsp;in January of 2009. &nbsp;Since he began, Campbell has pursued an agenda for the Met that focuses on scholarship and accessibility. These priorities maintain the Museum&rsquo;s excellence in its exhibitions, publications, acquisitions and permanent collections, while encouraging new thinking about the visitor experience. Further initiatives include exploring the judicious use of technology in the Museum and fully integrating education into all the Met&rsquo;s activities.</p><p>Campbell led the Met through the fiscal setbacks caused by the 2008 recession without reducing hours, gallery openings or programs. He launched an effort to redesign the Museum&rsquo;s website which now attracts more than 50 million visits per year. FY2011 also saw the Met&rsquo;s highest attendance in 40 years, rising to 5.6 million. The Museum has just opened new galleries for its Islamic Art Department and American Wing, and is working on plans to renovate The Costume Institute and to reconfigure the outdoor plaza and fountains. In 2011, Campbell announced a collaboration with the Whitney Museum in which the Met will program its landmark Breuer Building on Madison Avenue starting in 2015. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br />Campbell had worked in the Metropolitan&#39;s Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts for fourteen years, rising steadily through the curatorial ranks as Assistant Curator (1995-97), Associate Curator (1997-2003), and Curator (2003 to December 2008). During this time, he conceived and organized the major exhibitions Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence (2002) and Tapestry in the Baroque: Threads of Splendor (New York, 2007; Palacio Real, Madrid, spring 2008), both of which incorporated drawings, paintings, and prints, as well as tapestries, and received widespread acclaim. The 2002 exhibition was named &quot;Exhibition of the Year&quot; by Apollo Magazine and its catalogue won the Alfred H. Barr, Jr. Award (College Art Association) for distinguished exhibition catalogue in the history of art (2003). &nbsp;Since shortly after his arrival at the Museum, he also served as Supervising Curator of The Antonio Ratti Textile Center, which houses the Museum&#39;s encyclopedic collection of 36,000 textiles and is one of the preeminent centers of textile studies in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "thomas_p_campbell", "whotheyare": "Thomas P.

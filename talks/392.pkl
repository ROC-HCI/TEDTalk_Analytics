VThis is a guy named Bob McKim.
p5
aVHe was a creativity researcher in the '60s and '70s,
p6
aVand also led the Stanford Design Program.
p7
aVAnd in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley,
p8
aVwho\u2019s out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford.
p9
aVAnd he liked to do an exercise with his students
p10
aVwhere he got them to take a piece of paper
p11
aVand draw the person who sat next to them, their neighbor,
p12
aVvery quickly, just as quickly as they could.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd in fact, we\u2019re going to do that exercise right now.
p15
aVYou all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper.
p16
aVIt\u2019s actually got a bunch of circles on it.
p17
aVI need you to turn that piece of paper over;
p18
aVyou should find that it\u2019s blank on the other side.
p19
aVAnd there should be a pencil.
p20
aVAnd I want you to pick somebody that\u2019s seated next to you,
p21
aVand when I say, go, you\u2019ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK?
p22
aVSo, everybody ready? OK. Off you go.
p23
aVYou\u2019ve got 30 seconds, you\u2019d better be fast.
p24
aVCome on: those masterpieces ...
p25
aVOK? Stop. All right, now.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VYes, lot\u2019s of laughter. Yeah, exactly.
p30
aVLots of laughter, quite a bit of embarrassment.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VAm I hearing a few "sorry\u2019s"? I think I\u2019m hearing a few sorry\u2019s.
p35
aVYup, yup, I think I probably am.
p36
aVAnd that\u2019s exactly what happens every time,
p37
aVevery time you do this with adults.
p38
aVMcKim found this every time he did it with his students.
p39
aVHe got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry\u2019s.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd he would point this out as evidence
p44
aVthat we fear the judgment of our peers,
p45
aVand that we\u2019re embarrassed about showing our ideas
p46
aVto people we think of as our peers, to those around us.
p47
aVAnd this fear is what causes us
p48
aVto be conservative in our thinking.
p49
aVSo we might have a wild idea,
p50
aVbut we\u2019re afraid to share it with anybody else.
p51
aa(lp52
VOK, so if you try the same exercise with kids,
p53
aVthey have no embarrassment at all.
p54
aVThey just quite happily show their masterpiece
p55
aVto whoever wants to look at it.
p56
aVBut as they learn to become adults,
p57
aVthey become much more sensitive to the opinions of others,
p58
aVand they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed.
p59
aVAnd in studies of kids playing, it\u2019s been shown
p60
aVtime after time that kids who feel secure,
p61
aVwho are in a kind of trusted environment \u2014
p62
aVthey\u2019re the ones that feel most free to play.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd if you\u2019re starting a design firm, let\u2019s say,
p65
aVthen you probably also want to create
p66
aVa place where people have the same kind of security.
p67
aVWhere they have the same kind of security to take risks.
p68
aVMaybe have the same kind of security to play.
p69
aa(lp70
VBefore founding IDEO, David said that what he wanted to do
p71
aVwas to form a company where all the employees are my best friends.
p72
aVNow, that wasn\u2019t just self-indulgence.
p73
aVHe knew that friendship is a short cut to play.
p74
aVAnd he knew that it gives us a sense of trust,
p75
aVand it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks
p76
aVthat we need to take as designers.
p77
aVAnd so, that decision to work with his friends \u2014
p78
aVnow he has 550 of them \u2014 was what got IDEO started.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd our studios, like, I think, many creative workplaces today,
p81
aVare designed to help people feel relaxed:
p82
aVfamiliar with their surroundings,
p83
aVcomfortable with the people that they\u2019re working with.
p84
aVIt takes more than decor, but I think we\u2019ve all seen that
p85
aVcreative companies do often have symbols in the workplace
p86
aVthat remind people to be playful,
p87
aVand that it\u2019s a permissive environment.
p88
aVSo, whether it\u2019s this microbus meeting room
p89
aVthat we have in one our buildings at IDEO;
p90
aVor at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves;
p91
aVor at the Googleplex, where
p92
aVit\u2019s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts,
p93
aVand even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.
p94
aVDon\u2019t know the reason for the pink flamingos,
p95
aVbut anyway, they\u2019re there in the garden.
p96
aVOr even in the Swiss office of Google,
p97
aVwhich perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all.
p98
aVAnd my theory is, that\u2019s so the Swiss can prove
p99
aVto their Californian colleagues that they\u2019re not boring.
p100
aVSo they have the slide, and they even have a fireman\u2019s pole.
p101
aVDon\u2019t know what they do with that, but they have one.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo all of these places have these symbols.
p104
aVNow, our big symbol at IDEO is actually
p105
aVnot so much the place, it\u2019s a thing.
p106
aVAnd it\u2019s actually something that we invented a few years ago,
p107
aVor created a few years ago.
p108
aVIt\u2019s a toy; it\u2019s called a "finger blaster."
p109
aVAnd I forgot to bring one up with me.
p110
aVSo if somebody can reach under the chair that\u2019s next to them,
p111
aVyou\u2019ll find something taped underneath it.
p112
aVThat\u2019s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you
p115
aVhas got one taped under your chair.
p116
aVAnd I\u2019m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment.
p117
aVBut before we start, I need just to put these on.
p118
aVThank you. All right.
p119
aVNow, what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to see how \u2014
p120
aVI can\u2019t see out of these, OK.
p121
aVI\u2019m going to see how many of you at the back of the room
p122
aVcan actually get those things onto the stage.
p123
aVSo the way they work is, you know,
p124
aVyou just put your finger in the thing,
p125
aVpull them back, and off you go.
p126
aVSo, don\u2019t look backwards. That\u2019s my only recommendation here.
p127
aVI want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage.
p128
aVSo come on! There we go, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh.
p129
aVI have another idea. I wanted to \u2014 there we go.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VThere we go.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VThank you, thank you, thank you.
p138
aVNot bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VWell, they\u2019re still coming in from the back there;
p143
aVthey\u2019re still coming in.
p144
aVSome of you haven\u2019t fired them yet.
p145
aVCan you not figure out how to do it, or something?
p146
aVIt\u2019s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this
p147
aVin the first 10 seconds, when they pick it up.
p148
aVAll right. This is pretty good; this is pretty good.
p149
aVOkay, all right. Let\u2019s \u2014 I suppose we'd better...
p150
aVI'd better clear these up out of the way;
p151
aVotherwise, I\u2019m going to trip over them.
p152
aVAll right. So the rest of you can save them
p153
aVfor when I say something particularly boring,
p154
aVand then you can fire at me.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VAll right. I think I\u2019m going to take these off now,
p159
aVbecause I can\u2019t see a damn thing when I\u2019ve \u2014 all right, OK.
p160
aVSo, ah, that was fun.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VAll right, good.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Applause)
p167
aa(lp168
VSo, OK, so why?
p169
aVSo we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs, you know.
p170
aVWhy do we have them? Well, as I said,
p171
aVwe have them because we think maybe playfulness is important.
p172
aVBut why is it important?
p173
aVWe use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest.
p174
aVWe think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions.
p175
aVHelps us do our jobs better,
p176
aVand helps us feel better when we do them.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, an adult encountering a new situation \u2014
p179
aVwhen we encounter a new situation we have a tendency
p180
aVto want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.
p181
aVAnd there\u2019s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer.
p182
aVLife\u2019s complicated; we want to figure out
p183
aVwhat\u2019s going on around us very quickly.
p184
aVI suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists
p185
aVprobably have lots of reasons [for] why we want
p186
aVto categorize new things very, very quickly.
p187
aVOne of them might be, you know,
p188
aVwhen we see this funny stripy thing:
p189
aVis that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us?
p190
aVOr is it just some weird shadows on the tree?
p191
aVWe need to figure that out pretty fast.
p192
aVWell, at least, we did once.
p193
aVMost of us don\u2019t need to anymore, I suppose.
p194
aa(lp195
VThis is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen.
p196
aVThat\u2019s what it is, isn\u2019t it? Of course it is, of course it is.
p197
aVWell, not necessarily.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VKids are more engaged with open possibilities.
p202
aVNow, they\u2019ll certainly \u2014 when they come across something new,
p203
aVthey\u2019ll certainly ask, "What is it?"
p204
aVOf course they will. But they\u2019ll also ask, "What can I do with it?"
p205
aVAnd you know, the more creative of them
p206
aVmight get to a really interesting example.
p207
aVAnd this openness is the beginning of exploratory play.
p208
aVAny parents of young kids in the audience? There must be some.
p209
aVYeah, thought so. So we\u2019ve all seen it, haven\u2019t we?
p210
aa(lp211
VWe\u2019ve all told stories about how, on Christmas morning,
p212
aVour kids end up playing with the boxes
p213
aVfar more than they play with the toys that are inside them.
p214
aVAnd you know, from an exploration perspective,
p215
aVthis behavior makes complete sense.
p216
aVBecause you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy.
p217
aVEven one like, say, Tickle Me Elmo \u2014
p218
aVwhich, despite its ingenuity, really only does one thing,
p219
aVwhereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices.
p220
aVSo again, this is another one of those playful activities
p221
aVthat, as we get older, we tend to forget and we have to relearn.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo another one of Bob McKim\u2019s favorite exercises
p224
aVis called the "30 Circles Test."
p225
aVSo we\u2019re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again.
p226
aVTurn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on
p227
aVback over, and you\u2019ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper.
p228
aVSo it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this.
p229
aVSo what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to give you minute,
p230
aVand I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can
p231
aVinto objects of some form.
p232
aVSo for example, you could turn one into a football,
p233
aVor another one into a sun. All I\u2019m interested in is quantity.
p234
aVI want you to do as many of them as you can,
p235
aVin the minute that I\u2019m just about to give you.
p236
aVSo, everybody ready? OK? Off you go.
p237
aa(lp238
VOkay. Put down your pencils, as they say.
p239
aVSo, who got more than five circles figured out?
p240
aVHopefully everybody? More than 10?
p241
aVKeep your hands up if you did 10.
p242
aV15? 20? Anybody get all 30?
p243
aVNo? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.
p244
aVDid anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face?
p245
aVHappy face? Sad face? Sleepy face? Anybody do that?
p246
aVAnybody use my examples? The sun and the football?
p247
aVGreat. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity.
p248
aVI wasn\u2019t actually very interested in whether they were all different.
p249
aVI just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible.
p250
aVAnd one of the things we tend to do as adults, again, is we edit things.
p251
aVWe stop ourselves from doing things.
p252
aVWe self-edit as we\u2019re having ideas.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing.
p255
aVAnd that actually isn\u2019t necessarily really playful.
p256
aVSo that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things,
p257
aVeven if they don\u2019t seem that different from each other,
p258
aVis actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play.
p259
aVSo now, Bob McKim did another
p260
aVversion of this test
p261
aVin a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s.
p262
aVAnybody know what this is? It\u2019s the peyote cactus.
p263
aVIt\u2019s the plant from which you can create mescaline,
p264
aVone of the psychedelic drugs.
p265
aVFor those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well.
p266
aa(lp267
VMcKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment
p268
aVthat he and his colleagues conducted
p269
aVto test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity.
p270
aVSo he picked 27 professionals \u2014 they were
p271
aVengineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects,
p272
aVfurniture designers even, artists \u2014
p273
aVand he asked them to come along one evening,
p274
aVand to bring a problem with them that they were working on.
p275
aVHe gave each of them some mescaline,
p276
aVand had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while.
p277
aVAnd then he did what\u2019s called the Purdue Creativity Test.
p278
aVYou might know it as, "How many uses can you find for a paper clip?"
p279
aVIt\u2019s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do.
p280
aa(lp281
VNow, actually, he gave the test before the drugs
p282
aVand after the drugs, to see
p283
aVwhat the difference was in people\u2019s
p284
aVfacility and speed with coming up with ideas.
p285
aVAnd then he asked them to go away
p286
aVand work on those problems that they\u2019d brought.
p287
aVAnd they\u2019d come up with a bunch of
p288
aVinteresting solutions \u2014 and actually, quite
p289
aVvalid solutions \u2014 to the things that they\u2019d been working on.
p290
aVAnd so, some of the things that they figured out,
p291
aVsome of these individuals figured out;
p292
aVin one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses
p293
aVthat were accepted by clients;
p294
aVa design of a solar space probe experiment;
p295
aVa redesign of the linear electron accelerator;
p296
aVan engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder \u2014
p297
aVyou can tell this is a while ago;
p298
aVthe completion of a line of furniture;
p299
aVand even a new conceptual model of the photon.
p300
aVSo it was a pretty successful evening.
p301
aa(lp302
VIn fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley
p303
aVgot off to its great start with innovation.
p304
aVWe don\u2019t know, but it may be.
p305
aVWe need to ask some of the CEOs
p306
aVwhether they were involved in this mescaline experiment.
p307
aVBut really, it wasn\u2019t the drugs that were important;
p308
aVit was this idea that what the drugs did
p309
aVwould help shock people out of their normal way of thinking,
p310
aVand getting them to forget the adult behaviors
p311
aVthat were getting in the way of their ideas.
p312
aVBut it\u2019s hard to break our habits, our adult habits.
p313
aa(lp314
VAt IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls.
p315
aVEdicts like, "Defer judgment," or "Go for quantity."
p316
aVAnd somehow that seems wrong.
p317
aVI mean, can you have rules about creativity?
p318
aVWell, it sort of turns out that we need rules
p319
aVto help us break the old rules and norms
p320
aVthat otherwise we might bring to the creative process.
p321
aVAnd we\u2019ve certainly learnt that over time,
p322
aVyou get much better brainstorming,
p323
aVmuch more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules.
p324
aVNow, of course, many designers, many individual designers,
p325
aVachieve this is in a much more organic way.
p326
aa(lp327
VI think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation.
p328
aVAnd they experimented with plywood for many years
p329
aVwithout necessarily having one single goal in mind.
p330
aVThey were exploring following what was interesting to them.
p331
aVThey went from designing splints for wounded soldiers
p332
aVcoming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think,
p333
aVand from this experiment they moved on to chairs.
p334
aa(lp335
VThrough constant experimentation with materials,
p336
aVthey developed a wide range of iconic solutions
p337
aVthat we know today, eventually resulting in,
p338
aVof course, the legendary lounge chair.
p339
aVNow, if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution,
p340
aVthen we wouldn\u2019t be the beneficiaries of so many
p341
aVwonderful designs today.
p342
aVAnd of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work,
p343
aVfrom films to buildings, from games to graphics.
p344
aVSo, they\u2019re great examples, I think, of exploration
p345
aVand experimentation in design.
p346
aa(lp347
VNow, while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities,
p348
aVthey were also exploring physical objects.
p349
aVAnd they were doing that through building prototypes.
p350
aVAnd building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I\u2019d talk about.
p351
aVSo the average Western first-grader
p352
aVspends as much as 50 percent of their play time
p353
aVtaking part in what\u2019s called "construction play."
p354
aVConstruction play \u2014 it\u2019s playful, obviously,
p355
aVbut also a powerful way to learn.
p356
aVWhen play is about building a tower out of blocks,
p357
aVthe kid begins to learn a lot about towers.
p358
aVAnd as they repeatedly knock it down and start again,
p359
aVlearning is happening as a sort of by-product of play.
p360
aVIt\u2019s classically learning by doing.
p361
aa(lp362
VNow, David Kelley calls this behavior,
p363
aVwhen it\u2019s carried out by designers, "thinking with your hands."
p364
aVAnd it typically involves making multiple,
p365
aVlow-resolution prototypes very quickly,
p366
aVoften by bringing lots of found elements together
p367
aVin order to get to a solution.
p368
aVOn one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck,
p369
aVand they came up with a mechanism by hacking together
p370
aVa prototype made from a roll-on deodorant.
p371
aVNow, that became the first commercial computer mouse
p372
aVfor the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo, they learned their way to that by building prototypes.
p375
aVAnother example is a group of designers
p376
aVwho were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons.
p377
aVThey were meeting with them; they were talking to the surgeons
p378
aVabout what it was they needed with this device.
p379
aVAnd one of the designers ran out of the room
p380
aVand grabbed a white board marker and a film canister \u2014
p381
aVwhich is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium \u2014
p382
aVand a clothespin. He taped them all together,
p383
aVran back into the room and said, "You mean, something like this?"
p384
aVAnd the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said,
p385
aVwell, I want to hold it like this, or like that.
p386
aVAnd all of a sudden a productive conversation
p387
aVwas happening about design around a tangible object.
p388
aVAnd in the end it turned into a real device.
p389
aa(lp390
VAnd so this behavior is all about quickly getting something
p391
aVinto the real world, and having your thinking advanced as a result.
p392
aVAt IDEO there\u2019s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel
p393
aVsometimes about the environment.
p394
aVThe prototyping carts, filled with colored paper
p395
aVand Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff \u2014
p396
aVI mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them.
p397
aVBut the important idea is that everything\u2019s at hand, everything\u2019s around.
p398
aVSo when designers are working on ideas,
p399
aVthey can start building stuff whenever they want.
p400
aVThey don\u2019t necessarily even have to go
p401
aVinto some kind of formal workshop to do it.
p402
aVAnd we think that\u2019s pretty important.
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd then the sad thing is, although preschools
p405
aVare full of this kind of stuff, as kids go through the school system
p406
aVit all gets taken away.
p407
aVThey lose this stuff that facilitates
p408
aVthis sort of playful and building mode of thinking.
p409
aVAnd of course, by the time you get to the average workplace,
p410
aVmaybe the best construction tool we have
p411
aVmight be the Post-it notes. It\u2019s pretty barren.
p412
aVBut by giving project teams and the clients
p413
aVwho they\u2019re working with permission to think with their hands,
p414
aVquite complex ideas can spring into life
p415
aVand go right through to execution much more easily.
p416
aa(lp417
VThis is a nurse using a very simple \u2014 as you can see \u2014 plasticine prototype,
p418
aVexplaining what she wants out of a portable information system
p419
aVto a team of technologists and designers
p420
aVthat are working with her in a hospital.
p421
aVAnd just having this very simple prototype
p422
aVallows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way.
p423
aVAnd of course, by building quick prototypes,
p424
aVwe can get out and test our ideas with consumers
p425
aVand users much more quickly
p426
aVthan if we\u2019re trying to describe them through words.
p427
aa(lp428
VBut what about designing something that isn\u2019t physical?
p429
aVSomething like a service or an experience?
p430
aVSomething that exists as a series of interactions over time?
p431
aVInstead of building play, this can be approached with role-play.
p432
aVSo, if you\u2019re designing an interaction between two people \u2014
p433
aVsuch as, I don\u2019t know \u2014 ordering food at a fast food joint
p434
aVor something, you need to be able to imagine
p435
aVhow that experience might feel over a period of time.
p436
aVAnd I think the best way to achieve that,
p437
aVand get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out.
p438
aa(lp439
VSo we do quite a lot of work at IDEO
p440
aVtrying to convince our clients of this.
p441
aVThey can be a little skeptical; I\u2019ll come back to that.
p442
aVBut a place, I think, where the effort is really worthwhile
p443
aVis where people are wrestling with quite serious problems \u2014
p444
aVthings like education or security or finance or health.
p445
aVAnd this is another example in a healthcare environment
p446
aVof some doctors and some nurses and designers
p447
aVacting out a service scenario around patient care.
p448
aVBut you know, many adults
p449
aVare pretty reluctant to engage with role-play.
p450
aVSome of it\u2019s embarrassment and some of it is because
p451
aVthey just don\u2019t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid.
p452
aVThey dismiss an interesting interaction by saying,
p453
aVyou know, "That\u2019s just happening because they\u2019re acting it out."
p454
aa(lp455
VResearch into kids' behavior actually suggests
p456
aVthat it\u2019s worth taking role-playing seriously.
p457
aVBecause when children play a role,
p458
aVthey actually follow social scripts quite closely
p459
aVthat they\u2019ve learnt from us as adults.
p460
aVIf one kid plays "store," and another one\u2019s playing "house,"
p461
aVthen the whole kind of play falls down.
p462
aVSo they get used to quite quickly
p463
aVto understanding the rules for social interactions,
p464
aVand are actually quite quick to point out when they\u2019re broken.
p465
aa(lp466
VSo when, as adults, we role-play,
p467
aVthen we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.
p468
aVWe\u2019ve gone through lots of experiences in life,
p469
aVand they provide a strong intuition
p470
aVas to whether an interaction is going to work.
p471
aVSo we\u2019re very good, when acting out a solution,
p472
aVat spotting whether something lacks authenticity.
p473
aVSo role-play is actually, I think,
p474
aVquite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences.
p475
aVAnother way for us, as designers, to explore role-play
p476
aVis to put ourselves through an experience which we\u2019re designing for,
p477
aVand project ourselves into an experience.
p478
aa(lp479
VSo here are some designers who are trying to understand
p480
aVwhat it might feel like to sleep in a
p481
aVconfined space on an airplane.
p482
aVAnd so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see,
p483
aVand did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play,
p484
aVjust to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers
p485
aVif they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes.
p486
aa(lp487
VThis is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian,
p488
aVand he\u2019s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient.
p489
aVNow, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room.
p490
aVOne of the reasons he chose to take
p491
aVthis rather large video camera with him was
p492
aVbecause he didn\u2019t want the doctors and nurses thinking
p493
aVhe was actually sick, and sticking something into him
p494
aVthat he was going to regret later.
p495
aVSo anyhow, he went there with his video camera,
p496
aVand it\u2019s kind of interesting to see what he brought back.
p497
aVBecause when we looked at the video when he got back,
p498
aVwe saw 20 minutes of this.
p499
aa(lp500
V(Laughter)
p501
aa(lp502
VAnd also, the amazing thing about this video \u2014
p503
aVas soon as you see it you immediately
p504
aVproject yourself into that experience.
p505
aVAnd you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty
p506
aVwhile you\u2019re left out in the hallway
p507
aVwhile the docs are dealing with some more urgent case
p508
aVin one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck\u2019s going on.
p509
aVAnd so this notion of using role-play \u2014
p510
aVor in this case, living through the experience
p511
aVas a way of creating empathy \u2014
p512
aVparticularly when you use video, is really powerful.
p513
aa(lp514
VOr another one of our designers, Altay Sendil:
p515
aVhe\u2019s here having his chest waxed, not because he\u2019s very vain,
p516
aValthough actually he is \u2014 no, I\u2019m kidding \u2014
p517
aVbut in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients
p518
aVgo through when they\u2019re having dressings removed.
p519
aVAnd so sometimes these analogous experiences,
p520
aVanalogous role-play, can also be quite valuable.
p521
aa(lp522
VSo when a kid dresses up as a firefighter, you know,
p523
aVhe\u2019s beginning to try on that identity.
p524
aVHe wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter.
p525
aVWe\u2019re doing the same thing as designers.
p526
aVWe\u2019re trying on these experiences.
p527
aVAnd so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool,
p528
aVas well as a tool for prototyping experiences.
p529
aVAnd you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway.
p530
aVNot just because they lead to insights about the experience,
p531
aVbut also because of their willingness to explore
p532
aVand their ability to unselfconsciously
p533
aVsurrender themselves to the experience.
p534
aVIn short, we admire their willingness to play.
p535
aa(lp536
VPlayful exploration, playful building and role-play:
p537
aVthose are some of the ways that designers use play in their work.
p538
aVAnd so far, I admit, this might feel
p539
aVlike it\u2019s a message just to go out and play like a kid.
p540
aVAnd to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points.
p541
aVThe first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.
p542
aVPlay has rules, especially when it\u2019s group play.
p543
aVWhen kids play tea party, or they play cops and robbers,
p544
aVthey\u2019re following a script that they\u2019ve agreed to.
p545
aVAnd it\u2019s this code negotiation that leads to productive play.
p546
aa(lp547
VSo, remember the sketching task we did at the beginning?
p548
aVThe kind of little face, the portrait you did?
p549
aVWell, imagine if you did the same task with friends
p550
aVwhile you were drinking in a pub.
p551
aVBut everybody agreed to play a game
p552
aVwhere the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks.
p553
aVThat framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing,
p554
aVdifficult situation into a fun game.
p555
aVAs a result, we\u2019d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time \u2014
p556
aVbut because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together.
p557
aa(lp558
VBut there aren\u2019t just rules about how to play;
p559
aVthere are rules about when to play.
p560
aVKids don\u2019t play all the time, obviously.
p561
aVThey transition in and out of it,
p562
aVand good teachers spend a lot of time
p563
aVthinking about how to move kids through these experiences.
p564
aVAs designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also.
p565
aVAnd if we\u2019re running design studios
p566
aVwe need to be able to figure out, how can we transition
p567
aVdesigners through these different experiences?
p568
aVI think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of \u2014
p569
aa(lp570
VI think what\u2019s very different about design
p571
aVis that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation.
p572
aVWe go through a sort of generative mode,
p573
aVwhere we\u2019re exploring many ideas;
p574
aVand then we come back together again,
p575
aVand come back looking for that solution,
p576
aVand developing that solution.
p577
aVI think they\u2019re two quite different modes:
p578
aVdivergence and convergence.
p579
aVAnd I think it\u2019s probably in the divergent mode
p580
aVthat we most need playfulness.
p581
aVPerhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious.
p582
aVAnd so being able to move between those modes
p583
aVis really quite important. So, it\u2019s where there\u2019s a
p584
aVmore nuanced version view of play, I think, is required.
p585
aa(lp586
VBecause it\u2019s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute.
p587
aVYou\u2019re either playful or you\u2019re serious, and you can\u2019t be both.
p588
aVBut that\u2019s not really true: you can be a serious professional adult
p589
aVand, at times, be playful.
p590
aVIt\u2019s not an either/or; it\u2019s an "and."
p591
aVYou can be serious and play.
p592
aVSo to sum it up, we need trust to play,
p593
aVand we need trust to be creative. So, there\u2019s a connection.
p594
aVAnd there are a series of behaviors that we\u2019ve learnt as kids,
p595
aVand that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers.
p596
aVThey include exploration, which is about going for quantity;
p597
aVbuilding, and thinking with your hands;
p598
aVand role-play, where acting it out helps us both
p599
aVto have more empathy for the situations in which we\u2019re designing,
p600
aVand to create services and experiences
p601
aVthat are seamless and authentic.
p602
aa(lp603
VThank you very much. (Applause)

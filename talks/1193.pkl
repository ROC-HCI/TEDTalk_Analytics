VEmbracing otherness.
p5
aVWhen I first heard this theme,
p6
aVI thought, well, embracing otherness
p7
aVis embracing myself.
p8
aVAnd the journey to that place
p9
aVof understanding and acceptance
p10
aVhas been an interesting one for me,
p11
aVand it's given me an insight
p12
aVinto the whole notion of self,
p13
aVwhich I think is worth sharing with you today.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe each have a self,
p16
aVbut I don't think that we're born with one.
p17
aVYou know how newborn babies
p18
aVbelieve they're part of everything;
p19
aVthey're not separate?
p20
aVWell that fundamental sense of oneness
p21
aVis lost on us very quickly.
p22
aVIt's like that initial stage is over \u2014
p23
aVoneness: infancy,
p24
aVunformed, primitive.
p25
aVIt's no longer valid or real.
p26
aVWhat is real is separateness,
p27
aVand at some point in early babyhood,
p28
aVthe idea of self
p29
aVstarts to form.
p30
aVOur little portion of oneness is given a name,
p31
aVis told all kinds of things about itself,
p32
aVand these details,
p33
aVopinions and ideas
p34
aVbecome facts,
p35
aVwhich go towards building ourselves,
p36
aVour identity.
p37
aVAnd that self becomes the vehicle
p38
aVfor navigating our social world.
p39
aVBut the self is a projection
p40
aVbased on other people's projections.
p41
aVIs it who we really are?
p42
aVOr who we really want to be, or should be?
p43
aa(lp44
VSo this whole interaction
p45
aVwith self and identity
p46
aVwas a very difficult one for me growing up.
p47
aVThe self that I attempted to take out into the world
p48
aVwas rejected over and over again.
p49
aVAnd my panic
p50
aVat not having a self that fit,
p51
aVand the confusion that came
p52
aVfrom my self being rejected,
p53
aVcreated anxiety, shame
p54
aVand hopelessness,
p55
aVwhich kind of defined me for a long time.
p56
aVBut in retrospect,
p57
aVthe destruction of my self was so repetitive
p58
aVthat I started to see a pattern.
p59
aVThe self changed,
p60
aVgot affected, broken, destroyed,
p61
aVbut another one would evolve \u2014
p62
aVsometimes stronger,
p63
aVsometimes hateful,
p64
aVsometimes not wanting to be there at all.
p65
aVThe self was not constant.
p66
aVAnd how many times
p67
aVwould my self have to die
p68
aVbefore I realized
p69
aVthat it was never alive in the first place?
p70
aa(lp71
VI grew up on the coast of England
p72
aVin the '70s.
p73
aVMy dad is white from Cornwall,
p74
aVand my mom is black from Zimbabwe.
p75
aVEven the idea of us as a family
p76
aVwas challenging to most people.
p77
aVBut nature had its wicked way,
p78
aVand brown babies were born.
p79
aVBut from about the age of five,
p80
aVI was aware that I didn't fit.
p81
aVI was the black atheist kid
p82
aVin the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.
p83
aVI was an anomaly,
p84
aVand my self was rooting around for definition
p85
aVand trying to plug in.
p86
aVBecause the self likes to fit,
p87
aVto see itself replicated,
p88
aVto belong.
p89
aVThat confirms its existence
p90
aVand its importance.
p91
aVAnd it is important.
p92
aVIt has an extremely important function.
p93
aVWithout it, we literally can't interface with others.
p94
aVWe can't hatch plans
p95
aVand climb that stairway of popularity,
p96
aVof success.
p97
aVBut my skin color wasn't right.
p98
aVMy hair wasn't right.
p99
aVMy history wasn't right.
p100
aVMy self became defined
p101
aVby otherness,
p102
aVwhich meant that, in that social world,
p103
aVI didn't really exist.
p104
aVAnd I was "other" before being anything else \u2014
p105
aVeven before being a girl.
p106
aVI was a noticeable nobody.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnother world was opening up
p109
aVaround this time:
p110
aVperformance and dancing.
p111
aVThat nagging dread of self-hood
p112
aVdidn't exist when I was dancing.
p113
aVI'd literally lose myself.
p114
aVAnd I was a really good dancer.
p115
aVI would put
p116
aVall my emotional expression
p117
aVinto my dancing.
p118
aVI could be in the movement
p119
aVin a way that I wasn't able to be
p120
aVin my real life, in myself.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd at 16,
p123
aVI stumbled across another opportunity,
p124
aVand I earned my first acting role in a film.
p125
aVI can hardly find the words
p126
aVto describe the peace I felt
p127
aVwhen I was acting.
p128
aVMy dysfunctional self
p129
aVcould actually plug in
p130
aVto another self, not my own,
p131
aVand it felt so good.
p132
aVIt was the first time that I existed
p133
aVinside a fully-functioning self \u2014
p134
aVone that I controlled,
p135
aVthat I steered,
p136
aVthat I gave life to.
p137
aVBut the shooting day would end,
p138
aVand I'd return
p139
aVto my gnarly, awkward self.
p140
aa(lp141
VBy 19,
p142
aVI was a fully-fledged movie actor,
p143
aVbut still searching for definition.
p144
aVI applied to read anthropology
p145
aVat university.
p146
aVDr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview,
p147
aVand she asked me, "How would you define race?"
p148
aVWell, I thought I had the answer to that one,
p149
aVand I said, "Skin color."
p150
aV"So biology, genetics?" she said.
p151
aV"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.
p152
aVBecause there's actually more genetic difference
p153
aVbetween a black Kenyan
p154
aVand a black Ugandan
p155
aVthan there is between a black Kenyan
p156
aVand, say, a white Norwegian.
p157
aVBecause we all stem from Africa.
p158
aVSo in Africa,
p159
aVthere's been more time
p160
aVto create genetic diversity."
p161
aVIn other words,
p162
aVrace has no basis
p163
aVin biological or scientific fact.
p164
aVOn the one hand, result.
p165
aVRight?
p166
aVOn the other hand, my definition of self
p167
aVjust lost a huge chunk of its credibility.
p168
aVBut what was credible,
p169
aVwhat is biological and scientific fact,
p170
aVis that we all stem from Africa \u2014
p171
aVin fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve
p172
aVwho lived 160,000 years ago.
p173
aVAnd race is an illegitimate concept
p174
aVwhich our selves have created
p175
aVbased on fear and ignorance.
p176
aa(lp177
VStrangely, these revelations
p178
aVdidn't cure my low self-esteem,
p179
aVthat feeling of otherness.
p180
aVMy desire to disappear
p181
aVwas still very powerful.
p182
aVI had a degree from Cambridge;
p183
aVI had a thriving career,
p184
aVbut my self was a car crash,
p185
aVand I wound up with bulimia
p186
aVand on a therapist's couch.
p187
aVAnd of course I did.
p188
aVI still believed
p189
aVmy self was all I was.
p190
aVI still valued self-worth
p191
aVabove all other worth,
p192
aVand what was there to suggest otherwise?
p193
aVWe've created entire value systems
p194
aVand a physical reality
p195
aVto support the worth of self.
p196
aVLook at the industry for self-image
p197
aVand the jobs it creates,
p198
aVthe revenue it turns over.
p199
aVWe'd be right in assuming
p200
aVthat the self is an actual living thing.
p201
aVBut it's not. It's a projection
p202
aVwhich our clever brains create
p203
aVin order to cheat ourselves
p204
aVfrom the reality of death.
p205
aa(lp206
VBut there is something
p207
aVthat can give the self
p208
aVultimate and infinite connection \u2014
p209
aVand that thing is oneness,
p210
aVour essence.
p211
aVThe self's struggle
p212
aVfor authenticity and definition
p213
aVwill never end
p214
aVunless it's connected to its creator \u2014
p215
aVto you and to me.
p216
aVAnd that can happen with awareness \u2014
p217
aVawareness of the reality of oneness
p218
aVand the projection of self-hood.
p219
aVFor a start, we can think about
p220
aVall the times when we do lose ourselves.
p221
aVIt happens when I dance,
p222
aVwhen I'm acting.
p223
aVI'm earthed in my essence,
p224
aVand my self is suspended.
p225
aVIn those moments,
p226
aVI'm connected to everything \u2014
p227
aVthe ground, the air,
p228
aVthe sounds, the energy from the audience.
p229
aVAll my senses are alert and alive
p230
aVin much the same way as an infant might feel \u2014
p231
aVthat feeling of oneness.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd when I'm acting a role,
p234
aVI inhabit another self,
p235
aVand I give it life for awhile,
p236
aVbecause when the self is suspended
p237
aVso is divisiveness
p238
aVand judgment.
p239
aVAnd I've played everything
p240
aVfrom a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery
p241
aVto Secretary of State in 2004.
p242
aVAnd no matter how other
p243
aVthese selves might be,
p244
aVthey're all related in me.
p245
aVAnd I honestly believe
p246
aVthe key to my success as an actor
p247
aVand my progress as a person
p248
aVhas been the very lack of self
p249
aVthat used to make me feel
p250
aVso anxious and insecure.
p251
aVI always wondered
p252
aVwhy I could feel others' pain so deeply,
p253
aVwhy I could recognize
p254
aVthe somebody in the nobody.
p255
aVIt's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.
p256
aVI thought I lacked substance,
p257
aVand the fact that I could feel others'
p258
aVmeant that I had nothing of myself to feel.
p259
aVThe thing that was a source of shame
p260
aVwas actually a source of enlightenment.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd when I realized
p263
aVand really understood
p264
aVthat my self is a projection and that it has a function,
p265
aVa funny thing happened.
p266
aVI stopped giving it so much authority.
p267
aVI give it its due.
p268
aVI take it to therapy.
p269
aVI've become very familiar
p270
aVwith its dysfunctional behavior.
p271
aVBut I'm not ashamed of my self.
p272
aVIn fact, I respect my self
p273
aVand its function.
p274
aVAnd over time and with practice,
p275
aVI've tried to live
p276
aVmore and more from my essence.
p277
aVAnd if you can do that,
p278
aVincredible things happen.
p279
aa(lp280
VI was in Congo in February,
p281
aVdancing and celebrating
p282
aVwith women who've survived
p283
aVthe destruction of their selves
p284
aVin literally unthinkable ways \u2014
p285
aVdestroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves
p286
aVall over that beautiful land
p287
aVare fueling our selves' addiction
p288
aVto iPods, Pads, and bling,
p289
aVwhich further disconnect ourselves
p290
aVfrom ever feeling their pain,
p291
aVtheir suffering,
p292
aVtheir death.
p293
aVBecause, hey,
p294
aVif we're all living in ourselves
p295
aVand mistaking it for life,
p296
aVthen we're devaluing
p297
aVand desensitizing life.
p298
aVAnd in that disconnected state,
p299
aVyeah, we can build factory farms with no windows,
p300
aVdestroy marine life
p301
aVand use rape as a weapon of war.
p302
aVSo here's a note to self:
p303
aVThe cracks have started to show
p304
aVin our constructed world,
p305
aVand oceans will continue
p306
aVto surge through the cracks,
p307
aVand oil and blood,
p308
aVrivers of it.
p309
aa(lp310
VCrucially, we haven't been figuring out
p311
aVhow to live in oneness
p312
aVwith the Earth and every other living thing.
p313
aVWe've just been insanely trying to figure out
p314
aVhow to live with each other \u2014 billions of each other.
p315
aVOnly we're not living with each other;
p316
aVour crazy selves are living with each other
p317
aVand perpetuating an epidemic
p318
aVof disconnection.
p319
aa(lp320
VLet's live with each other
p321
aVand take it a breath at a time.
p322
aVIf we can get under that heavy self,
p323
aVlight a torch of awareness,
p324
aVand find our essence,
p325
aVour connection to the infinite
p326
aVand every other living thing.
p327
aVWe knew it from the day we were born.
p328
aVLet's not be freaked out
p329
aVby our bountiful nothingness.
p330
aVIt's more a reality
p331
aVthan the ones our selves have created.
p332
aVImagine what kind of existence we can have
p333
aVif we honor inevitable death of self,
p334
aVappreciate the privilege of life
p335
aVand marvel at what comes next.
p336
aVSimple awareness is where it begins.
p337

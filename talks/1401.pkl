VThe electricity powering the lights in this theater
p5
aVwas generated just moments ago.
p6
aVBecause the way things stand today,
p7
aVelectricity demand must be in constant balance
p8
aVwith electricity supply.
p9
aVIf in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage,
p10
aVsome tens of megawatts of wind power
p11
aVstopped pouring into the grid,
p12
aVthe difference would have to be made up
p13
aVfrom other generators immediately.
p14
aVBut coal plants, nuclear plants
p15
aVcan't respond fast enough.
p16
aVA giant battery could.
p17
aVWith a giant battery,
p18
aVwe'd be able to address the problem of intermittency
p19
aVthat prevents wind and solar
p20
aVfrom contributing to the grid
p21
aVin the same way that coal, gas and nuclear do today.
p22
aa(lp23
VYou see, the battery
p24
aVis the key enabling device here.
p25
aVWith it, we could draw electricity from the sun
p26
aVeven when the sun doesn't shine.
p27
aVAnd that changes everything.
p28
aVBecause then renewables
p29
aVsuch as wind and solar
p30
aVcome out from the wings,
p31
aVhere to center stage.
p32
aVToday I want to tell you about such a device.
p33
aVIt's called the liquid metal battery.
p34
aVIt's a new form of energy storage
p35
aVthat I invented at MIT
p36
aValong with a team of my students
p37
aVand post-docs.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow the theme of this year's TED Conference is Full Spectrum.
p40
aVThe OED defines spectrum
p41
aVas "The entire range of wavelengths
p42
aVof electromagnetic radiation,
p43
aVfrom the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays
p44
aVof which the range of visible light
p45
aVis only a small part."
p46
aVSo I'm not here today only to tell you
p47
aVhow my team at MIT has drawn out of nature
p48
aVa solution to one of the world's great problems.
p49
aVI want to go full spectrum and tell you how,
p50
aVin the process of developing
p51
aVthis new technology,
p52
aVwe've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies
p53
aVthat can serve as lessons for innovation,
p54
aVideas worth spreading.
p55
aVAnd you know,
p56
aVif we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation,
p57
aVwe can't just conserve our way out;
p58
aVwe can't just drill our way out;
p59
aVwe can't bomb our way out.
p60
aVWe're going to do it the old-fashioned American way,
p61
aVwe're going to invent our way out,
p62
aVworking together.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VNow let's get started.
p67
aVThe battery was invented about 200 years ago
p68
aVby a professor, Alessandro Volta,
p69
aVat the University of Padua in Italy.
p70
aVHis invention gave birth to a new field of science,
p71
aVelectrochemistry,
p72
aVand new technologies
p73
aVsuch as electroplating.
p74
aVPerhaps overlooked,
p75
aVVolta's invention of the battery
p76
aVfor the first time also
p77
aVdemonstrated the utility of a professor.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVUntil Volta, nobody could imagine
p80
aVa professor could be of any use.
p81
aa(lp82
VHere's the first battery \u2014
p83
aVa stack of coins, zinc and silver,
p84
aVseparated by cardboard soaked in brine.
p85
aVThis is the starting point
p86
aVfor designing a battery \u2014
p87
aVtwo electrodes,
p88
aVin this case metals of different composition,
p89
aVand an electrolyte,
p90
aVin this case salt dissolved in water.
p91
aVThe science is that simple.
p92
aVAdmittedly, I've left out a few details.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow I've taught you
p95
aVthat battery science is straightforward
p96
aVand the need for grid-level storage
p97
aVis compelling,
p98
aVbut the fact is
p99
aVthat today there is simply no battery technology
p100
aVcapable of meeting
p101
aVthe demanding performance requirements of the grid \u2014
p102
aVnamely uncommonly high power,
p103
aVlong service lifetime
p104
aVand super-low cost.
p105
aVWe need to think about the problem differently.
p106
aVWe need to think big,
p107
aVwe need to think cheap.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo let's abandon the paradigm
p110
aVof let's search for the coolest chemistry
p111
aVand then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve
p112
aVby just making lots and lots of product.
p113
aVInstead, let's invent
p114
aVto the price point of the electricity market.
p115
aVSo that means
p116
aVthat certain parts of the periodic table
p117
aVare axiomatically off-limits.
p118
aVThis battery needs to be made
p119
aVout of earth-abundant elements.
p120
aVI say, if you want to make something dirt cheap,
p121
aVmake it out of dirt \u2014
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVpreferably dirt
p124
aVthat's locally sourced.
p125
aVAnd we need to be able to build this thing
p126
aVusing simple manufacturing techniques and factories
p127
aVthat don't cost us a fortune.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo about six years ago,
p130
aVI started thinking about this problem.
p131
aVAnd in order to adopt a fresh perspective,
p132
aVI sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage.
p133
aVIn fact, I looked to a technology
p134
aVthat neither stores nor generates electricity,
p135
aVbut instead consumes electricity,
p136
aVhuge amounts of it.
p137
aVI'm talking about the production of aluminum.
p138
aVThe process was invented in 1886
p139
aVby a couple of 22-year-olds \u2014
p140
aVHall in the United States and Heroult in France.
p141
aVAnd just a few short years following their discovery,
p142
aValuminum changed
p143
aVfrom a precious metal costing as much as silver
p144
aVto a common structural material.
p145
aa(lp146
VYou're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.
p147
aVIt's about 50 feet wide
p148
aVand recedes about half a mile \u2014
p149
aVrow after row of cells
p150
aVthat, inside, resemble Volta's battery,
p151
aVwith three important differences.
p152
aVVolta's battery works at room temperature.
p153
aVIt's fitted with solid electrodes
p154
aVand an electrolyte that's a solution of salt and water.
p155
aVThe Hall-Heroult cell
p156
aVoperates at high temperature,
p157
aVa temperature high enough
p158
aVthat the aluminum metal product is liquid.
p159
aVThe electrolyte
p160
aVis not a solution of salt and water,
p161
aVbut rather salt that's melted.
p162
aVIt's this combination of liquid metal,
p163
aVmolten salt and high temperature
p164
aVthat allows us to send high current through this thing.
p165
aVToday, we can produce virgin metal from ore
p166
aVat a cost of less than 50 cents a pound.
p167
aVThat's the economic miracle
p168
aVof modern electrometallurgy.
p169
aa(lp170
VIt is this that caught and held my attention
p171
aVto the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery
p172
aVthat could capture this gigantic economy of scale.
p173
aVAnd I did.
p174
aVI made the battery all liquid \u2014
p175
aVliquid metals for both electrodes
p176
aVand a molten salt for the electrolyte.
p177
aVI'll show you how.
p178
aVSo I put low-density
p179
aVliquid metal at the top,
p180
aVput a high-density liquid metal at the bottom,
p181
aVand molten salt in between.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo now,
p184
aVhow to choose the metals?
p185
aVFor me, the design exercise
p186
aValways begins here
p187
aVwith the periodic table,
p188
aVenunciated by another professor,
p189
aVDimitri Mendeleyev.
p190
aVEverything we know
p191
aVis made of some combination
p192
aVof what you see depicted here.
p193
aVAnd that includes our own bodies.
p194
aVI recall the very moment one day
p195
aVwhen I was searching for a pair of metals
p196
aVthat would meet the constraints
p197
aVof earth abundance,
p198
aVdifferent, opposite density
p199
aVand high mutual reactivity.
p200
aVI felt the thrill of realization
p201
aVwhen I knew I'd come upon the answer.
p202
aVMagnesium for the top layer.
p203
aVAnd antimony
p204
aVfor the bottom layer.
p205
aVYou know, I've got to tell you,
p206
aVone of the greatest benefits of being a professor:
p207
aVcolored chalk.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VSo to produce current,
p212
aVmagnesium loses two electrons
p213
aVto become magnesium ion,
p214
aVwhich then migrates across the electrolyte,
p215
aVaccepts two electrons from the antimony,
p216
aVand then mixes with it to form an alloy.
p217
aVThe electrons go to work
p218
aVin the real world out here,
p219
aVpowering our devices.
p220
aVNow to charge the battery,
p221
aVwe connect a source of electricity.
p222
aVIt could be something like a wind farm.
p223
aVAnd then we reverse the current.
p224
aVAnd this forces magnesium to de-alloy
p225
aVand return to the upper electrode,
p226
aVrestoring the initial constitution of the battery.
p227
aVAnd the current passing between the electrodes
p228
aVgenerates enough heat to keep it at temperature.
p229
aa(lp230
VIt's pretty cool,
p231
aVat least in theory.
p232
aVBut does it really work?
p233
aVSo what to do next?
p234
aVWe go to the laboratory.
p235
aVNow do I hire seasoned professionals?
p236
aVNo, I hire a student
p237
aVand mentor him,
p238
aVteach him how to think about the problem,
p239
aVto see it from my perspective
p240
aVand then turn him loose.
p241
aVThis is that student, David Bradwell,
p242
aVwho, in this image,
p243
aVappears to be wondering if this thing will ever work.
p244
aVWhat I didn't tell David at the time
p245
aVwas I myself wasn't convinced it would work.
p246
aa(lp247
VBut David's young and he's smart
p248
aVand he wants a Ph.D.,
p249
aVand he proceeds to build \u2014
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aVHe proceeds to build
p252
aVthe first ever liquid metal battery
p253
aVof this chemistry.
p254
aVAnd based on David's initial promising results,
p255
aVwhich were paid
p256
aVwith seed funds at MIT,
p257
aVI was able to attract major research funding
p258
aVfrom the private sector
p259
aVand the federal government.
p260
aVAnd that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people,
p261
aVa mix of graduate students, post-docs
p262
aVand even some undergraduates.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd I was able to attract really, really good people,
p265
aVpeople who share my passion
p266
aVfor science and service to society,
p267
aVnot science and service for career building.
p268
aVAnd if you ask these people
p269
aVwhy they work on liquid metal battery,
p270
aVtheir answer would hearken back
p271
aVto President Kennedy's remarks
p272
aVat Rice University in 1962
p273
aVwhen he said \u2014 and I'm taking liberties here \u2014
p274
aV"We choose to work on grid-level storage,
p275
aVnot because it is easy,
p276
aVbut because it is hard."
p277
aa(lp278
V(Applause)
p279
aa(lp280
VSo this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery.
p281
aVWe start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell.
p282
aVI called it the shotglass.
p283
aVWe've operated over 400 of these,
p284
aVperfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries \u2014
p285
aVnot just magnesium and antimony.
p286
aVAlong the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell.
p287
aVI call it the hockey puck.
p288
aVAnd we got the same remarkable results.
p289
aVAnd then it was onto the saucer.
p290
aVThat's 200 watt-hours.
p291
aVThe technology was proving itself
p292
aVto be robust and scalable.
p293
aVBut the pace wasn't fast enough for us.
p294
aVSo a year and a half ago,
p295
aVDavid and I,
p296
aValong with another research staff-member,
p297
aVformed a company
p298
aVto accelerate the rate of progress
p299
aVand the race to manufacture product.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo today at LMBC,
p302
aVwe're building cells 16 inches in diameter
p303
aVwith a capacity of one kilowatt-hour \u2014
p304
aV1,000 times the capacity
p305
aVof that initial shotglass cell.
p306
aVWe call that the pizza.
p307
aVAnd then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon.
p308
aVIt's going to be 36 inches in diameter.
p309
aVWe call that the bistro table,
p310
aVbut it's not ready yet for prime-time viewing.
p311
aVAnd one variant of the technology
p312
aVhas us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules,
p313
aVaggregating the modules into a giant battery
p314
aVthat fits in a 40-foot shipping container
p315
aVfor placement in the field.
p316
aVAnd this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt-hours \u2014
p317
aVtwo million watt-hours.
p318
aVThat's enough energy
p319
aVto meet the daily electrical needs
p320
aVof 200 American households.
p321
aVSo here you have it, grid-level storage:
p322
aVsilent, emissions-free,
p323
aVno moving parts,
p324
aVremotely controlled,
p325
aVdesigned to the market price point
p326
aVwithout subsidy.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo what have we learned from all this?
p329
aV(Applause)
p330
aVSo what have we learned from all this?
p331
aVLet me share with you
p332
aVsome of the surprises, the heterodoxies.
p333
aVThey lie beyond the visible.
p334
aVTemperature:
p335
aVConventional wisdom says set it low,
p336
aVat or near room temperature,
p337
aVand then install a control system to keep it there.
p338
aVAvoid thermal runaway.
p339
aVLiquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature
p340
aVwith minimum regulation.
p341
aVOur battery can handle the very high temperature rises
p342
aVthat come from current surges.
p343
aVScaling: Conventional wisdom says
p344
aVreduce cost by producing many.
p345
aVLiquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost
p346
aVby producing fewer, but they'll be larger.
p347
aVAnd finally, human resources:
p348
aVConventional wisdom says
p349
aVhire battery experts,
p350
aVseasoned professionals,
p351
aVwho can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge.
p352
aVTo develop liquid metal battery,
p353
aVI hired students and post-docs and mentored them.
p354
aVIn a battery,
p355
aVI strive to maximize electrical potential;
p356
aVwhen mentoring,
p357
aVI strive to maximize human potential.
p358
aVSo you see,
p359
aVthe liquid metal battery story
p360
aVis more than an account
p361
aVof inventing technology,
p362
aVit's a blueprint
p363
aVfor inventing inventors, full-spectrum.

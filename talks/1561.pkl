VSome years ago, I set out to try to understand
p5
aVif there was a possibility to develop biofuels
p6
aVon a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels
p7
aVbut not compete with agriculture for water,
p8
aVfertilizer or land.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo here's what I came up with.
p11
aVImagine that we build an enclosure where we put it
p12
aVjust underwater, and we fill it with wastewater
p13
aVand some form of microalgae that produces oil,
p14
aVand we make it out of some kind of flexible material
p15
aVthat moves with waves underwater,
p16
aVand the system that we're going to build, of course,
p17
aVwill use solar energy to grow the algae,
p18
aVand they use CO2, which is good,
p19
aVand they produce oxygen as they grow.
p20
aVThe algae that grow are in a container that
p21
aVdistributes the heat to the surrounding water,
p22
aVand you can harvest them and make biofuels
p23
aVand cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed,
p24
aVand of course you'd have to make a large area of this,
p25
aVso you'd have to worry about other stakeholders
p26
aVlike fishermen and ships and such things, but hey,
p27
aVwe're talking about biofuels,
p28
aVand we know the importance of potentially getting
p29
aVan alternative liquid fuel.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhy are we talking about microalgae?
p32
aVHere you see a graph showing you the different types
p33
aVof crops that are being considered for making biofuels,
p34
aVso you can see some things like soybean,
p35
aVwhich makes 50 gallons per acre per year,
p36
aVor sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm, and that
p37
aVtall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute.
p38
aVThat is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000
p39
aVand 5,000 gallons per acre per year,
p40
aVcompared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo what are microalgae? Microalgae are micro \u2014
p43
aVthat is, they're extremely small, as you can see here
p44
aVa picture of those single-celled organisms
p45
aVcompared to a human hair.
p46
aVThose small organisms have been around
p47
aVfor millions of years and there's thousands
p48
aVof different species of microalgae in the world,
p49
aVsome of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet,
p50
aVand produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, why do we want to do this offshore?
p53
aVWell, the reason we're doing this offshore is because
p54
aVif you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice,
p55
aVbecause we're going to use waste water, as I suggested,
p56
aVand if you look at where most of the waste water
p57
aVtreatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities.
p58
aVThis is the city of San Francisco, which has 900 miles
p59
aVof sewer pipes under the city already,
p60
aVand it releases its waste water offshore.
p61
aVSo different cities around the world treat their waste water
p62
aVdifferently. Some cities process it.
p63
aVSome cities just release the water.
p64
aVBut in all cases, the water that's released is
p65
aVperfectly adequate for growing microalgae.
p66
aVSo let's envision what the system might look like.
p67
aVWe call it OMEGA, which is an acronym for
p68
aVOffshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae.
p69
aVAt NASA, you have to have good acronyms.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo how does it work? I sort of showed you how it works already.
p72
aVWe put waste water and some source of CO2
p73
aVinto our floating structure,
p74
aVand the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow,
p75
aVand they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off
p76
aVinto the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.
p77
aVThey of course use solar energy to grow,
p78
aVand the wave energy on the surface provides energy
p79
aVfor mixing the algae, and the temperature
p80
aVis controlled by the surrounding water temperature.
p81
aVThe algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned,
p82
aVand they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and
p83
aVother bi-algal products of interest.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd the system is contained. What do I mean by that?
p86
aVIt's modular. Let's say something happens that's
p87
aVtotally unexpected to one of the modules.
p88
aVIt leaks. It's struck by lightning.
p89
aVThe waste water that leaks out is water that already now
p90
aVgoes into that coastal environment, and
p91
aVthe algae that leak out are biodegradable,
p92
aVand because they're living in waste water,
p93
aVthey're fresh water algae, which means they can't
p94
aVlive in salt water, so they die.
p95
aVThe plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of
p96
aVwell-known plastic that we have good experience with, and
p97
aVwe'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about
p100
aVthis system that I'm showing you, and that is to say
p101
aVwe need to think in terms of the water, the fresh water,
p102
aVwhich is also going to be an issue in the future,
p103
aVand we're working on methods now
p104
aVfor recovering the waste water.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe other thing to consider is the structure itself.
p107
aVIt provides a surface for things in the ocean,
p108
aVand this surface, which is covered by seaweeds
p109
aVand other organisms in the ocean,
p110
aVwill become enhanced marine habitat
p111
aVso it increases biodiversity.
p112
aVAnd finally, because it's an offshore structure,
p113
aVwe can think in terms of how it might contribute
p114
aVto an aquaculture activity offshore.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo you're probably thinking, "Gee, this sounds
p117
aVlike a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real?"
p118
aVWell, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz
p119
aVat the California Fish and Game facility,
p120
aVand that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks
p121
aVto test some of these ideas.
p122
aVWe also set up experiments in San Francisco
p123
aVat one of the three waste water treatment plants,
p124
aVagain a facility to test ideas.
p125
aVAnd finally, we wanted to see where we could look at
p126
aVwhat the impact of this structure would be
p127
aVin the marine environment, and we set up a field site
p128
aVat a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab
p129
aVin Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harbor
p130
aVto see what impact this would have on marine organisms.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks.
p133
aVIt was a place where we were growing algae
p134
aVand welding plastic and building tools
p135
aVand making a lot of mistakes,
p136
aVor, as Edison said, we were
p137
aVfinding the 10,000 ways that the system wouldn't work.
p138
aVNow, we grew algae in waste water, and we built tools
p139
aVthat allowed us to get into the lives of algae
p140
aVso that we could monitor the way they grow,
p141
aVwhat makes them happy, how do we make sure that
p142
aVwe're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive.
p143
aVSo the most important feature that we needed to develop were these
p144
aVso-called photobioreactors, or PBRs.
p145
aVThese were the structures that would be floating at the
p146
aVsurface made out of some inexpensive plastic material
p147
aVthat'll allow the algae to grow, and we had built lots and lots
p148
aVof designs, most of which were horrible failures,
p149
aVand when we finally got to a design that worked,
p150
aVat about 30 gallons, we scaled it up
p151
aVto 450 gallons in San Francisco.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo let me show you how the system works.
p154
aVWe basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it,
p155
aVand we circulate it through this floating structure,
p156
aVthis tubular, flexible plastic structure,
p157
aVand it circulates through this thing,
p158
aVand there's sunlight of course, it's at the surface,
p159
aVand the algae grow on the nutrients.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag.
p162
aVThe algae are not going to suffocate because of CO2,
p163
aVas we would.
p164
aVThey suffocate because they produce oxygen, and they
p165
aVdon't really suffocate, but the oxygen that they produce
p166
aVis problematic, and they use up all the CO2.
p167
aVSo the next thing we had to figure out was how we could
p168
aVremove the oxygen, which we did by building this column
p169
aVwhich circulated some of the water,
p170
aVand put back CO2, which we did by bubbling the system
p171
aVbefore we recirculated the water.
p172
aVAnd what you see here is the prototype,
p173
aVwhich was the first attempt at building this type of column.
p174
aVThe larger column that we then installed in San Francisco
p175
aVin the installed system.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo the column actually had another very nice feature,
p178
aVand that is the algae settle in the column,
p179
aVand this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass
p180
aVin a context where we could easily harvest it.
p181
aVSo we would remove the algaes that concentrated
p182
aVin the bottom of this column, and then we could
p183
aVharvest that by a procedure where you float the algae
p184
aVto the surface and can skim it off with a net.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact
p187
aVof this system in the marine environment,
p188
aVand I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site
p189
aVin Moss Landing Marine Lab.
p190
aVWell, we found of course that this material became
p191
aVovergrown with algae, and we needed then to develop
p192
aVa cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how
p193
aVseabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you
p194
aVsee here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting,
p195
aVand would periodically work its way across this little
p196
aVfloating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy
p197
aVor train him to be able to clean the surface
p198
aVof these things, but that's for the future.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow really what we were doing,
p201
aVwe were working in four areas.
p202
aVOur research covered the biology of the system,
p203
aVwhich included studying the way algae grew,
p204
aVbut also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae.
p205
aVWe did engineering to understand what we would need
p206
aVto be able to do to build this structure,
p207
aVnot only on the small scale, but how we would build it
p208
aVon this enormous scale that will ultimately be required.
p209
aVI mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals
p210
aVand looked at basically the environmental impact
p211
aVof the system, and finally we looked at the economics,
p212
aVand what I mean by economics is,
p213
aVwhat is the energy required to run the system?
p214
aVDo you get more energy out of the system
p215
aVthan you have to put into the system
p216
aVto be able to make the system run?
p217
aVAnd what about operating costs?
p218
aVAnd what about capital costs?
p219
aVAnd what about, just, the whole economic structure?
p220
aa(lp221
VSo let me tell you that it's not going to be easy,
p222
aVand there's lots more work to do in all four
p223
aVof those areas to be able to really make the system work.
p224
aVBut we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you
p225
aVthe artist's conception of how this system might look
p226
aVif we find ourselves in a protected bay
p227
aVsomewhere in the world, and we have in the background
p228
aVin this image, the waste water treatment plant
p229
aVand a source of flue gas for the CO2,
p230
aVbut when you do the economics of this system,
p231
aVyou find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work.
p232
aVUnless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water,
p233
aVsequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panels
p234
aVor wave energy or even wind energy,
p235
aVand if you start thinking in terms of
p236
aVintegrating all of these different activities,
p237
aVyou could also include in such a facility aquaculture.
p238
aVSo we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture
p239
aVwhere we're growing mussels or scallops.
p240
aVWe'd be growing oysters and things
p241
aVthat would be producing high value products and food,
p242
aVand this would be a market driver as we build the system
p243
aVto larger and larger scales so that it becomes, ultimately,
p244
aVcompetitive with the idea of doing it for fuels.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo there's always a big question that comes up,
p247
aVbecause plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation
p248
aVright now, and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle.
p249
aVWhat are we going to do with all this plastic that we're
p250
aVgoing to need to use in our marine environment?
p251
aVWell, I don't know if you know about this,
p252
aVbut in California, there's a huge amount of plastic
p253
aVthat's used in fields right now as plastic mulch,
p254
aVand this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses
p255
aVright along the surface of the soil, and this provides
p256
aVwarming the soil to increase the growing season,
p257
aVit allows us to control weeds,
p258
aVand, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient.
p259
aVSo the OMEGA system will be part
p260
aVof this type of an outcome, and that when we're finished
p261
aVusing it in the marine environment, we'll be using it,
p262
aVhopefully, on fields.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhere are we going to put this,
p265
aVand what will it look like offshore?
p266
aVHere's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.
p267
aVSan Francisco produces 65 million gallons a day
p268
aVof waste water. If we imagine a five-day retention time
p269
aVfor this system, we'd need 325 million gallons
p270
aVto accomodate, and that would be about 1,280 acres
p271
aVof these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay.
p272
aVWell, that's less than one percent
p273
aVof the surface area of the bay.
p274
aVIt would produce, at 2,000 gallons per acre per year,
p275
aVit would produce over 2 million gallons of fuel,
p276
aVwhich is about 20 percent of the biodiesel,
p277
aVor of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco,
p278
aVand that's without doing anything about efficiency.
p279
aa(lp280
VWhere else could we potentially put this system?
p281
aVThere's lots of possibilities.
p282
aVThere's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned.
p283
aVSan Diego Bay is another example,
p284
aVMobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay, but the reality is,
p285
aVas sea level rises, there's going to be lots and lots
p286
aVof new opportunities to consider. (Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VSo what I'm telling you about is a system
p289
aVof integrated activities.
p290
aVBiofuels production is integrated with alternative energy
p291
aVis integrated with aquaculture.
p292
aa(lp293
VI set out to find a pathway
p294
aVto innovative production of sustainable biofuels,
p295
aVand en route I discovered that what's really required
p296
aVfor sustainability is integration more than innovation.
p297
aa(lp298
VLong term, I have great faith
p299
aVin our collective and connected ingenuity.
p300
aVI think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish
p301
aVif we are radically open
p302
aVand we don't care who gets the credit.
p303
aVSustainable solutions for our future problems
p304
aVare going to be diverse
p305
aVand are going to be many.
p306
aVI think we need to consider everything,
p307
aVeverything from alpha to OMEGA.
p308
aVThank you. (Applause)
p309
aV(Applause)
p310
aVChris Anderson: Just a quick question for you, Jonathan.
p311
aVCan this project continue to move forward within
p312
aVNASA or do you need some very ambitious
p313
aVgreen energy fund to come and take it by the throat?
p314
aVJonathan Trent: So it's really gotten to a stage now
p315
aVin NASA where they would like to spin it out into something
p316
aVwhich would go offshore, and there are a lot of issues
p317
aVwith doing it in the United States because of limited
p318
aVpermitting issues and the time required to get permits
p319
aVto do things offshore.
p320
aVIt really requires, at this point, people on the outside,
p321
aVand we're being radically open with this technology
p322
aVin which we're going to launch it out there
p323
aVfor anybody and everybody who's interested
p324
aVto take it on and try to make it real.
p325
aVCA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.
p326
aVYou're publishing it.
p327
aVJT: Absolutely.
p328
aVCA: All right. Thank you so much.
p329
aVJT: Thank you. (Applause)

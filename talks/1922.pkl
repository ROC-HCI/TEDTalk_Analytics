VIntelligence \u2014 what is it?
p5
aVIf we take a look back at the history
p6
aVof how intelligence has been viewed,
p7
aVone seminal example has been
p8
aVEdsger Dijkstra's famous quote that
p9
aV"the question of whether a machine can think
p10
aVis about as interesting
p11
aVas the question of whether a submarine
p12
aVcan swim."
p13
aVNow, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,
p14
aVintended it as a criticism
p15
aVof the early pioneers of computer science,
p16
aVlike Alan Turing.
p17
aVHowever, if you take a look back
p18
aVand think about what have been
p19
aVthe most empowering innovations
p20
aVthat enabled us to build
p21
aVartificial machines that swim
p22
aVand artificial machines that [fly],
p23
aVyou find that it was only through understanding
p24
aVthe underlying physical mechanisms
p25
aVof swimming and flight
p26
aVthat we were able to build these machines.
p27
aVAnd so, several years ago,
p28
aVI undertook a program to try to understand
p29
aVthe fundamental physical mechanisms
p30
aVunderlying intelligence.
p31
aa(lp32
VLet's take a step back.
p33
aVLet's first begin with a thought experiment.
p34
aVPretend that you're an alien race
p35
aVthat doesn't know anything about Earth biology
p36
aVor Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,
p37
aVbut you have amazing telescopes
p38
aVand you're able to watch the Earth,
p39
aVand you have amazingly long lives,
p40
aVso you're able to watch the Earth
p41
aVover millions, even billions of years.
p42
aVAnd you observe a really strange effect.
p43
aVYou observe that, over the course of the millennia,
p44
aVEarth is continually bombarded with asteroids
p45
aVup until a point,
p46
aVand that at some point,
p47
aVcorresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,
p48
aVasteroids that are on
p49
aVa collision course with the Earth
p50
aVthat otherwise would have collided
p51
aVmysteriously get deflected
p52
aVor they detonate before they can hit the Earth.
p53
aVNow of course, as earthlings,
p54
aVwe know the reason would be
p55
aVthat we're trying to save ourselves.
p56
aVWe're trying to prevent an impact.
p57
aVBut if you're an alien race
p58
aVwho doesn't know any of this,
p59
aVdoesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,
p60
aVyou'd be forced to put together
p61
aVa physical theory that explains how,
p62
aVup until a certain point in time,
p63
aVasteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet
p64
aVmysteriously stop doing that.
p65
aVAnd so I claim that this is the same question
p66
aVas understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo in this program that I undertook several years ago,
p69
aVI looked at a variety of different threads
p70
aVacross science, across a variety of disciplines,
p71
aVthat were pointing, I think,
p72
aVtowards a single, underlying mechanism
p73
aVfor intelligence.
p74
aVIn cosmology, for example,
p75
aVthere have been a variety of different threads of evidence
p76
aVthat our universe appears to be finely tuned
p77
aVfor the development of intelligence,
p78
aVand, in particular, for the development
p79
aVof universal states
p80
aVthat maximize the diversity of possible futures.
p81
aVIn game play, for example, in Go \u2014
p82
aVeveryone remembers in 1997
p83
aVwhen IBM's Deep Blue beat  Garry Kasparov at chess \u2014
p84
aVfewer people are aware
p85
aVthat in the past 10 years or so,
p86
aVthe game of Go,
p87
aVarguably a much more challenging game
p88
aVbecause it has a much higher branching factor,
p89
aVhas also started to succumb
p90
aVto computer game players
p91
aVfor the same reason:
p92
aVthe best techniques right now for computers playing Go
p93
aVare techniques that try to maximize future options
p94
aVduring game play.
p95
aVFinally, in robotic motion planning,
p96
aVthere have been a variety of recent techniques
p97
aVthat have tried to take advantage
p98
aVof abilities of robots to maximize
p99
aVfuture freedom of action
p100
aVin order to accomplish complex tasks.
p101
aVAnd so, taking all of these different threads
p102
aVand putting them together,
p103
aVI asked, starting several years ago,
p104
aVis there an underlying mechanism for intelligence
p105
aVthat we can factor out
p106
aVof all of these different threads?
p107
aVIs there a single equation for intelligence?
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd the answer, I believe, is yes. ["F = T \u2207 S\u03c4"]
p110
aVWhat you're seeing is probably
p111
aVthe closest equivalent to an E = mc²
p112
aVfor intelligence that I've seen.
p113
aVSo what you're seeing here
p114
aVis a statement of correspondence
p115
aVthat intelligence is a force, F,
p116
aVthat acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.
p117
aVIt acts to maximize future freedom of action,
p118
aVor keep options open,
p119
aVwith some strength T,
p120
aVwith the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,
p121
aVup to some future time horizon, tau.
p122
aVIn short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.
p123
aVIntelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action
p124
aVand keep options open.
p125
aVAnd so, given this one equation,
p126
aVit's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?
p127
aVHow predictive is it?
p128
aVDoes it predict human-level intelligence?
p129
aVDoes it predict artificial intelligence?
p130
aVSo I'm going to show you now a video
p131
aVthat will, I think, demonstrate
p132
aVsome of the amazing applications
p133
aVof just this single equation.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology
p136
aVhas suggested that universes that produce
p137
aVmore disorder, or "entropy," over their lifetimes
p138
aVshould tend to have more favorable conditions
p139
aVfor the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves.
p140
aVBut what if that tentative cosmological connection
p141
aVbetween entropy and intelligence
p142
aVhints at a deeper relationship?
p143
aVWhat if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate
p144
aVwith the production of long-term entropy,
p145
aVbut actually emerges directly from it?
p146
aVTo find out, we developed a software engine
p147
aVcalled Entropica, designed to maximize
p148
aVthe production of long-term entropy
p149
aVof any system that it finds itself in.
p150
aVAmazingly, Entropica was able to pass
p151
aVmultiple animal intelligence tests, play human games,
p152
aVand even earn money trading stocks,
p153
aVall without being instructed to do so.
p154
aVHere are some examples of Entropica in action.
p155
aa(lp156
VJust like a human standing upright without falling over,
p157
aVhere we see Entropica
p158
aVautomatically balancing a pole using a cart.
p159
aVThis behavior is remarkable in part
p160
aVbecause we never gave Entropica a goal.
p161
aVIt simply decided on its own to balance the pole.
p162
aVThis balancing ability will have appliactions
p163
aVfor humanoid robotics
p164
aVand human assistive technologies.
p165
aVJust as some animals can use objects
p166
aVin their environments as tools
p167
aVto reach into narrow spaces,
p168
aVhere we see that Entropica,
p169
aVagain on its own initiative,
p170
aVwas able to move a large disk representing an animal
p171
aVaround so as to cause a small disk,
p172
aVrepresenting a tool, to reach into a confined space
p173
aVholding a third disk
p174
aVand release the third disk from its initially fixed position.
p175
aVThis tool use ability will have applications
p176
aVfor smart manufacturing and agriculture.
p177
aVIn addition, just as some other animals
p178
aVare able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope
p179
aVat the same time to release food,
p180
aVhere we see that Entropica is able to accomplish
p181
aVa model version of that task.
p182
aVThis cooperative ability has interesting implications
p183
aVfor economic planning and a variety of other fields.
p184
aa(lp185
VEntropica is broadly applicable
p186
aVto a variety of domains.
p187
aVFor example, here we see it successfully
p188
aVplaying a game of pong against itself,
p189
aVillustrating its potential for gaming.
p190
aVHere we see Entropica orchestrating
p191
aVnew connections on a social network
p192
aVwhere friends are constantly falling out of touch
p193
aVand successfully keeping the network well connected.
p194
aVThis same network orchestration ability
p195
aValso has applications in health care,
p196
aVenergy, and intelligence.
p197
aVHere we see Entropica directing the paths
p198
aVof a fleet of ships,
p199
aVsuccessfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal
p200
aVto globally extend its reach from the Atlantic
p201
aVto the Pacific.
p202
aVBy the same token, Entropica
p203
aVis broadly applicable to problems
p204
aVin autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.
p205
aa(lp206
VFinally, here we see Entropica
p207
aVspontaneously discovering and executing
p208
aVa buy-low, sell-high strategy
p209
aVon a simulated range traded stock,
p210
aVsuccessfully growing assets under management
p211
aVexponentially.
p212
aVThis risk management ability
p213
aVwill have broad applications in finance
p214
aVand insurance.
p215
aa(lp216
VAlex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen
p217
aVis that a variety of signature human intelligent
p218
aVcognitive behaviors
p219
aVsuch as tool use and walking upright
p220
aVand social cooperation
p221
aVall follow from a single equation,
p222
aVwhich drives a system
p223
aVto maximize its future freedom of action.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow, there's a profound irony here.
p226
aVGoing back to the beginning
p227
aVof the usage of the term robot,
p228
aVthe play "RUR,"
p229
aVthere was always a concept
p230
aVthat if we developed machine intelligence,
p231
aVthere would be a cybernetic revolt.
p232
aVThe machines would rise up against us.
p233
aVOne major consequence of this work
p234
aVis that maybe all of these decades,
p235
aVwe've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt
p236
aVin reverse.
p237
aVIt's not that machines first become intelligent
p238
aVand then megalomaniacal
p239
aVand try to take over the world.
p240
aVIt's quite the opposite,
p241
aVthat the urge to take control
p242
aVof all possible futures
p243
aVis a more fundamental principle
p244
aVthan that of intelligence,
p245
aVthat general intelligence may in fact emerge
p246
aVdirectly from this sort of control-grabbing,
p247
aVrather than vice versa.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnother important consequence is goal seeking.
p250
aVI'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals
p251
aVfollow from this sort of framework?
p252
aVAnd the answer is, the ability to seek goals
p253
aVwill follow directly from this
p254
aVin the following sense:
p255
aVjust like you would travel through a tunnel,
p256
aVa bottleneck in your future path space,
p257
aVin order to achieve many other
p258
aVdiverse objectives later on,
p259
aVor just like you would invest
p260
aVin a financial security,
p261
aVreducing your short-term liquidity
p262
aVin order to increase your wealth over the long term,
p263
aVgoal seeking emerges directly
p264
aVfrom a long-term drive
p265
aVto increase future freedom of action.
p266
aa(lp267
VFinally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,
p268
aVonce wrote that if human civilization were destroyed
p269
aVand you could pass only a single concept
p270
aVon to our descendants
p271
aVto help them rebuild civilization,
p272
aVthat concept should be
p273
aVthat all matter around us
p274
aVis made out of tiny elements
p275
aVthat attract each other when they're far apart
p276
aVbut repel each other when they're close together.
p277
aVMy equivalent of that statement
p278
aVto pass on to descendants
p279
aVto help them build artificial intelligences
p280
aVor to help them understand human intelligence,
p281
aVis the following:
p282
aVIntelligence should be viewed
p283
aVas a physical process
p284
aVthat tries to maximize future freedom of action
p285
aVand avoid constraints in its own future.
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you very much.

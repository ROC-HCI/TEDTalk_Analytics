VThis is very strange for me, because I\u2019m not used to doing this:
p5
aVI usually stand on the other side of the light,
p6
aVand now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...
p7
aVThe previous speaker has, I think,
p8
aVreally painted a very good background as to
p9
aVthe impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,
p10
aVand trying to find the answer to the big questions.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this,
p13
aVfeels like \u2014 there\u2019s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti,
p14
aVwho after many years of living in France \u2014 and learning, you know,
p15
aVstudying and working \u2014 he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?
p16
aVWhat have you done with so many years of being away?
p17
aVAnd he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.
p18
aVAnd obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?
p19
aVAnd we expected huge masterpieces!"
p20
aVBut what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces
p21
aVwas the culmination of a man\u2019s life, search, thought, everything \u2014
p22
aVjust in a reduced, small version.
p23
aVIn a way, I feel like that.
p24
aVI feel like I\u2019m coming home to talk about
p25
aVwhat I\u2019ve been away doing for 20 years.
p26
aVAnd I will start with a brief taster of what I\u2019ve been about:
p27
aVa handful of films \u2014 nothing much,
p28
aVtwo feature films and a handful of short films.
p29
aVSo, we\u2019ll go with the first piece.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Video) Woman: "I destroy lives," mum said.
p32
aVI love her, you know.
p33
aVShe\u2019s not even my real mum.
p34
aVMy real mum and dad dumped me
p35
aVand fucked off back to Nigeria.
p36
aVThe devil is in me, Court.
p37
aVCourt: Sleep.
p38
aVWoman: Have you ever been?
p39
aVCourt: Where?
p40
aVWoman: Nigeria.
p41
aVCourt: Never.
p42
aVMy mum wanted to,
p43
aVcouldn\u2019t afford it.
p44
aVWoman: Wish I could.
p45
aVI have this feeling I\u2019d be happy there.
p46
aVWhy does everyone get rid of me?
p47
aVCourt: I don't want to get rid of you.
p48
aVWoman: You don't need me.
p49
aVYou\u2019re just too blind to see it now.
p50
aa(lp51
VBoy: What do you do all day?
p52
aVMarcus: Read.
p53
aVBoy: Don't you get bored?
p54
aVAnd how come you ain't got a job anyway?
p55
aVMarcus: I am retired.
p56
aVBoy: So?
p57
aVMarcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.
p58
aVBoy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.
p59
aVMarcus: Because I do what I like?
p60
aVBoy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.
p61
aVAnd it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.
p62
aVMarcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.
p63
aVBoy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.
p64
aVMarcus: You\u2019re a rapper, am I right?
p65
aVBoy: Yeah.
p66
aVMarcus: A modern day poet.
p67
aVBoy: Yeah, you could say that.
p68
aVMarcus: So what do you talk about?
p69
aVBoy: What's that supposed to mean?
p70
aVMarcus: Simple. What do you rap about?
p71
aVBoy: Reality, man.
p72
aVMarcus: Whose reality?
p73
aVBoy: My fuckin' reality.
p74
aVMarcus: Tell me about your reality.
p75
aVBoy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.
p76
aVMarcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just \u2014
p77
aVBoy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.
p78
aVMarcus: With an AK-47?
p79
aVBoy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.
p80
aVMarcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?
p81
aVBoy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.
p82
aVMarcus: When a man resorts to profanities,
p83
aVit\u2019s a sure sign of his inability to express himself.
p84
aVBoy: See man, you\u2019re just taking the piss out of me now.
p85
aVMarcus: The Panthers.
p86
aVBoy: Panthers?
p87
aVAss kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit,
p88
aVand just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.
p89
aVFuckin\u2019 wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?
p90
aa(lp91
VDirector 1: I saw his last film.
p92
aVÉpuise, right?
p93
aVWoman 1: Yes.
p94
aVD1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.
p95
aVEpuisé \u2014 tired, exhausted, fed up.
p96
aVDirector 2: Can you not shut up?
p97
aVNow, you talk straight to me, what\u2019s wrong with my films?
p98
aVLet\u2019s go.
p99
aVW1: They suck.
p100
aVWoman 2: They suck? What about yours?
p101
aVWhat, what, what, what about, what?
p102
aVWhat do you think about your movie?
p103
aVD1: My movies, they are OK, fine.
p104
aVThey are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.
p105
aVWhat the fuck are you talking about?
p106
aVDid you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood
p107
aVto go and film something real?
p108
aVYou make people fuckin' sleep.
p109
aVDream about bullshit.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Applause)
p112
aa(lp113
VNewton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is
p114
aVtotally trying to capture what cinema is for me,
p115
aVand where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.
p116
aVThe first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria,
p117
aVthat she has a feeling she'll be happy there.
p118
aVThese are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.
p119
aVAnd that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.
p120
aVI've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.
p121
aVI've been away 20 years in total.
p122
aVAnd so it\u2019s really \u2014
p123
aVit's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997,
p124
aVwhich is the time of Abacha \u2014 the military dictatorship,
p125
aVthe worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.
p126
aVSo, for this girl to have these dreams
p127
aVis simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.
p128
aVHow \u2014 and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful,
p129
aVbecause you just need something to hold on to,
p130
aVespecially in a society where you feel alienated.
p131
aa(lp132
VWhich takes us to the next piece, where the young man
p133
aVtalks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,
p134
aVthe glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,
p135
aVand his reality.
p136
aVAgain, this was my \u2014 this was me talking about \u2014
p137
aVthis was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom,
p138
aVand there was this buzzword \u2014 and it was trying to say,
p139
aVwhat exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?
p140
aVAnd what would a child \u2014
p141
aVwhat does a child like Jamie \u2014 the young boy \u2014 think,
p142
aVI mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?
p143
aVWhat happens with that?
p144
aVWhat, of course, happens with that is violence,
p145
aVwhich we see when we talk about the ghettos
p146
aVand we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,
p147
aVand which eventually, when channeled, becomes,
p148
aVyou know, evolves and manifests itself as riots \u2014
p149
aVlike the one in France two years ago, where I live,
p150
aVwhich shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well,
p151
aVFrance is a liberal society."
p152
aVBut I lived in England for 18 years.
p153
aVI've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually
p154
aVthrown back 20 years, living in France.
p155
aVAnd then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question:
p156
aVWhat is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?
p157
aVThere's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends \u2014
p158
aVfellow filmmakers \u2014 talking about what cinema means.
p159
aVI suppose that will take me to my last piece \u2014
p160
aVwhat cinema means for me.
p161
aVMy life started as a \u2014 I started life in 1966,
p162
aVa few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years
p163
aVand it was three years of war.
p164
aVSo that whole thing,
p165
aVthat whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Video) Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.
p168
aVOnicha: Yes, mama.
p169
aVCommander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle,
p170
aVso you must get ready and willing to die.
p171
aVYou must get \u2014 ?
p172
aVChild Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.
p173
aVC: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.
p174
aVCS: The barrel of the gun!
p175
aVC: This is the gun.
p176
aVCS: This is the gun.
p177
aVC: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.
p178
aVThis is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.
p179
aVEzra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.
p180
aVAmphetamines.
p181
aVSoldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
p182
aVI say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
p183
aVWe went from one village to another \u2014 three villages.
p184
aVI don\u2019t remember how we got there.
p185
aVWitness: We walked and walked for two days.
p186
aVWe didn't eat.
p187
aVThere was no food, just little rice.
p188
aVWithout food \u2014 I was sick.
p189
aVThe injection made us not to have mind.
p190
aVGod will forgive us.
p191
aVHe knows we did not know. We did not know!
p192
aa(lp193
VCommittee Chairman: Do you remember January 6th, 1999?
p194
aVEzra: I don\u2019t remember.
p195

p199
aV\u266b No more trouble \u266b

p203
aVWho is she?
p204
aVMe.
p205
aVWhy you giving these to me?
p206
aVSo you can stop staring at me.
p207
aVMy story is a little bit complicated.
p208
aVI\u2019m interested.
p209
aVMariam is pregnant.
p210
aVYou know what you are? A crocodile.
p211
aVBig mouth. Short legs.
p212
aVIn front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward.
p213

p214
aVTroop, pay your last honor. Salute.
p215
aVOpen your eyes, Ezra.

VCommittee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission
p233
aVwill go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.
p234
aVMore than that, begin a healing process and finally to \u2014
p235
aVas an act of closure to a terrible period in this country\u2019s history.
p236
aVThe beginning of hope.
p237
aVMr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.
p238
aVState your name and age for the commission.
p239
aVEzra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.
p240
aVI am 15 or 16. I don\u2019t remember.
p241
aVAsk my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.
p242
aV(Sister: 16.)
p243
aVCC: Mr. Gelehun, I\u2019d like to remind you you\u2019re not on trial here
p244
aVfor any crimes you committed.
p245
aVE: We were fighting for our freedom.
p246
aVIf killing in a war is a crime,
p247
aVthen you have to charge every soldier in the world.
p248
aVWar is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.
p249
aVYou too are a retired General, not so?
p250
aVCC: Yes, correct.
p251
aVE: So you too must stand trial then.
p252
aVOur government was corrupt.
p253
aVLack of education was their way to control power.
p254
aVIf I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?
p255
aVCC: No, we don\u2019t.
p256
aVE: You are richer than us.
p257
aVBut we pay for school.
p258
aVYour country talks about democracy,
p259
aVbut you support corrupt governments like my own.
p260
aVWhy? Because you want our diamond.
p261
aVAsk if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?
p262
aVNo.
p263
aVCC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.
p264
aVYou are not on trial.
p265
aVE: Then let me go.
p266
aVCC: I can't do that, son.
p267
aVE: So you are a liar.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Applause)
p270
aa(lp271
VNA: Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here,
p272
aVis that while we\u2019re making all these huge advancements,
p273
aVwhat we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should \u2014
p274
aVAfrica should move forward, but we should remember,
p275
aVso we do not go back here again.
p276
aVThank you.
p277
aa(lp278
VEmeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Applause)
p281
aa(lp282
VOne of the themes that comes through very strongly
p283
aVin the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young
p284
aVthat have to play this role of being child soldiers.
p285
aVAnd considering where you are coming from,
p286
aVand when we consider the extent to which it\u2019s not taken as seriously
p287
aVas it should be, what would you have to say about that?
p288
aa(lp289
VNA: In the process of my research, I actually spent
p290
aVa bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.
p291
aVAnd I remember I met a lot of child soldiers \u2014
p292
aVex-combatants, as they like to be called.
p293
aVI met psychosocial workers who worked with them.
p294
aVI met psychiatrists who spent time with them,
p295
aVaid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.
p296
aVBut I remember on the flight back on my last trip,
p297
aVI remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself,
p298
aVif any kid in the West, in the western world,
p299
aVwent through a day of what any of those kids have gone through,
p300
aVthey will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.
p301
aVSo for me, the thought that we have all these children \u2014
p302
aVit\u2019s a generation, we have a whole generation of children \u2014
p303
aVwho have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage,
p304
aVand Africa has to live with that.
p305
aVBut I\u2019m just saying to factor that in,
p306
aVfactor that in with all this great advancement,
p307
aVall this pronouncement of great achievement.
p308
aVThat\u2019s really my thinking.
p309
aa(lp310
VEO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.
p311
aVThat was a very moving piece.
p312
aa(lp313
VNA: Thank you.
p314
aa(lp315
VEO: Thank you.

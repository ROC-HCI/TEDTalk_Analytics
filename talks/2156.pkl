VThe power of yet.
p5
aa(lp6
VI heard about a high school in Chicago
p7
aVwhere students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate,
p8
aVand if they didn't pass a course, they got the grade "Not Yet."
p9
aVAnd I thought that was fantastic,
p10
aVbecause if you get a failing grade, you think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere.
p11
aVBut if you get the grade "Not Yet",
p12
aVyou understand that you're on a learning curve.
p13
aVIt gives you a path into the future.
p14
aa(lp15
V"Not Yet" also gave me insight
p16
aVinto a critical event early in my career,
p17
aVa real turning point.
p18
aVI wanted to see
p19
aVhow children coped with challenge and difficulty,
p20
aVso I gave 10-year-olds
p21
aVproblems that were slightly too hard for them.
p22
aVSome of them reacted in a shockingly positive way.
p23
aVThey said things like, "I love a challenge,"
p24
aVor, "You know, I was hoping this would be informative."
p25
aVThey understood that their abilities could be developed.
p26
aVThey had what I call a growth mindset.
p27
aVBut other students felt it was tragic, catastrophic.
p28
aVFrom their more fixed mindset perspective,
p29
aVtheir intelligence had been up for judgment,
p30
aVand they failed.
p31
aVInstead of luxuriating in the power of yet,
p32
aVthey were gripped in the tyranny of now.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo what do they do next?
p35
aVI'll tell you what they do next.
p36
aVIn one study, they told us they would probably cheat the next time
p37
aVinstead of studying more if they failed a test.
p38
aVIn another study, after a failure,
p39
aVthey looked for someone who did worse than they did
p40
aVso they could feel really good about themselves.
p41
aVAnd in study after study, they have run from difficulty.
p42
aVScientists measured the electrical activity from the brain
p43
aVas students confronted an error.
p44
aVOn the left, you see the fixed-mindset students.
p45
aVThere's hardly any activity.
p46
aVThey run from the error.
p47
aVThey don't engage with it.
p48
aVBut on the right, you have the students with the growth mindset,
p49
aVthe idea that abilities can be developed.
p50
aVThey engage deeply.
p51
aVTheir brain is on fire with yet.
p52
aVThey engage deeply.
p53
aVThey process the error.
p54
aVThey learn from it and they correct it.
p55
aa(lp56
VHow are we raising our children?
p57
aVAre we raising them for now instead of yet?
p58
aVAre we raising kids who are obsessed with getting As?
p59
aVAre we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams?
p60
aVTheir biggest goal is getting the next A, or the next test score?
p61
aVAnd are they carrying this need for constant validation with them
p62
aVinto their future lives?
p63
aVMaybe, because employers are coming to me and saying,
p64
aV"We have already raised a generation
p65
aVof young workers who can't get through the day
p66
aVwithout an award."
p67
aa(lp68
VSo what can we do?
p69
aVHow can we build that bridge to yet?
p70
aa(lp71
VHere are some things we can do.
p72
aVFirst of all, we can praise wisely,
p73
aVnot praising intelligence or talent.
p74
aVThat has failed.
p75
aVDon't do that anymore.
p76
aVBut praising the process that kids engage in,
p77
aVtheir effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance,
p78
aVtheir improvement.
p79
aVThis process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient.
p80
aa(lp81
VThere are other ways to reward yet.
p82
aVWe recently teamed up with game scientists
p83
aVfrom the University of Washington
p84
aVto create a new online math game that rewarded yet.
p85
aVIn this game, students were rewarded for effort, strategy and progress.
p86
aVThe usual math game
p87
aVrewards you for getting answers right, right now,
p88
aVbut this game rewarded process.
p89
aVAnd we got more effort,
p90
aVmore strategies,
p91
aVmore engagement over longer periods of time,
p92
aVand more perseverance when they hit really, really hard problems.
p93
aa(lp94
VJust the words "yet" or "not yet," we're finding,
p95
aVgive kids greater confidence,
p96
aVgive them a path into the future that creates greater persistence.
p97
aVAnd we can actually change students' mindsets.
p98
aVIn one study, we taught them
p99
aVthat every time they push out of their comfort zone
p100
aVto learn something new and difficult,
p101
aVthe neurons in their brain can form new, stronger connections,
p102
aVand over time, they can get smarter.
p103
aa(lp104
VLook what happened: In this study,
p105
aVstudents who were not taught this growth mindset
p106
aVcontinued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition,
p107
aVbut those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades.
p108
aVWe have shown this now, this kind of improvement,
p109
aVwith thousands and thousands of kids, especially struggling students.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo let's talk about equality.
p112
aVIn our country, there are groups of students
p113
aVwho chronically underperform,
p114
aVfor example, children in inner cities,
p115
aVor children on Native American reservations.
p116
aVAnd they've done so poorly for so long
p117
aVthat many people think it's inevitable.
p118
aVBut when educators create growth mindset classrooms
p119
aVsteeped in yet,
p120
aVequality happens.
p121
aVAnd here are just a few examples.
p122
aVIn one year, a kindergarten class in Harlem, New York
p123
aVscored in the 95th percentile
p124
aVon the national achievement test.
p125
aVMany of those kids could not hold a pencil
p126
aVwhen they arrived at school.
p127
aVIn one year,
p128
aVfourth-grade students in the South Bronx, way behind,
p129
aVbecame the number one fourth-grade class in the state of New York
p130
aVon the state math test.
p131
aVIn a year, to a year and a half,
p132
aVNative American students in a school on a reservation
p133
aVwent from the bottom of their district to the top,
p134
aVand that district included affluent sections of Seattle.
p135
aVSo the Native kids outdid the Microsoft kids.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed.
p138
aVBefore, effort and difficulty
p139
aVmade them feel dumb, made them feel like giving up,
p140
aVbut now, effort and difficulty,
p141
aVthat's when their neurons are making new connections,
p142
aVstronger connections.
p143
aVThat's when they're getting smarter.
p144
aa(lp145
VI received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy.
p146
aVHe said, "Dear Professor Dweck,
p147
aVI appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research,
p148
aVand that's why I decided to put it into practice.
p149
aVI put more effort into my schoolwork,
p150
aVinto my relationship with my family,
p151
aVand into my relationship with kids at school,
p152
aVand I experienced great improvement in all of those areas.
p153
aVI now realize I've wasted most of my life."
p154
aa(lp155
VLet's not waste any more lives,
p156
aVbecause once we know
p157
aVthat abilities are capable of such growth,
p158
aVit becomes a basic human right for children, all children,
p159
aVto live in places that create that growth,
p160
aVto live in places filled with "yet".
p161
aa(lp162
VThank you.

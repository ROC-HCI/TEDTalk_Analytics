VImagine you are a part of a crew of astronauts
p5
aVtraveling to Mars or some distant planet.
p6
aVThe travel time could take a year
p7
aVor even longer.
p8
aVThe space on board and the resources
p9
aVwould be limited.
p10
aVSo you and the crew would have to figure out how to produce food
p11
aVwith minimal inputs.
p12
aVWhat if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds,
p13
aVand grow crops in a matter of hours?
p14
aVAnd what if those crops would then make more seeds,
p15
aVenabling you to feed the entire crew
p16
aVwith just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip?
p17
aa(lp18
VWell, the scientists at NASA actually figured out a way to do this.
p19
aVWhat they came up with was actually quite interesting.
p20
aVIt involved microorganisms,
p21
aVwhich are single-celled organisms.
p22
aVAnd they also used hydrogen from water.
p23
aVThe types of microbes that they used were called hydrogenotrophs,
p24
aVand with these hydrogenotrophs, you can create a virtuous carbon cycle
p25
aVthat would sustain life onboard a spacecraft.
p26
aVAstronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide,
p27
aVthat carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes
p28
aVand converted into a nutritious, carbon-rich crop.
p29
aVThe astronauts would then eat that carbon-rich crop
p30
aVand exhale the carbon out in the form of carbon dioxide,
p31
aVwhich would then be captured by the microbes,
p32
aVto create a nutritious crop,
p33
aVwhich then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide
p34
aVby the astronauts.
p35
aVSo in this way, a closed-loop carbon cycle is created.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo why is this important?
p38
aVWe need carbon to survive as humans,
p39
aVand we get our carbon from food.
p40
aVOn a long space journey,
p41
aVyou simply wouldn't be able to pick up any carbon along the way,
p42
aVso you'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board.
p43
aa(lp44
VThis is a clever solution, right?
p45
aVBut the thing is, that research didn't really go anywhere.
p46
aVWe haven't yet gone to Mars. We haven't yet gone to another planet.
p47
aVAnd this was actually done in the '60s and '70s.
p48
aVSo a colleague of mine, Dr. John Reed, and I,
p49
aVwere interested, actually, in carbon recycling here on Earth.
p50
aVWe wanted to come up with technical solutions
p51
aVto address climate change.
p52
aVAnd we discovered this research
p53
aVby reading some papers published in the '60s \u2014 1967 and later \u2014
p54
aVarticles about this work.
p55
aVAnd we thought it was a really good idea.
p56
aVSo we said, well, Earth is actually like a spaceship.
p57
aVWe have limited space and limited resources,
p58
aVand on Earth, we really do need to figure out
p59
aVhow to recycle our carbon better.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo we had the idea,
p62
aVcan we take some of these NASA-type ideas and apply them
p63
aVto our carbon problem here on Earth?
p64
aVCould we cultivate these NASA-type microbes
p65
aVin order to make valuable products here on Earth?
p66
aVWe started a company to do it.
p67
aVAnd in that company, we discovered that these hydrogenotrophs \u2014
p68
aVwhich I'll actually call nature's supercharged carbon recyclers \u2014
p69
aVwe found that they are a powerful class of microbes
p70
aVthat had been largely overlooked and understudied,
p71
aVand that they could make some really valuable products.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo we began cultivating these products, these microbes, in our lab.
p74
aVWe found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide
p75
aVusing these microbes.
p76
aVAnd we even made a protein-rich meal
p77
aVthat has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find
p78
aVin some animal proteins.
p79
aVWe began cultivating them even further,
p80
aVand we found that we can make oil.
p81
aVOils are used to manufacture many products.
p82
aVWe made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil,
p83
aVwhich can be used for flavoring and for fragrances,
p84
aVbut it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner
p85
aVor even as a jet fuel.
p86
aVAnd we made an oil that's similar to palm oil.
p87
aVPalm oil is used to manufacture
p88
aVa wide range of consumer and industrial goods.
p89
aa(lp90
VWe began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology,
p91
aVand we're currently working with them
p92
aVto bring some of these products to market.
p93
aVWe believe this type of technology can indeed help us
p94
aVprofitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products \u2014
p95
aVsomething that's beneficial for the planet
p96
aVbut also beneficial for business.
p97
aVThat's what we're doing today.
p98
aVBut tomorrow, this type of technology and using these types of microbes
p99
aVactually could help us do something even greater
p100
aVif we take it to the next level.
p101
aVWe believe that this type of technology
p102
aVcan actually help us address an issue with agriculture
p103
aVand allow us to create a type of agriculture that's sustainable,
p104
aVthat will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd why might we need a sustainable agriculture?
p107
aVWell, actually, it is estimated
p108
aVthat the population will reach about 10 billion by 2050,
p109
aVand we're projecting that we will need to increase food production
p110
aVby 70 percent.
p111
aVIn addition, we will need many more resources and raw materials
p112
aVto make consumer goods and industrial goods.
p113
aVSo how will we scale to meet that demand?
p114
aa(lp115
VWell, modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand.
p116
aVThere are a number of reasons why.
p117
aVOne of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters
p118
aVof greenhouse gases.
p119
aVIn fact, it emits more greenhouse gases
p120
aVthan our cars, our trucks, our planes
p121
aVand our trains combined.
p122
aVAnother reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land.
p123
aVWe have cleared 19.4 million square miles for crops and livestock.
p124
aVWhat does that look like?
p125
aVWell, that's roughly the size of South America and Africa combined.
p126
aa(lp127
VLet me give you a specific example.
p128
aVIn Indonesia, an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared
p129
aVtotaling the size of approximately Ireland,
p130
aVbetween 2000 and 2012.
p131
aVJust think of all of the species, the diversity,
p132
aVthat was removed in the process,
p133
aVwhether plant life, insects or animal life.
p134
aVAnd a natural carbon sink was also removed.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo let me make this real for you.
p137
aVThis clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations.
p138
aVAnd as I mentioned before,
p139
aVpalm oil is used to manufacture many products.
p140
aVIn fact, it is estimated that over 50 percent of consumer products
p141
aVare manufactured using palm oil.
p142
aVAnd that includes things like ice cream, cookies ...
p143
aVIt includes cooking oils.
p144
aVIt also includes detergents, lotions, soaps.
p145
aVYou and I both probably have numerous items
p146
aVin our kitchens and our bathrooms
p147
aVthat were manufactured using palm oil.
p148
aVSo you and I are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests.
p149
aa(lp150
VModern ag has some problems,
p151
aVand we need solutions if we want to scale sustainably.
p152
aVI believe that microbes can be a part of the answer \u2014
p153
aVspecifically, these supercharged carbon recyclers.
p154
aVThese supercharged carbon recyclers,
p155
aVlike plants, serve as the natural recyclers
p156
aVin their ecosystems where they thrive.
p157
aVAnd they thrive in exotic places on Earth,
p158
aVlike hydrothermal vents and hot springs.
p159
aVIn those ecosystems, they take carbon and recycle it
p160
aVinto the nutrients needed for those ecosystems.
p161
aVAnd they're rich in nutrients,
p162
aVsuch as oils and proteins, minerals and carbohydrates.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd actually, microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives.
p165
aVIf you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a Friday night,
p166
aVafter a long, hard work week,
p167
aVthen you are enjoying a product of microbes.
p168
aVIf you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery \u2014
p169
aVa product of microbes.
p170
aVOr bread, or cheese, or yogurt.
p171
aVThese are all products of microbes.
p172
aVBut the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers
p173
aVlies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours
p174
aVversus months.
p175
aVThat means we can make crops
p176
aVmuch faster than we're making them today.
p177
aVThey grow in the dark,
p178
aVso they can grow in any season
p179
aVand in any geography and any location.
p180
aVThey can grow in containers that require minimal space.
p181
aVAnd we can get to a type of vertical agriculture.
p182
aVInstead of our traditional horizontal agriculture
p183
aVthat requires so much land,
p184
aVwe can scale vertically,
p185
aVand as a result produce much more product per area.
p186
aa(lp187
VIf we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers,
p188
aVthen we wouldn't have to remove any more rainforests
p189
aVto make the food and the goods that we consume.
p190
aVBecause, at a large scale,
p191
aVyou can actually make 10,000 times more output per land area
p192
aVthan you could \u2014 for instance, if you used soybeans \u2014
p193
aVif you planted soybeans on that same area of land
p194
aVover a period of a year.
p195
aVTen thousand times over a period of a year.
p196
aVSo this is what I mean by a new type of agriculture.
p197
aVAnd this is what I mean by developing a system
p198
aVthat allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of 10 billion.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd what would be the products of this new type of agriculture?
p201
aVWell, we've already made a protein meal,
p202
aVso you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal,
p203
aVor even cornmeal, or wheat flour.
p204
aVWe've already made oils,
p205
aVso you can imagine something similar to coconut oil
p206
aVor olive oil or soybean oil.
p207
aVSo this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients
p208
aVthat would give us pasta and bread,
p209
aVcakes, nutritional items of many sorts.
p210
aVFurthermore, since oil is used to manufacture multiple other goods,
p211
aVindustrial products and consumer products,
p212
aVyou can imagine being able to make detergents, soaps, lotions, etc.,
p213
aVusing these types of crops.
p214
aa(lp215
VNot only are we running out of space,
p216
aVbut if we continue to operate under the status quo
p217
aVwith modern agriculture,
p218
aVwe run the risk of robbing our progeny of a beautiful planet.
p219
aVBut it doesn't have to be this way.
p220
aVWe can imagine a future of abundance.
p221
aVLet us create systems that keep planet Earth, our spaceship,
p222
aVnot only from not crashing,
p223
aVbut let us also develop systems and ways of living
p224
aVthat will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves
p225
aVand the 10 billion that will be on this planet by 2050.
p226
aa(lp227
VThank you very much.

These advantages included: 1) far higher energy efficiency in the CO2 conversion, resulting in ten times lower electrical power requirements for a system using knallgas microorganisms, than an equivalent system using algae; and thirty times lower power requirements than a system based on higher plants; 2) connected to advantage 1) \\u2013 the generation of waste heat that would need to be removed from the system was at least ten times higher for algae and plants than for knallgas microorganisms; 3) considerably lower weight and volume requirements for a CO2 system using knallgas microbes than one using algae or plants due to greater compactness of a knallgas microbe based system."}, {"is_pdf": false, "headline": "Microbes at Work", "link_url": "http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/gsl/microbes/", "eyebrow": null, "label": "EXPLORE", "note": "Learn.Genetics: Genetic Science Learning Center, 2016", "position": null, "blurb": "Without microbes, the earth would be filled with corpses.

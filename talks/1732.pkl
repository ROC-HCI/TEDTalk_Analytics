VI'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me,
p5
aVshe said, "Geoff, you watch the TED Talks."
p6
aa(lp7
VI said, "Yes, honey, I love TED Talks."
p8
aa(lp9
VShe said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented \u2014 "
p10
aa(lp11
VI said, "I know, I know." (Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VShe said, "They don't want, like, the angry black man."
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VSo I said, "No, I'm gonna be good, Honey,
p17
aVI'm gonna be good. I am."
p18
aVBut I am angry. (Laughter)
p19
aVAnd the last time I looked, I'm \u2014
p20
aa(lp21
V(Applause)
p22
aVSo this is why I'm excited but I'm angry.
p23
aVThis year, there are going to be millions of our children
p24
aVthat we're going to needlessly lose,
p25
aVthat we could \u2014 right now, we could save them all.
p26
aVYou saw the quality of the educators who were here.
p27
aVDo not tell me they could not reach those kids
p28
aVand save them. I know they could.
p29
aVIt is absolutely possible.
p30
aVWhy haven't we fixed this?
p31
aVThose of us in education have held on to a business plan
p32
aVthat we don't care how many millions of young people fail,
p33
aVwe're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work,
p34
aVand nobody is getting crazy about it \u2014 right? \u2014
p35
aVenough to say, "Enough is enough."
p36
aVSo here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense.
p37
aa(lp38
VYou know, I grew up in the inner city,
p39
aVand there were kids who were failing
p40
aVin schools 56 years ago when I first went to school,
p41
aVand those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later.
p42
aVAnd you know something about a lousy school?
p43
aVIt's not like a bottle of wine.
p44
aVRight? (Laughter)
p45
aVWhere you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right?
p46
aVThat's now how this thing \u2014 I mean, every single year,
p47
aVit's still the same approach, right?
p48
aVOne size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't,
p49
aVtough luck. Just tough luck.
p50
aVWhy haven't we allowed innovation to happen?
p51
aVDo not tell me we can't do better than this.
p52
aa(lp53
VLook, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years,
p54
aVand you say, "So what's the plan?"
p55
aVAnd they say, "We'll, we're going to do
p56
aVwhat we did last year this year."
p57
aVWhat kind of business model is that?
p58
aVBanks used to open and operate between 10 and 3.
p59
aVThey operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour.
p60
aVNow, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.
p61
aVThey don't need banks. They got no money in the banks.
p62
aVWho created that business model? Right?
p63
aVAnd it went on for decades.
p64
aVYou know why? Because they didn't care.
p65
aVIt wasn't about the customers.
p66
aVIt was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.
p67
aVHow could you go to the bank
p68
aVwhen you were at work? It didn't matter.
p69
aVAnd they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset
p70
aVhe can't go to the bank. Go find another bank.
p71
aVThey all operate the same way. Right?
p72
aVNow, one day, some crazy banker had an idea.
p73
aVMaybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work.
p74
aVThey might like that. What about a Saturday?
p75
aVWhat about introducing technology?
p76
aa(lp77
VNow look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit
p78
aVto you all I'm a little old.
p79
aVSo I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology,
p80
aVand when they first came out with those new contraptions,
p81
aVthese tellers that you put in a card and they give you money,
p82
aVI was like, "There's no way that machine is going to count that money right.
p83
aVI am never using that, right?"
p84
aa(lp85
VSo technology has changed. Things have changed.
p86
aVYet not in education. Why?
p87
aVWhy is it that when we had rotary phones,
p88
aVwhen we were having folks being crippled by polio,
p89
aVthat we were teaching
p90
aVthe same way then that we're doing right now?
p91
aVAnd if you come up with a plan to change things,
p92
aVpeople consider you radical.
p93
aVThey will say the worst things about you.
p94
aVI said one day, well, look, if the science says \u2014
p95
aVthis is science, not me \u2014 that our poorest children
p96
aVlose ground in the summertime \u2014
p97
aVYou see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there.
p98
aVYou look at them in September, they've gone down.
p99
aVYou say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75
p100
aVwhen I was at the Ed School at Harvard.
p101
aVI said, "Oh, wow, this is an important study."
p102
aVBecause it suggests we should do something.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVEvery 10 years they reproduce the same study.
p105
aVIt says exactly the same thing:
p106
aVPoor kids lose ground in the summertime.
p107
aVThe system decides you can't run schools in the summer.
p108
aa(lp109
VYou know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?
p110
aVFor years I went to \u2014 Look, I went the Harvard Ed School.
p111
aVI thought I knew something.
p112
aVThey said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had \u2014
p113
aVbut let me tell you why that doesn't make sense.
p114
aVI never got that. I never got that,
p115
aVbecause anyone knows if you farm,
p116
aVyou don't plant crops in July and August.
p117
aVYou plant them in the spring.
p118
aVSo who came up with this idea? Who owns it?
p119
aVWhy did we ever do it?
p120
aVWell it just turns out in the 1840s we did have,
p121
aVschools were open all year. They were open all year,
p122
aVbecause we had a lot of folks who had to work all day.
p123
aVThey didn't have any place for their kids to go.
p124
aVIt was a perfect place to have schools.
p125
aVSo this is not something that is ordained
p126
aVfrom the education gods.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo why don't we? Why don't we?
p129
aVBecause our business has refused to use science.
p130
aVScience. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying,
p131
aV"Look, this works, right? We can do this."
p132
aVHow many places in America are going to change? None.
p133
aVNone. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right?
p134
aVYes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing.
p135
aVAs a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear.
p136
aa(lp137
VHere's what we know.
p138
aVWe know that the problem begins immediately.
p139
aVRight? This idea, zero to three.
p140
aVMy wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids,
p141
aVthree grown ones and a 15-year-old.
p142
aVThat's a longer story.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVWith our first kids, we did not know the science
p145
aVabout brain development.
p146
aVWe didn't know how critical those first three years were.
p147
aVWe didn't know what was happening in those young brains.
p148
aVWe didn't know the role that language,
p149
aVa stimulus and response, call and response,
p150
aVhow important that was in developing those children.
p151
aVWe know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing.
p152
aVWealthy people know. Educated people know.
p153
aVAnd their kids have an advantage.
p154
aVPoor people don't know,
p155
aVand we're not doing anything to help them at all.
p156
aVBut we know this is critical.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, you take pre-kindergarten.
p159
aVWe know it's important for kids.
p160
aVPoor kids need that experience.
p161
aVNope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist.
p162
aVWe know health services matter.
p163
aVYou know, we provide health services
p164
aVand people are always fussing at me about, you know,
p165
aVbecause I'm all into accountability and data
p166
aVand all of that good stuff, but we do health services,
p167
aVand I have to raise a lot of money.
p168
aVPeople used to say when they'd come fund us,
p169
aV"Geoff, why do you provide these health services?"
p170
aVI used to make stuff up. Right?
p171
aVI'd say, "Well, you know a child
p172
aVwho has cavities is not going to, uh,
p173
aVbe able to study as well."
p174
aVAnd I had to because I had to raise the money.
p175
aVBut now I'm older, and you know what I tell them?
p176
aVYou know why I provide kids with those health benefits
p177
aVand the sports and the recreation and the arts?
p178
aVBecause I actually like kids.
p179
aVI actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause)
p180
aa(lp181
VBut when they really get pushy, people really get pushy,
p182
aVI say, "I do it because you do it for your kid."
p183
aVAnd you've never read a study from MIT that says
p184
aVgiving your kid dance instruction
p185
aVis going to help them do algebra better,
p186
aVbut you will give that kid dance instruction,
p187
aVand you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction,
p188
aVand it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids
p189
aVhave the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children.
p190
aV(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VSo here's the other thing.
p193
aVI'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information,
p194
aVbecause you work at something, you think it's working,
p195
aVand you find out it's not working.
p196
aVI mean, you're educators. You work, you say,
p197
aVyou think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it.
p198
aVBut here's the problem with testing.
p199
aVThe testing that we do \u2014
p200
aVwe're going to have our test in New York next week \u2014
p201
aVis in April.
p202
aVYou know when we're going to get the results back?
p203
aVMaybe July, maybe June.
p204
aVAnd the results have great data.
p205
aVThey'll tell you Raheem really struggled,
p206
aVcouldn't do two-digit multiplication \u2014 so great data,
p207
aVbut you're getting it back after school is over.
p208
aVAnd so, what do you do?
p209
aVYou go on vacation. (Laughter)
p210
aVYou come back from vacation.
p211
aVNow you've got all of this test data from last year.
p212
aVYou don't look at it.
p213
aVWhy would you look at it?
p214
aVYou're going to go and teach this year.
p215
aVSo how much money did we just spend on all of that?
p216
aVBillions and billions of dollars
p217
aVfor data that it's too late to use.
p218
aVI need that data in September.
p219
aVI need that data in November.
p220
aVI need to know you're struggling, and I need to know
p221
aVwhether or not what I did corrected that.
p222
aVI need to know that this week.
p223
aVI don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late.
p224
aa(lp225
VBecause in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant.
p226
aVI can predict school scores.
p227
aVYou take me to any school.
p228
aVI'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling.
p229
aVAnd you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids
p230
aVwere on grade level.
p231
aVAnd I say, "Okay, what's the plan, what did we do
p232
aVfrom last year to this year?"
p233
aVYou say, "We're doing the same thing."
p234
aVI'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter)
p235
aVThis year, somewhere between 44
p236
aVand 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level.
p237
aVAnd I will be right every single time.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what?
p240
aVTeachers need real information right now
p241
aVabout what's happening to their kids.
p242
aVThe high stakes is today, because you can do something about it.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo here's the other issue that I just think
p245
aVwe've got to be concerned about.
p246
aVWe can't stifle innovation in our business.
p247
aVWe have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation.
p248
aVThey get angry if you do something different.
p249
aVIf you try something new, people are always like,
p250
aV"Ooh, charter schools." Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see.
p251
aVThis stuff hasn't worked for 55 years.
p252
aVLet's try something different. And here's the rub.
p253
aVSome of it's not going to work.
p254
aVYou know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work."
p255
aVA lot of them don't. They should be closed.
p256
aVI mean, I really believe they should be closed.
p257
aVBut we can't confuse figuring out the science
p258
aVand things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything.
p259
aVRight? Because that's not the way the world works.
p260
aa(lp261
VIf you think about technology,
p262
aVimagine if that's how we thought about technology.
p263
aVEvery time something didn't work,
p264
aVwe just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right?
p265
aVYou know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me \u2014
p266
aVthe latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.
p267
aVThey told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot
p268
aVyou'll never need another thing."
p269
aVThat thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.
p270
aVI was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing.
p271
aVDid anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.
p272
aVThe folks went out there. They kept inventing.
p273
aVThe fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop you
p274
aVfrom pushing the science forward.
p275
aa(lp276
VOur job as educators,
p277
aVthere's some stuff we know that we can do.
p278
aVAnd we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier,
p279
aVwe have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.
p280
aVWe've got to give them all of these opportunities.
p281
aVSo that we have to do. But this innovation issue,
p282
aVthis idea that we've got to keep innovating
p283
aVuntil we really nail this science down
p284
aVis something that is absolutely critical.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd this is something, by the way,
p287
aVthat I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field.
p288
aVAmerica cannot wait another 50 years to get this right.
p289
aVWe have run out of time.
p290
aVI don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff
p291
aVthat we are walking over right this very second,
p292
aVand if we allow folks to continue this foolishness
p293
aVabout saying we can't afford this \u2014
p294
aVSo Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars.
p295
aVWhat is five billion dollars to the United States?
p296
aVWhat did we spend in Afghanistan this year?
p297
aVHow many trillions? (Applause)
p298
aa(lp299
VWhen the country cares about something,
p300
aVwe'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye.
p301
aVWhen the safety of America is threatened,
p302
aVwe will spend any amount of money.
p303
aVThe real safety of our nation
p304
aVis preparing this next generation
p305
aVso that they can take our place
p306
aVand be the leaders of the world
p307
aVwhen it comes to thinking and technology and democracy
p308
aVand all that stuff we care about.
p309
aVI dare say it's a pittance,
p310
aVwhat it would require for us to really
p311
aVbegin to solve some of these problems.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter)
p314
aVSo, you guys, help me get there.
p315
aVThank you all very much. Thank you.
p316
aV(Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VJohn Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone?
p319
aa(lp320
VGeoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John,
p321
aV100 percent of our kids graduated high school
p322
aVlast year in my school.
p323
aVA hundred percent of them went to college.
p324
aVThis year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school.
p325
aVLast I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college.
p326
aVWe'd better get that other seven percent.
p327
aVSo that's just how this goes. (Applause)
p328
aa(lp329
VJL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school?
p330
aa(lp331
VGC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems
p332
aVwe have in this country is these kids, the same kids,
p333
aVthese same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school,
p334
aVthey drop out in record numbers.
p335
aVAnd so we've figured out that you've got to really design
p336
aVa network of support for these kids that in many ways
p337
aVmimics what a good parent does.
p338
aVThey harass you, right? They call you, they say,
p339
aV"I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?
p340
aVWhat are you talking about that you want to leave school?
p341
aVAnd you're not coming back here."
p342
aVSo a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem
p343
aVbecause Geoff is looking for you.
p344
aVThey're like, "I really can't come back." No. You'd better stay in school.
p345
aVBut I'm not kidding about some of this,
p346
aVand it gets a little bit to the grit issue.
p347
aVWhen kids know that you refuse to let them fail,
p348
aVit puts a different pressure on them,
p349
aVand they don't give up as easy.
p350
aVSo sometimes they don't have it inside,
p351
aVand they're, like, "You know, I don't want to do this,
p352
aVbut I know my mother's going to be mad."
p353
aVWell, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through.
p354
aVWe try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring
p355
aVand help and support, but also a set of encouragements
p356
aVthat say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard,
p357
aVbut we refuse to let you fail."
p358
aa(lp359
VJL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada.
p360
aVPlease give it up for him one more time.

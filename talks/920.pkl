VWell, indeed, I'm very, very lucky.
p5
aVMy talk essentially got written
p6
aVby three historic events
p7
aVthat happened within days of each other
p8
aVin the last two months \u2014
p9
aVseemingly unrelated, but as you will see,
p10
aVactually all having to do with
p11
aVthe story I want to tell you today.
p12
aVThe first one was actually a funeral \u2014
p13
aVto be more precise, a reburial.
p14
aVOn May 22nd, there was a hero's reburial
p15
aVin Frombork, Poland
p16
aVof the 16th-century astronomer
p17
aVwho actually changed the world.
p18
aVHe did that, literally,
p19
aVby replacing the Earth with the Sun
p20
aVin the center of the Solar System,
p21
aVand then with this simple-looking act,
p22
aVhe actually launched a scientific
p23
aVand technological revolution,
p24
aVwhich many call the Copernican Revolution.
p25
aVNow that was,
p26
aVironically, and very befittingly,
p27
aVthe way we found his grave.
p28
aVAs it was the custom of the time,
p29
aVCopernicus was actually
p30
aVsimply buried in an unmarked grave,
p31
aVtogether with 14 others
p32
aVin that cathedral.
p33
aVDNA analysis,
p34
aVone of the hallmarks
p35
aVof the scientific revolution
p36
aVof the last 400 years that he started,
p37
aVwas the way we found
p38
aVwhich set of bones
p39
aVactually belonged to the person
p40
aVwho read all those astronomical books
p41
aVwhich were filled with leftover hair
p42
aVthat was Copernicus' hair \u2014
p43
aVobviously not many other people
p44
aVbothered to read these books later on.
p45
aVThat match was unambiguous.
p46
aVThe DNA matched,
p47
aVand we know that this was indeed
p48
aVNicolaus Copernicus.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, the connection between
p51
aVbiology and DNA
p52
aVand life
p53
aVis very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus
p54
aVbecause, even back then,
p55
aVhis followers
p56
aVvery quickly made the logical step
p57
aVto ask: if the Earth is just a planet,
p58
aVthen what about planets around other stars?
p59
aVWhat about the idea of the plurality of the worlds,
p60
aVabout life on other planets?
p61
aVIn fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those
p62
aVvery popular books of the time.
p63
aVAnd at the time,
p64
aVpeople actually answered that question
p65
aVpositively: "Yes."
p66
aVBut there was no evidence.
p67
aVAnd here begins 400 years
p68
aVof frustration, of unfulfilled dreams \u2014
p69
aVthe dreams of Galileo, Giordano Bruno,
p70
aVmany others \u2014
p71
aVwhich never led to the answer
p72
aVof those very basic questions
p73
aVwhich humanity has asked all the time.
p74
aV"What is life? What is the origin of life?
p75
aVAre we alone?"
p76
aVAnd that especially happened in the last 10 years,
p77
aVat the end of the 20th century,
p78
aVwhen the beautiful developments
p79
aVdue to molecular biology,
p80
aVunderstanding the code of life, DNA,
p81
aVall of that seemed to actually
p82
aVput us, not closer,
p83
aVbut further apart from answering
p84
aVthose basic questions.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, the good news.
p87
aVA lot has happened in the last few years,
p88
aVand let's start with the planets.
p89
aVLet's start with the old Copernican question:
p90
aVAre there earths around other stars?
p91
aVAnd as we already heard,
p92
aVthere is a way in which
p93
aVwe are trying, and now able,
p94
aVto answer that question.
p95
aVIt's a new telescope.
p96
aVOur team, befittingly I think,
p97
aVnamed it after one of those dreamers
p98
aVof the Copernican time,
p99
aVJohannes Kepler,
p100
aVand that telescope's sole purpose
p101
aVis to go out,
p102
aVfind the planets that orbit
p103
aVother stars in our galaxy,
p104
aVand tell us how often do planets like our own Earth
p105
aVhappen to be out there.
p106
aVThe telescope is actually
p107
aVbuilt similarly to
p108
aVthe, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope,
p109
aVexcept it does have an additional lens \u2014
p110
aVa wide-field lens,
p111
aVas you would call it as a photographer.
p112
aVAnd if, in the next couple of months,
p113
aVyou walk out in the early evening
p114
aVand look straight up
p115
aVand place you palm like this,
p116
aVyou will actually be looking at the field of the sky
p117
aVwhere this telescope is searching for planets
p118
aVday and night, without any interruption,
p119
aVfor the next four years.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe way we do that, actually,
p122
aVis with a method, which we call the transit method.
p123
aVIt's actually mini-eclipses that occur
p124
aVwhen a planet passes in front of its star.
p125
aVNot all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented
p126
aVfor us to be able do that,
p127
aVbut if you have a million stars,
p128
aVyou'll find enough planets.
p129
aVAnd as you see on this animation,
p130
aVwhat Kepler is going to detect
p131
aVis just the dimming of the light from the star.
p132
aVWe are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this.
p133
aVAll the stars for Kepler are just points of light.
p134
aVBut we learn a lot from that:
p135
aVnot only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size.
p136
aVHow much of the light is being dimmed
p137
aVdepends on how big the planet is.
p138
aVWe learn about its orbit,
p139
aVthe period of its orbit and so on.
p140
aVSo, what have we learned?
p141
aVWell, let me try to walk you through
p142
aVwhat we actually see
p143
aVand so you understand the news
p144
aVthat I'm here to tell you today.
p145
aa(lp146
VWhat Kepler does
p147
aVis discover a lot of candidates,
p148
aVwhich we then follow up and find as planets,
p149
aVconfirm as planets.
p150
aVIt basically tells us
p151
aVthis is the distribution of planets in size.
p152
aVThere are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay.
p153
aVSo we count many, many such planets,
p154
aVand they have different sizes.
p155
aVWe do that in our solar system.
p156
aVIn fact, even back during the ancients,
p157
aVthe Solar System in that sense
p158
aVwould look on a diagram like this.
p159
aVThere will be the smaller planets, and there will be the big planets,
p160
aVeven back to the time of Epicurus
p161
aVand then of course Copernicus
p162
aVand his followers.
p163
aVUp until recently, that was the Solar System \u2014
p164
aVfour Earth-like planets with small radius,
p165
aVsmaller than about two times the size of the Earth \u2014
p166
aVand that was of course Mercury,
p167
aVVenus, Mars,
p168
aVand of course the Earth,
p169
aVand then the two big, giant planets.
p170
aVThen the Copernican Revolution
p171
aVbrought in telescopes,
p172
aVand of course three more planets were discovered.
p173
aVNow the total planet number
p174
aVin our solar system was nine.
p175
aVThe small planets dominated,
p176
aVand there was a certain harmony to that,
p177
aVwhich actually Copernicus was very happy to note,
p178
aVand Kepler was one of the big proponents of.
p179
aVSo now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets.
p180
aVBut up until, literally, 15 years ago,
p181
aVthat was all we knew about planets.
p182
aVAnd that's what the frustration was.
p183
aVThe Copernican dream was unfulfilled.
p184
aa(lp185
VFinally, 15 years ago,
p186
aVthe technology came to the point
p187
aVwhere we could discover a planet around another star,
p188
aVand we actually did pretty well.
p189
aVIn the next 15 years,
p190
aValmost 500 planets
p191
aVwere discovered orbiting other stars, with different methods.
p192
aVUnfortunately, as you can see,
p193
aVthere was a very different picture.
p194
aVThere was of course an explanation for it:
p195
aVWe only see the big planets,
p196
aVso that's why most of those planets
p197
aVare really in the category of "like Jupiter."
p198
aVBut you see, we haven't gone very far.
p199
aVWe were still back where Copernicus was.
p200
aVWe didn't have any evidence
p201
aVwhether planets like the Earth are out there.
p202
aVAnd we do care about planets like the Earth
p203
aVbecause by now we understood
p204
aVthat life as a chemical system
p205
aVreally needs a smaller planet
p206
aVwith water and with rocks
p207
aVand with a lot of complex chemistry
p208
aVto originate, to emerge, to survive.
p209
aVAnd we didn't have the evidence for that.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo today, I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse
p212
aVof what the new telescope, Kepler,
p213
aVhas been able to tell us in the last few weeks,
p214
aVand, lo and behold,
p215
aVwe are back to the harmony
p216
aVand to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus.
p217
aVYou can see here,
p218
aVthe small planets dominate the picture.
p219
aVThe planets which are marked "like Earth,"
p220
aV[are] definitely more than
p221
aVany other planets that we see.
p222
aVAnd now for the first time, we can say that.
p223
aVThere is a lot more work we need to do with this.
p224
aVMost of these are candidates.
p225
aVIn the next few years we will confirm them.
p226
aVBut the statistical result
p227
aVis loud and clear.
p228
aVAnd the statistical result is that
p229
aVplanets like our own Earth
p230
aVare out there.
p231
aVOur own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo the question is: what do we do next?
p234
aVWell, first of all, we can study them
p235
aVnow that we know where they are.
p236
aVAnd we can find those that we would call habitable,
p237
aVmeaning that they have similar conditions
p238
aVto the conditions
p239
aVthat we experience here on Earth
p240
aVand where a lot of complex chemistry can happen.
p241
aVSo, we can even put a number
p242
aVto how many of those planets
p243
aVnow do we expect our own
p244
aVMilky Way Galaxy harbors.
p245
aVAnd the number, as you might expect,
p246
aVis pretty staggering.
p247
aVIt's about 100 million such planets.
p248
aVThat's great news. Why?
p249
aVBecause with our own little telescope,
p250
aVjust in the next two years,
p251
aVwe'll be able to identify at least 60 of them.
p252
aVSo that's great because then
p253
aVwe can go and study them \u2014
p254
aVremotely, of course \u2014
p255
aVwith all the techniques that we already have
p256
aVtested in the past five years.
p257
aVWe can find what they're made of,
p258
aVwould their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane.
p259
aVWe know and expect that we'll see that.
p260
aa(lp261
VThat's great, but that is not the whole news.
p262
aVThat's not why I'm here.
p263
aVWhy I'm here is to tell you that the next step
p264
aVis really the exciting part.
p265
aVThe one that this step
p266
aVis enabling us to do is coming next.
p267
aVAnd here comes biology \u2014
p268
aVbiology, with its basic question,
p269
aVwhich still stands unanswered,
p270
aVwhich is essentially:
p271
aV"If there is life on other planets,
p272
aVdo we expect it to be like life on Earth?"
p273
aVAnd let me immediately tell you here,
p274
aVwhen I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita,"
p275
aVgood life, human life.
p276
aVI really mean life
p277
aVon Earth, past and present,
p278
aVfrom microbes to us humans,
p279
aVin its rich molecular diversity,
p280
aVthe way we now understand life on Earth
p281
aVas being a set of molecules and chemical reactions \u2014
p282
aVand we call that, collectively, biochemistry,
p283
aVlife as a chemical process,
p284
aVas a chemical phenomenon.
p285
aa(lp286
VSo the question is:
p287
aVis that chemical phenomenon universal,
p288
aVor is it something
p289
aVwhich depends on the planet?
p290
aVIs it like gravity,
p291
aVwhich is the same everywhere in the universe,
p292
aVor there would be all kinds of different biochemistries
p293
aVwherever we find them?
p294
aVWe need to know what we are looking for
p295
aVwhen we try to do that.
p296
aVAnd that's a very basic question, which we don't know the answer to,
p297
aVbut which we can try \u2014
p298
aVand we are trying \u2014 to answer in the lab.
p299
aVWe don't need to go to space
p300
aVto answer that question.
p301
aVAnd so, that's what we are trying to do.
p302
aVAnd that's what many people now are trying to do.
p303
aVAnd a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge
p304
aVthat we are trying to build as well.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo this is one example
p307
aVthat I want to show you here.
p308
aVWhen we think of what is necessary
p309
aVfor the phenomenon that we call life,
p310
aVwe think of compartmentalization,
p311
aVkeeping the molecules which are important for life
p312
aVin a membrane,
p313
aVisolated from the rest of the environment,
p314
aVbut yet, in an environment in which
p315
aVthey actually could originate together.
p316
aVAnd in one of our labs,
p317
aVJack Szostak's labs,
p318
aVit was a series of experiments
p319
aVin the last four years
p320
aVthat showed that the environments \u2014
p321
aVwhich are very common on planets,
p322
aVon certain types of planets like the Earth,
p323
aVwhere you have some liquid water and some clays \u2014
p324
aVyou actually end up with
p325
aVnaturally available molecules
p326
aVwhich spontaneously form bubbles.
p327
aVBut those bubbles have membranes
p328
aVvery similar to the membrane of every cell
p329
aVof every living thing on Earth looks like,
p330
aVlike this.
p331
aVAnd they really help molecules,
p332
aVlike nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA,
p333
aVstay inside, develop,
p334
aVchange, divide
p335
aVand do some of the processes that we call life.
p336
aa(lp337
VNow this is just an example
p338
aVto tell you the pathway
p339
aVin which we are trying to answer
p340
aVthat bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon.
p341
aVAnd in a sense, you can think of that work
p342
aVthat people are starting to do now around the world
p343
aVas building a bridge,
p344
aVbuilding a bridge from two sides of the river.
p345
aVOn one hand, on the left bank of the river,
p346
aVare the people like me who study those planets
p347
aVand try to define the environments.
p348
aVWe don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities,
p349
aVand there is not too much lab,
p350
aVand there is not enough human time
p351
aVto actually to do all the experiments.
p352
aVSo that's what we are building from the left side of the river.
p353
aVFrom the right bank of the river
p354
aVare the experiments in the lab that I just showed you,
p355
aVwhere we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth,
p356
aVand we hope to meet in the middle one day.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo why should you care about that?
p359
aVWhy am I trying to sell you
p360
aVa half-built bridge?
p361
aVAm I that charming?
p362
aVWell, there are many reasons,
p363
aVand you heard some of them
p364
aVin the short talk today.
p365
aVThis understanding of chemistry
p366
aVactually can help us
p367
aVwith our daily lives.
p368
aVBut there is something more profound here,
p369
aVsomething deeper.
p370
aVAnd that deeper, underlying point
p371
aVis that science
p372
aVis in the process of redefining life
p373
aVas we know it.
p374
aVAnd that is going to change
p375
aVour worldview in a profound way \u2014
p376
aVnot in a dissimilar way
p377
aVas 400 years ago,
p378
aVCopernicus' act did,
p379
aVby changing the way
p380
aVwe view space and time.
p381
aVNow it's about something else,
p382
aVbut it's equally profound.
p383
aVAnd half the time,
p384
aVwhat's happened
p385
aVis it's related this kind of
p386
aVsense of insignificance
p387
aVto humankind,
p388
aVto the Earth in a bigger space.
p389
aVAnd the more we learn,
p390
aVthe more that was reinforced.
p391
aVYou've all learned that in school \u2014
p392
aVhow small the Earth is
p393
aVcompared to the immense universe.
p394
aVAnd the bigger the telescope,
p395
aVthe bigger that universe becomes.
p396
aVAnd look at this image of the tiny, blue dot.
p397
aVThis pixel is the Earth.
p398
aVIt is the Earth as we know it.
p399
aVIt is seen from, in this case,
p400
aVfrom outside the orbit of Saturn.
p401
aVBut it's really tiny.
p402
aVWe know that.
p403
aVLet's think of life as that entire planet
p404
aVbecause, in a sense, it is.
p405
aVThe biosphere is the size of the Earth.
p406
aVLife on Earth
p407
aVis the size of the Earth.
p408
aVAnd let's compare it to the rest of the world
p409
aVin spatial terms.
p410
aVWhat if that
p411
aVCopernican insignificance
p412
aVwas actually all wrong?
p413
aVWould that make us more responsible
p414
aVfor what is happening today?
p415
aVLet's actually try that.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo in space, the Earth is very small.
p418
aVCan you imagine how small it is?
p419
aVLet me try it.
p420
aVOkay, let's say
p421
aVthis is the size
p422
aVof the observable universe,
p423
aVwith all the galaxies,
p424
aVwith all the stars,
p425
aVokay, from here to here.
p426
aVDo you know what the size of life
p427
aVin this necktie will be?
p428
aVIt will be the size
p429
aVof a single, small atom.
p430
aVIt is unimaginably small.
p431
aVWe can't imagine it.
p432
aVI mean look, you can see the necktie,
p433
aVbut you can't even imagine seeing
p434
aVthe size of a little, small atom.
p435
aVBut that's not the whole story, you see.
p436
aVThe universe and life
p437
aVare both in space and time.
p438
aVIf that was
p439
aVthe age of the universe,
p440
aVthen this is the age of life on Earth.
p441
aVThink about those oldest living things on Earth,
p442
aVbut in a cosmic proportion.
p443
aVThis is not insignificant.
p444
aVThis is very significant.
p445
aVSo life might be insignificant in size,
p446
aVbut it is not insignificant in time.
p447
aVLife and the universe
p448
aVcompare to each other like a child and a parent,
p449
aVparent and offspring.
p450
aa(lp451
VSo what does this tell us?
p452
aVThis tells us that
p453
aVthat insignificance paradigm
p454
aVthat we somehow got to learn
p455
aVfrom the Copernican principle,
p456
aVit's all wrong.
p457
aVThere is immense, powerful potential
p458
aVin life in this universe \u2014
p459
aVespecially now that we know
p460
aVthat places like the Earth are common.
p461
aVAnd that potential, that powerful potential,
p462
aVis also our potential,
p463
aVof you and me.
p464
aVAnd if we are to be stewards
p465
aVof our planet Earth
p466
aVand its biosphere,
p467
aVwe'd better understand
p468
aVthe cosmic significance
p469
aVand do something about it.
p470
aVAnd the good news is we can
p471
aVactually, indeed do it.
p472
aVAnd let's do it.
p473
aVLet's start this new revolution
p474
aVat the tail end of the old one,
p475
aVwith synthetic biology being
p476
aVthe way to transform
p477
aVboth our environment
p478
aVand our future.
p479
aVAnd let's hope that we can build this bridge together
p480
aVand meet in the middle.
p481
aa(lp482
VThank you very much.

VFor a long time,
p5
aVthere was me, and my body.
p6
aVMe was composed of stories,
p7
aVof cravings, of strivings,
p8
aVof desires of the future.
p9
aVMe was trying
p10
aVnot to be an outcome of my violent past,
p11
aVbut the separation that had already occurred
p12
aVbetween me and my body
p13
aVwas a pretty significant outcome.
p14
aVMe was always trying to become something, somebody.
p15
aVMe only existed in the trying.
p16
aVMy body was often in the way.
p17
aa(lp18
VMe was a floating head.
p19
aVFor years, I actually only wore hats.
p20
aVIt was a way of keeping my head attached.
p21
aVIt was a way of locating myself.
p22
aVI worried that [if] I took my hat off
p23
aVI wouldn't be here anymore.
p24
aVI actually had a therapist who once said to me,
p25
aV"Eve, you've been coming here for two years,
p26
aVand, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body."
p27
aVAll this time I lived in the city
p28
aVbecause, to be honest,
p29
aVI was afraid of trees.
p30
aVI never had babies
p31
aVbecause heads cannot give birth.
p32
aVBabies actually don't come out of your mouth.
p33
aa(lp34
VAs I had no reference point for my body,
p35
aVI began to ask other women about their bodies \u2014
p36
aVin particular, their vaginas,
p37
aVbecause I thought vaginas were kind of important.
p38
aVThis led to me writing "The Vagina Monologues,"
p39
aVwhich led to me obsessively and incessantly
p40
aVtalking about vaginas everywhere I could.
p41
aVI did this in front of many strangers.
p42
aVOne night on stage,
p43
aVI actually entered my vagina.
p44
aVIt was an ecstatic experience.
p45
aVIt scared me, it energized me,
p46
aVand then I became a driven person,
p47
aVa driven vagina.
p48
aa(lp49
VI began to see my body like a thing,
p50
aVa thing that could move fast,
p51
aVlike a thing that could accomplish other things,
p52
aVmany things, all at once.
p53
aVI began to see my body like an iPad or a car.
p54
aVI would drive it and demand things from it.
p55
aVIt had no limits. It was invincible.
p56
aVIt was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.
p57
aVI didn't heed it;
p58
aVno, I organized it and I directed it.
p59
aVI didn't have patience for my body;
p60
aVI snapped it into shape.
p61
aVI was greedy.
p62
aVI took more than my body had to offer.
p63
aVIf I was tired, I drank more espressos.
p64
aVIf I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places.
p65
aa(lp66
VOh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body,
p67
aVthe way an abusive parent
p68
aVcan sometimes have a moment of kindness.
p69
aVMy father was really kind to me
p70
aVon my 16th birthday, for example.
p71
aVI heard people murmur from time to time
p72
aVthat I should love my body,
p73
aVso I learned how to do this.
p74
aVI was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke.
p75
aVBut all that was just a more sophisticated way
p76
aVto manipulate my body \u2014
p77
aVa further disassociation,
p78
aVlike planting a vegetable field on a freeway.
p79
aa(lp80
VAs a result of me talking so much about my vagina,
p81
aVmany women started to tell me about theirs \u2014
p82
aVtheir stories about their bodies.
p83
aVActually, these stories compelled me around the world,
p84
aVand I've been to over 60 countries.
p85
aVI heard thousands of stories,
p86
aVand I have to tell you, there was always this moment
p87
aVwhere the women shared with me
p88
aVthat particular moment when she separated from her body \u2014
p89
aVwhen she left home.
p90
aVI heard about women being molested in their beds,
p91
aVflogged in their burqas,
p92
aVleft for dead in parking lots,
p93
aVacid burned in their kitchens.
p94
aVSome women became quiet and disappeared.
p95
aVOther women became mad, driven machines like me.
p96
aa(lp97
VIn the middle of my traveling,
p98
aVI turned 40 and I began to hate my body,
p99
aVwhich was actually progress,
p100
aVbecause at least my body existed enough to hate it.
p101
aVWell my stomach \u2014 it was my stomach I hated.
p102
aVIt was proof that I had not measured up,
p103
aVthat I was old and not fabulous and not perfect
p104
aVor able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.
p105
aVMy stomach was proof that I had failed,
p106
aVthat it had failed me, that it was broken.
p107
aVMy life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it.
p108
aVIn fact, it became so extreme
p109
aVI wrote a play about it.
p110
aVBut the more I talked about it,
p111
aVthe more objectified and fragmented my body became.
p112
aVIt became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity,
p113
aVsomething I was selling.
p114
aa(lp115
VThen I went somewhere else.
p116
aVI went outside
p117
aVwhat I thought I knew.
p118
aVI went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
p119
aVAnd I heard stories
p120
aVthat shattered all the other stories.
p121
aVI heard stories
p122
aVthat got inside my body.
p123
aVI heard about a little girl
p124
aVwho couldn't stop peeing on herself
p125
aVbecause so many grown soldiers
p126
aVhad shoved themselves inside her.
p127
aVI heard an 80-year-old woman
p128
aVwhose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets
p129
aVand twisted up on her head
p130
aVas the soldiers raped her like that.
p131
aVThere are thousands of these stories,
p132
aVand many of the women had holes in their bodies \u2014
p133
aVholes, fistula \u2014
p134
aVthat were the violation of war \u2014
p135
aVholes in the fabric of their souls.
p136
aVThese stories saturated my cells and nerves,
p137
aVand to be honest,
p138
aVI stopped sleeping for three years.
p139
aa(lp140
VAll the stories began to bleed together.
p141
aVThe raping of the Earth,
p142
aVthe pillaging of minerals,
p143
aVthe destruction of vaginas \u2014
p144
aVnone of these were separate anymore
p145
aVfrom each other or me.
p146
aVMilitias were raping six-month-old babies
p147
aVso that countries far away
p148
aVcould get access to gold and coltan
p149
aVfor their iPhones and computers.
p150
aVMy body had not only become a driven machine,
p151
aVbut it was responsible now
p152
aVfor destroying other women's bodies
p153
aVin its mad quest to make more machines
p154
aVto support the speed and efficiency of my machine.
p155
aa(lp156
VThen I got cancer \u2014
p157
aVor I found out I had cancer.
p158
aVIt arrived like a speeding bird
p159
aVsmashing into a windowpane.
p160
aVSuddenly, I had a body,
p161
aVa body that was pricked
p162
aVand poked and punctured,
p163
aVa body that was cut wide open,
p164
aVa body that had organs removed
p165
aVand transported and rearranged and reconstructed,
p166
aVa body that was scanned
p167
aVand had tubes shoved down it,
p168
aVa body that was burning from chemicals.
p169
aVCancer exploded
p170
aVthe wall of my disconnection.
p171
aVI suddenly understood that the crisis in my body
p172
aVwas the crisis in the world,
p173
aVand it wasn't happening later,
p174
aVit was happening now.
p175
aa(lp176
VSuddenly, my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere,
p177
aVthe cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed,
p178
aVthe cancer that gets inside people
p179
aVwho live down the streets from chemical plants \u2014 and they're usually poor \u2014
p180
aVthe cancer inside the coal miner's lungs,
p181
aVthe cancer of stress for not achieving enough,
p182
aVthe cancer of buried trauma,
p183
aVthe cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish,
p184
aVthe cancer in women's uteruses from being raped,
p185
aVthe cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness.
p186
aa(lp187
VIn his new and visionary book,
p188
aV"New Self, New World,"
p189
aVthe writer Philip Shepherd says,
p190
aV"If you are divided from your body,
p191
aVyou are also divided from the body of the world,
p192
aVwhich then appears to be other than you
p193
aVor separate from you,
p194
aVrather than the living continuum
p195
aVto which you belong."
p196
aVBefore cancer,
p197
aVthe world was something other.
p198
aVIt was as if I was living in a stagnant pool
p199
aVand cancer dynamited the boulder
p200
aVthat was separating me from the larger sea.
p201
aVNow I am swimming in it.
p202
aVNow I lay down in the grass
p203
aVand I rub my body in it,
p204
aVand I love the mud on my legs and feet.
p205
aVNow I make a daily pilgrimage
p206
aVto visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine,
p207
aVand I hunger for the green fields
p208
aVin the bush outside Bukavu.
p209
aVAnd when it rains hard rain,
p210
aVI scream and I run in circles.
p211
aa(lp212
VI know that everything is connected,
p213
aVand the scar that runs the length of my torso
p214
aVis the markings of the earthquake.
p215
aVAnd I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince.
p216
aVAnd the fire that burned in me
p217
aVon day three through six of chemo
p218
aVis the fire that is burning
p219
aVin the forests of the world.
p220
aVI know that the abscess
p221
aVthat grew around my wound after the operation,
p222
aVthe 16 ounces of puss,
p223
aVis the contaminated Gulf of Mexico,
p224
aVand there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me
p225
aVand dead floating fish.
p226
aVAnd the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication
p227
aVmade me scream out
p228
aVthe way the Earth cries out from the drilling.
p229
aa(lp230
VIn my second chemo,
p231
aVmy mother got very sick
p232
aVand I went to see her.
p233
aVAnd in the name of connectedness,
p234
aVthe only thing she wanted before she died
p235
aVwas to be brought home
p236
aVby her beloved Gulf of Mexico.
p237
aVSo we brought her home,
p238
aVand I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach
p239
aVbefore she died.
p240
aVAnd gratefully, it didn't.
p241
aVAnd she died quietly in her favorite place.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans,
p244
aVand this beautiful, spiritual friend
p245
aVtold me she wanted to do a healing for me.
p246
aVAnd I was honored.
p247
aVAnd I went to her house, and it was morning,
p248
aVand the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains.
p249
aVAnd my friend was preparing this big bowl,
p250
aVand I said, "What is it?"
p251
aVAnd she said, "It's for you.
p252
aVThe flowers make it beautiful,
p253
aVand the honey makes it sweet."
p254
aVAnd I said, "But what's the water part?"
p255
aVAnd in the name of connectedness,
p256
aVshe said, "Oh, it's the Gulf of Mexico."
p257
aVAnd I said, "Of course it is."
p258
aVAnd the other women arrived and they sat in a circle,
p259
aVand Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water.
p260
aVAnd she sang \u2014 I mean her whole body sang.
p261
aVAnd the other women sang
p262
aVand they prayed for me and my mother.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head,
p265
aVI realized that it held
p266
aVthe best and the worst of us.
p267
aVIt was the greed and recklessness
p268
aVthat led to the drilling explosion.
p269
aVIt was all the lies that got told
p270
aVbefore and after.
p271
aVIt was the honey in the water that made it sweet,
p272
aVit was the oil that made it sick.
p273
aVIt was my head that was bald \u2014
p274
aVand comfortable now without a hat.
p275
aVIt was my whole self
p276
aVmelting into Michaela's lap.
p277
aVIt was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf
p278
aVthat were falling down my cheek.
p279
aVIt was finally being in my body.
p280
aVIt was the sorrow
p281
aVthat's taken so long.
p282
aVIt was finding my place
p283
aVand the huge responsibility
p284
aVthat comes with connection.
p285
aVIt was the continuing devastating war in the Congo
p286
aVand the indifference of the world.
p287
aVIt was the Congolese women
p288
aVwho are now rising up.
p289
aVIt was my mother leaving,
p290
aVjust at the moment
p291
aVthat I was being born.
p292
aVIt was the realization
p293
aVthat I had come very close to dying \u2014
p294
aVin the same way that the Earth, our mother,
p295
aVis barely holding on,
p296
aVin the same way that 75 percent of the planet
p297
aVare hardly scraping by,
p298
aVin the same way
p299
aVthat there is a recipe for survival.
p300
aa(lp301
VWhat I learned
p302
aVis it has to do with attention and resources
p303
aVthat everybody deserves.
p304
aVIt was advocating friends
p305
aVand a doting sister.
p306
aVIt was wise doctors and advanced medicine
p307
aVand surgeons who knew what to do with their hands.
p308
aVIt was underpaid and really loving nurses.
p309
aVIt was magic healers and aromatic oils.
p310
aVIt was people who came with spells and rituals.
p311
aVIt was having a vision of the future
p312
aVand something to fight for,
p313
aVbecause I know this struggle isn't my own.
p314
aVIt was a million prayers.
p315
aVIt was a thousand hallelujahs
p316
aVand a million oms.
p317
aVIt was a lot of anger,
p318
aVinsane humor,
p319
aVa lot of attention, outrage.
p320
aVIt was energy, love and joy.
p321
aVIt was all these things.
p322
aVIt was all these things.
p323
aVIt was all these things
p324
aVin the water, in the world, in my body.

The play recounts <strong>tender, funny, gripping and horrifying stories she gathered from hundreds of women</strong> about their bodies, their sexual experiences, and yes, their vaginas. Since its first staging in 1996, it has been translated into more than 45 languages, performed in more than 120 countries and re-created as an HBO film. <br /><br /><em>The Vagina Monologues</em>&#39; success allowed Ensler to create <strong><a href=\\"http://www.vday.org/main.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">V-Day</a></strong>, <strong>a global activist movement to end violence against women and girls, which has so far raised $85 million</strong> to prevent violence and protect abused women.

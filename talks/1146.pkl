VThink about your day for a second.
p5
aVYou woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door,
p6
aVencountered new colleagues and had great discussions,
p7
aVand felt in awe when you found something new.
p8
aVBut I bet there's something you didn't think about today \u2014
p9
aVsomething so close to home
p10
aVthat you probably don't think about it very often at all.
p11
aVAnd that's that all the sensations, feelings,
p12
aVdecisions and actions
p13
aVare mediated by the computer in your head
p14
aVcalled the brain.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow the brain may not look like much from the outside \u2014
p17
aVa couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh,
p18
aVamorphous \u2014
p19
aVbut the last hundred years of neuroscience
p20
aVhave allowed us to zoom in on the brain,
p21
aVand to see the intricacy of what lies within.
p22
aVAnd they've told us that this brain
p23
aVis an incredibly complicated circuit
p24
aVmade out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.
p25
aVNow unlike a human-designed computer,
p26
aVwhere there's a fairly small number of different parts \u2014
p27
aVwe know how they work, because we humans designed them \u2014
p28
aVthe brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells,
p29
aVmaybe tens of thousands.
p30
aVThey come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules.
p31
aVAnd they project and connect to different brain regions,
p32
aVand they also change different ways in different disease states.
p33
aa(lp34
VLet's make it concrete.
p35
aVThere's a class of cells,
p36
aVa fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.
p37
aVIt's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia.
p38
aVIt's called the basket cell.
p39
aVAnd this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell
p40
aVthat we are learning about.
p41
aVNew ones are being discovered everyday.
p42
aVAs just a second example:
p43
aVthese pyramidal cells, large cells,
p44
aVthey can span a significant fraction of the brain.
p45
aVThey're excitatory.
p46
aVAnd these are some of the cells
p47
aVthat might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy.
p48
aVEvery one of these cells
p49
aVis an incredible electrical device.
p50
aVThey receive input from thousands of upstream partners
p51
aVand compute their own electrical outputs,
p52
aVwhich then, if they pass a certain threshold,
p53
aVwill go to thousands of downstream partners.
p54
aVAnd this process, which takes just a millisecond or so,
p55
aVhappens thousands of times a minute
p56
aVin every one of your 100 billion cells,
p57
aVas long as you live
p58
aVand think and feel.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo how are we going to figure out what this circuit does?
p61
aVIdeally, we could go through the circuit
p62
aVand turn these different kinds of cell on and off
p63
aVand see whether we could figure out
p64
aVwhich ones contribute to certain functions
p65
aVand which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.
p66
aVIf we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash,
p67
aVwhat they can initiate and sustain.
p68
aVIf we could turn them off,
p69
aVthen we could try and figure out what they're necessary for.
p70
aVAnd that's a story I'm going to tell you about today.
p71
aVAnd honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years,
p72
aVthrough an attempt to find ways
p73
aVof turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain
p74
aVon and off,
p75
aVboth to understand the science
p76
aVand also to confront some of the issues
p77
aVthat face us all as humans.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow before I tell you about the technology,
p80
aVthe bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room,
p81
aVif we live long enough,
p82
aVwill encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.
p83
aVAlready, a billion people
p84
aVhave had some kind of brain disorder
p85
aVthat incapacitates them,
p86
aVand the numbers don't do it justice though.
p87
aVThese disorders \u2014 schizophrenia, Alzheimer's,
p88
aVdepression, addiction \u2014
p89
aVthey not only steal our time to live, they change who we are.
p90
aVThey take our identity and change our emotions
p91
aVand change who we are as people.
p92
aVNow in the 20th century,
p93
aVthere was some hope that was generated
p94
aVthrough the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders,
p95
aVand while many drugs have been developed
p96
aVthat can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders,
p97
aVpractically none of them can be considered to be cured.
p98
aVAnd part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical.
p99
aVThis elaborate circuit
p100
aVmade out of thousands of different kinds of cell
p101
aVis being bathed in a substance.
p102
aVThat's also why, perhaps, most of the drugs, and not all, on the market
p103
aVcan present some kind of serious side effect too.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow some people have gotten some solace
p106
aVfrom electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain.
p107
aVAnd for Parkinson's disease,
p108
aVCochlear implants,
p109
aVthese have indeed been able
p110
aVto bring some kind of remedy
p111
aVto people with certain kinds of disorder.
p112
aVBut electricity also will go in all directions \u2014
p113
aVthe path of least resistance,
p114
aVwhich is where that phrase, in part, comes from.
p115
aVAnd it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix.
p116
aVSo again, we're sent back to the idea
p117
aVof ultra-precise control.
p118
aVCould we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go?
p119
aa(lp120
VSo when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago,
p121
aVI had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist,
p122
aVand the first thing I thought about was,
p123
aVif these neurons are electrical devices,
p124
aVall we need to do is to find some way
p125
aVof driving those electrical changes at a distance.
p126
aVIf we could turn on the electricity in one cell,
p127
aVbut not its neighbors,
p128
aVthat would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells,
p129
aVfigure out what they do and how they contribute
p130
aVto the networks in which they're embedded.
p131
aVAnd also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need
p132
aVin order to fix the circuit computations
p133
aVthat have gone awry.
p134
aVNow how are we going to do that?
p135
aVWell there are many molecules that exist in nature,
p136
aVwhich are able to convert light into electricity.
p137
aVYou can think of them as little proteins
p138
aVthat are like solar cells.
p139
aVIf we can install these molecules in neurons somehow,
p140
aVthen these neurons would become electrically drivable with light.
p141
aVAnd their neighbors, which don't have the molecule, would not.
p142
aVThere's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen,
p143
aVand that's the ability to get light into the brain.
p144
aVAnd to do that \u2014 the brain doesn't feel pain \u2014 you can put \u2014
p145
aVtaking advantage of all the effort
p146
aVthat's gone into the Internet and communications and so on \u2014
p147
aVoptical fibers connected to lasers
p148
aVthat you can use to activate, in animal models for example,
p149
aVin pre-clinical studies,
p150
aVthese neurons and to see what they do.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo how do we do this?
p153
aVAround 2004,
p154
aVin collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth,
p155
aVthis vision came to fruition.
p156
aVThere's a certain alga that swims in the wild,
p157
aVand it needs to navigate towards light
p158
aVin order to photosynthesize optimally.
p159
aVAnd it senses light with a little eye-spot,
p160
aVwhich works not unlike how our eye works.
p161
aVIn its membrane, or its boundary,
p162
aVit contains little proteins
p163
aVthat indeed can convert light into electricity.
p164
aVSo these molecules are called channelrhodopsins.
p165
aVAnd each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.
p166
aVWhen blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole
p167
aVand allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot,
p168
aVand that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal
p169
aVjust like a solar cell charging up a battery.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo what we need to do is to take these molecules
p172
aVand somehow install them in neurons.
p173
aVAnd because it's a protein,
p174
aVit's encoded for in the DNA of this organism.
p175
aVSo all we've got to do is take that DNA,
p176
aVput it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus,
p177
aVand put it into neurons.
p178
aVSo it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy,
p179
aVand lots of viruses were coming along.
p180
aVSo this turned out to be very simple to do.
p181
aVAnd early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004,
p182
aVwe gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.
p183
aVYou take this DNA and you put it into a neuron.
p184
aVThe neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery
p185
aVto fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins
p186
aVand install them all over the cell,
p187
aVlike putting solar panels on a roof,
p188
aVand the next thing you know,
p189
aVyou have a neuron which can be activated with light.
p190
aVSo this is very powerful.
p191
aa(lp192
VOne of the tricks you have to do
p193
aVis to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want
p194
aVand not all the other neighbors.
p195
aVAnd you can do that; you can tweak the viruses
p196
aVso they hit just some cells and not others.
p197
aVAnd there's other genetic tricks you can play
p198
aVin order to get light-activated cells.
p199
aVThis field has now come to be known as optogenetics.
p200
aVAnd just as one example of the kind of thing you can do,
p201
aVyou can take a complex network,
p202
aVuse one of these viruses to deliver the gene
p203
aVjust to one kind of cell in this dense network.
p204
aVAnd then when you shine light on the entire network,
p205
aVjust that cell type will be activated.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier \u2014
p208
aVthe one that's atrophied in schizophrenia
p209
aVand the one that is inhibitory.
p210
aVIf we can deliver that gene to these cells \u2014
p211
aVand they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course \u2014
p212
aVand then flash blue light over the entire brain network,
p213
aVjust these cells are going to be driven.
p214
aVAnd when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal,
p215
aVso they don't seem to be averse against that.
p216
aVNot only can you use this to study what these cells do,
p217
aVwhat their power is in computing in the brain,
p218
aVbut you can also use this to try to figure out \u2014
p219
aVwell maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells,
p220
aVif indeed they're atrophied.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow I want to tell you a couple of short stories
p223
aVabout how we're using this,
p224
aVboth at the scientific, clinical and pre-clinical levels.
p225
aVOne of the questions we've confronted
p226
aVis, what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward?
p227
aVBecause if you could find those,
p228
aVthose would be some of the signals that could drive learning.
p229
aVThe brain will do more of whatever got that reward.
p230
aVAnd also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.
p231
aVSo if we could figure out what cells they are,
p232
aVwe could maybe find new targets
p233
aVfor which drugs could be designed or screened against,
p234
aVor maybe places where electrodes could be put in
p235
aVfor people who have very severe disability.
p236
aVSo to do that, we came up with a very simple paradigm
p237
aVin collaboration with the Fiorella group,
p238
aVwhere one side of this little box,
p239
aVif the animal goes there, the animal gets a pulse of light
p240
aVin order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.
p241
aVSo if these cells can mediate reward,
p242
aVthe animal should go there more and more.
p243
aVAnd so that's what happens.
p244
aa(lp245
VThis animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there,
p246
aVand he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that.
p247
aVAnd he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times.
p248
aVThese are the dopamine neurons,
p249
aVwhich some of you may have heard about, in some of the pleasure centers in the brain.
p250
aVNow we've shown that a brief activation of these
p251
aVis enough, indeed, to drive learning.
p252
aVNow we can generalize the idea.
p253
aVInstead of one point in the brain,
p254
aVwe can devise devices that span the brain,
p255
aVthat can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns \u2014
p256
aVarrays of optical fibers,
p257
aVeach coupled to its own independent miniature light source.
p258
aVAnd then we can try to do things in vivo
p259
aVthat have only been done to-date in a dish \u2014
p260
aVlike high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain
p261
aVfor the signals that can cause certain things to happen.
p262
aVOr that could be good clinical targets
p263
aVfor treating brain disorders.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd one story I want to tell you about
p266
aVis how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder \u2014
p267
aVa form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear.
p268
aVAnd one of the things that we did
p269
aVwas to adopt a very classical model of fear.
p270
aVThis goes back to the Pavlovian days.
p271
aVIt's called Pavlovian fear conditioning \u2014
p272
aVwhere a tone ends with a brief shock.
p273
aVThe shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.
p274
aVAnd over time \u2014 in this case, a mouse,
p275
aVwhich is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments \u2014
p276
aVthe animal learns to fear the tone.
p277
aVThe animal will react by freezing,
p278
aVsort of like a deer in the headlights.
p279
aVNow the question is, what targets in the brain can we find
p280
aVthat allow us to overcome this fear?
p281
aVSo what we do is we play that tone again
p282
aVafter it's been associated with fear.
p283
aVBut we activate targets in the brain, different ones,
p284
aVusing that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide,
p285
aVin order to try and figure out which targets
p286
aVcan cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd so this brief video
p289
aVshows you one of these targets that we're working on now.
p290
aVThis is an area in the prefrontal cortex,
p291
aVa region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states.
p292
aVAnd the animal's going to hear a tone \u2014 and a flash of light occurred there.
p293
aVThere's no audio on this, but you can see the animal's freezing.
p294
aVThis tone used to mean bad news.
p295
aVAnd there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner,
p296
aVso you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.
p297
aVAnd now this next clip
p298
aVis just eight minutes later.
p299
aVAnd the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.
p300
aVOkay, there it goes. Right now.
p301
aVAnd now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment,
p302
aVthat we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area
p303
aVto overcome the expression
p304
aVof this fear memory.
p305
aa(lp306
VNow over the last couple of years, we've gone back to the tree of life
p307
aVbecause we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.
p308
aVIf we could do that, this could be extremely powerful.
p309
aVIf you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds,
p310
aVyou can figure out what necessary role they play
p311
aVin the circuits in which they're embedded.
p312
aVAnd we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life \u2014
p313
aVevery kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently.
p314
aVAnd we found all sorts of molecules, they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins,
p315
aVthat respond to green and yellow light.
p316
aVAnd they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before
p317
aVwith the blue light activator channelrhodopsin.
p318
aa(lp319
VLet's give an example of where we think this is going to go.
p320
aVConsider, for example, a condition like epilepsy,
p321
aVwhere the brain is overactive.
p322
aVNow if drugs fail in epileptic treatment,
p323
aVone of the strategies is to remove part of the brain.
p324
aVBut that's obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects.
p325
aVWhat if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time,
p326
aVuntil the seizure dies away,
p327
aVand cause the brain to be restored to its initial state \u2014
p328
aVsort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state.
p329
aVSo this animation just tries to explain this concept
p330
aVwhere we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light,
p331
aVand we beam light in,
p332
aVand just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure,
p333
aVwe're hoping to be able to turn it off.
p334
aVAnd so we don't have data to show you on this front,
p335
aVbut we're very excited about this.
p336
aa(lp337
VNow I want to close on one story,
p338
aVwhich we think is another possibility \u2014
p339
aVwhich is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultra-precise control,
p340
aVcan be used in the brain itself
p341
aVto make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic.
p342
aVI already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon.
p343
aVSeventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted.
p344
aVMaybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants,
p345
aVwhich allow them to hear.
p346
aVThere's another thing, which is you've got to get these genes into cells.
p347
aVAnd new hope in gene therapy has been developed
p348
aVbecause viruses like the adeno-associated virus,
p349
aVwhich probably most of us around this room have,
p350
aVand it doesn't have any symptoms,
p351
aVwhich have been used in hundreds of patients
p352
aVto deliver genes into the brain or the body.
p353
aVAnd so far, there have not been serious adverse events
p354
aVassociated with the virus.
p355
aa(lp356
VThere's one last elephant in the room, the proteins themselves,
p357
aVwhich come from algae and bacteria and fungi,
p358
aVand all over the tree of life.
p359
aVMost of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains,
p360
aVso what is our brain going to do if we put that in?
p361
aVAre the cells going to tolerate it? Will the immune system react?
p362
aVIn its early days \u2014 these have not been done on humans yet \u2014
p363
aVbut we're working on a variety of studies
p364
aVto try and examine this,
p365
aVand so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity
p366
aVto these molecules
p367
aVor to the illumination of the brain with light.
p368
aVSo it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it.
p369
aa(lp370
VI wanted to close with one story,
p371
aVwhich we think could potentially
p372
aVbe a clinical application.
p373
aVNow there are many forms of blindness
p374
aVwhere the photoreceptors,
p375
aVour light sensors that are in the back of our eye, are gone.
p376
aVAnd the retina, of course, is a complex structure.
p377
aVNow let's zoom in on it here, so we can see it in more detail.
p378
aVThe photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top,
p379
aVand then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors
p380
aVare transformed by various computations
p381
aVuntil finally that layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells,
p382
aVrelay the information to the brain,
p383
aVwhere we see that as perception.
p384
aVIn many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa,
p385
aVor macular degeneration,
p386
aVthe photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.
p387
aVNow how could you repair this?
p388
aVIt's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored,
p389
aVbecause there's nothing for the drug to bind to.
p390
aVOn the other hand, light can still get into the eye.
p391
aVThe eye is still transparent and you can get light in.
p392
aVSo what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules
p393
aVand install them on some of these other spare cells
p394
aVand convert them into little cameras.
p395
aVAnd because there's so many of these cells in the eye,
p396
aVpotentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras.
p397
aa(lp398
VSo this is some work that we're doing.
p399
aVIt's being led by one of our collaborators,
p400
aVAlan Horsager at USC,
p401
aVand being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience,
p402
aVwhich is funded by the NIH.
p403
aVAnd what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.
p404
aVIt's a six-arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze
p405
aVto motivate the mouse to move, or he'll just sit there.
p406
aVAnd the goal, of course, of this maze
p407
aVis to get out of the water and go to a little platform
p408
aVthat's under the lit top port.
p409
aVNow mice are smart, so this mouse solves the maze eventually,
p410
aVbut he does a brute-force search.
p411
aVHe's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform.
p412
aVSo he's not using vision to do it.
p413
aVThese different mice are different mutations
p414
aVthat recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.
p415
aVAnd so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models
p416
aVso we come up with a generalized approach.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo how are we going to solve this?
p419
aVWe're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.
p420
aVWe're going to take these blue light photosensors
p421
aVand install them on a layer of cells
p422
aVin the middle of the retina in the back of the eye
p423
aVand convert them into a camera \u2014
p424
aVjust like installing solar cells all over those neurons
p425
aVto make them light sensitive.
p426
aVLight is converted to electricity on them.
p427
aVSo this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment
p428
aVand received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus.
p429
aVAnd now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls
p430
aVand go to this little platform
p431
aVand make cognitive use of its eyes again.
p432
aVAnd to point out the power of this:
p433
aVthese animals are able to get to that platform
p434
aVjust as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.
p435
aVSo this pre-clinical study, I think,
p436
aVbodes hope for the kinds of things
p437
aVwe're hoping to do in the future.
p438
aa(lp439
VTo close, I want to point out that we're also exploring
p440
aVnew business models for this new field of neurotechnology.
p441
aVWe're developing these tools,
p442
aVbut we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world,
p443
aVso people can study and try to treat different disorders.
p444
aVAnd our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits
p445
aVat a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them,
p446
aVwe can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier,
p447
aVpractically none of which are cured,
p448
aVand in the 21st century make them history.
p449
aa(lp450
VThank you.
p451
aa(lp452
V(Applause)
p453
aa(lp454
VJuan Enriquez: So some of the stuff is a little dense.
p455
aV(Laughter)
p456
aVBut the implications
p457
aVof being able to control seizures or epilepsy
p458
aVwith light instead of drugs,
p459
aVand being able to target those specifically
p460
aVis a first step.
p461
aVThe second thing that I think I heard you say
p462
aVis you can now control the brain in two colors,
p463
aVlike an on/off switch.
p464
aa(lp465
VEd Boyden: That's right.
p466
aa(lp467
VJE: Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code.
p468
aa(lp469
VEB: Right, yeah.
p470
aVSo with blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one.
p471
aVAnd by turning things off, it's more or less a zero.
p472
aVSo our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors
p473
aVthat work with the brain
p474
aVso we can augment functions in people with disabilities.
p475
aa(lp476
VJE: And in theory, that means that,
p477
aVas a mouse feels, smells,
p478
aVhears, touches,
p479
aVyou can model it out as a string of ones and zeros.
p480
aa(lp481
VEB: Sure, yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing
p482
aVwhat neural codes can drive certain behaviors
p483
aVand certain thoughts and certain feelings,
p484
aVand use that to understand more about the brain.
p485
aa(lp486
VJE: Does that mean that some day you could download memories
p487
aVand maybe upload them?
p488
aa(lp489
VEB: Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard.
p490
aVWe're now working on some work
p491
aVwhere we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too.
p492
aVSo we can record information and then drive information back in \u2014
p493
aVsort of computing what the brain needs
p494
aVin order to augment its information processing.
p495
aa(lp496
VJE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you. (EB: Thank you.)

VYou know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED
p5
aVis compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen:
p6
aVHIV in Africa, President Clinton last night.
p7
aVAnd I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will,
p8
aVabout compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.
p9
aVI'm a psychologist, but rest assured,
p10
aVI will not bring it to the scrotal.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VThere was a very important study done a while ago
p15
aVat Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is
p16
aVthat when all of us have so many opportunities to help,
p17
aVwe do sometimes, and we don't other times.
p18
aVA group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary
p19
aVwere told that they were going to give a practice sermon
p20
aVand they were each given a sermon topic.
p21
aVHalf of those students were given, as a topic,
p22
aVthe parable of the Good Samaritan:
p23
aVthe man who stopped the stranger in \u2014
p24
aVto help the stranger in need by the side of the road.
p25
aVHalf were given random Bible topics.
p26
aVThen one by one, they were told they had to go to another building
p27
aVand give their sermon.
p28
aVAs they went from the first building to the second,
p29
aVeach of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning,
p30
aVclearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help?
p31
aa(lp32
VThe more interesting question is:
p33
aVDid it matter they were contemplating the parable
p34
aVof the Good Samaritan? Answer: No, not at all.
p35
aVWhat turned out to determine whether someone would stop
p36
aVand help a stranger in need
p37
aVwas how much of a hurry they thought they were in \u2014
p38
aVwere they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed
p39
aVin what they were going to talk about.
p40
aVAnd this is, I think, the predicament of our lives:
p41
aVthat we don't take every opportunity to help
p42
aVbecause our focus is in the wrong direction.
p43
aa(lp44
VThere's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience.
p45
aVThis studies the circuitry in two people's brains
p46
aVthat activates while they interact.
p47
aVAnd the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience
p48
aVis that our default wiring is to help.
p49
aVThat is to say, if we attend to the other person,
p50
aVwe automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them.
p51
aVThere are these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons,
p52
aVthat act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain
p53
aVexactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically.
p54
aVAnd if that person is in need, if that person is suffering,
p55
aVwe're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut then the question is: Why don't we?
p58
aVAnd I think this speaks to a spectrum
p59
aVthat goes from complete self-absorption,
p60
aVto noticing, to empathy and to compassion.
p61
aVAnd the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves,
p62
aVif we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day,
p63
aVwe don't really fully notice the other.
p64
aVAnd this difference between the self and the other focus
p65
aVcan be very subtle.
p66
aa(lp67
VI was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point
p68
aVwhere I was listing all of the donations I gave,
p69
aVand I had an epiphany, it was \u2014 I came to my check
p70
aVto the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought,
p71
aVboy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy
p72
aVthat I gave money to Seva.
p73
aVThen I realized that what I was getting from giving
p74
aVwas a narcissistic hit \u2014 that I felt good about myself.
p75
aVThen I started to think about the people in the Himalayas
p76
aVwhose cataracts would be helped, and I realized
p77
aVthat I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus
p78
aVto altruistic joy, to feeling good
p79
aVfor the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut this distinction between focusing on ourselves
p82
aVand focusing on others
p83
aVis one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.
p84
aVYou can see it at a gross level in the world of dating.
p85
aVI was at a sushi restaurant a while back
p86
aVand I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman,
p87
aVwho was in the singles scene. And this woman says,
p88
aV"My brother is having trouble getting dates,
p89
aVso he's trying speed dating." I don't know if you know speed dating?
p90
aVWomen sit at tables and men go from table to table,
p91
aVand there's a clock and a bell, and at five minutes, bingo,
p92
aVthe conversation ends and the woman can decide
p93
aVwhether to give her card or her email address to the man
p94
aVfor follow up. And this woman says,
p95
aV"My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.
p96
aVThe moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself;
p97
aVhe never asks about the woman."
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section
p100
aVof The New York Times, looking at the back stories of marriages \u2014
p101
aVbecause they're very interesting \u2014 and I came to the marriage
p102
aVof Alice Charney Epstein. And she said
p103
aVthat when she was in the dating scene,
p104
aVshe had a simple test she put people to.
p105
aVThe test was: from the moment they got together,
p106
aVhow long it would take the guy to ask her a question
p107
aVwith the word "you" in it.
p108
aVAnd apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VNow this is a \u2014 it's a little test
p113
aVI encourage you to try out at a party.
p114
aVHere at TED there are great opportunities.
p115
aVThe Harvard Business Review recently had an article called
p116
aV"The Human Moment," about how to make real contact
p117
aVwith a person at work. And they said, well,
p118
aVthe fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry,
p119
aVclose your laptop, end your daydream
p120
aVand pay full attention to the person.
p121
aVThere is a newly coined word in the English language
p122
aVfor the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry
p123
aVor answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.
p124
aVThe word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VI think it's quite apt. It's our empathy, it's our tuning in
p129
aVwhich separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths.
p130
aVI have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror \u2014
p131
aVhe wrote the Annotated Dracula, the Essential Frankenstein \u2014
p132
aVhe was trained as a Chaucer scholar,
p133
aVbut he was born in Transylvania
p134
aVand I think it affected him a little bit.
p135
aVAt any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard,
p136
aVdecided to write a book about a serial killer.
p137
aVThis is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in
p138
aVmany years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler.
p139
aVAnd before he was arrested, he had murdered his grandparents,
p140
aVhis mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer
p143
aVand he realizes when he meets him
p144
aVthat this guy is absolutely terrifying.
p145
aVFor one thing, he's almost seven feet tall.
p146
aVBut that's not the most terrifying thing about him.
p147
aVThe scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.
p148
aVBut there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy,
p149
aVfeeling with the other person.
p150
aVThey're controlled by different parts of the brain.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage
p153
aVto ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to,
p154
aVand that is: how could you have done it?
p155
aVDidn't you feel any pity for your victims?
p156
aVThese were very intimate murders \u2014 he strangled his victims.
p157
aVAnd the strangler says very matter-of-factly,
p158
aV"Oh no. If I'd felt the distress, I could not have done it.
p159
aVI had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off."
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd I think that that is very troubling,
p162
aVand in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.
p163
aVWhen we focus on ourselves in any activity,
p164
aVwe do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.
p165
aVThink about going shopping and think about the possibilities
p166
aVof a compassionate consumerism.
p167
aVRight now, as Bill McDonough has pointed out,
p168
aVthe objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.
p169
aVWe're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot.
p170
aVWe don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice
p171
aVthe toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.
p172
aVOr we don't know if that fabric is a technological
p173
aVor manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused
p174
aVor does it just end up at landfill? In other words,
p175
aVwe're oblivious to the ecological and public health
p176
aVand social and economic justice consequences
p177
aVof the things we buy and use.
p178
aVIn a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room,
p179
aVbut we don't see it. And we've become victims
p180
aVof a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.
p181
aa(lp182
VThere's a wonderful book called
p183
aVStuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.
p184
aVAnd it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.
p185
aVAnd it talks about where the cotton was grown
p186
aVand the fertilizers that were used and the consequences
p187
aVfor soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance,
p188
aVthat cotton is very resistant to textile dye;
p189
aVabout 60 percent washes off into wastewater.
p190
aVAnd it's well known by epidemiologists that kids
p191
aVwho live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.
p192
aVThere's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com,
p193
aVVictoria's Secret \u2014 they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this,
p194
aVin China formed a joint venture with their dye works
p195
aVto make sure that the wastewater
p196
aVwould be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.
p197
aVRight now, we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t-shirt
p198
aVover the non-virtuous one. So what would it take to do that?
p199
aa(lp200
VWell, I've been thinking. For one thing,
p201
aVthere's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store
p202
aVto know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store.
p203
aVYou can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it
p204
aVback to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes
p205
aVthat were used to make it, and if it's virtuous,
p206
aVyou can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous,
p207
aVyou can go into \u2014 today, go into any store,
p208
aVput your scanner on a palm onto a barcode,
p209
aVwhich will take you to a website.
p210
aVThey have it for people with allergies to peanuts.
p211
aVThat website could tell you things about that object.
p212
aVIn other words, at point of purchase,
p213
aVwe might be able to make a compassionate choice.
p214
aa(lp215
VThere's a saying in the world of information science:
p216
aVultimately everybody will know everything.
p217
aVAnd the question is: will it make a difference?
p218
aVSome time ago when I was working for The New York Times,
p219
aVit was in the '80s, I did an article
p220
aVon what was then a new problem in New York \u2014
p221
aVit was homeless people on the streets.
p222
aVAnd I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency
p223
aVthat ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless
p224
aVthrough their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients
p225
aVthat had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me \u2014
p226
aVwhat it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where,
p227
aVwhen we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless
p228
aVin the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.
p229
aVWe don't notice and therefore we don't act.
p230
aa(lp231
VOne day soon after that \u2014 it was a Friday \u2014 at the end of the day,
p232
aVI went down \u2014 I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour
p233
aVand thousands of people were streaming down the stairs.
p234
aVAnd all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs
p235
aVI noticed that there was a man slumped to the side,
p236
aVshirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him \u2014
p237
aVhundreds and hundreds of people.
p238
aVAnd because my urban trance had been somehow weakened,
p239
aVI found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.
p240
aVThe moment I stopped, half a dozen other people
p241
aVimmediately ringed the same guy.
p242
aVAnd we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English,
p243
aVhe had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving,
p244
aVand he'd fainted from hunger.
p245
aVImmediately someone went to get orange juice,
p246
aVsomeone brought a hotdog, someone brought a subway cop.
p247
aVThis guy was back on his feet immediately.
p248
aVBut all it took was that simple act of noticing,
p249
aVand so I'm optimistic.
p250
aa(lp251
VThank you very much.

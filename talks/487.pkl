VI want to talk to you today a little bit
p5
aVabout predictable irrationality.
p6
aVAnd my interest in irrational behavior
p7
aVstarted many years ago in the hospital.
p8
aVI was burned very badly.
p9
aVAnd if you spend a lot of time in hospital,
p10
aVyou'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.
p11
aVAnd the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department
p12
aVwas the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.
p13
aVNow, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point,
p14
aVand you must have wondered what's the right approach.
p15
aVDo you rip it off quickly \u2014 short duration but high intensity \u2014
p16
aVor do you take your Band-Aid off slowly \u2014
p17
aVyou take a long time, but each second is not as painful \u2014
p18
aVwhich one of those is the right approach?
p19
aa(lp20
VThe nurses in my department thought that the right approach
p21
aVwas the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip,
p22
aVand they would grab hold and they would rip.
p23
aVAnd because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.
p24
aVAnd as you can imagine,
p25
aVI hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.
p26
aVAnd I would try to reason with them and say,
p27
aV"Why don't we try something else?
p28
aVWhy don't we take it a little longer \u2014
p29
aVmaybe two hours instead of an hour \u2014 and have less of this intensity?"
p30
aVAnd the nurses told me two things.
p31
aVThey told me that they had the right model of the patient \u2014
p32
aVthat they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain \u2014
p33
aVand they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean
p34
aVto make suggestions or to interfere or ...
p35
aVThis is not just in Hebrew, by the way.
p36
aVIt's in every language I've had experience with so far.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd, you know, there's not much \u2014 there wasn't much I could do,
p39
aVand they kept on doing what they were doing.
p40
aVAnd about three years later, when I left the hospital,
p41
aVI started studying at the university.
p42
aVAnd one of the most interesting lessons I learned
p43
aVwas that there is an experimental method
p44
aVthat if you have a question you can create a replica of this question
p45
aVin some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question,
p46
aVmaybe learn something about the world.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo that's what I did.
p49
aVI was still interested
p50
aVin this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.
p51
aVSo originally I didn't have much money,
p52
aVso I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.
p53
aVAnd I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it,
p54
aVand I would crunch it a little bit.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd I would crunch it for long periods and short periods,
p59
aVand pain that went up and pain that went down,
p60
aVand with breaks and without breaks \u2014 all kinds of versions of pain.
p61
aVAnd when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them,
p62
aVso, how painful was this? Or, how painful was this?
p63
aVOr, if you had to choose between the last two,
p64
aVwhich one would you choose?
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VI kept on doing this for a while.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.
p73
aVI moved to sounds, electrical shocks \u2014
p74
aVI even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut at the end of this process,
p77
aVwhat I learned was that the nurses were wrong.
p78
aVHere were wonderful people with good intentions
p79
aVand plenty of experience, and nevertheless
p80
aVthey were getting things wrong predictably all the time.
p81
aVIt turns out that because we don't encode duration
p82
aVin the way that we encode intensity,
p83
aVI would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer
p84
aVand the intensity was lower.
p85
aVIt turns out it would have been better to start with my face,
p86
aVwhich was much more painful, and move toward my legs,
p87
aVgiving me a trend of improvement over time \u2014
p88
aVthat would have been also less painful.
p89
aVAnd it also turns out that it would have been good
p90
aVto give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.
p91
aVAll of these would have been great things to do,
p92
aVand my nurses had no idea.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd from that point on I started thinking,
p95
aVare the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong
p96
aVin this particular decision, or is it a more general case?
p97
aVAnd it turns out it's a more general case \u2014
p98
aVthere's a lot of mistakes we do.
p99
aVAnd I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities,
p100
aVand I want to talk to you about cheating.
p101
aVAnd the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting,
p102
aVbut also it tells us something, I think,
p103
aVabout the stock market situation we're in.
p104
aVSo, my interest in cheating started
p105
aVwhen Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden,
p106
aVand I started thinking about what is happening here.
p107
aVIs it the case that there was kind of
p108
aVa few apples who are capable of doing these things,
p109
aVor are we talking a more endemic situation,
p110
aVthat many people are actually capable of behaving this way?
p111
aa(lp112
VSo, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.
p113
aVAnd here's how it went.
p114
aVIf you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper
p115
aVwith 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve,
p116
aVbut I wouldn't give you enough time.
p117
aVWhen the five minutes were over, I would say,
p118
aV"Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."
p119
aVPeople did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task \u2014
p120
aVon average people would solve four problems.
p121
aVOther people I would tempt to cheat.
p122
aVI would pass their sheet of paper.
p123
aVWhen the five minutes were over, I would say,
p124
aV"Please shred the piece of paper.
p125
aVPut the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack,
p126
aVand tell me how many questions you got correctly."
p127
aVPeople now solved seven questions on average.
p128
aVNow, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples \u2014
p129
aVa few people cheated a lot.
p130
aVInstead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, in economic theory,
p133
aVcheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.
p134
aVYou say, what's the probability of being caught?
p135
aVHow much do I stand to gain from cheating?
p136
aVAnd how much punishment would I get if I get caught?
p137
aVAnd you weigh these options out \u2014
p138
aVyou do the simple cost-benefit analysis,
p139
aVand you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.
p140
aVSo, we try to test this.
p141
aVFor some people, we varied how much money they could get away with \u2014
p142
aVhow much money they could steal.
p143
aVWe paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents,
p144
aVa dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.
p145
aa(lp146
VYou would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases,
p147
aVpeople would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.
p148
aVWe got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.
p149
aVWhat about the probability of being caught?
p150
aVSome people shredded half the sheet of paper,
p151
aVso there was some evidence left.
p152
aVSome people shredded the whole sheet of paper.
p153
aVSome people shredded everything, went out of the room,
p154
aVand paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.
p155
aVYou would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down,
p156
aVpeople would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.
p157
aVAgain, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit,
p158
aVand they were insensitive to these economic incentives.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo we said, "If people are not sensitive
p161
aVto the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces,
p162
aVwhat could be going on?"
p163
aVAnd we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.
p164
aVAt one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror
p165
aVand feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.
p166
aVOn the other hand, we can cheat a little bit,
p167
aVand still feel good about ourselves.
p168
aVSo, maybe what is happening is that
p169
aVthere's a level of cheating we can't go over,
p170
aVbut we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree,
p171
aVas long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.
p172
aVWe call this like a personal fudge factor.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, how would you test a personal fudge factor?
p175
aVInitially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?
p176
aVSo, we got people to the lab, and we said,
p177
aV"We have two tasks for you today."
p178
aVFirst, we asked half the people
p179
aVto recall either 10 books they read in high school,
p180
aVor to recall The Ten Commandments,
p181
aVand then we tempted them with cheating.
p182
aVTurns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments \u2014
p183
aVand in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments \u2014
p184
aVbut those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments,
p185
aVgiven the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.
p186
aVIt wasn't that the more religious people \u2014
p187
aVthe people who remembered more of the Commandments \u2014 cheated less,
p188
aVand the less religious people \u2014
p189
aVthe people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments \u2014
p190
aVcheated more.
p191
aVThe moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments,
p192
aVthey stopped cheating.
p193
aVIn fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists
p194
aVthe task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat,
p195
aVthey don't cheat at all.
p196
aVNow, Ten Commandments is something that is hard
p197
aVto bring into the education system, so we said,
p198
aV"Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"
p199
aVSo, we got people to sign,
p200
aV"I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."
p201
aVThen they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.
p202
aVAnd this is particularly interesting,
p203
aVbecause MIT doesn't have an honor code.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VSo, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.
p207
aVWhat about increasing the fudge factor?
p208
aVThe first experiment \u2014 I walked around MIT
p209
aVand I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators \u2014
p210
aVthese were common refrigerators for the undergrads.
p211
aVAnd I came back to measure what we technically call
p212
aVthe half-lifetime of Coke \u2014 how long does it last in the refrigerators?
p213
aVAs you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.
p214
aVIn contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills,
p215
aVand I left those plates in the same refrigerators.
p216
aVNo bill ever disappeared.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow, this is not a good social science experiment,
p219
aVso to do it better I did the same experiment
p220
aVas I described to you before.
p221
aVA third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.
p222
aVA third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it,
p223
aVthey came to us and said,
p224
aV"Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."
p225
aVA third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper,
p226
aVthey came to us and said,
p227
aV"Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens."
p228
aVWe did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.
p229
aVAnd then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side,
p230
aVand exchanged it for dollars.
p231
aa(lp232
VThink about the following intuition.
p233
aVHow bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home,
p234
aVcompared to how bad would you feel
p235
aVabout taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?
p236
aVThese things feel very differently.
p237
aVWould being a step removed from cash for a few seconds
p238
aVby being paid by token make a difference?
p239
aVOur subjects doubled their cheating.
p240
aVI'll tell you what I think
p241
aVabout this and the stock market in a minute.
p242
aVBut this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet,
p243
aVbecause in Enron, there's also a social element.
p244
aVPeople see each other behaving.
p245
aVIn fact, every day when we open the news
p246
aVwe see examples of people cheating.
p247
aVWhat does this cause us?
p248
aa(lp249
VSo, we did another experiment.
p250
aVWe got a big group of students to be in the experiment,
p251
aVand we prepaid them.
p252
aVSo everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment,
p253
aVand we told them that at the end, we asked them
p254
aVto pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?
p255
aVThe same thing happens.
p256
aVWhen we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.
p257
aVThey cheat just by a little bit, all the same.
p258
aVBut in this experiment we also hired an acting student.
p259
aVThis acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said,
p260
aV"I solved everything. What do I do now?"
p261
aVAnd the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.
p262
aVThat's it. The task is finished."
p263
aVSo, now we had a student \u2014 an acting student \u2014
p264
aVthat was a part of the group.
p265
aVNobody knew it was an actor.
p266
aVAnd they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.
p267
aVWhat would happen to the other people in the group?
p268
aVWill they cheat more, or will they cheat less?
p269
aa(lp270
VHere is what happens.
p271
aVIt turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.
p272
aVHere is the thing.
p273
aVWe ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.
p274
aVAnd at Pittsburgh there are two big universities,
p275
aVCarnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.
p276
aVAll of the subjects sitting in the experiment
p277
aVwere Carnegie Mellon students.
p278
aVWhen the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student \u2014
p279
aVhe was actually a Carnegie Mellon student \u2014
p280
aVbut he was a part of their group, cheating went up.
p281
aVBut when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt,
p282
aVcheating went down.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VNow, this is important, because remember,
p287
aVwhen the moment the student stood up,
p288
aVit made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating,
p289
aVbecause the experimenter said,
p290
aV"You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money.
p291
aVSo it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.
p292
aVIt was about the norms for cheating.
p293
aVIf somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating,
p294
aVwe feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.
p295
aVBut if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people \u2014
p296
aVI mean, not terrible in this \u2014
p297
aVbut somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with,
p298
aVfrom another university, another group,
p299
aVall of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up \u2014
p300
aVa little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment \u2014
p301
aVand people cheat even less.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo, what have we learned from this about cheating?
p304
aVWe've learned that a lot of people can cheat.
p305
aVThey cheat just by a little bit.
p306
aVWhen we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.
p307
aVWhen we get bigger distance from cheating,
p308
aVfrom the object of money, for example, people cheat more.
p309
aVAnd when we see cheating around us,
p310
aVparticularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.
p311
aVNow, if we think about this in terms of the stock market,
p312
aVthink about what happens.
p313
aVWhat happens in a situation when you create something
p314
aVwhere you pay people a lot of money
p315
aVto see reality in a slightly distorted way?
p316
aVWould they not be able to see it this way?
p317
aVOf course they would.
p318
aVWhat happens when you do other things,
p319
aVlike you remove things from money?
p320
aVYou call them stock, or stock options, derivatives,
p321
aVmortgage-backed securities.
p322
aVCould it be that with those more distant things,
p323
aVit's not a token for one second,
p324
aVit's something that is many steps removed from money
p325
aVfor a much longer time \u2014 could it be that people will cheat even more?
p326
aVAnd what happens to the social environment
p327
aVwhen people see other people behave around them?
p328
aVI think all of those forces worked in a very bad way
p329
aVin the stock market.
p330
aa(lp331
VMore generally, I want to tell you something
p332
aVabout behavioral economics.
p333
aVWe have many intuitions in our life,
p334
aVand the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.
p335
aVThe question is, are we going to test those intuitions?
p336
aVWe can think about how we're going to test this intuition
p337
aVin our private life, in our business life,
p338
aVand most particularly when it goes to policy,
p339
aVwhen we think about things like No Child Left Behind,
p340
aVwhen you create new stock markets, when you create other policies \u2014
p341
aVtaxation, health care and so on.
p342
aVAnd the difficulty of testing our intuition
p343
aVwas the big lesson I learned
p344
aVwhen I went back to the nurses to talk to them.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo I went back to talk to them
p347
aVand tell them what I found out about removing bandages.
p348
aVAnd I learned two interesting things.
p349
aVOne was that my favorite nurse, Ettie,
p350
aVtold me that I did not take her pain into consideration.
p351
aVShe said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.
p352
aVBut think about me as a nurse,
p353
aVtaking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked,
p354
aVand had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.
p355
aVCreating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."
p356
aVAnd she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.
p357
aVBut it was actually more interesting than that, because she said,
p358
aV"I did not think that your intuition was right.
p359
aVI felt my intuition was correct."
p360
aVSo, if you think about all of your intuitions,
p361
aVit's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.
p362
aVAnd she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." \u2014
p363
aVshe thought her intuition was right \u2014
p364
aVit was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment
p365
aVto try and check whether she was wrong.
p366
aa(lp367
VBut in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.
p368
aVWe have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things \u2014
p369
aVour own ability, how the economy works,
p370
aVhow we should pay school teachers.
p371
aVBut unless we start testing those intuitions,
p372
aVwe're not going to do better.
p373
aVAnd just think about how better my life would have been
p374
aVif these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition,
p375
aVand how everything would have been better
p376
aVif we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.
p377
aa(lp378
VThank you very much.

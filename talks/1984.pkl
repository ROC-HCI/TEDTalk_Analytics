VA computer is an incredibly powerful means
p5
aVof creative expression,
p6
aVbut for the most part,
p7
aVthat expression is confined to the screens
p8
aVof our laptops and mobile phones.
p9
aVAnd I'd like to tell you a story about
p10
aVbringing this power of the computer
p11
aVto move things around and interact with us
p12
aVoff of the screen and into the physical world
p13
aVin which we live.
p14
aa(lp15
VA few years ago, I got a call from
p16
aVa luxury fashion store called Barneys New York,
p17
aVand the next thing I knew,
p18
aVI was designing storefront kinetic sculptures
p19
aVfor their window displays.
p20
aa(lp21
VThis one's called "The Chase."
p22
aVThere are two pairs of shoes,
p23
aVa man's pair and a woman's pair,
p24
aVand they play out this slow, tense chase
p25
aVaround the window
p26
aVin which the man scoots up behind the woman
p27
aVand gets in her personal space,
p28
aVand then she moves away.
p29
aVEach of the shoes has magnets in it,
p30
aVand there are magnets underneath the table
p31
aVthat move the shoes around.
p32
aa(lp33
VMy friend Andy Cavatorta was building
p34
aVa robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour
p35
aVand I wound up building the electronics
p36
aVand motion control software
p37
aVto make the harps move and play music.
p38
aVThe harp has four separate pendulums,
p39
aVand each pendulum has 11 strings,
p40
aVso the harp swings on its axis and also rotates
p41
aVin order to play different musical notes,
p42
aVand the harps are all networked together
p43
aVso that they can play the right notes
p44
aVat the right time in the music.
p45
aa(lp46
VI built an interactive chemistry exhibit
p47
aVat the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago,
p48
aVand this exhibit lets people use physical objects
p49
aVto grab chemical elements off of the periodic table
p50
aVand bring them together to cause
p51
aVchemical reactions to happen.
p52
aVAnd the museum noticed that people
p53
aVwere spending a lot of time with this exhibit,
p54
aVand a researcher from a science education center
p55
aVin Australia decided to study this exhibit
p56
aVand try to figure out what was going on.
p57
aVAnd she found that the physical objects
p58
aVthat people were using were helping people
p59
aVunderstand how to use the exhibit,
p60
aVand were helping people learn in a social way.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd when you think about it, this makes a lot of sense,
p63
aVthat using specialized physical objects
p64
aVwould help people use an interface more easily.
p65
aVI mean, our hands and our minds are optimized
p66
aVto think about and interact with tangible objects.
p67
aVThink about which you find easier to use,
p68
aVa physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard
p69
aVlike on a phone?
p70
aa(lp71
VBut the thing that struck me
p72
aVabout all of these different projects
p73
aVis that they really had to be built from scratch,
p74
aVdown to the level of the electronics
p75
aVand the printed circuit boards and
p76
aVall the mechanisms all the way up to the software.
p77
aVI wanted to create something
p78
aVwhere we could move objects under computer control
p79
aVand create interactions around that idea
p80
aVwithout having to go through this process
p81
aVof building something from scratch
p82
aVevery single time.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo my first attempt at this
p85
aVwas at the MIT Media Lab
p86
aVwith Professor Hiroshi Ishii,
p87
aVand we built this array of
p88
aV512 different electromagnets,
p89
aVand together they were able to move objects around
p90
aVon top of their surface.
p91
aVBut the problem with this
p92
aVwas that these magnets
p93
aVcost over 10,000 dollars.
p94
aVAlthough each one was pretty small,
p95
aValtogether they weighed so much
p96
aVthat the table that they were on
p97
aVstarted to sag.
p98
aVSo I wanted to build something
p99
aVwhere you could have this kind of interaction
p100
aVon any tabletop surface.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo to explore this idea,
p103
aVI built an army of small robots,
p104
aVand each of these robots has what are called omni wheels.
p105
aVThey're these special wheels
p106
aVthat can move equally easily in all directions,
p107
aVand when you couple these robots
p108
aVwith a video projector,
p109
aVyou have these physical tools
p110
aVfor interacting with digital information.
p111
aVSo here's an example of what I mean.
p112
aVThis is a video editing application
p113
aVwhere all of the controls
p114
aVfor manipulating the video are physical.
p115
aVSo if we want to tweak the color,
p116
aVwe just enter the color mode,
p117
aVand then we get three different dials
p118
aVfor tweaking the color,
p119
aVor if we want to adjust the audio,
p120
aVthen we get two different dials for that, these physical objects.
p121
aVSo here the left and right channel stay in sync,
p122
aVbut if we want to, we can override that
p123
aVby grabbing both of them at the same time.
p124
aVSo the idea is that we get the speed
p125
aVand efficiency benefits of using these physical dials
p126
aVtogether with the flexibility and versatility
p127
aVof a system that's designed in software.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd this is a mapping application
p130
aVfor disaster response.
p131
aVSo you have these physical objects
p132
aVthat represent police, fire and rescue,
p133
aVand a dispatcher can grab them
p134
aVand place them on the map
p135
aVto tell those units where to go,
p136
aVand then the position of the units on the map
p137
aVgets synced up with the position
p138
aVof those units in the real world.
p139
aa(lp140
VThis is a video chat application.
p141
aVIt's amazing how much emotion you can convey
p142
aVwith just a few simple movements
p143
aVof a physical object.
p144
aa(lp145
VWith this interface, we open up a huge array of possibilities
p146
aVin between traditional board games
p147
aVand arcade games,
p148
aVwhere the physical possibilities of interaction
p149
aVmake so many different styles of play possible.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut one of the areas that I'm most excited
p152
aVabout using this platform for
p153
aVis applying it to problems that are difficult
p154
aVfor computers or people to solve alone.
p155
aVOne example of those is protein folding.
p156
aVSo here we have an interface
p157
aVwhere we have physical handles onto a protein,
p158
aVand we can grab those handles
p159
aVand try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways.
p160
aVAnd if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense
p161
aVwith the underlying molecular simulation,
p162
aVwe get this physical feedback where we can
p163
aVactually feel these physical handles
p164
aVpulling back against us.
p165
aVSo feeling what's going on
p166
aVinside a molecular simulation
p167
aVis a whole different level of interaction.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo we're just beginning to explore
p170
aVwhat's possible when we use software
p171
aVto control the movement
p172
aVof objects in our environment.
p173
aVMaybe this is the computer of the future.
p174
aVThere's no touchscreen.
p175
aVThere's no technology visible at all.
p176
aVBut when we want to have a video chat
p177
aVor play a game
p178
aVor lay out the slides to our next TED Talk,
p179
aVthe objects on the table come alive.
p180
aa(lp181
VThank you.

VTyler Dewar: The way I feel right now
p5
aVis that all of the other speakers
p6
aVhave said exactly what I wanted to say.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVAnd it seems that the only thing left for me to say
p9
aVis to thank you all for your kindness.
p10
aa(lp11
VTD: But maybe in the spirit
p12
aVof appreciating the kindness of you all,
p13
aVI could share with you
p14
aVa little story about myself.
p15
aa(lp16
VTD: From the time I was very young, onward,
p17
aVI was given
p18
aVa lot of different responsibilities,
p19
aVand it always seemed to me, when I was young,
p20
aVthat everything was laid out before me.
p21
aVAll of the plans for me were already made.
p22
aVI was given the clothes that I needed to wear
p23
aVand told where I needed to be,
p24
aVgiven these very precious
p25
aVand holy looking robes to wear,
p26
aVwith the understanding
p27
aVthat it was something sacred or important.
p28
aa(lp29
VTD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me,
p30
aVI was living in eastern Tibet with my family.
p31
aVAnd when I was seven years old,
p32
aVall of a sudden,
p33
aVa search party arrived at my home.
p34
aVThey were looking the next Karmapa,
p35
aVand I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad,
p36
aVand the news came to me that they were telling me
p37
aVthat I was the Karmapa.
p38
aVAnd these days, people ask me a lot,
p39
aVhow did that feel.
p40
aVHow did that feel when they came and whisked you away,
p41
aVand your lifestyle completely changed?
p42
aVAnd what I mostly say is that,
p43
aVat that time,
p44
aVit was a pretty interesting idea to me.
p45
aVI thought that things would be pretty fun
p46
aVand there would be more things to play with.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VTD: But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining,
p51
aVas I thought it would have been.
p52
aVI was placed
p53
aVin a pretty strictly controlled environment.
p54
aVAnd immediately,
p55
aVa lot of different responsibilities,
p56
aVin terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me.
p57
aVI was separated, largely, from my family,
p58
aVincluding my mother and father.
p59
aVI didn't have have many personal friends
p60
aVto spend time with,
p61
aVbut I was expected to perform
p62
aVthese prescribed duties.
p63
aVSo it turned out that my fantasy
p64
aVabout an entertaining life of being the Karmapa
p65
aVwasn't going to come true.
p66
aVIt more felt to be the case to me
p67
aVthat I was being treated like a statue,
p68
aVand I was to sit in one place
p69
aVlike a statue would.
p70
aa(lp71
VTD: Nevertheless, I felt that,
p72
aVeven though I've been separated from my loved ones \u2014
p73
aVand, of course, now I'm even further away.
p74
aVWhen I was 14, I escaped from Tibet
p75
aVand became even further removed
p76
aVfrom my mother and father,
p77
aVmy relatives, my friends
p78
aVand my homeland.
p79
aVBut nevertheless,
p80
aVthere's no real sense of separation from me in my heart,
p81
aVin terms of the love that I feel
p82
aVfor these people.
p83
aVI feel, still, a very strong connection of love
p84
aVfor all of these people
p85
aVand for the land.
p86
aa(lp87
VTD: And I still do
p88
aVget to keep in touch with my mother and father,
p89
aValbeit infrequently.
p90
aVI talk to my mother
p91
aVonce in a blue moon on the telephone.
p92
aVAnd my experience is that,
p93
aVwhen I'm talking to her,
p94
aVwith every second that passes
p95
aVduring our conversation,
p96
aVthe feeling of love that binds us
p97
aVis bringing us closer and closer together.
p98
aa(lp99
VTD: So those were just a few remarks
p100
aVabout my personal background.
p101
aVAnd in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you,
p102
aVin terms of ideas,
p103
aVI think it's wonderful to have a situation like this,
p104
aVwhere so many people from different backgrounds and places
p105
aVcan come together,
p106
aVexchange their ideas
p107
aVand form relationships of friendship with each other.
p108
aVAnd I think that's symbolic
p109
aVof what we're seeing in the world in general,
p110
aVthat the world is becoming smaller and smaller,
p111
aVand that all of the peoples in the world
p112
aVare enjoying more opportunities for connection.
p113
aVThat's wonderful,
p114
aVbut we should also remember
p115
aVthat we should have a similar process happening on the inside.
p116
aVAlong with outward development
p117
aVand increase of opportunity,
p118
aVthere should be inward development
p119
aVand deepening of our heart connections
p120
aVas well as our outward connections.
p121
aVSo we spoke and we heard some
p122
aVabout design this week.
p123
aVI think that it's important for us to remember
p124
aVthat we need
p125
aVto keep pushing forward
p126
aVon the endeavor
p127
aVof the design of the heart.
p128
aVWe heard a lot about technology this week,
p129
aVand it's important for us to remember
p130
aVto invest a lot of our energy
p131
aVin improving the technology of the heart.
p132
aa(lp133
VTD: So, even though I'm somewhat happy
p134
aVabout the wonderful developments that are happening in the world,
p135
aVstill, I feel a sense of impediment,
p136
aVwhen it comes
p137
aVto the ability that we have
p138
aVto connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level.
p139
aVI feel that there are some things
p140
aVthat are getting in the way.
p141
aa(lp142
VTC: My relationship
p143
aVto this concept of heart-to-heart connection, or mind-to-mind connection,
p144
aVis an interesting one,
p145
aVbecause, as a spiritual leader, I'm always attempting
p146
aVto open my heart to others
p147
aVand offer myself up
p148
aVfor heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections
p149
aVin a genuine way with other people,
p150
aVbut at the same time,
p151
aVI've always been advised
p152
aVthat I need to emphasize intelligence
p153
aVover the heart-to-heart connections,
p154
aVbecause, being someone in a position like mine,
p155
aVif I don't rely primarily on intelligence,
p156
aVthen something dangerous may happen to me.
p157
aVSo it's an interesting paradox at play there.
p158
aVBut I had a really striking experience once,
p159
aVwhen a group from Afghanistan
p160
aVcame to visit me,
p161
aVand we had a really interesting conversation.
p162
aa(lp163
VTD: So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas,
p164
aVwhich, as you know,
p165
aVwere destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.
p166
aVBut the basis of our conversation
p167
aVwas the different approach to spirituality
p168
aVon the part of the Muslim
p169
aVand Buddhist traditions.
p170
aVOf course, in Muslim,
p171
aVbecause of the teachings around the concept of idolatry,
p172
aVyou don't find as many
p173
aVphysical representations of divinity
p174
aVor of spiritual liberation
p175
aVas you do in the Buddhist tradition,
p176
aVwhere, of course, there are many statues of the Buddha
p177
aVthat are highly revered.
p178
aVSo, we were talking about the differences
p179
aVbetween the traditions
p180
aVand what many people perceived
p181
aVas the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,
p182
aVbut I offered the suggestion
p183
aVthat perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.
p184
aVWhat we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas
p185
aVwas the depletion of matter,
p186
aVsome solid substance
p187
aVfalling down and disintegrating.
p188
aVMaybe we could look at that to be more similar
p189
aVto the falling of the Berlin Wall,
p190
aVwhere a divide
p191
aVthat had kept two types of people apart
p192
aVhad collapsed and opened up a door
p193
aVfor further communication.
p194
aVSo I think that, in this way,
p195
aVit's always possible for us
p196
aVto derive something positive
p197
aVthat can help us understand one another better.
p198
aa(lp199
VTD: So, with regard to the development
p200
aVthat we've been talking about
p201
aVhere at this conference,
p202
aVI really feel
p203
aVthat the development that we make
p204
aVshouldn't create a further burden
p205
aVfor us as human beings,
p206
aVbut should be used
p207
aVto improve
p208
aVour fundamental lifestyle
p209
aVof how we live in the world.
p210
aa(lp211
VTD: Of course, I rejoice
p212
aVin the development and the growth and the rise
p213
aVof the noble land of India, the great country of India,
p214
aVbut at the same time, I think,
p215
aVas some of us have acknowledged,
p216
aVwe need to be aware
p217
aVthat some aspects of this rise
p218
aVare coming at the cost
p219
aVof the very ground
p220
aVon which we stand.
p221
aVSo, as we are climbing the tree,
p222
aVsome of the things that we're doing
p223
aVin order to climb the tree
p224
aVare actually undermining
p225
aVthe tree's very root.
p226
aVAnd so,
p227
aVwhat I think it comes down to
p228
aVis a question of, not only having information of what's going on,
p229
aVbut paying attention to that
p230
aVand letting that shift our motivation
p231
aVto become more sincere
p232
aVand genuinely positive.
p233
aVWe have hear, this week,
p234
aVabout the horrible sufferings, for example,
p235
aVthat so many women of the world
p236
aVare enduring day-to-day.
p237
aVWe have that information,
p238
aVbut what often happens to us
p239
aVis that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.
p240
aVWe don't really choose to allow that
p241
aVto cause there to be a shift in our hearts.
p242
aVSo I think the way forward for the world \u2014
p243
aVone that will bring the path of outer development
p244
aVin harmony
p245
aVwith the real root of happiness \u2014
p246
aVis that we allow
p247
aVthe information that we have
p248
aVto really make a change in our heart.
p249
aa(lp250
VTD: So I think that sincere motivation
p251
aVis very important for our future well-being,
p252
aVor deep sense of well-being as humans,
p253
aVand I think that means sinking in
p254
aVto whatever it is you're doing now.
p255
aVWhatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world,
p256
aVsink into that,
p257
aVget a full taste of that.
p258
aa(lp259
VTD: So, since we've been here this week,
p260
aVwe've taken millions of breaths, collectively,
p261
aVand perhaps we haven't witnessed
p262
aVany course changes
p263
aVhappening in our lives,
p264
aVbut we often miss the very subtle changes.
p265
aVAnd I think
p266
aVthat sometimes we develop
p267
aVgrand concepts
p268
aVof what happiness
p269
aVmight look like for us,
p270
aVbut that, if we pay attention,
p271
aVwe can see that there are little symbols of happiness
p272
aVin every breath that we take.
p273
aa(lp274
VTD: So, every one of you who has come here
p275
aVis so talented,
p276
aVand you have so much to offer to the world,
p277
aVI think it would be a good note to conclude on then
p278
aVto just take a moment
p279
aVto appreciate how fortunate we are
p280
aVto have come together in this way and exchanged ideas
p281
aVand really form a strong aspiration
p282
aVand energy within ourselves
p283
aVthat we will take the good
p284
aVthat has come from this conference,
p285
aVthe momentum, the positivity,
p286
aVand we will spread that and plant it
p287
aVin all of the corners of the world.
p288
aa(lp289
VHis Holiness the Karmapa: Tomorrow is my Talk.
p290
aa(lp291
VTD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard,
p292
aVeven in inviting me,
p293
aVlet alone everything else that she has done
p294
aVto make this happen,
p295
aVand I was somewhat resistant at times,
p296
aVand I was also very nervous throughout this week.
p297
aVI was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth,
p298
aVand people would ask me, why.
p299
aVI would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow."
p300
aVAnd so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that,
p301
aVbut I very much appreciate
p302
aVthe opportunity she's given me
p303
aVto be here.
p304
aVAnd to you, everyone, thank you very much.
p305
aa(lp306

VToday I'm going to speak to you
p5
aVabout the last 30 years of architectural history.
p6
aVThat's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.
p7
aa(lp8
VIt's a complex topic,
p9
aVso we're just going to dive right in at a complex place:
p10
aVNew Jersey.
p11
aVBecause 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,
p12
aVand I was six, and I lived there in my parents' house
p13
aVin a town called Livingston,
p14
aVand this was my childhood bedroom.
p15
aVAround the corner from my bedroom
p16
aVwas the bathroom that I used to share with my sister.
p17
aVAnd in between my bedroom and the bathroom
p18
aVwas a balcony that overlooked the family room.
p19
aVAnd that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV,
p20
aVso that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom,
p21
aVeveryone would see me,
p22
aVand every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel,
p23
aVeveryone would see me.
p24
aVAnd I looked like this.
p25
aVI was awkward,
p26
aVinsecure, and I hated it.
p27
aVI hated that walk, I hated that balcony,
p28
aVI hated that room, and I hated that house.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd that's architecture.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVDone.
p33
aVThat feeling, those emotions that I felt,
p34
aVthat's the power of architecture,
p35
aVbecause architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning,
p36
aVit's about those visceral, emotional connections
p37
aVthat we feel to the places that we occupy.
p38
aVAnd it's no surprise that we feel that way,
p39
aVbecause according to the EPA,
p40
aVAmericans spend 90 percent of their time indoors.
p41
aVThat's 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture.
p42
aVThat's huge.
p43
aVThat means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize.
p44
aa(lp45
VThat makes us a little bit gullible and very, very predictable.
p46
aVIt means that when I show you a building like this,
p47
aVI know what you think:
p48
aVYou think "power" and "stability" and "democracy."
p49
aVAnd I know you think that because it's based on a building
p50
aVthat was build 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
p51
aVThis is a trick.
p52
aVThis is a trigger that architects use
p53
aVto get you to create an emotional connection
p54
aVto the forms that we build our buildings out of.
p55
aVIt's a predictable emotional connection,
p56
aVand we've been using this trick for a long, long time.
p57
aVWe used it [200] years ago to build banks.
p58
aVWe used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
p59
aVAnd in the 20th century in America,
p60
aVwe used it to build houses.
p61
aVAnd look at these solid, stable little soldiers
p62
aVfacing the ocean and keeping away the elements.
p63
aa(lp64
VThis is really, really useful,
p65
aVbecause building things is terrifying.
p66
aVIt's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
p67
aVAnd the people that build things \u2014
p68
aVdevelopers and governments \u2014
p69
aVthey're naturally afraid of innovation,
p70
aVand they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to.
p71
aa(lp72
VThat's how we end up with buildings like this.
p73
aVThis is a nice building.
p74
aVThis is the Livingston Public Library
p75
aVthat was completed in 2004 in my hometown,
p76
aVand, you know, it's got a dome
p77
aVand it's got this round thing  and columns, red brick,
p78
aVand you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building:
p79
aVchildren, property values and history.
p80
aVBut it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today.
p81
aVThat same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country,
p82
aVanother library was completed,
p83
aVand it looks like this.
p84
aVIt's in Seattle.
p85
aVThis library is about how we consume media in a digital age.
p86
aVIt's about a new kind of public amenity for the city,
p87
aVa place to gather and read and share.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo how is it possible
p90
aVthat in the same year, in the same country,
p91
aVtwo buildings, both called libraries,
p92
aVlook so completely different?
p93
aVAnd the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum.
p94
aVOn the one side is innovation,
p95
aVand architects are constantly pushing, pushing for new technologies,
p96
aVnew typologies, new solutions for the way that we live today.
p97
aVAnd we push and we push and we push
p98
aVuntil we completely alienate all of you.
p99
aVWe wear all black, we get very depressed,
p100
aVyou think we're adorable,
p101
aVwe're dead inside because we've got no choice.
p102
aVWe have to go to the other side
p103
aVand reengage those symbols that we know you love.
p104
aVSo we do that, and you're happy,
p105
aVwe feel like sellouts,
p106
aVso we start experimenting again
p107
aVand we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth
p108
aVwe've gone for the last 300 years,
p109
aVand certainly for the last 30 years.
p110
aa(lp111
VOkay, 30 years ago we were coming out of the '70s.
p112
aVArchitects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism.
p113
aVIt's about concrete.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVYou can guess this.
p116
aVSmall windows, dehumanizing scale.
p117
aVThis is really tough stuff.
p118
aVSo as we get closer to the '80s,
p119
aVwe start to reengage those symbols.
p120
aVWe push the pendulum back into the other direction.
p121
aVWe take these forms that we know you love
p122
aVand we update them.
p123
aVWe add neon
p124
aVand we add pastels
p125
aVand we use new materials.
p126
aVAnd you love it.
p127
aVAnd we can't give you enough of it.
p128
aVWe take Chippendale armoires
p129
aVand we turned those into skyscrapers,
p130
aVand skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass.
p131
aVForms got big,
p132
aVforms got bold and colorful.
p133
aVDwarves became columns.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVSwans grew to the size of buildings.
p136
aVIt was crazy.
p137
aVBut it's the '80s, it's cool.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVWe're all hanging out in malls
p140
aVand we're all moving to the suburbs,
p141
aVand out there, out in the suburbs,
p142
aVwe can create our own architectural fantasies.
p143
aVAnd those fantasies,
p144
aVthey can be Mediterranean
p145
aVor French
p146
aVor Italian.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVPossibly with endless breadsticks.
p149
aa(lp150
VThis is the thing about postmodernism.
p151
aVThis is the thing about symbols.
p152
aVThey're easy, they're cheap,
p153
aVbecause instead of making places,
p154
aVwe're making memories of places.
p155
aVBecause I know,  and I know all of you know,
p156
aVthis isn't Tuscany.
p157
aVThis is Ohio.
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VSo architects get frustrated,
p161
aVand we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction.
p162
aVIn the late '80s and early '90s,
p163
aVwe start experimenting with something called deconstructivism.
p164
aVWe throw out historical symbols,
p165
aVwe rely on new, computer-aided design techniques,
p166
aVand we come up with new compositions,
p167
aVforms crashing into forms.
p168
aVThis is academic and heady stuff,
p169
aVit's super unpopular,
p170
aVwe totally alienate you.
p171
aVOrdinarily, the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction.
p172
aVAnd then, something amazing happened.
p173
aa(lp174
VIn 1997, this building opened.
p175
aVThis is the Guggenheim Bilbao, by Frank Gehry.
p176
aVAnd this building
p177
aVfundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture.
p178
aVPaul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments
p179
aVwhen critics, academics, and the general public
p180
aVwere completely united around a building.
p181
aVThe New York Times called this building a miracle.
p182
aVTourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent
p183
aVafter this building was completed.
p184
aVSo all of a sudden, everybody wants one of these buildings:
p185
aVL.A.,
p186
aVSeattle,
p187
aVChicago,
p188
aVNew York,
p189
aVCleveland,
p190
aVSpringfield.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVEverybody wants one, and Gehry is everywhere.
p193
aVHe is our very first starchitect.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, how is it possible that these forms \u2014
p196
aVthey're wild and radical \u2014
p197
aVhow is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world?
p198
aVAnd it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them
p199
aVthat they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism.
p200
aVWe created an emotional reaction to these forms.
p201
aVSo did every mayor in the world.
p202
aVSo every mayor knew that if they had these forms,
p203
aVthey had culture and tourism.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium
p206
aVhappened to a few other starchitects.
p207
aVIt happened to Zaha
p208
aVand it happened to Libeskind,
p209
aVand what happened to these elite few architects
p210
aVat the turn of the new millennium
p211
aVcould actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture,
p212
aVas digital media starts to increase the speed
p213
aVwith which we consume information.
p214
aVBecause think about how you consume architecture.
p215
aVA thousand years ago,
p216
aVyou would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building.
p217
aVTransportation speeds up:
p218
aVYou can take a boat, you can take a plane, you can be a tourist.
p219
aVTechnology speeds up: You can see it in a newspaper, on TV,
p220
aVuntil finally, we are all architectural photographers,
p221
aVand the building has become disembodied from the site.
p222
aVArchitecture is everywhere now,
p223
aVand that means that the speed of communication
p224
aVhas finally caught up to the speed of architecture.
p225
aa(lp226
VBecause architecture actually moves quite quickly.
p227
aVIt doesn't take long to think about a building.
p228
aVIt takes a long time to build a building,
p229
aVthree or four years,
p230
aVand in the interim, an architect will design two or eight
p231
aVor a hundred other buildings
p232
aVbefore they know if that building that they designed four years ago
p233
aVwas a success or not.
p234
aVThat's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture.
p235
aVThat's how we end up with buildings like this.
p236
aVBrutalism wasn't a two-year movement,
p237
aVit was a 20-year movement.
p238
aVFor 20 years, we were producing buildings like this
p239
aVbecause we had no idea how much you hated it.
p240
aVIt's never going to happen again,
p241
aVI think,
p242
aVbecause we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture
p243
aVsince the invention of concrete,
p244
aVof steel, or of the elevator,
p245
aVand it's a media revolution.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum,
p248
aVit starts swinging faster and faster,
p249
aVuntil it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously,
p250
aVand that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol,
p251
aVbetween us, the architects, and you, the public.
p252
aVNow we can make nearly instantaneous, emotionally charged symbols
p253
aVout of something that's brand new.
p254
aa(lp255
VLet me show you how this plays out
p256
aVin a project that my firm recently completed.
p257
aVWe were hired to replace this building, which burned down.
p258
aVThis is the center of a town called the Pines
p259
aVin Fire Island in New York State.
p260
aVIt's a vacation community.
p261
aVWe proposed a building that was audacious,
p262
aVthat was different than any of the forms that the community was used to,
p263
aVand we were scared and our client was scared
p264
aVand the community was scared,
p265
aVso we created a series of photorealistic renderings
p266
aVthat we put onto Facebook
p267
aVand we put onto Instagram,
p268
aVand we let people start to do what they do:
p269
aVshare it, comment, like it, hate it.
p270
aVBut that meant that two years before the building was complete,
p271
aVit was already a part of the community,
p272
aVso that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product,
p273
aVthere were no surprises.
p274
aVThis building was already a part of this community,
p275
aVand then that first summer,
p276
aVwhen people started arriving and sharing the building on social media,
p277
aVthe building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media,
p278
aVbecause these, these are not just pictures of a building,
p279
aVthey're your pictures of a building.
p280
aVAnd as you use them to tell your story,
p281
aVthey become part of your personal narrative,
p282
aVand what you're doing is you're short-circuiting
p283
aVall of our collective memory,
p284
aVand you're making these charged symbols for us to understand.
p285
aVThat means we don't need the Greeks anymore
p286
aVto tell us what to think about architecture.
p287
aVWe can tell each other what we think about architecture,
p288
aVbecause digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us,
p289
aVit's changed the relationship between us and buildings.
p290
aVThink for a second about those librarians back in Livingston.
p291
aVIf that building was going to be built today,
p292
aVthe first thing they would do is go online and search "new libraries."
p293
aVThey would be bombarded by examples of experimentation, of innovation,
p294
aVof pushing at the envelope of what a library can be.
p295
aVThat's ammunition.
p296
aVThat's ammunition that they can take with them
p297
aVto the mayor of Livingston, to the people of Livingston,
p298
aVand say, there's no one answer to what a library is today.
p299
aVLet's be a part of this.
p300
aVThis abundance of experimentation
p301
aVgives them the freedom to run their own experiment.
p302
aa(lp303
VEverything is different now.
p304
aVArchitects are no longer these mysterious creatures
p305
aVthat use big words and complicated drawings,
p306
aVand you aren't the hapless public,
p307
aVthe consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore.
p308
aVArchitects can hear you,
p309
aVand you're not intimidated by architecture.
p310
aVThat means that that pendulum swinging back and forth
p311
aVfrom style to style, from movement to movement,
p312
aVis irrelevant.
p313
aVWe can actually move forward
p314
aVand find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces.
p315
aVThis is the end of architectural history,
p316
aVand it means that the buildings of tomorrow
p317
aVare going to look a lot different than the buildings of today.
p318
aVIt means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville
p319
aVcan be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works.
p320
aVIt means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn,
p321
aVnot some red-brick historical pastiche
p322
aVof what we think a stadium ought to be.
p323
aVIt means that robots are going to build our buildings,
p324
aVbecause we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce.
p325
aVAnd it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature
p326
aVinstead of the other way around.
p327
aVIt means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida,
p328
aVcan also be a place for sports
p329
aVand for yoga
p330
aVand you can even get married there late at night.
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aVIt means that three architects can dream about swimming
p333
aVin the East River of New York,
p334
aVand then raise nearly half a million dollars
p335
aVfrom a community that gathered around their cause,
p336
aVno one client anymore.
p337
aVIt means that no building is too small for innovation,
p338
aVlike this little reindeer pavilion
p339
aVthat's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe.
p340
aVAnd it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful
p341
aVto be lovable,
p342
aVlike this ugly little building in Spain,
p343
aVwhere the architects dug a hole,
p344
aVpacked it with hay,
p345
aVand then poured concrete around it,
p346
aVand when the concrete dried,
p347
aVthey invited someone to come and clean that hay out
p348
aVso that all that's left when it's done
p349
aVis this hideous little room
p350
aVthat's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made,
p351
aVand that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset.
p352
aa(lp353
VBecause it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings
p354
aVor a robot builds our buildings.
p355
aVIt doesn't matter how we build, it matters what we build.
p356
aVArchitects already know how to make buildings that are greener
p357
aVand smarter and friendlier.
p358
aVWe've just been waiting for all of you to want them.
p359
aVAnd finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
p360
aVFind an architect, hire an architect,
p361
aVwork with us to design better buildings, better cities, and a better world,
p362
aVbecause the stakes are high.
p363
aVBuildings don't just reflect our society, they shape our society
p364
aVdown to the smallest spaces:
p365
aVthe local libraries,
p366
aVthe homes where we raise our children,
p367
aVand the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom.
p368
aa(lp369
VThank you.

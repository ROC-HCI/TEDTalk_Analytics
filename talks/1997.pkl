VI recently retired
p5
aVfrom the California Highway Patrol
p6
aVafter 23 years of service.
p7
aVThe majority of those 23 years
p8
aVwas spent patrolling the southern end
p9
aVof Marin County,
p10
aVwhich includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
p11
aVThe bridge is an iconic structure,
p12
aVknown worldwide
p13
aVfor its beautiful views of San Francisco,
p14
aVthe Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.
p15
aa(lp16
VUnfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,
p17
aVbeing one of the most utilized sites in the world.
p18
aVThe Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.
p19
aVJoseph Strauss, chief engineer in charge of building the bridge,
p20
aVwas quoted as saying,
p21
aV"The bridge is practically suicide-proof.
p22
aVSuicide from the bridge
p23
aVis neither practical nor probable."
p24
aVBut since its opening,
p25
aVover 1,600 people have leapt to their death
p26
aVfrom that bridge.
p27
aVSome believe that traveling
p28
aVbetween the two towers
p29
aVwill lead you to another dimension \u2014
p30
aVthis bridge has been romanticized as such \u2014
p31
aVthat the fall from that
p32
aVfrees you from all your worries and grief,
p33
aVand the waters below
p34
aVwill cleanse your soul.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut let me tell you what actually occurs
p37
aVwhen the bridge is used
p38
aVas a means of suicide.
p39
aVAfter a free fall of four to five seconds,
p40
aVthe body strikes the water
p41
aVat about 75 miles an hour.
p42
aVThat impact shatters bones,
p43
aVsome of which then puncture vital organs.
p44
aVMost die on impact.
p45
aVThose that don't
p46
aVgenerally flail in the water helplessly,
p47
aVand then drown.
p48
aVI don't think that those who contemplate
p49
aVthis method of suicide
p50
aVrealize how grisly a death that they will face.
p51
aVThis is the cord.
p52
aVExcept for around the two towers,
p53
aVthere is 32 inches of steel
p54
aVparalleling the bridge.
p55
aVThis is where most folks stand
p56
aVbefore taking their lives.
p57
aVI can tell you from experience
p58
aVthat once the person is on that cord,
p59
aVand at their darkest time,
p60
aVit is very difficult to bring them back.
p61
aVI took this photo last year
p62
aVas this young woman spoke to an officer
p63
aVcontemplating her life.
p64
aVI want to tell you very happily
p65
aVthat we were successful that day
p66
aVin getting her back over the rail.
p67
aa(lp68
VWhen I first began working on the bridge,
p69
aVwe had no formal training.
p70
aVYou struggled to funnel your way through these calls.
p71
aVThis was not only a disservice
p72
aVto those contemplating suicide,
p73
aVbut to the officers as well.
p74
aVWe've come a long, long way since then.
p75
aVNow, veteran officers and psychologists
p76
aVtrain new officers.
p77
aa(lp78
VThis is Jason Garber.
p79
aVI met Jason on July 22 of last year
p80
aVwhen I get received a call
p81
aVof a possible suicidal subject
p82
aVsitting on the cord near midspan.
p83
aVI responded, and when I arrived,
p84
aVI observed Jason
p85
aVspeaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.
p86
aVJason was just 32 years old
p87
aVand had flown out here from New Jersey.
p88
aVAs a matter of fact,
p89
aVhe had flown out here on two other occasions
p90
aVfrom New Jersey
p91
aVto attempt suicide on this bridge.
p92
aVAfter about an hour of speaking with Jason,
p93
aVhe asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.
p94
aVRecalling your Greek mythology,
p95
aVZeus created Pandora,
p96
aVand sent her down to Earth with a box,
p97
aVand told her, "Never, ever open that box."
p98
aVWell one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,
p99
aVand she did open the box.
p100
aVOut flew plagues, sorrows,
p101
aVand all sorts of evils against man.
p102
aVThe only good thing in the box was hope.
p103
aVJason then asked us,
p104
aV"What happens when you open the box
p105
aVand hope isn't there?"
p106
aVHe paused a few moments,
p107
aVleaned to his right,
p108
aVand was gone.
p109
aVThis kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey
p110
aVhad just committed suicide.
p111
aa(lp112
VI spoke with Jason's parents that evening,
p113
aVand I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,
p114
aVthat I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,
p115
aVbecause that very next day,
p116
aVtheir family rabbi called to check on me.
p117
aVJason's parents had asked him to do so.
p118
aVThe collateral damage of suicide
p119
aVaffects so many people.
p120
aa(lp121
VI pose these questions to you:
p122
aVWhat would you do if your family member,
p123
aVfriend or loved one was suicidal?
p124
aVWhat would you say?
p125
aVWould you know what to say?
p126
aVIn my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,
p127
aVbut the listening.
p128
aVListen to understand.
p129
aVDon't argue, blame,
p130
aVor tell the person you know how they feel,
p131
aVbecause you probably don't.
p132
aVBy just being there,
p133
aVyou may just be the turning point that they need.
p134
aVIf you think someone is suicidal,
p135
aVdon't be afraid to confront them and ask the question.
p136
aVOne way of asking them the question is like this:
p137
aV"Others in similar circumstances
p138
aVhave thought about ending their life;
p139
aVhave you had these thoughts?"
p140
aVConfronting the person head-on
p141
aVmay just save their life and be the turning point for them.
p142
aVSome other signs to look for:
p143
aVhopelessness, believing that things are terrible
p144
aVand never going to get better;
p145
aVhelplessness, believing that there is nothing
p146
aVthat you can do about it;
p147
aVrecent social withdrawal;
p148
aVand a loss of interest in life.
p149
aa(lp150
VI came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,
p151
aVand I received an email from a lady
p152
aVthat I'd like to read you her letter.
p153
aVShe lost her son on January 19 of this year,
p154
aVand she wrote this me this email
p155
aVjust a couple of days ago,
p156
aVand it's with her permission and blessing
p157
aVthat I read this to you.
p158
aa(lp159
V"Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.
p160
aVThat must be quite the experience to be there.
p161
aVI'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend.
p162
aVJust wanted to drop you a note.
p163
aVHope you get the word out to many people
p164
aVand they go home talking about it
p165
aVto their friends who tell their friends, etc.
p166
aVI'm still pretty numb,
p167
aVbut noticing more moments of really realizing
p168
aVMike isn't coming home.
p169
aVMike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco
p170
aVto watch the 49ers game with his father
p171
aVon January 19.
p172
aVHe never made it there.
p173
aVI called Petaluma police
p174
aVand reported him missing that evening.
p175
aVThe next morning,
p176
aVtwo officers came to my home
p177
aVand reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.
p178
aVA witness had observed him jumping off the bridge
p179
aVat 1:58 p.m. the previous day.
p180
aVThanks so much
p181
aVfor standing up for those
p182
aVwho may be only temporarily too weak
p183
aVto stand for themselves.
p184
aVWho hasn't been low before
p185
aVwithout suffering from a true mental illness?
p186
aVIt shouldn't be so easy to end it.
p187
aVMy prayers are with you for your fight.
p188
aVThe GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,
p189
aVis supposed to be a passage across
p190
aVour beautiful bay,
p191
aVnot a graveyard.
p192
aVGood luck this week. Vicky."
p193
aa(lp194
VI can't imagine the courage it takes for her
p195
aVto go down to that bridge and walk the path
p196
aVthat her son took that day,
p197
aVand also the courage just to carry on.
p198
aa(lp199
VI'd like to introduce you to a man
p200
aVI refer to as hope and courage.
p201
aVOn March 11 of 2005,
p202
aVI responded to a radio call of a possible
p203
aVsuicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk
p204
aVnear the north tower.
p205
aVI rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk
p206
aVand observed this man, Kevin Berthia,
p207
aVstanding on the sidewalk.
p208
aVWhen he saw me, he immediately traversed
p209
aVthat pedestrian rail,
p210
aVand stood on that small pipe
p211
aVwhich goes around the tower.
p212
aVFor the next hour and a half,
p213
aVI listened as Kevin spoke about
p214
aVhis depression and hopelessness.
p215
aVKevin decided on his own that day
p216
aVto come back over that rail
p217
aVand give life another chance.
p218
aVWhen Kevin came back over,
p219
aVI congratulated him.
p220
aV"This is a new beginning, a new life."
p221
aVBut I asked him, "What was it
p222
aVthat made you come back
p223
aVand give hope and life another chance?"
p224
aVAnd you know what he told me?
p225
aVHe said, "You listened.
p226
aVYou let me speak, and you just listened."
p227
aa(lp228
VShortly after this incident,
p229
aVI received a letter from Kevin's mother,
p230
aVand I have that letter with me,
p231
aVand I'd like to read it to you.
p232
aa(lp233
V"Dear Mr. Briggs,
p234
aVNothing will erase the events of March 11,
p235
aVbut you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.
p236
aVI truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.
p237
aVHe has been diagnosed with a mental illness
p238
aVfor which he has been properly medicated.
p239
aVI adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,
p240
aVcompletely unaware of any hereditary traits,
p241
aVbut, thank God, now we know.
p242
aVKevin is straight, as he says.
p243
aVWe truly thank God for you.
p244
aVSincerely indebted to you,
p245
aVNarvella Berthia."
p246
aVAnd on the bottom she writes,
p247
aV"P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening,
p248
aVyou were listed as the patient.
p249
aVBoy, did I have to straighten that one out."
p250
aa(lp251
VToday, Kevin is a loving father
p252
aVand contributing member of society.
p253
aVHe speaks openly
p254
aVabout the events that day and his depression
p255
aVin the hopes that his story
p256
aVwill inspire others.
p257
aa(lp258
VSuicide is not just something I've encountered on the job.
p259
aVIt's personal.
p260
aVMy grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.
p261
aVThat act, although ending his own pain,
p262
aVrobbed me from ever getting to know him.
p263
aVThis is what suicide does.
p264
aVFor most suicidal folks,
p265
aVor those contemplating suicide,
p266
aVthey wouldn't think of hurting another person.
p267
aVThey just want their own pain to end.
p268
aVTypically, this is accomplished in just three ways:
p269
aVsleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.
p270
aVIn my career, I've responded to
p271
aVand been involved in hundreds
p272
aVof mental illness and suicide calls
p273
aVaround the bridge.
p274
aVOf those incidents I've been directly involved with,
p275
aVI've only lost two,
p276
aVbut that's two too many.
p277
aVOne was Jason.
p278
aVThe other was a man I spoke to
p279
aVfor about an hour.
p280
aVDuring that time, he shook my hand
p281
aVon three occasions.
p282
aVOn that final handshake,
p283
aVhe looked at me, and he said,
p284
aV"Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
p285
aVAnd he leapt.
p286
aVHorrible, absolutely horrible.
p287
aa(lp288
VI do want to tell you, though,
p289
aVthe vast majority of folks
p290
aVthat we do get to contact on that bridge
p291
aVdo not commit suicide.
p292
aVAdditionally, that very few
p293
aVwho have jumped off the bridge and lived
p294
aVand can talk about it,
p295
aVthat one to two percent,
p296
aVmost of those folks have said
p297
aVthat the second that they let go of that rail,
p298
aVthey knew that they had made a mistake
p299
aVand they wanted to live.
p300
aVI tell people, the bridge not only connects
p301
aVMarin to San Francisco,
p302
aVbut people together also.
p303
aVThat connection, or bridge that we make,
p304
aVis something that each and every one of us
p305
aVshould strive to do.
p306
aVSuicide is preventable.
p307
aVThere is help. There is hope.
p308
aa(lp309
VThank you very much.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Applause)

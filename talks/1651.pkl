VThis is how war starts.
p5
aVOne day you're living your ordinary life,
p6
aVyou're planning to go to a party,
p7
aVyou're taking your children to school,
p8
aVyou're making a dentist appointment.
p9
aVThe next thing, the telephones go out,
p10
aVthe TVs go out, there's armed men on the street,
p11
aVthere's roadblocks.
p12
aVYour life as you know it goes into suspended animation.
p13
aVIt stops.
p14
aa(lp15
VI'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine,
p16
aVa Bosnian friend, about what happened to her,
p17
aVbecause I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like.
p18
aVShe was walking to work one day in April, 1992,
p19
aVin a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.
p20
aVShe was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.
p21
aVGreat person.
p22
aVAnd suddenly she sees a tank
p23
aVambling down the main road of Sarajevo
p24
aVknocking everything out of its path.
p25
aVShe thinks she's dreaming, but she's not.
p26
aVAnd she runs as any of us would have done
p27
aVand takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin,
p28
aVin her high heels and her miniskirt.
p29
aVAnd as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous,
p30
aVbut she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers
p31
aVand people all over the place and chaos
p32
aVand she thinks, "I feel like Alice in Wonderland
p33
aVgoing down the rabbit hole,
p34
aVdown, down, down into chaos,
p35
aVand my life will never be the same again."
p36
aa(lp37
VA few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people
p38
aVpushing with her infant son in her arms
p39
aVto give him to a stranger on a bus,
p40
aVwhich was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo
p41
aVto take children out so they could be safe.
p42
aVAnd she remembers struggling with her mother to the front,
p43
aVcrowds and crowds of people, "Take my child! Take my child!"
p44
aVand passing her son to someone through a window.
p45
aVAnd she didn't see him for years.
p46
aVThe siege went on for three and a half years,
p47
aVand it was a siege without water,
p48
aVwithout power, without electricity, without heat, without food,
p49
aVin the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.
p50
aa(lp51
VI had the honor of being one of those reporters
p52
aVthat lived through that siege,
p53
aVand I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there
p54
aVbecause it's taught me everything,
p55
aVnot just about being a reporter, but about being a human being.
p56
aVI learned about compassion.
p57
aVI learned about ordinary people who could be heroes.
p58
aVI learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie.
p59
aVMost of all, I learned about love.
p60
aVEven in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos,
p61
aVI learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors,
p62
aVshare food, raise their children,
p63
aVdrag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road
p64
aVeven though you yourself were endangering your life,
p65
aVhelping people get into taxis who were injured
p66
aVto try to take them to hospitals.
p67
aa(lp68
VI learned so much about myself.
p69
aVMartha Gellhorn, who's one of my heroes, once said,
p70
aV"You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility."
p71
aVI went on to cover many, many, many wars after that,
p72
aVso many that I lost count,
p73
aVbut there was nothing like Sarajevo.
p74
aa(lp75
VLast April, I went back to a very strange \u2014
p76
aVwhat I called a deranged high school reunion.
p77
aVWhat it was, was the 20th anniversary of the siege,
p78
aVthe beginning of the siege of Sarajevo,
p79
aVand I don't like the word "anniversary," because it sounds like a party,
p80
aVand this was not a party.
p81
aVIt was a very somber gathering of the reporters
p82
aVthat worked there during the war, humanitarian aid workers,
p83
aVand of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves.
p84
aVAnd the thing that struck me the most,
p85
aVthat broke my heart,
p86
aVwas walking down the main street of Sarajevo,
p87
aVwhere my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago,
p88
aVand in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs,
p89
aVempty,
p90
aVand every single one of them symbolized
p91
aVa person who had died during the siege,
p92
aVjust in Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia,
p93
aVand it stretched from one end of the city
p94
aVto a large part of it,
p95
aVand the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs
p96
aVfor the children.
p97
aa(lp98
VI now cover Syria,
p99
aVand I started reporting it because I believed that
p100
aVit needs to be done.
p101
aVI believe a story there has to be told.
p102
aVI see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.
p103
aVAnd when I first arrived in Damascus,
p104
aVI saw this strange moment where people
p105
aVdidn't seem to believe that war was going to descend,
p106
aVand it was exactly the same in Bosnia
p107
aVand nearly every other country I've seen where war comes.
p108
aVPeople don't want to believe it's coming,
p109
aVso they don't leave, they don't leave before they can.
p110
aVThey don't get their money out.
p111
aVThey stay because you want to stay in your home.
p112
aVAnd then war and chaos descend.
p113
aa(lp114
VRwanda is a place that haunts me a lot.
p115
aVIn 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda.
p116
aVBetween April and August, 1994,
p117
aVone million people were slaughtered.
p118
aVNow if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out
p119
aVwith the sheer number,
p120
aVI want you just for a second to think of a million people.
p121
aVAnd to give you some example, I remember
p122
aVstanding and looking down a road as far as I could see,
p123
aVat least a mile, and there were bodies piled twice my height
p124
aVof the dead.
p125
aVAnd that was just a small percentage of the dead.
p126
aVAnd there were mothers holding their children
p127
aVwho had been caught in their last death throes.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo we learn a lot from war,
p130
aVand I mention Rwanda
p131
aVbecause it is one place, like South Africa,
p132
aVwhere nearly 20 years on, there is healing.
p133
aVFifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women,
p134
aVwhich is fantastic,
p135
aVand there's also within the national constitution now,
p136
aVyou're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.
p137
aVYou're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity,
p138
aVwhich is, of course, what started the slaughter in the first place.
p139
aVAnd an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story,
p140
aVor I find it beautiful.
p141
aVThere was a group of children, mixed Hutus and Tutsis,
p142
aVand a group of women who were adopting them,
p143
aVand they lined up and one was just given to the next.
p144
aVThere was no kind of compensation for, you're a Tutsi,
p145
aVyou're a Hutu, you might have killed my mother,
p146
aVyou might have killed my father.
p147
aVThey were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation,
p148
aVand I find this remarkable.
p149
aVSo when people ask me how I continue to cover war,
p150
aVand why I continue to do it,
p151
aVthis is why.
p152
aa(lp153
VWhen I go back to Syria, next week in fact,
p154
aVwhat I see is incredibly heroic people,
p155
aVsome of them fighting for democracy,
p156
aVfor things we take for granted every single day.
p157
aVAnd that's pretty much why I do it.
p158
aa(lp159
VIn 2004, I had a little baby boy,
p160
aVand I call him my miracle child,
p161
aVbecause after seeing so much death
p162
aVand destruction and chaos and darkness in my life,
p163
aVthis ray of hope was born.
p164
aVAnd I called him Luca, which means "The bringer of light,"
p165
aVbecause he does bring light to my life.
p166
aVBut I'm talking about him because when he was four months old,
p167
aVmy foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad
p168
aVwhere I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime
p169
aVand during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards,
p170
aVand I remember getting on the plane in tears,
p171
aVcrying to be separated from my son,
p172
aVand while I was there,
p173
aVa quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine
p174
aVsaid to me, "What are you doing here?
p175
aVWhy aren't you home with Luca?"
p176
aVAnd I said, "Well, I have to see." It was 2004
p177
aVwhich was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq,
p178
aV"I have to see, I have to see what is happening here.
p179
aVI have to report it."
p180
aVAnd he said, "Go home,
p181
aVbecause if you miss his first tooth,
p182
aVif you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself.
p183
aVBut there will always be another war."
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd there, sadly, will always be wars.
p186
aVAnd I am deluding myself if I think, as a journalist,
p187
aVas a reporter, as a writer,
p188
aVwhat I do can stop them. I can't.
p189
aVI'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war.
p190
aVHe tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it.
p191
aVI'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person.
p192
aVI'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor,
p193
aVand I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt
p194
aVto have people dying in front of me, and I couldn't save them.
p195
aVAll I am is a witness.
p196
aVMy role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless.
p197
aVA colleague of mine described it as to shine a light
p198
aVin the darkest corners of the world.
p199
aVAnd that's what I try to do.
p200
aVI'm not always successful,
p201
aVand sometimes it's incredibly frustrating,
p202
aVbecause you feel like you're writing into a void,
p203
aVor you feel like no one cares.
p204
aVWho cares about Syria? Who cares about Bosnia?
p205
aVWho cares about the Congo,
p206
aVthe Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone,
p207
aVall of these strings of places that
p208
aVI will remember for the rest of my life?
p209
aVBut my métier is to bear witness
p210
aVand that is the crux, the heart of the matter,
p211
aVfor us reporters who do this.
p212
aVAnd all I can really do is hope,
p213
aVnot to policymakers or politicians,
p214
aVbecause as much as I'd like to have faith
p215
aVthat they read my words and do something,
p216
aVI don't delude myself.
p217
aa(lp218
VBut what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said
p219
aVor any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast,
p220
aVif you can remember the story of Sarajevo,
p221
aVor the story of Rwanda,
p222
aVthen I've done my job.
p223
aa(lp224
VThank you very much.

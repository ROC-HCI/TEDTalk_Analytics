VYou know, we're going to do things a little differently.
p5
aVI'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you.
p6
aVAnd at the same time, we're going to look at just images
p7
aVfrom a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that \u2014
p8
aVsnapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating.
p9
aVYou can \u2014 I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures
p10
aVthat you see on screen that come from there.
p11
aVI thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this,
p12
aVand then get John back out here so we can talk interactively
p13
aVa little bit more and think and ask questions.
p14
aVYou know, I guess the first question is,
p15
aVwhy build a virtual world at all?
p16
aVAnd I think the answer to that is always going to be
p17
aVat least driven to a certain extent by the people
p18
aVinitially crazy enough to start the project, you know.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo I can give you a little bit of first background just on me
p21
aVand what moved me as a \u2014 really going back as far as a teenager
p22
aVand then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing.
p23
aVI was a very creative kid who read a lot, and got into electronics first,
p24
aVand then later, programming computers, when I was really young.
p25
aVI was just always trying to make things.
p26
aVI was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things,
p27
aVand just anything I could do with my hands or with wood
p28
aVor electronics or metal or anything else.
p29
aVAnd so, for example \u2014 and it's a great Second Life thing \u2014 I had a bedroom.
p30
aVAnd every kid, you know, as a teenager, has got his bedroom he retreats to \u2014
p31
aVbut I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went up
p32
aVrather than opened, like on Star Trek.
p33
aVI thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling
p34
aVand I cut through the ceiling joists, much to my parents' delight,
p35
aVand put the door, you know, being pulled up through the ceiling.
p36
aa(lp37
VI built \u2014 I put a garage-door opener up in the attic
p38
aVthat would pull this door up.
p39
aVYou can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house
p40
aVand the displeasure of my parents.
p41
aVThe thing that was always striking to me was that we as people
p42
aVcould have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do,
p43
aVbut are so often unable, in the real world, to actually do those things \u2014
p44
aVto actually cobble together the materials
p45
aVand go through the actual execution phase of building something
p46
aVthat you imagine from a design perspective.
p47
aVAnd so for me, I know that when the Internet came around
p48
aVand I was doing computer programming and just, you know,
p49
aVjust generally trying to run my own little company
p50
aVand figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers,
p51
aVI was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing
p52
aVthat you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers
p53
aVwould be to use the Internet and connected computers
p54
aVto simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics
p55
aVand the rules of how things went together \u2014
p56
aVthe sort of \u2014 the idea of atoms and how to make things,
p57
aVand do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so for me that was the thing that was so enticing.
p60
aVI just wanted this place where you could build things.
p61
aVAnd so I think you see that in the genesis
p62
aVof what has happened with Second Life, and I think it's important.
p63
aVI also think that more generally, the use of the Internet and technology
p64
aVas a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend.
p65
aVIt is a \u2014 sort of a great human progress.
p66
aVTechnology is just generally being used to allow us to create
p67
aVin as shared and social a way as possible.
p68
aVAnd I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally
p69
aVrepresent the best we can do to achieve that right now.
p70
aVYou know, another way to look at that,
p71
aVand related to the content and, you know, thinking about space,
p72
aVis to connect sort of virtual worlds to space.
p73
aVI thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second.
p74
aVIf you think about going into space, it's a fascinating thing.
p75
aVSo many movies, so many kids, we all sort of
p76
aVdream about exploring space. Now, why is that?
p77
aVStop for a moment and ask, why that conceit?
p78
aVWhy do we as people want to do that?
p79
aVI think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies \u2014
p80
aVyou know, it's this dream that we all share.
p81
aa(lp82
VOne is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again.
p83
aVIn some sense, you would become someone else in that journey,
p84
aVbecause there wouldn't be \u2014 you'd leave society and life as you know it, behind.
p85
aVAnd so inevitably, you would transform yourself \u2014
p86
aVirreversibly, in all likelihood \u2014 as you began this exploration.
p87
aVAnd then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense
p88
aVthat if you travel far enough, you can find out there \u2014
p89
aVoh, yeah \u2014 you have no idea what you're going to find
p90
aVonce you get there, into space.
p91
aVIt's going to be different than here.
p92
aVAnd in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth
p93
aVthat anything is going to be possible.
p94
aVSo that's kind of the idea \u2014 we as humans crave the idea of
p95
aVcreating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible.
p96
aVAnd I think that if you really sit and think about it,
p97
aVvirtual worlds, and where we're going
p98
aVwith more and more computing technology,
p99
aVrepresent essentially the likely, really tactically possible
p100
aVversion of space exploration.
p101
aVWe are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because, like space,
p102
aVthey allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything
p103
aVand everything, and probably anything could happen there.
p104
aa(lp105
VYou know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know,
p106
aVcomparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of \u2014
p107
aVand then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s.
p108
aVIn fact, Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '90s today:
p109
aVeverybody's very excited,
p110
aVthere's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next
p111
aVfrom moment to moment, and then there's despair
p112
aVand everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work.
p113
aVEverything that's happening with Second Life
p114
aVand more broadly with virtual worlds, all happened in the early '90s.
p115
aVWe always play a game at the office where you can take any article
p116
aVand find the same article where you just replace the words "Second Life"
p117
aVwith "Web," and "virtual reality" with "Internet."
p118
aVYou can find exactly the same articles
p119
aVwritten about everything that people are observing.
p120
aVTo give you an idea of scale, Second Life is about 20,000 CPUs at this point.
p121
aVIt's about 20,000 computers connected together
p122
aVin three facilities in the United States right now,
p123
aVthat are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself \u2014
p124
aVthere's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there,
p125
aVso the kind of, active population is something like a smallish city.
p126
aVThe space itself is about 10 times the size of San Francisco,
p127
aVand it's about as densely built out.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo it gives you an idea of scale. Now, it's expanding very rapidly \u2014
p130
aVabout five percent a month or so right now, in terms of new servers being added.
p131
aVAnd so of course, radically unlike the real world,
p132
aVand like the Internet, the whole thing is expanding
p133
aVvery, very quickly, and historically exponentially.
p134
aVSo that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here
p135
aVby the amount of content that's in there,
p136
aVand I think that amount is critical.
p137
aVIt was critical with the virtual world
p138
aVthat it be this space of truly infinite possibility.
p139
aVWe're very sensitive to that as humans.
p140
aVYou know, you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space
p141
aVand you know when you can't.
p142
aVSecond Life today is this 20,000 machines,
p143
aVand it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know,
p144
aVan object would be something like this, possibly interactive.
p145
aVTens of millions of them are thinking all the time;
p146
aVthey have code attached to them.
p147
aVSo it's a really large world already, in terms of the amount of stuff that's there
p148
aVand that's very important.
p149
aVIf anybody plays, like, World of Warcraft,
p150
aVWorld of Warcraft comes on, like, four DVDs.
p151
aVSecond Life, by comparison, has about 100 terabytes
p152
aVof user-created data, making it about 25,000 times larger.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo again, like the Internet compared to AOL,
p155
aVand the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time,
p156
aVwhat's happening here is something very different,
p157
aVbecause the sheer scale of what people can do
p158
aVwhen they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing.
p159
aVThe last big thought is that it is almost certainly true
p160
aVthat whatever this is going to evolve into
p161
aVis going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself.
p162
aVAnd let me justify that with two statements.
p163
aVGenerically, what we use the Web for is to organize, exchange,
p164
aVcreate and consume information.
p165
aVIt's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data-driven.
p166
aVI'd say I kind of think about the world as being information.
p167
aVEverything that we interact with, all the experiences that we have,
p168
aVis kind of us flowing through a sea of information
p169
aVand interacting with it in different ways.
p170
aVThe Web puts information in the form of text and images.
p171
aVThe topology, the geography of the Web is text-to-text links for the most part.
p172
aVThat's one way of organizing information,
p173
aVbut there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world
p174
aVthat I think are the important ways that they're very different
p175
aVand much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe first is that, as I said, the \u2014
p178
aVwell, the first difference for virtual worlds is that
p179
aVinformation is presented to you in the virtual world
p180
aVusing the most powerful iconic symbols
p181
aVthat you can possibly use with human beings.
p182
aVSo for example, C-H-A-I-R is the English word for that,
p183
aVbut a picture of this is a universal symbol.
p184
aVEverybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it.
p185
aVIt's also more memorable if I show you that picture,
p186
aVand I show you C-H-A-I-R on a piece of paper.
p187
aVYou can do tests that show that you'll remember
p188
aVthat I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better.
p189
aVSo when you organize information using the symbols of our memory,
p190
aVusing the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives,
p191
aVyou maximally both excite, stimulate,
p192
aVare able to remember, transfer and manipulate data.
p193
aVAnd so virtual worlds are the best way
p194
aVfor us to essentially organize and experience information.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years \u2014
p197
aVyou know, that 3D, that lifelike environments
p198
aVare really important in some magical way to us.
p199
aVBut the second thing \u2014 and I think this one is less obvious \u2014
p200
aVis that the experience of creating, consuming, exploring that information
p201
aVis in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social.
p202
aVYou are always there with other people.
p203
aVAnd we as humans are social creatures and must, or are aided by,
p204
aVor enjoy more, the consumption of information in the presence of others.
p205
aVIt's essential to us. You can't escape it.
p206
aVWhen you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever,
p207
aVyou're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people,
p208
aVbut you can't talk to them.
p209
aVYou can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras
p210
aVon the same page as you, and ask them,
p211
aV"Hey, have you seen one of these before? Because I'm thinking about buying it."
p212
aa(lp213
VThat experience of like, shopping together, just as a simple example,
p214
aVis an example of how as social creatures
p215
aVwe want to experience information in that way.
p216
aVSo that second point, that we inherently experience information together
p217
aVor want to experience it together,
p218
aVis critical to essentially, kind of,
p219
aVthis trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us.
p220
aVAnd so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or so
p221
aVthese virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings
p222
aVthat we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will,
p223
aVto be together, to consume information.
p224
aVYou know, mapping in India \u2014 that's such a great example.
p225
aVMaybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time.
p226
aVAsking for advice, rather than any possible way
p227
aVthat you could just statically organize a map.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo I think that's another big point.
p230
aVI think that wherever this is all going,
p231
aVwhether it's Second Life or its descendants, or something broader
p232
aVthat happens all around the world at a lot of different points \u2014
p233
aVthis is what we're going to see the Internet used for,
p234
aVand total traffic and total unique users is going to invert,
p235
aVso that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information
p236
aVis going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern,
p237
aVbut the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment.
p238
aVBig idea, but I think highly defensible.
p239
aVSo let me stop there and bring John back,
p240
aVand maybe we can just have a longer conversation.
p241
aVThank you. John. That's great.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)
p244
aa(lp245
VJohn Hockenberry: Why is the creation, the impulse to create Second Life,
p246
aVnot a utopian impulse?
p247
aVLike for example, in the 19th century,
p248
aVany number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds
p249
aVwere explicitly utopian.
p250
aa(lp251
VPhilip Rosedale: I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah.
p252
aVIs a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it.
p253
aVThe answer is no, and I think the reason why is because
p254
aVthe Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up.
p255
aVThat idea of infinite possibility, that magic of anything can happen,
p256
aVonly happens in an environment
p257
aVwhere you really know that there's a fundamental freedom
p258
aVat the level of the individual actor, at the level of the Lego blocks,
p259
aVif you will, that make up the virtual world.
p260
aVYou have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that,
p261
aVyou know, is there a, kind of, utopian or,
p262
aVis there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it,
p263
aVthat you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it?
p264
aVThose top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody,
p265
aVeven if you mean well when you build them.
p266
aVAnd what's more, human society, when it's controlled,
p267
aVwhen you set out a grand scheme of rules,
p268
aVa new way of people interacting, or a new way of laying out a city, or whatever,
p269
aVthat stuff historically has never scaled much beyond,
p270
aVyou know \u2014 I always laughingly say \u2014 the Mall of America, you know,
p271
aVwhich is like, the largest piece of centrally designed architecture
p272
aVthat, you know, has been built.
p273
aa(lp274
VJH: The Kremlin was pretty big.
p275
aa(lp276
VPR: The Kremlin, yeah. That's true. The whole complex.
p277
aa(lp278
VJH: Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning
p279
aVin Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use
p280
aVin the creation of their avatars or in communicating
p281
aVthat people actually in practice said, no, I'm not interested in that at all,
p282
aVand name something that you didn't come up with
p283
aVthat almost immediately people began to demand.
p284
aa(lp285
VPR: I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those.
p286
aVOne of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life \u2014
p287
aVI was really passionate about it.
p288
aVIt was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody
p289
aVand have a more private conversation,
p290
aVbut it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody.
p291
aVIt was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat.
p292
aVI just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design.
p293
aVI thought it was such a good idea from my perspective,
p294
aVand it was just absolutely never used, and we ultimately \u2014
p295
aVI think we've now turned it off, if I remember.
p296
aVWe finally gave up, took it out of the code.
p297
aVBut more generally, you know, one other example I think about this,
p298
aVwhich is great relative to the utopian idea.
p299
aVSecond Life originally had 16 simulators. It now has 20,000.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo when it only had 16,
p302
aVit was only about as big as this college campus.
p303
aVAnd we had \u2014 we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub,
p304
aVwe put a disco where you could dance,
p305
aVand then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to,
p306
aVand we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island.
p307
aVAnd we laid out the zoning, but of course,
p308
aVpeople could build all around it however they wanted to.
p309
aVAnd what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea
p310
aVthat we had put out in the zoning concept, basically,
p311
aVwas instantly and thoroughly ignored,
p312
aVand like, two months into the whole thing,
p313
aV\u2014 which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time \u2014
p314
aVI remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life,
p315
aVthe residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco \u2014
p316
aVbecause I had built it \u2014 we want to buy that land and raze it
p317
aVand put houses on it. And I sold it to them \u2014
p318
aVI mean, we transferred ownership and they had a big party
p319
aVand blew up the entire building.
p320
aVAnd I remember that that was just so telling, you know,
p321
aVthat you didn't know exactly what was going to happen.
p322
aVWhen you think about stuff that people have built that's popular \u2014
p323
aa(lp324
VJH: CBGB's has to close eventually, you know. That's the rule.
p325
aa(lp326
VPR: Exactly. And it \u2014 but it closed on day one, basically, in Internet time.
p327
aVYou know, an example of something \u2014 pregnancy.
p328
aVYou can have a baby in Second Life.
p329
aVThis is done entirely using, kind of, the tools that are built into Second Life,
p330
aVso the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby, of course \u2014
p331
aVSecond Life is, at the platform level, at the level of the company \u2014 at Linden Lab \u2014
p332
aVSecond Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.
p333
aVThere is no attempt to structure the experience,
p334
aVto make it utopian in that sense that we put into it.
p335
aVSo of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know,
p336
aVtaking two avatars and merging them, or something.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut people built the ability to have babies and care for babies
p339
aVas a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so \u2014
p340
aVI mean, that's a pretty fascinating example of, you know,
p341
aVwhat goes on in the overall economy.
p342
aVAnd of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.
p343
aVI didn't talk about it, but it's a critical feature.
p344
aVWhen people are given the opportunity to create in the world,
p345
aVthere's really two things they want.
p346
aVOne is fair ownership of the things they create.
p347
aVAnd then the second one is \u2014 if they feel like it,
p348
aVand they're not going to do it in every case, but in many they are \u2014
p349
aVthey want to actually be able to sell that creation
p350
aVas a way of providing for their own livelihood.
p351
aVTrue on the Web \u2014 also true in Second Life.
p352
aVAnd so the existence of an economy is critical.
p353
aa(lp354
VJH: Questions for Philip Rosedale? Right here.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Audience: Well, first an observation, which is that you look like a character.)
p357
aa(lp358
VJH: The observation is, Philip has been accused of looking like a character,
p359
aVan avatar, in Second Life.
p360
aVRespond, and then we'll get the rest of your question.
p361
aa(lp362
VPR: But I don't look like my avatar.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
VHow many people here know what my avatar looks like?
p367
aVThat's probably not very many.
p368
aa(lp369
VJH: Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that, sort of \u2014
p370
aVPR: No, no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar \u2014
p371
aVa female avatar \u2014 that I used to be once in a while.
p372
aVBut my avatar is a guy wearing chaps.
p373
aVSpiky hair \u2014 spikier than this. Kind of orange hair.
p374
aVHandlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character.
p375
aVSo, very cool.
p376
aa(lp377
VJH: And your question?
p378
aa(lp379
V(Audience: [Unclear].)
p380
aa(lp381
VJH: The question is, there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in Second Life.
p382
aVIt doesn't seem to have its own culture,
p383
aVand the sort of differences that exist in the real world
p384
aVaren't translated into the Second Life map.
p385
aa(lp386
VPR: Well, first of all, we're very early,
p387
aVso this has only been going on for a few years.
p388
aVAnd so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior
p389
aVthat you see in emerging societies.
p390
aVSo a fair criticism \u2014 is what it is \u2014 of Second Life today is that
p391
aVit's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome, from a cultural standpoint.
p392
aVThat said, the evolution of, and the nuanced interaction that creates culture,
p393
aVis happening at 10 times the speed of the real world,
p394
aVand in an environment where, if you walk into a bar in Second Life,
p395
aV65 percent of the people there are not in the United States,
p396
aVand in fact are speaking their, you know, various and different languages.
p397
aVIn fact, one of the ways to make money in Second Life
p398
aVis to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body
p399
aVand they basically, kind of, pop up on your screen
p400
aVand allow you to use Google or Babel Fish
p401
aVor one of the other online text translators to on-the-fly
p402
aVtranslate spoken \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 typed text between individuals.
p403
aVAnd so, the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot
p404
aVthat's happening inside Second Life is quite \u2014
p405
aVI think, quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms
p406
aVin the real world we've ever been able to achieve.
p407
aVSo, I think that culture will fine-tune, it will emerge,
p408
aVbut we still have some years to wait while that happens,
p409
aVas you would naturally expect.
p410
aa(lp411
VJH: Other questions? Right here.
p412
aa(lp413
V(Audience: What's your demographic?)
p414
aa(lp415
VJH: What's your demographic?
p416
aVPR: So, the question is, what's the demographic.
p417
aVSo, the average age of a person in Second Life is 32,
p418
aVhowever, the use of Second Life increases dramatically
p419
aVas your physical age increases. So as you go from age 30 to age 60 \u2014
p420
aVand there are many people in their sixties using Second Life \u2014
p421
aVthis is also not a sharp curve \u2014 it's very, very distributed \u2014
p422
aVusage goes up in terms of, like, hours per week by 40 percent
p423
aVas you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life, so there's not \u2014
p424
aVmany people make the mistake of believing that Second Life
p425
aVis some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing \u2014
p426
aVI'm just speaking broadly and critically \u2014
p427
aVit's not very appealing to people that play online video games,
p428
aVbecause the graphics are not yet equivalent to \u2014
p429
aVI mean, these are very nice pictures,
p430
aVbut in general the graphics are not quite equivalent
p431
aVto the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto 4.
p432
aVSo average age: 32. I mentioned
p433
aV65 percent of the users are not in the United States.
p434
aVThe distribution amongst countries is extremely broad.
p435
aa(lp436
VThere's users from, you know, virtually every country in the world now in Second Life.
p437
aVThe dominant ones are \u2014 if you take the UK and Europe,
p438
aVtogether they make up about 55 percent of the usage base in Second Life.
p439
aVIn terms of psychographic \u2014
p440
aVoh, men and women: men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life,
p441
aVso about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women.
p442
aVWomen use Second Life, though,
p443
aVabout 30 to 40 percent more, on an hours basis, than men do,
p444
aVmeaning that more men sign up than women,
p445
aVand more women stay and use it than men.
p446
aVSo that's another demographic fact.
p447
aVIn terms of psychographic, you know, the people in Second Life
p448
aVare remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think,
p449
aVwhen you go in and talk to them and meet them, and I would, you know,
p450
aVchallenge you to just do this and find out.
p451
aVBut it's not a bunch of programmers.
p452
aVIt's not easy to describe as a demographic.
p453
aVIf I had to just sort of paint a broad picture, I'd say, remember the people
p454
aVwho were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay?
p455
aVMaybe a little bit like that: in other words, people who are early adopters.
p456
aVThey tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial.
p457
aVA lot of them \u2014 about 55,000 people so far \u2014 are cash-flow positive:
p458
aVthey're making money from what \u2014 I mean, real-world money \u2014
p459
aVfrom what they're doing in Second Life, so it's a very build \u2014
p460
aVstill a creative, building things, build-your-own-business
p461
aVtype of an orientation. So, that's it.
p462
aa(lp463
VJH: You describe yourself, Philip, as someone who was really creative
p464
aVwhen you were young and, you know, liked to make things.
p465
aVI mean, it's not often that you hear somebody
p466
aVdescribe themselves as really creative.
p467
aVI suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student
p468
aVwho spent a lot of time in his room? Is it possible?
p469
aa(lp470
V(Laughter)
p471
aa(lp472
VPR: I was a \u2014 there were times I was a C student. You know, it's funny.
p473
aVWhen I got to college \u2014 I studied physics in college \u2014
p474
aVand I got really \u2014 it was funny,
p475
aVbecause I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time.
p476
aVI was shy. I don't seem like it now, but I was very shy.
p477
aVMoved around a bunch \u2014 had that experience too.
p478
aVSo I did, kind of, I think, live in my own world,
p479
aVand obviously that helps, you know, engage your real interest in something.
p480
aa(lp481
VJH: So you're on your fifth life at this point?
p482
aa(lp483
VPR: If you count, yeah, cities. So \u2014 but I did \u2014
p484
aVand I didn't do \u2014 I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right.
p485
aVI wasn't, like, an obsessed \u2014 you know, get A's kind of guy.
p486
aVI was going to say, I had a great social experience
p487
aVwhen I went to college that I hadn't had before,
p488
aVa more fraternal experience, where I met six or seven other guys
p489
aVwho I studied physics with, and I was very competitive with them,
p490
aVso then I started to get A's. But you're right: I wasn't an A student.
p491
aa(lp492
VJH: Last question. Right here.
p493
aa(lp494
V(Audience: In the pamphlet, there's a statement \u2014 )
p495
aa(lp496
VJH: You want to paraphrase that?
p497
aa(lp498
VPR: Yeah, so let me restate that.
p499
aVSo, you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement
p500
aVthat we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones \u2014
p501
aVour more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities \u2014
p502
aVand that in fact, much of human life and human experience
p503
aVmay move into the digital realm.
p504
aVAnd then that's kind of a horrifying thought, of course.
p505
aVThat's a frightening change, frightening disruption.
p506
aVI guess, and you're asking, what do I think about that? How do I \u2014
p507
aa(lp508
VJH: What's your response to the people who would say, that's horrifying?
p509
aa(lp510
V(Audience: If someone would say to you, I find that disturbing,
p511
aVwhat would be your response?)
p512
aa(lp513
VPR: Well, I'd say a couple of things.
p514
aVOne is, it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was.
p515
aVThat is to say, it's a big change, but it isn't avoidable.
p516
aVSo, no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior
p517
aVor political behavior is going to keep these technology changes
p518
aVfrom connecting us together,
p519
aVbecause the basic motive that people have \u2014
p520
aVto be creative and entrepreneurial \u2014 is going to drive energy
p521
aVinto these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web.
p522
aVSo this change, I believe, is a huge disruptive change.
p523
aa(lp524
VObviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here,
p525
aVbut I think that as \u2014 even a sober, you know, the most sober,
p526
aVdisconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side,
p527
aVhas to conclude, based on the data,
p528
aVthat with those kinds of economic forces at play,
p529
aVthere is definitely going to be a sea change,
p530
aVand that change is going to be intensely disruptive
p531
aVrelative to our concept of our very lives and being,
p532
aVand our identities, as well.
p533
aVI don't think we can get away from those changes.
p534
aVI think generally, we were talking about this \u2014
p535
aVI think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it,
p536
aVbeing \u2014 surviving there, having a good life there, so to speak,
p537
aVis a challenge because of the multiculturality of it,
p538
aVbecause of the languages, because of the entrepreneurial richness of it,
p539
aVthe sort of flea market nature, if you will, of the virtual world today.
p540
aa(lp541
VIt puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves, in many ways.
p542
aVWe must learn things and, you know, be more tolerant,
p543
aVand be smarter and learn faster and be more creative, perhaps,
p544
aVthan we are typically in our real lives.
p545
aVAnd I think that if that is true of virtual worlds,
p546
aVthen these changes, though scary \u2014 and, I say, inevitable \u2014
p547
aVare ultimately for the better,
p548
aVand therefore something that we should ride out.
p549
aVBut I would say that \u2014 and many other authors and speakers about this,
p550
aVother than me, have said, you know, fasten your seat belts
p551
aVbecause the change is coming. There are going to be big changes.
p552
aVJH: Philip Rosedale, thank you very much.

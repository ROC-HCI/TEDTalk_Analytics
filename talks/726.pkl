VSo, 120 years ago,
p5
aVDr. Röntgen X-rayed his wife's hand.
p6
aVQuite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor
p7
aVwith her brooch, I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me.
p8
aVThat image was the start of the X-ray technology.
p9
aVAnd I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.
p10
aVI'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe first shot I ever did
p13
aVwas of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know,
p14
aVso I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.
p15
aVBut the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.
p16
aVAnd I do really like this shot, because
p17
aVit shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded
p18
aVin the sole of the sneakers.
p19
aVIt was just one of those pot-luck things where you
p20
aVget it right first time.
p21
aa(lp22
VMoving on to something a bit larger,
p23
aVthis is an X-ray of a bus.
p24
aVAnd the bus is full of people.
p25
aVIt's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton.
p26
aVAnd back in the '60s,
p27
aVthey used to teach student radiographers
p28
aVto take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I,
p29
aVbut on dead people.
p30
aVSo, I've still got access to one of these dead people
p31
aVcalled Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid,
p32
aVbecause she's very old and fragile.
p33
aVBut everyone on that bus is Frieda.
p34
aVAnd the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray,
p35
aVwhich is the sort of machine you have on borders,
p36
aVwhich checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things.
p37
aa(lp38
VFairly obvious what that is.
p39
aVSo, using large-scale objects
p40
aVdoes sort of create drama
p41
aVbecause you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.
p42
aVTechnology is moving ahead,
p43
aVand these large cargo scanner X-rays
p44
aVthat work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.
p45
aVAgain though, to make it come alive
p46
aVyou need, somehow, to add the human element.
p47
aVAnd I think the reason this image works, again, is because
p48
aVFrieda is driving the bulldozer.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VQuite a difficult brief,
p52
aVmake a pair of men's pants look beautiful.
p53
aVBut I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are.
p54
aVFashion \u2014 now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I
p55
aVdon't show the surface, I show what's within.
p56
aVSo, the fashionistas don't really like me
p57
aVbecause it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it,
p58
aVit looks the same.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aVWe all look the same inside, believe me.
p61
aVThe creases in the material and the sort of nuances.
p62
aVAnd I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.
p63
aVI peel back the layers and expose it.
p64
aVAnd if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd I'm sure Ross can associate that with design.
p67
aVThe design comes from within.
p68
aVIt's not just Topshop,
p69
aVI get some strange looks when I go out getting my props.
p70
aVHere I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department
p71
aVof a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.
p72
aVI live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died.
p73
aVAnd what's really interesting is,
p74
aVif you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.
p75
aVAnd should that pig have grown,
p76
aVunfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead
p77
aVafter I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVBut once the bones had fused together
p80
aVit would have been healthy.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, that's an empty parka jacket.
p83
aVBut I quite love the way it's posed.
p84
aVNature is my greatest inspiration.
p85
aVAnd to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with
p86
aVis how nature is related to architecture.
p87
aVIf you look at the roof of the Eden Project,
p88
aVor the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure.
p89
aVAnd I'm sure those architects are inspired,
p90
aVas I am, by what surrounds us, by nature.
p91
aVThis, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf
p92
aVthat floats on the top of a pond.
p93
aVAn amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional.
p94
aVSeaweed, ebbing in the tide.
p95
aVNow, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing.
p96
aa(lp97
VThis is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed.
p98
aVAnd the door to my X-ray room
p99
aVis made of lead and steel.
p100
aVIt weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVThe walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete.
p103
aVSo, I'm using quite a lot of radiation.
p104
aVA lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.
p105
aVAnd there I am. This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine.
p106
aVWhat's interesting really about X-ray really
p107
aVis, if you think about it, is that that technology
p108
aVis used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs,
p109
aVor looking for contraband or whatever.
p110
aVAnd I use that sort of technology
p111
aVto create things that are quite beautiful.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo, still working with film, I'm afraid.
p114
aVTechnology in X-ray where it's life-size processed,
p115
aVapart from these large cargo-scanning machines,
p116
aVhasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image
p117
aVand the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it,
p118
aVwhich is show my pictures big.
p119
aVSo, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner,
p120
aVwhich was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film.
p121
aVThey scan each individual X-ray.
p122
aVAnd this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays.
p123
aVSo, this is, again, my daughter's dress.
p124
aVStill has the tag in it from me buying it,
p125
aVso I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it.
p126
aVBut there are four X-ray plates.
p127
aVYou can see them overlapping.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, when you move forward from something fairly small,
p130
aVa dress which is this size,
p131
aVonto something like that which is done in exactly the same process,
p132
aVyou can see that that is a lot of work.
p133
aVIn fact, that is three months solid X-raying.
p134
aVThere is over 500 separate components.
p135
aVBoeing sent me a 747 in containers.
p136
aVAnd I sent them back an X-ray.
p137
aV(Laughter) I kid you not.
p138
aa(lp139
VOkay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton.
p140
aVThis, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.
p141
aVOne on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.
p142
aVThe one on the left is an x-ray.
p143
aVBut this time I had to use a real body.
p144
aVBecause I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real,
p145
aVto make it look like it was a real athlete.
p146
aVSo, here I had to use a recently deceased body.
p147
aVAnd getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious.
p148
aVBut people do donate their bodies to art and science.
p149
aVAnd when they do, I'm in the queue.
p150
aVSo, I like to use them.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VThe coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.
p154
aVIt makes it more organic, more natural.
p155
aVIt's whatever takes my fancy, really.
p156
aVIt's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.
p157
aVThat flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.
p158
aVBut I just like it in bright orange.
p159
aVAnd also with something technical, like these are DJ decks,
p160
aVit sort of adds another level.
p161
aVIt makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe most difficult things to X-ray,
p164
aVthe most technically challenging things to X-ray
p165
aVare the lightest things, the most delicate things.
p166
aVTo get the detail in a feather,
p167
aVbelieve me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays,
p168
aVthat's quite a challenge.
p169
aVI'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side.
p170
aa(lp171
VVideo: (Music)
p172
aVThe thing in there is very dangerous.
p173
aVIf you touch that, you could possibly die
p174
aVthrough radiation poisoning.
p175
aVIn my career I've had two exposures to radiation,
p176
aVwhich is two too many, because it stays with you for life.
p177
aVIt's cumulative.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Music)
p180
aVIt has human connotations.
p181
aVThe fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize,
p182
aVbut also it looks like it's a robot,
p183
aVand it comes from a sci-fi genus.
p184
aVIt's a surprise that it has humanity,
p185
aVbut also man-made, future, alien associations.
p186
aVAnd it's just a bit spooky.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Music)
p189
aVThe bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine,
p190
aVwhich is used on the borders
p191
aVbetween countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.
p192
aVThe lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices
p193
aVof X-rays through the lorry.
p194
aVAnd that's how this was done. It's actually slice, slice.
p195
aVIt's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices.
p196
aVAnd then if you look carefully, there is all little things.
p197
aVHe's got headphones on, reading the newspaper,
p198
aVgot a hat on, glasses, got a bag.
p199
aVSo, these little details
p200
aVhelp to make it work, make it real.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Music)
p203
aVThe problem with using living people is that
p204
aVto take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.
p205
aVSo, to avoid that \u2014
p206
aVI have to avoid it somehow \u2014
p207
aVis I use dead people.
p208
aVNow, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies,
p209
aVto a skeleton that was used by student radiographers
p210
aVto train in taking X-rays of the human body,
p211
aVat different densities.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Music)
p214
aVI have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Music)
p217
aVI will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds,
p218
aVI'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.
p219
aVBecause it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.
p220
aVLook at this monster.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Music)
p223
aVIt's so basic. It just grows wild.
p224
aVThat's what I really like about it,
p225
aVthe fact that I haven't got to go and buy it,
p226
aVand it hasn't been genetically modified at all.
p227
aVIt's just happening.
p228
aVAnd the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.
p229
aVNot that that is particularly beautiful
p230
aVwhen you look at it with the human eye,
p231
aVthe way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other.
p232
aVSo the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.
p233
aVThe thicker the object, the more radiation it needs,
p234
aVand the more time it needs.
p235
aVThe lighter the object, the less radiation.
p236
aVSometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail.
p237
aVThe longer the exposure goes on for,
p238
aVthe more detail you get.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Music)
p241
aVIf you look at this, just the tube,
p242
aVit is quite bright.
p243
aVBut I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer.
p244
aVSo, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.
p245
aVWhat I like is how hard the edges are,
p246
aVhow sharp.
p247
aVYeah, I'm quite pleased with it.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Music)
p250
aVI travel beyond the surface and show
p251
aVsomething for what it's worth,
p252
aVfor what it's really made of, how it really works.
p253
aVBut also I find that
p254
aVI've got the benefit of taking away all the surface,
p255
aVwhich is things that people are used to seeing.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd that's the sort of thing I've been doing.
p258
aVI've got the opportunity now to show you
p259
aVwhat I'm going to be doing in the future.
p260
aVThis is a commercial application of my most recent work.
p261
aVAnd what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time,
p262
aVlike you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision
p263
aVand you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera.
p264
aVUnfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.
p265
aVI do dream in X-ray. I see my projects in my sleep.
p266
aVAnd I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, what am I doing in the future?
p269
aVWell, this year is the 50th anniversary
p270
aVof Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.
p271
aVSo, I've taken it apart, component by component,
p272
aVmonths and months and months of work.
p273
aVAnd with this image, I'm going to be displaying
p274
aVit in the Victoria and Albert Museum
p275
aVas a light box, which is actually attached to the car.
p276
aVSo, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle,
p277
aVnot an easy task, in itself.
p278
aVAnd then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down,
p279
aVand up against you is a wall.
p280
aVAnd if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car,
p281
aVyou see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd I'm going to take that idea
p284
aVand apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life.
p285
aVLike, my first computer was a big movement in my life.
p286
aVAnd I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box.
p287
aVAnd I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray.
p288
aVI'm also looking to
p289
aVtake my work from the two-dimensional form
p290
aVto a more three-dimensional form.
p291
aVAnd this is quite a good way of doing it.
p292
aVI'm also working now with X-ray video.
p293
aVSo, if you can imagine, some of these flowers,
p294
aVand they're actually moving and growing
p295
aVand you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.
p296
aVBut that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much.
p297

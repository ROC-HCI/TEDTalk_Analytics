VWhat I want to talk to you about today is
p5
aVvirtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.
p6
aVWhat does this all mean for us?
p7
aVWhat it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.
p8
aVIt's going to become super exciting as we transform
p9
aVto this highly immersive and interactive world.
p10
aVWith graphics, computing power, low latencies,
p11
aVthese types of applications and possibilities
p12
aVare going to stream rich data into your lives.
p13
aVSo the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives,
p14
aVare all about extending our current search metaphor.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhen you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web,
p17
aVremembering URLs, saving favorites.
p18
aVAs we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings,
p19
aVthe Web matching, the index crawling.
p20
aVBut we want to use our brain!
p21
aVWe want to navigate, explore, discover information.
p22
aVIn order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.
p23
aVWe need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo what better way to put you back in the driver's seat
p26
aVthan to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?
p27
aVWhy not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?
p28
aVSo Virtual Earth is about starting off
p29
aVcreating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.
p30
aVWhat we want to do is mix in all types of data.
p31
aVTag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth,
p32
aVglobal perspective, local knowledge.
p33
aVSo when you think about this problem,
p34
aVwhat an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin?
p35
aVWell, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes,
p36
aVfrom ground vehicles, from people.
p37
aVThis process is an engineering problem,
p38
aVa mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.
p39
aa(lp40
VHere is an example of our aerial camera.
p41
aVThis is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones.
p42
aVIn addition, it's multi-spectral.
p43
aVWe collect four gigabits per second of data,
p44
aVif you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.
p45
aVThat's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.
p46
aVWe fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.
p47
aVYou can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints,
p48
aVvantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in.
p49
aa(lp50
VWe sit here \u2014 you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale \u2014
p51
aVwhat do you see in person? We need to capture that up close
p52
aVto establish that what it's like-type experience.
p53
aVI bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials,
p54
aVkind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity.
p55
aVSo a little unknown secret is \u2014
p56
aVdid you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?
p57
aVThe poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him.
p58
aVWell, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.
p59
aV(Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here.
p60
aVBut let me tell you \u2014 it doesn't affect his day job.
p61
aa(lp62
VWe think a lot of good can come from this technology.
p63
aVThis was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes
p64
aVto be cleared into the disaster impact zone.
p65
aVWe flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors,
p66
aVdisaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.
p67
aVOften the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth.
p68
aVWe made it all freely available on the Web, just to \u2014
p69
aVit was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.
p70
aa(lp71
VWhen we think about how all this comes together,
p72
aVit's all about software, algorithms and math.
p73
aVYou know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models
p74
aVwe need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images.
p75
aVWe have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points.
p76
aVExtract geometry from the images.
p77
aVThis process is a very calculated process.
p78
aVIn fact, it was always done manual.
p79
aVHollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor
p80
aVfor a movie because they'd have to do it manually.
p81
aVThey'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.
p82
aVThey'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building.
p83
aVWe do this all through software, algorithms and math \u2014
p84
aVa highly automated pipeline creating these cities.
p85
aVWe took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities,
p86
aVand that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream.
p87
aa(lp88
VWe think about the user interface.
p89
aVWhat does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?
p90
aVAn ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery
p91
aVwhile maintaining the fluidity of the model?
p92
aVI'll wrap up by showing you the \u2014
p93
aVthis is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth.
p94
aVWhat we're doing is \u2014 people like this a lot,
p95
aVthis bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data.
p96
aVBut what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model.
p97
aVA child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space.
p100
aVYou can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over.
p101
aVI can get the next image. I can blend and transition.
p102
aVBy doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history.
p103
aVThe freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image.
p104
aVI can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.
p105
aa(lp106
VWhat we're trying to do is build a virtual world.
p107
aVWe hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with,
p108
aVand really derive insights from you, from all different directions.
p109
aVI thank you very much for your time.

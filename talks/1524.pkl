VI worked on a film called "Apollo 13,"
p5
aVand when I worked on this film, I discovered something
p6
aVabout how our brains work, and how our brains work
p7
aVis that, when we're sort of infused with
p8
aVeither enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,
p9
aVit changes and alters our perception of things.
p10
aVIt changes what we see. It changes what we remember.
p11
aVAnd as an experiment, because I dauntingly create
p12
aVa task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch
p13
aVfor this particular movie, because I put it out there,
p14
aVI felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experiment
p15
aVand bring a group of people like this in a projection room
p16
aVand play this stock footage, and when I played this
p17
aVstock footage, I simply wanted to find out
p18
aVwhat people remembered, what was memorable about it?
p19
aVWhat should I actually try to replicate?
p20
aVWhat should I try to emulate to some degree?
p21
aa(lp22
VSo this is the footage that I was showing everybody.
p23
aVAnd what I discovered is, because of the nature
p24
aVof the footage and the fact that we're doing this film,
p25
aVthere was an emotion that was built into it
p26
aVand our collective memories of what this launch meant to us
p27
aVand all these various things.
p28
aVWhen I showed it, and I asked, immediately after
p29
aVthe screening was over, what they thought of it,
p30
aVwhat was your memorable shots, they changed them.
p31
aVThey were \u2014 had camera moves on them.
p32
aVThey had all kinds of things. Shots were combined,
p33
aVand I was just really curious, I mean, what the hell
p34
aVwere you looking at just a few minutes ago
p35
aVand how come, how'd you come up with this sort of description?
p36
aVAnd what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually
p37
aVreplicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo this is our footage of the launch, based on, basically,
p40
aVtaking notes, asking people what they thought, and then
p41
aVthe combination of all the different shots and all
p42
aVthe different things put together created their sort of
p43
aVcollective consciousness of what they remembered
p44
aVit looked like, but not what it really looked like.
p45
aVSo this is what we created for "Apollo 13."
p46
aa(lp47
V(Launch noises)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo literally what you're seeing now is the confluence
p50
aVof a bunch of different people, a bunch of different memories,
p51
aVincluding my own, of taking a little bit of liberty
p52
aVwith the subject matter.
p53
aVI basically shot everything with short lenses,
p54
aVwhich means that you're very close to the action,
p55
aVbut framed it very similarly to the long lens shots
p56
aVwhich gives you a sense of distance, so I was basically
p57
aVwas setting up something that would remind you
p58
aVof something you haven't really quite seen before. (Music)
p59
aVAnd then I'm going to show you exactly what it is
p60
aVthat you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Music)
p63
aa(lp64
VTom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.
p65
aVIt's good to see you again. (Cheers) (Music)
p66
aa(lp67
VRob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VSo now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can,
p72
aVand I'm basically recreating the launch with
p73
aVfire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw
p74
aVin front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically
p75
aVif you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you,
p76
aVwhat you were reacting to, what you're emoting to,
p77
aVis something that's a total falsehood, and I found that
p78
aVreally kind of fascinating.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie,
p81
aVand, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply
p82
aVtake a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.
p83
aVAnd that's simply what I did.
p84
aVThat's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator,
p85
aVso I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of,
p86
aVyou know, following the rocket all the way down,
p87
aVand giving that little sort of edge, I was desperately
p88
aVtrying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing.
p89
aVWe had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut,
p90
aVwho was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15,
p91
aVand he was there to basically double check my science.
p92
aVAnd, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VI don't know why, but they thought they did.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, and
p99
aVwe're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myself
p100
aVthe liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I did
p101
aVdidn't really suck that bad.
p102
aVAnd so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a little
p103
aVgood about it, so I brought him in here, and he needed
p104
aVto really check and see what we were doing,
p105
aVand basically give us our A plus report card,
p106
aVand so I showed him some shots we were working on,
p107
aVand waiting for the reaction that you hope for,
p108
aVwhich is what I got. (Music) (Launch noises)
p109
aVSo I showed him these two shots,
p110
aVand then he basically told me what he thought.
p111
aa(lp112
V("That's wrong") (Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VOkay. (Laughter)
p115
aVIt's what you dream about.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VSo what I got from him is, he turned to me and said,
p120
aV"You would never, ever design a rocket like that.
p121
aVYou would never have a rocket go up
p122
aVwhile the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine
p123
aVthe tragedy that could possibly happen with that?
p124
aVYou would never, ever design a rocket like that."
p125
aVAnd he was looking at me. It's like, Yeah, I don't know
p126
aVif you noticed, but I'm the guy out in the parking lot
p127
aVrecreating one of America's finest moments with
p128
aVfire extinguishers.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut,
p133
aVa hero, and I'm from New Jersey, so \u2014
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VI'm just going to show you some footage.
p138
aVI'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think.
p139
aVAnd then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo I showed him this, and this is actual footage
p142
aVthat he was on. This is Apollo 15. This was his mission.
p143
aVSo I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting.
p144
aa(lp145
V("That's wrong too.") (Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VSo, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intuned
p148
aVin that is that he remembered it differently.
p149
aVHe remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry
p150
aVsystem, perfectly safe rocket launch, because he's sitting
p151
aVin a rocket that has, like, a hundred thousand pounds
p152
aVof thrust, built by the lowest bidder.
p153
aVHe was hoping it was going to work out okay.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p156
aa(lp157
VSo he twisted his memory around.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not
p160
aVon the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking
p161
aVany of this footage, and he just responded
p162
aVas he would respond, and I'll run this.
p163
aa(lp164
VRon Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to me
p165
aVand said, "Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shots
p166
aVI'd never seen before. Did you guys, what vault did you find
p167
aVthat stuff in?" And I said, "Well, no vault, Buzz,
p168
aVwe generated all that from scratch."
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd he said, "Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?"
p171
aa(lp172
V(Explosion) ("Sure") (Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VRL: I think he's a great American.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo, "Titanic" was, if you don't know the story,
p179
aVdoesn't end well.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VJim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.
p184
aVSo he basically set up, or basically shattered
p185
aVthe suspension of disbelief, because what he photographed
p186
aVwas the real thing, a Mir sub going down, or actually
p187
aVtwo Mir subs going down to the real wreck,
p188
aVand he created this very haunting footage.
p189
aVIt's really beautiful, and it conjures up all these
p190
aVvarious different emotions, but he couldn't photograph
p191
aVeverything, and to tell the story,
p192
aVI had to fill in the gaps, which is now rather daunting,
p193
aVbecause now I have to recreate back to back
p194
aVwhat really happened and I had, I'm the only one
p195
aVwho could really blow it at that point.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo this is the footage he photographed,
p198
aVand it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring.
p199
aVSo I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb
p200
aVthis sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions
p201
aVwhen I was looking at it for the very first time.
p202
aVI got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically
p203
aVsee it come back to life.
p204
aVI automatically wanted to see this ship,
p205
aVthis magnificent ship, basically in all its glory,
p206
aVand conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory,
p207
aVbasically go back to what it looks like.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you
p210
aVwhat I tried to do, which is kind of the heart of the movie,
p211
aVfor me, and so that's why I wanted to do the movie,
p212
aVthat's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd I'll show you, you know, another thing that I found
p215
aVinteresting is what we really were emoting to
p216
aVwhen you take a look at it.
p217
aVSo here's the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.
p218
aVSo, when you saw my footage,
p219
aVyou were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guys
p220
aVflipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subs
p221
aVare actually about the size of small footballs,
p222
aVand shot in smoke.
p223
aVJim went three miles went down, and I went about
p224
aVthree miles away from the studio
p225
aVand photographed this in a garage.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd so, but what you're emoting to, or what you're looking
p228
aVat, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality,
p229
aVthat Jim's footage had, so I found it so fascinating
p230
aVthat our brains sort of, once you believe something's real,
p231
aVyou transfer everything that you feel about it,
p232
aVthis quality you have, and it's totally artificial.
p233
aVIt's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you,
p234
aVand I found that that was a very interesting thing
p235
aVto explore and use, and it caused me to create the next
p236
aVeffect that I'll show you, which is
p237
aVthis sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting
p238
aVto do is basically have the audience cue the effect,
p239
aVso it became a seamless experience for them,
p240
aVthat I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation,
p241
aVI was showing you what you wanted to see.
p242
aVAnd the very next shot, right after this \u2014
p243
aVSo you can see what I was doing.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo basically, if there's two subs in the same shot,
p246
aVI shot it, because where's the camera coming from?
p247
aVAnd when Jim shot it, it was only one sub,
p248
aVbecause he was photographing from the other,
p249
aVand I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this.
p250
aVI'll give it to Jim, because he could use the pat on the back.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VOkay. So now the Titanic transition.
p255
aVSo this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically
p256
aVmagically transplant from one state of the Titanic
p257
aVto the other. So I'll just play the shot once. (Music)
p258
aa(lp259
V(Music)
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.
p262
aa(lp263
VGloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.
p264
aa(lp265
VRL: So, what I did is basically I had another
p266
aVscreening room experience where I was basically tracking
p267
aVwhere I was looking, or where we were looking,
p268
aVand of course you're looking at the two people on the bow
p269
aVof the ship, and then at some point,
p270
aVI'm changing the periphery of the shot,
p271
aVI'm changing, it's becoming the rusted wreck,
p272
aVand then I would run it every day, and then I would find
p273
aVexactly the moment that I stopped looking at them
p274
aVand start noticing the rest of it, and the moment
p275
aVmy eye shifted, we just marked it to the frame.
p276
aVThe moment my eye shifted, I immediately started
p277
aVto change them, so now somehow you missed
p278
aVwhere it started and where it stopped.
p279
aVAnd so I'll just show it one more time.
p280
aV(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brains
p281
aVnaturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift
p282
aVyour attention, something changes, and then I left
p283
aVthe little scarf going, because it really wanted to be
p284
aVa ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were still
p285
aVon the wreck, essentially. That's where they were buried forever.
p286
aa(lp287
VOr something like that. I just made that up.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VIt was, incidentally, the last time I ever saw daylight.
p292
aVIt was a long film to work on. (Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, "Hugo" was another interesting movie, because
p295
aVthe movie itself is about film illusions.
p296
aVIt's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence
p297
aVof vision that creates a motion picture,
p298
aVand one of the things I had to do is, we \u2014
p299
aVSasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy,
p300
aVcomedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of
p301
aVthe Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted
p302
aVhis leg brace to get caught on a moving train.
p303
aVVery dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularly
p304
aVon our stage, because there literally is no way to actually
p305
aVmove this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo let me show you the scene, and then I basically
p308
aVused the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein,
p309
aVwhich is, if you have a camera that's moving with a moving
p310
aVobject, what is not moving appears to be moving,
p311
aVand what is moving appears to be stopped,
p312
aVso what you're actually seeing now is the train is not
p313
aVmoving at all, and what is actually moving is the floor.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo this is the shot. That's a little video of
p316
aVwhat you're looking at there, which is our little test,
p317
aVso that's actually what you're seeing, and I thought it was
p318
aVsort of an interesting thing, because it was, part
p319
aVof the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this
p320
aVsort of genius trick which I can't take credit for.
p321
aVI'd love to but I can't, because it was invented
p322
aVlike in 1910 or something like that, is I told Marty,
p323
aVand it's kind of one of those mind things that it's
p324
aVreally hard to really get until you actually see it work,
p325
aVand I said, you know, what I was going to do, and he said,
p326
aV"So, let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels?
p327
aVThat doesn't move."
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p330
aa(lp331
V"And the thing without the wheels, that moves."
p332
aa(lp333
VPrecisely. (Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VBrings me to the next, and final \u2014
p336
aa(lp337
VMarty's not going to see this, is he? (Laughter)
p338
aVThis isn't viewed outside of \u2014 (Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VThe next illustration is something that, there's like
p341
aVall one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story,
p342
aVespecially if you're following somebody on a journey,
p343
aVand that journey basically tells something about
p344
aVtheir personality in a very concise way,
p345
aVand what we wanted to do based on the shot in "Goodfellas,"
p346
aVwhich is one of the great shots ever,
p347
aVa Martin Scorsese film, of basically following Henry Hill
p348
aVthrough what it feels like to be a gangster walk
p349
aVgoing through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way.
p350
aVHe was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugo
p351
aVto feel the same way, so we created this shot.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Music)
p354
aVThat's Hugo. (Music)
p355
aVAnd we felt that if we could basically move the camera
p356
aVwith him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy
p357
aVwho is basically the master of his universe,
p358
aVand his universe is, you know, behind the scenes
p359
aVin the bowels of this particular train station
p360
aVthat only he can actually navigate through
p361
aVand do it this way, and we had to make it feel that
p362
aVthis is his normal, everyday sort of life,
p363
aVso the idea of doing it as one shot was very important,
p364
aVand of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically
p365
aVit's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick,
p366
aVso to recreate a steadycam shot was the task,
p367
aVand make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got
p368
aVwhen you saw the "Goodfellas" shot.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo what you're now going to see is how we actually did it.
p371
aVIt's actually five separate sets shot at five different times
p372
aVwith two different boys.
p373
aVThe one on the left is where the shot ends,
p374
aVand the shot on the right is where it takes over,
p375
aVand now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield,
p376
aVwho's the star of the show, to his stand-in. (Music)
p377
aVI wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig
p378
aVthat we built for this. (Music)
p379
aVAnd so this is, and now this is set number three
p380
aVwe're into, and then we're going to go into, basically
p381
aVthe very last moment of the shot is actually
p382
aVthe steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes
p383
aVand various things like that, and it literally was done
p384
aVover five different sets, two different boys, different times,
p385
aVand it all had to feel like it was all one shot, and what was
p386
aVsort of great for me was it was probably
p387
aVthe best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on,
p388
aVand, you know, I was kind of proud of it when I was done,
p389
aVwhich is, you should never really be proud of stuff, I guess.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine,
p392
aVand said, "You know, this is, you know, kind of
p393
aVthe best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on.
p394
aVWhat do you think was the reason?"
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd he said, "Because no one knows
p397
aVyou had anything to do with it."
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
VSo, all I can say is, thank you,
p402
aVand that's my presentation for you. (Applause)

VOur mission is to build
p5
aVa detailed, realistic
p6
aVcomputer model of the human brain.
p7
aVAnd we've done, in the past four years,
p8
aVa proof of concept
p9
aVon a small part of the rodent brain,
p10
aVand with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up
p11
aVto reach the human brain.
p12
aa(lp13
VWhy are we doing this?
p14
aVThere are three important reasons.
p15
aVThe first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain
p16
aVif we do want to get along in society,
p17
aVand I think that it is a key step in evolution.
p18
aVThe second reason is,
p19
aVwe cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever,
p20
aVand we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge
p21
aVinto a working model.
p22
aVIt's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive.
p23
aVAnd the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet
p24
aVthat are affected by mental disorder,
p25
aVand the drugs that are used today
p26
aVare largely empirical.
p27
aVI think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on
p28
aVhow to treat disorders.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, even at this stage,
p31
aVwe can use the brain model
p32
aVto explore some fundamental questions
p33
aVabout how the brain works.
p34
aVAnd here, at TED, for the first time,
p35
aVI'd like to share with you how we're addressing
p36
aVone theory \u2014 there are many theories \u2014
p37
aVone theory of how the brain works.
p38
aVSo, this theory is that the brain
p39
aVcreates, builds, a version of the universe,
p40
aVand projects this version of the universe,
p41
aVlike a bubble, all around us.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.
p44
aVBut, for the first time, we can actually address this,
p45
aVwith brain simulation,
p46
aVand ask very systematic and rigorous questions,
p47
aVwhether this theory could possibly be true.
p48
aVThe reason why the moon is huge on the horizon
p49
aVis simply because our perceptual bubble
p50
aVdoes not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.
p51
aVIt runs out of space.
p52
aVAnd so what we do is we compare the buildings
p53
aVwithin our perceptual bubble,
p54
aVand we make a decision.
p55
aVWe make a decision it's that big,
p56
aVeven though it's not that big.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd what that illustrates
p59
aVis that decisions are the key things
p60
aVthat support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.
p61
aVWithout decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,
p62
aVyou cannot feel.
p63
aVAnd you may think that anesthetics work
p64
aVby sending you into some deep sleep,
p65
aVor by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,
p66
aVbut in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.
p67
aVWhat they do is they introduce a noise
p68
aVinto the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.
p69
aVThey are confused,
p70
aVand you cannot make a decision.
p71
aVSo, while you're trying to make up your mind
p72
aVwhat the doctor, the surgeon, is doing
p73
aVwhile he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.
p74
aVHe's at home having tea.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VSo, when you walk up to a door and you open it,
p78
aVwhat you compulsively have to do to perceive
p79
aVis to make decisions,
p80
aVthousands of decisions about the size of the room,
p81
aVthe walls, the height, the objects in this room.
p82
aV99 percent of what you see
p83
aVis not what comes in through the eyes.
p84
aVIt is what you infer about that room.
p85
aVSo I can say, with some certainty,
p86
aV"I think, therefore I am."
p87
aVBut I cannot say, "You think, therefore you are,"
p88
aVbecause "you" are within my perceptual bubble.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, we can speculate and philosophize this,
p91
aVbut we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.
p92
aVWe can ask a very concrete question.
p93
aV"Can the brain build such a perception?"
p94
aVIs it capable of doing it?
p95
aVDoes it have the substance to do it?
p96
aVAnd that's what I'm going to describe to you today.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.
p99
aVIt had to improve it a little bit.
p100
aVIt had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,
p101
aVbecause they had to cope on land.
p102
aVBut the real big step was the neocortex.
p103
aVIt's a new brain. You needed it.
p104
aVThe mammals needed it
p105
aVbecause they had to cope with parenthood,
p106
aVsocial interactions,
p107
aVcomplex cognitive functions.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo, you can think of the neocortex
p110
aVactually as the ultimate solution today,
p111
aVof the universe as we know it.
p112
aVIt's the pinnacle, it's the final product
p113
aVthat the universe has produced.
p114
aVIt was so successful in evolution
p115
aVthat from mouse to man it expanded
p116
aVabout a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,
p117
aVto produce this almost frightening
p118
aVorgan, structure.
p119
aVAnd it has not stopped its evolutionary path.
p120
aVIn fact, the neocortex in the human brain
p121
aVis evolving at an enormous speed.
p122
aa(lp123
VIf you zoom into the surface of the neocortex,
p124
aVyou discover that it's made up of little modules,
p125
aVG5 processors, like in a computer.
p126
aVBut there are about a million of them.
p127
aVThey were so successful in evolution
p128
aVthat what we did was to duplicate them
p129
aVover and over and add more and more of them to the brain
p130
aVuntil we ran out of space in the skull.
p131
aVAnd the brain started to fold in on itself,
p132
aVand that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.
p133
aVWe're just packing in columns,
p134
aVso that we'd have more neocortical columns
p135
aVto perform more complex functions.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo you can think of the neocortex actually as
p138
aVa massive grand piano,
p139
aVa million-key grand piano.
p140
aVEach of these neocortical columns
p141
aVwould produce a note.
p142
aVYou stimulate it; it produces a symphony.
p143
aVBut it's not just a symphony of perception.
p144
aVIt's a symphony of your universe, your reality.
p145
aVNow, of course it takes years to learn how
p146
aVto master a grand piano with a million keys.
p147
aVThat's why you have to send your kids to good schools,
p148
aVhopefully eventually to Oxford.
p149
aVBut it's not only education.
p150
aVIt's also genetics.
p151
aVYou may be born lucky,
p152
aVwhere you know how to master your neocortical column,
p153
aVand you can play a fantastic symphony.
p154
aa(lp155
VIn fact, there is a new theory of autism
p156
aVcalled the "intense world" theory,
p157
aVwhich suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.
p158
aVThey are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,
p159
aVand so the autists are probably capable of
p160
aVbuilding and learning a symphony
p161
aVwhich is unthinkable for us.
p162
aVBut you can also understand
p163
aVthat if you have a disease
p164
aVwithin one of these columns,
p165
aVthe note is going to be off.
p166
aVThe perception, the symphony that you create
p167
aVis going to be corrupted,
p168
aVand you will have symptoms of disease.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo, the Holy Grail for neuroscience
p171
aVis really to understand the design of the neocoritical column \u2014
p172
aVand it's not just for neuroscience;
p173
aVit's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,
p174
aVand perhaps to even also understand physical reality.
p175
aVSo, what we did was, for the past 15 years,
p176
aVwas to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.
p177
aVIt's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.
p178
aVHow many trees does it have?
p179
aVWhat shapes are the trees?
p180
aVHow many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?
p181
aa(lp182
VBut it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to
p183
aVdescribe and discover all the rules of communication,
p184
aVthe rules of connectivity,
p185
aVbecause the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.
p186
aVThey choose very carefully who they connect with.
p187
aVIt's also more than cataloging
p188
aVbecause you actually have to build three-dimensional
p189
aVdigital models of them.
p190
aVAnd we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,
p191
aVbuilt digital models of all the different types
p192
aVof neurons we came across.
p193
aVAnd once you have that, you can actually
p194
aVbegin to build the neocortical column.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd here we're coiling them up.
p197
aVBut as you do this, what you see
p198
aVis that the branches intersect
p199
aVactually in millions of locations,
p200
aVand at each of these intersections
p201
aVthey can form a synapse.
p202
aVAnd a synapse is a chemical location
p203
aVwhere they communicate with each other.
p204
aVAnd these synapses together
p205
aVform the network
p206
aVor the circuit of the brain.
p207
aVNow, the circuit, you could also think of as
p208
aVthe fabric of the brain.
p209
aVAnd when you think of the fabric of the brain,
p210
aVthe structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?
p211
aVYou realize that this poses
p212
aVa fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,
p213
aVand especially to a theory that says
p214
aVthat there is some reality that emerges
p215
aVout of this carpet, out of this particular carpet
p216
aVwith a particular pattern.
p217
aa(lp218
VThe reason is because the most important design secret of the brain
p219
aVis diversity.
p220
aVEvery neuron is different.
p221
aVIt's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.
p222
aVYou may have many different types of trees,
p223
aVbut every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.
p224
aVSo there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,
p225
aVand there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.
p226
aVAnd your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned
p227
aVin exactly the same way.
p228
aVAnd you may have more or less neurons.
p229
aVSo it's very unlikely
p230
aVthat you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo, how could we possibly create a reality
p233
aVthat we can even understand each other?
p234
aVWell, we don't have to speculate.
p235
aVWe can look at all 10 million synapses now.
p236
aVWe can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.
p237
aVWe can use different neurons with different variations.
p238
aVWe can position them in different places,
p239
aVorient them in different places.
p240
aVWe can use less or more of them.
p241
aVAnd when we do that
p242
aVwhat we discovered is that the circuitry does change.
p243
aVBut the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.
p244
aVSo, the fabric of the brain,
p245
aVeven though your brain may be smaller, bigger,
p246
aVit may have different types of neurons,
p247
aVdifferent morphologies of neurons,
p248
aVwe actually do share
p249
aVthe same fabric.
p250
aVAnd we think this is species-specific,
p251
aVwhich means that that could explain
p252
aVwhy we can't communicate across species.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do
p255
aVis you have to make this come alive.
p256
aVWe make it come alive
p257
aVwith equations, a lot of mathematics.
p258
aVAnd, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators
p259
aVwere discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.
p260
aVSo, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.
p261
aVWe also have the mathematics to describe
p262
aVhow neurons collect information,
p263
aVand how they create a little lightning bolt
p264
aVto communicate with each other.
p265
aVAnd when they get to the synapse,
p266
aVwhat they do is they effectively,
p267
aVliterally, shock the synapse.
p268
aVIt's like electrical shock
p269
aVthat releases the chemicals from these synapses.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd we've got the mathematics to describe this process.
p272
aVSo we can describe the communication between the neurons.
p273
aVThere literally are only a handful
p274
aVof equations that you need to simulate
p275
aVthe activity of the neocortex.
p276
aVBut what you do need is a very big computer.
p277
aVAnd in fact you need one laptop
p278
aVto do all the calculations just for one neuron.
p279
aVSo you need 10,000 laptops.
p280
aVSo where do you go? You go to IBM,
p281
aVand you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take
p282
aV10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.
p283
aVSo now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.
p284
aVWe can load up all the neurons,
p285
aVeach one on to its processor,
p286
aVand fire it up, and see what happens.
p287
aVTake the magic carpet for a ride.
p288
aa(lp289
VHere we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse
p290
aVof what is happening in your brain
p291
aVwhen there is a stimulation.
p292
aVIt's the first view.
p293
aVNow, when you look at that the first time, you think,
p294
aV"My god. How is reality coming out of that?"
p295
aVBut, in fact, you can start,
p296
aVeven though we haven't trained this neocortical column
p297
aVto create a specific reality.
p298
aVBut we can ask, "Where is the rose?"
p299
aVWe can ask, "Where is it inside,
p300
aVif we stimulate it with a picture?"
p301
aVWhere is it inside the neocortex?
p302
aVUltimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo, the way that we can look at that
p305
aVis to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,
p306
aVand look just at the raw electrical activity.
p307
aVBecause that is what it's creating.
p308
aVIt's creating electrical patterns.
p309
aVSo when we did this,
p310
aVwe indeed, for the first time,
p311
aVsaw these ghost-like structures:
p312
aVelectrical objects appearing
p313
aVwithin the neocortical column.
p314
aVAnd it's these electrical objects
p315
aVthat are holding all the information about
p316
aVwhatever stimulated it.
p317
aVAnd then when we zoomed into this,
p318
aVit's like a veritable universe.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo the next step
p321
aVis just to take these brain coordinates
p322
aVand to project them into perceptual space.
p323
aVAnd if you do that,
p324
aVyou will be able to step inside
p325
aVthe reality that is created
p326
aVby this machine,
p327
aVby this piece of the brain.
p328
aVSo, in summary,
p329
aVI think that the universe may have \u2014
p330
aVit's possible \u2014
p331
aVevolved a brain to see itself,
p332
aVwhich may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.
p333
aVThere is a lot more to do to test these theories,
p334
aVand to test any other theories.
p335
aVBut I hope that you are at least partly convinced
p336
aVthat it is not impossible to build a brain.
p337
aVWe can do it within 10 years,
p338
aVand if we do succeed,
p339
aVwe will send to TED, in 10 years,
p340
aVa hologram to talk to you. Thank you.

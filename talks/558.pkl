VCollege presidents are not the first people who come to mind
p5
aVwhen the subject is the uses of the creative imagination.
p6
aVSo I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here.
p7
aa(lp8
VThe story begins in the late '90s.
p9
aVI was invited to meet with leading educators
p10
aVfrom the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.
p11
aVThey were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities.
p12
aVSince education under the Soviet Union
p13
aVwas essentially propaganda
p14
aVserving the purposes of a state ideology,
p15
aVthey appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations
p16
aVif they were to provide an education
p17
aVworthy of free men and women.
p18
aVGiven this rare opportunity
p19
aVto start fresh,
p20
aVthey chose liberal arts
p21
aVas the most compelling model
p22
aVbecause of its historic commitment
p23
aVto furthering its students' broadest intellectual,
p24
aVand deepest ethical potential.
p25
aa(lp26
VHaving made that decision
p27
aVthey came to the United States,
p28
aVhome of liberal arts education,
p29
aVto talk with some of us
p30
aVmost closely identified
p31
aVwith that kind of education.
p32
aVThey spoke with a passion, an urgency,
p33
aVan intellectual conviction
p34
aVthat, for me, was a voice I had not heard in decades,
p35
aVa dream long forgotten.
p36
aVFor, in truth, we had moved light years
p37
aVfrom the passions that animated them.
p38
aVBut for me, unlike them,
p39
aVin my world, the slate was not clean,
p40
aVand what was written on it was not encouraging.
p41
aa(lp42
VIn truth, liberal arts education
p43
aVno longer exists \u2014
p44
aVat least genuine liberal arts education \u2014 in this country.
p45
aVWe have professionalized liberal arts to the point
p46
aVwhere they no longer provide the breadth of application
p47
aVand the enhanced capacity for civic engagement
p48
aVthat is their signature.
p49
aVOver the past century
p50
aVthe expert has dethroned the educated generalist
p51
aVto become the sole model
p52
aVof intellectual accomplishment. (Applause)
p53
aa(lp54
VExpertise has for sure had its moments.
p55
aVBut the price of its dominance is enormous.
p56
aVSubject matters are broken up
p57
aVinto smaller and smaller pieces,
p58
aVwith increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure.
p59
aVWe have even managed to make the study of literature arcane.
p60
aVYou may think you know what is going on
p61
aVin that Jane Austen novel \u2014
p62
aVthat is, until your first encounter
p63
aVwith postmodern deconstructionism.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe progression of today's college student
p66
aVis to jettison every interest except one.
p67
aVAnd within that one, to continually narrow the focus,
p68
aVlearning more and more about less and less;
p69
aVthis, despite the evidence all around us
p70
aVof the interconnectedness of things.
p71
aVLest you think I exaggerate,
p72
aVhere are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology.
p73
aVAs one moves up the ladder,
p74
aVvalues other than technical competence
p75
aVare viewed with increasing suspicion.
p76
aVQuestions such as,
p77
aV"What kind of a world are we making?
p78
aVWhat kind of a world should we be making?
p79
aVWhat kind of a world can we be making?"
p80
aVare treated with more and more skepticism,
p81
aVand move off the table.
p82
aa(lp83
VIn so doing, the guardians of secular democracy
p84
aVin effect yield the connection
p85
aVbetween education and values
p86
aVto fundamentalists,
p87
aVwho, you can be sure,
p88
aVhave no compunctions about using education
p89
aVto further their values:
p90
aVthe absolutes of a theocracy.
p91
aVMeanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent.
p92
aVEither we have lost touch with those values
p93
aVor, no better,
p94
aVbelieve they need not
p95
aVor cannot be taught.
p96
aVThis aversion to social values
p97
aVmay seem at odds with the explosion
p98
aVof community service programs.
p99
aVBut despite the attention paid to these efforts,
p100
aVthey remain emphatically extracurricular.
p101
aVIn effect, civic-mindedness is treated
p102
aVas outside the realm of what purports to be
p103
aVserious thinking and adult purposes.
p104
aVSimply put, when the impulse is to change the world,
p105
aVthe academy is more likely to engender
p106
aVa learned helplessness
p107
aVthan to create a sense of empowerment.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis brew \u2014 oversimplification of civic engagement,
p110
aVidealization of the expert,
p111
aVfragmentation of knowledge,
p112
aVemphasis on technical mastery,
p113
aVneutrality as a condition of academic integrity \u2014
p114
aVis toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections
p115
aVbetween education and the public good,
p116
aVbetween intellectual integrity
p117
aVand human freedom,
p118
aVwhich were at the heart \u2014
p119
aV(Applause) \u2014 of the challenge posed to and by
p120
aVmy European colleagues.
p121
aVWhen the astronomical distance
p122
aVbetween the realities of the academy
p123
aVand the visionary intensity of this challenge
p124
aVwere more than enough, I can assure you,
p125
aVto give one pause,
p126
aVwhat was happening outside higher education
p127
aVmade backing off unthinkable.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhether it was threats to the environment,
p130
aVinequities in the distribution of wealth,
p131
aVlack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy
p132
aVwith respect to the continuing uses of energy,
p133
aVwe were in desperate straits.
p134
aVAnd that was only the beginning.
p135
aVThe corrupting of our political life
p136
aVhad become a living nightmare;
p137
aVnothing was exempt \u2014
p138
aVseparation of powers, civil liberties,
p139
aVthe rule of law,
p140
aVthe relationship of church and state.
p141
aVAccompanied by a squandering
p142
aVof the nation's material wealth
p143
aVthat defied credulity.
p144
aVA harrowing predilection for the uses of force
p145
aVhad become commonplace,
p146
aVwith an equal distaste
p147
aVfor the alternative forms of influence.
p148
aVAt the same time, all of our firepower was impotent
p149
aVwhen it came to halting or even stemming
p150
aVthe slaughter in Rwanda, Darfur, Myanmar.
p151
aa(lp152
VOur public education, once a model for the world,
p153
aVhas become most noteworthy
p154
aVfor its failures.
p155
aVMastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy
p156
aVeludes vast numbers of our students.
p157
aVDespite having a research establishment
p158
aVthat is the envy of the world,
p159
aVmore than half of the American public
p160
aVdon't believe in evolution.
p161
aVAnd don't press your luck
p162
aVabout how much those who do believe in it
p163
aVactually understand it.
p164
aa(lp165
VIncredibly, this nation,
p166
aVwith all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources,
p167
aVseems utterly helpless
p168
aVto reverse the freefall in any of these areas.
p169
aVEqually startling, from my point of view,
p170
aVis the fact that no one
p171
aVwas drawing any connections
p172
aVbetween what is happening to the body politic,
p173
aVand what is happening in our leading educational institutions.
p174
aVWe may be at the top of the list
p175
aVwhen it comes to influencing access to personal wealth.
p176
aVWe are not even on the list
p177
aVwhen it comes to our responsibility
p178
aVfor the health of this democracy.
p179
aVWe are playing with fire.
p180
aVYou can be sure Jefferson knew
p181
aVwhat he was talking about when he said,
p182
aV"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free
p183
aVin a state of civilization,
p184
aVit expects what never was,
p185
aVand never will be."
p186
aV(Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
VOn a more personal note,
p189
aVthis betrayal of our principles,
p190
aVour decency, our hope,
p191
aVmade it impossible for me
p192
aVto avoid the question,
p193
aV"What will I say, years from now,
p194
aVwhen people ask, 'Where were you?'"
p195
aVAs president of a leading liberal arts college,
p196
aVfamous for its innovative history,
p197
aVthere were no excuses.
p198
aVSo the conversation began at Bennington.
p199
aVKnowing that if we were to regain
p200
aVthe integrity of liberal education,
p201
aVit would take radical rethinking
p202
aVof basic assumptions,
p203
aVbeginning with our priorities.
p204
aVEnhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.
p205
aVThe accomplishment of civic virtue
p206
aVis tied to the uses of intellect and imagination
p207
aVat their most challenging.
p208
aa(lp209
VOur ways of approaching agency and authority
p210
aVturn inside out to reflect the reality
p211
aVthat no one has the answers
p212
aVto the challenges facing citizens in this century,
p213
aVand everyone has the responsibility
p214
aVfor trying and participating in finding them.
p215
aVBennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences
p216
aVas areas of immersion that acknowledge differences
p217
aVin personal and professional objectives.
p218
aVBut the balances redressed,
p219
aVour shared purposes assume an equal
p220
aVif not greater importance.
p221
aa(lp222
VWhen the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.
p223
aVThe idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves \u2014
p224
aVfrom health and education
p225
aVto the uses of force \u2014
p226
aVthe organizers of the curriculum.
p227
aVThey would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines.
p228
aVBut structures designed to connect, rather than divide
p229
aVmutually dependent circles,
p230
aVrather than isolating triangles.
p231
aVAnd the point is not to treat these topics
p232
aVas topics of study,
p233
aVbut as frameworks of action.
p234
aVThe challenge: to figure out what it will take
p235
aVto actually do something
p236
aVthat makes a significant and sustainable difference.
p237
aa(lp238
VContrary to widely held assumptions,
p239
aVan emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking.
p240
aVThe importance of coming to grips with values like justice,
p241
aVequity, truth,
p242
aVbecomes increasingly evident
p243
aVas students discover that interest alone
p244
aVcannot tell them what they need to know
p245
aVwhen the issue is rethinking education,
p246
aVour approach to health,
p247
aVor strategies for achieving
p248
aVan economics of equity.
p249
aVThe value of the past also comes alive;
p250
aVit provides a lot of company.
p251
aVYou are not the first to try to figure this out,
p252
aVjust as you are unlikely to be the last.
p253
aVEven more valuable,
p254
aVhistory provides a laboratory
p255
aVin which we see played out
p256
aVthe actual, as well as the intended
p257
aVconsequences of ideas.
p258
aa(lp259
VIn the language of my students,
p260
aV"Deep thought matters
p261
aVwhen you're contemplating what to do
p262
aVabout things that matter."
p263
aVA new liberal arts that can support this
p264
aVaction-oriented curriculum
p265
aVhas begun to emerge.
p266
aVRhetoric, the art of organizing the world of words
p267
aVto maximum effect.
p268
aVDesign, the art of organizing the world of things.
p269
aVMediation and improvisation
p270
aValso assume a special place in this new pantheon.
p271
aVQuantitative reasoning attains its proper position
p272
aVat the heart of what it takes to manage change
p273
aVwhere measurement is crucial.
p274
aVAs is a capacity to discriminate
p275
aVsystematically between what is at the core
p276
aVand what is at the periphery.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd when making connections is of the essence,
p279
aVthe power of technology emerges with special intensity.
p280
aVBut so does the importance of content.
p281
aVThe more powerful our reach,
p282
aVthe more important the question "About what?"
p283
aVWhen improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key,
p284
aVartists, at long last,
p285
aVtake their place at the table,
p286
aVwhen strategies of action are in the process of being designed.
p287
aVIn this dramatically expanded ideal
p288
aVof a liberal arts education
p289
aVwhere the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood,
p290
aVknowledge honed outside the academy
p291
aVbecomes essential.
p292
aVSocial activists, business leaders,
p293
aVlawyers, politicians, professionals
p294
aVwill join the faculty as active and ongoing participants
p295
aVin this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.
p296
aVStudents, in turn, continuously move outside the classroom
p297
aVto engage the world directly.
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd of course, this new wine
p300
aVneeds new bottles
p301
aVif we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism
p302
aVof this idea.
p303
aVThe most important discovery we made
p304
aVin our focus on public action
p305
aVwas to appreciate that the hard choices
p306
aVare not between good and evil,
p307
aVbut between competing goods.
p308
aVThis discovery is transforming.
p309
aVIt undercuts self-righteousness,
p310
aVradically alters the tone and character of controversy,
p311
aVand enriches dramatically
p312
aVthe possibilities for finding common ground.
p313
aVIdeology, zealotry,
p314
aVunsubstantiated opinions simply won't do.
p315
aVThis is a political education, to be sure.
p316
aVBut it is a politics of principle,
p317
aVnot of partisanship.
p318
aVSo the challenge for Bennington is to do it.
p319
aa(lp320
VOn the cover of Bennington's 2008 holiday card
p321
aVis the architect's sketch of a building
p322
aVopening in 2010
p323
aVthat is to be a center for the advancement
p324
aVof public action.
p325
aVThe center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.
p326
aVThink of it as a kind of secular church.
p327
aVThe words on the card describe what will happen inside.
p328
aVWe intend to turn the intellectual
p329
aVand imaginative power, passion and boldness
p330
aVof our students, faculty and staff
p331
aVto developing strategies
p332
aVfor acting on the critical challenges of our time.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo we are doing our job.
p335
aVWhile these past weeks have been a time
p336
aVof national exhilaration in this country,
p337
aVit would be tragic if you thought this meant
p338
aVyour job was done.
p339
aVThe glacial silence we have experienced
p340
aVin the face of the shredding of the constitution,
p341
aVthe unraveling of our public institutions,
p342
aVthe deterioration of our infrastructure
p343
aVis not limited to the universities.
p344
aVWe the people
p345
aVhave become inured to our own irrelevance
p346
aVwhen it comes to doing anything significant
p347
aVabout anything that matters
p348
aVconcerning governance,
p349
aVbeyond waiting another four years.
p350
aVWe persist also
p351
aVin being sidelined by the idea of the expert
p352
aVas the only one capable of coming up with answers,
p353
aVdespite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
p354
aa(lp355
VThe problem is there is no such thing
p356
aVas a viable democracy made up of experts,
p357
aVzealots, politicians and spectators.
p358
aV(Applause)
p359
aVPeople will continue and should continue
p360
aVto learn everything there is to know about something or other.
p361
aVWe actually do it all the time.
p362
aVAnd there will be and should be
p363
aVthose who spend a lifetime
p364
aVpursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry.
p365
aVBut this single-mindedness will not yield
p366
aVthe flexibilities of mind,
p367
aVthe multiplicity of perspectives,
p368
aVthe capacities for collaboration and innovation
p369
aVthis country needs.
p370
aVThat is where you come in.
p371
aVWhat is certain is that the individual talent
p372
aVexhibited in such abundance here,
p373
aVneeds to turn its attention
p374
aVto that collaborative, messy, frustrating,
p375
aVcontentious and impossible world
p376
aVof politics and public policy.
p377
aVPresident Obama and his team
p378
aVsimply cannot do it alone.
p379
aa(lp380
VIf the question of where to start seems overwhelming
p381
aVyou are at the beginning, not the end of this adventure.
p382
aVBeing overwhelmed is the first step
p383
aVif you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter,
p384
aVon a scale that makes a difference.
p385
aVSo what do you do when you feel overwhelmed?
p386
aVWell, you have two things.
p387
aVYou have a mind. And you have other people.
p388
aVStart with those, and change the world.

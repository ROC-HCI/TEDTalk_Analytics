VSo I was privileged to train in transplantation
p5
aVunder two great surgical pioneers:
p6
aVThomas Starzl,
p7
aVwho performed the world's first successful liver transplant
p8
aVin 1967,
p9
aVand Sir Roy Calne,
p10
aVwho performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.
p11
aVin the following year.
p12
aVI returned to Singapore
p13
aVand, in 1990,
p14
aVperformed Asia's first successful
p15
aVcadaveric liver transplant procedure,
p16
aVbut against all odds.
p17
aVNow when I look back,
p18
aVthe transplant was actually the easiest part.
p19
aVNext, raising the money to fund the procedure.
p20
aVBut perhaps the most challenging part
p21
aVwas to convince the regulators \u2014
p22
aVa matter which was debated in the parliament \u2014
p23
aVthat a young female surgeon
p24
aVbe allowed the opportunity
p25
aVto pioneer for her country.
p26
aVBut 20 years on,
p27
aVmy patient, Surinder,
p28
aVis Asia's longest surviving
p29
aVcadaveric liver transplant to date.
p30
aV(Applause)
p31
aVAnd perhaps more important,
p32
aVI am the proud godmother
p33
aVto her 14 year-old son.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Applause)
p36
aa(lp37
VBut not all patients on the transplant wait list
p38
aVare so fortunate.
p39
aVThe truth is,
p40
aVthere are just simply not enough donor organs
p41
aVto go around.
p42
aVAs the demand for donor organs
p43
aVcontinues to rise,
p44
aVin large part due to the aging population,
p45
aVthe supply has remained relatively constant.
p46
aVIn the United States alone,
p47
aV100,000 men, women and children
p48
aVare on the waiting list for donor organs,
p49
aVand more than a dozen die each day
p50
aVbecause of a lack of donor organs.
p51
aVThe transplant community
p52
aVhas actively campaigned in organ donation.
p53
aVAnd the gift of life
p54
aVhas been extended
p55
aVfrom brain-dead donors
p56
aVto living, related donors \u2014
p57
aVrelatives who might donate an organ
p58
aVor a part of an organ,
p59
aVlike a split liver graft,
p60
aVto a relative or loved one.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs,
p63
aVthe gift of life was then extended
p64
aVfrom living, related donors
p65
aVto now living, unrelated donors.
p66
aVAnd this then has given rise
p67
aVto unprecedented and unexpected
p68
aVmoral controversy.
p69
aVHow can one distinguish
p70
aVa donation that is voluntary and altruistic
p71
aVfrom one that is forced or coerced
p72
aVfrom, for example,
p73
aVa submissive spouse, an in-law,
p74
aVa servant, a slave,
p75
aVan employee?
p76
aVWhere and how can we draw the line?
p77
aVIn my part of the world,
p78
aVtoo many people live below the poverty line.
p79
aVAnd in some areas,
p80
aVthe commercial gifting of an organ
p81
aVin exchange for monetary reward
p82
aVhas led to a flourishing trade
p83
aVin living, unrelated donors.
p84
aa(lp85
VShortly after I performed the first liver transplant,
p86
aVI received my next assignment,
p87
aVand that was to go to the prisons
p88
aVto harvest organs
p89
aVfrom executed prisoners.
p90
aVI was also pregnant at the time.
p91
aVPregnancies are meant
p92
aVto be happy and fulfilling moments
p93
aVin any woman's life.
p94
aVBut my joyful period
p95
aVwas marred by solemn and morbid thoughts \u2014
p96
aVthoughts of walking through
p97
aVthe prison's high-security death row,
p98
aVas this was the only route
p99
aVto take me to the makeshift operating room.
p100
aVAnd at each time,
p101
aVI would feel the chilling stares
p102
aVof condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.
p103
aVAnd for two years,
p104
aVI struggled with the dilemma
p105
aVof waking up at 4:30 am
p106
aVon a Friday morning,
p107
aVdriving to the prison,
p108
aVgetting down, gloved and scrubbed,
p109
aVready to receive the body
p110
aVof an executed prisoner,
p111
aVremove the organs
p112
aVand then transport these organs
p113
aVto the recipient hospital
p114
aVand then graft the gift of life
p115
aVto a recipient the same afternoon.
p116
aVNo doubt, I was informed,
p117
aVthe consent had been obtained.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut, in my life,
p120
aVthe one fulfilling skill that I had
p121
aVwas now invoking feelings of conflict \u2014
p122
aVconflict ranging
p123
aVfrom extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn
p124
aVto celebratory joy
p125
aVat engrafting the gift of life at dusk.
p126
aVIn my team,
p127
aVthe lives of one or two of my colleagues
p128
aVwere tainted by this experience.
p129
aVSome of us may have been sublimated,
p130
aVbut really none of us remained the same.
p131
aVI was troubled
p132
aVthat the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners
p133
aVwas at least as morally controversial
p134
aVas the harvesting of stem cells
p135
aVfrom human embryos.
p136
aVAnd in my mind,
p137
aVI realized as a surgical pioneer
p138
aVthat the purpose of my position of influence
p139
aVwas surely to speak up
p140
aVfor those who have no influence.
p141
aVIt made me wonder
p142
aVif there could be a better way \u2014
p143
aVa way to circumvent death
p144
aVand yet deliver the gift of life
p145
aVthat might exponentially impact
p146
aVmillions of patients worldwide.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow just about that time,
p149
aVthe practice of surgery evolved
p150
aVfrom big to small,
p151
aVfrom wide open incisions
p152
aVto keyhole procedures,
p153
aVtiny incisions.
p154
aVAnd in transplantation, concepts shifted
p155
aVfrom whole organs to cells.
p156
aVIn 1988, at the University of Minnesota,
p157
aVI participated in a small series
p158
aVof whole organ pancreas transplants.
p159
aVI witnessed the technical difficulty.
p160
aVAnd this inspired in my mind
p161
aVa shift from transplanting whole organs
p162
aVto perhaps transplanting cells.
p163
aVI thought to myself,
p164
aVwhy not take the individual cells
p165
aVout of the pancreas \u2014
p166
aVthe cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes \u2014
p167
aVand transplant these cells? \u2014
p168
aVtechnically a much simpler procedure
p169
aVthan having to grapple with the complexities
p170
aVof transplanting a whole organ.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd at that time,
p173
aVstem cell research
p174
aVhad gained momentum,
p175
aVfollowing the isolation of the world's first
p176
aVhuman embryonic stem cells
p177
aVin the 1990s.
p178
aVThe observation that stem cells, as master cells,
p179
aVcould give rise
p180
aVto a whole variety of different cell types \u2014
p181
aVheart cells, liver cells,
p182
aVpancreatic islet cells \u2014
p183
aVcaptured the attention of the media
p184
aVand the imagination of the public.
p185
aVI too was fascinated
p186
aVby this new and disruptive cell technology,
p187
aVand this inspired a shift in my mindset,
p188
aVfrom transplanting whole organs
p189
aVto transplanting cells.
p190
aVAnd I focused my research on stem cells
p191
aVas a possible source
p192
aVfor cell transplants.
p193
aa(lp194
VToday we realize
p195
aVthat there are many different types of stem cells.
p196
aVEmbryonic stem cells
p197
aVhave occupied center stage,
p198
aVchiefly because of their pluripotency \u2014
p199
aVthat is their ease in differentiating
p200
aVinto a variety of different cell types.
p201
aVBut the moral controversy
p202
aVsurrounding embryonic stem cells \u2014
p203
aVthe fact that these cells are derived
p204
aVfrom five-day old human embryos \u2014
p205
aVhas encouraged research
p206
aVinto other types of stem cells.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow to the ridicule of my colleagues,
p209
aVI inspired my lab
p210
aVto focus on what I thought
p211
aVwas the most non-controversial source of stem cells,
p212
aVadipose tissue, or fat, yes fat \u2014
p213
aVnowadays available in abundant supply \u2014
p214
aVyou and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.
p215
aVFat-derived stem cells
p216
aVare adult stem cells.
p217
aVAnd adult stem cells
p218
aVare found in you and me \u2014
p219
aVin our blood, in our bone marrow,
p220
aVin our fat, our skin and other organs.
p221
aVAnd as it turns out,
p222
aVfat is one of the best sources
p223
aVof adult stem cells.
p224
aVBut adult stem cells
p225
aVare not embryonic stem cells.
p226
aVAnd here is the limitation:
p227
aVadult stem cells are mature cells,
p228
aVand, like mature human beings,
p229
aVthese cells are more restricted in their thought
p230
aVand more restricted in their behavior
p231
aVand are unable to give rise
p232
aVto the wide variety of specialized cell types,
p233
aVas embryonic stem cells [can].
p234
aa(lp235
VBut in 2007,
p236
aVtwo remarkable individuals,
p237
aVShinya Yamanaka of Japan
p238
aVand Jamie Thomson of the United States,
p239
aVmade an astounding discovery.
p240
aVThey discovered
p241
aVthat adult cells, taken from you and me,
p242
aVcould be reprogrammed
p243
aVback into embryonic-like cells,
p244
aVwhich they termed IPS cells,
p245
aVor induced pluripotent stem cells.
p246
aVAnd so guess what,
p247
aVscientists around the world and in the labs
p248
aVare racing
p249
aVto convert aging adult cells \u2014
p250
aVaging adult cells from you and me \u2014
p251
aVthey are racing to reprogram these cells
p252
aVback into more useful IPS cells.
p253
aVAnd in our lab,
p254
aVwe are focused on taking fat
p255
aVand reprogramming
p256
aVmounds of fat
p257
aVinto fountains of youthful cells \u2014
p258
aVcells that we may use
p259
aVto then form other,
p260
aVmore specialized, cells,
p261
aVwhich one day may be used as cell transplants.
p262
aVIf this research is successful,
p263
aVit may then reduce the need
p264
aVto research and sacrifice
p265
aVhuman embryos.
p266
aa(lp267
VIndeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope
p268
aVthat the promise of stem cells
p269
aVwill one day provide cures
p270
aVfor a whole range of conditions.
p271
aVHeart disease, stroke, diabetes,
p272
aVspinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy,
p273
aVretinal eye diseases \u2014
p274
aVare any of these conditions
p275
aVrelevant, personally, to you?
p276
aa(lp277
VIn May 2006,
p278
aVsomething horrible happened to me.
p279
aVI was about to start a robotic operation,
p280
aVbut stepping out of the elevator
p281
aVinto the bright and glaring lights of the operating room,
p282
aVI realized
p283
aVthat my left visual field
p284
aVwas fast collapsing into darkness.
p285
aVEarlier that week,
p286
aVI had taken a rather hard knock
p287
aVduring late spring skiing \u2014 yes, I fell.
p288
aVAnd I started to see floaters and stars,
p289
aVwhich I casually dismissed
p290
aVas too much high-altitude sun exposure.
p291
aVWhat happened to me
p292
aVmight have been catastrophic,
p293
aVif not for the fact
p294
aVthat I was in reach of good surgical access.
p295
aVAnd I had my vision restored,
p296
aVbut not before a prolonged period of convalescence \u2014
p297
aVthree months \u2014
p298
aVin a head down position.
p299
aVThis experience
p300
aVtaught me to empathize more with my patients,
p301
aVand especially those with retinal diseases.
p302
aa(lp303
V37 million people worldwide
p304
aVare blind,
p305
aVand 127 million more
p306
aVsuffer from impaired vision.
p307
aVStem cell-derived retinal transplants,
p308
aVnow in a research phase,
p309
aVmay one day restore vision,
p310
aVor part vision,
p311
aVto millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.
p312
aVIndeed, we live
p313
aVin both challenging
p314
aVas well as exciting times.
p315
aVAs the world population ages,
p316
aVscientists are racing
p317
aVto discover new ways
p318
aVto enhance the power of the body
p319
aVto heal itself through stem cells.
p320
aa(lp321
VIt is a fact
p322
aVthat when our organs or tissues are injured,
p323
aVour bone marrow
p324
aVreleases stem cells
p325
aVinto our circulation.
p326
aVAnd these stem cells
p327
aVthen float in the bloodstream
p328
aVand hone in to damaged organs
p329
aVto release growth factors
p330
aVto repair the damaged tissue.
p331
aVStem cells may be used as building blocks
p332
aVto repair damaged scaffolds within our body,
p333
aVor to provide new liver cells
p334
aVto repair damaged liver.
p335
aVAs we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials
p336
aVresearching the use of stem cells
p337
aVfor liver diseases.
p338
aa(lp339
VWhat lies ahead?
p340
aVHeart disease
p341
aVis the leading cause of death worldwide.
p342
aV1.1 million Americans
p343
aVsuffer heart attacks yearly.
p344
aV4.8 million
p345
aVsuffer cardiac failure.
p346
aVStem cells may be used
p347
aVto deliver growth factors
p348
aVto repair damaged heart muscle
p349
aVor be differentiated
p350
aVinto heart muscle cells
p351
aVto restore heart function.
p352
aVThere are 170 clinical trials
p353
aVinvestigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.
p354
aVWhile still in a research phase,
p355
aVstem cells may one day herald
p356
aVa quantum leap in the field of cardiology.
p357
aa(lp358
VStem cells provide hope for new beginnings \u2014
p359
aVsmall, incremental steps,
p360
aVcells rather than organs,
p361
aVrepair rather than replacement.
p362
aVStem cell therapies
p363
aVmay one day reduce the need for donor organs.
p364
aVPowerful new technologies
p365
aValways present enigmas.
p366
aVAs we speak,
p367
aVthe world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury
p368
aVis currently underway
p369
aVfollowing the USFDA approval.
p370
aVAnd in the U.K.,
p371
aVneural stem cells to treat stroke
p372
aVare being investigated in a phase one trial.
p373
aa(lp374
VThe research success that we celebrate today
p375
aVhas been made possible
p376
aVby the curiosity and contribution and commitment
p377
aVof individual scientists
p378
aVand medical pioneers.
p379
aVEach one has his story.
p380
aVMy story has been about my journey
p381
aVfrom organs to cells \u2014
p382
aVa journey through controversy,
p383
aVinspired by hope \u2014
p384
aVhope that, as we age,
p385
aVyou and I may one day celebrate longevity
p386
aVwith an improved quality of life.
p387
aa(lp388

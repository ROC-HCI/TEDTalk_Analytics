VI'm delighted to be here.
p5
aVI'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.
p6
aVI would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,
p7
aVbut unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in
p8
aVwon't interest many other people.
p9
aVFirst off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.
p10
aVI would love to talk about my astronomy,
p11
aVbut I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer
p12
aVin non-gray atmospheres
p13
aVand polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere
p14
aVare the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.
p15
aVSo I'm not going to talk about that.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VIt would be just as much fun
p19
aVto talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987,
p20
aVwhen a computer hacker is breaking into our systems
p21
aVover at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.
p22
aVAnd I caught the guys,
p23
aVand they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB,
p24
aVand stealing information and selling it.
p25
aVAnd I'd love to talk about that \u2014 and it'd be fun \u2014
p26
aVbut, 20 years later ...
p27
aVI find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.
p28
aVIt's tedious.
p29
aVI'm \u2014
p30
aa(lp31
VThe first time you do something, it's science.
p32
aVThe second time, it's engineering.
p33
aVA third time, it's just being a technician.
p34
aVI'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.
p35
aVSo, I'm not going to talk about that.
p36
aVNor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book,
p37
aV"Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book,
p38
aVnor am I going to talk about
p39
aVwhy I believe computers don't belong in schools.
p40
aa(lp41
VI feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around
p42
aVthat we have to bring more computers into schools.
p43
aVMy idea is: no! No!
p44
aVGet them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.
p45
aVAnd I'd love to talk about this,
p46
aVbut I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom
p47
aVthat it doesn't need much talking about \u2014
p48
aVbut I guess I may be very wrong about that,
p49
aVand everything else that I've said.
p50
aVSo don't go back and read my dissertation.
p51
aVIt probably has lies in it as well.
p52
aa(lp53
VHaving said that, I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVAnd if you look at it over here,
p56
aVthe main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.
p57
aVI'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?
p58
aVOh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre,
p59
aVbecause I've got gray hair,
p60
aVand so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.
p61
aVIn fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be,
p62
aVif you really want to know about the future,
p63
aVdon't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.
p64
aVNo! Don't ask somebody who's writing code.
p65
aa(lp66
VNo, if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years,
p67
aVask a kindergarten teacher.
p68
aVThey know.
p69
aVIn fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher,
p70
aVask an experienced one.
p71
aVThey're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.
p72
aVI don't. Nor, I suspect,
p73
aVdo many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.
p74
aVCertainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things
p75
aVthat are going to be there.
p76
aVBut to me, things aren't the future.
p77
aVWhat I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like,
p78
aVwhen the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging
p79
aVand spend a huge amount of on-screen time,
p80
aVbut have never gone bowling together?
p81
aa(lp82
VChange is happening, and the change that is happening
p83
aVis not one that is in software.
p84
aVBut that's not what I'm going to talk about.
p85
aVI'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun,
p86
aVbut I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?
p87
aVOh \u2014 the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about
p88
aVis right over here. Right over here.
p89
aVIs that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things.
p90
aVI would dearly love to talk about
p91
aVthings that have one side.
p92
aVBecause I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops,
p93
aVbut I'm one of the very few people,
p94
aVif not the only person in the world, that makes Klein bottles.
p95
aVRight away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.
p96
aVThis is a Klein bottle.
p97
aVFor those of you in the audience who know,
p98
aVyou roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.
p99
aVIt's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.
p100
aVIt has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.
p101
aVIt has wonderful properties.
p102
aVIf you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together,
p103
aVyou get one of these, and I make them out of glass.
p104
aVAnd I'd love to talk to you about this,
p105
aVbut I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because \u2014
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
V(Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.)
p109
aa(lp110
VHowever, the "D" in TED of course stands for design.
p111
aVJust two weeks ago I made \u2014
p112
aVyou know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.
p113
aVBut what I've just made \u2014
p114
aVand I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.
p115
aVThis is a Klein bottle wine bottle,
p116
aVwhich, although in four dimensions
p117
aVit shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all,
p118
aVit's perfectly capable of doing so
p119
aVbecause our universe has only three spatial dimensions.
p120
aVAnd because our universe is only three spatial dimensions,
p121
aVit can hold fluids.
p122
aVSo it's highly \u2014 that one's the cool one.
p123
aVThat was a month of my life.
p124
aVBut although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VInstead, I'm going to mention my mom,
p128
aVwho passed away last summer.
p129
aVHad collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.
p130
aVCould somebody put this guy up?
p131
aVAnd I looked over her album
p132
aVand she had collected a picture of me, standing \u2014
p133
aVwell, sitting \u2014 in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials.
p134
aVAnd I looked at it, and said, oh my god,
p135
aVthat was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!
p136
aVAs a technician, repairing and maintaining
p137
aVthe electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!
p138
aVWay back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!
p139
aVAnd it sent me back.
p140
aa(lp141
VSoon after that, I found in another picture that she had, a picture of me.
p142
aVThis guy over here of course is me.
p143
aVThis man is Robert Moog,
p144
aVthe inventor of the Moog synthesizer,
p145
aVwho passed away this past August.
p146
aVRobert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.
p147
aVA musician who took time from his life to teach me,
p148
aVa sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.
p149
aVHe'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me
p150
aVnot just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there \u2014
p151
aVI'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.
p152
aVWe're studying physics, I'm studying physics,
p153
aVand he's saying, "That's a good thing to do.
p154
aVDon't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics."
p155
aVMentoring me. He'd come up and
p156
aVspend hours and hours with me.
p157
aVHe wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.
p158
aVIn the background, my bicycle.
p159
aVI realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.
p160
aVBob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment
p161
aVto show Greg Flint and I things about this.
p162
aVWe sat around talking about Fourier transforms,
p163
aVBessel functions, modulation transfer functions,
p164
aVstuff like this.
p165
aVBob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.
p166
aVAnyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.
p167
aV(Applause)
p168
aVAnd I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do \u2014
p169
aVI hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave,
p170
aValmost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope.
p171
aa(lp172
VOh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?
p173
aVKids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about \u2014 is that okay?
p174
aVIt says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.
p175
aVI've decided that, for me at least,
p176
aVI don't have a big enough head.
p177
aVSo I think locally and I act locally.
p178
aVI feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.
p179
aVSo Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.
p180
aVI was talking about this stuff to
p181
aVsome schoolteachers about a year ago.
p182
aVAnd one of them, several of them would come up to me and say,
p183
aV"Well, how come you ain't teaching?"
p184
aVAnd I said, "Well, I've taught graduate \u2014
p185
aVI've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes."
p186
aVNo, they said, "If you're so into kids and all this stuff,
p187
aVhow come you ain't over here on the front lines?
p188
aVPut your money where you mouth is."
p189
aa(lp190
VIs true. Is true. I teach eighth-grade science four days a week.
p191
aVNot just showing up every now and then.
p192
aVNo, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.
p193
aVI take lunch hour. (Applause)
p194
aVThis is not \u2014 no, no, no, this is not claps.
p195
aVI strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.
p196
aVNot just show up to class every now and then.
p197
aVTeach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough.
p198
aVOne of the things that I've done for my science students
p199
aVis to tell them, "Look, I'm going to teach you college-level physics.
p200
aVNo calculus, I'll cut out that.
p201
aVYou won't need to know trig.
p202
aVBut you will need to know eighth-grade algebra,
p203
aVand we're going to do serious experiments.
p204
aVNone of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets.
p205
aVWe're going to be doing genuine physics."
p206
aVAnd that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.
p207
aV(High-pitched tone)
p208
aa(lp209
VOh, before I even turn that on,
p210
aVone of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class \u2014
p211
aVthis is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for
p212
aVwas to measure the speed of light.
p213
aVMy students in El Cerrito \u2014 with my help, of course,
p214
aVand with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope \u2014
p215
aVmeasured the speed of light.
p216
aVWe were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of
p217
aVwho have measured the speed of light?
p218
aVIn addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.
p219
aVI'd love to measure the speed of light here.
p220
aVI was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man,"
p221
aVI was just going to impose upon the powers that be,
p222
aVand measure the speed of light.
p223
aVAnd I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it,
p224
aVbut then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!
p225
aVAnd there's no time to do it.
p226
aVSo, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light!
p227
aa(lp228
VBut meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!
p229
aVWell, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound
p230
aVis to bounce sound off something and look at the echo.
p231
aVBut, probably \u2014 one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said,
p232
aV"Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?"
p233
aVAnd all of you know the wave equation is
p234
aVthe frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
p235
aVis a constant. When the frequency goes up,
p236
aVthe wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up,
p237
aVfrequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here \u2014
p238
aVover here, that's what's interesting \u2014
p239
aVas the pitch goes up, things get closer,
p240
aVpitch goes down, things stretch out.
p241
aVRight? This is simple physics.
p242
aVAll of you know this from eighth grade, remember?
p243
aVWhat they didn't tell you in physics \u2014 in eighth-grade physics \u2014
p244
aVbut they should have, and I wish they had,
p245
aVwas that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound
p246
aVor light, you get a constant.
p247
aVAnd that constant is the speed of sound.
p248
aVSo, in order to measure the speed of sound,
p249
aVall I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.
p250
aVI've got a frequency counter right here.
p251
aVSet it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.
p252
aVNow, so I know the frequency.
p253
aVIt's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.
p254
aVAll I need now is to flip on another beam,
p255
aVand the bottom beam is me talking, right?
p256
aVSo anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.
p257
aVI'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source,
p258
aVyou'll notice the spiral.
p259
aVThe slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave,
p260
aVcoming out this way.
p261
aVThose of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes,
p262
aVbut bear with me. (Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VTo measure the wavelength,
p265
aVall I need to do is measure the distance from here \u2014
p266
aVone full wave \u2014 over to here.
p267
aVFrom here to here is the wavelength of sound.
p268
aVSo, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.
p269
aVI've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.
p270
aV0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.
p271
aVOK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.
p272
aVAnd we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.
p273
aVThe wavelength was 0.2 meters.
p274
aVLet's figure out what this is.
p275
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p276
aV1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.
p277
aVIf you look it up in the book, it's really 343.
p278
aVBut, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink \u2014
p279
aVwe've been able to measure the speed of sound to \u2014
p280
aVnot bad. Pretty good.
p281
aa(lp282
VAll of which comes to what I wanted to say.
p283
aVGo back to this picture of me a million years ago.
p284
aVIt was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on,
p285
aVand I'm like, "Oh my God!"
p286
aVI'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.
p287
aVI'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.
p288
aVThere's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.
p289
aVThere's a riot going on on campus,
p290
aVand the police are chasing me, right?
p291
aVI'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says,
p292
aV"You! You're a student."
p293
aVPulls out a gun. Goes boom!
p294
aVAnd a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!
p295
aVI get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.
p296
aVThis cop comes after me with a rifle.
p297
aVHe wants to clunk me over the head!
p298
aVI'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!"
p299
aVI go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.
p300
aVIt's one of these bell-tower buildings.
p301
aVThe cop's chasing me.
p302
aVChasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.
p303
aVChases me into this room.
p304
aVThe entranceway to the bell tower.
p305
aVI slam the door behind me, climb up,
p306
aVgo past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.
p307
aVAnd I'm thinking, "Oh yeah,
p308
aVthe square root of the length is proportional to its period." (Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VI keep climbing up, go back.
p311
aVI go to a place where a dowel splits off.
p312
aVThere's a clock, clock, clock, clock.
p313
aVThe time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.
p314
aVI'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.
p315
aVI climb up, and there's this place, way in the back,
p316
aVthat you climb up this wooden ladder.
p317
aVI pop up the top, and there's a cupola.
p318
aVA dome, one of these ten-foot domes.
p319
aVI'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads,
p320
aVshooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.
p321
aVAnd I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?"
p322
aVThen I remember what my English teacher in high school said.
p323
aVNamely, that when they cast bells,
p324
aVthey write inscriptions on them.
p325
aVSo, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.
p326
aVI'm asking myself, "Why am I here?"
p327
aa(lp328
VSo, at this time, I'd like to tell you the words inscribed
p329
aVupon the Hayes Hall tower bells:
p330
aV"All truth is one.
p331
aVIn this light, may science and religion endeavor here
p332
aVfor the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light,
p333
aVfrom narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.
p334
aVIt is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn."
p335
aVThank you very much.

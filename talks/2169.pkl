VI'm a blogger, a filmmaker and a butcher,
p5
aVand I'll explain how these identities come together.
p6
aa(lp7
VIt started four years ago,
p8
aVwhen a friend and I opened our first Ramadan fast
p9
aVat one of the busiest mosques in New York City.
p10
aVCrowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets.
p11
aVIt was an FBI agent's wet dream. (Laughter)
p12
aVBut being a part of this community, we knew how welcoming this space was.
p13
aVFor years, I'd seen photos  of this space being documented
p14
aVas a lifeless and cold monolith,
p15
aVmuch like the stereotypical image painted of the American Muslim experience.
p16
aa(lp17
VFrustrated by this myopic view,
p18
aVmy friend and I had this crazy idea:
p19
aVLet's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state
p20
aVeach night of Ramadan
p21
aVand share those stories on a blog.
p22
aVWe called it "30 Mosques in 30 Days,"
p23
aVand we drove to all the 50 states
p24
aVand shared stories from over 100 vastly different Muslim communities,
p25
aVranging from the Cambodian refugees in the L.A. projects
p26
aVto the black Sufis living in the woods of South Carolina.
p27
aVWhat emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America.
p28
aVThe media coverage forced local journalists
p29
aVto revisit their Muslim communities,
p30
aVbut what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world
p31
aVbeing inspired to take their own 30-mosque journey.
p32
aVThere were even these two NFL athletes
p33
aVwho took a sabbatical from the league to do so.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd as 30 Mosques was blossoming around the world,
p36
aVI was actually stuck in Pakistan working on a film.
p37
aVMy codirector, Omar, and I were at  a breaking point with many of our friends
p38
aVon how to position the film.
p39
aVThe movie is called "These Birds Walk,"
p40
aVand it is about wayward street kids
p41
aVwho are struggling to find some semblance of family.
p42
aVWe focus on the complexities of youth and family discord,
p43
aVbut our friends kept on nudging us to comment on drones and target killings
p44
aVto make the film "more relevant,"
p45
aVessentially reducing these people who have entrusted us with their stories
p46
aVinto sociopolitical symbols.
p47
aVOf course, we didn't listen to them,
p48
aVand instead, we championed the tender gestures of love
p49
aVand headlong flashes of youth.
p50
aVThe agenda behind our cinematic  immersion was only empathy,
p51
aVan emotion that's largely  deficient from films
p52
aVthat come from our region of the world.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd as "These Birds Walk" played at film  festivals and theaters internationally,
p55
aVI finally had my feet planted at home in New York,
p56
aVand with all the extra time and still no real money,
p57
aVmy wife tasked me to cook more for us.
p58
aVAnd whenever I'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat,
p59
aVsomething felt off.
p60
aa(lp61
VFor those that don't know, halal is a term used for meat
p62
aVthat is raised and slaughtered humanely following very strict Islamic guidelines.
p63
aVUnfortunately, the majority of halal meat in America
p64
aVdoesn't rise to the standard that my faith calls for.
p65
aVThe more I learned about these unethical practices,
p66
aVthe more violated I felt,
p67
aVparticularly because businesses from my own community
p68
aVwere the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy.
p69
aVSo, with emotions running high, and absolutely no experience in butchery,
p70
aVsome friends and I opened a meat store
p71
aVin the heart of the East Village fashion district.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVWe call it Honest Chops,
p74
aVand we're reclaiming halal by sourcing organic, humanely raised animals,
p75
aVand by making it accessible and affordable to working-class families.
p76
aVThere's really nothing like it in America.
p77
aVThe unbelievable part is actually that 90 percent of our in-store customers
p78
aVare not even Muslim.
p79
aVFor many, it is their first time  interacting with Islam
p80
aVon such an intimate level.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo all these disparate projects \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p83
aVare the result of a restlessness.
p84
aVThey are a visceral response to the businesses and curators
p85
aVwho work hard to oversimplify my beliefs and my community,
p86
aVand the only way to beat their machine is to play by different rules.
p87
aVWe must fight with an inventive approach.
p88
aVWith the trust, with the access, with the love that only we can bring,
p89
aVwe must unapologetically reclaim our beliefs
p90
aVin every moving image, in every cut of meat,
p91
aVbecause if we whitewash our stories for the sake of mass appeal,
p92
aVnot only will we fail,
p93
aVbut we will be trumped by those with more money and more resources
p94
aVto tell our stories.
p95
aVBut the call for creative courage is not for novelty or relevance.
p96
aVIt is simply because our communities are so damn unique and so damn beautiful.
p97
aVThey demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected.
p98
aVThank you.
p99
aV(Applause)

Phrases like African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, etc., are bureaucratic words that do not hold within them the revolutionary aspirations and histories of a people (categorized but not controlled). I prefer words like black, desi, Latino, Chicano, because these words raise associations of struggles, such as the Black Power movement (Black is Beautiful, etc.), the Chicano struggles of the farm workers, of La Raza, and what not. Desi seems to be a similar word, one filled with so much historical emotion. And again, it is an ironic word because it means \'of the homeland,\' but it does not say what that homeland is. We who use it do not harken back to the homeland of the subcontinent, because we are generally not nationalistic in that sense. Our homeland is an imaginary one that stretches from Jackson Heights to the Ghadar Party, from the rallies against Dotbusters to the Komagata Maru, from the 1965 Immigration Act to Devon Street. This is a homeland that we can relate to and it is what makes us feel like we belong in something of a collectivity. Hence desi.\'\\r\\n"}, {"is_pdf": false, "headline": "Kahlil Joseph\'s Emotional Eye", "link_url": "http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/kahlil-josephs-emotional-eye", "eyebrow": null, "label": "READ_Book", "note": "Hilton Als\\r\\n*The New Yorker*, September 18, 2012", "position": null, "blurb": "I love *New Yorker* critic Hilton Als.

When Mr. Als deconstructs Mr. Joseph\\u2019s work, you get a great passage like this that inspires you to continue fighting to produce powerful and moving art:\\r\\n\\r\\n\'In Joseph\\u2019s pi\\u00e8ce de r\\u00e9sistance, the utterly extraordinary \'Black Up,\' with music by Shabazz Palaces, Joseph records the fragmented, intense world of the kind of place where I grew up: a ghetto world that wouldn\\u2019t call itself that without the help of sociologists or social workers \\u2014 you don\\u2019t know what you don\\u2019t have until someone points it out and decides to name it. In \'Black Up,\' Joseph punctuates the love and beauty he finds under train tracks, in a lover\\u2019s soft face and body on hard streets, with images of horses, the sea, and dead black men laying in a field. Nature is relative, while all human experience is natural. Joseph shows us all that, from different angles.\'"}], "title": "Reading list"}], "published": true, "type": "recommendation", "blurb": "Books, articles and passages that have helped Tariq come to a deeper understanding of his own faith and culture."}, "corrections": []}], "event": "TEDGlobal 2014", "name": "Bassam Tariq: The beauty and diversity of Muslim life"}'

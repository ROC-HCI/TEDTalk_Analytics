VHumans have long held a fascination
p5
aVfor the human brain.
p6
aVWe chart it, we've described it,
p7
aVwe've drawn it,
p8
aVwe've mapped it.
p9
aVNow just like the physical maps of our world
p10
aVthat have been highly influenced by technology \u2014
p11
aVthink Google Maps,
p12
aVthink GPS \u2014
p13
aVthe same thing is happening for brain mapping
p14
aVthrough transformation.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo let's take a look at the brain.
p17
aVMost people, when they first look at a fresh human brain,
p18
aVthey say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at
p19
aVwhen someone shows you a brain."
p20
aVTypically, what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray.
p21
aVAnd this outer layer, this is the vasculature,
p22
aVwhich is incredible, around a human brain.
p23
aVThis is the blood vessels.
p24
aV20 percent of the oxygen
p25
aVcoming from your lungs,
p26
aV20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart,
p27
aVis servicing this one organ.
p28
aVThat's basically, if you hold two fists together,
p29
aVit's just slightly larger than the two fists.
p30
aa(lp31
VScientists, sort of at the end of the 20th century,
p32
aVlearned that they could track blood flow
p33
aVto map non-invasively
p34
aVwhere activity was going on in the human brain.
p35
aVSo for example, they can see in the back part of the brain,
p36
aVwhich is just turning around there.
p37
aVThere's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.
p38
aVIt's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement.
p39
aVOn the side here, this is temporal cortex.
p40
aVThis is the area where primary auditory processing \u2014
p41
aVso you're hearing my words,
p42
aVyou're sending it up into higher language processing centers.
p43
aVTowards the front of the brain
p44
aVis the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making \u2014
p45
aVit's the last to mature in late adulthood.
p46
aVThis is where all your decision-making processes are going on.
p47
aVIt's the place where you're deciding right now
p48
aVyou probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo if you take a deeper look at the brain,
p51
aVone of the things, if you look at it in cross-section,
p52
aVwhat you can see
p53
aVis that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there.
p54
aVBut there's actually a lot of structure there.
p55
aVIt's cells and it's wires all wired together.
p56
aVSo about a hundred years ago,
p57
aVsome scientists invented a stain that would stain cells.
p58
aVAnd that's shown here in the the very light blue.
p59
aVYou can see areas
p60
aVwhere neuronal cell bodies are being stained.
p61
aVAnd what you can see is it's very non-uniform. You see a lot more structure there.
p62
aVSo the outer part of that brain
p63
aVis the neocortex.
p64
aVIt's one continuous processing unit, if you will.
p65
aVBut you can also see things underneath there as well.
p66
aVAnd all of these blank areas
p67
aVare the areas in which the wires are running through.
p68
aVThey're probably less cell dense.
p69
aVSo there's about 86 billion neurons in our brain.
p70
aVAnd as you can see, they're very non-uniformly distributed.
p71
aVAnd how they're distributed really contributes
p72
aVto their underlying function.
p73
aVAnd of course, as I mentioned before,
p74
aVsince we can now start to map brain function,
p75
aVwe can start to tie these into the individual cells.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo let's take a deeper look.
p78
aVLet's look at neurons.
p79
aVSo as I mentioned, there are 86 billion neurons.
p80
aVThere are also these smaller cells as you'll see.
p81
aVThese are support cells \u2014 astrocytes glia.
p82
aVAnd the nerves themselves
p83
aVare the ones who are receiving input.
p84
aVThey're storing it, they're processing it.
p85
aVEach neuron is connected via synapses
p86
aVto up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain.
p87
aVAnd each neuron itself
p88
aVis largely unique.
p89
aVThe unique character of both individual neurons
p90
aVand neurons within a collection of the brain
p91
aVare driven by fundamental properties
p92
aVof their underlying biochemistry.
p93
aVThese are proteins.
p94
aVThey're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement.
p95
aVThey're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with.
p96
aVAnd they're controlling
p97
aVbasically everything that the nervous system has to do.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo if we zoom in to an even deeper level,
p100
aVall of those proteins
p101
aVare encoded by our genomes.
p102
aVWe each have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
p103
aVWe get one from mom, one from dad.
p104
aVAnd on these chromosomes
p105
aVare roughly 25,000 genes.
p106
aVThey're encoded in the DNA.
p107
aVAnd the nature of a given cell
p108
aVdriving its underlying biochemistry
p109
aVis dictated by which of these 25,000 genes
p110
aVare turned on
p111
aVand at what level they're turned on.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd so our project
p114
aVis seeking to look at this readout,
p115
aVunderstanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on.
p116
aVSo in order to undertake such a project,
p117
aVwe obviously need brains.
p118
aVSo we sent our lab technician out.
p119
aVWe were seeking normal human brains.
p120
aVWhat we actually start with
p121
aVis a medical examiner's office.
p122
aVThis a place where the dead are brought in.
p123
aVWe are seeking normal human brains.
p124
aVThere's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains.
p125
aVWe want to make sure
p126
aVthat we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60,
p127
aVthey died a somewhat natural death
p128
aVwith no injury to the brain,
p129
aVno history of psychiatric disease,
p130
aVno drugs on board \u2014
p131
aVwe do a toxicology workup.
p132
aVAnd we're very careful
p133
aVabout the brains that we do take.
p134
aVWe're also selecting for brains
p135
aVin which we can get the tissue,
p136
aVwe can get consent to take the tissue
p137
aVwithin 24 hours of time of death.
p138
aVBecause what we're trying to measure, the RNA \u2014
p139
aVwhich is the readout from our genes \u2014
p140
aVis very labile,
p141
aVand so we have to move very quickly.
p142
aa(lp143
VOne side note on the collection of brains:
p144
aVbecause of the way that we collect,
p145
aVand because we require consent,
p146
aVwe actually have a lot more male brains than female brains.
p147
aVMales are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life.
p148
aVAnd men are much more likely
p149
aVto have their significant other, spouse, give consent
p150
aVthan the other way around.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VSo the first thing that we do at the site of collection
p155
aVis we collect what's called an MR.
p156
aVThis is magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 MRI.
p157
aVIt's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data.
p158
aVSo we collect this MR.
p159
aVAnd you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.
p160
aVThe next thing we do
p161
aVis we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging.
p162
aVThis maps the large cabling in the brain.
p163
aVAnd again, you can think of this
p164
aVas almost mapping our interstate highways, if you will.
p165
aVThe brain is removed from the skull,
p166
aVand then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices.
p167
aVAnd those are frozen solid,
p168
aVand they're shipped to Seattle.
p169
aVAnd in Seattle, we take these \u2014
p170
aVthis is a whole human hemisphere \u2014
p171
aVand we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer.
p172
aVThere's a blade here that's going to cut across
p173
aVa section of the tissue
p174
aVand transfer it to a microscope slide.
p175
aVWe're going to then apply one of those stains to it,
p176
aVand we scan it.
p177
aVAnd then what we get is our first mapping.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo this is where experts come in
p180
aVand they make basic anatomic assignments.
p181
aVYou could consider this state boundaries, if you will,
p182
aVthose pretty broad outlines.
p183
aVFrom this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces,
p184
aVwhich then we can put on a smaller cryostat.
p185
aVAnd this is just showing this here \u2014
p186
aVthis frozen tissue, and it's being cut.
p187
aVThis is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width.
p188
aVAnd remember, it's frozen.
p189
aVAnd so you can see here,
p190
aVold-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied.
p191
aVWe take a microscope slide.
p192
aVThen we very carefully melt onto the slide.
p193
aVThis will then go onto a robot
p194
aVthat's going to apply one of those stains to it.
p195
aVAnd our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo again this is what they can see under the microscope.
p198
aVYou can see collections and configurations
p199
aVof large and small cells
p200
aVin clusters and various places.
p201
aVAnd from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments.
p202
aVAnd they can make basically what's a reference atlas.
p203
aVThis is a more detailed map.
p204
aa(lp205
VOur scientists then use this
p206
aVto go back to another piece of that tissue
p207
aVand do what's called laser scanning microdissection.
p208
aVSo the technician takes the instructions.
p209
aVThey scribe along a place there.
p210
aVAnd then the laser actually cuts.
p211
aVYou can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off.
p212
aVYou can see on the microscope slide here,
p213
aVthat's what's happening in real time.
p214
aVThere's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue.
p215
aVWe take that tissue,
p216
aVwe purify the RNA out of it
p217
aVusing some basic technology,
p218
aVand then we put a florescent tag on it.
p219
aVWe take that tagged material
p220
aVand we put it on to something called a microarray.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow this may look like a bunch of dots to you,
p223
aVbut each one of these individual dots
p224
aVis actually a unique piece of the human genome
p225
aVthat we spotted down on glass.
p226
aVThis has roughly 60,000 elements on it,
p227
aVso we repeatedly measure various genes
p228
aVof the 25,000 genes in the genome.
p229
aVAnd when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it,
p230
aVwe get a unique fingerprint, if you will,
p231
aVquantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow we do this over and over again,
p234
aVthis process for any given brain.
p235
aVWe're taking over a thousand samples for each brain.
p236
aVThis area shown here is an area called the hippocampus.
p237
aVIt's involved in learning and memory.
p238
aVAnd it contributes to about 70 samples
p239
aVof those thousand samples.
p240
aVSo each sample gets us about 50,000 data points
p241
aVwith repeat measurements, a thousand samples.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo roughly, we have 50 million data points
p244
aVfor a given human brain.
p245
aVWe've done right now
p246
aVtwo human brains-worth of data.
p247
aVWe've put all of that together
p248
aVinto one thing,
p249
aVand I'll show you what that synthesis looks like.
p250
aVIt's basically a large data set of information
p251
aVthat's all freely available to any scientist around the world.
p252
aVThey don't even have to log in to come use this tool,
p253
aVmine this data, find interesting things out with this.
p254
aVSo here's the modalities that we put together.
p255
aVYou'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before.
p256
aVHere's the MR. It provides the framework.
p257
aVThere's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn,
p258
aVit allows you to zoom in,
p259
aVit allows you to highlight individual structures.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut most importantly,
p262
aVwe're now mapping into this anatomic framework,
p263
aVwhich is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on.
p264
aVSo the red levels
p265
aVare where a gene is turned on to a great degree.
p266
aVGreen is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on.
p267
aVAnd each gene gives us a fingerprint.
p268
aVAnd remember that we've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome
p269
aVand have all of that data available.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo what can scientists learn about this data?
p272
aVWe're just starting to look at this data ourselves.
p273
aVThere's some basic things that you would want to understand.
p274
aVTwo great examples are drugs,
p275
aVProzac and Wellbutrin.
p276
aVThese are commonly prescribed antidepressants.
p277
aVNow remember, we're assaying genes.
p278
aVGenes send the instructions to make proteins.
p279
aVProteins are targets for drugs.
p280
aVSo drugs bind to proteins
p281
aVand either turn them off, etc.
p282
aVSo if you want to understand the action of drugs,
p283
aVyou want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to,
p284
aVand also in the ways you don't want them to.
p285
aVIn the side effect profile, etc.,
p286
aVyou want to see where those genes are turned on.
p287
aVAnd for the first time, we can actually do that.
p288
aVWe can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo now we can look throughout the brain.
p291
aVWe can see this unique fingerprint.
p292
aVAnd we get confirmation.
p293
aVWe get confirmation that, indeed, the gene is turned on \u2014
p294
aVfor something like Prozac,
p295
aVin serotonergic structures, things that are already known be affected \u2014
p296
aVbut we also get to see the whole thing.
p297
aVWe also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before,
p298
aVand we see these genes turned on there.
p299
aVIt's as interesting a side effect as it could be.
p300
aVOne other thing you can do with such a thing
p301
aVis you can, because it's a pattern matching exercise,
p302
aVbecause there's unique fingerprint,
p303
aVwe can actually scan through the entire genome
p304
aVand find other proteins
p305
aVthat show a similar fingerprint.
p306
aVSo if you're in drug discovery, for example,
p307
aVyou can go through
p308
aVan entire listing of what the genome has on offer
p309
aVto find perhaps better drug targets and optimize.
p310
aa(lp311
VMost of you are probably familiar
p312
aVwith genome-wide association studies
p313
aVin the form of people covering in the news
p314
aVsaying, "Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes
p315
aVwhich affect X."
p316
aVAnd so these kinds of studies
p317
aVare routinely published by scientists
p318
aVand they're great. They analyze large populations.
p319
aVThey look at their entire genomes,
p320
aVand they try to find hot spots of activity
p321
aVthat are linked causally to genes.
p322
aVBut what you get out of such an exercise
p323
aVis simply a list of genes.
p324
aVIt tells you the what, but it doesn't tell you the where.
p325
aVAnd so it's very important for those researchers
p326
aVthat we've created this resource.
p327
aVNow they can come in
p328
aVand they can start to get clues about activity.
p329
aVThey can start to look at common pathways \u2014
p330
aVother things that they simply haven't been able to do before.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo I think this audience in particular
p333
aVcan understand the importance of individuality.
p334
aVAnd I think every human,
p335
aVwe all have different genetic backgrounds,
p336
aVwe all have lived separate lives.
p337
aVBut the fact is
p338
aVour genomes are greater than 99 percent similar.
p339
aVWe're similar at the genetic level.
p340
aVAnd what we're finding
p341
aVis actually, even at the brain biochemical level,
p342
aVwe are quite similar.
p343
aVAnd so this shows it's not 99 percent,
p344
aVbut it's roughly 90 percent correspondence
p345
aVat a reasonable cutoff,
p346
aVso everything in the cloud is roughly correlated.
p347
aVAnd then we find some outliers,
p348
aVsome things that lie beyond the cloud.
p349
aVAnd those genes are interesting,
p350
aVbut they're very subtle.
p351
aVSo I think it's an important message
p352
aVto take home today
p353
aVthat even though we celebrate all of our differences,
p354
aVwe are quite similar
p355
aVeven at the brain level.
p356
aa(lp357
VNow what do those differences look like?
p358
aVThis is an example of a study that we did
p359
aVto follow up and see what exactly those differences were \u2014
p360
aVand they're quite subtle.
p361
aVThese are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type.
p362
aVThese are two genes that we found as good examples.
p363
aVOne is called RELN \u2014 it's involved in early developmental cues.
p364
aVDISC1 is a gene
p365
aVthat's deleted in schizophrenia.
p366
aVThese aren't schizophrenic individuals,
p367
aVbut they do show some population variation.
p368
aVAnd so what you're looking at here
p369
aVin donor one and donor four,
p370
aVwhich are the exceptions to the other two,
p371
aVthat genes are being turned on
p372
aVin a very specific subset of cells.
p373
aVIt's this dark purple precipitate within the cell
p374
aVthat's telling us a gene is turned on there.
p375
aVWhether or not that's due
p376
aVto an individual's genetic background or their experiences,
p377
aVwe don't know.
p378
aVThose kinds of studies require much larger populations.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo I'm going to leave you with a final note
p381
aVabout the complexity of the brain
p382
aVand how much more we have to go.
p383
aVI think these resources are incredibly valuable.
p384
aVThey give researchers a handle
p385
aVon where to go.
p386
aVBut we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point.
p387
aVWe're certainly going to be looking at more.
p388
aVI'll just close by saying
p389
aVthat the tools are there,
p390
aVand this is truly an unexplored, undiscovered continent.
p391
aVThis is the new frontier, if you will.
p392
aVAnd so for those who are undaunted,
p393
aVbut humbled by the complexity of the brain,
p394
aVthe future awaits.
p395
aa(lp396
VThanks.

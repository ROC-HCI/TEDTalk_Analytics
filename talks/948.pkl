VThis strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.
p5
aVWhat looks like moss covering rocks
p6
aVis actually a shrub
p7
aVcomprised of thousands of branches,
p8
aVeach containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end
p9
aVand so densely packed together
p10
aVthat you could actually stand on top of it.
p11
aVThis individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile,
p12
aVand it happens to be 3,000 years old.
p13
aVIt also happens to be a relative of parsley.
p14
aa(lp15
VFor the past five years, I've been researching,
p16
aVworking with biologists
p17
aVand traveling all over the world
p18
aVto find continuously living organisms
p19
aVthat are 2,000 years old and older.
p20
aVThe project is part art and part science.
p21
aVThere's an environmental component.
p22
aVAnd I'm also trying to create a means
p23
aVin which to step outside our quotidian experience of time
p24
aVand to start to consider a deeper timescale.
p25
aVI selected 2,000 years as my minimum age
p26
aVbecause I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero
p27
aVand work backward from there.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhat you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi,
p30
aVliving on the remote island of Yakushima.
p31
aVThe tree was in part a catalyst for the project.
p32
aVI'd been traveling in Japan
p33
aVwithout an agenda other than to photograph,
p34
aVand then I heard about this tree
p35
aVthat is 2,180 years old
p36
aVand knew that I had to go visit it.
p37
aVIt wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York
p38
aVthat I got the idea for the project.
p39
aVSo it was the slow churn, if you will.
p40
aVI think it was my longstanding desire
p41
aVto bring together my interest
p42
aVin art, science and philosophy
p43
aVthat allowed me to be ready
p44
aVwhen the proverbial light bulb went on.
p45
aVSo I started researching, and to my surprise,
p46
aVthis project had never been done before
p47
aVin the arts or the sciences.
p48
aVAnd \u2014 perhaps naively \u2014
p49
aVI was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences
p50
aVthat deals with this idea
p51
aVof global species longevity.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo what you're looking at here
p54
aVis the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen,
p55
aVand this is around 3,000 years old
p56
aVand lives in Greenland,
p57
aVwhich is a long way to go for some lichens.
p58
aVVisiting Greenland was more like
p59
aVtraveling back in time
p60
aVthan just traveling very far north.
p61
aVIt was very primal and more remote
p62
aVthan anything I'd ever experienced before.
p63
aVAnd this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences.
p64
aVOne was when I had been dropped off by boat
p65
aVon a remote fjord,
p66
aVonly to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet
p67
aVwere nowhere to be found.
p68
aVAnd it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail,
p69
aVso I was literally left to my own devices.
p70
aVBut luckily, it worked out obviously,
p71
aVbut it was a humbling experience
p72
aVto feel so disconnected.
p73
aVAnd then a few days later,
p74
aVwe had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream
p75
aVnear our campsite,
p76
aVwhere the fish were so abundant
p77
aVthat you could literally reach into the stream
p78
aVand grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands.
p79
aVIt was like visiting
p80
aVa more innocent time on the planet.
p81
aVAnd then, of course, there's the lichens.
p82
aVThese lichens grow only one centimeter
p83
aVevery hundred years.
p84
aVI think that really puts human lifespans
p85
aVinto a different perspective.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd what you're looking at here
p88
aVis an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon.
p89
aVAnd if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings,"
p90
aVsounds ominous, it is.
p91
aVThe Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus,
p92
aVkilling certain species of trees in the forest.
p93
aVIt's also more benignly known
p94
aVas the honey mushroom or the "humongous fungus"
p95
aVbecause it happens to be
p96
aVone of the world's largest organisms as well.
p97
aVSo with the help of some biologists studying the fungus,
p98
aVI got some maps and some GPS coordinates
p99
aVand chartered a plane
p100
aVand started looking for the death rings,
p101
aVthe circular patterns
p102
aVin which the fungus kills the trees.
p103
aVSo I'm not sure if there are any in this photo,
p104
aVbut I do know the fungus is down there.
p105
aVAnd then this back down on the ground
p106
aVand you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.
p107
aVSo that white material that you see
p108
aVin between the bark and the wood
p109
aVis the mycelial felt of the fungus,
p110
aVand what it's doing \u2014 it's actually
p111
aVslowly strangling the tree to death
p112
aVby preventing the flow of water and nutrients.
p113
aVSo this strategy has served it pretty well \u2014
p114
aVit's 2,400 years old.
p115
aVAnd then from underground to underwater.
p116
aa(lp117
VThis is a Brain Coral living in Tobago
p118
aVthat's around 2,000 years old.
p119
aVAnd I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.
p120
aVThis is at about 60 feet
p121
aVor 18 meters, depth.
p122
aVAnd you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral.
p123
aVThat was actually caused by a school of parrot fish
p124
aVthat had started eating it,
p125
aVthough luckily, they lost interest before killing it.
p126
aVLuckily still, it seems to be out of harm's way
p127
aVof the recent oil spill.
p128
aVBut that being said, we just as easily could have lost
p129
aVone of the oldest living things on the planet,
p130
aVand the full impact of that disaster
p131
aVis still yet to be seen.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow this is something that I think
p134
aVis one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.
p135
aVThis is clonal colony
p136
aVof Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah,
p137
aVthat is literally 80,000 years old.
p138
aVWhat looks like a forest
p139
aVis actually only one tree.
p140
aVImagine that it's one giant root system
p141
aVand each tree is a stem
p142
aVcoming up from that system.
p143
aVSo what you have is one giant,
p144
aVinterconnected,
p145
aVgenetically identical individual
p146
aVthat's been living for 80,000 years.
p147
aVIt also happens to be male
p148
aVand, in theory immortal.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VThis is a clonal tree as well.
p153
aVThis is the spruce Gran Picea,
p154
aVwhich at 9,550 years
p155
aVis a mere babe in the woods.
p156
aVThe location of this tree
p157
aVis actually kept secret for its own protection.
p158
aVI spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree,
p159
aVand he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center
p160
aVis most likely a product of climate change.
p161
aVAs it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain,
p162
aVthe vegetation zone is actually changing.
p163
aVSo we don't even necessarily have to have
p164
aVdirect contact with these organisms
p165
aVto have a very real impact on them.
p166
aa(lp167
VThis is the Fortingall Yew \u2014
p168
aVno, I'm just kidding \u2014
p169
aVthis is the Fortingall Yew.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVBut I put that slide in there
p172
aVbecause I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project.
p173
aVAnd aside from coral,
p174
aVthe answer is no.
p175
aVDoes anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is \u2014
p176
aVany guesses?
p177
aV(Audience: 300.)
p178
aVRachel Sussman: 300? No, 175
p179
aVis the oldest living tortoise,
p180
aVso nowhere near 2,000.
p181
aVAnd then, you might have heard
p182
aVof this giant clam that was discovered
p183
aVoff the coast of northern Iceland
p184
aVthat reached 405 years old.
p185
aVHowever, it died in the lab
p186
aVas they were determining its age.
p187
aVThe most interesting discovery of late, I think
p188
aVis the so-called immortal jellyfish,
p189
aVwhich has actually been observed in the lab
p190
aVto be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state
p191
aVafter reaching full maturity.
p192
aVSo that being said,
p193
aVit's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.
p194
aVAnd back to the yew here.
p195
aVSo as you can see, it's in a churchyard;
p196
aVit's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall.
p197
aVAnd there are actually a number or ancient yews
p198
aVin churchyards around the U.K.,
p199
aVbut if you do the math, you'll remember
p200
aVit's actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd now down to another part of the world.
p203
aVI had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa
p204
aVwith an expert in Baobab trees.
p205
aVAnd we saw a number of them,
p206
aVand this is most likely the oldest.
p207
aVIt's around 2,000,
p208
aVand it's called the Sagole Baobab.
p209
aVAnd you know, I think of all of these organisms
p210
aVas palimpsests.
p211
aVThey contain thousands of years
p212
aVof their own histories within themselves,
p213
aVand they also contain records of natural and human events.
p214
aVAnd the Baobabs in particular
p215
aVare a great example of this.
p216
aVYou can see that this one
p217
aVhas names carved into its trunk,
p218
aVbut it also records some natural events.
p219
aVSo the Baobabs, as they get older,
p220
aVtend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.
p221
aVAnd this can create
p222
aVgreat natural shelters for animals,
p223
aVbut they've also been appropriated
p224
aVfor some rather dubious human uses,
p225
aVincluding a bar, a prison
p226
aVand even a toilet inside of a tree.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd this brings me to another favorite of mine \u2014
p229
aVI think, because it is just so unusual.
p230
aVThis plant is called the Welwitschia,
p231
aVand it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola,
p232
aVwhere it's uniquely adapted
p233
aVto collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.
p234
aVAnd what's more, it's actually a tree.
p235
aVIt's a primitive conifer.
p236
aVYou'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center.
p237
aVAnd what looks like two big heaps of leaves,
p238
aVis actually two single leaves
p239
aVthat get shredded up
p240
aVby the harsh desert conditions over time.
p241
aVAnd it actually never sheds those leaves,
p242
aVso it also bears the distinction
p243
aVof having the longest leaves
p244
aVin the plant kingdom.
p245
aVI spoke to a biologist
p246
aVat the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown
p247
aVto ask him
p248
aVwhere he thought this remarkable plant came from,
p249
aVand his thought was that
p250
aVif you travel around Namibia,
p251
aVyou see that there are a number of petrified forests,
p252
aVand the logs are all \u2014
p253
aVthe logs are all giant coniferous trees,
p254
aVand yet there's no sign of where they might have come from.
p255
aVSo his thought was that
p256
aVflooding in the north of Africa
p257
aVactually brought those coniferous trees down
p258
aVtens of thousands of years ago,
p259
aVand what resulted was this remarkable adaptation
p260
aVto this unique desert environment.
p261
aa(lp262
VThis is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things.
p263
aVThis is something called an underground forest.
p264
aVSo, I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden,
p265
aVwho explained that certain species of trees
p266
aVhave adapted to this region.
p267
aVIt's bushfelt region,
p268
aVwhich is dry and prone to a lot of fires,
p269
aVas so what these trees have done
p270
aVis, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree,
p271
aVand that this is ground level,
p272
aVimagine that the whole thing,
p273
aVthat whole bulk of the tree,
p274
aVmigrated underground,
p275
aVand you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface.
p276
aVThat way, when a fire roars through,
p277
aVit's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.
p278
aVThe tree can easily recover.
p279
aVThese also tend to grow clonally,
p280
aVthe oldest of which is 13,000 years old.
p281
aa(lp282
VBack in the U.S., there's a couple plants of similar age.
p283
aVThis is the clonal Creosote bush,
p284
aVwhich is around 12,000 years old.
p285
aVIf you've been in the American West,
p286
aVyou know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous,
p287
aVbut that being said, you see that this has
p288
aVthis unique, circular form.
p289
aVAnd what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards
p290
aVfrom that original shape.
p291
aVAnd it's one \u2014 again, that interconnected root system,
p292
aVmaking it one genetically identical individual.
p293
aVIt also has a friend nearby \u2014
p294
aVwell, I think they're friends.
p295
aVThis is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away,
p296
aVand it's a little bit older than 12,000 years.
p297
aVAnd you see it has that similar circular form.
p298
aVAnd there's some younger clones
p299
aVdotting the landscape behind it.
p300
aVAnd both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush,
p301
aVlive on Bureau of Land Management land,
p302
aVand that's very different from being protected in a national park.
p303
aVIn fact, this land is designated
p304
aVfor recreational all-terrain vehicle use.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo, now I want to show what very well might be
p307
aVthe oldest living thing on the planet.
p308
aVThis is Siberian Actinobacteria,
p309
aVwhich is between 400,000
p310
aVand 600,000 years old.
p311
aVThis bacteria was discovered several years ago
p312
aVby a team of planetary biologists
p313
aVhoping to find clues to life on other planets
p314
aVby looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours.
p315
aVAnd what they found, by doing research into the permafrost,
p316
aVwas this bacteria.
p317
aVBut what's unique about it is that
p318
aVit's doing DNA repair below freezing.
p319
aVAnd what that means is that it's not dormant \u2014
p320
aVit's actually been living and growing
p321
aVfor half a million years.
p322
aVIt's also probably one the most vulnerable
p323
aVof the oldest living things,
p324
aVbecause if the permafrost melts,
p325
aVit won't survive.
p326
aa(lp327
VThis is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things,
p328
aVso you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world.
p329
aVThe blue flags represent things that I've already photographed,
p330
aVand the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to.
p331
aVYou'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica.
p332
aVI'm trying to travel there
p333
aVto find 5,000 year-old moss,
p334
aVwhich lives on the Antarctic Peninsula.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo, I probably have about two more years left
p337
aVon this project \u2014
p338
aVon this phase of the project,
p339
aVbut after five years,
p340
aVI really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work.
p341
aVThe oldest living things in the world
p342
aVare a record and celebration of our past,
p343
aVa call to action in the present
p344
aVand a barometer of our future.
p345
aVThey've survived for millennia
p346
aVin desert, in the permafrost,
p347
aVat the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean.
p348
aVThey've withstood
p349
aVuntold natural perils and human encroachments,
p350
aVbut now some of them are in jeopardy,
p351
aVand they can't just get up and get out of the way.
p352
aVIt's my hope that, by going to find these organisms,
p353
aVthat I can help draw attention
p354
aVto their remarkable resilience
p355
aVand help play a part in insuring
p356
aVtheir continued longevity into the foreseeable future.
p357
aa(lp358
VThank you.

VI'd like to invite you to close your eyes.
p5
aa(lp6
VImagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home.
p7
aVI'd like you to notice the color of the door,
p8
aVthe material that it's made out of.
p9
aVNow visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VThey are competing in a naked bicycle race,
p14
aVand they are headed straight for your front door.
p15
aVI need you to actually see this.
p16
aVThey are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty,
p17
aVthey're bouncing around a lot.
p18
aVAnd they crash straight into the front door of your home.
p19
aVBicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you,
p20
aVspokes end up in awkward places.
p21
aVStep over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway,
p22
aVwhatever's on the other side,
p23
aVand appreciate the quality of the light.
p24
aVThe light is shining down on Cookie Monster.
p25
aVCookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse.
p26
aVIt's a talking horse.
p27
aVYou can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose.
p28
aVYou can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth.
p29
aVWalk past him.
p30
aVWalk past him into your living room.
p31
aVIn your living room, in full imaginative broadband,
p32
aVpicture Britney Spears.
p33
aVShe is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table,
p34
aVand she's singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time."
p35
aVAnd then, follow me into your kitchen.
p36
aVIn your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road,
p37
aVand out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,
p38
aVthe Scarecrow and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz,"
p39
aVhand-in-hand, skipping straight towards you.
p40
aa(lp41
VOkay. Open your eyes.
p42
aa(lp43
VI want to tell you about a very bizarre contest
p44
aVthat is held every spring in New York City.
p45
aVIt's called the United States Memory Championship.
p46
aVAnd I had gone to cover this contest a few years back
p47
aVas a science journalist,
p48
aVexpecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants.
p49
aVThis was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,
p50
aVwidely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VThey were memorizing hundreds of random numbers,
p55
aVlooking at them just once.
p56
aVThey were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers.
p57
aVThey were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes.
p58
aVThey were competing to see who could memorize
p59
aVthe order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest.
p60
aVI was like, this is unbelievable.
p61
aVThese people must be freaks of nature.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd I started talking to a few of the competitors.
p64
aVThis is a guy called Ed Cook, who had come over from England,
p65
aVwhere he had one of the best-trained memories.
p66
aVAnd I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize
p67
aVthat you were a savant?"
p68
aVAnd Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.
p69
aVIn fact, I have just an average memory.
p70
aVEverybody who competes in this contest will tell you
p71
aVthat they have just an average memory.
p72
aVWe've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory
p73
aVusing a set of ancient techniques,
p74
aVtechniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece,
p75
aVthe same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches,
p76
aVthat medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books."
p77
aVAnd I said, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?"
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd we were standing outside the competition hall,
p80
aVand Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy,
p81
aVsays to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist.
p82
aVDo you know Britney Spears?"
p83
aVI'm like, "What? No. Why?"
p84
aV"Because I really want to teach Britney Spears
p85
aVhow to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards
p86
aVon U.S. national television.
p87
aVIt will prove to the world that anybody can do this."
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VI was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears,
p92
aVbut maybe you could teach me.
p93
aVI mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?"
p94
aVAnd that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
p95
aa(lp96
VI ended up spending the better part of the next year
p97
aVnot only training my memory,
p98
aVbut also investigating it,
p99
aVtrying to understand how it works,
p100
aVwhy it sometimes doesn't work,
p101
aVand what its potential might be.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd I met a host of really interesting people.
p104
aVThis is a guy called E.P.
p105
aVHe's an amnesic who had, very possibly,
p106
aVthe worst memory in the world.
p107
aVHis memory was so bad,
p108
aVthat he didn't even remember he had a memory problem,
p109
aVwhich is amazing.
p110
aVAnd he was this incredibly tragic figure,
p111
aVbut he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are.
p112
aa(lp113
VAt the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
p114
aVThis is Kim Peek, he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character
p115
aVin the movie "Rain Man."
p116
aVWe spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library
p117
aVmemorizing phone books,
p118
aVwhich was scintillating.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises,
p123
aVtreatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin,
p124
aVin antiquity, and then later, in the Middle Ages.
p125
aVAnd I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.
p126
aVOne of the really interesting things that I learned
p127
aVis that once upon a time,
p128
aVthis idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory
p129
aVwas not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.
p130
aVOnce upon a time, people invested in their memories,
p131
aVin laboriously furnishing their minds.
p132
aa(lp133
VOver the last few millenia,
p134
aVwe've invented a series of technologies \u2014
p135
aVfrom the alphabet, to the scroll,
p136
aVto the codex, the printing press, photography,
p137
aVthe computer, the smartphone \u2014
p138
aVthat have made it progressively easier and easier
p139
aVfor us to externalize our memories,
p140
aVfor us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity.
p141
aVThese technologies have made our modern world possible,
p142
aVbut they've also changed us.
p143
aVThey've changed us culturally,
p144
aVand I would argue that they've changed us cognitively.
p145
aVHaving little need to remember anymore,
p146
aVit sometimes seems like we've forgotten how.
p147
aa(lp148
VOne of the last places on Earth where you still find
p149
aVpeople passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,
p150
aVis at this totally singular memory contest.
p151
aVIt's actually not that singular,
p152
aVthere are contests held all over the world.
p153
aVAnd I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.
p154
aa(lp155
VA few years back a group of researchers at University College London
p156
aVbrought a bunch of memory champions into the lab.
p157
aVThey wanted to know:
p158
aVDo these guys have brains that are somehow structurally,
p159
aVanatomically different from the rest of ours?
p160
aVThe answer was no.
p161
aVAre they smarter than the rest of us?
p162
aVThey gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was: not really.
p163
aa(lp164
VThere was, however, one really interesting and telling difference
p165
aVbetween the brains of the memory champions
p166
aVand the control subjects that they were comparing them to.
p167
aVWhen they put these guys in an fMRI machine,
p168
aVscanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers
p169
aVand people's faces and pictures of snowflakes,
p170
aVthey found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain
p171
aVthan everyone else.
p172
aVOf note, they were using, or they seemed to be using,
p173
aVa part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation.
p174
aVWhy?
p175
aVAnd is there something that the rest of us can learn from this?
p176
aa(lp177
VThe sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where,
p178
aVevery year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly,
p179
aVand then the rest of the field has to play catch-up.
p180
aa(lp181
VThis is my friend Ben Pridmore,
p182
aVthree-time world memory champion.
p183
aVOn his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards
p184
aVthat he is about to try to memorize in one hour,
p185
aVusing a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered.
p186
aVHe used a similar technique
p187
aVto memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits
p188
aVin half an hour.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VYeah.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd while there are a whole host of ways
p195
aVof remembering stuff in these competitions,
p196
aVeverything, all of the techniques that are being used,
p197
aVultimately come down to a concept
p198
aVthat psychologists refer to as "elaborative encoding."
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd it's well-illustrated by a nifty paradox
p201
aVknown as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this:
p202
aVIf I tell two people to remember the same word,
p203
aVif I say to you,
p204
aV"Remember that there is a guy named Baker."
p205
aVThat's his name.
p206
aVAnd I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker."
p207
aVOkay?
p208
aVAnd I come back to you at some point later on,
p209
aVand I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back?
p210
aVDo you remember what it was?"
p211
aVThe person who was told his name is Baker
p212
aVis less likely to remember the same word
p213
aVthan the person was told his job is a baker.
p214
aVSame word, different amount of remembering; that's weird.
p215
aVWhat's going on here?
p216
aa(lp217
VWell, the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.
p218
aVIt is entirely untethered from all of the other memories
p219
aVfloating around in your skull.
p220
aVBut the common noun "baker" \u2014 we know bakers.
p221
aVBakers wear funny white hats.
p222
aVBakers have flour on their hands.
p223
aVBakers smell good when they come home from work.
p224
aVMaybe we even know a baker.
p225
aVAnd when we first hear that word,
p226
aVwe start putting these associational hooks into it,
p227
aVthat make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.
p228
aVThe entire art of what is going on in these memory contests,
p229
aVand the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life,
p230
aVis figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers
p231
aVinto lower-case B bakers \u2014
p232
aVto take information that is lacking in context,
p233
aVin significance, in meaning,
p234
aVand transform it in some way,
p235
aVso that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things
p236
aVthat you have in your mind.
p237
aa(lp238
VOne of the more elaborate techniques for doing this
p239
aVdates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.
p240
aVIt came to be known as the memory palace.
p241
aVThe story behind its creation goes like this:
p242
aa(lp243
VThere was a poet called Simonides, who was attending a banquet.
p244
aVHe was actually the hired entertainment,
p245
aVbecause back then, if you wanted to throw a really slamming party,
p246
aVyou didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.
p247
aVAnd he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door,
p248
aVand at the moment he does,
p249
aVthe banquet hall collapses.
p250
aVKills everybody inside.
p251
aVIt doesn't just kill everybody,
p252
aVit mangles the bodies beyond all recognition.
p253
aVNobody can say who was inside,
p254
aVnobody can say where they were sitting.
p255
aVThe bodies can't be properly buried.
p256
aVIt's one tragedy compounding another.
p257
aVSimonides, standing outside,
p258
aVthe sole survivor amid the wreckage,
p259
aVcloses his eyes and has this realization,
p260
aVwhich is that in his mind's eye,
p261
aVhe can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting.
p262
aVAnd he takes the relatives by the hand,
p263
aVand guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage.
p264
aa(lp265
VWhat Simonides figured out at that moment,
p266
aVis something that I think we all kind of intuitively know,
p267
aVwhich is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers,
p268
aVand word-for-word instructions from our colleagues,
p269
aVwe have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.
p270
aVIf I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story
p271
aVthat I just told you about Simonides,
p272
aVchances are you would have a tough time with it.
p273
aVBut, I would wager that if I asked you to recall
p274
aVwho is sitting on top of a talking tan horse
p275
aVin your foyer right now,
p276
aVyou would be able to see that.
p277
aa(lp278
VThe idea behind the memory palace
p279
aVis to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye,
p280
aVand populate it with images of the things that you want to remember \u2014
p281
aVthe crazier, weirder, more bizarre,
p282
aVfunnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,
p283
aVthe more unforgettable it's likely to be.
p284
aVThis is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years
p285
aVto the earliest Latin memory treatises.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo how does this work?
p288
aVLet's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech,
p289
aVand you want to do it from memory,
p290
aVand you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it,
p291
aVif he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VWhat you might do
p296
aVis picture yourself at the front door of your house.
p297
aVAnd you'd come up with some sort of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,
p298
aVto remind you that the first thing you want to talk about
p299
aVis this totally bizarre contest.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd then you'd go inside your house,
p304
aVand you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.
p305
aVAnd that would remind you
p306
aVthat you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook.
p307
aVAnd then you'd see an image of Britney Spears
p308
aVto remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell.
p309
aVAnd you'd go into your kitchen,
p310
aVand the fourth topic you were going to talk about
p311
aVwas this strange journey that you went on for a year,
p312
aVand you'd have some friends to help you remember that.
p313
aa(lp314
VThis is how Roman orators memorized their speeches \u2014
p315
aVnot word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up,
p316
aVbut topic-for-topic.
p317
aVIn fact, the phrase "topic sentence" \u2014
p318
aVthat comes from the Greek word "topos,"
p319
aVwhich means "place."
p320
aVThat's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric
p321
aVin these sorts of spatial terms.
p322
aVThe phrase "in the first place,"
p323
aVthat's like "in the first place of your memory palace."
p324
aa(lp325
VI thought this was just fascinating,
p326
aVand I got really into it.
p327
aVAnd I went to a few more of these memory contests,
p328
aVand I had this notion that I might write something longer
p329
aVabout this subculture of competitive memorizers.
p330
aVBut there was a problem.
p331
aVThe problem was that a memory contest
p332
aVis a pathologically boring event.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VTruly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs \u2014
p337
aVI mean, the most dramatic it gets
p338
aVis when somebody starts massaging their temples.
p339
aVAnd I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.
p340
aVI know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds,
p341
aVbut I don't have access to it.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd I realized, if I was going to tell this story,
p344
aVI needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.
p345
aVAnd so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes
p346
aVevery morning, before I sat down with my New York Times,
p347
aVjust trying to remember something.
p348
aVMaybe it was a poem,
p349
aVmaybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market.
p350
aVAnd I found that this was shockingly fun.
p351
aVI never would have expected that.
p352
aVIt was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.
p353
aVWhat you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better
p354
aVat creating, at dreaming up,
p355
aVthese utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious,
p356
aVand hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye.
p357
aVAnd I got pretty into it.
p358
aa(lp359
VThis is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VIt's a pair of earmuffs
p364
aVand a set of safety goggles that have been masked over
p365
aVexcept for two small pinholes,
p366
aVbecause distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy.
p367
aa(lp368
VI ended up coming back to that same contest
p369
aVthat I had covered a year earlier,
p370
aVand I had this notion that I might enter it,
p371
aVsort of as an experiment in participatory journalism.
p372
aVIt'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research.
p373
aVProblem was, the experiment went haywire.
p374
aVI won the contest \u2014
p375
aa(lp376
V(Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
Vwhich really wasn't supposed to happen.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Applause)
p381
aa(lp382
VNow, it is nice to be able to memorize speeches
p383
aVand phone numbers and shopping lists,
p384
aVbut it's actually kind of beside the point.
p385
aVThese are just tricks.
p386
aVThey work because they're based on some pretty basic principles
p387
aVabout how our brains work.
p388
aVAnd you don't have to be building memory palaces
p389
aVor memorizing packs of playing cards
p390
aVto benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.
p391
aa(lp392
VWe often talk about people with great memories
p393
aVas though it were some sort of an innate gift,
p394
aVbut that is not the case.
p395
aVGreat memories are learned.
p396
aVAt the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
p397
aVWe remember when we are deeply engaged.
p398
aVWe remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience,
p399
aVand figure out why it is meaningful to us,
p400
aVwhy it is significant, why it's colorful,
p401
aVwhen we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense
p402
aVin the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds,
p403
aVwhen we're able to transform Bakers into bakers.
p404
aa(lp405
VThe memory palace, these memory techniques \u2014
p406
aVthey're just shortcuts.
p407
aVIn fact, they're not even really shortcuts.
p408
aVThey work because they make you work.
p409
aVThey force a kind of depth of processing,
p410
aVa kind of mindfulness,
p411
aVthat most of us don't normally walk around exercising.
p412
aVBut there actually are no shortcuts.
p413
aVThis is how stuff is made memorable.
p414
aa(lp415
VAnd I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with,
p416
aVit's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem,
p417
aVleft me with,
p418
aVwhich is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories.
p419
aVHow much are we willing to lose
p420
aVfrom our already short lives,
p421
aVby losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones,
p422
aVby not paying attention to the human being across from us
p423
aVwho is talking with us,
p424
aVby being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply?
p425
aa(lp426
VI learned firsthand
p427
aVthat there are incredible memory capacities
p428
aVlatent in all of us.
p429
aVBut if you want to live a memorable life,
p430
aVyou have to be the kind of person
p431
aVwho remembers to remember.
p432
aa(lp433
VThank you.

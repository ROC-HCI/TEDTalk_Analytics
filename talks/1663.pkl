VSo, I'm an artist.
p5
aVI live in New York, and I've been working in advertising
p6
aVfor \u2014 ever since I left school,
p7
aVso about seven, eight years now,
p8
aVand it was draining.
p9
aVI worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,
p10
aVand I found myself never having time for all the projects
p11
aVthat I wanted to work on on my own.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd one day I was at work and I saw a talk
p14
aVby Stefan Sagmeister on TED,
p15
aVand it was called "The power of time off,"
p16
aVand he spoke about how every seven years,
p17
aVhe takes a year off from work so he could
p18
aVdo his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,
p19
aVand I just said, "I have to do that. I have to take a year off.
p20
aVI need to take time to travel and spend time with my family
p21
aVand start my own creative ideas."
p22
aa(lp23
VSo the first of those projects ended up being
p24
aVsomething I called "One Second Every Day."
p25
aVBasically I'm recording one second of every day of my life
p26
aVfor the rest of my life,
p27
aVchronologically compiling these one-second
p28
aVtiny slices of my life into one single continuous video
p29
aVuntil, you know, I can't record them anymore.
p30
aa(lp31
VThe purpose of this project is, one:
p32
aVI hate not remembering things that I've done in the past.
p33
aVThere's all these things that I've done with my life
p34
aVthat I have no recollection of
p35
aVunless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,
p36
aV"Oh yeah, that's something that I did."
p37
aVAnd something that I realized early on in the project
p38
aVwas that if I wasn't doing anything interesting,
p39
aVI would probably forget to record the video.
p40
aVSo the day \u2014 the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me,
p41
aVbecause it's something that I really wanted to \u2014
p42
aVfrom the moment that I turned 30, I wanted
p43
aVto keep this project going until forever,
p44
aVand having missed that one second, I realized,
p45
aVit just kind of created this thing in my head
p46
aVwhere I never forgot ever again.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo if I live to see 80 years of age,
p49
aVI'm going to have a five-hour video
p50
aVthat encapsulates 50 years of my life.
p51
aVWhen I turn 40, I'll have a one-hour video
p52
aVthat includes just my 30s.
p53
aVThis has really
p54
aVinvigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up,
p55
aVto try and do something interesting with my day.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, one of the things that I have issues with is that,
p58
aVas the days and weeks and months go by,
p59
aVtime just seems to start blurring
p60
aVand blending into each other
p61
aVand, you know, I hated that,
p62
aVand visualization is the way to trigger memory.
p63
aVYou know, this project for me is a way for me
p64
aVto bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.
p65
aVEven just this one second allows me to remember
p66
aVeverything else I did that one day.
p67
aVIt's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.
p68
aVOn a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds
p69
aVthat I really want to choose,
p70
aVbut I'll just have to narrow it down to one,
p71
aVbut even narrowing it down to that one allows me
p72
aVto remember the other three anyway.
p73
aa(lp74
VIt's also kind of a protest, a personal protest,
p75
aVagainst the culture we have now where people
p76
aVjust are at concerts with their cell phones out
p77
aVrecording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you.
p78
aVThey're not even enjoying the show.
p79
aVThey're watching the concert through their cell phone.
p80
aVI hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,
p81
aVback in the day, and I've decided that the best way
p82
aVfor me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life
p83
aVand not be that person, is to just record that one second
p84
aVthat will allow me to trigger that memory of,
p85
aV"Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert."
p86
aVAnd it just takes a quick, quick second.
p87
aa(lp88
VI was on a three-month road trip this summer.
p89
aVIt was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life,
p90
aVjust driving around the U.S. and Canada
p91
aVand just figuring out where to go the next day,
p92
aVand it was kind of outstanding.
p93
aVI actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip
p94
aVfor the savings that I had to take my year off,
p95
aVso I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time
p96
aVwith friends working on a really neat project.
p97
aVOne of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family,
p98
aVand this really tragic thing happened where
p99
aVmy sister-in-law,
p100
aVher intestine suddenly strangled one day,
p101
aVand we took her to the emergency room,
p102
aVand she was, she was in really bad shape.
p103
aVWe almost lost her a couple of times,
p104
aVand I was there with my brother every day.
p105
aVIt helped me realize something else during this project,
p106
aVis that recording that one second on a really bad day
p107
aVis extremely difficult.
p108
aVIt's not \u2014 we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things.
p109
aVOr we're, "Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture."
p110
aVBut we rarely do that when we're having a bad day,
p111
aVand something horrible is happening.
p112
aVAnd I found that it's actually been very, very important
p113
aVto record even just that one second of a really bad moment.
p114
aVIt really helps you appreciate the good times.
p115
aVIt's not always a good day, so when you have a bad one,
p116
aVI think it's important to remember it,
p117
aVjust as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters,
p120
aVI don't use anything to \u2014 I try to capture the moment
p121
aVas much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.
p122
aVI started a rule of first person perspective.
p123
aVEarly on, I think I had a couple of videos where
p124
aVyou would see me in it, but I realized that wasn't the way to go.
p125
aVThe way to really remember what I saw
p126
aVwas to record it as I actually saw it.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are,
p129
aVwouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?
p130
aVI turned 31 last week, which is there.
p131
aVI think it would be interesting to see
p132
aVwhat everyone did with a project like this.
p133
aVI think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.
p134
aVI think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.
p135
aVPersonally, I'm tired of forgetting,
p136
aVand this is a really easy thing to do.
p137
aVI mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now \u2014
p138
aVmost people in this room, I bet \u2014
p139
aVand it's something that's \u2014
p140
aVI never want to forget another day that I've ever lived,
p141
aVand this is my way of doing that,
p142
aVand it'd be really interesting also to see,
p143
aVif you could just type in on a website,
p144
aV"June 18, 2018,"
p145
aVand you would just see a stream of people's lives
p146
aVon that particular day from all over the world.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,
p149
aVand I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day,
p150
aVso you can never forget that that day, you lived.
p151
aa(lp152
VThank you.

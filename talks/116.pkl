VHow many Creationists do we have in the room?
p5
aVProbably none. I think we're all Darwinians.
p6
aVAnd yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy \u2014
p7
aVwould like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes.
p8
aVIt's all right.
p9
aVYou know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution.
p10
aVThe World Wide Web? Not so sure.
p11
aVBeaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no.
p12
aVWhat do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity
p13
aVfrom being themselves, fruits of the tree of life,
p14
aVand hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules?
p15
aVAnd yet people are interestingly resistant
p16
aVto the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking \u2014 to our thinking.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd so I'm going to talk a little bit about that,
p19
aVkeeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.
p20
aVSo you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture,
p21
aVand you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.
p22
aVIt climbs up to the top, and it falls,
p23
aVand it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs \u2014
p24
aVtrying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass.
p25
aVWhat is this ant doing? What is this in aid of?
p26
aVWhat goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass?
p27
aVWhat's in it for the ant?
p28
aVAnd the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.
p29
aVWell then, why is it doing this?
p30
aVIs it just a fluke?
p31
aVYeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke.
p32
aVIt's a little brain worm.
p33
aVIt's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow
p34
aVin order to continue its life cycle.
p35
aVSalmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,
p36
aVand lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant,
p37
aVcrawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.
p38
aVSo there's nothing in it for the ant.
p39
aVThe ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,
p40
aVinducing suicidal behavior.
p41
aVPretty scary.
p42
aa(lp43
VWell, does anything like that happen with human beings?
p44
aVThis is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.
p45
aVWell, it may already have occurred to you
p46
aVthat Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah."
p47
aVWell, it's ideas \u2014 not worms \u2014 that hijack our brains.
p48
aVNow, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population
p49
aVhas had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?
p50
aVNo, it's worse than that.
p51
aVMost people have.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVThere are a lot of ideas to die for.
p54
aVFreedom, if you're from New Hampshire.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVJustice. Truth. Communism.
p57
aVMany people have laid down their lives for communism,
p58
aVand many have laid down their lives for capitalism.
p59
aVAnd many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.
p60
aVThese are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.
p61
aVThey're infectious.
p62
aa(lp63
VYesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about "infectious repititis."
p64
aVIt was a term of abuse, in effect.
p65
aVThis is unthinking engineering.
p66
aVWell, most of the cultural spread that goes on
p67
aVis not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.
p68
aVIt's "infectious repetitis,"
p69
aVand we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens
p70
aVso that we can understand the conditions of infection.
p71
aVHosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.
p72
aVI myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards
p73
aVis that people ask us what the meaning of life is.
p74
aVAnd you have to have a bumper sticker,
p75
aVyou know. You have to have a statement.
p76
aVSo, this is mine.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are
p79
aVand dedicate your life to it.
p80
aVMost of us \u2014 now that the "Me Decade" is well in the past \u2014
p81
aVnow we actually do this.
p82
aVOne set of ideas or another
p83
aVhave simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives.
p84
aVThis is what our summum bonum is.
p85
aVIt's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.
p86
aVNow, this is a profound biological effect.
p87
aVIt's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.
p88
aVAnd no other species does anything at all like it.
p89
aa(lp90
VWell, how are we going to think about this?
p91
aVIt is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.
p92
aVUnmistakable.
p93
aVNow, what theories do we want to use to look at this?
p94
aVWell, many theories. But how could something tie them together?
p95
aVThe idea of replicating ideas;
p96
aVideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.
p97
aVRichard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term "memes,"
p98
aVand put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea
p99
aVin his book "The Selfish Gene."
p100
aVNow here am I talking about his idea.
p101
aVWell, you see, it's not his. Yes \u2014 he started it.
p102
aVBut it's everybody's idea now.
p103
aVAnd he's not responsible for what I say about memes.
p104
aVI'm responsible for what I say about memes.
p105
aa(lp106
VActually, I think we're all responsible
p107
aVfor not just the intended effects of our ideas,
p108
aVbut for their likely misuses.
p109
aVSo it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,
p110
aVthat these ideas not be abused and misused.
p111
aVThey're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.
p112
aVAnd it's just about a full-time job
p113
aVtrying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas
p114
aVfrom caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.
p115
aVSo we have to keep plugging away,
p116
aVtrying to correct the misapprehensions
p117
aVso that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.
p118
aVBut it is a problem.
p119
aVWe don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out,
p120
aVbecause there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo let me just point out: memes are like viruses.
p123
aVThat's what Richard said, back in '93.
p124
aVAnd you might think, "Well, how can that be?
p125
aVI mean, a virus is \u2014 you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?"
p126
aVYesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications
p127
aVbut \u2014 what's a virus?
p128
aVA virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVThat is, there is something about it
p131
aVthat tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.
p132
aVAnd that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.
p133
aVWhat's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?
p134
aVNot silicon.
p135
aVThey're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium.
p136
aVWhat's a word made of?
p137
aVSometimes when people say, "Do memes exist?"
p138
aVI say, "Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?"
p139
aVIf they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.
p140
aa(lp141
VThen there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.
p142
aVThere are different species of memes.
p143
aVRemember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?
p144
aVSimple, beautiful furniture?
p145
aVAnd, of course, they're basically extinct now.
p146
aVAnd one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom
p147
aVis that one should be celibate.
p148
aVNot just the priests. Everybody.
p149
aVWell, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter)
p150
aVBut in fact that's not why they went extinct.
p151
aVThey survived as long as they did
p152
aVat a time when the social safety nets weren't there.
p153
aVAnd there were lots of widows and orphans,
p154
aVpeople like that, who needed a foster home.
p155
aVAnd so they had a ready supply of converts.
p156
aVAnd they could keep it going.
p157
aVAnd, in principle, it could've gone on forever,
p158
aVwith perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts.
p159
aVThe idea being passed on through proselytizing,
p160
aVinstead of through the gene line.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo the ideas can live on in spite of the fact
p163
aVthat they're not being passed on genetically.
p164
aVA meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.
p165
aVAfter all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.
p166
aVThere are other parasites that do this \u2014 which render the host sterile.
p167
aVIt's part of their plan.
p168
aVThey don't have to have minds to have a plan.
p169
aa(lp170
VI'm just going to draw your attention to just one
p171
aVof the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend.
p172
aVI've not time to go into more of it.
p173
aVIn Jared Diamond's wonderful book, "Guns, Germs and Steel,"
p174
aVhe talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,
p175
aVthat conquered the new hemisphere \u2014 the Western hemisphere \u2014
p176
aVthat conquered the rest of the world.
p177
aVWhen European explorers and travelers spread out,
p178
aVthey brought with them the germs
p179
aVthat they had become essentially immune to,
p180
aVthat they had learned how to tolerate over
p181
aVhundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,
p182
aVof living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.
p183
aVAnd they just wiped out \u2014 these pathogens just wiped out the native people,
p184
aVwho had no immunity to them at all.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd we're doing it again.
p187
aVWe're doing it this time with toxic ideas.
p188
aVYesterday, a number of people \u2014 Nicholas Negroponte and others \u2014
p189
aVspoke about all the wonderful things
p190
aVthat are happening when our ideas get spread out,
p191
aVthanks to all the new technology all over the world.
p192
aVAnd I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful.
p193
aVBut among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world
p194
aVthanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas.
p195
aVNow, this has been realized for some time.
p196
aVSayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam,
p197
aVone of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.
p198
aV"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests,
p199
aVballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations." Memes.
p200
aa(lp201
VThese memes are spreading around the world
p202
aVand they are wiping out whole cultures.
p203
aVThey are wiping out languages.
p204
aVThey are wiping out traditions and practices.
p205
aVAnd it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste
p206
aVto people that haven't developed the immunity.
p207
aVWe have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture.
p208
aVWe're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things \u2014 we shrug them off.
p209
aVThey're like a mild cold.
p210
aVThey're not a big deal for us.
p211
aVBut we should recognize that for many people in the world,
p212
aVthey are a big deal.
p213
aVAnd we should be very alert to this.
p214
aVAs we spread our education and our technology,
p215
aVone of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes
p216
aVthat are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes
p217
aVas a dire threat to their favorite memes \u2014
p218
aVthe memes that they are prepared to die for.
p219
aa(lp220
VWell now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes?
p221
aVThat is not the job of the science of memetics.
p222
aVMemetics is morally neutral. And so it should be.
p223
aVThis is not the place for hate and anger.
p224
aVIf you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV.
p225
aVBut the way to deal with that is to do science,
p226
aVand understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.
p227
aa(lp228
VGet the facts.
p229
aVWork out the implications.
p230
aVThere's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts
p231
aVand can figure out the best thing to do.
p232
aVAnd, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.
p233
aVYou will never annihilate the germs.
p234
aVWhat you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like
p235
aVthat will encourage the evolution of avirulence.
p236
aVThat will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations
p237
aVof the most toxic varieties.
p238
aVThat's all the time I have,
p239
aVso thank you very much for your attention.

He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</em></a><em>. </em>Read an excerpt from his 2013 book, <a href=\\"http://geni.us/intuitionpumps\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Intuition Pumps</em></a>, in the <a href=\\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Guardian</em> &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>", "slug": "dan_dennett", "whotheyare": "Dan Dennett argues that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes.", "whatotherssay": "Dan Dennett is our best current philosopher.

"middleinitial": "", "whylisten": "<p>One of our most important living philosophers, Dan Dennett is best known for his provocative and controversial arguments that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes in the brain. He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</em></a><em>. </em>Read an excerpt from his 2013 book, <a href=\\"http://geni.us/intuitionpumps\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Intuition Pumps</em></a>, in the <a href=\\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Guardian</em> &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>", "slug": "dan_dennett", "whotheyare": "Dan Dennett argues that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes.", "whatotherssay": "Dan Dennett is our best current philosopher.

VThank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here
p5
aVsaid they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,
p6
aVbut this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.
p7
aVAnd I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.
p8
aVThere are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VWhat I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories
p12
aVand talk about a different Africa.
p13
aVAlready this morning there were some allusions to the Africa
p14
aVthat you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,
p15
aVthe Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,
p16
aVand the Africa of disasters.
p17
aa(lp18
VWhile it is true that those things are going on,
p19
aVthere's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.
p20
aVAnd sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.
p21
aVThis is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.
p22
aVThis is the Africa of opportunity.
p23
aVThis is the Africa where people want to take charge of
p24
aVtheir own futures and their own destinies.
p25
aVAnd this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships
p26
aVto do this. That's what I want to talk about today.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd I want to start by telling you
p29
aVa story about that change in Africa.
p30
aVOn 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,
p31
aVa governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,
p32
aVwas arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.
p33
aVHe was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars
p34
aVthat went into some dormant accounts
p35
aVthat belonged to him and his family.
p36
aVThis arrest occurred because there was cooperation
p37
aVbetween the London Metropolitan Police
p38
aVand the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria \u2014
p39
aVled by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.
p40
aVAlamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.
p41
aVDue to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman
p42
aVand ran from London back to Nigeria where,
p43
aVaccording to our constitution, those in office
p44
aVas governors, president \u2014 as in many countries \u2014
p45
aVhave immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:
p46
aVpeople were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible
p47
aVfor his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.
p48
aa(lp49
VToday, Alams \u2014 as we call him for short \u2014 is in jail.
p50
aVThis is a story about the fact that people in Africa
p51
aVare no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.
p52
aVThis is a story about the fact that people want their resources
p53
aVmanaged properly for their good, and not taken out to places
p54
aVwhere they'll benefit just a few of the elite.
p55
aVAnd therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa \u2014
p56
aVcorruption all the time \u2014 I want you to know that the people
p57
aVand the governments are trying hard to fight this
p58
aVin some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.
p59
aa(lp60
VDoes it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.
p61
aVThere's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.
p62
aVAnd that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.
p63
aVSo when you hear about corruption,
p64
aVdon't just feel that nothing is being done about this \u2014
p65
aVthat you can't operate in any African country
p66
aVbecause of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.
p67
aVThere's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing
p68
aVand is being won. In others, like mine,
p69
aVwhere there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,
p70
aVthe fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut the truth of the matter is that this is going on.
p73
aVThe results are showing:
p74
aVindependent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations
p75
aVshow that in many instances the trend is downwards
p76
aVin terms of corruption, and governance is improving.
p77
aVA study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed
p78
aVa clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd let me say just one more thing
p81
aVbefore I leave this area of governance.
p82
aVThat is that people talk about corruption, corruption.
p83
aVAll the time when they talk about it
p84
aVyou immediately think about Africa.
p85
aVThat's the image: African countries. But let me say this:
p86
aVif Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London \u2014
p87
aVif the other people who had taken money, estimated at
p88
aV20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies
p89
aVsitting abroad in the developed countries \u2014 if they're able to do this,
p90
aVwhat is that? Is that not corruption?
p91
aVIn this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?
p92
aVSo when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think
p93
aVabout what is happening on the other side of the globe \u2014
p94
aVwhere the money's going and what can be done to stop it.
p95
aVI'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,
p96
aVon asset recovery, trying to do what we can
p97
aVto get the monies that have been taken abroad \u2014
p98
aVdeveloping countries' moneys \u2014 to get that sent back.
p99
aVBecause if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,
p100
aVit may be far more for some of these countries
p101
aVthan all the aid that is being put together.
p102
aV(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VThe second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.
p105
aVAfricans, after \u2014 they're tired, we're tired
p106
aVof being the subject of everybody's charity and care.
p107
aVWe are grateful, but we know that
p108
aVwe can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.
p109
aVAnd what is happening in many African countries now is a realization
p110
aVthat no one can do it but us. We have to do it.
p111
aVWe can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.
p112
aVWe have to reform our economies, change our leadership,
p113
aVbecome more democratic, be more open to change and to information.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd this is what we started to do
p116
aVin one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.
p117
aVIn fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.
p118
aVI want to tell you that.
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aVOne in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,
p121
aVand it has 140 million dynamic people \u2014 chaotic people \u2014
p122
aVbut very interesting people. You'll never be bored.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VWhat we started to do was to realize
p126
aVthat we had to take charge and reform ourselves.
p127
aVAnd with the support of a leader
p128
aVwho was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,
p129
aVwe put forward a comprehensive reform program,
p130
aVwhich we developed ourselves.
p131
aVNot the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,
p132
aVwhere I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.
p133
aVNo one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
p134
aa(lp135
VWe put together a program that would, one: get the state
p136
aVout of businesses it had nothing \u2014 it had no business being in.
p137
aVThe state should not be in the business
p138
aVof producing goods and services
p139
aVbecause it's inefficient and incompetent.
p140
aVSo we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.
p141
aV(Applause)
p142
aVWe \u2014 as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.
p143
aVCan you believe that prior to this reform \u2014
p144
aVwhich started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington
p145
aVto go and take up the post of Finance Minister \u2014
p146
aVwe had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop
p147
aV4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VHaving a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.
p151
aVYou couldn't get it. You had to bribe.
p152
aVYou had to do everything to get your phone.
p153
aVWhen President Obasanjo supported and launched
p154
aVthe liberalization of the telecommunications sector,
p155
aVwe went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.
p156
aVNigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,
p157
aVafter China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year
p158
aVin telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VThe smartest one, first to come in,
p162
aVwas the MTN company of South Africa.
p163
aVAnd in the three years that I was Finance Minister,
p164
aVthey made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.
p165
aV360 million in a market \u2014 in a country that is a poor country,
p166
aVwith an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.
p167
aVSo the market is there.
p168
aVWhen they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.
p169
aVNigerians themselves began to develop
p170
aVsome wireless telecommunications companies,
p171
aVand three or four others have come in.
p172
aVBut there's a huge market out there,
p173
aVand people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.
p174
aVSo privatization is one of the things we've done.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.
p177
aVBecause nobody's going to help you and support you
p178
aVif you're not managing your own finances well.
p179
aVAnd Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation
p180
aVof being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.
p181
aVSo what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule
p182
aVthat de-linked our budget from the oil price.
p183
aVBefore we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,
p184
aVbecause oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector
p185
aVin the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.
p186
aVWe de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget
p187
aVat a price slightly lower than the oil price
p188
aVand save whatever was above that price.
p189
aVWe didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.
p190
aVBut what it immediately did was that the volatility
p191
aVthat had been present in terms of our economic development \u2014
p192
aVwhere, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.
p193
aVWhen they crashed, we crashed.
p194
aVAnd we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.
p195
aVThat smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,
p196
aV27 billion dollars. Whereas \u2014 and this went to our reserves \u2014
p197
aVwhen I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.
p198
aVBy the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And
p199
aVas we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves
p200
aVdue to proper management of our finances.
p201
aVAnd that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
p202
aa(lp203
VOur exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time
p204
aVis now fairly stable and being managed so that business people
p205
aVhave a predictability of prices in the economy.
p206
aVWe brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.
p207
aVAnd we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade
p208
aVto about 6.5 percent now.
p209
aVSo all the changes and reforms we were able to make
p210
aVhave shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd what is more important, because we want to get away from oil
p213
aVand diversify \u2014 and there are so many opportunities
p214
aVin this one big country, as in many countries in Africa \u2014
p215
aVwhat was remarkable is that much of this growth came
p216
aVnot from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.
p217
aVAgriculture grew at better than eight percent.
p218
aVAs telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,
p219
aVand I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that
p220
aVonce you get the macro-economy straightened out,
p221
aVthe opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.
p222
aa(lp223
VWe have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.
p224
aVWe have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals
p225
aVthat no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized
p226
aVthat without the proper legislation to make that possible,
p227
aVthat wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code
p228
aVthat is comparable with some of the best in the world.
p229
aVWe have opportunities in housing and real estate.
p230
aVThere was nothing in a country of 140 million people \u2014
p231
aVno shopping malls as you know them here.
p232
aVThis was an investment opportunity for someone
p233
aVthat excited the imagination of people.
p234
aVAnd now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall
p235
aVare doing four times the turnover that they had projected.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo, huge things in construction, real estate,
p238
aVmortgage markets. Financial services:
p239
aVwe had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.
p240
aVWe consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring
p241
aVthat they increase their capital \u2014 share capital.
p242
aVAnd it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.
p243
aVThe banks \u2014 these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening
p244
aVof the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.
p245
aVBarclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.
p246
aVStandard Chartered has brought in 140 million.
p247
aVAnd I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.
p248
aa(lp249
VWe are doing the same with the insurance sector.
p250
aVSo in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.
p251
aVIn tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.
p252
aVAnd that's what many people know East Africa for:
p253
aVthe wildlife, the elephants, and so on.
p254
aVBut managing the tourism market in a way
p255
aVthat can really benefit the people is very important.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you
p258
aVthat there's a new wave on the continent.
p259
aVA new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,
p260
aVmore than two-thirds of African countries have had
p261
aVmulti-party democratic elections.
p262
aVNot all of them have been perfect, or will be,
p263
aVbut the trend is very clear.
p264
aVI'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,
p265
aVthe average rate of growth on the continent has moved
p266
aVfrom about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.
p267
aVThis is better than the performance of many OECD countries.
p268
aVSo it's clear that things are changing.
p269
aa(lp270
VConflicts are down on the continent;
p271
aVfrom about 12 conflicts a decade ago,
p272
aVwe are down to three or four conflicts \u2014
p273
aVone of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.
p274
aVAnd, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where
p275
aVif something is going on in one part of the continent,
p276
aVit looks like the entire continent is affected.
p277
aVBut you should know that this continent is not \u2014
p278
aVis a continent of many countries, not one country.
p279
aVAnd if we are down to three or four conflicts,
p280
aVit means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest
p281
aVin stable, growing, exciting economies
p282
aVwhere there's plenty of opportunity.
p283
aVAnd I want to just make one point about this investment.
p284
aa(lp285
VThe best way to help Africans today
p286
aVis to help them to stand on their own feet.
p287
aVAnd the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.
p288
aVThere's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that
p289
aVand saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.
p290
aVBut imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed
p291
aVand make sure that their children go to school,
p292
aVthat they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.
p293
aVIf we can invest in places where you yourselves make money
p294
aVwhilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,
p295
aVisn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?
p296
aVAnd I want to say that some of the best people to invest in
p297
aVon the continent are the women.
p298
aV(Applause)
p299
aa(lp300
VI have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.
p301
aVOtherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.
p302
aVIt says, "Africa: Open for Business."
p303
aVAnd this is a video that has actually won an award
p304
aVas the best documentary of the year.
p305
aVUnderstand that the woman who made it
p306
aVis going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.
p307
aVBut it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who
p308
aVagainst all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.
p309
aa(lp310
VOne of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,
p311
aVmaking children's clothes \u2014
p312
aVwhich she started as a hobby and grew into a business.
p313
aVMixing African materials, such as we have,
p314
aVwith materials from elsewhere.
p315
aVSo, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,
p316
aVwith African material mixed in. Very creative designs,
p317
aVhas reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVFor 10,000 pieces.
p320
aVSo that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.
p323
aVI could go on giving examples:
p324
aVBeatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business
p325
aVand is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning
p326
aVand is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.
p327
aVHowever, many of these are starved for capital to expand,
p328
aVbecause nobody believes outside of our countries
p329
aVthat we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.
p330
aVNobody thinks there's opportunity.
p331
aVBut I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,
p332
aVwill miss it forever.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.
p335
aVThink about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,
p336
aVwho are doing incredible things, that are bringing them
p337
aVinto the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure
p338
aVthat their fellow men and women are employed,
p339
aVand that the children in those households get educated
p340
aVbecause their parents are earning adequate income.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo I invite you to explore the opportunities.
p343
aVWhen you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,
p344
aVbecause I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be
p345
aVfor you to get involved in something that will do good
p346
aVfor the continent, for the people and for yourselves.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you very much.
p349
aV(Applause)

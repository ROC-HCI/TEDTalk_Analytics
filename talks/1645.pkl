VI'd like to share with you
p5
aVthe story of one of my patients called Celine.
p6
aa(lp7
VCeline is a housewife and lives in a rural district
p8
aVof Cameroon in west Central Africa.
p9
aVSix years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis,
p10
aVshe was recruited to participate in the clinical trial
p11
aVwhich was running in her health district at the time.
p12
aVWhen I first met Celine, a little over a year ago,
p13
aVshe had gone for 18 months
p14
aVwithout any antiretroviral therapy,
p15
aVand she was very ill.
p16
aVShe told me that she stopped coming to the clinic
p17
aVwhen the trial ended
p18
aVbecause she had no money for the bus fare
p19
aVand was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance.
p20
aVNow during the clinical trial,
p21
aVshe'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge,
p22
aVand her transportation costs
p23
aVhad been covered by the research funds.
p24
aVAll of these ended once the trial was completed,
p25
aVleaving Celine with no alternatives.
p26
aVShe was unable to tell me the names of the drugs
p27
aVshe'd received during the trial,
p28
aVor even what the trial had been about.
p29
aVI didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were
p30
aVbecause it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue.
p31
aVYet what puzzled me most
p32
aVwas Celine had given her informed consent
p33
aVto be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand
p34
aVthe implications of being a participant
p35
aVor what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, I have shared this story with you as an example
p38
aVof what can happen to participants in the clinical trial
p39
aVwhen it is poorly conducted.
p40
aVMaybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.
p41
aVMaybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.
p42
aVMaybe it would inform clinicians around the world
p43
aVon how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.
p44
aVBut it would have done so at a price
p45
aVto hundreds of patients who, like Celine,
p46
aVwere left to their own devices
p47
aVonce the research had been completed.
p48
aa(lp49
VI do not stand here today to suggest in any way
p50
aVthat conducting HIV clinical trials
p51
aVin developing countries is bad.
p52
aVOn the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools,
p53
aVand are much needed to address the burden
p54
aVof disease in developing countries.
p55
aVHowever, the inequalities that exist between
p56
aVricher countries and developing countries in terms of funding
p57
aVpose a real risk for exploitation,
p58
aVespecially in the context of externally-funded research.
p59
aVSadly enough, the fact remains that
p60
aVa lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries
p61
aVcould never be authorized in the richer countries
p62
aVwhich fund the research.
p63
aa(lp64
VI'm sure you must be asking yourselves
p65
aVwhat makes developing countries,
p66
aVespecially those in sub-Saharan Africa,
p67
aVso attractive for these HIV clinical trials?
p68
aVWell, in order for a clinical trial to generate
p69
aVvalid and widely applicable results,
p70
aVthey need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants
p71
aVand preferably on a population
p72
aVwith a high incidence of new HIV infections.
p73
aVSub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description,
p74
aVwith 22 million people living with HIV,
p75
aVan estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people
p76
aVwho are infected worldwide.
p77
aVAlso, research within the continent
p78
aVis a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty,
p79
aVendemic diseases and inadequate health care systems.
p80
aVA clinical trial that is considered to be
p81
aVpotentially beneficial to the population
p82
aVis more likely to be authorized,
p83
aVand in the absence of good health care systems,
p84
aValmost any offer of medical assistance
p85
aVis accepted as better than nothing.
p86
aVEven more problematic reasons include
p87
aVlower risk of litigation,
p88
aVless rigorous ethical reviews,
p89
aVand populations that are willing to participate
p90
aVin almost any study that hints at a cure.
p91
aVAs funding for HIV research
p92
aVincreases in developing countries
p93
aVand ethical review in richer countries become more strict,
p94
aVyou can see why this context becomes
p95
aVvery, very attractive.
p96
aa(lp97
VThe high prevalence of HIV drives researchers
p98
aVto conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable
p99
aVbut on many levels ethically questionable.
p100
aVHow then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure,
p101
aVwe do not take an unfair advantage
p102
aVof those who are already most affected by the pandemic?
p103
aVI invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on
p104
aVin order to improve the way in which things are done.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe first of these is informed consent.
p107
aVNow, in order for a clinical trial to be
p108
aVconsidered ethically acceptable,
p109
aVparticipants must be given the relevant information
p110
aVin a way in which they can understand,
p111
aVand must freely consent to participate in the trial.
p112
aVThis is especially important in developing countries,
p113
aVwhere a lot of participants consent to research
p114
aVbecause they believe it is the only way in which
p115
aVthey can receive medical care or other benefits.
p116
aVConsent procedures that are used in richer countries
p117
aVare often inappropriate or ineffective
p118
aVin a lot of developing countries.
p119
aVFor example, it is counterintuitive to have
p120
aVan illiterate study participant, like Celine,
p121
aVsign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read,
p122
aVlet alone understand.
p123
aVLocal communities need to be more involved
p124
aVin establishing the criteria for recruiting participants
p125
aVin clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.
p126
aVThe information in these trials
p127
aVneeds to be given to the potential participants
p128
aVin linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.
p129
aa(lp130
VThe second point I would like for you to consider
p131
aVis the standard of care that is provided
p132
aVto participants within any clinical trial.
p133
aVNow, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.
p134
aVShould the control group in the clinical trial
p135
aVbe given the best current treatment which is available
p136
aVanywhere in the world?
p137
aVOr should they be given an alternative standard of care,
p138
aVsuch as the best current treatment available
p139
aVin the country in which the research is being conducted?
p140
aVIs it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen
p141
aVwhich may not be affordable or accessible
p142
aVto the study participants once the research has been completed?
p143
aVNow, in a situation where the best current treatment
p144
aVis inexpensive and simple to deliver,
p145
aVthe answer is straightforward.
p146
aVHowever, the best current treatment available
p147
aVanywhere in the world is often very difficult
p148
aVto provide in developing countries.
p149
aVIt is important to assess the potential risks and benefits
p150
aVof the standard of care which is to be provided
p151
aVto participants in any clinical trial,
p152
aVand establish one which is relevant for the context of the study
p153
aVand most beneficial for the participants within the study.
p154
aa(lp155
VThat brings us to the third point I want you think about:
p156
aVthe ethical review of research.
p157
aVAn effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability
p158
aVof clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants
p159
aVwithin any clinical trial.
p160
aVUnfortunately, this is often lacking
p161
aVor inefficient in a lot of developing countries.
p162
aVLocal governments need to set up effective systems
p163
aVfor reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials
p164
aVwhich are authorized in different developing countries,
p165
aVand they need to do this by setting up
p166
aVethical review committees that are independent
p167
aVof the government and research sponsors.
p168
aVPublic accountability needs to be promoted
p169
aVthrough transparency and independent review
p170
aVby nongovernmental and international organizations
p171
aVas appropriate.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe final point I would like for you to consider tonight
p174
aVis what happens to participants in the clinical trial
p175
aVonce the research has been completed.
p176
aVI think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin
p177
aVin the first place without a clear plan
p178
aVfor what would happen to the participants
p179
aVonce the trial has ended.
p180
aVNow, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that
p181
aVan intervention that has been shown to be beneficial
p182
aVduring a clinical trial
p183
aVis accessible to the participants of the trial
p184
aVonce the trial has been completed.
p185
aVIn addition, they should be able to consider the possibility
p186
aVof introducing and maintaining effective treatments
p187
aVin the wider community once the trial ends.
p188
aVIf, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible,
p189
aVthen I think they should have to ethically justify
p190
aVwhy the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow, fortunately for Celine,
p193
aVour meeting did not end in my office.
p194
aVI was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program
p195
aVcloser to her home,
p196
aVand with a support group to help her cope.
p197
aVHer story has a positive ending,
p198
aVbut there are thousands of others in similar situations
p199
aVwho are much less fortunate.
p200
aa(lp201
VAlthough she may not know this,
p202
aVmy encounter with Celine has completely changed the way
p203
aVin which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries,
p204
aVand made me even more determined to be part of the movement
p205
aVto change the way in which things are done.
p206
aa(lp207
VI believe that every single person
p208
aVlistening to me tonight can be part of that change.
p209
aVIf you are a researcher, I hold you
p210
aVto a higher standard of moral conscience,
p211
aVto remain ethical in your research,
p212
aVand not compromise human welfare in your search for answers.
p213
aVIf you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company,
p214
aVI challenge you to hold your employers
p215
aVto fund research that is ethically sound.
p216
aVIf you come from a developing country like myself,
p217
aVI urge you to hold your government
p218
aVto a more thorough review of the clinical trials
p219
aVwhich are authorized in your country.
p220
aVYes, there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV,
p221
aVto find an effective vaccine for malaria,
p222
aVto find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B.,
p223
aVbut I believe that we owe it to those who willingly
p224
aVand selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials
p225
aVto do this in a humane way.
p226
aa(lp227
VThank you.

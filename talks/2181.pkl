VSo infectious diseases, right?
p5
aVInfectious diseases  are still the main cause
p6
aVof human suffering and death  around the world.
p7
aVEvery year, millions of people die of diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV,
p8
aVaround the world  and even in the United States.
p9
aVEvery year, thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu.
p10
aa(lp11
VNow of course, humans, we are creative. Right?
p12
aVWe have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases.
p13
aVWe have drugs and vaccines.
p14
aVAnd we're conscious \u2014 we learn from our experiences
p15
aVand come up with creative solutions.
p16
aVWe used to think we're alone in this, but now we know we're not.
p17
aVWe're not the only medical doctors.
p18
aVNow we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it too.
p19
aVMost famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.
p20
aVNot so much different from us,
p21
aVthey can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites.
p22
aVBut the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too:
p23
aVelephants, porcupines, sheep, goats, you name it.
p24
aVAnd even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us
p25
aVthat insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe problem with infectious diseases, as we all know,
p28
aVis that pathogens continue to evolve,
p29
aVand a lot of the drugs that we have developed
p30
aVare losing their efficacy.
p31
aVAnd therefore, there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs
p32
aVthat we can use against our diseases.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, I think that we should look at these animals,
p35
aVand we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases.
p36
aVAs a biologist, I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.
p37
aVNow, monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations
p38
aVfrom the U.S. and Canada down to Mexico every year,
p39
aVwhere millions of them come together,
p40
aVbut it's not why I started studying them.
p41
aVI study monarchs because they get sick.
p42
aVThey get sick like you. They get sick like me.
p43
aVAnd I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs
p44
aVthat we can develop for humans.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, the parasites that monarchs get infected with
p47
aVare called ophryocystis elektroscirrha \u2014 a mouthful.
p48
aVWhat they do is they produce spores,
p49
aVmillions of spores on the outside of the butterfly
p50
aVthat are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly.
p51
aVAnd this is really detrimental to the monarch.
p52
aVIt shortens their lifespan,
p53
aVit reduces their ability to fly,
p54
aVit can even kill them before they're even adults.
p55
aVVery detrimental parasite.
p56
aa(lp57
VAs part of my job, I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants,
p58
aVand the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters.
p59
aVThey only eat milkweed as larvae.
p60
aVLuckily, there are several species of milkweed that they can use,
p61
aVand all these milkweeds have cardenolides in them.
p62
aVThese are chemicals that are toxic.
p63
aVThey're toxic to most animals, but not to monarchs.
p64
aVIn fact, monarchs can take up the chemicals,
p65
aVput it in their own bodies, and it makes them toxic
p66
aVagainst their predators, such as birds.
p67
aVAnd what they do, then, is advertise this toxicity
p68
aVthrough their beautiful warning colorations
p69
aVwith this orange, black and white.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse,
p72
aVdifferent ones, different milkweeds.
p73
aVSome were toxic, including the tropical milkweed,
p74
aVwith very high concentrations of these cardenolides.
p75
aVAnd some were not toxic.
p76
aVAnd then I fed them to monarchs.
p77
aVSome of the monarchs were healthy. They had no disease.
p78
aVBut some of the monarchs were sick,
p79
aVand what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal,
p80
aVmeaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies,
p81
aVmeaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected
p82
aVwhen feeding on these medicinal plants.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd when I found this, I had this idea,
p85
aVand a lot of people said it was a crazy idea,
p86
aVbut I thought,  what if monarchs can use this?
p87
aVWhat if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine?
p88
aVWhat if they can act as medical doctors?
p89
aa(lp90
VSo my team and I started doing experiments.
p91
aVIn the first types of experiments,
p92
aVwe had caterpillars, and gave them a choice:
p93
aVmedicinal milkweed versus non-medicinal milkweed.
p94
aVAnd then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime.
p95
aVAnd the result, as so often  in science, was boring:
p96
aVFifty percent of their food was medicinal. Fifty percent was not.
p97
aVThese caterpillars didn't do anything for their own welfare.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo then we moved on to adult butterflies,
p100
aVand we started asking the question
p101
aVwhether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring.
p102
aVCan the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed
p103
aVthat will make their future offspring less sick?
p104
aVWe have done these experiments now over several years,
p105
aVand always get the same results.
p106
aVWhat we do is we put a monarch in a big cage,
p107
aVa medicinal plant on one side, a non-medicinal plant on the other side,
p108
aVand then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant.
p109
aVAnd what we find when we do that is always the same.
p110
aVWhat we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.
p111
aVIn other words, what these females are doing
p112
aVis they're laying 68 percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.
p113
aVIntriguingly, what they do is they actually transmit the parasites
p114
aVwhen they're laying the eggs.
p115
aVThey cannot prevent this.
p116
aVThey can also not medicate themselves.
p117
aVBut what these experiments tell us
p118
aVis that these monarchs, these mothers, can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed
p119
aVthat will make their future offspring less sick.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, this is a really important discovery, I think,
p122
aVnot just because it tells us something cool about nature,
p123
aVbut also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs.
p124
aVNow, these are animals that are very small
p125
aVand we tend to think of them as very simple.
p126
aVThey have tiny little brains,
p127
aVyet they can do this very sophisticated medication.
p128
aVNow, we know that even today, most of our drugs
p129
aVderive from natural products, including plants,
p130
aVand in indigenous cultures,
p131
aVtraditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs.
p132
aVIn this way, elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset,
p133
aVand porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea.
p134
aVWhat I think is important,  though, is to move beyond
p135
aVthese large-brained mammals and give these guys more credit,
p136
aVthese simple animals, these insects that we tend to think of
p137
aVas very, very simple with tiny little brains.
p138
aVThe discovery that these animals can also use medication
p139
aVopens up completely new avenues,
p140
aVand I think that maybe one day, we will be treating human diseases
p141
aVwith drugs that were first discovered by butterflies,
p142
aVand I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing.
p143
aa(lp144
VThank you so much.

In what ways are hosts able to self-medicate in order to make themselves less desirable to parasites? And are the abilities to harm hosts &mdash; and the ability of hosts to self-medicate &mdash; favored by natural selection?</p> <p>The De Roode Lab focuses on the monarch butterfly and its parasites. The team has made a fascinating discovery: that female butterflies infected by a parasite choose to lay their eggs on a specific variety of milkweed that helps their offspring avoid getting sick.

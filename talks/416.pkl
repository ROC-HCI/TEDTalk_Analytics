VWhat I'd like you to do is, just really quickly,
p5
aVis just, sort of, nod to the person on your right,
p6
aVand then nod to the person on your left.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVNow, chances are that over the last winter,
p9
aVif you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people
p10
aVyou just nodded at would have died.
p11
aVNow, that's an awful lot of bees.
p12
aVAnd this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent
p13
aVof the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, that's a lot, a lot of bees, and that's really important.
p16
aVAnd most of those losses are because of things we know.
p17
aVWe know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced
p18
aVand caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon,
p19
aVwhich I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.
p20
aVAnd here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.
p21
aVAnd below, you can see all these out yards,
p22
aVor temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,
p23
aVand then they're shipped out to the almonds.
p24
aVAnd one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months
p25
aVafter I was here, described this not as beehives
p26
aVbut as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences
p29
aVto say that we have been trying to figure out
p30
aVwhat the cause of this is.
p31
aVAnd what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.
p32
aVAnd this flu has wiped through the population of bees.
p33
aVIn some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year,
p34
aVthis flu was caused by a new virus to us,
p35
aVor newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.
p36
aVIt was called that because a guy in Israel first found it,
p37
aVand he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because,
p38
aVof course, there's the implication.
p39
aVBut we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.
p40
aVIt's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses
p41
aVor other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,
p42
aVand the question that keeps us up at night,
p43
aVis why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu,
p44
aVand why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?
p45
aVAnd we don't have the answer to that yet,
p46
aVand we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.
p47
aVWe think perhaps it's a combination of factors.
p48
aVWe know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team
p49
aVthat, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides
p50
aVin the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives
p51
aVhave the most pesticides. And so we discover all these
p52
aVvery strange things that we can't begin to understand.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.
p55
aVNow of course, if you lose a lot of colonies,
p56
aVbeekeepers can replace them very quickly.
p57
aVAnd that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.
p58
aVIf we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know,
p59
aVthe National Guard would be out.
p60
aVBut what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,
p61
aVthey can split that colony in two.
p62
aVAnd then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.
p63
aVIt comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida,
p64
aVand you can introduce that queen.
p65
aVAnd in fact, America was the first country
p66
aVthat ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact,
p67
aVit's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail
p68
aVin order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.
p69
aVIf you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually,
p70
aVa three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course,
p71
aVthe Postal Office is always very concerned when they get,
p72
aVyou know, your three-pound packages of bees.
p73
aVAnd you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.
p74
aVSo it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs,
p75
aVand so they've been able to cover those losses.
p76
aVSo even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year,
p77
aVthe same number of colonies have existed in the country,
p78
aVat about 2.4 million colonies.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, those losses are tragic on many fronts,
p81
aVand one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.
p82
aVAnd it's really important to talk about beekeepers first,
p83
aVbecause beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.
p84
aVIf this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone
p85
aVfrom the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die,
p86
aVto the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco
p87
aVbackyard pig farmer.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVAnd you get all of these people in the same room,
p90
aVand they're all engaged and they're getting along,
p91
aVand they're all there because of the passion for bees.
p92
aVNow, there's another part of that community
p93
aVwhich are the commercial beekeepers,
p94
aVthe ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.
p95
aVAnd these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious,
p96
aVintuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.
p97
aVThey're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.
p98
aa(lp99
VI had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year.
p100
aVAnd Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.
p101
aVI mean, there may be 100 explanations
p102
aVfor why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is,
p103
aVbut there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.
p104
aVBut you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here,
p105
aVand he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.
p106
aVNo formal education, but very knowledgeable.
p107
aVWe needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable,
p108
aVhe was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen
p109
aVfrom cow dung, tin cans and his veil, which he used as a screening,
p110
aVright in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring.
p111
aa(lp112
VWe also have Dave Hackenberg, who is the poster child of CCD.
p113
aVHe's the one who first identified this condition
p114
aVand raised the alarm bells.
p115
aVAnd he has a history of these trucks,
p116
aVand he's moved these bees up and down the coast.
p117
aVAnd a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees,
p118
aVand that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.
p119
aVThe ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts,
p120
aVso this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.
p121
aVAnd one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder
p122
aVis the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.
p123
aVAnd you can do that one year in a row,
p124
aVyou may be able to do it two years in a row.
p125
aVBut if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies,
p126
aVyou can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried
p127
aVabout losing this segment of our industry.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd that's important for many fronts,
p130
aVand one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture.
p131
aVAnd these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America.
p132
aVYou know, they pick up their hives;
p133
aVthey move their families once or twice in a year.
p134
aVAnd if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida,
p135
aVthat's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.
p136
aVAnd then 20 miles down the road is Groveland,
p137
aVand that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.
p138
aVAnd if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café
p139
aVat 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.
p140
aVAnd that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees
p141
aVinto the almond groves.
p142
aVThey all have their breakfast
p143
aVand complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience,
p144
aVand I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time,
p145
aVbecause that's quite essential American experience.
p146
aVAnd we see these families, these nomadic families, you know,
p147
aVfather to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.
p148
aVAnd they're not people who like to ask for help,
p149
aValthough they are the most helpful people ever.
p150
aVIf there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul,
p151
aVeveryone pitches in and gives 20 hives
p152
aVto help him replace those lost colonies.
p153
aVAnd so, it's a very dynamic, and I think,
p154
aVhistoric and exciting community to be involved with.
p155
aa(lp156
VOf course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.
p157
aVAnd although I highly encourage you, all use honey.
p158
aVI mean, it's the most ethical sweetener,
p159
aVand you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.
p160
aVBut we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat
p161
aVis directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees.
p162
aVNow, I want to just illustrate that in the fact
p163
aVthat if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning \u2014
p164
aVa little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola,
p165
aVI should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know,
p166
aVjam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee \u2014
p167
aVand had we taken out all those ingredients,
p168
aV\u2014 except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola \u2014
p169
aVif we had taken out all those ingredients
p170
aVthe bees had indirectly or directly pollinated,
p171
aVwe wouldn't have much on our plate.
p172
aVSo if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve,
p173
aVbut clearly our diet would be diminished.
p174
aVIt's said that for bees, the flower is the fountain of life,
p175
aVand for flowers bees are the messengers of love.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd that's a really great expression, because really,
p178
aVbees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know \u2014
p179
aVthey get paid for their services.
p180
aVThey get paid by pollen and nectar,
p181
aVto move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower.
p182
aVAnd there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't \u2014
p183
aVthe pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.
p184
aVSo in an apple orchard, for instance, you'll have rows of 10 apples
p185
aVof one variety, and then you have another apple tree
p186
aVthat's a different type of pollen.
p187
aVAnd bees are very faithful.
p188
aVWhen they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower,
p189
aVthey stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.
p190
aVAnd of course, they're made to carry this pollen.
p191
aVThey build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them
p192
aVand helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom.
p193
aa(lp194
VHowever, honeybees are a minority.
p195
aVHoneybees are not native to America; they were introduced
p196
aVwith the colonialists.
p197
aVAnd there are actually more species of bees
p198
aVthan there are mammals and birds combined.
p199
aVIn Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,
p200
aVand very intensely in the last three years.
p201
aVWe have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.
p202
aVThirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.
p203
aVNow, that could be because we haven't been sampling right,
p204
aVbut it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong
p205
aVwith the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating.
p206
aa(lp207
VWe have bumblebees on the top.
p208
aVAnd bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social,
p209
aVbecause only the queen is, over winter.
p210
aVWe also have the sweat bees, and these are little gems flying around.
p211
aVThey're like tiny little flies and they fly around.
p212
aVAnd then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites,
p213
aVwhich is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering \u2014
p214
aVwhat's the word I'm looking for? Murdering \u2014
p215
aVAudience: Bee?
p216
aVDennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.
p217
aV(Laughter)
p218
aVWhat these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees,
p219
aVthey drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch,
p220
aVand they collect pollen and make it into a ball,
p221
aVand they lay an egg on it.
p222
aVWell, these bees hang out at that hole,
p223
aVand they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg,
p224
aVand lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.
p225
aVAnd so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees,
p226
aVyou know that your environment is healthy,
p227
aVbecause they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.
p228
aVAnd in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators
p229
aVthat we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list
p230
aVare a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.
p231
aVAnd in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast,
p232
aVgo to these websites here, and they're really looking for people
p233
aVto look for some of these bumblebees, because we think
p234
aVsome have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble,
p237
aVbut we don't understand these native pollinators
p238
aVor all those other parts of our community.
p239
aVAnd of course, bees are not the only important factor here.
p240
aVThere are other animals that pollinate, like bats,
p241
aVand bats are in trouble too.
p242
aVAnd I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man,
p243
aVbecause there's no money to research the bat problems.
p244
aVAnd bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.
p245
aVWhite-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats.
p246
aVIf there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it,
p247
aVand there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco
p248
aVbecoming the population of half of this county in three years.
p249
aVAnd so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause
p252
aVof all these conditions, and that cause is NDD:
p253
aVNature Deficit Disorder.
p254
aVAnd that is that I think that what we have in our society is,
p255
aVwe forgot our connection with nature.
p256
aVAnd I think if we reconnect to nature,
p257
aVwe'll be able to have the resources and that interest
p258
aVto solve these problems.
p259
aVAnd I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.
p260
aVAnd that is, make meadows and not lawns.
p261
aVAnd I think we have lost our connection,
p262
aVand this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.
p263
aVI've had the privilege of living by a meadow
p264
aVfor the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.
p265
aVAnd if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.
p266
aVIt used to be, two, three hundred years ago,
p267
aVthat a lawn was a symbol of prestige,
p268
aVand so it was only the very rich that could keep these green
p269
aVactually, deserts: they're totally sterile.
p270
aVAmericans spent, in 2001 \u2014 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.
p271
aVFive percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent
p274
aVkeeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.
p275
aVAnd so we need to rethink this idea.
p276
aVIn fact, you know, the White House
p277
aVused to have sheep in front in order to help fund
p278
aVthe war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea;
p279
aVit wouldn't be a bad idea.
p280
aVI want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns.
p281
aVI think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns
p282
aVat a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.
p283
aVBut I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here,
p284
aVbecause having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.
p285
aVThat it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.
p286
aVThese milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow
p287
aVover the last four years. Add to watch the different plants,
p288
aVor insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that \u2014
p289
aVand we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine,
p290
aVthis companion you can have as it matures
p291
aVand as it has these different fragrances.
p292
aVAnd this is a companion,
p293
aVand this is a relationship that never dries up.
p294
aVYou never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.
p295
aVAnd I encourage you to look at that.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow, not all of us have meadows,
p298
aVor lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course,
p299
aVgrow a meadow in a pot.
p300
aVBees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.
p301
aVSo I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot,
p302
aVbut a pot in a meadow.
p303
aVBut you can also have this great community of city
p304
aVor building-top beekeepers, these beekeepers that live \u2014
p305
aVThis is in Paris where these beekeepers live.
p306
aVAnd everyone should open a beehive,
p307
aVbecause it is the most amazing, incredible thing.
p308
aVAnd if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder,
p309
aVI think this is a great way of doing it.
p310
aVGet a beehive and grow a meadow,
p311
aVand watch that life come back into your life.
p312
aVAnd so with that, I think that what we can do, if we do this,
p313
aVwe can make sure that our future \u2014 our more perfect future \u2014
p314
aVincludes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows.
p315
aVAnd that journey \u2014 that journey of transformation that occurs
p316
aVas you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees
p317
aVor you watch those native bees there \u2014 is an extremely exciting one.
p318
aVAnd I hope that you experience it
p319
aVand I hope you tell me about it one day.
p320
aVSo thank you very much for being here.  Thank you very much.

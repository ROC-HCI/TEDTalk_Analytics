VI want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history
p5
aVin 18 minutes.
p6
aVThat's 300 million years per minute.
p7
aVLet's start with the first photograph NASA obtained
p8
aVof planet Mars.
p9
aVThis is fly-by, Mariner IV.
p10
aVIt was taken in 1965.
p11
aVWhen this picture appeared,
p12
aVthat well-known scientific journal,
p13
aVThe New York Times, wrote in its editorial,
p14
aV"Mars is uninteresting.
p15
aVIt's a dead world. NASA should not spend
p16
aVany time or effort studying Mars anymore."
p17
aVFortunately, our leaders in Washington
p18
aVat NASA headquarters knew better
p19
aVand we began a very extensive study
p20
aVof the red planet.
p21
aa(lp22
VOne of the key questions in all of science,
p23
aV"Is there life outside of Earth?"
p24
aVI believe that Mars is the most likely target
p25
aVfor life outside the Earth.
p26
aVI'm going to show you in a few minutes
p27
aVsome amazing measurements that suggest
p28
aVthere may be life on Mars.
p29
aVBut let me start with a Viking photograph.
p30
aVThis is a composite taken by Viking in 1976.
p31
aVViking was developed and managed at the
p32
aVNASA Langley Research Center.
p33
aVWe sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976.
p34
aVWe had four spacecraft, two around Mars,
p35
aVtwo on the surface \u2014
p36
aVan amazing accomplishment.
p37
aa(lp38
VThis is the first photograph taken from
p39
aVthe surface of any planet.
p40
aVThis is a Viking Lander photograph
p41
aVof the surface of Mars.
p42
aVAnd yes, the red planet is red.
p43
aVMars is half the size of the Earth,
p44
aVbut because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water,
p45
aVthe land area on Mars
p46
aVis comparable to the land area on Earth.
p47
aVSo, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size.
p48
aVWe have obtained topographic measurements
p49
aVof the surface of Mars. We understand
p50
aVthe elevation differences.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe know a lot about Mars.
p53
aVMars has the largest volcano in the solar system,
p54
aVOlympus Mons.
p55
aVMars has the Grand Canyon
p56
aVof the solar system, Valles Marineris.
p57
aVVery, very interesting planet.
p58
aVMars has the largest
p59
aVimpact crater in the solar system,
p60
aVHellas Basin.
p61
aVThis is 2,000 miles across.
p62
aVIf you happened to be on Mars
p63
aVwhen this impactor hit,
p64
aVit was a really bad day on Mars.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVThis is Olympus Mons.
p67
aVThis is bigger than the state of Arizona.
p68
aa(lp69
VVolcanoes are important, because volcanoes
p70
aVproduce atmospheres and they produce oceans.
p71
aVWe're looking at Valles Marineris,
p72
aVthe largest canyon in the solar system,
p73
aVsuperimposed on a map of the United States,
p74
aV3,000 miles across.
p75
aVOne of the most intriguing features about Mars,
p76
aVthe National Academy of Science says
p77
aVone of the 10 major mysteries of the space age,
p78
aVis why certain areas of Mars
p79
aVare so highly magnetized.
p80
aVWe call this crustal magnetism.
p81
aVThere are regions on Mars, where, for some reason \u2014
p82
aVwe don't understand why at this point \u2014
p83
aVthe surface is very, very highly magnetized.
p84
aa(lp85
VIs there water on Mars?
p86
aVThe answer is no, there is no liquid water
p87
aVon the surface of Mars today.
p88
aVBut there is intriguing evidence
p89
aVthat suggests that the early history of Mars
p90
aVthere may have been rivers
p91
aVand fast flowing water.
p92
aVToday Mars is very very dry.
p93
aVWe believe there's some water in the polar caps,
p94
aVthere are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.
p95
aVHere are some recent images.
p96
aVThis is from Spirit and Opportunity.
p97
aVThese images that show at one time,
p98
aVthere was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars.
p99
aVWhy is water important? Water is important
p100
aVbecause if you want life you have to have water.
p101
aVWater is the key ingredient
p102
aVin the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.
p103
aa(lp104
VHere is some picture of Antarctica
p105
aVand a picture of Olympus Mons,
p106
aVvery similar features, glaciers.
p107
aVSo, this is frozen water.
p108
aVThis is ice water on Mars.
p109
aVThis is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago.
p110
aVIt has not been seen publicly.
p111
aVThis is European space agency
p112
aVMars Express, image of a crater on Mars
p113
aVand in the middle of the crater
p114
aVwe have liquid water, we have ice.
p115
aVVery intriguing photograph.
p116
aa(lp117
VWe now believe that in the early history of Mars,
p118
aVwhich is 4.6 billion years ago,
p119
aV4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like.
p120
aVMars had rivers, Mars had lakes,
p121
aVbut more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.
p122
aVWe believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere,
p123
aVand this area in blue,
p124
aVwhich shows a depression of about four miles,
p125
aVwas the ancient ocean area
p126
aVon the surface of Mars.
p127
aVWhere did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?
p128
aVWell, we have an idea.
p129
aVThis is a measurement we obtained a few years ago
p130
aVfrom a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey.
p131
aVSub-surface water on Mars,
p132
aVfrozen in the form of ice.
p133
aVAnd this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color,
p134
aVit means 16 percent by weight.
p135
aVSixteen percent, by weight, of the interior
p136
aVcontains frozen water, or ice.
p137
aVSo, there is a lot of water below the surface.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe most intriguing and puzzling measurement,
p140
aVin my opinion, we've obtained of Mars,
p141
aVwas released earlier this year
p142
aVin the magazine Science.
p143
aVAnd what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane,
p144
aVCH4, in the atmosphere of Mars.
p145
aVAnd you can see there are three distinct regions of methane.
p146
aVWhy is methane important?
p147
aVBecause on Earth, almost all \u2014
p148
aV99.9 percent \u2014 of the methane
p149
aVis produced by living systems,
p150
aVnot little green men, but microscopic life
p151
aVbelow the surface or at the surface.
p152
aVWe now have evidence
p153
aVthat methane is in the atmosphere of Mars,
p154
aVa gas that, on Earth,
p155
aVis biogenic in origin,
p156
aVproduced by living systems.
p157
aVThese are the three plumes: A, B1, B2.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd this is the terrain it appears over,
p160
aVand we know from geological studies
p161
aVthat these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.
p162
aVIn fact, the Earth and Mars
p163
aVare both 4.6 billion years old.
p164
aVThe oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.
p165
aVThe reason there is a billion-year gap
p166
aVin our geological understanding
p167
aVis because of plate tectonics,
p168
aVThe crust of the Earth has been recycled.
p169
aVWe have no geological record prior
p170
aVfor the first billion years.
p171
aVThat record exists on Mars.
p172
aVAnd this terrain that we're looking at
p173
aVdates back to 4.6 billion years
p174
aVwhen Earth and Mars were formed.
p175
aVIt was a Tuesday.
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VThis is a map that shows
p179
aVwhere we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars.
p180
aVHere is Viking I, Viking II.
p181
aVThis is Opportunity. This is Spirit.
p182
aVThis is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix,
p183
aVwe just put two years ago.
p184
aVNotice all of our rovers and all of our landers
p185
aVhave gone to the northern hemisphere.
p186
aVThat's because the northern hemisphere
p187
aVis the region of the ancient
p188
aVocean basin.
p189
aVThere aren't many craters.
p190
aVAnd that's because the water protected the basin
p191
aVfrom being impacted by asteroids and meteorites.
p192
aVBut look in the southern hemisphere.
p193
aVIn the southern hemisphere there are impact craters,
p194
aVthere are volcanic craters.
p195
aVHere's Hellas Basin,
p196
aVa very very different place, geologically.
p197
aVLook where the methane is, the methane is in a very
p198
aVrough terrain area.
p199
aa(lp200
VWhat is the best way to unravel
p201
aVthe mysteries on Mars that exist?
p202
aVWe asked this question 10 years ago.
p203
aVWe invited 10 of the top Mars scientists
p204
aVto the Langley Research Center for two days.
p205
aVWe addressed on the board
p206
aVthe major questions that have not been answered.
p207
aVAnd we spent two days deciding
p208
aVhow to best answer this question.
p209
aVAnd the result of our meeting
p210
aVwas a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.
p211
aVIt's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.
p212
aVThere's a model of ARES here.
p213
aVThis is a 20-percent scale model.
p214
aa(lp215
VThis airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center.
p216
aVIf any place in the world
p217
aVcan build an airplane to fly on Mars,
p218
aVit's the Langley Research Center,
p219
aVfor almost 100 years
p220
aVa leading center of aeronautics in the world.
p221
aVWe fly about a mile above the surface.
p222
aVWe cover hundreds of miles,
p223
aVand we fly about 450 miles an hour.
p224
aVWe can do things that rovers can't do
p225
aVand landers can't do:
p226
aVWe can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters;
p227
aVwe fly over valleys;
p228
aVwe can fly over surface magnetism,
p229
aVthe polar caps, subsurface water;
p230
aVand we can search for life on Mars.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut, of equal importance,
p233
aVas we fly through the atmosphere of Mars,
p234
aVwe transmit that journey,
p235
aVthe first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth,
p236
aVwe transmit those images back to Earth.
p237
aVAnd our goal is to inspire the American public
p238
aVwho is paying for this mission through tax dollars.
p239
aVBut more important we will
p240
aVinspire the next generation of scientists,
p241
aVtechnologists, engineers and mathematicians.
p242
aVAnd that's a critical area of national security
p243
aVand economic vitality, to make sure
p244
aVwe produce the next generation
p245
aVof scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.
p246
aa(lp247
VThis is what ARES looks like
p248
aVas it flies over Mars.
p249
aVWe preprogram it.
p250
aVWe will fly where the methane is.
p251
aVWe will have instruments aboard the plane
p252
aVthat will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars.
p253
aVWe will look for methane
p254
aVas well as other gasses
p255
aVproduced by living systems.
p256
aVWe will pinpoint where these gases emanate from,
p257
aVbecause we can measure the gradient where it comes from,
p258
aVand there, we can direct the next mission
p259
aVto land right in that area.
p260
aa(lp261
VHow do we transport an airplane to Mars?
p262
aVIn two words, very carefully.
p263
aVThe problem is we don't fly it to Mars,
p264
aVwe put it in a spacecraft
p265
aVand we send it to Mars.
p266
aVThe problem is the spacecraft's
p267
aVlargest diameter is nine feet;
p268
aVARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.
p269
aVHow do we get it to Mars?
p270
aVWe fold it,
p271
aVand we transport it in a spacecraft.
p272
aVAnd we have it in something called an aeroshell.
p273
aVThis is how we do it.
p274
aVAnd we have a little video that describes the sequence.
p275
aa(lp276
VVideo: Seven, six. Green board. Five, four, three, two, one.
p277
aVMain engine start, and liftoff.
p278
aa(lp279
VJoel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
p280
aVThis is the spacecraft taking nine months
p281
aVto get to Mars.
p282
aVIt enters the atmosphere of Mars.
p283
aVA lot of heating,
p284
aVfrictional heating. It's going 18 thousand miles an hour.
p285
aVA parachute opens up to slow it down.
p286
aVThe thermal tiles fall off.
p287
aVThe airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time.
p288
aVIt unfolds.
p289
aVThe rocket engine begins.
p290
aa(lp291
VWe believe that in a one-hour flight
p292
aVwe can rewrite the textbook on Mars
p293
aVby making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere,
p294
aVlooking for gases of biogenic origin,
p295
aVlooking for gases of volcanic origin,
p296
aVstudying the surface, studying the magnetism
p297
aVon the surface, which we don't understand,
p298
aVas well as about a dozen other areas.
p299
aa(lp300
VPractice makes perfect.
p301
aVHow do we know we can do it?
p302
aVBecause we have tested ARES model,
p303
aVseveral models in a half a dozen wind tunnels
p304
aVat the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years,
p305
aVunder Mars conditions.
p306
aVAnd, of equal importance
p307
aVis, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere,
p308
aVat 100,000 feet,
p309
aVwhich is comparable to the density and pressure
p310
aVof the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly.
p311
aVNow, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles,
p312
aVyou fly 37,000 feet.
p313
aVWe do our tests at 100,000 feet.
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd I want to show you one of our tests.
p316
aVThis is a half-scale model.
p317
aVThis is a high-altitude helium balloon.
p318
aVThis is over Tilamook, Oregon.
p319
aVWe put the folded airplane on the balloon \u2014
p320
aVit took about three hours to get up there \u2014
p321
aVand then we released it on command
p322
aVat 103,000 feet,
p323
aVand we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.
p324
aVAnd we've done
p325
aVhigh-altitude and low-altitude tests,
p326
aVjust to perfect this technique.
p327
aa(lp328
VWe're ready to go.
p329
aVI have a scale model here.
p330
aVBut we have a full-scale model
p331
aVin storage at the NASA Langley Research Center.
p332
aVWe're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters
p333
aV(Laughter)
p334
aVto cover the costs.
p335
aVI'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk
p336
aVfor this mission.
p337
aVThere's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing.
p338
aVThis is the ARES team;
p339
aVwe have about 150 scientists, engineers;
p340
aVwhere we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
p341
aVGoddard Space Flight Center,
p342
aVAmes Research Center and half a dozen major universities
p343
aVand corporations in developing this.
p344
aa(lp345
VIt's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center.
p346
aVAnd let me conclude by saying
p347
aVnot too far from here,
p348
aVright down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina,
p349
aVa little more than 100 years ago
p350
aVhistory was made
p351
aVwhen we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth.
p352
aVWe are on the verge right now
p353
aVto make the first flight of an airplane
p354
aVoutside the Earth's atmosphere.
p355
aVWe are prepared to fly this on Mars,
p356
aVrewrite the textbook about Mars.
p357
aVIf you're interested in more information,
p358
aVwe have a website that describes this exciting
p359
aVand intriguing mission, and why we want to do it.
p360
aVThank you very much.

ARES (Aerial Regional-scale  Environmental Survey) is a robotic, rocket-powered  Mars airplane designed to investigate the atmosphere, surface and  sub-surface of Mars.</p><p>In his research, he studies the atmospheres of Earth and Mars, tracking their development and changes: How similar are they? What can Earth learn from Mars? </p><p>His work as an atmospheric scientist had an interesting sideline, as he wrote in <a href=\\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/robotics/careercorner/Joel_Levine.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">this Q&amp;A for students</a>: &nbsp; </p><p>From 1998 to 2001, at the request of the National Archives and Records  Administration in Washington, D.C., I formed and led a team of NASA  scientists to solve the mystery of why tiny white spots were forming in  the hermetically sealed encasements containing the Declaration of  Independence, the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Using  noninvasive techniques that were originally developed to measure trace  gases in Earth&#39;s atmosphere, we solved the problem. We measured very  high concentrations of water vapor in the hermetically sealed  encasements. The high concentrations of water vapor chemically reacted  with the glass encasements, causing the leaching out of alkaline  material from the glass, resulting in the formation of the mysterious  white spots. The situation was corrected in 2001, when personnel at the  National Archives and Records Administration removed the documents from  the original encasements, put them in brand-new encasements and put them  back on display at the National Archives. This was a unique opportunity  to apply NASA-developed technology to solve a non-aerospace problem of  great national interest and concern -- the preservation of the founding  documents of the United States of America!&nbsp; </p>", "slug": "joel_levine", "whotheyare": "Joel Levine studies the atmospheres of Earth and Mars, looking at their origin, evolution, structure and chemistry and climate change.

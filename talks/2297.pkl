VIt was the middle of summer and well past closing time
p5
aVin the downtown Berkeley bar where my friend Polly and I
p6
aVworked together as bartenders.
p7
aVUsually at the end of our shift we had a drink \u2014 but not that night.
p8
aV"I'm pregnant.
p9
aVNot sure what I'm going to do yet," I told Polly.
p10
aVWithout hesitation, she replied, "I've had an abortion."
p11
aVBefore Polly, no one had ever told me that she'd had an abortion.
p12
aVI'd graduated from college just a few months earlier
p13
aVand I was in a new relationship when I found out that I was pregnant.
p14
aVWhen I thought about my choices, I honestly did not know how to decide,
p15
aVwhat criteria I should use.
p16
aVHow would I know what the right decision was?
p17
aVI worried that I would regret  an abortion later.
p18
aVComing of age on the beaches of Southern California,
p19
aVI grew up in the middle of  our nation's abortion wars.
p20
aVI was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Roe vs. Wade.
p21
aVOur community was surfing Christians.
p22
aVWe cared about God, the less fortunate, and the ocean.
p23
aVEveryone was pro-life.
p24
aVAs a kid, the idea of abortion made me so sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant
p25
aVI could never have one.
p26
aVAnd then I did.
p27
aVIt was a step towards the unknown.
p28
aVBut Polly had given me a very special gift:
p29
aVthe knowledge that I wasn't alone
p30
aVand the realization that abortion was something that we can talk about.
p31
aVAbortion is common.
p32
aVAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, one in three women in America
p33
aVwill have an abortion in their lifetime.
p34
aVBut for the last few decades, the dialogue around abortion in the United States
p35
aVhas left little room for anything beyond  pro-life and pro-choice.
p36
aVIt's political and polarizing.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut as much as abortion is hotly debated, it's still rare for us,
p39
aVwhether as fellow women or even just as fellow people,
p40
aVto talk with one another about the abortions that we have.
p41
aVThere is a gap.
p42
aVBetween what happens in politics and what happens in real life,
p43
aVand in that gap, a battlefield mentality.
p44
aVAn "are you with us  or against us?" stance takes root.
p45
aVThis isn't just about abortion.
p46
aVThere are so many important issues  that we can't talk about.
p47
aVAnd so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation
p48
aVis the work of my life.
p49
aVThere are two main ways to get started.
p50
aVOne way is to listen closely.
p51
aVAnd the other way is to share stories.
p52
aVSo, 15 years ago, I cofounded an organization called Exhale
p53
aVto start listening to people  who have had abortions.
p54
aVThe first thing we did was create  a talk-line, where women and men
p55
aVcould call to get emotional support.
p56
aVFree of judgment and politics, believe it or not, nothing like our sevice
p57
aVhad ever existed.
p58
aVWe needed a new framework that could  hold all the experiences that we were
p59
aVhearing on our talk-line.
p60
aVThe feminist who regrets her abortion.
p61
aVThe Catholic who is grateful for hers.
p62
aVThe personal experiences that weren't  fitting neatly into one box or the other.
p63
aVWe didn't think it was right  to ask women to pick a side.
p64
aVWe wanted to show them that the whole world was on their side,
p65
aVas they were going through this deeply personal experience.
p66
aVSo we invented "pro-voice."
p67
aa(lp68
VBeyond abortion, pro-voice works on hard issues that we've struggled with globally
p69
aVfor years,
p70
aVissues like immigration, religious tolerance, violence against women.
p71
aVIt also works on deeply personal topics  that might only matter to you
p72
aVand your immediate family and friends.
p73
aVThey have a terminal illness,  their mother just died,
p74
aVthey have a child with special needs and they can't talk about it.
p75
aVListening and storytelling are the hallmarks of pro-voice practice.
p76
aVListening and storytelling.
p77
aVThat sounds pretty nice.
p78
aVSounds maybe, easy? We could all do that.
p79
aVIt's not easy. It's very hard.
p80
aVPro-voice is hard because we are talking about things everyone's fighting about
p81
aVor the things that no one  wants to talk about.
p82
aVI wish I could tell you that when you  decide to be pro-voice, that you'll find
p83
aVbeautiful moments of breakthrough  and gardens full of flowers,
p84
aVwhere listening and storytelling creates wonderful "a-ha" moments.
p85
aVI wish I could tell you that there would be a feminist welcoming party for you,
p86
aVor that there's a long-lost sisterhood of people who are just ready
p87
aVto have your back when you get slammed.
p88
aVBut it can be vulnerable and exhausting  to tell our own stories
p89
aVwhen it feels like nobody cares.
p90
aVAnd if we truly listen to one another,
p91
aVwe will hear things that demand that we shift our own perceptions.
p92
aVThere is no perfect time and there is no perfect place
p93
aVto start a difficult conversation.
p94
aVThere's never a time when everyone will be on the same page, share the same lens,
p95
aVor know the same history.
p96
aVSo, let's talk about listening and how to be a good listener.
p97
aVThere's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple.
p98
aVOne is to ask open-ended questions.
p99
aVYou can ask yourself or someone  that you know,
p100
aV"How are you feeling?"
p101
aV"What was that like?"
p102
aV"What do you hope for, now?"
p103
aVAnother way to be a good listener  is to use reflective language.
p104
aVIf someone is talking about their own personal experience,
p105
aVuse the words that they use.
p106
aVIf someone is talking about an abortion and they say the word "baby,"
p107
aVyou can say "baby."
p108
aVIf they say "fetus," you can say "fetus."
p109
aVIf someone describes themselves as gender queer to you,
p110
aVyou can say "gender queer."
p111
aVIf someone kind of looks like a he, but they say they're a she \u2014 it's cool.
p112
aVCall that person a she.
p113
aVWhen we reflect the language of the person who is sharing their own story,
p114
aVwe are conveying that we are interested in understanding who they are
p115
aVand what they're going through.
p116
aVThe same way that we hope people are  interested in knowing us.
p117
aVSo, I'll never forget being in one  of the Exhale counselor meetings,
p118
aVlistening to a volunteer talk about how she was getting a lot of calls
p119
aVfrom Christian women who  were talking about God.
p120
aVNow, some of our volunteers are religious, but this particular one was not.
p121
aVAt first, it felt a little weird for her  to talk to callers about God.
p122
aVSo, she decided to get comfortable.
p123
aVAnd she stood in front of her mirror  at home, and she said the word "God."
p124
aV"God."
p125
aV"God."
p126
aV"God."
p127
aV"God."
p128
aV"God."
p129
aV"God."
p130
aVOver and over and over again until the word no longer felt strange
p131
aVcoming out her mouth.
p132
aVSaying the word God did not turn this  volunteer into a Christian,
p133
aVbut it did make her a much  better listener of Christian women.
p134
aVSo, another way to be pro-voice is to share stories,
p135
aVand one risk that you take on, when you share your story with someone else,
p136
aVis that given the same set of circumstances as you
p137
aVthey might actually make a different decision.
p138
aVFor example, if you're telling a story  about your abortion,
p139
aVrealize that she might have had the baby.
p140
aVShe might have placed for adoption.
p141
aVShe might have told her parents  and her partner \u2014 or not.
p142
aVShe might have felt relief and confidence, even though you felt sad and lost.
p143
aVThis is okay.
p144
aVEmpathy gets created the moment we imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes.
p145
aVIt doesn't mean we all have  to end up in the same place.
p146
aVIt's not agreement, it's not sameness that pro-voice is after.
p147
aVIt creates a culture and a society that  values what make us special and unique.
p148
aVIt values what makes us human, our flaws and our imperfections.
p149
aVAnd this way of thinking allows us to see our differences with respect,
p150
aVinstead of fear.
p151
aVAnd it generates the empathy that we need
p152
aVto overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another.
p153
aVStigma, shame, prejudice,  discrimination, oppression.
p154
aVPro-voice is contagious, and the more it's practiced
p155
aVthe more it spreads.
p156
aVSo, last year I was pregnant again.
p157
aVThis time I was looking forward  to the birth of my son.
p158
aVAnd while pregnant, I had never been asked how I was feeling so much in all my life.
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aVAnd however I replied, whether I was feeling wonderful and excited
p161
aVor scared and totally freaked out,
p162
aVthere was always someone there giving me a "been there" response.
p163
aVIt was awesome.
p164
aVIt was a welcome, yet dramatic departure from what I experience
p165
aVwhen I talk about my mixed feelings of my abortion.
p166
aVPro-voice is about the real stories of real people
p167
aVmaking an impact on the way abortion
p168
aVand so many other politicized and stigmatized issues
p169
aVare understood and discussed.
p170
aVFrom sexuality and mental health to poverty and incarceration.
p171
aVFar beyond definition as single right or wrong decisions,
p172
aVour experiences can exist on a spectrum.
p173
aVPro-voice focuses that conversation on human experience
p174
aVand it makes support and respect possible for all.
p175
aVThank you.

So she cofounded&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://exhaleprovoice.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Exhale</a>, a nonprofit that offers women and men emotional support after an abortion, free of judgment and politics. After being constantly asked to pick a side in the abortion conflict, Baker and her cofounders started a new conversation. <br /><br />Leaving the black-and-white debate behind, they embraced the gray areas and personal stories hidden behind the fight. They invented &ldquo;pro-voice,&rdquo; a philosophy and practice that uses listening and storytelling to help people have respectful, compassionate exchanges about abortion, and many other controversial topics.

VThe kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do
p5
aVis almost like the weatherman.
p6
aVWe are always chasing storms.
p7
aVWe want to see and measure storms \u2014 brainstorms, that is.
p8
aVAnd we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives,
p9
aVbut we rarely see or listen to one.
p10
aVSo I always like to start these talks
p11
aVby actually introducing you to one of them.
p12
aa(lp13
VActually, the first time we recorded more than one neuron \u2014
p14
aVa hundred brain cells simultaneously \u2014
p15
aVwe could measure the electrical sparks
p16
aVof a hundred cells in the same animal,
p17
aVthis is the first image we got,
p18
aVthe first 10 seconds of this recording.
p19
aVSo we got a little snippet of a thought,
p20
aVand we could see it in front of us.
p21
aa(lp22
VI always tell the students
p23
aVthat we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer,
p24
aVbecause we are dealing with a system
p25
aVthat is only comparable in terms of number of cells
p26
aVto the number of galaxies that we have in the universe.
p27
aVAnd here we are, out of billions of neurons,
p28
aVjust recording, 10 years ago, a hundred.
p29
aVWe are doing a thousand now.
p30
aVAnd we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature.
p31
aVBecause, if you don't know yet,
p32
aVeverything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms,
p33
aVcomes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains
p34
aVand define our memories, our beliefs,
p35
aVour feelings, our plans for the future.
p36
aVEverything that we ever do,
p37
aVeverything that every human has ever done, do or will do,
p38
aVrequires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd the sound of a brainstorm, if you've never heard one,
p41
aVis somewhat like this.
p42
aVYou can put it louder if you can.
p43
aVMy son calls this "making popcorn while listening to a badly-tuned A.M. station."
p44
aVThis is a brain.
p45
aVThis is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker
p46
aVand you listen to a hundred brain cells firing,
p47
aVyour brain will sound like this \u2014 my brain, any brain.
p48
aVAnd what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time
p49
aVis to actually listen to these symphonies, these brain symphonies,
p50
aVand try to extract from them the messages they carry.
p51
aa(lp52
VIn particular, about 12 years ago
p53
aVwe created a preparation that we named brain-machine interfaces.
p54
aVAnd you have a scheme here that describes how it works.
p55
aVThe idea is, let's have some sensors that listen to these storms, this electrical firing,
p56
aVand see if you can, in the same time that it takes
p57
aVfor this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal \u2014
p58
aVabout half a second \u2014
p59
aVlet's see if we can read these signals,
p60
aVextract the motor messages that are embedded in it,
p61
aVtranslate it into digital commands
p62
aVand send it to an artificial device
p63
aVthat will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time.
p64
aVAnd see if we can measure how well we can translate that message
p65
aVwhen we compare to the way the body does that.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd if we can actually provide feedback,
p68
aVsensory signals that go back from this robotic, mechanical, computational actuator
p69
aVthat is now under the control of the brain,
p70
aVback to the brain,
p71
aVhow the brain deals with that,
p72
aVof receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd that's exactly what we did 10 years ago.
p75
aVWe started with a superstar monkey called Aurora
p76
aVthat became one of the superstars of this field.
p77
aVAnd Aurora liked to play video games.
p78
aVAs you can see here,
p79
aVshe likes to use a joystick, like any one of us, any of our kids, to play this game.
p80
aVAnd as a good primate, she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer.
p81
aVSo even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross
p82
aVwith the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick,
p83
aVAurora is trying to find the target, no matter where it is.
p84
aVAnd if she's doing that,
p85
aVbecause every time she crosses that target with the little cursor,
p86
aVshe gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice.
p87
aVAnd I can tell you, any monkey will do anything for you
p88
aVif you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice.
p89
aVActually any primate will do that.
p90
aVThink about that.
p91
aa(lp92
VWell, while Aurora was playing this game, as you saw,
p93
aVand doing a thousand trials a day
p94
aVand getting 97 percent correct and 350 milliliters of orange juice,
p95
aVwe are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head
p96
aVand sending them to a robotic arm
p97
aVthat was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making.
p98
aVBecause the idea was to actually turn on this brain-machine interface
p99
aVand have Aurora play the game just by thinking,
p100
aVwithout interference of her body.
p101
aVHer brainstorms would control an arm
p102
aVthat would move the cursor and cross the target.
p103
aVAnd to our shock, that's exactly what Aurora did.
p104
aVShe played the game without moving her body.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo every trajectory that you see of the cursor now,
p107
aVthis is the exact first moment she got that.
p108
aVThat's the exact first moment
p109
aVa brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate
p110
aVand could act outside, in that outside world,
p111
aVjust by controlling an artificial device.
p112
aVAnd Aurora kept playing the game, kept finding the little target
p113
aVand getting the orange juice that she wanted to get, that she craved for.
p114
aa(lp115
VWell, she did that because she, at that time, had acquired a new arm.
p116
aVThe robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later,
p117
aVafter the first video that I showed to you,
p118
aVis under the control of Aurora's brain
p119
aVand is moving the cursor to get to the target.
p120
aVAnd Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm,
p121
aVbut she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases.
p122
aVShe can scratch her back, she can scratch one of us, she can play another game.
p123
aVBy all purposes and means,
p124
aVAurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device
p125
aVas an extension of her body.
p126
aVThe model of the self that Aurora had in her mind
p127
aVhas been expanded to get one more arm.
p128
aa(lp129
VWell, we did that 10 years ago.
p130
aVJust fast forward 10 years.
p131
aVJust last year we realized that you don't even need to have a robotic device.
p132
aVYou can just build a computational body, an avatar, a monkey avatar.
p133
aVAnd you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them,
p134
aVor you can train them to assume in a virtual world
p135
aVthe first-person perspective of that avatar
p136
aVand use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar's arms or legs.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd what we did basically was to train the animals
p139
aVto learn how to control these avatars
p140
aVand explore objects that appear in the virtual world.
p141
aVAnd these objects are visually identical,
p142
aVbut when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects,
p143
aVthey send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object
p144
aVthat goes back directly to the monkey's brain,
p145
aVinforming the brain what it is the avatar is touching.
p146
aVAnd in just four weeks, the brain learns to process this new sensation
p147
aVand acquires a new sensory pathway \u2014 like a new sense.
p148
aVAnd you truly liberate the brain now
p149
aVbecause you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar.
p150
aVAnd the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain
p151
aVwithout the interference of the skin.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo what you see here is this is the design of the task.
p154
aVYou're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets.
p155
aVAnd he has to select one because only one carries the reward,
p156
aVthe orange juice that they want to get.
p157
aVAnd he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm, an arm that doesn't exist.
p158
aVAnd that's exactly what they do.
p159
aa(lp160
VThis is a complete liberation of the brain
p161
aVfrom the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task.
p162
aVThe animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets.
p163
aVAnd he's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain.
p164
aVAnd the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward.
p165
aVThe legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey.
p166
aVAnd by the way, they don't read English anyway,
p167
aVso they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position.
p168
aVAnd yet, they can find them by tactile discrimination,
p169
aVand they can press it and select it.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo when we look at the brains of these animals,
p172
aVon the top panel you see the alignment of 125 cells
p173
aVshowing what happens with the brain activity, the electrical storms,
p174
aVof this sample of neurons in the brain
p175
aVwhen the animal is using a joystick.
p176
aVAnd that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows.
p177
aVThe basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions.
p178
aVThe bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving
p179
aVand the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar.
p180
aVAs fast as we can reset our computers,
p181
aVthe brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool,
p182
aVas if this too was a part of that primate's body.
p183
aVThe brain is assimilating that too, as fast as we can measure.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo that suggests to us that our sense of self
p186
aVdoes not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies,
p187
aVbut it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains.
p188
aVOur violins, our cars, our bicycles, our soccer balls, our clothing \u2014
p189
aVthey all become assimilated by this voracious, amazing, dynamic system called the brain.
p190
aa(lp191
VHow far can we take it?
p192
aVWell, in an experiment that we ran a few years ago, we took this to the limit.
p193
aVWe had an animal running on a treadmill
p194
aVat Duke University on the East Coast of the United States,
p195
aVproducing the brainstorms necessary to move.
p196
aVAnd we had a robotic device, a humanoid robot,
p197
aVin Kyoto, Japan at ATR Laboratories
p198
aVthat was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain,
p199
aVa human brain, or a primate brain.
p200
aa(lp201
VWhat happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey
p202
aVwas transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk
p203
aVwhile footage of this walking was sent back to Duke,
p204
aVso that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her.
p205
aVSo she could be rewarded, not by what her body was doing
p206
aVbut for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet
p207
aVcontrolled by her brain activity.
p208
aa(lp209
VFunny thing, that round trip around the globe took 20 milliseconds less
p210
aVthan it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head, the head of the monkey,
p211
aVand reach its own muscle.
p212
aVThe monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger, across the planet.
p213
aVThis is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously.
p214
aVThis is CB1 fulfilling its dream in Japan
p215
aVunder the control of the brain activity of a primate.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo where are we taking all this?
p218
aVWhat are we going to do with all this research,
p219
aVbesides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears?
p220
aVWell the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology
p221
aVand try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world.
p222
aVMillions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms
p223
aVinto action, into movement.
p224
aVAlthough their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements,
p225
aVthey cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo our idea is to create a bypass,
p228
aVis to use these brain-machine interfaces to read these signals,
p229
aVlarger-scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again,
p230
aVbypass the lesion using computational microengineering
p231
aVand send it to a new body, a whole body called an exoskeleton,
p232
aVa whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd you can see an image produced by this consortium.
p235
aVThis is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project
p236
aVthat is putting together scientists from Europe,
p237
aVfrom here in the United States, and in Brazil
p238
aVtogether to work to actually get this new body built \u2014
p239
aVa body that we believe, through the same plastic mechanisms
p240
aVthat allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain-machine interface
p241
aVand that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life.
p242
aVThis same mechanism, we hope, will allow these patients,
p243
aVnot only to imagine again the movements that they want to make
p244
aVand translate them into movements of this new body,
p245
aVbut for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo I was told about 10 years ago
p248
aVthat this would never happen, that this was close to impossible.
p249
aVAnd I can only tell you that as a scientist,
p250
aVI grew up in southern Brazil in the mid-'60s
p251
aVwatching a few crazy guys telling [us] that they would go to the Moon.
p252
aVAnd I was five years old,
p253
aVand I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job;
p254
aVafter all, they were very proficient \u2014
p255
aVbut just seeing that as a kid
p256
aVmade me believe, as my grandmother used to tell me,
p257
aVthat "impossible is just the possible
p258
aVthat someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true."
p259
aa(lp260
VSo they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk.
p261
aVI think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice.
p262
aa(lp263
VThank you.

population coding, Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI) and neuroprosthetics  in human patients and non-human primates.His lab&#39;s work was seen, famously though a bit too briefly, when a brain-controlled exoskeleton from his lab helped Juliano Pinto, a paraplegic man, kick the first ball at the 2014 World Cup.</p><p>But his lab is thinking even bigger. They&#39;ve developed an  integrative approach to studying neurological disorders,  including Parkinsons disease and epilepsy. The approach, they hope, will allow the integration of molecular,  cellular, systems and behavioral data in the same animal, producing a  more complete understanding of the nature of the neurophysiological  alterations associated with these disorders.

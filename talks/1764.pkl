VSo what does it mean for a machine to be athletic?
p5
aVWe will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism
p6
aVand the research to achieve it
p7
aVwith the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters,
p8
aVor quads, for short.
p9
aa(lp10
VQuads have been around for a long time.
p11
aVThey're so popular these days because they're mechanically simple.
p12
aVBy controlling the speeds of these four propellers,
p13
aVthese machines can roll, pitch, yaw,
p14
aVand accelerate along their common orientation.
p15
aVOn board are also a battery, a computer,
p16
aVvarious sensors and wireless radios.
p17
aa(lp18
VQuads are extremely agile, but this agility comes at a cost.
p19
aVThey are inherently unstable,
p20
aVand they need some form of automatic feedback control
p21
aVin order to be able to fly.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, how did it just do that?
p24
aVCameras on the ceiling and a laptop
p25
aVserve as an indoor global positioning system.
p26
aVIt's used to locate objects in the space
p27
aVthat have these reflective markers on them.
p28
aVThis data is then sent to another laptop
p29
aVthat is running estimation and control algorithms,
p30
aVwhich in turn sends commands to the quad,
p31
aVwhich is also running estimation and control algorithms.
p32
aVThe bulk of our research is algorithms.
p33
aVIt's the magic that brings these machines to life.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete?
p36
aVWe use something broadly called model-based design.
p37
aVWe first capture the physics
p38
aVwith a mathematical model of how the machines behave.
p39
aVWe then use a branch of mathematics called control theory
p40
aVto analyze these models
p41
aVand also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them.
p42
aVFor example, that's how we can make the quad hover.
p43
aVWe first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations.
p44
aVWe then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory
p45
aVto create algorithms that stabilize the quad.
p46
aa(lp47
VLet me demonstrate the strength of this approach.
p48
aVSuppose that we want this quad to not only hover
p49
aVbut to also balance this pole.
p50
aVWith a little bit of practice,
p51
aVit's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this,
p52
aValthough we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground
p53
aVand the use of our very versatile hands.
p54
aVIt becomes a little bit more difficult
p55
aVwhen I only have one foot on the ground
p56
aVand when I don't use my hands.
p57
aVNotice how this pole has a reflective marker on top,
p58
aVwhich means that it can be located in the space.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Audience) Oh!
p61
aa(lp62
V(Applause)
p63
aa(lp64
V(Applause ends)
p65
aa(lp66
VYou can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments
p67
aVto keep the pole balanced.
p68
aVHow did we design the algorithms to do this?
p69
aVWe added the mathematical model of the pole
p70
aVto that of the quad.
p71
aVOnce we have a model of the combined quad-pole system,
p72
aVwe can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it.
p73
aVHere, you see that it's stable,
p74
aVand even if I give it little nudges,
p75
aVit goes back \u2014
p76
aVto the nice, balanced position.
p77
aa(lp78
VWe can also augment the model
p79
aVto include where we want the quad to be in space.
p80
aVUsing this pointer, made out of reflective markers,
p81
aVI can point to where I want the quad to be in space
p82
aVa fixed distance away from me.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VThe key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms,
p87
aVdesigned with the help of mathematical models
p88
aVand control theory.
p89
aa(lp90
VLet's tell the quad to come back here
p91
aVand let the pole drop,
p92
aVand I will next demonstrate the importance
p93
aVof understanding physical models
p94
aVand the workings of the physical world.
p95
aVNotice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it.
p96
aVUnlike the balancing pole,
p97
aVI did not include the mathematical model of the glass
p98
aVin the system.
p99
aVIn fact, the system doesn't even know that the glass is there.
p100
aVLike before, I could use the pointer to tell the quad
p101
aVwhere I want it to be in space.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
V(Applause ends)
p106
aa(lp107
VOkay, you should be asking yourself,
p108
aVwhy doesn't the water fall out of the glass?
p109
aVTwo facts.
p110
aVThe first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way.
p111
aVThe second is that the propellers
p112
aVare all pointing in the same direction of the glass, pointing up.
p113
aVYou put these two things together,
p114
aVthe net result is that all side forces on the glass are small
p115
aVand are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects,
p116
aVwhich at these speeds are negligible.
p117
aVAnd that's why you don't need to model the glass.
p118
aVIt naturally doesn't spill, no matter what the quad does.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Audience) Oh!
p121
aa(lp122
V(Applause)
p123
aa(lp124
V(Applause ends)
p125
aa(lp126
VThe lesson here
p127
aVis that some high-performance tasks are easier than others,
p128
aVand that understanding the physics of the problem
p129
aVtells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard.
p130
aVIn this instance, carrying a glass of water is easy.
p131
aVBalancing a pole is hard.
p132
aa(lp133
VWe've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured.
p134
aVCan a machine also perform with extreme physical damage?
p135
aVConventional wisdom says
p136
aVthat you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly,
p137
aVbecause there are four degrees of freedom to control:
p138
aVroll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.
p139
aVHexacopters and octocopters, with six and eight propellers,
p140
aVcan provide redundancy,
p141
aVbut quadrocopters are much more popular
p142
aVbecause they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs: four.
p143
aVOr do they?
p144
aa(lp145
V(Audience) Oh!
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VIf we analyze the mathematical model of this machine
p150
aVwith only two working propellers,
p151
aVwe discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it.
p152
aVWe relinquish control of yaw,
p153
aVbut roll, pitch and acceleration can still be controlled
p154
aVwith algorithms that exploit this new configuration.
p155
aVMathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible.
p156
aVIn this instance, this knowledge allows us to design
p157
aVnovel machine architectures
p158
aVor to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage,
p159
aVjust like human athletes do,
p160
aVinstead of building machines with redundancy.
p161
aa(lp162
VWe can't help but hold our breath
p163
aVwhen we watch a diver somersaulting into the water,
p164
aVor when a vaulter is twisting in the air,
p165
aVthe ground fast approaching.
p166
aVWill the diver be able to pull off a rip entry?
p167
aVWill the vaulter stick the landing?
p168
aVSuppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip
p169
aVand finish off at the exact same spot that it started.
p170
aVThis maneuver is going to happen so quickly
p171
aVthat we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution.
p172
aVThere simply isn't enough time.
p173
aVInstead, what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly,
p174
aVobserve how it finishes the maneuver,
p175
aVand then use that information to modify its behavior
p176
aVso that the next flip is better.
p177
aVSimilar to the diver and the vaulter,
p178
aVit is only through repeated practice
p179
aVthat the maneuver can be learned and executed
p180
aVto the highest standard.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
V(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VStriking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports.
p187
aVHow do we make a machine do
p188
aVwhat an athlete does seemingly without effort?
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
V(Applause ends)
p195
aa(lp196
VThis quad has a racket strapped onto its head
p197
aVwith a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple, so not too large.
p198
aVThe following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds,
p199
aVor 50 times per second.
p200
aVWe first figure out where the ball is going.
p201
aVWe then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball
p202
aVso that it flies to where it was thrown from.
p203
aVThird, a trajectory is planned that carries the quad
p204
aVfrom its current state to the impact point with the ball.
p205
aVFourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds' worth of that strategy.
p206
aVTwenty milliseconds later, the whole process is repeated
p207
aVuntil the quad strikes the ball.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VMachines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own,
p212
aVthey can do it collectively.
p213
aVThese three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Applause)
p216
aa(lp217
V(Applause ends)
p218
aa(lp219
VThey perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver
p220
aVto launch the ball back to me.
p221
aVNotice that, at full extension, these quads are vertical.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VIn fact, when fully extended,
p226
aVthis is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels
p227
aVat the end of their launch.
p228
aa(lp229
VThe algorithms to do this are very similar
p230
aVto what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me.
p231
aVMathematical models are used to continuously re-plan
p232
aVa cooperative strategy 50 times per second.
p233
aa(lp234
VEverything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities.
p235
aVWhat happens when we couple this machine athleticism
p236
aVwith that of a human being?
p237
aVWhat I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor
p238
aVmainly used in gaming.
p239
aVIt can recognize what my various body parts
p240
aVare doing in real time.
p241
aVSimilar to the pointer that I used earlier,
p242
aVwe can use this as inputs to the system.
p243
aVWe now have a natural way of interacting
p244
aVwith the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
VInteraction doesn't have to be virtual.
p249
aVIt can be physical.
p250
aVTake this quad, for example.
p251
aVIt's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.
p252
aVIf I try to move it out of the way, it fights me,
p253
aVand moves back to where it wants to be.
p254
aVWe can change this behavior, however.
p255
aVWe can use mathematical models
p256
aVto estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad.
p257
aVOnce we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics,
p258
aVas far as the quad is concerned, of course.
p259
aVHere, the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid.
p260
aa(lp261
VWe now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine.
p262
aVI will use this new capability to position
p263
aVthis camera-carrying quad to the appropriate location
p264
aVfor filming the remainder of this demonstration.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo we can physically interact with these quads
p267
aVand we can change the laws of physics.
p268
aVLet's have a little bit of fun with this.
p269
aVFor what you will see next,
p270
aVthese quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto.
p271
aVAs time goes on, gravity will be increased
p272
aVuntil we're all back on planet Earth,
p273
aVbut I assure you we won't get there.
p274
aVOkay, here goes.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
V(Applause)
p281
aa(lp282
VWhew!
p283
aVYou're all thinking now,
p284
aVthese guys are having way too much fun,
p285
aVand you're probably also asking yourself,
p286
aVwhy exactly are they building machine athletes?
p287
aVSome conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom
p288
aVis to hone skills and develop capabilities.
p289
aVOthers think that it has more of a social role,
p290
aVthat it's used to bind the group.
p291
aVSimilarly, we use the analogy of sports and athleticism
p292
aVto create new algorithms for machines
p293
aVto push them to their limits.
p294
aVWhat impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life?
p295
aVLike all our past creations and innovations,
p296
aVthey may be used to improve the human condition
p297
aVor they may be misused and abused.
p298
aVThis is not a technical choice we are faced with;
p299
aVit's a social one.
p300
aVLet's make the right choice,
p301
aVthe choice that brings out the best in the future of machines,
p302
aVjust like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us.
p303
aa(lp304
VLet me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain.
p305
aVThey're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team.

VFederico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini,

aVMarkus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin, Mark Muller and Robin Ritz.

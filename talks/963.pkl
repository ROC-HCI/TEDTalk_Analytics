VI'm going to share with you the story
p5
aVas to how I have become
p6
aVan HIV/AIDS campaigner.
p7
aVAnd this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
p8
aVIn November of 2003,
p9
aVI was invited to take part
p10
aVin the launch of Nelson Mandela's
p11
aV46664 Foundation \u2014
p12
aVthat is his HIV/AIDS foundation.
p13
aVAnd 46664 is the number
p14
aVthat Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
p15
aVAnd that's me with Youssou N'Dour,
p16
aVonstage, having the time of my life.
p17
aVThe next day, all the artists were invited
p18
aVto join Mandela in Robben Island,
p19
aVwhere he was going to give a conference
p20
aVto the world's press,
p21
aVstanding in front of his former prison cell.
p22
aVYou can see the bars of the window there.
p23
aVIt was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
p24
aVIn that moment in time,
p25
aVMandela told the world's press
p26
aVthat there was a virtual genocide
p27
aVtaking place in his country;
p28
aVthat post-apartheid
p29
aVRainbow Nation,
p30
aVa thousand people were dying on a daily basis
p31
aVand that the front line victims,
p32
aVthe most vulnerable of all,
p33
aVwere women and children.
p34
aa(lp35
VThis was a huge impact on my mind,
p36
aVbecause I am a woman and I am a mother,
p37
aVand I hadn't realized
p38
aVthat the HIV/AIDS pandemic
p39
aVwas directly affecting women in such a way.
p40
aVAnd so I committed \u2014 when I left South Africa,
p41
aVwhen I left Capetown,
p42
aVI told myself, "This is going to be something
p43
aVthat I have to talk about.
p44
aVI have to serve."
p45
aVAnd so, subsequently
p46
aVI participated in every single
p47
aV46664 event
p48
aVthat I could take part in
p49
aVand gave news conferences,
p50
aVinterviews,
p51
aVtalking and using my platform as a musician,
p52
aVwith my commitment to Mandela \u2014
p53
aVout of respect for the tremendous,
p54
aVunbelievable work that he had done.
p55
aVEveryone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,
p56
aVeveryone reveres Nelson Mandela.
p57
aVBut do they all know
p58
aVabout what has been taking place in South Africa,
p59
aVhis country,
p60
aVthe country that had one of the highest incidents
p61
aVof transmission of the virus?
p62
aVI think that if I went out into the street now
p63
aVand I told people what was happening there,
p64
aVthey would be shocked.
p65
aa(lp66
VI was very, very fortunate a couple of years later
p67
aVto have met Zackie Achmat,
p68
aVthe founder of Treatment Action Campaign,
p69
aVan incredible campaigner and activist.
p70
aVI met him at a 46664 event.
p71
aVHe was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
p72
aVThis is a tool \u2014
p73
aVthis tells you I am in solidarity
p74
aVwith people who have HIV,
p75
aVpeople who are living with HIV.
p76
aVAnd in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt
p77
aVI say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.
p78
aVIt doesn't have to be in the closet."
p79
aVI became a member of Treatment Action Campaign
p80
aVand I'm very proud to be a member
p81
aVof that incredible organization.
p82
aVIt's a grassroots campaign
p83
aVwith 80 percent membership being women,
p84
aVmost of whom are HIV-positive.
p85
aVThey work in the field.
p86
aVThey have tremendous outreach
p87
aVto the people who are living directly
p88
aVwith the effects of the virus.
p89
aVThey have education programs.
p90
aVThey bring out the issues of stigma.
p91
aVIt's quite extraordinary what they do.
p92
aVAnd yes, my SING Campaign
p93
aVhas supported Treatment Action Campaign
p94
aVin the way that I have tried to raise awareness
p95
aVand to try to also raise funds.
p96
aVA lot of the funding that I have managed to raise
p97
aVhas gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign
p98
aVand the incredible work that they do,
p99
aVand are still continuing to do in South Africa.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo this is my SING Campaign.
p102
aVSING Campaign is basically just me
p103
aVand about three or four wonderful people
p104
aVwho help to support me.
p105
aVI've traveled all over the world
p106
aVin the last two and a half years \u2014
p107
aVI went to about 12 different countries.
p108
aVHere I am in Oslo in Norway,
p109
aVgetting a nice, fat check;
p110
aVsinging in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
p111
aVIn Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play
p112
aVto a mainly white, middle-class South African audience
p113
aVwho ended up in tears
p114
aVbecause I use film clips
p115
aVthat really touch the heart, the whole nature,
p116
aVof this terrible tragedy that is taking place,
p117
aVthat people are tending to avoid,
p118
aVbecause they are fatigued,
p119
aVand they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
p120
aVAaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister,
p121
aVattended that concert
p122
aVand I had an opportunity to meet with him,
p123
aVand he gave his absolute commitment
p124
aVto try to making a change,
p125
aVwhich is absolutely necessary.
p126
aVThis is in the Scottish Parliament.
p127
aVI've subsequently become an envoy
p128
aVfor Scotland and HIV.
p129
aVAnd I was showing them my experiences
p130
aVand trying to, again, raise awareness.
p131
aVAnd once again, in Edinburgh
p132
aVwith the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
p133
aVAnd it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned
p134
aVbecause of their family being affected
p135
aVby the AIDS virus.
p136
aa(lp137
VI'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe \u2014
p138
aVhe's the director of UNAIDS.
p139
aVAnd I'm very honored
p140
aVby the fact that Michel invited me,
p141
aVonly a few months ago,
p142
aVto become a UNAIDS ambassador.
p143
aVAnd in this way, I've been strengthening my platform
p144
aVand broadening my outreach.
p145
aVThe message that UNAIDS
p146
aVare currently sending out to the world
p147
aVis that we would like to see the virtual elimination
p148
aVof the transmission of the virus
p149
aVfrom mother to child by 2015.
p150
aVIt's a very ambitious goal
p151
aVbut we believe it can be achieved with political will.
p152
aVThis can happen.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd here I am with a pregnant woman,
p155
aVwho is HIV positive
p156
aVand we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,
p157
aVbecause we know that that young woman
p158
aVis receiving treatment
p159
aVso her life can be extended
p160
aVto take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
p161
aVAnd her baby will receive PMTCT,
p162
aVwhich will mean that that baby
p163
aVcan be born free of the virus.
p164
aVNow that is prevention
p165
aVat the very beginning of life.
p166
aVIt's one way to start looking at intervention
p167
aVwith the AIDS pandemic.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, I just would like to finish off
p170
aVto tell you the little story
p171
aVabout Avelile.
p172
aVThis is Avelile \u2014
p173
aVshe goes with me wherever I go.
p174
aVI tell her story to everyone
p175
aVbecause she represents
p176
aVone of millions
p177
aVof HIV/AIDS orphans.
p178
aVAvelile's mother
p179
aVhad HIV virus \u2014
p180
aVshe died
p181
aVfrom AIDS-related illness.
p182
aVAvelile had the virus,
p183
aVshe was born with the virus.
p184
aVAnd here she is at seven years old,
p185
aVweighing no more than a one year-old baby.
p186
aVAt this point in her life,
p187
aVshe's suffering with full-blown AIDS
p188
aVand had pneumonia.
p189
aVWe met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape
p190
aVand spent a whole afternoon with her \u2014 an adorable child.
p191
aVThe doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
p192
aVThey put her on very special nutritious diet
p193
aVand took great care of her.
p194
aVAnd we didn't know when we left the hospital \u2014
p195
aVbecause we filmed her story \u2014 we didn't know if she was going to survive.
p196
aVSo, it was obviously \u2014 it was a very emotional encounter
p197
aVand left us feeling very resonant
p198
aVwith this direct experience, this one child,
p199
aVyou know, that story.
p200
aVFive months later,
p201
aVwe went back to South Africa
p202
aVto meet Avelile again.
p203
aVAnd I'm getting \u2014
p204
aVthe hairs on my \u2014 I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
p205
aVThey're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.
p206
aVThis is the transformation that took place.
p207
aVIsn't it extraordinary?
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VThat round of applause is actually
p212
aVfor the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
p213
aVAnd I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
p214
aVSo, I would like to say to you,
p215
aVeach one in the audience,
p216
aVif you feel that every mother
p217
aVand every child in the world
p218
aVhas the right to have access
p219
aVto good nutrition and good medical care,
p220
aVand you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,
p221
aVspecifically five and six,
p222
aVshould be absolutely committed to
p223
aVby all governments around the world \u2014
p224
aVespecially in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014
p225
aVcould you please stand up.
p226
aVI think that's fair to say,
p227
aVit's almost everyone in the hall.
p228
aa(lp229
VThank you very much.

South Africa has a tradition of activist songs and singing; inspired by this, in spring 2007 Lennox invited 23 female artists to record the benefit single &quot;Sing.&quot; The record incorporates the South African activist song &quot;Jikelele,&quot; which means &quot;global treatment.&quot; So far, sales of &quot;Sing&quot; have raised 100,000 pounds, while other appearances since then have multiplied that sum. SING&#39;s money goes to support efforts such as the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), which works to fight mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

South Africa has a tradition of activist songs and singing; inspired by this, in spring 2007 Lennox invited 23 female artists to record the benefit single &quot;Sing.&quot; The record incorporates the South African activist song &quot;Jikelele,&quot; which means &quot;global treatment.&quot; So far, sales of &quot;Sing&quot; have raised 100,000 pounds, while other appearances since then have multiplied that sum. SING&#39;s money goes to support efforts such as the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), which works to fight mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

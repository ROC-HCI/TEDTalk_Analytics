VWhat is so special about the human brain?
p5
aVWhy is it that we study other animals
p6
aVinstead of them studying us?
p7
aVWhat does a human brain have or do
p8
aVthat no other brain does?
p9
aVWhen I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago,
p10
aVscientists thought they knew what different brains were made of.
p11
aVThough it was based on very little evidence,
p12
aVmany scientists thought that all mammalian brains,
p13
aVincluding the human brain,
p14
aVwere made in the same way,
p15
aVwith a number of neurons that was always
p16
aVproportional to the size of the brain.
p17
aVThis means that two brains of the same size,
p18
aVlike these two, with a respectable 400 grams,
p19
aVshould have similar numbers of neurons.
p20
aVNow, if neurons are the functional
p21
aVinformation processing units of the brain,
p22
aVthen the owners of these two brains
p23
aVshould have similar cognitive abilities.
p24
aVAnd yet, one is a chimp,
p25
aVand the other is a cow.
p26
aVNow maybe cows have a really rich
p27
aVinternal mental life and are so smart
p28
aVthat they choose not to let us realize it,
p29
aVbut we eat them.
p30
aVI think most people will agree
p31
aVthat chimps are capable of much more complex,
p32
aVelaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are.
p33
aVSo this is a first indication that the
p34
aV"all brains are made the same way" scenario
p35
aVis not quite right.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut let's play along.
p38
aVIf all brains were made the same way
p39
aVand you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes,
p40
aVlarger brains should always have more neurons
p41
aVthan smaller brains, and the larger the brain,
p42
aVthe more cognitively able its owner should be.
p43
aVSo the largest brain around should also be
p44
aVthe most cognitively able.
p45
aVAnd here comes the bad news:
p46
aVOur brain, not the largest one around.
p47
aVIt seems quite vexing.
p48
aVOur brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos,
p49
aVbut elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos,
p50
aVand whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos,
p51
aVwhich is why scientists used to resort to saying
p52
aVthat our brain must be special
p53
aVto explain our cognitive abilities.
p54
aVIt must be really extraordinary,
p55
aVan exception to the rule.
p56
aVTheirs may be bigger, but ours is better,
p57
aVand it could be better, for example,
p58
aVin that it seems larger than it should be,
p59
aVwith a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have
p60
aVfor the size of our bodies.
p61
aVSo that would give us extra cortex
p62
aVto do more interesting things than just operating the body.
p63
aVThat's because the size of the brain
p64
aVusually follows the size of the body.
p65
aVSo the main reason for saying that
p66
aVour brain is larger than it should be
p67
aVactually comes from comparing ourselves
p68
aVto great apes.
p69
aVGorillas can be two to three times larger than we are,
p70
aVso their brains should also be larger than ours,
p71
aVbut instead it's the other way around.
p72
aVOur brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe human brain also seems special
p75
aVin the amount of energy that it uses.
p76
aVAlthough it weighs only two percent of the body,
p77
aVit alone uses 25 percent of all the energy
p78
aVthat your body requires to run per day.
p79
aVThat's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories,
p80
aVjust to keep your brain working.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo the human brain is larger than it should be,
p83
aVit uses much more energy than it should,
p84
aVso it's special.
p85
aVAnd this is where the story started to bother me.
p86
aVIn biology, we look for rules
p87
aVthat apply to all animals and to life in general,
p88
aVso why should the rules of evolution
p89
aVapply to everybody else but not to us?
p90
aVMaybe the problem was with the basic assumption
p91
aVthat all brains are made in the same way.
p92
aVMaybe two brains of a similar size
p93
aVcan actually be made of very different numbers of neurons.
p94
aVMaybe a very large brain
p95
aVdoes not necessarily have more neurons
p96
aVthan a more modest-sized brain.
p97
aVMaybe the human brain  actually has the most neurons
p98
aVof any brain, regardless of its size,
p99
aVespecially in the cerebral cortex.
p100
aVSo this to me became
p101
aVthe important question to answer:
p102
aVhow many neurons does the human brain have,
p103
aVand how does that compare to other animals?
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, you may have heard or read somewhere
p106
aVthat we have 100 billion neurons,
p107
aVso 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues
p108
aVif they knew where this number came from.
p109
aVBut nobody did.
p110
aVI've been digging through the literature
p111
aVfor the original reference for that number,
p112
aVand I could never find it.
p113
aVIt seems that nobody had actually ever counted
p114
aVthe number of neurons in the human brain,
p115
aVor in any other brain for that matter.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain,
p118
aVand it essentially consists of
p119
aVdissolving that brain into soup.
p120
aVIt works like this:
p121
aVYou take a brain, or parts of that brain,
p122
aVand you dissolve it in detergent,
p123
aVwhich destroys the cell membranes
p124
aVbut keeps the cell nuclei intact,
p125
aVso you end up with a suspension of free nuclei
p126
aVthat looks like this,
p127
aVlike a clear soup.
p128
aVThis soup contains all the nuclei
p129
aVthat once were a mouse brain.
p130
aVNow, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,
p131
aVyou can agitate it and make those nuclei
p132
aVbe distributed homogeneously in the liquid,
p133
aVso that now by looking under the microscope
p134
aVat just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution,
p135
aVyou can count nuclei, and therefore tell
p136
aVhow many cells that brain had.
p137
aVIt's simple, it's straightforward,
p138
aVand it's really fast.
p139
aVSo we've used that method to count neurons
p140
aVin dozens of different species so far,
p141
aVand it turns out that all brains
p142
aVare not made the same way.
p143
aVTake rodents and primates, for instance:
p144
aVIn larger rodent brains, the average size
p145
aVof the neuron increases,
p146
aVso the brain inflates very rapidly
p147
aVand gains size much faster than it gains neurons.
p148
aVBut primate brains gain neurons
p149
aVwithout the average neuron becoming any larger,
p150
aVwhich is a very economical way
p151
aVto add neurons to your brain.
p152
aVThe result is that a primate brain
p153
aVwill always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size,
p154
aVand the larger the brain,
p155
aVthe larger this difference will be.
p156
aVWell, what about our brain then?
p157
aVWe found that we have, on average,
p158
aV86 billion neurons,
p159
aV16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex,
p160
aVand if you consider that the cerebral cortex
p161
aVis the seat of functions like
p162
aVawareness and logical and abstract reasoning,
p163
aVand that 16 billion is the most neurons
p164
aVthat any cortex has,
p165
aVI think this is the simplest explanation
p166
aVfor our remarkable cognitive abilities.
p167
aVBut just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean.
p168
aVBecause we found that the relationship
p169
aVbetween the size of the brain and its number of neurons
p170
aVcould be described mathematically,
p171
aVwe could calculate what a human brain
p172
aVwould look like if it was made like a rodent brain.
p173
aVSo, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons
p174
aVwould weigh 36 kilos.
p175
aVThat's not possible.
p176
aVA brain that huge would be crushed
p177
aVby its own weight,
p178
aVand this impossible brain would go
p179
aVin the body of 89 tons.
p180
aVI don't think it looks like us.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo this brings us to a very important conclusion already,
p183
aVwhich is that we are not rodents.
p184
aVThe human brain is not a large rat brain.
p185
aVCompared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,
p186
aVbut that's not a fair comparison to make,
p187
aVgiven that we know that we are not rodents.
p188
aVWe are primates,
p189
aVso the correct comparison is to other primates.
p190
aVAnd there, if you do the math,
p191
aVyou find that a generic primate
p192
aVwith 86 billion neurons
p193
aVwould have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,
p194
aVwhich seems just right,
p195
aVin a body of some 66 kilos,
p196
aVwhich in my case is exactly right,
p197
aVwhich brings us to a very unsurprising
p198
aVbut still incredibly important conclusion:
p199
aVI am a primate.
p200
aVAnd all of you are primates.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd so was Darwin.
p203
aVI love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this.
p204
aVHis brain, like ours,
p205
aVwas made in the image of other primate brains.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo the human brain may be remarkable, yes,
p208
aVbut it is not special in its number of neurons.
p209
aVIt is just a large primate brain.
p210
aVI think that's a very humbling and sobering thought
p211
aVthat should remind us of our place in nature.
p212
aa(lp213
VWhy does it cost so much energy, then?
p214
aVWell, other people have figured out
p215
aVhow much energy the human brain
p216
aVand that of other species costs,
p217
aVand now that we knew how many neurons
p218
aVeach brain was made of, we could do the math.
p219
aVAnd it turns out that both human
p220
aVand other brains cost about the same,
p221
aVan average of six calories  per billion neurons per day.
p222
aVSo the total energetic cost of a brain
p223
aVis a simple, linear function
p224
aVof its number of neurons,
p225
aVand it turns out that the human brain
p226
aVcosts just as much energy as you would expect.
p227
aVSo the reason why the human brain
p228
aVcosts so much energy is simply because
p229
aVit has a huge number of neurons,
p230
aVand because we are primates
p231
aVwith many more neurons for a given body size
p232
aVthan any other animal,
p233
aVthe relative cost of our brain is large,
p234
aVbut just because we're primates, not because we're special.
p235
aa(lp236
VLast question, then:
p237
aVhow did we come by this remarkable number of neurons,
p238
aVand in particular, if great apes
p239
aVare larger than we are,
p240
aVwhy don't they have a larger brain  than we do, with more neurons?
p241
aVWhen we realized how much expensive it is
p242
aVto have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,
p243
aVmaybe there's a simple reason.
p244
aVThey just can't afford the energy
p245
aVfor both a large body  and a large number of neurons.
p246
aVSo we did the math.
p247
aVWe calculated on the one hand
p248
aVhow much energy a primate gets per day
p249
aVfrom eating raw foods,
p250
aVand on the other hand, how much energy
p251
aVa body of a certain size costs
p252
aVand how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs,
p253
aVand we looked for the combinations
p254
aVof body size and number of brain neurons
p255
aVthat a primate could afford
p256
aVif it ate a certain number of hours per day.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd what we found is that
p259
aVbecause neurons are so expensive,
p260
aVthere is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons.
p261
aVSo a primate that eats eight hours per day
p262
aVcan afford at most 53 billion neurons,
p263
aVbut then its body cannot be any bigger
p264
aVthan 25 kilos.
p265
aVTo weigh any more than that,
p266
aVit has to give up neurons.
p267
aVSo it's either a large body
p268
aVor a large number of neurons.
p269
aVWhen you eat like a primate,
p270
aVyou can't afford both.
p271
aa(lp272
VOne way out of this metabolic limitation
p273
aVwould be to spend even more hours per day eating,
p274
aVbut that gets dangerous,
p275
aVand past a certain point, it's just not possible.
p276
aVGorillas and orangutans, for instance,
p277
aVafford about 30 billion neurons
p278
aVby spending eight and a half hours per day eating,
p279
aVand that seems to be about as much as they can do.
p280
aVNine hours of feeding per day
p281
aVseems to be the practical limit for a primate.
p282
aa(lp283
VWhat about us?
p284
aVWith our 86 billion neurons
p285
aVand 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,
p286
aVwe should have to spend over nine hours
p287
aVper day every single day feeding,
p288
aVwhich is just not feasible.
p289
aVIf we ate like a primate,
p290
aVwe should not be here.
p291
aa(lp292
VHow did we get here, then?
p293
aVWell, if our brain costs just as much energy
p294
aVas it should, and if we can't spend
p295
aVevery waking hour of the day feeding,
p296
aVthen the only alternative, really,
p297
aVis to somehow get more energy
p298
aVout of the same foods.
p299
aVAnd remarkably, that matches exactly
p300
aVwhat our ancestors are believed to have invented
p301
aVone and a half million years ago,
p302
aVwhen they invented cooking.
p303
aVTo cook is to use fire
p304
aVto pre-digest foods outside of your body.
p305
aVCooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew
p306
aVand to turn completely into mush in your mouth,
p307
aVso that allows them to be completely digested
p308
aVand absorbed in your gut,
p309
aVwhich makes them yield much more energy in much less time.
p310
aVSo cooking frees time for us to do
p311
aVmuch more interesting things with our day
p312
aVand with our neurons
p313
aVthan just thinking about food,
p314
aVlooking for food, and gobbling down food
p315
aVall day long.
p316
aa(lp317
VSo because of cooking, what once was
p318
aVa major liability, this large,
p319
aVdangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,
p320
aVcould now become a major asset,
p321
aVnow that we could both afford  the energy for a lot of neurons
p322
aVand the time to do interesting things with them.
p323
aVSo I think this explains why the human brain
p324
aVgrew to become so large so fast in evolution,
p325
aVall of the while remaining just a primate brain.
p326
aVWith this large brain now affordable by cooking,
p327
aVwe went rapidly from raw foods to culture,
p328
aVagriculture, civilization, grocery stores,
p329
aVelectricity, refrigerators,
p330
aVall of those things that nowadays
p331
aVallow us to get all the energy we need
p332
aVfor the whole day in a single sitting
p333
aVat your favorite fast food joint.
p334
aVSo what once was a solution
p335
aVnow became the problem,
p336
aVand ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo what is the human advantage?
p339
aVWhat is it that we have
p340
aVthat no other animal has?
p341
aVMy answer is that we have the largest number
p342
aVof neurons in the cerebral cortex,
p343
aVand I think that's the simplest explanation
p344
aVfor our remarkable cognitive abilities.
p345
aVAnd what is it that we do that no other animal does,
p346
aVand which I believe was fundamental
p347
aVto allow us to reach that large,
p348
aVlargest number of neurons in the cortex?
p349
aVIn two words, we cook.
p350
aVNo other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.
p351
aVAnd I think that's how we got to become human.
p352
aa(lp353
VStudying the human brain changed  the way I think about food.
p354
aVI now look at my kitchen,
p355
aVand I bow to it,
p356
aVand I thank my ancestors for coming up
p357
aVwith the invention that probably made us humans.
p358
aVThank you very much.

Result: the human brain has about 86 billion neurons, 14 billion fewer than assumed -- but intriguingly, far more than other animals, relative to brain size.</p>  <p>She suggests that it was the invention of cooking by our ancestors -- which makes food yield much more metabolic energy -- that allowed humans to develop the largest primate brain.

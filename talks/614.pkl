VIf I could reveal anything
p5
aVthat is hidden from us,
p6
aVat least in modern cultures,
p7
aVit would be to reveal something that we've forgotten,
p8
aVthat we used to know
p9
aVas well as we knew our own names.
p10
aVAnd that is that we live in a competent universe,
p11
aVthat we are part of a brilliant planet,
p12
aVand that we are surrounded by genius.
p13
aa(lp14
VBiomimicry is a new discipline
p15
aVthat tries to learn from those geniuses,
p16
aVand take advice from them, design advice.
p17
aVThat's where I live,
p18
aVand it's my university as well.
p19
aVI'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but
p20
aVremember the organisms and the ecosystems
p21
aVthat know how to live here gracefully on this planet.
p22
aVThis is what I would tell you to remember
p23
aVif you ever forget this again.
p24
aVRemember this.
p25
aVThis is what happens every year.
p26
aVThis is what keeps its promise.
p27
aVWhile we're doing bailouts, this is what happened.
p28
aVSpring.
p29
aa(lp30
VImagine designing spring.
p31
aVImagine that orchestration.
p32
aVYou think TED is hard to organize. (Laughter) Right?
p33
aVImagine, and if you haven't done this in a while, do.
p34
aVImagine the timing, the coordination,
p35
aVall without top-down laws,
p36
aVor policies, or climate change protocols.
p37
aVThis happens every year.
p38
aVThere is lots of showing off.
p39
aVThere is lots of love in the air.
p40
aVThere's lots of grand openings.
p41
aVAnd the organisms, I promise you,
p42
aVhave all of their priorities in order.
p43
aa(lp44
VI have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this,
p45
aVbecause he's living, usually on his back,
p46
aVlooking up at those grasses.
p47
aVAnd one time he came up to me \u2014
p48
aVhe was about seven or eight years old \u2014 he came up to me.
p49
aVAnd there was a wasp's nest
p50
aVthat I had let grow in my yard,
p51
aVright outside my door.
p52
aVAnd most people knock them down when they're small.
p53
aVBut it was fascinating to me,
p54
aVbecause I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers.
p55
aVAnd he came up to me and he knocked.
p56
aVHe would come every day with something to show me.
p57
aVAnd like, knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up.
p58
aVAnd he asked me
p59
aVhow I had made the house for those wasps,
p60
aVbecause he had never seen one this big.
p61
aVAnd I told him, "You know, Cody,
p62
aVthe wasps actually made that."
p63
aVAnd we looked at it together.
p64
aVAnd I could see why he thought,
p65
aVyou know \u2014 it was so beautifully done.
p66
aVIt was so architectural. It was so precise.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut it occurred to me, how in his small life
p69
aVhad he already believed the myth
p70
aVthat if something was that well done,
p71
aVthat we must have done it.
p72
aVHow did he not know \u2014
p73
aVit's what we've all forgotten \u2014
p74
aVthat we're not the first ones to build.
p75
aVWe're not the first ones to process cellulose.
p76
aVWe're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones
p77
aVto try to optimize packing space,
p78
aVor to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure.
p79
aVWe're not the first ones to build houses for our young.
p80
aa(lp81
VWhat's happening now, in this field called biomimicry,
p82
aVis that people are beginning to remember
p83
aVthat organisms, other organisms,
p84
aVthe rest of the natural world,
p85
aVare doing things very similar to what we need to do.
p86
aVBut in fact they are doing them in a way
p87
aVthat have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet
p88
aVfor billions of years.
p89
aVSo these people, biomimics,
p90
aVare nature's apprentices.
p91
aVAnd they're focusing on function.
p92
aVWhat I'd like to do is show you a few of the things
p93
aVthat they're learning.
p94
aVThey have asked themselves,
p95
aV"What if, every time I started to invent something,
p96
aVI asked, 'How would nature solve this?'"
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd here is what they're learning.
p99
aVThis is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley.
p100
aVThis is a story about an engineer at J.R. West.
p101
aVThey're the people who make the bullet train.
p102
aVIt was called the bullet train
p103
aVbecause it was rounded in front,
p104
aVbut every time it went into a tunnel
p105
aVit would build up a pressure wave,
p106
aVand then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.
p107
aVSo the engineer's boss said,
p108
aV"Find a way to quiet this train."
p109
aa(lp110
VHe happened to be a birder.
p111
aVHe went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting.
p112
aVAnd he studied \u2014 there was a film about king fishers.
p113
aVAnd he thought to himself, "They go from one density of medium,
p114
aVthe air, into another density of medium, water,
p115
aVwithout a splash. Look at this picture.
p116
aVWithout a splash, so they can see the fish.
p117
aVAnd he thought, "What if we do this?"
p118
aVQuieted the train.
p119
aVMade it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity.
p120
aa(lp121
VHow does nature repel bacteria?
p122
aVWe're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves
p123
aVfrom some bacteria.
p124
aVTurns out that \u2014 this is a Galapagos Shark.
p125
aVIt has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles.
p126
aVAnd it's not because it goes fast.
p127
aVIt actually basks. It's a slow-moving shark.
p128
aVSo how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up?
p129
aVIt doesn't do it with a chemical.
p130
aVIt does it, it turns out, with the same denticles
p131
aVthat you had on Speedo bathing suits,
p132
aVthat broke all those records in the Olympics,
p133
aa(lp134
Vbut it's a particular kind of pattern.
p135
aVAnd that pattern, the architecture of that pattern
p136
aVon its skin denticles
p137
aVkeep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.
p138
aVThere is a company called Sharklet Technologies
p139
aVthat's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals
p140
aVto keep bacteria from landing,
p141
aVwhich is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers
p142
aVthat many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant.
p143
aVHospital-acquired infections are now killing
p144
aVmore people every year in the United States
p145
aVthan die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined \u2014
p146
aVabout 100,000.
p147
aa(lp148
VThis is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert.
p149
aVIt has no fresh water that it's able to drink,
p150
aVbut it drinks water out of fog.
p151
aVIt's got bumps on the back of its wing covers.
p152
aVAnd those bumps act like a magnet for water.
p153
aVThey have water-loving tips, and waxy sides.
p154
aVAnd the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips.
p155
aVAnd it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth.
p156
aVThere is actually a scientist here at Oxford
p157
aVwho studied this, Andrew Parker.
p158
aVAnd now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw
p159
aVare starting to look at this as a way
p160
aVof coating buildings
p161
aVso that they gather water from the fog.
p162
aV10 times better than our fog-catching nets.
p163
aa(lp164
VCO2 as a building block.
p165
aVOrganisms don't think of CO2 as a poison.
p166
aVPlants and organisms that make shells,
p167
aVcoral, think of it as a building block.
p168
aVThere is now a cement manufacturing company
p169
aVstarting in the United States called Calera.
p170
aVThey've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef,
p171
aVand they're using CO2 as a building block
p172
aVin cement, in concrete.
p173
aVInstead of \u2014 cement usually
p174
aVemits a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement.
p175
aVNow it's reversing that equation,
p176
aVand actually sequestering half a ton of CO2
p177
aVthanks to the recipe from the coral.
p178
aa(lp179
VNone of these are using the organisms.
p180
aVThey're really only using the blueprints or the recipes
p181
aVfrom the organisms.
p182
aVHow does nature gather the sun's energy?
p183
aVThis is a new kind of solar cell
p184
aVthat's based on how a leaf works.
p185
aVIt's self-assembling.
p186
aVIt can be put down on any substrate whatsoever.
p187
aVIt's extremely inexpensive
p188
aVand rechargeable every five years.
p189
aVIt's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun,
p190
aVwith Paul Hawken.
p191
aa(lp192
VThere are many many ways that nature filters water
p193
aVthat takes salt out of water.
p194
aVWe take water and push it against a membrane.
p195
aVAnd then we wonder why the membrane clogs
p196
aVand why it takes so much electricity.
p197
aVNature does something much more elegant.
p198
aVAnd it's in every cell.
p199
aVEvery red blood cell of your body right now
p200
aVhas these hourglass-shaped pores
p201
aVcalled aquaporins.
p202
aVThey actually export water molecules through.
p203
aVIt's kind of a forward osmosis.
p204
aVThey export water molecules through,
p205
aVand leave solutes on the other side.
p206
aVA company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination
p207
aVmembranes mimicking this technology.
p208
aa(lp209
VTrees and bones are constantly reforming themselves
p210
aValong lines of stress.
p211
aVThis algorithm has been put into a software program
p212
aVthat's now being used to make bridges lightweight,
p213
aVto make building beams lightweight.
p214
aVActually G.M. Opel used it
p215
aVto create that skeleton you see,
p216
aVin what's called their bionic car.
p217
aVIt lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material,
p218
aVas an organism must,
p219
aVfor the maximum amount of strength.
p220
aa(lp221
VThis beetle, unlike this chip bag here,
p222
aVthis beetle uses one material, chitin.
p223
aVAnd it finds many many ways
p224
aVto put many functions into it.
p225
aVIt's waterproof.
p226
aVIt's strong and resilient.
p227
aVIt's breathable. It creates color through structure.
p228
aVWhereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things.
p229
aVOne of our major inventions
p230
aVthat we need to be able to do
p231
aVto come even close to what these organisms can do
p232
aVis to find a way
p233
aVto minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use,
p234
aVand to add design to it.
p235
aVWe use five polymers in the natural world
p236
aVto do everything that you see.
p237
aVIn our world we use about 350 polymers
p238
aVto make all this.
p239
aa(lp240
VNature is nano.
p241
aVNanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this.
p242
aVLoose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me
p243
aVis that not many people have been asking,
p244
aV"How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe?"
p245
aVNature has been doing that for a long time.
p246
aVEmbedding nanoparticles in a material for instance, always.
p247
aVIn fact, sulfur-reducing bacteria,
p248
aVas part of their synthesis,
p249
aVthey will emit, as a byproduct,
p250
aVnanoparticles into the water.
p251
aVBut then right after that, they emit a protein
p252
aVthat actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles
p253
aVso that they fall out of solution.
p254
aa(lp255
VEnergy use. Organisms sip energy,
p256
aVbecause they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get.
p257
aVAnd one of the largest fields right now,
p258
aVin the world of energy grids,
p259
aVyou hear about the smart grid.
p260
aVOne of the largest consultants are the social insects.
p261
aVSwarm technology. There is a company called Regen.
p262
aVThey are looking at how ants and bees
p263
aVfind their food and their flowers
p264
aVin the most effective way
p265
aVas a whole hive.
p266
aVAnd they're having appliances in your home
p267
aVtalk to one another through that algorithm,
p268
aVand determine how to minimize peak power use.
p269
aa(lp270
VThere's a group of scientists in Cornell
p271
aVthat are making what they call a synthetic tree,
p272
aVbecause they are saying, "There is no pump at the bottom of a tree."
p273
aVIt's capillary action and transpiration pulls
p274
aVwater up, a drop at a time,
p275
aVpulling it, releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots.
p276
aVAnd they're creating \u2014 you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper.
p277
aVThey're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings
p278
aVto move water up without pumps.
p279
aa(lp280
VAmazon electric eel \u2014 incredibly endangered,
p281
aVsome of these species \u2014
p282
aVcreate 600 volts of electricity
p283
aVwith the chemicals that are in your body.
p284
aVEven more interesting to me is that
p285
aV600 volts doesn't fry it.
p286
aVYou know we use PVC, and we sheath wires
p287
aVwith PVC for insulation.
p288
aVThese organisms, how are they insulating
p289
aVagainst their own electric charge?
p290
aVThese are some questions that we've yet to ask.
p291
aa(lp292
VHere's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale.
p293
aVHumpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers.
p294
aVAnd those scalloped edges
p295
aVplay with flow in such a way
p296
aVthat is reduces drag by 32 percent.
p297
aVThese wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds, as a result.
p298
aa(lp299
VMIT just has a new radio chip
p300
aVthat uses far less power than our chips.
p301
aVAnd it's based on the cochlear of your ear,
p302
aVable to pick up internet, wireless, television signals
p303
aVand radio signals, in the same chip.
p304
aVFinally, on an ecosystem scale.
p305
aa(lp306
VAt Biomimicry Guild, which is my consulting company,
p307
aVwe work with HOK Architects.
p308
aVWe're looking at building whole cities
p309
aVin their planning department.
p310
aVAnd what we're saying is that,
p311
aVshouldn't our cities do at least as well,
p312
aVin terms of ecosystem services,
p313
aVas the native systems that they replace?
p314
aVSo we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards
p315
aVthat hold cities to this higher bar.
p316
aa(lp317
VThe question is \u2014 biomimicry is an incredibly powerful
p318
aVway to innovate.
p319
aVThe question I would ask is, "What's worth solving?"
p320
aVIf you haven't seen this, it's pretty amazing.
p321
aVDr. Adam Neiman.
p322
aVThis is a depiction of
p323
aVall of the water on Earth
p324
aVin relation to the volume of the Earth \u2014
p325
aVall the ice, all the fresh water, all the sea water \u2014
p326
aVand all the atmosphere that we can breathe, in relation to the volume of the Earth.
p327
aVAnd inside those balls
p328
aVlife, over 3.8 billion years,
p329
aVhas made a lush, livable place for us.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd we are in a long, long line
p332
aVof organisms
p333
aVto come to this planet and ask ourselves,
p334
aV"How can we live here gracefully over the long haul?"
p335
aVHow can we do what life has learned to do?
p336
aVWhich is to create conditions conducive to life.
p337
aVNow in order to do this, the design challenge
p338
aVof our century, I think,
p339
aVwe need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses,
p340
aVand to somehow meet them again.
p341
aa(lp342
VOne of the big ideas, one of the big projects
p343
aVI've been honored to work on
p344
aVis a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.
p345
aVIt's called AskNature.org.
p346
aVAnd what we're trying to do, in a TEDesque way,
p347
aVis to organize all biological information
p348
aVby design and engineering function.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd we're working with EOL, Encyclopedia of Life,
p351
aVEd Wilson's TED wish.
p352
aVAnd he's gathering all biological information
p353
aVon one website.
p354
aVAnd the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question,
p355
aV"What can we learn from this organism?"
p356
aVAnd that information will go into AskNature.org.
p357
aVAnd hopefully, any inventor, anywhere in the world,
p358
aVwill be able, in the moment of creation,
p359
aVto type in, "How does nature remove salt from water?"
p360
aVAnd up will come mangroves, and sea turtles
p361
aVand your own kidneys.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd we'll begin to
p364
aVbe able to
p365
aVdo as Cody does,
p366
aVand actually be in touch
p367
aVwith these incredible models,
p368
aVthese elders that have been here
p369
aVfar, far longer than we have.
p370
aVAnd hopefully, with their help,
p371
aVwe'll learn how to live on this Earth,
p372
aVand on this home that is ours, but not ours alone.
p373
aVThank you very much.

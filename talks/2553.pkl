VWhat do you do if you had to figure out the information
p5
aVbehind 11.5 million documents,
p6
aVverify it and make sense of it?
p7
aVThat was a challenge
p8
aVthat a group of journalists had to face late last year.
p9
aVAn anonymous person calling himself John Doe
p10
aVhad somehow managed to copy nearly 40 years of records
p11
aVof the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
p12
aVThis is one of many firms around the world
p13
aVthat specialize in setting up accounts in offshore tax havens
p14
aVlike the British Virgin Islands,
p15
aVfor rich and powerful people who like to keep secrets.
p16
aa(lp17
VJohn Doe had managed to copy every spreadsheet from this firm,
p18
aVevery client file,
p19
aVevery email,
p20
aVfrom 1977 to the present day.
p21
aVIt represented the biggest cache
p22
aVof inside information into the tax haven system
p23
aVthat anyone had ever seen.
p24
aVBut it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism.
p25
aVThink about it: 11.5 million documents,
p26
aVcontaining the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries.
p27
aVWhere do you start with such a vast resource?
p28
aVWhere do you even begin to tell a story
p29
aVthat can trail off into every corner of the globe,
p30
aVand that can affect almost any person in any language,
p31
aVsometimes in ways they don't even know yet.
p32
aa(lp33
VJohn Doe had given the information to two journalists
p34
aVat the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
p35
aVHe said he was motivated by \u2014 and I quote \u2014
p36
aV"The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal."
p37
aVBut one user alone can never make sense
p38
aVof such a vast amount of information.
p39
aVSo the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out
p40
aVto my organization in Washington, DC,
p41
aVThe International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
p42
aVWe decided to do something that was the very opposite
p43
aVof everything we'd been taught to do as journalists:
p44
aVshare.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VBy nature, investigative reporters are lone wolves.
p49
aVWe fiercely guard our secrets,
p50
aVat times even from our editors,
p51
aVbecause we know that the moment we tell them what we have,
p52
aVthey'll want that story right away.
p53
aVAnd to be frank,
p54
aVwhen you get a good story,
p55
aVyou like to keep the glory to yourself.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut there's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world,
p58
aVand that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this.
p59
aVThe issues we report on are more and more transnational.
p60
aVGiant corporations operate on a global level.
p61
aVEnvironmental and health crises are global.
p62
aVSo, too, are financial flows and financial crises.
p63
aVSo it seems staggering that journalism has been so late
p64
aVto cover stories in a truly global way.
p65
aVAnd it also seems staggering that journalism has been so slow
p66
aVto wake up to the possibilities that technology brings,
p67
aVrather than being frightened of it.
p68
aVThe reason journalists are scared of technology is this:
p69
aVthe profession's largest institutions are going through tough times
p70
aVbecause of the changing way that people are consuming news.
p71
aVThe advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken.
p72
aVAnd this has plunged journalism into crisis,
p73
aVforcing those institutions to reexamine how they function.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut where there is crisis,
p76
aVthere is also opportunity.
p77
aVThe first challenge presented
p78
aVby what would eventually become known as the Panama Papers
p79
aVwas to make the documents searchable and readable.
p80
aVThere were nearly five million emails,
p81
aVtwo million PDFs that needed to be scanned and indexed,
p82
aVand millions more files and other kinds of documents.
p83
aVThey all needed to be housed in a safe and secure location
p84
aVin the cloud.
p85
aVWe next invited reporters to have a look at the documents.
p86
aVIn all, reporters from more than 100 media organizations
p87
aVin 76 countries \u2014
p88
aVfrom the BBC in Britain
p89
aVto Le Monde newspaper in France
p90
aVto the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.
p91
aV"Native eyes on native names," we called it, the idea being,
p92
aVwho best to tell you who was important to Nigeria
p93
aVthan a Nigerian journalist?
p94
aVWho best in Canada than a Canadian?
p95
aVThere were only two rules for everyone who was invited:
p96
aVwe all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else,
p97
aVand we all agreed to publish together on the same day.
p98
aa(lp99
VWe chose our media partners based on trust
p100
aVthat had been built up through previous smaller collaborations
p101
aVand also from leads that jumped out from the documents.
p102
aVOver the next few months,
p103
aVmy small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people
p104
aVwas joined by more than 350 other reporters from 25 language groups.
p105
aVThe biggest information leak in history
p106
aVhad now spawned the biggest journalism collaboration in history:
p107
aV376 sets of native eyes doing what journalists normally never do,
p108
aVworking shoulder to shoulder,
p109
aVsharing information,
p110
aVbut telling no one.
p111
aVFor it became clear at this point
p112
aVthat in order to make the biggest kind of noise,
p113
aVwe first needed the biggest kind of silence.
p114
aa(lp115
VTo manage the project over the many months it would take,
p116
aVwe built a secure virtual newsroom.
p117
aVWe used encrypted communication systems,
p118
aVand we built a specially designed search engine.
p119
aVInside the virtual newsroom,
p120
aVthe reporters could gather around the themes
p121
aVthat were emerging from the documents.
p122
aVThose interested in blood diamonds or exotic art, for instance,
p123
aVcould share information about how the offshore world was being used
p124
aVto hide the trade in both of those commodities.
p125
aVThose interested in sport could share information
p126
aVabout how famous sports stars were putting their image rights
p127
aVinto offshore companies,
p128
aVthereby likely avoiding taxes
p129
aVin the countries where they plied their trade.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut perhaps most exciting of all
p132
aVwere the number of world leaders and elect politicians
p133
aVthat were emerging from the documents \u2014
p134
aVfigures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine,
p135
aVclose associates of Vladimir Putin in Russia
p136
aVand the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who is linked
p137
aVthrough his late father, Ian Cameron.
p138
aa(lp139
VBuried in the documents were secret offshore entities,
p140
aVsuch as Wintris Inc.,
p141
aVa company in the British Virgin Islands
p142
aVthat had actually belonged to the sitting Icelandic prime minister.
p143
aVI like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,
p144
aVthe Icelandic reporter we invited to join the project,
p145
aVas the loneliest man in the world.
p146
aVFor nine months, he refused paid work
p147
aVand lived off the earnings of his wife.
p148
aVHe pasted tarps over the windows of his home
p149
aVto prevent prying eyes during the long Icelandic winter.
p150
aVAnd he soon ran out of excuses to explain his many absences,
p151
aVas he worked red-eyed,
p152
aVnight after night,
p153
aVmonth after month.
p154
aVIn all that time, he sat on information
p155
aVthat would eventually bring down the leader of his country.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, when you're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery,
p158
aVsuch as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company,
p159
aVthat that company has a financial interest in Icelandic banks \u2014
p160
aVthe very issue he's been elected on \u2014
p161
aVwell, your instinct is to scream out very loud.
p162
aVInstead, as one of the few people that he could speak to,
p163
aVJohannes and I shared a kind of gallows humor.
p164
aV"Wintris is coming," he used to say.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
V(Applause)
p169
aa(lp170
VWe were big fans of "Game of Thrones."
p171
aa(lp172
VWhen reporters like Johannes wanted to scream,
p173
aVthey did so inside the virtual newsroom,
p174
aVand then they turned those screams into stories
p175
aVby going outside the documents to court records,
p176
aVofficial company registers,
p177
aVand by eventually putting questions to those that we intended to name.
p178
aVPanama Papers actually allowed the reporters to look at the world
p179
aVthrough a different lens from everybody else.
p180
aa(lp181
VAs we were researching the story,
p182
aVunconnected to us,
p183
aVa major political bribery scandal happened in Brazil.
p184
aVA new leader was elected in Argentina.
p185
aVThe FBI began to indict officials at FIFA,
p186
aVthe organization that controls the world of professional soccer.
p187
aVThe Panama Papers actually had unique insights
p188
aVinto each one of these unfolding events.
p189
aVSo you can imagine the pressure and the ego dramas
p190
aVthat could have ruined what we were trying to do.
p191
aVAny of one of these journalists,
p192
aVthey could have broken the pact.
p193
aVBut they didn't.
p194
aVAnd on April 3 this year,
p195
aVat exactly 8pm German time,
p196
aVwe published simultaneously in 76 countries.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Applause)
p199
aa(lp200
VThe Panama Papers quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year.
p201
aVThis is the scene in Iceland the day after we published.
p202
aVIt was the first of many protests.
p203
aVThe Icelandic prime minister had to resign.
p204
aVIt was a first of many resignations.
p205
aVWe spotlighted many famous people such as Lionel Messi,
p206
aVthe most famous soccer player in the world.
p207
aVAnd there were some unintended consequences.
p208
aVThese alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested
p209
aVafter we published details about their hideout.
p210
aVThey'd been using the address
p211
aVto register their offshore company.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VThere's a kind of irony in what we've been able to do.
p216
aVThe technology \u2014 the Internet \u2014 that has broken the business model
p217
aVis allowing us to reinvent journalism itself.
p218
aVAnd this dynamic is producing
p219
aVunprecedented levels of transparency and impact.
p220
aVWe showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world
p221
aVby applying new methods and old-fashioned journalism techniques
p222
aVto vast amounts of leaked information.
p223
aVWe put all-important context around what was given to us by John Doe.
p224
aVAnd by sharing resources,
p225
aVwe were able to dig deep \u2014
p226
aVmuch deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days,
p227
aVbecause of financial concerns.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow, it was a big risk,
p230
aVand it wouldn't work for every story,
p231
aVbut we showed with the Panama Papers
p232
aVthat you can write about any country from just about anywhere,
p233
aVand then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work.
p234
aVTry obtaining a court injunction
p235
aVthat would prevent the telling of a story in 76 different countries.
p236
aVTry stopping the inevitable.
p237
aa(lp238
VShortly after we published, I got a three-word text from Johannes:
p239
aV"Wintris has arrived."
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VIt had arrived and so, too, perhaps has a new era for journalism.
p244
aa(lp245
VThank you.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Applause)
p248
aa(lp249
VBruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.
p250
aa(lp251
VI guess you're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists
p252
aVwho worked with you, right?
p253
aa(lp254
VNow, a couple of questions I would like to ask.
p255
aVThe first one is,
p256
aVyou'd been working in secrecy for over a year
p257
aVwith 350-something colleagues from all over the world \u2014
p258
aVwas there ever a moment when you thought
p259
aVthat the leak may be leaked,
p260
aVthat the collaboration may just be broken
p261
aVby somebody publishing a story?
p262
aVOr somebody not in the group releasing some information
p263
aVthat they got to know?
p264
aa(lp265
VGerard Ryle: We had a series of crises along the way,
p266
aVincluding when something major was happening in the world,
p267
aVthe journalists from that country wanted to publish right away.
p268
aVWe had to calm them down.
p269
aVProbably the biggest crisis we had was a week before publication.
p270
aVWe'd sent a series of questions to the associates of Vladimir Putin,
p271
aVbut instead of responding,
p272
aVthe Kremlin actually held a press conference and denounced us,
p273
aVand denounced the whole thing as being, I guess, a plot from the West.
p274
aVAt that point, Putin thought it was just about him.
p275
aVAnd, of course, a lot of editors around the world
p276
aVwere very nervous about this.
p277
aVThey thought the story was going to get out.
p278
aVYou can imagine the amount of time they'd spent,
p279
aVthe amount of resources, money spent on this.
p280
aVSo I had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down,
p281
aVa bit like a general, where you're holding your troops back:
p282
aV"Calm, remain calm."
p283
aVAnd then eventually, of course, they all did.
p284
aa(lp285
VBG: And then a couple weeks ago or so,
p286
aVyou released a lot of the documents as an open database
p287
aVfor everybody to search via keyword, essentially.
p288
aa(lp289
VGR: We very much believe
p290
aVthat the basic information about the offshore world
p291
aVshould be made public.
p292
aVNow, we didn't publish the underlying documents
p293
aVof the journalists we're working with.
p294
aVBut the basic information such as the name of a person,
p295
aVwhat their offshore company was and the name of that company,
p296
aVis now all available online.
p297
aVIn fact, the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now
p298
aa(lp299
VBG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.
p300
aa(lp301
VGR: Thank you.

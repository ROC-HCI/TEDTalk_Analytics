VYou know, we wake up in the morning,
p5
aVyou get dressed, put on your shoes,
p6
aVyou head out into the world.
p7
aVYou plan on coming back, getting undressed,
p8
aVgoing to bed,
p9
aVwaking up, doing it again,
p10
aVand that anticipation, that rhythm,
p11
aVhelps give us a structure
p12
aVto how we organize ourselves and our lives,
p13
aVand gives it a measure of predictability.
p14
aVLiving in New York City, as I do,
p15
aVit's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things
p16
aVat the same time in such close quarters,
p17
aVit's almost like life is dealing you extra hands
p18
aVout of that deck.
p19
aVYou're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible
p20
aVthat just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen.
p21
aVAnd you never think you're going to be the guy
p22
aVwho's walking down the street
p23
aVand, because you choose to go down one side or the other,
p24
aVthe rest of your life is changed forever.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd one night, I'm riding the uptown local train.
p27
aVI get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant
p28
aVwhen I get on the subway.
p29
aVI'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones
p30
aVor a book.
p31
aVAnd I get on the car, and I look, and I
p32
aVnotice this couple,
p33
aVcollege-aged, student-looking kids,
p34
aVa guy and a girl, and they're sitting next to each other,
p35
aVand she's got her leg draped over his knee,
p36
aVand they're doing \u2014 they have this little contraption,
p37
aVand they're tying these knots,
p38
aVand they're doing it with one hand,
p39
aVthey're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly,
p40
aVand then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it.
p41
aVI've never seen anything like this.
p42
aVIt's almost like they're practicing magic tricks.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd at the next stop, a guy gets on the car,
p45
aVand he has this sort of visiting professor look to him.
p46
aVHe's got the overstuffed leather satchel
p47
aVand the rectangular file case and a laptop bag
p48
aVand the tweed jacket with the leather patches,
p49
aVand \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p50
aVhe looks at them, and then
p51
aVin a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them,
p52
aVand he starts to say,
p53
aV"You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look,
p54
aVif you do this \u2014 " and he takes the laces out of their hand,
p55
aVand instantly, he starts tying these knots,
p56
aVand even better than they were doing it, remarkably.
p57
aVAnd it turns out they are medical students
p58
aVon their way to a lecture about the latest
p59
aVsuturing techniques, and he's the guy giving the lecture.
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo he starts to tell them, and he's like,
p63
aV"No, this is very important here. You know,
p64
aVwhen you're needing these knots,
p65
aVit's going to be, you know, everything's
p66
aVgoing to be happening at the same time, it's going to be \u2014
p67
aVyou're going to have all this information coming at you,
p68
aVthere's going to be organs getting in the way,
p69
aVit's going to be slippery,
p70
aVand
p71
aVit's just very important that you be able to do these
p72
aVbeyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand,
p73
aVyou have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers."
p74
aVAnd at that moment, when I heard that,
p75
aVI just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night
p76
aVwhen I had been getting a ride in an ambulance
p77
aVfrom the sidewalk where I had been stabbed
p78
aVto the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan,
p79
aVand what had happened was
p80
aVa gang had come in from Brooklyn.
p81
aVAs part of an initiation for three of their members,
p82
aVthey had to kill somebody,
p83
aVand I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street
p84
aVthat night,
p85
aVand they jumped on me without a word.
p86
aVOne of the very lucky things,
p87
aVwhen I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team,
p88
aVso I put my hands up right away, instinctively.
p89
aVThe guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade,
p90
aVand he went in under my elbow,
p91
aVand it went up and cut my inferior vena cava.
p92
aVIf you know anything about anatomy,
p93
aVthat's not a good thing to get cut,
p94
aVand everything, of course, on the way up,
p95
aVand then \u2014 I still had my hands up \u2014
p96
aVhe pulled it out and went for my neck,
p97
aVand sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck,
p98
aVand I got one straight right punch
p99
aVand knocked the middle guy out.
p100
aVThe other guy was still working on me,
p101
aVcollapsing my other lung,
p102
aVand I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute.
p103
aVI ran down the street and collapsed,
p104
aVand the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk
p105
aVand let the trauma room know
p106
aVthey had an incoming.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd one of the
p109
aVside effects of having major massive blood loss
p110
aVis you get tunnel vision,
p111
aVso I remember being on the stretcher
p112
aVand having a little nickel-sized cone of vision,
p113
aVand I was moving my head around
p114
aVand we got to St. Vincent's,
p115
aVand we're racing down this hallway,
p116
aVand I see the lights going,
p117
aVand it's a peculiar effect of memories like that.
p118
aVThey don't really go to the usual place that memories go.
p119
aVThey kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def,
p120
aVand George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter)
p121
aVSo sometimes, remembering them, it's like,
p122
aVit's not like any other kind of memories.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd I get into the trauma room,
p125
aVand they're waiting for me, and the lights are there,
p126
aVand I'd been able to breathe a little more now,
p127
aVbecause the blood has left, had been filling up my lungs
p128
aVand I was having a very hard time breathing,
p129
aVbut now it's kind of gone into the stretcher.
p130
aVAnd I said, "Is there anything I can do to help?"
p131
aVand \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p132
aVthe nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and
p133
aVI'm turning my head trying to see everybody,
p134
aVand I had this weird memory of being in college
p135
aVand raising,
p136
aVraising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh,
p137
aVand then I look over and my anesthesiologist
p138
aVis clamping the mask on me, and I think,
p139
aV"He looks Bangladeshi," \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p140
aVand I just have those two facts, and I just think,
p141
aV"This could work somehow." (Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd then I go out, and
p144
aVthey work on me for the rest of the night,
p145
aVand I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there
p146
aVwhile they did their work,
p147
aVand the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines,
p148
aVmy cecum, organs I didn't know that I had,
p149
aVand he later told me one of the last things he did
p150
aVwhile he was in there was to remove my appendix for me,
p151
aVwhich I thought was great, you know,
p152
aVjust a little tidy thing there at the end. (Laughter)
p153
aVAnd I came to in the morning.
p154
aVOut of anesthetic, he had let them know
p155
aVthat he wanted to be there, and he had given me
p156
aVabout a two percent chance of living.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo he was there when I woke up,
p159
aVand it was, waking up was like
p160
aVbreaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain.
p161
aVIt was that enveloping,
p162
aVand there was only one spot that didn't hurt
p163
aVworse than anything I'd ever felt,
p164
aVand it was my instep,
p165
aVand he was holding the arch of my foot
p166
aVand rubbing the instep with his thumb.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd I looked up, and he's like,
p169
aV"Good to see you,"
p170
aVand I was trying to remember what had happened
p171
aVand trying to get my head around everything,
p172
aVand the pain was just overwhelming, and he said,
p173
aV"You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought
p174
aVyou might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson,
p175
aVand you're going to need all the strength you can get."
p176
aVAnd in those days, my hair was down to my waist,
p177
aVI drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried,
p178
aVI owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VBut
p181
aVI had three days of life support,
p182
aVand everybody was expecting,
p183
aVdue to just the massive amount of what they had had to do
p184
aVthat I wasn't going to make it,
p185
aVso it was three days of
p186
aVeverybody was either waiting for me to die or poop,
p187
aVand \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p188
aVwhen I finally pooped, then that somehow,
p189
aVsurgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line,
p190
aVand, um \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p191
aVon that day, the surgeon came in
p192
aVand whipped the sheet off of me.
p193
aVHe had three or four friends with him,
p194
aVand he does that, and they all look,
p195
aVand there was no infection,
p196
aVand they bend over me and they're poking and prodding,
p197
aVand they're like, "There's no hematomas, blah blah,
p198
aVlook at the color," and they're talking amongst themselves
p199
aVand I'm, like, this restored automobile
p200
aVthat he's just going, "Yeah, I did that." (Laughter)
p201
aVAnd it was just,
p202
aVit was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving him
p203
aVover how good I turned out, you know? (Laughter)
p204
aVAnd it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in
p205
aVand everything.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd
p208
aVlater on, when I got out
p209
aVand the flashbacks and the
p210
aVnightmares were giving me a hard time,
p211
aVI went back to him
p212
aVand I was sort of asking him,
p213
aVyou know, what am I gonna do?
p214
aVAnd I think, kind of, as a surgeon, he basically said,
p215
aV"Kid, I saved your life.
p216
aVLike, now you can do whatever you want, like,
p217
aVyou gotta get on with that.
p218
aVIt's like I gave you a new car
p219
aVand you're complaining about not finding parking.
p220
aVLike, just, go out, and, you know, do your best.
p221
aVBut you're alive. That's what it's about."
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd then I hear, "Bing-bong," and the subway doors
p224
aVare closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids,
p225
aVand I go, I think to myself,
p226
aV"I'm going to lift my shirt up
p227
aVand show them," \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p228
aVand then I think, "No, this is the New York City subway,
p229
aVthat's going to lead to other things." (Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd so I just think, they got their lecture to go to.
p232
aVI step off, I'm standing on the platform,
p233
aVand I feel my index finger
p234
aVin
p235
aVthe first scar that I ever got,
p236
aVfrom my umbilical cord,
p237
aVand then around that, is traced
p238
aVthe last scar that I got
p239
aVfrom my surgeon,
p240
aVand I think that, that chance encounter
p241
aVwith those kids on the street with their knives
p242
aVled me
p243
aVto my surgical team,
p244
aVand their training
p245
aVand their skill
p246
aVand, always, a little bit of luck
p247
aVpushed back against chaos.
p248
aa(lp249
VThank you. (Applause)
p250
aV(Applause)
p251
aVThank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you. (Applause)

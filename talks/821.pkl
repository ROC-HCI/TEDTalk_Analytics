VThank you. I have two missions here today.
p5
aVThe first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,
p6
aVand to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.
p7
aVAnd, secondly, to convince you
p8
aVthat every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVPollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.
p11
aVIt carries male sex cells
p12
aVfrom one flower to another.
p13
aVThis gives us genetic diversity,
p14
aVor at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.
p15
aVAnd it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.
p16
aVThat's probably true of humans as well, mostly.
p17
aa(lp18
VPollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.
p19
aVEach anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen,
p20
aVso, it's quite prolific stuff.
p21
aVAnd it isn't just bright flowers
p22
aVthat have pollen; it's also trees and grasses.
p23
aVAnd remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well.
p24
aa(lp25
VHere is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.
p26
aVThe little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later,
p27
aVbut that's for the pollen tube
p28
aVto come out later on. A very tiny tube.
p29
aVSo, that's 20 micrometers across,
p30
aVthat pollen grain there.
p31
aVThat's about a 50th of a millimeter.
p32
aVBut not all pollen is quite so simple looking.
p33
aa(lp34
VThis is Morina. This is a plant \u2014
p35
aVwhich I've always thought to be rather tedious \u2014
p36
aVnamed after Morin,
p37
aVwho was an enterprising French gardener,
p38
aVwho issued the first seed catalog
p39
aVin 1621.
p40
aVBut anyway, take a look at its pollen.
p41
aVThis is amazing, I think.
p42
aVThat little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube,
p43
aVand when the pollen finds its special female spot
p44
aVin another Morina flower,
p45
aVjust on the right species, what happens?
p46
aVLike I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.
p47
aVIf you actually didn't realize that plants have sex,
p48
aVthey have rampant, promiscuous
p49
aVand really quite interesting and curious sex. Really.
p50
aV(Laughter) A lot.
p51
aa(lp52
VMy story is actually not about plant propagation,
p53
aVbut about pollen itself.
p54
aV"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.
p55
aVFirst of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.
p56
aVIt's also very biologically active,
p57
aVas anyone with hay fever will understand.
p58
aVNow, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed \u2014
p59
aVlike trees and grasses and so on \u2014
p60
aVtend to cause the most hay fever.
p61
aVAnd the reason for that is they've got to chuck out
p62
aVmasses and masses of pollen to have any chance
p63
aVof the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.
p64
aa(lp65
VHere are some examples \u2014
p66
aVthey're very smooth if you look at them \u2014
p67
aVof tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.
p68
aVAgain \u2014 this time, sycamore \u2014 wind-dispersed.
p69
aVSo, trees: very boring flowers,
p70
aVnot really trying to attract insects.
p71
aVCool pollen, though.
p72
aVThis one I particularly like.
p73
aVThis is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks
p74
aVto make the pollen carry even further.
p75
aVRemember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.
p78
aVThis is a bee's leg
p79
aVwith the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.
p80
aVAnd this is the outrageous and beautiful
p81
aVflower of the mangrove palm.
p82
aVVery showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.
p83
aVThe pollen has little barbs on it,
p84
aVif we look.
p85
aVNow, those little barbs
p86
aVobviously stick to the insects well,
p87
aVbut there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,
p88
aVand that is that you might be able to see a fracture line
p89
aVacross what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.
p90
aVThat tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.
p91
aVAnd I'm rather proud to say
p92
aVthat this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago
p93
aVLondon was full of mangroves.
p94
aVIsn't that cool?
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VOkay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects.
p98
aVYou can tell that from the little barbs on there.
p99
aVAll these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,
p100
aVactually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.
p101
aVNo coincidence that these were taken
p102
aVby Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,
p103
aVand I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye
p104
aVlike him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VNow, all this diversity
p108
aVmeans that you can look at a pollen grain
p109
aVand tell what species it came from,
p110
aVand that's actually quite handy if you
p111
aVmaybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.
p112
aVSo, different species of plants
p113
aVgrow in different places,
p114
aVand some pollen carries further than others.
p115
aVSo, if you have a pollen sample,
p116
aVthen in principle, you should be able to tell
p117
aVwhere that sample came from.
p118
aVAnd this is where it gets interesting for forensics.
p119
aa(lp120
VPollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.
p121
aVSo, not only does each type of pollen look different,
p122
aVbut each habitat has a different combination of plants.
p123
aVA different pollen signature, if you like,
p124
aVor a different pollen fingerprint.
p125
aVBy looking at the proportions and combinations
p126
aVof different kinds of pollen in a sample,
p127
aVyou can tell very precisely where it came from.
p128
aVThis is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,
p129
aVsimilar to the one that I'm wearing now.
p130
aVNow, much of the pollen will still be there
p131
aVafter repeated washings.
p132
aVWhere has it been?
p133
aVFour very different habitats might look similar,
p134
aVbut they've got very different pollen signatures.
p135
aVActually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken
p136
aVin different countries.
p137
aa(lp138
VBut pollen forensics can be very subtle.
p139
aVIt's being used now to track
p140
aVwhere counterfeit drugs have been made,
p141
aVwhere banknotes have come from,
p142
aVto look at the provenance of antiques
p143
aVand see that they really did come from the place
p144
aVthe seller said they did.
p145
aVAnd murder suspects have been tracked
p146
aVusing their clothing,
p147
aVcertainly in the U.K., to within an area
p148
aVthat's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs
p149
aVto find the murder victim.
p150
aVSo, you can tell from a piece of clothing
p151
aVto within about a kilometer or so,
p152
aVwhere that piece of clothing has been recently
p153
aVand then send in dogs.
p154
aVAnd finally, in a rather grizzly way,
p155
aVthe Bosnia war crimes;
p156
aVsome of the people brought to trial were brought to trial
p157
aVbecause of the evidence from pollen,
p158
aVwhich showed that bodies had been buried,
p159
aVexhumed and then reburied somewhere else.
p160
aa(lp161
VI hope I've opened your eyes,
p162
aVif you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter)
p163
aVto some of pollen's secrets.
p164
aVThis is a horse chestnut.
p165
aVThere is an invisible beauty all around us,
p166
aVeach grain with a story to tell ...
p167
aVeach of us, in fact, with a story to tell
p168
aVfrom the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.
p169
aVThank you to the colleagues at Kew,
p170
aVand thank you to palynologists everywhere.
p171
aV(Applause)

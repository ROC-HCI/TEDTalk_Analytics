VI'd like to speak about technology trends,
p5
aVwhich is something that many of you follow \u2014
p6
aVbut we also follow, for related reasons.
p7
aVObviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends
p8
aVare something that we write about and need to know about.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut also it's part of being any monthly magazine \u2014
p11
aVyou live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.
p12
aVWe have to plan issues many months in advance;
p13
aVwe have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,
p14
aVnine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
p15
aa(lp16
VWe also, like a lot of companies, create a product
p17
aVthat's based on technology trends.
p18
aVIn this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,
p19
aVsome entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.
p20
aVAnd so we have to understand
p21
aVnot only why tech's important, where it's going,
p22
aVbut also, very importantly, when \u2014 the timing is everything.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made
p25
aVduring the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,
p26
aVor Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,
p27
aVthey were all right \u2014 they were just wrong in time.
p28
aVAlmost every one of those has come true just a few years later.
p29
aVBut the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations
p30
aVis obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.
p31
aa(lp32
VYou've probably seen something like this before.
p33
aVThis is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about
p34
aVkind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.
p35
aVAnd just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,
p36
aVto show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,
p37
aVor whether they were about to crash
p38
aVinto the trough of disillusionment,
p39
aVor rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.
p40
aVAnd this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense
p41
aVof where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.
p42
aa(lp43
VWe tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;
p44
aVwe'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.
p45
aVWe want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,
p46
aVwe'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.
p47
aVYou can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.
p48
aVBut then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies
p49
aVare going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.
p50
aVAnd then it's time to do it again. Last year.
p51
aVAnd that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
p52
aa(lp53
VI'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends
p54
aVthat I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future,"
p55
aVbut it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
p56
aVIt's based on the presumption, the observation even,
p57
aVthat all important technologies go through four stages in their life \u2014
p58
aVat least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.
p59
aVAnd at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision \u2014
p60
aVa collision with something else \u2014
p61
aVfor example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology
p62
aVand also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.
p63
aVAnd these are the inflection points that tell you
p64
aVwhat the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,
p65
aVand maybe how you can do something about it.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe first is the critical price.
p68
aVThe first stage in a technology's advance
p69
aVis that it'll fall below a critical price.
p70
aVAfter it falls below a critical price, it will tend,
p71
aVif it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.
p72
aVMany technologies, at that point, displace another technology,
p73
aVand that's another important point.
p74
aVAnd then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.
p75
aVTowards the end of their life, they become nearly free.
p76
aa(lp77
VEach one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;
p78
aVit's an opportunity for the technology to change.
p79
aVAnd even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi \u2014
p80
aVyou know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,
p81
aVbut hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet \u2014
p82
aVthere's still more opportunity in that.
p83
aa(lp84
VI'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this
p85
aVby telling the story of the DVD,
p86
aVwhich is a technology which has done all of these.
p87
aVThe DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s
p88
aVand it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,
p89
aVit had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
p90
aVAnd it started to take off. And you can see that the units
p91
aVstarted to trend up, the hidden inflection point \u2014 it was taking off.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,
p94
aV20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.
p95
aVAnd what's interesting here
p96
aVis that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.
p97
aVSuddenly you have a DVD in the house;
p98
aVyou've got high-quality digital video;
p99
aVyou have a reason to have a big-screen television;
p100
aVyou have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.
p101
aVAnd maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,
p102
aVand bring the rest of your entertainment in.
p103
aVWhat's interesting also is \u2014 note that Netflix was founded in 1999.
p104
aVReed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,
p105
aVthat was an inflection point that he could do something with.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe next phase it hit was displacement.
p108
aVYou can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.
p109
aVAnd here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.
p110
aVNetflix was right \u2014 the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD
p111
aVin a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.
p112
aVAmong the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;
p113
aVyou can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.
p114
aVThat gave an advantage; that was an implication
p115
aVof the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd then finally, DVDs are approaching free.
p118
aVThere's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,
p119
aVwho has, several times in the past year, been the number-one
p120
aVDVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.
p121
aVYou're aware of the
p122
aVperhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede
p123
aVover the 30-dollar DVD.
p124
aVBut they're getting very, very cheap,
p125
aVand look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,
p126
aVthe premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,
p127
aVand the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.
p128
aVThey're being commodified, and that's what happens
p129
aVwhen things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VNow they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,
p133
aVthese four stages of technology's life.
p134
aVI'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,
p135
aVjust technologies on our radar \u2014 and I'll use this lens,
p136
aVthese four, as a way to kind of tell you
p137
aVwhere each one of those technologies is in its development.
p138
aVThey're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there \u2014
p139
aVthey're just examples of technologies
p140
aVthat are in each one of these periods.
p141
aVBut I think that the implications of them approaching
p142
aVthese crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.
p143
aa(lp144
VStart with gene sequencing.
p145
aVAs you probably know, gene sequencing \u2014 in a large part,
p146
aVbecause it's built on computers \u2014 is falling in price
p147
aVat a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.
p148
aVIt is now possible \u2014 will be possible,
p149
aVand if Craig Venter indeed comes today,
p150
aVhe may tell you something about this \u2014
p151
aVto sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.
p152
aVThat's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.
p153
aVYou know, our ability to capture the tools of creation
p154
aVis getting closer and closer.
p155
aa(lp156
VWhat's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes
p157
aVthat we're discovering is rising very quickly.
p158
aVEach one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.
p159
aVThere will come a day
p160
aVwhen you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,
p161
aVif you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.
p162
aa(lp163
VHere's another technology that's approaching a critical price.
p164
aVThis is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect
p165
aVof generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.
p166
aVIn January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.
p167
aVThe generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,
p168
aVand the effect was just dramatic on pricing.
p169
aVToday it's less than 50 cents a day.
p170
aVAnd what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,
p171
aVif you look at the correlation between these two,
p172
aVas the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat
p173
aVgoes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO
p174
aVbelieve that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 \u2014
p175
aVtwo million in sub-Saharan Africa.
p176
aVAnd the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.
p177
aa(lp178
VLinux is another good example.
p179
aVNow we've switched to critical mass.
p180
aVThese are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.
p181
aVIf you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.
p182
aVInterestingly, it's done a crossover before,
p183
aVbut not the crossovers that matter.
p184
aVThe crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.
p185
aVBut you can look and see the direction those lines are going,
p186
aVyou can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.
p187
aVIt's not just for the geeks any more.
p188
aVThat is, I imagine, what people in Redmond
p189
aVwake up in the middle of the night thinking about.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VAnother technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.
p193
aVI don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.
p194
aVAnd if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 \u2014
p195
aVand I don't think this is a crazy forecast \u2014
p196
aVthey'll be two percent of auto sales.
p197
aVTwo percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,
p198
aVwhich is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.
p199
aVAt two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd what's interesting about the hybrids taking off
p202
aVis you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.
p203
aVIt's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.
p204
aVAnd once you have electric motors, you can do anything:
p205
aVyou can change the structure of the car in any way you want.
p206
aVYou can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;
p207
aVyou can have replaceable body shapes \u2014
p208
aVit's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,
p209
aVbut it can lead to a whole new era of the car.
p210
aa(lp211
VVoice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.
p212
aVAgain, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;
p213
aVit's a little hard to use right now.
p214
aVThere's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.
p215
aVLook at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;
p216
aVthey already have nearly four million registered users \u2014
p217
aVthat's critical mass.
p218
aVAnd the same thing's happening on the carrier side.
p219
aVYou're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional
p220
aVtelecom standards. This is a tipping point \u2014
p221
aVif Malcolm's here, forgive me \u2014 and it's going to change the economics,
p222
aVand the speed, and the players in the industry.
p223
aVIt's going to look a little bit like that.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.
p226
aVFree is something that comes with digital, because
p227
aVthe reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,
p228
aVbecause it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,
p229
aVbecause there's so much bandwidth.
p230
aVFree is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.
p231
aVIt's an economic force; it's a technical force.
p232
aVIt's a deflationary force, if not handled right.
p233
aVIt is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.
p234
aVFree is probably the most interesting thing.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd here you have just the number of songs
p237
aVthat can be stored on a hard drive.
p238
aVYou know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,
p239
aVbut it's basically, every song ever made could be stored
p240
aVon 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,
p241
aVthe physical element, of songs off the table.
p242
aVAnd you've seen the numbers.
p243
aVI mean, you know, the music industry is imploding
p244
aVin front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.
p245
aVThey're facing a force that they haven't faced before.
p246
aVAnd their response is draconian, and not necessarily
p247
aVthe one that's going to get them out of this.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd finally, I'll give you one last example of free \u2014
p250
aVperhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics \u2014
p251
aVtheir abundance tends to make things free.
p252
aVThis is the price of a phone call to India per minute.
p253
aVAnd what's interesting is that it was just 1990
p254
aVwhen it was more than two dollars a minute.
p255
aVIndia had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.
p256
aVIt was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,
p257
aVbut then there was just so much fiber out there,
p258
aVyou couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.
p259
aVIt's seven cents a minute, in many cases.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,
p262
aVto India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.
p263
aVIt is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization
p264
aVand one of the most powerful economic tools
p265
aVthat we're seeing in our world today.
p266
aVThe force of India, and then China, and any other country
p267
aVthat can contact our markets
p268
aVand will work with our companies \u2014 because the communications are free \u2014
p269
aVis just beginning to be felt.
p270
aVAnd I think that's probably one
p271
aVof the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.
p272
aVThank you.

VI coined my own definition of success in 1934,
p5
aVwhen I was teaching at a high school in South Bend, Indiana,
p6
aVbeing a little bit disappointed, and [disillusioned] perhaps,
p7
aVby the way parents of the youngsters in my English classes
p8
aVexpected their youngsters to get an A or a B.
p9
aVThey thought a C was all right for the neighbors' children,
p10
aVbecause they were all average.
p11
aVBut they weren't satisfied when their own \u2014
p12
aVit would make the teacher feel that they had failed, or the youngster had failed.
p13
aVAnd that's not right.
p14
aVThe good Lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal
p15
aVas far as intelligence is concerned,
p16
aVany more than we're equal for size, appearance.
p17
aa(lp18
VNot everybody could earn an A or a B, and I didn't like that way of judging,
p19
aVand I did know how the alumni of various schools
p20
aVback in the '30s judged coaches and athletic teams.
p21
aVIf you won them all, you were considered to be reasonably successful \u2014
p22
aVnot completely.
p23
aVBecause I found out \u2014
p24
aVwe had a number of years at UCLA where we didn't lose a game.
p25
aVBut it seemed that we didn't win each individual game
p26
aVby the margin that some of our alumni had predicted \u2014
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVAnd quite frequently I really felt that they had backed up their predictions
p29
aVin a more materialistic manner.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VBut that was true back in the 30s, so I understood that.
p34
aVBut I didn't like it, I didn't agree with it.
p35
aVI wanted to come up with something I hoped could make me a better teacher,
p36
aVand give the youngsters under my supervision,
p37
aVbe it in athletics or the English classroom,
p38
aVsomething to which to aspire,
p39
aVother than just a higher mark in the classroom,
p40
aVor more points in some athletic contest.
p41
aa(lp42
VI thought about that for quite a spell,
p43
aVand I wanted to come up with my own definition.
p44
aVI thought that might help.
p45
aVAnd I knew how Mr. Webster defined it,
p46
aVas the accumulation of material possessions
p47
aVor the attainment of a position of power or prestige, or something of that sort,
p48
aVworthy accomplishments perhaps,
p49
aVbut in my opinion, not necessarily indicative of success.
p50
aVSo I wanted to come up with something of my own.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd I recalled \u2014
p53
aVI was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana,
p54
aVand Dad tried to teach me and my brothers
p55
aVthat you should never try to be better than someone else.
p56
aVI'm sure at the time he did that, I didn't \u2014 it didn't \u2014
p57
aVwell, somewhere, I guess in the hidden recesses of the mind,
p58
aVit popped out years later.
p59
aVNever try to be better than someone else,
p60
aValways learn from others.
p61
aVNever cease trying to be the best you can be \u2014
p62
aVthat's under your control.
p63
aVIf you get too engrossed and involved and concerned
p64
aVin regard to the things over which you have no control,
p65
aVit will adversely affect the things over which you have control.
p66
aVThen I ran across this simple verse that said,
p67
aV"At God's footstool to confess,
p68
aVa poor soul knelt, and bowed his head.
p69
aV'I failed!' he cried.
p70
aVThe Master said, 'Thou didst thy best, that is success.'"
p71
aa(lp72
VFrom those things, and one other perhaps,
p73
aVI coined my own definition of success, which is:
p74
aVPeace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction
p75
aVin knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable.
p76
aVI believe that's true.
p77
aVIf you make the effort to do the best of which you're capable,
p78
aVtrying to improve the situation that exists for you,
p79
aVI think that's success,
p80
aVand I don't think others can judge that;
p81
aVit's like character and reputation \u2014
p82
aVyour reputation is what you're perceived to be;
p83
aVyour character is what you really are.
p84
aVAnd I think that character is much more important
p85
aVthan what you are perceived to be.
p86
aVYou'd hope they'd both be good,
p87
aVbut they won't necessarily be the same.
p88
aVWell, that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters.
p89
aa(lp90
VI ran across other things.
p91
aVI love to teach, and it was mentioned by the previous speaker
p92
aVthat I enjoy poetry, and I dabble in it a bit, and love it.
p93
aVThere are some things that helped me, I think,
p94
aVbe better than I would have been.
p95
aVI know I'm not what I ought to be, what I should be,
p96
aVbut I think I'm better than I would have been
p97
aVif I hadn't run across certain things.
p98
aVOne was just a little verse that said,
p99
aa(lp100
V"No written word, no spoken plea
p101
aVcan teach our youth what they should be;
p102
aVnor all the books on all the shelves \u2014
p103
aVit's what the teachers are themselves."
p104
aa(lp105
VThat made an impression on me in the 1930s.
p106
aVAnd I tried to use that more or less in my teaching,
p107
aVwhether it be in sports, or whether it be in the English classroom.
p108
aVI love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow.
p109
aVMaybe it's because Dad used to read to us at night,
p110
aVby coal oil lamp \u2014
p111
aVwe didn't have electricity in our farm home.
p112
aVAnd Dad would read poetry to us. So I always liked it.
p113
aVAnd about the same time I ran across this one verse,
p114
aVI ran across another one.
p115
aVSomeone asked a lady teacher why she taught,
p116
aVand after some time, she said she wanted to think about that.
p117
aVThen she came up and said,
p118
aa(lp119
V"They ask me why I teach, and I reply,
p120
aV'Where could I find such splendid company?'
p121
aVThere sits a statesman, strong, unbiased, wise;
p122
aVanother Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.
p123
aVA doctor sits beside him, whose quick, steady hand may mend a bone,
p124
aVor stem the life-blood's flow.
p125
aVAnd there a builder; upward rise the arch of a church he builds,
p126
aVwherein that minister may speak the word of God,
p127
aVand lead a stumbling soul to touch the Christ.
p128
aVAnd all about, a gathering of teachers,
p129
aVfarmers, merchants, laborers \u2014
p130
aVthose who work and vote and build
p131
aVand plan and pray into a great tomorrow.
p132
aVAnd I may say, I may not see the church,
p133
aVor hear the word, or eat the food their hands may grow,
p134
aVbut yet again I may;
p135
aVAnd later I may say,
p136
aVI knew him once, and he was weak, or strong, or bold or proud or gay.
p137
aVI knew him once, but then he was a boy.
p138
aVThey ask me why I teach and I reply,
p139
aV'Where could I find such splendid company?'"
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd I believe the teaching profession \u2014
p142
aVit's true, you have so many youngsters,
p143
aVand I've got to think of my youngsters at UCLA \u2014
p144
aV30-some attorneys, 11 dentists and doctors,
p145
aVmany, many teachers and other professions.
p146
aVAnd that gives you a great deal of pleasure,
p147
aVto see them go on.
p148
aVI always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education,
p149
aVnumber one; basketball was second, because it was paying their way,
p150
aVand they do need a little time for social activities,
p151
aVbut you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two,
p152
aVand you're not going to have any very long.
p153
aVSo that was the idea that I tried to get across
p154
aVto the youngsters under my supervision.
p155
aa(lp156
VI had three rules, pretty much,
p157
aVthat I stuck with practically all the time.
p158
aVI'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA, and I decided they were very important.
p159
aVOne was "Never be late."
p160
aVLater on I said certain things \u2014
p161
aVthe players, if we were leaving for somewhere, had to be neat and clean.
p162
aVThere was a time when I made them wear jackets and shirts and ties.
p163
aVThen I saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks,
p164
aVand thought, it's not right for me to keep this other [rule] so I let them just \u2014
p165
aVthey had to be neat and clean.
p166
aVI had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of, Bill Walton.
p167
aVHe came to catch the bus; we were leaving for somewhere to play.
p168
aVAnd he wasn't clean and neat, so I wouldn't let him go.
p169
aVHe couldn't get on the bus,
p170
aVhe had to go home and get cleaned up
p171
aVto get to the airport.
p172
aVSo I was a stickler for that. I believed in that.
p173
aVI believe in time; very important.
p174
aVI believe you should be on time, but I felt at practice, for example \u2014
p175
aVwe start on time, we close on time.
p176
aVThe youngsters didn't have to feel that we were going to keep them over.
p177
aa(lp178
VWhen I speak at coaching clinics, I often tell young coaches \u2014
p179
aVand at coaching clinics, more or less,
p180
aVthey'll be the younger coaches getting in the profession.
p181
aVMost of them are young, you know, and probably newly-married.
p182
aVAnd I tell them, "Don't run practices late,
p183
aVbecause you'll go home in a bad mood,
p184
aVand that's not good, for a young married man to go home in a bad mood.
p185
aVWhen you get older, it doesn't make any difference, but \u2014"
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VSo I did believe: on time.
p190
aa(lp191
VI believe starting on time, and I believe closing on time.
p192
aVAnd another one I had was, not one word of profanity.
p193
aVOne word of profanity, and you are out of here for the day.
p194
aVIf I see it in a game, you're going to come out and sit on the bench.
p195
aVAnd the third one was, never criticize a teammate.
p196
aVI didn't want that. I used to tell them I was paid to do that.
p197
aVThat's my job. I'm paid to do it. Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.
p198
aVNot like the coaches today, for gracious sakes, no.
p199
aVIt's a little different than it was in my day.
p200
aVThose were three things that I stuck with pretty closely all the time.
p201
aVAnd those actually came from my dad.
p202
aVThat's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time.
p203
aa(lp204
VI came up with a pyramid eventually,
p205
aVthat I don't have the time to go on that.
p206
aVBut that helped me, I think, become a better teacher.
p207
aVIt's something like this:
p208
aVAnd I had blocks in the pyramid,
p209
aVand the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm,
p210
aVworking hard and enjoying what you're doing,
p211
aVcoming up to the apex,
p212
aVaccording to my definition of success.
p213
aVAnd right at the top, faith and patience.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd I say to you, in whatever you're doing,
p216
aVyou must be patient.
p217
aVYou have to have patience to \u2014 we want things to happen.
p218
aVWe talk about our youth being impatient a lot, and they are.
p219
aVThey want to change everything. They think all change is progress.
p220
aVAnd we get a little older \u2014 we sort of let things go.
p221
aVAnd we forget there is no progress without change.
p222
aVSo you must have patience,
p223
aVand I believe that we must have faith.
p224
aVI believe that we must believe, truly believe.
p225
aVNot just give it word service,
p226
aVbelieve that things will work out as they should,
p227
aVproviding we do what we should.
p228
aVI think our tendency is to hope things will turn out the way we want them to
p229
aVmuch of the time,
p230
aVbut we don't do the things that are necessary
p231
aVto make those things become reality.
p232
aVI worked on this for some 14 years,
p233
aVand I think it helped me become a better teacher.
p234
aVBut it all revolved around that original definition of success.
p235
aa(lp236
VYou know, a number of years ago,
p237
aVthere was a Major League Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty.
p238
aVHe spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'.
p239
aVI'd never seen that before, but he did.
p240
aVBig league baseball players \u2014
p241
aVthey're very perceptive about those things,
p242
aVand they noticed he had only one 'i' in his name.
p243
aVYou'd be surprised how many also told him
p244
aVthat that was one more than he had in his head
p245
aVat various times.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VBut he wrote something where I think he did
p250
aVwhat I tried to do in this pyramid.
p251
aVHe called it "The Road Ahead, or the Road Behind."
p252
aVHe said, "Sometimes I think the Fates must grin as we denounce them and insist
p253
aVthe only reason we can't win, is the Fates themselves have missed.
p254
aVYet there lives on the ancient claim:
p255
aVwe win or lose within ourselves.
p256
aVThe shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow's game.
p257
aVYou and I know deeper down, there's always a chance to win the crown.
p258
aVBut when we fail to give our best,
p259
aVwe simply haven't met the test, of giving all and saving none
p260
aVuntil the game is really won;
p261
aVof showing what is meant by grit;
p262
aVof playing through when others quit;
p263
aVof playing through, not letting up.
p264
aVIt's bearing down that wins the cup.
p265
aVOf dreaming there's a goal ahead; of hoping when our dreams are dead;
p266
aVof praying when our hopes have fled; yet losing, not afraid to fall,
p267
aVif, bravely, we have given all.
p268
aVFor who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span.
p269
aVGiving all, it seems to me, is not so far from victory.
p270
aVAnd so the Fates are seldom wrong, no matter how they twist and wind.
p271
aVIt's you and I who make our fates \u2014
p272
aVwe open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind."
p273
aa(lp274
VReminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us:
p275
aVDon't whine. Don't complain. Don't make excuses.
p276
aVJust get out there,
p277
aVand whatever you're doing, do it to the best of your ability.
p278
aVAnd no one can do more than that.
p279
aVI tried to get across, too, that \u2014
p280
aVmy opponents will tell you \u2014 you never heard me mention winning.
p281
aVNever mention winning.
p282
aVMy idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game,
p283
aVand you can win when you're outscored.
p284
aVI've felt that way on certain occasions, at various times.
p285
aVAnd I just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game.
p286
aVI used to say that when a game is over,
p287
aVand you see somebody that didn't know the outcome,
p288
aVI hope they couldn't tell by your actions
p289
aVwhether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you.
p290
aa(lp291
VThat's what really matters:
p292
aVif you make an effort to do the best you can regularly,
p293
aVthe results will be about what they should be.
p294
aVNot necessarily what you'd want them to be but they'll be about what they should;
p295
aVonly you will know whether you can do that.
p296
aVAnd that's what I wanted from them more than anything else.
p297
aVAnd as time went by, and I learned more about other things,
p298
aVI think it worked a little better,
p299
aVas far as the results.
p300
aVBut I wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things,
p301
aVand not the end itself.
p302
aVI believe it was one great philosopher who said \u2014
p303
aVno, no \u2014 Cervantes.
p304
aVCervantes said, "The journey is better than the end."
p305
aVAnd I like that.
p306
aVI think that it is \u2014 it's getting there.
p307
aVSometimes when you get there, there's almost a let down.
p308
aVBut it's the getting there that's the fun.
p309
aVAs a basketball coach at UCLA, I liked our practices to be the journey,
p310
aVand the game would be the end, the end result.
p311
aVI liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play,
p312
aVand see whether I'd done a decent job during the week.
p313
aVThere again, it's getting the players to get that self-satisfaction,
p314
aVin knowing that they'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable.
p315
aa(lp316
VSometimes I'm asked who was the best player I had, or the best teams.
p317
aVI can never answer that.
p318
aVAs far as the individuals are concerned \u2014
p319
aVI was asked one time about that,
p320
aVand they said,
p321
aV"Suppose that you, in some way, could make the perfect player.
p322
aVWhat would you want?"
p323
aVAnd I said, "Well, I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA:
p324
aVto get an education, he was a good student,
p325
aVreally knew why he was there in the first place.
p326
aVBut I'd want one that could play, too.
p327
aVI'd want one to realize that defense usually wins championships,
p328
aVand who would work hard on defense.
p329
aVBut I'd want one who would play offense, too.
p330
aVI'd want him to be unselfish,
p331
aVand look for the pass first and not shoot all the time.
p332
aVAnd I'd want one that could pass and would pass.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VI've had some that could and wouldn't,
p337
aVand I've had some that would and could.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VSo, yeah, I'd want that.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd I wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside.
p344
aVI wanted them to be good inside too.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VI'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends, too.
p349
aVWhy not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that.
p350
aVHe had the qualifications.
p351
aVNot the only one, but he was one that I used in that particular category,
p352
aVbecause I think he made the effort to become the best.
p353
aVThere was a couple.
p354
aa(lp355
VI mention in my book, "They Call Me Coach,"
p356
aVtwo players that gave me great satisfaction,
p357
aVthat came as close as I think anyone I ever had to reach their full potential:
p358
aVone was Conrad Burke, and one was Doug McIntosh.
p359
aVWhen I saw them as freshmen, on our freshmen team \u2014
p360
aVfreshmen couldn't play varsity when I taught.
p361
aVI thought, "Oh gracious, if these two players, either one of them" \u2014
p362
aVthey were different years, but I thought about each one at the time he was there \u2014
p363
aV"Oh, if he ever makes the varsity,
p364
aVour varsity must be pretty miserable, if he's good enough to make it."
p365
aVAnd you know, one of them was a starting player for a season and a half.
p366
aVThe other one, his next year, played 32 minutes in a national championship game,
p367
aVDid a tremendous job for us.
p368
aVThe next year, he was a starting player on the national championship team,
p369
aVand here I thought he'd never play a minute, when he was \u2014
p370
aVso those are the things that give you great joy,
p371
aVand great satisfaction to see.
p372
aa(lp373
VNeither one of those youngsters could shoot very well.
p374
aVBut they had outstanding shooting percentages,
p375
aVbecause they didn't force it.
p376
aVAnd neither one could jump very well,
p377
aVbut they kept good position, and so they did well rebounding.
p378
aVThey remembered that every shot that's taken, they assumed would be missed.
p379
aVI've had too many stand around and wait to see if it's missed,
p380
aVthen they go and it's too late, somebody else is in there ahead of them.
p381
aVThey weren't very quick, but they played good position,
p382
aVkept in good balance.
p383
aVAnd so they played pretty good defense for us.
p384
aVSo they had qualities that \u2014 they came close to \u2014
p385
aVas close to reaching possibly their full potential
p386
aVas any players I ever had.
p387
aVSo I consider them to be as successful as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton,
p388
aVor many of the others that we had;
p389
aVthere were some outstanding players.
p390
aa(lp391
VHave I rambled enough?
p392
aVI was told that when he makes his appearance, I was supposed to shut up.
p393
aa(lp394

VOkay, I'm going to show you
p5
aVagain something about our diets.
p6
aVAnd I would like to know what the audience is,
p7
aVand so who of you ever ate insects?
p8
aVThat's quite a lot.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVBut still, you're not representing
p11
aVthe overall population of the Earth.
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVBecause there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.
p14
aVBut this is quite good.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhy not eat insects? Well first, what are insects?
p17
aVInsects are animals that walk around on six legs.
p18
aVAnd here you see just a selection.
p19
aVThere's six million species of insects on this planet,
p20
aVsix million species.
p21
aVThere's a few hundreds of mammals \u2014
p22
aVsix million species of insects.
p23
aVIn fact, if we count all the individual organisms,
p24
aVwe would come at much larger numbers.
p25
aVIn fact, of all animals on Earth,
p26
aVof all animal species,
p27
aV80 percent walks on six legs.
p28
aVBut if we would count all the individuals,
p29
aVand we take an average weight of them,
p30
aVit would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms
p31
aVfor each of you and me on Earth.
p32
aVThat means that in terms of biomass,
p33
aVinsects are more abundant than we are,
p34
aVand we're not on a planet of men,
p35
aVbut we're on a planet of insects.
p36
aVInsects are not only there in nature,
p37
aVbut they also are involved in our economy,
p38
aVusually without us knowing.
p39
aa(lp40
VThere was an estimation,
p41
aVa conservative estimation, a couple of years ago
p42
aVthat the U.S. economy
p43
aVbenefited by 57 billion
p44
aVdollars per year.
p45
aVIt's a number \u2014 very large \u2014
p46
aVa contribution to the economy of the United States for free.
p47
aVAnd so I looked up what the economy was paying
p48
aVfor the war in Iraq
p49
aVin the same year.
p50
aVIt was 80 billion U.S. dollars.
p51
aVWell we know that that
p52
aVwas not a cheap war.
p53
aVSo insects, just for free,
p54
aVcontribute to the economy of the United States
p55
aVwith about the same order of magnitude,
p56
aVjust for free, without everyone knowing.
p57
aVAnd not only in the States,
p58
aVbut in any country, in any economy.
p59
aa(lp60
VWhat do they do?
p61
aVThey remove dung, they pollinate our crops.
p62
aVA third of all the fruits that we eat
p63
aVare all a result
p64
aVof insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.
p65
aVThey control pests,
p66
aVand they're food for animals.
p67
aVThey're at the start of food chains.
p68
aVSmall animals eat insects.
p69
aVEven larger animals eat insects.
p70
aVBut the small animals that eat insects
p71
aVare being eaten by larger animals,
p72
aVstill larger animals.
p73
aVAnd at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.
p74
aVThere's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.
p75
aVAnd here you see me
p76
aVin a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang \u2014
p77
aVabout two million inhabitants.
p78
aVIf you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,
p79
aVwhere you can select which fish you want to eat,
p80
aVyou can select which insects you would like to eat.
p81
aVAnd they prepare it in a wonderful way.
p82
aVAnd here you see me enjoying a meal
p83
aVwith caterpillars, locusts,
p84
aVbee pupae \u2014 delicacies.
p85
aVAnd you can eat something new everyday.
p86
aVThere's more than 1,000 species of insects
p87
aVthat are being eaten all around the globe.
p88
aVThat's quite a bit more
p89
aVthan just a few mammals that we're eating,
p90
aVlike a cow or a pig
p91
aVor a sheep.
p92
aVMore than 1,000 species \u2014
p93
aVan enormous variety.
p94
aVAnd now you may think, okay,
p95
aVin this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.
p96
aa(lp97
VWell we've seen already that quite some of you
p98
aValready ate insects maybe occasionally,
p99
aVbut I can tell you that every one of you
p100
aVis eating insects, without any exception.
p101
aVYou're eating at least
p102
aV500 grams per year.
p103
aVWhat are you eating?
p104
aVTomato soup, peanut butter,
p105
aVchocolate, noodles \u2014
p106
aVany processed food that you're eating
p107
aVcontains insects,
p108
aVbecause insects are here all around us,
p109
aVand when they're out there in nature
p110
aVthey're also in our crops.
p111
aVSome fruits get some insect damage.
p112
aVThose are the fruits, if they're tomato,
p113
aVthat go to the tomato soup.
p114
aVIf they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.
p115
aVAnd that's your view of a tomato.
p116
aVBut there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,
p117
aVand as long as they meet
p118
aVthe requirements of the food agency,
p119
aVthere can be all kinds of things in there,
p120
aVno problem.
p121
aVIn fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,
p122
aVthere's meat in there anyway?
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVIn fact, all our processed foods
p125
aVcontain more proteins
p126
aVthan we would be aware of.
p127
aVSo anything is a good protein source already.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow you may say,
p130
aV"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."
p131
aVWe're even doing this on purpose.
p132
aVIn a lot of food items that we have \u2014
p133
aVI have only two items
p134
aVhere on the slide \u2014
p135
aVpink cookies or surimi sticks
p136
aVor, if you like, Campari \u2014
p137
aVa lot of our food products that are of a red color
p138
aVare dyed with a natural dye.
p139
aVThe surimi sticks
p140
aV[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,
p141
aVis white fish
p142
aVthat's being dyed with cochineal.
p143
aVCochineal is a product
p144
aVof an insect that lives off these cacti.
p145
aVIt's being produced in large amounts,
p146
aV150 to 180 metric tons per year
p147
aVin the Canary Islands in Peru,
p148
aVand it's big business.
p149
aVOne gram of cochineal
p150
aVcosts about 30 euros.
p151
aVOne gram of gold
p152
aVis 30 euros.
p153
aVSo it's a very precious thing
p154
aVthat we're using to dye our foods.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow the situation in the world is going to change
p157
aVfor you and me, for everyone on this Earth.
p158
aVThe human population is growing very rapidly
p159
aVand is growing exponentially.
p160
aVWhere, at the moment, we have
p161
aVsomething between six and seven billion people,
p162
aVit will grow to about nine billion
p163
aVin 2050.
p164
aVThat means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,
p165
aVand this is something that worries more and more people.
p166
aVThere was an FAO conference last October
p167
aVthat was completely devoted to this.
p168
aVHow are we going to feed this world?
p169
aVAnd if you look at the figures up there,
p170
aVit says that we have a third more mouths to feed,
p171
aVbut we need an agricultural production increase
p172
aVof 70 percent.
p173
aVAnd that's especially because this world population
p174
aVis increasing,
p175
aVand it's increasing, not only in numbers,
p176
aVbut we're also getting wealthier,
p177
aVand anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more
p178
aVand also starts to eat more meat.
p179
aVAnd meat, in fact, is something
p180
aVthat costs a lot
p181
aVof our agricultural production.
p182
aa(lp183
VOur diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,
p184
aVand at the moment, most of us here
p185
aVget it from livestock,
p186
aVfrom fish, from game.
p187
aVAnd we eat quite a lot of it.
p188
aVIn the developed world it's on average
p189
aV80 kilograms per person per year,
p190
aVwhich goes up to 120
p191
aVin the United States
p192
aVand a bit lower in some other countries,
p193
aVbut on average 80 kilograms
p194
aVper person per year.
p195
aVIn the developing world it's much lower.
p196
aVIt's 25 kilograms per person per year.
p197
aVBut it's increasing enormously.
p198
aVIn China in the last 20 years,
p199
aVit increased from 20 to 50,
p200
aVand it's still increasing.
p201
aVSo if a third of the world population
p202
aVis going to increase its meat consumption
p203
aVfrom 25 to 80 on average,
p204
aVand a third of the world population
p205
aVis living in China and in India,
p206
aVwe're having an enormous demand on meat.
p207
aVAnd of course, we are not there to say
p208
aVthat's only for us, it's not for them.
p209
aVThey have the same share that we have.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow to start with, I should say
p212
aVthat we are eating way too much meat
p213
aVin the Western world.
p214
aVWe could do with much, much less \u2014
p215
aVand I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,
p216
aVand you can easily do without anything.
p217
aVYou'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.
p218
aVBut then there's a lot of problems
p219
aVthat come with meat production,
p220
aVand we're being faced with that more and more often.
p221
aVThe first problem that we're facing is human health.
p222
aVPigs are quite like us.
p223
aVThey're even models in medicine,
p224
aVand we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.
p225
aVThat means that pigs also share diseases with us.
p226
aVAnd a pig disease,
p227
aVa pig virus, and a human virus
p228
aVcan both proliferate,
p229
aVand because of their kind of reproduction,
p230
aVthey can combine and produce a new virus.
p231
aVThis has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s
p232
aVduring the classical swine fever outbreak.
p233
aVYou get a new disease that can be deadly.
p234
aVWe eat insects \u2014 they're so distantly related from us
p235
aVthat this doesn't happen.
p236
aVSo that's one point for insects.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd there's the conversion factor.
p241
aVYou take 10 kilograms of feed,
p242
aVyou can get one kilogram of beef,
p243
aVbut you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.
p244
aVSo if you would be an entrepreneur,
p245
aVwhat would you do?
p246
aVWith 10 kilograms of input,
p247
aVyou can get either one or nine kg. of output.
p248
aVSo far we're taking
p249
aVthe one, or up to five kilograms of output.
p250
aVWe're not taking the bonus yet.
p251
aVWe're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.
p252
aVSo that's two points for insects.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd there's the environment.
p257
aVIf we take 10 kilograms of food \u2014
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVand it results in one kilogram of beef,
p260
aVthe other nine kilograms are waste,
p261
aVand a lot of that is manure.
p262
aVIf you produce insects, you have less manure
p263
aVper kilogram of meat that you produce.
p264
aVSo less waste.
p265
aVFurthermore, per kilogram of manure,
p266
aVyou have much, much less ammonia
p267
aVand fewer greenhouse gases
p268
aVwhen you have insect manure
p269
aVthan when you have cow manure.
p270
aVSo you have less waste,
p271
aVand the waste that you have is not as environmental malign
p272
aVas it is with cow dung.
p273
aVSo that's three points for insects.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VNow there's a big "if," of course,
p278
aVand it is if insects produce meat
p279
aVthat is of good quality.
p280
aVWell there have been all kinds of analyses
p281
aVand in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,
p282
aVit's very good.
p283
aVIn fact, it's comparable
p284
aVto anything we eat as meat at the moment.
p285
aVAnd even in terms of calories, it is very good.
p286
aVOne kilogram of grasshoppers
p287
aVhas the same amount of calories
p288
aVas 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.
p289
aVSo that's four points for insects.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VI can go on,
p294
aVand I could make many more points for insects,
p295
aVbut time doesn't allow this.
p296
aVSo the question is, why not eat insects?
p297
aVI gave you at least four arguments in favor.
p298
aVWe'll have to.
p299
aVEven if you don't like it,
p300
aVyou'll have to get used to this
p301
aVbecause at the moment,
p302
aV70 percent of all our agricultural land
p303
aVis being used to produce livestock.
p304
aVThat's not only the land
p305
aVwhere the livestock is walking and feeding,
p306
aVbut it's also other areas
p307
aVwhere the feed is being produced and being transported.
p308
aVWe can increase it a bit
p309
aVat the expense of rainforests,
p310
aVbut there's a limitation very soon.
p311
aVAnd if you remember that we need to increase
p312
aVagricultural production by 70 percent,
p313
aVwe're not going to make it that way.
p314
aVWe could much better change
p315
aVfrom meat, from beef,
p316
aVto insects.
p317
aVAnd then 80 percent of the world
p318
aValready eats insects,
p319
aVso we are just a minority \u2014
p320
aVin a country like the U.K., the USA,
p321
aVthe Netherlands, anywhere.
p322
aVOn the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos
p323
aVwhere they have abundantly present
p324
aVall kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.
p325
aVOn the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.
p326
aVSo people there are eating them,
p327
aVnot because they're hungry,
p328
aVbut because they think it's a delicacy.
p329
aVIt's just very good food.
p330
aVYou can vary enormously.
p331
aVIt has many benefits.
p332
aa(lp333
VIn fact, we have delicacy
p334
aVthat's very much like this grasshopper:
p335
aVshrimps, a delicacy
p336
aVbeing sold at a high price.
p337
aVWho wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?
p338
aVThere are a few people who don't like shrimp,
p339
aVbut shrimp, or crabs,
p340
aVor crayfish,
p341
aVare very closely related.
p342
aVThey are delicacies.
p343
aVIn fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land,
p344
aVand it would make very good into our diet.
p345
aVSo why are we not eating insects yet?
p346
aVWell that's just a matter of mindset.
p347
aVWe're not used to it,
p348
aVand we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.
p349
aVThat's why we're changing the perception of insects.
p350
aVAnd I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,
p351
aVin telling people what insects are,
p352
aVwhat magnificent things they are,
p353
aVwhat magnificent jobs they do in nature.
p354
aVAnd in fact, without insects,
p355
aVwe would not be here in this room,
p356
aVbecause if the insects die out,
p357
aVwe will soon die out as well.
p358
aVIf we die out, the insects will continue very happily.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
VSo we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.
p363
aVAnd some might think, well they're not yet available.
p364
aVWell they are.
p365
aVThere are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,
p366
aVand one of them is here in the audience,
p367
aVMarian Peeters, who's in the picture.
p368
aVI predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets \u2014
p369
aVnot visible, but as animal protein
p370
aVin the food.
p371
aVAnd maybe by 2020,
p372
aVyou'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.
p373
aVAnd they're being made in the most wonderful ways.
p374
aVA Dutch chocolate maker.
p375
aV(Music)
p376
aV(Applause)
p377
aVSo there's even a lot of design to it.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
VWell in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,
p382
aVand she puts the insects on the menu
p383
aVin her restaurant in her ministry.
p384
aVAnd when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
p385
aVover to the Hague recently,
p386
aVshe went to a high-class restaurant,
p387
aVand they ate insects all together.
p388
aVIt's not something that is a hobby of mine.
p389
aVIt's really taken off the ground.
p390
aVSo why not eat insects?
p391
aVYou should try it yourself.
p392
aVA couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together
p393
aVin a square in Wageningen town,
p394
aVand they ate insects at the same moment,
p395
aVand this was still big, big news.
p396
aVI think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,
p397
aVbecause it's just a normal way of doing.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo you can try it yourself today,
p400
aVand I would say, enjoy.
p401
aVAnd I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,
p402
aVand he can have the first bite.
p403
aa(lp404
V(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VBruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.
p407
aa(lp408
VMarcel Dicke: It's all protein.
p409
aa(lp410
VBG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.
p411
aVAnd it looks delicious.
p412
aVThey just make it [with] nuts or something.
p413
aa(lp414
VMD: Thank you.

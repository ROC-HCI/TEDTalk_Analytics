VWell, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be
p5
aVin the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world.
p6
aVAnd I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today.
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd I'm also rather surprised, because when I look back on my life
p9
aVthe last thing I ever wanted to do was write, or be in any way involved in religion.
p10
aVAfter I left my convent, I'd finished with religion, frankly.
p11
aVI thought that was it.
p12
aVAnd for 13 years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor.
p13
aVAnd I certainly didn't even want to be a writer, particularly.
p14
aVBut then I suffered a series of career catastrophes,
p15
aVone after the other, and finally found myself in television. (Laughter)
p16
aVI said that to Bill Moyers, and he said, "Oh, we take anybody." (Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd I was doing some rather controversial religious programs.
p19
aVThis went down very well in the U.K., where religion is extremely unpopular.
p20
aVAnd so, for once, for the only time in my life, I was finally in the mainstream.
p21
aVBut I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity.
p22
aVAnd there, for the first time, I encountered the other religious traditions:
p23
aVJudaism and Islam, the sister religions of Christianity.
p24
aVAnd while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all \u2014
p25
aVdespite my own intensely religious background,
p26
aVI'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity,
p27
aVand I knew nothing about Islam at all.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut in that city, that tortured city,
p30
aVwhere you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together,
p31
aVyou also become aware of the profound connection between them.
p32
aVAnd it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back
p33
aVto a sense of what religion can be, and actually enabled me
p34
aVto look at my own faith in a different light.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd I found some astonishing things in the course of my study
p37
aVthat had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion,
p38
aVI just found the whole thing absolutely incredible.
p39
aVThese doctrines seemed unproven, abstract.
p40
aVAnd to my astonishment, when I began seriously studying other traditions,
p41
aVI began to realize that belief \u2014 which we make such a fuss about today \u2014
p42
aVis only a very recent religious enthusiasm
p43
aVthat surfaced only in the West, in about the 17th century.
p44
aVThe word "belief" itself originally meant to love, to prize, to hold dear.
p45
aVIn the 17th century, it narrowed its focus,
p46
aVfor reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment,
p47
aVto include \u2014 to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions, a credo.
p48
aV"I believe:" it did not mean, "I accept certain creedal articles of faith."
p49
aVIt meant: "I commit myself. I engage myself."
p50
aVIndeed, some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy.
p51
aVIn the Quran, religious opinion \u2014 religious orthodoxy \u2014 is dismissed as "zanna:"
p52
aVself-indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other,
p53
aVbut which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian. (Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VSo if religion is not about believing things, what is it about?
p56
aVWhat I've found, across the board, is that religion is about behaving differently.
p57
aVInstead of deciding whether or not you believe in God, first you do something.
p58
aVYou behave in a committed way,
p59
aVand then you begin to understand the truths of religion.
p60
aVAnd religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action;
p61
aVyou only understand them when you put them into practice.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, pride of place in this practice is given to compassion.
p64
aVAnd it is an arresting fact that right across the board,
p65
aVin every single one of the major world faiths, compassion \u2014
p66
aVthe ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening \u2014
p67
aVis not only the test of any true religiosity, it is also what will bring us
p68
aVinto the presence of what Jews, Christians and Muslims call "God" or the "Divine."
p69
aVIt is compassion, says the Buddha, which brings you to Nirvana.
p70
aVWhy? Because in compassion, when we feel with the other,
p71
aVwe dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put
p72
aVanother person there. And once we get rid of ego, then we're ready to see the Divine.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd in particular, every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted \u2014 has said \u2014
p75
aVand put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule.
p76
aVFirst propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ:
p77
aV"Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
p78
aVThat, he said, was the central thread which ran through all his teaching
p79
aVand that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day.
p80
aVAnd it was \u2014 the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called "ren,"
p81
aVhuman-heartedness, which was a transcendent experience in itself.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms, too.
p84
aVThere's a famous story about the great rabbi, Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus.
p85
aVA pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could
p86
aVrecite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg.
p87
aVHillel stood on one leg and said, "That which is hateful to you,
p88
aVdo not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah. The rest is commentary.
p89
aVGo and study it." (Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd "go and study it" was what he meant.
p92
aVHe said, "In your exegesis, you must make it clear
p93
aVthat every single verse of the Torah is a commentary, a gloss upon the Golden Rule."
p94
aVThe great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which
p95
aVled to hatred and disdain, or contempt of other people \u2014
p96
aVany people whatsoever \u2014 was illegitimate.
p97
aa(lp98
VSaint Augustine made exactly the same point.
p99
aVScripture, he says, "teaches nothing but charity, and we must not leave
p100
aVan interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it."
p101
aVAnd this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts
p102
aVis a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life. (Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VBut now look at our world. And we are living in a world that is \u2014
p105
aVwhere religion has been hijacked. Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities.
p106
aVWhere instead of taking Jesus' words, "Love your enemies.
p107
aVDon't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people,
p108
aVendlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people,
p109
aVputting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others,
p110
aVand this is because of human ego, human greed.
p111
aVWe have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo the traditions also insisted \u2014 and this is an important point, I think \u2014
p114
aVthat you could not and must not confine your compassion
p115
aVto your own group: your own nation, your own co-religionists,
p116
aVyour own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called "jian ai":
p117
aVconcern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger.
p118
aVWe formed you, says the Quran, into tribes and nations so that you may know one another.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd this, again \u2014 this universal outreach \u2014 is getting subdued in the strident use of religion \u2014
p121
aVabuse of religion \u2014 for nefarious gains.
p122
aVNow, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who,
p123
aVwhen I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion
p124
aVhas been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong.
p125
aVThe causes of our present woes are political.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut, make no mistake about it, religion is a kind of fault line,
p128
aVand when a conflict gets ingrained in a region, religion can get sucked in
p129
aVand become part of the problem. Our modernity has been exceedingly violent.
p130
aVBetween 1914 and 1945, 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict.
p131
aVAnd so many of our institutions, even football, which used to be a pleasant pastime,
p132
aVnow causes riots where people even die.
p133
aVAnd it's not surprising that religion, too, has been affected by this violent ethos.
p134
aa(lp135
VThere's also a great deal, I think, of religious illiteracy around.
p136
aVPeople seem to think, now equate religious faith with believing things.
p137
aVAs though that \u2014 we call religious people often believers,
p138
aVas though that were the main thing that they do. And very often, secondary goals
p139
aVget pushed into the first place, in place of compassion and the Golden Rule.
p140
aVBecause the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes \u2014 when I'm speaking to
p141
aVcongregations about compassion, I sometimes see
p142
aVa mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because
p143
aVa lot of religious people prefer to be right, rather than compassionate. (Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VNow \u2014 but that's not the whole story.
p146
aVSince September the 11th, when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me
p147
aVinto public life, in a way that I'd never imagined, I've been able to sort of go all over the world,
p148
aVand finding, everywhere I go, a yearning for change.
p149
aVI've just come back from Pakistan, where literally thousands of people came to my lectures,
p150
aVbecause they were yearning, first of all, to hear a friendly Western voice.
p151
aVAnd especially the young people were coming. And were asking me \u2014
p152
aVthe young people were saying, "What can we do? What can we do to change things?"
p153
aVAnd my hosts in Pakistan said, "Look, don't be too polite to us.
p154
aVTell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing."
p155
aa(lp156
VBecause it seems to me that with \u2014 our current situation is so serious
p157
aVat the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding
p158
aVand global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time.
p159
aVAnd religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States,
p160
aVpeople may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown \u2014
p161
aVbut they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism,
p162
aVwhich is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut people want to be religious, and religion should be made
p165
aVto be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be \u2014
p166
aVbecause of the Golden Rule.
p167
aV"Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you":
p168
aVan ethos that should now be applied globally.
p169
aVWe should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd these \u2014 whatever our wretched beliefs \u2014 is a religious matter, it's a spiritual matter.
p172
aVIt's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all.
p173
aVAnd as I say, there is a hunger for change out there.
p174
aVHere in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change.
p175
aVAnd people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the 11th,
p176
aVcoming together locally to create networks of understanding.
p177
aVWith the mosque, with the synagogue, saying, "We must start to speak to one another."
p178
aVI think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other.
p179
aa(lp180
VI'd \u2014 there's one story I'd just like to mention.
p181
aVThis comes from "The Iliad." But it tells you what this spirituality should be.
p182
aVYou know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy.
p183
aVIn one incident, Achilles, the famous warrior of Greece, takes his troops out of the war,
p184
aVand the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle,
p185
aVhis beloved friend, Patroclus, is killed \u2014 and killed in single combat
p186
aVby one of the Trojan princes, Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge,
p187
aVand he mutilates the body. He kills Hector, he mutilates his body
p188
aVand then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family,
p189
aVwhich means that, in Greek ethos, Hector's soul will wander eternally, lost.
p190
aVAnd then one night, Priam, king of Troy, an old man,
p191
aVcomes into the Greek camp incognito, makes his way to Achilles' tent
p192
aVto ask for the body of his son.
p193
aVAnd everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself.
p194
aVAnd Achilles looks at him and thinks of his father. And he starts to weep.
p195
aVAnd Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons,
p196
aVand he, too, starts to weep. And the sound of their weeping filled the house.
p197
aVThe Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people.
p198
aVAnd then Achilles takes the body of Hector, he hands it very tenderly to the father,
p199
aVand the two men look at each other, and see each other as divine.
p200
aa(lp201
VThat is the ethos found, too, in all the religions.
p202
aVIt's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies,
p203
aVand beginning to appreciate the other.
p204
aVIt's of great importance that the word for "holy" in Hebrew, applied to God, is "Kadosh": separate, other.
p205
aVAnd it is often, perhaps, the very otherness of our enemies which can
p206
aVgive us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd now, here's my wish:
p209
aVI wish that you would help with the creation,
p210
aVlaunch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion,
p211
aVcrafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from
p212
aVthe three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam,
p213
aVand based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule.
p214
aVWe need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels \u2014
p215
aVyou probably meet, too \u2014 who want to join up, in some way,
p216
aVand reclaim their faith, which they feel, as I say, has been hijacked.
p217
aVWe need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos,
p218
aVand to give guidelines. This Charter would not be a massive document.
p219
aVI'd like to see it \u2014 to give guidelines as to how to interpret the Scriptures,
p220
aVthese texts that are being abused. Remember what the rabbis and what Augustine
p221
aVsaid about how Scripture should be governed by the principle of charity.
p222
aVLet's get back to that. And the idea, too, of Jews, Christians and Muslims \u2014
p223
aVthese traditions now so often at loggerheads \u2014 working together to
p224
aVcreate a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand, at least,
p225
aVof major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar.
p228
aVDespite the idea that I love a good time, which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me
p229
aV\u2014 I actually spend a great deal of time alone, studying, and I'm not very \u2014
p230
aVyou're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody,
p231
aVeverybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks,
p232
aVand Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for example,
p233
aVis very happy to give his name to this, as is Imam Feisal Rauf, the Imam in New York City.
p234
aVAlso, I would be working with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations.
p235
aVI was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations,
p236
aVwhich was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism,
p237
aVand to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it.
p240
aVThe importance of this is that this is \u2014 I can see some of you starting to look worried,
p241
aVbecause you think it's a slow and cumbersome body \u2014
p242
aVbut what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality,
p243
aVso that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming,
p244
aVas it were, from the United Nations, from the world \u2014
p245
aVwho would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd so I do urge you to join me in making \u2014 in this charter \u2014
p248
aVto building this charter, launching it and propagating it so that it becomes \u2014
p249
aVI'd like to see it in every college, every church, every mosque, every synagogue in the world,
p250
aVso that people can look at their tradition, reclaim it, and make religion a source of peace in the world,
p251
aVwhich it can and should be. Thank you very much. (Applause)

Armstrong has written more than 20 books on faith and the major religions, studying what Islam, Judaism and Christianity have in common, and how our faiths shaped world history and drive current events.</p>  <p>A former nun, Armstrong has written two books about this experience:&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/narrowgate\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Through the Narrow Gate</em></a>, about her seven years in the convent, and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/spiralstaircase\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Spiral Staircase</em></a>, about her subsequent spiritual awakening, when she developed her iconoclastic take on the major monotheistic religions -- and on the strains of fundamentalism common to all. She is a powerful voice for ecumenical understanding.</p>  <p>Armstrong&#39;s 2008 TED Prize wish asked the world to help her create the&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://charterforcompassion.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Charter for Compassion</a>, a document around which religious leaders can work together for peace. The Charter is based on the Golden Rule: that we should treat others how we would want to be treated. In fall 2008, the first draft of the charter was written by the world, via a sharing website. In February 2009, the words were given to the Council of Conscience, a gathering of religious leaders and thinkers, who crafted the final document based on global input. The Charter was officially launched in November 2009. It has been signed by notable world leaders including Pope Benedict XVI, the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Deepak Chopra and Muhammad Ali. The Charter has led to the creation of the Charter for Compassion International (CCI) organization, the Compassionate Communities campaign, and Global Compassion Council &ndash; a group of leaders continuing the movement around the the world.</p>", "slug": "karen_armstrong", "whotheyare": "Karen Armstrong -- winner of the 2008 TED Prize -- is a provocative, original thinker on the role of religion in the modern world.", "whatotherssay": "Her idea is to start a new \'theology of power,\' based on the Golden Rule.", "id": 208, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/34769_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "My wish: The Charter for Compassion", "take_action": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "link_url": "http://www.charterforcompassion.org/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "verb": "sign_up", "published": true, "visible_url": "charterforcompassion.org", "type": "take_action", "blurb": "**Sign** the Charter for Compassion and share its message with others."}], "comments": 214, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "Karen Armstrong\'s TED Prize wish", "link_url": "http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/charter-for-compassion-karen-armstrong", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "", "type": "from_the_blog", "blurb": "Dive deeper into the religious scholar\'s vision for an interfaith bill of rights for justice and understanding."}], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/e653c223738e3bb9496a323298be3d6b7f72aa32_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "People want to be religious, says scholar Karen Armstrong; we should help make religion a force for harmony.

VA few weeks ago, I had a chance to go to Saudi Arabia.
p5
aVAnd the first thing I wanted to do as a Muslim
p6
aVwas to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba,
p7
aVthe holiest shrine of Islam.
p8
aVAnd I did that; I put on my ritualistic dress,
p9
aVI went to the holy mosque,
p10
aVI did my prayers,
p11
aVI observed all the rituals.
p12
aVAnd meanwhile, besides all the spirituality,
p13
aVthere was one mundane detail in the Kaaba
p14
aVthat was pretty interesting for me:
p15
aVthere was no separation of sexes.
p16
aVIn other words, men and women were worshiping all together.
p17
aVThey were together while doing taw\u0101f, the circular walk around the Kaaba.
p18
aVThey were together while praying.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd if you wonder why this is interesting at all,
p21
aVyou have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia,
p22
aVbecause this a country which is strictly divided between the sexes.
p23
aVIn other words:
p24
aVas men, you are simply not supposed to be in the same physical space
p25
aVwith women.
p26
aVAnd I noticed this in a very funny way.
p27
aVI left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca.
p28
aVI headed to the nearest Burger King restaurant.
p29
aVAnd I went there \u2014 I noticed that there was a male section,
p30
aVwhich is carefully separated from the female section.
p31
aVI had to pay, order and eat in the male section.
p32
aV"It's funny," I said to myself,
p33
aV"You can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy Kaaba,
p34
aVbut not at the Burger King?"
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VQuite, quite ironic.
p39
aVIronic, and it's also, I think, quite telling,
p40
aVbecause the Kaaba and the rituals around it
p41
aVare relics from the earliest phase of Islam,
p42
aVthat of prophet Muhammad.
p43
aVAnd if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women,
p44
aVthe rituals around the Kaaba could have been designed accordingly.
p45
aVBut apparently, that was not an issue at the time.
p46
aVSo the rituals came that way.
p47
aVThis is also, I think, confirmed by the fact
p48
aVthat the seclusion of women in creating a divided society
p49
aVis something that you also do not find in the Koran \u2014
p50
aVthe very core of Islam, the divine core of Islam \u2014
p51
aVthat all Muslims, equally myself, believe.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd I think it's not an accident
p54
aVthat you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam,
p55
aVbecause many scholars who study the history of Islamic thought \u2014
p56
aVMuslim scholars or Westerners \u2014
p57
aVthink that, actually, the practice of dividing men and women physically
p58
aVcame as a later development in Islam,
p59
aVas Muslims adopted some preexisting cultures
p60
aVand traditions of the Middle East.
p61
aVSeclusion of women was actually a Byzantine and Persian practice,
p62
aVand Muslims adopted it and made it a part of their religion.
p63
aa(lp64
VActually, this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon.
p65
aVWhat we call today Islamic law, and especially Islamic culture \u2014
p66
aVand there are many Islamic cultures, actually;
p67
aVthe one in Saudi Arabia is much different
p68
aVfrom where I come from in Istanbul or Turkey.
p69
aVBut still, if you're going to speak about a Muslim culture,
p70
aVthis has a core: the divine message which began the religion.
p71
aVBut then many traditions, perceptions, practices were added on top of it.
p72
aVAnd these were traditions of the Middle East medieval traditions.
p73
aa(lp74
VThere are two important messages, or two lessons,
p75
aVto take from that reality.
p76
aVFirst of all, Muslims \u2014
p77
aVpious, conservative, believing Muslims who want to be loyal to their religion \u2014
p78
aVshould not cling onto everything in their culture,
p79
aVthinking that that's divinely mandated.
p80
aVMaybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed.
p81
aVOn the other hand, the Westerners who look at Islamic culture
p82
aVand see some troubling aspects
p83
aVshould not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains.
p84
aVMaybe it's a Middle Eastern culture that became confused with Islam.
p85
aa(lp86
VThere is a practice called female circumcision.
p87
aVIt's something terrible, horrible.
p88
aVIt is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure.
p89
aVAnd Westerners \u2014
p90
aVEuropeans or Americans \u2014 who didn't know about this before,
p91
aV[saw] this practice
p92
aVwithin some of the Muslim communities who migrated from North Africa.
p93
aVAnd they've thought,
p94
aV"Oh, what a horrible religion that is, which ordains something like that."
p95
aVBut when you look at female circumcision,
p96
aVyou see that it has nothing to do with Islam;
p97
aVit's just a North African practice which predates Islam.
p98
aVIt was there for thousands of years.
p99
aVAnd, quite tellingly, some Muslims do practice it \u2014
p100
aVthe Muslims in North Africa, not in other places.
p101
aVBut also the non-Muslim communities of North Africa \u2014
p102
aVthe animists, some Christians and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa \u2014
p103
aVare known to practice female circumcision.
p104
aVSo what might look like a problem within Islamic faith
p105
aVmight turn out to be a tradition that Muslims have subscribed to.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe same thing can be said for honor killings,
p108
aVwhich is a recurrent theme in the Western media \u2014
p109
aVand which is, of course, a horrible tradition.
p110
aVAnd we see, truly, in some Muslim communities, that tradition.
p111
aVBut in the non-Muslim communities of the Middle East,
p112
aVsuch as some Christian communities, Eastern communities,
p113
aVyou see the same practice.
p114
aVWe had a tragic case of an honor killing
p115
aVwithin Turkey's Armenian community just a few months ago.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, these are things about general culture,
p118
aVbut I'm also very much interested in political culture
p119
aVand whether liberty and democracy is appreciated,
p120
aVor whether there's an authoritarian political culture
p121
aVin which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens.
p122
aVAnd it is no secret
p123
aVthat many Islamic movements in the Middle East
p124
aVtend to be authoritarian,
p125
aVand some of the so-called "Islamic regimes,"
p126
aVsuch as Saudi Arabia, Iran and the worst case, the Taliban in Afghanistan,
p127
aVthey are pretty authoritarian \u2014 no doubt about that.
p128
aa(lp129
VFor example, in Saudi Arabia,
p130
aVthere is a phenomenon called the religious police.
p131
aVAnd the religious police imposes the supposed Islamic way of life
p132
aVon every citizen, by force \u2014
p133
aVlike, women are forced to cover their heads \u2014
p134
aVwear the hijab, the Islamic head cover.
p135
aVNow that is pretty authoritarian,
p136
aVand that's something I'm very much critical of.
p137
aVBut when I realized that the non-Muslim,
p138
aVor the non-Islamic-minded actors in the same geography
p139
aVsometimes behaved similarly,
p140
aVI realized that the problem maybe lies
p141
aVin the political culture of the whole region, not just Islam.
p142
aVLet me give you an example: in Turkey, where I come from,
p143
aVwhich is a very hyper-secular republic,
p144
aVuntil very recently, we used to have what I call "secularism police,"
p145
aVwhich would guard the universities against veiled students.
p146
aVIn other words, they would force students to uncover their heads.
p147
aVAnd I think forcing people to uncover their head
p148
aVis as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it.
p149
aVIt should be the citizen's decision.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut when I saw that, I said,
p152
aV"Maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region,
p153
aVand some Muslims have been influenced by that.
p154
aVBut the secular-minded people can be influenced by that.
p155
aVMaybe it's a problem of the political culture,
p156
aVand we have to think about how to change that political culture."
p157
aVNow, these are some of the questions I had in mind a few years ago
p158
aVwhen I sat down to write a book.
p159
aVI said, "Well, I will do research
p160
aVabout how Islam actually came to be what it is today,
p161
aVand what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken."
p162
aVThe name of the book is "Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty."
p163
aVAnd as the subtitle suggests,
p164
aVI looked at Islamic tradition and the history of Islamic thought
p165
aVfrom the perspective of individual liberty,
p166
aVand I tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd there are strengths in Islamic tradition.
p169
aVIslam, actually, as a monotheistic religion,
p170
aVwhich defined man as a responsible agent by itself,
p171
aVcreated the idea of the individual in the Middle East,
p172
aVand saved it from the communitarianism, the collectivism of the tribe.
p173
aVYou can derive many ideas from that.
p174
aVBut besides that, I also saw problems within Islamic tradition.
p175
aVBut one thing was curious:
p176
aVmost of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later,
p177
aVnot from the very divine core of Islam, the Koran,
p178
aVbut from, again, traditions and mentalities,
p179
aVor the interpretations of the Koran that Muslims made in the Middle Ages.
p180
aVThe Koran, for example, doesn't condone stoning.
p181
aVThere is no punishment for apostasy.
p182
aVThere is no punishment for personal sins like drinking.
p183
aVThese things which make Islamic law,
p184
aVthe troubling aspects of Islamic law,
p185
aVwere developed into later interpretations of Islam.
p186
aa(lp187
VWhich means that Muslims can, today,
p188
aVlook at those things and say,
p189
aV"Well, the core of our religion is here to stay with us.
p190
aVIt's our faith, and we will be loyal to it.
p191
aVBut we can change how it was interpreted,
p192
aVbecause it was interpreted according to the time
p193
aVand milieu in the Middle Ages.
p194
aVNow we're living in a different world,
p195
aVwith different values and political systems."
p196
aVThat interpretation is quite possible and feasible.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, if I were the only person thinking that way,
p199
aVwe would be in trouble.
p200
aVBut that's not the case at all.
p201
aVActually, from the 19th century on,
p202
aVthere's a whole revisionist, reformist \u2014 whatever you call it \u2014 tradition,
p203
aVa trend in Islamic thinking.
p204
aVThese were intellectuals or statesmen
p205
aVof the 19th century, and later, 20th century,
p206
aVwhich looked at Europe, basically,
p207
aVand saw that Europe has many things to admire,
p208
aVlike science and technology.
p209
aVBut not just that; also democracy, parliament,
p210
aVthe idea of representation,
p211
aVthe idea of equal citizenship.
p212
aVThese Muslim thinkers, intellectuals and statesmen of the 19th century,
p213
aVlooked at Europe, saw these things, and said,
p214
aV"Why don't we have these things?"
p215
aVAnd they looked back at Islamic tradition,
p216
aVand saw that there are problematic aspects,
p217
aVbut they're not the core of the religion, so maybe they can be re-understood,
p218
aVand the Koran can be reread in the modern world.
p219
aa(lp220
VThat trend is generally called Islamic modernism,
p221
aVand it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen,
p222
aVnot just as an intellectual idea, though,
p223
aVbut also as a political program.
p224
aVAnd that's why, actually, in the 19th century,
p225
aVthe Ottoman Empire, which then covered the whole Middle East,
p226
aVmade very important reforms \u2014
p227
aVreforms like giving Christians and Jews an equal citizenship status,
p228
aVaccepting a constitution,
p229
aVaccepting a representative parliament,
p230
aVadvancing the idea of freedom of religion.
p231
aVThat's why the Ottoman Empire, in its last decades,
p232
aVturned into a proto-democracy, a constitutional monarchy,
p233
aVand freedom was a very important political value at the time.
p234
aa(lp235
VSimilarly, in the Arab world,
p236
aVthere was what the great Arab historian Albert Hourani defines
p237
aVas the Liberal Age.
p238
aVHe has a book, "Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age,"
p239
aVand the Liberal Age, he defines as 19th century and early 20th century.
p240
aVQuite notably, this was the dominant trend in the early 20th century
p241
aVamong Islamic thinkers and statesmen and theologians.
p242
aVBut there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the 20th century,
p243
aVbecause we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modernist line.
p244
aVAnd in place of that,
p245
aVwhat happens is that Islamism grows as an ideology which is authoritarian,
p246
aVwhich is quite strident,
p247
aVwhich is quite anti-Western,
p248
aVand which wants to shape society based on a utopian vision.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo Islamism is the problematic idea
p251
aVthat really created a lot of problems in the 20th-century Islamic world.
p252
aVAnd even the very extreme forms of Islamism
p253
aVled to terrorism in the name of Islam \u2014
p254
aVwhich is actually a practice that I think is against Islam,
p255
aVbut some, obviously, extremists, did not think that way.
p256
aVBut there is a curious question:
p257
aVIf Islamic modernism was so popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries,
p258
aVwhy did Islamism become so popular in the rest of the 20th century?
p259
aVAnd this is a question, I think, which needs to be discussed carefully.
p260
aVIn my book, I went into that question as well.
p261
aVAnd actually, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that.
p262
aVJust look at the political history of the 20th century,
p263
aVand you see things have changed a lot.
p264
aVThe contexts have changed.
p265
aa(lp266
VIn the 19th century,
p267
aVwhen Muslims were looking at Europe as an example,
p268
aVthey were independent; they were more self-confident.
p269
aVIn the early 20th century, with the fall of the Ottoman Empire,
p270
aVthe whole Middle East was colonized.
p271
aVAnd when you have colonialization, what do you have?
p272
aVYou have anti-colonialization.
p273
aVSo Europe is not just an example now to emulate;
p274
aVit's an enemy to fight and to resist.
p275
aVSo there's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the Muslim world,
p276
aVand what you see is more of a defensive, rigid, reactionary strain,
p277
aVwhich led to Arab socialism, Arab nationalism
p278
aVand ultimately to the Islamist ideology.
p279
aVAnd when the colonial period ended,
p280
aVwhat you had in place of that was generally secular dictators,
p281
aVwhich say they're a country,
p282
aVbut did not bring democracy to the country,
p283
aVand established their own dictatorship.
p284
aVAnd I think the West, at least some powers in the West,
p285
aVparticularly the United States,
p286
aVmade the mistake of supporting those secular dictators,
p287
aVthinking that they were more helpful for their interests.
p288
aVBut the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country
p289
aVand suppressed Islamic groups in their country
p290
aVactually made the Islamists much more strident.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo in the 20th century,
p293
aVyou had this vicious cycle in the Arab world,
p294
aVwhere you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people,
p295
aVincluding the Islamic pious,
p296
aVand they're reacting in reactionary ways.
p297
aVThere was one country, though,
p298
aVwhich was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle.
p299
aVAnd that's the country where I come from, Turkey.
p300
aVTurkey has never been colonized,
p301
aVso it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.
p302
aVThat's one thing to remember;
p303
aVit did not share the same anti-colonial hype
p304
aVthat you can find in some other countries in the region.
p305
aVSecondly, and most importantly,
p306
aVTurkey became a democracy
p307
aVearlier than any of the countries we are talking about.
p308
aVIn 1950, Turkey had the first free and fair elections,
p309
aVwhich ended the more autocratic secular regime,
p310
aVwhich was in the beginning of Turkey.
p311
aVAnd the pious Muslims in Turkey
p312
aVsaw that they could change the political system by voting.
p313
aVAnd they realized that democracy is something compatible with Islam,
p314
aVcompatible with their values,
p315
aVand they've been supportive of democracy.
p316
aVThat's an experience
p317
aVthat not every other Muslim nation in the Middle East had,
p318
aVuntil very recently.
p319
aa(lp320
VSecondly, in the past two decades,
p321
aVthanks to globalization, thanks to the market economy,
p322
aVthanks to the rise of a middle class,
p323
aVwe in Turkey see what I define as a rebirth of Islamic modernism.
p324
aVNow, there's the more urban middle-class pious Muslims
p325
aVwho, again, look at their tradition
p326
aVand see that there are some problems in the tradition,
p327
aVand understand that they need to be changed and questioned and reformed.
p328
aVAnd they look at Europe, and see an example, again, to follow.
p329
aVThey see an example, at least, to take some inspiration from.
p330
aVThat's why the EU process, Turkey's effort to join the EU,
p331
aVhas been supported inside Turkey by the Islamic pious,
p332
aVwhile some secular nationalists were against it.
p333
aVWell, that process has been a little bit blurred
p334
aVby the fact that not all Europeans are that welcoming,
p335
aVbut that's another discussion.
p336
aVBut the pro-EU sentiment in Turkey in the past decade
p337
aVhas become almost an Islamic cause and supported by the Islamic liberals
p338
aVand the secular liberals as well, of course.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd thanks to that,
p341
aVTurkey has been able to reasonably create a success story
p342
aVin which Islam and the most pious understandings of Islam
p343
aVhave become part of the democratic game,
p344
aVand even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country.
p345
aVAnd this has been an inspiring example right now
p346
aVfor some of the Islamic movements
p347
aVor some of the countries in the Arab world.
p348
aa(lp349
VYou must have all seen the Arab Spring,
p350
aVwhich began in Tunis and in Egypt.
p351
aVArab masses just revolted against their dictators.
p352
aVThey were asking for democracy; they were asking for freedom.
p353
aVAnd they did not turn out to be the Islamist boogeyman
p354
aVthat the dictators were always using to justify their regime.
p355
aVThey said, "We want freedom; we want democracy.
p356
aVWe are Muslim believers,
p357
aVbut we want to be living as free people in free societies."
p358
aVOf course, this is a long road.
p359
aVDemocracy is not an overnight achievement; it's a process.
p360
aVBut this is a promising era in the Muslim world.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd I believe that the Islamic modernism which began in the 19th century,
p363
aVbut which had a setback in the 20th century
p364
aVbecause of the political troubles of the Muslim world,
p365
aVis having a rebirth.
p366
aVAnd I think the takeaway message from that would be that Islam,
p367
aVdespite some of the skeptics in the West,
p368
aVhas the potential in itself
p369
aVto create its own way to democracy, create its own way to liberalism,
p370
aVcreate its own way to freedom.
p371
aVThey just should be allowed to work for that.
p372
aa(lp373
VThanks so much.

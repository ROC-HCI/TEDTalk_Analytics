VI'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer,
p9
aVI'm not a choreographer \u2014 I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller.
p10
aVI directed a movie two years ago
p11
aVcalled "Step Up 2: The Streets."
p12
aVAnybody? Anybody? Yeah!
p13
aVDuring that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers \u2014
p14
aVamazing, the best in the world \u2014
p15
aVand they brought me into a society, the sort of underground
p16
aVstreet culture that blew my mind.
p17
aVI mean, this is literally human beings
p18
aVwith super-human strength and abilities.
p19
aVThey could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back.
p20
aVThey could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.
p21
aVI'd never seen anything like that.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhen I was growing up, my heroes were people like
p24
aVFred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.
p25
aVI grew up in a musical family.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVAnd those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.
p28
aVBeing a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley
p29
aVwith low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.
p30
aVThose guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that
p31
aVmoonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."
p32
aa(lp33
V(Applause)
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared,
p36
aVsort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.
p37
aVBut after seeing what I've seen,
p38
aVthe truth is, they have not disappeared at all.
p39
aVThey're here, getting better and better every day.
p40
aVAnd dance has progressed.
p41
aVIt is insane what dance is right now.
p42
aVDance has never had a better friend than technology.
p43
aa(lp44
VOnline videos and social networking ...
p45
aVdancers have created a whole global laboratory online
p46
aVfor dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves
p47
aVfrom a YouTube video created in Detroit,
p48
aVbuilding on it within days and releasing a new video,
p49
aVwhile teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it
p50
aVwith a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.
p51
aVAnd this is happening every day.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages,
p54
aVwith cheap webcams,
p55
aVlies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.
p56
aVOur Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys
p57
aVour Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips,
p58
aVand may not have that opportunity, except for us.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo, we created the LXD,
p61
aVsort of a \u2014 the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers,
p62
aVa justice league of dancers that believe
p63
aVthat dance can have a transformative effect on the world.
p64
aVA living, breathing comic book series,
p65
aVbut unlike Spiderman and Iron Man,
p66
aVthese guys can actually do it.
p67
aVAnd we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you,
p68
aVsome of our heroes right now.
p69
aVWe got Madd Chadd,
p70
aVLil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.
p71
aVPlease be excited, have fun, yell, scream.
p72
aVLadies and gentlemen: The LXD.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Applause)
p75
aa(lp76
V(Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me,
p77
aVI get a lot of different reactions actually.
p78
aVSometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it,
p79
aVbut sometimes they get a little freaked out.
p80
aVAnd, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Music)
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VJ Smooth: When I'm in the zone \u2014 I'm dancing and free styling it \u2014
p87
aVI actually visually kind of picture
p88
aVlines, and moving them.
p89
aVI think of like, Transformers,
p90
aVlike how panels open and then they fold,
p91
aVthey fold in, and then you close that panel.
p92
aVAnd then another thing opens,
p93
aVyou close that.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Music)
p96
aa(lp97
V(Applause)
p98
aa(lp99
VKid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times
p100
aVI don't really know what's going on
p101
aVwhen I'm dancing.
p102
aVBecause at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.
p103
aVIt's not really a conscious decision,
p104
aV"I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."
p105
aVIt's kind of like this other level
p106
aVwhere you can't make choices anymore,
p107
aVand it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.
p108
aVI got my name just because I was so young.
p109
aVI was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.
p110
aVSo, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Music)
p113
aa(lp114
V(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VL'il C: I tell them to create a ball,
p117
aVand then you just use that ball of energy.
p118
aVAnd instead of throwing it out, people would think
p119
aVthat's a krump move, that's a krump move.
p120
aVThat's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out,
p121
aVyou throw it out, and you hold it.
p122
aVAnd you let it go, and then right when you see the tail,
p123
aVyou grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.
p124
aVAnd you just got this piece of energy
p125
aVand you just, you're manipulating it.
p126
aVYou know, you create power, then you tame it.

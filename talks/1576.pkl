VI've always written primarily about architecture,
p5
aVabout buildings, and writing about architecture
p6
aVis based on certain assumptions.
p7
aVAn architect designs a building, and it becomes a place,
p8
aVor many architects design many buildings, and it becomes
p9
aVa city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces
p10
aVof politics and culture and economics that shapes
p11
aVthese places, at the end of the day, you can go
p12
aVand you can visit them. You can walk around them.
p13
aVYou can smell them. You can get a feel for them.
p14
aVYou can experience their sense of place.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut what was striking to me over the last several years
p17
aVwas that less and less was I going out into the world,
p18
aVand more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.
p19
aVAnd especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone,
p20
aVI was not only sitting in front of my screen all day,
p21
aVbut I was also getting up at the end of the day
p22
aVand looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.
p23
aVAnd what was surprising to me was how quickly
p24
aVmy relationship to the physical world had changed.
p25
aVIn this very short period of time, you know, whether you
p26
aVcall it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last,
p27
aVyou know, four or five years of being online all the time,
p28
aVour relationship to our surroundings had changed in that
p29
aVour attention is constantly divided. You know,
p30
aVwe're both looking inside the screens and we're looking
p31
aVout in the world around us.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd what was even more striking to me, and what I really
p34
aVgot hung up on, was that the world inside the screen
p35
aVseemed to have no physical reality of its own.
p36
aVIf you went and looked for images of the Internet,
p37
aVthis was all that you found, this famous image by Opte
p38
aVof the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse
p39
aVwhere we don't seem to be anywhere on it.
p40
aVWe can never seem to grasp it in its totality.
p41
aVIt's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth,
p42
aVthe blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest,
p43
aVI think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.
p44
aVWe're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo if there was this world and this screen, and if there was
p47
aVthe physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them
p48
aVtogether in the same place.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd then this happened.
p51
aVMy Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does,
p52
aVand the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with
p53
aVthe dusty clump of cables behind the couch,
p54
aVand he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard,
p55
aVand there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.
p56
aVAnd then he saw a squirrel running along the wire,
p57
aVand he said, "There's your problem.
p58
aVA squirrel is chewing on your Internet." (Laughter)
p59
aVAnd this seemed astounding. The Internet is
p60
aVa transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed
p61
aVeverything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
p62
aVIt was unequivocally not something
p63
aVa squirrel could chew on. (Laughter)
p64
aVBut that in fact seemed to be the case.
p65
aVA squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet. (Laughter)
p66
aVAnd then I got this image in my head of what would happen
p67
aVif you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started
p68
aVto follow it. Where would it go?
p69
aVWas the Internet actually a place that you could visit?
p70
aVCould I go there? Who would I meet?
p71
aVYou know, was there something actually out there?
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd the answer, by all accounts, was no.
p74
aVThis was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it,
p75
aVas represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."
p76
aVNormally it lives on the top of Big Ben,
p77
aVbecause that's where you get the best reception,
p78
aVbut they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it
p79
aVfor the afternoon to use in an office presentation.
p80
aVThe elders of the Internet were willing to part with it
p81
aVfor a short while, and she looks at it and she says,
p82
aV"This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"
p83
aVThey say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing
p86
aVthat only fools seem to look for.
p87
aVThe Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly
p88
aVblack box with a blinking red light on it.
p89
aVIt wasn't a real world out there.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there,
p92
aVand that's what I spent about two years visiting,
p93
aVthese places of the Internet. I was in large data centers
p94
aVthat use as much power as the cities in which they sit,
p95
aVand I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York,
p96
aVwhich is one of the buildings in the world,
p97
aVone of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings,
p98
aVwhere more networks of the Internet connect to each other
p99
aVthan anywhere else.
p100
aVAnd that connection is an unequivocally physical process.
p101
aVIt's about the router of one network, a Facebook or
p102
aVa Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is,
p103
aVconnecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into
p104
aVthe ceiling and down into the router of another network,
p105
aVand that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.
p106
aVA building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others,
p107
aVhas 10 times more networks connecting within it
p108
aVthan the next tier of buildings.
p109
aVThere's a very short list of these places.
p110
aVAnd 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home
p111
aVto about a half a dozen very important networks,
p112
aVwhich are the networks which serve the undersea cables
p113
aVthat travel underneath the ocean
p114
aVthat connect Europe and America and connect all of us.
p115
aVAnd it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.
p116
aa(lp117
VIf the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live
p118
aVin a global village, it's because there are cables underneath
p119
aVthe ocean, cables like this.
p120
aVAnd in this dimension, they are incredibly small.
p121
aVYou can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.
p122
aVBut in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive,
p123
aVas expansive as you can imagine.
p124
aVThey stretch across the ocean. They're three or five
p125
aVor eight thousand miles in length, and
p126
aVif the material science and the computational technology
p127
aVis incredibly complicated, the basic physical process
p128
aVis shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean
p129
aVand comes out on the other, and it usually comes
p130
aVfrom a building called a landing station that's often
p131
aVtucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood,
p132
aVand there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor
p133
aVthat look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles
p134
aVthey amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission
p135
aVis incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second
p136
aVwavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own
p137
aVconnection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams,
p138
aVbut not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light
p139
aVthrough one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe
p140
aV50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light
p141
aVthrough a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe
p142
aVeight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.
p143
aVAnd they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd then they connect to the continent somewhere.
p146
aVThey connect in a manhole like this. Literally,
p147
aVthis is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.
p148
aVThis is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.
p149
aVAnd the landscape is changing. Three years ago,
p150
aVwhen I started thinking about this, there was one cable
p151
aVdown the Western coast of Africa, represented
p152
aVin this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.
p153
aVNow there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.
p154
aVBecause once a country gets plugged in by one cable,
p155
aVthey realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build
p156
aVan industry around it, they need to know that their connection
p157
aVisn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks,
p158
aVyou have to send a ship out into the water, throw
p159
aVa grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end,
p160
aVand then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.
p161
aVIt's an intensely, intensely physical process.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recently
p164
aVworked for Tata Communications, the communications wing
p165
aVof Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.
p166
aVAnd I've never met him. We've only communicated
p167
aVvia this telepresence system, which always makes me
p168
aVthink of him as the man inside the Internet. (Laughter)
p169
aVAnd he is English. The undersea cable industry
p170
aVis dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.
p171
aV(Laughter) Because they all started at the same time
p172
aVwith the boom about 20 years ago.
p173
aVAnd Tata had gotten its start as a communications business
p174
aVwhen they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic
p175
aVand one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces
p176
aVonto them, until they had built a belt around the world,
p177
aVwhich means they will send your bits to the East or the West.
p178
aVThey have \u2014 this is literally a beam of light around the world,
p179
aVand if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around
p180
aVthe other direction. And then having done that,
p181
aVthey started to look for places to wire next.
p182
aVThey looked for the unwired places, and that's meant
p183
aVNorth and South, primarily these cables to Africa.
p184
aVBut what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.
p185
aVHe thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd I was particularly interested because I wanted to see
p188
aVone of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time
p189
aVonline we experience these fleeting moments of connection,
p190
aVthese sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post
p191
aVor an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.
p192
aVIt seemed like there was a moment when the continent
p193
aVwas being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.
p194
aVAnd Simon was working on a new cable,
p195
aVWACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched
p196
aVfrom Lisbon down the west coast of Africa,
p197
aVto Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.
p198
aVAnd he said there was coming soon, depending
p199
aVon the weather, but he'd let me know when,
p200
aVand so with about four days notice, he said to go
p201
aVto this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9,
p202
aVthis guy will walk out of the water. (Laughter)
p203
aVAnd he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line,
p204
aVcalled a messenger line, and that was the first link
p205
aVbetween sea and land, this link that would then be
p206
aVleveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.
p207
aVThen a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this
p208
aVspecialized cable landing ship, and it was floated
p209
aVon these buoys until it was in the right place.
p210
aVThen you can see the English engineers looking on.
p211
aVAnd then, once it was in the right place, he got back
p212
aVin the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off,
p213
aVand the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable
p214
aVdropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out
p215
aVto the ship, and when he got there,
p216
aVthey gave him a glass of juice and a cookie,
p217
aVand then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore,
p218
aVand then he lit a cigarette. (Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd then once that cable was on shore,
p221
aVthey began to prepare to connect it to the other side,
p222
aVfor the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.
p223
aVAnd first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start
p224
aVsort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a \u2014
p225
aVsort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working
p226
aVlike jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up
p227
aVwith the cable that had come down,
p228
aVand with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.
p229
aVAnd when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw,
p230
aVyou stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.
p231
aVIt starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.
p232
aVAnd what surprised me as well was that as much as this
p233
aVis based on the most sophisticated technology, as much
p234
aVas this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process
p235
aVitself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.
p236
aVYou see the local laborers. You see the English engineer
p237
aVgiving directions in the background. And more importantly,
p238
aVthe places are the same. These cables still connect
p239
aVthese classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa,
p240
aVMumbai, Singapore, New York.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd then the process on shore takes around three or four days,
p243
aVand then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover
p244
aVback on top, and they push the sand over that,
p245
aVand we all forget about it.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud,
p248
aVbut every time we put something on the cloud,
p249
aVwe give up some responsibility for it.
p250
aVWe are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.
p251
aVAnd that doesn't seem right.
p252
aVThere's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says
p253
aVthat wired people should know something about wires.
p254
aVAnd we should know, I think, we should know
p255
aVwhere our Internet comes from, and we should know
p256
aVwhat it is that physically, physically connects us all.
p257
aVThank you. (Applause)
p258
aV(Applause)
p259
aVThanks. (Applause)

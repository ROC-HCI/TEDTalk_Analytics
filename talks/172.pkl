VOn simplicity. What a great way to start.
p5
aVFirst of all, I've been watching this trend
p6
aVwhere we have these books like such and such "For Dummies."
p7
aVDo you know these books, these such and such "For Dummies?"
p8
aVMy daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVBut I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.
p11
aVYou know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?"
p12
aVThere's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.
p13
aVWe like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut I really like that, so I wrote a book called "The Laws of Simplicity."
p16
aVI was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.
p17
aVIt's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.
p18
aVVery few answers. I'm also wondering myself, what is simplicity?
p19
aVIs it good? Is it bad? Is complexity better? I'm not sure.
p20
aa(lp21
VAfter I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity,"
p22
aVI was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.
p23
aVAnd so in my life, I've discovered that
p24
aVvacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever.
p25
aVBecause your companies will always take away your life,
p26
aVbut they can never take away your vacation \u2014 in theory.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VSo, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity,
p30
aVand I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.
p31
aVSo I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever,
p32
aVand unfortunately, their branding was all about "Keep It Simple."
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVI opened up a magazine, and Visa's branding was,
p35
aV"Business Takes Simplicity."
p36
aVI develop photographs, and Kodak said, "Keep It Simple."
p37
aVSo, I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo, I turned on the TV, and I don't watch TV very much,
p40
aVbut you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently.
p41
aVAnd she has this show, "The Simple Life."
p42
aVSo I watched this. It's not very simple, a little bit confusing.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVSo, I looked for a different show to watch.
p45
aVSo, I opened up this TV Guide thing,
p46
aVand on the E! channel, this "Simple Life" show is very popular.
p47
aVThey'll play it over, and over, and over.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVSo it was traumatizing, actually.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo, I wanted to escape again, so I went out to my car.
p52
aVAnd Cape Cod, there are idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room.
p53
aVAnd when you drive, these signs are very important.
p54
aVIt's a very simple sign, it says, "road" and "road approaching."
p55
aVSo I'm mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVSo, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly,
p58
aVso I thought, "Ah, simplicity. Very important."
p59
aa(lp60
VBut then I thought, "Oh, simplicity. What would that be like on a beach?
p61
aVWhat if the sky was 41 percent gray? Wouldn't that be the perfect sky?"
p62
aVI mean that simplicity sky.
p63
aVBut in reality, the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful, complex sky.
p64
aa(lp65
VYou know, with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity.
p66
aVWe're human beings: we love complex things.
p67
aVWe love relationships \u2014 very complex. So we love this kind of stuff.
p68
aa(lp69
VI'm at this place called the Media Lab.
p70
aVMaybe some of you guys have heard of this place.
p71
aVIt's designed by I. M. Pei, one of the premier modernist architects.
p72
aVModernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVAnd some of you guys are entrepreneurs, etc., whatever.
p75
aVLast month, I was at Google, and, boy, that cafeteria, man.
p76
aVYou guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options.
p77
aVSee, in academia, we get titles, lots of titles.
p78
aa(lp79
VLast year at TED, these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles.
p80
aVI have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters.
p81
aVThis year at TED, I'm happy to report that I have new titles,
p82
aVin addition to my previous titles.
p83
aVAnother "Associate Director of Research."
p84
aVAnd this also happened, so I have five daughters now.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVThat's my baby Reina. (Applause) Thank you.
p87
aVAnd so, my life is much more complex because of the baby, actually,
p88
aVbut that's okay. We will still stay married, I think.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut looking way back, when I was a child \u2014
p91
aVyou see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
p92
aVMany of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu,
p93
aVbut tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food.
p94
aVIt's very hard work to make tofu.
p95
aVAs a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m. and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.
p96
aVMy father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.
p97
aVSo often, seven days a week. Family business equals child labor.
p98
aa(lp99
VWe were a great model. So, I loved going to school.
p100
aVSchool was great, and maybe going to school
p101
aVhelped me get to this Media Lab place, I'm not sure.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVThank you.
p104
aVBut the Media Lab is an interesting place, and it's important to me
p105
aVbecause as a student, I was a computer science undergrad,
p106
aVand I discovered design later on in my life.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd there was this person, Muriel Cooper.
p109
aVWho knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper?
p110
aVWasn't she amazing? Muriel Cooper. She was wacky.
p111
aVAnd she was a TEDster, exactly, and she showed us,
p112
aVshe showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again.
p113
aVAnd she's very important in my life,
p114
aVbecause she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.
p115
aVIt was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school, because of her.
p116
aVShe passed away in 1994,
p117
aVand I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes, but it's so hard.
p118
aVThis amazing person, Muriel Cooper.
p119
aa(lp120
VWhen I was in Japan \u2014 I went to an art school in Japan \u2014
p121
aVI had a nice sort of situation, because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.
p122
aVSome of you guys know Paul Rand,
p123
aVthe greatest graphic designer \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 out there.
p124
aVThe great graphic designer Paul Rand
p125
aVdesigned the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.
p126
aVHe basically said, "I've designed everything."
p127
aVAnd also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life \u2014
p128
aVthe Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan,
p129
aVlike Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhen you have mentors \u2014 and yesterday,
p132
aVKareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors,
p133
aVthese people in your life \u2014 the problem with mentors is that they all die.
p134
aVThis is a sad thing, but it's actually a happy thing in a way,
p135
aVbecause you can remember them in their pure form.
p136
aVI think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.
p137
aVWhen you get older, and you're all freaked out, whatever,
p138
aVthe mentors calm us down.
p139
aVAnd I'm grateful for my mentors, and I'm sure all of you are too.
p140
aa(lp141
VBecause the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT.
p142
aVThe T doesn't stand for "human," it stands for "technology."
p143
aVAnd because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.
p144
aVSo, I've always been Googling this word, "human,"
p145
aVto find out how many hits I get.
p146
aVAnd in 2001, I had 26 million hits, and for "computer,"
p147
aVbecause computers are against humans a bit,
p148
aa(lp149
VI have 42 million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here.
p150
aVSo, if you sort of compare that, like this,
p151
aVyou'll see that computer versus human \u2014
p152
aVI've been tracking this for the last year \u2014
p153
aVcomputer versus human over the last year has changed.
p154
aVIt used to be kind of two to one. Now, humans are catching up.
p155
aVVery good, us humans! We're catching up with the computers.
p156
aVIn the simplicity realm, it's also interesting.
p157
aVSo if you compare complexities to simplicity,
p158
aVit's also catching up in a way, too.
p159
aVSo, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think.
p160
aa(lp161
VI have a confession: I'm not a man of simplicity.
p162
aVI spent my entire early career making complex stuff.
p163
aVLots of complex stuff.
p164
aVI wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.
p165
aVI had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.
p166
aVAnd I've always felt bad about it, in a sense.
p167
aVSo, I hid in a time dimension.
p168
aVI built things in a time-graphics dimension.
p169
aVI did this series of calendars for Shiseido.
p170
aVThis is a floral theme calendar in 1997,
p171
aVand this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space,
p172
aVbecause the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks,
p173
aVyou're cooler for some reason.
p174
aVThis is why they have fireworks in the summer.
p175
aVA very extreme culture.
p176
aVLastly, this is a fall-based calendar,
p177
aVbecause I have so many leaves in my yard.
p178
aVSo this is the leaves in my yard, essentially.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd so I made a lot of these types of things.
p181
aVI've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things,
p182
aVand so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.
p183
aVI feel kind of bad about that.
p184
aVTomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola.
p185
aVShe has this show right now at MoMA,
p186
aVwhere some of these early works are here on display at MoMA, on the walls.
p187
aVIf you're in New York, please go and see that.
p188
aa(lp189
VBut I've had a problem, because I make all this flying stuff
p190
aVand people say, "Oh, I know your work.
p191
aVYou're the guy that makes eye candy."
p192
aVAnd when you're told this, you feel kind of weird.
p193
aV"Eye candy" \u2014 sort of pejorative, don't you think?
p194
aVSo, I say, "No, I make eye meat," instead.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVAnd eye meat is something different, something more fibrous,
p197
aVsomething more powerful, perhaps. But what could that be, eye meat?
p198
aa(lp199
VI've been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.
p200
aVComputer programs are essentially trees,
p201
aVand when you make art with a computer program, there's kind of a problem.
p202
aVWhenever you make art with a computer program,
p203
aVyou're always on the tree, and the paradox is that
p204
aVfor excellent art, you want to be off the tree.
p205
aVSo, this is sort of a complication I've found.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo, to get off the tree, I began to use my old computers.
p208
aVI took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.
p209
aVThis is a new way to type, on my old, color Classic.
p210
aVYou can't type very much on this.
p211
aVI also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions
p212
aVand starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine.
p213
aVAnd also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing \u2014
p214
aVthat caddy would come out, like, dangerous, like, "whack," like that.
p215
aVBut I thought, "This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test?"
p216
aVSo I have a crash test.
p217
aV(Laughter)
p218
aVAnd sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made,
p219
aVjust to sort of understand what these things are.
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VShortly after this, 9/11 happened, and I was very depressed.
p223
aVI was concerned with contemporary art
p224
aVthat was all about piss, and sort of really sad things,
p225
aVand so I wanted to think about something happy.
p226
aVSo I focused on food as my area \u2014
p227
aVthese sort of clementine peel things.
p228
aVIn Japan, it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel
p229
aVjust in one piece. Who's done that before? One-piece clementine?
p230
aVOh, you guys are missing out, if you haven't done it yet.
p231
aVIt was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this,
p232
aVactually, in different forms.
p233
aVIf you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff,
p234
aVand my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo, I went back to the computer, and I bought five large fries,
p237
aVand scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme,
p238
aVand I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images.
p239
aVAnd as a child, I'd hear that song, you know,
p240
aV"Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain,"
p241
aVso I made this amber waves image.
p242
aVIt's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd also, as a child, I was the fattest kid in class,
p245
aVso I used to love Cheetos. Oh, I love Cheetos, yummy.
p246
aVSo, I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way.
p247
aVI wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint.
p248
aVCheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVI discovered that Cheetos are good, expressive material.
p251
aVAnd with these Cheetos, I began to think,
p252
aV"What can I make with these Cheetos?"
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd so, I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks, and also pretzels.
p255
aVI was looking for some kind of form,
p256
aVand in the end, I made 100 butter-fries. Do you get it?
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVAnd each butter-fry is composed of different pieces.
p259
aVPeople ask me how they make the antenna.
p260
aVSometimes, they find a hair in the food. That's my hair.
p261
aVMy hair's clean \u2014 it's okay.
p262
aa(lp263
VI'm a tenured professor, which means, basically, I don't have to work anymore.
p264
aVIt's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday
p265
aVand staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte.
p266
aVEnd of story.
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aVBut I realized that life could be very boring,
p269
aVso I've been thinking about life, and I notice that my camera \u2014
p270
aVmy digital camera versus my car, a very strange thing.
p271
aVThe car is so big, the camera is so small,
p272
aVyet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual.
p273
aVIt doesn't make any sense.
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VSo, I was in the Cape one time, and I typed the word "simplicity,"
p277
aVand I discovered, in this weird, M. Night Shyamalan way,
p278
aVthat I discovered [the] letters, M, I, T. You know the word?
p279
aVIn the words "simplicity" and "complexity," M, I, T occur in perfect sequence.
p280
aVIt's a bit eerie, isn't it?
p281
aVSo, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity."
p284
aVIt's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.
p285
aVThe ten laws and three keys \u2014 I won't go over them because that's why I have a book,
p286
aVand also that's why it's on the Web for free.
p287
aVBut the laws are kind of like sushi in a way: there are all kinds.
p288
aVIn Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.
p289
aVYou know the uni is the most challenging, so number ten is challenging.
p290
aVPeople hate number ten like they hate uni, actually.
p291
aVThe three keys are easy to eat, so this is anago, cooked already, so easy to eat.
p292
aVSo enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity.
p293
aVBecause I want to simplify them for you.
p294
aVBecause that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo, if I simplify the laws of simplicity,
p297
aVI have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing.
p298
aVAnyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid
p299
aVa big cookie or a small cookie,
p300
aVwhich cookie are they going to take? The big cookie.
p301
aVYou can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it,
p302
aVbut it doesn't work. They want the big cookie.
p303
aVBut if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold,
p304
aVthe small pile or the big pile, which will they choose?
p305
aa(lp306
VStrangely, not the big pile. So, I think it's as simple as this.
p307
aVYou know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it.
p308
aVWhen you want less, it's because it's about work.
p309
aVAnd so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life
p310
aVwith more enjoyment and less pain.
p311
aVI think this is sort of simple more versus less.
p312
aVBasically, it always depends.
p313
aVThis book I wrote because I want to figure out life.
p314
aVI love life. I love being alive. I like to see things.
p315
aVAnd so life is a big question, I think, in simplicity,
p316
aVbecause you're trying to simplify your life.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place.
p319
aVBy being at TED, we see so many things at one time.
p320
aVAnd I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world.
p321
aVLike everything you see, every time you wake up.
p322
aVIt's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world.
p323
aVFrom everything from a weird hotel lobby,
p324
aVto Saran wrap placed over your window,
p325
aVto this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black,
p326
aVand this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd so, this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here,
p329
aVbecause life is finite.
p330
aVThis was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.
p331
aVHe's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are \u2014
p332
aVtwelve years old, twenty-four years old, seventy-four, ninety-six years old \u2014
p333
aVand this is some medical data. So, brain strength increases up to 60,
p334
aVand then after 60, it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way.
p335
aa(lp336
VAlso, if you look at your physical strength.
p337
aVYou know, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them,
p338
aV"Oh, your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger,
p339
aVbut in your late twenties and mid-thirties, cells, they die."
p340
aVOK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes.
p341
aVAnd if you have your vision, vision is interesting.
p342
aVAs you age from infant age, your vision gets better,
p343
aVand maybe in your late teens, early twenties, you're looking for a mate,
p344
aVand your vision goes after that.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VYour social responsibility is very interesting.
p348
aVSo, as you get older, you may, like, have kids, whatever.
p349
aVAnd then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more \u2014
p350
aVthat's very good, too.
p351
aa(lp352
VBut if any of you people ask,
p353
aV"What actually goes up? Does anything go up?
p354
aVWhat's the positive part of this, you know?" I think wisdom always goes up.
p355
aVI love these eighty-year-old, ninety-year-old guys and women.
p356
aVThey have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom,
p357
aVand I think \u2014 you know, this TED thing, I've come here.
p358
aVAnd this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.
p359
aVThis whole TED effect, it sort of ups your wisdom, somehow.
p360
aVAnd I'm so glad to be here, and I'm very grateful to be here, Chris.
p361
aVAnd this is an amazing experience for me as well.

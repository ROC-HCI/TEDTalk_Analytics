VI'm standing in front of you today
p5
aVin all humility,
p6
aVwanting to share with you
p7
aVmy journey of the last six years
p8
aVin the field of service
p9
aVand education.
p10
aVAnd I'm not a trained academic.
p11
aVNeither am I a veteran social worker.
p12
aVI was 26 years in the corporate world,
p13
aVtrying to make organizations profitable.
p14
aVAnd then in 2003
p15
aVI started Parikrma Humanity Foundation
p16
aVfrom my kitchen table.
p17
aa(lp18
VThe first thing that we did was walk through the slums.
p19
aVYou know, by the way, there are two million people
p20
aVin Bangalore, who live in 800 slums.
p21
aVWe couldn't go to all the slums,
p22
aVbut we tried to cover as much as we could.
p23
aVWe walked through these slums,
p24
aVidentified houses where children would never go to school.
p25
aVWe talked to the parents,
p26
aVtried to convince them about sending their children to school.
p27
aVWe played with the children,
p28
aVand came back home really tired,
p29
aVexhausted, but with images
p30
aVof bright faces, twinkling eyes,
p31
aVand went to sleep.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe were all excited to start,
p34
aVbut the numbers hit us then:
p35
aV200 million children
p36
aVbetween four to 14 that
p37
aVshould be going to school, but do not;
p38
aV100 million children
p39
aVwho go to school but cannot read;
p40
aV125 million who cannot do basic maths.
p41
aVWe also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees
p42
aVwas dedicated for government schooling.
p43
aVNinety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary
p44
aVand administrators' salary.
p45
aVAnd yet, India has nearly
p46
aVthe highest teacher absenteeism
p47
aVin the world,
p48
aVwith one out of four teachers
p49
aVnot going to school at all the entire academic year.
p50
aa(lp51
VThose numbers were absolutely mind-boggling,
p52
aVoverwhelming, and we were constantly asked,
p53
aV"When will you start? How many schools will you start?
p54
aVHow many children will you get?
p55
aVHow are you going to scale?
p56
aVHow are you going to replicate?"
p57
aVIt was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted.
p58
aVBut we dug our heels
p59
aVand said, "We're not in the number game.
p60
aVWe want to take one child at a time
p61
aVand take the child right through school,
p62
aVsent to college,
p63
aVand get them prepared for better living,
p64
aVa high value job."
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, we started Parikrma.
p67
aVThe first Parikrma school
p68
aVstarted in a slum
p69
aVwhere there were 70,000 people
p70
aVliving below the poverty line.
p71
aVOur first school was
p72
aVon a rooftop of a building inside the slums,
p73
aVa second story building, the only second story building
p74
aVinside the slums.
p75
aVAnd that rooftop did not have
p76
aVany ceiling, only half a tin sheet.
p77
aVThat was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children.
p78
aVIndian academic year begins in June.
p79
aVSo, June it rains, so many a times
p80
aVall of us would be huddled under the tin roof,
p81
aVwaiting for the rain to stop.
p82
aVMy God! What a bonding exercise that was.
p83
aVAnd all of us
p84
aVthat were under that roof are still here together today.
p85
aVThen came the second school,
p86
aVthe third school, the fourth school
p87
aVand a junior college.
p88
aVIn six years now,
p89
aVwe have four schools, one junior college,
p90
aV1,100 children
p91
aVcoming from 28 slums
p92
aVand four orphanages.
p93
aV(Applause)
p94
aa(lp95
VOur dream is very simple:
p96
aVto send each of these kids, get them prepared
p97
aVto be educated
p98
aVbut also to live peacefully,
p99
aVcontented in this conflict-ridden
p100
aVchaotic globalized world.
p101
aVNow, when you talk global
p102
aVyou have to talk English.
p103
aVAnd so all our schools
p104
aVare English medium schools.
p105
aVBut they know there is this myth
p106
aVthat children from the slums
p107
aVcannot speak English well.
p108
aVNo one in their family has spoken English.
p109
aVNo one in their generation has spoken English.
p110
aVBut how wrong it is.
p111
aa(lp112
VGirl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites
p113
aVare Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear]
p114
aVand Hardy Boys.
p115
aVAlthough they are like
p116
aVin different contexts,
p117
aVone is magical, the other two are like investigation,
p118
aVI like those books because
p119
aVthey have something special in them.
p120
aVThe vocabulary used in those books
p121
aVand the style of writing.
p122
aVI mean like once I pick up one book
p123
aVI cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.
p124
aVEven if it takes me four and a half hours,
p125
aVor three and half hours to finish my book, I do it.
p126
aa(lp127
VBoy: I did good research and I got the information
p128
aV[on the] world's fastest cars.
p129
aVI like Ducati ZZ143,
p130
aVbecause it is the fastest,
p131
aVthe world's fastest bike,
p132
aVand I like Pulsar 220 DTSI
p133
aVbecause it is India's fastest bike. (Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VShukla Bose: Well, that girl that you saw,
p136
aVher father sells flowers on the roadside.
p137
aVAnd this little boy has been coming to school for five years.
p138
aVBut isn't it strange that little boys all over the world
p139
aVlove fast bikes? (Laughter)
p140
aVHe hasn't seen one, he hasn't ridden one, of course,
p141
aVbut he has done a lot of research through Google search.
p142
aVYou know, when we started with our English medium schools
p143
aVwe also decided to adopt
p144
aVthe best curriculum possible,
p145
aVthe ICSE curriculum.
p146
aVAnd again, there were people who laughed at me
p147
aVand said, "Don't be crazy
p148
aVchoosing such a tough curriculum for these students.
p149
aVThey'll never be able to cope."
p150
aVNot only do our children cope very well,
p151
aVbut they excel in it.
p152
aVYou should just come across to see
p153
aVhow well our children do.
p154
aa(lp155
VThere is also this myth that
p156
aVparents from the slums
p157
aVare not interested in their children going to school;
p158
aVthey'd much rather put them to work.
p159
aVThat's absolute hogwash.
p160
aVAll parents all over the world
p161
aVwant their children to lead a better life than themselves,
p162
aVbut they need to believe that change is possible.
p163
aa(lp164
VVideo: (Hindi)
p165
aa(lp166
VSB: We have 80 percent attendance
p167
aVfor all our parents-teachers meeting.
p168
aVSometimes it's even 100 percent,
p169
aVmuch more than many privileged schools.
p170
aVFathers have started to attend.
p171
aVIt's very interesting. When we started our school
p172
aVthe parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register.
p173
aVNow they have started writing their signature.
p174
aVThe children have taught them.
p175
aVIt's amazing how much children can teach.
p176
aa(lp177
VWe have, a few months ago,
p178
aVactually late last year,
p179
aVwe had a few mothers who came to us and said,
p180
aV"You know, we want to learn how to read and write.
p181
aVCan you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool
p182
aVfor our parents, for our mothers.
p183
aVWe had 25 mothers who came regularly
p184
aVafter school to study.
p185
aVWe want to continue with this program
p186
aVand extend it to all our other schools.
p187
aa(lp188
VNinety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics.
p189
aVSo, you can imagine how traumatized
p190
aVand how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from.
p191
aVWe have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs
p192
aVand when they come back,
p193
aVmost times sober, we have to find a job for them
p194
aVso that they don't regress.
p195
aVWe have about three fathers who have been trained to cook.
p196
aVWe have taught them nutrition, hygiene.
p197
aVWe have helped them set up the kitchen
p198
aVand now they are supplying food to all our children.
p199
aVThey do a very good job because
p200
aVtheir children are eating their food,
p201
aVbut most importantly this is the first time
p202
aVthey have got respect,
p203
aVand they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.
p204
aa(lp205
VMore than 90 percent of our non-teaching staff
p206
aVare all parents and extended families.
p207
aVWe've started many programs
p208
aVjust to make sure that the child comes to school.
p209
aVVocational skill program for the older siblings
p210
aVso the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school.
p211
aa(lp212
VThere is also this myth that children from the slums
p213
aVcannot integrate with mainstream.
p214
aVTake a look at this little girl
p215
aVwho was one of the 28 children
p216
aVfrom all privileged schools,
p217
aVbest schools in the country
p218
aVthat was selected for the Duke University
p219
aVtalent identification program
p220
aVand was sent to IIM Ahmedabad.
p221
aa(lp222
VVideo: Girl: Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA,
p223
aVit was such a pride for us to go to that camp.
p224
aVEverybody was very friendly,
p225
aVespecially I got a lot of friends.
p226
aVAnd I felt that my English has improved a lot
p227
aVgoing there and chatting with friends.
p228
aVThere they met children who are
p229
aVwith a different standard and
p230
aVa different mindset, a totally different society.
p231
aVI mingled with almost everyone.
p232
aVThey were very friendly.
p233
aVI had very good friends there,
p234
aVwho are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai.
p235
aVEven now we are in touch through Facebook.
p236
aa(lp237
VAfter this Ahmedabad trip
p238
aVI've been like a totally different
p239
aVmingling with people and all of those.
p240
aVBefore that I feel like I wasn't like this.
p241
aVI don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly.
p242
aVMy accent with English improved a lot.
p243
aVAnd I learned football, volleyball,
p244
aVFrisbee, lots of games.
p245
aVAnd I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.
p246
aVSuch beautiful food,
p247
aVI enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.
p248
aVI enjoyed eating food like
p249
aV[unclear] would come and ask me,
p250
aV"Yes ma'am, what you want?" It was so good to hear!
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aV(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VSB: This girl was working as a maid
p256
aVbefore she came to school.
p257
aVAnd today she wants to be a neurologist.
p258
aa(lp259
VOur children are doing brilliantly in sports.
p260
aVThey are really excelling.
p261
aVThere is an inter-school athletic competition
p262
aVthat is held every year
p263
aVin Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate
p264
aVfrom 140 best schools in the city.
p265
aVWe've got the best school award for three years successively.
p266
aVAnd our children are coming back home
p267
aVwith bags full of medals, with lots of admirers and friends.
p268
aVLast year there were a couple of kids
p269
aVfrom elite schools that came
p270
aVto ask for admissions in our school.
p271
aVWe also have our very own dream team.
p272
aa(lp273
VWhy is this happening? Why this confidence?
p274
aVIs it the exposure? We have professors
p275
aVfrom MIT, Berkeley, Stanford,
p276
aVIndian Institute of Science
p277
aVwho come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas,
p278
aVexperiments, much beyond the classroom.
p279
aVArt, music are considered
p280
aVtherapy and mediums of expression.
p281
aVWe also believe that
p282
aVit's the content that is more important.
p283
aVIt is not the infrastructure,
p284
aVnot the toilets, not the libraries,
p285
aVbut it is what actually happens in this school
p286
aVthat is more important.
p287
aVCreating an environment of learning,
p288
aVof inquiry, of exploration
p289
aVis what is true education.
p290
aa(lp291
VWhen we started Parikrma
p292
aVwe had no idea which direction we were taking.
p293
aVWe didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan.
p294
aVBut we know for sure that
p295
aVwhat we want to do today is
p296
aVtake one child at a time,
p297
aVnot get bogged with numbers,
p298
aVand actually see the child complete
p299
aVthe circle of life,
p300
aVand unleash his total potential.
p301
aVWe do not believe in scale
p302
aVbecause we believe in quality,
p303
aVand scale and numbers will automatically happen.
p304
aVWe have corporates that have stood behind us,
p305
aVand we are able to, now, open more schools.
p306
aVBut we began with the idea
p307
aVof one child at a time.
p308
aa(lp309
VThis is five-year-old Parusharam.
p310
aVHe was begging
p311
aVby a bus stop a few years ago,
p312
aVgot picked up and is now in an orphanage,
p313
aVhas been coming to school for the last four and a half months.
p314
aVHe's in kindergarten.
p315
aVHe has learned how to speak English.
p316
aVWe have a model by which kids can speak English
p317
aVand understand English
p318
aVin three month's time.
p319
aVHe can tell you stories in English
p320
aVof the thirsty crow, of the crocodile
p321
aVand of the giraffe.
p322
aVAnd if you ask him what he likes to do
p323
aVhe will say, "I like sleeping.
p324
aVI like eating. I like playing."
p325
aVAnd if you ask him what he wants to do,
p326
aVhe will say, "I want to horsing."
p327
aVNow, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.
p328
aVSo, Parusharam comes to my office every day.
p329
aVHe comes for a tummy rub,
p330
aVbecause he believes that will give me luck. (Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VWhen I started Parikrma
p333
aVI began with a great deal of arrogance
p334
aVof transforming the world.
p335
aVBut today I have been transformed.
p336
aVI have been changed with my children.
p337
aVI've learned so much from them:
p338
aVlove, compassion, imagination
p339
aVand such creativity.
p340
aVParusharam is Parikrma
p341
aVwith a simple beginning but a long way to go.
p342
aVI promise you, Parusharam
p343
aVwill speak in the TED conference a few years from now.
p344
aVThank you.
p345
aV(Applause)

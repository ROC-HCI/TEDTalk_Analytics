VToday, I'm going to take you
p5
aVaround the world in 18 minutes.
p6
aVMy base of operations is in the U.S.,
p7
aVbut let's start at the other end of the map,
p8
aVin Kyoto, Japan,
p9
aVwhere I was living with a Japanese family
p10
aVwhile I was doing part of my dissertational research
p11
aV15 years ago.
p12
aVI knew even then that I would encounter
p13
aVcultural differences and misunderstandings,
p14
aVbut they popped up when I least expected it.
p15
aa(lp16
VOn my first day,
p17
aVI went to a restaurant,
p18
aVand I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.
p19
aVAfter a pause, the waiter said,
p20
aV"One does not put sugar in green tea."
p21
aV"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.
p22
aVBut I really like my tea sweet."
p23
aVIn response, he gave me an even more courteous version
p24
aVof the same explanation.
p25
aV"One does not put sugar
p26
aVin green tea."
p27
aV"I understand," I said,
p28
aV"that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,
p29
aVbut I'd like to put some sugar
p30
aVin my green tea."
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVSurprised by my insistence,
p33
aVthe waiter took up the issue with the manager.
p34
aVPretty soon,
p35
aVa lengthy discussion ensued,
p36
aVand finally the manager came over to me and said,
p37
aV"I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVWell, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,
p40
aVI ordered a cup of coffee,
p41
aVwhich the waiter brought over promptly.
p42
aVResting on the saucer
p43
aVwere two packets of sugar.
p44
aa(lp45
VMy failure to procure myself
p46
aVa cup of sweet, green tea
p47
aVwas not due to a simple misunderstanding.
p48
aVThis was due to a fundamental difference
p49
aVin our ideas about choice.
p50
aVFrom my American perspective,
p51
aVwhen a paying customer makes a reasonable request
p52
aVbased on her preferences,
p53
aVshe has every right to have that request met.
p54
aVThe American way, to quote Burger King,
p55
aVis to "have it your way,"
p56
aVbecause, as Starbucks says,
p57
aV"happiness is in your choices."
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVBut from the Japanese perspective,
p60
aVit's their duty to protect those who don't know any better \u2014
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVin this case, the ignorant gaijin \u2014
p63
aVfrom making the wrong choice.
p64
aVLet's face it: the way I wanted my tea
p65
aVwas inappropriate according to cultural standards,
p66
aVand they were doing their best to help me save face.
p67
aa(lp68
VAmericans tend to believe
p69
aVthat they've reached some sort of pinnacle
p70
aVin the way they practice choice.
p71
aVThey think that choice, as seen through the American lens
p72
aVbest fulfills an innate and universal
p73
aVdesire for choice in all humans.
p74
aVUnfortunately,
p75
aVthese beliefs are based on assumptions
p76
aVthat don't always hold true
p77
aVin many countries, in many cultures.
p78
aVAt times they don't even hold true
p79
aVat America's own borders.
p80
aVI'd like to discuss some of these assumptions
p81
aVand the problems associated with them.
p82
aVAs I do so, I hope you'll start thinking
p83
aVabout some of your own assumptions
p84
aVand how they were shaped by your backgrounds.
p85
aa(lp86
VFirst assumption:
p87
aVif a choice affects you,
p88
aVthen you should be the one to make it.
p89
aVThis is the only way to ensure
p90
aVthat your preferences and interests
p91
aVwill be most fully accounted for.
p92
aVIt is essential for success.
p93
aVIn America, the primary locus of choice
p94
aVis the individual.
p95
aVPeople must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,
p96
aVregardless of what other people want or recommend.
p97
aVIt's called "being true to yourself."
p98
aVBut do all individuals benefit
p99
aVfrom taking such an approach to choice?
p100
aVMark Lepper and I did a series of studies
p101
aVin which we sought the answer to this very question.
p102
aVIn one study,
p103
aVwhich we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,
p104
aVwe brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children
p105
aVinto the laboratory,
p106
aVand we divided them up into three groups.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe first group came in,
p109
aVand they were greeted by Miss Smith,
p110
aVwho showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.
p111
aVThe kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,
p112
aVand they even got to choose which marker
p113
aVthey would write their answers with.
p114
aVWhen the second group of children came in,
p115
aVthey were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,
p116
aVbut this time Miss Smith told them
p117
aVwhich anagrams to do
p118
aVand which markers to write their answers with.
p119
aVNow when the third group came in,
p120
aVthey were told that their anagrams and their markers
p121
aVhad been chosen by their mothers.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVIn reality,
p124
aVthe kids who were told what to do,
p125
aVwhether by Miss Smith or their mothers,
p126
aVwere actually given the very same activity,
p127
aVwhich their counterparts in the first group
p128
aVhad freely chosen.
p129
aa(lp130
VWith this procedure, we were able to ensure
p131
aVthat the kids across the three groups
p132
aVall did the same activity,
p133
aVmaking it easier for us to compare performance.
p134
aVSuch small differences in the way we administered the activity
p135
aVyielded striking differences
p136
aVin how well they performed.
p137
aVAnglo-Americans,
p138
aVthey did two and a half times more anagrams
p139
aVwhen they got to choose them,
p140
aVas compared to when it was
p141
aVchosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.
p142
aVIt didn't matter who did the choosing,
p143
aVif the task was dictated by another,
p144
aVtheir performance suffered.
p145
aVIn fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed
p146
aVwhen they were told that their mothers had been consulted.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVOne girl named Mary said,
p149
aV"You asked my mother?"
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VIn contrast,
p154
aVAsian-American children
p155
aVperformed best when they believed
p156
aVtheir mothers had made the choice,
p157
aVsecond best when they chose for themselves,
p158
aVand least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.
p159
aVA girl named Natsumi
p160
aVeven approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room
p161
aVand tugged on her skirt and asked,
p162
aV"Could you please tell my mommy
p163
aVI did it just like she said?"
p164
aVThe first-generation children were strongly influenced
p165
aVby their immigrant parents'
p166
aVapproach to choice.
p167
aVFor them, choice was not just a way
p168
aVof defining and asserting
p169
aVtheir individuality,
p170
aVbut a way to create community and harmony
p171
aVby deferring to the choices
p172
aVof people whom they trusted and respected.
p173
aVIf they had a concept of being true to one's self,
p174
aVthen that self, most likely,
p175
aV[was] composed, not of an individual,
p176
aVbut of a collective.
p177
aVSuccess was just as much about pleasing key figures
p178
aVas it was about satisfying
p179
aVone's own preferences.
p180
aVOr, you could say that
p181
aVthe individual's preferences were shaped
p182
aVby the preferences of specific others.
p183
aa(lp184
VThe assumption then that we do best
p185
aVwhen the individual self chooses
p186
aVonly holds
p187
aVwhen that self
p188
aVis clearly divided from others.
p189
aVWhen, in contrast,
p190
aVtwo or more individuals
p191
aVsee their choices and their outcomes
p192
aVas intimately connected,
p193
aVthen they may amplify one another's success
p194
aVby turning choosing
p195
aVinto a collective act.
p196
aVTo insist that they choose independently
p197
aVmight actually compromise
p198
aVboth their performance
p199
aVand their relationships.
p200
aVYet that is exactly what
p201
aVthe American paradigm demands.
p202
aVIt leaves little room for interdependence
p203
aVor an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.
p204
aVIt requires that everyone treat choice
p205
aVas a private and self-defining act.
p206
aVPeople that have grown up in such a paradigm
p207
aVmight find it motivating,
p208
aVbut it is a mistake to assume
p209
aVthat everyone thrives under the pressure
p210
aVof choosing alone.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe second assumption which informs the American view of choice
p213
aVgoes something like this.
p214
aVThe more choices you have,
p215
aVthe more likely you are
p216
aVto make the best choice.
p217
aVSo bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,
p218
aVand Amazon, with 27 million books
p219
aVand Match.com with \u2014 what is it? \u2014
p220
aV15 million date possibilities now.
p221
aVYou will surely find the perfect match.
p222
aVLet's test this assumption
p223
aVby heading over to Eastern Europe.
p224
aVHere, I interviewed people
p225
aVwho were residents of formerly communist countries,
p226
aVwho had all faced the challenge
p227
aVof transitioning to a more
p228
aVdemocratic and capitalistic society.
p229
aVOne of the most interesting revelations
p230
aVcame not from an answer to a question,
p231
aVbut from a simple gesture of hospitality.
p232
aVWhen the participants arrived for their interview,
p233
aVI offered them a set of drinks:
p234
aVCoke, Diet Coke, Sprite \u2014
p235
aVseven, to be exact.
p236
aa(lp237
VDuring the very first session,
p238
aVwhich was run in Russia,
p239
aVone of the participants made a comment
p240
aVthat really caught me off guard.
p241
aV"Oh, but it doesn't matter.
p242
aVIt's all just soda. That's just one choice."
p243
aV(Murmuring)
p244
aVI was so struck by this comment that from then on,
p245
aVI started to offer all the participants
p246
aVthose seven sodas,
p247
aVand I asked them, "How many choices are these?"
p248
aVAgain and again,
p249
aVthey perceived these seven different sodas,
p250
aVnot as seven choices, but as one choice:
p251
aVsoda or no soda.
p252
aVWhen I put out juice and water
p253
aVin addition to these seven sodas,
p254
aVnow they perceived it as only three choices \u2014
p255
aVjuice, water and soda.
p256
aVCompare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,
p257
aVnot just to a particular flavor of soda,
p258
aVbut to a particular brand.
p259
aVYou know, research shows repeatedly
p260
aVthat we can't actually tell the difference
p261
aVbetween Coke and Pepsi.
p262
aVOf course, you and I know
p263
aVthat Coke is the better choice.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VFor modern Americans who are exposed
p268
aVto more options and more ads associated with options
p269
aVthan anyone else in the world,
p270
aVchoice is just as much about who they are
p271
aVas it is about what the product is.
p272
aVCombine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,
p273
aVand you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters
p274
aVand so every choice matters.
p275
aVBut for Eastern Europeans,
p276
aVthe sudden availability of all these
p277
aVconsumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.
p278
aVThey were flooded with choice
p279
aVbefore they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.
p280
aVWhen asked, "What words and images
p281
aVdo you associate with choice?"
p282
aVGrzegorz from Warsaw said,
p283
aV"Ah, for me it is fear.
p284
aVThere are some dilemmas you see.
p285
aVI am used to no choice."
p286
aVBohdan from Kiev said,
p287
aVin response to how he felt about
p288
aVthe new consumer marketplace,
p289
aV"It is too much.
p290
aVWe do not need everything that is there."
p291
aVA sociologist from
p292
aVthe Warsaw Survey Agency explained,
p293
aV"The older generation jumped from nothing
p294
aVto choice all around them.
p295
aVThey were never given a chance to learn
p296
aVhow to react."
p297
aVAnd Tomasz, a young Polish man said,
p298
aV"I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.
p299
aVI don't mean to say that I want no choice,
p300
aVbut many of these choices are quite artificial."
p301
aa(lp302
VIn reality, many choices are between things
p303
aVthat are not that much different.
p304
aVThe value of choice
p305
aVdepends on our ability
p306
aVto perceive differences
p307
aVbetween the options.
p308
aVAmericans train their whole lives
p309
aVto play "spot the difference."
p310
aVThey practice this from such an early age
p311
aVthat they've come to believe that everyone
p312
aVmust be born with this ability.
p313
aVIn fact, though all humans share
p314
aVa basic need and desire for choice,
p315
aVwe don't all see choice in the same places
p316
aVor to the same extent.
p317
aVWhen someone can't see how one choice
p318
aVis unlike another,
p319
aVor when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,
p320
aVthe process of choosing can be
p321
aVconfusing and frustrating.
p322
aVInstead of making better choices,
p323
aVwe become overwhelmed by choice,
p324
aVsometimes even afraid of it.
p325
aVChoice no longer offers opportunities,
p326
aVbut imposes constraints.
p327
aVIt's not a marker of liberation,
p328
aVbut of suffocation
p329
aVby meaningless minutiae.
p330
aVIn other words,
p331
aVchoice can develop into the very opposite
p332
aVof everything it represents
p333
aVin America
p334
aVwhen it is thrust upon those
p335
aVwho are insufficiently prepared for it.
p336
aVBut it is not only other people
p337
aVin other places
p338
aVthat are feeling the pressure
p339
aVof ever-increasing choice.
p340
aVAmericans themselves are discovering
p341
aVthat unlimited choice
p342
aVseems more attractive in theory
p343
aVthan in practice.
p344
aa(lp345
VWe all have physical, mental
p346
aVand emotional (Laughter) limitations
p347
aVthat make it impossible for us
p348
aVto process every single choice we encounter,
p349
aVeven in the grocery store,
p350
aVlet alone over the course of our entire lives.
p351
aVA number of my studies have shown
p352
aVthat when you give people 10 or more options
p353
aVwhen they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,
p354
aVwhether it be health care, investment,
p355
aVother critical areas.
p356
aVYet still, many of us believe
p357
aVthat we should make all our own choices
p358
aVand seek out even more of them.
p359
aa(lp360
VThis brings me to the third,
p361
aVand perhaps most problematic, assumption:
p362
aV"You must never
p363
aVsay no to choice."
p364
aVTo examine this, let's go back to the U.S.
p365
aVand then hop across the pond to France.
p366
aVRight outside Chicago,
p367
aVa young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,
p368
aVwere about to have their first baby.
p369
aVThey'd already picked out a name for her,
p370
aVBarbara, after her grandmother.
p371
aVOne night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,
p372
aVshe started to experience contractions
p373
aVand was rushed to the emergency room.
p374
aVThe baby was delivered through a C-section,
p375
aVbut Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,
p376
aVa loss of oxygen to the brain.
p377
aVUnable to breathe on her own,
p378
aVshe was put on a ventilator.
p379
aVTwo days later,
p380
aVthe doctors gave the Mitchells
p381
aVa choice:
p382
aVThey could either remove Barbara
p383
aVoff the life support,
p384
aVin which case she would die within a matter of hours,
p385
aVor they could keep her on life support,
p386
aVin which case she might still die
p387
aVwithin a matter of days.
p388
aVIf she survived, she would remain
p389
aVin a permanent vegetative state,
p390
aVnever able to walk, talk
p391
aVor interact with others.
p392
aVWhat do they do?
p393
aVWhat do any parent do?
p394
aa(lp395
VIn a study I conducted
p396
aVwith Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,
p397
aVAmerican and French parents
p398
aVwere interviewed.
p399
aVThey had all suffered
p400
aVthe same tragedy.
p401
aVIn all cases, the life support was removed,
p402
aVand the infants had died.
p403
aVBut there was a big difference.
p404
aVIn France, the doctors decided whether and when
p405
aVthe life support would be removed,
p406
aVwhile in the United States,
p407
aVthe final decision rested with the parents.
p408
aVWe wondered:
p409
aVdoes this have an effect on how the parents
p410
aVcope with the loss of their loved one?
p411
aVWe found that it did.
p412
aVEven up to a year later,
p413
aVAmerican parents
p414
aVwere more likely to express negative emotions,
p415
aVas compared to their French counterparts.
p416
aVFrench parents were more likely to say things like,
p417
aV"Noah was here for so little time,
p418
aVbut he taught us so much.
p419
aVHe gave us a new perspective on life."
p420
aa(lp421
VAmerican parents were more likely to say things like,
p422
aV"What if? What if?"
p423
aVAnother parent complained,
p424
aV"I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.
p425
aVHow did they get me to do that?"
p426
aVAnd another parent said,
p427
aV"I feel as if I've played a role
p428
aVin an execution."
p429
aVBut when the American parents were asked
p430
aVif they would rather have had
p431
aVthe doctors make the decision,
p432
aVthey all said, "No."
p433
aVThey could not imagine
p434
aVturning that choice over to another,
p435
aVeven though having made that choice
p436
aVmade them feel trapped,
p437
aVguilty, angry.
p438
aVIn a number of cases
p439
aVthey were even clinically depressed.
p440
aVThese parents could not contemplate
p441
aVgiving up the choice,
p442
aVbecause to do so would have gone contrary
p443
aVto everything they had been taught
p444
aVand everything they had come to believe
p445
aVabout the power
p446
aVand purpose of choice.
p447
aa(lp448
VIn her essay, "The White Album,"
p449
aVJoan Didion writes,
p450
aV"We tell ourselves stories
p451
aVin order to live.
p452
aVWe interpret what we see,
p453
aVselect the most workable
p454
aVof the multiple choices.
p455
aVWe live entirely by the imposition
p456
aVof a narrative line
p457
aVupon disparate images,
p458
aVby the idea with which we have learned to freeze
p459
aVthe shifting phantasmagoria,
p460
aVwhich is our actual experience."
p461
aVThe story Americans tell,
p462
aVthe story upon which
p463
aVthe American dream depends,
p464
aVis the story of limitless choice.
p465
aVThis narrative
p466
aVpromises so much:
p467
aVfreedom, happiness,
p468
aVsuccess.
p469
aVIt lays the world at your feet and says,
p470
aV"You can have anything, everything."
p471
aVIt's a great story,
p472
aVand it's understandable why they would be reluctant
p473
aVto revise it.
p474
aVBut when you take a close look,
p475
aVyou start to see the holes,
p476
aVand you start to see that the story
p477
aVcan be told in many other ways.
p478
aa(lp479
VAmericans have so often tried to
p480
aVdisseminate their ideas of choice,
p481
aVbelieving that they will be, or ought to be,
p482
aVwelcomed with open hearts and minds.
p483
aVBut the history books and the daily news tell us
p484
aVit doesn't always work out that way.
p485
aVThe phantasmagoria,
p486
aVthe actual experience that we try to understand
p487
aVand organize through narrative,
p488
aVvaries from place to place.
p489
aVNo single narrative serves the needs
p490
aVof everyone everywhere.
p491
aVMoreover, Americans themselves
p492
aVcould benefit from incorporating
p493
aVnew perspectives into their own narrative,
p494
aVwhich has been driving their choices
p495
aVfor so long.
p496
aa(lp497
VRobert Frost once said that,
p498
aV"It is poetry that is lost in translation."
p499
aVThis suggests that
p500
aVwhatever is beautiful and moving,
p501
aVwhatever gives us a new way to see,
p502
aVcannot be communicated to those
p503
aVwho speak a different language.
p504
aVBut Joseph Brodsky said that,
p505
aV"It is poetry
p506
aVthat is gained in translation,"
p507
aVsuggesting that translation
p508
aVcan be a creative,
p509
aVtransformative act.
p510
aVWhen it comes to choice,
p511
aVwe have far more to gain than to lose
p512
aVby engaging in the many
p513
aVtranslations of the narratives.
p514
aVInstead of replacing
p515
aVone story with another,
p516
aVwe can learn from and revel in
p517
aVthe many versions that exist
p518
aVand the many that have yet to be written.
p519
aVNo matter where we're from
p520
aVand what your narrative is,
p521
aVwe all have a responsibility
p522
aVto open ourselves up to a wider array
p523
aVof what choice can do,
p524
aVand what it can represent.
p525
aVAnd this does not lead to
p526
aVa paralyzing moral relativism.
p527
aVRather, it teaches us when
p528
aVand how to act.
p529
aVIt brings us that much closer
p530
aVto realizing the full potential of choice,
p531
aVto inspiring the hope
p532
aVand achieving the freedom
p533
aVthat choice promises
p534
aVbut doesn't always deliver.
p535
aVIf we learn to speak to one another,
p536
aValbeit through translation,
p537
aVthen we can begin to see choice
p538
aVin all its strangeness,
p539
aVcomplexity
p540
aVand compelling beauty.
p541
aa(lp542
VThank you.
p543

p545
aa(lp546
VBruno Giussani: Thank you.
p547
aVSheena, there is a detail about your biography
p548
aVthat we have not written in the program book.
p549
aVBut by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.
p550
aVAnd I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:
p551
aVHow does that influence your study of choosing
p552
aVbecause that's an activity
p553
aVthat for most people is associated with visual inputs
p554
aVlike aesthetics and color and so on?
p555
aa(lp556
VSheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that
p557
aVbecause one of the things that's interesting about being blind
p558
aVis you actually get a different vantage point
p559
aVwhen you observe the way
p560
aVsighted people make choices.
p561
aVAnd as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there
p562
aVthat are very visual these days.
p563
aVYeah, I \u2014 as you would expect \u2014
p564
aVget pretty frustrated by choices
p565
aVlike what nail polish to put on
p566
aVbecause I have to rely on what other people suggest.
p567
aVAnd I can't decide.
p568
aVAnd so one time I was in a beauty salon,
p569
aVand I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.
p570
aVAnd one was called "Ballet Slippers."
p571
aVAnd the other one was called "Adorable."
p572
aV(Laughter)
p573
aVAnd so I asked these two ladies,
p574
aVand the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'"
p575
aV"Well, what does it look like?"
p576
aV"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."
p577
aV"Okay, great."
p578
aVThe other lady tells me to wear "Adorable."
p579
aV"What does it look like?"
p580
aV"It's a glamorous shade of pink."
p581
aVAnd so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?
p582
aVWhat's different about them?"
p583
aVAnd they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."
p584
aVOkay, we got that.
p585
aVAnd the only thing they had consensus on:
p586
aVwell, if I could see them, I would
p587
aVclearly be able to tell them apart.
p588
aa(lp589
V(Laughter)
p590
aa(lp591
VAnd what I wondered was whether they were being affected
p592
aVby the name or the content of the color,
p593
aVso I decided to do a little experiment.
p594
aVSo I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,
p595
aVand I stripped the labels off.
p596
aVAnd I brought women into the laboratory,
p597
aVand I asked them, "Which one would you pick?"
p598
aV50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick,
p599
aVof putting the same color nail polish
p600
aVin both those bottles.
p601
aV(Laughter)
p602
aV(Applause)
p603
aVAt which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.
p604
aVNow, of the women that could tell them apart,
p605
aVwhen the labels were off, they picked "Adorable,"
p606
aVand when the labels were on,
p607
aVthey picked "Ballet Slippers."
p608
aVSo as far as I can tell,
p609
aVa rose by any other name
p610
aVprobably does look different
p611
aVand maybe even smells different.
p612
aa(lp613

Sheena Iyengar looks deeply at choosing and has discovered many surprising things about it. For instance, her famous &quot;jam study,&quot; done while she was a grad student, quantified a counterintuitive truth about decisionmaking -- that when we&#39;re presented with too many choices, like 24 varieties of jam, we tend not to choose anything at all. (This and subsequent, equally ingenious experiments have provided rich material for Malcolm Gladwell and other pop chroniclers of business and the human psyche.) </p><p>Iyengar&#39;s research has been informing business and consumer-goods marketing since the 1990s. But she and her team at the Columbia Business School throw a much broader net. Her analysis touches, for example, on the medical decisionmaking that might lead up to choosing physician-assisted suicide, on the drawbacks of providing too many choices and options in social-welfare programs, and on the cultural and geographical underpinning of choice. Her book<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/artofchoosing\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Art of Choosing</em></a>&nbsp;shares her research in an accessible and charming story that draws examples from her own life.</p><p>Watch a Facebook-exclusive short video from Sheena Iyengar: <a href=\\"http://www.facebook.com/TED?sk=wall&amp;filter=2#!/video/video.php?v=1477208766835\\" target=\\"_blank\\">&quot;Ballet Slippers&quot; &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>", "slug": "sheena_iyengar", "whotheyare": "Sheena Iyengar studies how people choose (and what makes us think we\'re good at it).", "whatotherssay": "The Art of Choosing explores the cultural, social, and biological forces on the complex process of decision-making but is also deeply personal.", "id": 731, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/186796_254x191.jpg"}], "current_talk": 924, "description": "Sheena Iyengar studies how we make choices -- and how we feel about the choices we make.

good at making choices; many of us even enjoy making them. Sheena Iyengar looks deeply at choosing and has discovered many surprising things about it. For instance, her famous &quot;jam study,&quot; done while she was a grad student, quantified a counterintuitive truth about decisionmaking -- that when we&#39;re presented with too many choices, like 24 varieties of jam, we tend not to choose anything at all. (This and subsequent, equally ingenious experiments have provided rich material for Malcolm Gladwell and other pop chroniclers of business and the human psyche.) </p><p>Iyengar&#39;s research has been informing business and consumer-goods marketing since the 1990s. But she and her team at the Columbia Business School throw a much broader net. Her analysis touches, for example, on the medical decisionmaking that might lead up to choosing physician-assisted suicide, on the drawbacks of providing too many choices and options in social-welfare programs, and on the cultural and geographical underpinning of choice. Her book<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/artofchoosing\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Art of Choosing</em></a>&nbsp;shares her research in an accessible and charming story that draws examples from her own life.</p><p>Watch a Facebook-exclusive short video from Sheena Iyengar: <a href=\\"http://www.facebook.com/TED?sk=wall&amp;filter=2#!/video/video.php?v=1477208766835\\" target=\\"_blank\\">&quot;Ballet Slippers&quot; &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>", "slug": "sheena_iyengar", "whotheyare": "Sheena Iyengar studies how people choose (and what makes us think we\'re good at it).", "whatotherssay": "The Art of Choosing explores the cultural, social, and biological forces on the complex process of decision-making but is also deeply personal.", "id": 731, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/186796_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "The art of choosing", "take_action": null, "comments": 756, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/fd1ebbd085889f33892ea98787e53d6ce789bbc3_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Sheena Iyengar studies how we make choices -- and how we feel about the choices we make.

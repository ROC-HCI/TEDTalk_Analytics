VWhat I'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so
p5
aVis tell you about an idea
p6
aVof how we're going to make matter come alive.
p7
aVNow this may seem a bit ambitious,
p8
aVbut when you look at yourself, you look at your hands,
p9
aVyou realize that you're alive.
p10
aVSo this is a start.
p11
aVNow this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth.
p12
aVThere's been four billion years
p13
aVof organic, biological life.
p14
aVAnd as an inorganic chemist,
p15
aVmy friends and colleagues make this distinction
p16
aVbetween the organic, living world
p17
aVand the inorganic, dead world.
p18
aVAnd what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas
p19
aVabout how we can transform inorganic, dead matter
p20
aVinto living matter, into inorganic biology.
p21
aa(lp22
VBefore we do that,
p23
aVI want to kind of put biology in its place.
p24
aVAnd I'm absolutely enthralled by biology.
p25
aVI love to do synthetic biology.
p26
aVI love things that are alive.
p27
aVI love manipulating the infrastructure of biology.
p28
aVBut within that infrastructure,
p29
aVwe have to remember
p30
aVthat the driving force of biology
p31
aVis really coming from evolution.
p32
aVAnd evolution,
p33
aValthough it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin
p34
aVand a vast number of other people,
p35
aVevolution still is a little bit intangible.
p36
aVAnd when I talk about Darwinian evolution,
p37
aVI mean one thing and one thing only,
p38
aVand that is survival of the fittest.
p39
aVAnd so forget about evolution
p40
aVin a kind of metaphysical way.
p41
aVThink about evolution
p42
aVin terms of offspring competing,
p43
aVand some winning.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo bearing that in mind,
p46
aVas a chemist, I wanted to ask myself
p47
aVthe question frustrated by biology:
p48
aVWhat is the minimal unit of matter
p49
aVthat can undergo Darwinian evolution?
p50
aVAnd this seems quite a profound question.
p51
aVAnd as a chemist,
p52
aVwe're not used to profound questions every day.
p53
aVSo when I thought about it,
p54
aVthen suddenly I realized
p55
aVthat biology gave us the answer.
p56
aVAnd in fact, the smallest unit of matter
p57
aVthat can evolve independently
p58
aVis, in fact, a single cell \u2014
p59
aVa bacteria.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo this raises three really important questions:
p62
aVWhat is life?
p63
aVIs biology special?
p64
aVBiologists seem to think so.
p65
aVIs matter evolvable?
p66
aVNow if we answer those questions in reverse order,
p67
aVthe third question \u2014 is matter evolvable? \u2014
p68
aVif we can answer that,
p69
aVthen we're going to know how special biology is,
p70
aVand maybe, just maybe,
p71
aVwe'll have some idea of what life really is.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo here's some inorganic life.
p74
aVThis is a dead crystal,
p75
aVand I'm going to do something to it,
p76
aVand it's going to become alive.
p77
aVAnd you can see,
p78
aVit's kind of pollinating, germinating, growing.
p79
aVThis is an inorganic tube.
p80
aVAnd all these crystals here under the microscope
p81
aVwere dead a few minutes ago, and they look alive.
p82
aVOf course, they're not alive.
p83
aVIt's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden.
p84
aVBut when I saw this, I was really fascinated,
p85
aVbecause it seemed lifelike.
p86
aVAnd as I pause for a few seconds, have a look at the screen.
p87
aVYou can see there's architecture growing, filling the void.
p88
aVAnd this is dead.
p89
aVSo I was positive that,
p90
aVif somehow we can make things mimic life,
p91
aVlet's go one step further.
p92
aVLet's see if we can actually make life.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut there's a problem,
p95
aVbecause up until maybe a decade ago,
p96
aVwe were told that life was impossible
p97
aVand that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe.
p98
aVIn fact, we were the only people
p99
aVin the universe.
p100
aVNow, that's a bit boring.
p101
aVSo as a chemist,
p102
aVI wanted to say, "Hang on. What is going on here?
p103
aVIs life that improbable?"
p104
aVAnd this is really the question.
p105
aVI think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells
p106
aVwas as probable as the emergence of the stars.
p107
aVAnd in fact, let's take that one step further.
p108
aVLet's say
p109
aVthat if the physics of fusion
p110
aVis encoded into the universe,
p111
aVmaybe the physics of life is as well.
p112
aVAnd so the problem with chemists \u2014
p113
aVand this is a massive advantage as well \u2014
p114
aVis we like to focus on our elements.
p115
aVIn biology, carbon takes center stage.
p116
aVAnd in a universe where carbon exists
p117
aVand organic biology,
p118
aVthen we have all this wonderful diversity of life.
p119
aVIn fact, we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate.
p120
aVWe're awfully careful in the lab
p121
aVto try and avoid various biohazards.
p122
aa(lp123
VWell what about matter?
p124
aVIf we can make matter alive, would we have a matterhazard?
p125
aVSo think, this is a serious question.
p126
aVIf your pen could replicate,
p127
aVthat would be a bit of a problem.
p128
aVSo we have to think differently
p129
aVif we're going to make stuff come alive.
p130
aVAnd we also have to be aware of the issues.
p131
aVBut before we can make life,
p132
aVlet's think for a second
p133
aVwhat life really is characterized by.
p134
aVAnd forgive the complicated diagram.
p135
aVThis is just a collection of pathways in the cell.
p136
aVAnd the cell is obviously for us
p137
aVa fascinating thing.
p138
aVSynthetic biologists are manipulating it.
p139
aVChemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease.
p140
aVAnd you have all these pathways going on at the same time.
p141
aVYou have regulation;
p142
aVinformation is transcribed;
p143
aVcatalysts are made; stuff is happening.
p144
aVBut what does a cell do?
p145
aVWell it divides, it competes,
p146
aVit survives.
p147
aVAnd I think that is where we have to start
p148
aVin terms of thinking about
p149
aVbuilding from our ideas in life.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut what else is life characterized by?
p152
aVWell, I like think of it
p153
aVas a flame in a bottle.
p154
aVAnd so what we have here
p155
aVis a description of single cells
p156
aVreplicating, metabolizing,
p157
aVburning through chemistries.
p158
aVAnd so we have to understand
p159
aVthat if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life,
p160
aVwe need to power it somehow.
p161
aVSo before we can really start to make life,
p162
aVwe have to really think about where it came from.
p163
aVAnd Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague
p164
aVthat he thought that life probably emerged
p165
aVin some warm little pond somewhere \u2014
p166
aVmaybe not in Scotland, maybe in Africa,
p167
aVmaybe somewhere else.
p168
aVBut the real honest answer is, we just don't know,
p169
aVbecause there is a problem with the origin.
p170
aVImagine way back, four and a half billion years ago,
p171
aVthere is a vast chemical soup of stuff.
p172
aVAnd from this stuff we came.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo when you think about the improbable nature
p175
aVof what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes,
p176
aVjust remember,
p177
aVwe came from stuff on planet Earth.
p178
aVAnd we went through a variety of worlds.
p179
aVThe RNA people would talk about the RNA world.
p180
aVWe somehow got to proteins and DNA.
p181
aVWe then got to the last ancestor.
p182
aVEvolution kicked in \u2014 and that's the cool bit.
p183
aVAnd here we are.
p184
aVBut there's a roadblock that you can't get past.
p185
aVYou can decode the genome, you can look back,
p186
aVyou can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA,
p187
aVbut we can't get further than the last ancestor,
p188
aVthe last visible cell
p189
aVthat we could sequence or think back in history.
p190
aVSo we don't know how we got here.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo there are two options:
p193
aVintelligent design, direct and indirect \u2014
p194
aVso God,
p195
aVor my friend.
p196
aVNow talking about E.T. putting us there, or some other life,
p197
aVjust pushes the problem further on.
p198
aVI'm not a politician, I'm a scientist.
p199
aVThe other thing we need to think about
p200
aVis the emergence of chemical complexity.
p201
aVThis seems most likely.
p202
aVSo we have some kind of primordial soup.
p203
aVAnd this one happens to be
p204
aVa good source of all 20 amino acids.
p205
aVAnd somehow
p206
aVthese amino acids are combined,
p207
aVand life begins.
p208
aVBut life begins, what does that mean?
p209
aVWhat is life? What is this stuff of life?
p210
aa(lp211
VSo in the 1950s,
p212
aVMiller-Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment,
p213
aVwhere they did the equivalent in the chemical world.
p214
aVThey took the basic ingredients, put them in a single jar
p215
aVand ignited them
p216
aVand put a lot of voltage through.
p217
aVAnd they had a look at what was in the soup,
p218
aVand they found amino acids,
p219
aVbut nothing came out, there was no cell.
p220
aVSo the whole area's been stuck for a while,
p221
aVand it got reignited in the '80s
p222
aVwhen analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on.
p223
aa(lp224
VIn my own laboratory,
p225
aVthe way we're trying to create inorganic life
p226
aVis by using many different reaction formats.
p227
aVSo what we're trying to do is do reactions \u2014
p228
aVnot in one flask, but in tens of flasks,
p229
aVand connect them together,
p230
aVas you can see with this flow system, all these pipes.
p231
aVWe can do it microfluidically, we can do it lithographically,
p232
aVwe can do it in a 3D printer,
p233
aVwe can do it in droplets for colleagues.
p234
aVAnd the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry
p235
aVjust bubbling away.
p236
aVBut that's probably going to end in failure,
p237
aVso we need to be a bit more focused.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd the answer, of course, lies with mice.
p240
aVThis is how I remember what I need as a chemist.
p241
aVI say, "Well I want molecules."
p242
aVBut I need a metabolism, I need some energy.
p243
aVI need some information, and I need a container.
p244
aVBecause if I want evolution,
p245
aVI need containers to compete.
p246
aVSo if you have a container,
p247
aVit's like getting in your car.
p248
aV"This is my car,
p249
aVand I'm going to drive around and show off my car."
p250
aVAnd I imagine you have a similar thing
p251
aVin cellular biology
p252
aVwith the emergence of life.
p253
aVSo these things together give us evolution, perhaps.
p254
aVAnd the way to test it in the laboratory
p255
aVis to make it minimal.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo what we're going to try and do
p258
aVis come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules.
p259
aVAnd so forgive the molecules on the screen,
p260
aVbut these are a very simple kit.
p261
aVThere's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present.
p262
aVAnd we can aggregate them together
p263
aVand make literally thousands and thousands
p264
aVof really big nano-molecular molecules
p265
aVthe same size of DNA and proteins,
p266
aVbut there's no carbon in sight.
p267
aVCarbon is banned.
p268
aVAnd so with this Lego kit,
p269
aVwe have the diversity required
p270
aVfor complex information storage
p271
aVwithout DNA.
p272
aVBut we need to make some containers.
p273
aVAnd just a few months ago in my lab,
p274
aVwe were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them.
p275
aVAnd you can see on the screen a cell being made.
p276
aVAnd we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell.
p277
aVAnd all I wanted to show you
p278
aVis we can set up molecules
p279
aVin membranes, in real cells,
p280
aVand then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism,
p281
aVa molecular survival of the fittest.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd this movie here
p284
aVshows this competition between molecules.
p285
aVMolecules are competing for stuff.
p286
aVThey're all made of the same stuff,
p287
aVbut they want their shape to win.
p288
aVThey want their shape to persist.
p289
aVAnd that is the key.
p290
aVIf we can somehow encourage these molecules
p291
aVto talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete,
p292
aVthey will start to form cells
p293
aVthat will replicate and compete.
p294
aVIf we manage to do that,
p295
aVforget the molecular detail.
p296
aa(lp297
VLet's zoom out to what that could mean.
p298
aVSo we have this special theory of evolution
p299
aVthat applies only to organic biology, to us.
p300
aVIf we could get evolution into the material world,
p301
aVthen I propose we should have a general theory of evolution.
p302
aVAnd that's really worth thinking about.
p303
aVDoes evolution control
p304
aVthe sophistication of matter in the universe?
p305
aVIs there some driving force through evolution
p306
aVthat allows matter to compete?
p307
aVSo that means we could then start
p308
aVto develop different platforms
p309
aVfor exploring this evolution.
p310
aVSo you imagine,
p311
aVif we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form,
p312
aVnot only will this tell us about the origin of life \u2014
p313
aVthat it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive;
p314
aVit can use anything \u2014
p315
aVwe can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies,
p316
aVbecause we can then use software control
p317
aVfor evolution to code in.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo imagine we make a little cell.
p320
aVWe want to put it out in the environment,
p321
aVand we want it to be powered by the Sun.
p322
aVWhat we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.
p323
aVAnd we don't use design anymore. We find what works.
p324
aVWe should take our inspiration from biology.
p325
aVBiology doesn't care about the design
p326
aVunless it works.
p327
aVSo this will reorganize
p328
aVthe way we design things.
p329
aVBut not only just that,
p330
aVwe will start to think about
p331
aVhow we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology.
p332
aVWouldn't it be great
p333
aVif you could take these artificial biological cells
p334
aVand fuse them with biological ones
p335
aVto correct problems that we couldn't really deal with?
p336
aVThe real issue in cellular biology
p337
aVis we are never going to understand everything,
p338
aVbecause it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution.
p339
aVEvolution cannot be cut apart.
p340
aVYou need to somehow find the fitness function.
p341
aVAnd the profound realization for me
p342
aVis that, if this works,
p343
aVthe concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level,
p344
aVand we really start talking about selfish matter.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd what does that mean in a universe
p347
aVwhere we are right now the highest form of stuff?
p348
aVYou're sitting on chairs.
p349
aVThey're inanimate, they're not alive.
p350
aVBut you are made of stuff, and you are using stuff,
p351
aVand you enslave stuff.
p352
aVSo using evolution
p353
aVin biology,
p354
aVand in inorganic biology,
p355
aVfor me is quite appealing, quite exciting.
p356
aVAnd we're really becoming very close
p357
aVto understanding the key steps
p358
aVthat makes dead stuff come alive.
p359
aVAnd again, when you're thinking about how improbable this is,
p360
aVremember, five billion years ago,
p361
aVwe were not here, and there was no life.
p362
aVSo what will that tell us
p363
aa(lp364
Vabout the origin of life and the meaning of life?
p365
aVBut perhaps, for me as a chemist,
p366
aVI want to keep away from general terms;
p367
aVI want to think about specifics.
p368
aVSo what does it mean about defining life?
p369
aVWe really struggle to do this.
p370
aVAnd I think, if we can make inorganic biology,
p371
aVand we can make matter become evolvable,
p372
aVthat will in fact define life.
p373
aVI propose to you
p374
aVthat matter that can evolve is alive,
p375
aVand this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter.
p376
aa(lp377
VThank you very much.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)
p380
aa(lp381
VChris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline.
p382
aVYou believe you're going to be successful in this project?
p383
aVWhen?
p384
aa(lp385
VLee Cronin: So many people think
p386
aVthat life took millions of years to kick in.
p387
aVWe're proposing to do it in just a few hours,
p388
aVonce we've set up
p389
aVthe right chemistry.
p390
aa(lp391
VCA: And when do you think that will happen?
p392
aa(lp393
VLC: Hopefully within the next two years.
p394
aa(lp395
VCA: That would be a big story.
p396
aV(Laughter)
p397
aVIn your own mind, what do you believe the chances are
p398
aVthat walking around on some other planet
p399
aVis non-carbon-based life,
p400
aVwalking or oozing or something?
p401
aa(lp402
VLC: I think it's 100 percent.
p403
aVBecause the thing is, we are so chauvinistic to biology,
p404
aVif you take away carbon, there's other things that can happen.
p405
aVSo the other thing
p406
aVthat if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon,
p407
aVmaybe we can tell NASA what really to look for.
p408
aVDon't go and look for carbon, go and look for evolvable stuff.
p409
aa(lp410
VCA: Lee Cronin, good luck. (LC: Thank you very much.)

At TEDGlobal 2012, Cronin shared some of the lab&#39;s latest work: creating a 3D printer for molecules. This device -- which has been prototyped -- can download plans for molecules and print them, in the same way that a 3D printer creates objects. In the future, Cronin says this technology could potentially be used to print medicine -- cheaply and wherever it is needed. As Cronin says: &quot;What Apple did for music, I&#39;d like to do for the discovery and distribution of prescription drugs.&quot;</p> <p>At TEDGlobal 2011, Cronin shared his lab&#39;s bold plan to create life. At the moment, bacteria is the minimum unit of life -- the smallest chemical unit that can undergo evolution. But in Cronin&#39;s emerging field, he&#39;s thinking about forms of life that won&#39;t be biological. To explore this, and to try to understand how life itself originated from chemicals, Cronin and others are attempting to create truly artificial life from completely non-biological chemistries that mimic the behavior of natural cells. They call these chemical cells, or Chells.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cronin&#39;s research interests also encompass self-assembly and self-growing structures -- the better to assemble life at nanoscale. At the University of Glasgow, this work on crystal structures is producing a raft of papers from his research group.

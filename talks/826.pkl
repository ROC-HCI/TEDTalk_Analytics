VIn my industry,
p5
aVwe believe that images can change the world.
p6
aVOkay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
p7
aVThe truth is that we know that the
p8
aVimages themselves don't change the world,
p9
aVbut we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography,
p10
aVimages have provoked reactions in people,
p11
aVand those reactions have caused change to happen.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo let's begin with a group of images.
p14
aVI'd be extremely surprised
p15
aVif you didn't recognize many or most of them.
p16
aVThey're best described as iconic:
p17
aVso iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.
p18
aVIn fact, they're so well-known
p19
aVthat you might even recognize them
p20
aVin a slightly or somewhat different form.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VBut I think we're looking for something more.
p25
aVWe're looking for something more.
p26
aVWe're looking for images that shine
p27
aVan uncompromising light on crucial issues,
p28
aVimages that transcend borders, that transcend religions,
p29
aVimages that provoke us
p30
aVto step up and do something \u2014
p31
aVin other words, to act.
p32
aVWell, this image you've all seen.
p33
aVIt changed our view of the physical world.
p34
aVWe had never seen our planet from this perspective before.
p35
aVMany people credit
p36
aVa lot of the birth of the environmental movement
p37
aVto our seeing the planet like this
p38
aVfor the first time \u2014
p39
aVits smallness, its fragility.
p40
aa(lp41
VForty years later, this group, more than most,
p42
aVare well aware of the destructive power
p43
aVthat our species can wield over our environment.
p44
aVAnd at last, we appear to be doing something about it.
p45
aVThis destructive power takes many different forms.
p46
aVFor example, these images taken by Brent Stirton
p47
aVin the Congo.
p48
aVThese gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified,
p49
aVand unsurprisingly,
p50
aVthey sparked international outrage.
p51
aVMost recently,
p52
aVwe've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself
p53
aVwith the recent earthquake in Haiti.
p54
aa(lp55
VWell, I think what is far worse
p56
aVis man's destructive power over man.
p57
aVSamuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said,
p58
aVand I'll quote him,
p59
aV"The Holocaust teaches us that nature,
p60
aVeven in its cruelest moments,
p61
aVis benign in comparison with man,
p62
aVwhen he loses his moral compass and his reason."
p63
aa(lp64
VThere's another kind of crucifixion.
p65
aVThe horrifying images from Abu Ghraib
p66
aVas well as the images from Guantanamo
p67
aVhad a profound impact.
p68
aVThe publication of those images,
p69
aVas opposed to the images themselves,
p70
aVcaused a government to change its policies.
p71
aVSome would argue that it is those images
p72
aVthat did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq
p73
aVthan virtually any other single act.
p74
aVFurthermore, those images forever removed
p75
aVthe so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces.
p76
aa(lp77
VLet's go back a little.
p78
aVIn the 1960s and 1970s,
p79
aVthe Vietnam War was basically shown
p80
aVin America's living rooms day in, day out.
p81
aVNews photos brought people face to face
p82
aVwith the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm,
p83
aVa student killed by the National Guard
p84
aVat Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.
p85
aVIn fact, these images became
p86
aVthe voices of protest themselves.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, images have power
p89
aVto shed light of understanding
p90
aVon suspicion, ignorance,
p91
aVand in particular \u2014 I've given a lot of talks on this
p92
aVbut I'll just show one image \u2014
p93
aVthe issue of HIV/AIDS.
p94
aVIn the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease
p95
aVwas an enormous barrier
p96
aVto even discussing or addressing it.
p97
aVA simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world,
p98
aVthe Princess of Wales, touching
p99
aVan HIV/AIDS infected baby
p100
aVdid a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.
p101
aVShe, better than most, knew the power of an image.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo when we are confronted by a powerful image,
p104
aVwe all have a choice:
p105
aVWe can look away, or we can address the image.
p106
aVThankfully, when these photos appeared in
p107
aVThe Guardian in 1998,
p108
aVthey put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money
p109
aVtowards the Sudan famine relief efforts.
p110
aVDid the images change the world?
p111
aVNo, but they had a major impact.
p112
aVImages often push us to question our core beliefs
p113
aVand our responsibilities to each other.
p114
aVWe all saw those images after Katrina,
p115
aVand I think for millions of people
p116
aVthey had a very strong impact.
p117
aVAnd I think it's very unlikely
p118
aVthat they were far from the minds of Americans
p119
aVwhen they went to vote in November 2008.
p120
aa(lp121
VUnfortunately, some very important images
p122
aVare deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.
p123
aVI'll show you one photo here,
p124
aVand it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran
p125
aVfrom an extraordinary piece of work,
p126
aVwhich has never been published, called War Is Personal.
p127
aVBut images don't need to be graphic
p128
aVin order to remind us of the tragedy of war.
p129
aVJohn Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.
p130
aVAfter all the tense moments of conflict
p131
aVin all the conflict zones of the world,
p132
aVthere's one photograph from a much quieter place
p133
aVthat haunts me still, much more than the others.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnsel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him,
p136
aV"You don't take a photograph, you make it."
p137
aVIn my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo,
p138
aVit's you.
p139
aVWe bring to each image
p140
aVour own values, our own belief systems,
p141
aVand as a result of that, the image resonates with us.
p142
aVMy company has 70 million images.
p143
aVI have one image in my office.
p144
aVHere it is.
p145
aVI hope that the next time you see
p146
aVan image that sparks something in you,
p147
aVyou'll better understand why,
p148
aVand I know that speaking to this audience,
p149
aVyou'll definitely do something about it.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd thank you to all the photographers.

-- you&#39;ve come across an image sourced from stock photo agency <a href=\\"http://www.gettyimages.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Getty Images</a>. Photos and illustrations from Getty can be found everywhere, for just about every purpose you can imagine. It shouldn&#39;t surprise you that Getty began in the Internet age, leaving print-era agencies in the dust by using Internet and CD-ROM distribution since day one.<br /><br />Jonathan Klein, Getty&#39;s co-founder (along with Mark Getty) and the current CEO, helped drive its success over the past 15 years. He led it during its aggressive archive acquisition campaign through the &#39;90s and now in the 2000s, adding to its formidable collection of editorial photos, footage and music. But his business skill is only part of his story; to hear Klein <a href=\\"http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_klein_photos_that_changed_the_world.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">talk</a>, one is quick to catch <strong>his passionate enthusiasm for the power of images</strong> -- not only to document moments in our lives and in history, not just to sell products or turn over PR campaigns -- but to shift public opinion and, perhaps, make the world more just.<br /><br />Klein serves on the board of the Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS and on the board of Real Networks (media software company and creator of the popular RealPlayer).</p>", "slug": "jonathan_klein", "whotheyare": "Jonathan Klein runs Getty Images, a stock photo agency whose vast archive of still photography and illustrations is a mainstay of the creative class.", "whatotherssay": "Images have provoked reactions in people, and those reactions have caused change to happen.", "id": 693, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/163370_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Photos that changed the world", "take_action": null, "comments": 679, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/163366_800x600.jpg", "description": "Photographs do more than document history -- they make it.

VPat Mitchell: So I was thinking about female friendship a lot,
p5
aVand by the way, these two women,
p6
aVI'm very honored to say,
p7
aVhave been my friends for a very long time, too.
p8
aVJane Fonda: Yes we have.
p9
aa(lp10
VPM: And one of the things that I read about female friendship
p11
aVis something that Cervantes said.
p12
aVHe said, "You can tell a lot about someone,"
p13
aVin this case a woman,
p14
aV"by the company that she keeps."
p15
aVSo let's start with \u2014
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VJF: We're in big trouble.
p20
aa(lp21
VLily Tomlin: Hand me one of those waters,
p22
aVI'm extremely dry.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VJF: You're taking up our time.
p27
aVWe have a very limited \u2014
p28
aa(lp29
VLT: Just being with her sucks the life out of me.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VJF: You ain't seen nothing yet.
p34
aVAnyway \u2014 sorry.
p35
aa(lp36
VPM: So tell me, what do you look for in a friend?
p37
aa(lp38
VLT: I look for someone who has a sense of fun,
p39
aVwho's audacious,
p40
aVwho's forthcoming, who has politics,
p41
aVwho has even a small scrap of passion for the planet,
p42
aVsomeone who's decent, has a sense of justice
p43
aVand who thinks I'm worthwhile.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
V(Applause)
p48
aa(lp49
VJF: You know, I was thinking this morning,
p50
aVI don't even know what I would do without my women friends.
p51
aVI mean it's, "I have my friends, therefore I am."
p52
aa(lp53
VLT: (Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VJF: No, it's true.
p56
aVI exist because I have my women friends. They \u2014
p57
aVYou're one of them.
p58
aVI don't know about you. But anyway \u2014
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VYou know, they make me stronger, they make me smarter,
p63
aVthey make me braver.
p64
aVThey tap me on the shoulder when I might be in need of course-correcting.
p65
aVAnd most of them are a good deal younger than me, too.
p66
aVYou know? I mean, it's nice \u2014 LT: Thank you.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VJF: No, I do, I include you in that, because listen, you know \u2014
p71
aVit's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from
p72
aVwhen you're getting toward the end.
p73
aVI'm approaching \u2014 I'll be there sooner than you.
p74
aa(lp75
VLT: No, I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VJF: I'm showing you the way.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VLT: Well, you are and you have.
p84
aa(lp85
VPM: Well, as we grow older,
p86
aVand as we go through different kinds of life's journeys,
p87
aVwhat do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive?
p88
aa(lp89
VLT: Well you have to use a lot of \u2014
p90
aa(lp91
VJF: She doesn't invite me over much, I'll tell you that.
p92
aa(lp93
VLT: I have to use a lot of social media \u2014
p94
aVYou be quiet now. And so \u2014
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VLT: And I look through my emails, I look through my texts
p99
aVto find my friends,
p100
aVso I can answer them as quickly as possible,
p101
aVbecause I know they need my counsel.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VThey need my support,
p106
aVbecause most of my friends are writers, or activists, or actors,
p107
aVand you're all three ...
p108
aVand a long string of other descriptive phrases,
p109
aVand I want to get to you as soon as possible,
p110
aVI want you to know that I'm there for you.
p111
aa(lp112
VJF: Do you do emojis?
p113
aa(lp114
VLT: Oh ... JF: No?
p115
aa(lp116
VLT: That's embarrassing. JF: I'm really into emojis.
p117
aa(lp118
VLT: No, I spell out my \u2014
p119
aVI spell out my words of happiness and congratulations,
p120
aVand sadness.
p121
aa(lp122
VJF: You spell it right out \u2014
p123
aa(lp124
VLT: I spell it, every letter.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VJF: Such a purist.
p129
aVYou know, as I've gotten older,
p130
aVI've understood more the importance of friendships,
p131
aVand so, I really make an effort
p132
aVto reach out and make play dates \u2014 not let too much time go by.
p133
aVI read a lot
p134
aVso, as Lily knows all too well,
p135
aVmy books that I like, I send to my friends.
p136
aa(lp137
VLT: When we knew we would be here today
p138
aVyou sent me a lot of books about women, female friendships,
p139
aVand I was so surprised to see how many books,
p140
aVhow much research has been done recently \u2014
p141
aa(lp142
VJF: And were you grateful? LT: I was grateful.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VPM: And \u2014
p147
aa(lp148
VLT: Wait, no, it's really important because this is another example
p149
aVof how women are overlooked, put aside, marginalized.
p150
aVThere's been very little research done on us,
p151
aVeven though we volunteered lots of times.
p152
aa(lp153
VJF: That's for sure.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VLT: This is really exciting, and you all will be interested in this.
p158
aVThe Harvard Medical School study has shown
p159
aVthat women who have close female friendships
p160
aVare less likely to develop impairments \u2014
p161
aVphysical impairments as they age,
p162
aVand they are likely to be seen to be living much more vital, exciting \u2014
p163
aa(lp164
VJF: And longer \u2014
p165
aa(lp166
VLT: Joyful lives.
p167
aa(lp168
VJF: We live five years longer than men.
p169
aa(lp170
VLT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VLT: But the most important part is they found \u2014
p175
aVthe results were so exciting and so conclusive \u2014
p176
aVthe researchers found
p177
aVthat not having close female friends is detrimental to your health,
p178
aVas much as smoking or being overweight.
p179
aa(lp180
VJF: And there's something else, too \u2014
p181
aa(lp182
VLT: I've said my part, so ...
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VJF: OK, well, listen to my part, because there's an additional thing.
p187
aVBecause they only \u2014 for years, decades \u2014
p188
aVthey only researched men when they were trying to understand stress,
p189
aVonly very recently have they researched what happens to women when we're stressed,
p190
aVand it turns out that when we're stressed \u2014 women,
p191
aVour bodies get flooded by oxytocin.
p192
aVWhich is a feel-good, calming, stress-reducing hormone.
p193
aVWhich is also increased when we're with our women friends.
p194
aVAnd I do think that's one reason why we live longer.
p195
aVAnd I feel so bad for men because they don't have that.
p196
aVTestosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin.
p197
aa(lp198
VLT: Well, when you and I and Dolly made "9 to 5" ...
p199
aa(lp200
VJF: Oh \u2014
p201
aa(lp202
VLT: We laughed, we did, we laughed so much,
p203
aVwe found we had so much in common and we're so different.
p204
aVHere she is, like Hollywood royalty,
p205
aVI'm like a tough kid from Detroit,
p206
aV[Dolly's] a Southern kid from a poor town in Tennessee,
p207
aVand we found we were so in sync as women,
p208
aVand we must have \u2014
p209
aVwe laughed \u2014 we must have added at least a decade onto our lifespans.
p210
aa(lp211
VJF: I think \u2014 we sure crossed our legs a lot.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aVIf you know what I mean.
p215
aa(lp216
VLT: I think we all know what you mean.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VPM: You're adding decades to our lives right now.
p221
aVSo among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship
p222
aVwas one by a woman we admire greatly, Sister Joan Chittister,
p223
aVwho said about female friendship
p224
aVthat women friends are not just a social act,
p225
aVthey're a spiritual act.
p226
aVDo you think of your friends as spiritual?
p227
aVDo they add something spiritual to your lives?
p228
aa(lp229
VLT: Spiritual \u2014 I absolutely think that.
p230
aVBecause \u2014 especially people you've known a long time,
p231
aVpeople you've spent time with \u2014
p232
aVI can see the spiritual essence inside them,
p233
aVthe tenderness, the vulnerability.
p234
aVThere's actually kind of a love, an element of love in the relationship.
p235
aVI just see deeply into your soul.
p236
aa(lp237
VPM: Do you think that, Jane \u2014
p238
aa(lp239
VLT: But I have special powers.
p240
aa(lp241
VJF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.
p242
aVThere's business friends, and party friends,
p243
aVI've got a lot of those.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VBut the oxytocin-producing friendships have ...
p248
aVThey feel spiritual because it's a heart opening, right?
p249
aVYou know, we go deep. And \u2014
p250
aVI find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends.
p251
aVNot because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them.
p252
aa(lp253
VLT: And you know one of you is going to go soon.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VPM: Well, two of us are sitting here, Lily, which one are you talking about?
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aVAnd I always think, when women talk about their friendships,
p261
aVthat men always look a little mystified.
p262
aVWhat are the differences, in your opinion,
p263
aVbetween men friendships and women friendships?
p264
aa(lp265
VJF: There's a lot of difference,
p266
aVand I think we have to have a lot of empathy for men \u2014
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
Vthat they don't have what we have.
p271
aVWhich I think may be why they die sooner.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VI have a lot of compassion for men,
p276
aVbecause women, no kidding, we \u2014
p277
aVwomen's relationships, our friendships are full disclosure, we go deep.
p278
aVThey're revelatory.
p279
aVWe risk vulnerability \u2014 this is something men don't do.
p280
aVI mean how many times have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?"
p281
aV"Did I really screw up there?"
p282
aa(lp283
VPM: You're doing great.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VJF: But I mean, we ask questions like that
p288
aVof our women friends,
p289
aVand men don't.
p290
aVYou know, people describe women's relationships as face-to-face,
p291
aVwhereas men's friendships are more side-by-side.
p292
aa(lp293
VLT: I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions,
p294
aVthey want to bury deeper feelings.
p295
aVI mean, that's the general, conventional thought.
p296
aVThey would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls,
p297
aVor talk about sports, or hunting, or cars or have sex.
p298
aVI mean, it's just the kind of \u2014 it's a more manly behavior.
p299
aa(lp300
VJF: You meant \u2014 LT: They talk about sex.
p301
aVI meant they might have sex
p302
aVif they could get somebody in their man cave to \u2014
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VJF: You know something, though, that I find very interesting \u2014
p307
aVand again, psychologists didn't know this until relatively recently \u2014
p308
aVis that men are born every bit as relational as women are.
p309
aVIf you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls,
p310
aVyou'll see the baby boys just like the girls,
p311
aVgazing into their mother's eyes,
p312
aVyou know, needing that relational exchange of energy.
p313
aVWhen the mother looks away, they could see the dismay on the child,
p314
aVeven the boy would cry.
p315
aVThey need relationship.
p316
aVSo the question is why, as they grow older, does that change?
p317
aVAnd the answer is patriarchal culture,
p318
aVwhich says to boys and young men
p319
aVthat to be needing of relationship, to be emotional with someone is girly.
p320
aVThat a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need,
p321
aVthey don't go to doctors if they feel bad.
p322
aVThey don't ask for help.
p323
aVThere's a quote that I really like,
p324
aV"Men fear that becoming 'we' will erase his 'I'."
p325
aVYou know, his sense of self.
p326
aVWhereas women's sense of self has always been kind of porous.
p327
aVBut our "we" is our saving grace,
p328
aVit's what makes us strong.
p329
aVIt's not that we're better than men,
p330
aVwe just don't have our masculinity to prove.
p331
aa(lp332
VLT: And, well \u2014
p333
aa(lp334
VJF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote.
p335
aVSo we can express our humanity \u2014 LT: I know who Gloria Steinem is.
p336
aa(lp337
VJF: I know you know who she is, but I think it's a \u2014
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VNo, but it's a great quote, I think.
p342
aVWe're not better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove.
p343
aVAnd that's really important.
p344
aa(lp345
VLT: But men are so inculcated in the culture
p346
aVto be comfortable in the patriarchy.
p347
aVAnd we've got to make something different happen.
p348
aa(lp349
VJF: Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power.
p350
aa(lp351
VLT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject.
p352
aVIt's because our friendships \u2014
p353
aVfemale friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood,
p354
aVand sisterhood can be a very powerful force,
p355
aVto give the world \u2014
p356
aVto make it what it should be \u2014
p357
aVthe things that humans desperately need.
p358
aa(lp359
VPM: It is why we're talking about it,
p360
aVbecause women's friendships are,
p361
aVas you said, Jane,
p362
aVa renewable source of power.
p363
aVSo how do we use that power?
p364
aa(lp365
VJF: Well, women are the fastest growing demographic in the world,
p366
aVespecially older women.
p367
aVAnd if we harness our power, we can change the world.
p368
aVAnd guess what? We need to.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Applause)
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd we need to do it soon.
p373
aVAnd one of the things that we need to do \u2014
p374
aVand we can do it as women \u2014
p375
aVfor one thing, we kind of set the consumer standards.
p376
aVWe need to consume less.
p377
aVWe in the Western world need to consume less
p378
aVand when we buy things, we need to buy things that are made locally,
p379
aVwhen we buy food, we need to buy food that's grown locally.
p380
aVWe are the ones that need to get off the grid.
p381
aVWe need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels.
p382
aVAnd the fossil fuel companies \u2014
p383
aVthe Exxons and the Shell Oils and those bad guys \u2014
p384
aVcause they are \u2014
p385
aVare going to tell us that we can't do it without going back to the Stone Age.
p386
aVYou know, that the alternatives just aren't quite there yet,
p387
aVand that's not true.
p388
aVThere are countries in the world right now
p389
aVthat are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine.
p390
aVAnd they tell us that if we do wean ourselves from fossil fuel
p391
aVthat we're going to be back in the Stone Age,
p392
aVand in fact, if we begin to use renewable energy,
p393
aVand not drill in the Arctic, and not drill \u2014
p394
aa(lp395
VLT: Oh, boy.
p396
aa(lp397
VJF: And not drill in the Alberta tar sands \u2014
p398
aVRight.
p399
aVThat we will be \u2014
p400
aVthere will be more democracy and more jobs and more well-being,
p401
aVand it's women that are going to lead the way.
p402
aa(lp403
VLT: Maybe we have the momentum to start a third-wave feminist movement
p404
aVwith our sisterhood around the world,
p405
aVwith women we don't see, women we may never meet,
p406
aVbut we join together that way,
p407
aVbecause \u2014
p408
aVAristotle said \u2014
p409
aVmost people \u2014
p410
aVpeople would die without male friendships.
p411
aVAnd the operative word here was "male."
p412
aVBecause they thought that friendships should be between equals
p413
aVand women were not considered equal \u2014
p414
aa(lp415
VJF: They didn't think we had souls even, the Greeks.
p416
aa(lp417
VLT: No, exactly. That shows you just how limited Aristotle was.
p418
aa(lp419
V(Laughter)
p420
aa(lp421
VAnd wait, no, here's the best part.
p422
aVIt's like, you know, men do need women now.
p423
aVThe planet needs women.
p424
aVThe US Constitution needs women.
p425
aVWe are not even in the Constitution.
p426
aa(lp427
VJF: You're talking about the Equal Rights Amendment.
p428
aa(lp429
VLT: Right.
p430
aVJustice Ginsberg said something like \u2014
p431
aVevery constitution that's been written since the end of World War II
p432
aVincluded a provision that made women citizens of equal stature,
p433
aVbut ours does not.
p434
aVSo that would be a good place to start.
p435
aVVery, very mild \u2014
p436
aa(lp437
VJF: Right.
p438
aa(lp439
V(Applause)
p440
aa(lp441
VAnd gender equality, it's like a tide,
p442
aVit would lift all boats, not just women.
p443
aa(lp444
VPM: Needing new role models on how to do that.
p445
aVHow to be friends,
p446
aVhow to think about our power in different ways,
p447
aVas consumers,
p448
aVas citizens of the world,
p449
aVand this is what makes Jane and Lily
p450
aVa role model of how women can be friends \u2014
p451
aVfor a very long time,
p452
aVand even if they occasionally disagree.
p453
aa(lp454
VThank you.
p455
aVThank you both.
p456
aa(lp457
V(Applause)
p458
aa(lp459
VJF: Thanks.
p460
aa(lp461
VLT: Thank you.

VJF: Thank you.

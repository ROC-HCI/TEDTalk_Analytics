VOne of the problems of writing, and working, and looking at the Internet
p5
aVis that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change.
p6
aVAnd so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835.
p7
aVIn 1835, James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper
p8
aVin New York City.
p9
aVAnd it cost about 500 dollars to start it,
p10
aVwhich was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today.
p11
aVBy 15 years later, by 1850, doing the same thing
p12
aV\u2014 starting what was experienced as a mass\u2014circulation daily paper
p13
aV\u2014 would come to cost two and a half million dollars.
p14
aV10,000, two and a half million, 15 years.
p15
aVThat's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net.
p16
aVAnd that's what I want to talk about today,
p17
aVand how that relates to the emergence of social production.
p18
aa(lp19
VStarting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement
p20
aVfor making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation
p21
aVbetween producers \u2014 who had to be able to raise financial capital,
p22
aVjust like any other industrial organization \u2014
p23
aVand passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of
p24
aVthings that this industrial model could produce.
p25
aVNow, the term "information society," "information economy,"
p26
aVfor a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after
p27
aVthe industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happening
p28
aVtoday, that's wrong. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy.
p29
aVIt's just been industrial,
p30
aVwhich means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money
p31
aVto pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph,
p32
aVand the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe.
p33
aVAnd that meant they were market based, or they were government owned,
p34
aVdepending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored
p35
aVthe way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, let me tell you a different story. Around June 2002,
p38
aVthe world of supercomputers had a bombshell.
p39
aVThe Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer \u2014
p40
aVthe NEC Earth Simulator \u2014 taking the primary from the U.S.,
p41
aVand about two years later \u2014 this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-point
p42
aVoperations per second that the computer's capable of running \u2014
p43
aVsigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator.
p44
aVAll of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period,
p45
aVthere's another supercomputer running in the world \u2014 SETI@home.
p46
aVFour and a half million users around the world, contributing their
p47
aVleftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working,
p48
aVby running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to create
p49
aVa massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data
p50
aVcoming from radio telescopes.
p51
aa(lp52
VWhat this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way
p53
aVinformation production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become
p54
aVless capital intensive \u2014 that there's less money that's required
p55
aV\u2014 but that the ownership of this capital, the way the capitalization happens,
p56
aVis radically distributed. Each of us, in these advanced economies,
p57
aVhas one of these, or something rather like it \u2014 a computer.
p58
aVThey're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network.
p59
aVAnd computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands of
p60
aVpractically every connected person \u2014 and these are the basic physical
p61
aVcapital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture,
p62
aVin the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhat this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution,
p65
aVthe most important means, the most important components of the core
p66
aVeconomic activities \u2014 remember, we are in an information economy
p67
aV\u2014 of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else,
p68
aVare in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've
p69
aVseen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation
p70
aVcapacity in the hands of the entire population,
p71
aVand we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience
p72
aV\u2014 the other major experience, the other major input \u2014
p73
aVwhich unlike simple labor \u2014 stand here turning this lever all day long \u2014
p74
aVis not something that's the same or fungible among people.
p75
aVAny one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours
p76
aVto someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit
p77
aVwhat you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances.
p78
aVIn that we're unique, and each of us holds this critical input
p79
aVinto production as we hold this machine.
p80
aa(lp81
VWhat's the effect of this? So, the story that most people know
p82
aVis the story of free or open source software.
p83
aVThis is market share of Apache Web server
p84
aV\u2014 one of the critical applications in Web-based communications.
p85
aVIn 1995, two groups of people said,
p86
aV"Wow, this is really important, the Web! We need a much better Web server!"
p87
aVOne was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided,
p88
aVyou know, we really need this, we should write one,
p89
aVand what are we going to do with what \u2014
p90
aVwell, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it.
p91
aVThe other was Microsoft.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, if I told you that 10 years later, the motley crew of people, who didn't control
p94
aVanything that they produced, acquired 20 percent of the market
p95
aVand was the red line, it would be amazing! Right?
p96
aVThink of it in minivans. A group of automobile
p97
aVengineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right?
p98
aVBut, in fact, of course, the story is it's the 70 percent,
p99
aVincluding the major e-commerce site \u2014 70 percent of a critical application
p100
aVon which Web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form, in
p101
aVdirect competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue \u2014
p102
aVin a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net.
p103
aVSoftware has done this in a way that's been very visible, because
p104
aVit's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Mars
p107
aVthat they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four
p108
aVfully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components,
p109
aVput it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface,
p110
aVwill actually spend five minutes here,
p111
aV10 minutes there, clicking. After six months,
p112
aV85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a
p113
aVfaster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote,
p114
aV"practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.,"
p115
aVonce you showed it to a number of people and computed the average.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, if you have a little girl, and she goes and writes to
p118
aV\u2014 well, not so little, medium little \u2014 tries to do research on Barbie.
p119
aVAnd she'll come to Encarta, one of the main online encyclopedias.
p120
aVThis is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it, there's nothing more to the definition,
p121
aVincluding, "manufacturers" \u2014 plural \u2014 "now more commonly produce
p122
aVethnically diverse dolls, like this black Barbie." Which is vastly better
p123
aVthan what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com,
p124
aVwhich is Barbie, Klaus. (Laughter)
p125
aVOn the other hand, if they go to Wikipedia, they'll find a genuine article
p126
aV\u2014 and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia, because Jimmy Wales is here \u2014
p127
aVbut roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica, differently written,
p128
aVincluding the controversies over body image and commercialization,
p129
aVthe claims about the way in which she's a good role model, etc.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnother portion is not only how content is produced, but how relevance is produced.
p132
aVThe claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look \u2014 originally, not anymore
p133
aV\u2014 we hire people to look at websites and tell you \u2014
p134
aVif they're in the index, they're good. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000
p135
aVpassionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project,
p136
aVeach one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about,
p137
aVto say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers,
p138
aVeach one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundred
p139
aVfully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output,
p140
aVit's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social
p141
aVand psychological motivations to do something interesting.
p142
aa(lp143
VThis is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovation
p144
aVof Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing \u2014
p145
aVthe decision about what's relevant \u2014 to the community of the Web as a whole,
p146
aVdoing whatever they want to do: so, page rank.
p147
aVThe critical innovation here is instead of our engineers, or our people saying
p148
aVwhich is the most relevant, we're going to go out and count what you,
p149
aVpeople out there on the Web, for whatever reason \u2014 vanity, pleasure \u2014
p150
aVproduced links, and tied to each other. We're going to count those, and count them up.
p151
aVAnd again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly,
p152
aVAdiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object,
p153
aVwhich you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classic
p154
aVmarket-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo, all of that is in the creation of content, of relevance, basic human expression.
p157
aVBut remember, the computers were also physical. Just physical materials
p158
aV\u2014 our PCs \u2014 we share them together. We also see this in wireless.
p159
aVIt used to be wireless was one person owned the license, they transmitted in an
p160
aVarea, and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property.
p161
aVWhat we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated
p162
aVthat we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices,
p163
aVand overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this
p164
aVto build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle:
p165
aVWhen I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages;
p166
aVand when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours.
p167
aVAnd this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some
p168
aVplaces in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security.
p169
aa(lp170
VIf in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system.
p171
aVIt's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day,
p172
aVseven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world.
p173
aVIt has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got to
p174
aVbe robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files,
p175
aVarmed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years.
p176
aVIt would take millions. But of course, what I'm describing is P2P file sharing.
p177
aVRight? We always think of it as stealing music, but fundamentally,
p178
aVit's a distributed data storage and retrieval system, where people,
p179
aVfor very obvious reasons, are willing to share their bandwidth and their
p180
aVstorage to create something.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo, essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional
p183
aVframework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which
p184
aVyou could divide things. They could be market based, or non-market based;
p185
aVthey could be decentralized, or centralized.
p186
aVThe price system was a market-based and decentralized system.
p187
aVIf things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them,
p188
aVyou had firms, if you wanted to be in the market \u2014 or you had governments
p189
aVor sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market.
p190
aVIt was too expensive to have decentralized social production,
p191
aVto have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself.
p192
aVThat was, in fact, economic.
p193
aa(lp194
VBut what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system
p195
aVof social sharing and exchange.
p196
aVNot that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other, or for each other,
p197
aVas social beings. We do it all the time.
p198
aVIt's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact.
p199
aVWhat characterizes them is decentralized authority.
p200
aVYou don't have to ask permission, as you do in a property-based system.
p201
aVMay I do this? It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share,
p202
aVif they want to, by themselves or with others,
p203
aVbecause property is one mechanism of coordination.
p204
aVBut it's not the only one.
p205
aa(lp206
VInstead, what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use
p207
aVproperty and contract in the market: information flows to decide what are
p208
aVinteresting problems; who's available and good for something;
p209
aVmotivation structures \u2014 remember, money isn't always the best motivator.
p210
aVIf you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends,
p211
aVyou don't increase the probability of being invited back.
p212
aVAnd if dinner isn't entirely obvious, think of sex. (Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VIt also requires certain new organizational approaches.
p215
aVAnd in particular, what we've seen is task organization.
p216
aVYou have to hire people who know what they're doing.
p217
aVYou have to hire them to spend a lot of time.
p218
aVNow, take the same problem,
p219
aVchunk it into little modules, and motivations become trivial.
p220
aVFive minutes, instead of watching TV?
p221
aVFive minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun.
p222
aVJust because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are more
p223
aVinvolved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo, a new social phenomenon is emerging.
p226
aVIt's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition.
p227
aVPeer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry;
p228
aVfree and open source software taking market share from Microsoft;
p229
aVSkype potentially threatening traditional telecoms;
p230
aVWikipedia competing with online encyclopedias.
p231
aVBut it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses.
p232
aVAs you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging,
p233
aVyou have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers.
p234
aVInstead of building well-behaved appliances
p235
aV\u2014 things that you know what they'll do in advance \u2014
p236
aVyou begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values,
p237
aVa new set of things people value.
p238
aVYou build platforms for self-expression and collaboration.
p239
aVLike Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project,
p240
aVyou're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model.
p241
aVAnd you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sense
p242
aVbuild it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. Right?
p243
aa(lp244
VYou have a belief: stuff will flow out of connected human beings.
p245
aVThat'll give me something I can use, and I'm going to contract with someone.
p246
aVI will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary
p247
aV\u2014 that's what Google does, essentially.
p248
aVThat's what IBM does in software services, and they've done reasonably well.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo, social production is a real fact, not a fad.
p251
aVIt is the critical long-term shift caused by the Internet.
p252
aVSocial relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever
p253
aVwere as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts, it's even more efficient
p254
aVbecause of the quality of the information, the ability to find the best person,
p255
aVthe lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast.
p256
aa(lp257
VBut \u2014 and this is the dark lining \u2014 it is threatened by
p258
aV\u2014 in the same way that it threatens \u2014 the incumbent industrial systems.
p259
aVSo next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision,
p260
aVa telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical.
p261
aVIt is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other,
p262
aVand the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced.
p263
aVBecause it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be
p264
aVfor the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes,
p265
aVor for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model,
p266
aVand change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see.
p267
aVThank you.

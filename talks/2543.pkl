VI am British.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
V(Applause)
p9
aa(lp10
VNever before has the phrase "I am British" elicited so much pity.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VI come from an island where many of us like to believe
p15
aVthere's been a lot of continuity over the last thousand years.
p16
aVWe tend to have historically imposed change on others
p17
aVbut done much less of it ourselves.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo it came as an immense shock to me
p20
aVwhen I woke up on the morning of June 24
p21
aVto discover that my country had voted to leave the European Union,
p22
aVmy Prime Minister had resigned,
p23
aVand Scotland was considering a referendum
p24
aVthat could bring to an end the very existence of the United Kingdom.
p25
aVSo that was an immense shock for me,
p26
aVand it was an immense shock for many people,
p27
aVbut it was also something that, over the following several days,
p28
aVcreated a complete political meltdown
p29
aVin my country.
p30
aVThere were calls for a second referendum,
p31
aValmost as if, following a sports match,
p32
aVwe could ask the opposition for a replay.
p33
aVEverybody was blaming everybody else.
p34
aVPeople blamed the Prime Minister
p35
aVfor calling the referendum in the first place.
p36
aVThey blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough.
p37
aVThe young accused the old.
p38
aVThe educated blamed the less well-educated.
p39
aVThat complete meltdown was made even worse
p40
aVby the most tragic element of it:
p41
aVlevels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of Britain
p42
aVat a level that I have never seen before
p43
aVin my lifetime.
p44
aVPeople are now talking about whether my country is becoming a Little England,
p45
aVor, as one of my colleagues put it,
p46
aVwhether we're about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park
p47
aVfloating in the Atlantic Ocean.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VBut my question is really,
p52
aVshould we have the degree of shock that we've experienced since?
p53
aVWas it something that took place overnight?
p54
aVOr are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today?
p55
aVSo I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions.
p56
aVFirst, what does Brexit represent,
p57
aVnot just for my country,
p58
aVbut for all of us around the world?
p59
aVAnd second, what can we do about it?
p60
aVHow should we all respond?
p61
aa(lp62
VSo first, what does Brexit represent?
p63
aVHindsight is a wonderful thing.
p64
aVBrexit teaches us many things about our society
p65
aVand about societies around the world.
p66
aVIt highlights in ways that we seem embarrassingly unaware of
p67
aVhow divided our societies are.
p68
aVThe vote split along lines of age, education, class and geography.
p69
aVYoung people didn't turn out to vote in great numbers,
p70
aVbut those that did wanted to remain.
p71
aVOlder people really wanted to leave the European Union.
p72
aVGeographically, it was London and Scotland that most strongly committed
p73
aVto being part of the European Union,
p74
aVwhile in other parts of the country there was very strong ambivalence.
p75
aVThose divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously.
p76
aVBut more profoundly, the vote teaches us something
p77
aVabout the nature of politics today.
p78
aVContemporary politics is no longer just about right and left.
p79
aVIt's no longer just about tax and spend.
p80
aVIt's about globalization.
p81
aVThe fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization
p82
aVand those that fear globalization.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VIf we look at why those who wanted to leave \u2014
p87
aVwe call them "Leavers," as opposed to "Remainers" \u2014
p88
aVwe see two factors in the opinion polls
p89
aVthat really mattered.
p90
aVThe first was immigration, and the second sovereignty,
p91
aVand these represent a desire for people to take back control of their own lives
p92
aVand the feeling that they are unrepresented by politicians.
p93
aVBut those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation.
p94
aVThey represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders
p95
aVin ways that many of us would reject.
p96
aVWhat I want to suggest is the picture is more complicated than that,
p97
aVthat liberal internationalists,
p98
aVlike myself, and I firmly include myself in that picture,
p99
aVneed to write ourselves back into the picture
p100
aVin order to understand how we've got to where we are today.
p101
aVWhen we look at the voting patterns across the United Kingdom,
p102
aVwe can visibly see the divisions.
p103
aVThe blue areas show Remain
p104
aVand the red areas Leave.
p105
aVWhen I looked at this,
p106
aVwhat personally struck me was the very little time in my life
p107
aVI've actually spent in many of the red areas.
p108
aVI suddenly realized that, looking at the top 50 areas in the UK
p109
aVthat have the strongest Leave vote,
p110
aVI've spent a combined total of four days of my life in those areas.
p111
aVIn some of those places,
p112
aVI didn't even know the names of the voting districts.
p113
aVIt was a real shock to me,
p114
aVand it suggested that people like me
p115
aVwho think of ourselves as inclusive, open and tolerant,
p116
aVperhaps don't know our own countries and societies
p117
aVnearly as well as we like to believe.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Applause)
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way
p122
aVto narrate globalization to those people,
p123
aVto recognize that for those people who have not necessarily been to university,
p124
aVwho haven't necessarily grown up with the Internet,
p125
aVthat don't get opportunities to travel,
p126
aVthey may be unpersuaded by the narrative that we find persuasive
p127
aVin our often liberal bubbles.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VIt means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand.
p132
aVIn the Leave vote, a minority have peddled the politics of fear and hatred,
p133
aVcreating lies and mistrust
p134
aVaround, for instance, the idea that the vote on Europe
p135
aVcould reduce the number of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Europe,
p136
aVwhen the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration
p137
aVfrom outside the European Union.
p138
aVBut for a significant majority of the Leave voters
p139
aVthe concern was disillusionment with the political establishment.
p140
aVThis was a protest vote for many,
p141
aVa sense that nobody represented them,
p142
aVthat they couldn't find a political party that spoke for them,
p143
aVand so they rejected that political establishment.
p144
aa(lp145
VThis replicates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world.
p146
aVWe see it with the rise in popularity of Donald Trump in the United States,
p147
aVwith the growing nationalism of Viktor Orbán in Hungary,
p148
aVwith the increase in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France.
p149
aVThe specter of Brexit is in all of our societies.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo the question I think we need to ask is my second question,
p152
aVwhich is how should we collectively respond?
p153
aVFor all of us who care about creating liberal, open, tolerant societies,
p154
aVwe urgently need a new vision,
p155
aVa vision of a more tolerant, inclusive globalization,
p156
aVone that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind.
p157
aa(lp158
VThat vision of globalization
p159
aVis one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization.
p160
aVThe consensus amongst economists
p161
aVis that free trade, the movement of capital,
p162
aVthe movement of people across borders
p163
aVbenefit everyone on aggregate.
p164
aVThe consensus amongst international relations scholars
p165
aVis that globalization brings interdependence,
p166
aVwhich brings cooperation and peace.
p167
aVBut globalization also has redistributive effects.
p168
aVIt creates winners and losers.
p169
aVTo take the example of migration,
p170
aVwe know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole
p171
aVunder almost all circumstances.
p172
aVBut we also have to be very aware
p173
aVthat there are redistributive consequences,
p174
aVthat importantly, low-skilled immigration
p175
aVcan lead to a reduction in wages for the most impoverished in our societies
p176
aVand also put pressure on house prices.
p177
aVThat doesn't detract from the fact that it's positive,
p178
aVbut it means more people have to share in those benefits
p179
aVand recognize them.
p180
aa(lp181
VIn 2002, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan,
p182
aVgave a speech at Yale University,
p183
aVand that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization.
p184
aVThat was the speech in which he coined that term.
p185
aVAnd he said, and I paraphrase,
p186
aV"The glass house of globalization has to be open to all
p187
aVif it is to remain secure.
p188
aVBigotry and ignorance
p189
aVare the ugly face of exclusionary and antagonistic globalization."
p190
aa(lp191
VThat idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in 2008
p192
aVin a conference on progressive governance
p193
aVinvolving many of the leaders of European countries.
p194
aVBut amid austerity and the financial crisis of 2008,
p195
aVthe concept disappeared almost without a trace.
p196
aVGlobalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda.
p197
aVIt's perceived to be part of an elite agenda
p198
aVrather than something that benefits all.
p199
aVAnd it needs to be reclaimed on a far more inclusive basis
p200
aVthan it is today.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo the question is, how can we achieve that goal?
p203
aVHow can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation
p204
aVwhile on the other hand refusing vehemently
p205
aVto give in to xenophobia and nationalism?
p206
aVThat is the question for all of us.
p207
aVAnd I think, as a social scientist,
p208
aVthat social science offers some places to start.
p209
aVOur transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change,
p210
aVand I want to give you four ideas as a starting point.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe first relates to the idea of civic education.
p213
aVWhat stands out from Brexit
p214
aVis the gap between public perception and empirical reality.
p215
aVIt's been suggested that we've moved to a postfactual society,
p216
aVwhere evidence and truth no longer matter,
p217
aVand lies have equal status to the clarity of evidence.
p218
aVSo how can we \u2014
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VHow can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies?
p223
aVIt has to begin with education,
p224
aVbut it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps.
p225
aa(lp226
VIn 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI
p227
aVpublished a survey on attitudes to immigration,
p228
aVand it showed that as numbers of immigrants increase,
p229
aVso public concern with immigration also increases,
p230
aValthough it obviously didn't unpack causality,
p231
aVbecause this could equally be to do not so much with numbers
p232
aVbut the political and media narrative around it.
p233
aVBut the same survey also revealed
p234
aVhuge public misinformation
p235
aVand misunderstanding about the nature of immigration.
p236
aVFor example, in these attitudes in the United Kingdom,
p237
aVthe public believed that levels of asylum
p238
aVwere a greater proportion of immigration than they were,
p239
aVbut they also believed the levels of educational migration
p240
aVwere far lower as a proportion of overall migration
p241
aVthan they actually are.
p242
aVSo we have to address this misinformation,
p243
aVthe gap between perception and reality on key aspects of globalization.
p244
aVAnd that can't just be something that's left to our schools,
p245
aValthough that's important to begin at an early age.
p246
aVIt has to be about lifelong civic participation
p247
aVand public engagement that we all encourage as societies.
p248
aa(lp249
VThe second thing that I think is an opportunity
p250
aVis the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VOne of the things that stands out for me very strikingly,
p255
aVlooking at immigration attitudes in the United Kingdom,
p256
aVis that ironically, the regions of my country
p257
aVthat are the most tolerant of immigrants
p258
aVhave the highest numbers of immigrants.
p259
aVSo for instance, London and the Southeast have the highest numbers of immigrants,
p260
aVand they are also by far the most tolerant areas.
p261
aVIt's those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigration
p262
aVthat actually are the most exclusionary and intolerant towards migrants.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo we need to encourage exchange programs.
p265
aVWe need to ensure that older generations who maybe can't travel
p266
aVget access to the Internet.
p267
aVWe need to encourage, even on a local and national level,
p268
aVmore movement, more participation,
p269
aVmore interaction with people who we don't know
p270
aVand whose views we might not necessarily agree with.
p271
aa(lp272
VThe third thing that I think is crucial, though,
p273
aVand this is really fundamental,
p274
aVis we have to ensure that everybody shares
p275
aVin the benefits of globalization.
p276
aVThis illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking.
p277
aVIt shows tragically that those people who voted to leave the European Union
p278
aVwere those who actually benefited the most materially
p279
aVfrom trade with the European Union.
p280
aVBut the problem is that those people in those areas
p281
aVdidn't perceive themselves to be beneficiaries.
p282
aVThey didn't believe that they were actually getting access
p283
aVto material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world.
p284
aa(lp285
VI work on questions predominantly to do with refugees,
p286
aVand one of the ideas I spent a lot of my time preaching,
p287
aVmainly to developing countries around the world,
p288
aVis that in order to encourage the integration of refugees,
p289
aVwe can't just benefit the refugee populations,
p290
aVwe also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas.
p291
aVBut in looking at that,
p292
aVone of the policy prescriptions is that we have to provide
p293
aVdisproportionately better education facilities, health facilities,
p294
aVaccess to social services
p295
aVin those regions of high immigration
p296
aVto address the concerns of those local populations.
p297
aVBut while we encourage that around the developing world,
p298
aVwe don't take those lessons home
p299
aVand incorporate them in our own societies.
p300
aa(lp301
VFurthermore, if we're going to really take seriously
p302
aVthe need to ensure people share in the economic benefits,
p303
aVour businesses and corporations need a model of globalization
p304
aVthat recognizes that they, too, have to take people with them.
p305
aa(lp306
VThe fourth and final idea I want to put forward
p307
aVis an idea that we need more responsible politics.
p308
aVThere's very little social science evidence
p309
aVthat compares attitudes on globalization.
p310
aVBut from the surveys that do exist,
p311
aVwhat we can see is there's huge variation across different countries
p312
aVand time periods in those countries
p313
aVfor attitudes and tolerance
p314
aVof questions like migration and mobility on the one hand
p315
aVand free trade on the other.
p316
aVBut one hypothesis that I think emerges from a cursory look at that data
p317
aVis the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization.
p318
aVIt's the societies like Sweden in the past,
p319
aVlike Canada today,
p320
aVwhere there is a centrist politics,
p321
aVwhere right and left work together,
p322
aVthat we encourage supportive attitudes towards globalization.
p323
aVAnd what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization,
p324
aVa failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics,
p325
aVand a gap in terms of that liberal center ground
p326
aVthat can encourage communication and a shared understanding.
p327
aVWe might not achieve that today,
p328
aVbut at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media
p329
aVto drop a language of fear and be far more tolerant of one another.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Applause)
p332
aa(lp333
VThese ideas are very tentative,
p334
aVand that's in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project.
p335
aa(lp336
VI am still British.
p337
aVI am still European.
p338
aVI am still a global citizen.
p339
aVFor those of us who believe
p340
aVthat our identities are not mutually exclusive,
p341
aVwe have to all work together
p342
aVto ensure that globalization takes everyone with us
p343
aVand doesn't leave people behind.
p344
aVOnly then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization.
p345
aa(lp346
VThank you.

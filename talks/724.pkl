VI'd like to talk to you today about the human brain,
p5
aVwhich is what we do research on at the University of California.
p6
aVJust think about this problem for a second.
p7
aVHere is a lump of flesh, about three pounds,
p8
aVwhich you can hold in the palm of your hand.
p9
aVBut it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
p10
aVIt can contemplate the meaning of infinity,
p11
aVask questions about the meaning of its own existence,
p12
aVabout the nature of God.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.
p15
aVIt's the greatest mystery confronting human beings:
p16
aVHow does this all come about?
p17
aVWell, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons.
p18
aVWe're looking at neurons here.
p19
aVThere are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain.
p20
aVAnd each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts
p21
aVwith other neurons in the brain.
p22
aVAnd based on this, people have calculated
p23
aVthat the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity
p24
aVexceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo, how do you go about studying the brain?
p27
aVOne approach is to look at patients who had lesions
p28
aVin different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior.
p29
aVThis is what I spoke about in the last TED.
p30
aVToday I'll talk about a different approach,
p31
aVwhich is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain,
p32
aVand actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain.
p33
aVSort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, one recent discovery that has been made
p36
aVby researchers in Italy, in Parma,
p37
aVby Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues,
p38
aVis a group of neurons called mirror neurons,
p39
aVwhich are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes.
p40
aVNow, it turns out there are neurons
p41
aVwhich are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain,
p42
aVwhich have been known for over 50 years.
p43
aVThese neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action.
p44
aVFor example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple,
p45
aVa motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire.
p46
aVIf I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire,
p47
aVcommanding me to pull that object.
p48
aVThese are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut what Rizzolatti found was
p51
aVa subset of these neurons,
p52
aVmaybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire
p53
aVwhen I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action.
p54
aVSo, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something,
p55
aVbut it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something.
p56
aVAnd this is truly astonishing.
p57
aVBecause it's as though this neuron is adopting
p58
aVthe other person's point of view.
p59
aVIt's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation
p60
aVof the other person's action.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, what is the significance of these mirror neurons?
p63
aVFor one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation.
p64
aVBecause to imitate a complex act
p65
aVrequires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view.
p66
aVSo, this is important for imitation and emulation.
p67
aVWell, why is that important?
p68
aVWell, let's take a look at the next slide.
p69
aVSo, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important?
p70
aVMirror neurons and imitation, emulation.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture.
p73
aVIf you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago,
p74
aVlet's look at human evolution, it turns out
p75
aVthat something very important happened around 75,000 years ago.
p76
aVAnd that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread
p77
aVof a number of skills that are unique to human beings
p78
aVlike tool use,
p79
aVthe use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language,
p80
aVand the ability to read somebody else's mind
p81
aVand interpret that person's behavior.
p82
aVAll of that happened relatively quickly.
p83
aa(lp84
VEven though the human brain had achieved its present size
p85
aValmost three or four hundred thousand years ago,
p86
aV100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly.
p87
aVAnd I claim that what happened was
p88
aVthe sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system,
p89
aVwhich allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.
p90
aVSo that when there was a sudden accidental discovery
p91
aVby one member of the group, say the use of fire,
p92
aVor a particular type of tool, instead of dying out,
p93
aVthis spread rapidly, horizontally across the population,
p94
aVor was transmitted vertically, down the generations.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian,
p97
aVinstead of Darwinian.
p98
aVDarwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.
p99
aVA polar bear, to evolve a coat,
p100
aVwill take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.
p101
aVA human being, a child, can just watch its parent
p102
aVkill another polar bear,
p103
aVand skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body,
p104
aVand learn it in one step. What the polar bear
p105
aVtook 100,000 years to learn,
p106
aVit can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.
p107
aVAnd then once it's learned this it spreads
p108
aVin geometric proportion across a population.
p109
aa(lp110
VThis is the basis. The imitation of complex skills
p111
aVis what we call culture and is the basis of civilization.
p112
aVNow there is another kind of mirror neuron,
p113
aVwhich is involved in something quite different.
p114
aVAnd that is, there are mirror neurons,
p115
aVjust as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch.
p116
aVIn other words, if somebody touches me,
p117
aVmy hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex
p118
aVin the sensory region of the brain fires.
p119
aVBut the same neuron, in some cases, will fire
p120
aVwhen I simply watch another person being touched.
p121
aVSo, it's empathizing the other person being touched.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo, most of them will fire when I'm touched
p124
aVin different locations. Different neurons for different locations.
p125
aVBut a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else
p126
aVbeing touched in the same location.
p127
aVSo, here again you have neurons
p128
aVwhich are enrolled in empathy.
p129
aVNow, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched,
p130
aVwhy do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation
p131
aVmerely by watching somebody being touched?
p132
aVI mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch.
p133
aVWell, that's because you've got receptors in your skin,
p134
aVtouch and pain receptors, going back into your brain
p135
aVand saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched.
p136
aVSo, empathize, by all means, with the other person,
p137
aVbut do not actually experience the touch,
p138
aVotherwise you'll get confused and muddled."
p139
aa(lp140
VOkay, so there is a feedback signal
p141
aVthat vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron
p142
aVpreventing you from consciously experiencing that touch.
p143
aVBut if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm,
p144
aVso you put an injection into my arm,
p145
aVanesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb,
p146
aVand there is no sensations coming in,
p147
aVif I now watch you being touched,
p148
aVI literally feel it in my hand.
p149
aVIn other words, you have dissolved the barrier
p150
aVbetween you and other human beings.
p151
aVSo, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense.
p155
aVAll that's separating you from him,
p156
aVfrom the other person, is your skin.
p157
aVRemove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind.
p158
aVYou've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings.
p159
aVAnd this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy,
p160
aVand that is there is no real independent self,
p161
aValoof from other human beings, inspecting the world,
p162
aVinspecting other people.
p163
aVYou are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet,
p164
aVyou're actually quite literally connected by your neurons.
p165
aVAnd there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other.
p166
aVAnd there is no real distinctiveness
p167
aVof your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy.
p170
aVIt emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience.
p171
aVSo, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed
p172
aVand you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else
p173
aVbeing touched, you feel it in your phantom.
p174
aVNow the astonishing thing is,
p175
aVif you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand,
p176
aVmassage the other person's hand,
p177
aVthat relieves the pain in your phantom hand,
p178
aValmost as though the neuron
p179
aVwere obtaining relief from merely
p180
aVwatching somebody else being massaged.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo, here you have my last slide.
p183
aVFor the longest time people have regarded science
p184
aVand humanities as being distinct.
p185
aVC.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures:
p186
aVscience on the one hand, humanities on the other;
p187
aVnever the twain shall meet.
p188
aVSo, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface
p189
aVallowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness,
p190
aVrepresentation of self,
p191
aVwhat separates you from other human beings,
p192
aVwhat allows you to empathize with other human beings,
p193
aVand also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization,
p194
aVwhich is unique to human beings. Thank you.
p195
aV(Applause)

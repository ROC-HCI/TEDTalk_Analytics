VThe shocking police crackdown on protestors in Ferguson, Missouri,
p5
aVin the wake of the police  shooting of Michael Brown,
p6
aVunderscored the extent to which advanced military weapons and equipment,
p7
aVdesigned for the battlefield,
p8
aVare making their way
p9
aVto small-town police departments across the United States.
p10
aVAlthough much tougher to observe,
p11
aVthis same thing is happening  with surveillance equipment.
p12
aa(lp13
VNSA-style mass  surveillance is enabling
p14
aVlocal police departments  to gather vast quantities
p15
aVof sensitive information about each and every one of us
p16
aVin a way that was never previously possible.
p17
aa(lp18
VLocation information can  be very sensitive.
p19
aVIf you drive your car around the United States,
p20
aVit can reveal if you go  to a therapist,
p21
aVattend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting,
p22
aVif you go to church  or if you don't go to church.
p23
aVAnd when that  information about you
p24
aVis combined with the same information about everyone else,
p25
aVthe government can gain  a detailed portrait
p26
aVof how private citizens interact.
p27
aa(lp28
VThis information used to be private.
p29
aVThanks to modern technology,
p30
aVthe government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors.
p31
aVAnd local police departments make decisions about who they think you are
p32
aVbased on this information.
p33
aa(lp34
VOne of the key technologies  driving mass location tracking
p35
aVis the innocuous-sounding Automatic License Plate Reader.
p36
aVIf you haven't seen one,
p37
aVit's probably because you didn't know what to look for \u2014
p38
aVthey're everywhere.
p39
aVMounted on roads or  on police cars,
p40
aVAutomatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car
p41
aVand convert the license plate into machine-readable text
p42
aVso that they can be checked against hot lists
p43
aVof cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut more than that, increasingly,
p46
aVlocal police departments  are keeping records
p47
aVnot just of people wanted for wrongdoing,
p48
aVbut of every plate that  passes them by,
p49
aVresulting in the collection of mass quantities of data
p50
aVabout where Americans have gone.
p51
aVDid you know this was happening?
p52
aa(lp53
VWhen Mike Katz-Lacabe asked his local police department
p54
aVfor information about the plate reader data they had on him,
p55
aVthis is what they got:
p56
aVin addition to the date,  time and location,
p57
aVthe police department had  photographs that captured
p58
aVwhere he was going and  often who he was with.
p59
aVThe second photo from the top is a picture of Mike and his two daughters
p60
aVgetting out of their car in their own driveway.
p61
aVThe government has  hundreds of photos like this
p62
aVabout Mike going about his daily life.
p63
aVAnd if you drive a car  in the United States,
p64
aVI would bet money  that they have photographs
p65
aVlike this of you going about your daily life.
p66
aa(lp67
VMike hasn't done anything wrong.
p68
aVWhy is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information?
p69
aVThe reason it's happening is because,
p70
aVas the cost of storing this data has plummeted,
p71
aVthe police departments simply hang on to it,
p72
aVjust in case it could be useful someday.
p73
aVThe issue is not just that one police department
p74
aVis gathering this information in isolation
p75
aVor even that multiple police  departments are doing it.
p76
aVAt the same time, the federal government
p77
aVis collecting all of these individual pots of data,
p78
aVand pooling them together  into one vast database
p79
aVwith hundreds of millions of hits,
p80
aVshowing where Americans have traveled.
p81
aVThis document from the  Federal Drug Enforcement Administration,
p82
aVwhich is one of the agencies primarily interested in this,
p83
aVis one of several that reveal  the existence of this database.
p84
aVMeanwhile, in New York City,
p85
aVthe NYPD has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers
p86
aVpast mosques in order to figure out who is attending.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe uses and abuses of this technology aren't limited to the United States.
p89
aVIn the U.K., the police department
p90
aVput 80-year-old John Kat on a plate reader watch list
p91
aVafter he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations
p92
aVwhere he liked to sit on a bench and sketch the attendees.
p93
aa(lp94
VLicense plate readers aren't the only mass location tracking technology
p95
aVavailable to law enforcement agents today.
p96
aVThrough a technique known as a cell tower dump,
p97
aVlaw enforcement agents can uncover who was using
p98
aVone or more cell towers at a particular time,
p99
aVa technique which has been known to reveal
p100
aVthe location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people.
p101
aVAlso, using a device known as a StingRay,
p102
aVlaw enforcement agents can send tracking signals
p103
aVinside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there.
p104
aVAnd if they don't know which house to target,
p105
aVthey've been known  to drive this technology
p106
aVaround through whole neighborhoods.
p107
aa(lp108
VJust as the police in Ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment,
p109
aVso too do police departments across the United States
p110
aVpossess high-tech surveillance gear.
p111
aVJust because you don't see it,
p112
aVdoesn't mean it's not there.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe question is, what should we do about this?
p115
aVI think this poses a serious civil liberties threat.
p116
aVHistory has shown that once the police  have massive quantities of data,
p117
aVtracking the movements of innocent people,
p118
aVit gets abused, maybe for blackmail, maybe for political advantage,
p119
aVor maybe for simple voyeurism.
p120
aa(lp121
VFortunately, there are steps we can take.
p122
aVLocal police departments can  be governed by the city councils,
p123
aVwhich can pass laws requiring the police
p124
aVto dispose of the data  about innocent people
p125
aVwhile allowing the legitimate uses of the technology to go forward.
p126
aVThank you.
p127
aV(Applause).

VI'm a teacher and a practitioner
p5
aVof civics in America.
p6
aVNow, I will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep
p7
aVto please wake up. (Laughter)
p8
aVWhy is it that the very word "civics"
p9
aVhas such a soporific,  even a narcoleptic effect
p10
aVon us?
p11
aVI think it's because the very  word signifies something
p12
aVexceedingly virtuous,  exceedingly important,
p13
aVand exceedingly boring.
p14
aVWell, I think it's the responsibility of people like us,
p15
aVpeople who show up for gatherings like this
p16
aVin person or online, in any way we can,
p17
aVto make civics sexy again,
p18
aVas sexy as it was during the American Revolution,
p19
aVas sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement.
p20
aVAnd I believe the way we make civics sexy again
p21
aVis to make explicitly about the teaching of power.
p22
aVThe way we do that, I believe,
p23
aVis at the level of the city.
p24
aa(lp25
VThis is what I want to talk about today,
p26
aVand I want to start by defining some terms
p27
aVand then I want to describe the scale
p28
aVof the problem I think we face
p29
aVand then suggest the ways that I believe cities
p30
aVcan be the seat of the solution.
p31
aVSo let me start with some definitions.
p32
aVBy civics, I simply mean the art
p33
aVof being a pro-social, problem-solving contributor
p34
aVin a self-governing community.
p35
aVCivics is the art of citizenship,
p36
aVwhat Bill Gates Sr. calls simply
p37
aVshowing up for life,
p38
aVand it encompasses three things:
p39
aVa foundation of values,
p40
aVan understanding of the systems that make the world go round,
p41
aVand a set of skills
p42
aVthat allow you to pursue goals
p43
aVand to have others join in that pursuit.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd that brings me to my definition of power,
p46
aVwhich is simply this:
p47
aVthe capacity to make others do
p48
aVwhat you would have them do.
p49
aVIt sounds menacing, doesn't it?
p50
aVWe don't like to talk about power.
p51
aVWe find it scary. We find it somehow evil.
p52
aVWe feel uncomfortable naming it.
p53
aVIn the culture and mythology of democracy,
p54
aVpower resides with the people.
p55
aVPeriod. End of story.
p56
aVAny further inquiry not necessary
p57
aVand not really that welcome.
p58
aVPower has a negative moral valence.
p59
aVIt sounds Machiavellian inherently.
p60
aVIt seems inherently evil.
p61
aVBut in fact power is no more inherently good or evil
p62
aVthan fire or physics.
p63
aVIt just is.
p64
aVAnd power governs
p65
aVhow any form of government operates,
p66
aVwhether a democracy or a dictatorship.
p67
aVAnd the problem we face today, here in America in particular,
p68
aVbut all around the world,
p69
aVis that far too many people  are profoundly illiterate
p70
aVin power \u2014
p71
aVwhat it is, who has it,
p72
aVhow it operates, how it flows,
p73
aVwhat part of it is visible,  what part of it is not,
p74
aVwhy some people have it,  why that's compounded.
p75
aVAnd as a result of this illiteracy,
p76
aVthose few who do understand
p77
aVhow power operates in civic life,
p78
aVthose who understand
p79
aVhow a bill becomes a law, yes,
p80
aVbut also how a friendship  becomes a subsidy,
p81
aVor how a bias becomes a policy,
p82
aVor how a slogan becomes a movement,
p83
aVthe people who understand those things
p84
aVwield disproportionate influence,
p85
aVand they're perfectly happy
p86
aVto fill the vacuum created by the ignorance
p87
aVof the great majority.
p88
aa(lp89
VThis is why it is so fundamental for us right now
p90
aVto grab hold of this idea of power
p91
aVand to democratize it.
p92
aVOne of the things that is so profoundly exciting
p93
aVand challenging about this moment
p94
aVis that as a result of this power illiteracy
p95
aVthat is so pervasive,
p96
aVthere is a concentration
p97
aVof knowledge, of understanding, of clout.
p98
aVI mean, think about it:
p99
aVHow does a friendship become a subsidy?
p100
aVSeamlessly,
p101
aVwhen a senior government official decides
p102
aVto leave government and become a lobbyist
p103
aVfor a private interest
p104
aVand convert his or her relationships into capital
p105
aVfor their new masters.
p106
aVHow does a bias become a policy?
p107
aVInsidiously, just the way that
p108
aVstop-and-frisk, for instance,
p109
aVbecame over time a bureaucratic numbers game.
p110
aVHow does a slogan become a movement?
p111
aVVirally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance,
p112
aVwas able to take the "Don't Tread on Me" flag
p113
aVfrom the American Revolution,
p114
aVor how, on the other side,
p115
aVa band of activists could take a magazine headline,
p116
aV"Occupy Wall Street,"
p117
aVand turn that into a global meme and movement.
p118
aVThe thing is, though, most people
p119
aVaren't looking for and don't want to see these realities.
p120
aVSo much of this ignorance, this civic illiteracy,
p121
aVis willful.
p122
aVThere are some millennials, for instance,
p123
aVwho think the whole business is just sordid.
p124
aVThey don't want to have anything to do with politics.
p125
aVThey'd rather just opt out
p126
aVand engage in volunteerism.
p127
aVThere are some techies out there
p128
aVwho believe that the cure-all
p129
aVfor any power imbalance or power abuse
p130
aVis simply more data,
p131
aVmore transparency.
p132
aVThere are some on the left who think power resides
p133
aVonly with corporations,
p134
aVand some on the right who think power
p135
aVresides only with government,
p136
aVeach side blinded by their selective outrage.
p137
aVThere are the naive who believe that
p138
aVgood things just happen
p139
aVand the cynical who believe that bad things just happen,
p140
aVthe fortunate and unfortunate alike
p141
aVwho think that their lot is simply what they deserve
p142
aVrather than the eminently alterable result
p143
aVof a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation,
p144
aVof power.
p145
aa(lp146
VAs a result of all of this creeping fatalism in public life,
p147
aVwe here, particularly in America today,
p148
aVhave depressingly low levels
p149
aVof civic knowledge, civic engagement, participation,
p150
aVawareness.
p151
aVThe whole business of politics has been
p152
aVeffectively subcontracted out to a band of professionals,
p153
aVmoney people, outreach people,
p154
aVmessage people, research people.
p155
aVThe rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs
p156
aVin the sense of suckers.
p157
aVWe become demotivated to learn more
p158
aVabout how things work.
p159
aVWe begin to opt out.
p160
aa(lp161
VWell, this problem, this challenge,
p162
aVis a thing that we must now confront,
p163
aVand I believe that when you have
p164
aVthis kind of disengagement, this willful ignorance,
p165
aVit becomes both a cause and a consequence
p166
aVof this concentration of opportunity
p167
aVof wealth and clout that I was describing a moment ago,
p168
aVthis profound civic inequality.
p169
aVThis is why it is so important in our time right now
p170
aVto reimagine civics as the teaching of power.
p171
aVPerhaps it's never been more important
p172
aVat any time in our lifetimes.
p173
aVIf people don't learn power,
p174
aVpeople don't wake up,
p175
aVand if they don't wake up,
p176
aVthey get left out.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, part of the art of practicing power
p179
aVmeans being awake and having a voice,
p180
aVbut it also is about having an arena
p181
aVwhere you can plausibly practice deciding.
p182
aVAll of civics boils down to the simple question
p183
aVof who decides,
p184
aVand you have to play that out
p185
aVin a place, in an arena.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd this brings me to the third point that I want to make today,
p188
aVwhich is simply that there is no better arena
p189
aVin our time for the practicing of power
p190
aVthan the city.
p191
aVThink about the city where you live,
p192
aVwhere you're from.
p193
aVThink about a problem in the common life of your city.
p194
aVIt can be something small,
p195
aVlike where a street lamp should go,
p196
aVor something medium like
p197
aVwhich library should have its hours extended or cut,
p198
aVor maybe something bigger,
p199
aVlike whether a dilapidated waterfront should be
p200
aVturned into a highway or a greenway,
p201
aVor whether all the businesses in your town
p202
aVshould be required to pay a living wage.
p203
aVThink about the change that you want in your city,
p204
aVand then think about how you would get it,
p205
aVhow you would make it happen.
p206
aVTake an inventory of all the forms of power
p207
aVthat are at play in your city's situation:
p208
aVmoney, of course, people, yes,
p209
aVideas, information, misinformation,
p210
aVthe threat of force, the force of norms.
p211
aVAll of these form of power are at play.
p212
aVNow think about how you would activate
p213
aVor perhaps neutralize these various forms of power.
p214
aa(lp215
VThis is not some Game of Thrones
p216
aVempire-level set of questions.
p217
aVThese are questions that play out
p218
aVin every single place on the planet.
p219
aVI'll just tell you quickly about two stories
p220
aVdrawn from recent headlines.
p221
aVIn Boulder, Colorado,
p222
aVvoters not too long ago approved a process
p223
aVto replace the private power company,
p224
aVliterally the power company, the electric company Xcel,
p225
aVwith a publicly owned utility
p226
aVthat would forego profits
p227
aVand attend far more to climate change.
p228
aVWell, Xcel fought back,
p229
aVand Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure
p230
aVthat would undermine or undo
p231
aVthis municipalization.
p232
aVAnd so the citizen activists in Boulder who have been pushing this
p233
aVnow literally have to fight the power
p234
aVin order to fight for power.
p235
aVIn Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama,
p236
aVthere's an organization on campus
p237
aVcalled, kind of menacingly, the Machine,
p238
aVand it draws from largely white sororities
p239
aVand fraternities on campus,
p240
aVand for decades, the Machine has dominated
p241
aVstudent government elections.
p242
aVWell now, recently, the Machine
p243
aVhas started to get involved
p244
aVin actual city politics,
p245
aVand they've engineered the election
p246
aVof a former Machine member,
p247
aVa young, pro-business recent graduate
p248
aVto the Tuscaloosa city school board.
p249
aVNow, as I say, these are just two examples
p250
aVdrawn almost at random from the headlines.
p251
aVEvery day, there are thousands more like them.
p252
aVAnd you may like or dislike
p253
aVthe efforts I'm describing here
p254
aVin Boulder or in Tuscaloosa,
p255
aVbut you cannot help but admire
p256
aVthe power literacy of the players involved,
p257
aVtheir skill.
p258
aVYou cannot help but reckon with and recognize
p259
aVthe command they have
p260
aVof the elemental questions
p261
aVof civic power \u2014
p262
aVwhat objective, what strategy, what tactics,
p263
aVwhat is the terrain, who are your enemies,
p264
aVwho are your allies?
p265
aa(lp266
VNow I want you to return
p267
aVto thinking about that problem or that opportunity
p268
aVor that challenge in your city,
p269
aVand the thing it was that you want to fix
p270
aVor create in your city,
p271
aVand ask yourself,
p272
aVdo you have command of these elemental questions of power?
p273
aVCould you put into practice effectively
p274
aVwhat it is that you know?
p275
aVThis is the challenge and the opportunity for us.
p276
aa(lp277
VWe live in a time right now
p278
aVwhere in spite of globalization
p279
aVor perhaps because of globalization,
p280
aVall citizenship is ever more resonantly,
p281
aVpowerfully local.
p282
aVIndeed, power in our time is flowing
p283
aVever faster to the city.
p284
aVHere in the United States, the national government
p285
aVhas tied itself up in partisan knots.
p286
aVCivic imagination and innovation and creativity
p287
aVare emerging from local ecosystems now
p288
aVand radiating outward,
p289
aVand this great innovation,
p290
aVthis great wave
p291
aVof localism that's now arriving,
p292
aVand you see it in how people eat
p293
aVand work and share and buy and move
p294
aVand live their everyday lives,
p295
aVthis isn't some precious parochialism,
p296
aVthis isn't some retreat into insularity, no.
p297
aVThis is emergent.
p298
aVThe localism of our time is networked powerfully.
p299
aVAnd so, for instance,
p300
aVconsider the ways that strategies
p301
aVfor making cities more bike-friendly
p302
aVhave spread so rapidly from Copenhagen
p303
aVto New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle.
p304
aVThink about how experiments in participatory budgeting,
p305
aVwhere everyday citizens get a chance
p306
aVto allocate and decide upon
p307
aVthe allocation of city funds.
p308
aVThose experiments have spread from Porto Alegre, Brazil
p309
aVto here in New York City,  to the wards of Chicago.
p310
aVMigrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles
p311
aVand many cities between
p312
aVare now organizing to stage strikes
p313
aVto remind the people who live in their cities
p314
aVwhat a day without immigrants would look like.
p315
aVIn China, all across that country,
p316
aVmembers of the New Citizens' Movement
p317
aVare beginning to activate and organize
p318
aVto fight official corruption and graft,
p319
aVand they're drawing the ire of officials there,
p320
aVbut they're also drawing the attention
p321
aVof anti-corruption activists all around the world.
p322
aVIn Seattle, where I'm from,
p323
aVwe've become part of a great global array of cities
p324
aVthat are now working together
p325
aVbypassing government altogether,
p326
aVnational government altogether,
p327
aVin order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals
p328
aVof the Kyoto Protocol.
p329
aVAll of these citizens, united,
p330
aVare forming a web,
p331
aVa great archipelago of power
p332
aVthat allows us to bypass
p333
aVbrokenness and monopolies of control.
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd our task now is to accelerate this work.
p336
aVOur task now is to bring more and more people
p337
aVinto the fold of this work.
p338
aVThat's why my organization, Citizen University,
p339
aVhas undertaken a project now
p340
aVto create an everyman's curriculum
p341
aVin civic power.
p342
aVAnd this curriculum starts with this triad
p343
aVthat I described earlier of values,
p344
aVsystems and skills.
p345
aVAnd what I'd like to do is to invite all of you
p346
aVto help create this curriculum
p347
aVwith the stories and the experiences
p348
aVand the challenges that each of you lives and faces,
p349
aVto create something powerfully collective.
p350
aVAnd I want to invite you in particular to try
p351
aVa simple exercise drawn
p352
aVfrom the early frameworks of this curriculum.
p353
aVI want you to write a narrative,
p354
aVa narrative from the future of your city,
p355
aVand you can date it, set it out one year from now,
p356
aVfive years from now, a decade from now,
p357
aVa generation from now,
p358
aVand write it as a case study looking back,
p359
aVlooking back at the change
p360
aVthat you wanted in your city,
p361
aVlooking back at the cause that you were championing,
p362
aVand describing the ways that that change
p363
aVand that cause came, in fact, to succeed.
p364
aVDescribe the values
p365
aVof your fellow citizens that you activated,
p366
aVand the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir.
p367
aVRecount all the different ways
p368
aVthat you engaged the systems of government,
p369
aVof the marketplace,
p370
aVof social institutions, of faith organizations,
p371
aVof the media.
p372
aVCatalog all the skills you had to deploy,
p373
aVhow to negotiate, how to advocate,
p374
aVhow to frame issues,
p375
aVhow to navigate diversity in conflict,
p376
aVall those skills that enabled you
p377
aVto bring folks on board
p378
aVand to overcome resistance.
p379
aVWhat you'll be doing when you write that narrative
p380
aVis you'll be discovering how to read power,
p381
aVand in the process, how to write power.
p382
aVSo share what you write,
p383
aVdo you what you write,
p384
aVand then share what you do.
p385
aVI invite you to literally share
p386
aVthe narratives that you create
p387
aVon our Facebook page for Citizen University.
p388
aVBut even beyond that, it's in the conversations
p389
aVthat we have today
p390
aVall around the world in the simultaneous gatherings
p391
aVthat are happening on this topic at this moment,
p392
aVand to think about how we can become
p393
aVone another's teachers and students in power.
p394
aVIf we do that, then together
p395
aVwe can make civics sexy again.
p396
aVTogether, we can democratize democracy
p397
aVand make it safe again for amateurs.
p398
aVTogether, we can create a great network of city
p399
aVthat will be the most powerful collective laboratory
p400
aVfor self-government this planet has ever seen.
p401
aVWe have the power to do that.
p402
aa(lp403

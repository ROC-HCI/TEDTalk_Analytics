VMy name is Kate Hartman.
p5
aVAnd I like to make devices
p6
aVthat play with the ways
p7
aVthat we relate and communicate.
p8
aVSo I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans,
p9
aVrelate to ourselves, each other
p10
aVand the world around us.
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aVSo just to give you a bit of context,
p13
aVas June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.
p14
aVI teach courses in physical computing
p15
aVand wearable electronics.
p16
aVAnd much of what I do is either wearable
p17
aVor somehow related to the human form.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd so anytime I talk about what I do,
p20
aVI like to just quickly address
p21
aVthe reason why bodies matter.
p22
aVAnd it's pretty simple.
p23
aVEverybody's got one \u2014 all of you.
p24
aVI can guarantee, everyone in this room,
p25
aVall of you over there, the people in the cushy seats,
p26
aVthe people up top with the laptops \u2014
p27
aVwe all have bodies.
p28
aVDon't be ashamed.
p29
aVIt's something that we have in common
p30
aVand they act as our primary interfaces for the world.
p31
aVAnd so when working as an interaction designer,
p32
aVor as an artist who deals with participation \u2014
p33
aVcreating things that live on, in or around the human form \u2014
p34
aVit's really a powerful space to work within.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo within my own work,
p37
aVI use a broad range of materials and tools.
p38
aVSo I communicate through everything from radio transceivers
p39
aVto funnels and plastic tubing.
p40
aVAnd to tell you a bit about the things that I make,
p41
aVthe easiest place to start the story
p42
aVis with a hat.
p43
aVAnd so it all started several years ago,
p44
aVlate one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home,
p45
aVand I was thinking.
p46
aVAnd I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.
p47
aVAnd so I was thinking about how it might be great
p48
aVif I could just take all these noises \u2014
p49
aVlike all these sounds of my thoughts in my head \u2014
p50
aVif I could just physically extricate them
p51
aVand pull them out in such a form
p52
aVthat I could share them with somebody else.
p53
aVAnd so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.
p54
aVAnd I called it the Muttering Hat,
p55
aVbecause it emitted these muttering noises
p56
aVthat were kind of tethered to you,
p57
aVbut you could detach them
p58
aVand share them with somebody else.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo I make other hats as well.
p63
aVThis one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVIt's fairly self-explanatory.
p66
aVIt physically carves out conversation space for one.
p67
aVAnd when you speak out loud,
p68
aVthe sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVAnd so when I make these things,
p71
aVit's really not so much about the object itself,
p72
aVbut rather the negative space around the object.
p73
aVSo what happens when a person puts this thing on?
p74
aVWhat kind of an experience do they have?
p75
aVAnd how are they transformed by wearing it?
p76
aa(lp77
VSo many of these devices
p78
aVreally kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.
p79
aVSo this particular device is called the Gut Listener.
p80
aVAnd it is a tool
p81
aVthat actually enables one
p82
aVto listen to their own innards.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd so some of these things
p85
aVare actually more geared toward expression and communication.
p86
aVAnd so the Inflatable Heart
p87
aVis an external organ
p88
aVthat can be used by the wearer to express themselves.
p89
aVSo they can actually inflate it and deflate it
p90
aVaccording to their emotions.
p91
aVSo they can express everything from admiration and lust
p92
aVto anxiety and angst.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVAnd some of these are actually meant
p95
aVto mediate experiences.
p96
aVSo the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVAnd so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange,
p99
aVbut is serves to absorb
p100
aVthe specificity of the words that are delivered.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVAnd in the end,
p103
aVsome of these things just act as invitations.
p104
aVSo the Ear Bender literally puts something out there
p105
aVso someone can grab your ear
p106
aVand say what they have to say.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo even though I'm really interested in the relationship
p109
aVbetween people,
p110
aVI also consider the ways
p111
aVin which we relate to the world around us.
p112
aVAnd so when I was first living in New York City a few years back,
p113
aVI was thinking a lot about
p114
aVthe familiar architectural forms that surrounded me
p115
aVand how I would like to better relate to them.
p116
aVAnd I thought, "Well, hey!
p117
aVMaybe if I want to better relate to walls,
p118
aVmaybe I need to be more wall-like myself."
p119
aVSo I made a wearable wall
p120
aVthat I could wear as a backpack.
p121
aVAnd so I would put it on
p122
aVand sort of physically transform myself
p123
aVso that I could either contribute to or critique
p124
aVthe spaces that surrounded me.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd so jumping off of that,
p129
aVthinking beyond the built environment into the natural world,
p130
aVI have this ongoing project called Botanicalls \u2014
p131
aVwhich actually enables houseplants
p132
aVto tap into human communication protocols.
p133
aVSo when a plant is thirsty,
p134
aVit can actually make a phone call
p135
aVor post a message to a service like Twitter.
p136
aVAnd so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic,
p137
aVbecause a single house plant
p138
aVcan actually express its needs
p139
aVto thousands of people at the same time.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd so kind of thinking about scale,
p142
aVmy most recent obsession
p143
aVis actually with glaciers \u2014 of course.
p144
aVAnd so glaciers are these magnificent beings,
p145
aVand there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them,
p146
aVbut what I'm particularly interested in
p147
aVis in human-glacier relations.
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aVBecause there seems to be an issue.
p150
aVThe glaciers are actually leaving us.
p151
aVThey're both shrinking and retreating \u2014
p152
aVand some of them have disappeared altogether.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd so I actually live in Canada now,
p155
aVso I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.
p156
aVAnd this one's particularly interesting,
p157
aVbecause, of all the glaciers in North America,
p158
aVit receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.
p159
aVThey actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine
p160
aVand drop people off on the surface of the glacier.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd this has really gotten me thinking
p163
aVabout this experience of the initial encounter.
p164
aVWhen I meet a glacier for the very first time,
p165
aVwhat do I do?
p166
aVThere's no kind of social protocol for this.
p167
aVI really just don't even know
p168
aVhow to say hello.
p169
aVDo I carve a message in the snow?
p170
aVOr perhaps I can assemble one
p171
aVout of dot and dash ice cubes \u2014
p172
aVice cube Morse code.
p173
aVOr perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool,
p174
aVlike an icy megaphone
p175
aVthat I can use to amplify my voice
p176
aVwhen I direct it at the ice.
p177
aVBut really the most satisfying experience I've had
p178
aVis the act of listening,
p179
aVwhich is what we need in any good relationship.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd I was really struck by how much it affected me.
p182
aVThis very basic shift in my physical orientation
p183
aVhelped me shift my perspective
p184
aVin relation to the glacier.
p185
aVAnd so since we use devices
p186
aVto figure out how to relate to the world these days,
p187
aVI actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVAnd so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material
p190
aVthat serves to mediate the difference in temperature
p191
aVbetween the human body and the glacial ice.
p192
aVAnd once again, it's this invitation
p193
aVthat asks people to lay down on the glacier
p194
aVand give it a hug.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo, yea, this is actually just the beginning.
p197
aVThese are initial musings for this project.
p198
aVAnd just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like,
p199
aVwith this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.
p200
aVAnd so my intent
p201
aVis to actually just take the next 10 years
p202
aVand go on a series of collaborative projects
p203
aVwhere I work with people from different disciplines \u2014
p204
aVartists, technologists, scientists \u2014
p205
aVto kind of work on this project
p206
aVof how we can improve human-glacier relations.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo beyond that, in closing,
p209
aVI'd just like to say that we're in this era
p210
aVof communications and device proliferation,
p211
aVand it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy,
p212
aVbut I think what's really important
p213
aVis thinking about how we can simultaneously
p214
aVmaintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality
p215
aVabout the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.
p216
aa(lp217
VThanks.

aVAIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.
p6
aVThese Gapminder bubbles show you
p7
aVhow the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world,
p8
aVor how we estimate that it was.
p9
aVWhat we are showing here is \u2014
p10
aVon this axis here, I'm showing percent of infected adults.
p11
aVAnd on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income.
p12
aVAnd the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here,
p13
aVthat shows how many are infected in each country,
p14
aVand the color is the continent.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, you can see United States, in 1983,
p17
aVhad a very low percentage infected,
p18
aVbut due to the big population, still a sizable bubble.
p19
aVThere were quite many people infected in the United States.
p20
aVAnd, up there, you see Uganda.
p21
aVThey had almost five percent infected,
p22
aVand quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country, then.
p23
aVAnd they were probably the most infected country in the world.
p24
aVNow, what has happened?
p25
aVNow you have understood the graph
p26
aVand now, in the next 60 seconds,
p27
aVwe will play the HIV epidemic in the world.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut first, I have a new invention here.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVI have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
V(Applause)
p36
aa(lp37
VSo, ready, steady, go!
p38
aVFirst, we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.
p39
aVThey went upwards like this.
p40
aVIn Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand \u2014
p41
aVthey reached one to two percent.
p42
aVThen, Uganda started to turn back,
p43
aVwhereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed,
p44
aVand some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.
p45
aVLook, India got many infected,
p46
aVbut had a low level.
p47
aVAnd almost the same happens here.
p48
aVSee, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down,
p49
aVRussia went to one percent.
p50
aa(lp51
VIn the last two to three years,
p52
aVwe have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.
p53
aV25 years it took.
p54
aVBut, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better,
p55
aVit's just that they have stopped getting worse.
p56
aVAnd it has \u2014 the steady state is, more or less,
p57
aVone percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected.
p58
aVIt means 30 to 40 million people,
p59
aVthe whole of California \u2014 every person,
p60
aVthat's more or less what we have today in the world.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, let me make a fast replay of Botswana.
p63
aVBotswana \u2014 upper middle-income country in southern Africa,
p64
aVdemocratic government, good economy,
p65
aVand this is what happened there.
p66
aVThey started low, they skyrocketed,
p67
aVthey peaked up there in 2003,
p68
aVand now they are down.
p69
aVBut they are falling only slowly,
p70
aVbecause in Botswana, with good economy and governance,
p71
aVthey can manage to treat people.
p72
aVAnd if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS.
p73
aVThese percentages won't come down
p74
aVbecause people can survive 10 to 20 years.
p75
aVSo there's some problem with these metrics now.
p76
aVBut the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here,
p77
aVthere the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected,
p78
aVbecause people still die.
p79
aVIn spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR,
p80
aVall people are not reached by treatment,
p81
aVand of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries,
p82
aVonly 60 percent are left on treatment after two years.
p83
aVIt's not realistic with lifelong treatment
p84
aVfor everyone in the poorest countries.
p85
aVBut it's very good that what is done is being done.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut focus now is back on prevention.
p88
aVIt is only by stopping the transmission
p89
aVthat the world will be able to deal with it.
p90
aVDrugs is too costly \u2014 had we had the vaccine,
p91
aVor when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective \u2014
p92
aVbut the drugs are very costly for the poor.
p93
aVNot the drug in itself, but the treatment
p94
aVand the care which is needed around it.
p95
aVSo, when we look at the pattern,
p96
aVone thing comes out very clearly:
p97
aVyou see the blue bubbles
p98
aVand people say HIV is very high in Africa.
p99
aVI would say, HIV is very different in Africa.
p100
aVYou'll find the highest HIV rate in the world
p101
aVin African countries,
p102
aVand yet you'll find Senegal, down here \u2014
p103
aVthe same rate as United States.
p104
aVAnd you'll find Madagascar,
p105
aVand you'll find a lot of African countries
p106
aVabout as low as the rest of the world.
p107
aVIt's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa
p108
aVand things go on in one way in Africa.
p109
aVWe have to stop that.
p110
aVIt's not respectful, and it's not very clever
p111
aVto think that way.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VI had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States.
p116
aVI found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVAnd so it is in Africa \u2014 it's a lot of difference.
p119
aVSo, why is it so high? Is it war?
p120
aVNo, it's not. Look here.
p121
aVWar-torn Congo is down there \u2014 two, three, four percent.
p122
aVAnd this is peaceful Zambia, neighboring country \u2014 15 percent.
p123
aVAnd there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo \u2014
p124
aVthey have two, three percent infected,
p125
aVand peaceful Zambia \u2014 much higher.
p126
aVThere are now studies clearly showing
p127
aVthat the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible,
p128
aVbut this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, is it poverty?
p131
aVWell if you look at the macro level,
p132
aVit seems more money, more HIV.
p133
aVBut that's very simplistic,
p134
aVso let's go down and look at Tanzania.
p135
aVI will split Tanzania in five income groups,
p136
aVfrom the highest income to the lowest income,
p137
aVand here we go.
p138
aVThe ones with the highest income, the better off \u2014 I wouldn't say rich \u2014
p139
aVthey have higher HIV.
p140
aVThe difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent,
p141
aVand it is even bigger among women.
p142
aVThere's a lot of things that we thought, that now, good research,
p143
aVdone by African institutions and researchers
p144
aVtogether with the international researchers, show that that's not the case.
p145
aVSo, this is the difference within Tanzania.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd, I can't avoid showing Kenya.
p148
aVLook here at Kenya.
p149
aVI've split Kenya in its provinces.
p150
aVHere it goes.
p151
aVSee the difference within one African country \u2014
p152
aVit goes from very low level to very high level,
p153
aVand most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo, what is it then?
p156
aVWhy do we see this extremely high levels in some countries?
p157
aVWell, it is more common with multiple partners,
p158
aVthere is less condom use,
p159
aVand there is age-disparate sex \u2014
p160
aVthat is, older men tend to have sex with younger women.
p161
aVWe see higher rates in younger women than younger men
p162
aVin many of these highly affected countries.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut where are they situated?
p165
aVI will swap the bubbles to a map.
p166
aVLook, the highly infected are four percent of all population
p167
aVand they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.
p168
aVHIV exists all over the world.
p169
aVLook, you have bubbles all over the world here.
p170
aVBrazil has many HIV-infected.
p171
aVArab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.
p172
aVThey have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran.
p173
aVIndia has many because they are many.
p174
aVSoutheast Asia, and so on.
p175
aVBut, there is one part of Africa \u2014
p176
aVand the difficult thing is, at the same time,
p177
aVnot to make a uniform statement about Africa,
p178
aVnot to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand.
p179
aa(lp180
VOn the other hand, try to say that this is not the case,
p181
aVbecause there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now.
p182
aVUNAIDS have done good data available, finally,
p183
aVabout the spread of HIV.
p184
aVIt could be concurrency.
p185
aVIt could be some virus types.
p186
aVIt could be that there is other things
p187
aVwhich makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.
p188
aVAfter all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex,
p189
aVthe risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.
p190
aVDon't jump to conclusions now on how to
p191
aVbehave tonight and so on.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aVBut \u2014 and if you are in an unfavorable situation,
p194
aVmore sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut what we think is that it could be concurrency.
p197
aVAnd what is concurrency?
p198
aVIn Sweden, we have no concurrency.
p199
aVWe have serial monogamy.
p200
aVVodka, New Year's Eve \u2014 new partner for the spring.
p201
aVVodka, Midsummer's Eve \u2014 new partner for the fall.
p202
aVVodka \u2014 and it goes on like this, you know?
p203
aVAnd you collect a big number of exes.
p204
aVAnd we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic \u2014
p205
aVterrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years.
p206
aVHIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection
p207
aVand therefore, having more than one partner in the same month
p208
aVis much more dangerous for HIV than others.
p209
aVProbably, it's a combination of this.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd what makes me so happy is that we are moving now
p212
aVtowards fact when we look at this.
p213
aVYou can get this chart, free.
p214
aVWe have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.
p215
aVAnd we hope that when we act on global problems in the future
p216
aVwe will not only have the heart,
p217
aVwe will not only have the money,
p218
aVbut we will also use the brain.
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you very much.

A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />As if all this weren&#39;t enough, the irrepressible Rosling is also an accomplished sword-swallower &mdash; a skill he demonstrated at TED2007.<br /><br /><br /> </p>", "slug": "hans_rosling", "whotheyare": "In Hans Rosling\\u2019s hands, data sings.

"middleinitial": "", "whylisten": "<p>Even the most worldly and well-traveled among us will have their perspectives shifted by Hans Rosling. A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />As if all this weren&#39;t enough, the irrepressible Rosling is also an accomplished sword-swallower &mdash; a skill he demonstrated at TED2007.<br /><br /><br /> </p>", "slug": "hans_rosling", "whotheyare": "In Hans Rosling\\u2019s hands, data sings.

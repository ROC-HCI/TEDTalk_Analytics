VG'day, my name's Kevin.
p5
aVI'm from Australia. I'm here to help.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VTonight, I want to talk about a tale of two cities.
p9
aVOne of those cities is called Washington, and the other is called Beijing.
p10
aVBecause how these two capitals shape their future
p11
aVand the future of the United States and the future of China
p12
aVdoesn't just affect those two countries,
p13
aVit affects all of us
p14
aVin ways, perhaps, we've never thought of:
p15
aVthe air we breathe, the water we drink,
p16
aVthe fish we eat, the quality of our oceans,
p17
aVthe languages we speak in the future,
p18
aVthe jobs we have, the political systems we choose,
p19
aVand, of course, the great questions of war and peace.
p20
aa(lp21
VYou see that bloke? He's French.
p22
aVHis name is Napoleon.
p23
aVA couple of hundred years ago,
p24
aVhe made this extraordinary projection:
p25
aV"China is a sleeping lion, and when she awakes,
p26
aVthe world will shake."
p27
aVNapoleon got a few things wrong;
p28
aVhe got this one absolutely right.
p29
aVBecause China is today not just woken up,
p30
aVChina has stood up and China is on the march,
p31
aVand the question for us all
p32
aVis where will China go
p33
aVand how do we engage this giant of the 21st century?
p34
aa(lp35
VYou start looking at the numbers, they start to confront you in a big way.
p36
aVIt's projected that China will become,
p37
aVby whichever measure \u2014 PPP, market exchange rates \u2014
p38
aVthe largest economy in the world
p39
aVover the course of the decade ahead.
p40
aVThey're already the largest trading nation,
p41
aValready the largest exporting nation,
p42
aValready the largest manufacturing nation,
p43
aVand they're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world.
p44
aVAmerica comes second.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo if China does become the world's largest economy,
p47
aVthink about this:
p48
aVIt'll be the first time
p49
aVsince this guy was on the throne of England \u2014
p50
aVGeorge III, not a good friend of Napoleon's \u2014
p51
aVthat in the world we will have as the largest economy
p52
aVa non-English speaking country,
p53
aVa non-Western country,
p54
aVa non-liberal democratic country.
p55
aVAnd if you don't think that's going to affect
p56
aVthe way in which the world happens in the future,
p57
aVthen personally, I think you've been smoking something,
p58
aVand it doesn't mean you're from Colorado.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo in short, the question we have tonight is,
p61
aVhow do we understand this mega-change,
p62
aVwhich I believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the 21st century?
p63
aVIt'll affect so many things.
p64
aVIt will go to the absolute core.
p65
aVIt's happening quietly. It's happening persistently.
p66
aVIt's happening in some senses under the radar,
p67
aVas we are all preoccupied with
p68
aVwhat's going in Ukraine, what's going on in the Middle East,
p69
aVwhat's going on with ISIS, what's going on with ISIL,
p70
aVwhat's happening with the future of our economies.
p71
aVThis is a slow and quiet revolution.
p72
aVAnd with a mega-change comes also a mega-challenge,
p73
aVand the mega-challenge is this:
p74
aVCan these two great countries,
p75
aVChina and the United States \u2014
p76
aVChina,
p77
aVthe Middle Kingdom,
p78
aVand the United States,
p79
aVM\u011biguó \u2014
p80
aVwhich in Chinese, by the way, means "the beautiful country."
p81
aVThink about that \u2014 that's the name that China has given this country
p82
aVfor more than a hundred years.
p83
aVWhether these two great civilizations, these two great countries,
p84
aVcan in fact carve out a common future
p85
aVfor themselves and for the world?
p86
aVIn short, can we carve out a future
p87
aVwhich is peaceful and mutually prosperous,
p88
aVor are we looking at a great challenge
p89
aVof war or peace?
p90
aVAnd I have 15 minutes to work through war or peace,
p91
aVwhich is a little less time
p92
aVthan they gave this guy to write a book called "War and Peace."
p93
aa(lp94
VPeople ask me, why is it that a kid growing up in rural Australia
p95
aVgot interested in learning Chinese?
p96
aVWell, there are two reasons for that.
p97
aVHere's the first of them.
p98
aVThat's Betsy the cow.
p99
aVNow, Betsy the cow was one of a herd of dairy cattle
p100
aVthat I grew up with on a farm in rural Australia.
p101
aVSee those hands there? These are not built for farming.
p102
aVSo very early on, I discovered that in fact, working in a farm
p103
aVwas not designed for me, and China was a very safe remove
p104
aVfrom any career in Australian farm life.
p105
aa(lp106
VHere's the second reason.
p107
aVThat's my mom.
p108
aVAnyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do?
p109
aVEveryone ever do what their mom told them to do?
p110
aVI rarely did,
p111
aVbut what my mom said to me was,
p112
aVone day, she handed me a newspaper,
p113
aVa headline which said, here we have a huge change.
p114
aVAnd that change is China entering the United Nations.
p115
aV1971, I had just turned 14 years of age,
p116
aVand she handed me this headline.
p117
aVAnd she said, "Understand this,  learn this,
p118
aVbecause it's going to affect your future."
p119
aa(lp120
VSo being a very good student of history,
p121
aVI decided that the best thing for me to do was, in fact,
p122
aVto go off and learn Chinese.
p123
aVThe great thing about learning Chinese
p124
aVis that your Chinese teacher gives you a new name.
p125
aVAnd so they gave me this name:
p126
aVKè, which means to overcome or to conquer,
p127
aVand Wén, and that's the character for literature or the arts.
p128
aVKè Wén, Conqueror of the Classics.
p129
aVAny of you guys called "Kevin"?
p130
aVIt's a major lift from being called Kevin to be called Conqueror of the Classics.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVI've been called Kevin all my life.
p133
aVHave you been called Kevin all your life?
p134
aVWould you prefer to be called Conqueror of the Classics?
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd so I went off after that and joined the Australian Foreign Service,
p137
aVbut here is where pride \u2014 before pride, there always comes a fall.
p138
aVSo there I am in the embassy in Beijing,
p139
aVoff to the Great Hall of the People
p140
aVwith our ambassador, who had asked me to interpret for his first meeting
p141
aVin the Great Hall of the People.
p142
aVAnd so there was I.
p143
aVIf you've been to a Chinese meeting, it's a giant horseshoe.
p144
aVAt the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh-bahs,
p145
aVand down the end of the horseshoe are the not-so-serious pooh-bahs,
p146
aVthe junior woodchucks like me.
p147
aVAnd so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase.
p148
aVHe said, "China and Australia are currently enjoying a relationship
p149
aVof unprecedented closeness."
p150
aVAnd I thought to myself,
p151
aV"That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd.
p152
aVI will improve it."
p153
aVNote to file: Never do that.
p154
aVIt needed to be a little more elegant, a little more classical,
p155
aVso I rendered it as follows.
p156
aV[In Chinese]
p157
aa(lp158
VThere was a big pause on the other side of the room.
p159
aVYou could see the giant pooh-bahs at the head of the horseshoe,
p160
aVthe blood visibly draining from their faces,
p161
aVand the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe
p162
aVengaged in peals of  unrestrained laughter.
p163
aVBecause when I rendered his sentence,
p164
aV"Australia and China are  enjoying a relationship
p165
aVof unprecedented closeness,"
p166
aVin fact, what I said was that Australia and China
p167
aVwere now experiencing fantastic orgasm.
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VThat was the last time I was asked to interpret.
p171
aVBut in that little story, there's a wisdom, which is,
p172
aVas soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization
p173
aVof 5,000 years of continuing history,
p174
aVthere's always something new to learn.
p175
aa(lp176
VHistory is against us
p177
aVwhen it comes to the U.S. and China
p178
aVforging a common future together.
p179
aVThis guy up here?
p180
aVHe's not Chinese and he's not American.
p181
aVHe's Greek. His name's Thucydides.
p182
aVHe wrote the history of the Peloponnesian Wars.
p183
aVAnd he made this extraordinary observation
p184
aVabout Athens and Sparta.
p185
aV"It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta
p186
aVthat made war inevitable."
p187
aVAnd hence, a whole literature about something called the Thucydides Trap.
p188
aa(lp189
VThis guy here? He's not American and he's not Greek. He's Chinese.
p190
aVHis name is Sun Tzu. He wrote "The Art of War,"
p191
aVand if you see his statement underneath, it's along these lines:
p192
aV"Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected."
p193
aVNot looking good so far for China and the United States.
p194
aa(lp195
VThis guy is an American. His name's Graham Allison.
p196
aVIn fact, he's a teacher at the Kennedy School
p197
aVover there in Boston.
p198
aVHe's working on a single project at the moment, which is,
p199
aVdoes the Thucydides Trap about the inevitably of war
p200
aVbetween rising powers and established great powers
p201
aVapply to the future of China-U.S. relations?
p202
aVIt's a core question.
p203
aVAnd what Graham has done is explore 15 cases in history
p204
aVsince the 1500s
p205
aVto establish what the precedents are.
p206
aVAnd in 11 out of 15 of them,
p207
aVlet me tell you,
p208
aVthey've ended in catastrophic war.
p209
aa(lp210
VYou may say, "But Kevin \u2014
p211
aVor Conqueror of the Classics \u2014
p212
aVthat was the past.
p213
aVWe live now in a world of interdependence and globalization.
p214
aVIt could never happen again."
p215
aVGuess what?
p216
aVThe economic historians tell us that in fact,
p217
aVthe time which we reached the greatest point
p218
aVof economic integration and globalization
p219
aVwas in 1914,
p220
aVjust before that happened, World War I,
p221
aVa sobering reflection from history.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo if we are engaged in this great question
p224
aVof how China thinks, feels,
p225
aVand positions itself towards the United States,
p226
aVand the reverse,
p227
aVhow do we get to the baseline
p228
aVof how these two countries and civilizations
p229
aVcan possibly work together?
p230
aa(lp231
VLet me first go to, in fact,
p232
aVChina's views of the U.S. and the rest of the West.
p233
aVNumber one: China feels as if it's been humiliated
p234
aVat the hands of the West through a hundred years of history,
p235
aVbeginning with the Opium Wars.
p236
aVWhen after that, the Western powers carved China up into little pieces,
p237
aVso that by the time it got to the '20s and '30s,
p238
aVsigns like this one appeared on the streets of Shanghai.
p239
aV["No dogs and Chinese allowed"]
p240
aVHow would you feel if you were Chinese,
p241
aVin your own country,  if you saw that sign appear?
p242
aVChina also believes and feels
p243
aVas if, in the events of 1919, at the Peace Conference in Paris,
p244
aVwhen Germany's colonies were given back
p245
aVto all sorts of countries around in the world,
p246
aVwhat about German colonies in China?
p247
aVThey were, in fact, given to Japan.
p248
aVWhen Japan then invaded China in the 1930s
p249
aVthe world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China.
p250
aVAnd then, on top of that, the Chinese to this day believe
p251
aVthat the United States and the West
p252
aVdo not accept the legitimacy of their political system
p253
aVbecause it's so radically different from those of us who come
p254
aVfrom liberal democracies,
p255
aVand believe that the United States to this day is seeking
p256
aVto undermine their political system.
p257
aVChina also believes that it is being contained
p258
aVby U.S. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the U.S.
p259
aVright around its periphery.
p260
aVAnd beyond all that, the Chinese have this feeling
p261
aVin their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts
p262
aVthat those of us in the collective West
p263
aVare just too damned arrogant.
p264
aVThat is, we don't recognize the problems in our own system,
p265
aVin our politics and our economics,
p266
aVand are very quick to point the finger elsewhere,
p267
aVand believe that, in fact, we in the collective West
p268
aVare guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy.
p269
aa(lp270
VOf course, in international relations,
p271
aVit's not just the sound of one hand clapping.
p272
aVThere's another country too, and that's called the U.S.
p273
aVSo how does the U.S. respond to all of the above?
p274
aVThe U.S. has a response to each of those.
p275
aVOn the question of is the U.S. containing China,
p276
aVthey say, "No, look at the history of the Soviet Union. That was containment."
p277
aVInstead, what we have done in the U.S. and the West
p278
aVis welcome China into the global economy,
p279
aVand on top of that, welcome them into the World Trade Organization.
p280
aVThe U.S. and the West say China cheats
p281
aVon the question of intellectual property rights,
p282
aVand through cyberattacks on U.S. and global firms.
p283
aVFurthermore, the United States says that the Chinese political system
p284
aVis fundamentally wrong
p285
aVbecause it's at such fundamental variance
p286
aVto the human rights, democracy, and rule of law that we enjoy
p287
aVin the U.S. and the collective West.
p288
aVAnd on top of all the above, what does the United States say?
p289
aVThat they fear that China will, when it has sufficient power,
p290
aVestablish a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia,
p291
aVboot the United States out,
p292
aVand in time, when it's powerful enough,
p293
aVunilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo apart from all of that, it's just fine and dandy,
p296
aVthe U.S.-China relationship.
p297
aVNo real problems there.
p298
aVThe challenge, though, is given those deep-rooted feelings,
p299
aVthose deep-rooted emotions and thought patterns,
p300
aVwhat the Chinese call "S\u012bwéi," ways of thinking,
p301
aVhow can we craft a basis for a common future between these two?
p302
aa(lp303
VI argue simply this:
p304
aVWe can do it on the basis on a framework
p305
aVof constructive realism for a common purpose.
p306
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p307
aVBe realistic about the things that we disagree on,
p308
aVand a management approach that doesn't enable
p309
aVany one of those differences to break into war or conflict
p310
aVuntil we've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them.
p311
aVBe constructive in areas of the bilateral, regional and global engagement
p312
aVbetween the two,
p313
aVwhich will make a difference for all of humankind.
p314
aVBuild a regional institution capable of cooperation in Asia,
p315
aVan Asia-Pacific community.
p316
aVAnd worldwide, act further,
p317
aVlike you've begun to do at the end of last year
p318
aVby striking out against climate change
p319
aVwith hands joined together rather than fists apart.
p320
aa(lp321
VOf course, all that happens if you've got a common mechanism
p322
aVand political will to achieve the above.
p323
aVThese things are deliverable.
p324
aVBut the question is, are they deliverable alone?
p325
aVThis is what our head tells us we need to do,
p326
aVbut what about our heart?
p327
aa(lp328
VI have a little experience in the question back home
p329
aVof how you try to bring together two peoples
p330
aVwho, frankly, haven't had a whole lot in common in the past.
p331
aVAnd that's when I apologized to Australia's indigenous peoples.
p332
aVThis was a day of reckoning in the Australian government,
p333
aVthe Australian parliament, and for the Australian people.
p334
aVAfter 200 years of unbridled abuse towards the first Australians,
p335
aVit was high time that we white folks said we were sorry.
p336
aa(lp337
VThe important thing \u2014
p338
aV(Applause)
p339
aa(lp340
VThe important thing that I remember is staring in the faces
p341
aVof all those from Aboriginal Australia
p342
aVas they came to listen to this apology.
p343
aVIt was extraordinary to see, for example,
p344
aVold women telling me the stories of when they were five years old
p345
aVand literally ripped away from their parents,
p346
aVlike this lady here.
p347
aVIt was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace
p348
aVand to kiss Aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building,
p349
aVand one woman said to me,
p350
aVit's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life,
p351
aVand she was over 70.
p352
aVThat's a terrible story.
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd then I remember this family saying to me,
p355
aV"You know, we drove all the way from the far North down to Canberra
p356
aVto come to this thing,
p357
aVdrove our way through redneck country.
p358
aVOn the way back, stopped at a cafe after the apology for a milkshake."
p359
aVAnd they walked into this cafe quietly, tentatively, gingerly,
p360
aVa little anxious.
p361
aVI think you know what I'm talking about.
p362
aVBut the day after the apology, what happened?
p363
aVEveryone in that cafe, every one of the white folks,
p364
aVstood up and applauded.
p365
aVSomething had happened in the hearts of these people in Australia.
p366
aVThe white folks, our Aboriginal brothers and sisters,
p367
aVand we haven't solved all these problems together,
p368
aVbut let me tell you, there was a new beginning
p369
aVbecause we had gone not just to the head,
p370
aVwe'd gone also to the heart.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo where does that conclude in terms of the great question
p373
aVthat we've been asked to address this evening,
p374
aVwhich is the future of U.S.-China relations?
p375
aVThe head says there's a way forward.
p376
aVThe head says there is a policy framework, there's a common narrative,
p377
aVthere's a mechanism through regular summitry
p378
aVto do these things and to make them better.
p379
aVBut the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities
p380
aVof the America-China relationship,
p381
aVand the possibilities of China's future engagement in the world.
p382
aVSometimes, folks, we just need to take a leap of faith
p383
aVnot quite knowing where we might land.
p384
aa(lp385
VIn China, they now talk about the Chinese Dream.
p386
aVIn America, we're all familiar with the term "the American Dream."
p387
aVI think it's time, across the world,
p388
aVthat we're able to think also of something we might also call
p389
aVa dream for all humankind.
p390
aVBecause if we do that,
p391
aVwe might just change the way
p392
aVthat we think about each other.
p393
aa(lp394
V[In Chinese]
p395
aa(lp396
VThat's my challenge to America. That's my challenge to China.
p397
aVThat's my challenge to all of us,
p398
aVbut I think where there's a will and where there is imagination
p399
aVwe can turn this into a future
p400
aVdriven by peace and prosperity
p401
aVand not once again repeat
p402
aVthe tragedies of war.
p403
aa(lp404
VI thank you.
p405
aa(lp406
V(Applause)
p407
aa(lp408
VChris Anderson: Thanks so much for that. Thanks so much for that.
p409
aVIt feels like you yourself have a role to play in this bridging.
p410
aVYou, in a way, are uniquely placed to speak to both sides.
p411
aa(lp412
VKevin Rudd: Well, what we Australians do best is organize the drinks,
p413
aVso you get them together in one room, and we suggest this and suggest that,
p414
aVthen we go and get the drinks.
p415
aVBut no, look, for all of us who are friends
p416
aVof these two great countries, America and China,
p417
aVyou can do something.
p418
aVYou can make a practical contribution,
p419
aVand for all you good folks here,
p420
aVnext time you meet someone from China,
p421
aVsit down and have a conversation.
p422
aVSee what you can find out about where they come from and what they think,
p423
aVand my challenge for all the Chinese folks
p424
aVwho are going to watch this TED Talk at some time
p425
aVis do the same.
p426
aVTwo of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference.
p427
aVThose of us up the middle, we can make a small contribution.
p428
aa(lp429
VCA: Kevin, all power to you, my friend. Thank you.
p430
aa(lp431
VKR: Thank you. Thank you, folks.

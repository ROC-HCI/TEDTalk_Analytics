VI'll never forget the sound
p5
aVof laughing with my friends.
p6
aVI'll never forget the sound
p7
aVof my mother's voice right before I fell asleep.
p8
aVAnd I'll never forget the comforting sound of water
p9
aVtrickling down a stream.
p10
aVImagine my fear, pure fear,
p11
aVwhen, at the age of 10,
p12
aVI was told I was going to lose my hearing.
p13
aVAnd over the next five years,
p14
aVit progressed until I was classified as profoundly deaf.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut I believe that losing my hearing
p17
aVwas one of the greatest gifts I've ever received.
p18
aVYou see, I get to experience the world in a unique way.
p19
aVAnd I believe that these unique experiences
p20
aVthat people with disabilities have
p21
aVis what's going to help us make and design a better world
p22
aVfor everyone \u2014 both for people with and without disabilities.
p23
aa(lp24
VI used to be a disability rights lawyer,
p25
aVand I spent a lot of my time focused on enforcing the law,
p26
aVensuring that accommodations were made.
p27
aVAnd then I had to quickly learn international policy,
p28
aVbecause I was asked to work on the UN Convention
p29
aVthat protects people with disabilities.
p30
aVAs the leader of the NGO there,
p31
aVI spent most of my energy trying to convince people
p32
aVabout the capabilities of people with disabilities.
p33
aVBut somewhere along the way,
p34
aVand after many career transitions
p35
aVthat my parents weren't so happy about \u2014
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VI stumbled upon a solution
p40
aVthat I believe may be an even more powerful tool
p41
aVto solve some of the world's greatest problems,
p42
aVdisability or not.
p43
aVAnd that tool is called design thinking.
p44
aa(lp45
VDesign thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving.
p46
aVThere are five steps.
p47
aVThe first is defining the problem
p48
aVand understanding its constraints.
p49
aVThe second is observing people in real-life situations
p50
aVand empathizing with them.
p51
aVThird, throwing out hundreds of ideas \u2014 the more the better,
p52
aVthe wilder the better.
p53
aVFourth, prototyping: gathering whatever you can,
p54
aVwhatever you can find,
p55
aVto mimic your solution, to test it
p56
aVand to refine it.
p57
aVAnd finally, implementation:
p58
aVensuring that the solution you came up with is sustainable.
p59
aa(lp60
VWarren Berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways,
p61
aVto reframe, to refine, to experiment
p62
aVand, probably most importantly,
p63
aVask those stupid questions.
p64
aVDesign thinkers believe that everyone is creative.
p65
aVThey believe in bringing people from multiple disciplines together,
p66
aVbecause they want to share multiple perspectives
p67
aVand bring them together and ultimately merge them
p68
aVto form something new.
p69
aa(lp70
VDesign thinking is such a successful and versatile tool
p71
aVthat it has been applied in almost every industry.
p72
aVI saw the potential that it had for the issues I faced,
p73
aVso I decided to go back to school
p74
aVand get my master's in social design.
p75
aVThis looks at how to use design to create positive change in the world.
p76
aVWhile I was there,
p77
aVI fell in love with woodworking.
p78
aVBut what I quickly realized
p79
aVwas that I was missing out on something.
p80
aVAs you're working with a tool,
p81
aVright before it's about to kick back at you \u2014
p82
aVwhich means the piece or the tool jumps back at you \u2014
p83
aVit makes a sound.
p84
aVAnd I couldn't hear this sound.
p85
aVSo I decided,
p86
aVwhy not try and solve it?
p87
aVMy solution was a pair of safety glasses
p88
aVthat were engineered to visually alert the user
p89
aVto pitch changes in the tool,
p90
aVbefore the human ear could pick it up.
p91
aVWhy hadn't tool designers thought of this before?
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VTwo reasons: one, I was a beginner.
p96
aVI wasn't weighed down by expertise or conventional wisdom.
p97
aVThe second is: I was Deaf.
p98
aVMy unique experience of the world helped inform my solution.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd as I went on, I kept running into more and more solutions
p101
aVthat were originally made for people with disabilities,
p102
aVand that ended up being picked up,
p103
aVembraced and loved by the mainstream,
p104
aVdisability or not.
p105
aVThis is an OXO potato peeler.
p106
aVIt was originally designed for people with arthritis,
p107
aVbut it was so comfortable, everybody loved it.
p108
aVText messaging: that was originally designed for people who are Deaf.
p109
aVAnd as you know, everybody loves that, too.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VI started thinking:
p114
aVWhat if we changed our mindset?
p115
aVWhat if we started designing for disability first \u2014
p116
aVnot the norm?
p117
aVAs you see, when we design for disability first,
p118
aVwe often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive,
p119
aVbut also are often better than when we design for the norm.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd this excites me,
p122
aVbecause this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone
p123
aVwith a disability
p124
aVcan be leveraged, molded and played with
p125
aVas a force for creativity and innovation.
p126
aVThis moves us from the mindset of trying to change the hearts
p127
aVand the deficiency mindset of tolerance,
p128
aVto becoming an alchemist,
p129
aVthe type of magician that this world so desperately needs
p130
aVto solve some of its greatest problems.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, I also believe
p133
aVthat people with disabilities have great potential to be designers
p134
aVwithin this design-thinking process.
p135
aVWithout knowing it, from a very early age,
p136
aVI've been a design thinker, fine-tuning my skills.
p137
aVDesign thinkers are, by nature, problem solvers.
p138
aVSo imagine listening to a conversation
p139
aVand only understanding 50 percent of what is said.
p140
aVYou can't ask them to repeat every single word.
p141
aVThey would just get frustrated with you.
p142
aVSo without even realizing it,
p143
aVmy solution was to take the muffled sound I heard,
p144
aVthat was the beat,
p145
aVand turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips I read.
p146
aVYears later, someone commented that my writing had a rhythm to it.
p147
aVWell, this is because I experience conversations as rhythms.
p148
aVI also became really, really good at failing.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VQuite literally.
p153
aVMy first semester in Spanish, I got a D.
p154
aVBut what I learned was that when I picked myself up
p155
aVand changed a few things around,
p156
aVeventually, I succeeded.
p157
aVSimilarly, design thinking encourages people to fail
p158
aVand fail often,
p159
aVbecause eventually, you will succeed.
p160
aVVery few great innovations in this world
p161
aVhave come from someone succeeding on the first try.
p162
aa(lp163
VI also experienced this lesson in sports.
p164
aVI'll never forget my coach saying to my mom,
p165
aV"If she just didn't have her hearing loss,
p166
aVshe would be on the national team."
p167
aVBut what my coach, and what I didn't even know at the time,
p168
aVwas that my hearing loss actually helped me excel at sports.
p169
aVYou see, when you lose your hearing, not only do you adapt your behavior,
p170
aVbut you also adapt your physical senses.
p171
aVOne example of this
p172
aVis that my visual attention span increased.
p173
aVImagine a soccer player, coming down the left flank.
p174
aVImagine being goalkeeper, like I was,
p175
aVand the ball is coming down the left flank.
p176
aVA person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective of this.
p177
aVI had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.
p178
aVSo I picked up the players over here,
p179
aVthat were moving about and coming down the field.
p180
aVAnd I picked them up quicker, so that if the ball was passed,
p181
aVI could reposition myself and be ready for that shot.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo as you can see,
p184
aVI've been a design thinker for nearly all my life.
p185
aVMy observation skills have been honed so that I pick up on things
p186
aVthat others would never pick up on.
p187
aVMy constant need to adapt has made me a great ideator
p188
aVand problem solver.
p189
aVAnd I've often had to do this within limitations and constraints.
p190
aVThis is something that designers also have to deal with frequently.
p191
aa(lp192
VMy work most recently took me to Haiti.
p193
aVDesign thinkers often seek out extreme situations,
p194
aVbecause that often informs some of their best designs.
p195
aVAnd Haiti \u2014 it was like a perfect storm.
p196
aa(lp197
VI lived and worked with 300 Deaf individuals
p198
aVthat were relocated after the 2010 earthquake.
p199
aVBut five and a half years later,
p200
aVthere still was no electricity;
p201
aVthere still was no safe drinking water;
p202
aVthere were still no job opportunities;
p203
aVthere was still rampant crime, and it went unpunished.
p204
aVInternational aid organizations came one by one.
p205
aVBut they came
p206
aVwith pre-determined solutions.
p207
aVThey didn't come ready to observe and to adapt
p208
aVbased on the community's needs.
p209
aVOne organization gave them goats and chickens.
p210
aVBut they didn't realize
p211
aVthat there was so much hunger in that community,
p212
aVthat when the Deaf went to sleep at night and couldn't hear,
p213
aVpeople broke into their yards and their homes
p214
aVand stole these chickens and goats,
p215
aVand eventually they were all gone.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow, if that organization had taken the time
p218
aVto observe Deaf people, to observe the community,
p219
aVthey would have realized their problem
p220
aVand perhaps they would have come up with a solution,
p221
aVsomething like a solar light,
p222
aVlighting up a secure pen to put them in at night
p223
aVto ensure their safety.
p224
aa(lp225
VYou don't have to be a design thinker
p226
aVto insert the ideas I've shared with you today.
p227
aVYou are creative.
p228
aVYou are a designer \u2014
p229
aVeveryone is.
p230
aVLet people like me help you.
p231
aVLet people with disabilities help you look sideways,
p232
aVand in the process,
p233
aVsolve some of the greatest problems.
p234
aa(lp235
VThat's it. Thank you.

In the classroom, she learned how to teach herself from books. At Brown University, Roy was recognized as one of the nation&#39;s elite soccer goalkeepers. She also began to see herself as an advocate for people with non-normative abilities. During her freshman year, the University tried to take away real time captioning, a cross between closed captions that you see on television and a courtroom stenographer, enabling her to hear and participate in the classroom&nbsp;for the first time. After organizing the other Deaf students at the University and meeting with several deans, Roy was able to secure the real time captioning for the remainder of her time at Brown.</div><div><br /></div><div>Following Brown, Roy turned down an invitation to play professional soccer and instead opted for law school at Northeastern University. While in law school, Roy became actively involved in gay and lesbian rights, acting as a fellow for the human rights campaign in Washington D.C. Upon graduation, Roy received the highly prestigious Georgetown University Women&#39;s Law and Public Policy Fellowship, with alumni and board members that included Supreme Court Justice Ruth Ginsburg as well as D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton.</div><div><br /></div><div>Roy was in law school when she began working on the International Disability Rights Treaty at the United Nations, the first such human rights treaty to be passed in the 21st century. She quickly found herself thrust from a mere observer to the leader of her Article on culture, sport, recreation and leisure. The treaty, the first human rights treaty at the United Nations to be passed in the 21st century, was ratified in 2007. Over 155 countries have become signatories. After the treaty was signed in 2007, she traveled the world to see it put into action. Her work took her to Southeast Asia and the Gulf region as well as Africa.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Roy&#39;s deafness has always given her a heightened awareness of how profoundly design shapes the social, emotional and physical environment and this led her to study human-centered design in Maryland Institute College of Art&#39;s (MICA) Social Design program. Premised on the foundational notion that complex social problems require creative problem solving through design, she completed a master&#39;s degree with a thesis that investigated the barriers that exist for individuals with hearing loss in the fabrication technology and design realm. She researched various tools to identify possible adaptations for the Deaf user based on the auditory information emitted.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Roy promotes design thinking as fundamental to progressive social change and is a passionate proponent of applying social impact and human-centered design research to international aid and development work.</div>", "slug": "elise_roy", "whotheyare": "Elise Roy thinks that designers have the capacity and responsibility to address and resolve human problems on micro and macro scales and contribute to social well-being.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 2999, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/7da2f739354008ba2caf154abd2feb7061907121_254x191.jpg"}], "current_talk": 2529, "description": "\\"I believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gifts I\'ve ever received,\\" says Elise Roy.

ten, Elise Roy has been a design thinker from early on, constantly adapting her environment and its tools to serve her extraordinary abilities. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>A Division I athlete in both soccer and lacrosse, Roy participated in the Olympic Development Program for soccer. In the classroom, she learned how to teach herself from books. At Brown University, Roy was recognized as one of the nation&#39;s elite soccer goalkeepers. She also began to see herself as an advocate for people with non-normative abilities. During her freshman year, the University tried to take away real time captioning, a cross between closed captions that you see on television and a courtroom stenographer, enabling her to hear and participate in the classroom&nbsp;for the first time. After organizing the other Deaf students at the University and meeting with several deans, Roy was able to secure the real time captioning for the remainder of her time at Brown.</div><div><br /></div><div>Following Brown, Roy turned down an invitation to play professional soccer and instead opted for law school at Northeastern University. While in law school, Roy became actively involved in gay and lesbian rights, acting as a fellow for the human rights campaign in Washington D.C. Upon graduation, Roy received the highly prestigious Georgetown University Women&#39;s Law and Public Policy Fellowship, with alumni and board members that included Supreme Court Justice Ruth Ginsburg as well as D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton.</div><div><br /></div><div>Roy was in law school when she began working on the International Disability Rights Treaty at the United Nations, the first such human rights treaty to be passed in the 21st century. She quickly found herself thrust from a mere observer to the leader of her Article on culture, sport, recreation and leisure. The treaty, the first human rights treaty at the United Nations to be passed in the 21st century, was ratified in 2007. Over 155 countries have become signatories. After the treaty was signed in 2007, she traveled the world to see it put into action. Her work took her to Southeast Asia and the Gulf region as well as Africa.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Roy&#39;s deafness has always given her a heightened awareness of how profoundly design shapes the social, emotional and physical environment and this led her to study human-centered design in Maryland Institute College of Art&#39;s (MICA) Social Design program. Premised on the foundational notion that complex social problems require creative problem solving through design, she completed a master&#39;s degree with a thesis that investigated the barriers that exist for individuals with hearing loss in the fabrication technology and design realm. She researched various tools to identify possible adaptations for the Deaf user based on the auditory information emitted.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Roy promotes design thinking as fundamental to progressive social change and is a passionate proponent of applying social impact and human-centered design research to international aid and development work.</div>", "slug": "elise_roy", "whotheyare": "Elise Roy thinks that designers have the capacity and responsibility to address and resolve human problems on micro and macro scales and contribute to social well-being.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 2999, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/7da2f739354008ba2caf154abd2feb7061907121_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "When we design for disability, we all benefit", "take_action": [], "comments": 27147, "more_resources": [], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/b6624ec23929c5b14130f25b093d63cbf1a87d2d_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "\\"I believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gifts I\'ve ever received,\\" says Elise Roy.

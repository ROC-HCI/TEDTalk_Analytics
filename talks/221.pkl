VI'm a historian.
p5
aVSteve told us about the future of little technology;
p6
aVI'm going to show you some of the past of big technology.
p7
aVThis was a project to build a 4,000-ton nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship
p8
aVand go to Saturn and Jupiter.
p9
aVThis took place in my childhood, 1957-65.
p10
aVIt was deeply classified.
p11
aVI'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified,
p12
aVbut has now been reclassified.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VIf all goes well, next year I'll be back,
p17
aVand I'll have a lot more to show you, and if all doesn't go well,
p18
aVI'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, this ship was basically the size of the Marriott Hotel,
p23
aVa little taller and a little bigger.
p24
aVAnd one of the people who worked on it at the beginning
p25
aVwas my father, Freeman, there in the middle.
p26
aVThat's me and my sister, Esther, who's a frequent TEDster.
p27
aVI didn't like nuclear bomb-propelled spaceships.
p28
aVI mean, I thought it was a great idea, but I started building kayaks.
p29
aVSo we had a few kayaks.
p30
aVJust so you know that I am not Dr. Strangelove.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut all the time I was out there doing these strange kayak voyages
p33
aVin odd, beautiful parts of this planet,
p34
aVI always thought in the back of my mind about Project Orion,
p35
aVand how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships.
p36
aVThey were actually going to go \u2014
p37
aVTed Taylor, who led the project, was going to take his children.
p38
aVMy father was not going to take his children,
p39
aVthat was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VThe project began in '57 at General Atomics there,
p44
aVthat's right on the coast at La Jolla.
p45
aVLook at that central building right in the middle of the picture.
p46
aVThat's the 130-foot diameter library.
p47
aVThat is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship.
p48
aVSo put that library at the bottom of that ship \u2014
p49
aVthat's how big the thing was going to be.
p50
aVIt would take two or three thousand bombs.
p51
aVThe people who worked on it were a lot of the Los Alamos people
p52
aVwho had done the hydrogen bomb work.
p53
aVIt was the first project funded by ARPA.
p54
aVThat's the contract where ARPA gave the first million dollars
p55
aVto get this thing started.
p56
aV"Spaceship project officially begun. Job waiting for you. Dyson."
p57
aVThat's July '58.
p58
aVTwo days later, the space traveler's manifesto explaining why \u2014
p59
aVjust like we heard yesterday \u2014 why we need to go into space:
p60
aV"... trips to satellites of the outer planets.
p61
aVAugust 20, 1958."
p62
aa(lp63
VThese are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop.
p64
aVSome of the sizes of the ships,
p65
aVranging all the way up to ship mass of 8 million tons.
p66
aVSo that was the outer extreme.
p67
aVHere was version two: 2,000 bombs.
p68
aVThese are five-kiloton yield bombs, about the size of small Volkswagens;
p69
aVit would take 800 to get into orbit.
p70
aVHere we see a 10,000-ton ship will deliver 1,300 tons
p71
aVto Saturn and back \u2014 essentially, a five-year trip.
p72
aVPossible departure dates: October 1960 to February 1967.
p73
aVThese are trajectories going to Mars.
p74
aVAll this was done by hand, with slide rules.
p75
aVThe little Orion ship,
p76
aVand what it would take to do what Orion does with chemicals:
p77
aVyou have a ship the size of the Empire State Building.
p78
aa(lp79
VNASA had no interest; they tried to kill the project.
p80
aVThe people who supported it were the Air Force,
p81
aVwhich meant that it was all secret.
p82
aVAnd that's why when you get something declassified, that's what it looks like.
p83
aVMilitary weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs
p84
aVthat could destroy half the planet.
p85
aVThere's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.
p86
aVThis is the really secret stuff:
p87
aVhow to get directed energy explosions.
p88
aVSo you're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion \u2014
p89
aVnot like just a stick of dynamite, but you're directing it at the ship.
p90
aVAnd this is still a very active subject.
p91
aVIt's quite dangerous,
p92
aVbut I believe it's better to have dangerous things in the open
p93
aVthan think you're going to keep them secret.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis is what happened at 600 microseconds.
p96
aVThe Air Force started to build smaller models
p97
aVand actually started doing this.
p98
aVThe guys in La Jolla said, "We've got to get started now."
p99
aVThey built a high-explosive propelled model.
p100
aVThese are stills from film footage that was saved
p101
aVby someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn't,
p102
aVand kept it in their basement for the last 40 years.
p103
aVSo, these are three-pound charges of C4;
p104
aVthat's about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VThis is Ed Day putting \u2014
p109
aVSo each of these coffee cans has three pounds of C4 in it.
p110
aVThey're building a system that ejects these at quarter-second intervals.
p111
aVThat's my dad in the sport coat there, holding the briefcase.
p112
aVSo, they had a lot of fun doing this.
p113
aVBut no children were allowed;
p114
aVmy dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to Saturn,
p115
aVbut he could not say anything more about it.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo all my life I have wanted to find this stuff out,
p118
aVand spent the last four years tracking these old guys down.
p119
aVThese are stills from the video.
p120
aVJeff Bezos kindly, yesterday, said he'll put this video up
p121
aVon the Amazon site \u2014 some little clip of it.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Applause)
p124
aa(lp125
VSo, thanks to him.
p126
aVThey got quite serious about the engineering of this.
p127
aVThe size of that mass, for us,
p128
aVis really large technology in a way we're never going to go back to.
p129
aVIf you saw the 1959 \u2014
p130
aVthis is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment;
p131
aVthat's acceleration profile.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd pulse-system yield: we're looking at 20-kiloton yield
p136
aVfor an effective thrust of 10 million newtons.
p137
aVWell, here we have a little problem, the radiation doses at the crew station:
p138
aV700 rads per shot.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VFission yields during development:
p143
aVthey were hoping to get clean bombs; they didn't.
p144
aVEyeburn: this is what happens to the people in Miami who are looking up.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VPersonnel compartment noise: that's not too bad; it's very low frequencies,
p149
aVit's basically like these sub-woofers.
p150
aVAnd now we have ground-hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad.
p151
aVFinally, at the very end in 1964, NASA steps in and says,
p152
aV"OK, we'll support a feasibility study for a small version
p153
aVthat could be launched with Saturn Vs in sections and pieced together."
p154
aa(lp155
VSo this is what NASA did,
p156
aVgetting an eight-man version that would go to Mars.
p157
aVThey liked it because the guys could kind of live there and be like,
p158
aV"It's like living in a submarine."
p159
aVThis is crew compartment.
p160
aVIt switches, so what's upside down is right side up
p161
aVwhen you go to artificial gravity mode.
p162
aVThe scientists were still going to go along;
p163
aVthey would take seven astronauts and seven scientists.
p164
aVThis is a 20-man version for going to Jupiter:
p165
aVbunks, storm cellars, exercise room.
p166
aVYou know, it was going to be a nice, long trip.
p167
aa(lp168
VThe Air Force version: here we have a military version.
p169
aVThis is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified,
p170
aVjust that people managed to sneak home and after, you know,
p171
aVon their deathbed, basically, gave me that.
p172
aVThe sort of artist conceptions.
p173
aVThese are basically PowerPoint presentations
p174
aVgiven to the Air Force 40 years ago.
p175
aVLook at the little guys there outside the vehicle.
p176
aVAnd one part of NASA was interested in it,
p177
aVbut the headquarters in NASA, they killed the project.
p178
aVSo finally, at the end,
p179
aVwe can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965,
p180
aVand then all those paths came to a halt.
p181
aa(lp182
VResults: none.
p183
aVThis project is hereby terminated.
p184
aVSo that's the end.
p185
aa(lp186
VAll I can say in closing is:
p187
aVwe heard yesterday that one of the 10 bad things that could happen to us
p188
aVis an asteroid with our name on it.
p189
aVAnd one of the bad things that could happen to NASA
p190
aVis if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out,
p191
aVand everybody says,
p192
aV"Well, what are we going to do?"
p193
aVAnd Orion is really one of the only, if not the only,
p194
aVoff-the-shelf technologies that could do something.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VSo I'm going to tell you the good news and the bad news.
p199
aVThe good news is that NASA has a small, secret contingency-plan division
p200
aVthat is looking at this, trying to keep knowledge of Orion preserved
p201
aVin the event of such a misfortune.
p202
aVMaybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side.
p203
aVThat's the good news.
p204
aVThe bad news is, when I got in contact with these people
p205
aVto try and get some documents from them, they went crazy
p206
aVbecause I had all this stuff that they don't have,
p207
aVand NASA purchased 1,759 pages of this stuff from me.
p208
aVSo that's the state we're at; it's not very good.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)

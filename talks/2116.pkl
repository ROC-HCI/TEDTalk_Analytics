VI have a confession to make.
p5
aVI am addicted to adventure,
p6
aVand as a young boy,
p7
aVI would rather look outside the window
p8
aVat the birds in the trees and the sky
p9
aVthan looking at that two-dimensional
p10
aVchalky blackboard where time stands still
p11
aVand even sometimes dies.
p12
aVMy teachers thought there was something wrong
p13
aVwith me because I wasn't paying attention in class.
p14
aVThey didn't find anything  specifically wrong with me,
p15
aVother than being slightly  dyslexic because I'm a lefty.
p16
aVBut they didn't test for curiosity.
p17
aVCuriosity, to me,
p18
aVis about our connection
p19
aVwith the world, with the universe.
p20
aVIt's about seeing what's  around that next coral head
p21
aVor what's around that next tree,
p22
aVand learning more not only about our environment
p23
aVbut about ourselves.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, my dream of dreams,
p26
aVI want to go explore the oceans of Mars,
p27
aVbut until we can go there,
p28
aVI think the oceans still hold
p29
aVquite a few secrets.
p30
aVAs a matter of fact,
p31
aVif you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is
p32
aVand dissect it into a living space,
p33
aVthe ocean represents over 3.4 billion
p34
aVcubic kilometers of volume, within which
p35
aVwe've explored less than five percent.
p36
aVAnd I look at this, and I go, well,
p37
aVthere are tools to go  deeper, longer and further:
p38
aVsubmarines, ROVs, even Scuba diving.
p39
aVBut if we're going to explore the final frontier
p40
aVon this planet, we need to live there.
p41
aVWe need to build a log cabin, if you will,
p42
aVat the bottom of the sea.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd so there was a great curiosity in my soul
p45
aVwhen I went to go visit a TED [Prize winner]
p46
aVby the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle.
p47
aVMaybe you've heard of her.
p48
aVTwo years ago, she was staked out
p49
aVat the last undersea marine laboratory
p50
aVto try and save it,
p51
aVto try and petition
p52
aVfor us not to scrap it
p53
aVand bring it back on land.
p54
aVWe've only had about a dozen or so
p55
aVscientific labs at the bottom of the sea.
p56
aVThere's only one left in the world:
p57
aVit's nine miles offshore
p58
aVand 65 feet down.
p59
aVIt's called Aquarius.
p60
aVAquarius, in some fashion,
p61
aVis a dinosaur,
p62
aVan ancient robot chained to the bottom,
p63
aVthis Leviathan.
p64
aVIn other ways, it's a legacy.
p65
aVAnd so with that visit, I realized  that my time is short
p66
aVif I wanted to experience
p67
aVwhat it was like to become an aquanaut.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhen we swam towards this after many
p70
aVmoons of torture and two years of preparation,
p71
aVthis habitat waiting to invite us
p72
aVwas like a new home.
p73
aVAnd the point of going down to
p74
aVand living at this habitat was not to stay inside.
p75
aVIt wasn't about living at something the size of a school bus.
p76
aVIt was about giving us the luxury of time
p77
aVoutside to wander, to explore,
p78
aVto understand more about this oceanic final frontier.
p79
aa(lp80
VWe had megafauna come and visit us.
p81
aVThis spotted eagle ray is a fairly common sight in the oceans.
p82
aVBut why this is so important,
p83
aVwhy this picture is up,
p84
aVis because this particular animal brought his friends around,
p85
aVand instead of being the pelagic animals that they were,
p86
aVthey started getting curious about us,
p87
aVthese new strangers that were moving into the neighborhood,
p88
aVdoing things with plankton.
p89
aVWe were studying all sorts of animals and critters,
p90
aVand they got closer and closer to us,
p91
aVand because of the luxury of time,
p92
aVthese animals, these residents of the coral reef,
p93
aVwere starting to get used to us,
p94
aVand these pelagics that normal travel through stopped.
p95
aVThis particular animal actually circled
p96
aVfor 31 full days during our mission.
p97
aVSo mission 31 wasn't so much
p98
aVabout breaking records.
p99
aVIt was about that human-ocean connection.
p100
aa(lp101
VBecause of the luxury of time, we were able
p102
aVto study animals such as sharks and grouper
p103
aVin aggregations that we've never seen before.
p104
aVIt's like seeing dogs and  cats behaving well together.
p105
aVEven being able to commune with animals
p106
aVthat are much larger than us,
p107
aVsuch as this endangered goliath grouper
p108
aVwho only still resides in the Florida Keys.
p109
aVOf course, just like any neighbor,
p110
aVafter a while, if they get tired,
p111
aVthe goliath grouper barks at us,
p112
aVand this bark is so powerful
p113
aVthat it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all
p114
aVwithin a split second.
p115
aVFor us, it's just telling us to go back
p116
aVinto the habitat and leave them alone.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, this wasn't just about adventure.
p119
aVThere was actually a serious note to it.
p120
aVWe did a lot of science, and again, because of the luxury of time,
p121
aVwe were able to do over three years of science
p122
aVin 31 days.
p123
aVIn this particular case, we were using a PAM,
p124
aVor, let me just see if I can get this straight,
p125
aVa Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer.
p126
aVAnd our scientists from FIU, MIT,
p127
aVand from Northeastern
p128
aVwere able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do
p129
aVwhen we're not around.
p130
aVThe Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer, or PAM,
p131
aVgauges the fluorescence of corals
p132
aVas it pertains to pollutants in the water
p133
aVas well as climate change-related issues.
p134
aVWe used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools,
p135
aVsuch as this sonde, or what I like to call
p136
aVthe sponge proctologist, whereby the sonde
p137
aVitself tests for metabolism rates
p138
aVin what in this particular case is a barrel sponge,
p139
aVor the redwoods of the [ocean].
p140
aVAnd this gives us a much better gauge
p141
aVof what's happening underwater
p142
aVwith regard to climate change-related issues,
p143
aVand how the dynamics of that
p144
aVaffect us here on land.
p145
aVAnd finally, we looked at predator-prey behavior.
p146
aVAnd predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing,
p147
aVbecause as we take away some of the predators
p148
aVon these coral reefs around the world,
p149
aVthe prey, or the forage fish, act very differently.
p150
aVWhat we realized is
p151
aVnot only do they stop taking care of the reef,
p152
aVdarting in, grabbing a little bit of algae
p153
aVand going back into their homes,
p154
aVthey start spreading out and disappearing
p155
aVfrom those particular coral reefs.
p156
aVWell, within that 31 days,
p157
aVwe were able to generate over 10 scientific papers
p158
aVon each one of these topics.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut the point of adventure is not only to learn,
p161
aVit's to be able to share that  knowledge with the world,
p162
aVand with that, thanks to a  couple of engineers at MIT,
p163
aVwe were able to use a prototype camera called the Edgertronic
p164
aVto capture slow-motion video,
p165
aVup to 20,000 frames per second
p166
aVin a little box
p167
aVthat's worth 3,000 dollars.
p168
aVIt's available to every one of us.
p169
aVAnd that particular camera gives us an insight
p170
aVinto what fairly common animals do
p171
aVbut we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.
p172
aVLet me show you a quick video
p173
aVof what this camera does.
p174
aVYou can see the silky bubble come out
p175
aVof our hard hats.
p176
aVIt gives us an insight
p177
aVinto some of the animals that we were sitting
p178
aVright next to for 31 days
p179
aVand never normally would have paid attention to,
p180
aVsuch as hermit crabs.
p181
aVNow, using a cutting-edge piece of technology
p182
aVthat's not really meant for the oceans
p183
aVis not always easy.
p184
aVWe sometimes had to put the camera upside down,
p185
aVcordon it back to the lab,
p186
aVand actually man the trigger
p187
aVfrom the lab itself.
p188
aVBut what this gives us
p189
aVis the foresight to look at and analyze
p190
aVin scientific and engineering terms
p191
aVsome of the most amazing behavior
p192
aVthat the human eye just can't pick up,
p193
aVsuch as this manta shrimp
p194
aVtrying to catch its prey,
p195
aVwithin about .3 seconds.
p196
aVThat punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet,
p197
aVand if you ever try to catch a bullet
p198
aVin mid-flight with your eye, impossible.
p199
aVBut now we can see things
p200
aVsuch as these Christmas tree worms
p201
aVpulling in and fanning out
p202
aVin a way that the eye just can't capture,
p203
aVor in this case,
p204
aVa fish throwing up grains of sand.
p205
aVThis is an actual sailfin goby,
p206
aVand if you look at it in real time,
p207
aVit actually doesn't even show its fanning motion
p208
aVbecause it's so quick.
p209
aa(lp210
VOne of the most precious gifts that we had underwater
p211
aVis that we had WiFi,
p212
aVand for 31 days straight we were able to connect
p213
aVwith the world in real time  from the bottom of the sea
p214
aVand share all of these experiences.
p215
aVQuite literally right there
p216
aVI am Skyping in the classroom
p217
aVwith one of the six continents
p218
aVand some of the 70,000  students that we connected
p219
aVevery single day to some of these experiences.
p220
aVAs a matter of fact, I'm showing a picture that I took
p221
aVwith my smartphone from underwater
p222
aVof a goliath grouper laying on the bottom.
p223
aVWe had never seen that before.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd I dream of the day
p226
aVthat we have underwater cities,
p227
aVand maybe, just maybe, if we push the boundaries
p228
aVof adventure and knowledge,
p229
aVand we share that knowledge with others out there,
p230
aVwe can solve all sorts of problems.
p231
aVMy grandfather used to say,
p232
aV"People protect what they love."
p233
aVMy father, "How can people protect
p234
aVwhat they don't understand?"
p235
aVAnd I've thought about this my whole life.
p236
aVNothing is impossible.
p237
aVWe need to dream, we need to be creative,
p238
aVand we all need to have an adventure
p239
aVin order to create miracles in the darkest of times.
p240
aVAnd whether it's about climate change
p241
aVor eradicating poverty
p242
aVor giving back to future generations
p243
aVwhat we've taken for granted,
p244
aVit's about adventure.
p245
aVAnd who knows, maybe there will be underwater cities,
p246
aVand maybe some of you
p247
aVwill become the future aquanauts.
p248
aa(lp249
VThank you very much.

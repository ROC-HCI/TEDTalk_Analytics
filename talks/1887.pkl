VA couple of years ago,
p5
aVHarvard Business School chose
p6
aVthe best business model of that year.
p7
aVIt chose Somali piracy.
p8
aVPretty much around the same time,
p9
aVI discovered that there were 544 seafarers
p10
aVbeing held hostage on ships,
p11
aVoften anchored just off the Somali coast
p12
aVin plain sight.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd I learned these two facts, and I thought,
p15
aVwhat's going on in shipping?
p16
aVAnd I thought, would that happen in any other industry?
p17
aVWould we see 544 airline pilots
p18
aVheld captive in their jumbo jets
p19
aVon a runway for months, or a year?
p20
aVWould we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers?
p21
aVIt wouldn't happen.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo I started to get intrigued.
p24
aVAnd I discovered another fact,
p25
aVwhich to me was more astonishing
p26
aValmost for the fact that I hadn't known it before
p27
aVat the age of 42, 43.
p28
aVThat is how fundamentally  we still depend on shipping.
p29
aVBecause perhaps the general public
p30
aVthinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry,
p31
aVsomething brought by sailboat
p32
aVwith Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows.
p33
aVBut shipping isn't that.
p34
aVShipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been.
p35
aVShipping brings us 90 percent of world trade.
p36
aVShipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.
p37
aVWe are more dependent on it now than ever.
p38
aVAnd yet, for such an enormous industry \u2014
p39
aVthere are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea \u2014
p40
aVit's become pretty much invisible.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that,
p43
aVbecause here shipping is so present
p44
aVthat you stuck a ship on top of a hotel.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVBut elsewhere in the world,
p47
aVif you ask the general public what they know
p48
aVabout shipping and how much trade is carried by sea,
p49
aVyou will get essentially a blank face.
p50
aVYou will ask someone on the street
p51
aVif they've heard of Microsoft.
p52
aVI should think they'll say yes,
p53
aVbecause they'll know that they make software
p54
aVthat goes on computers,
p55
aVand occasionally works.
p56
aVBut if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk,
p57
aVI doubt you'd get the same response,
p58
aVeven though Maersk,
p59
aVwhich is just one shipping company amongst many,
p60
aVhas revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.
p61
aV[$60.2 billion]
p62
aa(lp63
VNow why is this?
p64
aVA few years ago,
p65
aVthe first sea lord of the British admiralty \u2014
p66
aVhe is called the first sea lord,
p67
aValthough the chief of the army is not called a land lord \u2014
p68
aVhe said that we, and he meant
p69
aVin the industrialized nations in the West,
p70
aVthat we suffer from sea blindness.
p71
aVWe are blind to the sea
p72
aVas a place of industry or of work.
p73
aVIt's just something we fly over,
p74
aVa patch of blue on an airline map.
p75
aVNothing to see, move along.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo I wanted to open my own eyes
p78
aVto my own sea blindness,
p79
aVso I ran away to sea.
p80
aVA couple of years ago, I took a passage
p81
aVon the Maersk Kendal,
p82
aVa mid-sized container ship
p83
aVcarrying nearly 7,000 boxes,
p84
aVand I departed from Felixstowe,
p85
aVon the south coast of England,
p86
aVand I ended up right here in Singapore
p87
aVfive weeks later,
p88
aVconsiderably less jet-lagged than I am right now.
p89
aVAnd it was a revelation.
p90
aVWe traveled through five seas,
p91
aVtwo oceans, nine ports,
p92
aVand I learned a lot about shipping.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd one of the first things that surprised me
p95
aVwhen I got on board Kendal
p96
aVwas, where are all the people?
p97
aVI have friends in the Navy who tell me
p98
aVthey sail with 1,000 sailors at a time,
p99
aVbut on Kendal there were only 21 crew.
p100
aVNow that's because shipping is very efficient.
p101
aVContainerization has made it very efficient.
p102
aVShips have automation now.
p103
aVThey can operate with small crews.
p104
aVBut it also means that, in the words
p105
aVof a port chaplain I once met,
p106
aVthe average seafarer you're going to find
p107
aVon a container ship is either tired or exhausted,
p108
aVbecause the pace of modern shipping
p109
aVis quite punishing for what the shipping calls
p110
aVits human element,
p111
aVa strange phrase which they don't seem to realize
p112
aVsounds a little bit inhuman.
p113
aVSo most seafarers now working on container ships
p114
aVoften have less than two hours in port at a time.
p115
aVThey don't have time to relax.
p116
aVThey're at sea for months at a time,
p117
aVand even when they're on board,
p118
aVthey don't have access to what
p119
aVa five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd another thing that surprised me when I got on board Kendal
p122
aVwas who I was sitting next to \u2014
p123
aVNot the queen; I can't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait \u2014
p124
aVBut around that dining table in the officer's saloon,
p125
aVI was sitting next to a Burmese guy,
p126
aVI was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian.
p127
aVOn the next table was a Chinese guy,
p128
aVand in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos.
p129
aVSo that was a normal working ship.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow how is that possible?
p132
aVBecause the biggest dramatic change
p133
aVin shipping over the last 60 years,
p134
aVwhen most of the general public stopped noticing it,
p135
aVwas something called an open registry,
p136
aVor a flag of convenience.
p137
aVShips can now fly the flag of any nation
p138
aVthat provides a flag registry.
p139
aVYou can get a flag from the landlocked nation
p140
aVof Bolivia, or Mongolia,
p141
aVor North Korea, though that's not very popular.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VSo we have these very multinational,
p145
aVglobal, mobile crews on ships.
p146
aVAnd that was a surprise to me.
p147
aVAnd when we got to pirate waters,
p148
aVdown the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and into the Indian Ocean,
p149
aVthe ship changed.
p150
aVAnd that was also shocking, because suddenly,
p151
aVI realized, as the captain said to me,
p152
aVthat I had been crazy to choose to go
p153
aVthrough pirate waters on a container ship.
p154
aVWe were no longer allowed on deck.
p155
aVThere were double pirate watches.
p156
aVAnd at that time, there were those  544 seafarers being held hostage,
p157
aVand some of them were held hostage for years
p158
aVbecause of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience.
p159
aVNot all of them, but some of them were,
p160
aVbecause for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners,
p161
aVit can be easy to hide behind
p162
aVthe anonymity offered by some flags of convenience.
p163
aa(lp164
VWhat else does our sea blindness mask?
p165
aVWell, if you go out to sea on a ship
p166
aVor on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel,
p167
aVyou'll see very black smoke.
p168
aVAnd that's because shipping
p169
aVhas very tight margins, and they want cheap fuel,
p170
aVso they use something called bunker fuel,
p171
aVwhich was described to me by someone in the tanker industry
p172
aVas the dregs of the refinery,
p173
aVor just one step up from asphalt.
p174
aVAnd shipping is the greenest method of transport.
p175
aVIn terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile,
p176
aVit emits about a thousandth of aviation
p177
aVand about a tenth of trucking.
p178
aVBut it's not benign, because there's so much of it.
p179
aVSo shipping emissions are about three to four percent,
p180
aValmost the same as aviation's.
p181
aVAnd if you put shipping emissions
p182
aVon a list of the countries' carbon emissions,
p183
aVit would come in about sixth,
p184
aVsomewhere near Germany.
p185
aVIt was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships
p186
aVpollute in terms of particles and soot
p187
aVand noxious gases
p188
aVas much as all the cars in the world.
p189
aVAnd the good news is that
p190
aVpeople are now talking about sustainable shipping.
p191
aVThere are interesting initiatives going on.
p192
aVBut why has it taken so long?
p193
aVWhen are we going to start talking and thinking
p194
aVabout shipping miles as well as air miles?
p195
aa(lp196
VI also traveled to Cape Cod to look
p197
aVat the plight of the North Atlantic right whale,
p198
aVbecause this to me was one of the most surprising things
p199
aVabout my time at sea,
p200
aVand what it made me think about.
p201
aVWe know about man's impact on the ocean
p202
aVin terms of fishing and overfishing,
p203
aVbut we don't really know much about
p204
aVwhat's happening underneath the water.
p205
aVAnd in fact, shipping has a role to play here,
p206
aVbecause shipping noise has contributed
p207
aVto damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures.
p208
aVLight doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of the water,
p209
aVso ocean creatures like whales and dolphins
p210
aVand even 800 species of fish
p211
aVcommunicate by sound.
p212
aVAnd a North Atlantic right whale
p213
aVcan transmit across hundreds of miles.
p214
aVA humpback can transmit a sound
p215
aVacross a whole ocean.
p216
aVBut a supertanker can also be heard
p217
aVcoming across a whole ocean,
p218
aVand because the noise that propellers make underwater
p219
aVis sometimes at the same frequency that whales use,
p220
aVthen it can damage their acoustic habitat,
p221
aVand they need this for breeding,
p222
aVfor finding feeding grounds,
p223
aVfor finding mates.
p224
aVAnd the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale
p225
aVhas been reduced by up to 90 percent.
p226
aVBut there are no laws governing  acoustic pollution yet.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd when I arrived in Singapore,
p229
aVand I apologize for this, but I  didn't want to get off my ship.
p230
aVI'd really loved being on board Kendal.
p231
aVI'd been well treated by the crew,
p232
aVI'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain,
p233
aVand I would happily have signed up for another five weeks,
p234
aVsomething that the captain also said
p235
aVI was crazy to think about.
p236
aVBut I wasn't there for nine months at a time
p237
aVlike the Filipino seafarers,
p238
aVwho, when I asked them to describe their job to me,
p239
aVcalled it "dollar for homesickness."
p240
aVThey had good salaries,
p241
aVbut theirs is still an isolating and difficult life
p242
aVin a dangerous and often difficult element.
p243
aa(lp244
VBut when I get to this part, I'm in two minds,
p245
aVbecause I want to salute those seafarers
p246
aVwho bring us 90 percent of everything
p247
aVand get very little thanks or recognition for it.
p248
aVI want to salute the 100,000 ships
p249
aVthat are at sea
p250
aVthat are doing that work, coming in and out
p251
aVevery day, bringing us what we need.
p252
aVBut I also want to see shipping,
p253
aVand us, the general public, who know so little about it,
p254
aVto have a bit more scrutiny,
p255
aVto be a bit more transparent,
p256
aVto have 90 percent transparency.
p257
aVBecause I think we could all benefit
p258
aVfrom doing something very simple,
p259
aVwhich is learning to see the sea.
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you.

VThis is the ocean as I used to know it.
p5
aVAnd I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times,
p6
aVI really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now,
p7
aVno matter where I am,
p8
aVeven where I know that none of the oil has gone,
p9
aVI sort of see slicks,
p10
aVand I'm finding that I'm very much haunted by it.
p11
aVBut what I want to talk to you about today
p12
aVis a lot of things that try to put all of this in context,
p13
aVnot just about the oil eruption, but what it means and why it has happened.
p14
aa(lp15
VFirst, just a little bit about me.
p16
aVI'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing
p17
aVever since I was a little kid, and because I did,
p18
aVI wound up studying sea birds
p19
aVto try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved.
p20
aVAnd now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing,
p21
aVand the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly.
p22
aVNow we saw this graphic earlier on, that we really live on a hard marble
p23
aVthat has just a slight bit of wetness to it.
p24
aVIt's like you dipped a marble in water.
p25
aVAnd the same thing with the atmosphere:
p26
aVIf you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball,
p27
aVyou would get that little sphere of gas on the right.
p28
aVSo we live on the most fragile little soap bubble you can imagine,
p29
aVa very sacred soap bubble, but one that is very, very easy to affect.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd all the burning of oil and coal and gas, all the fossil fuels,
p32
aVhave changed the atmosphere greatly.
p33
aVCarbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up.
p34
aVWe're warming the climate.
p35
aVSo the blowout in the Gulf
p36
aVis just a little piece of a much larger problem
p37
aVthat we have with the energy that we use to run civilization.
p38
aVBeyond warming,
p39
aVwe have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified \u2014
p40
aVand already measurably so, and already affecting animals.
p41
aVNow in the laboratory, if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is not 8.1,
p42
aVwhich is the normal pH of seawater, but 7.5,
p43
aVit dissolves in about three days.
p44
aVIf you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1,
p45
aVput it in a pH of 7.7 \u2014 not a huge change \u2014
p46
aVit becomes deformed and dies.
p47
aVAlready, commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places.
p48
aVCoral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem.
p49
aVSo this really matters.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, let's take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit.
p52
aVOne of the things that really impresses me about the people in the Gulf:
p53
aVThey are really, really aquatic people.
p54
aVAnd they can handle water.
p55
aVThey can handle a hurricane that comes and goes.
p56
aVWhen the water goes down, they know what to do.
p57
aVBut when it's something other than water, and their water habitat changes,
p58
aVthey don't have many options.
p59
aVIn fact, those entire communities really don't have many options.
p60
aVThey don't have another thing they can do.
p61
aVThey can't go and work in the local hotel business
p62
aVbecause there isn't one in their community.
p63
aa(lp64
VIf you go to the Gulf and you look around, you do see a lot of oil.
p65
aVYou see a lot of oil on the ocean.
p66
aVYou see a lot of oil on the shoreline.
p67
aVIf you go to the site of the blowout, it looks pretty unbelievable.
p68
aVIt looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car,
p69
aVand you just dumped it in the ocean.
p70
aVAnd one of the really most incredible things, I think,
p71
aVis that there's nobody out there trying to collect it
p72
aVat the site where it is densest.
p73
aVParts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic.
p74
aVYou go in along the shore, you can find it everywhere.
p75
aVIt's really messy.
p76
aVIf you go to the places where it's just arriving,
p77
aVlike the eastern part of the Gulf, in Alabama,
p78
aVthere's still people using the beach
p79
aVwhile there are people cleaning up the beach.
p80
aVAnd they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach.
p81
aVThey're not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand
p82
aVin a 50-gallon plastic bag.
p83
aVThey have thousands and thousands of plastic bags.
p84
aVI don't know what they'll do with all that stuff.
p85
aVMeanwhile, there are still people trying to use the beach.
p86
aVThey don't see the sign that says: "Stay out of the water."
p87
aVTheir kids are in the water;
p88
aVthey're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals\u2014
p89
aVIt's a mess.
p90
aVIf you go to where the oil has been for a while, it's an even bigger mess.
p91
aVAnd there's basically nobody there anymore,
p92
aVa few people trying to keep using it.
p93
aa(lp94
VYou see people who are really shell-shocked.
p95
aVThey are very hardworking people.
p96
aVAll they know about life is they get up in the morning,
p97
aVand if their engine starts, they go to work.
p98
aVThey always felt that they could rely on the assurances
p99
aVthat nature brought them through the ecosystem of the Gulf.
p100
aVThey're finding that their world is really collapsing.
p101
aVAnd so you can see, literally, signs of their shock ...
p102
aVsigns of their outrage ...
p103
aVsigns of their anger ...
p104
aVand signs of their grief.
p105
aVThese are the things that you can see.
p106
aa(lp107
VThere's a lot you can't see, also, underwater.
p108
aVWhat's going on underwater?
p109
aVWell, some people say there are oil plumes.
p110
aVSome people say there are not oil plumes.
p111
aVAnd Congressman Markey asks, you know,
p112
aV"Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes?"
p113
aVBut I couldn't take a submarine ride \u2014
p114
aVespecially between the time I knew I was coming here and today \u2014
p115
aVso I had to do a little experiment myself
p116
aVto see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
p117
aVSo this is the Gulf of Mexico ...
p118
aVsparkling place full of fish.
p119
aVAnd I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
p120
aVAnd I learned, in fact, I confirmed the hypothesis
p121
aVthat oil and water don't mix ...
p122
aVuntil you add a dispersant ...
p123
aVand then ...
p124
aVthey start mixing.
p125
aVAnd you add a little energy from the wind and the waves,
p126
aVand you get a big mess,
p127
aVa big mess that you can't possibly clean,
p128
aVyou can't touch, you can't extract
p129
aVand, I think most importantly \u2014 this is what I think \u2014
p130
aVyou can't see it.
p131
aVI think it's being hidden on purpose.
p132
aVNow this is such a catastrophe and such a mess
p133
aVthat lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream.
p134
aVBut as many people have said,
p135
aVthere's a large attempt to suppress what's going on.
p136
aVPersonally, I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body,
p137
aVbecause we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene.
p138
aVBut you can see it.
p139
aVYou can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface,
p140
aVand then it is attacked,
p141
aVbecause they don't want the evidence, in my opinion.
p142
aa(lp143
VOK.
p144
aVWe heard that bacteria eat oil?
p145
aVSo do sea turtles.
p146
aVWhen it breaks up,
p147
aVit has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria.
p148
aVTurtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish.
p149
aVThese guys have to swim around through it.
p150
aVI heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here.
p151
aVA writer named Ted Williams called me,
p152
aVand he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw,
p153
aVbecause he's writing an article for Audubon magazine.
p154
aVHe said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago; like about a week ago,
p155
aVand a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide
p156
aVtook him out to show him what's going on.
p157
aVThat guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings.
p158
aVHe has no bookings left.
p159
aVEverybody wanted their deposit back, everybody is fleeing.
p160
aVThat's the story of thousands of people.
p161
aVBut he told Ted that on the last day he went out,
p162
aVa bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat,
p163
aVand it was splattering oil out its blowhole.
p164
aVAnd he moved away because it was his last fishing trip,
p165
aVand he knew that the dolphins scare fish.
p166
aVSo he moved away from it, turned around a few minutes later,
p167
aVit was right next to the side of the boat again.
p168
aVHe said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that.
p169
aVAnd he felt that \u2014
p170
aa(lp171
V(Sigh)
p172
aa(lp173
Vhe felt that it was coming to ask for help.
p174
aVSorry.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow, in the Exxon Valdez spill,
p177
aVabout 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months.
p178
aVTheir numbers have never recovered.
p179
aVSo the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable.
p180
aVIt's going to take longer for some things.
p181
aVAnd some things, I think, will probably come back a little faster.
p182
aVThe other thing about the Gulf that is important
p183
aVis that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf
p184
aVat certain parts of the year.
p185
aVSo the Gulf is a really important piece of water \u2014
p186
aVmore important than a similar volume of water in the open Atlantic Ocean.
p187
aVThese tuna swim the entire ocean.
p188
aVThey get in the Gulf Stream, they go all the way to Europe.
p189
aVWhen it comes time to spawn, they come inside,
p190
aVand these two tuna that were tagged,
p191
aVyou can see them on the spawning grounds
p192
aVvery much right in the area of the slick.
p193
aVThey're probably having, at the very least,
p194
aVa catastrophic spawning season this year.
p195
aVI'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water.
p196
aVThey don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway.
p197
aVBut these are really high-performance athletic animals.
p198
aVI don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills.
p199
aVI don't know if it'll affect the adults.
p200
aVIf it's not, it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae,
p201
aVI would certainly think.
p202
aVBut if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down,
p203
aVthat's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo while the oil spill, the leak, the eruption, is a catastrophe,
p206
aVI think it's important to keep in mind
p207
aVthat we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean, for a very long time.
p208
aVIt's not like we're starting with something that's been OK.
p209
aVWe're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses
p210
aVand a lot of problems to begin with.
p211
aVIf you look around at the birds, there are a lot of birds in the Gulf
p212
aVthat concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year,
p213
aVbut then leave.
p214
aVAnd they populate much larger areas.
p215
aVFor instance, most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds.
p216
aVThey were all on the Gulf in May,
p217
aVwhile oil was starting to come ashore in certain places.
p218
aVDown on the lower left there are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings.
p219
aVThey breed in the High Arctic,
p220
aVand they winter down in southern South America.
p221
aVBut they concentrate in the Gulf and then fan out all across the Arctic.
p222
aVI saw birds that breed in Greenland, in the Gulf.
p223
aVSo this is a hemispheric issue.
p224
aVThe economic effects go at least nationally in many ways.
p225
aVThe biological effects are certainly hemispheric.
p226
aa(lp227
VI think that this is one of the most absolutely mind-boggling examples
p228
aVof total unpreparedness that I can even think of.
p229
aVEven when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor,
p230
aVat least they shot back.
p231
aVAnd we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do.
p232
aVThere was nothing ready,
p233
aVand, you know, as we can see by what they're doing.
p234
aVMainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants.
p235
aVThe booms are absolutely not made for open water.
p236
aVThey don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated.
p237
aVThey get near shore \u2014 Look at these two boats.
p238
aVThat one on the right is called Fishing Fool.
p239
aVAnd I think, you know, that's a great name
p240
aVfor boats that think that they're going to do anything
p241
aVto make a dent in this, by dragging a boom between them
p242
aVwhen there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles
p243
aVin the Gulf right now with oil at the surface.
p244
aa(lp245
VThe dispersants make the oil go right under the booms.
p246
aVThe booms are only about 13 inches in diameter.
p247
aVSo it's just absolutely crazy.
p248
aVHere are shrimp boats employed.
p249
aVThere are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets.
p250
aVHere they are working.
p251
aVYou can see easily
p252
aVthat all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom.
p253
aVAll they're doing is stirring it.
p254
aVIt's just ridiculous.
p255
aVAlso, for all the shoreline that has booms \u2014
p256
aVhundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline \u2014
p257
aVall of the shoreline that has booms,
p258
aVthere's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms.
p259
aVThere is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd that lower photo, that's a bird colony that has been boomed.
p262
aVEverybody's trying to protect the bird colonies there.
p263
aVWell, as an ornithologist, I can tell you that birds fly, and that \u2014
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
Vand that booming a bird colony doesn't do it; it doesn't do it.
p268
aVThese birds make a living by diving into the water.
p269
aVIn fact ...
p270
aVreally what I think they should do, if anything \u2014
p271
aVthey're trying so hard to protect those nests \u2014
p272
aVactually, if they destroyed every single nest,
p273
aVsome of the birds would leave,
p274
aVand that would be better for them this year.
p275
aVAs far as cleaning them ...
p276
aVI don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds.
p277
aVIt's really, really important that we express our compassion.
p278
aVI think that's the most important thing that people have, is compassion.
p279
aVIt's really important to get those images and to show it.
p280
aVBut really, where are those birds going to get released to?
p281
aVIt's like taking somebody out of a burning building,
p282
aVtreating them for smoke inhalation
p283
aVand sending them back into the building, because the oil is still gushing.
p284
aa(lp285
VI refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident.
p286
aVI think that this is the result of gross negligence.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VNot just BP.
p291
aVBP operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could.
p292
aVAnd they were allowed to do so
p293
aVbecause of the absolute failure of oversight of the government
p294
aVthat is supposed to be our government, protecting us.
p295
aVIt turns out that \u2014
p296
aVyou see this sign on every commercial vessel in the United States \u2014
p297
aVyou know, if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil,
p298
aVyou would be in big trouble.
p299
aVAnd you have to really wonder who are the laws made for,
p300
aVand who has gotten above the laws.
p301
aVAnd there are things that we can do in the future.
p302
aVWe could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need.
p303
aVIt would not take an awful lot to anticipate
p304
aVthat after making 30,000 holes
p305
aVin the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil,
p306
aVoil might start coming out of one of them.
p307
aVAnd you'd have some idea of what to do.
p308
aVThat's certainly one of the things we need to do.
p309
aa(lp310
VBut I think we have to understand where this leak really started from.
p311
aVIt really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there
p312
aVbecause it's our government,
p313
aVmeant to protect the larger public interest.
p314
aVSo I think that the oil blowout, the bank bailout,
p315
aVthe mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause.
p316
aVWe still seem to understand that at least,
p317
aVwe need the police to protect us from a few bad people.
p318
aVAnd even though the police can be a little annoying at times \u2014
p319
aVgiving us tickets and stuff like that \u2014
p320
aVnobody says that we should just get rid of them.
p321
aVBut in the entire rest of government right now
p322
aVand for the last at least 30 years,
p323
aVthere has been a culture of deregulation
p324
aVthat is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from,
p325
aVbuying the government out from under us.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Applause)
p328
aa(lp329
VNow this has been a problem for a very, very long time.
p330
aVYou can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America,
p331
aVand even Thomas Jefferson complained
p332
aVthat they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country.
p333
aVOK, people who say they're conservative,
p334
aVif they really wanted to be really conservative and patriotic,
p335
aVthey would tell these corporations to go to hell.
p336
aVThat's what it would really mean to be conservative.
p337
aVSo what we really need to do is regain the idea
p338
aVthat it's our government safeguarding our interests,
p339
aVand regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country
p340
aVthat really has been lost.
p341
aVI think there are signs of hope.
p342
aa(lp343
VWe seem to be waking up a little bit.
p344
aVThe Glass-Steagall Act \u2014 which was really to protect us
p345
aVfrom the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen,
p346
aVand the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts \u2014
p347
aVthat was put in effect in 1933, was systematically destroyed.
p348
aVNow there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place,
p349
aVbut the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations
p350
aVafter the legislation has just passed.
p351
aVSo it's a continued fight.
p352
aVIt's a historic moment right now.
p353
aVWe're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe
p354
aVof this oil leak in the Gulf,
p355
aVor we will make the moment we need out of this,
p356
aVas many people have noted today.
p357
aVThere's certainly a common theme
p358
aVabout needing to make the moment out of this.
p359
aa(lp360
VWe've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling.
p361
aVThe first offshore wells were called whales.
p362
aVThe first offshore drills were called harpoons.
p363
aVWe emptied the ocean of the whales at that time.
p364
aVNow are we stuck with this?
p365
aVEver since we lived in caves, every time we wanted any energy,
p366
aVwe lit something on fire, and that is still what we're doing.
p367
aVWe're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy.
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd people say we can't have clean energy
p370
aVbecause it's too expensive.
p371
aVWho says it's too expensive?
p372
aVPeople who sell us fossil fuels.
p373
aVWe've been here before with energy,
p374
aVand people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch,
p375
aVbecause the cheapest energy was slavery.
p376
aVEnergy is always a moral issue.
p377
aVIt's an issue that is moral right now.
p378
aVIt's a matter of right and wrong.
p379
aa(lp380
VThank you very much.

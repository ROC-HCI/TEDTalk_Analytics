VToday I want to talk to you
p5
aVabout ethnic conflict
p6
aVand civil war.
p7
aVThese are not normally the most cheerful of topics,
p8
aVnor do they generally generate
p9
aVthe kind of good news
p10
aVthat this conference is about.
p11
aVYet, not only is there at least some good news
p12
aVto be told about fewer such conflicts now
p13
aVthan two decades ago,
p14
aVbut what is perhaps more important
p15
aVis that we also have come
p16
aVto a much better understanding of what can be done
p17
aVto further reduce the number
p18
aVof ethnic conflicts and civil wars
p19
aVand the suffering that they inflict.
p20
aVThree things stand out:
p21
aVleadership, diplomacy
p22
aVand institutional design.
p23
aVWhat I will focus on in my talk
p24
aVis why they matter, how they matter,
p25
aVand what we can all do
p26
aVto make sure that they continue to matter
p27
aVin the right ways,
p28
aVthat is, how all of us can contribute
p29
aVto developing and honing the skills
p30
aVof local and global leaders
p31
aVto make peace
p32
aVand to make it last.
p33
aVBut let's start at the beginning.
p34
aa(lp35
VCivil wars have made news headlines
p36
aVfor many decades now,
p37
aVand ethnic conflicts in particular
p38
aVhave been a near constant presence
p39
aVas a major international security threat.
p40
aVFor nearly two decades now,
p41
aVthe news has been bad
p42
aVand the images have been haunting.
p43
aVIn Georgia, after years of stalemate,
p44
aVwe saw a full-scale resurgence of violence
p45
aVin August, 2008.
p46
aVThis quickly escalated into a five-day war
p47
aVbetween Russia and Georgia,
p48
aVleaving Georgia ever more divided.
p49
aVIn Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 \u2014
p50
aVwe just heard about them \u2014
p51
aVquickly led to high levels
p52
aVof inter-ethnic violence
p53
aVand the killing and displacement
p54
aVof thousands of people.
p55
aVIn Sri Lanka,
p56
aVa decades-long civil war
p57
aVbetween the Tamil minority
p58
aVand the Sinhala majority
p59
aVled to a bloody climax in 2009,
p60
aVafter perhaps as many as 100,000
p61
aVpeople had been killed
p62
aVsince 1983.
p63
aVIn Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks,
p64
aVunprecedented levels of violence occurred
p65
aVbetween ethnic Kyrgyz
p66
aVand ethnic Uzbeks.
p67
aVHundreds have been killed,
p68
aVand more than 100,000 displaced,
p69
aVincluding many ethnic Uzbeks
p70
aVwho fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.
p71
aVIn the Middle East,
p72
aVconflict between Israelis and Palestinians
p73
aVcontinues unabated,
p74
aVand it becomes ever more difficult
p75
aVto see how, just how
p76
aVa possible, sustainable solution
p77
aVcan be achieved.
p78
aVDarfur may have slipped from the news headlines,
p79
aVbut the killing and displacement there
p80
aVcontinues as well,
p81
aVand the sheer human misery that it creates
p82
aVis very hard to fathom.
p83
aVAnd in Iraq, finally,
p84
aVviolence is on the rise again,
p85
aVand the country has yet to form a government
p86
aVfour months after
p87
aVits last parliamentary elections.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.
p90
aVSo are these now the images of the past?
p91
aVWell, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures
p92
aVfrom the Middle East, Darfur,
p93
aVIraq, elsewhere,
p94
aVthere is a longer-term trend
p95
aVthat does represent some good news.
p96
aVOver the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,
p97
aVthere has been an overall decline
p98
aVin the number of civil wars.
p99
aVSince the high in the early 1990s,
p100
aVwith about 50 such civil wars ongoing,
p101
aVwe now have 30 percent fewer
p102
aVsuch conflicts today.
p103
aVThe number of people killed in civil wars
p104
aValso is much lower today
p105
aVthan it was a decade ago or two.
p106
aVBut this trend is less unambiguous.
p107
aVThe highest level of deaths on the battlefield
p108
aVwas recorded between 1998 and 2001,
p109
aVwith about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels
p110
aVkilled every year.
p111
aVThe lowest number of combatant casualties
p112
aVoccurred in 2003,
p113
aVwith just 20,000 killed.
p114
aVDespite the up and down since then,
p115
aVthe overall trend \u2014
p116
aVand this is the important bit \u2014
p117
aVclearly points downward
p118
aVfor the past two decades.
p119
aa(lp120
VThe news about civilian casualties
p121
aVis also less bad than it used to be.
p122
aVFrom over 12,000 civilians
p123
aVdeliberately killed in civil wars
p124
aVin 1997 and 1998,
p125
aVa decade later,
p126
aVthis figure stands at 4,000.
p127
aVThis is a decrease by two-thirds.
p128
aVThis decline would be even more obvious
p129
aVif we factored in the genocide in Rwanda
p130
aVin 1994.
p131
aVBut then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered
p132
aVin a matter of just a few months.
p133
aVThis certainly is an accomplishment
p134
aVthat must never be surpassed.
p135
aVWhat is also important is to note
p136
aVthat these figures only tell part of the story.
p137
aVThey exclude people
p138
aVthat died as a consequence of civil war,
p139
aVfrom hunger or disease, for example.
p140
aVAnd they also do not properly account
p141
aVfor civilian suffering more generally.
p142
aVTorture, rape and ethnic cleansing
p143
aVhave become highly effective,
p144
aVif often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.
p145
aVTo put it differently,
p146
aVfor the civilians that suffer the consequences
p147
aVof ethnic conflict and civil war,
p148
aVthere is no good war
p149
aVand there is no bad peace.
p150
aVThus, even though every civilian killed,
p151
aVmaimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,
p152
aVthe fact that the number
p153
aVof civilian casualties
p154
aVis clearly lower today
p155
aVthan it was a decade ago,
p156
aVis good news.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo, we have fewer conflicts today
p159
aVin which fewer people get killed.
p160
aVAnd the big question, of course,
p161
aVis why?
p162
aVIn some cases,
p163
aVthere is a military victory of one side.
p164
aVThis is a solution of sorts,
p165
aVbut rarely is it one
p166
aVthat comes without human costs
p167
aVor humanitarian consequences.
p168
aVThe defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka
p169
aVis perhaps the most recent example of this,
p170
aVbut we have seen similar
p171
aVso-called military solutions
p172
aVin the Balkans, in the South Caucasus
p173
aVand across most of Africa.
p174
aVAt times, they are complimented
p175
aVby negotiated settlements,
p176
aVor at least cease-fire agreements,
p177
aVand peacekeepers are deployed.
p178
aVBut hardly ever do they represent
p179
aVa resounding success \u2014
p180
aVBosnia and Herzegovina
p181
aVperhaps more so than Georgia.
p182
aVBut for many parts of Africa,
p183
aVa colleague of mine once put it this way,
p184
aV"The cease-fire on Tuesday night
p185
aVwas reached just in time
p186
aVfor the genocide to start on Wednesday morning."
p187
aa(lp188
VBut let's look at the good news again.
p189
aVIf there's no solution on the battlefield,
p190
aVthree factors can account
p191
aVfor the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,
p192
aVor for sustainable peace afterwards:
p193
aVleadership, diplomacy
p194
aVand institutional design.
p195
aVTake the example of Northern Ireland.
p196
aVDespite centuries of animosity,
p197
aVdecades of violence
p198
aVand thousands of people killed,
p199
aV1998 saw the conclusion
p200
aVof an historic agreement.
p201
aVIts initial version was skillfully mediated
p202
aVby Senator George Mitchell.
p203
aVCrucially, for the long-term success
p204
aVof the peace process in Northern Ireland,
p205
aVhe imposed very clear conditions
p206
aVfor the participation and negotiations.
p207
aVCentral among them,
p208
aVa commitment
p209
aVto exclusively peaceful means.
p210
aVSubsequent revisions of the agreement
p211
aVwere facilitated by the British and Irish governments,
p212
aVwho never wavered in their determination
p213
aVto bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.
p214
aa(lp215
VThe core institutions
p216
aVthat were put in place in 1998
p217
aVand their modifications
p218
aVin 2006 and 2008
p219
aVwere highly innovative
p220
aVand allowed all conflict parties
p221
aVto see their core concerns and demands addressed.
p222
aVThe agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement
p223
aVin Northern Ireland
p224
aVwith cross-border institutions
p225
aVthat link Belfast and Dublin
p226
aVand thus recognizes
p227
aVthe so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.
p228
aVAnd significantly,
p229
aVthere's also a clear focus
p230
aVon both the rights of individuals
p231
aVand the rights of communities.
p232
aVThe provisions in the agreement may be complex,
p233
aVbut so is the underlying conflict.
p234
aVPerhaps most importantly,
p235
aVlocal leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,
p236
aVnot always fast
p237
aVand not always enthusiastically,
p238
aVbut rise in the end they did.
p239
aVWho ever could have imagined
p240
aVIan Paisley and Martin McGuinness
p241
aVjointly governing Northern Ireland
p242
aVas First and Deputy First Minister?
p243
aa(lp244
VBut then, is Northern Ireland a unique example,
p245
aVor does this kind of explanation
p246
aVonly hold more generally
p247
aVin democratic and developed countries?
p248
aVBy no means.
p249
aVThe ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war
p250
aVin 2003
p251
aVillustrates the importance
p252
aVof leadership, diplomacy
p253
aVand institutional design
p254
aVas much as the successful prevention
p255
aVof a full-scale civil war
p256
aVin Macedonia in 2001,
p257
aVor the successful ending
p258
aVof the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.
p259
aVIn all three cases,
p260
aVlocal leaders were willing and able
p261
aVto make peace,
p262
aVthe international community stood ready
p263
aVto help them negotiate and implement an agreement,
p264
aVand the institutions have lived up
p265
aVto the promise that they held
p266
aVon the day they were agreed.
p267
aa(lp268
VFocusing on leadership, diplomacy
p269
aVand institutional design
p270
aValso helps explain failures to achieve peace,
p271
aVor to make it last.
p272
aVThe hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords
p273
aVdid not lead to an end
p274
aVof the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
p275
aVNot all the issues that needed to be resolved
p276
aVwere actually covered in the agreements.
p277
aVRather, local leaders committed
p278
aVto revisiting them later on.
p279
aVYet instead of grasping this opportunity,
p280
aVlocal and international leaders
p281
aVsoon disengaged
p282
aVand became distracted
p283
aVby the second Intifada, the events of 9/11
p284
aVand the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
p285
aa(lp286
VThe comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan
p287
aVsigned in 2005
p288
aVturned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,
p289
aVand its provisions may yet bear the seeds
p290
aVof a full-scale return to war
p291
aVbetween north and south.
p292
aVChanges and shortcomings in leadership,
p293
aVmore off than on international diplomacy
p294
aVand institutional failures
p295
aVaccount for this
p296
aVin almost equal measure.
p297
aVUnresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,
p298
aVthe ongoing conflict in Darfur,
p299
aVescalating tribal violence in the south
p300
aVand generally weak state capacity
p301
aVacross all of Sudan
p302
aVcomplete a very depressing picture
p303
aVof the state of affairs
p304
aVin Africa's largest country.
p305
aa(lp306
VA final example: Kosovo.
p307
aVThe failure to achieve
p308
aVa negotiated solution for Kosovo
p309
aVand the violence, tension
p310
aVand de facto partition that resulted from it
p311
aVhave their reasons
p312
aVin many, many different factors.
p313
aVCentral among them are three.
p314
aVFirst, the intransigence of local leaders
p315
aVto settle for nothing less
p316
aVthan their maximum demands.
p317
aVSecond, an international diplomatic effort
p318
aVthat was hampered from the beginning
p319
aVby Western support for Kosovo's independence.
p320
aVAnd third, a lack of imagination
p321
aVwhen it came to designing institutions
p322
aVthat could have addressed the concerns
p323
aVof Serbs and Albanians alike.
p324
aVBy the same token \u2014
p325
aVand here we have some good news again \u2014
p326
aVthe very fact that there is a high-level,
p327
aVwell-resourced international presence
p328
aVin Kosovo
p329
aVand the Balkans region more generally
p330
aVand the fact that local leaders on both sides
p331
aVhave showed relative restraint,
p332
aVexplains why things have not been worse
p333
aVover the past two years since 2008.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo even in situations
p336
aVwhere outcomes are less than optimal,
p337
aVlocal leaders
p338
aVand international leaders have a choice,
p339
aVand they can make a difference for the better.
p340
aVA cold war
p341
aVis not as good
p342
aVas a cold peace,
p343
aVbut a cold peace
p344
aVis still better than a hot war.
p345
aVGood news is also about learning the right lesson.
p346
aVSo what then distinguishes
p347
aVthe Israeli/Palestinian conflict
p348
aVfrom that in Northern Ireland,
p349
aVor the civil war in Sudan
p350
aVfrom that in Liberia?
p351
aVBoth successes and failures
p352
aVteach us several critically important things
p353
aVthat we need to bear in mind
p354
aVif we want the good news to continue.
p355
aVFirst, leadership.
p356
aVIn the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war
p357
aVare not natural
p358
aVbut man-made disasters,
p359
aVtheir prevention and settlement
p360
aVdoes not happen automatically either.
p361
aVLeadership needs to be capable,
p362
aVdetermined and visionary
p363
aVin its commitment to peace.
p364
aVLeaders need to connect to each other
p365
aVand to their followers,
p366
aVand they need to bring them along
p367
aVon what is an often arduous journey
p368
aVinto a peaceful future.
p369
aa(lp370
VSecond, diplomacy.
p371
aVDiplomacy needs to be well resourced,
p372
aVsustained,
p373
aVand apply the right mix of incentives and pressures
p374
aVon leaders and followers.
p375
aVIt needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,
p376
aVand it needs to ensure
p377
aVthat a broad coalition
p378
aVof local, regional
p379
aVand international supporters
p380
aVhelp them implement their agreement.
p381
aa(lp382
VThird, institutional design.
p383
aVInstitutional design requires
p384
aVa keen focus on issues,
p385
aVinnovative thinking
p386
aVand flexible and well-funded implementation.
p387
aVConflict parties need to move away
p388
aVfrom maximum demands
p389
aVand towards a compromise
p390
aVthat recognizes each other's needs.
p391
aVAnd they need to think
p392
aVabout the substance of their agreement
p393
aVmuch more than about
p394
aVthe labels they want to attach to them.
p395
aVConflict parties also need to be prepared
p396
aVto return to the negotiation table
p397
aVif the agreement implementation stalls.
p398
aa(lp399
VFor me personally,
p400
aVthe most critical lesson of all is this:
p401
aVLocal commitment to peace
p402
aVis all-important,
p403
aVbut it is often not enough
p404
aVto prevent or end violence.
p405
aVYet, no amount of diplomacy
p406
aVor institutional design
p407
aVcan make up for local failures
p408
aVand the consequences that they have.
p409
aVTherefore, we must invest
p410
aVin developing leaders,
p411
aVleaders that have the skills,
p412
aVvision and determination
p413
aVto make peace.
p414
aVLeaders, in other words,
p415
aVthat people will trust
p416
aVand that they will want to follow
p417
aVeven if that means
p418
aVmaking hard choices.
p419
aa(lp420
VA final thought:
p421
aVEnding civil wars
p422
aVis a process that is fraught with dangers,
p423
aVfrustrations and setbacks.
p424
aVIt often takes a generation to accomplish,
p425
aVbut it also requires us, today's generation,
p426
aVto take responsibility
p427
aVand to learn the right lessons
p428
aVabout leadership, diplomacy
p429
aVand institutional design,
p430
aVso that the child soldiers of today
p431
aVcan become the children of tomorrow.
p432
aa(lp433

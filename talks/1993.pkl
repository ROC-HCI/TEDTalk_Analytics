VSo, I have a feature on my website where every week
p5
aVpeople submit hypothetical questions
p6
aVfor me to answer,
p7
aVand I try to answer them using math, science
p8
aVand comics.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo for example, one person asked,
p11
aVwhat would happen if you tried to hit a baseball
p12
aVpitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?
p13
aVSo I did some calculations.
p14
aVNow, normally, when an object flies through the air,
p15
aVthe air will flow around the object,
p16
aVbut in this case, the ball would be going so fast
p17
aVthat the air molecules wouldn't have time
p18
aVto move out of the way.
p19
aVThe ball would smash right into and through them,
p20
aVand the collisions with these air molecules
p21
aVwould knock away the nitrogen,
p22
aVcarbon and hydrogen from the ball,
p23
aVfragmenting it off into tiny particles,
p24
aVand also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion
p25
aVin the air around it.
p26
aVThis would result in a flood of x-rays
p27
aVthat would spread out in a bubble
p28
aValong with exotic particles,
p29
aVplasma inside, centered on the pitcher's mound,
p30
aVand that would move away from the pitcher's mound
p31
aVslightly faster than the ball.
p32
aVNow at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,
p33
aVthe home plate is far enough away
p34
aVthat light hasn't had time to reach it,
p35
aVwhich means the batter
p36
aVstill sees the pitcher about to throw
p37
aVand has no idea that anything is wrong.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVNow, after 70 nanoseconds,
p40
aVthe ball will reach home plate,
p41
aVor at least the cloud of expanding plasma
p42
aVthat used to be the ball,
p43
aVand it will engulf the bat and the batter
p44
aVand the plate and the catcher and the umpire
p45
aVand start disintegrating them all
p46
aVas it also starts to carry them backward
p47
aVthrough the backstop, which also starts to disintegrate.
p48
aVSo if you were watching this whole thing
p49
aVfrom a hill,
p50
aVideally, far away,
p51
aVwhat you'd see is a bright flash of light
p52
aVthat would fade over a few seconds,
p53
aVfollowed by a blast wave spreading out,
p54
aVshredding trees and houses
p55
aVas it moves away from the stadium,
p56
aVand then eventually a mushroom cloud
p57
aVrising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VSo the Major League Baseball rules
p60
aVare a little bit hazy,
p61
aVbut \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 under rule 6.02 and 5.09,
p62
aVI think that in this situation,
p63
aVthe batter would be considered hit by pitch
p64
aVand would be eligible to take first base,
p65
aVif it still existed.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo this is the kind of question I answer,
p68
aVand I get people writing in with
p69
aVa lot of other strange questions.
p70
aVI've had someone write and say,
p71
aVscientifically speaking, what is the best
p72
aVand fastest way to hide a body?
p73
aVCan you do this one soon?
p74
aVAnd I had someone write in,
p75
aVI've had people write in about,
p76
aVcan you prove whether or not you can find love again
p77
aVafter your heart's broken?
p78
aVAnd I've had people send in
p79
aVwhat are clearly homework questions
p80
aVthey're trying to get me to do for them.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut one week, a couple months ago,
p83
aVI got a question that was actually about Google.
p84
aVIf all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards,
p85
aVhow big would Google's data warehouse be?
p86
aVNow, Google's pretty secretive about their operations,
p87
aVso no one really knows how much data Google has,
p88
aVand in fact, no one really knows how many data centers Google has,
p89
aVexcept people at Google itself.
p90
aVAnd I've tried, I've met them a few times,
p91
aVtried asking them, and they aren't revealing anything.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo I decided to try to figure this out myself.
p94
aVThere are a few things that I looked at here.
p95
aVI started with money.
p96
aVGoogle has to reveal how much they spend,
p97
aVin general, and that lets you put some caps
p98
aVon how many data centers could they be building,
p99
aVbecause a big data center costs a certain amount of money.
p100
aVAnd you can also then put a cap on
p101
aVhow much of the world hard drive market are they taking up,
p102
aVwhich turns out, it's pretty sizable.
p103
aVI read a calculation at one point,
p104
aVI think Google has a drive failure
p105
aVabout every minute or two,
p106
aVand they just throw out the hard drive
p107
aVand swap in a new one.
p108
aVSo they go through a huge number of them.
p109
aVAnd so by looking at money,
p110
aVyou can get an idea of how many of these centers they have.
p111
aVYou can also look at power.
p112
aVYou can look at how much electricity they need,
p113
aVbecause you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers,
p114
aVand Google is more efficient than most,
p115
aVbut they still have some basic requirements,
p116
aVand that lets you put a limit
p117
aVon the number of servers that they have.
p118
aVYou can also look at square footage and see
p119
aVof the data centers that you know,
p120
aVhow big are they?
p121
aVHow much room is that?
p122
aVHow many server racks could you fit in there?
p123
aVAnd for some data centers,
p124
aVyou might get two of these pieces of information.
p125
aVYou know how much they spent,
p126
aVand they also, say, because they had to contract
p127
aVwith the local government
p128
aVto get the power provided,
p129
aVyou might know what they made a deal to buy,
p130
aVso you know how much power it takes.
p131
aVThen you can look at the ratios of those numbers,
p132
aVand figure out for a data center
p133
aVwhere you don't have that information,
p134
aVyou can figure out,
p135
aVbut maybe you only have one of those,
p136
aVyou know the square footage, then you could figure out
p137
aVwell, maybe the power is proportional.
p138
aVAnd you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities,
p139
aVyou know, with guesses about the total amount of storage,
p140
aVthe number of servers, the number of drives per server,
p141
aVand in each case using what you know
p142
aVto come up with a model that narrows down
p143
aVyour guesses for the things that you don't know.
p144
aVIt's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get.
p145
aVAnd this is a lot of fun.
p146
aVThe math is not all that advanced,
p147
aVand really it's like nothing more than
p148
aVsolving a sudoku puzzle.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo what I did, I went through all of this information,
p151
aVspent a day or two researching.
p152
aVAnd there are some things I didn't look at.
p153
aVYou could always look at the Google
p154
aVrecruitment messages that they post.
p155
aVThat gives you an idea of where they have people.
p156
aVSometimes, when people visit a data center,
p157
aVthey'll take a cell-cam photo and post it,
p158
aVand they aren't supposed to,
p159
aVbut you can learn things about their hardware that way.
p160
aVAnd in fact, you can just look at pizza delivery drivers.
p161
aVTurns out, they know where all the Google data centers are,
p162
aVat least the ones that have people in them.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut I came up with my estimate,
p165
aVwhich I felt pretty good about,
p166
aVthat was about 10 exabytes of data
p167
aVacross all of Google's operations,
p168
aVand then another maybe five exabytes or so
p169
aVof offline storage in tape drives,
p170
aVwhich it turns out Google is
p171
aVabout the world's largest consumer of.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo I came up with this estimate, and this is
p174
aVa staggering amount of data.
p175
aVIt's quite a bit more than any other organization
p176
aVin the world has, as far as we know.
p177
aVThere's a couple of other contenders,
p178
aVespecially everyone always thinks of the NSA.
p179
aVBut using some of these same methods,
p180
aVwe can look at the NSA's data centers,
p181
aVand figure out, you know, we don't know what's going on there,
p182
aVbut it's pretty clear that their operation
p183
aVis not the size of Google's.
p184
aa(lp185
VAdding all of this up, I came up with
p186
aVthe other thing that we can answer, which is,
p187
aVhow many punch cards would this take?
p188
aVAnd so a punch card can hold
p189
aVabout 80 characters,
p190
aVand you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,
p191
aVand you put them in, say,
p192
aVmy home region of New England,
p193
aVit would cover the entire region
p194
aVup to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,
p195
aVwhich is about three times deeper
p196
aVthan the glaciers during the last ice age
p197
aVabout 20,000 years ago.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo this is impractical, but I think
p200
aVthat's about the best answer I could come up with.
p201
aVAnd I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.
p202
aVAnd I didn't expect to get an answer from Google,
p203
aVbecause of course they've been so secretive,
p204
aVthey didn't answer of my questions,
p205
aVand so I just put it up and said,
p206
aVwell, I guess we'll never know.
p207
aa(lp208
VBut then a little while later
p209
aVI got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,
p210
aVsaying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.
p211
aVSo I go and get it, open it up,
p212
aVand it's punch cards. (Laughter)
p213
aVGoogle-branded punch cards.
p214
aVAnd on these punch cards, there are a bunch of holes,
p215
aVand I said, thank you, thank you,
p216
aVokay, so what's on here?
p217
aVSo I get some software and start reading it,
p218
aVand scan them, and it turns out
p219
aVit's a puzzle.
p220
aVThere's a bunch of code,
p221
aVand I get some friends to help,
p222
aVand we crack the code, and then inside that is another code,
p223
aVand then there are some equations,
p224
aVand then we solve those equations,
p225
aVand then finally out pops a message from Google
p226
aVwhich is their official answer to my article,
p227
aVand it said, "No comment."
p228
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd I love calculating these kinds of things,
p231
aVand it's not that I love doing the math.
p232
aVI do a lot of math,
p233
aVbut I don't really like math for its own sake.
p234
aVWhat I love is that it lets you take
p235
aVsome things that you know,
p236
aVand just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper,
p237
aVfind out something that you didn't know
p238
aVthat's very surprising.
p239
aVAnd I have a lot of stupid questions,
p240
aVand I love that math gives the power
p241
aVto answer them sometimes.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd sometimes not.
p244
aVThis is a question I got from a reader,
p245
aVan anonymous reader,
p246
aVand the subject line just said, "Urgent,"
p247
aVand this was the entire email:
p248
aV"If people had wheels and could fly,
p249
aVhow would we differentiate them from airplanes?"
p250
aVUrgent. (Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd I think there are some questions
p253
aVthat math just cannot answer.
p254
aVThank you.
p255
aV(Applause)

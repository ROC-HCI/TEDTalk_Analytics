VA question I'm often asked is,
p5
aVwhere did I get my passion for human rights and justice?
p6
aVIt started early.
p7
aVI grew up in the west of Ireland,
p8
aVwedged between four brothers,
p9
aVtwo older than me and two younger than me.
p10
aVSo of course I had to be interested in human rights,
p11
aVand equality and justice,
p12
aVand using my elbows!
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd those issues stayed with me and guided me,
p17
aVand in particular,
p18
aVwhen I was elected the first woman President of Ireland,
p19
aVfrom 1990 to 1997.
p20
aVI dedicated my presidency
p21
aVto having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of Ireland,
p22
aVand bringing together communities from Northern Ireland
p23
aVwith those from the Republic,
p24
aVtrying to build peace.
p25
aVAnd I went as the first Irish president to the United Kingdom
p26
aVand met with Queen Elizabeth II,
p27
aVand also welcomed to my official residence \u2014
p28
aVwhich we call "Áras an Uachtaráin," the house of the president \u2014
p29
aVmembers of the royal family,
p30
aVincluding, notably, the Prince of Wales.
p31
aVAnd I was aware that at the time of my presidency,
p32
aVIreland was a country beginning a rapid economic progress.
p33
aVWe were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the European Union.
p34
aVIndeed, when Ireland first joined the European Union in 1973,
p35
aVthere were parts of the country that were considered developing,
p36
aVincluding my own beloved native county, County Mayo.
p37
aVI led trade delegations here to the United States,
p38
aVto Japan, to India,
p39
aVto encourage investment, to help to create jobs,
p40
aVto build up our economy,
p41
aVto build up our health system, our education \u2014
p42
aVour development.
p43
aa(lp44
VWhat I didn't have to do as president
p45
aVwas buy land on mainland Europe,
p46
aVso that Irish citizens could go there because our island was going underwater.
p47
aVWhat I didn't have to think about,
p48
aVeither as president or as a constitutional lawyer,
p49
aVwas the implications for the sovereignty of the territory
p50
aVbecause of the impact of climate change.
p51
aVBut that is what President Tong, of the Republic of Kiribati,
p52
aVhas to wake up every morning thinking about.
p53
aVHe has bought land in Fiji as an insurance policy,
p54
aVwhat he calls, "migration with dignity,"
p55
aVbecause he knows that his people may have to leave their islands.
p56
aVAs I listened to President Tong describing the situation,
p57
aVI really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face.
p58
aVAnd as I heard him speak about the pain of his problems,
p59
aVI thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.
p60
aVI thought about her and those who worked with her
p61
aVon the Commission on Human Rights, which she chaired in 1948,
p62
aVand drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
p63
aVFor them, it would have been unimaginable
p64
aVthat a whole country could go out of existence
p65
aVbecause of human-induced climate change.
p66
aa(lp67
VI came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer,
p68
aVand I wasn't really impressed by the images of polar bears
p69
aVor melting glaciers.
p70
aVIt was because of the impact on people,
p71
aVand the impact on their rights \u2014
p72
aVtheir rights to food and safe water, health, education and shelter.
p73
aVAnd I say this with humility,
p74
aVbecause I came late to the issue of climate change.
p75
aVWhen I served
p76
aVas UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
p77
aVfrom 1997 to 2002,
p78
aVclimate change wasn't at the front of my mind.
p79
aVI don't remember making a single speech on climate change.
p80
aVI knew that there was another part of the United Nations \u2014
p81
aVthe UN Convention on Climate Change \u2014
p82
aVthat was dealing with the issue of climate change.
p83
aVIt was later when I started to work in African countries
p84
aVon issues of development and human rights.
p85
aVAnd I kept hearing this pervasive sentence:
p86
aV"Oh, but things are so much worse now, things are so much worse."
p87
aVAnd then I explored what was behind that;
p88
aVit was about changes in the climate \u2014
p89
aVclimate shocks, changes in the weather.
p90
aa(lp91
VI met Constance Okollet,
p92
aVwho had formed a women's group in Eastern Uganda,
p93
aVand she told me that when she was growing up,
p94
aVshe had a very normal life in her village and they didn't go hungry,
p95
aVthey knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come,
p96
aVthey knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest,
p97
aVand so they had enough food.
p98
aVBut, in recent years,
p99
aVat the time of this conversation,
p100
aVthey had nothing but long periods of drought,
p101
aVand then flash flooding,
p102
aVand then more drought.
p103
aVThe school had been destroyed,
p104
aVlivelihoods had been destroyed,
p105
aVtheir harvest had been destroyed.
p106
aVShe forms this women's group to try to keep her community together.
p107
aVAnd this was a reality that really struck me,
p108
aVbecause of course, Constance Okollet wasn't responsible
p109
aVfor the greenhouse gas emissions that were causing this problem.
p110
aa(lp111
VIndeed, I was very struck about the situation in Malawi
p112
aVin January of this year.
p113
aVThere was an unprecedented flooding in the country,
p114
aVit covered about a third of the country,
p115
aVover 300 people were killed,
p116
aVand hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods.
p117
aVAnd the average person in Malawi
p118
aVemits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.
p119
aVThe average US citizen emits about 17.5 metric tons.
p120
aVSo those who are suffering disproportionately
p121
aVdon't drive cars, don't have electricity, don't consume very significantly,
p122
aVand yet they are feeling more and more
p123
aVthe impacts of the changes in the climate,
p124
aVthe changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly,
p125
aVand knowing how to look after their future.
p126
aVI think it was really the importance of the injustice
p127
aVthat really struck me very forcibly.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd I know that we're not able to address some of that injustice
p130
aVbecause we're not on course for a safe world.
p131
aVGovernments around the world agreed at the conference in Copenhagen,
p132
aVand have repeated it at every conference on climate,
p133
aVthat we have to stay below two degrees Celsius
p134
aVof warming above pre-Industrial standards.
p135
aVBut we're on course for about four degrees.
p136
aVSo we face an existential threat to the future of our planet.
p137
aVAnd that made me realize
p138
aVthat climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd that brought me then to climate justice.
p141
aVClimate justice responds to the moral argument \u2014
p142
aVboth sides of the moral argument \u2014
p143
aVto address climate change.
p144
aVFirst of all,
p145
aVto be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected.
p146
aVAnd secondly,
p147
aVto make sure that they're not left behind again, when we start to move
p148
aVand start to address climate change with climate action,
p149
aVas we are doing.
p150
aa(lp151
VIn our very unequal world today,
p152
aVit's very striking how many people are left behind.
p153
aVIn our world of 7.2 billion people, about 3 billion are left behind.
p154
aV1.3 billion don't have access to electricity,
p155
aVand they light their homes with kerosene and candles,
p156
aVboth of which are dangerous.
p157
aVAnd in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting.
p158
aV2.6 billion people cook on open fires \u2014
p159
aVon coal, wood and animal dung.
p160
aVAnd this causes about 4 million deaths a year
p161
aVfrom indoor smoke inhalation,
p162
aVand of course, most of those who die are women.
p163
aVSo we have a very unequal world,
p164
aVand we need to change from "business as usual."
p165
aVAnd we shouldn't underestimate the scale and the transformative nature
p166
aVof the change which will be needed,
p167
aVbecause we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about 2050,
p168
aVif we're going to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming.
p169
aVAnd that means we have to leave about two-thirds of the known resources
p170
aVof fossil fuels in the ground.
p171
aa(lp172
VIt's a very big change,
p173
aVand it means that obviously,
p174
aVindustrialized countries must cut their emissions,
p175
aVmust become much more energy-efficient,
p176
aVand must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy.
p177
aVFor developing countries and emerging economies,
p178
aVthe problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions,
p179
aVbecause they must develop; they have very poor populations.
p180
aVSo they must develop without emissions, and that is a different kind of problem.
p181
aVIndeed, no country in the world has actually grown without emissions.
p182
aVAll the countries have developed with fossil fuels,
p183
aVand then may be moving to renewable energy.
p184
aVSo it is a very big challenge,
p185
aVand it requires the total support of the international community,
p186
aVwith the necessary finance and technology, and systems and support,
p187
aVbecause no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change.
p188
aVThis is an issue that requires complete human solidarity.
p189
aVHuman solidarity, if you like, based on self-interest \u2014
p190
aVbecause we are all in this together,
p191
aVand we have to work together
p192
aVto ensure that we reach zero carbon by 2050.
p193
aa(lp194
VThe good news is that change is happening,
p195
aVand it's happening very fast.
p196
aVHere in California,
p197
aVthere's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions.
p198
aVIn Hawaii, they're passing legislation
p199
aVto have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045.
p200
aVAnd governments are very ambitious around the world.
p201
aVIn Costa Rica, they have committed to being carbon-neutral by 2021.
p202
aVIn Ethiopia, the commitment is to be carbon-neutral by 2027.
p203
aVApple have pledged that their factories in China will use renewable energy.
p204
aVAnd there is a race on at the moment
p205
aVto convert electricity from tidal and wave power,
p206
aVin order that we can leave the coal in the ground.
p207
aVAnd that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly.
p208
aVBut it's still not enough,
p209
aVand the political will is still not enough.
p210
aa(lp211
VLet me come back to President Tong and his people in Kiribati.
p212
aVThey actually could be able to live on their island and have a solution,
p213
aVbut it would take a lot of political will.
p214
aVPresident Tong told me about his ambitious idea
p215
aVto either build up or even float the little islands where his people live.
p216
aVThis, of course, is beyond the resources of Kiribati itself.
p217
aVIt would require great solidarity and support from other countries,
p218
aVand it would require the kind of imaginative idea
p219
aVthat we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air.
p220
aVBut wouldn't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder
p221
aVand to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory,
p222
aVand be part of the community of nations?
p223
aVThat is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about.
p224
aVYes, the challenges of the transformation we need are big,
p225
aVbut they can be solved.
p226
aVWe are actually, as a people,
p227
aVvery capable of coming together to solve problems.
p228
aa(lp229
VI was very conscious of this as I took part this year
p230
aVin commemoration of the 70th anniversary
p231
aVof the end of the Second World War in 1945.
p232
aV1945 was an extraordinary year.
p233
aVIt was a year when the world faced
p234
aVwhat must have seemed almost insoluble problems \u2014
p235
aVthe devastation of the world wars, particularly the Second World War;
p236
aVthe fragile peace that had been brought about;
p237
aVthe need for a whole economic regeneration.
p238
aVBut the leaders of that time didn't flinch from this.
p239
aVThey had the capacity, they had a sense of being driven by
p240
aVnever again must the world have this kind of problem.
p241
aVAnd they had to build structures for peace and security.
p242
aVAnd what did we get? What did they achieve?
p243
aVThe Charter of the United Nations,
p244
aVthe Bretton Woods institutions, as they're called, The World Bank,
p245
aVand the International Monetary Fund.
p246
aVA Marshall Plan for Europe, a devastated Europe,
p247
aVto reconstruct it.
p248
aVAnd indeed a few years later,
p249
aVthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
p250
aa(lp251
V2015 is a year that is similar in its importance
p252
aVto 1945, with similar challenges and similar potential.
p253
aVThere will be two big summits this year:
p254
aVthe first one, in September in New York,
p255
aVis the summit for the sustainable development goals.
p256
aVAnd then the summit in Paris in December, to give us a climate agreement.
p257
aVThe sustainable development goals are intended to help countries
p258
aVto live sustainably, in tune with Mother Earth,
p259
aVnot to take out of Mother Earth and destroy ecosystems,
p260
aVbut rather, to live in harmony with Mother Earth,
p261
aVby living under sustainable development.
p262
aVAnd the sustainable development goals
p263
aVwill come into operation for all countries
p264
aVon January 1, 2016.
p265
aVThe climate agreement \u2014
p266
aVa binding climate agreement \u2014
p267
aVis needed because of the scientific evidence
p268
aVthat we're on a trajectory for about a four-degree world
p269
aVand we have to change course to stay below two degrees.
p270
aVSo we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed,
p271
aVso that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions,
p272
aVand how we move more rapidly to renewable energy,
p273
aVso that we have a safe world.
p274
aa(lp275
VThe reality is that this issue is much too important
p276
aVto be left to politicians and to the United Nations.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VIt's an issue for all of us,
p281
aVand it's an issue where we need more and more momentum.
p282
aVIndeed, the face of the environmentalist has changed,
p283
aVbecause of the justice dimension.
p284
aVIt's now an issue for faith-based organizations,
p285
aVunder very good leadership from Pope Francis,
p286
aVand indeed, the Church of England,
p287
aVwhich is divesting from fossil fuels.
p288
aVIt's an issue for the business community,
p289
aVand the good news is
p290
aVthat the business community is changing very rapidly \u2014
p291
aVexcept for the fossil fuel industries \u2014
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VEven they are beginning to slightly change their language \u2014
p296
aVbut only slightly.
p297
aVBut business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy,
p298
aVbut is urging politicians to give them more signals,
p299
aVso that they can move even more rapidly.
p300
aVIt's an issue for the trade union movement.
p301
aVIt's an issue for the women's movement.
p302
aVIt's an issue for young people.
p303
aa(lp304
VI was very struck when I learned that Jibreel Khazan,
p305
aVone of the Greensboro Four who had taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins,
p306
aVsaid quite recently that
p307
aVclimate change is the lunch counter moment for young people.
p308
aVSo, lunch counter moment for young people of the 21st century \u2014
p309
aVthe sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century,
p310
aVbecause he said it is the greatest challenge
p311
aVto humanity and justice in our world.
p312
aa(lp313
VI recall very much the Climate March last September,
p314
aVand that was a huge momentum,
p315
aVnot just in New York, but all around the world.
p316
aVand we have to build on that.
p317
aVI was marching with some of The Elders family,
p318
aVand I saw a placard a little bit away from me,
p319
aVbut we were wedged so closely together \u2014
p320
aVbecause after all, there were 400,000 people out in the streets of New York \u2014
p321
aVso I couldn't quite get to that placard,
p322
aVI would have just liked to have been able to step behind it,
p323
aVbecause it said, "Angry Grannies!"
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VThat's what I felt.
p328
aVAnd I have five grandchildren now,
p329
aVI feel very happy as an Irish grandmother to have five grandchildren,
p330
aVand I think about their world,
p331
aVand what it will be like when they will share that world
p332
aVwith about 9 billion other people in 2050.
p333
aVWe know that inevitably it will be a climate-constrained world,
p334
aVbecause of the emissions we've already put up there,
p335
aVbut it could be a world that is much more equal and much fairer,
p336
aVand much better for health, and better for jobs
p337
aVand better for energy security,
p338
aVthan the world we have now,
p339
aVif we have switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy,
p340
aVand no one is left behind.
p341
aVNo one is left behind.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd just as we've been looking back this year \u2014
p344
aVin 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years \u2014
p345
aVI would like to think that they will look back,
p346
aVthat world will look back 35 years from 2050,
p347
aV35 years to 2015,
p348
aVand that they will say,
p349
aV"Weren't they good to do what they did in 2015?
p350
aVWe really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference,
p351
aVand that put the world on the right pathway,
p352
aVand we benefit now from that pathway,"
p353
aVthat they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities,
p354
aVwe did what was done in 1945 in similar terms,
p355
aVwe didn't miss the opportunity,
p356
aVwe lived up to our responsibilities.
p357
aVThat's what this year is about.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd somehow for me,
p360
aVit's captured in words of somebody that I admired very much.
p361
aVShe was a mentor of mine, she was a friend,
p362
aVshe died much too young,
p363
aVshe was an extraordinary personality,
p364
aVa great champion of the environment:
p365
aVWangari Maathai.
p366
aVWangari said once,
p367
aV"In the course of history,
p368
aVthere comes a time when humanity is called upon
p369
aVto shift to a new level of consciousness,
p370
aVto reach a higher moral ground."
p371
aVAnd that's what we have to do.
p372
aVWe have to reach a new level of consciousness,
p373
aVa higher moral ground.
p374
aVAnd we have to do it this year in those two big summits.
p375
aVAnd that won't happen unless we have the momentum
p376
aVfrom people around the world who say:
p377
aV"We want action now,
p378
aVwe want to change course,
p379
aVwe want a safe world,
p380
aVa safe world for future generations,
p381
aVa safe world for our children and our grandchildren,
p382
aVand we're all in this together."
p383
aa(lp384
VThank you.

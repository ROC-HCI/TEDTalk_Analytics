VI'm going to talk today about saving more,
p5
aVbut not today, tomorrow.
p6
aVI'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.
p7
aVIt's a program that Richard Thaler
p8
aVfrom the University of Chicago and I
p9
aVdevised maybe 15 years ago.
p10
aVThe program, in a sense,
p11
aVis an example of behavioral finance
p12
aVon steroids \u2014
p13
aVhow we could really use behavioral finance.
p14
aVNow you might ask, what is behavioral finance?
p15
aVSo let's think about how we manage our money.
p16
aVLet's start with mortgages.
p17
aVIt's kind of a recent topic,
p18
aVat least in the U.S.
p19
aVA lot of people buy
p20
aVthe biggest house they can afford,
p21
aVand actually slightly bigger than that.
p22
aVAnd then they foreclose.
p23
aVAnd then they blame the banks
p24
aVfor being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages.
p25
aa(lp26
VLet's also think about
p27
aVhow we manage risks \u2014
p28
aVfor example, investing in the stock market.
p29
aVTwo years ago, three years ago, about four years ago,
p30
aVmarkets did well.
p31
aVWe were risk takers, of course.
p32
aVThen market stocks seize
p33
aVand we're like, "Wow.
p34
aVThese losses, they feel, emotionally,
p35
aVthey feel very different
p36
aVfrom what we actually thought about it
p37
aVwhen markets were going up."
p38
aVSo we're probably not doing a great job
p39
aVwhen it comes to risk taking.
p40
aa(lp41
VHow many of you have iPhones?
p42
aVAnyone? Wonderful.
p43
aVI would bet many more of you
p44
aVinsure your iPhone \u2014
p45
aVyou're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty.
p46
aVWhat if you lose your iPhone?
p47
aVWhat if you do this?
p48
aVHow many of you have kids?
p49
aVAnyone?
p50
aVKeep your hands up
p51
aVif you have sufficient life insurance.
p52
aVI see a lot of hands coming down.
p53
aVI would predict,
p54
aVif you're a representative sample,
p55
aVthat many more of you
p56
aVinsure your iPhones than your lives,
p57
aVeven when you have kids.
p58
aVWe're not doing that well when it comes to insurance.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe average American household
p61
aVspends 1,000 dollars a year
p62
aVon lotteries.
p63
aVAnd I know it sounds crazy.
p64
aVHow many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries?
p65
aVNo one.
p66
aVSo that tells us that the people not in this room
p67
aVare spending more than a thousand
p68
aVto get the average to a thousand.
p69
aVLow-income people
p70
aVspend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries.
p71
aVSo where does it take us?
p72
aVWe're not doing a great job managing money.
p73
aa(lp74
VBehavioral finance is really a combination
p75
aVof psychology and economics,
p76
aVtrying to understand
p77
aVthe money mistakes people make.
p78
aVAnd I can keep standing here
p79
aVfor the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that I have left
p80
aVand make fun of all sorts of ways
p81
aVwe manage money,
p82
aVand at the end you're going to ask, "How can we help people?"
p83
aVAnd that's what I really want to focus on today.
p84
aVHow do we take an understanding
p85
aVof the money mistakes people make,
p86
aVand then turning the behavioral challenges
p87
aVinto behavioral solutions?
p88
aVAnd what I'm going to talk about today
p89
aVis Save More Tomorrow.
p90
aa(lp91
VI want to address the issue
p92
aVof savings.
p93
aVWe have on the screen
p94
aVa representative sample
p95
aVof 100 Americans.
p96
aVAnd we're going to look at their saving behavior.
p97
aVFirst thing to notice is,
p98
aVhalf of them
p99
aVdo not even have access
p100
aVto a 401(k) plan.
p101
aVThey cannot make savings easy.
p102
aVThey cannot have money go away from their paycheck
p103
aVinto a 401(k) plan
p104
aVbefore they see it,
p105
aVbefore they can touch it.
p106
aVWhat about the remaining half of the people?
p107
aVSome of them elect not to save.
p108
aVThey're just too lazy.
p109
aVThey never get around to logging into a complicated website
p110
aVand doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan.
p111
aVAnd then they have to decide how they're going to invest
p112
aVin their 52 choices,
p113
aVand they never heard about what is a money market fund.
p114
aVAnd they get overwhelmed and the just don't join.
p115
aVHow many people end up saving to a 401(k) plan?
p116
aVOne third of Americans.
p117
aVTwo thirds are not saving now.
p118
aa(lp119
VAre they saving enough?
p120
aVTake out those
p121
aVwho say they save too little.
p122
aVOne out of 10
p123
aVare saving enough.
p124
aVNine out of 10
p125
aVeither cannot save through their 401(k) plan,
p126
aVdecide not to save \u2014 or don't decide \u2014
p127
aVor save too little.
p128
aVWe think we have a problem
p129
aVof people saving too much.
p130
aVLet's look at that.
p131
aVWe have one person \u2014
p132
aVwell, actually we're going to slice him in half
p133
aVbecause it's less than one percent.
p134
aVRoughly half a percent of Americans
p135
aVfeel that they save too much.
p136
aa(lp137
VWhat are we going to do about it?
p138
aVThat's what I really want to focus on.
p139
aVWe have to understand
p140
aVwhy people are not saving,
p141
aVand then we can hopefully flip
p142
aVthe behavioral challenges
p143
aVinto behavioral solutions,
p144
aVand then see how powerful it might be.
p145
aVSo let me divert for a second
p146
aVas we're going to identify the problems,
p147
aVthe challenges, the behavioral challenges,
p148
aVthat prevent people from saving.
p149
aVI'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate.
p150
aa(lp151
VSuppose we had another wonderful TED event next week.
p152
aVAnd during the break
p153
aVthere would be a snack
p154
aVand you could choose bananas or chocolate.
p155
aVHow many of you think you would like to have bananas
p156
aVduring this hypothetical TED event next week?
p157
aVWho would go for bananas?
p158
aVWonderful.
p159
aVI predict scientifically
p160
aV74 percent of you will go for bananas.
p161
aVWell that's at least what one wonderful study predicted.
p162
aVAnd then count down the days
p163
aVand see what people ended up eating.
p164
aVThe same people that imagined themselves
p165
aVeating the bananas
p166
aVended up eating chocolates
p167
aVa week later.
p168
aa(lp169
VSelf-control
p170
aVis not a problem in the future.
p171
aVIt's only a problem now
p172
aVwhen the chocolate is next to us.
p173
aVWhat does it have to do with time and savings,
p174
aVthis issue of immediate gratification?
p175
aVOr as some economists call it, present bias.
p176
aVWe think about saving. We know we should be saving.
p177
aVWe know we'll do it next year, but today let us go and spend.
p178
aVChristmas is coming,
p179
aVwe might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know.
p180
aVSo this issue of present bias
p181
aVcauses us to think about saving,
p182
aVbut end up spending.
p183
aa(lp184
VLet me now talk
p185
aVabout another behavioral obstacle to saving
p186
aVhaving to do with inertia.
p187
aVBut again, a little diversion
p188
aVto the topic of organ donation.
p189
aVWonderful study comparing different countries.
p190
aVWe're going to look at two similar countries,
p191
aVGermany and Austria.
p192
aVAnd in Germany,
p193
aVif you would like to donate your organs \u2014
p194
aVGod forbid something really bad
p195
aVhappens to you \u2014
p196
aVwhen you get your driving license or an I.D.,
p197
aVyou check the box saying,
p198
aV"I would like to donate my organs."
p199
aVNot many people like checking boxes.
p200
aVIt takes effort. You need to think.
p201
aVTwelve percent do.
p202
aVAustria, a neighboring country,
p203
aVslightly similar, slightly different.
p204
aVWhat's the difference?
p205
aVWell, you still have choice.
p206
aVYou will decide
p207
aVwhether you want to donate your organs or not.
p208
aVBut when you get your driving license,
p209
aVyou check the box
p210
aVif you do not want to donate your organ.
p211
aVNobody checks boxes.
p212
aVThat's kind of too much effort.
p213
aVOne percent check the box. The rest do nothing.
p214
aVDoing nothing is very common.
p215
aVNot many people check boxes.
p216
aa(lp217
VWhat are the implications
p218
aVto saving lives
p219
aVand having organs available?
p220
aVIn Germany, 12 percent check the box.
p221
aVTwelve percent are organ donors.
p222
aVHuge shortage of organs,
p223
aVGod forbid, if you need one.
p224
aVIn Austria, again, nobody checks the box.
p225
aVTherefore, 99 percent of people
p226
aVare organ donors.
p227
aVInertia, lack of action.
p228
aVWhat is the default setting
p229
aVif people do nothing,
p230
aVif they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes?
p231
aVVery powerful.
p232
aVWe're going to talk
p233
aVabout what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared
p234
aVto make their 401(k) choices.
p235
aVAre we going to make them automatically join the plan,
p236
aVor are they going to be left out?
p237
aVIn too many 401(k) plans,
p238
aVif people do nothing,
p239
aVit means they're not saving for retirement,
p240
aVif they don't check the box.
p241
aVAnd checking the box takes effort.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges.
p244
aVOne more before we flip the challenges into solutions,
p245
aVhaving to do with monkeys and apples.
p246
aVNo, no, no, this is a real study
p247
aVand it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics.
p248
aVOne group of monkeys gets an apple, they're pretty happy.
p249
aVThe other group gets two apples, one is taken away.
p250
aVThey still have an apple left.
p251
aVThey're really mad.
p252
aVWhy have you taken our apple?
p253
aVThis is the notion of loss aversion.
p254
aVWe hate losing stuff,
p255
aVeven if it doesn't mean a lot of risk.
p256
aVYou would hate to go to the ATM,
p257
aVtake out 100 dollars
p258
aVand notice that you lost one of those $20 bills.
p259
aVIt's very painful,
p260
aVeven though it doesn't mean anything.
p261
aVThose 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch.
p262
aVSo this notion of loss aversion
p263
aVkicks in when it comes to savings too,
p264
aVbecause people, mentally
p265
aVand emotionally and intuitively
p266
aVframe savings as a loss
p267
aVbecause I have to cut my spending.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo we talked about
p270
aVall sorts of behavioral challenges
p271
aVhaving to do with savings eventually.
p272
aVWhether you think about immediate gratification,
p273
aVand the chocolates versus bananas,
p274
aVit's just painful to save now.
p275
aVIt's a lot more fun
p276
aVto spend now.
p277
aVWe talked about inertia and organ donations
p278
aVand checking the box.
p279
aVIf people have to check a lot of boxes
p280
aVto join a 401(k) plan,
p281
aVthey're going to keep procrastinating
p282
aVand not join.
p283
aVAnd last, we talked about loss aversion,
p284
aVand the monkeys and the apples.
p285
aVIf people frame mentally
p286
aVsaving for retirement as a loss,
p287
aVthey're not going to be saving for retirement.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo we've got these challenges,
p290
aVand what Richard Thaler and I
p291
aVwere always fascinated by \u2014
p292
aVtake behavioral finance,
p293
aVmake it behavioral finance on steroids
p294
aVor behavioral finance 2.0
p295
aVor behavioral finance in action \u2014
p296
aVflip the challenges into solutions.
p297
aVAnd we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution
p298
aVcalled Save More, not today, Tomorrow.
p299
aVHow is it going to solve the challenges
p300
aVwe chatted about?
p301
aVIf you think about the problem
p302
aVof bananas versus chocolates,
p303
aVwe think we're going to eat bananas next week.
p304
aVWe think we're going to save more next year.
p305
aVSave More Tomorrow
p306
aVinvites employees
p307
aVto save more maybe next year \u2014
p308
aVsometime in the future
p309
aVwhen we can imagine ourselves
p310
aVeating bananas,
p311
aVvolunteering more in the community,
p312
aVexercising more and doing all the right things on the planet.
p313
aa(lp314
VNow we also talked about checking the box
p315
aVand the difficulty of taking action.
p316
aVSave More Tomorrow
p317
aVmakes it easy.
p318
aVIt's an autopilot.
p319
aVOnce you tell me you would like to save more in the future,
p320
aVlet's say every January
p321
aVyou're going to be saving more automatically
p322
aVand it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401(k) plan
p323
aVbefore you see it, before you touch it,
p324
aVbefore you get the issue
p325
aVof immediate gratification.
p326
aVBut what are we going to do about the monkeys
p327
aVand loss aversion?
p328
aVNext January comes
p329
aVand people might feel that if they save more,
p330
aVthey have to spend less, and that's painful.
p331
aVWell, maybe it shouldn't be just January.
p332
aVMaybe we should make people save more
p333
aVwhen they make more money.
p334
aVThat way, when they make more money, when they get a pay raise,
p335
aVthey don't have to cut their spending.
p336
aVThey take a little bit
p337
aVof the increase in the paycheck home
p338
aVand spend more \u2014
p339
aVtake a little bit of the increase
p340
aVand put it in a 401(k) plan.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo that is the program,
p343
aVembarrassingly simple,
p344
aVbut as we're going to see,
p345
aVextremely powerful.
p346
aVWe first implemented it,
p347
aVRichard Thaler and I,
p348
aVback in 1998.
p349
aVMid-sized company in the Midwest,
p350
aVblue collar employees
p351
aVstruggling to pay their bills
p352
aVrepeatedly told us
p353
aVthey cannot save more right away.
p354
aVSaving more today is not an option.
p355
aVWe invited them to save
p356
aVthree percentage points more
p357
aVevery time they get a pay raise.
p358
aVAnd here are the results.
p359
aVWe're seeing here a three and a half-year period,
p360
aVfour pay raises,
p361
aVpeople who were struggling to save,
p362
aVwere saving three percent of their paycheck,
p363
aVthree and a half years later
p364
aVsaving almost four times as much,
p365
aValmost 14 percent.
p366
aa(lp367
VAnd there's shoes and bicycles
p368
aVand things on this chart
p369
aVbecause I don't want to just throw numbers
p370
aVin a vacuum.
p371
aVI want, really, to think about the fact
p372
aVthat saving four times more
p373
aVis a huge difference
p374
aVin terms of the lifestyle
p375
aVthat people will be able to afford.
p376
aVIt's real.
p377
aVIt's not just numbers on a piece of paper.
p378
aVWhereas with saving three percent,
p379
aVpeople might have to add nice sneakers
p380
aVso they can walk,
p381
aVbecause they won't be able to afford anything else,
p382
aVwhen they save 14 percent
p383
aVthey might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes
p384
aVto walk to the car to drive.
p385
aVThis is a real difference.
p386
aVBy now, about 60 percent of the large companies
p387
aVactually have programs like this in place.
p388
aVIt's been part of the Pension Protection Act.
p389
aVAnd needless to say that Thaler and I
p390
aVhave been blessed to be part of this program
p391
aVand make a difference.
p392
aa(lp393
VLet me wrap
p394
aVwith two key messages.
p395
aVOne is behavioral finance
p396
aVis extremely powerful.
p397
aVThis is just one example.
p398
aVMessage two
p399
aVis there's still a lot to do.
p400
aVThis is really the tip of the iceberg.
p401
aVIf you think about people and mortgages
p402
aVand buying houses and then not being able to pay for it,
p403
aVwe need to think about that.
p404
aVIf you're thinking about people taking too much risk
p405
aVand not understanding how much risk they're taking
p406
aVor taking too little risk,
p407
aVwe need to think about that.
p408
aVIf you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year
p409
aVon lottery tickets,
p410
aVwe need to think about that.
p411
aVThe average actually,
p412
aVthe record is in Singapore.
p413
aVThe average household
p414
aVspends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets.
p415
aVWe've got a lot to do,
p416
aVa lot to solve,
p417
aValso in the retirement area
p418
aVwhen it comes to what people do with their money
p419
aVafter retirement.
p420
aa(lp421
VOne last question:
p422
aVHow many of you feel comfortable
p423
aVthat as you're planning for retirement
p424
aVyou have a really solid plan
p425
aVwhen you're going to retire,
p426
aVwhen you're going to claim Social Security benefits,
p427
aVwhat lifestyle to expect,
p428
aVhow much to spend every month
p429
aVso you're not going to run out of money?
p430
aVHow many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future
p431
aVwhen it comes to post-retirement decisions.
p432
aVOne, two, three, four.
p433
aVLess than three percent
p434
aVof a very sophisticated audience.
p435
aVBehavioral finance has a long way.
p436
aVThere's a lot of opportunities
p437
aVto make it powerful again and again and again.
p438
aa(lp439
VThank you.

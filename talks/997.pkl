VSo there are a few things
p5
aVthat bring us humans together in the way that an election does.
p6
aVWe stand in elections; we vote in elections;
p7
aVwe observe elections.
p8
aVOur democracies rely on elections.
p9
aVWe all understand why we have elections,
p10
aVand we all leave the house on the same day
p11
aVto go and vote.
p12
aVWe cherish the opportunity to have our say,
p13
aVto help decide the future of the country.
p14
aVThe fundamental idea is that politicians
p15
aVare given mandate to speak for us,
p16
aVto make decisions on our behalf
p17
aVthat affect us all.
p18
aVWithout that mandate, they would be corrupt.
p19
aa(lp20
VWell unfortunately, power corrupts,
p21
aVand so people will do lots of things
p22
aVto get power and to stay in power,
p23
aVincluding doing bad things to elections.
p24
aVYou see, even if the idea
p25
aVof the election is perfect,
p26
aVrunning a countrywide election is a big project,
p27
aVand big projects are messy.
p28
aVWhenever there is an election,
p29
aVit seems like something always goes wrong,
p30
aVsomeone tries to cheat,
p31
aVor something goes accidentally awry \u2014
p32
aVa ballot box goes missing here,
p33
aVchads are left hanging over here.
p34
aa(lp35
VTo make sure as few things as possible go wrong,
p36
aVwe have all these procedures around the election.
p37
aVSo for example, you come to the polling station,
p38
aVand a poll station worker asks for your ID
p39
aVbefore giving you a ballot form
p40
aVand asking you to go into a voting booth
p41
aVto fill out your vote.
p42
aVWhen you come back out, you get to drop your vote
p43
aVinto the ballot box
p44
aVwhere it mixes with all the other votes,
p45
aVso that no one knows how you voted.
p46
aa(lp47
VWell, what I want us to think about for a moment
p48
aVis what happens after that,
p49
aVafter you drop your vote into the ballot box.
p50
aVAnd most people would go home
p51
aVand feel sure that their vote has been counted,
p52
aVbecause they trust
p53
aVthat the election system works.
p54
aVThey trust that election workers and election observers
p55
aVdo their jobs and do their jobs correctly.
p56
aVThe ballot boxes go to counting places.
p57
aVThey're unsealed and the votes are poured out
p58
aVand laboriously counted.
p59
aVMost of us have to trust
p60
aVthat that happens correctly for our own vote,
p61
aVand we all have to trust that that happens correctly
p62
aVfor all the votes in the election.
p63
aVSo we have to trust a lot of people.
p64
aVWe have to trust a lot of procedures.
p65
aVAnd sometimes we even have to trust computers.
p66
aVSo imagine hundreds of millions of voters
p67
aVcasting hundreds of millions of votes,
p68
aVall to be counted correctly
p69
aVand all the things that can possibly go wrong
p70
aVcausing all these bad headlines,
p71
aVand you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea
p72
aVof trying to make elections better.
p73
aa(lp74
VWell in the face of all these bad headlines,
p75
aVresearchers have taken a step back
p76
aVand thought about how we can do elections differently.
p77
aVThey've zoomed out and looked at the big picture.
p78
aVAnd the big picture is this:
p79
aVelections should be verifiable.
p80
aVVoters should be able to check
p81
aVthat their votes are counted correctly,
p82
aVwithout breaking election secrecy,
p83
aVwhich is so very important.
p84
aVAnd that's the tough part.
p85
aVHow do we make an election system completely verifiable
p86
aVwhile keeping the votes
p87
aVabsolutely secret?
p88
aa(lp89
VWell, the way we've come up with
p90
aVuses computers
p91
aVbut doesn't depend on them.
p92
aVAnd the secret is the ballot form.
p93
aVAnd if you look closely at these ballot forms,
p94
aVyou'll notice that the candidate list
p95
aVis in a different order on each one.
p96
aVAnd that means, if you mark your choices on one of them
p97
aVand then remove the candidate list,
p98
aVI won't be able to tell from the bit remaining
p99
aVwhat your vote is for.
p100
aVAnd on each ballot form there is this encrypted value
p101
aVin the form of this 2D barcode
p102
aVon the right.
p103
aVAnd there's some complicated cryptography
p104
aVgoing on in there,
p105
aVbut what's not complicated
p106
aVis voting with one of these forms.
p107
aVSo we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us,
p108
aVand then we'll use the paper for verification.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo this is how you vote.
p111
aVYou get one of these ballot forms at random,
p112
aVand then you go into the voting booth,
p113
aVand you mark your choices,
p114
aVand you tear along a perforation.
p115
aVAnd you shred the candidate list.
p116
aVAnd the bit that remains, the one with your marks \u2014
p117
aVthis is your encrypted vote.
p118
aVSo you let a poll station worker
p119
aVscan your encrypted vote.
p120
aVAnd because it's encrypted,
p121
aVit can be submitted, stored
p122
aVand counted centrally
p123
aVand displayed on a website
p124
aVfor anyone to see, including you.
p125
aVSo you take this encrypted vote
p126
aVhome as your receipt.
p127
aVAnd after the close of the election,
p128
aVyou can check that your vote was counted
p129
aVby comparing your receipt
p130
aVto the vote on the website.
p131
aVAnd remember, the vote is encrypted
p132
aVfrom the moment you leave the voting booth,
p133
aVso if an election official wants to find out how you voted,
p134
aVthey will not be able to.
p135
aVIf the government wants to find out how you voted,
p136
aVthey won't be able to.
p137
aVNo hacker can break in
p138
aVand find out how you voted.
p139
aVNo hacker can break in and change your vote,
p140
aVbecause then it won't match your receipt.
p141
aVVotes can't go missing
p142
aVbecause then you won't find yours when you look for it.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut the election magic doesn't stop there.
p145
aVInstead, we want to make the whole process
p146
aVso transparent
p147
aVthat news media and international observers
p148
aVand anyone who wants to
p149
aVcan download all the election data
p150
aVand do the count themselves.
p151
aVThey can check that all the votes were counted correctly.
p152
aVThey can check
p153
aVthat the announced result of the election
p154
aVis the correct one.
p155
aVAnd these are elections
p156
aVby the people, for the people.
p157
aVSo the next step for our democracies
p158
aVare transparent
p159
aVand verifiable elections.
p160
aa(lp161
VThank you.

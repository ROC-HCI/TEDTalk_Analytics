VThe world makes you something that you're not,
p5
aVbut you know inside what you are,
p6
aVand that question burns in your heart:
p7
aVHow will you become that?
p8
aVI may be somewhat unique in this,
p9
aVbut I am not alone,
p10
aVnot alone at all.
p11
aVSo when I became a fashion model,
p12
aVI felt that I'd finally achieved the dream
p13
aVthat I'd always wanted since I was a young child.
p14
aVMy outside self finally matched my inner truth,
p15
aVmy inner self.
p16
aVFor complicated reasons which I'll get to later,
p17
aVwhen I look at this picture,
p18
aVat that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it,
p19
aVyou've made it,
p20
aVyou have arrived.
p21
aVBut this past October,
p22
aVI realized that I'm only just beginning.
p23
aVAll of us are put in boxes by our family,
p24
aVby our religion,
p25
aVby our society,
p26
aVour moment in history,
p27
aVeven our own bodies.
p28
aVSome people have the courage to break free,
p29
aVnot to accept the limitations imposed by
p30
aVthe color of their skin
p31
aVor by the beliefs of those that surround them.
p32
aVThose people are always the threat
p33
aVto the status quo,
p34
aVto what is considered acceptable.
p35
aa(lp36
VIn my case, for the last nine years,
p37
aVsome of my neighbors,
p38
aVsome of my friends, colleagues, even my agent,
p39
aVdid not know about my history.
p40
aVI think, in mystery, this is called the reveal.
p41
aVHere is mine.
p42
aa(lp43
VI was assigned boy at birth
p44
aVbased on the appearance of my genitalia.
p45
aVI remember when I was five years old
p46
aVin the Philippines walking around our house,
p47
aVI would always wear this t-shirt on my head.
p48
aVAnd my mom asked me,
p49
aV"How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head?"
p50
aVI said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."
p51
aVI knew then how to self-identify.
p52
aa(lp53
VGender has always been considered a fact,
p54
aVimmutable,
p55
aVbut we now know it's actually more fluid,
p56
aVcomplex and mysterious.
p57
aVBecause of my success, I never had the courage
p58
aVto share my story,
p59
aVnot because I thought what I am is wrong,
p60
aVbut because of how the world treats those of us
p61
aVwho wish to break free.
p62
aVEvery day,
p63
aVI am so grateful because I am a woman.
p64
aVI have a mom and dad and family
p65
aVwho accepted me for who I am.
p66
aVMany are not so fortunate.
p67
aa(lp68
VThere's a long tradition in Asian culture
p69
aVthat celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.
p70
aVThere is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
p71
aVThere is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.
p72
aVSo when I was eight years old,
p73
aVI was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating
p74
aVthese mysteries.
p75
aVI was in front of the stage,
p76
aVand I remember, out comes this beautiful woman
p77
aVright in front of me,
p78
aVand I remember that moment something hit me:
p79
aVThat is the kind of woman I would like to be.
p80
aVSo when I was 15 years old,
p81
aVstill dressing as a boy,
p82
aVI met this woman named T.L.
p83
aVShe is a transgender beauty pageant manager.
p84
aVThat night she asked me,
p85
aV"How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?"
p86
aVShe convinced me that if I joined
p87
aVthat she would take care of the registration fee
p88
aVand the garments,
p89
aVand that night,
p90
aVI won best in swimsuit
p91
aVand best in long gown
p92
aVand placed second runner up
p93
aVamong 40-plus candidates.
p94
aVThat moment changed my life.
p95
aVAll of a sudden, I was introduced
p96
aVto the world of beauty pageants.
p97
aVNot a lot of people could say that your first job
p98
aVis a pageant queen for transgender women,
p99
aVbut I'll take it.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo from 15 to 17 years old, I joined
p102
aVthe most prestigious pageant
p103
aVto the pageant where it's at the back of the truck, literally,
p104
aVor sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field,
p105
aVand when it rains \u2014
p106
aVit rains a lot in the Philippines \u2014
p107
aVthe organizers would have to move it
p108
aVinside someone's house.
p109
aVI also experienced the goodness of strangers,
p110
aVespecially when we would travel
p111
aVin remote provinces in the Philippines.
p112
aVBut most importantly, I met
p113
aVsome of my best friends in that community.
p114
aa(lp115
VIn 2001,
p116
aVmy mom, who had moved to San Francisco,
p117
aVcalled me and told me that my green card petition came through,
p118
aVthat I could now move to the United States.
p119
aVI resisted it.
p120
aVI told my mom, "Mom, I'm having fun.
p121
aVI'm here with my friends,
p122
aVI love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."
p123
aVBut then two weeks later she called me, she said,
p124
aV"Did you know that if you move to the United States
p125
aVyou could change your name and gender marker?"
p126
aVThat was all I needed to hear.
p127
aVMy mom also told me to put two E's
p128
aVin the spelling of my name.
p129
aVShe also came with me when I had my surgery
p130
aVin Thailand at 19 years old.
p131
aVIt's interesting, in some of the most rural cities in Thailand,
p132
aVthey perform some of the most prestigious,
p133
aVsafe and sophisticated surgery.
p134
aVAt that time in the United States,
p135
aVyou needed to have surgery
p136
aVbefore you could change your name and gender marker.
p137
aVSo in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,
p138
aVand I remember looking at my California driver's license
p139
aVwith the name Geena
p140
aVand gender marker F.
p141
aVThat was a powerful moment.
p142
aVFor some people,
p143
aVtheir I.D. is their license to drive
p144
aVor even to get a drink,
p145
aVbut for me, that was my license to live,
p146
aVto feel dignified.
p147
aVAll of a sudden, my fears were minimized.
p148
aVI felt that I could conquer my dream
p149
aVand move to New York and be a model.
p150
aa(lp151
VMany are not so fortunate.
p152
aVI think of this woman named Islan Nettles.
p153
aVShe's from New York, she's a young woman
p154
aVwho was courageously living her truth,
p155
aVbut hatred ended her life.
p156
aVFor most of my community,
p157
aVthis is the reality in which we live.
p158
aVOur suicide rate is nine times higher
p159
aVthan that of the general population.
p160
aVEvery November 20,
p161
aVwe have a global vigil
p162
aVfor Transgender Day of Remembrance.
p163
aVI'm here at this stage
p164
aVbecause it's a long history of people who fought
p165
aVand stood up for injustice.
p166
aVThis is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.
p167
aVToday, this very moment,
p168
aVis my real coming out.
p169
aVI could no longer live my truth
p170
aVfor and by myself.
p171
aVI want to do my best to help others
p172
aVlive their truth without shame and terror.
p173
aVI am here, exposed,
p174
aVso that one day there will never be a need
p175
aVfor a November 20 vigil.
p176
aa(lp177
VMy deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.
p178
aVWill you?
p179
aa(lp180
VThank you very much.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Applause)
p183
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VKathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you.
p186
aVI'm wondering what you would say,
p187
aVespecially to parents,
p188
aVbut in a more broad way, to friends,
p189
aVto family, to anyone who finds themselves
p190
aVencountering a child or a person
p191
aVwho is struggling with and uncomfortable with
p192
aVa gender that's being assigned them,
p193
aVwhat might you say
p194
aVto the family members of that person
p195
aVto help them become good and caring and kind
p196
aVfamily members to them?
p197
aa(lp198
VGeena Rocero: Sure. Well, first, really, I'm so blessed.
p199
aVThe support system, with my mom especially,
p200
aVand my family, that in itself
p201
aVis just so powerful.
p202
aVI remember every time I would coach
p203
aVyoung trans women, I would mentor them,
p204
aVand sometimes when they would call me
p205
aVand tell me that their parents can't accept it,
p206
aVI would pick up that phone call and tell my mom,
p207
aV"Mom, can you call this woman?"
p208
aVAnd sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so \u2014
p209
aVBut it's just, gender identity
p210
aVis in the core of our being, right?
p211
aVI mean, we're all assigned gender at birth,
p212
aVso what I'm trying to do
p213
aVis to have this conversation that
p214
aVsometimes that gender assignment doesn't match,
p215
aVand there should be a space
p216
aVthat would allow people to self-identify,
p217
aVand that's a conversation that we should have
p218
aVwith parents, with colleagues.
p219
aVThe transgender movement,
p220
aVit's at the very beginning,
p221
aVto compare to how the gay movement started.
p222
aVThere's still a lot of work that needs to be done.
p223
aVThere should be an understanding.
p224
aVThere should be a space of curiosity
p225
aVand asking questions,
p226
aVand I hope all of you guys will be my allies.
p227
aa(lp228
VKS: Thank you. That was so lovely. GR: Thank you.

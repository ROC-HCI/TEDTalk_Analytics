VA year ago, I spoke to you about a book
p5
aVthat I was just in the process of completing,
p6
aVthat has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today
p7
aVabout some of the controversies that that book inspired.
p8
aVThe book is called "The Blank Slate,"
p9
aVbased on the popular idea
p10
aVthat the human mind is a blank slate,
p11
aVand that all of its structure comes from
p12
aVsocialization, culture, parenting, experience.
p13
aVThe "blank slate" was an influential idea in the 20th century.
p14
aVHere are a few quotes indicating that:
p15
aV"Man has no nature," from the historian
p16
aVJose Ortega y Gasset;
p17
aV"Man has no instincts," from the
p18
aVanthropologist Ashley Montagu;
p19
aV"The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors
p20
aVand predisposed to none," from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould.
p21
aa(lp22
VThere are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind
p23
aVis a blank slate,
p24
aVand some of them just come from common sense.
p25
aVAs many people have told me over the years,
p26
aVanyone who's had more than one child
p27
aVknows that kids come into the world
p28
aVwith certain temperaments and talents;
p29
aVit doesn't all come from the outside.
p30
aVOh, and anyone who
p31
aVhas both a child and a house pet
p32
aVhas surely noticed that the child, exposed to speech,
p33
aVwill acquire a human language,
p34
aVwhereas the house pet won't,
p35
aVpresumably because of some innate different between them.
p36
aVAnd anyone who's ever been
p37
aVin a heterosexual relationship knows that
p38
aVthe minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable.
p39
aVThere are also, I think,
p40
aVincreasing results from
p41
aVthe scientific study of humans
p42
aVthat, indeed, we're not born blank slates.
p43
aVOne of them, from anthropology,
p44
aVis the study of human universals.
p45
aVIf you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a \u2014
p46
aVkind of an occupational
p47
aVpleasure of anthropologists to show
p48
aVhow exotic other cultures can be,
p49
aVand that there are places out there where, supposedly,
p50
aVeverything is the opposite to the way it is here.
p51
aVBut if you instead
p52
aVlook at what is common to the world's cultures,
p53
aVyou find that there is an enormously rich set
p54
aVof behaviors and emotions
p55
aVand ways of construing the world
p56
aVthat can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures.
p57
aVThe anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all,
p58
aVand they range from aesthetics,
p59
aVaffection and age statuses
p60
aVall the way down to weaning, weapons, weather,
p61
aVattempts to control, the color white
p62
aVand a worldview.
p63
aa(lp64
VAlso, genetics and neuroscience
p65
aVare increasingly showing that the brain
p66
aVis intricately structured.
p67
aVThis is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson
p68
aVand his colleagues in which they \u2014
p69
aVusing MRI \u2014
p70
aVmeasured the distribution of gray matter \u2014
p71
aVthat is, the outer layer of the cortex \u2014
p72
aVin a large sample of pairs of people.
p73
aVThey coded correlations in the thickness
p74
aVof gray matter in different parts of the brain
p75
aVusing a false color scheme, in which
p76
aVno difference is coded as purple,
p77
aVand any color other than purple indicates
p78
aVa statistically significant correlation.
p79
aVWell, this is what happens when you pair people up at random.
p80
aVBy definition, two people picked at random
p81
aVcan't have correlations in the distribution
p82
aVof gray matter in the cortex.
p83
aVThis is what happens in people who share
p84
aVhalf of their DNA \u2014 fraternal twins.
p85
aVAnd as you can see, large amounts of the brain
p86
aVare not purple, showing that if one person
p87
aVhas a thicker bit of cortex
p88
aVin that region, so does his fraternal twin.
p89
aVAnd here's what happens if you
p90
aVget a pair of people who share all their DNA \u2014
p91
aVnamely, clones or identical twins.
p92
aVAnd you can see huge areas of cortex where there are
p93
aVmassive correlations in the distribution of gray matter.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, these aren't just
p96
aVdifferences in anatomy,
p97
aVlike the shape of your ear lobes,
p98
aVbut they have consequences in thought and behavior
p99
aVthat are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams:
p100
aV"Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally."
p101
aVAs you can see, there are two inventors
p102
aVwith identical contraptions in their lap, meeting
p103
aVin the waiting room of a patent attorney.
p104
aVNow, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because
p105
aVstudies of identical twins who were separated at birth
p106
aVand then tested in adulthood
p107
aVshow that they have astonishing similarities.
p108
aVAnd this happens in every pair of identical twins
p109
aVseparated at birth ever studied \u2014
p110
aVbut much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth.
p111
aVMy favorite example is a pair of twins,
p112
aVone of whom was brought up
p113
aVas a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany,
p114
aVthe other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad.
p115
aVWhen they walked into the lab in Minnesota,
p116
aVthey were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes;
p117
aVboth of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee,
p118
aVboth of them kept rubber bands around their wrists,
p119
aVboth of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after,
p120
aVand both of them liked to surprise people
p121
aVby sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump.
p122
aVNow \u2014
p123
aVthe story might seem to good to be true,
p124
aVbut when you administer
p125
aVbatteries of psychological tests,
p126
aVyou get the same results \u2014 namely,
p127
aVidentical twins separated at birth show
p128
aVquite astonishing similarities.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, given both the common sense
p131
aVand scientific data
p132
aVcalling the doctrine of the blank slate into question,
p133
aVwhy should it have been such an appealing notion?
p134
aVWell, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.
p135
aVThe foremost is that if we're blank slates,
p136
aVthen, by definition, we are equal,
p137
aVbecause zero equals zero equals zero.
p138
aVBut if something is written on the slate,
p139
aVthen some people could have more of it than others,
p140
aVand according to this line of thinking, that would justify
p141
aVdiscrimination and inequality.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnother political fear of human nature
p144
aVis that if we are blank slates,
p145
aVwe can perfect mankind \u2014
p146
aVthe age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species
p147
aVthrough social engineering.
p148
aVWhereas, if we're born with certain instincts,
p149
aVthen perhaps some of them might condemn us
p150
aVto selfishness, prejudice and violence.
p151
aVWell, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs.
p152
aVAnd just to make a long story short:
p153
aVfirst of all, the concept of fairness
p154
aVis not the same as the concept of sameness.
p155
aVAnd so when Thomas Jefferson wrote
p156
aVin the Declaration of Independence,
p157
aV"We hold these truths to be self-evident,
p158
aVthat all men are created equal,"
p159
aVhe did not mean "We hold these truths to be self-evident,
p160
aVthat all men are clones."
p161
aVRather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights,
p162
aVand that every person ought to be treated
p163
aVas an individual, and not prejudged
p164
aVby the statistics of particular groups
p165
aVthat they may belong to.
p166
aVAlso, even if we were born
p167
aVwith certain ignoble motives,
p168
aVthey don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior.
p169
aVThat is because the human mind
p170
aVis a complex system with many parts,
p171
aVand some of them can inhibit others.
p172
aVFor example, there's excellent reason to believe
p173
aVthat virtually all humans are born with a moral sense,
p174
aVand that we have cognitive abilities that allow us
p175
aVto profit from the lessons of history.
p176
aVSo even if people did have impulses
p177
aVtowards selfishness or greed,
p178
aVthat's not the only thing in the skull,
p179
aVand there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.
p180
aa(lp181
VIn the book, I
p182
aVgo over controversies such as this one,
p183
aVand a number of other hot buttons,
p184
aVhot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on \u2014
p185
aVincluding the arts, cloning, crime,
p186
aVfree will, education, evolution,
p187
aVgender differences, God, homosexuality,
p188
aVinfanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality,
p189
aVNazism, parenting, politics,
p190
aVrace, rape, religion, resource depletion,
p191
aVsocial engineering, technological risk and war.
p192
aVAnd needless to say, there were certain risks
p193
aVin taking on these subjects.
p194
aVWhen I wrote a first draft of the book,
p195
aVI circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments,
p196
aVand here are some of
p197
aVthe reactions that I got:
p198
aV"Better get a security camera for your house."
p199
aV"Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers
p200
aVor positions in scholarly societies."
p201
aV"Tell your publisher not to list your hometown
p202
aVin your author bio."
p203
aV"Do you have tenure?"
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VWell, the book came out in October,
p207
aVand nothing terrible has happened.
p208
aVI \u2014 I like \u2014
p209
aVThere was indeed reason to be nervous,
p210
aVand there were moments in which I did feel nervous,
p211
aVknowing the history
p212
aVof what has happened to people
p213
aVwho've taken controversial stands
p214
aVor discovered disquieting findings
p215
aVin the behavioral sciences.
p216
aVThere are many cases, some of which I talk about in the book,
p217
aVof people who have been slandered, called Nazis,
p218
aVphysically assaulted, threatened with criminal prosecution
p219
aVfor stumbling across or arguing
p220
aVabout controversial findings.
p221
aVAnd you never know when you're going to
p222
aVcome across one of these booby traps.
p223
aVMy favorite example is a pair of psychologists
p224
aVwho did research on left-handers,
p225
aVand published some data showing that left-handers are, on average,
p226
aVmore susceptible to disease, more prone to accidents
p227
aVand have a shorter lifespan.
p228
aVIt's not clear, by the way, since then,
p229
aVwhether that is an accurate generalization,
p230
aVbut the data at the time seemed to support that.
p231
aVWell, pretty soon they were barraged
p232
aVwith enraged letters,
p233
aVdeath threats,
p234
aVban on the topic in a number of scientific journals,
p235
aVcoming from irate left-handers
p236
aVand their advocates,
p237
aVand they were literally afraid to open their mail
p238
aVbecause of the venom and vituperation
p239
aVthat they had inadvertently inspired.
p240
aa(lp241
VWell,
p242
aVthe night is young, but the book has been out
p243
aVfor half a year,
p244
aVand nothing terrible has happened.
p245
aVNone of the dire professional consequences
p246
aVhas taken place \u2014
p247
aVI haven't been
p248
aVexiled from the city of Cambridge.
p249
aVBut what I wanted to talk about
p250
aVare two of these hot buttons
p251
aVthat have aroused the strongest response
p252
aVin the 80-odd reviews
p253
aVthat The Blank Slate has received.
p254
aVI'll just put that list up for a few seconds,
p255
aVand see if you can guess which two
p256
aV\u2014 I would estimate that probably two of these topics
p257
aVinspired probably 90 percent
p258
aVof the reaction in the various reviews
p259
aVand radio interviews.
p260
aVIt's not violence and war,
p261
aVit's not race, it's not gender,
p262
aVit's not Marxism, it's not Nazism.
p263
aVThey are: the arts and parenting.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aVSo let me tell you what
p266
aVaroused such irate responses,
p267
aVand I'll let you decide if whether they \u2014
p268
aVthe claims are really that outrageous.
p269
aa(lp270
VLet me start with the arts.
p271
aVI note that among the long list of human universals
p272
aVthat I presented a few slides ago
p273
aVare art.
p274
aVThere is no society ever discovered
p275
aVin the remotest corner of the world that has not had something
p276
aVthat we would consider the arts.
p277
aVVisual arts \u2014 decoration of surfaces and bodies \u2014
p278
aVappears to be a human universal.
p279
aVThe telling of stories, music,
p280
aVdance, poetry \u2014 found in all cultures,
p281
aVand many of the motifs and themes
p282
aVthat
p283
aVgive us pleasure in the arts
p284
aVcan be found in all human societies:
p285
aVa preference for symmetrical forms,
p286
aVthe use of repetition and variation,
p287
aVeven things as specific as the fact
p288
aVthat in poetry all over the world,
p289
aVyou have lines that are very close
p290
aVto three seconds long, separated by pauses.
p291
aVNow, on the other hand,
p292
aVin the second half of the 20th century,
p293
aVthe arts are frequently said to be in decline.
p294
aVAnd I have a collection,
p295
aVprobably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines
p296
aVdeploring the fact that
p297
aVthe arts are in decline in our time.
p298
aVI'll give you a couple of representative quotes:
p299
aV"We can assert with some confidence that our own period is
p300
aVone of decline, that the standards of culture are lower
p301
aVthan they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline
p302
aVare visible in every department of human activity."
p303
aVThat's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago.
p304
aVAnd a more recent one:
p305
aV"The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time
p306
aVis becoming increasing problematical.
p307
aVSerious book stores are losing their franchise,
p308
aVnonprofit theaters are surviving primarily
p309
aVby commercializing their repertory,
p310
aVsymphony orchestras are diluting their programs,
p311
aVpublic television is increasing its dependence
p312
aVon reruns of British sitcoms,
p313
aVclassical radio stations are dwindling,
p314
aVmuseums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying."
p315
aVThat's from Robert Brustein,
p316
aVthe famous drama critic and director,
p317
aVin The New Republic about five years ago.
p318
aa(lp319
VWell, in fact, the arts are not in decline.
p320
aVI don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room,
p321
aVbut by any standard
p322
aVthey have never been flourishing
p323
aVto a greater extent.
p324
aVThere are, of course, entirely new art forms
p325
aVand new media, many of which you've heard
p326
aVover these few days.
p327
aVBy any economic standard,
p328
aVthe demand for art of all forms
p329
aVis skyrocketing,
p330
aVas you can tell from the price of opera tickets,
p331
aVby the number of books sold,
p332
aVby the number of books published,
p333
aVthe number of musical titles released,
p334
aVthe number of new albums and so on.
p335
aVThe only grain of truth to this
p336
aVcomplaint that the arts are in decline
p337
aVcome from three spheres.
p338
aVOne of them is in elite art since the 1930s \u2014
p339
aVsay, the kinds of works performed
p340
aVby major symphony orchestras,
p341
aVwhere most of the repertory is before 1930,
p342
aVor the works shown in
p343
aVmajor galleries and prestigious museums.
p344
aVIn literary criticism and analysis,
p345
aVprobably 40 or 50 years ago,
p346
aVliterary critics were a kind of cultural hero;
p347
aVnow they're kind of a national joke.
p348
aVAnd the humanities and arts programs
p349
aVin the universities, which by many measures,
p350
aVindeed are in decline.
p351
aVStudents are staying away in droves,
p352
aVuniversities are disinvesting
p353
aVin the arts and humanities.
p354
aa(lp355
VWell, here's a diagnosis.
p356
aVThey didn't ask me, but by their own admission,
p357
aVthey need all the help that they can get.
p358
aVAnd I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence
p359
aVthat this supposed decline
p360
aVin the elite arts and criticism
p361
aVoccurred in the same point in history in which
p362
aVthere was a widespread denial of human nature.
p363
aVA famous quotation can be found \u2014
p364
aVif you look on the web, you can find it in
p365
aVliterally scores
p366
aVof English core syllabuses \u2014
p367
aV"In or about December 1910,
p368
aVhuman nature changed."
p369
aVA paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf,
p370
aVand there's some debate
p371
aVas to what she actually meant by that.
p372
aVBut it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses,
p373
aVthat \u2014 it's used now
p374
aVas a way of saying that all forms
p375
aVof appreciation of art
p376
aVthat were in place for centuries, or millennia,
p377
aVin the 20th century were discarded.
p378
aVThe beauty and pleasure in art \u2014
p379
aVprobably a human universal \u2014
p380
aVwere \u2014 began to be considered saccharine,
p381
aVor kitsch, or commercial.
p382
aVBarnett Newman had a famous quote that "the impulse of modern art
p383
aVis the desire to destroy beauty" \u2014
p384
aVwhich was considered bourgeois or tacky.
p385
aVAnd here's just one example.
p386
aVI mean, this is perhaps a representative example
p387
aVof the visual depiction of the female form
p388
aVin the 15th century;
p389
aVhere is a representative example
p390
aVof the depiction of the female form in the 20th century.
p391
aVAnd, as you can see, there \u2014 something has changed
p392
aVin the way the elite arts
p393
aVappeal to the senses.
p394
aa(lp395
VIndeed, in movements of modernism
p396
aVand post-modernism,
p397
aVthere was visual art without beauty,
p398
aVliterature without narrative and plot,
p399
aVpoetry without meter and rhyme,
p400
aVarchitecture and planning without ornament,
p401
aVhuman scale, green space and natural light,
p402
aVmusic without melody and rhythm,
p403
aVand criticism without clarity,
p404
aVattention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition.
p405
aV(Laughter)
p406
aVLet me give just you an example to back up that last statement.
p407
aVBut here, there \u2014 one of the most famous literary
p408
aVEnglish scholars of our time
p409
aVis the Berkeley professor,
p410
aVJudith Butler.
p411
aVAnd here is an example of
p412
aVone of her analyses:
p413
aV"The move from a structuralist account in which capital
p414
aVis understood to structure social relations
p415
aVin relatively homologous ways
p416
aVto a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition,
p417
aVconvergence and rearticulation
p418
aVbrought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure,
p419
aVand marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory
p420
aVthat takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ..."
p421
aVWell, you get the idea.
p422
aVBy the way, this is one sentence \u2014
p423
aVyou can actually parse it.
p424
aVWell, the argument in "The Blank Slate"
p425
aVwas that elite art and criticism
p426
aVin the 20th century,
p427
aValthough not the arts in general,
p428
aVhave disdained beauty, pleasure,
p429
aVclarity, insight and style.
p430
aVPeople are staying away from elite art and criticism.
p431
aVWhat a puzzle \u2014 I wonder why.
p432
aVWell, this turned out to be probably
p433
aVthe most controversial claim in the book.
p434
aVSomeone asked me whether I stuck it in
p435
aVin order to deflect ire
p436
aVfrom discussions of gender and Nazism
p437
aVand race and so on. I won't comment on that.
p438
aVBut it certainly inspired
p439
aVan energetic reaction
p440
aVfrom many university professors.
p441
aa(lp442
VWell, the other hot button is parenting.
p443
aVAnd the starting point is the \u2014 for that discussion
p444
aVwas the fact that we have all
p445
aVbeen subject to the advice
p446
aVof the parenting industrial complex.
p447
aVNow, here is \u2014 here is a
p448
aVrepresentative quote from a besieged mother:
p449
aV"I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice.
p450
aVI'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids
p451
aVso I can instill in them a physical fitness habit
p452
aVso they'll grow up to be healthy adults.
p453
aVAnd I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play
p454
aVso they'll grow up smart.
p455
aVAnd there are all kinds of play \u2014 clay for finger dexterity,
p456
aVword games for reading success, large motor play,
p457
aVsmall motor play. I feel like I could devote my life
p458
aVto figuring out what to play with my kids."
p459
aVI think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize
p460

p461
aa(lp462
VWell, here's some sobering facts about parenting.
p463
aVMost studies of parenting on which this advice is based
p464
aVare useless. They're useless because they don't control
p465
aVfor heritability. They measure some correlation
p466
aVbetween what the parents do, how the children turn out
p467
aVand assume a causal relation:
p468
aVthat the parenting shaped the child.
p469
aVParents who talk a lot to their kids
p470
aVhave kids who grow up to be articulate,
p471
aVparents who spank their kids have kids who grow up
p472
aVto be violent and so on.
p473
aVAnd very few of them control for the possibility
p474
aVthat parents pass on genes for \u2014
p475
aVthat increase the chances a child will be articulate
p476
aVor violent and so on.
p477
aVUntil the studies are redone with adoptive children,
p478
aVwho provide an environment
p479
aVbut not genes to their kids,
p480
aVwe have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.
p481
aa(lp482
VThe genetically controlled studies
p483
aVhave some sobering results.
p484
aVRemember the Mallifert twins:
p485
aVseparated at birth, then they meet in the patent office \u2014
p486
aVremarkably similar.
p487
aVWell, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together?
p488
aVYou might think, well, then they'd be even more similar,
p489
aVbecause not only would they share their genes,
p490
aVbut they would also share their environment.
p491
aVThat would make them super-similar, right?
p492
aVWrong. Identical twins, or any siblings,
p493
aVwho are separated at birth are no less similar
p494
aVthan if they had grown up together.
p495
aVEverything that happens to you in a given home
p496
aVover all of those years
p497
aVappears to leave no permanent stamp
p498
aVon your personality or intellect.
p499
aVA complementary finding, from a completely different methodology,
p500
aVis that adopted siblings reared together \u2014
p501
aVthe mirror image of identical twins reared apart,
p502
aVthey share their parents, their home,
p503
aVtheir neighborhood,
p504
aVdon't share their genes \u2014 end up not similar at all.
p505
aVOK \u2014 two different bodies of research with a similar finding.
p506
aa(lp507
VWhat it suggests is that children are shaped
p508
aVnot by their parents over the long run,
p509
aVbut in part \u2014 only in part \u2014 by their genes,
p510
aVin part by their culture \u2014
p511
aVthe culture of the country at large
p512
aVand the children's own culture, namely their peer group \u2014
p513
aVas we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today,
p514
aVthat's what kids care about \u2014
p515
aVand, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge,
p516
aVby chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero;
p517
aVchance events as you live your life.
p518
aa(lp519
VSo let me conclude
p520
aVwith just a remark
p521
aVto bring it back to the theme of choices.
p522
aVI think that the sciences of human nature \u2014
p523
aVbehavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology,
p524
aVneuroscience, cognitive science \u2014
p525
aVare going to, increasingly in the years to come,
p526
aVupset various dogmas,
p527
aVcareers and deeply-held political belief systems.
p528
aVAnd that presents us with a choice.
p529
aVThe choice is whether certain facts about humans,
p530
aVor topics, are to be considered taboos,
p531
aVforbidden knowledge, where we shouldn't go there
p532
aVbecause no good can come from it,
p533
aVor whether we should explore them honestly.
p534
aVI have my own
p535
aVanswer to that question,
p536
aVwhich comes from a great artist of the 19th century,
p537
aVAnton Chekhov, who said,
p538
aV"Man will become better when you show him
p539
aVwhat he is like."
p540
aVAnd I think that the argument
p541
aVcan't be put any more eloquently than that.
p542
aVThank you very much.
p543
aV(Applause)

VThere is something you know about me,
p5
aVsomething very personal,
p6
aVand there is something I know about every one of you
p7
aVand that's very central to your concerns.
p8
aVThere is something that we know
p9
aVabout everyone we meet anywhere in the world, on the street,
p10
aVthat is the very mainspring of whatever they do
p11
aVand whatever they put up with.
p12
aVAnd that is that all of us want to be happy.
p13
aVIn this, we are all together.
p14
aVHow we imagine our happiness, that differs from one another,
p15
aVbut it's already a lot that we have all in common,
p16
aVthat we want to be happy.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow my topic is gratefulness.
p19
aVWhat is the connection between happiness and gratefulness?
p20
aVMany people would say, well, that's very easy.
p21
aVWhen you are happy, you are grateful.
p22
aVBut think again.
p23
aVIs it really the happy people that are grateful?
p24
aVWe all know quite a number of people
p25
aVwho have everything that it would take to be happy,
p26
aVand they are not happy,
p27
aVbecause they want something else or they want more of the same.
p28
aVAnd we all know people who have lots of misfortune,
p29
aVmisfortune that we ourselves would not want to have,
p30
aVand they are deeply happy.
p31
aVThey radiate happiness. You are surprised.
p32
aVWhy? Because they are grateful.
p33
aVSo it is not happiness that makes us grateful.
p34
aVIt's gratefulness that makes us happy.
p35
aVIf you think it's happiness that makes you grateful,
p36
aVthink again.
p37
aVIt's gratefulness that makes you happy.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, we can ask,
p40
aVwhat do we really mean by gratefulness?
p41
aVAnd how does it work?
p42
aVI appeal to your own experience.
p43
aVWe all know from experience how it goes.
p44
aVWe experience something that's valuable to us.
p45
aVSomething is given to us that's valuable to us.
p46
aVAnd it's really given.
p47
aVThese two things have to come together.
p48
aVIt has to be something valuable, and it's a real gift.
p49
aVYou haven't bought it. You haven't earned it.
p50
aVYou haven't traded it in. You haven't worked for it.
p51
aVIt's just given to you.
p52
aVAnd when these two things come together,
p53
aVsomething that's really valuable to me and I realize it's freely given,
p54
aVthen gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart,
p55
aVhappiness spontaneously rises in my heart.
p56
aVThat's how gratefulness happens.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow the key to all this
p59
aVis that we cannot only experience this once in a while.
p60
aVWe cannot only have grateful experiences.
p61
aVWe can be people who live gratefully.
p62
aVGrateful living, that is the thing.
p63
aVAnd how can we live gratefully?
p64
aVBy experiencing, by becoming aware
p65
aVthat every moment is a given moment, as we say.
p66
aVIt's a gift. You haven't earned it.
p67
aVYou haven't brought it about in any way.
p68
aVYou have no way of assuring
p69
aVthat there will be another moment given to you,
p70
aVand yet, that's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us,
p71
aVthis moment, with all the opportunity that it contains.
p72
aVIf we didn't have this present moment,
p73
aVwe wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything
p74
aVor experience anything,
p75
aVand this moment is a gift.
p76
aVIt's a given moment, as we say.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity.
p79
aVWhat you are really grateful for is the opportunity,
p80
aVnot the thing that is given to you,
p81
aVbecause if that thing were somewhere else
p82
aVand you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it,
p83
aVto do something with it,
p84
aVyou wouldn't be grateful for it.
p85
aVOpportunity is the gift within every gift,
p86
aVand we have this saying, opportunity knocks only once.
p87
aVWell, think again.
p88
aVEvery moment is a new gift, over and over again,
p89
aVand if you miss the opportunity of this moment,
p90
aVanother moment is given to us, and another moment.
p91
aVWe can avail ourselves of this opportunity,
p92
aVor we can miss it,
p93
aVand if we avail ourselves of the opportunity,
p94
aVit is the key to happiness.
p95
aVBehold the master key to our happiness
p96
aVin our own hands.
p97
aVMoment by moment, we can be grateful for this gift.
p98
aa(lp99
VDoes that mean
p100
aVthat we can be grateful for everything?
p101
aVCertainly not.
p102
aVWe cannot be grateful for violence, for war,
p103
aVfor oppression, for exploitation.
p104
aVOn the personal level, we cannot be grateful
p105
aVfor the loss of a friend, for unfaithfulness,
p106
aVfor bereavement.
p107
aVBut I didn't say we can be grateful for everything.
p108
aVI said we can be grateful in every given moment
p109
aVfor the opportunity,
p110
aVand even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult,
p111
aVwe can rise to this occasion
p112
aVand respond to the opportunity that is given to us.
p113
aVIt isn't as bad as it might seem.
p114
aVActually, when you look at it and experience it,
p115
aVyou find that most of the time,
p116
aVwhat is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy,
p117
aVand we only miss it because we are rushing through life
p118
aVand we are not stopping to see the opportunity.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut once in a while,
p121
aVsomething very difficult is given to us,
p122
aVand when this difficult thing occurs to us,
p123
aVit's a challenge to rise to that opportunity,
p124
aVand we can rise to it by learning something
p125
aVwhich is sometimes painful.
p126
aVLearning patience, for instance.
p127
aVWe have been told that the road to peace
p128
aVis not a sprint, but is more like a marathon.
p129
aVThat takes patience. That's difficult.
p130
aVIt may be to stand up for your opinion, to stand up for your conviction.
p131
aVThat's an opportunity that is given to us.
p132
aVTo learn, to suffer, to stand up,
p133
aVall these opportunities are given to us,
p134
aVbut they are opportunities,
p135
aVand those who avail themselves of those opportunities
p136
aVare the ones that we admire.
p137
aVThey make something out of life.
p138
aVAnd those who fail get another opportunity.
p139
aVWe always get another opportunity.
p140
aVThat's the wonderful richness of life.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo how can we find a method that will harness this?
p143
aVHow can each one of us find a method for living gratefully,
p144
aVnot just once in a while being grateful,
p145
aVbut moment by moment to be grateful.
p146
aVHow can we do it? It's a very simple method.
p147
aVIt's so simple that it's actually what we were told as children
p148
aVwhen we learned to cross the street.
p149
aVStop.
p150
aVLook.
p151
aVGo.
p152
aVThat's all.
p153
aVBut how often do we stop?
p154
aVWe rush through life. We don't stop.
p155
aVWe miss the opportunity because we don't stop.
p156
aVWe have to stop.
p157
aVWe have to get quiet.
p158
aVAnd we have to build stop signs into our lives.
p159
aa(lp160
VWhen I was in Africa some years ago and then came back,
p161
aVI noticed water.
p162
aVIn Africa where I was, I didn't have drinkable water.
p163
aVEvery time I turned on the faucet, I was overwhelmed.
p164
aVEvery time I clicked on the light, I was so grateful.
p165
aVIt made me so happy.
p166
aVBut after a while, this wears off.
p167
aVSo I put little stickers on the light switch
p168
aVand on the water faucet,
p169
aVand every time I turned it on, water.
p170
aVSo leave it up to your own imagination.
p171
aVYou can find whatever works best for you,
p172
aVbut you need stop signs in your life.
p173
aVAnd when you stop,
p174
aVthen the next thing is to look.
p175
aVYou look. You open your eyes.
p176
aVYou open your ears. You open your nose.
p177
aVYou open all your senses
p178
aVfor this wonderful richness that is given to us.
p179
aVThere is no end to it, and that is what life is all about,
p180
aVto enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd then we can also open our hearts,
p183
aVour hearts for the opportunities,
p184
aVfor the opportunities also to help others,
p185
aVto make others happy,
p186
aVbecause nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy.
p187
aVAnd when we open our hearts to the opportunities,
p188
aVthe opportunities invite us to do something,
p189
aVand that is the third.
p190
aVStop, look, and then go, and really do something.
p191
aVAnd what we can do
p192
aVis whatever life offers to you in that present moment.
p193
aVMostly it's the opportunity to enjoy,
p194
aVbut sometimes it's something more difficult.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut whatever it is, if we take this opportunity,
p197
aVwe go with it, we are creative, those are the creative people.
p198
aVAnd that little stop, look, go,
p199
aVis such a potent seed
p200
aVthat it can revolutionize our world.
p201
aVBecause we are at the present moment
p202
aVin the middle of a change of consciousness,
p203
aVand you will be surprised if you \u2014
p204
aVI am always surprised when I hear how many times
p205
aVthis word "gratefulness" and "gratitude" comes up.
p206
aVEverywhere you find it,
p207
aVa grateful airline, a restaurant gratefulness,
p208
aVa café gratefulness, a wine that is gratefulness.
p209
aVYes, I have even come across a toilet paper
p210
aVwhose brand is called "Thank You."
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VThere is a wave of gratefulness
p215
aVbecause people are becoming aware how important this is
p216
aVand how this can change our world.
p217
aVIt can change our world in immensely important ways,
p218
aVbecause if you're grateful, you're not fearful,
p219
aVand if you're not fearful, you're not violent.
p220
aVIf you're grateful, you act out of a sense of enough
p221
aVand not of a sense of scarcity,
p222
aVand you are willing to share.
p223
aVIf you are grateful,
p224
aVyou are enjoying the differences between people,
p225
aVand you are respectful to everybody,
p226
aVand that changes this power pyramid under which we live.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd it doesn't make for equality, but it makes for equal respect,
p229
aVand that is the important thing.
p230
aVThe future of the world will be a network,
p231
aVnot a pyramid turned upside down.
p232
aVThe revolution of which I am speaking is a nonviolent revolution,
p233
aVand it's so revolutionary that it even revolutionizes
p234
aVthe very concept of a revolution,
p235
aVbecause the normal revolution
p236
aVis one where the power pyramid is turned upside down
p237
aVand those who were on the bottom are now on the top
p238
aVand are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before.
p239
aVWhat we need is a networking of smaller groups,
p240
aVsmaller and smaller groups who know one another,
p241
aVwho interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.
p242
aa(lp243
VA grateful world is a world of joyful people.
p244
aVGrateful people are joyful people,
p245
aVand joyful people \u2014
p246
aVthe more and more joyful people there are,
p247
aVthe more and more we'll have a joyful world.
p248
aVWe have a network for grateful living, and it has mushroomed.
p249
aVWe couldn't understand why it mushroomed.
p250
aVWe have an opportunity for people to light a candle
p251
aVwhen they are grateful for something.
p252
aVAnd there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade.
p253
aVPeople are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world,
p254
aVand we all have the opportunity by the simple stop, look, go,
p255
aVto transform the world, to make it a happy place.
p256
aVAnd that is what I hope for us,
p257
aVand if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same,
p258
aVstop, look, go.
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you.

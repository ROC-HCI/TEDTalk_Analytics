VI will start by posing a little bit of a challenge:
p5
aVthe challenge of dealing with data,
p6
aVdata that we have to deal with
p7
aVin medical situations.
p8
aVIt's really a huge challenge for us.
p9
aVAnd this is our beast of burden \u2014
p10
aVthis is a Computer Tomography machine,
p11
aVa CT machine.
p12
aVIt's a fantastic device.
p13
aVIt uses X-rays, X-ray beams,
p14
aVthat are rotating very fast around the human body.
p15
aVIt takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine
p16
aVand is generating enormous amounts of information
p17
aVthat comes out of the machine.
p18
aVSo this is a fantastic machine
p19
aVthat we can use
p20
aVfor improving health care,
p21
aVbut as I said, it's also a challenge for us.
p22
aVAnd the challenge is really found in this picture here.
p23
aVIt's the medical data explosion
p24
aVthat we're having right now.
p25
aVWe're facing this problem.
p26
aVAnd let me step back in time.
p27
aa(lp28
VLet's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then.
p29
aVThese machines that came out \u2014
p30
aVthey started coming in the 1970s \u2014
p31
aVthey would scan human bodies,
p32
aVand they would generate about 100 images
p33
aVof the human body.
p34
aVAnd I've taken the liberty, just for clarity,
p35
aVto translate that to data slices.
p36
aVThat would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data,
p37
aVwhich is small
p38
aVwhen you think about the data we can handle today
p39
aVjust on normal mobile devices.
p40
aVIf you translate that to phone books,
p41
aVit's about one meter of phone books in the pile.
p42
aVLooking at what we're doing today
p43
aVwith these machines that we have,
p44
aVwe can, just in a few seconds,
p45
aVget 24,000 images out of a body,
p46
aVand that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data,
p47
aVor 800 phone books,
p48
aVand the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books.
p49
aVWhat's about to happen \u2014
p50
aVand we're seeing this; it's beginning \u2014
p51
aVa technology trend that's happening right now
p52
aVis that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well.
p53
aVSo we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well.
p54
aVAnd just assume
p55
aVthat we will be collecting data during five seconds,
p56
aVand that would correspond to one terabyte of data \u2014
p57
aVthat's 800,000 books
p58
aVand 16 kilometers of phone books.
p59
aVThat's one patient, one data set.
p60
aVAnd this is what we have to deal with.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo this is really the enormous challenge that we have.
p63
aVAnd already today \u2014 this is 25,000 images.
p64
aVImagine the days
p65
aVwhen we had radiologists doing this.
p66
aVThey would put up 25,000 images,
p67
aVthey would go like this, "25,0000, okay, okay.
p68
aVThere is the problem."
p69
aVThey can't do that anymore. That's impossible.
p70
aVSo we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this.
p71
aVSo what we do is that we put all these slices together.
p72
aVImagine that you slice your body in all these directions,
p73
aVand then you try to put the slices back together again
p74
aVinto a pile of data, into a block of data.
p75
aVSo this is really what we're doing.
p76
aVSo this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block.
p77
aVBut of course, the block of data
p78
aVjust contains the amount of X-ray
p79
aVthat's been absorbed in each point in the human body.
p80
aVSo what we need to do is to figure out a way
p81
aVof looking at the things we do want to look at
p82
aVand make things transparent that we don't want to look at.
p83
aVSo transforming the data set
p84
aVinto something that looks like this.
p85
aVAnd this is a challenge.
p86
aVThis is a huge challenge for us to do that.
p87
aa(lp88
VUsing computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time,
p89
aVit's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data,
p90
aVterabytes of data
p91
aVand extracting the relevant information.
p92
aVI want to look at the heart.
p93
aVI want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver.
p94
aVMaybe even find a tumor,
p95
aVin some cases.
p96
aVSo this is where this little dear comes into play.
p97
aVThis is my daughter.
p98
aVThis is as of 9 a.m. this morning.
p99
aVShe's playing a computer game.
p100
aVShe's only two years old,
p101
aVand she's having a blast.
p102
aVSo she's really the driving force
p103
aVbehind the development of graphics-processing units.
p104
aVAs long as kids are playing computer games,
p105
aVgraphics is getting better and better and better.
p106
aVSo please go back home, tell your kids to play more games,
p107
aVbecause that's what I need.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo what's inside of this machine
p110
aVis what enables me to do the things that I'm doing
p111
aVwith the medical data.
p112
aVSo really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices.
p113
aVAnd you know, going back
p114
aVmaybe 10 years in time
p115
aVwhen I got the funding
p116
aVto buy my first graphics computer \u2014
p117
aVit was a huge machine.
p118
aVIt was cabinets of processors and storage and everything.
p119
aVI paid about one million dollars for that machine.
p120
aVThat machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone.
p121
aVSo every month there are new graphics cards coming out,
p122
aVand here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors \u2014
p123
aVNVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well.
p124
aVAnd you know, for a few hundred bucks
p125
aVyou can get these things and put them into your computer,
p126
aVand you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards.
p127
aVSo this is really what's enabling us
p128
aVto deal with the explosion of data in medicine,
p129
aVtogether with some really nifty work
p130
aVin terms of algorithms \u2014
p131
aVcompressing data,
p132
aVextracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do.
p135
aVThis is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner.
p136
aVYou can see that this is a full data [set].
p137
aVIt's a woman. You can see the hair.
p138
aVYou can see the individual structures of the woman.
p139
aVYou can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays
p140
aVon the teeth, the metal in the teeth.
p141
aVThat's where those artifacts are coming from.
p142
aVBut fully interactively
p143
aVon standard graphics cards on a normal computer,
p144
aVI can just put in a clip plane.
p145
aVAnd of course all the data is inside,
p146
aVso I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles,
p147
aVand I can see that this woman had a problem.
p148
aVShe had a bleeding up in the brain,
p149
aVand that's been fixed with a little stent,
p150
aVa metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel.
p151
aVAnd just by changing the functions,
p152
aVthen I can decide what's going to be transparent
p153
aVand what's going to be visible.
p154
aVI can look at the skull structure,
p155
aVand I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman,
p156
aVand that's where they went in.
p157
aVSo these are fantastic images.
p158
aVThey're really high resolution,
p159
aVand they're really showing us what we can do
p160
aVwith standard graphics cards today.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow we have really made use of this,
p163
aVand we have tried to squeeze a lot of data
p164
aVinto the system.
p165
aVAnd one of the applications that we've been working on \u2014
p166
aVand this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide \u2014
p167
aVis the application of virtual autopsies.
p168
aVSo again, looking at very, very large data sets,
p169
aVand you saw those full-body scans that we can do.
p170
aVWe're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner,
p171
aVand just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set.
p172
aVSo this is from a virtual autopsy.
p173
aVAnd you can see how I'm gradually peeling off.
p174
aVFirst you saw the body bag that the body came in,
p175
aVthen I'm peeling off the skin \u2014 you can see the muscles \u2014
p176
aVand eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow at this point, I would also like to emphasize
p179
aVthat, with the greatest respect
p180
aVfor the people that I'm now going to show \u2014
p181
aVI'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies \u2014
p182
aVso it's with great respect for the people
p183
aVthat have died under violent circumstances
p184
aVthat I'm showing these pictures to you.
p185
aVIn the forensic case \u2014
p186
aVand this is something
p187
aVthat ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far
p188
aVjust in the part of Sweden that I come from
p189
aVthat has been undergoing virtual autopsies
p190
aVin the past four years.
p191
aVSo this will be the typical workflow situation.
p192
aVThe police will decide \u2014
p193
aVin the evening, when there's a case coming in \u2014
p194
aVthey will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy?
p195
aVSo in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning,
p196
aVthe body is then transported inside of the body bag
p197
aVto our center
p198
aVand is being scanned through one of the CT scanners.
p199
aVAnd then the radiologist, together with the pathologist
p200
aVand sometimes the forensic scientist,
p201
aVlooks at the data that's coming out,
p202
aVand they have a joint session.
p203
aVAnd then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow looking at a few cases,
p206
aVhere's one of the first cases that we had.
p207
aVYou can really see the details of the data set.
p208
aVIt's very high-resolution,
p209
aVand it's our algorithms that allow us
p210
aVto zoom in on all the details.
p211
aVAnd again, it's fully interactive,
p212
aVso you can rotate and you can look at things in real time
p213
aVon these systems here.
p214
aVWithout saying too much about this case,
p215
aVthis is a traffic accident,
p216
aVa drunk driver hit a woman.
p217
aVAnd it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure.
p218
aVAnd the cause of death is the broken neck.
p219
aVAnd this women also ended up under the car,
p220
aVso she's quite badly beaten up
p221
aVby this injury.
p222
aa(lp223
VHere's another case, a knifing.
p224
aVAnd this is also again showing us what we can do.
p225
aVIt's very easy to look at metal artifacts
p226
aVthat we can show inside of the body.
p227
aVYou can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth \u2014
p228
aVthat's actually the filling of the teeth \u2014
p229
aVbut because I've set the functions to show me metal
p230
aVand make everything else transparent.
p231
aVHere's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person.
p232
aVThe person was killed by stabs in the heart,
p233
aVbut they just deposited the knife
p234
aVby putting it through one of the eyeballs.
p235
aVHere's another case.
p236
aVIt's very interesting for us
p237
aVto be able to look at things like knife stabbings.
p238
aVHere you can see that knife went through the heart.
p239
aVIt's very easy to see how air has been leaking
p240
aVfrom one part to another part,
p241
aVwhich is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy.
p242
aVSo it really, really helps
p243
aVthe criminal investigation
p244
aVto establish the cause of death,
p245
aVand in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction
p246
aVto find out who the killer really was.
p247
aa(lp248
VHere's another case that I think is interesting.
p249
aVHere you can see a bullet
p250
aVthat has lodged just next to the spine on this person.
p251
aVAnd what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source,
p252
aVso that bullet is actually shining,
p253
aVand it makes it really easy to find these fragments.
p254
aVDuring a physical autopsy,
p255
aVif you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments,
p256
aVthat's actually quite hard to do.
p257
aa(lp258
VOne of the things that I'm really, really happy
p259
aVto be able to show you here today
p260
aVis our virtual autopsy table.
p261
aVIt's a touch device that we have developed
p262
aVbased on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs.
p263
aVIt actually looks like this,
p264
aVjust to give you a feeling for what it looks like.
p265
aVIt really just works like a huge iPhone.
p266
aVSo we've implemented
p267
aVall the gestures you can do on the table,
p268
aVand you can think of it as an enormous touch interface.
p269
aVSo if you were thinking of buying an iPad,
p270
aVforget about it. This is what you want instead.
p271
aVSteve, I hope you're listening to this, all right.
p272
aVSo it's a very nice little device.
p273
aVSo if you have the opportunity, please try it out.
p274
aVIt's really a hands-on experience.
p275
aVSo it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out
p276
aVand trying to use it for educational purposes,
p277
aVbut also, perhaps in the future,
p278
aVin a more clinical situation.
p279
aVThere's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this,
p280
aVif you want to convey the information to other people
p281
aVabout virtual autopsies.
p282
aa(lp283
VOkay, now that we're talking about touch,
p284
aVlet me move on to really "touching" data.
p285
aVAnd this is a bit of science fiction now,
p286
aVso we're moving into really the future.
p287
aVThis is not really what the medical doctors are using right now,
p288
aVbut I hope they will in the future.
p289
aVSo what you're seeing on the left is a touch device.
p290
aVIt's a little mechanical pen
p291
aVthat has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen.
p292
aVAnd so I can generate a force feedback.
p293
aVSo when I virtually touch data,
p294
aVit will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback.
p295
aVSo in this particular situation,
p296
aVit's a scan of a living person.
p297
aVI have this pen, and I look at the data,
p298
aVand I move the pen towards the head,
p299
aVand all of a sudden I feel resistance.
p300
aVSo I can feel the skin.
p301
aVIf I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin,
p302
aVand I can feel the bone structure inside.
p303
aVIf I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure,
p304
aVespecially close to the ear where the bone is very soft.
p305
aVAnd then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo this is really nice.
p308
aVAnd to take that even further, this is a heart.
p309
aVAnd this is also due to these fantastic new scanners,
p310
aVthat just in 0.3 seconds,
p311
aVI can scan the whole heart,
p312
aVand I can do that with time resolution.
p313
aVSo just looking at this heart,
p314
aVI can play back a video here.
p315
aVAnd this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students
p316
aVwho's been working on this project.
p317
aVAnd he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system,
p318
aVand he's moving his pen towards the heart,
p319
aVand the heart is now beating in front of him,
p320
aVso he can see how the heart is beating.
p321
aVHe's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart,
p322
aVand he's putting it on the heart,
p323
aVand then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient.
p324
aVThen he can examine how the heart is moving.
p325
aVHe can go inside, push inside of the heart,
p326
aVand really feel how the valves are moving.
p327
aVAnd this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons.
p328
aVI mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon
p329
aVto be able to go inside of the patient's heart
p330
aVbefore you actually do surgery,
p331
aVand do that with high-quality resolution data.
p332
aVSo this is really neat.
p333
aa(lp334
VNow we're going even further into science fiction.
p335
aVAnd we heard a little bit about functional MRI.
p336
aVNow this is really an interesting project.
p337
aVMRI is using magnetic fields
p338
aVand radio frequencies
p339
aVto scan the brain, or any part of the body.
p340
aVSo what we're really getting out of this
p341
aVis information of the structure of the brain,
p342
aVbut we can also measure the difference
p343
aVin magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated
p344
aVand blood that's depleted of oxygen.
p345
aVThat means that it's possible
p346
aVto map out the activity of the brain.
p347
aVSo this is something that we've been working on.
p348
aVAnd you just saw Motts the research engineer, there,
p349
aVgoing into the MRI system,
p350
aVand he was wearing goggles.
p351
aVSo he could actually see things in the goggles.
p352
aVSo I could present things to him while he's in the scanner.
p353
aVAnd this is a little bit freaky,
p354
aVbecause what Motts is seeing is actually this.
p355
aVHe's seeing his own brain.
p356
aVSo Motts is doing something here,
p357
aVand probably he is going like this with his right hand,
p358
aVbecause the left side is activated
p359
aVon the motor cortex.
p360
aVAnd then he can see that at the same time.
p361
aVThese visualizations are brand new.
p362
aVAnd this is something that we've been researching for a little while.
p363
aa(lp364
VThis is another sequence of Motts' brain.
p365
aVAnd here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100.
p366
aVSo he's going "100, 97, 94."
p367
aVAnd then he's going backwards.
p368
aVAnd you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain
p369
aVand is lighting up the whole brain.
p370
aVWell this is fantastic. We can do this in real time.
p371
aVWe can investigate things. We can tell him to do things.
p372
aVYou can also see that his visual cortex
p373
aVis activated in the back of the head,
p374
aVbecause that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain.
p375
aVAnd he's also hearing our instructions
p376
aVwhen we tell him to do things.
p377
aVThe signal is really deep inside of the brain as well,
p378
aVand it's shining through,
p379
aVbecause all of the data is inside this volume.
p380
aVAnd in just a second here you will see \u2014
p381
aVokay, here. Motts, now move your left foot.
p382
aVSo he's going like this.
p383
aVFor 20 seconds he's going like that,
p384
aVand all of a sudden it lights up up here.
p385
aVSo we've got motor cortex activation up there.
p386
aVSo this is really, really nice,
p387
aVand I think this is a great tool.
p388
aVAnd connecting also with the previous talk here,
p389
aVthis is something that we could use as a tool
p390
aVto really understand
p391
aVhow the neurons are working, how the brain is working,
p392
aVand we can do this with very, very high visual quality
p393
aVand very fast resolution.
p394
aa(lp395
VNow we're also having a bit of fun at the center.
p396
aVSo this is a CAT scan \u2014 Computer Aided Tomography.
p397
aVSo this is a lion from the local zoo
p398
aVoutside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa.
p399
aVSo she came to the center,
p400
aVand they sedated her
p401
aVand then put her straight into the scanner.
p402
aVAnd then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion.
p403
aVAnd I can do very nice images like this.
p404
aVI can peel off the layer of the lion.
p405
aVI can look inside of it.
p406
aVAnd we've been experimenting with this.
p407
aVAnd I think this is a great application
p408
aVfor the future of this technology,
p409
aVbecause there's very little known about the animal anatomy.
p410
aVWhat's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information.
p411
aVWe can scan all sorts of things,
p412
aVall sorts of animals.
p413
aVThe only problem is to fit it into the machine.
p414
aVSo here's a bear.
p415
aVIt was kind of hard to get it in.
p416
aVAnd the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal.
p417
aVAnd here it is. Here is the nose of the bear.
p418
aVAnd you might want to cuddle this one,
p419
aVuntil you change the functions and look at this.
p420
aVSo be aware of the bear.
p421
aa(lp422
VSo with that,
p423
aVI'd like to thank all the people
p424
aVwho have helped me to generate these images.
p425
aVIt's a huge effort that goes into doing this,
p426
aVgathering the data and developing the algorithms,
p427
aVwriting all the software.
p428
aVSo, some very talented people.
p429
aVMy motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am
p430

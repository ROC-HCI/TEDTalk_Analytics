VCartoons are basically short stories.
p5
aVI tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.
p6
aVNot all of them have happy endings.
p7
aVSo how did I get started cartooning?
p8
aVI doodled a lot as a kid,
p9
aVand if you spend enough time doodling,
p10
aVsooner or later, something happens:
p11
aVall your career options run out.
p12
aVSo you have to make a living cartooning.
p13
aa(lp14
VActually, I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy,
p15
aVwhen I was about eight or nine.
p16
aVAnd I was particularly fascinated with sharks.
p17
aVThis is some of my early work.
p18
aVEventually, my mom took the red crayon away,
p19
aVso it was [unclear].
p20
aVBut I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine
p21
aVthat really made me see the ocean differently,
p22
aVand it's become the foundation of my work
p23
aVbecause, I feel like, if in a day,
p24
aVI can see the ocean differently,
p25
aVthen I can evoke that same kind of change in others,
p26
aVespecially kids.
p27
aVBefore that day, this is how I saw the ocean.
p28
aVIt's just a big blue surface.
p29
aVAnd this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.
p30
aVIt's a mystery.
p31
aVThere's been a lot of folklore
p32
aVdeveloped around the ocean,
p33
aVmostly negative.
p34
aVAnd that prompted people to make maps like this,
p35
aVwith all kinds of wonderful detail on the land,
p36
aVbut when you get to the waters edge,
p37
aVthe ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint.
p38
aVAnd this is the way I saw the ocean at school \u2014
p39
aVas if to say, "All geography and science lessons
p40
aVstop at water's edge.
p41
aVThis part's not going to be on the test."
p42
aa(lp43
VBut that day I flew low over the islands \u2014
p44
aVit was a family trip to the Caribbean,
p45
aVand I flew in a small plane low over the islands.
p46
aVThis is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.
p47
aVI saw forests and meadows.
p48
aVI saw grottoes and secret gardens
p49
aVand places I'd love to hide as a kid,
p50
aVif I could only breathe underwater.
p51
aVAnd best of all, I saw the animals.
p52
aVI saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in.
p53
aVAnd I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it,
p54
aVand that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo from that day on, I was an ordinary kid
p57
aVwalking around on dry land,
p58
aVbut my head was down there, underwater.
p59
aVUp until that day,
p60
aVthese were the animals that were most common in my life.
p61
aVThese were the ones I'd like to draw \u2014
p62
aVall variations of four legs and fur.
p63
aVBut when you got to the ocean,
p64
aVmy imagination was no competition for nature.
p65
aVEvery time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board,
p66
aVI'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier.
p67
aVAnd the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon
p68
aVand this enormous humpback whale
p69
aVwas like something out of a science-fiction movie.
p70
aa(lp71
VWhenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them,
p72
aVthe biggest animal that ever lived is still alive.
p73
aVIt's not a dinosaur; it's a whale,
p74
aVanimals as big as office buildings
p75
aVstill swimming around out there in our ocean.
p76
aVSpeaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basically
p77
aVthe same fish they were 300 million years ago.
p78
aVSo if you ever fantasize about going back in time
p79
aVand seeing what a dinosaur looked like,
p80
aVthat's what a dinosaur looks like.
p81
aVSo you have living dinosaurs
p82
aVand space aliens,
p83
aVanimals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.
p84
aVIt's just incredible; no Hollywood designer
p85
aVcould come up with something more interesting than that.
p86
aVOr this fangtooth. The particles in the water
p87
aVmake it look like it's floating in outer space.
p88
aVCould you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope
p89
aVand we saw that?
p90
aVIt would start a whole new space race.
p91
aVBut instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean,
p92
aVand we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination
p93
aVas a society.
p94
aVWe say to ourselves,
p95
aV"Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something."
p96
aa(lp97
VSo, what I'd like to do now
p98
aVis try a little drawing.
p99
aVSo, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.
p100
aVI love to draw the deep sea fish,
p101
aVbecause they are so ugly,
p102
aVbut beautiful in their own way.
p103
aVMaybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here \u2014
p104
aVgive him a headlight,
p105
aVmaybe a brake light,
p106
aVturn signals.
p107
aVBut it's easy to see why these animals
p108
aVmake such great cartoon characters,
p109
aVtheir shapes and sizes.
p110
aVSo some of them actually seem to have powers
p111
aVlike superheroes in a comic book.
p112
aVFor instance,
p113
aVtake these sea turtles.
p114
aVThey kind of have a sixth sense
p115
aVlike Superman's x-ray vision.
p116
aVThey can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.
p117
aVAnd they can use that sense
p118
aVto navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean.
p119
aVI kind of give my turtle hands
p120
aVjust to make them an easier cartoon character to work with.
p121
aVOr take this sea cucumber.
p122
aVIt's not an animal we draw cartoons of
p123
aVor draw at all.
p124
aVHe's like an underwater Spiderman.
p125
aVHe shoots out these sticky webs
p126
aVto entangle his enemy.
p127
aVOf course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears,
p128
aVwhich, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVHe can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VOr the blowfish.
p135
aVThe blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.
p136
aVIt can change its body
p137
aVinto a big, intimidating fish
p138
aVin a matter of seconds.
p139
aVI'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated.
p140
aVAnd then I'm going to attempt
p141
aVonscreen animation here.
p142
aVLet's see.
p143
aVTry and inflate it.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aV"You talkin' to me?" See, he can inflate himself
p146
aVwhen he wants to be intimidating.
p147
aVOr take this swordfish.
p148
aVCould you imagine being born with a tool for a nose?
p149
aVDo you think he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says,
p150
aV"Somebody's getting stabbed today."
p151
aVOr this lionfish for instance.
p152
aVImagine trying to make friends
p153
aVcovered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs.
p154
aVIt's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right?
p155
aa(lp156
VMy characters are \u2014
p157
aVmy lead character's a shark named Sherman.
p158
aVHe's a great white shark.
p159
aVAnd I kind of broke the mold with Sherman.
p160
aVI didn't want to go with this ruthless
p161
aVpredator image.
p162
aVHe's kind of just out there making a living.
p163
aVHe's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.
p164
aVAnd then his sidekick
p165
aVis a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore.
p166
aVHe uses his wonderful skills at navigation
p167
aVto wander the oceans, looking for a mate.
p168
aVAnd he does manage to find them,
p169
aVbut great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.
p170
aVHe never seems
p171
aVto settle on
p172
aVany particular girl.
p173
aVI have a hermit crab named Hawthorne,
p174
aVwho doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab,
p175
aVso he kind of wishes
p176
aVhe were a great white shark.
p177
aVAnd then I'll introduce you to one more character,
p178
aVthis guy, Ernest,
p179
aVwho is basically a juvenile delinquent
p180
aVin a fish body.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo with characters, you can make stories.
p183
aVSometimes making a story is as easy
p184
aVas putting two characters in a room
p185
aVand seeing what happens.
p186
aVSo, imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVOr, sometimes I take them to places
p189
aVthat people have never heard of because they're underwater.
p190
aVFor instance, I took them skiing in the Mid-Atlantic Range,
p191
aVwhich is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic.
p192
aVI've taken them to the Sea of Japan,
p193
aVwhere they met giant jellyfish.
p194
aVI've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California.
p195
aa(lp196
VThis next one here,
p197
aVI did a story on the census of marine life.
p198
aVAnd that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know,
p199
aVit's a real project we've heard about.
p200
aVBut it was a chance for me to introduce readers
p201
aVto a lot of crazy undersea characters.
p202
aVSo we start off the story with Ernest,
p203
aVwho volunteers as a census taker.
p204
aVHe goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.
p205
aVThen he meets the yeti crab,
p206
aVthe famous vampire squid \u2014 elusive, hard to find \u2014
p207
aVand the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life
p208
aVthat really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it.
p209
aa(lp210
VI did another story on marine debris.
p211
aVI was speaking to a lot of my friends
p212
aVin the conservation business,
p213
aVand they \u2014
p214
aVI asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?"
p215
aVAnd they said \u2014 this one friend of mine said,
p216
aV"I've got one word for you: plastic."
p217
aVAnd I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that.
p218
aVPlastic just is not going to do it."
p219
aVWe sort of worked things out.
p220
aVHe wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride,
p221
aVwhich doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.
p222
aVI couldn't fit them in.
p223
aVSo what I did was I made an adventure strip.
p224
aa(lp225
VBasically, this bottle travels a long way.
p226
aVWhat I'm trying to tell readers
p227
aVis that plastic doesn't really go away;
p228
aVit just continues to wash downstream.
p229
aVAnd a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean,
p230
aVwhich is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it,
p231
aVespecially if they can't stand each other, like these two.
p232
aVSo, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,
p233
aVwhere they dropped a plastic bottle
p234
aVinto the Boise sewer system.
p235
aVAnd it ended up in the Boise River
p236
aVand then on to the Columbia River
p237
aVand then to the mouth of the Columbia
p238
aVand to the Pacific Ocean
p239
aVand then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch \u2014
p240
aVwhich is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific,
p241
aVwhere a lot of this plastic ends up floating around \u2014
p242
aVand then back onto the lagoon.
p243
aVSo that was basically a buddy story
p244
aVwith a plastic bottle following along.
p245
aVSo a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway,
p246
aVbut we really talked about marine debris and plastic
p247
aVin the course of that one.
p248
aa(lp249
VThe third storyline I did about a year and a half ago
p250
aVwas probably my most difficult.
p251
aVIt was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly
p252
aVabout this issue.
p253
aVAnd I felt like, since my main character was a shark,
p254
aVthe comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this.
p255
aVNow, finning is the act
p256
aVof taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins off
p257
aVand throwing the live animal back in the water.
p258
aVIt's cruel, it's wasteful.
p259
aVThere's nothing funny or entertaining about it,
p260
aVbut I really wanted to take this issue on.
p261
aVI had to kill my main character, who is a shark.
p262
aa(lp263
VWe start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant,
p264
aVwho gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler,
p265
aVwhich he does.
p266
aVAnd then he dies.
p267
aVHe gets finned, and then he gets thrown overboard.
p268
aVOstensibly, he's dead now.
p269
aVAnd so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years.
p270
aVSo I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.
p271
aVMeanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup.
p272
aVI do three or four strips after that
p273
aVwhere we explore the finning issue
p274
aVand the shark fin soup issue.
p275
aVSherman's up in shark heaven.
p276
aVThis is what I love about comic strips, you know.
p277
aVYou really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief
p278
aVbecause, if you start with a talking shark,
p279
aVreaders pretty much check their disbelief at the door.
p280
aVYou can kind of do anything.
p281
aVIt becomes a near-death experience for Sherman.
p282
aVMeanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.
p283
aVThere was a real website based in China
p284
aVthat actually sold shark fins,
p285
aVso I kind of exposed that.
p286
aVAnd he clicks the "buy now" button.
p287
aVAnd voila, next-day air, they show up,
p288
aVand they surgically reattach them.
p289
aVI ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition
p290
aVthat encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service,
p291
aVto force other countries
p292
aVto have a stronger stance with shark management.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Applause)
p295
aa(lp296
VThanks.
p297
aVI'd like to end with a little metaphor here.
p298
aVI've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue,
p299
aVand this is what I came up with.
p300
aVImagine you're in an enormous room,
p301
aVand it's as dark as a cave.
p302
aVAnd you can have anything in that room, anything you want,
p303
aVbut you can't see anything.
p304
aVYou've been given one tool, a hammer.
p305
aVSo you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something,
p306
aVand it feels like it's made of stone.
p307
aVIt's big, it's heavy. You can't carry it away,
p308
aVso you bang it with your hammer, and you break off a piece.
p309
aVAnd you take the piece out into the daylight.
p310
aVAnd you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster.
p311
aVSo you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something."
p312
aVSo you go back into the room,
p313
aVand you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.
p314
aVAnd you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away.
p315
aVAnd you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.
p316
aVAnd you hear other people doing the same thing.
p317
aVSo you get this sense of urgency,
p318
aVlike you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.
p319
aVAnd then some yells, "Stop!"
p320
aVAnd they turn up the lights.
p321
aVAnd you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre.
p322
aVAnd you've taken all this complexity and beauty,
p323
aVand you've turned it into a cheap commodity.
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd that's what we're doing with the ocean.
p326
aVAnd part of what Mission Blue is about
p327
aVis yelling, "Stop!"
p328
aVso that each of us \u2014
p329
aVexplorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef \u2014
p330
aVcan turn up the lights in their own way.
p331
aVAnd that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.
p332
aVThat's why I like what I do.
p333
aa(lp334
VThanks for listening.

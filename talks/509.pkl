VBacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth.
p5
aVThey've been here for billions of years,
p6
aVand what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms.
p7
aVSo they are one cell and they have this special property
p8
aVthat they only have one piece of DNA.
p9
aVThey have very few genes,
p10
aVand genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out.
p11
aVAnd the way bacteria make a living
p12
aVis that they consume nutrients from the environment,
p13
aVthey grow to twice their size, they cut themselves down in the middle,
p14
aVand one cell becomes two, and so on and so on.
p15
aVThey just grow and divide, and grow and divide \u2014 so a kind of boring life,
p16
aVexcept that what I would argue is that you have
p17
aVan amazing interaction with these critters.
p18
aa(lp19
VI know you guys think of yourself as humans, and this is sort of how I think of you.
p20
aVThis man is supposed to represent
p21
aVa generic human being,
p22
aVand all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body.
p23
aVThere is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us
p24
aVwho we are and able to do all the things that we do,
p25
aVbut you have 10 trillion bacterial cells
p26
aVin you or on you at any moment in your life.
p27
aVSo, 10 times more bacterial cells
p28
aVthan human cells on a human being.
p29
aVAnd of course it's the DNA that counts,
p30
aVso here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs
p31
aVthat make up your genetic code, and give you all your charming characteristics.
p32
aVYou have about 30,000 genes.
p33
aVWell it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes
p34
aVplaying a role in you or on you all of your life.
p35
aVAt the best, you're 10 percent human,
p36
aVbut more likely about one percent human,
p37
aVdepending on which of these metrics you like.
p38
aVI know you think of yourself as human beings,
p39
aVbut I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VThese bacteria are not passive riders,
p44
aVthese are incredibly important, they keep us alive.
p45
aVThey cover us in an invisible body armor
p46
aVthat keeps environmental insults out
p47
aVso that we stay healthy.
p48
aVThey digest our food, they make our vitamins,
p49
aVthey actually educate your immune system
p50
aVto keep bad microbes out.
p51
aVSo they do all these amazing things
p52
aVthat help us and are vital for keeping us alive,
p53
aVand they never get any press for that.
p54
aVBut they get a lot of press because they do a lot of
p55
aVterrible things as well.
p56
aVSo, there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth
p57
aVthat have no business being in you or on you at any time,
p58
aVand if they are, they make you incredibly sick.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd so, the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the
p61
aVgood things that bacteria do, or all the bad things that bacteria do.
p62
aVThe question we had is how could they do anything at all?
p63
aVI mean they're incredibly small,
p64
aVyou have to have a microscope to see one.
p65
aVThey live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide,
p66
aVand they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms.
p67
aVAnd so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact
p68
aVon the environment
p69
aVif they simply act as individuals.
p70
aVAnd so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different
p71
aVway that bacteria live.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe clue to this came from another marine bacterium,
p74
aVand it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri.
p75
aVWhat you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab
p76
aVholding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium,
p77
aVa harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean,
p78
aVnamed Vibrio fischeri.
p79
aVThis bacterium has the special property that it makes light,
p80
aVso it makes bioluminescence,
p81
aVlike fireflies make light.
p82
aVWe're not doing anything to the cells here.
p83
aVWe just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room,
p84
aVand this is what we see.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhat was actually interesting to us
p87
aVwas not that the bacteria made light,
p88
aVbut when the bacteria made light.
p89
aVWhat we noticed is when the bacteria were alone,
p90
aVso when they were in dilute suspension, they made no light.
p91
aVBut when they grew to a certain cell number
p92
aVall the bacteria turned on light simultaneously.
p93
aVThe question that we had is how can bacteria, these primitive organisms,
p94
aVtell the difference from times when they're alone,
p95
aVand times when they're in a community,
p96
aVand then all do something together.
p97
aVWhat we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other,
p98
aVand they talk with a chemical language.
p99
aa(lp100
VThis is now supposed to be my bacterial cell.
p101
aVWhen it's alone it doesn't make any light.
p102
aVBut what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules
p103
aVthat you can think of like hormones,
p104
aVand these are the red triangles, and when the bacteria is alone
p105
aVthe molecules just float away and so no light.
p106
aVBut when the bacteria grow and double
p107
aVand they're all participating in making these molecules,
p108
aVthe molecule \u2014 the extracellular amount of that molecule
p109
aVincreases in proportion to cell number.
p110
aVAnd when the molecule hits a certain amount
p111
aVthat tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are,
p112
aVthey recognize that molecule
p113
aVand all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony.
p114
aVThat's how bioluminescence works \u2014
p115
aVthey're talking with these chemical words.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology.
p118
aVAgain, another plug for the animals in the ocean,
p119
aVVibrio fischeri lives in this squid.
p120
aVWhat you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid,
p121
aVand it's been turned on its back,
p122
aVand what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes
p123
aVand these house the Vibrio fischeri cells,
p124
aVthey live in there, at high cell number
p125
aVthat molecule is there, and they're making light.
p126
aVThe reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans
p127
aVis because it wants that light.
p128
aVThe way that this symbiosis works
p129
aVis that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii,
p130
aVjust in sort of shallow knee-deep water.
p131
aVThe squid is nocturnal, so during the day
p132
aVit buries itself in the sand and sleeps,
p133
aVbut then at night it has to come out to hunt.
p134
aVOn bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight
p135
aVthat light can penetrate the depth of the water
p136
aVthe squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water.
p137
aVWhat the squid has developed is a shutter
p138
aVthat can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria.
p139
aVThen it has detectors on its back
p140
aVso it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.
p141
aVAnd it opens and closes the shutter
p142
aVso the amount of light coming out of the bottom \u2014
p143
aVwhich is made by the bacterium \u2014
p144
aVexactly matches how much light hits the squid's back,
p145
aVso the squid doesn't make a shadow.
p146
aVIt actually uses the light from the bacteria
p147
aVto counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device
p148
aVso predators can't see its shadow,
p149
aVcalculate its trajectory, and eat it.
p150
aVThis is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VBut then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem
p155
aVbecause it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria
p156
aVand it can't sustain that.
p157
aVAnd so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up
p158
aVthe squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand,
p159
aVand it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm,
p160
aVand when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.
p161
aVNow the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone,
p162
aVso they're not making light \u2014
p163
aVbut of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.
p164
aVAnd as the day goes by the bacteria double,
p165
aVthey release the molecule, and then light comes on
p166
aVat night, exactly when the squid wants it.
p167
aa(lp168
VFirst we figured out how this bacterium does this,
p169
aVbut then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this
p170
aVto figure out really what's the mechanism.
p171
aVAnd what we found \u2014 so this is now supposed to be, again, my bacterial cell \u2014
p172
aVis that Vibrio fischeri has a protein \u2014
p173
aVthat's the red box \u2014 it's an enzyme that makes
p174
aVthat little hormone molecule, the red triangle.
p175
aVAnd then as the cells grow, they're all releasing that molecule
p176
aVinto the environment, so there's lots of molecule there.
p177
aVAnd the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface
p178
aVthat fits like a lock and key with that molecule.
p179
aVThese are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells.
p180
aVWhen the molecule increases to a certain amount \u2014
p181
aVwhich says something about the number of cells \u2014
p182
aVit locks down into that receptor
p183
aVand information comes into the cells
p184
aVthat tells the cells to turn on
p185
aVthis collective behavior of making light.
p186
aa(lp187
VWhy this is interesting is because in the past decade
p188
aVwe have found that this is not just some anomaly
p189
aVof this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean \u2014
p190
aVall bacteria have systems like this.
p191
aVSo now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other.
p192
aVThey make chemical words, they recognize those words,
p193
aVand they turn on group behaviors
p194
aVthat are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison.
p195
aVWe have a fancy name for this: we call it quorum sensing.
p196
aVThey vote with these chemical votes,
p197
aVthe vote gets counted, and then everybody responds to the vote.
p198
aa(lp199
VWhat's important for today's talk
p200
aVis that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors
p201
aVthat bacteria carry out in these collective fashions.
p202
aVBut the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence.
p203
aVIt's not like a couple bacteria get in you
p204
aVand they start secreting some toxins \u2014
p205
aVyou're enormous, that would have no effect on you. You're huge.
p206
aVWhat they do, we now understand,
p207
aVis they get in you, they wait, they start growing,
p208
aVthey count themselves with these little molecules,
p209
aVand they recognize when they have the right cell number
p210
aVthat if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together,
p211
aVthey are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.
p212
aVBacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing.
p213
aVThat's how it works.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe also then went to look at what are these molecules \u2014
p216
aVthese were the red triangles on my slides before.
p217
aVThis is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.
p218
aVThis is the word that it talks with.
p219
aVSo then we started to look at other bacteria,
p220
aVand these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered.
p221
aVWhat I hope you can see
p222
aVis that the molecules are related.
p223
aVThe left-hand part of the molecule is identical
p224
aVin every single species of bacteria.
p225
aVBut the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species.
p226
aVWhat that does is to confer
p227
aVexquisite species specificities to these languages.
p228
aVEach molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other.
p229
aVSo these are private, secret conversations.
p230
aVThese conversations are for intraspecies communication.
p231
aVEach bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language
p232
aVthat allows it to count its own siblings.
p233
aa(lp234
VOnce we got that far we thought
p235
aVwe were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.
p236
aVBut what we were really thinking about is that most of the time
p237
aVbacteria don't live by themselves, they live in incredible mixtures,
p238
aVwith hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria.
p239
aVAnd that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin.
p240
aVSo this is just a picture \u2014 a micrograph of your skin.
p241
aVAnywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this,
p242
aVand what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.
p243
aVAnd so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria,
p244
aVand it's about counting your neighbors,
p245
aVit's not enough to be able to only talk within your species.
p246
aVThere has to be a way to take a census
p247
aVof the rest of the bacteria in the population.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo we went back to molecular biology
p250
aVand started studying different bacteria,
p251
aVand what we've found now is that
p252
aVin fact, bacteria are multilingual.
p253
aVThey all have a species-specific system \u2014
p254
aVthey have a molecule that says "me."
p255
aVBut then, running in parallel to that is a second system
p256
aVthat we've discovered, that's generic.
p257
aVSo, they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal
p258
aVand it has its own receptor,
p259
aVand this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.
p260
aVIt's used by all different bacteria
p261
aVand it's the language of interspecies communication.
p262
aVWhat happens is that bacteria are able to count
p263
aVhow many of me and how many of you.
p264
aVThey take that information inside,
p265
aVand they decide what tasks to carry out
p266
aVdepending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority
p267
aVof any given population.
p268
aa(lp269
VThen again we turn to chemistry,
p270
aVand we figured out what this generic molecule is \u2014
p271
aVthat was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.
p272
aVIt's a very small, five-carbon molecule.
p273
aVWhat the important thing is that we learned
p274
aVis that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme
p275
aVand makes exactly the same molecule.
p276
aVSo they're all using this molecule
p277
aVfor interspecies communication.
p278
aVThis is the bacterial Esperanto.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VOnce we got that far, we started to learn
p283
aVthat bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language.
p284
aVBut what we started to think is that maybe there is something
p285
aVpractical that we can do here as well.
p286
aVI've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors,
p287
aVthey communicate with these molecules.
p288
aVOf course, I've also told you that one of the important things they do
p289
aVis to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing.
p290
aVWe thought, what if we made these bacteria
p291
aVso they can't talk or they can't hear?
p292
aVCouldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics?
p293
aa(lp294
VOf course, you've just heard and you already know
p295
aVthat we're running out of antibiotics.
p296
aVBacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now,
p297
aVand that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria.
p298
aVThey either pop the bacterial membrane,
p299
aVthey make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA.
p300
aVWe kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics
p301
aVand that selects for resistant mutants.
p302
aVAnd so now of course we have this global problem
p303
aVin infectious diseases.
p304
aVWe thought, well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications,
p305
aVjust make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count,
p306
aVand they don't know to launch virulence.
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd so that's exactly what we've done, and we've sort of taken two strategies.
p309
aVThe first one is we've targeted
p310
aVthe intraspecies communication system.
p311
aVSo we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules \u2014
p312
aVwhich you saw \u2014 but they're a little bit different.
p313
aVAnd so they lock into those receptors,
p314
aVand they jam recognition of the real thing.
p315
aVBy targeting the red system,
p316
aVwhat we are able to do is to make
p317
aVspecies-specific, or disease-specific, anti-quorum sensing molecules.
p318
aVWe've also done the same thing with the pink system.
p319
aVWe've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit
p320
aVso that we've made antagonists
p321
aVof the interspecies communication system.
p322
aVThe hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics
p323
aVthat work against all bacteria.
p324
aa(lp325
VTo finish I'll just show you the strategy.
p326
aVIn this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule,
p327
aVbut the logic is exactly the same.
p328
aVWhat you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal,
p329
aVin this case, a mouse,
p330
aVit doesn't initiate virulence right away.
p331
aVIt gets in, it starts growing, it starts secreting
p332
aVits quorum sensing molecules.
p333
aVIt recognizes when it has enough bacteria
p334
aVthat now they're going to launch their attack,
p335
aVand the animal dies.
p336
aVWhat we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections,
p337
aVbut we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules \u2014
p338
aVso these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing,
p339
aVbut they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide.
p340
aVWhat we now know is that if we treat the animal
p341
aVwith a pathogenic bacterium \u2014 a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium \u2014
p342
aVin the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule,
p343
aVin fact, the animal lives.
p344
aa(lp345
VWe think that this is the next generation of antibiotics
p346
aVand it's going to get us around, at least initially,
p347
aVthis big problem of resistance.
p348
aVWhat I hope you think, is that bacteria can talk to each other,
p349
aVthey use chemicals as their words,
p350
aVthey have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon
p351
aVthat we're just now starting to learn about.
p352
aVOf course what that allows bacteria to do
p353
aVis to be multicellular.
p354
aVSo in the spirit of TED they're doing things together
p355
aVbecause it makes a difference.
p356
aVWhat happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors,
p357
aVand they can carry out tasks
p358
aVthat they could never accomplish
p359
aVif they simply acted as individuals.
p360
aa(lp361
VWhat I would hope that I could further argue to you
p362
aVis that this is the invention of multicellularity.
p363
aVBacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years;
p364
aVhumans, couple hundred thousand.
p365
aVWe think bacteria made the rules
p366
aVfor how multicellular organization works.
p367
aVWe think, by studying bacteria,
p368
aVwe're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.
p369
aVWe know that the principles and the rules,
p370
aVif we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms,
p371
aVthe hope is that they will be applied
p372
aVto other human diseases and human behaviors as well.
p373
aVI hope that what you've learned
p374
aVis that bacteria can distinguish self from other.
p375
aVBy using these two molecules they can say "me" and they can say "you."
p376
aVAgain of course that's what we do,
p377
aVboth in a molecular way,
p378
aVand also in an outward way,
p379
aVbut I think about the molecular stuff.
p380
aa(lp381
VThis is exactly what happens in your body.
p382
aVIt's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day,
p383
aVand that's because there's all of this chemistry going on,
p384
aVthese molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is,
p385
aVand what their tasks should be.
p386
aVAgain, we think that bacteria invented that,
p387
aVand you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles,
p388
aVbut all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study.
p389
aa(lp390
VThe final thing is, again just to reiterate that there's this practical part,
p391
aVand so we've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules
p392
aVthat are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics.
p393
aVBut then, to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria
p394
aVthat live on the Earth,
p395
aVwe've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules.
p396
aVSo, we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.
p397
aVRemember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells
p398
aVin you or on you, keeping you healthy.
p399
aVWhat we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation
p400
aVof the bacteria that live as mutualists with you,
p401
aVin the hopes of making you more healthy,
p402
aVmaking those conversations better,
p403
aVso bacteria can do things that we want them to do
p404
aVbetter than they would be on their own.
p405
aa(lp406
VFinally, I wanted to show you
p407
aVthis is my gang at Princeton, New Jersey.
p408
aVEverything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.
p409
aVI hope when you learn things,
p410
aVlike about how the natural world works \u2014
p411
aVI just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper
p412
aVor you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world
p413
aVit was done by a child.
p414
aVScience is done by that demographic.
p415
aVAll of those people are between 20 and 30 years old,
p416
aVand they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country.
p417
aVIt's a really lucky demographic to work with.
p418
aVI keep getting older and older and they're always the same age,
p419
aVand it's just a crazy delightful job.
p420
aVI want to thank you for inviting me here.
p421
aVIt's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Applause)
p424
aa(lp425
VThanks.
p426

VMy mission in life since I was a kid was,
p5
aVand is, to take the rest of you into space.
p6
aVIt's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth,
p7
aVtake the people of Earth and transition off, permanently. And that's exciting.
p8
aVIn fact, I think it is a moral imperative
p9
aVthat we open the space frontier.
p10
aVYou know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance
p11
aVto have planetary redundancy,
p12
aVa chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere.
p13
aVAnd if you think about space,
p14
aVeverything we hold of value on this planet \u2014
p15
aVmetals and minerals and real estate and energy \u2014 is in infinite quantities in space.
p16
aa(lp17
VIn fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources.
p18
aVThe analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska.
p19
aVWe Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly.
p20
aVWe valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill.
p21
aVAnd then we discovered these things \u2014 gold and oil and fishing and timber \u2014
p22
aVand it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy,
p23
aVand now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space.
p24
aVWe are on the verge of the greatest exploration
p25
aVthat the human race has ever known.
p26
aa(lp27
VWe explore for three reasons,
p28
aVthe weakest of which is curiosity.
p29
aVYou know, it's funded NASA's budget up until now.
p30
aVSome images from Mars, 1997.
p31
aVIn fact, I think in the next decade, without any question,
p32
aVwe will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous
p33
aVunder the soils and different parts of that planet.
p34
aa(lp35
VThe stronger motivator, the much stronger motivator, is fear.
p36
aVIt drove us to the moon. We \u2014 literally in fear \u2014 with the Soviet Union
p37
aVraced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks,
p38
aVyou know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,
p39
aVand while the probability is very small,
p40
aVthe impact, figured in literally,
p41
aVof one of these hitting the Earth is so huge
p42
aVthat to spend a small fraction looking, searching,
p43
aVpreparing to defend, is not unreasonable.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd of course, the third motivator,
p46
aVone near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.
p47
aVIn fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,
p48
aVthere's a class of the nickel iron,
p49
aVwhich in platinum-group metal markets alone
p50
aVare worth something like 20 trillion dollars,
p51
aVif you can go out and grab one of these rocks.
p52
aVMy plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,
p53
aVand then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.
p54
aVAnd that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.
p55
aVBut fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.
p56
aVAnd for me, this is \u2014 I'm the short kid on the right.
p57
aVThis was \u2014 my motivation was actually during Apollo.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever.
p60
aVIf you think about what happened at the turn of \u2014 early 1960s,
p61
aVon May 25, JFK said, "We're going to go to the moon."
p62
aVAnd people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations
p63
aVto go and be part of this amazing mission.
p64
aVAnd we knew nothing about going to space.
p65
aVWe went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight
p66
aVto going to the moon in eight years,
p67
aVand the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.
p68
aVThey didn't know what couldn't be done.
p69
aVThey had to make up everything.
p70
aVAnd that, my friend, is amazing motivation.
p71
aVThis is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,
p72
aV"If I can go to the moon" \u2014 this is the last human on the moon so far \u2014
p73
aV"nothing, nothing is impossible." But of course,
p74
aVwe've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.
p77
aVThe government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.
p78
aVThe shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.
p79
aVThat's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.
p80
aVWe shouldn't be happy in standing for that.
p81
aVOne of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE
p82
aVwas take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.
p83
aVAs we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,
p84
aVwe should be allowed to risk.
p85
aVIn fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,
p86
aVjust needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,
p87
aVin fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.
p88
aVThe entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,
p89
aVand clearly the industrial-military complex \u2014
p90
aVwith Boeing and Lockheed and NASA \u2014 are the dinosaurs.
p91
aVThe ability for us to access these resources
p92
aVto gain planetary redundancy \u2014
p93
aVwe can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,
p94
aVyou know, everything stored on our databases,
p95
aVand back them up off the planet,
p96
aVin case there would be one of those disastrous situations.
p97
aa(lp98
VThe difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.
p99
aVOnce you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere \u2014
p100
aVthe moon, to Mars. And today,
p101
aVthere's only three vehicles \u2014 the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz
p102
aVand the Chinese vehicle \u2014 that gets you there.
p103
aVArguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.
p104
aVOne of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.
p105
aVWe've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz
p106
aVto go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.
p107
aVBut that's expensive and to understand what the potential is \u2014
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter) \u2014
p110
aa(lp111
Vit is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!
p112
aVYou know, one \u2014 we have a very unique period in time today.
p113
aVFor the first time ever, we have enough wealth
p114
aVconcentrated in the hands of few individuals
p115
aVand the technology accessible
p116
aVthat will allow us to really drive space exploration.
p117
aVBut how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.
p118
aVWe know \u2014 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,
p119
aVbut how cheap could it get?
p120
aa(lp121
VLet's go back to high school physics here.
p122
aVIf you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,
p123
aVto take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,
p124
aVand then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour \u2014
p125
aVremember, that one half MV squared \u2014 and you figure it out.
p126
aVIt's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.
p127
aVIf you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.
p128
aVIf you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,
p129
aVand they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour \u2014
p130
aVanybody here fast in math?
p131
aVHow much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?
p132
aV100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that \u2014
p133
aVwe need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,
p134
aVI'll grant you that.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VBut guys, if history has taught us anything,
p139
aVit's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.
p140
aVI have no question that the physics,
p141
aVthe engineering to get us down to the point
p142
aVwhere all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.
p143
aVThe difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment.
p144
aVToday, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar
p145
aVof their own money in R&D.
p146
aVIt's all government research dollars, and very few of those.
p147
aVAnd in fact, the large corporations,
p148
aVthe governments, can't take the risk.
p149
aVSo we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space.
p150
aVToday's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market?
p151
aV12 to 15 launches per year.
p152
aVNumber of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies.
p153
aVOne per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace,
p154
aVand I call them self-loading carbon payloads.
p155
aVThey come with their own money. They're easy to make.
p156
aVIt's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution,
p157
aVreading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship,
p160
aVcarry three people up to 100 kilometers,
p161
aVcome back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.
p162
aVTwenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition,
p163
aVspending between one to 25 million dollars each.
p164
aVAnd of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne,
p165
aVwhich made those two flights and won the competition.
p166
aVAnd I'd like to take you there, to that morning,
p167
aVfor just a quick video.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.
p170
aa(lp171
VRichard Searfoss: Good luck.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VRS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aa(lp179
VRS: So in my official capacity as the chief judge
p180
aVof the Ansari X PRIZE competition,
p181
aVI declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures
p182
aVhas indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VPeter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do
p187
aVwas raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible.
p188
aVWe went \u2014 I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.
p189
aVNo one believed it was done. Everyone said, "Oh, what does NASA think?
p190
aVWell, people are going to die,
p191
aVhow can you possibly going to put this forward?"
p192
aVI found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,
p193
aVand raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry
p196
aVand buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.
p197
aVSee, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,
p198
aVand said, "Are you going to compete?" No.
p199
aV"Are you going to compete?" No. "No one's going to win this thing."
p200
aVSo, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,
p201
aVand I took a bet that someone would win.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Applause)
p204
aa(lp205
VSo \u2014 and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VWe've had a lot of accomplishments
p210
aVand it's been a tremendous success.
p211
aVOne of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne
p212
aVis going to hang in Air and Space Museum,
p213
aVnext to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.
p214
aVIsn't that great? (Applause)
p215
aVSo a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.
p216
aVToday, you can go and experience weightless flights.
p217
aVBy '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin,
p218
aVis going to be about 200,000.
p219
aVThere are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly,
p220
aVI think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.
p221
aVOrbital flights \u2014 we can take you to the space station.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth \u2014
p224
aVI know if they don't do it, I am \u2014
p225
aVwe're going to stockpile some fuel,
p226
aVmake a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VQuick moment for the designers in the audience.
p231
aVWe spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights.
p232
aVHere are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan
p233
aVand my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity \u2014
p234
aVpeople think a zero gravity room,
p235
aVthere's a switch on there that turns it off \u2014
p236
aVbut it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane.
p237
aVAnd turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month.
p238
aVIf we can get the audio up?
p239
aa(lp240
V(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space,
p241
aVlook for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up.
p242
aVWhen you want the taste that won't weigh you down,
p243
aVthe only way to go is up.
p244
aa(lp245
VPD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this.
p246
aVWe're based down in Florida.
p247
aVLet me talk about the other thing I'm excited about.
p248
aVThe future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea.
p249
aVI had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize
p250
aVand the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward.
p251
aVAnd we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation
p252
aVto actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas,
p253
aVand we just took on a new mission statement:
p254
aV"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space
p255
aVand other technologies for the benefit of humanity."
p256
aVAnd this is something that we're very excited about.
p257
aVI showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd you know, when you give to a nonprofit,
p260
aVyou might have 50 cents on the dollar.
p261
aVIf you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.
p262
aVIf you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.
p263
aVAnd that's huge. And then he turned around and said,
p264
aV"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one."
p265
aVI said, "Well, that's great."
p266
aVSo, we have actually \u2014 are looking to turn the X PRIZE
p267
aVinto a world-class prize institute.
p268
aVThis is what happens when you put up a prize,
p269
aVwhen you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.
p270
aVYou get publicity increase, and when it's won,
p271
aVpublicity shoots through the roof \u2014 if it's properly managed \u2014
p272
aVand that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.
p273
aVThen, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,
p274
aVyou get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.
p275
aVAnd the benefit to the sponsors
p276
aVis the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.
p277
aVThat's our value proposition in a prize.
p278
aa(lp279
VIf you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne,
p280
aVor any kind of a new technology,
p281
aVyou have to fund that from the beginning
p282
aVand maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.
p283
aVIt may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize,
p284
aVthe beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee,
p285
aVand you pay on success.
p286
aVOrteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across \u2014
p287
aVtried to go across the Atlantic,
p288
aVand we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE.
p289
aVSo, prizes work great.
p290
aVYou know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there,
p291
aVyou know that when you're going for a goal,
p292
aVthe first thing you have to do is believe
p293
aVthat you can do it yourself.
p294
aVThen, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule
p295
aVof \u2014 that's a crazy idea, it'll never work.
p296
aVAnd then you have to convince others,
p297
aVso that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds,
p298
aVand then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies
p299
aVand institutions that don't want you to move those things forward,
p300
aVand you have to deal with failures. What a prize does,
p301
aVwhat we've experienced a prize doing,
p302
aVis literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things,
p303
aVbecause a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea.
p304
aVWell, it must be a good idea.
p305
aVSomeone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd each of these areas was something that we found
p308
aVthe Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation.
p309
aVSo, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process
p310
aVof how to come up with prizes and write the rules,
p311
aVand we're actually looking at creating prizes
p312
aVin a number of different categories.
p313
aVWe're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology \u2014
p314
aVand I'll talk about those more in a moment.
p315
aVAnd the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams
p316
aVwithin the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.
p317
aVWe're going after an orbital prize.
p318
aa(lp319
VWe are looking at a number of energy prizes.
p320
aVCraig Venter has just joined our board
p321
aVand we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,
p322
aVwe'll be announcing later this fall,
p323
aVabout \u2014 imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA
p324
aVfor under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.
p325
aVAnd clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.
p326
aVSo my final slide here is, the most critical tool
p327
aVfor solving humanity's grand challenges \u2014 it isn't technology,
p328
aVit isn't money, it's only one thing \u2014
p329
aVit's the committed, passionate human mind.

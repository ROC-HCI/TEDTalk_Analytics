VI'd like you all
p5
aVto ask yourselves a question
p6
aVwhich you may never have asked yourselves before:
p7
aVWhat is possible with the human voice?
p8
aVWhat is possible with the human voice?
p9
aV(Beatboxing)
p10
aV\u266a Ooh baby \u266a
p11
aV\u266a baby \u266a
p12
aV\u266a baby \u266a
p13
aV\u266a baby \u266a (Baby crying)
p14
aV\u266a baby \u266a (Baby crying)
p15
aV\u266a baby \u266a (Cat meowing)
p16
aV(Dog barking)
p17
aVYeah.
p18
aV(Applause)
p19
aV(Boomerang noises)
p20
aVIt was coming straight for me. I had to. It was, yeah.
p21
aVAs you can probably well imagine,
p22
aVI was a strange child.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVBecause the thing is, I was constantly trying
p25
aVto extend my repertoire of noises to be
p26
aVthe very maximum that it could be.
p27
aVI was constantly experimenting with these noises.
p28
aVAnd I'm still on that mission.
p29
aVI'm still trying to find every noise
p30
aVthat I can possibly make.
p31
aVAnd the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now,
p32
aVand I know that there's some noises
p33
aVI'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in
p34
aVby my physical body, and there's things it can't do.
p35
aVAnd there's things that no one's voice can do.
p36
aVFor example, no one can do two notes at the same time.
p37
aVYou can do two-tone singing,
p38
aVwhich monks can do, which is like...
p39
aV(Two-tone singing)
p40
aVBut that's cheating.
p41
aVAnd it hurts your throat.
p42
aVSo there's things you can't do, and these limitations
p43
aVon the human voice have always really annoyed me,
p44
aVbecause beatbox is the best way of getting
p45
aVmusical ideas out of your head and into the world,
p46
aVbut they're sketches at best,
p47
aVwhich is what's annoyed me.
p48
aVIf only, if only there was a way
p49
aVfor these ideas to come out unimpeded
p50
aVby the restrictions which my body gives it.
p51
aVSo I've been working with these guys,
p52
aVand we've made a machine.
p53
aVWe've made a system which is basically
p54
aVa live production machine,
p55
aVa real-time music production machine,
p56
aVand it enables me to, using nothing but my voice,
p57
aVcreate music in real time as I hear it in my head
p58
aVunimpeded by any physical restrictions
p59
aVthat my body might place on me.
p60
aVAnd I'm going to show you what it can do.
p61
aVAnd before I start making noises with it,
p62
aVand using it to manipulate my voice,
p63
aVI want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear
p64
aVis being made by my voice.
p65
aVThis system has \u2014
p66
aVthank you, beautiful assistant \u2014
p67
aVthis system has no sounds in it itself
p68
aVuntil I start putting sounds in it,
p69
aVso there's no prerecorded samples of any kind.
p70
aVSo once this thing really gets going,
p71
aVand it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it,
p72
aVit becomes not obvious that it is the human voice,
p73
aVbut it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit
p74
aVand start nice and simple.
p75
aVSo the polyphony problem: I've only got one voice.
p76
aVHow do I get around the problem
p77
aVof really wanting to have as many different voices
p78
aVgoing on at the same time.
p79
aVThe simplest way to do it is something like this.
p80
aV(Beatboxing)
p81
aVBy dancing. It's like this.
p82
aV(Music)
p83
aVThanks.
p84
aV(Applause)
p85
aVSo that's probably the easiest way.
p86
aVBut if you want to do something a little bit more immediate,
p87
aVsomething that you can't achieve with live looping,
p88
aVthere's other ways to layer your voice up.
p89
aVThere's things like pitch-shifting,
p90
aVwhich are awesome,
p91
aVand I'm going to show you now what that sounds like.
p92
aVSo I'm going to start another beat for you, like this.
p93
aV(Beatboxing)
p94
aVThere's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start,
p95
aVbecause it's just fun, so
p96
aVyou can clap along if you want.
p97
aVYou don't have to. It's fine. Check it out.
p98
aVI'm going to lay down a bass sound now.
p99
aV(Music)
p100
aVAnd now, a rockabilly guitar.
p101
aVWhich is nice. But what if I want to make, say, a \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p102
aVThanks. What if I want to make, say, a rock organ?
p103
aVIs that possible? Yes, it is,
p104
aVby recording myself like this.
p105
aV(Organ sound)
p106
aVAnd now I have that, I have that recorded.
p107
aVAssign it to a keyboard.
p108
aV(Music)
p109
aVSo that's cool.
p110
aV(Applause)
p111
aVBut what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd?
p112
aVImpossible, you say. No.
p113
aVIt is possible, and you can do it very simply
p114
aVusing this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out.
p115
aV(Music)
p116
aVSo every noise you can hear there is my voice.
p117
aVI didn't just trigger something which sounds like that.
p118
aVThere's no samples. There's no synthesizers.
p119
aVThat is literally all my voice being manipulated,
p120
aVand when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you,
p121
aVwhat's the point?
p122
aVWhy do this? (Laughter)
p123
aVBecause it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd,
p124
aVI suppose, is the easy answer.
p125
aVBut in actual fact, I haven't made this machine
p126
aVso that I can emulate things that already exist.
p127
aVI've made this so that I can make
p128
aVany noise that I can imagine.
p129
aVSo with your permission, I'm going to do
p130
aVsome things that are in my mind,
p131
aVand I hope you enjoy them,
p132
aVbecause they're rather unusual,
p133
aVespecially when you're doing things which are
p134
aVas unusual as this, it can be hard to believe
p135
aVthat it is all my voice, you see.
p136
aV(Voice effects)
p137
aV(Music)
p138
aVLike this.
p139
aV(Music)
p140
aVSo, loosely defined,
p141
aVthat is what's possible with the human voice.
p142
aVThank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

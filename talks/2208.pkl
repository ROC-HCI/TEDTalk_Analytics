VHello.
p5
aVI'm a toy developer.
p6
aVWith a dream of creating new toys that have never been seen before,
p7
aVI began working at a toy company nine years ago.
p8
aVWhen I first started working there,
p9
aVI proposed many new ideas to my boss every day.
p10
aVHowever, my boss always asked
p11
aVif I had the data to prove it would sell,
p12
aVand asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data.
p13
aVData, data, data.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product.
p16
aVHowever, I was unable to think of anything new at that moment.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVMy ideas were unoriginal.
p19
aVI wasn't getting any new ideas and I grew tired of thinking.
p20
aVIt was so hard that I became this skinny.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVIt's true. (Applause)
p23
aa(lp24
VYou've all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too.
p25
aVYour boss was being difficult. The data was difficult.
p26
aVYou become sick of thinking.
p27
aVNow, I throw out the data.
p28
aVIt's my dream to create new toys.
p29
aVAnd now, instead of data,
p30
aVI'm using a game called Shiritori to come up with new ideas.
p31
aa(lp32
VI would like to introduce this method today.
p33
aVWhat is Shiritori?
p34
aVTake apple, elephant  and trumpet, for example.
p35
aVIt's a game where  you take turns saying words
p36
aVthat start with the last letter of the previous word.
p37
aVIt's the same in Japanese and English.
p38
aVYou can play Shiritori as you like:
p39
aV"neko, kora, raibu, burashi," etc, etc. [Cat, cola, concert, brush]
p40
aVMany random words will come out.
p41
aVYou force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas.
p42
aVIn my case, for example, since I want to think of toys,
p43
aVwhat could a toy cat be?
p44
aVA cat that lands after doing a somersault from a high place?
p45
aVHow about a toy with cola?
p46
aVA toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet?
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VRidiculous ideas are okay. The key is to keep them flowing.
p50
aVThe more ideas you produce, you're sure to come up with some good ones, too.
p51
aVA brush, for example. Can we make a toothbrush into a toy?
p52
aVWe could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and \u2014
p53
aV(Music noises) \u2014
p54
aVyou've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth.
p55
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p56
aVKids who don't like to brush their teeth might begin to like it.
p57
aa(lp58
VCan we make a hat into a toy?
p59
aVHow about something like a roulette game, where you try the hat on one by one,
p60
aVand then, when someone puts it on, a scary alien breaks through the top
p61
aVscreaming, "Ahh!"
p62
aVI wonder if there would be a demand for this at parties?
p63
aa(lp64
VIdeas that didn't come out while you stare at the data will start to come out.
p65
aVActually, this bubble wrap, which is used to pack fragile objects,
p66
aVcombined with a toy, made Mugen Pop Pop,
p67
aVa toy where you can pop the bubbles as much as you like.
p68
aVIt was a big hit when it reached stores.
p69
aVData had nothing to do with its success.
p70
aVAlthough it's only popping bubbles,
p71
aVit's a great way to kill time,
p72
aVso please pass this around
p73
aVamongst yourselves today and play with it.
p74
aV(Applause)
p75
aa(lp76
VAnyway, you continue to come up with useless ideas.
p77
aVThink up many trivial ideas, everyone.
p78
aVIf you base your ideas on data analysis and know what you're aiming for,
p79
aVyou'll end up trying too hard,
p80
aVand you can't produce new ideas.
p81
aVEven if you know what your aim is,
p82
aVthink of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed.
p83
aVIf you do this, you surely will hit somewhere near the center.
p84
aVAt least one will.
p85
aVThat's the one you should choose.
p86
aVIf you do so, that idea will be in demand
p87
aVand, moreover, it will be brand new.
p88
aVThat is how I think of new ideas.
p89
aa(lp90
VIt doesn't have to be Shiritori; there are many different methods.
p91
aVYou just have to choose words at random.
p92
aVYou can flip through a dictionary and choose words at random.
p93
aVFor example, you could look up two random letters and gather the results
p94
aVor go to the store and connect product names
p95
aVwith what you want to think of.
p96
aVThe point is to gather random words,
p97
aVnot information from the category you're thinking for.
p98
aVIf you do this, the ingredients for the association of ideas are collected
p99
aVand form connections that will produce many ideas.
p100
aVThe greatest advantage to this method is the continuous flow of images.
p101
aVBecause you're thinking of one word after another,
p102
aVthe image of the previous word is still with you.
p103
aVThat image will automatically be related with future words.
p104
aVUnconsciously, a concert will be connected to a brush
p105
aVand a roulette game will be connected to a hat.
p106
aVYou wouldn't even realize it.
p107
aVYou can come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis method is, of course, not just for toys.
p110
aVYou can collect ideas for books, apps, events, and many other projects.
p111
aVI hope you all try this method.
p112
aVThere are futures that are born from data.
p113
aVHowever, using this silly game called Shiritori,
p114
aVI look forward to the exciting future you will create,
p115
aVa future you couldn't even imagine.
p116
aa(lp117
VThank you very much.

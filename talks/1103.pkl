VToday I want to talk about design,
p5
aVbut not design as we usually think about it.
p6
aVI want to talk about what is happening now
p7
aVin our scientific, biotechnological culture,
p8
aVwhere, for really the first time in history,
p9
aVwe have the power to design bodies,
p10
aVto design animal bodies,
p11
aVto design human bodies.
p12
aVIn the history of our planet,
p13
aVthere have been three great waves of evolution.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe first wave of evolution
p16
aVis what we think of as Darwinian evolution.
p17
aVSo, as you all know,
p18
aVspecies lived in particular ecological niches
p19
aVand particular environments,
p20
aVand the pressures of those environments
p21
aVselected which changes,
p22
aVthrough random mutation in species,
p23
aVwere going to be preserved.
p24
aVThen human beings stepped out
p25
aVof the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history
p26
aVand created the second great wave of evolution,
p27
aVwhich was we changed the environment
p28
aVin which we evolved.
p29
aVWe altered our ecological niche
p30
aVby creating civilization.
p31
aVAnd that has been the second great \u2014
p32
aVcouple 100,000 years, 150,000 years \u2014
p33
aVflow of our evolution.
p34
aVBy changing our environment,
p35
aVwe put new pressures
p36
aVon our bodies to evolve.
p37
aVWhether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,
p38
aVall the way through modern medicine,
p39
aVwe have changed our own evolution.
p40
aVNow we're entering a third great wave
p41
aVof evolutionary history,
p42
aVwhich has been called many things:
p43
aV"intentional evolution,"
p44
aV"evolution by design" \u2014
p45
aVvery different than intelligent design \u2014
p46
aVwhereby we are actually now
p47
aVintentionally designing and altering
p48
aVthe physiological forms that inhabit our planet.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that
p51
aVand then at the end talk a little bit
p52
aVabout what some of the implications are for us
p53
aVand for our species, as well as our cultures,
p54
aVbecause of this change.
p55
aVNow we actually have been doing it for a long time.
p56
aVWe started selectively breeding animals
p57
aVmany, many thousands of years ago.
p58
aVAnd if you think of dogs for example,
p59
aVdogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.
p60
aVThere isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.
p61
aVDogs are the result
p62
aVof selectively breeding traits that we like.
p63
aVBut we had to do it the hard way in the old days
p64
aVby choosing offspring that looked a particular way
p65
aVand then breeding them.
p66
aVWe don't have to do it that way anymore.
p67
aa(lp68
VThis is a beefalo.
p69
aVA beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.
p70
aVAnd they are now making them,
p71
aVand someday, perhaps pretty soon,
p72
aVyou will have beefalo patties
p73
aVin your local supermarket.
p74
aVThis is a geep,
p75
aVa goat-sheep hybrid.
p76
aVThe scientists that made this cute little creature
p77
aVended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.
p78
aVI think they said it tasted like chicken.
p79
aVThis is a cama.
p80
aVA cama is a camel-llama hybrid,
p81
aVcreated to try to get the hardiness of a camel
p82
aVwith some of the personality traits
p83
aVof a llama.
p84
aVAnd they are now using these in certain cultures.
p85
aVThen there's the liger.
p86
aVThis is the largest cat in the world \u2014
p87
aVthe lion-tiger hybrid.
p88
aVIt's bigger than a tiger.
p89
aVAnd in the case of the liger,
p90
aVthere actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.
p91
aVBut these were created by scientists
p92
aVusing both selective breeding and genetic technology.
p93
aVAnd then finally, everybody's favorite,
p94
aVthe zorse.
p95
aVNone of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.
p96
aVAnd so one of the things we've been doing
p97
aVis using genetic enhancement,
p98
aVor genetic manipulation,
p99
aVof normal selective breeding
p100
aVpushed a little bit through genetics.
p101
aVAnd if that were all this was about,
p102
aVthen it would be an interesting thing.
p103
aVBut something much, much more powerful
p104
aVis happening now.
p105
aa(lp106
VThese are normal mammalian cells
p107
aVgenetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene
p108
aVtaken out of deep-sea jellyfish.
p109
aVWe all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.
p110
aVWell, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,
p111
aVand put it into mammal cells.
p112
aVThese are normal cells.
p113
aVAnd what you see here
p114
aVis these cells glowing in the dark
p115
aVunder certain wavelengths of light.
p116
aVOnce they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.
p117
aVSo they did it with mouse pups,
p118
aVkittens.
p119
aVAnd by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green
p120
aVis because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral,
p121
aVwhile this is from jellyfish.
p122
aVThey did it with pigs.
p123
aVThey did it with puppies.
p124
aVAnd, in fact,
p125
aVthey did it with monkeys.
p126
aVAnd if you can do it with monkeys \u2014
p127
aVthough the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate
p128
aVis actually between monkeys and apes \u2014
p129
aVif they can do it in monkeys,
p130
aVthey can probably figure out how to do it in apes,
p131
aVwhich means they can do it in human beings.
p132
aVIn other words, it is theoretically possible
p133
aVthat before too long we will be biotechnologically capable
p134
aVof creating human beings
p135
aVthat glow in the dark.
p136
aVBe easier to find us at night.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd in fact, right now in many states,
p139
aVyou can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.
p140
aVThese are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver.
p141
aVThese are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered
p142
aVto be yellow, green, red,
p143
aVand they are actually available now in certain states.
p144
aVOther states have banned them.
p145
aVNobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.
p146
aVThere is no area of the government \u2014 not the EPA or the FDA \u2014
p147
aVthat controls genetically-engineered pets.
p148
aVAnd so some states have decided to allow them,
p149
aVsome states have decided to ban them.
p150
aa(lp151
VSome of you may have read
p152
aVabout the FDA's consideration right now
p153
aVof genetically-engineered salmon.
p154
aVThe salmon on top
p155
aVis a genetically engineered Chinook salmon,
p156
aVusing a gene from these salmon
p157
aVand from one other fish that we eat,
p158
aVto make it grow much faster
p159
aVusing a lot less feed.
p160
aVAnd right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision
p161
aVon whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish \u2014
p162
aVit'll be sold in the stores.
p163
aVAnd before you get too worried about it,
p164
aVhere in the United States,
p165
aVthe majority of food you buy in the supermarket
p166
aValready has genetically-modified components to it.
p167
aVSo even as we worry about it,
p168
aVwe have allowed it to go on in this country \u2014 much different in Europe \u2014
p169
aVwithout any regulation,
p170
aVand even without any identification on the package.
p171
aa(lp172
VThese are all the first cloned animals
p173
aVof their type.
p174
aVSo in the lower right here,
p175
aVyou have Dolly, the first cloned sheep \u2014
p176
aVnow happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh;
p177
aVRalph the rat, the first cloned rat;
p178
aVCC the cat, for cloned cat;
p179
aVSnuppy, the first cloned dog \u2014
p180
aVSnuppy for Seoul National University puppy \u2014
p181
aVcreated in South Korea
p182
aVby the very same man that some of you may remember
p183
aVhad to end up resigning in disgrace
p184
aVbecause he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.
p185
aVHe actually was the first person
p186
aVto clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,
p187
aVbecause dog genomes are very plastic.
p188
aVThis is Prometea, the first cloned horse.
p189
aVIt's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,
p190
aVa real "gold ring" of cloning,
p191
aVbecause there are many horses that win important races
p192
aVwho are geldings.
p193
aVIn other words, the equipment to put them out to stud
p194
aVhas been removed.
p195
aVBut if you can clone that horse,
p196
aVyou can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race
p197
aVand his identical genetic duplicate
p198
aVcan then be put out to stud.
p199
aVThese were the first cloned calves,
p200
aVthe first cloned grey wolves,
p201
aVand then, finally,
p202
aVthe first cloned piglets:
p203
aVAlexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VIn addition, we've started to use cloning technology
p208
aVto try to save endangered species.
p209
aVThis is the use of animals now
p210
aVto create drugs and other things in their bodies
p211
aVthat we want to create.
p212
aVSo with antithrombin in that goat \u2014
p213
aVthat goat has been genetically modified
p214
aVso that the molecules of its milk
p215
aVactually include the molecule of antithrombin
p216
aVthat GTC Genetics wants to create.
p217
aVAnd then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs,
p218
aVfrom the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea,
p219
aVare pigs that they are going to use, in fact,
p220
aVto try to create all kinds of drugs
p221
aVand other industrial types of chemicals
p222
aVthat they want the blood and the milk
p223
aVof these animals
p224
aVto produce for them,
p225
aVinstead of producing them in an industrial way.
p226
aa(lp227
VThese are two creatures
p228
aVthat were created
p229
aVin order to save endangered species.
p230
aVThe guar
p231
aVis an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.
p232
aVA somatic cell, a body cell,
p233
aVwas taken from its body,
p234
aVgestated in the ovum of a cow,
p235
aVand then that cow gave birth to a guar.
p236
aVSame thing happened with the mouflon,
p237
aVwhere it's an endangered species of sheep.
p238
aVIt was gestated in a regular sheep body,
p239
aVwhich actually raises an interesting biological problem.
p240
aVWe have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.
p241
aVWe have our nucleic DNA
p242
aVthat everybody thinks of as our DNA,
p243
aVbut we also have DNA in our mitochondria,
p244
aVwhich are the energy packets of the cell.
p245
aVThat DNA is passed down through our mothers.
p246
aVSo really, what you end up having here
p247
aVis not a guar and not a mouflon,
p248
aVbut a guar
p249
aVwith cow mitochondria,
p250
aVand therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,
p251
aVand a mouflon with another species of sheep's
p252
aVmitochondrial DNA.
p253
aVThese are really hybrids, not pure animals.
p254
aVAnd it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species
p255
aVin the age of biotechnology \u2014
p256
aVa question that we're not really sure yet
p257
aVhow to solve.
p258
aa(lp259
VThis lovely creature
p260
aVis an Asian cockroach.
p261
aVAnd what they've done here
p262
aVis they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain
p263
aVand then a transmitter on top,
p264
aVand it's on a big computer tracking ball.
p265
aVAnd now, using a joystick,
p266
aVthey can send this creature
p267
aVaround the lab
p268
aVand control whether it goes left or right,
p269
aVforwards or backwards.
p270
aVThey've created a kind of insect bot,
p271
aVor bugbot.
p272
aVIt gets worse than that \u2014 or perhaps better than that.
p273
aVThis actually is one of DARPA's very important \u2014
p274
aVDARPA is the Defense Research Agency \u2014
p275
aVone of their projects.
p276
aVThese goliath beetles
p277
aVare wired in their wings.
p278
aVThey have a computer chip strapped to their backs,
p279
aVand they can fly these creatures around the lab.
p280
aVThey can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.
p281
aVThey can't actually make them land.
p282
aVThey put them about one inch above the ground,
p283
aVand then they shut everything off and they go pfft.
p284
aVBut it's the closest they can get to a landing.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd in fact, this technology has gotten so developed
p287
aVthat this creature \u2014
p288
aVthis is a moth \u2014
p289
aVthis is the moth in its pupa stage,
p290
aVand that's when they put the wires in
p291
aVand they put in the computer technology,
p292
aVso that when the moth actually emerges as a moth,
p293
aVit is already prewired.
p294
aVThe wires are already in its body,
p295
aVand they can just hook it up to their technology,
p296
aVand now they've got these bugbots
p297
aVthat they can send out for surveillance.
p298
aVThey can put little cameras on them
p299
aVand perhaps someday deliver
p300
aVother kinds of ordinance
p301
aVto warzones.
p302
aa(lp303
VIt's not just insects.
p304
aVThis is the ratbot, or the robo-rat
p305
aVby Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.
p306
aVAgain, it's got technology \u2014
p307
aVit's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres;
p308
aVit's got a camera on top of its head.
p309
aVThe scientists can make this creature
p310
aVgo left, right.
p311
aVThey have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.
p312
aVThey've now created an organic robot.
p313
aVThe graduate students
p314
aVin Sanjiv Talwar's lab
p315
aVsaid, "Is this ethical?
p316
aVWe've taken away the autonomy of this animal."
p317
aVI'll get back to that in a minute.
p318
aa(lp319
VThere's also been work done with monkeys.
p320
aVThis is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.
p321
aVHe took owl monkeys,
p322
aVwired them up
p323
aVso that a computer watched their brains while they moved,
p324
aVespecially looking at the movement of their right arm.
p325
aVThe computer learned what the monkey brain did
p326
aVto move its arm in various ways.
p327
aVThey then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,
p328
aVwhich you see here in the picture,
p329
aVput the arm in another room.
p330
aVPretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves,
p331
aVto make that arm in the other room
p332
aVdo whatever the monkey's arm did.
p333
aVThen he put a video monitor
p334
aVin the monkey's cage
p335
aVthat showed the monkey this prosthetic arm,
p336
aVand the monkey got fascinated.
p337
aVThe monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm,
p338
aVthis prosthetic arm would do.
p339
aVAnd eventually she was moving it and moving it,
p340
aVand eventually stopped moving her right arm
p341
aVand, staring at the screen,
p342
aVcould move the prosthetic arm in the other room
p343
aVonly with her brainwaves \u2014
p344
aVwhich means that monkey
p345
aVbecame the first primate in the history of the world
p346
aVto have three independent functional arms.
p347
aa(lp348
VAnd it's not just technology
p349
aVthat we're putting into animals.
p350
aVThis is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.
p351
aVHe took 20,000 and then 60,000
p352
aVdisaggregated rat neurons \u2014
p353
aVso these are just individual neurons from rats \u2014
p354
aVput them on a chip.
p355
aVThey self-aggregated into a network,
p356
aVbecame an integrated chip.
p357
aVAnd he used that
p358
aVas the IT piece
p359
aVof a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.
p360
aVSo now we have organic computer chips
p361
aVmade out of living, self-aggregating neurons.
p362
aVFinally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern
p363
aVtook a completely intact,
p364
aVindependent lamprey eel brain.
p365
aVThis is a brain from a lamprey eel.
p366
aVIt is living \u2014
p367
aVfully-intact brain in a nutrient medium
p368
aVwith these electrodes going off to the sides,
p369
aVattached photosensitive sensors to the brain,
p370
aVput it into a cart \u2014
p371
aVhere's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle \u2014
p372
aVand using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,
p373
aVwhen you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,
p374
aVthe cart moves toward the light;
p375
aVwhen you turn it off, it moves away.
p376
aVIt's photophilic.
p377
aVSo now we have a complete
p378
aVliving lamprey eel brain.
p379
aVIs it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,
p380
aVsitting there in its nutrient medium?
p381
aVI don't know,
p382
aVbut in fact it is a fully living brain
p383
aVthat we have managed to keep alive
p384
aVto do our bidding.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo, we are now at the stage
p387
aVwhere we are creating creatures
p388
aVfor our own purposes.
p389
aVThis is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti
p390
aVof the University of Massachusetts.
p391
aVHe altered this mouse
p392
aVso that it was genetically engineered
p393
aVto have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,
p394
aVput a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it
p395
aVand created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse
p396
aVand transplanted onto a human being.
p397
aVGenetic engineering
p398
aVcoupled with polymer physiotechnology
p399
aVcoupled with xenotransplantation.
p400
aVThis is where we are in this process.
p401
aa(lp402
VFinally, not that long ago,
p403
aVCraig Venter created the first artificial cell,
p404
aVwhere he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,
p405
aVwhich is a machine,
p406
aVcreated an artificial genome,
p407
aVput it in a different cell \u2014
p408
aVthe genome was not of the cell he put it in \u2014
p409
aVand that cell then reproduced
p410
aVas the other cell.
p411
aVIn other words,
p412
aVthat was the first creature in the history of the world
p413
aVthat had a computer as its parent \u2014
p414
aVit did not have an organic parent.
p415
aVAnd so, asks The Economist:
p416
aV"The first artificial organism and its consequences."
p417
aa(lp418
VSo you may have thought
p419
aVthat the creation of life
p420
aVwas going to happen in something that looked like that.
p421
aV(Laughter)
p422
aVBut in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.
p423
aVThis is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.
p424
aVThis is a DNA synthesizer,
p425
aVand here at the bottom
p426
aVare just bottles of A, T, C and G \u2014
p427
aVthe four chemicals
p428
aVthat make up our DNA chain.
p429
aa(lp430
VAnd so, we need to ask ourselves some questions.
p431
aVFor the first time in the history of this planet,
p432
aVwe are able to directly design organisms.
p433
aVWe can manipulate the plasmas of life
p434
aVwith unprecedented power,
p435
aVand it confers on us a responsibility.
p436
aVIs everything okay?
p437
aVIs it okay to manipulate and create
p438
aVwhatever creatures we want?
p439
aVDo we have free reign
p440
aVto design animals?
p441
aVDo we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us
p442
aVand say, "Look, I want a dog.
p443
aVI'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund,
p444
aVthe body of a retriever,
p445
aVmaybe some pink fur,
p446
aVand let's make it glow in the dark"?
p447
aVDoes industry get to create creatures
p448
aVwho, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva
p449
aVand other bodily fluids,
p450
aVcreate the drugs and industrial molecules we want
p451
aVand then warehouse them
p452
aVas organic manufacturing machines?
p453
aVDo we get to create organic robots,
p454
aVwhere we remove the autonomy from these animals
p455
aVand turn them just into our playthings?
p456
aa(lp457
VAnd then the final step of this,
p458
aVonce we perfect these technologies in animals
p459
aVand we start using them in human beings,
p460
aVwhat are the ethical guidelines
p461
aVthat we will use then?
p462
aVIt's already happening. It's not science fiction.
p463
aVWe are not only already using these things in animals,
p464
aVsome of them we're already beginning to use
p465
aVon our own bodies.
p466
aa(lp467
VWe are now taking control of our own evolution.
p468
aVWe are directly designing
p469
aVthe future of the species of this planet.
p470
aVIt confers upon us an enormous responsibility
p471
aVthat is not just the responsibility
p472

VThe world is filled with incredible objects
p5
aVand rich cultural heritage.
p6
aVAnd when we get access to them,
p7
aVwe are blown away, we fall in love.
p8
aVBut most of the time,
p9
aVthe world's population is living without real access to arts and culture.
p10
aVWhat might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage,
p11
aVthe beautiful locations and the art in this world?
p12
aa(lp13
VBefore we get started in this presentation,
p14
aVI just want to take care of a few housekeeping points.
p15
aVFirst, I am no expert in art or culture.
p16
aVI fell into this by mistake, but I'm loving it.
p17
aVSecondly, all of what I'm going to show you
p18
aVbelongs to the amazing museums, archives and foundations
p19
aVthat we partner with.
p20
aVNone of this belongs to Google.
p21
aVAnd finally, what you see behind me
p22
aVis available right now on your mobile phones,
p23
aVon your laptops.
p24
aa(lp25
VThis is our current platform, where you can explore
p26
aVthousands of museums and objects at your fingertips,
p27
aVin extremely high-definition detail.
p28
aVThe diversity of the content is what's amazing.
p29
aVIf we just had European paintings,
p30
aVif we just had modern art,
p31
aVI think it gets a bit boring.
p32
aVFor example, this month, we launched the "Black History" channel
p33
aVwith 82 curated exhibitions,
p34
aVwhich talk about arts and culture in that community.
p35
aVWe also have some amazing objects from Japan,
p36
aVcentered around craftsmanship, called "Made in Japan."
p37
aVAnd one of my favorite exhibitions,
p38
aVwhich actually is the idea of my talk,
p39
aVis \u2014 I didn't expect to become a fan of Japanese dolls.
p40
aVBut I am, thanks to this exhibition,
p41
aVthat has really taught me about the craftsmanship
p42
aVbehind the soul of a Japanese doll.
p43
aVTrust me, it's very exciting.
p44
aVTake my word for it.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, moving on swiftly.
p47
aVOne quick thing I wanted to showcase in this platform,
p48
aVwhich you can share with your kids and your friends right now,
p49
aVis you can travel to all these amazing institutions virtually, as well.
p50
aVOne of our recent ideas was with The Guggenheim Museum in New York,
p51
aVwhere you can get a taste of what it might feel like
p52
aVto actually be there.
p53
aVYou can go to the ground floor
p54
aVand obviously, most of you, I assume, have been there.
p55
aVAnd you can see the architectural masterpiece that it is.
p56
aVBut imagine this accessibility for a kid in Bombay
p57
aVwho's studying architecture,
p58
aVwho hasn't had a chance to go to The Guggenheim as yet.
p59
aVYou can obviously look at objects in the Guggenheim Museum,
p60
aVyou can obviously get into them and so on and so forth.
p61
aVThere's a lot of information here.
p62
aa(lp63
VBut this is not the purpose of my talk today.
p64
aVThis exists right now.
p65
aVWhat we now have are the building blocks to a very exciting future,
p66
aVwhen it comes to arts and culture
p67
aVand accessibility to arts and culture.
p68
aVSo I am joined today onstage by my good friend and artist in residence
p69
aVat our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,
p70
aVwho is the professor of interactive design
p71
aVat ECAL University in Lausanne, Switzerland.
p72
aVWhat Cyril and our team of engineers have been doing
p73
aVis trying to find these connections and visualize a few of these.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo I'm going to go quite quick now.
p76
aVThis object you see behind me \u2014 oh, just clarification:
p77
aVAlways, seeing the real thing is better.
p78
aVIn case people think I'm trying to replicate the real thing.
p79
aVSo, moving on.
p80
aVThis object you see behind me is the Venus of Berekhat Ram.
p81
aVIt's one of the oldest objects in the world,
p82
aVfound in the Golan Heights around 233,000 years ago,
p83
aVand currently residing at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
p84
aVIt is also one of the oldest objects on our platform.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo let's zoom.
p87
aVWe start from this one object.
p88
aVWhat if we zoomed out
p89
aVand actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang?
p90
aVWhat might that look like?
p91
aVThis is what we deal with on a daily basis at the Cultural Institute \u2014
p92
aVover six million cultural artifacts curated and given to us by institutions,
p93
aVto actually make these connections.
p94
aVYou can travel through time,
p95
aVyou can understand more about our society through these.
p96
aVYou can look at it from the perspective of our planet,
p97
aVand try to see how it might look without borders,
p98
aVif we just organized art and culture.
p99
aVWe can also then plot it by time,
p100
aVwhich obviously, for the data geek in me, is very fascinating.
p101
aVYou can spend hours looking at every decade
p102
aVand the contributions in that decade and in those years
p103
aVfor art, history and cultures.
p104
aVWe would love to spend hours showing you each and every decade,
p105
aVbut we don't have the time right now.
p106
aVSo you can go on your phone and actually do it yourself.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Applause)
p109
aa(lp110
VBut if you don't mind and can hold your applause till later,
p111
aVI don't want to run out of time,
p112
aVbecause I want to show you a lot of cool stuff.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo, just very quickly:
p115
aVyou can move on from here to another very interesting idea.
p116
aVBeyond the pretty picture,
p117
aVbeyond the nice visualization,
p118
aVwhat is the purpose, how is this useful?
p119
aVThis next idea comes from discussions with curators
p120
aVthat we've been having at museums,
p121
aVwho, by the way, I've fallen in love with,
p122
aVbecause they dedicate their whole life to try to tell these stories.
p123
aVOne of the curators told me, "Amit, what would it be like
p124
aVif you could create a virtual curator's table
p125
aVwhere all these six million objects
p126
aVare displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them?"
p127
aVYou can spend a lot of time, trust me, looking at different objects
p128
aVand understanding where they come from.
p129
aVIt's a crazy Matrix experience.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VJust moving on,
p134
aVlet's take the world-famous Vincent Van Gogh,
p135
aVwho is very well-represented on this platform.
p136
aVThanks to the diversity of the institutions we have,
p137
aVwe have over 211 high-definition, amazing artworks by this artist,
p138
aVnow organized in one beautiful view.
p139
aVAnd as it resolves, and as Cyril goes deeper,
p140
aVyou can see all the self-portraits,
p141
aVyou can see still life.
p142
aVBut I just wanted to highlight one very quick example,
p143
aVwhich is very timely:
p144
aV"The Bedroom."
p145
aVThis is an artwork where three copies exist \u2014
p146
aVone at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,
p147
aVone at the Orsay in Paris
p148
aVand one at the Art Institute of Chicago,
p149
aVwhich, actually, currently is hosting a reunion
p150
aVof all three artworks physically,
p151
aVI think only for the second time ever.
p152
aVBut, it is united digitally and virtually for anybody to look at
p153
aVin a very different way,
p154
aVand you won't get pushed in the line in the crowd.
p155
aVSo let's take you and let's travel through "The Bedroom" very quickly,
p156
aVso you can experience what we are doing for every single object.
p157
aVWe want the image to speak as much as it can
p158
aVon a digital platform.
p159
aVAnd all you need is an internet connection and a computer
p160
aa(lp161
V(Applause)
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.
p164
aVI'm sorry, this is all live,
p165
aVso you have to give Cyril a little bit of \u2014
p166
aVand this is available for every object:
p167
aVmodern art, contemporary art, Renaissance \u2014 you name it,
p168
aVeven sculpture.
p169
aa(lp170
VSometimes, you don't know what can attract you
p171
aVto an artwork or to a museum or to a cultural discovery.
p172
aVSo for me, personally, it was quite a challenge
p173
aVbecause when I decided to make this my full-time job at Google,
p174
aVmy mother was not very supportive.
p175
aVI love my mother,
p176
aVbut she thought I was wasting my life with this museum stuff.
p177
aVAnd for her, a museum is what you do when you go on vacation
p178
aVand you tick-mark and it's over, right?
p179
aVAnd it took around four and a half years
p180
aVfor me to convince my lovely Indian mother
p181
aVthat actually, this is worthwhile.
p182
aVAnd the way I did it was, I realized one day that she loves gold.
p183
aVSo I started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them.
p184
aVAnd the first thing my mom asks me is,
p185
aV"How can we buy these?"
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd obviously, my salary is not that high,
p190
aVso I was like, "We can't actually do that, mom.
p191
aVBut you can explore them virtually."
p192
aVAnd so now my mom \u2014 every time I meet her, she asks me,
p193
aV"Any more gold, any more silver in your project? Can you show me?"
p194
aVAnd that's the idea I'm trying to illustrate.
p195
aVIt does not matter how you get in,
p196
aVas long as you get in.
p197
aVOnce you get in, you're hooked.
p198
aa(lp199
VMoving on from here very quickly,
p200
aVthere is kind of a playful idea, actually,
p201
aVto illustrate the point of access,
p202
aVand I'm going to go quite quickly on this one.
p203
aVWe all know that seeing the artwork in person is amazing.
p204
aVBut we also know that most of us can't do it,
p205
aVand the ones that can afford to do it, it's complicated.
p206
aVSo \u2014 Cyril, can we load up our art trip, what do we call it?
p207
aVWe don't have a good name for this.
p208
aVBut essentially, we have around 1,000 amazing institutions,
p209
aV68 countries.
p210
aVBut let's start with Rembrandt.
p211
aVWe might have time for only one example.
p212
aVBut thanks to the diversity,
p213
aVwe've got around 500 amazing Rembrandt object artworks
p214
aVfrom 46 institutions and 17 countries.
p215
aVLet's say that on your next vacation,
p216
aVyou want to go see every single one of them.
p217
aVThat is your itinerary,
p218
aVyou will probably travel 53,000 kilometers,
p219
aVvisit around, I think, 46 institutions,
p220
aVand just FYI, you might release 10 tons of CO2 emissions.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VBut remember, it's art,
p225
aVso you can justify it, perhaps, in some way.
p226
aa(lp227
VMoving on swiftly from here,
p228
aVis something a little bit more technical and more interesting.
p229
aVAll that we've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections.
p230
aVBut obviously we have something cool nowadays
p231
aVthat everyone likes to talk about, which is machine learning.
p232
aVSo what we thought is, let's strip out all the metadata,
p233
aVlet's look at what machine learning can do
p234
aVbased purely on visual recognition of this entire collection.
p235
aVWhat we ended up with is this very interesting map,
p236
aVthese clusters that have no reference point information,
p237
aVbut has just used visuals to cluster things together.
p238
aVEach cluster is an art to us by itself of discovery.
p239
aVBut one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly
p240
aVis this amazing cluster of portraits
p241
aVthat we found from museums around the world.
p242
aVIf you could zoom in a little bit more, Cyril.
p243
aVJust to show you, you can just travel through portraits.
p244
aVAnd essentially, you can do nature, you can do horses
p245
aVand clusters galore.
p246
aa(lp247
VWhen we saw all these portraits,
p248
aVwe were like, "Hey, can we do something fun for kids,
p249
aVor can we do something playful
p250
aVto get people interested in portraits?"
p251
aVBecause I haven't really seen
p252
aVyoung kids really excited to go to a portrait gallery.
p253
aVI wanted to try to figure something out.
p254
aVSo we created something called the portrait matcher.
p255
aVIt's quite self-explanatory,
p256
aVso I'm just going to let Cyril show his beautiful face.
p257
aVAnd essentially what's happening is, with the movement of his head,
p258
aVwe are matching different portraits around the world from museums.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd I don't know about you,
p263
aVbut I've shown it to my nephew and sister,
p264
aVand the reaction is just phenomenal.
p265
aVAll they ask me is, "When can we go see this?"
p266
aVAnd by the way, if we're nice,
p267
aVmaybe, Cyril, you can smile and find a happy one?
p268
aVOh, perfect.
p269
aVBy the way, this is not rehearsed.
p270
aVCongrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.
p271
aVOK, let's move on; otherwise, this will just take the whole time.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)
p274
aa(lp275
VSo, art and culture can be fun also, right?
p276
aVFor our last quick experiment \u2014
p277
aVwe call all of these "experiments" \u2014
p278
aVour last quick experiment comes back to machine learning.
p279
aVWe show you clusters, visual clusters,
p280
aVbut what if we could ask the machine to also name these clusters?
p281
aVWhat if it could automatically tag them, using no actual metadata?
p282
aVSo what we have is this kind of explorer,
p283
aVwhere we have managed to match, I think, around 4,000 labels.
p284
aVAnd we haven't really done anything special here,
p285
aVjust fed the collection.
p286
aVAnd we found interesting categories.
p287
aVWe can start with horses, a very straightforward category.
p288
aVYou would expect to see that the machine has put
p289
aVimages of horses, right?
p290
aVAnd it has, but you also notice, right over there,
p291
aVthat it has a very abstract image
p292
aVthat it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses.
p293
aVWe also have an amazing head in terms of a horse.
p294
aVAnd each one has the tags as to why it got categorized in this.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo let's move to another one which I found very funny and interesting,
p297
aVbecause I don't understand how this category came up.
p298
aVIt's called "Lady in Waiting."
p299
aVIf, Cyril, you do it very quickly,
p300
aVyou will see that we have these amazing images
p301
aVof ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.
p302
aVI don't really understand it.
p303
aVBut I've been trying to ask my museum contacts,
p304
aVyou know, "What is this? What's going on here?"
p305
aVAnd it's fascinating.
p306
aa(lp307
VComing back to gold very quickly,
p308
aVI wanted to search for gold
p309
aVand see how the machine tagged all the gold.
p310
aVBut, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.
p311
aVWe are living in popular times.
p312
aVIt tags it as "bling-bling."
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VI'm being hard on Cyril, because I'm moving too fast.
p317
aVEssentially, here you have all the bling-bling
p318
aVof the world's museums organized for you.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd finally, to end this talk and these experiments,
p321
aVwhat I hope you feel after this talk is happiness and emotion.
p322
aVAnd what would we see when we see happiness?
p323
aVIf we actually look at all the objects
p324
aVthat have been tagged under "happiness,"
p325
aVyou would expect happiness, I guess.
p326
aVBut there was one that came up that was very fascinating and interesting,
p327
aVwhich was this artwork by Douglas Coupland,
p328
aVour friend and artist in residence as well,
p329
aVcalled, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain."
p330
aVI don't know why the machine feels like it misses its pre-Internet brain
p331
aVand it's been tagged here,
p332
aVbut it's a very interesting thought.
p333
aVI sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,
p334
aVbut not when it comes to exploring arts and culture online.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo take out your phones, take out your computers,
p337
aVgo visit museums.
p338
aVAnd just a quick call-out to all the amazing archivists,
p339
aVhistorians, curators,
p340
aVwho are sitting in museums, preserving all this culture.
p341
aVAnd the least we can do is get our daily dose of art and culture
p342
aVfor ourselves and our kids.
p343
aa(lp344
VThank you.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Applause)

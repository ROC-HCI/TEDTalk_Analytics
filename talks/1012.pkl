VSo, a funny thing happened
p5
aVon my way to becoming a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist:
p6
aVI had a baby.
p7
aVAnd that's not to say
p8
aVI ever went on to become a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist.
p9
aVSorry, TED.
p10
aVBut I did go on to be a reasonably astute,
p11
aVarguably world-class worrier.
p12
aVOne of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie,
p13
aVsaid, "Kim, I figured it out.
p14
aVIt's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else;
p15
aVit's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are."
p16
aa(lp17
VSo in the spirit of full disclosure,
p18
aVI brought some pictures to share.
p19
aVAwwww.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VI'll just say: July.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VZip!
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VFor safety.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VWater wings \u2014
p36
aVan inch of water.
p37
aVAnd then, finally, all suited up
p38
aVfor the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain.
p39
aVSo you can get kind of a feel for this.
p40
aVSo my baby, Vander, is eight years old now.
p41
aVAnd, despite being cursed with my athletic inability,
p42
aVhe plays soccer.
p43
aVHe's interested in playing football.
p44
aVHe wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo why would I worry?
p47
aVBecause this is what I do. This is what I teach.
p48
aVIt's what I study. It's what I treat.
p49
aVAnd I know that kids get concussed every year.
p50
aVIn fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year,
p51
aVand these data are just among kids under 14
p52
aVwho were seen in emergency rooms.
p53
aVAnd so when kids sustain a concussion,
p54
aVwe talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung,
p55
aVbut what is it that we're really talking about?
p56
aVLet's take a look.
p57
aa(lp58
V[Concussive Force]
p59
aa(lp60
V"Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes.
p61
aVSo, a car accident.
p62
aVForty miles an hour into a fixed barrier:
p63
aV35 Gs.
p64
aVA heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face:
p65
aV58 Gs.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Music)
p68
aa(lp69
VIn case you missed it, we'll look again.
p70
aVSo look to the right-hand side of the screen.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Music)
p73
aa(lp74
VWhat would you say?
p75
aVHow many Gs?
p76
aVClose.
p77
aVSeventy-two?
p78
aVWould it be crazy to know:
p79
aV103 Gs?
p80
aVThe average concussive impact
p81
aVis 95 Gs.
p82
aVNow, when the kid on the right doesn't get up,
p83
aVwe know they've had a concussion.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut how about the kid on the left,
p86
aVor the athlete that leaves the field of play?
p87
aVHow do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion?
p88
aVHow do we know
p89
aVthat legislation that would require they be pulled from play,
p90
aVcleared for return to play,
p91
aVapplies to them?
p92
aVThe definition of concussion
p93
aVdoesn't actually require a loss of consciousness.
p94
aVIt requires only a change in consciousness,
p95
aVand that can be any one or a number of symptoms,
p96
aVincluding feeling foggy, feeling dizzy,
p97
aVhearing a ringing in your ear,
p98
aVbeing more impulsive or hostile than usual.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am,
p101
aVhow do I get any sleep at all?
p102
aVBecause I know our brains are resilient.
p103
aVThey're designed to recover from an injury.
p104
aVIf \u2014 God forbid \u2014
p105
aVany of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion,
p106
aVmost of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours
p107
aVto a couple of weeks.
p108
aVBut kids are more vulnerable to brain injury.
p109
aVIn fact, high-school athletes are three times more likely
p110
aVto sustain catastrophic injuries
p111
aVrelative even to their college-age peers,
p112
aVand it takes them longer to return to a symptom-free baseline.
p113
aVAfter that first injury,
p114
aVtheir risk for second injury is exponentially greater.
p115
aVFrom there, their risk for a third injury, greater still, and so on.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd here's the really alarming part:
p118
aVWe don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries.
p119
aVYou guys may be familiar with this research
p120
aVthat's coming out of the NFL.
p121
aVIn a nutshell, this research suggests that,
p122
aVamong retired NFL players with three or more career concussions,
p123
aVthe incidence of early-onset dementing disease
p124
aVis much greater than it is for the general population.
p125
aVSo you've all seen that \u2014 New York Times, you've seen it.
p126
aVWhat you may not be familiar with
p127
aVis that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said,
p128
aV"Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband
p129
aVis forever losing his keys?"
p130
aV"Isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband
p131
aVis forever losing the car?"
p132
aV"Isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband
p133
aVis forever losing his way home
p134
aVin the car, from the driveway?"
p135
aVI may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child.
p136
aVSo it's going to be really important
p137
aVthat he be able to drive me around someday.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VSo, how do we guarantee the safety of our kids?
p142
aVHow can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids?
p143
aVLet me tell you what I've come up with.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VIf only.
p148
aVMy little boy's right there, and he's like, "She's not kidding.
p149
aVShe's totally not kidding."
p150
aVSo in all seriousness:
p151
aVShould my kid play football?
p152
aVShould your kid play football?
p153
aVI don't know.
p154
aVBut I do know there are three things you can do.
p155
aVThe first: study up.
p156
aVYou have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today.
p157
aVThere are some great resources out there.
p158
aa(lp159
VThe CDC has a program, HEADS UP.
p160
aVIt's at CDC.gov.
p161
aVHEADS UP is specific to concussion in kids.
p162
aVThe second is a resource I'm personally really proud of.
p163
aVWe've just rolled this out in the last couple months \u2014
p164
aVCO Kids With Brain Injury.
p165
aVThis is a great resource for student athletes,
p166
aVteachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff.
p167
aVIt's a great place to start if you have questions.
p168
aa(lp169
VThe second thing is: speak up.
p170
aVJust two weeks ago,
p171
aVa bill introduced by Senator Kefalas
p172
aVthat would have required athletes, kids under 18,
p173
aVto wear a helmet when they're riding their bike,
p174
aVdied in committee.
p175
aVIt died, in large part,
p176
aVbecause it lacked constituent buy-in;
p177
aVit lacked stakeholder traction.
p178
aVNow, I'm not here to tell you
p179
aVwhat kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support,
p180
aVbut I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you,
p181
aVyour legislators need to know that.
p182
aa(lp183
VSpeak up also with coaching staff.
p184
aVAsk about what kind of protective equipment is available.
p185
aVWhat's the budget for protective equipment?
p186
aVHow old it is?
p187
aVMaybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear.
p188
aa(lp189
VWhich brings us to: suit up.
p190
aVWear a helmet.
p191
aVThe only way to prevent a bad outcome
p192
aVis to prevent that first injury from happening.
p193
aVRecently, one of my graduate students, Tom, said,
p194
aV"Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet on the way to class."
p195
aVAnd Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet
p196
aVcan reduce the g-force of impact by half.
p197
aVNow, I thought it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade,
p198
aVthis epiphany of Tom's.
p199
aVAs it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet
p200
aVis a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo ...
p205
aVShould Vander play football?
p206
aVI can't say no,
p207
aVbut I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house,
p208
aVthat kid's wearing a helmet \u2014
p209
aVlike, to the car,
p210
aVor at school.
p211
aVSo whether athlete, scholar,
p212
aVoverprotected kid, neurotic mom,
p213
aVor otherwise,
p214
aVhere's my baby, Vander,
p215
aVreminding you
p216
aVto mind your matter.
p217
aa(lp218
VThank you.

VYou know, I am so bad at tech
p5
aVthat my daughter \u2014 who is now 41 \u2014
p6
aVwhen she was five, was overheard by me
p7
aVto say to a friend of hers,
p8
aVIf it doesn't bleed when you cut it,
p9
aVmy daddy doesn't understand it.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVSo, the assignment I've been given
p12
aVmay be an insuperable obstacle for me,
p13
aVbut I'm certainly going to try.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhat have I heard
p16
aVduring these last four days?
p17
aVThis is my third visit to TED.
p18
aVOne was to TEDMED, and one, as you've heard,
p19
aVwas a regular TED two years ago.
p20
aVI've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing
p21
aVthat I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs,
p22
aVand what that is is an interweaving
p23
aVand an interlarding, an intermixing,
p24
aVof a sense of social responsibility
p25
aVin so many of the talks \u2014
p26
aVglobal responsibility, in fact,
p27
aVappealing to enlightened self-interest,
p28
aVbut it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest.
p29
aVOne of the most impressive things
p30
aVabout what some, perhaps 10,
p31
aVof the speakers have been talking about
p32
aVis the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying:
p33
aVWell, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.
p34
aVIt's: This is what I have done
p35
aVbecause I'm excited by it,
p36
aVbecause it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me
p37
aVand, of course, it's accomplished a great deal.
p38
aVIt's the old concept, the real Greek concept,
p39
aVof philanthropy in its original sense:
p40
aVphil-anthropy, the love of humankind.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd the only explanation I can have
p43
aVfor some of what you've been hearing in the last four days
p44
aVis that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love.
p45
aVAnd this gives me enormous hope.
p46
aVAnd hope, of course, is the topic
p47
aVthat I'm supposed to be speaking about,
p48
aVwhich I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived.
p49
aVAnd when I did, I thought,
p50
aVwell, I'd better look this word up in the dictionary.
p51
aVSo, Sarah and I \u2014 my wife \u2014 walked over to the public library,
p52
aVwhich is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED,
p53
aVand we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope,
p54
aVnone of which really hits you
p55
aVbetween the eyes as being the appropriate one.
p56
aVAnd, of course, that makes sense,
p57
aVbecause hope is an abstract phenomenon; it's an abstract idea,
p58
aVit's not a concrete word.
p59
aa(lp60
VWell, it reminds me a little bit of surgery.
p61
aVIf there's one operation for a disease, you know it works.
p62
aVIf there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work.
p63
aVAnd that's the way it is with definitions of words.
p64
aVIf you have appendicitis, they take your appendix out, and you're cured.
p65
aVIf you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures,
p66
aVand Joe Schmo does it one way
p67
aVand Will Blow does it another way,
p68
aVand none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.
p69
aVThey all come down to the idea of an expectation
p70
aVof something good that is due to happen.
p71
aVAnd you know what I found out?
p72
aVThe Indo-European root of the word hope
p73
aVis a stem, K-E-U \u2014
p74
aVwe would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy \u2014
p75
aVand it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.
p76
aVBut what it means in the original Indo-European
p77
aVis a change in direction, going in a different way.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd I find that very interesting and very provocative,
p80
aVbecause what you've been hearing in the last couple of days
p81
aVis the sense of going in different directions:
p82
aVdirections that are specific and unique to problems.
p83
aVThere are different paradigms.
p84
aVYou've heard that word several times in the last four days,
p85
aVand everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.
p86
aVSo, when we think of hope now,
p87
aVwe have to think of looking in other directions
p88
aVthan we have been looking.
p89
aVThere's another \u2014 not definition, but description, of hope
p90
aVthat has always appealed to me, and it was one by Václav Havel
p91
aVin his perfectly spectacular book "Breaking the Peace,"
p92
aVin which he says that hope
p93
aVdoes not consist of the expectation that things will
p94
aVcome out exactly right,
p95
aVbut the expectation that they will make sense
p96
aVregardless of how they come out.
p97
aa(lp98
VI can't tell you how reassured I was
p99
aVby the very last sentence
p100
aVin that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago.
p101
aVI wasn't sure I heard it right,
p102
aVso I found him in one of the inter-sessions.
p103
aVHe was talking to a very large man, but I didn't care.
p104
aVI interrupted, and I said, "Did you say this?"
p105
aVHe said, "I think so."
p106
aVSo, here's what it is: I'll repeat it.
p107
aV"The world will not be saved by the Internet."
p108
aVIt's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?
p109
aVI'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit.
p110
aVAnd by the human spirit, I don't mean anything divine,
p111
aVI don't mean anything supernatural \u2014
p112
aVcertainly not coming from this skeptic.
p113
aVWhat I mean is this ability
p114
aVthat each of us has
p115
aVto be something greater than herself or himself;
p116
aVto arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something
p117
aVthat at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of.
p118
aVOn an elemental level, we have all felt
p119
aVthat spirituality at the time of childbirth.
p120
aVSome of you have felt it in laboratories;
p121
aVsome of you have felt it at the workbench.
p122
aVWe feel it at concerts.
p123
aVI've felt it in the operating room, at the bedside.
p124
aVIt is an elevation of us beyond ourselves.
p125
aVAnd I think that it's going to be, in time,
p126
aVthe elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about
p127
aVbit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.
p128
aVAnd if there's anything that has permeated this room,
p129
aVit is precisely that.
p130
aa(lp131
VI'm intrigued by
p132
aVa concept that was brought to life
p133
aVin the early part of the 19th century \u2014
p134
aVactually, in the second decade of the 19th century \u2014
p135
aVby a 27-year-old poet
p136
aVwhose name was Percy Shelley.
p137
aVNow, we all think that Shelley
p138
aVobviously is the great romantic poet that he was;
p139
aVmany of us tend to forget that he wrote
p140
aVsome perfectly wonderful essays, too,
p141
aVand the most well-remembered essay
p142
aVis one called "A Defence of Poetry."
p143
aVNow, it's about five, six, seven, eight pages long,
p144
aVand it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page,
p145
aVbut somewhere on the second page
p146
aVhe begins talking about the notion
p147
aVthat he calls "moral imagination."
p148
aVAnd here's what he says, roughly translated:
p149
aVA man \u2014 generic man \u2014
p150
aVa man, to be greatly good,
p151
aVmust imagine clearly.
p152
aVHe must see himself and the world
p153
aVthrough the eyes of another,
p154
aVand of many others.
p155
aVSee himself and the world \u2014 not just the world, but see himself.
p156
aa(lp157
VWhat is it that is expected of us
p158
aVby the billions of people
p159
aVwho live in what Laurie Garrett the other day
p160
aVso appropriately called
p161
aVdespair and disparity?
p162
aVWhat is it that they have every right
p163
aVto ask of us?
p164
aVWhat is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves,
p165
aVout of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit?
p166
aVWell, you know precisely what it is.
p167
aVThere's a great deal of argument
p168
aVabout whether we, as the great nation that we are,
p169
aVshould be the policeman of the world,
p170
aVthe world's constabulary,
p171
aVbut there should be virtually no argument
p172
aVabout whether we should be the world's healer.
p173
aVThere has certainly been no argument about that
p174
aVin this room in the past four days.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo, if we are to be the world's healer,
p177
aVevery disadvantaged person in this world \u2014
p178
aVincluding in the United States \u2014 becomes our patient.
p179
aVEvery disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation,
p180
aVbecomes our patient.
p181
aVSo, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word "patient."
p182
aVIt comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.
p183
aVSo, you go back to the old Indo-European root again,
p184
aVand what do you find? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen \u2014
p185
aVwe would spell it P-A-E-N \u2014 and, lo and behold, mirabile dictu,
p186
aVit is the same root as the word compassion comes from, P-A-E-N.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient \u2014
p189
aVthe world, and the disadvantaged of the world \u2014
p190
aVthat patient deserves our compassion.
p191
aVBut beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion,
p192
aVis our moral imagination
p193
aVand our identification with each individual
p194
aVwho lives in that world,
p195
aVnot to think of them as a huge forest,
p196
aVbut as individual trees.
p197
aVOf course, in this day and age, the trick is not to let each tree
p198
aVbe obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get \u2014
p199
aVcan get in the way.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVSo, here we are.
p202
aVWe are, should be,
p203
aVmorally committed to
p204
aVbeing the healer of the world.
p205
aVAnd we have had examples over and over and over again \u2014
p206
aVyou've just heard one in the last 15 minutes \u2014
p207
aVof people who have not only had that commitment,
p208
aVbut had the charisma, the brilliance \u2014
p209
aVand I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant, my God \u2014
p210
aVthe brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning
p211
aVof their quest,
p212
aVand who no doubt will continue to succeed,
p213
aVas long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, if we're talking
p216
aVabout medicine,
p217
aVand we're talking about healing,
p218
aVI'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted.
p219
aVIt seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here:
p220
aVPogo's been quoted;
p221
aVShakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out.
p222
aVI would like to quote one of my own household gods.
p223
aVI suspect he never really said this,
p224
aVbecause we don't know what Hippocrates really said,
p225
aVbut we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians
p226
aVsaid the following,
p227
aVand it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates,
p228
aVand the book is called "Precepts."
p229
aVAnd I'll read you what it is.
p230
aVRemember, I have been talking about,
p231
aVessentially philanthropy:
p232
aVthe love of humankind, the individual humankind
p233
aVand the individual humankind
p234
aVthat can bring that kind of love
p235
aVtranslated into action,
p236
aVtranslated, in some cases, into enlightened self-interest.
p237
aVAnd here he is, 2,400 years ago:
p238
aV"Where there is love of humankind,
p239
aVthere is love of healing."
p240
aVWe have seen that here today
p241
aVwith the sense,
p242
aVwith the sensitivity \u2014
p243
aVand in the last three days,
p244
aVand with the power of the indomitable human spirit.
p245
aVThank you very much.
p246

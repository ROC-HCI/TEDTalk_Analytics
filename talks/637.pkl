VWe see with the eyes,
p5
aVbut we see with the brain as well.
p6
aVAnd seeing with the brain is often called imagination.
p7
aVAnd we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination,
p8
aVour inscapes.  We've lived with them all our lives.
p9
aVBut there are also hallucinations as well,
p10
aVand hallucinations  are completely different.
p11
aVThey don't seem to be of our creation.
p12
aVThey don't seem to be under our control.
p13
aVThey seem to come from the outside,
p14
aVand to mimic perception.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo I am going to be talking about hallucinations,
p17
aVand a particular sort of visual hallucination
p18
aVwhich I see among my patients.
p19
aVA few months ago, I got a phone call
p20
aVfrom a nursing home where I work.
p21
aVThey told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s,
p22
aVwas seeing things,
p23
aVand they wondered if she'd gone bonkers
p24
aVor, because she was an old lady,
p25
aVwhether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie,
p28
aVthe old lady.
p29
aVI went in to see her.
p30
aVIt was evident straight away
p31
aVthat she was perfectly sane
p32
aVand lucid and  of good intelligence,
p33
aVbut she'd been very startled and very bewildered,
p34
aVbecause she'd been seeing things.
p35
aVAnd she told me \u2014
p36
aVthe nurses hadn't mentioned this \u2014
p37
aVthat she was blind,
p38
aVthat she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years.
p39
aVBut now, for the last few days, she'd been seeing things.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo I said, "What sort of things?"
p42
aVAnd she said, "People in Eastern dress,
p43
aVin drapes, walking up and down stairs.
p44
aVA man who turns towards me and smiles.
p45
aVBut he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.
p46
aVAnimals too.
p47
aVI see a white building. It's snowing, a soft snow.
p48
aVI see this horse with a harness, dragging the snow away.
p49
aVThen, one night, the scene changes.
p50
aVI see cats and dogs walking towards me.
p51
aVThey come to a certain point and then stop.
p52
aVThen it changes again.
p53
aVI see a lot of children. They are walking up and down stairs.
p54
aVThey wear bright colors, rose and blue,
p55
aVlike Eastern dress."
p56
aa(lp57
VSometimes, she said, before the people come on,
p58
aVshe may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor,
p59
aVwhich seem to go up to the ceiling.
p60
aVI said, "Is this like a dream?"
p61
aVAnd she said, "No, it's not like a dream. It's like a movie."
p62
aVShe said, "It's got color. It's got motion.
p63
aVBut it's completely silent, like a silent movie."
p64
aVAnd she said that it's a rather boring movie.
p65
aVShe said, "All these people with Eastern dress,
p66
aVwalking up and down, very repetitive, very limited."
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd she has a sense of humor.
p70
aVShe knew it was a hallucination.
p71
aVBut she was frightened. She'd lived 95 years
p72
aVand she'd never had a hallucination before.
p73
aVShe said that the hallucinations were unrelated
p74
aVto anything she was thinking or feeling or doing,
p75
aVthat they seemed to come on by themselves, or disappear.
p76
aVShe had no control over them.
p77
aVShe said she didn't recognize
p78
aVany of the people or places
p79
aVin the hallucinations.
p80
aVAnd none of the people or the animals,
p81
aVwell, they all seemed oblivious of her.
p82
aVAnd she didn't know what was going on.
p83
aVShe wondered if she was going mad
p84
aVor losing her mind.
p85
aa(lp86
VWell, I examined her carefully.
p87
aVShe was a bright old lady,
p88
aVperfectly sane. She had no medical problems.
p89
aVShe wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations.
p90
aVBut she was blind.
p91
aVAnd I then said to her,
p92
aV"I think I know what you have."
p93
aVI said, "There is a special form of visual hallucination
p94
aVwhich may go with deteriorating vision or blindness.
p95
aVThis was originally described," I said,
p96
aV"right back in the 18th century,
p97
aVby a man called Charles Bonnet.
p98
aVAnd you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.
p99
aVThere is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind.
p100
aVYou have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd she was very relieved at this,
p103
aVthat there was nothing seriously the matter,
p104
aVand also rather curious.
p105
aVShe said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"
p106
aVShe said, "Did he have them himself?"
p107
aVAnd she said, "Tell all the nurses
p108
aVthat I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aV"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
p111
aVWell, so I did tell the nurses.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow this, for me, is a common situation.
p114
aVI work in old-age homes, largely.
p115
aVI see a lot of elderly people
p116
aVwho are hearing impaired or visually impaired.
p117
aVAbout 10 percent of the hearing impaired people
p118
aVget musical hallucinations.
p119
aVAnd about 10 percent of the visually impaired people
p120
aVget visual hallucinations.
p121
aVYou don't have to be completely blind,
p122
aVonly sufficiently impaired.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow with the original description in the 18th century,
p125
aVCharles Bonnet did not have them.
p126
aVHis grandfather had these hallucinations.
p127
aVHis grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man.
p128
aVHe'd had cataract surgery.
p129
aVHis vision was pretty poor.
p130
aVAnd in 1759, he described to his grandson
p131
aVvarious things he was seeing.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe first thing he said was he saw
p134
aVa handkerchief in midair.
p135
aVIt was a large blue handkerchief
p136
aVwith four orange circles.
p137
aVAnd he knew it was a hallucination.
p138
aVYou don't have handkerchiefs in midair.
p139
aVAnd then he saw a big wheel in midair.
p140
aVBut sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not,
p141
aVbecause the hallucinations would fit
p142
aVin the context of the visions.
p143
aVSo on one occasion, when his granddaughters were visiting them,
p144
aVhe said, "And who are these handsome young men with you?"
p145
aVAnd they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men."
p146
aVAnd then the handsome young men disappeared.
p147
aVIt's typical of these hallucinations
p148
aVthat they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.
p149
aVThey don't usually fade in and out.
p150
aVThey are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.
p151
aa(lp152
VCharles Lullin, the grandfather,
p153
aVsaw hundreds of different figures,
p154
aVdifferent landscapes of all sorts.
p155
aVOn one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe,
p156
aVand realized it was himself.
p157
aVThat was the only figure he recognized.
p158
aVOn one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris,
p159
aVhe saw \u2014 this was real \u2014 a scaffolding.
p160
aVBut when he got back home, he saw a miniature of the scaffolding
p161
aVsix inches high, on his study table.
p162
aVThis repetition of perception
p163
aVis sometimes called palinopsia.
p164
aa(lp165
VWith him and with Rosalie,
p166
aVwhat seems to be going on \u2014
p167
aVand Rosalie said, "What's going on?" \u2014
p168
aVand I said that as you lose vision,
p169
aVas the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input,
p170
aVthey become hyperactive and excitable,
p171
aVand they start to fire spontaneously.
p172
aVAnd you start to see things.
p173
aVThe things you see can be very complicated indeed.
p174
aa(lp175
VWith another patient of mine,
p176
aVwho, also had some vision,
p177
aVthe vision she had could be disturbing.
p178
aVOn one occasion, she said she saw
p179
aVa man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.
p180
aVAnd he turned around. And then
p181
aVhe divided into six figures in striped shirts,
p182
aVwho started walking towards her.
p183
aVAnd then the six figures came together again, like a concertina.
p184
aVOnce, when she was driving,
p185
aVor rather, her husband was driving,
p186
aVthe road divided into four
p187
aVand she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.
p188
aa(lp189
VShe had very mobile hallucinations as well.
p190
aVA lot of them had to do with a car.
p191
aVSometimes she would see a teenage boy
p192
aVsitting on the hood of the car.
p193
aVHe was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully
p194
aVwhen the car turned.
p195
aVAnd then when they came to a stop,
p196
aVthe boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff, 100 foot in the air,
p197
aVand then disappear.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnother patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination.
p200
aVThis was a woman who didn't have trouble with her eyes,
p201
aVbut the visual parts of her brain,
p202
aVa little tumor in the occipital cortex.
p203
aVAnd, above all, she would see cartoons.
p204
aVThese cartoons would be transparent
p205
aVand would cover half the visual field, like a screen.
p206
aVAnd especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aVNow, I don't watch Sesame Street,
p209
aVbut she made a point of saying,
p210
aV"Why Kermit?" she said, "Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.
p211
aVYou know, I was wondering about Freudian determinants.
p212
aVWhy Kermit?
p213
aVKermit the Frog means nothing to me."
p214
aa(lp215
VShe didn't mind the cartoons too much.
p216
aVBut what did disturb her was she got very persistent
p217
aVimages or hallucinations of faces
p218
aVand as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed,
p219
aVwith very large teeth or very large eyes.
p220
aVAnd these frightened her.
p221
aVWell, what is going on with these people?
p222
aVAs a physician, I have to try and define what's going on,
p223
aVand to reassure people,
p224
aVespecially to reassure them that they're not going insane.
p225
aa(lp226
VSomething like 10 percent, as I said,
p227
aVof visually impaired people get these.
p228
aVBut no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them,
p229
aVbecause they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something.
p230
aVAnd if they do mention them to their own doctors
p231
aVthey may be misdiagnosed.
p232
aa(lp233
VIn particular, the notion is that if you see
p234
aVthings or hear things, you're going mad,
p235
aVbut the psychotic hallucinations  are quite different.
p236
aVPsychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal,
p237
aVthey address you. They accuse you.
p238
aVThey seduce you. They humiliate you.
p239
aVThey jeer at you.
p240
aVYou interact with them.
p241
aVThere is none of this quality of being addressed
p242
aVwith these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.
p243
aVThere is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you,
p244
aVor that's how people think about it.
p245
aa(lp246
VThere is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy,
p247
aVand sometimes, if one has this,
p248
aVone may feel oneself transported back
p249
aVto a time and place in the past.
p250
aVYou're at a particular road junction.
p251
aVYou smell chestnuts roasting.
p252
aVYou hear the traffic. All the senses are involved.
p253
aVAnd you're waiting for your girl.
p254
aVAnd it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.
p255
aVAnd the temporal lobe hallucinations
p256
aVare all-sense hallucinations,
p257
aVfull of feeling, full of familiarity,
p258
aVlocated in space and time,
p259
aVcoherent, dramatic.
p260
aVThe Charles Bonnet ones are quite different.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations,
p263
aVyou have all sorts of levels,
p264
aVfrom the geometrical hallucinations \u2014
p265
aVthe pink and blue squares the woman had \u2014
p266
aVup to quite elaborate hallucinations
p267
aVwith figures and especially faces.
p268
aVFaces, and sometimes deformed faces,
p269
aVare the single commonest thing
p270
aVin these hallucinations.
p271
aVAnd one of the second commonest is cartoons.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo, what is going on?
p274
aVFascinatingly, in the last few years,
p275
aVit's been possible to do functional brain imagery,
p276
aVto do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating.
p277
aVAnd in fact, to find that different parts
p278
aVof the visual brain are activated
p279
aVas they are hallucinating.
p280
aVWhen people have these simple geometrical hallucinations,
p281
aVthe primary visual cortex is activated.
p282
aVThis is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns.
p283
aVYou don't form images with your primary visual cortex.
p284
aa(lp285
VWhen images are formed,
p286
aVa higher part of the visual cortex
p287
aVis involved in the temporal lobe.
p288
aVAnd in particular, one area of the temporal lobe
p289
aVis called the fusiform gyrus.
p290
aVAnd it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus,
p291
aVthey maybe lose the ability to recognize faces.
p292
aVBut if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus,
p293
aVthey may hallucinate faces,
p294
aVand this is exactly what you find in some of these people.
p295
aVThere is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus
p296
aVwhere teeth and eyes are represented,
p297
aVand that part of the gyrus is activated
p298
aVwhen people get the deformed hallucinations.
p299
aa(lp300
VThere is another part of the brain
p301
aVwhich is especially activated
p302
aVwhen one sees cartoons.
p303
aVIt's activated when one recognizes cartoons,
p304
aVwhen one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them.
p305
aVIt's very interesting that that should be specific.
p306
aVThere are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved
p307
aVwith the recognition and hallucination
p308
aVof buildings and landscapes.
p309
aa(lp310
VAround 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain,
p311
aVbut particular cells.
p312
aV"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.
p313
aVAnd now we know that there are hundreds of other
p314
aVsorts of cells,
p315
aVwhich can be very, very specific.
p316
aVSo you may not only have
p317
aV"car" cells,
p318
aVyou may have "Aston Martin" cells.
p319
aV(Laughter)
p320
aVI saw an Aston Martin this morning.
p321
aVI had to bring it in.
p322
aVAnd now it's in there somewhere.
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VNow, at this level, in what's called the inferotemporal cortex,
p326
aVthere are only visual images,
p327
aVor figments or fragments.
p328
aVIt's only at higher levels
p329
aVthat the other senses join in
p330
aVand there are connections with memory and emotion.
p331
aVAnd in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,
p332
aVyou don't go to those higher levels.
p333
aVYou're in these levels of inferior visual cortex
p334
aVwhere you have thousands and tens of thousands
p335
aVand millions of images,
p336
aVor figments, or fragmentary figments,
p337
aVall neurally encoded
p338
aVin particular cells or small clusters of cells.
p339
aa(lp340
VNormally these are all part of
p341
aVthe integrated stream of perception, or imagination,
p342
aVand one is not conscious of them.
p343
aVIt is only if one is visually impaired or blind
p344
aVthat the process is interrupted.
p345
aVAnd instead of getting normal perception,
p346
aVyou're getting an anarchic,
p347
aVconvulsive stimulation, or release,
p348
aVof all of these visual cells
p349
aVin the inferotemporal cortex.
p350
aVSo, suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car.
p351
aVSuddenly this, and suddenly that.
p352
aVThe mind does its best to organize
p353
aVand to give some sort of coherence to this,
p354
aVbut not terribly successfully.
p355
aa(lp356
VWhen these were first described,
p357
aVit was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams.
p358
aVBut in fact people say,
p359
aV"I don't recognize the people. I can't form any associations."
p360
aV"Kermit means nothing to me."
p361
aVYou don't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams.
p362
aa(lp363
VWell, I've more or less said what I wanted.
p364
aVI think I just want to recapitulate
p365
aVand say this is common.
p366
aVThink of the number of blind people.
p367
aVThere must be hundreds of thousands of blind people
p368
aVwho have these hallucinations,
p369
aVbut are too scared to mention them.
p370
aVSo this sort of thing needs to be brought into
p371
aVnotice, for patients, for doctors, for the public.
p372
aVFinally, I think they are
p373
aVinfinitely interesting and valuable,
p374
aVfor giving one some insight as to how the brain works.
p375
aa(lp376
VCharles Bonnet said, 250 years ago \u2014
p377
aVhe wondered how, thinking these hallucinations,
p378
aVhow, as he put it, the theater of the mind
p379
aVcould be generated by the machinery of the brain.
p380
aVNow, 250 years later,
p381
aVI think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done.
p382
aVThanks very much.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VChris Anderson: That was superb. Thank you so much.
p387
aVYou speak about these things with so much insight
p388
aVand empathy for your patients.
p389
aVHave you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about?
p390
aa(lp391
VOliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.
p392
aV(Laughter)
p393
aVWell, yeah, a lot of them.
p394
aVAnd actually I'm a little visually impaired myself.
p395
aVI'm blind in one eye, and not terribly good in the other.
p396
aVAnd I see the geometrical hallucinations.
p397
aVBut they stop there.
p398
aa(lp399
VCA: And they don't disturb you?
p400
aVBecause you understand what's doing it, it doesn't make you worried?
p401
aa(lp402
VOS: Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus,
p403
aVwhich I ignore.
p404
aVThey occasionally interest me,
p405
aVand I have many pictures of them in my notebooks.
p406
aVI've gone and had an fMRI myself,
p407
aVto see how my visual cortex is taking over.
p408
aVAnd when I see all these hexagons
p409
aVand complex things, which I also have,
p410
aVin visual migraine,
p411
aVI wonder whether everyone sees things like this,
p412
aVand whether things like cave art or ornamental art
p413
aVmay have been derived from them a bit.
p414
aa(lp415
VCA: That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk.
p416
aVThank you so much for sharing.
p417
aa(lp418
VOS: Thank you. Thank you.

(lp4
VSo here it is. You can check: I am short, I'm French,
p5
aVI have a pretty strong French accent,
p6
aVso that's going to be clear in a moment.
p7
aa(lp8
VMaybe a sobering thought
p9
aVand something you all know about.
p10
aVAnd I suspect many of you gave
p11
aVsomething to the people of Haiti this year.
p12
aVAnd there is something else
p13
aVI believe in the back of your mind
p14
aVyou also know.
p15
aVThat is, every day,
p16
aV25,000 children die
p17
aVof entirely preventable causes.
p18
aVThat's a Haiti earthquake every eight days.
p19
aVAnd I suspect many of you probably gave something
p20
aVtowards that problem as well,
p21
aVbut somehow it doesn't happen
p22
aVwith the same intensity.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo why is that?
p25
aVWell, here is a thought experiment for you.
p26
aVImagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised \u2014
p27
aVmaybe you're a politician in a developing country
p28
aVand you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor:
p29
aVHow do you go about it?
p30
aVDo you believe the people who tell you
p31
aVthat all we need to do is to spend money?
p32
aVThat we know how to eradicate poverty,
p33
aVwe just need to do more?
p34
aVOr do you believe the people who tell you that
p35
aVaid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt,
p36
aVit might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?
p37
aVOr maybe you turn to the past.
p38
aVAfter all, we have spent billions of dollars on aid.
p39
aVMaybe you look at the past and see.
p40
aVHas it done any good?
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd, sadly, we don't know.
p43
aVAnd worst of all, we will never know.
p44
aVAnd the reason is that \u2014 take Africa for example.
p45
aVAfricans have already got a lot of aid.
p46
aVThese are the blue bars.
p47
aVAnd the GDP in Africa is not making much progress.
p48
aVOkay, fine. How do you know what
p49
aVwould have happened without the aid?
p50
aVMaybe it would have been much worse,
p51
aVor maybe it would have been better.
p52
aVWe have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is.
p53
aVThere's only one Africa.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo what do you do?
p56
aVTo give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?
p57
aVOr do you focus on your everyday life
p58
aVand let the earthquake every eight days
p59
aVcontinue to happen?
p60
aVThe thing is, if we don't know
p61
aVwhether we are doing any good,
p62
aVwe are not any better
p63
aVthan the Medieval doctors and their leeches.
p64
aVSometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies.
p65
aVIs it the leeches? Is it something else?
p66
aVWe don't know.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo here are some other questions.
p69
aVThey're smaller questions,
p70
aVbut they are not that small.
p71
aVImmunization, that's the cheapest way
p72
aVto save a child's life.
p73
aVAnd the world has spent a lot of money on it:
p74
aVThe GAVI and the Gates Foundations
p75
aVare each pledging a lot of money towards it,
p76
aVand developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.
p77
aVAnd yet, every year
p78
aVat least 25 million children
p79
aVdo not get the immunization they should get.
p80
aVSo this is what you call a "last mile problem."
p81
aVThe technology is there,
p82
aVthe infrastructure is there,
p83
aVand yet it doesn't happen.
p84
aVSo you have your million.
p85
aVHow do you use your million
p86
aVto solve this last mile problem?
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd here's another question:
p89
aVMalaria. Malaria kills almost
p90
aV900,000 people every year,
p91
aVmost of them in Sub-Saharan Africa,
p92
aVmost of them under five.
p93
aVIn fact, that is the leading cause of under-five mortality.
p94
aVWe already know how to kill malaria,
p95
aVbut some people come to you and say,
p96
aV"You have your millions. How about bed nets?"
p97
aVBed nets are very cheap.
p98
aVFor 10 dollars, you can manufacture and ship
p99
aVan insecticide treated bed net
p100
aVand you can teach someone to use them.
p101
aVAnd, not only do they protect the people who sleep under them,
p102
aVbut they have these great contagion benefits.
p103
aVIf half of a community sleeps under a net,
p104
aVthe other half also benefits
p105
aVbecause the contagion of the disease spread.
p106
aVAnd yet, only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net.
p107
aVSocieties should be willing to go out
p108
aVand subsidize the net, give them for free,
p109
aVor, for that matter, pay people to use them
p110
aVbecause of those contagion benefits.
p111
aV"Not so fast," say other people.
p112
aV"If you give the nets for free,
p113
aVpeople are not going to value them.
p114
aVThey're not going to use them,
p115
aVor at least they're not going to use them as bed nets,
p116
aVmaybe as fishing nets."
p117
aVSo, what do you do?
p118
aVDo you give the nets for free to maximize coverage,
p119
aVor do you make people pay
p120
aVin order to make sure that they really value them?
p121
aVHow do you know?
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd a third question: Education.
p124
aVMaybe that's the solution, maybe we should send kids to school.
p125
aVBut how do you do that?
p126
aVDo you hire teachers? Do you build more schools?
p127
aVDo you provide school lunch?
p128
aVHow do you know?
p129
aa(lp130
VSo here is the thing.
p131
aVI cannot answer the big question,
p132
aVwhether aid did any good or not.
p133
aVBut these three questions, I can answer them.
p134
aVIt's not the Middle Ages anymore,
p135
aVit's the 21st century.
p136
aVAnd in the 20th century,
p137
aVrandomized, controlled trials
p138
aVhave revolutionized medicine
p139
aVby allowing us to distinguish
p140
aVbetween drugs that work
p141
aVand drugs that don't work.
p142
aVAnd you can do the same
p143
aVrandomized, controlled trial for social policy.
p144
aVYou can put social innovation to the same
p145
aVrigorous, scientific tests
p146
aVthat we use for drugs.
p147
aVAnd in this way, you can take the guesswork
p148
aVout of policy-making
p149
aVby knowing what works,
p150
aVwhat doesn't work and why.
p151
aVAnd I'll give you some examples with those three questions.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo I start with immunization.
p154
aVHere's Udaipur District, Rajasthan. Beautiful.
p155
aVWell, when I started working there,
p156
aVabout one percent of children
p157
aVwere fully immunized.
p158
aVThat's bad, but there are places like that.
p159
aVNow, it's not because the vaccines are not there \u2014
p160
aVthey are there and they are free \u2014
p161
aVand it's not because parents do not care about their kids.
p162
aVThe same child that is not immunized against measles,
p163
aVif they do get measles, parents will spend
p164
aVthousands of rupees to help them.
p165
aVSo you get these empty village subcenters
p166
aVand crowded hospitals.
p167
aVSo what is the problem?
p168
aVWell, part of the problem, surely, is people do not fully understand.
p169
aVAfter all, in this country as well,
p170
aVall sorts of myths and misconceptions
p171
aVgo around immunization.
p172
aVSo if that's the case, that's difficult,
p173
aVbecause persuasion is really difficult.
p174
aVBut maybe there is another problem as well.
p175
aVIt's going from intention to action.
p176
aVImagine you are a mother
p177
aVin Udaipur District, Rajasthan.
p178
aVYou have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized.
p179
aVAnd maybe when you get there, what you find is this:
p180
aVThe subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back,
p181
aVand you are so busy and you have so many other things to do,
p182
aVyou will always tend to postpone and postpone,
p183
aVand eventually it gets too late.
p184
aVWell, if that's the problem, then that's much easier.
p185
aVBecause A, we can make it easy,
p186
aVand B, we can maybe
p187
aVgive people a reason to act today,
p188
aVrather than wait till tomorrow.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo these are simple ideas, but we didn't know.
p191
aVSo let's try them.
p192
aVSo what we did is we did a randomized, controlled trial
p193
aVin 134 villages in Udaipur Districts.
p194
aVSo the blue dots
p195
aVare selected randomly.
p196
aVWe made it easy \u2014 I'll tell you how in a moment.
p197
aVIn the red dots, we made it easy
p198
aVand gave people a reason to act now.
p199
aVThe white dots are comparisons, nothing changed.
p200
aVSo we make it easy by organizing
p201
aVthis monthly camp where people can
p202
aVget their kids immunized.
p203
aVAnd then you make it easy
p204
aVand give a reason to act now
p205
aVby adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization.
p206
aVNow, a kilo of lentils is tiny.
p207
aVIt's never going to convince anybody
p208
aVto do something that they don't want to do.
p209
aVOn the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone,
p210
aVthen it might give you a reason to act today
p211
aVrather than later.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo what do we find?
p214
aVWell, beforehand, everything is the same.
p215
aVThat's the beauty of randomization.
p216
aVAfterwards,
p217
aVthe camp \u2014 just having the camp \u2014
p218
aVincreases immunization from six percent to 17 percent.
p219
aVThat's full immunization.
p220
aVThat's not bad, that's a good improvement.
p221
aVAdd the lentils and you reach to 38 percent.
p222
aVSo here you've got your answer.
p223
aVMake it easy and give a kilo of lentils,
p224
aVyou multiply immunization rate by six.
p225
aVNow, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable.
p226
aVWe cannot keep giving lentils to people."
p227
aVWell, it turns out it's wrong economics,
p228
aVbecause it is cheaper
p229
aVto give lentils than not to give them.
p230
aVSince you have to pay for the nurse anyway,
p231
aVthe cost per immunization
p232
aVends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't.
p233
aa(lp234
VHow about bed nets?
p235
aVShould you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them?
p236
aVSo the answer hinges
p237
aVon the answer to three simple questions.
p238
aVOne is: If people must pay for a bed net,
p239
aVare they going to purchase them?
p240
aVThe second one is:
p241
aVIf I give bed nets for free,
p242
aVare people going to use them?
p243
aVAnd the third one is:
p244
aVDo free bed nets discourage future purchase?
p245
aVThe third one is important
p246
aVbecause if we think people get used to handouts,
p247
aVit might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.
p248
aVNow this is a debate that has generated
p249
aVa lot of emotion and angry rhetoric.
p250
aVIt's more ideological than practical,
p251
aVbut it turns out it's an easy question.
p252
aVWe can know the answer to this question.
p253
aVWe can just run an experiment.
p254
aVAnd many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results,
p255
aVso I'm just going to talk to you about one.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd this one that was in Kenya,
p258
aVthey went around and distributed to people
p259
aVvouchers, discount vouchers.
p260
aVSo people with their voucher
p261
aVcould get the bed net in the local pharmacy.
p262
aVAnd some people get 100 percent discount,
p263
aVand some people get 20 percent discounts,
p264
aVand some people get 50 percent discount, etc.
p265
aVAnd now we can see what happens.
p266
aVSo, how about the purchasing?
p267
aVWell, what you can see is that
p268
aVwhen people have to pay for their bed nets,
p269
aVthe coverage rate really falls down a lot.
p270
aVSo even with partial subsidy,
p271
aVthree dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net,
p272
aVand now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets,
p273
aVyou lose the health immunity, that's not great.
p274
aVSecond thing is, how about the use?
p275
aVWell, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets,
p276
aVwill use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.
p277
aVIf they get it for free, they use it.
p278
aVIf they have to pay for it, they use it.
p279
aVHow about the long term?
p280
aVIn the long term,
p281
aVpeople who got the free bed nets,
p282
aVone year later, were offered the option
p283
aVto purchase a bed net at two dollars.
p284
aVAnd people who got the free one
p285
aVwere actually more likely to purchase the second one
p286
aVthan people who didn't get a free one.
p287
aVSo people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.
p288
aVMaybe we need to give them a little bit more credit.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo, that's for bed nets. So you will think, "That's great.
p291
aVYou know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets."
p292
aVBut what politicians need is a range of options.
p293
aVThey need to know: Out of all the things I could do,
p294
aVwhat is the best way to achieve my goals?
p295
aVSo suppose your goal is to get kids into school.
p296
aVThere are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms,
p297
aVyou could eliminate fees, you could build latrines,
p298
aVyou could give girls sanitary pads, etc., etc.
p299
aVSo what's the best?
p300
aVWell, at some level, we think
p301
aVall of these things should work.
p302
aVSo, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively,
p303
aVshould we go for them?
p304
aVWell, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it.
p305
aa(lp306
VConsider for example
p307
aVtransporting goods.
p308
aVBefore the canals were invented
p309
aVin Britain before the Industrial Revolution,
p310
aVgoods used to go on horse carts.
p311
aVAnd then canals were built,
p312
aVand with the same horseman and the same horse,
p313
aVyou could carry ten times as much cargo.
p314
aVSo should they have continued
p315
aVto carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground,
p316
aVthat they would eventually get there?
p317
aVWell, if that had been the case,
p318
aVthere would have been no Industrial Revolution.
p319
aVSo why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?
p320
aVIn technology, we spend so much time
p321
aVexperimenting, fine-tuning,
p322
aVgetting the absolute cheapest way to do something,
p323
aVso why aren't we doing that with social policy?
p324
aa(lp325
VWell, with experiments, what you can do
p326
aVis answer a simple question.
p327
aVSuppose you have 100 dollars to spend
p328
aVon various interventions.
p329
aVHow many extra years of education
p330
aVdo you get for your hundred dollars?
p331
aVNow I'm going to show you
p332
aVwhat we get with various education interventions.
p333
aVSo the first ones are if you want the usual suspects,
p334
aVhire teachers, school meals,
p335
aVschool uniforms, scholarships.
p336
aVAnd that's not bad. For your hundred dollars,
p337
aVyou get between one and three extra years of education.
p338
aVThings that don't work so well is bribing parents,
p339
aVjust because so many kids are already going to school
p340
aVthat you end up spending a lot of money.
p341
aVAnd here are the most surprising results.
p342
aVTell people the benefits of education,
p343
aVthat's very cheap to do.
p344
aVSo for every hundred dollars you spend doing that,
p345
aVyou get 40 extra years of education.
p346
aVAnd, in places where there are worms,
p347
aVintestinal worms,
p348
aVcure the kids of their worms.
p349
aVAnd for every hundred dollars,
p350
aVyou get almost 30 extra years of education.
p351
aVSo this is not your intuition,
p352
aVthis is not what people would have gone for,
p353
aVand yet, these are the programs that work.
p354
aVWe need that kind of information, we need more of it,
p355
aVand then we need to guide policy.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.
p358
aVAnd I cut it into smaller questions,
p359
aVand I have the answer to these smaller questions.
p360
aVAnd they are good, scientific, robust answers.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo let's go back to Haiti for a moment.
p363
aVIn Haiti, about 200,000 people died \u2014
p364
aVactually, a bit more by the latest estimate.
p365
aVAnd the response of the world was great:
p366
aVTwo billion dollars got pledged just last month,
p367
aVso that's about 10,000 dollars per death.
p368
aVThat doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.
p369
aVBut if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars
p370
aVfor every child under five who dies,
p371
aVthat would be 90 billion per year
p372
aVjust for that problem.
p373
aVAnd yet it doesn't happen.
p374
aVSo, why is that?
p375
aVWell, I think what part of the problem is that,
p376
aVin Haiti, although the problem is huge,
p377
aVsomehow we understand it, it's localized.
p378
aVYou give your money to Doctors Without Borders,
p379
aVyou give your money to Partners In Health,
p380
aVand they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber,
p381
aVand they'll helicopter things out and in.
p382
aVAnd the problem of poverty is not like that.
p383
aVSo, first, it's mostly invisible;
p384
aVsecond, it's huge;
p385
aVand third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing.
p386
aVThere's no silver bullet.
p387
aVYou cannot helicopter people out of poverty.
p388
aVAnd that's very frustrating.
p389
aa(lp390
VBut look what we just did today.
p391
aVI gave you three simple answers to three questions:
p392
aVGive lentils to immunize people,
p393
aVprovide free bed nets, deworm children.
p394
aVWith immunization or bed nets,
p395
aVyou can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved.
p396
aVWith deworming, you can get
p397
aVan extra year of education for three dollars.
p398
aVSo we cannot eradicate poverty just yet,
p399
aVbut we can get started.
p400
aVAnd maybe we can get started small
p401
aVwith things that we know are effective.
p402
aa(lp403
VHere's an example of how this can be powerful.
p404
aVDeworming.
p405
aVWorms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.
p406
aVThey are not beautiful and don't kill anybody.
p407
aVAnd yet, when the young global leader in Davos
p408
aVshowed the numbers I gave you,
p409
aVthey started Deworm the World.
p410
aVAnd thanks to Deworm the World,
p411
aVand the effort of many country governments and foundations,
p412
aV20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009.
p413
aVSo this evidence is powerful.
p414
aVIt can prompt action.
p415
aa(lp416
VSo we should get started now.
p417
aVIt's not going to be easy.
p418
aVIt's a very slow process.
p419
aVYou have to keep experimenting, and sometimes ideology
p420
aVhas to be trumped by practicality.
p421
aVAnd sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere.
p422
aVSo it's a slow process,
p423
aVbut there is no other way.
p424
aVThese economics I'm proposing,
p425
aVit's like 20th century medicine.
p426
aVIt's a slow, deliberative process
p427
aVof discovery.
p428
aVThere is no miracle cure,
p429
aVbut modern medicine is saving
p430
aVmillions of lives every year,
p431
aVand we can do the same thing.
p432
aa(lp433
VAnd now, maybe, we can go back to the bigger question
p434
aVthat I started with at the beginning.
p435
aVI cannot tell you
p436
aVwhether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference,
p437
aVbut can we come back here in 30 years
p438
aVand say, "What we have done,
p439
aVit really prompted a change for the better."
p440
aVI believe we can and I hope we will.
p441
aa(lp442
VThank you.

VThis was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo.
p5
aVWe stood on the railroad tracks
p6
aVthat ran between my friend's house and the beach.
p7
aVThe tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally,
p8
aVbut at that point the water had receded
p9
aVto a level three or four feet below normal.
p10
aVI'd never seen the reef here before.
p11
aVThere were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water.
p12
aVSome children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags.
p13
aVThey were trying to catch fish.
p14
aVNo one realized that this was a very bad idea.
p15
aVThe people on the tracks just continued to watch them.
p16
aVI turned around to check on my friend's house.
p17
aVThen someone on the tracks screamed.
p18
aVBefore I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.
p19
aa(lp20
VThe water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef.
p21
aVThe children managed to run back onto the tracks.
p22
aVNo one was lost there. But the water continued to climb.
p23
aVIn about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks
p24
aVand was coming over it. We had run about 100 meters by this time.
p25
aVIt continued to rise.
p26
aVI saw an old man standing at his gate, knee-deep in water, refusing to move.
p27
aVHe said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach,
p28
aVand that he would rather die there than run.
p29
aVA boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house
p30
aVto get his dog, who was apparently afraid.
p31
aVAn old lady, crying, was carried out of her house and up the road by her son.
p32
aVThe slum built on the railroad reservation
p33
aVbetween the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away.
p34
aVSince this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents,
p35
aVand no one was there when the water rose.
p36
aVBut they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings.
p37
aVFor hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around \u2014
p38
aVall of this was from the houses in the slum.
p39
aVWhen the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.
p40
aa(lp41
VThis may seem hard to believe \u2014
p42
aVunless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports \u2014
p43
aVbut in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified.
p44
aVWhen what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes
p45
aVand long-tail boats \u2014 mercilessly, without warning \u2014
p46
aVand no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming,
p47
aVI'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.
p48
aVOne of the scariest things about the tsunami
p49
aVthat I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information.
p50
aVThis may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor
p51
aVafter rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last,
p52
aVwill be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...
p53
aVYou don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water,
p54
aVto catch a boat to the hospital.
p55
aVWe think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.
p56
aVWe think this boat is going to Phuket hospital,
p57
aVbut if it's too dangerous to land at its pier,
p58
aVthen perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected.
p59
aVWe don't think another wave is coming right away.
p60
aa(lp61
VAt the Phi Phi Hill Resort,
p62
aVI was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television,
p63
aVbut I strained to listen for information.
p64
aVThey reported that there was an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra,
p65
aVwhich triggered the massive tsunami.
p66
aVHaving this news was comforting in some small way
p67
aVto understand what had just happened to us.
p68
aVHowever, the report focused on what had already occurred
p69
aVand offered no information on what to expect now.
p70
aVIn general, everything was merely hearsay and rumor,
p71
aVand not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hours
p72
aVknew anything with any certainty.
p73
aVThose were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs
p74
aVthat essentially sprang up after it occurred.
p75
aVI'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami
p76
aVthat also were shown on blogs.
p77
aVI should warn you, they're pretty powerful.
p78
aVOne from Thailand, and the second one from Phuket as well.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Screaming)
p81
aa(lp82
VVoice 1: It's coming in. It's coming again.
p83
aa(lp84
VVoice 2: It's coming again?
p85
aa(lp86
VVoice 1: Yeah. It's coming again.
p87
aa(lp88
VVoice 2: Come get inside here.
p89
aa(lp90
VVoice 1: It's coming again. Voice 2: New wave?
p91
aVVoice 1: It's coming again. New wave!
p92
aV[Unclear]
p93
aa(lp94
V(Screaming)
p95
aa(lp96
VThey called me out here.
p97
aa(lp98
VJames Surowiecki: Phew. Those were both on this site: waveofdestruction.org.
p99
aVIn the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami,
p100
aVbecause one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that,
p101
aValthough initially \u2014 that is, in that first day \u2014
p102
aVthere was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video
p103
aVand some people complained about this.
p104
aVThey said, "The blogsters let us down."
p105
aVWhat became very clear was that,
p106
aVwithin a few days, the outpouring of information was immense,
p107
aVand we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened
p108
aVin a way that we never had been able to get before.
p109
aVAnd what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected
p110
aVwriters, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with
p111
aVa collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense
p112
aVof what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment,
p115
aVa moment in which the blogosphere came, to a certain degree, of age.
p116
aVNow, I'm going to move now from this kind of \u2014
p117
aVthe sublime in the traditional sense of the word,
p118
aVthat is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying \u2014 to the somewhat more mundane.
p119
aVBecause when we think about blogs,
p120
aVI think for most of us who are concerned about them,
p121
aVwe're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc.
p122
aVAnd I want to ask three questions in this talk,
p123
aVin the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere.
p124
aVThe first one is, What does it tell us about our ideas,
p125
aVabout what motivates people to do things?
p126
aVThe second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibility
p127
aVof accessing a kind of collective intelligence
p128
aVthat has previously remained, for the most part, untapped?
p129
aVAnd then the third part is, What are the potential problems,
p130
aVor the dark side of blogs as we know them?
p131
aa(lp132
VOK, the first question:
p133
aVWhat do they tell us about why people do things?
p134
aVOne of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically,
p135
aVand, of course, the Internet more generally \u2014
p136
aVand it's going to seem like a very obvious point,
p137
aVbut I think it is an important one to think about \u2014
p138
aVis that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content
p139
aVevery day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing,
p140
aVlinking, commenting on the substance of the Internet,
p141
aVare doing so primarily for free.
p142
aVThey are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and,
p143
aVto some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job.
p144
aVAnd this is \u2014 at least, to a traditional economist \u2014 somewhat remarkable,
p145
aVbecause the traditional account of economic man would say that,
p146
aVbasically, you do things for a concrete reward, primarily financial.
p147
aVBut instead, what we're finding on the Internet \u2014
p148
aVand one of the great geniuses of it \u2014 is that people have found a way
p149
aVto work together without any money involved at all.
p150
aVThey have come up with, in a sense, a different method for organizing activity.
p151
aa(lp152
VThe Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler, in an essay called "Coase's Penguin,"
p153
aVtalks about this open-source model, which we're familiar with from Linux,
p154
aVas being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations.
p155
aVAnd, you know, if you think about this with the tsunami,
p156
aVwhat you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists,
p157
aVwho are producing enormous amounts of material
p158
aVfor no reason other than to tell their stories.
p159
aVThat's a very powerful idea, and it's a very powerful reality.
p160
aVAnd it's one that offers really interesting possibilities
p161
aVfor organizing a whole host of activities down the road.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo, I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us
p164
aVis that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational,
p165
aVand we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money,
p166
aVor, you have to pay for it to be good,
p167
aVbut that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products
p168
aVwithout any money at all changing hands.
p169
aVThere are a few bloggers \u2014 somewhere maybe around 20, now \u2014
p170
aVwho do, in fact, make some kind of money, and a few
p171
aVwho are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it,
p172
aVbut the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it
p173
aVor they love the attention, or whatever it is.
p174
aVSo, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this
p175
aVand, I think, is writing about this more,
p176
aVbut this notion of voluntary cooperation
p177
aVis an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.
p178
aa(lp179
VThe second question is, What does the blogosphere actually do for us,
p180
aVin terms of accessing collective intelligence?
p181
aVYou know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called "The Wisdom of Crowds."
p182
aVAnd the premise of "The Wisdom of Crowds" is that,
p183
aVunder the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent.
p184
aVAnd they can actually often be smarter
p185
aVthan even the smartest person within them.
p186
aVThe simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people
p187
aVto do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar.
p188
aVIf I had a jar of jellybeans
p189
aVand I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar,
p190
aVyour average guess would be remarkably good.
p191
aVIt would be somewhere probably within three and five percent
p192
aVof the number of beans in the jar,
p193
aVand it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.
p194
aVThere may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers,
p195
aVbut for the most part the group's guess
p196
aVwould be better than just about all of you.
p197
aVAnd what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work
p198
aVin many more complicated situations.
p199
aa(lp200
VFor instance, if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack,
p201
aVthey predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win.
p202
aVIn a sense, the group of betters at the racetrack
p203
aVis forecasting the future, in probabilistic terms.
p204
aVYou know, if you think about something like Google,
p205
aVwhich essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web
p206
aVto seek out those sites that have the most valuable information \u2014
p207
aVwe know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that,
p208
aVand it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing
p209
aVwe call the "World Wide Web" actually has a remarkable order,
p210
aVor a remarkable intelligence in it.
p211
aVAnd this, I think, is one of the real promises of the blogosphere.
p212
aa(lp213
VDan Gillmor \u2014 whose book "We the Media"
p214
aVis included in the gift pack \u2014
p215
aVhas talked about it as saying that, as a writer,
p216
aVhe's recognized that his readers know more than he does.
p217
aVAnd this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea
p218
aVto mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone
p219
aVwho has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise,
p220
aVand who has a lot of energy invested in the notion
p221
aVthat he or she knows better than everyone else.
p222
aVBut what the blogosphere offers is the possibility
p223
aVof getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there,
p224
aVand that we know is available to us
p225
aVif we can just figure out a way of accessing it.
p226
aVEach blog post, each blog commentary
p227
aVmay not, in and of itself, be exactly what we're looking for,
p228
aVbut collectively the judgment of those people posting, those people linking,
p229
aVmore often than not is going to give you a very interesting
p230
aVand enormously valuable picture of what's going on.
p231
aVSo, that's the positive side of it.
p232
aVThat's the positive side of what is sometimes called
p233
aVparticipatory journalism or citizen journalism, etc. \u2014
p234
aVthat, in fact, we are giving people
p235
aVwho have never been able to talk before a voice,
p236
aVand we're able to access information that has always been there
p237
aVbut has essentially gone untapped.
p238
aa(lp239
VBut there is a dark side to this,
p240
aVand that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.
p241
aVOne of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet,
p242
aVand you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet,
p243
aVis that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet.
p244
aVIt is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized,
p245
aVbottom-up structure of the Internet.
p246
aVIt is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things \u2014
p247
aVthat being linked from one place to another,
p248
aVthat being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing.
p249
aVAnd much of the time it is.
p250
aVBut there's also a downside to this \u2014 a kind of dark side, in fact \u2014
p251
aVand that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other,
p252
aVthe harder it is for each of us to remain independent.
p253
aa(lp254
VOne of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that,
p255
aVonce you are linked in the network,
p256
aVthe network starts to shape your views
p257
aVand starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.
p258
aVThat's one of the things that defines what a network is.
p259
aVA network is not just the product of its component parts.
p260
aVIt is something more than that.
p261
aVIt is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.
p262
aVNow, this has all these benefits:
p263
aVit's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information;
p264
aVit gives you access to a whole host of people;
p265
aVit allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways.
p266
aVBut the problem is that groups are only smart
p267
aVwhen the people in them are as independent as possible.
p268
aVThis is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds,
p269
aVor the paradox of collective intelligence,
p270
aVthat what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking.
p271
aVAnd networks make it harder for people to do that,
p272
aVbecause they drive attention to the things that the network values.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere
p275
aVis that once a meme, once an idea gets going,
p276
aVit is very easy for people to just sort of pile on,
p277
aVbecause other people have, say, a link.
p278
aVPeople have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.
p279
aVAnd that phenomenon
p280
aVof piling on the existing links
p281
aVis one that is characteristic of the blogosphere,
p282
aVparticularly of the political blogosphere,
p283
aVand it is one that essentially throws off
p284
aVthis beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligence
p285
aVthat blogs can manifest in the right conditions.
p286
aa(lp287
VThe metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill.
p288
aVA lot of people talk about ants.
p289
aVYou know, this is a conference inspired by nature.
p290
aVWhen we talk about bottom-up, decentralized phenomena,
p291
aVthe ant colony is the classic metaphor, because,
p292
aVno individual ant knows what it's doing,
p293
aVbut collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions.
p294
aVThey're able to reach food as efficiently as possible,
p295
aVthey're able to guide their traffic with remarkable speed.
p296
aVSo, the ant colony is a great model:
p297
aVyou have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing.
p298
aVBut we know that occasionally ants go astray,
p299
aVand what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost,
p300
aVthey start to follow a simple rule \u2014
p301
aVjust do what the ant in front of you does.
p302
aVAnd what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle.
p303
aVAnd there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long
p304
aVand lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and around
p305
aVin a circle until they died.
p306
aVAnd that, I think, is a sort of thing to watch out for.
p307
aVThat's the thing we have to fear \u2014
p308
aVis that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die.
p309
aa(lp310
VNow, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami,
p311
aVbecause one of the great things about the tsunami \u2014
p312
aVin terms of the blogosphere's coverage,
p313
aVnot in terms of the tsunami itself \u2014
p314
aVis that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.
p315
aVYou saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic.
p316
aVYou saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view
p317
aVin a way that they hadn't before.
p318
aVThere, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.
p319
aVSo, that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside.
p320
aVAnd I think that the former is what we really need to strive for.
p321
aa(lp322
VThank you very much. (Applause)

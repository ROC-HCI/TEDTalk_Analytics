VAh yes, those university days,
p5
aVa heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics
p6
aVand world debating championships,
p7
aVor, as I like to say, "Hello, ladies. Oh yeah."
p8
aVDidn't get much sexier than the Spence
p9
aVat university, let me tell you.
p10
aa(lp11
VIt is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer
p12
aVfrom Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage
p13
aVliterally on the other side of the world.
p14
aVAnd I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard
p15
aVabout Australians are true.
p16
aVFrom the youngest of ages, we display
p17
aVa prodigious sporting talent.
p18
aVOn the field of battle, we are brave and noble warriors.
p19
aVWhat you've heard is true.
p20
aVAustralians, we don't mind a bit of a drink,
p21
aVsometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations. (Laughter)
p22
aVThis is my father's work Christmas party, December 1973.
p23
aVI'm almost five years old. Fair to say,
p24
aVI'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut I stand before you today
p27
aVnot as a breakfast radio host,
p28
aVnot as a comedian, but as someone who was, is,
p29
aVand always will be a mathematician.
p30
aVAnd anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug
p31
aVknows that it bites early and it bites deep.
p32
aa(lp33
VI cast my mind back when I was in second grade
p34
aVat a beautiful little government-run school
p35
aVcalled Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney,
p36
aVand as we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher,
p37
aVMs. Russell, said to the class,
p38
aV"Hey, year two. What do you want to do after lunch?
p39
aVI've got no plans."
p40
aVIt was an exercise in democratic schooling,
p41
aVand I am all for democratic schooling, but we were only seven.
p42
aVSo some of the suggestions we made as to what
p43
aVwe might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical,
p44
aVand after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion
p45
aVand Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism,
p46
aV"That wouldn't work.
p47
aVThat'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole."
p48
aa(lp49
VNow I wasn't trying to be smart.
p50
aVI wasn't trying to be funny.
p51
aVI just politely raised my hand,
p52
aVand when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said,
p53
aVin front of my year two classmates, and I quote,
p54
aV"But Miss,
p55
aVsurely if the diagonal of the square
p56
aVis less than the diameter of the circle,
p57
aVwell, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole."
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aV"It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn't it?"
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd there was that same awkward silence
p62
aVfrom most of my classmates,
p63
aVuntil sitting next to me, one of my friends,
p64
aVone of the cool kids in class, Steven, leaned across
p65
aVand punched me really hard in the head.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVNow what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam,
p68
aVyou are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend.
p69
aVYou can keep sitting here with us.
p70
aVAny more of that sort of talk, you've got to go and sit
p71
aVover there with them."
p72
aa(lp73
VI thought about it for a nanosecond.
p74
aVI took one look at the road map of life,
p75
aVand I ran off down the street marked "Geek"
p76
aVas fast as my chubby, asthmatic little legs would carry me.
p77
aa(lp78
VI fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages.
p79
aVI explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful.
p80
aVIt's natural. It's everywhere.
p81
aVNumbers are the musical notes
p82
aVwith which the symphony of the universe is written.
p83
aVThe great Descartes said something quite similar.
p84
aVThe universe "is written in the mathematical language."
p85
aVAnd today, I want to show you one of those musical notes,
p86
aVa number so beautiful, so massive,
p87
aVI think it will blow your mind.
p88
aa(lp89
VToday we're going to talk about prime numbers.
p90
aVMost of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime
p91
aVbecause it's 2 x 3.
p92
aVSeven is prime because it's 1 x 7,
p93
aVbut we can't break it down into any smaller chunks,
p94
aVor as we call them, factors.
p95
aVNow a few things you might like to know about prime numbers.
p96
aVOne is not prime.
p97
aVThe proof of that is a great party trick
p98
aVthat admittedly only works at certain parties.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VAnother thing about primes, there is no final biggest prime number.
p103
aVThey keep going on forever.
p104
aVWe know there are an infinite number of primes
p105
aVdue to the brilliant mathematician Euclid.
p106
aVOver thousands of years ago, he proved that for us.
p107
aVBut the third thing about prime numbers,
p108
aVmathematicians have always wondered,
p109
aVwell at any given moment in time,
p110
aVwhat is the biggest prime that we know about?
p111
aa(lp112
VToday we're going to hunt for that massive prime.
p113
aVDon't freak out.
p114
aVAll you need to know, of all the mathematics
p115
aVyou've ever learned, unlearned, crammed, forgotten,
p116
aVnever understood in the first place,
p117
aVall you need to know is this:
p118
aVWhen I say 2 ^ 5,
p119
aVI'm talking about five little number twos next to each other
p120
aVall multiplied together,
p121
aV2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2.
p122
aVSo 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4,
p123
aV8, 16, 32.
p124
aVIf you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay?
p125
aVSo 2 ^ 5,
p126
aVthose five little twos multiplied together.
p127
aV(2 ^ 5) - 1 = 31.
p128
aV31 is a prime number, and that five in the power
p129
aVis also a prime number.
p130
aVAnd the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found
p131
aVare of that form:
p132
aVtwo to a prime number, take away one.
p133
aVI won't go into great detail as to why,
p134
aVbecause most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do,
p135
aVbut suffice to say, a number of that form
p136
aVis fairly easy to test for primacy.
p137
aVA random odd number is a lot harder to test.
p138
aVBut as soon as we go hunting for massive primes,
p139
aVwe realize it's not enough
p140
aVjust to put in any prime number in the power.
p141
aV(2 ^ 11) - 1 = 2,047,
p142
aVand you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVBut (2 ^ 13) - 1, (2 ^ 17) - 1
p145
aV(2 ^ 19) - 1, are all prime numbers.
p146
aVAfter that point, they thin out a lot.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd one of the things about the search for massive primes
p149
aVthat I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds
p150
aVof all time have gone on this search.
p151
aVThis is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.
p152
aVIn the 1700s, other mathematicians said
p153
aVhe is simply the master of us all.
p154
aVHe was so respected, they put him on European currency
p155
aVback when that was a compliment.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VEuler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime:
p160
aV(2 ^ 31) - 1.
p161
aVIt's over two billion.
p162
aVHe proved it was prime with nothing more
p163
aVthan a quill, ink, paper and his mind.
p164
aa(lp165
VYou think that's big.
p166
aVWe know that (2 ^ 127) - 1
p167
aVis a prime number.
p168
aVIt's an absolute brute.
p169
aVLook at it here: 39 digits long,
p170
aVproven to be prime in 1876
p171
aVby a mathematician called Lucas.
p172
aVWord up, L-Dog.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VBut one of the great things about the search for massive primes,
p177
aVit's not just finding the primes.
p178
aVSometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting.
p179
aVLucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1,
p180
aV21 digits long, was not prime.
p181
aVBut he didn't know what the factors were.
p182
aVWe knew it was like six, but we didn't know
p183
aVwhat are the 2 x 3 that multiply together
p184
aVto give us that massive number.
p185
aa(lp186
VWe didn't know for almost 40 years
p187
aVuntil Frank Nelson Cole came along.
p188
aVAnd at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians,
p189
aVhe walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk,
p190
aVand started writing out the powers of two:
p191
aVtwo, four, eight, 16 \u2014
p192
aVcome on, join in with me, you know how it goes \u2014
p193
aV32, 64, 128, 256,
p194
aV512, 1,024, 2,048.
p195
aVI'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second.
p196
aVFrank Nelson Cole did not stop there.
p197
aVHe went on and on
p198
aVand calculated 67 powers of two.
p199
aVHe took away one and wrote that number on the board.
p200
aVA frisson of excitement went around the room.
p201
aVIt got even more exciting when he then wrote down
p202
aVthese two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format \u2014
p203
aVand for the rest of the hour of his talk
p204
aVFrank Nelson Cole busted that out.
p205
aVHe had found the prime factors
p206
aVof (2 ^ 67) - 1.
p207
aVThe room went berserk \u2014
p208
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p209
aVas Frank Nelson Cole sat down,
p210
aVhaving delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics
p211
aVwith no words.
p212
aVHe admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do.
p213
aVIt took focus. It took dedication.
p214
aVIt took him, by his estimate,
p215
aV"three years of Sundays."
p216
aa(lp217
VBut then in the field of mathematics,
p218
aVas in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED,
p219
aVthe age of the computer goes along and things explode.
p220
aVThese are the largest prime numbers we knew
p221
aVdecade by decade, each one dwarfing the one before
p222
aVas computers took over and our power to calculate
p223
aVjust grew and grew.
p224
aa(lp225
VThis is the largest prime number we knew in 1996,
p226
aVa very emotional year for me.
p227
aVIt was the year I left university.
p228
aVI was torn between mathematics and media.
p229
aVIt was a tough decision. I loved university.
p230
aVMy arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VBut I came to a realization about my own ability.
p235
aVPut simply, in a room full of randomly selected people,
p236
aVI'm a maths genius.
p237
aVIn a roomful of maths Ph.Ds,
p238
aVI'm as dumb as a box of hammers.
p239
aVMy skill is not in the mathematics.
p240
aVIt is in telling the story of the mathematics.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd during that time, since I've left university,
p243
aVthese numbers have got bigger and bigger,
p244
aVeach one dwarfing the last,
p245
aVuntil along came this man, Dr. Curtis Cooper,
p246
aVwho a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime,
p247
aVonly to see it snatched away by a rival university.
p248
aVAnd then Curtis Cooper got it back.
p249
aVNot years ago, not months ago, days ago.
p250
aVIn an amazing moment of serendipity,
p251
aVI had to send TED a new slide
p252
aVto show you what this guy had done.
p253
aa(lp254
VI still remember \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p255
aVI still remember when it happened.
p256
aVI was doing my breakfast radio show.
p257
aVI looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet:
p258
aV"Adam, have you seen the new largest prime number?"
p259
aVI shivered \u2014
p260
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p261
aVcontacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room,
p262
aVand said "Girls, hold the front page.
p263
aVWe're not talking politics today.
p264
aVWe're not talking sport today.
p265
aVThey found another megaprime."
p266
aVThe girls just shook their heads,
p267
aVput them in their hands, and let me go my own way.
p268
aa(lp269
VIt's because of Curtis Cooper that we know,
p270
aVcurrently the largest prime number we know,
p271
aVis 2 ^ 57,885,161.
p272
aVDon't forget to subtract the one.
p273
aVThis number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.
p274
aVIf you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file,
p275
aVthat's 22 meg.
p276
aVFor the slightly less geeky of you,
p277
aVthink about the Harry Potter novels, okay?
p278
aVThis is the first Harry Potter novel.
p279
aVThis is all seven Harry Potter novels,
p280
aVbecause she did tend to faff on a bit near the end.
p281
aV(Laughter)
p282
aVWritten out as a book, this number would run
p283
aVthe length of the Harry Potter novels and half again.
p284
aVHere's a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime.
p285
aVIf, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday,
p286
aVwe'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second,
p287
aVit would have taken five hours to show you that number.
p288
aVI was keen to do it, could not convince Bono.
p289
aVThat's the way it goes.
p290
aa(lp291
VThis number is 17 and a half thousand slides long,
p292
aVand we know it is prime as confidently
p293
aVas we know the number seven is prime.
p294
aVThat fills me with almost sexual excitement.
p295
aVAnd who am I kidding when I say almost?
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VI know what you're thinking:
p300
aVAdam, we're happy that you're happy,
p301
aVbut why should we care?
p302
aVLet me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful.
p303
aa(lp304
VFirst of all, as I explained, to ask a computer
p305
aV"Is that number prime?" to type it in its abbreviated form,
p306
aVand then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy,
p307
aVis a remarkably simple question to ask.
p308
aVIt's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer,
p309
aVand just requires phenomenal grunt.
p310
aVLarge prime numbers are a great way of testing
p311
aVthe speed and accuracy of computer chips.
p312
aa(lp313
VBut secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime,
p314
aVhe wasn't the only guy searching.
p315
aVMy laptop at home was looking through
p316
aVfour potential candidate primes myself
p317
aVas part of a networked computer hunt around the world
p318
aVfor these large numbers.
p319
aVThe discovery of that prime is similar to the work
p320
aVpeople are doing in unraveling RNA sequences,
p321
aVin searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects.
p322
aVWe live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs
p323
aVare not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia
p324
aVbut on laptops, desktops,
p325
aVin the palms of people's hands
p326
aVwho are simply helping out for the search.
p327
aa(lp328
VBut for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor
p329
aVfor the time in which we live,
p330
aVwhen human minds and machines can conquer together.
p331
aVWe've heard a lot about robots in this TED.
p332
aVWe've heard a lot about what they can and can't do.
p333
aVIt is true, you can now download onto your smartphone
p334
aVan app that would beat most grandmasters at chess.
p335
aa(lp336
VYou think that's cool.
p337
aVHere's a machine doing something cool.
p338
aVThis is the CubeStormer II.
p339
aVIt can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube.
p340
aVUsing the power of the smartphone,
p341
aVit can examine the cube and solve the cube
p342
aVin five seconds.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VThat scares some people. That excites me.
p347
aVHow lucky are we to live in this age
p348
aVwhen mind and machine can work together?
p349
aa(lp350
VI was asked in an interview last year in my capacity
p351
aVas a lower-case "c" celebrity in Australia,
p352
aV"What was your highlight of 2012?"
p353
aVPeople were expecting me to talk about
p354
aVmy beloved Sydney Swans football team.
p355
aVIn our beautiful, indigenous sport of Australian football,
p356
aVthey won the equivalent of the Super Bowl.
p357
aVI was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.
p358
aVIt wasn't my highlight of 2012.
p359
aVPeople thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show.
p360
aVIt might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough.
p361
aVIt might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no.
p362
aVIt might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done.
p363
aVNo, it wasn't. The highlight of 2012, so clearly,
p364
aVwas the discovery of the Higgs boson.
p365
aVGive it up for the fundamental particle
p366
aVthat bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass.
p367
aa(lp368
V(Applause)
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd what was so gorgeous about this discovery was
p371
aV50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team
p372
aVconsidered one of the deepest of all questions:
p373
aVHow is it that the things that make us up have no mass?
p374
aVI've clearly got mass. Where does it come from?
p375
aVAnd he postulated a suggestion
p376
aVthat there's this infinite, incredibly small field
p377
aVstretching throughout the universe,
p378
aVand as other particles go through those particles
p379
aVand interact, that's where they get their mass.
p380
aVThe rest of the scientific community said,
p381
aV"Great idea, Higgsy.
p382
aVWe've got no idea if we could ever prove it.
p383
aVIt's beyond our reach."
p384
aVAnd within just 50 years,
p385
aVin his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience,
p386
aVwe had designed the greatest machine ever
p387
aVto prove this incredible idea
p388
aVthat originated just in a human mind.
p389
aa(lp390
VThat's what is so exciting for me about this prime number.
p391
aVWe thought it might be there,
p392
aVand we went and found it.
p393
aVThat is the essence of being human.
p394
aVThat is what we are all about.
p395
aVOr as my friend Descartes might put it,
p396
aVwe think,
p397
aVtherefore we are.
p398
aa(lp399
VThank you.

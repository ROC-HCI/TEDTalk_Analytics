VYou may want to take a closer look.
p5
aVThere's more to this painting than meets the eye.
p6
aVAnd yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man,
p7
aVbut I didn't paint it on canvas.
p8
aVI painted it directly on top of the man.
p9
aa(lp10
VWhat I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether,
p11
aVand if I want to paint your portrait,
p12
aVI'm painting it on you, physically on you.
p13
aVThat also means you're probably going to end up
p14
aVwith an earful of paint,
p15
aVbecause I need to paint your ear on your ear.
p16
aVEverything in this scene, the person, the clothes,
p17
aVchairs, wall, gets covered in a mask of paint
p18
aVthat mimics what's directly below it,
p19
aVand in this way, I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene
p20
aVand make it look like a two-dimensional painting.
p21
aVI can photograph it from any angle,
p22
aVand it will still look 2D.
p23
aVThere's no Photoshop here.
p24
aVThis is just a photo
p25
aVof one of my three-dimensional paintings.
p26
aa(lp27
VYou might be wondering how I came up with this idea
p28
aVof turning people into paintings.
p29
aVBut originally, this had nothing to do
p30
aVwith either people or paint.
p31
aVIt was about shadows.
p32
aVI was fascinated with the absence of light,
p33
aVand I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality
p34
aVand pin it down before it changed.
p35
aVI came up with the idea of painting shadows.
p36
aVI loved that I could hide within this shadow
p37
aVmy own painted version,
p38
aVand it would be almost invisible
p39
aVuntil the light changed, and all of a sudden
p40
aVmy shadow would be brought to the light.
p41
aa(lp42
VI wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on,
p43
aVand I thought of my friend Bernie.
p44
aVBut I didn't just want to paint the shadows.
p45
aVI also wanted to paint the highlights
p46
aVand create a mapping on his body in greyscale.
p47
aVI had a very specific vision of what this would look like,
p48
aVand as I was painting him,
p49
aVI made sure to follow that very closely.
p50
aVBut something kept on flickering before my eyes.
p51
aVI wasn't quite sure what I was looking at.
p52
aVAnd then when I took that moment to take a step back,
p53
aVmagic.
p54
aVI had turned my friend into a painting.
p55
aVI couldn't have foreseen that
p56
aVwhen I wanted to paint a shadow,
p57
aVI would pull out this whole other dimension,
p58
aVthat I would collapse it,
p59
aVthat I would take a painting and make it my friend
p60
aVand then bring him back to a painting.
p61
aa(lp62
VI was a little conflicted though,
p63
aVbecause I was so excited about what I'd found,
p64
aVbut I was just about to graduate from college
p65
aVwith a degree in political science,
p66
aVand I'd always had this dream
p67
aVof going to Washington, D.C.,
p68
aVand sitting at a desk
p69
aVand working in government.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVWhy did this have to get in the way of all that?
p72
aa(lp73
VI made the tough decision
p74
aVof going home after graduation
p75
aVand not going up to Capitol Hill,
p76
aVbut going down to my parents' basement
p77
aVand making it my job to learn how to paint.
p78
aVI had no idea where to begin.
p79
aVThe last time I'd painted,
p80
aVI was 16 years old at summer camp,
p81
aVand I didn't want to teach myself how to paint
p82
aVby copying the old masters
p83
aVor stretching a canvas
p84
aVand practicing over and over again on that surface,
p85
aVbecause that's not what this project was about for me.
p86
aVIt was about space and light.
p87
aa(lp88
VMy early canvases ended up being
p89
aVthings that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas,
p90
aVlike fried food.
p91
aVIt's nearly impossible
p92
aVto get paint to stick to the grease in an egg.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVEven harder was getting paint to stick
p95
aVto the acid in a grapefruit.
p96
aVIt just would erase my brush strokes
p97
aVlike invisible ink.
p98
aVI'd put something down, and instantly it would be gone.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd if I wanted to paint on people,
p101
aVwell, I was a little bit embarrassed
p102
aVto bring people down into my studio
p103
aVand show them that I spent my days in a basement
p104
aVputting paint on toast.
p105
aVIt just seemed like it made more sense
p106
aVto practice by painting on myself.
p107
aVOne of my favorite models actually ended up being
p108
aVa retired old man
p109
aVwho not only didn't mind sitting still
p110
aVand getting the paint in his ears,
p111
aVbut he also didn't really have much embarrassment
p112
aVabout being taken out into very public places
p113
aVfor exhibition,
p114
aVlike the Metro.
p115
aa(lp116
VI was having so much fun with this process.
p117
aVI was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles,
p118
aVand I wanted to see what else I could do with it.
p119
aVI came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand,
p120
aVand we had the idea of creating paintings
p121
aVin a more unusual surface,
p122
aVand that was milk.
p123
aVWe got a pool. We filled it with milk.
p124
aVWe filled it with Sheila. And I began painting.
p125
aVAnd the images were always
p126
aVcompletely unexpected in the end,
p127
aVbecause I could have a very specific image
p128
aVabout how it would turn out,
p129
aVI could paint it to match that,
p130
aVbut the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk,
p131
aVeverything would change.
p132
aVIt was in constant flux,
p133
aVand we had to, rather than fight it, embrace it,
p134
aVsee where the milk would take us
p135
aVand compensate to make it even better.
p136
aVSometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk,
p137
aVit would wash all the paint off of her arms,
p138
aVand it might seem a little bit clumsy,
p139
aVbut our solution would be, okay, hide your arms.
p140
aVAnd one time, she got so much milk in her hair
p141
aVthat it just smeared all the paint off of her face.
p142
aVAll right, well, hide your face.
p143
aVAnd we ended up with something far more elegant
p144
aVthan we could have imagined,
p145
aVeven though this is essentially the same solution
p146
aVthat a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands,
p147
aVjust hiding them in the pockets.
p148
aa(lp149
VWhen we started out on the milk project,
p150
aVand when I started out,
p151
aVI couldn't have foreseen that I would go
p152
aVfrom pursuing my dream in politics
p153
aVand working at a desk
p154
aVto tripping over a shadow
p155
aVand then turning people into paintings
p156
aVand painting on people in a pool of milk.
p157
aVBut then again, I guess it's also not unforeseeable
p158
aVthat you can find the strange in the familiar,
p159
aVas long as you're willing to look beyond
p160
aVwhat's already been brought to light,
p161
aVthat you can see what's below the surface,
p162
aVhiding in the shadows,
p163
aVand recognize that there can be more there
p164
aVthan meets the eye.
p165
aa(lp166
VThank you.

What may look like a traditional painted portrait is actually a photograph of a living, breathing person whose face, clothes and surroundings are all covered in acrylic paint. The 3D paintings can be photographed from any angle and maintain the illusion of flatness without the need for digital effects.</p><p>Alexa stumbled upon this technique by accident. While she was studying political science in college, she had an idea for an art project: what would it look like if she covered up shadows in the landscape with black paint? This question led her down a rabbit hole of experiments with painitng in 3D space that led to her discovery of this new style of optical illusion. She paints on people around the world who become part of the urban landscape as living street art. The photographs of the ephemeral painting performances hang on the walls of galleries and museums.</p><p>She recieved critical acclaim from <em>CNN</em>, <em>Wired</em>, <em>NPR</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and more. She has lectured at the CalArts, UC-Berkeley, Apple, Adobe and <em>National Geographic London</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexa travels the world creating live painting performances, art installations and commisioned portraits.

"whylisten": "<p>Alexa Meade creates paintings in 3D space that make the real world appear to be a 2D painting. What may look like a traditional painted portrait is actually a photograph of a living, breathing person whose face, clothes and surroundings are all covered in acrylic paint. The 3D paintings can be photographed from any angle and maintain the illusion of flatness without the need for digital effects.</p><p>Alexa stumbled upon this technique by accident. While she was studying political science in college, she had an idea for an art project: what would it look like if she covered up shadows in the landscape with black paint? This question led her down a rabbit hole of experiments with painitng in 3D space that led to her discovery of this new style of optical illusion. She paints on people around the world who become part of the urban landscape as living street art. The photographs of the ephemeral painting performances hang on the walls of galleries and museums.</p><p>She recieved critical acclaim from <em>CNN</em>, <em>Wired</em>, <em>NPR</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and more. She has lectured at the CalArts, UC-Berkeley, Apple, Adobe and <em>National Geographic London</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexa travels the world creating live painting performances, art installations and commisioned portraits. Currently, Alexa is collaborating with scientists and researching spacetime at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. Alexa is making a series of magical paintings with David Blaine, transforming her home into a &quot;Fun House&quot; with Chris Hughes, developing a line of toys and volunteering in the art program at the Braille Institute.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "alexa_meade", "whotheyare": "Alexa Meade paints mesmerizing, illusionistic portraits directly on living subjects, subverting familiar visual cues with perspective and color.", "whatotherssay": "Meade uses a brush.

VThe brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy,
p5
aVwrote a volume called
p6
aV"People Who Led to My Plays."
p7
aVAnd if I were to write a volume,
p8
aVit would be called,
p9
aV"Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions"
p10
aVbecause my work,
p11
aVin understanding art and in understanding culture,
p12
aVhas come by following artists,
p13
aVby looking at what artists mean
p14
aVand what they do and who they are.
p15
aVJ.J. from "Good Times,"
p16
aV(Applause)
p17
aVsignificant to many people of course
p18
aVbecause of "Dy-no-mite,"
p19
aVbut perhaps more significant
p20
aVas the first, really, black artist
p21
aVon primetime TV.
p22
aVJean-Michel Basquiat,
p23
aVimportant to me because [he was]
p24
aVthe first black artist in real time
p25
aVthat showed me the possibility of
p26
aVwho and what I was about to enter into.
p27
aa(lp28
VMy overall project is about art \u2014
p29
aVspecifically, about black artists \u2014
p30
aVvery generally
p31
aVabout the way in which art
p32
aVcan change the way we think
p33
aVabout culture and ourselves.
p34
aVMy interest is in artists
p35
aVwho understand and rewrite history,
p36
aVwho think about themselves
p37
aVwithin the narrative
p38
aVof the larger world of art,
p39
aVbut who have created new places
p40
aVfor us to see and understand.
p41
aVI'm showing two artists here,  Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker,
p42
aVtwo of many who really form for me
p43
aVthe essential questions that I wanted to bring
p44
aVas a curator to the world.
p45
aVI was interested in the idea
p46
aVof why and how
p47
aVI could create a new story,
p48
aVa new narrative in art history
p49
aVand a new narrative in the world.
p50
aVAnd to do this, I knew
p51
aVthat I had to see the way in which artists work,
p52
aVunderstand the artist's studio
p53
aVas a laboratory,
p54
aVimagine, then,
p55
aVreinventing the museum as a think tank
p56
aVand looking at the exhibition
p57
aVas the ultimate white paper \u2014 asking questions,
p58
aVproviding the space
p59
aVto look and to think about answers.
p60
aa(lp61
VIn 1994,
p62
aVwhen I was a curator at the Whitney Museum,
p63
aVI made an exhibition called Black Male.
p64
aVIt looked at the intersection
p65
aVof race and gender
p66
aVin contemporary American art.
p67
aVIt sought to express
p68
aVthe ways in which art
p69
aVcould provide a space for dialogue \u2014
p70
aVcomplicated dialogue,
p71
aVdialogue with many, many points of entry \u2014
p72
aVand how the museum could be the space
p73
aVfor this contest of ideas.
p74
aVThis exhibition included
p75
aVover 20 artists
p76
aVof various ages and races,
p77
aVbut all looking at black masculinity
p78
aVfrom a very particular point of view.
p79
aVWhat was significant about this exhibition
p80
aVis the way in which
p81
aVit engaged me in my role
p82
aVas a curator, as a catalyst,
p83
aVfor this dialogue.
p84
aVOne of the things that happened
p85
aVvery distinctly in the course of this exhibition
p86
aVis I was confronted with the idea
p87
aVof how powerful images can be
p88
aVin people's understanding  of themselves and each other.
p89
aa(lp90
VI'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub,
p91
aVone on the left by Robert Colescott.
p92
aVAnd in the course of the exhibition \u2014
p93
aVwhich was contentious, controversial
p94
aVand ultimately, for me,
p95
aVlife-changing
p96
aVin my sense of what art could be \u2014
p97
aVa woman came up to me on the gallery floor
p98
aVto express her concern about the nature
p99
aVof how powerful images could be
p100
aVand how we understood each other.
p101
aVAnd she pointed to the work on the left
p102
aVto tell me how problematic this image was,
p103
aVas it related, for her, to the idea of
p104
aVhow black people had been represented.
p105
aVAnd she pointed to the image on the right
p106
aVas an example, to me, of the kind of dignity
p107
aVthat needed to be portrayed
p108
aVto work against those images in the media.
p109
aVShe then assigned these works racial identities,
p110
aVbasically saying to me that the work on the right,
p111
aVclearly, was made by a black artist,
p112
aVthe work on the left, clearly, by a white artist,
p113
aVwhen, in effect,
p114
aVthat was the opposite case:
p115
aVBob Colescott, African-American artist;
p116
aVLeon Golub, a white artist.
p117
aVThe point of that for me was
p118
aVto say \u2014 in that space, in that moment \u2014
p119
aVthat I really, more than anything,
p120
aVwanted to understand
p121
aVhow images could work, how images did work,
p122
aVand how artists provided
p123
aVa space bigger than one
p124
aVthat we could imagine in our day-to-day lives
p125
aVto work through these images.
p126
aa(lp127
VFast-forward and I end up in Harlem;
p128
aVhome for many of black America,
p129
aVvery much the psychic heart
p130
aVof the black experience,
p131
aVreally the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.
p132
aVHarlem now, sort of explaining
p133
aVand thinking of itself in this part of the century,
p134
aVlooking both backwards and forwards ...
p135
aVI always say Harlem is an interesting community
p136
aVbecause, unlike many other places,
p137
aVit thinks of itself in the past, present
p138
aVand the future simultaneously;
p139
aVno one speaks of it just in the now.
p140
aVIt's always what it was and what it can be.
p141
aVAnd, in thinking about that,
p142
aVthen my second project, the second question I ask is:
p143
aVCan a museum
p144
aVbe a catalyst in a community?
p145
aVCan a museum house artists
p146
aVand allow them to be change agents
p147
aVas communities rethink themselves?
p148
aVThis is Harlem, actually, on January 20th,
p149
aVthinking about itself in a very wonderful way.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem,
p152
aVthinking about exhibitions there,
p153
aVthinking about what it means to
p154
aVdiscover art's possibility.
p155
aVNow, what does this mean to some of you?
p156
aVIn some cases, I know that many of you
p157
aVare involved in cross-cultural dialogues,
p158
aVyou're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.
p159
aVThink about the place that artists can play in that \u2014
p160
aVthat is the kind of incubation and advocacy
p161
aVthat I work towards, in working with young, black artists.
p162
aVThink about artists, not as content providers,
p163
aVthough they can be brilliant at that,
p164
aVbut, again, as real catalysts.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.
p167
aVAnd I bring this up because it's important to locate
p168
aVthis practice in history.
p169
aVTo look at 1968,
p170
aVin the incredible historic moment that it is,
p171
aVand think of the arc that has happened since then,
p172
aVto think of the possibilities that we are all
p173
aVprivileged to stand in today
p174
aVand imagine that this museum
p175
aVthat came out of a moment of great protest
p176
aVand one that was so much about
p177
aVexamining the history and the legacy
p178
aVof important African-American artists
p179
aVto the history of art in this country
p180
aVlike Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis,
p181
aVRomare Bearden.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd then, of course,
p184
aVto bring us to today.
p185
aVIn 1975, Muhammad Ali
p186
aVgave a lecture at Harvard University.
p187
aVAfter his lecture, a student got up and said to him,
p188
aV"Give us a poem."
p189
aVAnd Mohammed Ali said, "Me, we."
p190
aVA profound statement about the individual and the community.
p191
aVThe space in which now,
p192
aVin my project of discovery, of thinking about artists,
p193
aVof trying to define
p194
aVwhat might be
p195
aVblack art cultural movement of the 21st century.
p196
aVWhat that might mean
p197
aVfor cultural movements all over this moment,
p198
aVthe "me, we" seems
p199
aVincredibly prescient
p200
aVtotally important.
p201
aa(lp202
VTo this end,
p203
aVthe specific project that has made this possible for me
p204
aVis a series of exhibitions,
p205
aVall titled with an F \u2014
p206
aVFreestyle, Frequency and Flow \u2014
p207
aVwhich have set out to discover
p208
aVand define
p209
aVthe young, black artists working in this moment
p210
aVwho I feel strongly
p211
aVwill continue to work over the next many years.
p212
aVThis series of exhibitions
p213
aVwas made specifically
p214
aVto try and question
p215
aVthe idea of what it would mean
p216
aVnow, at this point in history,
p217
aVto see art as a catalyst;
p218
aVwhat it means now, at this point in history,
p219
aVas we define and redefine culture,
p220
aVblack culture specifically in my case,
p221
aVbut culture generally.
p222
aVI named this group of artists
p223
aVaround an idea, which I put out there
p224
aVcalled post-black,
p225
aVreally meant to define them
p226
aVas artists who came and start their work now,
p227
aVlooking back at history but start in this moment, historically.
p228
aa(lp229
VIt is really in this sense of discovery
p230
aVthat I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.
p231
aVThis new set of questions is:
p232
aVWhat does it mean, right now,
p233
aVto be African-American in America?
p234
aVWhat can artwork say about this?
p235
aVWhere can a museum exist
p236
aVas the place for us all
p237
aVto have this conversation?
p238
aVReally, most exciting about this
p239
aVis thinking about the energy and the excitement
p240
aVthat young artists can bring.
p241
aVTheir works for me are about,
p242
aVnot always just simply
p243
aVabout the aesthetic innovation
p244
aVthat their minds imagine, that their visions create
p245
aVand put out there in the world,
p246
aVbut more, perhaps, importantly,
p247
aVthrough the excitement of the community
p248
aVthat they create as important voices
p249
aVthat would allow us right now to understand our situation,
p250
aVas well as in the future.
p251
aVI am continually amazed
p252
aVby the way in which
p253
aVthe subject of race
p254
aVcan take itself in many places
p255
aVthat we don't imagine it should be.
p256
aVI am always amazed
p257
aVby the way in which artists are willing
p258
aVto do that in their work.
p259
aVIt is why I look to art.
p260
aVIt's why I ask questions of art.
p261
aVIt is why I make exhibitions.
p262
aa(lp263
VNow, this exhibition, as I said,
p264
aV40 young artists done over the course of eight years,
p265
aVand for me it's about considering the implications.
p266
aVIt's considering the implications of
p267
aVwhat this generation has to say to the rest of us.
p268
aVIt's considering what it means for these artists
p269
aVto be both out in the world as their work travels,
p270
aVbut in their communities
p271
aVas people who are seeing and thinking
p272
aVabout the issues that face us.
p273
aVIt's also about thinking about
p274
aVthe creative spirit and nurturing it,
p275
aVand imagining, particularly in urban America,
p276
aVabout the nurturing of the spirit.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?
p279
aVFor me, it is about re-imagining
p280
aVthis cultural discourse in an international context.
p281
aVSo the last iteration of this project
p282
aVhas been called Flow,
p283
aVwith the idea now of creating
p284
aVa real network
p285
aVof artists around the world;
p286
aVreally looking, not so much
p287
aVfrom Harlem and out, but looking across,
p288
aVand Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.
p289
aVAnd as many of us think about that continent
p290
aVand think about what if means
p291
aVto us all in the 21st century,
p292
aVI have begun that looking
p293
aVthrough artists, through artworks,
p294
aVand imagining what they can tell us about the future,
p295
aVwhat they tell us about our future,
p296
aVand what they create in their sense of
p297
aVoffering us this great possibility of watching
p298
aVthat continent emerge as part
p299
aVof our bigger dialogue.
p300
aVSo, what do I discover
p301
aa(lp302
Vwhen I look at artworks?
p303
aVWhat do I think about
p304
aVwhen I think about art?
p305
aVI feel like the privilege I've had as a curator
p306
aVis not just the discovery of new works,
p307
aVthe discovery of exciting works.
p308
aVBut, really, it has been
p309
aVwhat I've discovered about myself
p310
aVand what I can offer
p311
aVin the space of an exhibition,
p312
aVto talk about beauty, to talk about power,
p313
aVto talk about ourselves,
p314
aVand to talk and speak to each other.
p315
aVThat's what makes me get up every day
p316
aVand want to think about
p317
aVthis generation of black artists and artists around the world.
p318
aa(lp319
VThank you. (Applause)

She stumbled upon the title and role she was looking for -- curator -- at the age of 12, and started up the ladder early, landing at the Whitney Museum in 1988, just one year after college. She was a co-curator of the 1993 Whitney Biennial, a controversial landmark show that showcased overtly political art made by a significant percentage of nonwhite nonmales and paved the way for topics of race, gender and identity to be discussed institutionally.</p><p>Golden first burst into the limelight as a solo curator with &quot;The Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art&quot; at the Whitney in 1994. Brilliantly imagined and carefully envisioned (and provoking controversy from a few corners), the show cemented her reputation as a formidable and fearless curator. In 2005, Golden became director and chief curator of the <a href=\\"http://www.studiomuseum.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Studio Museum</a>  in Harlem, re-dedicating the institution to forward-facing art from all corners of the African Diaspora.

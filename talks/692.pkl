VI'm going to talk
p5
aVabout some of my discoveries
p6
aVaround the world through my work.
p7
aVThese are not discoveries of planets
p8
aVor new technologies
p9
aVor science.
p10
aVThey're discoveries of people
p11
aVand the way people are, and new leadership.
p12
aa(lp13
VThis is Benki.
p14
aVBenki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.
p15
aVHis people live in Brazil
p16
aVand in Peru.
p17
aVBenki comes from a village
p18
aVso remote up in the Amazon
p19
aVthat to get there, either you have to fly
p20
aVand land on water,
p21
aVor go by canoe for several days.
p22
aVI met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo
p23
aVwhen I'd brought him and other leaders
p24
aVfrom indigenous peoples
p25
aVto meet with me and leaders from around the world,
p26
aVbecause we wanted to learn from each other.
p27
aVWe wanted to share our stories with each other.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe Ashaninka people
p30
aVare known throughout South America
p31
aVfor their dignity, their spirit
p32
aVand their resistance,
p33
aVstarting with the Incas
p34
aVand continuing through the 19th century
p35
aVwith the rubber tappers.
p36
aVToday's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people
p37
aVand to Benki
p38
aVcomes from illegal logging \u2014
p39
aVthe people who come into the beautiful forest
p40
aVand cut down ancient mahogany trees,
p41
aVfloat them down the river to world markets.
p42
aVBenki knew this.
p43
aVHe could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment,
p44
aVbecause he was taken under his grandfather's wing
p45
aVwhen he was only two years old
p46
aVto begin to learn about the forest
p47
aVand the way of life of his people.
p48
aVHis grandfather died when he was only 10.
p49
aVAnd at that young age, 10 years old,
p50
aVBenki became the paje of his community.
p51
aVNow, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture,
p52
aVthe paje is the most important
p53
aVperson in the community.
p54
aVThis is the person who contains within him
p55
aVall the knowledge, all the wisdom
p56
aVof centuries and centuries of life,
p57
aVand not just about his people,
p58
aVbut about everything that his people's survival depended on:
p59
aVthe trees, the birds,
p60
aVthe water, the soil, the forest.
p61
aVSo when he was only 10 and he became the paje,
p62
aVhe began to lead his people.
p63
aVHe began to talk to them
p64
aVabout the forest that they needed to protect,
p65
aVthe way of life they needed to nurture.
p66
aVHe explained to them
p67
aVthat it was not a question of survival of the fittest;
p68
aVit was a question of understanding
p69
aVwhat they needed to survive
p70
aVand to protect that.
p71
aa(lp72
VEight years later,
p73
aVwhen he was a young man of 18,
p74
aVBenki left the forest for the first time.
p75
aVHe went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio
p76
aVto the Earth Summit
p77
aVto tell the world what was happening
p78
aVin his tiny, little corner.
p79
aVAnd he went because he hoped the world would listen.
p80
aVSome did, not everybody.
p81
aVBut if you can imagine this young man
p82
aVwith his headdress and his flowing robe,
p83
aVlearning a new language, Portuguese,
p84
aVnot to mention English,
p85
aVgoing to Rio,
p86
aVbuilding a bridge
p87
aVto reach out to people he'd never met before \u2014
p88
aVa pretty hostile world.
p89
aVBut he wasn't dismayed.
p90
aa(lp91
VBenki came back to his village full of ideas \u2014
p92
aVnew technologies, new research,
p93
aVnew ways of understanding what was going on.
p94
aVSince that time,
p95
aVhe's continued to work with his people,
p96
aVand not only the Ashaninka Nation,
p97
aVbut all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond.
p98
aVHe's built schools
p99
aVto teach children to care for the forest.
p100
aVTogether, he's led the reforestation
p101
aVof over 25 percent of the land
p102
aVthat had been destroyed by the loggers.
p103
aVHe's created a cooperative
p104
aVto help people diversify their livelihoods.
p105
aVAnd he's brought the internet and satellite technology
p106
aVto the forest \u2014
p107
aVboth so that people themselves
p108
aVcould monitor the deforestation,
p109
aVbut also that he could speak from the forest
p110
aVto the rest of the world.
p111
aVIf you were to meet Benki
p112
aVand ask him, "Why are you doing this?
p113
aVWhy are you putting yourself at risk?
p114
aVWhy are you making yourself vulnerable
p115
aVto what is often a hostile world?"
p116
aVhe would tell you,
p117
aVas he told me,
p118
aV"I asked myself," he said,
p119
aV"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do
p120
aVto protect the forest for me?
p121
aVAnd what am I doing?"
p122
aa(lp123
VSo when I think of that,
p124
aVI wonder what our grandchildren
p125
aVand our great-grandchildren,
p126
aVwhen they ask themselves that question,
p127
aVI wonder how they will answer.
p128
aVFor me, the world is veering
p129
aVtowards a future we don't much want
p130
aVwhen we really think about it deep inside.
p131
aVIt's a future we don't know the details of,
p132
aVbut it's a future that has signs,
p133
aVjust like Benki saw the signs around him.
p134
aVWe know we are running out of what we need.
p135
aVWe're running out of fresh water.
p136
aVWe're running out of fossil fuels.
p137
aVWe're running out of land.
p138
aVWe know climate change is going to affect all of us.
p139
aVWe don't know how, but we know it will.
p140
aVAnd we know that there will be more of us than ever before \u2014
p141
aVfive times as many people in 40 years
p142
aVthan 60 years ago.
p143
aVWe are running out of what we need.
p144
aVAnd we also know
p145
aVthat the world has changed in other ways,
p146
aVthat since 1960
p147
aVthere are one-third as many new countries
p148
aVthat exist as independent entities on the planet.
p149
aVEgos, systems of government \u2014
p150
aVfiguring it out \u2014
p151
aVmassive change.
p152
aVAnd in addition to that,
p153
aVwe know that five other really big countries
p154
aVare going to have a say in the future,
p155
aVa say we haven't even really started to hear yet \u2014
p156
aVChina, India,
p157
aVRussia, South Africa
p158
aVand Benki's own Brazil,
p159
aVwhere Benki got his civil rights
p160
aVonly in the 1988 constitution.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut you know all that.
p163
aVYou know more than Benki knew when he left his forest
p164
aVand went 3,000 miles.
p165
aVYou also know
p166
aVthat we can't just keep doing what we've always done,
p167
aVbecause we'll get the results
p168
aVwe've always gotten.
p169
aVAnd this reminds me of something I understand
p170
aVLord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago,
p171
aVwhen she was pressing him, "Please change."
p172
aVHe said, "Change?
p173
aVWhy change?
p174
aVThings are bad enough as they are."
p175
aVWe have to change.
p176
aVIt's imperative to me, when I look around the world,
p177
aVthat we need to change ourselves.
p178
aVWe need new models of what it means to be a leader.
p179
aVWe need new models
p180
aVof being a leader and a human in the world.
p181
aa(lp182
VI started life as a banker.
p183
aVNow I don't admit to that
p184
aVto anybody but my very close friends.
p185
aVBut for the past eight years,
p186
aVI've done something completely different.
p187
aVMy work has taken me around the world,
p188
aVwhere I've had the real privilege
p189
aVof meeting people like Benki
p190
aVand many others who are making change happen
p191
aVin their communities \u2014
p192
aVpeople who see the world differently,
p193
aVwho are asking different questions,
p194
aVwho have different answers,
p195
aVwho understand the filters that they wear
p196
aVwhen they go out into the world.
p197
aa(lp198
VThis is Sanghamitra.
p199
aVSanghamitra comes from Bangalore.
p200
aVI met Sanghamitra eight years ago
p201
aVwhen I was in Bangalore
p202
aVorganizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's
p203
aVworking in some of the hardest aspects of society.
p204
aVSanghamitra didn't start life
p205
aVas a leader of an NGO,
p206
aVshe started her career as university professor,
p207
aVteaching English literature.
p208
aVBut she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.
p209
aVShe loved it, but she was too detached.
p210
aVAnd so in 1993,
p211
aVa long time ago,
p212
aVshe decided to start a new organization
p213
aVcalled Samraksha
p214
aVfocused on one of the hardest areas,
p215
aVone of the hardest issues in India \u2014
p216
aVanywhere in the world at the time \u2014
p217
aVHIV/AIDS.
p218
aVSince that time, Samraksha has grown
p219
aVfrom strength to strength
p220
aVand is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.
p221
aVBut if you just think about the state of the world
p222
aVand knowledge of HIV/AIDS
p223
aVin 1993 \u2014
p224
aVin India at that time it was skyrocketing
p225
aVand nobody understood why,
p226
aVand everyone was actually very, very afraid.
p227
aVToday there are still three million
p228
aVHIV-positive people in India.
p229
aVThat's the second largest population in the world.
p230
aa(lp231
VWhen I asked Sanghamitra,
p232
aV"How did you get from English literature
p233
aVto HIV/AIDS?"
p234
aVnot an obvious path,
p235
aVshe said to me,
p236
aV"It's all connected.
p237
aVLiterature makes one sensitive,
p238
aVsensitive to people,
p239
aVto their dreams and to their ideas."
p240
aVSince that time, under her leadership,
p241
aVSamraksha has been a pioneer
p242
aVin all fields related
p243
aVto HIV/AIDS.
p244
aVThey have respite homes, the first,
p245
aVthe first care centers,
p246
aVthe first counseling services \u2014
p247
aVand not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore,
p248
aVbut in the hardest to reach villages
p249
aVin the state of Karnataka.
p250
aVEven that wasn't enough.
p251
aVShe wanted to change policy at the government level.
p252
aV10 of their programs that she pioneered
p253
aVare now government policy and funded by the government.
p254
aVThey take care of 20,000-odd people today
p255
aVin over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.
p256
aa(lp257
VShe works with people like Murali Krishna.
p258
aVMurali Krishna comes from one of those villages.
p259
aVHe lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,
p260
aVand he's HIV-positive.
p261
aVBut he saw the work, the care,
p262
aVthe compassion
p263
aVthat Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,
p264
aVand he wanted to be part of it.
p265
aVHe's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.
p266
aVThey've pioneered a different approach to villages.
p267
aVInstead of handing out information in pamphlets,
p268
aVas is so often the case,
p269
aVthey bring theater troupes,
p270
aVsongs, music, dance.
p271
aVAnd they sit around,
p272
aVand they talk about dreams.
p273
aa(lp274
VSanghamitra told me just last week \u2014
p275
aVshe had just come back from two weeks in the villages,
p276
aVand she had a real breakthrough.
p277
aVThey were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.
p278
aVAnd the young women in the village
p279
aVspoke up and said, "We've changed our dream.
p280
aVOur dream
p281
aVis for our partners, our husbands,
p282
aVnot to be given to us because of a horoscope,
p283
aVbut to be given to us
p284
aVbecause they've been tested for HIV."
p285
aVIf you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra
p286
aVand ask her why and how,
p287
aVhow have you achieved so much?
p288
aVShe would look at you
p289
aVand very quietly, very softly say,
p290
aV"It just happened.
p291
aVIt's the spirit inside."
p292
aa(lp293
VThis is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.
p294
aVJianchuan comes from Sichuan Province
p295
aVin southwest China.
p296
aVHe was born in 1957,
p297
aVand you can imagine what his childhood
p298
aVlooked like and felt like,
p299
aVand what his life has been like
p300
aVover the last 50 tumultuous years.
p301
aVHe's been a soldier, a teacher,
p302
aVa politician, a vice-mayor
p303
aVand a business man.
p304
aVBut if you sat down and asked him, "Who are you really,
p305
aVand what do you do?"
p306
aVHe would tell you, "I'm a collector,
p307
aVand I curate a museum."
p308
aVI was lucky; I had heard about him for years,
p309
aVand I finally met him earlier this year
p310
aVat his museum in Chengdu.
p311
aa(lp312
VHe's been a collector all of his life,
p313
aVstarting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.
p314
aVNow, just think of the early 1960's in China.
p315
aVOver a lifetime, through everything,
p316
aVthrough the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,
p317
aVhe's kept collecting,
p318
aVso that he now has over eight million pieces
p319
aVin his museums
p320
aVdocumenting contemporary Chinese history.
p321
aVThese are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,
p322
aVin part because they document parts of history
p323
aVChinese choose to forget.
p324
aVFor example, he's got over one million pieces
p325
aVdocumenting the Sino-Japanese War,
p326
aVa war that's not talked about in China very much
p327
aVand whose heroes are not honored.
p328
aVWhy did he do all this?
p329
aVBecause he thought
p330
aVa nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo, from commissioning
p333
aVslightly larger than life bronze statues
p334
aVof the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,
p335
aVincluding those Chinese
p336
aVwho then fought with each other
p337
aVand left mainland China to go to Taiwan,
p338
aVto commemorating all the unknown,
p339
aVordinary soldiers who survived,
p340
aVby asking them to take prints of their hands,
p341
aVhe is making sure \u2014 one man is making sure \u2014
p342
aVthat history is not forgotten.
p343
aVBut it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.
p344
aVThis building contains the world's largest collection
p345
aVof documents and artifacts
p346
aVcommemorating the U.S. role
p347
aVin fighting on the Chinese side
p348
aVin that long war \u2014
p349
aVthe Flying Tigers.
p350
aVHe has nine other buildings \u2014
p351
aVthat are already open to the public \u2014
p352
aVfilled to the rafters with artifacts
p353
aVdocumenting contemporary Chinese history.
p354
aVTwo of the most sensitive buildings
p355
aVinclude a lifetime of collection
p356
aVabout the Cultural Revolution,
p357
aVa period that actually most Chinese
p358
aVwould prefer to forget.
p359
aVBut he doesn't want his nation
p360
aVever to forget.
p361
aa(lp362
VThese people inspire me,
p363
aVand they inspire me because they show us
p364
aVwhat is possible when you change the way
p365
aVyou look at the world,
p366
aVchange the way you look at your place in the world.
p367
aVThey looked outside,
p368
aVand then they changed what was on the inside.
p369
aVThey didn't go to business school.
p370
aVThey didn't read a manual, "How to Be a Good Leader
p371
aVin 10 Easy Steps."
p372
aVBut they have qualities we'd all recognize.
p373
aVThey have drive, passion, commitment.
p374
aVThey've gone away
p375
aVfrom what they did before,
p376
aVand they've gone
p377
aVto something they didn't know.
p378
aVThey've tried to connect worlds
p379
aVthey didn't know existed before.
p380
aVThey've built bridges, and they've walked across them.
p381
aVThey have a sense of the great arc of time
p382
aVand their tiny place in it.
p383
aVThey know people have come before them
p384
aVand will follow them.
p385
aVAnd they know that they're part of a whole,
p386
aVthat they depend on other people.
p387
aVIt's not about them, they know that,
p388
aVbut it has to start with them.
p389
aVAnd they have humility.
p390
aVIt just happens.
p391
aa(lp392
VBut we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?
p393
aVWe know it takes a lot to make it happen,
p394
aVand we know the direction the world is going in.
p395
aVSo I think we need succession planning
p396
aVon a global basis.
p397
aVWe can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,
p398
aVto come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.
p399
aVI think it has to start with us.
p400
aVAnd we know, just like they knew,
p401
aVhow hard it is.
p402
aVBut the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;
p403
aVwe have models, we have examples,
p404
aVlike Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.
p405
aVWe can look at what they've done, if we look.
p406
aVWe can learn from what they've learned.
p407
aVWe can change the way we see ourselves in the world.
p408
aVAnd if we're lucky,
p409
aVwe can change the way
p410
aVour great-grandchildren
p411
aVwill answer Benki's question.
p412
aa(lp413
VThank you.

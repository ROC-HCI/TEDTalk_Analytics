VI was listed on the online biography
p5
aVthat said I was a design missionary.
p6
aVThat's a bit lofty; I'm really more
p7
aVof something like a street walker.
p8
aVI spend a lot of time in urban areas
p9
aVlooking for design,
p10
aVand studying design in the public sector.
p11
aVI take about 5,000 photographs a year,
p12
aVand I thought that I would edit from these,
p13
aVand try to come up with some images
p14
aVthat might be appropriate and interesting to you.
p15
aVAnd I used three criteria:
p16
aVthe first was, I thought I'd talk about
p17
aVreal design within reach,
p18
aVdesign that's free, not design not quite within reach,
p19
aVas we're fondly known by our competition and competitors,
p20
aVbut stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free,
p21
aVstuff that was available to all people,
p22
aVand stuff that probably contains some other important messages.
p23
aa(lp24
VI'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example.
p25
aVA very common public design done in the '50s.
p26
aVIt's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form,
p27
aVvery consistent with the Brazilian culture \u2014
p28
aVI think good design adds to culture.
p29
aVWholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.
p30
aVBut I think these are my sort of information highways:
p31
aVI live in much more of an analog world,
p32
aVwhere pedestrian traffic and
p33
aVinteraction and diversity exchange,
p34
aVand where I think the simple things under our feet
p35
aVhave a great amount of meaning to us.
p36
aa(lp37
VHow did I get started in this business?
p38
aVI was a ceramic designer for about 10 years,
p39
aVand just loved utilitarian form \u2014
p40
aVsimple things that we use every day,
p41
aVlittle compositions of color and surface on form.
p42
aVThis led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach,
p43
aVa company dealing with simple forms,
p44
aVmaking good designers available to us,
p45
aVand also selling the personalities and character of the designers
p46
aVas well, and it seems to have worked.
p47
aVA couple of years into the process,
p48
aVI spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam:
p51
aVI was there going into the design stores,
p52
aVand mixing with our crowd of designers,
p53
aVand I recognized that a whole lot of stuff
p54
aVpretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization
p55
aVhas had that in our community also.
p56
aVWe know a lot about what's going on with design around the world,
p57
aVand it's getting increasingly more difficult
p58
aVto find design that reflects a unique culture.
p59
aVI was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam
p60
aVand I recognized, you know, the big story
p61
aVfrom Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores,
p62
aVit's what's out on the streets,
p63
aVand maybe it's self-explanatory,
p64
aVbut a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism,
p65
aVthat's preserved its kind of architecture and character,
p66
aVand where the bicycle plays an important part of the way
p67
aVin which people get around and where pedestrian rights
p68
aVare protected.
p69
aVAnd I write a newsletter that goes out every week,
p70
aVand I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response
p71
aVthat I realized that design, that common design,
p72
aVthat's in the public area means a lot to people,
p73
aVand establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog.
p74
aa(lp75
VI then kind of thought about the other cities
p76
aVin Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design,
p77
aVlike Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy \u2014
p78
aVall cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles,
p79
aVand where pedestrian areas \u2014 and I came to the conclusion that perhaps
p80
aVthere was something about these important design centers
p81
aVthat dealt with bicycles and foot traffic,
p82
aVand I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there
p83
aVis that there are universities and schools
p84
aVwhere people can't afford cars,
p85
aVbut it did seem that in many of these areas
p86
aVpedestrian traffic was protected.
p87
aVYou wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike:
p88
aVa designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum.
p89
aVBut I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam
p90
aVand recognized, you know, the first job of design
p91
aVis to serve a social purpose.
p92
aVAnd so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike,
p93
aVbut being a very good example of design.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time
p96
aVin the cities, looking at design
p97
aVfor common evidence of design
p98
aVthat really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.
p99
aVI was in Buenos Aires very recently,
p100
aVand I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.
p101
aVHe's a Spanish architect and designer.
p102
aVAnd the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge \u2014
p103
aVI love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally \u2014
p104
aVand it was a bit of a disappointment,
p105
aVbecause of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.
p106
aVAnd I recognized that oftentimes design,
p107
aVwhen you're set up to see design,
p108
aVit can be a bit of a letdown.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut there were lots of other things going on in this area:
p111
aVit was a kind of construction zone;
p112
aVa lot of buildings were going up.
p113
aVAnd, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much;
p114
aVyou get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition
p115
aVthat might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.
p116
aVBut to me it was an example of
p117
aVindustrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation
p118
aVand a nice little still life \u2014 kind of unintended piece of design.
p119
aVAnd going a little closer, you get a different perspective.
p120
aVI find these little vignettes,
p121
aVthese little accidental pieces of design,
p122
aVto be refreshing.
p123
aVThey give me, I don't know,
p124
aVa sense of correctness in the world
p125
aVand some visual delight in the knowledge
p126
aVthat the building will probably never look as good
p127
aVas this simple industrial scaffolding
p128
aVthat is there to serve.
p129
aa(lp130
VDown the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure:
p131
aVhorizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines
p132
aVgoing across, these magenta squiggles,
p133
aVthe workmen being reduced to decorative elements,
p134
aVjust a nice, kind of, breakup
p135
aVof the urban place.
p136
aVAnd, you know, that no longer exists.
p137
aVYou've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life's
p138
aVlike listening to little songs or something:
p139
aVit gives me an enormous amount of pleasure.
p140
aVAntoine Predock designed
p141
aVa wonderful ball stadium in San Diego
p142
aVcalled Petco Park.
p143
aVA terrific use of local materials,
p144
aVbut inside you could find some interior compositions.
p145
aVSome people go to baseball stadiums to look at games;
p146
aVI go and see design relationships.
p147
aVJust a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture,
p148
aVand the way that the trees form vertical elements.
p149
aa(lp150
VRed is a color in the landscape
p151
aVthat is often on stop signs.
p152
aVIt takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion;
p153
aVit stares back at you the way that a figure might.
p154
aVJust a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.
p155
aVConstruction site in New York:
p156
aVred having this kind of emotional power
p157
aVthat's almost an equivalent with the way in which \u2014
p158
aVcuteness of puppies and such.
p159
aVSide street in Italy.
p160
aVRed drew me into this little composition,
p161
aVoptimistic to me in the sense that maybe
p162
aVthe public service's mailbox,
p163
aVdoor service, plumbing.
p164
aVIt looks as if these different public services
p165
aVwork together to create some nice little compositions.
p166
aVIn Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.
p167
aVSimple menus put on a board,
p168
aVachieving, kind of, the sort of balance.
p169
aVBut I'm convinced that it's because
p170
aVyou're walking around the streets and seeing things.
p171
aVRed can be comical: it can draw your attention
p172
aVto the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant
p173
aVsuffering from bad civic planning in Havana.
p174
aVColor can animate simple blocks,
p175
aVsimple materials:
p176
aVwalking in New York, I'll stop.
p177
aa(lp178
VI don't always know why I take photographs of things.
p179
aVA nice visual composition of symmetry.
p180
aVCurves against sharp things.
p181
aVIt's a comment on the way in which we deal with
p182
aVpublic seating in the city of New York.
p183
aVI've come across some other just,
p184
aVkind of, curious relationships
p185
aVof bollards on the street that have different interpretations,
p186
aVbut \u2014 these things amuse me.
p187
aVSometimes a trash can \u2014 this is just in the street in San Francisco \u2014
p188
aVa trash can that's been left there for 18 months
p189
aVcreates a nice 45-degree angle
p190
aVagainst these other relationships,
p191
aVand turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.
p192
aVSo, there's this sort of silent hand of design at work
p193
aVthat I see in places that I go.
p194
aa(lp195
VHavana is a wonderful area.
p196
aVIt's quite free of commercial clutter:
p197
aVyou don't see our logos and brands and names,
p198
aVand therefore you're alert to things physically.
p199
aVAnd this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone,
p200
aVand the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that.
p201
aVAnd Cuba needs to be far more resourceful,
p202
aVbecause of the blockades and things,
p203
aVbut a really wonderful playground.
p204
aa(lp205
VI've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design.
p206
aVIn our area, in furnishings,
p207
aVthey're sort of way at the top.
p208
aVThe Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good.
p209
aVAnd I came across this little street in Venice,
p210
aVwhere the communist headquarters
p211
aVwere sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.
p212
aVAnd I realized that, you know, Italy is a place
p213
aVwhere they can accept these different ideologies
p214
aVand deal with diversity and not have the problem,
p215
aVor they can choose to ignore them,
p216
aVbut these \u2014 you don't have warring factions,
p217
aVand I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity
p218
aVwhich has made Italy so innovative
p219
aVand so tolerant.
p220
aVThe past and the present work quite well together in Italy also,
p221
aVand I think that it's recognizable there,
p222
aVand has an important effect on culture,
p223
aVbecause their public spaces are protected,
p224
aVtheir sidewalks are protected,
p225
aVand you're actually able to confront these things
p226
aVphysically,
p227
aVand I think this helps people get over
p228
aVtheir fear of modernism and other such things.
p229
aa(lp230
VA change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco.
p231
aVAnd I use this \u2014 this is, sort of,
p232
aVwhat I consider to be urban spam.
p233
aVI notice this stuff because I walk a lot,
p234
aVbut here, private industry is really kind of
p235
aVmaking a mess of the public sector.
p236
aVAnd as I look at it, I sort of say, you know,
p237
aVthe publications that report on problems in the urban area
p238
aValso contribute to it,
p239
aVand it's just my call to say to all of us,
p240
aVpublic policy won't change this at all;
p241
aVprivate industry has to work to take things like this seriously.
p242
aa(lp243
VThe extreme might be in Italy where, again,
p244
aVthere's kind of some type of control
p245
aVover what's happening in the environment is very evident,
p246
aVeven in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals.
p247
aVI walk to work every day or ride my scooter,
p248
aVand I come down and park in this little spot.
p249
aVAnd I came down one day,
p250
aVand all the bikes were red.
p251
aVNow, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,
p252
aVbut this was an actual moment
p253
aVwhen I got off my bike,
p254
aVand I looked and I thought, it's as if
p255
aVall of my biker brethren
p256
aVhad kind of gotten together and conspired
p257
aVto make a little statement.
p258
aVAnd it reminded me that \u2014
p259
aVto keep in the present,
p260
aVto look out for these kinds of things.
p261
aa(lp262
VIt gave me possibilities for wonder \u2014
p263
aVif maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree,
p264
aVand create some installations.
p265
aVBut it also reminded me of the power
p266
aVof pattern and repetition
p267
aVto make an effect in our mind.
p268
aVAnd I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect
p269
aVthan pattern and the way it unites
p270
aVkind of disparate elements.
p271
aVI was at the art show in Miami in December,
p272
aVand spent a couple of hours looking at fine art,
p273
aVand amazed at the prices of art
p274
aVand how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.
p275
aVAnd I came outside, and the valets for this car service
p276
aVhad created, you know, quite a nice little collage
p277
aVof these car keys,
p278
aVand my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags
p279
aVthat I had seen in Tokyo.
p280
aVAnd I thought that if
p281
aVpattern can unite these disparate elements,
p282
aVit can do just about anything.
p283
aa(lp284
VI don't have very many shots of people,
p285
aVbecause they kind of  get in the way of studying pure form.
p286
aVI was in a small restaurant in Spain,
p287
aVhaving lunch \u2014
p288
aVone of those nice days where
p289
aVyou had the place kind of to yourself,
p290
aVand you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area
p291
aVand the culture and the food
p292
aVand the quiet, and feeling very lucky,
p293
aVand a bus load of tourists arrived,
p294
aVemptied out,
p295
aVfilled up the restaurant.
p296
aVIn a very short period of time,
p297
aVcompletely changed the atmosphere
p298
aVand character with loud voices and large bodies and such,
p299
aVand we had to get up and leave;
p300
aVit was just that uncomfortable.
p301
aVAnd at that moment, the sun came out,
p302
aVand through this perforated screen,
p303
aVa pattern was cast over these bodies
p304
aVand they kind of faded into the rear,
p305
aVand we left the restaurant kind of
p306
aVfeeling O.K. about stuff.
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd I do think pattern
p309
aVhas the capability of eradicating
p310
aVsome of the most evil
p311
aVforces of society,
p312
aVsuch as bad form in restaurants,
p313
aVbut quite seriously, it was a statement to me
p314
aVthat one thing that you do, sort of, see
p315
aVis the aggressive nature
p316
aVof the industrial world has produced \u2014
p317
aVkind of,
p318
aVlarge masses of things,
p319
aVand when you \u2014 in monoculture,
p320
aVand I think the preservation of diversity in culture
p321
aVis something that's important to us.
p322
aa(lp323
VThe last shots that I have deal with \u2014
p324
aVcoming back to this theme of sidewalks,
p325
aVand I wanted to
p326
aVsay something here about \u2014 I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know.
p327
aVPost-Second World War,
p328
aVthe influence of the automobile
p329
aVhas really been devastating in a lot of our cities.
p330
aVA lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots
p331
aVin a sort of indiscriminate use.
p332
aVA lot of the planning departments became subordinated
p333
aVto the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars
p334
aVas it is on Wal-Mart;
p335
aVI'm not going to do that.
p336
aVBut they're real examples in urbanization
p337
aVand the change that's occurred in the last number of years,
p338
aVand the heightened sensitivity to the importance
p339
aVof our urban environments as cultural centers.
p340
aVI think that they are, that the statements that we make
p341
aVin this public sector
p342
aVare our contributions
p343
aVto a larger whole.
p344
aa(lp345
VCities are the place where we're most likely
p346
aVto encounter diversity
p347
aVand to mix with other people.
p348
aVWe go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.
p349
aVBut I think people have recognized
p350
aVthe sanctity of our urban areas.
p351
aVA place like Chicago
p352
aVhas really reached kind of a level of international stature.
p353
aVThe U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of
p354
aVenlightened urban planning and renewal,
p355
aVand I want to single out a place like Chicago,
p356
aVwhere I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero
p357
aVfor being able to work through the
p358
aVpolitical processes and all that to improve an area.
p359
aVYou would expect a city like this to have
p360
aVupgraded flower boxes
p361
aVon Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop,
p362
aVbut if you actually go along the street you find
p363
aVthe flower boxes change from street to street:
p364
aVthere's actual diversity in the plants.
p365
aVAnd the idea that a city group can maintain
p366
aVdifferent types of foliage
p367
aVis really quite exceptional.
p368
aa(lp369
VThere are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago,
p370
aVand then there are your big-D design statements:
p371
aVthe Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.
p372
aVMy measure of this as being an important bit of design
p373
aVis not so much the way that it looks,
p374
aVbut the fact that it performs a very important social function.
p375
aVThere are a lot of free concerts, for example,
p376
aVthat go on in this area;
p377
aVit has a phenomenal acoustic system.
p378
aVBut the commitment that the city has made to the public area
p379
aVis significant, and almost an international model.
p380
aVI work on the mayor's council in San Francisco,
p381
aVon the International Design Council for Mayors,
p382
aVand Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle,
p383
aVand I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.
p384
aVI thought that I should include at least one
p385
aVshot of technology for you guys.
p386
aVThis is also in Millennium Park in Chicago,
p387
aVwhere the Spanish artist-designer Plensa
p388
aVhas created, kind of,
p389
aVa digital readout in this park
p390
aVthat reflects back
p391
aVthe characters and personalities
p392
aVof the people in this area.
p393
aVAnd it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity,
p394
aVreflective of diversity, and I think
p395
aVthis marriage of both technology and art
p396
aVin the public sector is an area where the U.S.
p397
aVcan really take a leadership role,
p398
aVand Chicago is one example.
p399
aa(lp400
VThank you very much.

VWe're 25, 26 years after
p5
aVthe advent of the Macintosh,
p6
aVwhich was an astoundingly seminal event
p7
aVin the history
p8
aVof human-machine interface
p9
aVand in computation in general.
p10
aVIt fundamentally changed the way
p11
aVthat people thought about computation,
p12
aVthought about computers,
p13
aVhow they used them and who and how many people were able to use them.
p14
aVIt was such a radical change, in fact,
p15
aVthat the early Macintosh development team
p16
aVin '82, '83, '84
p17
aVhad to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up.
p18
aVNow, this is an interesting little message,
p19
aVand it's a lesson that has since, I think,
p20
aVbeen forgotten or lost or something,
p21
aVand that is, namely, that the OS is the interface.
p22
aVThe interface is the OS.
p23
aVIt's like the land and the king (i.e. Arthur) they're inseparable, they are one.
p24
aVAnd to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter.
p25
aVIt wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines.
p26
aVThere were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers.
p27
aVSo it was a necessity.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut in the quarter-century since then,
p30
aVwe've seen all of the fundamental
p31
aVsupporting technologies go berserk.
p32
aVSo memory capacity and disk capacity
p33
aVhave been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million.
p34
aVSame thing for processor speeds.
p35
aVNetworks, we didn't have networks at all
p36
aVat the time of the Macintosh's introduction,
p37
aVand that has become the single most salient aspect
p38
aVof how we live with computers.
p39
aVAnd, of course, graphics: Today
p40
aV84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy
p41
aVbuys you more graphics power
p42
aVthan you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago.
p43
aVSo we've got that incredible ramp-up.
p44
aVThen, on the side, we've got the Web
p45
aVand, increasingly, the cloud,
p46
aVwhich is fantastic,
p47
aVbut also \u2014 in the regard in which an interface is fundamental \u2014
p48
aVkind of a distraction.
p49
aVSo we've forgotten to invent new interfaces.
p50
aVCertainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard,
p51
aVand people are starting to wake up about that.
p52
aVSo what happens next? Where do we go from there?
p53
aa(lp54
VThe problem, as we see it,
p55
aVhas to do with a single, simple word: "space,"
p56
aVor a single, simple phrase:
p57
aV"real world geometry."
p58
aVComputers and the programming languages
p59
aVthat we talk to them in, that we teach them in,
p60
aVare hideously insensate when it comes to space.
p61
aVThey don't understand real world space.
p62
aVIt's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well.
p63
aVThey also don't understand time, but that's a matter for a separate talk.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo what happens if you start to
p66
aVexplain space to them?
p67
aVOne thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room.
p68
aVThe Luminous Room is a system
p69
aVin which it's considered that
p70
aVinput and output spaces are co-located.
p71
aVThat's a strangely simple,
p72
aVand yet unexplored idea, right?
p73
aVWhen you use a mouse, your hand is down here on the mouse pad.
p74
aVIt's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about:
p75
aVThe pixels are up on the display.
p76
aVSo here was a room in which all the walls, floors, ceilings,
p77
aVpets, potted plants, whatever was in there,
p78
aVwere capable, not only of display but of sensing as well.
p79
aVAnd that means input and output are in the same space
p80
aVenabling stuff like this.
p81
aVThat's a digital storage in a physical container.
p82
aVThe contract is the same
p83
aVas with real word objects in real world containers.
p84
aVHas to come back out, whatever you put in.
p85
aVThis little design experiment
p86
aVthat was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well.
p87
aVIf you presented it with a chess board,
p88
aVit tried to figure out what you might mean by that.
p89
aVAnd if there was nothing for them to do,
p90
aVthe chess pieces eventually got bored
p91
aVand hopped away.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe academics who were overseeing this work
p94
aVthought that that was too frivolous,
p95
aVso we built deadly serious applications
p96
aVlike this optics prototyping workbench
p97
aVin which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box
p98
aVbecomes a laser.
p99
aVThe beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects,
p100
aVand the system projects down the laser beam path.
p101
aVSo you've got an interface that has no interface.
p102
aVYou operate the world as you operate the real world,
p103
aVwhich is to say, with your hands.
p104
aVSimilarly, a digital wind tunnel with digital wind
p105
aVflowing from right to left \u2014
p106
aVnot that remarkable in a sense; we didn't invent the mathematics.
p107
aVBut if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display,
p108
aVit would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object,
p109
aVa real world object in that.
p110
aVHere, the real world merges with the simulation.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd finally, to pull out all the stops,
p113
aVthis is a system called Urp, for urban planners,
p114
aVin which we give architects and urban planners back
p115
aVthe models that we confiscated
p116
aVwhen we insisted that they use CAD systems.
p117
aVAnd we make the machine meet them half way.
p118
aVIt projects down digital shadows, as you see here.
p119
aVAnd if you introduce tools like this inverse clock,
p120
aVthen you can control the sun's position in the sky.
p121
aVThat's 8 a.m. shadows.
p122
aVThey get a little shorter at 9 a.m.
p123
aVThere you are, swinging the sun around.
p124
aVShort shadows at noon and so forth.
p125
aVAnd we built up a series of tools like this.
p126
aVThere are inter-shadowing studies
p127
aVthat children can operate,
p128
aVeven though they don't know anything about urban planning:
p129
aVTo move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building.
p130
aVA material wand makes the building
p131
aVinto a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions.
p132
aVAre you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways?
p133
aVA zoning tool connects distant structures, a building and a roadway.
p134
aVAre you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth.
p135
aVNow, if these ideas seem familiar
p136
aVor perhaps even a little dated,
p137
aVthat's great; they should seem familiar.
p138
aa(lp139
VThis work is 15 years old.
p140
aVThis stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab
p141
aVunder the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii,
p142
aVdirector of the Tangible Media Group.
p143
aVBut it was that work that was seen
p144
aVby Alex McDowell,
p145
aVone of the world's legendary production designers.
p146
aVBut Alex was preparing a little, sort of obscure, indie, arthouse film
p147
aVcalled "Minority Report" for Steven Spielberg,
p148
aVand invited us to come out from MIT
p149
aVand design the interfaces
p150
aVthat would appear in that film.
p151
aVAnd the great thing about it was
p152
aVthat Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude,
p153
aVthe idea that the putative 2054
p154
aVthat we were painting in the film be believable,
p155
aVthat he allowed us to take on that design work
p156
aVas if it were an R&D effort.
p157
aVAnd the result is sort of
p158
aVgratifyingly perpetual.
p159
aVPeople still reference those sequences in "Minority Report"
p160
aVwhen they talk about new UI design.
p161
aVSo this led full circle, in a strange way,
p162
aVto build these ideas into what we believe
p163
aVis the necessary future of human machine interface:
p164
aVthe Spatial Operating Environment, we call it.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo here we have a bunch of stuff, some images.
p167
aVAnd, using a hand,
p168
aVwe can actually exercise six degrees of freedom,
p169
aVsix degrees of navigational control.
p170
aVAnd it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye.
p171
aVAnd you can come back out
p172
aVthrough the scary orangutan.
p173
aVAnd that's all well and good.
p174
aVLet's do something a little more difficult.
p175
aVHere, we have a whole bunch of disparate images.
p176
aVWe can fly around them.
p177
aVSo navigation is a fundamental issue.
p178
aVYou have to be able to navigate in 3D.
p179
aVMuch of what we want computers to help us with in the first place
p180
aVis inherently spatial.
p181
aVAnd the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized
p182
aVto allow our wetware to make greater sense of it.
p183
aVNow we can distribute this stuff in many different ways.
p184
aVSo we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it.
p185
aVWe can organize it this way.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd, of course, it's not just about navigation,
p188
aVbut about manipulation as well.
p189
aVSo if we don't like stuff,
p190
aVor we're intensely curious about
p191
aVErnst Haeckel's scientific falsifications,
p192
aVwe can pull them out like that.
p193
aVAnd then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit
p194
aVand ask for a different distribution.
p195
aVLet's just come down a bit
p196
aVand fly around.
p197
aVSo that's a different way to look at stuff.
p198
aVIf you're of a more analytical nature
p199
aVthen you might want, actually, to look at this
p200
aVas a color histogram.
p201
aVSo now we've got the stuff color-sorted,
p202
aVangle maps onto color.
p203
aVAnd now, if we want to select stuff,
p204
aV3D, space,
p205
aVthe idea that we're tracking hands in real space
p206
aVbecomes really important because we can reach in,
p207
aVnot in 2D, not in fake 2D, but in actual 3D.
p208
aVHere are some selection planes.
p209
aVAnd we'll perform this Boolean operation
p210
aVbecause we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo, from there to the world of real work.
p213
aVHere's a logistics system,
p214
aVa small piece of one that we're currently building.
p215
aVThere're a lot of elements.
p216
aVAnd one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data
p217
aVwith three-dimensional and geospatial information.
p218
aVSo here's a familiar place.
p219
aVAnd we'll bring this back here for a second.
p220
aVMaybe select a little bit of that.
p221
aVAnd bring out this graph.
p222
aVAnd we should, now,
p223
aVbe able to fly in here
p224
aVand have a closer look.
p225
aVThese are logistics elements
p226
aVthat are scattered across the United States.
p227
aa(lp228
VOne thing that three-dimensional interactions
p229
aVand the general idea of imbuing
p230
aVcomputation with space affords you
p231
aVis a final destruction of that unfortunate
p232
aVone-to-one pairing between human beings and computers.
p233
aVThat's the old way, that's the old mantra:
p234
aVone machine, one human, one mouse, one screen.
p235
aVWell, that doesn't really cut it anymore.
p236
aVIn the real world, we have people who collaborate;
p237
aVwe have people who have to work together,
p238
aVand we have many different displays.
p239
aVAnd we might want to look at these various images.
p240
aVWe might want to ask for some help.
p241
aa(lp242
VThe author of this new pointing device
p243
aVis sitting over there,
p244
aVso I can pull this from there to there.
p245
aVThese are unrelated machines, right?
p246
aVSo the computation is space soluble and network soluble.
p247
aVSo I'm going to leave that over there
p248
aVbecause I have a question for Paul.
p249
aVPaul is the designer of this wand, and maybe its easiest
p250
aVfor him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on.
p251
aVSo let me get some of these out of the way.
p252
aVLet's pull this apart:
p253
aVI'll go ahead and explode it.
p254
aVKevin, can you help?
p255
aVLet me see if I can help us find the circuit board.
p256
aVMind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise,
p257
aVbut we do it in the lab all the time.
p258
aVAll right.
p259
aVSo collaborative work, whether it's immediately co-located
p260
aVor distant and distinct, is always important.
p261
aVAnd again, that stuff
p262
aVneeds to be undertaken in the context of space.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse
p265
aVthat takes us back to the world of imagery.
p266
aVThis is a system called TAMPER,
p267
aVwhich is a slightly whimsical look
p268
aVat what the future of editing
p269
aVand media manipulation systems might be.
p270
aVWe at Oblong believe that media should be
p271
aVaccessible in much more fine-grained form.
p272
aVSo we have a large number of movies
p273
aVstuck inside here.
p274
aVAnd let's just pick out a few elements.
p275
aVWe can zip through them
p276
aVas a possibility.
p277
aVWe can grab elements off the front,
p278
aVwhere upon they reanimate, come to life,
p279
aVand drag them down onto the table here.
p280
aVWe'll go over to Jacques Tati here
p281
aVand grab our blue friend
p282
aVand put him down on the table as well.
p283
aVWe may need more than one.
p284
aVAnd we probably need,
p285
aVwell, we probably need a cowboy
p286
aVto be quite honest.
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVYeah, let's
p289
aVtake that one.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aVYou see, cowboys and French farce people
p292
aVdon't go well together, and the system knows that.
p293
aa(lp294
VLet me leave with one final thought,
p295
aVand that is that
p296
aVone of the greatest English language writers
p297
aVof the last three decades
p298
aVsuggested that great art is always a gift.
p299
aVAnd he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [dollars],
p300
aVor whether you have to spring 70 million bucks
p301
aVto buy the stolen Vermeer;
p302
aVhe was talking about the circumstances of its creation
p303
aVand of its existence.
p304
aVAnd I think that it's time that we asked
p305
aVfor the same from technology.
p306
aVTechnology is capable of
p307
aVexpressing and being imbued with
p308
aVa certain generosity,
p309
aVand we need to demand that, in fact.
p310
aVFor some of this kind of technology,
p311
aVground center is
p312
aVa combination of design, which is crucially important.
p313
aVWe can't have advances in technology any longer
p314
aVunless design is integrated from the very start.
p315
aVAnd, as well, as of efficacy, agency.
p316
aVWe're, as human beings, the creatures that create,
p317
aVand we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task
p318
aVand are built in that same image.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo I will leave you with that. Thank you.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Applause)
p323
aa(lp324
VChris Anderson: So to ask the obvious question \u2014
p325
aVactually this is from Bill Gates \u2014
p326
aVwhen? (John Underkoffler: When?)
p327
aVCA: When real? When for us, not just in a lab and on a stage?
p328
aVCan it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers?
p329
aa(lp330
VJU: No, it has to be for every human being.
p331
aVThat's our goal entirely.
p332
aVWe won't have succeeded
p333
aVunless we take that next big step.
p334
aVI mean it's been 25 years.
p335
aVCan there really be only one interface? There can't.
p336
aa(lp337
VCA: But does that mean that, at your desk or in your home,
p338
aVyou need projectors, cameras?
p339
aVYou know, how can it work?
p340
aa(lp341
VJU: No, this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display.
p342
aVIt'll be built into architecture.
p343
aVThe gloves go away in a matter of months or years.
p344
aVSo this is the inevitability about it.
p345
aa(lp346
VCA: So, in your mind, five years time,
p347
aVsomeone can buy this as part of
p348
aVa standard computer interface?
p349
aa(lp350
VJU: I think in five years time when you buy a computer,
p351
aVyou'll get this.
p352
aa(lp353
VCA: Well that's cool.
p354
aV(Applause)
p355
aVThe world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used.
p356
aVWhat do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this?
p357
aa(lp358
VJU: That's a good question, and we ask ourselves that every day.
p359
aVAt the moment, our early-adopter customers \u2014
p360
aVand these systems are deployed out in the real world \u2014
p361
aVdo all the big data intensive, data heavy problems with it.
p362
aVSo, whether it's logistics and supply chain management
p363
aVor natural gas and resource extraction,
p364
aVfinancial services, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics,
p365
aVthose are the topics right now, but that's not a killer app.
p366
aVAnd I understand what you're asking.
p367
aa(lp368
VCA: C'mon, c'mon. Martial arts, games. C'mon.
p369
aV(Laughter)
p370
aVJohn, thank you for making science-fiction real.
p371
aa(lp372
VJU: It's been a great pleasure.
p373
aVThank you to you all.

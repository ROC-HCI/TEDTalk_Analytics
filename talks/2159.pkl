VSo over the past few centuries, microscopes have revolutionized our world.
p5
aVThey revealed to us a tiny world of objects, life and structures
p6
aVthat are too small for us to see with our naked eyes.
p7
aVThey are a tremendous contribution to science and technology.
p8
aVToday I'd like to introduce you to a new type of microscope,
p9
aVa microscope for changes.
p10
aVIt doesn't use optics like a regular microscope
p11
aVto make small objects bigger,
p12
aVbut instead it uses a video camera and image processing
p13
aVto reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people,
p14
aVchanges that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes.
p15
aVAnd it lets us look at our world in a completely new way.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo what do I mean by color changes?
p18
aVOur skin, for example, changes its color very slightly
p19
aVwhen the blood flows under it.
p20
aVThat change is incredibly subtle,
p21
aVwhich is why, when you look at other people,
p22
aVwhen you look at the person sitting next to you,
p23
aVyou don't see their skin or their face changing color.
p24
aVWhen we look at this video of Steve here, it appears to us like a static picture,
p25
aVbut once we look at this video through our new, special microscope,
p26
aVsuddenly we see a completely different image.
p27
aVWhat you see here are small changes in the color of Steve's skin,
p28
aVmagnified 100 times so that they become visible.
p29
aVWe can actually see a human pulse.
p30
aVWe can see how fast Steve's heart is beating,
p31
aVbut we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face.
p32
aVAnd we can do that not just to visualize the pulse,
p33
aVbut also to actually  recover our heart rates,
p34
aVand measure our heart rates.
p35
aVAnd we can do it with regular cameras and without touching the patients.
p36
aVSo here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby
p37
aVfrom a video we took with a regular DSLR camera,
p38
aVand the heart rate measurement we get
p39
aVis as accurate as the one you'd get with a standard monitor in a hospital.
p40
aVAnd it doesn't even have to be a video we recorded.
p41
aVWe can do it essentially with other videos as well.
p42
aVSo I just took a short clip from "Batman Begins" here
p43
aVjust to show Christian Bale's pulse.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVAnd you know, presumably he's wearing makeup,
p46
aVthe lighting here is kind of challenging,
p47
aVbut still, just from the video, we're able to extract his pulse
p48
aVand show it quite well.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo how do we do all that?
p51
aVWe basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded
p52
aVat every pixel in the video over time,
p53
aVand then we crank up those changes.
p54
aVWe make them bigger so that we can see them.
p55
aVThe tricky part is that those signals,
p56
aVthose changes that we're after, are extremely subtle,
p57
aVso we have to be very careful when you try to separate them
p58
aVfrom noise that always exists in videos.
p59
aVSo we use some clever image processing techniques
p60
aVto get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video,
p61
aVand then the way the color changes over time,
p62
aVand then we amplify those changes.
p63
aVWe make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos, or magnified videos,
p64
aVthat actually show us those changes.
p65
aa(lp66
VBut it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color,
p67
aVbut also tiny motions,
p68
aVand that's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras
p69
aVwill change not only if the color of the object changes,
p70
aVbut also if the object moves.
p71
aVSo this is my daughter when she was about two months old.
p72
aVIt's a video I recorded about three years ago.
p73
aVAnd as new parents, we all want to make sure our babies are healthy,
p74
aVthat they're breathing, that they're alive, of course.
p75
aVSo I too got one of those baby monitors
p76
aVso that I could see my daughter when she was asleep.
p77
aVAnd this is pretty much what you'll see with a standard baby monitor.
p78
aVYou can see the baby's sleeping, but  there's not too much information there.
p79
aVThere's not too much we can see.
p80
aVWouldn't it be better, or more informative, or more useful,
p81
aVif instead we could look at the view like this.
p82
aVSo here I took the motions and I magnified them 30 times,
p83
aVand then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVHere is a side-by-side comparison.
p86
aVSo again, in the source video, in the original video,
p87
aVthere's not too much we can see,
p88
aVbut once we magnify the motions, the breathing becomes much more visible.
p89
aVAnd it turns out, there's a lot of phenomena
p90
aVwe can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope.
p91
aVWe can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies.
p92
aVWe can see that our eyes are constantly moving
p93
aVin this wobbly motion.
p94
aVAnd that's actually my eye,
p95
aVand again this video was taken right after my daughter was born,
p96
aVso you can see I wasn't getting too much sleep. (Laughter)
p97
aVEven when a person is sitting still,
p98
aVthere's a lot of information we can extract
p99
aVabout their breathing patterns, small facial expressions.
p100
aVMaybe we could use those motions
p101
aVto tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions.
p102
aVWe can also magnify small mechanical movements,
p103
aVlike vibrations in engines,
p104
aVthat can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems,
p105
aVor see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces.
p106
aVThose are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways,
p107
aVbut measuring those motions is one thing,
p108
aVand actually seeing those motions as they happen
p109
aVis a whole different thing.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd ever since we discovered this new technology,
p112
aVwe made our code available online so that  others could use and experiment with it.
p113
aVIt's very simple to use.
p114
aVIt can work on your own videos.
p115
aVOur collaborators at Quanta Research even created this nice website
p116
aVwhere you can upload your videos and process them online,
p117
aVso even if you don't have any experience in computer science or programming,
p118
aVyou can still very easily experiment with this new microscope.
p119
aVAnd I'd like to show you just a couple of examples
p120
aVof what others have done with it.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez85.
p123
aVI don't know who that user is,
p124
aVbut he, or she, used our code
p125
aVto magnify small belly movements during pregnancy.
p126
aVIt's kind of creepy.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVPeople have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands.
p129
aVAnd you know it's not real science unless you use guinea pigs,
p130
aVand apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany,
p131
aVand this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth
p132
aVthat was motion-magnified.
p133
aa(lp134
VYou can also do some art with it.
p135
aVSo this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale.
p136
aVShe wanted to see if there's any difference
p137
aVin the way her classmates move.
p138
aVShe made them all stand still, and then magnified their motions.
p139
aVIt's like seeing  still pictures come to life.
p140
aVAnd the nice thing with  all those examples
p141
aVis that we had nothing to do with them.
p142
aVWe just provided this new tool, a new way to look at the world,
p143
aVand then people find other interesting, new and creative ways of using it.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut we didn't stop there.
p146
aVThis tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way,
p147
aVit also redefines what we can do
p148
aVand pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras.
p149
aVSo as scientists, we started wondering,
p150
aVwhat other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions
p151
aVthat we could now use our cameras to measure?
p152
aVAnd one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound.
p153
aVSound, as we all know, is basically changes
p154
aVin air pressure that travel through the air.
p155
aVThose pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them,
p156
aVwhich is how we hear and how we record sound.
p157
aVBut it turns out that sound also produces visual motions.
p158
aVThose are motions that are not visible to us
p159
aVbut are visible to a camera with the right processing.
p160
aVSo here are two examples.
p161
aVThis is me demonstrating my great singing skills.
p162
aV(Singing)
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVAnd I took a high-speed video of my throat while I was humming.
p165
aVAgain, if you stare at that video,
p166
aVthere's not too much you'll be able to see,
p167
aVbut once we magnify the motions 100 times, we can see all the motions and ripples
p168
aVin the neck that are involved in producing the sound.
p169
aVThat signal is there in that video.
p170
aa(lp171
VWe also know that singers can break a wine glass
p172
aVif they hit the correct note.
p173
aVSo here, we're going to play a note
p174
aVthat's in the resonance frequency of that glass
p175
aVthrough a loudspeaker that's next to it.
p176
aVOnce we play that note and magnify the motions 250 times,
p177
aVwe can very clearly see  how the glass vibrates
p178
aVand resonates in response to the sound.
p179
aVIt's not something you're used to seeing every day.
p180
aVBut this made us think. It gave us this crazy idea.
p181
aVCan we actually invert this process and recover sound from video
p182
aVby analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects,
p183
aVand essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them.
p184
aVIn this way, we can turn everyday objects into microphones.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo that's exactly what we did.
p187
aVSo here's an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table,
p188
aVand we're going to turn that  bag of chips into a microphone
p189
aVby filming it with a video camera
p190
aVand analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it.
p191
aVSo here's the sound that we played in the room.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd this is a high-speed video we recorded of that bag of chips.
p196
aVAgain it's playing.
p197
aVThere's no chance you'll be able to see anything going on in that video
p198
aVjust by looking at it,
p199
aVbut here's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing
p200
aVthe tiny motions in that video.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
p203
aa(lp204
VI call it \u2014 Thank you.
p205
aV(Applause)
p206
aVI call it the visual microphone.
p207
aVWe actually extract audio signals from video signals.
p208
aVAnd just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here,
p209
aVa pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer.
p210
aVThat's one thousandth of a millimeter.
p211
aVThat's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out
p212
aVjust by observing how light bounces off objects
p213
aVand gets recorded by our cameras.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe can recover sounds from other objects, like plants.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd we can recover speech as well.
p220
aVSo here's a person speaking in a room.
p221
aa(lp222
VVoice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p223
aVand everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.
p224
aa(lp225
VMichael Rubinstein: And here's that speech again recovered
p226
aVjust from this video of that same bag of chips.
p227
aa(lp228
VVoice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p229
aVand everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.
p230
aa(lp231
VMR: We used "Mary Had a Little Lamb"
p232
aVbecause those are said to be the first words
p233
aVthat Thomas Edison spoke  into his phonograph in 1877.
p234
aVIt was one of the first sound recording devices in history.
p235
aVIt basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm
p236
aVthat vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil
p237
aVthat was wrapped around the cylinder.
p238
aa(lp239
VHere's a demonstration of recording and  replaying sound with Edison's phonograph.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Video) Voice: Testing, testing, one two three.
p242
aVMary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p243
aVand everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
p244
aVTesting, testing, one two three.
p245
aVMary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p246
aVand everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
p247
aa(lp248
VMR: And now, 137 years later,
p249
aVwe're able to get sound in pretty much similar quality
p250
aVbut by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras,
p251
aVand we can even do that when the camera
p252
aVis 15 feet away from the object, behind soundproof glass.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo this is the sound that we were  able to recover in that case.
p255
aa(lp256
VVoice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p257
aVand everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
p258
aa(lp259
VMR: And of course, surveillance is the first application that comes to mind.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVBut it might actually be useful for other things as well.
p262
aVMaybe in the future, we'll be able to use it, for example,
p263
aVto recover sound across space,
p264
aVbecause sound can't travel in space, but light can.
p265
aa(lp266
VWe've only just begun exploring
p267
aVother possible uses for this new technology.
p268
aVIt lets us see physical processes that we know are there
p269
aVbut that we've never been able to see with our own eyes until now.
p270
aa(lp271
VThis is our team.
p272
aVEverything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration
p273
aVwith this great group of people you see here,
p274
aVand I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website,
p275
aVtry it out yourself,
p276
aVand join us in exploring this world of tiny motions.
p277
aa(lp278
VThank you.

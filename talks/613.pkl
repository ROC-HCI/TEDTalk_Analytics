VGood morning everybody.
p5
aVI'd like to talk about a couple of things today.
p6
aVThe first thing is water.
p7
aVNow I see you've all been enjoying the water
p8
aVthat's been provided for you here at the conference,
p9
aVover the past couple of days.
p10
aVAnd I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut what if it wasn't?
p13
aVWhat if it was from a source like this?
p14
aVThen statistics would actually say
p15
aVthat half of you would now be suffering
p16
aVwith diarrhea.
p17
aVI talked a lot in the past about statistics,
p18
aVand the provision of safe drinking water for all.
p19
aVBut they just don't seem to get through.
p20
aVAnd I think I've worked out why.
p21
aVIt's because, using current thinking,
p22
aVthe scale of the problem
p23
aVjust seems too huge to contemplate solving.
p24
aVSo we just switch off:
p25
aVus, governments and aid agencies.
p26
aVWell, today, I'd like to show you
p27
aVthat through thinking differently,
p28
aVthe problem has been solved.
p29
aVBy the way, since I've been speaking,
p30
aVanother 13,000 people around the world
p31
aVare suffering now with diarrhea.
p32
aVAnd four children have just died.
p33
aa(lp34
VI invented Lifesaver bottle
p35
aVbecause I got angry.
p36
aVI, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,
p37
aVwhen I was watching the devastating news
p38
aVof the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,
p39
aVplaying out on TV.
p40
aVThe days and weeks that followed,
p41
aVpeople fleeing to the hills,
p42
aVbeing forced to drink contaminated water
p43
aVor face death.
p44
aVThat really stuck with me.
p45
aVThen, a few months later,
p46
aVHurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.
p47
aV"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."
p48
aVDay one: nothing.
p49
aVDay two: nothing.
p50
aVDo you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?
p51
aVPeople were shooting each other on the streets
p52
aVfor TV sets and water.
p53
aVThat's when I decided I had to do something.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,
p56
aVand also in my kitchen \u2014 much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter)
p57
aVHowever, after a few failed prototypes,
p58
aVI finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.
p59
aa(lp60
VOkay, now for the science bit.
p61
aVBefore Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable
p62
aVof filtering down to about 200 nanometers.
p63
aVThe smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.
p64
aVSo a 200-nanometer bacteria
p65
aVis going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.
p66
aVThe smallest virus, on the other hand,
p67
aVis about 25 nanometers.
p68
aVSo that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.
p69
aVLifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.
p70
aVSo nothing is getting through.
p71
aa(lp72
VOkay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.
p73
aVWould you like to see that?
p74
aVI spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.
p75
aVWe're in the fine city of Oxford.
p76
aVSo \u2014 someone's done that up.
p77
aVFine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone
p78
aVand got some water from the River Cherwell,
p79
aVand the River Thames,
p80
aVthat flow through here. And this is the water.
p81
aVBut I got to thinking, you know,
p82
aVif we were in the middle of a flood zone
p83
aVin Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.
p84
aVSo I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.
p85
aVAnd this is from my pond.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.
p88
aa(lp89
VOkay. (Laughs) Right.
p90
aVWe're just going to pour that in there.
p91
aa(lp92
VAudience: Ugh!
p93
aa(lp94
VMichael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff
p95
aVfrom a sewage plant farm.
p96
aVSo I'm just going to put that in there.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVPut that in there. There we go.
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVAnd some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.
p101
aVAnd I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.
p102
aVSo we're just going to put that in there as well.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVOkay. (Laughter) Now.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe Lifesaver bottle works really simply.
p107
aVYou just scoop the water up.
p108
aVToday I'm going to use a jug
p109
aVjust to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.
p110
aVThat's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
p111
aVOkay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,
p112
aVand put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVOkay. There we go.
p115
aVReplace the top.
p116
aVGive it a few pumps. Okay?
p117
aVThat's all that's necessary.
p118
aVNow as soon as I pop the teat,
p119
aVsterile drinking water is going to come out.
p120
aVI've got to be quick. Okay, ready?
p121
aVThere we go. Mind the electrics.
p122
aVThat is safe, sterile drinking water.
p123
aV(Applause)
p124
aVCheers.
p125
aV(Applause)
p126
aVThere you go Chris.
p127
aV(Applause)
p128
aVWhat's it taste of?
p129
aa(lp130
VChris Anderson: Delicious.
p131
aa(lp132
VMichael Pritchard: Okay.
p133
aVLet's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VOkay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.
p137
aVIt'll last for 6,000 liters.
p138
aVAnd when it's expired, using failsafe technology,
p139
aVthe system will shut off, protecting the user.
p140
aVPop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.
p141
aVIt's good for another 6,000 liters.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo let's look at the applications.
p144
aVTraditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?
p145
aVWe ship water.
p146
aVThen, after a few weeks, we set up camps.
p147
aVAnd people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.
p148
aVWhat happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
p149
aVDiseases spread. More resources are required.
p150
aVThe problem just becomes self-perpetuating.
p151
aVBut by thinking differently,
p152
aVand shipping these,
p153
aVpeople can stay put.
p154
aVThey can make their own sterile drinking water,
p155
aVand start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, it doesn't require a natural disaster
p158
aVfor this to work.
p159
aVUsing the old thinking, of national infrastructure
p160
aVand pipe work, is too expensive.
p161
aVWhen you run the numbers on a calculator,
p162
aVyou run out of noughts.
p163
aVSo here is the "thinking different" bit.
p164
aa(lp165
VInstead of shipping water,
p166
aVand using man-made processes to do it,
p167
aVlet's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
p168
aVShe picks the water up from there,
p169
aVdesalinates it, for free, transports it over there,
p170
aVand dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
p171
aVAnd where do people live? Near water.
p172
aVAll we've go to do
p173
aVis make it sterile. How do we do that?
p174
aa(lp175
VWell, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.
p176
aVOr we could use one of these.
p177
aVThe same technology, in a jerry can.
p178
aVThis will process 25,000 liters of water;
p179
aVthat's good enough for a family of four,
p180
aVfor three years.
p181
aVAnd how much does it cost?
p182
aVAbout half a cent a day to run.
p183
aVThank you.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VSo, by thinking differently, and processing water
p188
aVat the point of use,
p189
aVmothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day
p190
aVto collect their water.
p191
aVThey can get it from a source nearby.
p192
aVSo with just eight billion dollars,
p193
aVwe can hit the millennium goal's target
p194
aVof halving the number of people
p195
aVwithout access to safe drinking water.
p196
aVTo put that into context,
p197
aVThe U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds
p198
aVa year on foreign aid.
p199
aVBut why stop there?
p200
aVWith 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.
p201
aVSo the three-and-a-half billion people
p202
aVthat suffer every year as a result,
p203
aVand the two million kids that die every year,
p204
aVwill live.
p205
aVThank you.

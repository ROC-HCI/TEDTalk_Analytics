VI'm going to make an argument today
p5
aVthat may seem a little bit crazy:
p6
aVsocial media and the end of gender.
p7
aVLet me connect the dots.
p8
aVI'm going to argue today
p9
aVthat the social media applications
p10
aVthat we all know and love, or love to hate,
p11
aVare actually going to help free us
p12
aVfrom some of the absurd assumptions
p13
aVthat we have as a society about gender.
p14
aVI think that social media
p15
aVis actually going to help us dismantle
p16
aVsome of the silly and demeaning stereotypes
p17
aVthat we see in media and advertising
p18
aVabout gender.
p19
aa(lp20
VIf you hadn't noticed,
p21
aVour media climate generally provides
p22
aVa very distorted mirror
p23
aVof our lives and of our gender,
p24
aVand I think that's going to change.
p25
aVNow most media companies \u2014
p26
aVtelevision, radio, publishing, games, you name it \u2014
p27
aVthey use very rigid segmentation methods
p28
aVin order to understand their audiences.
p29
aVIt's old-school demographics.
p30
aVThey come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.
p31
aVNow the crazy thing
p32
aVis that media companies believe
p33
aVthat if you fall within a certain demographic category
p34
aVthen you are predictable in certain ways \u2014
p35
aVyou have certain taste,
p36
aVthat you like certain things.
p37
aVAnd so the bizarre result of this
p38
aVis that most of our popular culture
p39
aVis actually based on these presumptions
p40
aVabout our demographics.
p41
aa(lp42
VAge demographics:
p43
aVthe 18 to 49 demo
p44
aVhas had a huge impact
p45
aVon all mass media programming in this country
p46
aVsince the 1960s,
p47
aVwhen the baby boomers were still young.
p48
aVNow they've aged out of that demographic,
p49
aVbut it's still the case
p50
aVthat powerful ratings companies like Nielson
p51
aVdon't even take into account
p52
aVviewers of television shows over age 54.
p53
aVIn our media environment,
p54
aVit's as if they don't even exist.
p55
aVNow, if you watch "Mad Men," like I do \u2014
p56
aVit's a popular TV show in the States \u2014
p57
aVDr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics,
p58
aVwhich first came about in the 1960s,
p59
aVwhere you create these complex psychological profiles
p60
aVof consumers.
p61
aVBut psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.
p62
aVIt's really just been basic demographics.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,
p65
aVand we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years
p66
aVon demographics
p67
aVand how they affect media and entertainment
p68
aVin this country and abroad.
p69
aVAnd in the last three years,
p70
aVwe've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,
p71
aVand we've discovered some very interesting things.
p72
aVAll the people who participate in social media networks
p73
aVbelong to the same old demographic categories
p74
aVthat media companies and advertisers
p75
aVhave used in order to understand them.
p76
aVBut those categories mean even less now
p77
aVthan they did before,
p78
aVbecause with online networking tools,
p79
aVit's much easier for us
p80
aVto escape some of our demographic boxes.
p81
aVWe're able to connect with people quite freely
p82
aVand to redefine ourselves online.
p83
aVAnd we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.
p84
aVWe can also connect with people
p85
aVbased on our very specific interests.
p86
aVWe don't need a media company
p87
aVto help do this for us.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo the traditional media companies, of course,
p90
aVare paying very close attention to these online communities.
p91
aVThey know this is the mass audience of the future;
p92
aVthey need to figure it out.
p93
aVBut they're having a hard time doing it
p94
aVbecause they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,
p95
aVbecause that's how ad rates are still determined.
p96
aVWhen they're monitoring your clickstream \u2014
p97
aVand you know they are \u2014
p98
aVthey have a really hard time
p99
aVfiguring out your age, your gender and your income.
p100
aVThey can make some educated guesses.
p101
aVBut they get a lot more information
p102
aVabout what you do online,
p103
aVwhat you like, what interests you.
p104
aVThat's easier for them to find out than who you are.
p105
aVAnd even though that's still sort of creepy,
p106
aVthere is an upside
p107
aVto having your taste monitored.
p108
aVSuddenly our taste is being respected
p109
aVin a way that it hasn't been before.
p110
aVIt had been presumed before.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo when you look online at the way people aggregate,
p113
aVthey don't aggregate
p114
aVaround age, gender and income.
p115
aVThey aggregate around the things they love,
p116
aVthe things that they like,
p117
aVand if you think about it, shared interests and values
p118
aVare a far more powerful aggregator of human beings
p119
aVthan demographic categories.
p120
aVI'd much rather know
p121
aVwhether you like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
p122
aVrather than how old you are.
p123
aVThat would tell me something more substantial about you.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow there's something else that we've discovered about social media
p126
aVthat's actually quite surprising.
p127
aVIt turns out that women
p128
aVare really driving the social media revolution.
p129
aVIf you look at the statistics \u2014
p130
aVthese are worldwide statistics \u2014
p131
aVin every single age category,
p132
aVwomen actually outnumber men
p133
aVin their use of social networking technologies.
p134
aVAnd then if you look at the amount of time
p135
aVthat they spend on these sites,
p136
aVthey truly dominate the social media space,
p137
aVwhich is a space that's having a huge impact
p138
aVon old media.
p139
aVThe question is: what sort of impact
p140
aVis this going to have on our culture,
p141
aVand what's it going to mean for women?
p142
aVIf the case is that social media
p143
aVis dominating old media
p144
aVand women are dominating social media,
p145
aVthen does that mean that women
p146
aVare going to take over global media?
p147
aVAre we suddenly going to see
p148
aVa lot more female characters in cartoons
p149
aVand in games and on TV shows?
p150
aVWill the next big-budget blockbuster movies
p151
aVactually be chick flicks?
p152
aVCould this be possible,
p153
aVthat suddenly our media landscape
p154
aVwill become a feminist landscape?
p155
aa(lp156
VWell, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.
p157
aVI think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,
p158
aVbecause they realize this is important for their business,
p159
aVand I think that women
p160
aVare also going to continue to dominate
p161
aVthe social media sphere.
p162
aVBut I think women are actually going to be \u2014 ironically enough \u2014
p163
aVresponsible for driving a stake through the heart
p164
aVof cheesy genre categories
p165
aVlike the "chick flick"
p166
aVand all these other genre categories
p167
aVthat presume that certain demographic groups
p168
aVlike certain things \u2014
p169
aVthat Hispanics like certain things,
p170
aVthat young people like certain things.
p171
aVThis is far too simplistic.
p172
aVThe future entertainment media that we're going to see
p173
aVis going to be very data-driven,
p174
aVand it's going to be based on the information
p175
aVthat we ascertain from taste communities online,
p176
aVwhere women are really driving the action.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo you may be asking, well why is it important
p179
aVthat I know what entertains people?
p180
aVWhy should I know this?
p181
aVOf course, old media companies and advertisers
p182
aVneed to know this.
p183
aVBut my argument is that,
p184
aVif you want to understand the global village,
p185
aVit's probably a good idea that you figure out
p186
aVwhat they're passionate about, what amuses them,
p187
aVwhat they choose to do in their free time.
p188
aVThis is a very important thing to know about people.
p189
aVI've spent most of my professional life
p190
aVresearching media and entertainment
p191
aVand its impact on people's lives.
p192
aVAnd I do it not just because it's fun \u2014
p193
aVthough actually, it is really fun \u2014
p194
aVbut also because
p195
aVour research has shown over and over again
p196
aVthat entertainment and play
p197
aVhave a huge impact on people's lives \u2014
p198
aVfor instance, on their political beliefs
p199
aVand on their health.
p200
aVAnd so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,
p201
aVlooking at how people amuse themselves
p202
aVis a really good way to start.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo imagine a media atmosphere
p205
aVthat isn't dominated by lame stereotypes
p206
aVabout gender
p207
aVand other demographic characteristics.
p208
aVCan you even imagine what that looks like?
p209
aVI can't wait to find out what it looks like.
p210
aa(lp211
VThank you so much.

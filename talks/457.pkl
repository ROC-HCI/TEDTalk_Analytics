VI want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,
p5
aVplaying with blocks.
p6
aVAs you figured out how to reach out and grasp,
p7
aVpick them up and move them around,
p8
aVyou were actually learning how to think and solve problems
p9
aVby understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.
p10
aVSpatial reasoning is deeply connected
p11
aVto how we understand a lot of the world around us.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, as a computer scientist
p14
aVinspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects \u2014
p15
aValong with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi \u2014
p16
aVI started to wonder \u2014 what if when we used a computer,
p17
aVinstead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip
p18
aVmoving around a flat desktop,
p19
aVwhat if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,
p20
aVarranging it the way we wanted?
p21
aVThis question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,
p22
aVby building Siftables.
p23
aa(lp24
VIn a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer
p25
aVthe size of a cookie.
p26
aVThey're able to be moved around by hand,
p27
aVthey can sense each other, they can sense their motion,
p28
aVand they have a screen and a wireless radio.
p29
aVMost importantly, they're physical,
p30
aVso like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.
p31
aVAnd Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem
p32
aVof tools for manipulating digital information.
p33
aVAnd as these tools become more physical,
p34
aVmore aware of their motion, aware of each other,
p35
aVand aware of the nuance of how we move them,
p36
aVwe can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.
p37
aVSo, I'm going to start with some simple examples.
p38
aa(lp39
VThis Siftable is configured to show video,
p40
aVand if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;
p41
aVif I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.
p42
aVAnd these interactive portraits are aware of each other.
p43
aVSo if I put them next to each other, they get interested.
p44
aVIf they get surrounded, they notice that too,
p45
aVthey might get a little flustered.
p46
aVAnd they can also sense their motion and tilt.
p47
aa(lp48
VOne of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,
p49
aVwas that we could use everyday gestures on data,
p50
aVlike pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.
p51
aVSo in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets
p52
aVand I can use them to pour color into that central one,
p53
aVwhere they get mixed.
p54
aVIf we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.
p55
aa(lp56
VThere are also some neat possibilities for education,
p57
aVlike language, math and logic games
p58
aVwhere we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,
p59
aVand view the results immediately.
p60
aVSo here I'm \u2014
p61
aV(Applause)
p62
aVThis is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.
p63
aa(lp64
VHere we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.
p65
aVBasically, in every round
p66
aVyou get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,
p67
aVand as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.
p68
aVThen, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,
p69
aVand you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Applause)
p72
aVThank you.
p73
aV(Applause)
p74
aa(lp75
VSo these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,
p76
aVand I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.
p77
aVThey really loved it.
p78
aVAnd, one of the interesting things about this kind of application
p79
aVis that you don't have to give people many instructions.
p80
aVAll you have to say is, "Make words,"
p81
aVand they know exactly what to do.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo here's another few people trying it out.
p84
aVThat's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.
p85
aVTurns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.
p86
aVSo to him, they were just blocks.
p87
aVNow, this is an interactive cartoon application.
p88
aVAnd we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.
p89
aVAnd this is Felix, actually.
p90
aVAnd he can bring new characters into the scene,
p91
aVjust by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.
p92
aVHere, he's bringing the sun out.
p93
aa(lp94
VVideo: The sun is rising.
p95
aa(lp96
VDavid Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.
p97
aa(lp98
VVideo: The orange tractor.
p99
aVGood job! Yeah!
p100
aa(lp101
VDM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other
p102
aVhe can make the characters interact \u2014
p103
aa(lp104
VVideo: Woof!
p105
aa(lp106
VDM: inventing his own narrative.
p107
aa(lp108
VVideo: Hello!
p109
aa(lp110
VDM: It's an open-ended story,
p111
aVand he gets to decide how it unfolds.
p112
aa(lp113
VVideo: Fly away, cat.
p114
aa(lp115
VDM: So, the last example I have time to show you today
p116
aVis a music sequencing and live performance tool
p117
aVthat we've built recently,
p118
aVin which Siftables act as sounds
p119
aVlike lead, bass and drums.
p120
aVEach of these has four different variations,
p121
aVyou get to choose which one you want to use.
p122
aVAnd you can inject these sounds into a sequence
p123
aVthat you can assemble into the pattern that you want.
p124
aVAnd you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.
p125
aVThere are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.
p126
aVYou attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.
p127
aVAnd then, overall effects like tempo and volume
p128
aVthat apply to the entire sequence.
p129
aVSo let's have a look.
p130
aa(lp131
VVideo: (Music)
p132
aa(lp133
VDM: We'll start by putting a lead
p134
aVinto two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,
p135
aVextend it, add a little more lead.
p136
aVNow I put a bass line in.
p137
aa(lp138
VVideo: (Music)
p139
aVDM: Now I'll put some percussion in.
p140
aVVideo: (Music)
p141
aa(lp142
VDM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.
p143
aa(lp144
VVideo: (Music)
p145
aa(lp146
VDM: I can speed up the whole sequence
p147
aVby tilting the tempo one way or the other.
p148
aa(lp149
VVideo: (Music)
p150
aa(lp151
VDM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.
p152
aa(lp153
VVideo: (Music)
p154
aa(lp155
VDM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.
p156
aVSo I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,
p157
aVmaking it longer or shorter as I go.
p158
aVAnd now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out
p159
aVusing the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Applause)
p162
aVThank you.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo, as you can see,
p165
aVmy passion is for making new human-computer interfaces
p166
aVthat are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.
p167
aVAnd today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,
p168
aVand a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.
p169
aVSo the thought I want to leave you with
p170
aVis that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools
p171
aVfor interacting with digital media
p172
aVthat are going to bring information into our world
p173
aVon our terms.
p174
aVThank you very much.
p175
aVI look forward to talking with all of you.

VWe are built out of very small stuff,
p5
aVand we are embedded in a very large cosmos,
p6
aVand the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality
p7
aVat either of those scales,
p8
aVand that's because our brains
p9
aVhaven't evolved to understand  the world at that scale.
p10
aa(lp11
VInstead, we're trapped on this very thin slice of perception
p12
aVright in the middle.
p13
aVBut it gets strange, because even at  that slice of reality that we call home,
p14
aVwe're not seeing most of the action that's going on.
p15
aVSo take the colors of our world.
p16
aVThis is light waves, electromagnetic radiation that bounces off objects
p17
aVand it hits specialized receptors in the back of our eyes.
p18
aVBut we're not seeing all the waves out there.
p19
aVIn fact, what we see
p20
aVis less than a 10 trillionth of what's out there.
p21
aVSo you have radio waves and microwaves
p22
aVand X-rays and gamma rays passing through your body right now
p23
aVand you're completely unaware of it,
p24
aVbecause you don't come with the proper biological receptors
p25
aVfor picking it up.
p26
aVThere are thousands of cell phone conversations
p27
aVpassing through you right now,
p28
aVand you're utterly blind to it.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, it's not that these things are inherently unseeable.
p31
aVSnakes include some infrared in their reality,
p32
aVand honeybees include ultraviolet in their view of the world,
p33
aVand of course we build machines in the dashboards of our cars
p34
aVto pick up on signals in the radio frequency range,
p35
aVand we built machines in hospitals to pick up on the X-ray range.
p36
aVBut you can't sense any of those by yourself,
p37
aVat least not yet,
p38
aVbecause you don't come equipped with the proper sensors.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, what this means is that our experience of reality
p41
aVis constrained by our biology,
p42
aVand that goes against the common sense notion
p43
aVthat our eyes and our ears and our fingertips
p44
aVare just picking up the objective reality that's out there.
p45
aVInstead, our brains are sampling just a little bit of the world.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, across the animal kingdom,
p48
aVdifferent animals pick up on different parts of reality.
p49
aVSo in the blind and deaf world of the tick,
p50
aVthe important signals are temperature and butyric acid;
p51
aVin the world of the black ghost knifefish,
p52
aVits sensory world is lavishly colored by electrical fields;
p53
aVand for the echolocating bat,
p54
aVits reality is constructed out of air compression waves.
p55
aVThat's the slice of their ecosystem that they can pick up on,
p56
aVand we have a word for this in science.
p57
aVIt's called the umwelt,
p58
aVwhich is the German word for the surrounding world.
p59
aVNow, presumably, every animal assumes
p60
aVthat its umwelt is the entire objective reality out there,
p61
aVbecause why would you ever stop to imagine
p62
aVthat there's something beyond what we can sense.
p63
aVInstead, what we all do is we accept reality
p64
aVas it's presented to us.
p65
aa(lp66
VLet's do a consciousness-raiser on this.
p67
aVImagine that you are a bloodhound dog.
p68
aVYour whole world is about smelling.
p69
aVYou've got a long snout that has 200 million scent receptors in it,
p70
aVand you have wet nostrils that attract and trap scent molecules,
p71
aVand your nostrils even have slits so you can take big nosefuls of air.
p72
aVEverything is about smell for you.
p73
aVSo one day, you stop in your tracks with a revelation.
p74
aVYou look at your human owner and you think,
p75
aV"What is it like to have the pitiful, impoverished nose of a human?
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVWhat is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air?
p78
aVHow can you not know that there's a cat 100 yards away,
p79
aVor that your neighbor was on this very spot six hours ago?"
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VSo because we're humans,
p83
aVwe've never experienced that world of smell,
p84
aVso we don't miss it,
p85
aVbecause we are firmly settled into our umwelt.
p86
aVBut the question is, do we have to be stuck there?
p87
aVSo as a neuroscientist, I'm interested in the way that technology
p88
aVmight expand our umwelt,
p89
aVand how that's going to change the experience of being human.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo we already know that we can marry our technology to our biology,
p92
aVbecause there are hundreds of thousands of people walking around
p93
aVwith artificial hearing and artificial vision.
p94
aVSo the way this works is, you take a microphone and you digitize the signal,
p95
aVand you put an electrode strip directly into the inner ear.
p96
aVOr, with the retinal implant, you take a camera
p97
aVand you digitize the signal, and then you plug an electrode grid
p98
aVdirectly into the optic nerve.
p99
aVAnd as recently as 15 years ago,
p100
aVthere were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn't work.
p101
aVWhy? It's because these technologies speak the language of Silicon Valley,
p102
aVand it's not exactly the same dialect as our natural biological sense organs.
p103
aVBut the fact is that it works;
p104
aVthe brain figures out how to use the signals just fine.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow, how do we understand that?
p107
aVWell, here's the big secret:
p108
aVYour brain is not hearing or seeing any of this.
p109
aVYour brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull.
p110
aVAll it ever sees are electrochemical signals
p111
aVthat come in along different data cables,
p112
aVand this is all it has to work with, and nothing more.
p113
aVNow, amazingly,
p114
aVthe brain is really good at taking in these signals
p115
aVand extracting patterns and assigning meaning,
p116
aVso that it takes this inner cosmos and puts together a story
p117
aVof this, your subjective world.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut here's the key point:
p120
aVYour brain doesn't know, and it doesn't care,
p121
aVwhere it gets the data from.
p122
aVWhatever information comes in, it just figures out what to do with it.
p123
aVAnd this is a very efficient kind of machine.
p124
aVIt's essentially a general purpose computing device,
p125
aVand it just takes in everything
p126
aVand figures out what it's going to do with it,
p127
aVand that, I think, frees up Mother Nature
p128
aVto tinker around with different sorts of input channels.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo I call this the P.H.  model of evolution,
p131
aVand I don't want to get too technical here,
p132
aVbut P.H. stands for Potato Head,
p133
aVand I use this name to emphasize that all these sensors
p134
aVthat we know and love, like our eyes and our ears and our fingertips,
p135
aVthese are merely peripheral plug-and-play devices:
p136
aVYou stick them in, and you're good to go.
p137
aVThe brain figures out what to do with the data that comes in.
p138
aVAnd when you look across the animal kingdom,
p139
aVyou find lots of peripheral devices.
p140
aVSo snakes have heat pits with which to detect infrared,
p141
aVand the ghost knifefish has electroreceptors,
p142
aVand the star-nosed mole has this appendage
p143
aVwith 22 fingers on it
p144
aVwith which it feels around and constructs a 3D model of the world,
p145
aVand many birds have magnetite so they can orient
p146
aVto the magnetic field of the planet.
p147
aVSo what this means is that nature doesn't have to continually
p148
aVredesign the brain.
p149
aVInstead, with the principles of brain operation established,
p150
aVall nature has to worry about is designing new peripherals.
p151
aa(lp152
VOkay. So what this means is this:
p153
aVThe lesson that surfaces
p154
aVis that there's nothing really special or fundamental
p155
aVabout the biology that we come to the table with.
p156
aVIt's just what we have inherited
p157
aVfrom a complex road of evolution.
p158
aVBut it's not what we have to stick with,
p159
aVand our best proof of principle of this
p160
aVcomes from what's called sensory substitution.
p161
aVAnd that refers to feeding information into the brain
p162
aVvia unusual sensory channels,
p163
aVand the brain just figures out what to do with it.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, that might sound speculative,
p166
aVbut the first paper demonstrating this was published in the journal Nature in 1969.
p167
aVSo a scientist named Paul Bach-y-Rita
p168
aVput blind people in a modified dental chair,
p169
aVand he set up a video feed,
p170
aVand he put something in front of the camera,
p171
aVand then you would feel that
p172
aVpoked into your back with a grid of solenoids.
p173
aVSo if you wiggle a coffee cup in front of the camera,
p174
aVyou're feeling that in your back,
p175
aVand amazingly, blind people got pretty good
p176
aVat being able to determine what was in front of the camera
p177
aVjust by feeling it in the small of their back.
p178
aVNow, there have been many modern incarnations of this.
p179
aVThe sonic glasses take a video feed right in front of you
p180
aVand turn that into a sonic landscape,
p181
aVso as things move around, and get closer and farther,
p182
aVit sounds like "Bzz, bzz, bzz."
p183
aVIt sounds like a cacophony,
p184
aVbut after several weeks, blind people start getting pretty good
p185
aVat understanding what's in front of them
p186
aVjust based on what they're hearing.
p187
aVAnd it doesn't have to be through the ears:
p188
aVthis system uses an electrotactile grid on the forehead,
p189
aVso whatever's in front of the video feed, you're feeling it on your forehead.
p190
aVWhy the forehead? Because you're not using it for much else.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe most modern incarnation is called the brainport,
p193
aVand this is a little electrogrid that sits on your tongue,
p194
aVand the video feed gets turned into these little electrotactile signals,
p195
aVand blind people get so good at using this that they can throw a ball into a basket,
p196
aVor they can navigate complex obstacle courses.
p197
aVThey can come to see through their tongue.
p198
aVNow, that sounds completely insane, right?
p199
aVBut remember, all vision ever is
p200
aVis electrochemical signals coursing around in your brain.
p201
aVYour brain doesn't know where the signals come from.
p202
aVIt just figures out what to do with them.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo my interest in my lab is sensory substitution for the deaf,
p205
aVand this is a project I've undertaken
p206
aVwith a graduate student in my lab, Scott Novich,
p207
aVwho is spearheading this for his thesis.
p208
aVAnd here is what we wanted to do:
p209
aVwe wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted
p210
aVin some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said.
p211
aVAnd we wanted to do this, given the power and ubiquity of portable computing,
p212
aVwe wanted to make sure that this would run on cell phones and tablets,
p213
aVand also we wanted to make this a wearable,
p214
aVsomething that you could wear under your clothing.
p215
aVSo here's the concept.
p216
aVSo as I'm speaking, my sound is getting captured by the tablet,
p217
aVand then it's getting mapped onto a vest that's covered in vibratory motors,
p218
aVjust like the motors in your cell phone.
p219
aVSo as I'm speaking,
p220
aVthe sound is getting translated to a pattern of vibration on the vest.
p221
aVNow, this is not just conceptual:
p222
aVthis tablet is transmitting Bluetooth, and I'm wearing the vest right now.
p223
aVSo as I'm speaking \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p224
aVthe sound is getting translated into dynamic patterns of vibration.
p225
aVI'm feeling the sonic world around me.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo, we've been testing this with deaf people now,
p228
aVand it turns out that after just a little bit of time,
p229
aVpeople can start feeling, they can start understanding
p230
aVthe language of the vest.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo this is Jonathan. He's 37 years old. He has a master's degree.
p233
aVHe was born profoundly deaf,
p234
aVwhich means that there's a part of his umwelt that's unavailable to him.
p235
aVSo we had Jonathan train with the vest for four days, two hours a day,
p236
aVand here he is on the fifth day.
p237
aa(lp238
VScott Novich: You.
p239
aa(lp240
VDavid Eagleman: So Scott says a word, Jonathan feels it on the vest,
p241
aVand he writes it on the board.
p242
aa(lp243
VSN: Where. Where.
p244
aa(lp245
VDE: Jonathan is able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations
p246
aVinto an understanding of what's being said.
p247
aa(lp248
VSN: Touch. Touch.
p249
aa(lp250
VDE: Now, he's not doing this \u2014
p251
aV(Applause) \u2014
p252
aVJonathan is not doing this consciously, because the patterns are too complicated,
p253
aVbut his brain is starting to unlock the pattern that allows it to figure out
p254
aVwhat the data mean,
p255
aVand our expectation is that, after wearing this for about three months,
p256
aVhe will have a direct perceptual experience of hearing
p257
aVin the same way that when a blind person passes a finger over braille,
p258
aVthe meaning comes directly off the page without any conscious intervention at all.
p259
aVNow, this technology has the potential to be a game-changer,
p260
aVbecause the only other solution for deafness is a cochlear implant,
p261
aVand that requires an invasive surgery.
p262
aVAnd this can be built for 40 times cheaper than a cochlear implant,
p263
aVwhich opens up this technology globally, even for the poorest countries.
p264
aa(lp265
VNow, we've been very encouraged by our results with sensory substitution,
p266
aVbut what we've been thinking a lot about is sensory addition.
p267
aVHow could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense,
p268
aVto expand the human umvelt?
p269
aVFor example, could we feed real-time data from the Internet
p270
aVdirectly into somebody's brain,
p271
aVand can they develop a direct perceptual experience?
p272
aa(lp273
VSo here's an experiment we're doing in the lab.
p274
aVA subject is feeling a real-time streaming feed from the Net of data
p275
aVfor five seconds.
p276
aVThen, two buttons appear, and he has to make a choice.
p277
aVHe doesn't know what's going on.
p278
aVHe makes a choice, and he gets feedback after one second.
p279
aVNow, here's the thing:
p280
aVThe subject has no idea what all the patterns mean,
p281
aVbut we're seeing if he gets better at figuring out which button to press.
p282
aVHe doesn't know that what we're feeding
p283
aVis real-time data from the stock market,
p284
aVand he's making buy and sell decisions.
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aVAnd the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not.
p287
aVAnd what we're seeing is, can we expand the human umvelt
p288
aVso that he comes to have, after several weeks,
p289
aVa direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet.
p290
aVSo we'll report on that later to see how well this goes.
p291
aV(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VHere's another thing we're doing:
p294
aVDuring the talks this morning, we've been automatically scraping Twitter
p295
aVfor the TED2015 hashtag,
p296
aVand we've been doing an automated sentiment analysis,
p297
aVwhich means, are people using positive words or negative words or neutral?
p298
aVAnd while this has been going on,
p299
aVI have been feeling this,
p300
aVand so I am plugged in to the aggregate emotion
p301
aVof thousands of people in real time,
p302
aVand that's a new kind of human experience, because now I can know
p303
aVhow everyone's doing and how much you're loving this.
p304
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p305
aVIt's a bigger experience than a human can normally have.
p306
aa(lp307
VWe're also expanding the umvelt of pilots.
p308
aVSo in this case, the vest is streaming nine different measures
p309
aVfrom this quadcopter,
p310
aVso pitch and yaw and roll and orientation and heading,
p311
aVand that improves this pilot's ability to fly it.
p312
aVIt's essentially like he's extending his skin up there, far away.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd that's just the beginning.
p315
aVWhat we're envisioning is taking a modern cockpit full of gauges
p316
aVand instead of trying to read the whole thing, you feel it.
p317
aVWe live in a world of information now,
p318
aVand there is a difference between accessing big data
p319
aVand experiencing it.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo I think there's really no end to the possibilities
p322
aVon the horizon for human expansion.
p323
aVJust imagine an astronaut being able to feel
p324
aVthe overall health of the International Space Station,
p325
aVor, for that matter, having you feel the invisible states of your own health,
p326
aVlike your blood sugar and the state of your microbiome,
p327
aVor having 360-degree vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo the key is this: As we move into the future,
p330
aVwe're going to increasingly be able to choose our own peripheral devices.
p331
aVWe no longer have to wait for Mother Nature's sensory gifts
p332
aVon her timescales,
p333
aVbut instead, like any good parent, she's given us the tools that we need
p334
aVto go out and define our own trajectory.
p335
aVSo the question now is,
p336
aVhow do you want to go out and experience your universe?
p337
aa(lp338
VThank you.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Applause)
p341
aa(lp342
VChris Anderson: Can you feel it? DE: Yeah.
p343
aa(lp344
VActually, this was the first time I felt applause on the vest.
p345
aVIt's nice. It's like a massage. (Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VCA: Twitter's going crazy. Twitter's going mad.
p348
aVSo that stock market experiment.
p349
aVThis could be the first experiment that secures its funding forevermore,
p350
aVright, if successful?
p351
aa(lp352
VDE: Well, that's right, I wouldn't have to write to NIH anymore.
p353
aa(lp354
VCA: Well look, just to be skeptical for a minute,
p355
aVI mean, this is amazing, but isn't most of the evidence so far
p356
aVthat sensory substitution works,
p357
aVnot necessarily  that sensory addition works?
p358
aVI mean, isn't it possible that the blind person can see through their tongue
p359
aVbecause the visual cortex is still there, ready to process,
p360
aVand that that is needed as part of it?
p361
aa(lp362
VDE: That's a great question. We actually have no idea
p363
aVwhat the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in.
p364
aVThe general story, though, is that it's extraordinarily flexible.
p365
aVSo when a person goes blind, what we used to call their visual cortex
p366
aVgets taken over by other things, by touch, by hearing, by vocabulary.
p367
aVSo what that tells us is that the cortex is kind of a one-trick pony.
p368
aVIt just runs certain kinds of computations on things.
p369
aVAnd when we look around at things like braille, for example,
p370
aVpeople are getting information through bumps on their fingers.
p371
aVSo I don't think we have any reason to think there's a theoretical limit
p372
aVthat we know the edge of.
p373
aa(lp374
VCA: If this checks out, you're going to be deluged.
p375
aVThere are so many possible applications for this.
p376
aVAre you ready for this? What are you most excited about, the direction it might go?
p377
aVDE: I mean, I think there's a lot of applications here.
p378
aVIn terms of beyond sensory substitution, the things I started mentioning
p379
aVabout astronauts on the space station, they spend a lot of their time
p380
aVmonitoring things, and they could instead just get what's going on,
p381
aVbecause what this is really good for is multidimensional data.
p382
aVThe key is this: Our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges,
p383
aVbut they're really bad at what our world has become,
p384
aVwhich is screens with lots and lots of data.
p385
aVWe have to crawl that with our attentional systems.
p386
aVSo this is a way of just feeling the state of something,
p387
aVjust like the way you know the state of your body as you're standing around.
p388
aVSo I think heavy machinery, safety, feeling the state of a factory,
p389
aVof your equipment, that's one place it'll go right away.
p390
aa(lp391
VCA: David Eagleman, that was one mind-blowing talk. Thank you very much.
p392
aa(lp393

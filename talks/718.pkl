VThe key question is, "When are we going to get fusion?"
p5
aVIt's really been a long time since we've known about fusion.
p6
aVWe've known about fusion since 1920,
p7
aVwhen Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington
p8
aVand the British Association for the Advancement of Science
p9
aVconjectured that that's why the sun shines.
p10
aa(lp11
VI've always been very worried about resource.
p12
aVI don't know about you, but
p13
aVwhen my mother gave me food,
p14
aVI always sorted the ones I disliked
p15
aVfrom the ones I liked.
p16
aVAnd I ate the disliked ones first,
p17
aVbecause the ones you like, you want to save.
p18
aVAnd as a child you're always worried about resource.
p19
aVAnd once it was sort of explained to me
p20
aVhow fast we were using up the world's resources,
p21
aVI got very upset,
p22
aVabout as upset as I did when I realized
p23
aVthat the Earth will only last about five billion years
p24
aVbefore it's swallowed by the sun.
p25
aVBig events in my life,
p26
aVa strange child.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VEnergy, at the moment, is dominated by resource.
p30
aVThe countries that make a lot of money out of energy
p31
aVhave something underneath them.
p32
aVCoal-powered industrial revolution in this country \u2014
p33
aVoil, gas, sorry.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVGas, I'm probably the only person
p36
aVwho really enjoys it when Mister Putin
p37
aVturns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up.
p38
aa(lp39
VWe're really dominated now
p40
aVby those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster.
p41
aVAnd as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty
p42
aVin the Third World, in the developing world,
p43
aVwe're using energy faster and faster.
p44
aVAnd those resources are going away.
p45
aVAnd the way we'll make energy in the future
p46
aVis not from resource,
p47
aVit's really from knowledge.
p48
aVIf you look 50 years into the future,
p49
aVthe way we probably will be making energy
p50
aVis probably one of these three,
p51
aVwith some wind, with some other things,
p52
aVbut these are going to be the base load energy drivers.
p53
aa(lp54
VSolar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar.
p55
aVBut we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar
p56
aVthe base load energy supply for the world.
p57
aVFission.
p58
aVOur government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations.
p59
aVThey're going to put in six new nuclear power stations,
p60
aVand probably more after that.
p61
aVChina is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is.
p62
aVBecause they know that that is one sure way
p63
aVto do carbon-free energy.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is,
p66
aVthe perfect energy source is one
p67
aVthat doesn't take up much space,
p68
aVhas a virtually inexhaustible supply,
p69
aVis safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere,
p70
aVdoesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste:
p71
aVit's fusion.
p72
aVBut there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases.
p73
aVFusion is very hard to do.
p74
aVWe've been trying for 50 years.
p75
aa(lp76
VOkay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics.
p77
aVAnd sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVI was a strange child.
p80
aVNuclear energy comes for a simple reason.
p81
aVThe most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.
p82
aVIt's a medium-sized nucleus.
p83
aVAnd you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.
p84
aVSo, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.
p85
aVBut small atoms want to join together,
p86
aVsmall nuclei want to join together
p87
aVto make bigger ones to go towards iron.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd you can get energy out this way.
p90
aVAnd indeed that's exactly what stars do.
p91
aVIn the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium
p92
aVand then helium together to make carbon,
p93
aVto make oxygen, all the things that you're made of
p94
aVare made in the middle of stars.
p95
aVBut it's a hard process to do
p96
aVbecause, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot,
p97
aValmost by definition.
p98
aVAnd there is one reaction
p99
aVthat's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.
p100
aVIt's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen:
p101
aVdeuterium, which is heavy hydrogen,
p102
aVwhich you can get from seawater,
p103
aVand tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.
p104
aa(lp105
VThese two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged.
p106
aVAnd you push them together and they repel.
p107
aVBut when you get them close enough,
p108
aVsomething called the strong force starts to act
p109
aVand pulls them together.
p110
aVSo, most of the time they repel.
p111
aVYou get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point
p112
aVthe strong force grips them together.
p113
aVFor a moment they become helium 5,
p114
aVbecause they've got five particles inside them.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together
p117
aVmakes helium 5.
p118
aVHelium splits out, and a neutron comes out
p119
aVand lots of energy comes out.
p120
aVIf you can get something to about 150 million degrees,
p121
aVthings will be rattling around so fast
p122
aVthat every time they collide in just the right configuration,
p123
aVthis will happen, and it will release energy.
p124
aVAnd that energy is what powers fusion.
p125
aVAnd it's this reaction that we want to do.
p126
aa(lp127
VThere is one trickiness about this reaction.
p128
aVWell, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees,
p129
aVbut there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.
p130
aVIt's pretty hot.
p131
aVThe trickiness about the reaction is that
p132
aVtritium doesn't exist in nature.
p133
aVYou have to make it from something else.
p134
aVAnd you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom,
p135
aVthat's lithium 6, plus a neutron,
p136
aVwill give you more helium, plus tritium.
p137
aVAnd that's the way you make your tritium.
p138
aVBut fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction,
p139
aVyou've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, why the hell would we bother to do this?
p142
aVThis is basically why we would bother to do it.
p143
aVIf you just plot how much fuel
p144
aVwe've got left, in units of
p145
aVpresent world consumption.
p146
aVAnd as you go across there you see
p147
aVa few tens of years of oil \u2014 the blue line, by the way,
p148
aVis the lowest estimate of existing resources.
p149
aVAnd the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd as you go across there you will see
p152
aVthat we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years
p153
aVof fossil fuels left.
p154
aVAnd god knows we don't really want to burn all of it,
p155
aVbecause it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.
p156
aVAnd then we get to uranium.
p157
aVAnd with current reactor technology
p158
aVwe really don't have very much uranium.
p159
aVAnd we will have to extract uranium from sea water,
p160
aVwhich is the yellow line,
p161
aVto make conventional nuclear power stations
p162
aVactually do very much for us.
p163
aVThis is a bit shocking, because in fact our government
p164
aVis relying on that for us to meet Kyoto,
p165
aVand do all those kind of things.
p166
aa(lp167
VTo go any further you would have to have breeder technology.
p168
aVAnd breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous.
p169
aVThe big thing, on the right,
p170
aVis the lithium we have in the world.
p171
aVAnd lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.
p172
aVAnd we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.
p173
aVEverybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.
p174
aVIs it cost-competitive?
p175
aVWe make estimates of what we think it would cost
p176
aVto actually make a fusion power plant.
p177
aVAnd we get within about the same price
p178
aVas current electricity.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo, how would we make it?
p181
aVWe have to hold something at 150 million degrees.
p182
aVAnd, in fact, we've done this.
p183
aVWe hold it with a magnetic field.
p184
aVAnd inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape,
p185
aVright in the middle is 150 million degrees.
p186
aVIt boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.
p187
aVAnd in fact we can make fusion happen.
p188
aVAnd just down the road, this is JET.
p189
aVIt's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.
p190
aa(lp191
VWhen people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be,
p192
aVI say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?
p193
aVWe can do fusion. In the center of this device
p194
aVwe made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.
p195
aVAnd in 2013 we're going to fire it up again
p196
aVand break all those records.
p197
aVBut that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen.
p198
aVWe've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.
p199
aVBecause we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.
p200
aVThis is the device we're building now.
p201
aa(lp202
VIt gets very expensive to do this research.
p203
aVIt turns out you can't do fusion on a table top
p204
aVdespite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right?
p205
aVYou can't. You have to do it in a very big device.
p206
aVMore than half the world's population is involved in building this device
p207
aVin southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.
p208
aVSeven nations are involved in building this.
p209
aVIt's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.
p210
aVBut that's not electricity yet.
p211
aVWe have to get to this.
p212
aVWe have to get to a power plant.
p213
aVWe have to start putting electricity on the grid
p214
aVin this very complex technology.
p215
aVAnd I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.
p216
aVBut at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.
p217
aa(lp218
VI wish this were different. We really need it now.
p219
aVWe're going to have a problem with power
p220
aVin the next five years in this country.
p221
aVSo 2030 looks like an infinity away.
p222
aVBut we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward,
p223
aVget fusion to happen.
p224
aVI wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.
p225
aVBut this is what we're aiming at,
p226
aVsometime in the 2030s \u2014
p227
aVreal electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.
p228
aV(Applause)

cheap, nearly limitless carbon-free energy.</strong> <br /><br />Fusion (the process by which lightweight atoms under pressure are fused to form heavier atoms, releasing energy) has long been the Holy Grail of renewable energy, but at the moment it only occurs in the cores of stars. Yet Cowley isn&#39;t too shy to proclaim that harnessing its power on an Earthly scale is now inevitable. At UCLA, he made observations on some of the most violent phenomena in the local universe -- solar flares, storms in the Earth&#39;s magnetosphere --&nbsp; and now his research is coming directly into play as he plans devices that, theoretically, would contain 100-million-degree gas using powerful magnetic fields.</p>", "slug": "steven_cowley", "whotheyare": "Steven Cowley directs the UK\'s leading fusion research center.

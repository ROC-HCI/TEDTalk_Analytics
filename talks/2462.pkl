VIt began with one question:
p5
aVIf Africa was a bar, what would your country be drinking or doing?
p6
aVI kicked it off with a guess about South Africa,
p7
aVwhich wasn't exactly according to the rules
p8
aVbecause South Africa's not my country.
p9
aVBut alluding to the country's continual attempts
p10
aVto build a postracial society
p11
aVafter being ravaged for decades by apartheid,
p12
aVI tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol
p13
aVand begging them to get along in its stomach.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd then I waited.
p16
aVAnd then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line.
p17
aVSo, I sent out a few other tweets about my own country
p18
aVand a few other African countries I'm familiar with.
p19
aVAnd then I waited again,
p20
aVbut this time
p21
aVI read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted
p22
aVto convince myself,
p23
aVno, to remind myself that I'm really funny
p24
aVand that if nobody gets it, that's fine.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut luckily,
p27
aVI didn't have to do that for very long.
p28
aVVery soon, people were participating.
p29
aVIn fact, by the end of that week in July,
p30
aVthe hashtag #ifafricawasabar
p31
aVwould have garnered around 60,000 tweets,
p32
aVlit up the continent
p33
aVand made its way to publications all over the world.
p34
aa(lp35
VPeople were using the hashtag to do many different things.
p36
aVTo poke fun at their stereotypes:
p37
aV[#IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining
p38
aVthat he will pay the entrance fee,
p39
aVall he needs is the bouncer's account details.]
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VTo criticize government spending:
p44
aV[#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce
p45
aVrunning a tab it won't be able to pay]
p46
aa(lp47
VTo make light of geopolitical tensions:
p48
aV[#IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy
p49
aVwith serious anger management issues.]
p50
aa(lp51
VTo remind us that even in Africa
p52
aVthere are some countries we don't know exist:
p53
aV[#IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person
p54
aVwho nobody really knows but is always in the pictures.]
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa:
p57
aV[#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco
p58
aVbe like "What the hell are we doing here?!!"]
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd to note the countries that had made a big turnaround:
p63
aV[#ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl
p64
aVthat comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk, happy and rich]
p65
aa(lp66
VBut most importantly,
p67
aVpeople were using the hashtag to connect.
p68
aVPeople were connecting over their Africanness.
p69
aVSo for one week in July,
p70
aVTwitter became a real African bar.
p71
aVAnd I was really thrilled,
p72
aVmainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work,
p73
aVthat we had before us, between us, at our fingertips
p74
aVa platform that just needed a small spark
p75
aVto light in us a hunger for each other.
p76
aa(lp77
VMy name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa,
p78
aVI'm 22 years old
p79
aVand I am Pan-Africanist by birth.
p80
aVNow, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth
p81
aVbecause my parents are from two different African countries.
p82
aVMy father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa.
p83
aVIt's only slightly bigger than Germany.
p84
aVThis year we celebrate our 50th year of stable democracy.
p85
aVAnd it has some very progressive social policies.
p86
aVMy mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland.
p87
aVIt's a very, very small country, also in southern Africa.
p88
aVIt is Africa's last complete monarchy.
p89
aVSo it's been ruled by a king and a royal family
p90
aVin line with their tradition,
p91
aVfor a very long time.
p92
aa(lp93
VOn paper, these countries seem very different.
p94
aVAnd when I was a kid, I could see the difference.
p95
aVIt rained a lot in one country, it didn't rain quite as much in the other.
p96
aVBut outside of that, I didn't really realize
p97
aVwhy it mattered that my parents were from two different places.
p98
aVBut it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me.
p99
aVYou see, I was born in one country
p100
aVand raised in the other.
p101
aa(lp102
VWhen we moved to Botswana,
p103
aVI was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati
p104
aVand nothing else.
p105
aVSo I was being introduced to my new home,
p106
aVmy new cultural identity,
p107
aVas a complete outsider,
p108
aVincapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me
p109
aVby the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward.
p110
aVBut very soon, I would shed SiSwati.
p111
aVAnd when I would go back to Swaziland,
p112
aVI would be constantly confronted by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.
p113
aa(lp114
VAdd to that my entry into Africa's private school system,
p115
aVwhose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you,
p116
aVand I would have a very peculiar adolescence.
p117
aVBut I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here,
p118
aVin the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once
p119
aVbut not really belonging to either one very well
p120
aVand belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously.
p121
aVI became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity.
p122
aa(lp123
VSince then, I have continued to read about politics
p124
aVand geography and identity and what all those things mean.
p125
aVI've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies.
p126
aVWhen I began to read,
p127
aVI gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals
p128
aVlike Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,
p129
aVwho tackled complex ideas
p130
aVlike decolonization and black consciousness.
p131
aVAnd when I thought, at 14, that I had digested these grand ideas,
p132
aVI moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen
p133
aVlike Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara
p134
aVand Congo's Patrice Lumumba.
p135
aVI read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo when Twitter came,
p138
aVI hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl
p139
aVwhose friends are super, super bored of hearing about all this random stuff.
p140
aa(lp141
VThe year was 2011
p142
aVand all over southern Africa and the whole continent,
p143
aVaffordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing
p144
aVbecame much easier to get.
p145
aVSo my generation, we were sending messages to each other on this platform
p146
aVthat just needed 140 characters and a little bit of creativity.
p147
aVOn long commutes to work,
p148
aVin lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to,
p149
aVon our lunch breaks,
p150
aVwe would communicate as much as we could
p151
aVabout the everyday realities of being young and African.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut of course, this luxury was not available to everybody.
p154
aVSo this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana
p155
aVand you wanted to have fun on the Internet,
p156
aVone, you had to tweet in English.
p157
aVTwo, you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online.
p158
aVYou had to follow South Africans, Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.
p159
aVAnd suddenly, your whole world opened up.
p160
aVAnd my whole world did open up.
p161
aa(lp162
VI followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent,
p163
aVtaking pictures of themselves
p164
aVand posting them under the hashtag #myafrica.
p165
aVBecause at that time,
p166
aVif you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google
p167
aVor any kind of social media,
p168
aVyou would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals
p169
aVand white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VBut Africans were using this platform
p174
aVto take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors.
p175
aVIt was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria.
p176
aVIt was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd these were the same Africans that I began to meet
p179
aVin my own travels around the continent.
p180
aVWe would discuss African literature, politics, economic policy.
p181
aVBut almost invariably, every single time,
p182
aVwe would end up discussing Twitter.
p183
aVAnd that's when I realized what this was.
p184
aVWe were standing in the middle of something amazing,
p185
aVbecause for the first time ever
p186
aVyoung Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time,
p187
aVwithout the restriction of borders, finances and watchful governments.
p188
aa(lp189
VBecause the little known truth is
p190
aVmany Africans know a lot less about other African countries
p191
aVthan some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole.
p192
aVThis is by accident,
p193
aVbut sometimes, it's by design.
p194
aVFor example, in apartheid South Africa,
p195
aVblack South Africans were constantly being bombarded
p196
aVwith this message that any country ruled by black people
p197
aVwas destined for failure.
p198
aVAnd this was done to convince them
p199
aVthat they were much better off under crushing white rule
p200
aVthan they were living in a black and free nation.
p201
aVAdd to that Africa's colonial, archaic education system,
p202
aVwhich has been unthinkingly carried over from the 1920s \u2014
p203
aVand at the age of 15, I could name all the various causes
p204
aVof the wars that had happened in Europe in the past 200 years,
p205
aVbut I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country.
p206
aVAnd to me, this doesn't make any sense
p207
aVbecause whether we like it or not,
p208
aVthe fates of African people are deeply intertwined.
p209
aa(lp210
VWhen disaster hits, when turmoil hits,
p211
aVwe share the consequences.
p212
aVWhen Burundians flee political turmoil,
p213
aVthey go to us,
p214
aVto other African countries.
p215
aVAfrica has six of the world's largest refugee centers.
p216
aVWhat was once a Burundian problem
p217
aVbecomes an African problem.
p218
aVSo to me, there are no Sudanese problems
p219
aVor South African problems or Kenyan problems,
p220
aVonly African problems
p221
aVbecause eventually, we share the turmoil.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo if we share the problems,
p224
aVwhy aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes?
p225
aVHow can we do that?
p226
aVWell, in the long term,
p227
aVwe can shoot towards increasing inter-African trade,
p228
aVremoving borders and putting pressure on leaders
p229
aVto fulfill regional agreements they've already signed.
p230
aVBut I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes
p231
aVis to foster something I like to call social Pan-Africanism.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, political Pan-Africanism already exists,
p234
aVso I'm not inventing anything totally new here.
p235
aVBut political Pan-Africanism
p236
aVis usually the African unity of the political elite.
p237
aVAnd who does that benefit?
p238
aVWell, African leaders, almost exclusively.
p239
aVNo, what I'm talking about
p240
aVis the Pan-Africanism of the ordinary African.
p241
aVYoung Africans like me,
p242
aVwe are bursting with creative energy,
p243
aVwith innovative ideas.
p244
aVBut with bad governance and shaky institutions,
p245
aVall of this potential could go to waste.
p246
aVOn a continent where more than a handful of leaders
p247
aVhave been in power longer
p248
aVthan the majority of the populations has been alive,
p249
aVwe are in desperate need of something new,
p250
aVsomething that works.
p251
aVAnd I think that thing is social Pan-Africanism.
p252
aa(lp253
VMy dream is that young Africans
p254
aVstop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation.
p255
aVMy dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant,
p256
aVthey don't say, "Well, this wouldn't work in my country,"
p257
aVand then give up.
p258
aVMy dream is that young Africans begin to realize
p259
aVthat the entire continent is our canvas, is our home.
p260
aVUsing the Internet, we can begin to think collaboratively,
p261
aVwe can begin to innovate together.
p262
aVIn Africa, we say, "If you want to go fast, you go alone,
p263
aVbut if you want to go far, you go together."
p264
aVAnd I believe that social Pan-Africanism is how we can go far together.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd this is already happening.
p267
aVAccess to these online networks has given young Africans
p268
aVsomething we've always had to violently take: a voice.
p269
aVWe now have a platform.
p270
aVBefore now, if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa,
p271
aVyou waited for the 65-year-old minister of youth \u2014
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
Vto wake up in the morning,
p276
aVtake his heartburn medication
p277
aVand then tell you the plans he has for your generation
p278
aVin 20 years time.
p279
aVBefore now, if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government,
p280
aVyou were pushed to protest, suffer the consequences
p281
aVand have your fingers crossed
p282
aVthat some Western paper somewhere might make someone care.
p283
aVBut now we have opportunities to back each other up
p284
aVin ways we never could before.
p285
aa(lp286
VWe support South African students
p287
aVwho are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees.
p288
aVWe support Zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament.
p289
aVWe support Angolan journalists who are being illegally detained.
p290
aVFor the first time ever,
p291
aVAfrican pain and African aspiration
p292
aVhas the ability to be witnessed
p293
aVby those who can empathize with it the most:
p294
aVother Africans.
p295
aa(lp296
VI believe that with a social Pan-Africanist thinking
p297
aVand using the Internet as a tool,
p298
aVwe can begin to rescue each other,
p299
aVand ultimately, to rescue ourselves.
p300
aa(lp301
VThank you.

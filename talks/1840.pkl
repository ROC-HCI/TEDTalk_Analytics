VI'm a physician trained in infectious diseases,
p5
aVand following my training,
p6
aVI moved to Somalia
p7
aVfrom San Francisco.
p8
aVAnd my goodbye greeting
p9
aVfrom the chief of infectious diseases
p10
aVat San Francisco General was,
p11
aV"Gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make."
p12
aa(lp13
VBut I landed in a refugee situation
p14
aVthat had a million refugees in 40 camps,
p15
aVand there were six of us doctors.
p16
aVThere were many epidemics there.
p17
aVMy responsibilities were largely related to
p18
aVtuberculosis,
p19
aVand then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.
p20
aVSo it was the spread of tuberculosis
p21
aVand the spread of cholera
p22
aVthat I was responsible for inhibiting.
p23
aVAnd in order to do this work, we, of course,
p24
aVbecause of the limitation in health workers,
p25
aVhad to recruit refugees to be a specialized
p26
aVnew category of health worker.
p27
aVFollowing three years of work in Somalia,
p28
aVI got picked up by the World Health Organization,
p29
aVand got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.
p30
aVMy primary responsibility was Uganda,
p31
aVbut also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi
p32
aVand Zaire, now Congo,
p33
aVTanzania, Malawi, and several other countries.
p34
aVAnd my last assignment there was to run a unit
p35
aVcalled intervention development,
p36
aVwhich was responsible for designing interventions.
p37
aa(lp38
VAfter 10 years of working overseas,
p39
aVI was exhausted.
p40
aVI really had very little left.
p41
aVI had been traveling to one country after another.
p42
aVI was emotionally feeling very isolated.
p43
aVI wanted to come home.
p44
aVI'd seen a lot of death,
p45
aVin particular epidemic death,
p46
aVand epidemic death has a different feel to it.
p47
aVIt's full of panic and fear,
p48
aVand I'd heard the women wailing and crying
p49
aVin the desert.
p50
aVAnd I wanted to come home and take a break
p51
aVand maybe start over.
p52
aa(lp53
VI was not aware of any epidemic problems
p54
aVin America.
p55
aVIn fact, I wasn't aware of any problems in America.
p56
aVIn fact \u2014 seriously.
p57
aVAnd in fact I would visit friends of mine,
p58
aVand I noticed that they had water
p59
aVthat came right into their homes.
p60
aVHow many of you have such a situation?
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVAnd some of them, many of them actually,
p63
aVhad water that came into more than one room.
p64
aVAnd I noticed that they would move
p65
aVthis little thermoregulatory device
p66
aVto change the temperature in their home
p67
aVby one degree or two degrees.
p68
aVAnd now I do that.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd I really didn't know what I would do,
p71
aVbut friends of mine began telling me
p72
aVabout children shooting other children with guns.
p73
aVAnd I asked the question,
p74
aVwhat are you doing about it?
p75
aVWhat are you in America doing about it?
p76
aVAnd there were two essential explanations
p77
aVor ideas that were prevalent.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd one was punishment.
p80
aVAnd this I had heard about before.
p81
aVWe who had worked in behavior
p82
aVknew that punishment was something that was discussed
p83
aVbut also that it was highly overvalued.
p84
aVIt was not a main driver of behavior,
p85
aVnor was it a main driver of behavior change.
p86
aVAnd besides that, it reminded me
p87
aVof ancient epidemics
p88
aVthat were previously completely misunderstood
p89
aVbecause the science hadn't been there before,
p90
aVepidemics of plague
p91
aVor typhus or leprosy,
p92
aVwhere the prevalent ideas were that there were
p93
aVbad people or bad humors or bad air,
p94
aVand widows were dragged around the moat,
p95
aVand dungeons were part of the solution.
p96
aa(lp97
VThe other explanation or, in a way,
p98
aVthe solution suggested,
p99
aVis please fix all of these things:
p100
aVthe schools, the community, the homes, the families,
p101
aVeverything.
p102
aVAnd I'd heard this before as well.
p103
aVI'd called this the "everything" theory,
p104
aVor EOE: Everything On Earth.
p105
aVBut we'd also realized
p106
aVin treating other processes and problems
p107
aVthat sometimes you don't need to treat everything.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd so the sense that I had
p110
aVwas there was a giant gap here.
p111
aVThe problem of violence was stuck,
p112
aVand this has historically been the case
p113
aVin many other issues.
p114
aVDiarrheal diseases had been stuck.
p115
aVMalaria had been stuck.
p116
aVFrequently, a strategy has to be rethought.
p117
aVIt's not as if I had any idea what it would look like,
p118
aVbut there was a sense that we would have to do
p119
aVsomething with new categories of workers
p120
aVand something having to do with behavior change
p121
aVand something having to do with public education.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut I began to ask questions
p124
aVand search out the usual things
p125
aVthat I had been exploring before,
p126
aVlike, what do the maps look like?
p127
aVWhat do the graphs look like?
p128
aVWhat does the data look like?
p129
aVAnd the maps of violence
p130
aVin most U.S. cities
p131
aVlooked like this.
p132
aVThere was clustering.
p133
aVThis reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also
p134
aVin infectious epidemics,
p135
aVfor example cholera.
p136
aVAnd then we looked at the maps,
p137
aVand the maps showed this typical wave
p138
aVupon wave upon wave,
p139
aVbecause all epidemics
p140
aVare combinations of many epidemics.
p141
aVAnd it also looked like infectious epidemics.
p142
aVAnd then we asked the question,
p143
aVwell what really predicts a case of violence?
p144
aVAnd it turns out that the greatest predictor
p145
aVof a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.
p146
aVWhich also sounds like, if there is a case of flu,
p147
aVsomeone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold,
p148
aVor the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis
p149
aVis having been exposed to tuberculosis.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd so we see that violence is, in a way,
p152
aVbehaving like a contagious disease.
p153
aVWe're aware of this anyway
p154
aVeven in our common experiences
p155
aVor our newspaper stories
p156
aVof the spread of violence from fights
p157
aVor in gang wars or in civil wars
p158
aVor even in genocides.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd so there's good news about this, though,
p161
aVbecause there's a way to reverse epidemics,
p162
aVand there's really only three things that are done
p163
aVto reverse epidemics,
p164
aVand the first of it is interrupting transmission.
p165
aVIn order to interrupt transmission,
p166
aVyou need to detect and find first cases.
p167
aVIn other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody
p168
aVwho has active T.B. who is infecting other people.
p169
aVMake sense?
p170
aVAnd there's special workers for doing that.
p171
aVFor this particular problem,
p172
aVwe designed a new category of worker
p173
aVwho, like a SARS worker
p174
aVor someone looking for bird flu,
p175
aVmight find first cases.
p176
aVIn this case, it's someone who's very angry
p177
aVbecause someone looked at his girlfriend
p178
aVor owes him money,
p179
aVand you can find workers and train them
p180
aVinto these specialized categories.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd the second thing to do, of course,
p183
aVis to prevent further spread,
p184
aVthat means to find who else has been exposed,
p185
aVbut may not be spreading so much right now
p186
aVlike someone with a smaller case of T.B.,
p187
aVor someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods,
p188
aVbut in the same group,
p189
aVand then they need to be, in a way,
p190
aVmanaged as well,
p191
aVparticular to the specific disease process.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd then the third part, the shifting the norms,
p194
aVand that means a whole bunch of community activities,
p195
aVremodeling, public education,
p196
aVand then you've got what you might call
p197
aVgroup immunity.
p198
aVAnd that combination of factors
p199
aVis how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda
p200
aVwas very successfully reversed.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd so what we decided to do in the year 2000
p203
aVis kind of put this together in a way
p204
aVby hiring in new categories of workers,
p205
aVthe first being violence interruptors.
p206
aVAnd then we would put all of this into place
p207
aVin one neighborhood
p208
aVin what was the worst police district
p209
aVin the United States at the time.
p210
aVSo violence interruptors hired from the same group,
p211
aVcredibility, trust, access,
p212
aVjust like the health workers in Somalia,
p213
aVbut designed for a different category,
p214
aVand trained in persuasion,
p215
aVcooling people down, buying time, reframing.
p216
aVAnd then another category of worker,
p217
aVthe outreach workers, to keep people
p218
aVin a way on therapy for six to 24 months.
p219
aVJust like T.B., but the object is behavior change.
p220
aVAnd then a bunch of community activities
p221
aVfor changing norms.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow our first experiment of this
p224
aVresulted in a 67-percent drop
p225
aVin shootings and killings
p226
aVin the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd this was a beautiful thing
p231
aVfor the neighborhood itself,
p232
aVfirst 50 or 60 days, then 90 days,
p233
aVand then there was unfortunately another shooting
p234
aVin another 90 days,
p235
aVand the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.
p236
aVThey were using parks they weren't using before.
p237
aVThe sun was out. Everybody was happy.
p238
aa(lp239
VBut of course, the funders said, "Wait a second,
p240
aVdo it again."
p241
aVAnd so we had to then, fortunately,
p242
aVget the funds to repeat this experience,
p243
aVand this is one of the next four neighborhoods
p244
aVthat had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings.
p245
aVAnd since that time, this has been replicated
p246
aV20 times.
p247
aVThere have been independent evaluations
p248
aVsupported by the Justice Department
p249
aVand by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins
p250
aVthat have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent
p251
aVreductions in shootings and killings
p252
aVusing this new method.
p253
aVIn fact, there have been three independent
p254
aVevaluations of this now.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this,
p257
aVincluding being featured on
p258
aVThe New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story.
p259
aVThe Economist in 2009
p260
aVsaid this is "the approach that will come to prominence."
p261
aVAnd even a movie was made around our work.
p262
aV[The Interrupters]
p263
aa(lp264
VHowever, not so fast,
p265
aVbecause a lot of people did not agree
p266
aVwith this way of going about it.
p267
aVWe got a lot of criticism,
p268
aVa lot of opposition,
p269
aVand a lot of opponents.
p270
aVIn other words, what do you mean, health problem?
p271
aVWhat do you mean, epidemic?
p272
aVWhat do you mean, no bad guys?
p273
aVAnd there's whole industries designed
p274
aVfor managing bad people.
p275
aVWhat do you mean, hiring people
p276
aVwho have backgrounds?
p277
aVMy business friends said,
p278
aV"Gary, you're being criticized tremendously.
p279
aVYou must be doing something right."
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VMy musician friends added the word "dude."
p284
aa(lp285
VSo anyway, additionally,
p286
aVthere was still this problem,
p287
aVand we were getting highly criticized as well
p288
aVfor not dealing with all of these other problems.
p289
aVYet we were able to manage malaria
p290
aVand reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases
p291
aVin places with awful economies
p292
aVwithout healing the economy.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo what's actually happened is,
p295
aValthough there is still some opposition,
p296
aVthe movement is clearly growing.
p297
aVMany of the major cities in the U.S.,
p298
aVincluding New York City and Baltimore
p299
aVand Kansas City,
p300
aVtheir health departments are running this now.
p301
aVChicago and New Orleans, the health departments
p302
aVare having a very large role in this.
p303
aVThis is being embraced more by law enforcement
p304
aVthan it had been years ago.
p305
aVTrauma centers and hospitals
p306
aVare doing their part in stepping up.
p307
aVAnd the U.S. Conference of Mayors
p308
aVhas endorsed not only the approach
p309
aVbut the specific model.
p310
aVWhere there's really been uptake even faster
p311
aVis in the international environment,
p312
aVwhere there's a 55-percent drop
p313
aVin the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico,
p314
aVwhere interruptions are just beginning in Honduras,
p315
aVwhere the strategy has been applied in Kenya
p316
aVfor the recent elections,
p317
aVand where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo violence is responding as a disease
p320
aVeven as it behaves as a disease.
p321
aVSo the theory, in a way,
p322
aVis kind of being validated by the treatment.
p323
aVAnd recently, the Institute of Medicine
p324
aVcame out with a workshop report
p325
aVwhich went through some of the data,
p326
aVincluding the neuroscience,
p327
aVon how this problem is really transmitted.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo I think this is good news,
p330
aVbecause it allows us an opportunity
p331
aVto come out of the Middle Ages,
p332
aVwhich is where I feel this field has been.
p333
aVIt gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility
p334
aVof replacing some of these prisons
p335
aVwith playgrounds or parks,
p336
aVand to consider the possibility
p337
aVof converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods,
p338
aVand to allow there to be a new strategy,
p339
aVa new set of methods, a new set of workers:
p340
aVscience, in a way, replacing morality.
p341
aVAnd moving away from emotions
p342
aVis the most important part of the solution
p343
aVto science as a more important part of the solution.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo I didn't mean to come up with this at all.
p346
aVIt was a matter of,
p347
aVI wanted actually a break,
p348
aVand we looked at maps, we looked at graphs,
p349
aVwe asked some questions
p350
aVand tried some tools
p351
aVthat actually have been used many times before
p352
aVfor other things.
p353
aVFor myself, I tried to get away from
p354
aVinfectious diseases,
p355
aVand I didn't.
p356
aa(lp357
VThank you.

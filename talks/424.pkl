VThere are more Chinese restaurants in this country
p5
aVthan McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined \u2014
p6
aV40,000, actually.
p7
aVChinese restaurants have played an important role in American history,
p8
aVas a matter of fact.
p9
aVThe Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant
p10
aVcalled Yenching Palace in Washington, DC,
p11
aVwhich unfortunately is closed now,
p12
aVand about to be turned into Walgreen's.
p13
aVAnd the house where John Wilkes Booth
p14
aVplanned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln
p15
aVis also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok and Roll,
p16
aVon H Street in Washington.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd it's not completely gratuitous,
p21
aVbecause "wok" and "roll" \u2014 Chinese food and Japanese foods,
p22
aVso it kind of works out.
p23
aVAnd Americans love their Chinese food so much,
p24
aVthey've actually brought it into space.
p25
aVNASA, for example, serves thermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork
p26
aVon its shuttle menu for its astronauts.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo, let me present the question to you:
p29
aVIf our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie,
p30
aVyou should ask yourself: how often do you eat apple pie,
p31
aVversus how often do you eat Chinese food?
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd if you think about it,
p36
aVa lot of the foods that we or Americans think of as Chinese food
p37
aVare barely recognizable to Chinese.
p38
aVFor example: beef with broccoli, egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken,
p39
aVfortune cookies, chop suey, the take-out boxes.
p40
aVFor example, I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China,
p41
aVgave them to Chinese to see how they would react.
p42
aa(lp43
V[What is this?]
p44
aa(lp45
V[Should I try it?]
p46
aa(lp47
V[Try it!]
p48
aa(lp49
V[What is this called?]
p50
aa(lp51
V[Fortune cookie.]
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
V[There's a piece of paper inside!]
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
V[What is this?]
p60
aa(lp61
V[You've won a prize!]
p62
aa(lp63
V[What is this?]
p64
aa(lp65
V[It's a fortune!]
p66
aa(lp67
V[Tasty!]
p68
aa(lp69
VSo where are they from?
p70
aVThe short answer is, actually, they're from Japan.
p71
aVAnd in Kyoto, outside, there are still small family-run bakeries
p72
aVthat make fortune cookies, as they did over 100 years ago,
p73
aV30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States.
p74
aVIf you see them side by side,
p75
aVthere's yellow and brown.
p76
aVTheirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste,
p77
aVso they're not as sweet as our version.
p78
aVSo how did they get to the US?
p79
aVWell, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over,
p80
aVand a bunch of the bakers introduced them \u2014
p81
aVincluding at least one in Los Angeles,
p82
aVand one here in San Francisco, called Benkyodo,
p83
aVwhich is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan.
p84
aVBack then, they made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons
p85
aVthat we saw back in Kyoto.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe interesting question is:
p88
aVHow do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese
p89
aVto being something that is Chinese?
p90
aVWell, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II,
p91
aVincluding those that made fortune cookies.
p92
aVSo that's when the Chinese moved in,
p93
aVsaw a market opportunity and took over.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VSo, fortune cookies: invented by the Japanese,
p98
aVpopularized by the Chinese,
p99
aVbut ultimately consumed by Americans.
p100
aVThey're more American than anything else.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnother of my favorite dishes:
p103
aVGeneral Tso's Chicken \u2014 which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy
p104
aVis called Admiral Tso's Chicken.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VI love this dish.
p109
aVThe original name of my book was "The Long March of General Tso."
p110
aVAnd he has marched very far indeed,
p111
aVbecause he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken \u2014
p112
aVall things that Americans love.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VHe has marched so far, actually,
p117
aVthat the chef who originally invented the dish
p118
aVdoesn't recognize it; he's kind of horrified.
p119
aa(lp120
VVideo: (In Chinese)
p121
aa(lp122
VAudience: (Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VHe's in Taiwan right now.
p125
aVHe's retired, deaf and plays a lot of mah\u2013jongg.
p126
aVAfter I showed him this, he got up,
p127
aVand says, "mòmíngqímiào," which means, "This is all nonsense,"
p128
aVand goes back to play his mah-jongg game during the afternoon.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnother dish, one of my favorites: beef with broccoli.
p131
aVBroccoli is not a Chinese vegetable;
p132
aVin fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable.
p133
aVIt was introduced into the United States in the 1800s,
p134
aVbut became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.
p135
aVThe Chinese have their own version of broccoli, called Chinese broccoli,
p136
aVbut they've now discovered American broccoli,
p137
aVand are importing it as a sort of exotic delicacy.
p138
aa(lp139
VI guarantee you, General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life.
p140
aVThat was a picture of General Tso.
p141
aVI went to his home town.
p142
aVThis is a billboard that says:
p143
aV"Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso."
p144
aVAnd I went looking for chicken.
p145
aVFinally found a cow \u2014
p146
aVand did find chicken.
p147
aVBelieve it or not, these guys were actually crossing the road.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd I found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives
p152
aVwho are still in the town.
p153
aVThis guy is now five generations removed from the General;
p154
aVthis guy is about seven.
p155
aVI showed them the pictures of General Tso Chicken,
p156
aVand they were like,
p157
aV"We don't know this dish. Is this Chinese food?"
p158
aVBecause it doesn't look like Chinese food to them.
p159
aVBut they weren't surprised I traveled around the world to visit them,
p160
aVbecause in their eyes he is, after all,
p161
aVa famous Qing dynasty military hero.
p162
aVHe played an important role in the Taiping Rebellion,
p163
aVa war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God
p164
aVand baby brother of Jesus Christ.
p165
aVHe caused a war that killed 20 million people \u2014
p166
aVstill the deadliest civil war in the world to this day.
p167
aVSo, you know, I realized when I was there,
p168
aVGeneral Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America,
p169
aVin that he's known for chicken and not war.
p170
aVBut in China, this guy's actually known for war and not chicken.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut the granddaddy of all the Chinese American dishes
p173
aVwe probably ought to talk about is chop suey,
p174
aVwhich was introduced around the turn of the 20th century.
p175
aVAccording to the New York Times in 1904,
p176
aVthere was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town,
p177
aVand "... the city has gone 'chop suey' mad."
p178
aVSo it took about 30 years before the Americans realized
p179
aVthat chop suey is actually not known in China,
p180
aVand as this article points out,
p181
aV"The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey."
p182
aVBack then it was a way to show you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan;
p183
aVa guy who wanted to impress a girl could take her on a chop suey date.
p184
aVI like to say chop suey is the biggest culinary joke
p185
aVone culture ever played on another,
p186
aVbecause "chop suey," translated into Chinese,
p187
aVmeans "jaahp-seui," which, translated back, means "odds and ends."
p188
aVSo, these people are going around China asking for chop suey,
p189
aVwhich is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying,
p190
aV"I understand you have a very popular dish in your country
p191
aVcalled 'leftovers.'"
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VRight?
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd not only that:
p200
aV"This dish is particularly popular
p201
aVafter that holiday you call 'Thanksgiving.'"
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VSo, why and where did chop suey come from?
p206
aVLet's go back to the mid-1800s,
p207
aVwhen the Chinese first came to America.
p208
aVBack then, Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food.
p209
aVIn fact, they saw these people who landed at their shores as alien.
p210
aVThese people weren't eating dogs, they were eating cats.
p211
aVIf they weren't eating cats, they were eating rats.
p212
aVIn fact, The New York Times, my esteemed employer,
p213
aVin 1883 ran an article that asked,
p214
aV"Do Chinese eat rats?"
p215
aVNot the most PC question to be asked today,
p216
aVbut if you look at the popular imagery of the time,
p217
aVnot so outlandish.
p218
aVThis is actually a real advertisement for rat poison
p219
aVfrom the late 1800s.
p220
aVAnd if you see under the word "Clears" \u2014 very small \u2014
p221
aVit says, "They must go," which refers not only to the rats,
p222
aVbut to the Chinese in their midst,
p223
aVbecause the way that the food was perceived
p224
aVwas that these people who ate foods different from us
p225
aVmust be different from us.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnother way that you saw this antipathy towards the Chinese
p228
aVis through documents like this.
p229
aVThis is in the Library of Congress.
p230
aVIt's a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers,
p231
aVhero of our American labor movement.
p232
aVIt's called, "Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion:
p233
aVMeat versus Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism:
p234
aVWhich shall survive?"
p235
aVAnd it basically made the argument
p236
aVthat Chinese men who ate rice
p237
aVwould necessarily bring down the standard of living
p238
aVfor American men who ate meat.
p239
aVAnd as a matter of fact, then,
p240
aVthis is one of the reasons we must exclude them from this country.
p241
aVSo, with sentiments like these,
p242
aVthe Chinese Exclusion Act was passed between 1882 and 1902,
p243
aVthe only time in American history
p244
aVwhen a group was specifically excluded
p245
aVfor its national origin or ethnicity.
p246
aVSo in a way, because the Chinese were attacked,
p247
aVchop suey was created as a defense mechanism.
p248
aa(lp249
VWho came up with the idea of chop suey?
p250
aVThere's a lot of different mysteries and legends,
p251
aVbut of the ones I've found,
p252
aVthe most interesting is this article from 1904.
p253
aVA Chinese guy named Lem Sen
p254
aVshows up in Chinatown, New York City, and says,
p255
aV"I want you all to stop making chop suey,
p256
aVbecause I am the original creator and sole proprietor of chop suey.
p257
aVAnd the way he tells it,
p258
aVthere was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up,
p259
aVand he was told to make a dish that looked very popular
p260
aVand could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.
p261
aVAnd as he said \u2014 we would never print this today \u2014
p262
aVbut basically, the American man has become very rich.
p263
aVLem Sen: "I would've made this money, too, but I spent all this time
p264
aVlooking for the American man who stole my recipe.
p265
aVNow I've found him and I want my recipe back,
p266
aVand I want everyone to stop making chop suey,
p267
aVor pay me for the right to do the same.
p268
aVSo it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights.
p269
aa(lp270
VThe thing is, this idea of Chinese-American food
p271
aVdoesn't exist only in America.
p272
aVIn fact, Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet,
p273
aVserved on all seven continents, even Antarctica,
p274
aVbecause Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station,
p275
aVwhich is the main scientific station in Antarctica.
p276
aVYou see different varieties of Chinese food.
p277
aVFor example, there is French Chinese food,
p278
aVwhere they serve salt and pepper frog legs.
p279
aVThere is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies,
p280
aVso they serve fried gelato.
p281
aVMy neighbor, Alessandra, was shocked when I told her,
p282
aV"Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."
p283
aVShe's like, "It's not? But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VEven the Brits have their own version.
p288
aVThis is a dish called "crispy shredded beef,"
p289
aVwhich has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred, and not a lot of beef.
p290
aVThere is West Indian Chinese food, there's Jamaican Chinese food,
p291
aVMiddle Eastern Chinese food, Mauritian Chinese food.
p292
aVThis is a dish called "Magic Bowl," that I discovered.
p293
aVThere's Indian Chinese food, Korean Chinese food,
p294
aVJapanese Chinese food,
p295
aVwhere they take the bao, the little buns, and make them into pizza versions.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd they totally randomly take Chinese noodle dishes,
p300
aVand just ramenize them.
p301
aVThis is something that, in the Chinese version, has no soup.
p302
aVSo, there's Peruvian Chinese food,
p303
aVwhich should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food,
p304
aVwhere they basically take things and make it look like fajitas.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd they have things like risotto chop suey.
p309
aVMy personal favorite of all the restaurants
p310
aVI've encountered around the world
p311
aVwas this one in Brazil, called "Kung Food."
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VSo, let's take a step back and understand
p316
aVwhat is to be appreciated in America.
p317
aVMcDonald's has garnered a lot of attention, a lot of respect,
p318
aVfor basically standardizing the menu, decor and dining experience
p319
aVin post-World War II America.
p320
aVBut you know what?
p321
aVThey did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois.
p322
aVChinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue,
p323
aVwith the menu and the decor, even the restaurant name,
p324
aVbut without a centralized headquarters.
p325
aVSo, this actually became very clear to me
p326
aVwith the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,
p327
aVwhere they expected, based on the number of ticket sales they had,
p328
aVto have three or four second-place winners,
p329
aVpeople who match five or six Powerball numbers.
p330
aVInstead, they had 110, and they were completely shocked.
p331
aa(lp332
VThey looked all across the country and discovered it couldn't be fraud,
p333
aVsince it happened in different states, across different computer systems.
p334
aVWhatever it was, it caused people to behave in a mass-synchronized way.
p335
aVSo, OK, maybe it had to do with the patterns on the pieces of paper,
p336
aVlike it was a diamond, or diagonal.
p337
aVIt wasn't that, so they're like, OK, let's look at television.
p338
aVSo they looked at an episode of "Lost."
p339
aVNow, I don't have a TV,
p340
aVwhich makes me a freak, but very productive \u2014
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd there's an episode of "Lost" where one guy has a lucky number,
p345
aVbut it's not a lucky number, it's why he's on the island,
p346
aVbut they looked and the numbers did not match.
p347
aVThey looked at "The Young and The Restless." It wasn't that, either.
p348
aVIt wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day and they ask him,
p349
aV"Where did you get your number?"
p350
aVHe said, "I got it from a fortune cookie."
p351
aVThis is a slip one of the winners had,
p352
aVbecause the Tennessee lottery security officials
p353
aVwere like, "Oh, no, this can't be true."
p354
aVBut it was true.
p355
aVBasically, of those 110 people,
p356
aV104 of them or so had gotten their number from a fortune cookie.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Laughter)
p359
aa(lp360
VYeah. So I went and started looking.
p361
aVI went across the country, looking for these restaurants
p362
aVwhere these people had gotten their fortune cookies from.
p363
aVThere are a bunch of them, including Lee's China in Omaha \u2014
p364
aVwhich is actually run by Koreans, but that's another point,
p365
aVand a bunch of them named "China Buffet."
p366
aVWhat's interesting is that their stories were similar, but different.
p367
aVIt was lunch, it was take-out, it was sit-down, it was buffet,
p368
aVit was three weeks ago, it was three months ago.
p369
aVBut at some point, all these people had a very similar experience
p370
aVthat converged at a fortune cookie and a Chinese restaurant.
p371
aVAnd all these restaurants were serving fortune cookies,
p372
aVwhich, of course, aren't even Chinese to begin with.
p373
aVIt's part of the phenomenon I called "spontaneous self-organization,"
p374
aVwhere, like in ant colonies, little decisions made on the micro level
p375
aVactually have a big impact on the macro level.
p376
aa(lp377
VA good contrast is Chicken McNuggets.
p378
aVMcDonald's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product.
p379
aVThey did chicken pot pie, fried chicken, and finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.
p380
aVAnd the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggifying them,
p381
aVthat's kind of an easy concept.
p382
aVThe trick was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone
p383
aVin a cost-efficient manner,
p384
aVwhich is why it took so long for people to copy them \u2014 10 years,
p385
aVthen within a couple months, it was such a hit,
p386
aVthey introduced it across the entire McDonald's system in the country.
p387
aa(lp388
VIn contrast is General Tso's Chicken,
p389
aVwhich actually started in New York City in the early 1970s,
p390
aVas I was also started in this universe in New York City in the early 1970s.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd this logo!
p395
aVSo me, General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmicly related.
p396
aVBut that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America
p397
aVfrom a restaurant in New York City.
p398
aVSomeone's like, "It's sweet, it's fried, it's chicken \u2014
p399
aVAmericans will love this."
p400
aa(lp401
VSo what I like to say, this being Bay Area, Silicon Valley,
p402
aVis that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of dining experiences.
p403
aVWe can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux,
p404
aVsort of an open-source thing, right?
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VWhere ideas from one person can be copied and propagated
p409
aVacross the entire system,
p410
aVthat there can be specialized versions of Chinese food,
p411
aVdepending on the region.
p412
aVFor example, in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food,
p413
aVwhere they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish.
p414
aVAnd in Philadelphia, you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll,
p415
aVwhich is like an egg roll on the outside and cheesesteak on the inside.
p416
aVI was surprised to discover that not only in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta.
p417
aVWhat had happened was,
p418
aVa Chinese family had moved from Philadelphia to Atlanta,
p419
aVand brought that with them.
p420
aa(lp421
VSo the thing is,
p422
aVour historical lore, because of the way we like narratives,
p423
aVis full of vast characters, such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks
p424
aVand Ray Kroc with McDonald's
p425
aVand Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.
p426
aVBut, you know, it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters.
p427
aVFor example, Lem Sen, who introduced chop suey,
p428
aVChef Peng, who introduced General Tso's Chicken,
p429
aVand all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies.
p430
aVSo, the point of my presentation is to make you think twice;
p431
aVthat those whose names are forgotten in history
p432
aVcan often have had as much, if not more,
p433
aVimpact on what we eat today.
p434
aa(lp435
VThank you very much.
p436
aa(lp437
V(Applause)

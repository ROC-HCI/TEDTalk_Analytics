VI'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership
p5
aVin the 21st century.
p6
aVIn the 21st century, we need to actually look at \u2014
p7
aVand what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today \u2014
p8
aVis to go back to our school days
p9
aVwhen we learned how to count.
p10
aVBut I think it's time for us to think about what we count.
p11
aVBecause what we actually count
p12
aVtruly counts.
p13
aa(lp14
VLet me start by telling you a little story.
p15
aVThis is Van Quach.
p16
aVShe came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.
p17
aVShe changed her name to Vivian
p18
aVbecause she wanted to fit in here in America.
p19
aVHer first job was at an inner-city motel
p20
aVin San Francisco as a maid.
p21
aVI happened to buy that motel
p22
aVabout three months after Vivian started working there.
p23
aVSo Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.
p24
aa(lp25
VWith the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,
p26
aVin 1987,
p27
aVI started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,
p28
aVa very impractical name,
p29
aVbecause I actually was looking to create joy of life.
p30
aVAnd this first hotel that I bought, motel,
p31
aVwas a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel
p32
aVin the inner-city of San Francisco.
p33
aVAs I spent time with Vivian,
p34
aVI saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre
p35
aVin how she did her work.
p36
aVIt made me question and curious:
p37
aVHow could someone actually find joy
p38
aVin cleaning toilets for a living?
p39
aVSo I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that
p40
aVshe didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.
p41
aVHer job, her goal and her calling
p42
aVwas not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.
p43
aVWhat counts for Vivian was the emotional connection
p44
aVshe created with her fellow employees and our guests.
p45
aVAnd what gave her inspiration and meaning
p46
aVwas the fact that she was taking care of people
p47
aVwho were far away from home.
p48
aVBecause Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.
p49
aa(lp50
VThat very human lesson,
p51
aVmore than 20 years ago,
p52
aVserved me well during the last
p53
aVeconomic downturn we had.
p54
aVIn the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,
p55
aVSan Francisco Bay Area hotels
p56
aVwent through the largest percentage revenue drop
p57
aVin the history of American hotels.
p58
aVWe were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,
p59
aVso we were particularly vulnerable.
p60
aVBut also back then,
p61
aVremember we stopped eating French fries in this country.
p62
aVWell, not exactly, of course not.
p63
aVWe started eating "freedom fries,"
p64
aVand we started boycotting anything that was French.
p65
aVWell, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre \u2014
p66
aVso I started getting these letters
p67
aVfrom places like Alabama and Orange County
p68
aVsaying to me that they were going to boycott my company
p69
aVbecause they thought we were a French company.
p70
aVAnd I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.
p71
aVWe're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."
p72
aVAnd I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VSo one particular day
p77
aVwhen I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,
p78
aVI ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.
p79
aVAnd I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore
p80
aVlooking for a business solution.
p81
aVBut given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up
p82
aVin the self-help section very quickly.
p83
aVThat's where I got reacquainted with
p84
aVAbraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."
p85
aVI took one psychology class in college,
p86
aVand I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,
p87
aVas many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.
p88
aVBut as I sat there for four hours,
p89
aVthe full afternoon, reading Maslow,
p90
aVI recognized something
p91
aVthat is true of most leaders.
p92
aVOne of the simplest facts in business
p93
aVis something that we often neglect,
p94
aVand that is that we're all human.
p95
aVEach of us, no matter what our role is in business,
p96
aVhas some hierarchy of needs
p97
aVin the workplace.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo as I started reading more Maslow,
p100
aVwhat I started to realize is that
p101
aVMaslow, later in his life,
p102
aVwanted to take this hierarchy for the individual
p103
aVand apply it to the collective,
p104
aVto organizations and specifically to business.
p105
aVBut unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,
p106
aVand so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.
p107
aVSo I realized in that dotcom crash
p108
aVthat my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.
p109
aVAnd that's what I did a few years ago
p110
aVwhen I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid
p111
aVand turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,
p112
aVwhich is survival, success and transformation.
p113
aVIt's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.
p114
aVAnd we started asking ourselves the questions
p115
aVabout how we were actually addressing
p116
aVthe higher needs, these transformational needs
p117
aVfor our key employees in the company.
p118
aVThese three levels of the hierarchy needs
p119
aVrelate to the five levels
p120
aVof Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing
p123
aVthe higher needs of our employees and our customers,
p124
aVI realized we had no metrics.
p125
aVWe had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.
p126
aVSo we started asking ourselves:
p127
aVWhat kind of less obvious metrics
p128
aVcould we use to actually evaluate
p129
aVour employees' sense of meaning,
p130
aVor our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?
p131
aVFor example, we actually started asking our employees,
p132
aVdo they understand the mission of our company,
p133
aVand do they feel like they believe in it,
p134
aVcan they actually influence it,
p135
aVand do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?
p136
aVWe started asking our customers,
p137
aVdid they feel an emotional connection with us,
p138
aVin one of seven different kinds of ways.
p139
aVMiraculously, as we asked these questions
p140
aVand started giving attention higher up the pyramid,
p141
aVwhat we found is we created more loyalty.
p142
aVOur customer loyalty skyrocketed.
p143
aVOur employee turnover dropped
p144
aVto one-third of the industry average,
p145
aVand during that five year dotcom bust,
p146
aVwe tripled in size.
p147
aa(lp148
VAs I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there
p149
aVand asking them how they were getting through that time,
p150
aVwhat they told me over and over again
p151
aVwas that they just manage what they can measure.
p152
aVWhat we can measure is that tangible stuff
p153
aVat the bottom of the pyramid.
p154
aVThey didn't even see the intangible stuff
p155
aVhigher up the pyramid.
p156
aVSo I started asking myself the question:
p157
aVHow can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?
p158
aVIf we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,
p159
aVand all we can measure is the tangible in life,
p160
aVwe're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo I went out and studied a bunch of things,
p163
aVand I found a survey that showed
p164
aVthat 94 percent
p165
aVof business leaders worldwide
p166
aVbelieve that the intangibles are important in their business,
p167
aVthings like intellectual property,
p168
aVtheir corporate culture, their brand loyalty,
p169
aVand yet, only five percent of those same leaders
p170
aVactually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.
p171
aVSo as leaders, we understand
p172
aVthat intangibles are important,
p173
aVbut we don't have a clue how to measure them.
p174
aVSo here's another Einstein quote:
p175
aV"Not everything that can be counted counts,
p176
aVand not everything that counts can be counted."
p177
aVI hate to argue with Einstein,
p178
aVbut if that which is most valuable
p179
aVin our life and our business
p180
aVactually can't be counted or valued,
p181
aVaren't we going to spend our lives
p182
aVjust mired in measuring the mundane?
p183
aa(lp184
VIt was that sort of heady question about what counts
p185
aVthat led me to take my CEO hat off for a week
p186
aVand fly off to the Himalayan peaks.
p187
aVI flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,
p188
aVa place some folks call Shangri-La.
p189
aVIt's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid
p190
aVto becoming a transformational
p191
aVrole model for the world.
p192
aVI went to Bhutan.
p193
aVThe teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,
p194
aVbut this was back in 1972,
p195
aVwhen he ascended to the throne
p196
aVtwo days after his father passed away.
p197
aVAt age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions
p198
aVthat you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.
p199
aa(lp200
VOn a trip through India,
p201
aVearly in his reign as king,
p202
aVhe was asked by an Indian journalist
p203
aVabout the Bhutanese GDP,
p204
aVthe size of the Bhutanese GDP.
p205
aVThe king responded in a fashion
p206
aVthat actually has transformed us four decades later.
p207
aVHe said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed
p208
aVand focused with gross domestic product?
p209
aVWhy don't we care more about
p210
aVgross national happiness?"
p211
aVNow, in essence, the king was asking us to consider
p212
aVan alternative definition of success,
p213
aVwhat has come to be known as
p214
aVGNH, or gross national happiness.
p215
aVMost world leaders didn't take notice,
p216
aVand those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."
p217
aVBut the king was serious.
p218
aVThis was a notable moment,
p219
aVbecause this was the first time a world leader
p220
aVin almost 200 years
p221
aVhad suggested
p222
aVthat intangible of happiness \u2014
p223
aVthat leader 200 years ago,
p224
aVThomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence \u2014
p225
aV200 years later,
p226
aVthis king was suggesting that intangible of happiness
p227
aVis something that we should measure,
p228
aVand it's something we should actually value
p229
aVas government officials.
p230
aa(lp231
VFor the next three dozen years as king,
p232
aVthis king actually started measuring
p233
aVand managing around happiness in Bhutan \u2014
p234
aVincluding, just recently, taking his country
p235
aVfrom being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy
p236
aVwith no bloodshed, no coup.
p237
aVBhutan, for those of you who don't know it,
p238
aVis the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,
p241
aVI got to really understand what they're doing.
p242
aVAnd I got to spend some time with the prime minister.
p243
aVOver dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.
p244
aVI asked him,
p245
aV"How can you create and measure
p246
aVsomething which evaporates \u2014
p247
aVin other words, happiness?"
p248
aVAnd he's a very wise man, and he said,
p249
aV"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.
p250
aVWe create the conditions for happiness to occur.
p251
aVIn other words, we create a habitat of happiness."
p252
aVWow, that's interesting.
p253
aVHe said that they have a science behind that art,
p254
aVand they've actually created four essential pillars,
p255
aVnine key indicators
p256
aVand 72 different metrics
p257
aVthat help them to measure their GNH.
p258
aVOne of those key indicators is:
p259
aVHow do the Bhutanese feel about
p260
aVhow they spend their time each day?
p261
aVIt's a good question. How do you feel about
p262
aVhow you spend your time each day?
p263
aVTime is one of the scarcest resources
p264
aVin the modern world.
p265
aVAnd yet, of course,
p266
aVthat little intangible piece of data
p267
aVdoesn't factor into our GDP calculations.
p268
aa(lp269
VAs I spent my week up in the Himalayas,
p270
aVI started to imagine
p271
aVwhat I call an emotional equation.
p272
aVAnd it focuses on something I read long ago
p273
aVfrom a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.
p274
aVHow many know him? Anybody?
p275
aV1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,"
p276
aVand he suggested that happiness
p277
aVis not about having what you want;
p278
aVinstead, it's about wanting what you have.
p279
aVOr in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe
p280
aVhappiness equals wanting what you have \u2014
p281
aVimagine gratitude \u2014
p282
aVdivided by having what you want \u2014
p283
aVgratification.
p284
aVThe Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,
p285
aVconstantly focused on what they don't have.
p286
aVTheir religion, their isolation,
p287
aVtheir deep respect for their culture
p288
aVand now the principles of their GNH movement
p289
aVall have fostered a sense of gratitude
p290
aVabout what they do have.
p291
aVHow many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,
p292
aVspend more of our time
p293
aVin the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?
p294
aVWe are a bottom-heavy culture
p295
aVin more ways than one.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VThe reality is, in Western countries,
p300
aVquite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness
p301
aVas if happiness is something that we have to go out \u2014
p302
aVan object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.
p303
aVActually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,
p304
aVmany dictionaries define pursuit
p305
aVas to "chase with hostility."
p306
aVDo we pursue happiness with hostility?
p307
aVGood question. But back to Bhutan.
p308
aa(lp309
VBhutan's bordered on its north and south
p310
aVby 38 percent of the world's population.
p311
aVCould this little country,
p312
aVlike a startup in a mature industry,
p313
aVbe the spark plug that influences
p314
aVa 21st century
p315
aVof middle-class in China and India?
p316
aVBhutan's created the ultimate export,
p317
aVa new global currency of well-being,
p318
aVand there are 40 countries around the world today
p319
aVthat are studying their own GNH.
p320
aVYou may have heard, this last fall
p321
aVNicolas Sarkozy in France
p322
aVannouncing the results of an 18-month study
p323
aVby two Nobel economists,
p324
aVfocusing on happiness and wellness in France.
p325
aVSarkozy suggested that
p326
aVworld leaders should stop
p327
aVmyopically focusing on GDP
p328
aVand consider a new index,
p329
aVwhat some French are calling a "joie de vivre index."
p330
aVI like it.
p331
aVCo-branding opportunities.
p332
aa(lp333
VJust three days ago, three days ago here at TED,
p334
aVwe had a simulcast of David Cameron,
p335
aVpotentially the next prime minister of the UK,
p336
aVquoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,
p337
aVRobert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968
p338
aVwhen he suggested that we're
p339
aVmyopically focused on the wrong thing
p340
aVand that GDP is a misplaced metric.
p341
aVSo it suggests that the momentum is shifting.
p342
aa(lp343
VI've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,
p344
aVand I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.
p345
aVThis is a collection of things
p346
aVthat Robert Kennedy said in that quote.
p347
aVGDP counts everything from air pollution
p348
aVto the destruction of our redwoods.
p349
aVBut it doesn't count the health of our children
p350
aVor the integrity of our public officials.
p351
aVAs you look at these two columns here,
p352
aVdoesn't it make you feel like it's time for us
p353
aVto start figuring out a new way to count,
p354
aVa new way to imagine
p355
aVwhat's important to us in life?
p356
aa(lp357
V(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VCertainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.
p360
aVHe said GDP "measures everything in short,
p361
aVexcept that which makes life worthwhile."
p362
aVWow.
p363
aVSo how do we do that?
p364
aVLet me say one thing we can just start doing
p365
aVten years from now, at least in this country.
p366
aVWhy in the heck in America
p367
aVare we doing a census in 2010?
p368
aVWe're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.
p369
aVWe're asking 10 simple questions \u2014 it is simplicity.
p370
aVBut all of those questions are tangible.
p371
aVThey're about demographics.
p372
aVThey're about where you live, how many people you live with,
p373
aVand whether you own your home or not.
p374
aVThat's about it.
p375
aVWe're not asking meaningful metrics.
p376
aVWe're not asking important questions.
p377
aVWe're not asking anything that's intangible.
p378
aa(lp379
VAbe Maslow said long ago
p380
aVsomething you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.
p381
aVHe said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,
p382
aVeverything starts to look like a nail."
p383
aVWe've been fooled by our tool.
p384
aVExcuse that expression.
p385
aV(Laughter)
p386
aVWe've been fooled by our tool.
p387
aVGDP has been our hammer.
p388
aVAnd our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century
p389
aVindustrial-era model of success.
p390
aVAnd yet, 64 percent
p391
aVof the world's GDP today
p392
aVis in that intangible industry we call service,
p393
aVthe service industry, the industry I'm in.
p394
aVAnd only 36 percent is in the tangible industries
p395
aVof manufacturing and agriculture.
p396
aVSo maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?
p397
aVMaybe it's time we get a toolbox that
p398
aVdoesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,
p399
aVbut actually counts what we most value,
p400
aVthe things that are intangible.
p401
aa(lp402
VI guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.
p403
aVI was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.
p404
aVI learned that economists measure everything
p405
aVin tangible units of production and consumption
p406
aVas if each of those tangible units
p407
aVis exactly the same.
p408
aVThey aren't the same.
p409
aVIn fact, as leaders, what we need to learn
p410
aVis that we can influence
p411
aVthe quality of that unit of production
p412
aVby creating the conditions
p413
aVfor our employees to live their calling.
p414
aVIn Vivian's case,
p415
aVher unit of production
p416
aVisn't the tangible hours she works,
p417
aVit's the intangible difference she makes
p418
aVduring that one hour of work.
p419
aa(lp420
VThis is Dave Arringdale who's actually
p421
aVbeen a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.
p422
aVHe stayed there a hundred times
p423
aVin the last 20 years,
p424
aVand he's loyal to the property because of the relationship
p425
aVthat Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.
p426
aVThey've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.
p427
aVHe tells me that he can always count
p428
aVon Vivian and the staff there
p429
aVto make him feel at home.
p430
aVWhy is it that
p431
aVbusiness leaders and investors
p432
aVquite often don't see the connection
p433
aVbetween creating the intangible
p434
aVof employee happiness
p435
aVwith creating the tangible
p436
aVof financial profits in their business?
p437
aVWe don't have to choose between
p438
aVinspired employees and sizable profits,
p439
aVwe can have both.
p440
aVIn fact, inspired employees quite often
p441
aVhelp make sizable profits, right?
p442
aa(lp443
VSo what the world needs now,
p444
aVin my opinion,
p445
aVis business leaders and political leaders
p446
aVwho know what to count.
p447
aVWe count numbers.
p448
aVWe count on people.
p449
aVWhat really counts is when we actually use our numbers
p450
aVto truly take into account our people.
p451
aVI learned that from a maid in a motel
p452
aVand a king of a country.
p453
aVWhat can you
p454
aVstart counting today?
p455
aVWhat one thing can you start counting today
p456
aVthat actually would be meaningful in your life,
p457
aVwhether it's your work life or your business life?
p458
aa(lp459
VThank you very much.

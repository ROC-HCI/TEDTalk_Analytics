VMy colleagues and I are fascinated by the science of moving dots.
p5
aVSo what are these dots?
p6
aVWell, it's all of us.
p7
aVAnd we're moving in our homes, in our offices, as we shop and travel
p8
aVthroughout our cities and around the world.
p9
aVAnd wouldn't it be great if we could understand all this movement?
p10
aVIf we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it.
p11
aVAnd luckily for us, we live in a time
p12
aVwhere we're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves.
p13
aVSo whether it's through sensors or videos, or apps,
p14
aVwe can track our movement with incredibly fine detail.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement
p17
aVis sports.
p18
aVSo whether it's basketball or baseball, or football or the other football,
p19
aVwe're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements
p20
aVevery fraction of a second.
p21
aVSo what we're doing is turning our athletes into \u2014
p22
aVyou probably guessed it \u2014
p23
aVmoving dots.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo we've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data,
p26
aVit's hard to deal with and not that interesting.
p27
aVBut there are things that, for example, basketball coaches want to know.
p28
aVAnd the problem is they can't know them because they'd have to watch every second
p29
aVof every game, remember it and process it.
p30
aVAnd a person can't do that,
p31
aVbut a machine can.
p32
aVThe problem is a machine can't see the game with the eye of a coach.
p33
aVAt least they couldn't until now.
p34
aVSo what have we taught the machine to see?
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, we started simply.
p37
aVWe taught it things like passes, shots and rebounds.
p38
aVThings that most casual fans would know.
p39
aVAnd then we moved on to things slightly more complicated.
p40
aVEvents like post-ups, and pick-and-rolls, and isolations.
p41
aVAnd if you don't know them, that's okay. Most casual players probably do.
p42
aVNow, we've gotten to a point where today, the machine understands complex events
p43
aVlike down screens and wide pins.
p44
aVBasically things only professionals know.
p45
aVSo we have taught a machine to see with the eyes of a coach.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo how have we been able to do this?
p48
aVIf I asked a coach to describe something like a pick-and-roll,
p49
aVthey would give me a description,
p50
aVand if I encoded that as an algorithm, it would be terrible.
p51
aVThe pick-and-roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players,
p52
aVtwo on offense and two on defense.
p53
aVAnd here's kind of how it goes.
p54
aVSo there's the guy on offense without the ball
p55
aVthe ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball,
p56
aVand he kind of stays there
p57
aVand they both move and stuff happens, and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo that is also an example of a terrible algorithm.
p62
aVSo, if the player who's the interferer \u2014 he's called the screener \u2014
p63
aVgoes close by, but he doesn't stop,
p64
aVit's probably not a pick-and-roll.
p65
aVOr if he does stop, but he doesn't stop close enough,
p66
aVit's probably not a pick-and-roll.
p67
aVOr, if he does go close by and he does stop
p68
aVbut they do it under the basket, it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
p69
aVOr I could be wrong, they could all be pick-and-rolls.
p70
aVIt really depends on the exact timing, the distances, the locations,
p71
aVand that's what makes it hard.
p72
aVSo, luckily, with machine learning, we can go beyond our own ability
p73
aVto describe the things we know.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo how does this work? Well, it's by example.
p76
aVSo we go to the machine and say, "Good morning, machine.
p77
aVHere are some pick-and-rolls, and here are some things that are not.
p78
aVPlease find a way to tell the difference."
p79
aVAnd the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate.
p80
aVSo if I was going to teach it the difference
p81
aVbetween an apple and orange,
p82
aVI might say, "Why don't you use color or shape?"
p83
aVAnd the problem that we're solving is, what are those things?
p84
aVWhat are the key features
p85
aVthat let a computer navigate the world of moving dots?
p86
aVSo figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location,
p87
aVdistance, timing, velocities \u2014
p88
aVthat's really the key to the science of moving dots, or as we like to call it,
p89
aVspatiotemporal pattern recognition, in academic vernacular.
p90
aVBecause the first thing is, you have to make it sound hard \u2014
p91
aVbecause it is.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe key thing is, for NBA coaches, it's not that they want to know
p94
aVwhether a pick-and-roll happened or not.
p95
aVIt's that they want to know how it happened.
p96
aVAnd why is it so important to them? So here's a little insight.
p97
aVIt turns out in modern basketball,
p98
aVthis pick-and-roll is perhaps the most important play.
p99
aVAnd knowing how to run it, and knowing how to defend it,
p100
aVis basically a key to winning and losing most games.
p101
aVSo it turns out that this dance has a great many variations
p102
aVand identifying the variations is really the thing that matters,
p103
aVand that's why we need this to be really, really good.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo, here's an example.
p106
aVThere are two offensive and two defensive players,
p107
aVgetting ready to do the pick-and-roll dance.
p108
aVSo the guy with ball can either take, or he can reject.
p109
aVHis teammate can either roll or pop.
p110
aVThe guy guarding the ball can either go over or under.
p111
aVHis teammate can either show or play up to touch, or play soft
p112
aVand together they can either switch or blitz
p113
aVand I didn't know most of these things when I started
p114
aVand it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows.
p115
aVIt would make our lives a lot easier, but it turns out movement is very messy.
p116
aVPeople wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified
p117
aVwith very high accuracy,
p118
aVboth in precision and recall, is tough
p119
aVbecause that's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you.
p120
aVAnd despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features
p121
aVwe have been able to do that.
p122
aa(lp123
VCoaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations.
p124
aVWe're at the point where almost every single contender
p125
aVfor an NBA championship this year
p126
aVis using our software, which is built on a machine that understands
p127
aVthe moving dots of basketball.
p128
aVSo not only that, we have given advice that has changed strategies
p129
aVthat have helped teams win very important games,
p130
aVand it's very exciting because you have coaches who've been in the league
p131
aVfor 30 years that are willing to take advice from a machine.
p132
aVAnd it's very exciting, it's much more than the pick-and-roll.
p133
aVOur computer started out with simple things
p134
aVand learned more and more complex things
p135
aVand now it knows so many things.
p136
aVFrankly, I don't understand much of what it does,
p137
aVand while it's not that special to be smarter than me,
p138
aVwe were wondering, can a machine know more than a coach?
p139
aVCan it know more than person could know?
p140
aVAnd it turns out the answer is yes.
p141
aa(lp142
VThe coaches want players to take good shots.
p143
aVSo if I'm standing near the basket
p144
aVand there's nobody near me, it's a good shot.
p145
aVIf I'm standing far away surrounded by defenders, that's generally a bad shot.
p146
aVBut we never knew how good "good" was, or how bad "bad" was quantitatively.
p147
aVUntil now.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo what we can do, again, using spatiotemporal features,
p150
aVwe looked at every shot.
p151
aVWe can see: Where is the shot? What's the angle to the basket?
p152
aVWhere are the defenders standing? What are their distances?
p153
aVWhat are their angles?
p154
aVFor multiple defenders, we can look at how the player's moving
p155
aVand predict the shot type.
p156
aVWe can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts
p157
aVwhat is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances?
p158
aVSo why is this important?
p159
aVWe can take something that was shooting,
p160
aVwhich was one thing before, and turn it into two things:
p161
aVthe quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter.
p162
aVSo here's a bubble chart, because what's TED without a bubble chart?
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VThose are NBA players.
p167
aVThe size is the size of the player and the color is the position.
p168
aVOn the x-axis, we have the shot probability.
p169
aVPeople on the left take difficult shots,
p170
aVon the right, they take easy shots.
p171
aVOn the [y-axis] is their shooting ability.
p172
aVPeople who are good are at the top, bad at the bottom.
p173
aVSo for example, if there was a player
p174
aVwho generally made 47 percent of their shots,
p175
aVthat's all you knew before.
p176
aVBut today, I can tell you that player takes shots that an average NBA player
p177
aVwould make 49 percent of the time,
p178
aVand they are two percent worse.
p179
aVAnd the reason that's important is that there are lots of 47s out there.
p180
aVAnd so it's really important to know
p181
aVif the 47 that you're considering giving 100 million dollars to
p182
aVis a good shooter who takes bad shots
p183
aVor a bad shooter who takes good shots.
p184
aVMachine understanding doesn't just change how we look at players,
p185
aVit changes how we look at the game.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago, in the NBA finals.
p188
aVMiami was down by three, there was 20 seconds left.
p189
aVThey were about to lose the championship.
p190
aVA gentleman named LeBron James came up and he took a three to tie.
p191
aVHe missed.
p192
aVHis teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound,
p193
aVpassed it to another teammate named Ray Allen.
p194
aVHe sank a three. It went into overtime.
p195
aVThey won the game. They won the championship.
p196
aVIt was one of the most exciting games in basketball.
p197
aVAnd our ability to know the shot probability for every player
p198
aVat every second,
p199
aVand the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second
p200
aVcan illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before.
p201
aVNow unfortunately, I can't show you that video.
p202
aVBut for you, we recreated that moment
p203
aVat our weekly basketball game about 3 weeks ago.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd we recreated the tracking that led to the insights.
p208
aVSo, here is us. This is Chinatown in Los Angeles,
p209
aVa park we play at every week,
p210
aVand that's us recreating the Ray Allen moment
p211
aVand all the tracking that's associated with it.
p212
aVSo, here's the shot.
p213
aVI'm going to show you that moment
p214
aVand all the insights of that moment.
p215
aVThe only difference is, instead of the professional players, it's us,
p216
aVand instead of a professional announcer, it's me.
p217
aVSo, bear with me.
p218
aa(lp219
VMiami.
p220
aVDown three.
p221
aVTwenty seconds left.
p222
aVJeff brings up the ball.
p223
aVJosh catches, puts up a three!

p242
aVThe crowd goes wild.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VThat's roughly how it happened.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Applause)
p249
aa(lp250
VRoughly.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aVThat moment had about a nine percent chance of happening in the NBA
p254
aVand we know that and a great many other things.
p255
aVI'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VOkay, I will! It was four.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VWay to go, Daria.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut the important thing about that video
p266
aVand the insights we have for every second of every NBA game \u2014 it's not that.
p267
aVIt's the fact you don't have to be a professional team to track movement.
p268
aVYou do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement.
p269
aa(lp270
VIn fact, it doesn't even have to be about sports because we're moving everywhere.
p271
aVWe're moving in our homes,
p272
aVin our offices,
p273
aVas we shop and we travel
p274
aVthroughout our cities
p275
aVand around our world.
p276
aVWhat will we know? What will we learn?
p277
aVPerhaps, instead of identifying pick-and-rolls,
p278
aVa machine can identify the moment and let me know
p279
aVwhen my daughter takes her first steps.
p280
aVWhich could literally be happening any second now.
p281
aa(lp282
VPerhaps we can learn to better use our buildings, better plan our cities.
p283
aVI believe that with the development of the science of moving dots,
p284
aVwe will move better, we will move smarter, we will move forward.
p285
aa(lp286
VThank you very much.

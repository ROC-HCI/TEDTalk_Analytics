VSalaam. Namaskar.
p5
aVGood morning.
p6
aVGiven my TED profile, you might be expecting
p7
aVthat I'm going to speak to you about
p8
aVthe latest philanthropic trends \u2014
p9
aVthe one that's currently got Wall Street
p10
aVand the World Bank buzzing \u2014
p11
aVhow to invest in women,
p12
aVhow to empower them, how to save them.
p13
aa(lp14
VNot me.
p15
aVI am interested in how women
p16
aVare saving us.
p17
aVThey're saving us by redefining and re-imagining
p18
aVa future that defies and blurs
p19
aVaccepted polarities,
p20
aVpolarities we've taken for granted for a long time,
p21
aVlike the ones between modernity and tradition,
p22
aVFirst World and Third World,
p23
aVoppression and opportunity.
p24
aVIn the midst of the daunting challenges
p25
aVwe face as a global community,
p26
aVthere's something about
p27
aVthis third way raga
p28
aVthat is making my heart sing.
p29
aVWhat intrigues me most
p30
aVis how women are doing this,
p31
aVdespite a set of paradoxes
p32
aVthat are both frustrating and fascinating.
p33
aa(lp34
VWhy is it that women are, on the one hand,
p35
aVviciously oppressed by cultural practices,
p36
aVand yet at the same time,
p37
aVare the preservers of cultures in most societies?
p38
aVIs the hijab or the headscarf
p39
aVa symbol of submission
p40
aVor resistance?
p41
aVWhen so many women and girls
p42
aVare beaten, raped, maimed
p43
aVon a daily basis
p44
aVin the name of all kinds of causes \u2014
p45
aVhonor, religion, nationality \u2014
p46
aVwhat allows women to replant trees,
p47
aVto rebuild societies,
p48
aVto lead radical, non-violent movements
p49
aVfor social change?
p50
aVIs it different women
p51
aVwho are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?
p52
aVOr are they one and the same?
p53
aVAre we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us
p54
aVat the TED conference in Oxford,
p55
aVof assuming that there is a single story
p56
aVof women's struggles for their rights
p57
aVwhile there are, in fact, many?
p58
aVAnd what, if anything,
p59
aVdo men have to do with it?
p60
aa(lp61
VMuch of my life has been a quest
p62
aVto get some answers to these questions.
p63
aVIt's taken me across the globe
p64
aVand introduced me to some amazing people.
p65
aVIn the process, I've gathered a few fragments
p66
aVthat help me shed some light on this puzzle.
p67
aVAmong those who've helped open my eyes
p68
aVto a third way
p69
aVare: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan,
p70
aVa group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia
p71
aVand a taboo breaker in Liberia.
p72
aVI'm indebted to them,
p73
aVas I am to my parents,
p74
aVwho for some set of misdemeanors in their last life,
p75
aVwere blessed with three daughters in this one.
p76
aVAnd for reasons equally unclear to me,
p77
aVseem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.
p78
aa(lp79
VI was born and raised here in India,
p80
aVand I learned from an early age
p81
aVto be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles
p82
aVwho would bend down, pat us on the head
p83
aVand then say to my parents
p84
aVwith no problem at all,
p85
aV"Poor things. You only have three daughters.
p86
aVBut you're young, you could still try again."
p87
aVMy sense of outrage
p88
aVabout women's rights
p89
aVwas brought to a boil when I was about 11.
p90
aVMy aunt, an incredibly articulate
p91
aVand brilliant woman,
p92
aVwas widowed early.
p93
aVA flock of relatives descended on her.
p94
aVThey took off her colorful sari.
p95
aVThey made her wear a white one.
p96
aVThey wiped her bindi off her forehead.
p97
aVThey broke her bangles.
p98
aVHer daughter, Rani,
p99
aVa few years older than me,
p100
aVsat in her lap bewildered,
p101
aVnot knowing what had happened
p102
aVto the confident woman
p103
aVshe once knew as her mother.
p104
aVLate that night, I heard my mother
p105
aVbegging my father,
p106
aV"Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?"
p107
aVAnd my father, in a low voice, muttering,
p108
aV"I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.
p109
aVThis is tradition."
p110
aVThat's the night I learned the rules
p111
aVabout what it means to be female in this world.
p112
aVWomen don't make those rules,
p113
aVbut they define us, and they define
p114
aVour opportunities and our chances.
p115
aVAnd men are affected by those rules too.
p116
aVMy father, who had fought in three wars,
p117
aVcould not save his own sister
p118
aVfrom this suffering.
p119
aa(lp120
VBy 18,
p121
aVunder the excellent tutelage of my mother,
p122
aVI was therefore, as you might expect,
p123
aVdefiantly feminist.
p124
aVOn the streets chanting,
p125
aV"[Hindi]
p126
aV[Hindi]
p127
aVWe are the women of India.
p128
aVWe are not flowers, we are sparks of change."
p129
aVBy the time I got to Beijing in 1995,
p130
aVit was clear to me, the only way
p131
aVto achieve gender equality
p132
aVwas to overturn centuries
p133
aVof oppressive tradition.
p134
aVSoon after I returned from Beijing,
p135
aVI leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization,
p136
aVfounded by women,
p137
aVto support women's rights organizations around the globe.
p138
aVBut barely six months into my new job,
p139
aVI met a woman
p140
aVwho forced me to challenge all my assumptions.
p141
aVHer name is Sakena Yacoobi.
p142
aa(lp143
VShe walked into my office
p144
aVat a time when no one knew
p145
aVwhere Afghanistan was in the United States.
p146
aVShe said to me, "It is not about the burka."
p147
aVShe was the most determined advocate
p148
aVfor women's rights I had ever heard.
p149
aVShe told me women were running underground schools
p150
aVin her communities inside Afghanistan,
p151
aVand that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning,
p152
aVhad started a school in Pakistan.
p153
aVShe said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows
p154
aVis that the Koran requires
p155
aVand strongly supports literacy.
p156
aVThe prophet wanted every believer
p157
aVto be able to read the Koran for themselves."
p158
aVHad I heard right?
p159
aVWas a women's rights advocate
p160
aVinvoking religion?
p161
aVBut Sakena defies labels.
p162
aVShe always wears a headscarf,
p163
aVbut I've walked alongside with her on a beach
p164
aVwith her long hair flying in the breeze.
p165
aVShe starts every lecture with a prayer,
p166
aVbut she's a single, feisty,
p167
aVfinancially independent woman
p168
aVin a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.
p169
aa(lp170
VShe is also immensely pragmatic.
p171
aV"This headscarf and these clothes," she says,
p172
aV"give me the freedom to do what I need to do
p173
aVto speak to those whose support and assistance
p174
aVare critical for this work.
p175
aVWhen I had to open the school in the refugee camp,
p176
aVI went to see the imam.
p177
aVI told him, 'I'm a believer, and women and children
p178
aVin these terrible conditions
p179
aVneed their faith to survive.'"
p180
aVShe smiles slyly.
p181
aV"He was flattered.
p182
aVHe began to come twice a week to my center
p183
aVbecause women could not go to the mosque.
p184
aVAnd after he would leave,
p185
aVwomen and girls would stay behind.
p186
aVWe began with a small literacy class
p187
aVto read the Koran,
p188
aVthen a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.
p189
aVIn a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp
p190
aVwas in our classes."
p191
aVSakena is a teacher
p192
aVat a time when to educate women
p193
aVis a dangerous business in Afghanistan.
p194
aa(lp195
VShe is on the Taliban's hit list.
p196
aVI worry about her every time she travels across that country.
p197
aVShe shrugs when I ask her about safety.
p198
aV"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid.
p199
aVLook at those young girls who go back to school
p200
aVwhen acid is thrown in their face."
p201
aVAnd I smile, and I nod,
p202
aVrealizing I'm watching women and girls
p203
aVusing their own religious traditions and practices,
p204
aVturning them into instruments
p205
aVof opposition and opportunity.
p206
aVTheir path is their own
p207
aVand it looks towards an Afghanistan
p208
aVthat will be different.
p209
aa(lp210
VBeing different is something the women
p211
aVof Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia
p212
aVknow all too well.
p213
aVTo be a lesbian, a dyke,
p214
aVa homosexual
p215
aVin most parts of the world, including right here
p216
aVin our country, India,
p217
aVis to occupy a place of immense discomfort
p218
aVand extreme prejudice.
p219
aVIn post-conflict societies like Croatia,
p220
aVwhere a hyper-nationalism and religiosity
p221
aVhave created an environment unbearable
p222
aVfor anyone who might
p223
aVbe considered a social outcast.
p224
aVSo enter a group of out dykes,
p225
aVyoung women who love the old music
p226
aVthat once spread across that region
p227
aVfrom Macedonia to Bosnia,
p228
aVfrom Serbia to Slovenia.
p229
aVThese folk singers met at college at a gender studies program.
p230
aVMany are in their 20s, some are mothers.
p231
aVMany have struggled to come out to their communities,
p232
aVin families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept
p233
aVthat their daughters are not sick,
p234
aVjust queer.
p235
aVAs Leah, one of the founders of the group, says,
p236
aV"I like traditional music very much.
p237
aVI also like rock and roll.
p238
aVSo Lesbor, we blend the two.
p239
aVI see traditional music like a kind of rebellion,
p240
aVin which people can really speak their voice,
p241
aVespecially traditional songs
p242
aVfrom other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.
p243
aVAfter the war, lots of these songs were lost,
p244
aVbut they are a part of our childhood and our history,
p245
aVand we should not forget them."
p246
aa(lp247
VImprobably, this LGBT singing choir
p248
aVhas demonstrated how women
p249
aVare investing in tradition to create change,
p250
aVlike alchemists turning discord into harmony.
p251
aVTheir repertoire includes
p252
aVthe Croatian national anthem,
p253
aVa Bosnian love song
p254
aVand Serbian duets.
p255
aVAnd, Leah adds with a grin,
p256
aV"Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music,
p257
aVbecause it shows we are open to religious practices
p258
aVeven though Catholic Church
p259
aVhates us LGBT."
p260
aVTheir concerts draw from
p261
aVtheir own communities, yes,
p262
aVbut also from an older generation:
p263
aVa generation that might be
p264
aVsuspicious of homosexuality,
p265
aVbut is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.
p266
aVOne father, who had initially balked at his daughter
p267
aVcoming out in such a choir,
p268
aVnow writes songs for them.
p269
aVIn the Middle Ages, troubadours
p270
aVwould travel across the land
p271
aVsinging their tales and sharing their verses:
p272
aVLesbor travels through the Balkans like this,
p273
aVsinging, connecting people divided
p274
aVby religion, nationality and language.
p275
aVBosnians, Croats and Serbs
p276
aVfind a rare shared space of pride in their history,
p277
aVand Lesbor reminds them that
p278
aVthe songs one group often claims as theirs alone
p279
aVreally belong to them all.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Singing)
p282
aa(lp283
VYesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us
p284
aVthat music can create a world
p285
aVmore accepting of difference
p286
aVthan the one we have been given.
p287
aVThe world Leymah Gbowee was given
p288
aVwas a world at war.
p289
aVLiberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.
p290
aVLeymah was not an activist, she was a mother of three.
p291
aVBut she was sick with worry:
p292
aVShe worried her son would be abducted
p293
aVand taken off to be a child soldier,
p294
aVshe worried her daughters would be raped,
p295
aVshe worried for their lives.
p296
aVOne night, she had a dream.
p297
aVShe dreamt she and thousands of other women
p298
aVended the bloodshed.
p299
aVThe next morning at church, she asked others how they felt.
p300
aVThey were all tired of the fighting.
p301
aVWe need peace, and we need our leaders to know
p302
aVwe will not rest until there is peace.
p303
aVAmong Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.
p304
aVShe promised to raise the issue with her community.
p305
aa(lp306
VAt the next Friday sermon,
p307
aVthe women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque
p308
aVbegan to share their distress at the state of affairs.
p309
aV"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish
p310
aVbetween a Muslim and a Christian."
p311
aVThis small group of women,
p312
aVdetermined to bring an end to the war,
p313
aVand they chose to use their traditions to make a point:
p314
aVLiberian women usually wear
p315
aVlots of jewelry and colorful clothing.
p316
aVBut no, for the protest, they dressed
p317
aVall in white, no makeup.
p318
aVAs Leymah said, "We wore the white
p319
aVsaying we were out for peace."
p320
aVThey stood on the side of the road on which
p321
aVCharles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.
p322
aVThey stood for weeks \u2014
p323
aVfirst just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women \u2014
p324
aVwearing white, singing, dancing,
p325
aVsaying they were out for peace.
p326
aa(lp327
VEventually, opposing forces in Liberia
p328
aVwere pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.
p329
aVThe peace talks dragged on and on and on.
p330
aVLeymah and her sisters had had enough.
p331
aVWith their remaining funds, they took
p332
aVa small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks
p333
aVand they surrounded the building.
p334
aVIn a now famous CNN clip,
p335
aVyou can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.
p336
aVWe know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].
p337
aVThen things get tense.
p338
aVThe police are called in to physically remove the women.
p339
aVAs the senior officer approaches with a baton,
p340
aVLeymah stands up with deliberation,
p341
aVreaches her arms up over her head,
p342
aVand begins, very slowly,
p343
aVto untie her headdress that covers her hair.
p344
aVYou can see the policeman's face.
p345
aVHe looks embarrassed. He backs away.
p346
aVAnd the next thing you know,
p347
aVthe police have disappeared.
p348
aVLeymah said to me later,
p349
aV"It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa.
p350
aVIf an older woman undresses in front of a man
p351
aVbecause she wants to,
p352
aVthe man's family is cursed."
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aV(Applause)
p355
aVShe said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed,
p356
aVbut he knew we were not going to leave.
p357
aVWe were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed."
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd the peace accord was signed.
p360
aVAnd the women of Liberia
p361
aVthen mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,
p362
aVa woman who broke a few taboos herself
p363
aVbecoming the first elected woman head of state
p364
aVin Africa in years.
p365
aVWhen she made her presidential address,
p366
aVshe acknowledged these brave women of Liberia
p367
aVwho allowed her to win against a football star \u2014
p368
aVthat's soccer for you Americans \u2014
p369
aVno less.
p370
aa(lp371
VWomen like Sakena and Leah
p372
aVand Leymah
p373
aVhave humbled me and changed me
p374
aVand made me realize that I should not be so quick
p375
aVto jump to assumptions of any kind.
p376
aVThey've also saved me from my righteous anger
p377
aVby offering insights into this third way.
p378
aVA Filipina activist once said to me,
p379
aV"How do you cook a rice cake?
p380
aVWith heat from the bottom and heat from the top."
p381
aVThe protests, the marches,
p382
aVthe uncompromising position that
p383
aVwomen's rights are human rights, full stop.
p384
aVThat's the heat from the bottom.
p385
aVThat's Malcolm X and the suffragists
p386
aVand gay pride parades.
p387
aVBut we also need the heat from the top.
p388
aVAnd in most parts of the world,
p389
aVthat top is still
p390
aVcontrolled by men.
p391
aa(lp392
VSo to paraphrase Marx: Women make change,
p393
aVbut not in circumstances of their own choosing.
p394
aVThey have to negotiate.
p395
aVThey have to subvert tradition that once silenced them
p396
aVin order to give voice to new aspirations.
p397
aVAnd they need allies from their communities.
p398
aVAllies like the imam,
p399
aVallies like the father who now writes songs
p400
aVfor a lesbian group in Croatia,
p401
aVallies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away,
p402
aVallies like my father,
p403
aVwho couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters
p404
aVpursue their dreams.
p405
aVMaybe this is because feminism,
p406
aVunlike almost every other social movement,
p407
aVis not a struggle against a distinct oppressor \u2014
p408
aVit's not the ruling class
p409
aVor the occupiers or the colonizers \u2014
p410
aVit's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions
p411
aVthat we women, far too often,
p412
aVhold ourselves.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism,
p415
aVthat the personal is in fact the political.
p416
aVSo that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights,
p417
aVthe same is true of gender equality:
p418
aVthat it starts in small places, close to home.
p419
aVOn the streets, yes,
p420
aVbut also in negotiations at the kitchen table
p421
aVand in the marital bed
p422
aVand in relationships between lovers and parents
p423
aVand sisters and friends.
p424
aVAnd then
p425
aVyou realize that by integrating
p426
aVaspects of tradition and community
p427
aVinto their struggles,
p428
aVwomen like Sakena and Leah and Leymah \u2014
p429
aVbut also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India
p430
aVand Michelle Bachelet in Chile
p431
aVand Shirin Ebadi in Iran \u2014
p432
aVare doing something else.
p433
aVThey're challenging the very notion
p434
aVof Western models of development.
p435
aVThey are saying, we don't have to be like you
p436
aVto make change.
p437
aVWe can wear a sari or a hijab
p438
aVor pants or a boubou,
p439
aVand we can be party leaders and presidents
p440
aVand human rights lawyers.
p441
aVWe can use our tradition to navigate change.
p442
aVWe can demilitarize societies
p443
aVand pour resources, instead,
p444
aVinto reservoirs of genuine security.
p445
aa(lp446
VIt is in these little stories,
p447
aVthese individual stories,
p448
aVthat I see a radical epic being written
p449
aVby women around the world.
p450
aVIt is in these threads
p451
aVthat are being woven into a resilient fabric
p452
aVthat will sustain communities,
p453
aVthat I find hope.
p454
aVAnd if my heart is singing,
p455
aVit's because in these little fragments,
p456
aVevery now and again, you catch a glimpse
p457
aVof a whole, of a whole new world.
p458
aVAnd she is definitely on her way.
p459
aa(lp460
VThank you.

VIt's the fifth time I stand on this shore,
p5
aVthe Cuban shore,
p6
aVlooking out at that distant horizon,
p7
aVbelieving, again,
p8
aVthat I'm going to make it all the way
p9
aVacross that vast, dangerous wilderness of an ocean.
p10
aVNot only have I tried four times,
p11
aVbut the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since 1950,
p12
aVand it's still never been done.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe team is proud of our four attempts.
p15
aVIt's an expedition of some 30 people.
p16
aVBonnie is my best friend and head handler,
p17
aVwho somehow summons will,
p18
aVthat last drop of will within me, when I think it's gone,
p19
aVafter many, many hours and days out there.
p20
aVThe shark experts are the best in the world \u2014
p21
aVlarge predators below.
p22
aVThe box jellyfish, the deadliest venom in all of the ocean,
p23
aVis in these waters,
p24
aVand I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt.
p25
aVThe conditions themselves,
p26
aVbesides the sheer distance of over 100 miles in the open ocean \u2014
p27
aVthe currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself,
p28
aVthe most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd by the way \u2014 it's amusing to me
p31
aVthat journalists and people, before these attempts, often ask me,
p32
aV"Well, are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything?"
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd I'm thinking, what are they imagining?
p37
aVThat I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation \u2014
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd carry a bowie knife in my mouth,
p42
aVand I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them,
p43
aVand maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VYes, I have a team.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd the team is expert,
p52
aVand the team is courageous,
p53
aVand brimming with innovation and scientific discovery,
p54
aVas is true of any major expedition on the planet.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd we've been on a journey.
p57
aVAnd the debate has raged, hasn't it,
p58
aVsince the Greeks,
p59
aVof isn't it what it's all about?
p60
aVIsn't life about the journey, not really the destination?
p61
aVAnd here we've been on this journey,
p62
aVand the truth is, it's been thrilling.
p63
aVWe haven't reached that other shore,
p64
aVand still, our sense of pride and commitment,
p65
aVunwavering commitment.
p66
aVWhen I turned 60, the dream was still alive
p67
aVfrom having tried this in my 20s \u2014 dreamed it and imagined it.
p68
aVThe most famous body of water on the Earth today, I imagine,
p69
aVCuba to Florida.
p70
aVAnd it was deep. It was deep in my soul.
p71
aa(lp72
VWhen I turned 60,
p73
aVit wasn't so much about the athletic accomplishment,
p74
aVit wasn't the ego of "I want to be the first."
p75
aVThat's always there and it's undeniable.
p76
aVBut it was deeper.
p77
aVIt was "how much life is there left?"
p78
aVLet's face it \u2014 we're all on a one-way street, aren't we?
p79
aVAnd what are we going to do?
p80
aVWhat are we going to do as we go forward, to have no regrets looking back?
p81
aVAnd all this past year in training,
p82
aVI had that Teddy Roosevelt quote
p83
aVto paraphrase it, floating around in my brain.
p84
aVIt says, "You go ahead.
p85
aVYou go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair
p86
aVand you be the critic, you be the observer,
p87
aVwhile the brave one gets in the ring and engages
p88
aVand gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again,
p89
aVbut yet isn't afraid and isn't timid and lives life in a bold way."
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd so of course I want to make it across.
p92
aVIt is the goal, and I should be so shallow to say that this year,
p93
aVthe destination was even sweeter than the journey.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
V(Applause)
p98
aa(lp99
VBut the journey itself was worthwhile taking.
p100
aVAnd at this point, by this summer,
p101
aVeverybody \u2014 scientists, sports scientists,
p102
aVendurance experts, neurologists,
p103
aVmy own team, Bonnie \u2014
p104
aVsaid it's impossible.
p105
aVIt just simply can't be done, and Bonnie said to me,
p106
aV"But if you're going to take the journey,
p107
aVI'm going to see you through to the end of it,
p108
aVso I'll be there."
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd now we're there.
p111
aVAs we're looking out, kind of a surreal moment
p112
aVbefore the first stroke,
p113
aVstanding on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,
p114
aVthe Cuban flag is flying above,
p115
aVall my team is out in their boats, hands up in the air,
p116
aV"We're here!
p117
aVWe're here for you!"
p118
aVBonnie and I look at each other and say,
p119
aVthis year, the mantra is \u2014 and I've been using it in training \u2014
p120
aVFind a way.
p121
aVYou have a dream
p122
aVand you have obstacles in front of you, as we all do.
p123
aVNone of us ever get through this life
p124
aVwithout heartache,
p125
aVwithout turmoil,
p126
aVand if you believe and you have faith
p127
aVand you can get knocked down and get back up again
p128
aVand you believe in perseverance
p129
aVas a great human quality,
p130
aVyou find your way.
p131
aVAnd Bonnie grabbed my shoulders,
p132
aVand she said, "Let's find our way to Florida."
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd we started, and for the next 53 hours,
p135
aVit was an intense, unforgettable life experience.
p136
aVThe highs were high, the awe \u2014
p137
aVI'm not a religious person, but I'll tell you,
p138
aVto be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream
p139
aVas if, as you're breathing,
p140
aVyou're looking down miles and miles and miles,
p141
aVto feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on \u2014
p142
aVit's awe-inspiring.
p143
aVI have a playlist of about 85 songs,
p144
aVand especially in the middle of the night ...
p145
aVThat night, because we use no lights \u2014 lights attract jellyfish,
p146
aVlights attract sharks,
p147
aVlights attract baitfish that attract sharks,
p148
aVso we go in the pitch black of the night.
p149
aVYou've never seen black this black.
p150
aVYou can't see the front of your hand,
p151
aVand the people on the boat, Bonnie and my team on the boat \u2014
p152
aVthey just hear the slapping of the arms,
p153
aVand they know where I am,
p154
aVbecause there's no visual at all.
p155
aVAnd I'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VI've got tight rubber caps, I don't hear a thing.
p160
aVI've got goggles and I'm turning my head 50 times a minute,
p161
aVand I'm singing ...
p162
aa(lp163
V(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
Vdoo doo doo doo doo
p168
aVIt's easy if you try
p169
aVdoo doo doo doo doo
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd I can sing that song a thousand times in a row.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VNow there's a talent unto itself.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
V(Applause)
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd each time I get done with,
p182
aa(lp183
V(Singing) Oh, you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one
p184
aa(lp185
V222.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd when I get through the end
p192
aVof a thousand of John Lennon's "Imagine,"
p193
aVI have swum nine hours and 45 minutes ...
p194
aVexactly.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd then there are the crises.
p199
aVOf course there are.
p200
aVAnd the vomiting starts, the seawater \u2014 you're not well.
p201
aVYou're wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection.
p202
aVIt's difficult to swim in.
p203
aVIt's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth,
p204
aVbut the tentacles can't get you.
p205
aVAnd the hypothermia sets in.
p206
aVThe water's 85 degrees, and yet you're losing weight
p207
aVand using calories.
p208
aVAnd as you come over toward the side of the boat \u2014
p209
aVnot allowed to touch it, not allowed to get out,
p210
aVbut Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition
p211
aVand ask me how I'm doing, am I all right.
p212
aVI am seeing the Taj Mahal \u2014
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VOver here.
p217
aVI'm in a very different state \u2014
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd I'm thinking, "Wow!
p222
aVI never thought I'd be running into the Taj Mahal out here.
p223
aVIt's gorgeous!
p224
aVI mean, how long did it take them to build that?
p225
aVIt's just ...
p226
aVSo, uh \u2014 wooo \u2014 you know?
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VWe kind of have a cardinal rule
p231
aVthat I'm never told how far it is, because we don't know how far it is.
p232
aVWhat's going to happen to you between this point and that point?
p233
aVWhat's going to happen to the weather and the currents
p234
aVand, God forbid, you're stung,
p235
aVwhen you don't think you could be stung in all this armor.
p236
aVBonnie made a decision coming into that third morning
p237
aVthat I was suffering,
p238
aVand I was hanging on by a thread.
p239
aVAnd she said, "Come here,"
p240
aVand I came close to the boat, and she said,
p241
aV"Look, look out there."
p242
aVAnd I saw light,
p243
aVbecause the day is easier than the night,
p244
aVand I thought we were coming into day.
p245
aVI saw a stream of white light along the horizon,
p246
aVand I said, "It's going to be morning soon."
p247
aVAnd she said, "No, those are the lights of Key West."
p248
aVIt was 15 more hours,
p249
aVwhich for most swimmers would be a long time.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
V(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VYou have no idea how many 15-hour training swims I had done.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo here we go, and I somehow, without a decision,
p258
aVwent into no counting of strokes
p259
aVand no singing
p260
aVand no quoting Stephen Hawking on the parameters of the universe.
p261
aVI just went into thinking about this dream, and why and how.
p262
aVAs I said, when I turned 60,
p263
aVit wasn't about that concrete "Can you do it?"
p264
aVThat's the everyday machinations.
p265
aVThat's the discipline, and it's the preparation,
p266
aVand there's a pride in that.
p267
aVBut I decided to think, as I went along,
p268
aVabout \u2014 you know, the phrase usually is, "reaching for the stars."
p269
aVAnd in my case, it's reaching for the horizon.
p270
aVAnd when you reach for the horizon,
p271
aVas I've proven, you may not get there.
p272
aVBut what a tremendous build of character and spirit
p273
aVthat you lay down;
p274
aVwhat a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd now, the shore is coming.
p277
aVAnd there's just a little part of me that's sad.
p278
aVThe epic journey is going to be over.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo many people come up to me now and say,
p281
aV"What's next?"
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
V"We love that!"
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
V"That little tracker on the computer?
p290
aVWhen are you going to do the next one?
p291
aVWe can't wait to follow the next one."
p292
aVWell, they were just there for 53 hours,
p293
aVand I was there for years.
p294
aVAnd so there won't be another epic journey in the ocean.
p295
aa(lp296
VBut the point is, and the point was,
p297
aVthat every day of our lives is epic.
p298
aVAnd I'll tell you, when I walked up onto that beach,
p299
aVstaggered up onto that beach ...
p300
aVI had so many times, in a very puffed-up ego way,
p301
aVrehearsed what I would say ...
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
Von the beach.
p306
aVWhen Bonnie thought the back of my throat was swelling up,
p307
aVshe brought the medical team over to our boat
p308
aVto say, "She's really beginning to have trouble breathing;
p309
aVanother 12, 24 hours in the saltwater ..." \u2014
p310
aVthe whole thing \u2014 I just thought, in my hallucinatory moment,
p311
aVthat I heard the word "tracheotomy."
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VBonnie said to the doctor, "I'm not worried about her not breathing.
p316
aVIf she can't talk when she gets to the shore,
p317
aVshe's going to be pissed off."
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VBut the truth is, all those orations that I had practiced,
p322
aVjust to get myself through some training swims as motivation \u2014
p323
aVit wasn't like that.
p324
aVIt was a very real moment,
p325
aVwith that crowd, with my team.
p326
aVWe did it. I didn't do it. We did it.
p327
aVAnd we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us.
p328
aa(lp329
VThe three things I did sort of blurt out when we got there, was first:
p330
aVNever, ever give up.
p331
aVI live it.
p332
aVWhat's the phrase from today from Socrates?
p333
aa(lp334
VAudience: To be is to do.
p335
aa(lp336
VDiana Nyad: To be is to do.
p337
aVSo I don't stand up and say, "Don't ever give up."
p338
aVI didn't give up.
p339
aVThere was action behind these words.
p340
aa(lp341
VThe second is:
p342
aVYou can chase your dreams at any age; you're never too old.
p343
aVSixty-four; a thing no one, at any age, any gender, could ever do
p344
aVhas done it.
p345
aVAnd there's no doubt in my mind
p346
aVthat I am at the prime of my life today.
p347
aa(lp348
V(Applause)
p349
aa(lp350
VYeah.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Applause)
p353
aa(lp354
VThank you.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd the third thing I said on that beach was,
p357
aVit looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world,
p358
aVand in many ways, of course, it is.
p359
aVAnd in other ways, and the most important ways,
p360
aVit's a team.
p361
aVAnd if you think I'm a badass, you want to meet Bonnie.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
VBonnie, where are you?
p366
aVWhere are you?
p367
aVThere's Bonnie Stoll.
p368
aa(lp369
V(Applause)
p370
aa(lp371
VMy buddy.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Applause)
p374
aa(lp375
VThe Henry David Thoreau quote goes,
p376
aV"When you achieve your dreams, it's not so much what you get
p377
aVas who you have become in achieving them."
p378
aVAnd yeah, I stand before you now.
p379
aVIn the three months since that swim ended,
p380
aVI've sat down with Oprah,
p381
aVand I've been in President Obama's Oval Office;
p382
aVI've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups
p383
aVsuch as yourselves;
p384
aVI've signed a wonderful major book contract.
p385
aVAll of that's great, and I don't denigrate it.
p386
aVI'm proud of it all, but the truth is,
p387
aVI'm walking around tall
p388
aVbecause I am that bold, fearless person, and I will be, every day,
p389
aVuntil it's time for these days to be done.
p390
aa(lp391
VThank you very much and enjoy the conference.
p392
aa(lp393
VThank you. Thank you!
p394
aa(lp395
V(Applause)
p396
aa(lp397
VThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Applause)
p400
aa(lp401
VFind a way!

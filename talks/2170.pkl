VMy students and I work on very tiny robots.
p5
aVNow, you can think of these as robotic versions
p6
aVof something that you're all very familiar with: an ant.
p7
aVWe all know that ants and other insects at this size scale
p8
aVcan do some pretty incredible things.
p9
aVWe've all seen a group of ants, or some version of that,
p10
aVcarting off your potato chip at a picnic, for example.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut what are the real challenges of engineering these ants?
p13
aVWell, first of all, how do we get the capabilities of an ant
p14
aVin a robot at the same size scale?
p15
aVWell, first we need to figure out how to make them move
p16
aVwhen they're so small.
p17
aVWe need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors
p18
aVin order to support that locomotion,
p19
aVand we need the sensors, power and control
p20
aVin order to pull everything together in a semi-intelligent ant robot.
p21
aVAnd finally, to make these things really functional,
p22
aVwe want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo I'll start with mobility.
p25
aVInsects move around amazingly well.
p26
aVThis video is from UC Berkeley.
p27
aVIt shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain
p28
aVwithout tipping over,
p29
aVand it's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials,
p30
aVwhich is what we traditionally use to make robots,
p31
aVand soft materials.
p32
aVJumping is another really interesting way to get around when you're very small.
p33
aVSo these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly
p34
aVto get the high power they need to jump out of water, for example.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo one of the big contributions from my lab
p37
aVhas been to combine rigid and soft materials
p38
aVin very, very small mechanisms.
p39
aVSo this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side,
p40
aVso really tiny.
p41
aVThe hard material here is silicon, and the soft material is silicone rubber.
p42
aVAnd the basic idea is that we're going to compress this,
p43
aVstore energy in the springs, and then release it to jump.
p44
aVSo there's no motors on board this right now, no power.
p45
aVThis is actuated with a method that we call in my lab
p46
aV"graduate student with tweezers." (Laughter)
p47
aVSo what you'll see in the next video
p48
aVis this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps.
p49
aVSo this is Aaron, the graduate student in question, with the tweezers,
p50
aVand what you see is this  four-millimeter-sized mechanism
p51
aVjumping almost 40 centimeters high.
p52
aVThat's almost 100 times its own length.
p53
aVAnd it survives, bounces on the table,
p54
aVit's incredibly robust, and of course survives quite well until we lose it
p55
aVbecause it's very tiny.
p56
aa(lp57
VUltimately, though, we want to add motors to this too,
p58
aVand we have students in the lab working on millimeter-sized motors
p59
aVto eventually integrate onto small, autonomous robots.
p60
aVBut in order to look at mobility and locomotion at this size scale to start,
p61
aVwe're cheating and using magnets.
p62
aVSo this shows what would eventually be part of a micro-robot leg,
p63
aVand you can see the silicone rubber joints
p64
aVand there's an embedded magnet that's being moved around
p65
aVby an external magnetic field.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier.
p68
aVThe really interesting thing that this robot can help us figure out
p69
aVis how insects move at this scale.
p70
aVWe have a really good model for how everything
p71
aVfrom a cockroach up to an elephant moves.
p72
aVWe all move in this  kind of bouncy way when we run.
p73
aVBut when I'm really small,  the forces between my feet and the ground
p74
aVare going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass,
p75
aVwhich is what causes that bouncy motion.
p76
aVSo this guy doesn't work quite yet,
p77
aVbut we do have slightly larger versions that do run around.
p78
aVSo this is about a centimeter cubed, a centimeter on a side, so very tiny,
p79
aVand we've gotten this to run about 10 body lengths per second,
p80
aVso 10 centimeters per second.
p81
aVIt's pretty quick for a little, small guy,
p82
aVand that's really only limited  by our test setup.
p83
aVBut this gives you some idea of how it works right now.
p84
aVWe can also make 3D-printed versions  of this that can climb over obstacles,
p85
aVa lot like the cockroach that you saw earlier.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot.
p88
aVWe want sensing, power, control, actuation all together,
p89
aVand not everything needs to be bio-inspired.
p90
aVSo this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac.
p91
aVAnd in this case, instead of magnets or muscles to move this around,
p92
aVwe use rockets.
p93
aVSo this is a micro-fabricated energetic material,
p94
aVand we can create tiny pixels of this,
p95
aVand we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot,
p96
aVand this robot, then, is going to jump when it senses an increase in light.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo the next video is one of my favorites.
p99
aVSo you have this 300-milligram robot
p100
aVjumping about eight centimeters in the air.
p101
aVIt's only four by four by seven millimeters in size.
p102
aVAnd you'll see a big flash at the beginning
p103
aVwhen the energetic is set off,
p104
aVand the robot tumbling through the air.
p105
aVSo there was that big flash,
p106
aVand you can see the robot jumping up through the air.
p107
aVSo there's no tethers on this, no wires connecting to this.
p108
aVEverything is onboard, and it jumped in response
p109
aVto the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I think you can imagine all the cool things that we could do
p112
aVwith robots that can run and crawl and jump and roll at this size scale.
p113
aVImagine the rubble that you get after  a natural disaster like an earthquake.
p114
aVImagine these small robots running through that rubble
p115
aVto look for survivors.
p116
aVOr imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge
p117
aVin order to inspect it and make sure it's safe
p118
aVso you don't get collapses like this,
p119
aVwhich happened outside of  Minneapolis in 2007.
p120
aVOr just imagine what you could do
p121
aVif you had robots that could swim through your blood.
p122
aVRight? "Fantastic Voyage," Isaac Asimov.
p123
aVOr they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place.
p124
aVOr we could radically change the way we build things
p125
aVif we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do,
p126
aVand they build these incredible eight-meter-high mounds,
p127
aVeffectively well ventilated apartment buildings for other termites
p128
aVin Africa and Australia.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo I think I've given you some of the possibilities
p131
aVof what we can do with these small robots.
p132
aVAnd we've made some advances so far, but there's still a long way to go,
p133
aVand hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination.
p134
aa(lp135
VThanks very much.

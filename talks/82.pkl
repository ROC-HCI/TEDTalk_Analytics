VI got a visit almost exactly a year ago,
p5
aVa little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.
p6
aVCame to see me and said, "1,600 of the kids that we've sent out
p7
aVhave come back missing at least one full arm.
p8
aVWhole arm. Shoulder disarticulation.
p9
aVAnd we're doing the same thing we did for \u2014 more or less,
p10
aVthat we've done since the Civil War, a stick and a hook.
p11
aVAnd they deserve more than that."
p12
aVAnd literally, this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said,
p13
aV"I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids
p14
aVthat'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table,
p15
aVthey'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one,
p16
aVand they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it."
p17
aVYou know, had efferent, afferent, and haptic response.
p18
aa(lp19
VHe finishes explaining that, and I'm waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal,
p20
aVand he said, "That's what I want from you."
p21
aVI said, "Look, you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now.
p22
aVAnd it can't be done.
p23
aVNot in an envelope of a human arm,
p24
aVwith 21 degrees of freedom, from your shoulder to your fingertips."
p25
aVHe said, "About two dozen of these 1,600 kids have come back bilateral.
p26
aVYou think it's bad to lose one arm?
p27
aVThat's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone."
p28
aVI got a day job,
p29
aVand my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like,
p30
aVlet's supply water to the world, and power to the world, and educate all the kids,
p31
aVwhich, Chris, I will not talk about. I don't need another mission.
p32
aa(lp33
VI keep thinking about these kids with no arms.
p34
aVHe says to me, "We've done some work around the country.
p35
aVWe've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people."
p36
aVI said, "I'll take a field trip, I'll go see what you got."
p37
aVOver the next month I visited lots of places, some out here, around the country,
p38
aVfound the best of the best.
p39
aVI went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said,
p40
aV"I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there.
p41
aVI still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought."
p42
aa(lp43
VI put a team together, a little over 13 months ago,
p44
aVgot up to 20 some-odd people.
p45
aVWe said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.
p46
aVWe have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom;
p47
aVyou don't need the ones in the last two fingers.
p48
aVWe put this thing together.
p49
aVA couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed,
p50
aVwhich is unfortunately more in the news these days.
p51
aVWe showed it to a bunch of guys.
p52
aVOne guy who described himself as being lucky,
p53
aVbecause he lost his left arm, and he's a righty.
p54
aVHe sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys.
p55
aVSaid he was lucky, because he had his good arm,
p56
aVand then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs.
p57
aVThese kids have attitudes that you just can't believe.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it,
p60
aVa 30-second piece, and then I'm done.
p61
aVBut understand what you're looking at
p62
aVwe made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female,
p63
aVso that we could put it in any of these people.
p64
aVIt's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and
p65
aVMRIs of whatever is their good arm,
p66
aVto make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D \u2014
p67
aVexact mirror image of their other limb.
p68
aVSo, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators,
p69
aVeach one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure.
p70
aVIt also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on,
p71
aVso the more they put themselves under load, the more it attaches.
p72
aVThey take the load off, and it becomes, again, compliant.
p73
aVI'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this
p74
aVthat we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing?
p75
aa(lp76
VWatch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist.
p77
aVThis weighs 6.9 pounds.
p78
aVGoing to scratch his nose.
p79
aVIt's got 14 active degrees of freedom.
p80
aVNow he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.
p81
aVNow he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper,
p82
aVrotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.
p83
aV(Applause)

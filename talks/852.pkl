VFor me, this story begins about 15 years ago,
p5
aVwhen I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago.
p6
aVAnd I was taking care of people who were dying and their families
p7
aVin the South Side of Chicago.
p8
aVAnd I was observing what happened to people and their families
p9
aVover the course of their terminal illness.
p10
aVAnd in my lab, I was studying the widower effect,
p11
aVwhich is a very old idea in the social sciences,
p12
aVgoing back 150 years,
p13
aVknown as "dying of a broken heart."
p14
aVSo, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double,
p15
aVfor instance, in the first year.
p16
aVAnd I had gone to take care of one particular patient,
p17
aVa woman who was dying of dementia.
p18
aVAnd in this case, unlike this couple,
p19
aVshe was being cared for
p20
aVby her daughter.
p21
aVAnd the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother.
p22
aVAnd the daughter's husband,
p23
aVhe also was sick
p24
aVfrom his wife's exhaustion.
p25
aVAnd I was driving home one day,
p26
aVand I get a phone call from the husband's friend,
p27
aVcalling me because he was depressed
p28
aVabout what was happening to his friend.
p29
aVSo here I get this call from this random guy
p30
aVthat's having an experience
p31
aVthat's being influenced by people
p32
aVat some social distance.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd so I suddenly realized two very simple things:
p35
aVFirst, the widowhood effect
p36
aVwas not restricted to husbands and wives.
p37
aVAnd second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.
p38
aVAnd I started to see the world
p39
aVin a whole new way,
p40
aVlike pairs of people connected to each other.
p41
aVAnd then I realized that these individuals
p42
aVwould be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.
p43
aVAnd then, in fact, these people
p44
aVwere embedded in other sorts of relationships:
p45
aVmarriage and spousal
p46
aVand friendship and other sorts of ties.
p47
aVAnd that, in fact, these connections were vast
p48
aVand that we were all embedded in this
p49
aVbroad set of connections with each other.
p50
aVSo I started to see the world in a completely new way
p51
aVand I became obsessed with this.
p52
aVI became obsessed with how it might be
p53
aVthat we're embedded in these social networks,
p54
aVand how they affect our lives.
p55
aVSo, social networks are these intricate things of beauty,
p56
aVand they're so elaborate and so complex
p57
aVand so ubiquitous, in fact,
p58
aVthat one has to ask what purpose they serve.
p59
aVWhy are we embedded in social networks?
p60
aVI mean, how do they form? How do they operate?
p61
aVAnd how do they effect us?
p62
aa(lp63
VSo my first topic with respect to this,
p64
aVwas not death, but obesity.
p65
aVIt had become trendy
p66
aVto speak about the "obesity epidemic."
p67
aVAnd, along with my collaborator, James Fowler,
p68
aVwe began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic
p69
aVand could it spread from person to person
p70
aVlike the four people I discussed earlier.
p71
aVSo this is a slide of some of our initial results.
p72
aVIt's 2,200 people in the year 2000.
p73
aVEvery dot is a person. We make the dot size
p74
aVproportional to people's body size;
p75
aVso bigger dots are bigger people.
p76
aVIn addition, if your body size,
p77
aVif your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 \u2014
p78
aVif you're clinically obese \u2014
p79
aVwe also colored the dots yellow.
p80
aVSo, if you look at this image, right away you might be able to see
p81
aVthat there are clusters of obese and
p82
aVnon-obese people in the image.
p83
aVBut the visual complexity is still very high.
p84
aVIt's not obvious exactly what's going on.
p85
aVIn addition, some questions are immediately raised:
p86
aVHow much clustering is there?
p87
aVIs there more clustering than would be due to chance alone?
p88
aVHow big are the clusters? How far do they reach?
p89
aVAnd, most importantly,
p90
aVwhat causes the clusters?
p91
aa(lp92
VSo we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters.
p93
aVThis here shows, on the Y-axis,
p94
aVthe increase in the probability that a person is obese
p95
aVgiven that a social contact of theirs is obese
p96
aVand, on the X-axis, the degrees of separation between the two people.
p97
aVOn the far left, you see the purple line.
p98
aVIt says that, if your friends are obese,
p99
aVyour risk of obesity is 45 percent higher.
p100
aVAnd the next bar over, the [red] line,
p101
aVsays if your friend's friends are obese,
p102
aVyour risk of obesity is 25 percent higher.
p103
aVAnd then the next line over says
p104
aVif your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese,
p105
aVyour risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.
p106
aVAnd it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends
p107
aVthat there's no longer a relationship
p108
aVbetween that person's body size and your own body size.
p109
aa(lp110
VWell, what might be causing this clustering?
p111
aVThere are at least three possibilities:
p112
aVOne possibility is that, as I gain weight,
p113
aVit causes you to gain weight.
p114
aVA kind of induction, a kind of spread from person to person.
p115
aVAnother possibility, very obvious, is homophily,
p116
aVor, birds of a feather flock together;
p117
aVhere, I form my tie to you
p118
aVbecause you and I share a similar body size.
p119
aVAnd the last possibility is what is known as confounding,
p120
aVbecause it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.
p121
aVAnd here, the idea is not that my weight gain
p122
aVis causing your weight gain,
p123
aVnor that I preferentially form a tie with you
p124
aVbecause you and I share the same body size,
p125
aVbut rather that we share a common exposure
p126
aVto something, like a health club
p127
aVthat makes us both lose weight at the same time.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhen we studied these data, we found evidence for all of these things,
p130
aVincluding for induction.
p131
aVAnd we found that if your friend becomes obese,
p132
aVit increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent
p133
aVin the same given time period.
p134
aVThere can be many mechanisms for this effect:
p135
aVOne possibility is that your friends say to you something like \u2014
p136
aVyou know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you \u2014
p137
aVlike, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer,"
p138
aVwhich is a terrible combination. (Laughter)
p139
aVBut you adopt that combination,
p140
aVand then you start gaining weight like them.
p141
aVAnother more subtle possibility
p142
aVis that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas
p143
aVof what an acceptable body size is.
p144
aVHere, what's spreading from person to person
p145
aVis not a behavior, but rather a norm:
p146
aVAn idea is spreading.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, headline writers
p149
aVhad a field day with our studies.
p150
aVI think the headline in The New York Times was,
p151
aV"Are you packing it on?
p152
aVBlame your fat friends." (Laughter)
p153
aVWhat was interesting to us is that the European headline writers
p154
aVhad a different take: They said,
p155
aV"Are your friends gaining weight? Perhaps you are to blame."
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVAnd we thought this was a very interesting comment on America,
p158
aVand a kind of self-serving,
p159
aV"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow, I want to be very clear: We do not think our work
p162
aVshould or could justify prejudice
p163
aVagainst people of one or another body size at all.
p164
aVOur next questions was:
p165
aVCould we actually visualize this spread?
p166
aVWas weight gain in one person actually spreading
p167
aVto weight gain in another person?
p168
aVAnd this was complicated because
p169
aVwe needed to take into account the fact that the network structure,
p170
aVthe architecture of the ties, was changing across time.
p171
aVIn addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic,
p172
aVthere's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic \u2014
p173
aVif we find that guy, there was a spread of obesity out from him \u2014
p174
aVit's a multicentric epidemic.
p175
aVLots of people are doing things at the same time.
p176
aVAnd I'm about to show you a 30 second video animation
p177
aVthat took me and James five years of our lives to do.
p178
aVSo, again, every dot is a person.
p179
aVEvery tie between them is a relationship.
p180
aVWe're going to put this into motion now,
p181
aVtaking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe dot sizes are going to grow,
p184
aVyou're going to see a sea of yellow take over.
p185
aVYou're going to see people be born and die \u2014
p186
aVdots will appear and disappear \u2014
p187
aVties will form and break, marriages and divorces,
p188
aVfriendings and defriendings.
p189
aVA lot of complexity, a lot is happening
p190
aVjust in this 30-year period
p191
aVthat includes the obesity epidemic.
p192
aVAnd, by the end, you're going to see clusters
p193
aVof obese and non-obese individuals
p194
aVwithin the network.
p195
aVNow, when looked at this,
p196
aVit changed the way I see things,
p197
aVbecause this thing, this network
p198
aVthat's changing across time,
p199
aVit has a memory, it moves,
p200
aVthings flow within it,
p201
aVit has a kind of consistency \u2014
p202
aVpeople can die, but it doesn't die;
p203
aVit still persists \u2014
p204
aVand it has a kind of resilience
p205
aVthat allows it to persist across time.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd so, I came to see these kinds of social networks
p208
aVas living things,
p209
aVas living things that we could put under a kind of microscope
p210
aVto study and analyze and understand.
p211
aVAnd we used a variety of techniques to do this.
p212
aVAnd we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.
p213
aVWe looked at smoking and drinking behavior,
p214
aVand voting behavior,
p215
aVand divorce \u2014 which can spread \u2014
p216
aVand altruism.
p217
aVAnd, eventually, we became interested in emotions.
p218
aVNow, when we have emotions,
p219
aVwe show them.
p220
aVWhy do we show our emotions?
p221
aVI mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing
p222
aVour emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness.
p223
aVBut we don't just experience them, we show them.
p224
aVAnd not only do we show them, but others can read them.
p225
aVAnd, not only can they read them, but they copy them.
p226
aVThere's emotional contagion
p227
aVthat takes place in human populations.
p228
aVAnd so this function of emotions
p229
aVsuggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve,
p230
aVthey're a kind of primitive form of communication.
p231
aVAnd that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions,
p232
aVwe need to think about them in this way.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow, we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way,
p235
aVin simple, sort of, brief periods of time.
p236
aVSo, for example,
p237
aVI was giving this talk recently in New York City,
p238
aVand I said, "You know when you're on the subway
p239
aVand the other person across the subway car
p240
aVsmiles at you,
p241
aVand you just instinctively smile back?"
p242
aVAnd they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City." (Laughter)
p243
aVAnd I said, "Everywhere else in the world,
p244
aVthat's normal human behavior."
p245
aVAnd so there's a very instinctive way
p246
aVin which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.
p247
aVAnd, in fact, emotional contagion can be broader still.
p248
aVLike we could have punctuated expressions of anger,
p249
aVas in riots.
p250
aVThe question that we wanted to ask was:
p251
aVCould emotion spread,
p252
aVin a more sustained way than riots, across time
p253
aVand involve large numbers of people,
p254
aVnot just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car?
p255
aVMaybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot
p256
aVthat animates us all the time.
p257
aVMaybe there are emotional stampedes
p258
aVthat ripple through social networks.
p259
aVMaybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence,
p260
aVnot just an individual existence.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon.
p263
aVAgain, a social network,
p264
aVbut now we color the people yellow if they're happy
p265
aVand blue if they're sad and green in between.
p266
aVAnd if you look at this image, you can right away see
p267
aVclusters of happy and unhappy people,
p268
aVagain, spreading to three degrees of separation.
p269
aVAnd you might form the intuition
p270
aVthat the unhappy people
p271
aVoccupy a different structural location within the network.
p272
aVThere's a middle and an edge to this network,
p273
aVand the unhappy people seem to be
p274
aVlocated at the edges.
p275
aVSo to invoke another metaphor,
p276
aVif you imagine social networks as a kind of
p277
aVvast fabric of humanity \u2014
p278
aVI'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance \u2014
p279
aVthis fabric is actually like
p280
aVan old-fashioned American quilt,
p281
aVand it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.
p282
aVAnd whether you become happy or not
p283
aVdepends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VSo, this work with emotions,
p288
aVwhich are so fundamental,
p289
aVthen got us to thinking about: Maybe
p290
aVthe fundamental causes of human social networks
p291
aVare somehow encoded in our genes.
p292
aVBecause human social networks, whenever they are mapped,
p293
aValways kind of look like this:
p294
aVthe picture of the network.
p295
aVBut they never look like this.
p296
aVWhy do they not look like this?
p297
aVWhy don't we form human social networks
p298
aVthat look like a regular lattice?
p299
aVWell, the striking patterns of human social networks,
p300
aVtheir ubiquity and their apparent purpose
p301
aVbeg questions about whether we evolved to have
p302
aVhuman social networks in the first place,
p303
aVand whether we evolved to form networks
p304
aVwith a particular structure.
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd notice first of all \u2014 so, to understand this, though,
p307
aVwe need to dissect network structure a little bit first \u2014
p308
aVand notice that every person in this network
p309
aVhas exactly the same structural location as every other person.
p310
aVBut that's not the case with real networks.
p311
aVSo, for example, here is a real network of college students
p312
aVat an elite northeastern university.
p313
aVAnd now I'm highlighting a few dots.
p314
aVIf you look here at the dots,
p315
aVcompare node B in the upper left
p316
aVto node D in the far right;
p317
aVB has four friends coming out from him
p318
aVand D has six friends coming out from him.
p319
aVAnd so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends.
p320
aVThat's very obvious, we all know that.
p321
aVBut certain other aspects
p322
aVof social network structure are not so obvious.
p323
aa(lp324
VCompare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left.
p325
aVNow, those people both have four friends,
p326
aVbut A's friends all know each other,
p327
aVand B's friends do not.
p328
aVSo the friend of a friend of A's
p329
aVis, back again, a friend of A's,
p330
aVwhereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's,
p331
aVbut is farther away in the network.
p332
aVThis is known as transitivity in networks.
p333
aVAnd, finally, compare nodes C and D:
p334
aVC and D both have six friends.
p335
aVIf you talk to them, and you said, "What is your social life like?"
p336
aVthey would say, "I've got six friends.
p337
aVThat's my social experience."
p338
aVBut now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network,
p339
aVcan see that they occupy very different social worlds.
p340
aVAnd I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you:
p341
aVWho would you rather be
p342
aVif a deadly germ was spreading through the network?
p343
aVWould you rather be C or D?
p344
aVYou'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.
p345
aVAnd now who would you rather be
p346
aVif a juicy piece of gossip \u2014 not about you \u2014
p347
aVwas spreading through the network? (Laughter)
p348
aVNow, you would rather be C.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo different structural locations
p351
aVhave different implications for your life.
p352
aVAnd, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this,
p353
aVwhat we found is that 46 percent of the variation
p354
aVin how many friends you have
p355
aVis explained by your genes.
p356
aVAnd this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy
p357
aVand some are born gregarious. That's obvious.
p358
aVBut we also found some non-obvious things.
p359
aVFor instance, 47 percent in the variation
p360
aVin whether your friends know each other
p361
aVis attributable to your genes.
p362
aVWhether your friends know each other
p363
aVhas not just to do with their genes, but with yours.
p364
aVAnd we think the reason for this is that some people
p365
aVlike to introduce their friends to each other \u2014 you know who you are \u2014
p366
aVand others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other.
p367
aVAnd so some people knit together the networks around them,
p368
aVcreating a kind of dense web of ties
p369
aVin which they're comfortably embedded.
p370
aVAnd finally, we even found that
p371
aV30 percent of the variation
p372
aVin whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network
p373
aVcan also be attributed to their genes.
p374
aVSo whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge
p375
aVis also partially heritable.
p376
aa(lp377
VNow, what is the point of this?
p378
aVHow does this help us understand?
p379
aVHow does this help us
p380
aVfigure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days?
p381
aVWell, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value.
p382
aVThey are a kind of social capital.
p383
aVNew properties emerge
p384
aVbecause of our embeddedness in social networks,
p385
aVand these properties inhere
p386
aVin the structure of the networks,
p387
aVnot just in the individuals within them.
p388
aVSo think about these two common objects.
p389
aVThey're both made of carbon,
p390
aVand yet one of them has carbon atoms in it
p391
aVthat are arranged in one particular way \u2014 on the left \u2014
p392
aVand you get graphite, which is soft and dark.
p393
aVBut if you take the same carbon atoms
p394
aVand interconnect them a different way,
p395
aVyou get diamond, which is clear and hard.
p396
aVAnd those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness
p397
aVdo not reside in the carbon atoms;
p398
aVthey reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms,
p399
aVor at least arise because of the
p400
aVinterconnections between the carbon atoms.
p401
aVSo, similarly, the pattern of connections among people
p402
aVconfers upon the groups of people
p403
aVdifferent properties.
p404
aVIt is the ties between people
p405
aVthat makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
p406
aVAnd so it is not just what's happening to these people \u2014
p407
aVwhether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor,
p408
aVor becoming happy or not becoming happy \u2014 that affects us;
p409
aVit's also the actual architecture
p410
aVof the ties around us.
p411
aa(lp412
VOur experience of the world
p413
aVdepends on the actual structure
p414
aVof the networks in which we're residing
p415
aVand on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow
p416
aVthrough the network.
p417
aVNow, the reason, I think, that this is the case
p418
aVis that human beings assemble themselves
p419
aVand form a kind of superorganism.
p420
aVNow, a superorganism is a collection of individuals
p421
aVwhich show or evince behaviors or phenomena
p422
aVthat are not reducible to the study of individuals
p423
aVand that must be understood by reference to,
p424
aVand by studying, the collective.
p425
aVLike, for example, a hive of bees
p426
aVthat's finding a new nesting site,
p427
aVor a flock of birds that's evading a predator,
p428
aVor a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom
p429
aVand navigate and find a tiny speck
p430
aVof an island in the middle of the Pacific,
p431
aVor a pack of wolves that's able
p432
aVto bring down larger prey.
p433
aVSuperorganisms have properties
p434
aVthat cannot be understood just by studying the individuals.
p435
aVI think understanding social networks
p436
aVand how they form and operate
p437
aVcan help us understand not just health and emotions
p438
aVbut all kinds of other phenomena \u2014
p439
aVlike crime, and warfare,
p440
aVand economic phenomena like bank runs
p441
aVand market crashes
p442
aVand the adoption of innovation
p443
aVand the spread of product adoption.
p444

VNow, look at this.
p446
aVI think we form social networks
p447
aVbecause the benefits of a connected life
p448
aVoutweigh the costs.
p449
aVIf I was always violent towards you
p450
aVor gave you misinformation
p451
aVor made you sad or infected you with deadly germs,
p452
aVyou would cut the ties to me,
p453
aVand the network would disintegrate.
p454
aVSo the spread of good and valuable things
p455
aVis required to sustain and nourish social networks.
p456
aVSimilarly, social networks are required
p457
aVfor the spread of good and valuable things,
p458
aVlike love and kindness
p459
aVand happiness and altruism
p460
aVand ideas.
p461
aVI think, in fact, that if we realized
p462
aVhow valuable social networks are,
p463
aVwe'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them,
p464
aVbecause I think social networks
p465
aVare fundamentally related to goodness.
p466
aVAnd what I think the world needs now
p467
aVis more connections.

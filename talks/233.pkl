VThank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.
p5
aVI cannot believe I'm here.
p6
aVI have not slept in weeks.
p7
aVNeil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept
p8
aVin anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous \u2014
p9
aVand I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized. (Laughter)
p10
aVSo, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization
p11
aVcalled 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk
p12
aVabout how we all might join in and do similar things.
p13
aa(lp14
VBack in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn,
p15
aVI was trying to finish my first book,
p16
aVI was wandering around dazed every day
p17
aVbecause I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
p18
aVSo I would walk around in a daze during the day.
p19
aVI had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.
p20
aVIn the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope,
p21
aVthere are a lot of writers \u2014
p22
aVit's like a very high per capita ratio
p23
aVof writers to normal people.
p24
aVMeanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.
p25
aVMy mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacher
p26
aVand after college so many of my friends went into teaching.
p27
aVAnd so I was always hearing them talk about their lives
p28
aVand how inspiring they were,
p29
aVand they were really sort of the most hard-working
p30
aVand constantly inspiring people I knew.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut I knew so many of the things they were up against,
p33
aVso many of the struggles they were dealing with.
p34
aVAnd one of them was that so many of my friends
p35
aVthat were teaching in city schools were having trouble
p36
aVwith their students keeping up at grade level,
p37
aVin their reading and writing in particular.
p38
aVNow, so many of these students had come from households
p39
aVwhere English isn't spoken in the home,
p40
aVwhere a lot of them have different special needs,
p41
aVlearning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools
p42
aVwhich sometimes and very often are under-funded.
p43
aVAnd so they would talk to me about this and say,
p44
aV"You know, what we really need is just more people,
p45
aVmore bodies, more one-on-one attention,
p46
aVmore hours, more expertise from people
p47
aVthat have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?"
p50
aVAnd they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.
p51
aVThis can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.
p52
aVHow can we possibly give each student
p53
aVeven one hour a week of one-on-one attention?"
p54
aVYou'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.
p55
aVAnd so we started talking about this.
p56
aVAnd at the same time,
p57
aVI thought about this massive group of people I knew:
p58
aVwriters, editors, journalists, graduate students,
p59
aVassistant professors, you name it.
p60
aVAll these people that had sort of flexible daily hours
p61
aVand an interest in the English word \u2014
p62
aVI hope to have an interest in the English language,
p63
aVbut I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter)
p64
aVI'm trying. That clock has got me.
p65
aVBut everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word
p66
aVin terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.
p67
aVAnd so they had, you know, their time
p68
aVand their interest, but at the same time
p69
aVthere wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community
p70
aVto bring these two communities together.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.
p73
aVAnd the idea was to put McSweeney's \u2014
p74
aVMcSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year,
p75
aVand a few other magazines \u2014
p76
aVwe were going to move it into an office for the first time.
p77
aVIt used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.
p78
aVWe were going to move it into an office,
p79
aVand we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.
p80
aVSo we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody \u2014
p81
aVsort of a writing community \u2014 coming into the office every day anyway,
p82
aVwhy don't we just open up
p83
aVthe front of the building for students to come in there after school,
p84
aVget extra help on their written homework,
p85
aVso you have basically no border between these two communities?"
p86
aVSo the idea was that we would be
p87
aVworking on whatever we're working on,
p88
aVat 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing,
p89
aVor you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.
p90
aVYou give those hours in the afternoon
p91
aVto the students in the neighborhood.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo, we had this place, we rented it,
p94
aVthe landlord was all for it. We did this mural,
p95
aVthat's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history
p96
aVof the printed word, in mural form \u2014 it takes a long time
p97
aVto digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.
p98
aVSo we rented this space.
p99
aVAnd everything was great except the landlord said,
p100
aV"Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.
p101
aVYou've gotta sell something.
p102
aVYou can't just have a tutoring center."
p103
aVSo we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"
p104
aVAnd we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell,
p105
aVbut we did all the necessary research.
p106
aVIt used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below,
p107
aVacoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.
p108
aVWe took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors,
p109
aVwhitewashed beams and it had the look \u2014
p110
aVwhile we were renovating this place, somebody said,
p111
aV"You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."
p112
aVAnd we looked around and somebody else said,
p113
aV"Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer." (Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh,
p116
aVand we said, "There's a point to that.
p117
aVLet's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.
p118
aVYou see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.
p119
aVA great carpenter built all this stuff and you see,
p120
aVwe made it look sort of pirate supply-like.
p121
aVHere you see planks sold by the foot
p122
aVand we have supplies to combat scurvy.
p123
aVWe have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.
p124
aVUp at the top, you see the eyepatch display,
p125
aVwhich is the black column there for everyday use
p126
aVfor your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel
p127
aVand other colors for stepping out at night \u2014
p128
aVspecial occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo we opened this place. And this is a vat
p131
aVthat we fill with treasures that students dig in.
p132
aVThis is replacement eyes in case you lose one.
p133
aVThese are some signs that we have all over the place:
p134
aV"Practical Joking with Pirates."
p135
aVWhile you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter
p136
aVand eight mop heads drop on your head.
p137
aVThat was just my one thing \u2014 I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.
p138
aVIt became mop heads. And this is the fish theater,
p139
aVwhich is just a saltwater tank with three seats,
p140
aVand then right behind it we set up this space,
p141
aVwhich was the tutoring center.
p142
aVSo right there is the tutoring center,
p143
aVand then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices,
p144
aVwhere all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.
p145
aa(lp146
VThe kids would come in \u2014
p147
aVor we thought they would come in. I should back up.
p148
aVWe set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months
p149
aVrenovating this place.
p150
aVWe had tables, chairs, computers, everything.
p151
aVI went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto
p152
aVand I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.
p153
aVAnyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.
p154
aVIt was started with about 12 of my friends,
p155
aVpeople that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.
p156
aVAnd we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk
p157
aVand it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related
p158
aVand Writing-Related Needs \u2014 Just Come In, It's All Free."
p159
aVAnd we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates,
p160
aVthey're gonna love it." And they didn't.
p161
aVAnd so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.
p162
aVAnd everybody was becoming very discouraged
p163
aVbecause it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd then somebody alerted us to the fact
p166
aVthat maybe there was a trust gap,
p167
aVbecause we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter)
p168
aVWe never put it together, you know?
p169
aVAnd so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari,
p170
aVa longtime San Francisco educator \u2014
p171
aVshe was teaching in Mexico City,
p172
aVshe had all the experience necessary,
p173
aVknew everything about education,
p174
aVwas connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood \u2014
p175
aVI convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.
p176
aVShe took over as executive director.
p177
aVImmediately, she made the inroads with the teachers
p178
aVand the parents and the students and everything,
p179
aVand so suddenly it was actually full every day.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd what we were trying to offer every day
p182
aVwas one-on-one attention.
p183
aVThe goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.
p184
aVYou know, it's been proven
p185
aVthat 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention,
p186
aVa student can get one grade level higher.
p187
aVAnd so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.
p188
aVThey come there, many times their parents \u2014
p189
aVyou can't see it, but there's a church pew
p190
aVthat I bought in a Berkeley auction right there \u2014
p191
aVthe parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.
p192
aVSo that was the basis of it,
p193
aVwas one-on-one attention.
p194
aVAnd we found ourselves full every day with kids.
p195
aVIf you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m.,
p196
aV2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often,
p197
aVby the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space,
p198
aa(lp199
Vwhich is very strange, because it's school, in a way.
p200
aVBut there was something psychological happening there
p201
aVthat was just a little bit different.
p202
aVAnd the other thing was, there was no stigma.
p203
aVKids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help,"
p204
aVor something like that. It was 826 Valencia.
p205
aVFirst of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.
p206
aVAnd then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.
p207
aVAnd so our interns were actually working
p208
aVat the same tables very often,
p209
aVand shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd so it became a tutoring center \u2014
p212
aVpublishing center, is what we called it \u2014
p213
aVand a writing center.
p214
aVThey go in, and they might be working with a high school student
p215
aVactually working on a novel \u2014 because we had very gifted kids, too.
p216
aVSo there's no stigma.
p217
aVThey're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.
p218
aVThey're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.
p219
aVThese adults, they're working in their field.
p220
aVThey can lean over, ask a question of one of these adults
p221
aVand it all sort of feeds on each other.
p222
aVThere's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem,
p223
aVespecially for the adults working at McSweeney's
p224
aVwho hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up,
p225
aVwas that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter)
p226
aVWith like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework
p229
aVin a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention \u2014
p230
aVthey go home, they're finished. They don't stall.
p231
aVThey don't do their homework in front of the TV.
p232
aVThey're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family,
p233
aVenjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.
p234
aVAnd that makes a happy family.
p235
aVA bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.
p236
aVA bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.
p237
aVSo the key to it all is homework! (Laughter) (Applause)
p238
aVThere you have it, you know \u2014 one-on-one attention.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo we started off with about 12 volunteers,
p241
aVand then we had about 50,
p242
aVand then a couple hundred.
p243
aVAnd we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.
p244
aVAnd we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.
p245
aVThe key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month,
p246
aVthose two hours shoulder-to-shoulder,
p247
aVnext to one student, concentrated attention,
p248
aVshining this beam of light on their work,
p249
aVon their thoughts and their self-expression,
p250
aVis going to be absolutely transformative,
p251
aVbecause so many of the students have not had that ever before.
p252
aVSo we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months,
p253
aVit doesn't matter. That's going to be enough."
p254
aVSo that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.
p255
aa(lp256
VThen we said, "Well, what are we
p257
aVgoing to do with the space during the day,
p258
aVbecause it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"
p259
aVSo we started bringing in classes during the day.
p260
aVSo every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book \u2014
p261
aVyou can see it being typed up above.
p262
aVThis is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.
p263
aVYou just point a camera at a class,
p264
aVand it always looks like this.
p265
aVSo this is one of the books that they do.
p266
aVNotice the title of the book,
p267
aV"The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic."
p268
aVAnd the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindy
p269
aVthat was about the Titanic."
p270
aVSo, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up,
p271
aVtaking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo then we still had more tutors to use.
p274
aVThis is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.
p275
aVThe teachers that we work with \u2014
p276
aVand everything is different to teachers \u2014 they tell us what to do.
p277
aVWe went in there thinking,
p278
aV"We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us.
p279
aVThe neighborhood's going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.
p280
aVThe teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful."
p281
aa(lp282
VSo then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?
p283
aVBecause what about the students that wouldn't come to you,
p284
aVnecessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in,
p285
aVor aren't close enough?" So then we started saying,
p286
aV"Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.
p287
aVLet's just put out the word." A teacher will say,
p288
aV"I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.
p289
aVWe're working on our college essays. Send them in."
p290
aVSo we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.
p291
aVWhoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.
p292
aVThe teacher tells them what to do,
p293
aVhow to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.
p294
aVThey work under the teacher's guide,
p295
aVand it's all in one big room.
p296
aVAnd that's actually the brunt of what we do is,
p297
aVpeople going straight from their workplace, straight from home,
p298
aVstraight into the classroom and
p299
aVworking directly with the students.
p300
aVSo then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.
p301
aVThen another school said, "Well, what if we
p302
aVjust give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?"
p303
aa(lp304
VSo this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room,
p305
aVwhere we decorated it in buccaneer style.
p306
aVIt's right off the library. And there we serve
p307
aVall 529 kids in this middle school.
p308
aVThis is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News,"
p309
aVthat has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom
p310
aVin both languages \u2014 English and Spanish.
p311
aVSo then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said,
p312
aV"Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?
p313
aVI want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world."
p314
aVAnd so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School,
p315
aVwhich is a school that we had worked with on some other things,
p316
aVand we gave that assignment to the students.
p317
aVAnd we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.
p318
aVShe's going to publish them in a book.
p319
aVShe's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.
p320
aVIt's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area
p321
aVand throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."
p322
aVSo these kids worked harder
p323
aVthan they've ever worked on anything in their lives,
p324
aVbecause there was that outside audience,
p325
aVthere was Isabel Allende on the other end.
p326
aVI think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them
p327
aVand so this worked out incredibly well.
p328
aVWe had a big party at the end.
p329
aVThis is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.
p330
aVYou can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one,
p331
aV"I Might Get Somewhere."
p332
aVAnd this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.
p333
aa(lp334
VNow we're sort of addicted to the book thing.
p335
aVThe kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life
p336
aVif they know it's going to be permanent,
p337
aVknow it's going to be on a shelf,
p338
aVknow that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said,
p339
aVthat we've honored their words, honored their thoughts
p340
aVwith hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts \u2014
p341
aVall this attention that we give to their thoughts.
p342
aVAnd once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level,
p343
aVthey can never go back.
p344
aVIt's absolutely transformative.
p345
aVAnd so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.
p346
aVWe sell all the student books.
p347
aVWhere else would you put them, right?
p348
aVSo we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening
p349
aVwith the stores. The store, actually \u2014
p350
aVeven though we started out as just a gag \u2014 the store actually made money.
p351
aVSo it was paying the rent.
p352
aVAnd maybe this is just a San Francisco thing \u2014
p353
aVI don't know, I don't want to judge.
p354
aVBut people would come in \u2014
p355
aVand this was before the pirate movies and everything!
p356
aVIt was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money,
p357
aVbut it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.
p358
aVThere's the ocean maps you can see on the left.
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd it became a gateway to the community.
p361
aVPeople would come in and say, "What the \u2014?
p362
aVWhat is this?" I don't want to swear on the web. (Laughter)
p363
aVIs that a rule? I don't know.
p364
aVThey would say, "What is this?"
p365
aVAnd people would come in and learn more about it.
p366
aVAnd then right beyond \u2014 there's usually a little chain there \u2014
p367
aVright beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.
p368
aVThis is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping,
p369
aVand they might be more likely to buy some lard,
p370
aVor millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook,
p371
aVor hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.
p372
aVSo the store actually did really well.
p373
aVBut it brought in so many people \u2014
p374
aVteachers, donors, volunteers, everybody \u2014
p375
aVbecause it was street level. It was open to the public.
p376
aVIt wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor
p377
aVof some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood
p378
aVthat it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.
p379
aVSo, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said,
p382
aV"Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"
p383
aVAnd a lot of them had been former educators
p384
aVor would-be educators, so they combined
p385
aVwith a lot of local designers, local writers,
p386
aVand they just took the idea independently
p387
aVand they did their own thing.
p388
aVThey didn't want to sell pirate supplies.
p389
aVThey didn't think that that was going to work there.
p390
aVSo, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York,
p391
aVthey opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.
p392
aVThis is Sam Potts' great design that did this.
p393
aVAnd this was to make it look sort of like one of those
p394
aVkeysmith's shops that has to have every service
p395
aVthey've ever offered, you know, all over there.
p396
aVSo they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco
p397
aVfor superheroes \u2014 all the supplies in kind of basic form.
p398
aVThese are all handmade.
p399
aVThese are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.
p400
aVAll the packaging is done by Sam Potts.
p401
aa(lp402
VSo then you have the villain containment unit,
p403
aVwhere kids put their parents. You have the office.
p404
aVThis is a little vault \u2014 you have to put your product in there,
p405
aVit goes up an electric lift
p406
aVand then the guy behind the counter tells you
p407
aVthat you have to recite the vow of heroism,
p408
aVwhich you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.
p409
aVPersonally, I think it's a problem.
p410
aVBecause they have to do it hand on heart and everything.
p411
aVThese are some of the products. These are all handmade.
p412
aVThis is a secret identity kit.
p413
aVIf you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone,
p414
aVone American female marketing executive
p415
aVfrom Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier
p416
aVon everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.
p417
aVSo, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape,
p418
aVand then you walk up these three steel-graded steps
p419
aVand then we turn on three hydraulic fans
p420
aVfrom every side and then you can see the cape in action.
p421
aVThere's nothing worse than, you know,
p422
aVgetting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.
p423
aVSo then, the secret door \u2014
p424
aVthis is one of the shelves you don't see
p425
aVwhen you walk in, but it slowly opens.
p426
aVYou can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.
p427
aVIt opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back. (Applause)
p428
aVSo you can see the full effect!
p429
aa(lp430
VBut this is \u2014 I just want to emphasize \u2014
p431
aVlocally funded, locally built.
p432
aVAll the designers, all of the builders,
p433
aVeverybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.
p434
aVI just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great,"
p435
aVor whatever. That was it. You can see the time
p436
aVin all five boroughs of New York in the back. (Laughter) (Applause)
p437
aVSo this is the space during tutoring hours.
p438
aVIt's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention,
p439
aVcomplete devotion to the students' work
p440
aVand a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility
p441
aVof creativity and ideas.
p442
aVAnd this switch is flicked in their heads
p443
aVwhen they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?
p444
aVSo it's school, but it's not school.
p445
aVIt's clearly not school, even though
p446
aVthey're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.
p447
aa(lp448
VThis is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.
p449
aVYou can read this quote.
p450
aVAddicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.
p451
aVCame in. Got this concentrated attention.
p452
aVAnd he couldn't escape it.
p453
aVSo, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early \u2014
p454
aVgot really addicted to finishing his homework early.
p455
aVIt's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it,
p456
aVand to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve
p457
aVthe next thing and be prepared for school the next day.
p458
aVSo he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.
p459
aVHe's now been published in five books.
p460
aVHe co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes
p461
aVcalled "Super-Has-Beens."
p462
aVHe wrote a series on "Penguin Balboa,"
p463
aVwhich is a fighting \u2014 a boxing \u2014 penguin.
p464
aVAnd then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space,
p465
aVat a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.
p466
aVHe's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now.
p467
aVThere's four family members that come in every day.
p468
aa(lp469
VSo, I'll go through really quickly.
p470
aVThis is L.A., The Echo Park Time Travel Mart:
p471
aV"Whenever You Are, We're Already Then." (Laughter)
p472
aVThis is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.
p473
aVSo you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be.
p474
aVLeeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine:
p475
aV"Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday." (Laughter) (Applause)
p476
aa(lp477
VAnyway. So I'm going to jump ahead.
p478
aVThese are spaces that are only affiliated with us,
p479
aVdoing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts;
p480
aVInk Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California,
p481
aVwhich inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis;
p482
aVAustin Bat Cave in Austin;
p483
aVFighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle,
p484
aVthis will be open in April.
p485
aVNow I'm going to the TED Wish \u2014 is that okay?
p486
aa(lp487
VAll right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish:
p488
aVI wish that you \u2014 you personally and every creative individual
p489
aVand organization you know \u2014 will find a way
p490
aVto directly engage with a public school in your area
p491
aVand that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved,
p492
aVso that within a year we have a thousand examples \u2014
p493
aVa thousand! \u2014 of transformative partnerships.
p494
aVProfound leaps forward!
p495
aVAnd these can be things that maybe you're already doing.
p496
aVI know that so many people in this room
p497
aVare already doing really interesting things.
p498
aVI know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website.
p499
aa(lp500
VWe created a website.
p501
aVI'm going to switch to "we," and not "I," hope:
p502
aVWe hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in
p503
aVa new era of participation in our public schools.
p504
aVWe hope that you will take the lead
p505
aVin partnering your innovative spirit and expertise
p506
aVwith that of innovative educators in your community.
p507
aVAlways let the teachers lead the way.
p508
aVThey will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out.
p509
aVThere are a million ways.
p510
aVYou can walk up to your local school
p511
aVand consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.
p512
aVSo, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco,
p513
aVthey did this phenomenal job.
p514
aVThis website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories,
p515
aVa lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School,"
p516
aVwhich is a great title, I think.
p517
aVThis site will document every story, every project that comes
p518
aVout of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website,
p519
aVyou see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by
p520
aVand then you add your own projects once you get started.
p521
aVHot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site.
p522
aVIf you have any questions, you can ask this guy,
p523
aVwho's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.
p524
aVYou email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want.
p525
aVAnd he'll get you inspired and get you going
p526
aVand guide you through the process so that you can affect change.
p527
aa(lp528
VAnd it can be fun! That's the point of this talk \u2014
p529
aVit needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable.
p530
aVYou can do and use the skills that you have.
p531
aVThe schools need you. The teachers need you.
p532
aVStudents and parents need you. They need your actual person:
p533
aVyour physical personhood and your open minds
p534
aVand open ears and boundless compassion,
p535
aVsitting next to them, listening and nodding
p536
aVand asking questions for hours at a time.
p537
aVSome of these kids just don't plain know how good they are:
p538
aVhow smart and how much they have to say.
p539
aVYou can tell them. You can shine that light on them,
p540
aVone human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.
p541
aVThank you so much.

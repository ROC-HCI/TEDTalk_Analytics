VYou know, it's a big privilege for me
p5
aVto be working in one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world:
p6
aVthe Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.
p7
aVThese islands \u2014 Mauritius, Rodrigues, and Réunion \u2014
p8
aValong with the island of Madagascar,
p9
aVthey are blessed with unique plants
p10
aVfound nowhere else in the world.
p11
aVAnd today I will tell you  about five of them
p12
aVand their particular features
p13
aVand why these plants are so unique.
p14
aa(lp15
VTake a look at this plant.
p16
aVI call it benjoin in the local vernacular,
p17
aVand the botanical name  is Terminalia bentzoe,
p18
aVsubspecies bentzoe.
p19
aVThis subspecies is endemic to Mauritius,
p20
aVand its particular feature
p21
aVis its heterophylly.
p22
aVWhat do I mean by heterophylly?
p23
aVIt's that the same plant
p24
aVhas got leaves that are different shapes and sizes.
p25
aVNow, these plants have evolved
p26
aVvery far away from the mainland,
p27
aVand within specific ecosystems.
p28
aVOften, these particular features
p29
aVhave evolved as a response to the threat
p30
aVpresented by the local fauna,
p31
aVin this case, grazing tortoises.
p32
aVTortoises are known to have poor eyesight,
p33
aVand as such, they tend to avoid the plants
p34
aVthey don't recognize.
p35
aVSo this evolutionary  foil safeguards the plant
p36
aVagainst these rather cute animals,
p37
aVand protects it and of course  ensures its survival.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow the question you're  probably asking yourself is,
p40
aVwhy is she telling us all these stories?
p41
aVThe reason for that is that we tend to overlook
p42
aVthe diversity and the variety of the natural world.
p43
aVThese particular habitats are unique
p44
aVand they are host to a whole lot of plants.
p45
aVWe don't realize how valuable
p46
aVand how precious these resources are,
p47
aVand yet, through our insouciance,
p48
aVwe keep on destroying them.
p49
aVWe're all familiar
p50
aVwith the macro impact of urbanization,
p51
aVclimate change, resource exploitation,
p52
aVbut when that one last plant \u2014
p53
aVor animal for that matter \u2014
p54
aVwhen that very last specimen
p55
aVhas disappeared from the face of this Earth,
p56
aVwe would have lost
p57
aVan entire subset of the Earth's biology,
p58
aVand with it, important plants  with medicinal potential
p59
aVor which could have ingredients
p60
aVthat would speak to the cosmetic,
p61
aVnutrition, pharma,
p62
aVand even the ethno-veterinary sectors,
p63
aVbe gone forever.
p64
aVAnd here we have a very prime example
p65
aVof the iconic dodo, which comes from Mauritius,
p66
aVand, of course, we know is  now a symbol of extinction.
p67
aa(lp68
VWe know plants have a  fundamental role to play.
p69
aVWell, first of all, they feed us
p70
aVand they also give us  the oxygen we breathe,
p71
aVbut plants are also the source
p72
aVof important, biologically active ingredients
p73
aVthat we should be studying very carefully,
p74
aVbecause human societies over the millennia,
p75
aVthey have developed important knowledge,
p76
aVcultural traditions,
p77
aVand important plant-based medicinal resources.
p78
aVHere's a data point:
p79
aV1.4 percent of the entire land surface
p80
aVis home to 40 percent of the species of higher plants,
p81
aV35 percent of the species of vertebrates,
p82
aVand this 1.4 percent
p83
aVrepresents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world,
p84
aVand this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface
p85
aValready provides for 35 percent
p86
aVof the ecosystem services
p87
aVthat vulnerable people depend on.
p88
aVAnd as you can see,
p89
aVthe island of Mauritius
p90
aVwhere I work and where I live,
p91
aVbelongs to one such biodiversity hotspot,
p92
aVand I study the unique plants
p93
aVon the island for their  biomedical applications.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, let's go back again
p96
aVto that first plant I showed you,
p97
aVthe one, of course, with  different-shaped leaves
p98
aVand different sizes, Terminalia bentzoe,
p99
aVsubspecies bentzoe,
p100
aVa plant only found in Mauritius.
p101
aVNow, the local people,
p102
aVthey used a decoction of the leaves
p103
aVagainst infectious diseases.
p104
aVNow our work, that is,
p105
aVthe scientific validation of  this traditional information,
p106
aVhas shown that precisely
p107
aVthat leaf extract shows activity, potent activity,
p108
aVagainst a wide range of bacteria
p109
aVthat could be pathogenic to humans.
p110
aVNow, could this plant be the answer
p111
aVto antibiotic resistance?
p112
aVYou know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be
p113
aVa big challenge globally.
p114
aVWhile we may not be sure, one thing is certain:
p115
aVwe will not want this plant to disappear.
p116
aVBut the harsh reality is that
p117
aVthis particular plant is in fact
p118
aVconsidered to be vulnerable
p119
aVin its natural habitat.
p120
aa(lp121
VThis brings me to another example.
p122
aVThis bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate
p123
aVin the local vernacular.
p124
aVThe botanical name is Psiadia arguta.
p125
aVIt's a plant which is rare,
p126
aVwhich is endemic to Mauritius.
p127
aVIt used to grow on the mainland,
p128
aVbut through the sheer  pressures of urbanization
p129
aVhas been pushed out of the mainland,
p130
aVand we've managed to bring it back
p131
aVfrom the brink of extinction
p132
aVby developing in vitro plants
p133
aVwhich are now growing in the wild.
p134
aVNow, one thing I must  point out straightaway
p135
aVis that not all plants
p136
aVcan be developed in vitro.
p137
aVWhile we humans, we are  happy in our comfort zone,
p138
aVthese plants also need
p139
aVtheir ecosystem to be preserved,
p140
aVand they don't react \u2014 endemic plants
p141
aVdon't react to very harsh  changes in their ecosystem,
p142
aVand yet we know what are the challenges
p143
aVthat climate change, for example,
p144
aVis posing to these plants.
p145
aVNow, the local people again use the leaves
p146
aVin traditional medicine
p147
aVagainst respiratory problems.
p148
aVNow, our preliminary labwork
p149
aVon the leaf extract has shown
p150
aVthat precisely these  leaves contain ingredients
p151
aVthat are very close,  in terms of structures,
p152
aVchemical structures, to those medicines
p153
aVwhich are sold in the chemist's shop
p154
aVagainst asthma.
p155
aVSo who knows
p156
aVwhat humanity will benefit from
p157
aVshould this plant decide  to reveal all its secrets.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, I come from the developing world
p160
aVwhere we are forever being  challenged with this issue
p161
aVof population explosion.
p162
aVAfrica is the continent  which is getting younger,
p163
aVand whenever one talks  about population explosion,
p164
aVone talks about the issue of food security
p165
aVas being the other side of the same coin.
p166
aVNow this plant here, the baobab,
p167
aVcould be part of the answer.
p168
aVIt's an underutilized, neglected food plant.
p169
aVIt defines the landscape of West Africa,
p170
aVwhere it is known as the tree of life,
p171
aVand later on I will tell you why
p172
aVthe Africans consider it to be the tree of life.
p173
aVNow interestingly, there are many legends
p174
aVwhich are associated with this plant.
p175
aVBecause of its sheer size,
p176
aVit was meant to be lording over lesser plants,
p177
aVso God didn't like this arrogance,
p178
aVuprooted it, and planted it upside down,
p179
aVhence its particular shape.
p180
aVAnd if you look at this tree again
p181
aVwithin the African context,
p182
aVin West Africa, it's known  as the palaver tree,
p183
aVbecause it performs great social functions.
p184
aVNow if you have a problem in the community,
p185
aVmeeting under the palaver tree
p186
aVwith the chiefs or the tribesmen
p187
aVwould be synonymous to trying to find a solution
p188
aVto that particular problem,
p189
aVand also to reinforce trust and respect
p190
aVamong members of the community.
p191
aVFrom the scientific point of view,
p192
aVthere are eight species of baobab in the world.
p193
aVThere's one from Africa,
p194
aVone from Australia,
p195
aVand six are endemic
p196
aVto the island of Madagascar.
p197
aVThe one I have showed you
p198
aVis the one from Africa,
p199
aVAdansonia digitata.
p200
aVNow, the flower, this  beautiful white flower,
p201
aVit opens at night, is pollinated by bats,
p202
aVand it gives rise to the fruit
p203
aVwhich is curiously known
p204
aVas the monkey apple.
p205
aVThe monkeys are not stupid animals.
p206
aVThey know what's good for them.
p207
aVNow, if you open the fruit of the baobab,
p208
aVyou'll see a white, floury pulp,
p209
aVwhich is very rich in nutrients
p210
aVand has got protein,
p211
aVmore protein than in human milk.
p212
aVYes, you heard right:
p213
aVmore protein than in human milk.
p214
aVAnd this is one of the reasons why
p215
aVthe nutrition companies of this world,
p216
aVthey are looking for this fruit to provide
p217
aVwhat we know as reinforced food.
p218
aVThe seeds give an oil, a very stable oil
p219
aVwhich is sought after  by the cosmetic industry
p220
aVto give to produce body lotions, for example.
p221
aVAnd if you look at the trunk,
p222
aVthe trunk, of course, safeguards water,
p223
aVwhich is often harvested by a thirsty traveler,
p224
aVand the leaves are used in traditional medicine
p225
aVagainst infectious disease.
p226
aVNow, you can see now why the Africans consider it
p227
aVto be the tree of life.
p228
aVIt's a complete plant,
p229
aVand in fact, the sheer size of these trees
p230
aVis hiding a massive potential,
p231
aVnot only for the pharma, nutrition, and the cosmetic industry.
p232
aVWhat I have showed you here
p233
aVis only the species from Africa,
p234
aVAdansonia digitata.
p235
aVWe have six species yet in Madagascar,
p236
aVand we don't know what  is the potential of this plant,
p237
aVbut one thing we know is that the flora
p238
aVis considered to be  threatened with extinction.
p239
aa(lp240
VLet me take you to Africa again,
p241
aVand introduce you to one of my very favorite,
p242
aVthe resurrection plant.
p243
aVNow here you'll find
p244
aVthat even Jesus has competition.
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aVNow, this plant here has developed
p247
aVremarkable tolerance to drought,
p248
aVwhich enables it to withstand
p249
aVup to 98 percent dehydration  over the period of a year
p250
aVwithout damage,
p251
aVand yet it can regenerate  itself almost completely
p252
aVovernight, over 24 hours, and flower.
p253
aVNow, us human beings,
p254
aVwe're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth.
p255
aVWe don't want to get old, and rightly so.
p256
aVWhy should we, especially if you can afford it?
p257
aVAnd this gives you an indication
p258
aVof what the plant looks like before.
p259
aVNow, if you are an inexperienced gardener,
p260
aVthe first thing you'll do  when you visit the garden
p261
aVis to uproot this plant because it's dead.
p262
aVBut if you water it, this is what you get.
p263
aVAbsolutely amazing.
p264
aVNow, if you look at our aging process,
p265
aVthe aging process is in fact the loss of water
p266
aVfrom the upper epidermis, resulting in wrinkling
p267
aVas we know it, especially women,
p268
aVwe are so conscious of this.
p269
aVAnd this plant, in fact, is giving  the cosmetic chemists
p270
aVvery important ingredients
p271
aVthat are actually finding ways
p272
aVto slow down the aging process
p273
aVand at the same time reinforce the cells
p274
aVagainst the onslaught of environmental toxins.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow, these four examples
p277
aVI have just given you
p278
aVare just a very tiny reminder
p279
aVas to how our health
p280
aVand our survival are closely linked
p281
aVto the health and the resilience
p282
aVof our ecosystem,
p283
aVand why we should be very careful
p284
aVabout preserving biodiversity.
p285
aVEvery time a forest is cut down,
p286
aVevery time a marsh is filled in,
p287
aVit is a potential lab that goes with it,
p288
aVand which we will never, ever recover.
p289
aVAnd I know what I'm talking about,
p290
aVcoming from Mauritius and missing the dodo.
p291
aa(lp292
VLet me finish with just one last example.
p293
aVConservation issues are normally guided
p294
aVtowards rare, endemic plants,
p295
aVbut what we call exotic plants,
p296
aVthat is, the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world,
p297
aVthey also need to be considered.
p298
aVYou know why? Because the environment plays
p299
aVa very important role
p300
aVin modifying the composition of that plant.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo let's take a look at this plant here,
p303
aVCentella asiatica. It's a weed.
p304
aVWe call it a weed.
p305
aVNow, Centella asiatica  grows across the world
p306
aVin many different habitats \u2014  in Africa, in Asia \u2014
p307
aVand this plant has been instrumental
p308
aVin providing a solution  to that dreadful disease
p309
aVcalled leprosy in Madagascar in the 1940s.
p310
aVNow, while Centella  grows across the world \u2014
p311
aVin Africa, in Asia \u2014  the best quality Centella
p312
aVcomes from Madagascar,
p313
aVbecause that Centella contains the three vital ingredients
p314
aVwhich are sought after by the pharma
p315
aVand the cosmetic companies.
p316
aVAnd the cosmetic companies  are already using it
p317
aVto make regenerating cream.
p318
aa(lp319
VNow, there is an ancient saying
p320
aVthat for every disease known to mankind,
p321
aVthere is a plant to cure it.
p322
aVNow, you may not  believe in ancient sayings.
p323
aVYou may think they're obsolete
p324
aVnow that our science and  technology are so powerful.
p325
aVSo you may look on Centella as being
p326
aVan insignificant, humble weed,
p327
aVwhich, if destroyed, won't be missed.
p328
aVBut you know, there is no such thing as a weed.
p329
aVIt's a plant.
p330
aVIt's a living biological lab
p331
aVthat may well have answers
p332
aVto the question that we may have,
p333
aVbut we have to ensure
p334
aVthat it has the right to live.
p335
aa(lp336
VThank you.

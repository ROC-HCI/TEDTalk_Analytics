VThis is me. My name is Ben Saunders.
p5
aVI specialize in dragging heavy things
p6
aVaround cold places.
p7
aa(lp8
VOn May 11th last year,
p9
aVI stood alone at the North geographic Pole.
p10
aVI was the only human being in an area
p11
aVone-and-a-half times the size of America,
p12
aVfive-and-a-half thousand square miles.
p13
aVMore than 2,000 people have climbed Everest.
p14
aV12 people have stood on the moon.
p15
aVIncluding me, only four people
p16
aVhave skied solo to the North Pole.
p17
aVAnd I think the reason for that \u2014
p18
aV(Applause)
p19
aV\u2014 thank you \u2014 I think the reason for that is that it's \u2014 it's \u2014
p20
aVwell, it's as Chris said, bonkers.
p21
aVIt's a journey that is right at the limit
p22
aVof human capability.
p23
aVI skied the equivalent of 31 marathons
p24
aVback to back. 800 miles in 10 weeks.
p25
aVAnd I was dragging all the food I needed,
p26
aVthe supplies, the equipment, sleeping bag,
p27
aVone change of underwear \u2014 everything I needed for nearly three months.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVWhat we're going to try and do today, in the 16 and a bit minutes I've got left,
p30
aVis to try and answer three questions. The first one is, why?
p31
aVThe second one is,
p32
aVhow do you go to the loo at minus 40?
p33
aV"Ben, I've read somewhere that at minus 40,
p34
aVexposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute, so how do you answer the call of nature?"
p35
aVI don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end.
p36
aVThird one: how do you top that? What's next?
p37
aa(lp38
VIt all started back in 2001.
p39
aVMy first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow \u2014 enormously experienced chap.
p40
aVThis was like my polar apprenticeship.
p41
aVWe were trying to ski from this group of islands up here,
p42
aVSevernaya Zemlya, to the North Pole.
p43
aVAnd the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole,
p44
aVgeographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea.
p45
aVThis is about as good as maps get,
p46
aVand to reach it you've got to ski literally
p47
aVover the frozen crust,
p48
aVthe floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean.
p49
aVI'd spoken to all the experts.
p50
aVI'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts.
p51
aVBut I realized on the morning of day one
p52
aVthat I had no idea exactly
p53
aVwhat I'd let myself in for.
p54
aa(lp55
VI was 23 years old. No one my age
p56
aVhad attempted anything like this,
p57
aVand pretty quickly, almost everything
p58
aVthat could have gone wrong did go wrong.
p59
aVWe were attacked by a polar bear on day two.
p60
aVI had frostbite in my left big toe.
p61
aVWe started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight.
p62
aVSome very unusual weather conditions, very difficult ice conditions.
p63
aVWe had
p64
aVdecidedly low-tech communications.
p65
aVWe couldn't afford a satellite phone, so we had HF radio.
p66
aVYou can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent.
p67
aVThere's a wire dangling down either side.
p68
aVThat was our HF radio antenna.
p69
aVWe had less than two hours
p70
aVtwo-way communication with the outside world in two months.
p71
aVUltimately, we ran out of time.
p72
aVWe'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left
p73
aVto go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time.
p74
aVWe were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt;
p75
aVwe spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio,
p76
aVand they said, "Look boys, you've run out of time.
p77
aVWe've got to pick you up."
p78
aVAnd I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly.
p79
aVI was a failure.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe one goal, the one dream I'd had
p82
aVfor as long as I could remember \u2014 I hadn't even come close.
p83
aVAnd skiing along that first trip, I had two
p84
aVimaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind
p85
aVwhen the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going.
p86
aVThe first one was reaching the Pole itself.
p87
aVI could see vividly, I suppose,
p88
aVbeing filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background,
p89
aVand I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind.
p90
aVI could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know \u2014
p91
aVah, glorious moment \u2014 the music kind of reaching a crescendo.
p92
aVThe second video clip
p93
aVthat I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport,
p94
aVand I could see again, vividly,
p95
aVthe camera flashbulbs going off,
p96
aVthe paparazzi, the autograph hunters,
p97
aVthe book agents coming to sign me up for a deal.
p98
aVAnd of course, neither of these things happened.
p99
aVWe didn't get to the Pole, and we didn't have any money
p100
aVto pay anyone to do the PR, so no one had heard
p101
aVof this expedition.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there; my brother was there;
p104
aVmy granddad was there \u2014 had a little Union Jack \u2014
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aV\u2014 and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum.
p107
aVI was physically exhausted,
p108
aVmentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure.
p109
aVIn a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition,
p110
aVand lying on my mum's sofa,
p111
aVday in day out, watching daytime TV.
p112
aVMy brother sent me a text message, an SMS \u2014
p113
aVit was a quote from the "Simpsons." It said,
p114
aV"You tried your hardest and failed miserably.
p115
aVThe lesson is: don't even try."
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VFast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa,
p119
aVand start planning another expedition. This time,
p120
aVI wanted to go right across, on my own this time,
p121
aVfrom Russia, at the top of the map,
p122
aVto the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is,
p123
aVand then on to Canada.
p124
aVNo one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own.
p125
aVTwo Norwegians did it as a team in 2000. No one's done it solo.
p126
aVVery famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer,
p127
aVReinhold Messner, tried it in 1995,
p128
aVand he was rescued after a week.
p129
aVHe described this expedition as 10 times
p130
aVas dangerous as Everest.
p131
aVSo for some reason, this was what I wanted to have a crack at,
p132
aVbut I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece,
p133
aVlet alone make it across to Canada,
p134
aVI had to take a radical approach.
p135
aVThis meant everything from perfecting the
p136
aVsawn-off, sub-two-gram toothbrush,
p137
aVto working with one of the world's leading nutritionists
p138
aVin developing a completely new,
p139
aVrevolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch:
p140
aV6,000 calories a day.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd the expedition started in February last year.
p143
aVBig support team. We had a film crew,
p144
aVa couple of logistics people with us,
p145
aVmy girlfriend, a photographer.
p146
aVAt first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow.
p147
aVThe next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk,
p148
aVon a Russian internal airline called KrasAir,
p149
aVspelled K-R-A-S.
p150
aVThe next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane
p151
aVto fly us up to a town called Khatanga,
p152
aVwhich was the sort of last bit of civilization.
p153
aVOur cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times,
p154
aVactually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take,
p155
aVand the pilot \u2014 Russian pilot \u2014 completely deadpan, replied,
p156
aV"Six hours \u2014 if we live."
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVWe got to Khatanga.
p159
aVI think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world,
p160
aVbut you can see it from there.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVIt was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for 10 days.
p163
aVThere was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between
p164
aVthe helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter,
p165
aVso we were stuck. We couldn't move.
p166
aVFinally, morning of day 11, we got the all-clear,
p167
aVloaded up the helicopters \u2014 two helicopters flying in tandem \u2014
p168
aVdropped me off at the edge of the pack ice.
p169
aVWe had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming,
p170
aVphotography; while the helicopter was still there,
p171
aVI did an interview on the satellite phone;
p172
aVand then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter,
p173
aVwham, the door closed, and I was alone.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice.
p176
aVAll I could think about was running back up to the door,
p177
aVbanging on the door, and saying, "Look guys,
p178
aVI haven't quite thought this through."
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aVTo make things worse, you can just see the white dot
p181
aVup at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon.
p182
aa(lp183
VBecause we'd been held up in Russia, of course,
p184
aVthe full moon brings the highest and lowest tides;
p185
aVwhen you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea,
p186
aVhigh and low tides generally mean
p187
aVthat interesting things are going to happen \u2014 the ice is going to start moving around a bit.
p188
aVI was, you can see there, pulling two sledges.
p189
aVGrand total in all, 95 days of food and fuel,
p190
aV180 kilos \u2014 that's almost exactly 400 pounds.
p191
aVWhen the ice was flat or flattish,
p192
aVI could just about pull both.
p193
aVWhen the ice wasn't flat, I didn't have a hope in hell.
p194
aVI had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one.
p195
aVLiterally scrambling through what's called pressure ice \u2014
p196
aVthe ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean,
p197
aVthe wind and the tides.
p198
aVNASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.
p199
aVAnd it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting.
p200
aVI was skiing into headwinds for nine
p201
aVout of the 10 weeks I was alone last year,
p202
aVand I was drifting backwards most of the time.
p203
aVMy record was minus 2.5 miles.
p204
aVI got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours,
p205
aVput the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back
p206
aVthan when I'd started.
p207
aVI literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Video): So it's day 22.
p210
aVI'm lying in the tent, getting ready to go.
p211
aVThe weather is just appalling \u2014
p212
aVoh, drifted back about five miles
p213
aVin the last \u2014 last night.
p214
aVLater in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice.
p215
aVIt was a lack of ice \u2014 open water.
p216
aVI knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming.
p217
aVI knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve.
p218
aVThis was my little bit of bio-mimicry.
p219
aVPolar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines.
p220
aVIf they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it.
p221
aVSo we had a dry suit developed \u2014 I worked with a team in Norway \u2014
p222
aVbased on a sort of survival suit \u2014
p223
aVI suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear \u2014
p224
aVthat I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens,
p225
aVit would pull up around my face,  and seal pretty tightly around my face.
p226
aVAnd this meant I could ski
p227
aVover very thin ice,
p228
aVand if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world.
p229
aVIt also meant, if the worst came to the worst,
p230
aVI could actually jump in and swim across
p231
aVand drag the sledge over after me.
p232
aVSome pretty radical technology,
p233
aVa radical approach \u2014but it worked perfectly.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnother exciting thing we did last year
p236
aVwas with communications technology.
p237
aVIn 1912, Shackleton's Endurance expedition \u2014
p238
aVthere was \u2014 one of his crew, a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees.
p239
aVHe said, "The explorers of 2012,
p240
aVif there is anything left to explore,
p241
aVwill no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones
p242
aVfitted with wireless telescopes."
p243
aVWell, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone,
p244
aVIridium satellite phone.
p245
aVThe wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket.
p246
aVAnd every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice,
p247
aVI was blogging live from my tent,
p248
aVsending back a little diary piece,
p249
aVsending back information on the distance I'd covered \u2014
p250
aVthe ice conditions, the temperature \u2014
p251
aVand a daily photo.
p252
aVRemember, 2001,
p253
aVwe had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world.
p254
aVLast year, blogging live from an expedition
p255
aVthat's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest.
p256
aVIt wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating
p257
aVin what's called a whiteout.
p258
aVWhen you get lots of mist, low cloud, the wind starts blowing the snow up.
p259
aVYou can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow
p260
aVribbon tied to one of my ski poles.
p261
aVI'd navigate using the direction of the wind.
p262
aVSo, kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech.
p263
aa(lp264
VI got to the Pole on the 11th of May.
p265
aVIt took me 68 days to get there from Russia,
p266
aVand there is nothing there.
p267
aV(Laughter).
p268
aVThere isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there,
p269
aVpurely because it's sea ice. It's drifting.
p270
aVStick a flag there, leave it there, pretty soon it will drift off, usually towards Canada or Greenland.
p271
aVI knew this, but I was expecting something.
p272
aVStrange mixture of feelings: it was extremely warm by this stage,
p273
aVa lot of open water around, and
p274
aVof course, elated that I'd got there under my own steam,
p275
aVbut starting to really realize
p276
aVthat my chances of making it all the way across to Canada,
p277
aVwhich was still 400 miles away,
p278
aVwere slim at best.
p279
aVThe only proof I've got that I was there
p280
aVis a blurry photo of my GPS, the little satellite navigation gadget.
p281
aVYou can just see \u2014
p282
aVthere's a nine and a string of zeros here.
p283
aVNinety degrees north \u2014 that is slap bang in the North Pole.
p284
aVI took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece.
p285
aVTook a few photos. I got my satellite phone out.
p286
aVI warmed the battery up in my armpit.
p287
aVI dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum.
p288
aVI dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor.
p289
aVAnd I got three voicemails.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aV(Video): Ninety.
p292
aVIt's a special feeling.
p293
aVThe entire planet
p294
aVis rotating
p295
aVbeneath my feet.
p296
aVThe \u2014 the whole world underneath me.
p297
aVI finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket.
p298
aVShe started crying. She asked me to call her back.
p299
aV(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VI skied on for a week past the Pole.
p302
aVI wanted to get as close to Canada as I could
p303
aVbefore conditions just got too dangerous to continue.
p304
aVThis was the last day I had on the ice.
p305
aVWhen I spoke to the \u2014 my project management team,
p306
aVthey said, "Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous.
p307
aVThere are huge areas of open water just south of your position.
p308
aVWe'd like to pick you up.
p309
aVBen, could you please look for an airstrip?"
p310
aVThis was the view outside my tent
p311
aVwhen I had this fateful phone call.
p312
aVI'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said,
p313
aV"Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of
p314
aVflat, thick safe ice."
p315
aVThe only bit of ice I could find \u2014
p316
aVit took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip \u2014
p317
aVwas exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis.
p318
aVI didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that.
p319
aVI thought, it'll have to do.
p320
aV(Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
p321
aa(lp322
VIt just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing \u2014
p323
aVthe plane actually passed over four times,
p324
aVand I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all.
p325
aVThe pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy
p326
aVthat did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy.
p327
aVI was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed \u2014 a pretty emotional moment.
p328
aVSo I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy.
p329
aVI'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type.
p330
aVThe plane taxied up to where I was standing.
p331
aVThe door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, "Hi, my name is Troy."
p332
aV(Laughter).
p333
aVThe co-pilot was a lady called Monica.
p334
aVShe sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper.
p335
aVThey were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day.
p336
aVTroy was smoking a cigarette on the ice;
p337
aVwe took a few photos. He
p338
aVclimbed up the ladder. He said, "Just \u2014 just get in the back."
p339
aVHe threw his cigarette out as he got on the front,
p340
aVand I climbed in the back.
p341
aV(Laughter)
p342
aVTaxied up and down the runway a few times,
p343
aVjust to flatten it out a bit, and he said, "Right, I'm going to \u2014
p344
aVI'm going to give it a go." And he \u2014
p345
aVI've now learned that this is standard practice, but it had me worried at the time.
p346
aVHe put his hand on the throttle.
p347
aVYou can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit.
p348
aVIt's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle.
p349
aVMonica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his.
p350
aVI thought, "God, here we go. We're, we're \u2014 this is all or nothing."
p351
aVRammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off.
p352
aVOne of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway,
p353
aVbanking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls,
p354
aVand he just took one hand off, reached back,
p355
aVflipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit,
p356
aVand it was the "fasten seat belt" sign you can see on the wall.
p357
aV(Laughter)
p358
aVAnd only from the air did I see the big picture.
p359
aVOf course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time,
p360
aVwhether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water.
p361
aVThis is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip.
p362
aVI mean, it really was starting to break up.
p363
aa(lp364
VWhy? I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense.
p365
aVI'm not skiing along drawing maps;
p366
aVeveryone knows where the North Pole is.
p367
aVAt the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip.
p368
aVThere's a cafe and there's a tourist shop.
p369
aVFor me, this is about exploring human limits,
p370
aVabout exploring the limits of physiology, of psychology
p371
aVand of technology. They're the things that excite me.
p372
aVAnd it's also about potential, on a personal level.
p373
aVThis, for me, is a chance to explore the limits \u2014
p374
aVreally push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch.
p375
aVAnd on a wider scale, it amazes me how people go through life
p376
aVjust scratching the surface of their potential,
p377
aVjust doing three or four or five percent
p378
aVof what they're truly capable of. So,
p379
aVon a wider scale, I hope that this journey
p380
aVwas a chance to inspire other people
p381
aVto think about what they want to do
p382
aVwith their potential, and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time
p383
aVwe each have on this planet.
p384
aVThat's as close as I can come to summing that up.
p385
aa(lp386
VThe next question is, how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40?
p387
aVThe answer, of course, to which is a trade secret \u2014
p388
aVand the last question,
p389
aVwhat's next? As quickly as possible,
p390
aVif I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail.
p391
aVWhat's next:
p392
aVAntarctica.
p393
aVIt's the coldest, highest,

aVwindiest and driest continent on Earth.
p395
aVLate 1911, early 1912,
p396
aVthere was a race to be the first
p397
aVto the South Pole: the heart of the Antarctic continent.
p398
aVIf you include the coastal ice shelves, you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf \u2014
p399
aVit's the big one down here \u2014 the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France.
p400
aVAntarctica, if you include the ice shelves,
p401
aVis twice the size of Australia \u2014 it's a big place.
p402
aVAnd there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen,
p403
aVthe Norwegian \u2014 Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies \u2014
p404
aVand Scott, the British guy, Captain Scott.
p405
aVScott had sort of ponies and some tractors
p406
aVand a few dogs, all of which went wrong,
p407
aVand Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot.
p408
aVThey got to the Pole late January 1912
p409
aVto find a Norwegian flag already there.
p410
aVThere was a tent, a letter to the Norwegian king.
p411
aVAnd they turned around, headed back to the coast,
p412
aVand all five of them died on the return journey.
p413
aVSince then, no one has ever skied \u2014
p414
aVthis was 93 years ago \u2014 since then, no one has ever skied
p415
aVfrom the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back.
p416
aVEvery South Pole expedition you may have heard about
p417
aVis either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles
p418
aVor dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing \u2014
p419
aVno one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan.
p420
aVTwo of us are doing it.
p421
aVThat's pretty much it.
p422
aa(lp423
VOne final thought before I get to the toilet bit, is \u2014
p424
aVis, I have a \u2014 and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten \u2014
p425
aVbut I have a \u2014 I have a school report. I was 13 years old,
p426
aVand it's framed above my desk at home. It says,
p427
aV"Ben lacks sufficient impetus
p428
aVto achieve anything worthwhile."
p429
aV(Laughter)
p430
aV(Applause)
p431
aVI think if I've learned anything, it's this: that no one else
p432
aVis the authority on your potential.
p433
aVYou're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of.
p434
aVLadies and gentlemen, that's my story.
p435
aVThank you very much.

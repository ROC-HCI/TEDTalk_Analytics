VI suspect that
p5
aVevery aid worker in Africa
p6
aVcomes to a time in her career
p7
aVwhen she wants to take all  the money for her project \u2014
p8
aVmaybe it's a school or a training program \u2014
p9
aVpack it in a suitcase,
p10
aVget on a plane flying over the poorest villages in the country,
p11
aVand start throwing that money out the window.
p12
aVBecause to a veteran aid worker,
p13
aVthe idea of putting cold, hard cash
p14
aVinto the hands of the poorest people on Earth
p15
aVdoesn't sound crazy,
p16
aVit sounds really satisfying.
p17
aa(lp18
VI had that moment right about the 10-year mark,
p19
aVand luckily, that's also when I learned
p20
aVthat this idea actually exists,
p21
aVand it might be just what the aid system needs.
p22
aVEconomists call it an unconditional cash transfer,
p23
aVand it's exactly that: It's cash given
p24
aVwith no strings attached.
p25
aVGovernments in developing countries
p26
aVhave been doing this for decades,
p27
aVand it's only now, with more evidence
p28
aVand new technology that it's possible
p29
aVto make this a model for delivering aid.
p30
aVIt's a pretty simple idea, right?
p31
aa(lp32
VWell, why did I spend a decade doing other stuff
p33
aVfor the poor?
p34
aVHonestly, I believed that I could do more good
p35
aVwith money for the poor
p36
aVthan the poor could do for themselves.
p37
aVI held two assumptions:
p38
aVOne, that poor people are poor in part
p39
aVbecause they're uneducated and
p40
aVdon't make good choices;
p41
aVtwo is that we then need people like me
p42
aVto figure out what they need and get it to them.
p43
aVIt turns out, the evidence says otherwise.
p44
aVIn recent years, researchers have been studying
p45
aVwhat happens when we give poor people cash.
p46
aVDozens of studies show across the board
p47
aVthat people use cash transfers
p48
aVto improve their own lives.
p49
aVPregnant women in Uruguay buy better food
p50
aVand give birth to healthier babies.
p51
aVSri Lankan men invest in their businesses.
p52
aVResearchers who studied our work in Kenya
p53
aVfound that people invested in a range of assets,
p54
aVfrom livestock to equipment  to home improvements,
p55
aVand they saw increases in income
p56
aVfrom business and farming
p57
aVone year after the cash was sent.
p58
aVNone of these studies found that people
p59
aVspend more on drinking or smoking
p60
aVor that people work less.
p61
aVIn fact, they work more.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, these are all material needs.
p64
aVIn Vietnam, elderly recipients used
p65
aVtheir cash transfers to pay for coffins.
p66
aVAs someone who wonders if Maslow got it wrong,
p67
aVI find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs
p68
aVdeeply humbling.
p69
aVI don't know if I would have chosen to give food
p70
aVor equipment or coffins,
p71
aVwhich begs the question:
p72
aVHow good are we at allocating resources
p73
aVon behalf of the poor?
p74
aVAre we worth the cost?
p75
aVAgain, we can look at empirical evidence
p76
aVon what happens when we give people stuff
p77
aVof our choosing.
p78
aVOne very telling study looked at a program in India
p79
aVthat gives livestock to the so-called ultra-poor,
p80
aVand they found that 30 percent of recipients
p81
aVhad turned around and sold the livestock they had been given
p82
aVfor cash.
p83
aVThe real irony is,
p84
aVfor every 100 dollars worth of assets
p85
aVthis program gave someone,
p86
aVthey spent another 99 dollars to do it.
p87
aVWhat if, instead, we use technology to put cash,
p88
aVwhether from aid agencies or from any one of us
p89
aVdirectly into a poor person's hands.
p90
aVToday, three in four Kenyans use mobile money,
p91
aVwhich is basically a bank account that can run
p92
aVon any cell phone.
p93
aVA sender can pay a 1.6 percent fee
p94
aVand with the click of a button
p95
aVsend money directly to a recipient's account
p96
aVwith no intermediaries.
p97
aVLike the technologies that are disrupting industries
p98
aVin our own lives,
p99
aVpayments technology in poor countries
p100
aVcould disrupt aid.
p101
aVIt's spreading so quickly that it's possible
p102
aVto imagine reaching billions
p103
aVof the world's poor this way.
p104
aa(lp105
VThat's what we've started to do at GiveDirectly.
p106
aVWe're the first organization
p107
aVdedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor.
p108
aVWe've sent cash to 35,000  people across rural Kenya
p109
aVand Uganda
p110
aVin one-time payments of 1,000 dollars
p111
aVper family.
p112
aVSo far, we've looked for the poorest people
p113
aVin the poorest villages, and in this part of the world,
p114
aVthey're the ones living in homes
p115
aVmade of mud and thatch,
p116
aVnot cement and iron.
p117
aVSo let's say that's your family.
p118
aVWe show up at your door with an Android phone.
p119
aVWe'll get your name, take your photo
p120
aVand a photo of your hut
p121
aVand grab the GPS coordinates.
p122
aVThat night, we send all the data to the cloud,
p123
aVand each piece gets checked
p124
aVby an independent team
p125
aVusing, for one example, satellite images.
p126
aVThen, we'll come back,
p127
aVwe'll sell you a basic cell phone
p128
aVif you don't have one already,
p129
aVand a few weeks later,
p130
aVwe send money to it.
p131
aVSomething that five years ago
p132
aVwould have seemed impossible
p133
aVwe can now do efficiently
p134
aVand free of corruption.
p135
aa(lp136
VThe more cash we give to the poor,
p137
aVand the more evidence we have that it works,
p138
aVthe more we have to reconsider
p139
aVeverything else we give.
p140
aVToday, the logic behind aid is too often,
p141
aVwell, we do at least some good.
p142
aVWhen we're complacent
p143
aVwith that as our bar,
p144
aVwhen we tell ourselves that giving aid
p145
aVis better than no aid at all,
p146
aVwe tend to invest inefficiently,
p147
aVin our own ideas that strike us as innovative,
p148
aVon writing reports,
p149
aVon plane tickets and SUVs.
p150
aVWhat if the logic was,
p151
aVwill we do better than cash given directly?
p152
aVOrganizations would have to prove
p153
aVthat they're doing more good for the poor
p154
aVthan the poor can do for themselves.
p155
aVOf course, giving cash won't create public goods
p156
aVlike eradicating disease or  building strong institutions,
p157
aVbut it could set a higher bar
p158
aVfor how we help individual families
p159
aVimprove their lives.
p160
aa(lp161
VI believe in aid.
p162
aVI believe most aid is better than just
p163
aVthrowing money out of a plane.
p164
aVI am also absolutely certain
p165
aVthat a lot of aid today
p166
aVisn't better than giving directly to the poor.
p167
aVI hope that one day, it will be.
p168
aa(lp169
VThank you.

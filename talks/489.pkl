VI don't know what the hell I'm doing here.
p5
aVI was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada,
p6
aVand dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone,
p7
aVand I paint on paper using gouache, which hasn't changed in 600 years.
p8
aVBut about three years ago I had an art show in New York,
p9
aVand I titled it "Serious Nonsense."
p10
aVSo I think I'm actually the first one here \u2014 I lead.
p11
aVI called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side,
p12
aVI use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration
p13
aVfrom when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it \u2014
p14
aVit's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal.
p15
aVAnd meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see.
p16
aa(lp17
VThis is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors,
p18
aVand the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor \u2014
p19
aVwhich you can't see there.
p20
aVThis was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.
p21
aa(lp22
VThis is a home-built rocket-propelled car. That's a 1953 Henry J \u2014
p23
aVI'm a bug for authenticity \u2014 in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo.
p24
aa(lp25
VThis is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film.
p26
aVYou can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town.
p27
aa(lp28
VMy work is so personal and so strange
p29
aVthat I have to invent my own lexicon for it.
p30
aVAnd I work a lot in what I call "retrofuturism,"
p31
aVwhich is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow.
p32
aVAnd they're always wrong, always hilariously, optimistically wrong.
p33
aVAnd the peak time for that was the 30s,
p34
aVbecause the Depression was so dismal
p35
aVthat anything to get away from the present into the future ...
p36
aVand technology was going to carry us along.
p37
aa(lp38
VThis is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days \u2014
p39
aVI had a huge collection of them from the '30s \u2014
p40
aVall they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses
p41
aVout of wire coat hangers and everything improvised
p42
aVand dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots
p43
aVplaying ice hockey at 300 miles an hour \u2014
p44
aVit's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful.
p45
aa(lp46
VAutomotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties.
p47
aVI was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter,
p48
aVso I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject.
p49
aVDetroit has always been halfway into the future \u2014 the advertising half.
p50
aVThis is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.
p51
aVThis is a chain gang of guys admiring the car.
p52
aVThat's from a whole catalog \u2014 it's 18 pages or so \u2014
p53
aVran back in the days of the Lampoon, where I cut my teeth.
p54
aa(lp55
VTechno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened \u2014
p56
aVfor good reason, usually.
p57
aVThe zeppelin \u2014 this was from a brochure about the zeppelin
p58
aVbased, obviously, on the Hindenburg.
p59
aVBut the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man.
p60
aVAnd it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark,
p61
aVand it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it.
p62
aVSo the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.
p63
aa(lp64
VThis is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.
p65
aVThe auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter,
p66
aVbut it should have \u2014 it wasn't a big success.
p67
aVIt's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.
p68
aVYou needed to know that.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe flying car which never got off the ground \u2014 it was a post-war dream.
p71
aVMy old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car.
p72
aVThis is pitched into the future from 1946,
p73
aVlooking at the day all American families have them.
p74
aV"There's Moscow, Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto!"
p75
aa(lp76
VFaux-nostalgia, which I'm sort of \u2014 not, say, famous for, but I work an awful lot in it.
p77
aVIt's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.
p78
aVSomebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion \u2014
p79
aVso I think that\u2019s a case for serious play.
p80
aa(lp81
VThis is emblematic of it \u2014 this is wing dining,
p82
aVrecalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s,
p83
aVdining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here,
p84
aVbut that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel
p85
aVto Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away.
p86
aa(lp87
VThis is tank polo in the South Hamptons.
p88
aVThe brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense.
p91
aVI think it adds a huge amount.
p92
aVThose, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.
p93
aVThey had two machine guns and a cannon,
p94
aVand they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines.
p95
aVThey went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark.
p96
aVAnd they had a canary hung inside the thing
p97
aVto make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas.
p98
aVHappy little story, isn't it?
p99
aa(lp100
VThis is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s,
p101
aVwhere you drove up to your front door, if you had the guts.
p102
aVAnybody who was anybody had an apartment there.
p103
aVI managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm.
p104
aVAnd I love cigars \u2014 there's a cigar billboard down there.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war.
p107
aVThis is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940,
p108
aVwhen a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons
p109
aVand buzzes around, just to piss off Churchill, who's down there somewhere.
p110
aVIt's a fond memory of times past.
p111
aa(lp112
VHyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit,
p113
aVjust for the fun of it. This was a piece I did \u2014 a brochure again \u2014
p114
aV"RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."
p115
aVThe copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages,
p116
aVsays that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over,
p117
aVand it's so safe it carries no insurance.
p118
aVIt's obviously modeled on the Titanic.
p119
aVBut it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements.
p120
aVIt's just a sick, silly joke.
p121
aa(lp122
VShamelessly cheap is something, I think \u2014 this will wake you up.
p123
aVIt has no meaning, just \u2014 Desoto discovers the Mississippi,
p124
aVand it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi.
p125
aVI did that as a quick back page \u2014 I had like four hours to do a back page
p126
aVfor an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that,
p127
aVand I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it."
p128
aVPeople wrote in for reprints of that thing.
p129
aa(lp130
VUrban absurdism \u2014 that's what the New Yorker really calls for.
p131
aVI try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.
p132
aVI've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.
p133
aVI was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m.,
p134
aVand this steam pouring out of the street, and I thought, "What causes that?" And that \u2014
p135
aVwho\u2019s to say?
p136
aa(lp137
VThe Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York \u2014 it's a very somber place.
p138
aVI thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it.
p139
aa(lp140
VThis is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.
p141
aVI couldn't resist, and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying,
p142
aV"This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed,
p143
aVplease apologize on our website."
p144
aVHaven't got around to it yet but \u2014 I may.
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is the word side of my brain.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVI love the word "Eurotrash."
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVThat's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs.
p151
aa(lp152
VThis was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France.
p153
aVIf you live in New York, you know how the bike messengers move.
p154
aVExcept that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff \u2014 they all do \u2014
p155
aVand a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist
p156
aVabout to shoot rockets at the Tour de France \u2014
p157
aVsign of our times, I guess.
p158
aa(lp159
VThis is the only fashion cover I've ever done.
p160
aVIt's the little old lady that lives in a shoe, and then this thing \u2014
p161
aVthe title of that was, "There Goes the Neighborhood."
p162
aVI don't know a hell of a lot about fashion \u2014
p163
aVI was told to do what they call a Mary Jane,
p164
aVand then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying:
p165
aV"Put a strap on it" \u2014 "No, don't put a strap on it" \u2014 "Put a strap on it \u2014 "Don't put a strap on it" \u2014
p166
aVbecause it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and \u2014
p167
aVI finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe.
p168
aa(lp169
VThis is a tiny joke \u2014 E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea.
p170
aa(lp171
VThis is a big joke.
p172
aVThis is the audition for "King Kong."
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVPeople always ask me, where do you get your ideas, how do your ideas come?
p175
aVTruth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover,
p176
aVin the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox \u2014 all I had to do was write it down.
p177
aVIt was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it.
p178
aVAnd then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg \u2014
p179
aVif you know that name \u2014 called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet.
p180
aVHer former name was Fay Wray, and so that was \u2014
p181
aVI didn't have the wit to say, "Take the painting."
p182
aa(lp183
VFinally, this was a three-page cover, never done before,
p184
aVand I don't think it will ever be done again \u2014
p185
aVsuccessive pages in the front of the magazine.
p186
aVIt's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.
p187
aVYou can't see it all together, unfortunately, but if you look at it enough,
p188
aVyou can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move.
p189
aV(Applause)
p190
aa(lp191
VPretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre.
p192
aVI would just like to add a crass commercial \u2014
p193
aVI have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches,"
p194
aVa compendium of all the serious play that ever was,
p195
aVand it\u2019s going to be available in fine bookstores, crummy bookstores,
p196
aVtables on the street in October.
p197
aVSo thank you very much.

"<p>A longtime contributor to the <em>New Yorker</em>, Bruce McCall is a humorist and illustrator whose best-known work draws on the big-shouldered hubris of the middle 1920s and the early 1950s to create <strong>a future paradise where the skies are fllled with zeppelins</strong> and every car has wings. He&#39;s a wry observer of contemporary life and a witty writer.</p><p>McCall began his career as an illustrator for car ads -- by his own account not a very good illustrator. He&#39;d left the field and became a copywriter when, on a whim, he and a friend sent some humorous drawings to <em>Playboy</em> (at that time, 1970, it was a legit career move). He soon connected with the founders of the <em>National Lampoon</em>, a pioneering humor magazine, and went on to create some of their most enduring images -- finding in the 1970s countercultural media <strong>a rich audience for his satirical take on the Atomic Age</strong>. He&#39;s now working the same magic at the <em>New Yorker</em>. </p><p>His latest book is called <a href=\\"http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780374399252-3\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Marveltown</em></a>, and is exactly what it sounds like.

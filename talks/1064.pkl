VI am passionate about the American landscape
p5
aVand how the physical form of the land,
p6
aVfrom the great Central Valley of California
p7
aVto the bedrock of Manhattan,
p8
aVhas really shaped our history and our character.
p9
aVBut one thing is clear.
p10
aVIn the last 100 years alone,
p11
aVour country \u2014 and this is a sprawl map of America \u2014
p12
aVour country has systematically
p13
aVflattened and homogenized the landscape
p14
aVto the point where we've forgotten
p15
aVour relationship with the plants and animals
p16
aVthat live alongside us
p17
aVand the dirt beneath our feet.
p18
aVAnd so, how I see my work contributing
p19
aVis sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections
p20
aVand physically rebuild them.
p21
aVThis graph represents what we're dealing with now
p22
aVin the built environment.
p23
aVAnd it's really a conflux
p24
aVof urban population rising,
p25
aVbiodiversity plummeting
p26
aVand also, of course, sea levels rising
p27
aVand climate changing.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo when I also think about design,
p30
aVI think about
p31
aVtrying to rework and re-engage
p32
aVthe lines on this graph
p33
aVin a more productive way.
p34
aVAnd you can see from the arrow here
p35
aVindicating "you are here,"
p36
aVI'm trying to sort of blend and meld
p37
aVthese two very divergent fields
p38
aVof urbanism and ecology,
p39
aVand sort of bring them together in an exciting new way.
p40
aVSo the era of big infrastructure is over.
p41
aVI mean, these sort of top-down,
p42
aVmono-functional, capital-intensive solutions
p43
aVare really not going to cut it.
p44
aVWe need new tools and new approaches.
p45
aVSimilarly, the idea of architecture
p46
aVas this sort of object in the field,
p47
aVdevoid of context,
p48
aVis really not the \u2014
p49
aVexcuse me, it's fairly blatant \u2014
p50
aVis really not the approach
p51
aVthat we need to take.
p52
aVSo we need new stories,
p53
aVnew heroes and new tools.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo now I want to introduce you to my new hero
p56
aVin the global climate change war,
p57
aVand that is the eastern oyster.
p58
aVSo, albeit a very small creature
p59
aVand very modest,
p60
aVthis creature is incredible,
p61
aVbecause it can agglomerate
p62
aVinto these mega-reef structures.
p63
aVIt can grow; you can grow it;
p64
aVand \u2014 did I mention? \u2014 it's quite tasty.
p65
aVSo the oyster was the basis
p66
aVfor a manifesto-like urban design project
p67
aVthat I did about the New York Harbor
p68
aVcalled "oyster-tecture."
p69
aVAnd the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power
p70
aVof mussels, eelgrass and oysters \u2014
p71
aVspecies that live in the harbor \u2014
p72
aVand, at the same time,
p73
aVharness the power of people
p74
aVwho live in the community
p75
aVtowards making change now.
p76
aa(lp77
VHere's a map of my city, New York City,
p78
aVshowing inundation in red.
p79
aVAnd what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about,
p80
aVthe Gowanus Canal and Governors Island.
p81
aVIf you look here at this map,
p82
aVshowing everything in blue
p83
aVis out in the water,
p84
aVand everything in yellow is upland.
p85
aVBut you can see, even just intuit, from this map,
p86
aVthat the harbor has dredged and flattened,
p87
aVand went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck
p88
aVin really a matter of years.
p89
aVAnother set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself.
p90
aVNow the Gowanus is particularly smelly \u2014 I will admit it.
p91
aVThere are problems of sewage overflow
p92
aVand contamination,
p93
aVbut I would also argue that almost every city
p94
aVhas this exact condition,
p95
aVand it's a condition that we're all facing.
p96
aVAnd here's a map of that condition,
p97
aVshowing the contaminants in yellow and green,
p98
aVexacerbated by this new flow of
p99
aVstorm-surge and sea-level rise.
p100
aVSo we really had a lot to deal with.
p101
aa(lp102
VWhen we started this project,
p103
aVone of the core ideas was to look back in history
p104
aVand try to understand what was there.
p105
aVAnd you can see from this map,
p106
aVthere's this incredible geographical signature
p107
aVof a series of islands
p108
aVthat were out in the harbor
p109
aVand a matrix of salt marshes and beaches
p110
aVthat served as natural wave attenuation
p111
aVfor the upland settlement.
p112
aVWe also learned at this time
p113
aVthat you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate
p114
aVin the Gowanus Canal itself.
p115
aVSo our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept,
p116
aVharnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.
p117
aVAnd the idea has two core stages.
p118
aVOne is to develop a new artificial ecology,
p119
aVa reef out in the harbor,
p120
aVthat would then protect new settlement patterns
p121
aVinland and the Gowanus.
p122
aVBecause if you have cleaner water and slower water,
p123
aVyou can imagine a new way of living with that water.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo the project really addresses these three core issues
p126
aVin a new and exciting way, I think.
p127
aVHere we are, back to our hero, the oyster.
p128
aVAnd again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.
p129
aVIt accepts algae and detritus in one end,
p130
aVand through this beautiful, glamorous
p131
aVset of stomach organs,
p132
aVout the other end comes cleaner water.
p133
aVAnd one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.
p134
aVOyster reefs also covered
p135
aVabout a quarter of our harbor
p136
aVand were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.
p137
aVThey were key in our culture and our economy.
p138
aVBasically, New York was built
p139
aVon the backs of oystermen,
p140
aVand our streets were literally built over oyster shells.
p141
aVThis image
p142
aVis an image of an oyster cart,
p143
aVwhich is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.
p144
aVSo again, we got the short end of the deal there.
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVFinally, oysters can attenuate
p147
aVand agglomerate onto each other
p148
aVand form these amazing natural reef structures.
p149
aVThey really become nature's wave attenuators.
p150
aVAnd they become the bedrock
p151
aVof any harbor ecosystem.
p152
aVMany, many species depend on them.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo we were inspired by the oyster,
p155
aVbut I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.
p156
aVIt can move from a fertilized egg
p157
aVto a spat, which is when they're floating through the water,
p158
aVand when they're ready to attach onto another oyster,
p159
aVto an adult male oyster or female oyster,
p160
aVin a number of weeks.
p161
aVWe reinterpreted this life cycle
p162
aVon the scale of our sight
p163
aVand took the Gowanus
p164
aVas a giant oyster nursery
p165
aVwhere oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus,
p166
aVthen paraded down in their spat stage
p167
aVand seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.
p168
aVAnd so the core idea here
p169
aVwas to hit the reset button
p170
aVand regenerate an ecology over time
p171
aVthat was regenerative and cleaning
p172
aVand productive.
p173
aa(lp174
VHow does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple.
p175
aVA core concept here
p176
aVis that climate change
p177
aVisn't something that \u2014
p178
aVthe answers won't land down from the Moon.
p179
aVAnd with a $20 billion price tag,
p180
aVwe should simply start and get to work with what we have now
p181
aVand what's in front of us.
p182
aVSo this image is simply showing \u2014
p183
aVit's a field of marine piles
p184
aVinterconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.
p185
aVWhat is fuzzy rope, you ask?
p186
aVIt's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing,
p187
aVavailable practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap.
p188
aVSo we imagine that we would actually
p189
aVpotentially even host a bake sale
p190
aVto start our new project.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVSo in the studio, rather than drawing,
p193
aVwe began to learn how to knit.
p194
aVThe concept was to really knit this rope together
p195
aVand develop this new soft infrastructure
p196
aVfor the oysters to grow on.
p197
aVYou can see in the diagram how it grows over time
p198
aVfrom an infrastructural space
p199
aVinto a new public urban space.
p200
aVAnd that grows over time dynamically
p201
aVwith the threat of climate change.
p202
aa(lp203
VIt also creates this incredibly interesting, I think,
p204
aVnew amphibious public space,
p205
aVwhere you can imagine working,
p206
aVyou can imagine recreating in a new way.
p207
aVIn the end, what we realized we were making
p208
aVwas a new blue-green watery park
p209
aVfor the next watery century \u2014
p210
aVan amphibious park, if you will.
p211
aVSo get your Tevas on.
p212
aVSo you can imagine scuba diving here.
p213
aVThis is an image of high school students,
p214
aVscuba divers that we worked with on our team.
p215
aVSo you can imagine a sort of new manner of living
p216
aVwith a new relationship with the water,
p217
aVand also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs
p218
aVin terms of monitoring.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnother new vocabulary word for the brave new world:
p221
aVthis is the word "flupsy" \u2014
p222
aVit's short for "floating upwelling system."
p223
aVAnd this glorious, readily available device
p224
aVis basically a floating raft
p225
aVwith an oyster nursery below.
p226
aVSo the water is churned through this raft.
p227
aVYou can see the eight chambers on the side
p228
aVhost little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.
p229
aVSo rather than having 10 oysters,
p230
aVyou have 10,000 oysters.
p231
aVAnd then those spat are then seeded.
p232
aVHere's the Gowanus future
p233
aVwith the oyster rafts on the shorelines \u2014
p234
aVthe flupsification of the Gowanus.
p235
aVNew word.
p236
aVAnd also showing oyster gardening for the community
p237
aValong its edges.
p238
aVAnd finally, how much fun it would be
p239
aVto watch the flupsy parade
p240
aVand cheer on the oyster spats
p241
aVas they go down to the reef.
p242
aa(lp243
VI get asked two questions about this project.
p244
aVOne is: why isn't it happening now?
p245
aVAnd the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?
p246
aVAnd the answer is: not yet, they're working.
p247
aVBut we imagine, with our calculations,
p248
aVthat by 2050,
p249
aVyou might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.
p250
aa(lp251
VTo conclude, this is just one cross-section
p252
aVof one piece of city,
p253
aVbut my dream is, my hope is,
p254
aVthat when you all go back to your own cities
p255
aVthat we can start to work together and collaborate
p256
aVon remaking and reforming
p257
aVa new urban landscape
p258
aVtowards a more sustainable, a more livable
p259
aVand a more delicious future.
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you.

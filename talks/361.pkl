VI grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the
p5
aVvery, very north end of it there,
p6
aVwhere it's absolutely freezing cold.
p7
aVThis was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VI couldn't pick a career.
p12
aVIn Ireland the obvious choice is the military,
p13
aVbut to be honest it actually kind of sucks.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VMy mother wanted me to be a dentist.
p18
aVBut the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.
p19
aVSo I actually went to school in Belfast,
p20
aVwhich was where all the action happened.
p21
aVAnd this was a pretty common sight.
p22
aVThe school I went to was pretty boring.
p23
aVThey forced us to learn things like Latin.
p24
aVThe school teachers weren't having much fun,
p25
aVthe sports were very dirty or very painful.
p26
aVSo I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd I was actually rowing for my school here
p29
aVuntil this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front
p30
aVof the entire school.
p31
aVAnd that was the finishing post right there.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo this was extremely embarrassing.
p36
aVBut our school at that time got a grant from the government,
p37
aVand they got an incredible computer \u2014 the research machine 3DZ \u2014
p38
aVand they left the programming manuals lying around.
p39
aVAnd so students like myself with nothing to do,
p40
aVwe would learn how to program it.
p41
aVAlso around this time, at home,
p42
aVthis was the computer that people were buying.
p43
aVIt was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,
p44
aVand you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.
p45
aa(lp46
VActually I'm just going to pause for one second,
p47
aVbecause I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED \u2014
p48
aVyou had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.
p49
aVSo I brought a picture with big hair.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter).
p52
aa(lp53
VI just want to get that out of the way.
p54
aVSo after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named
p55
aVSinclair ZX81.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd \u2014 you see the picture at the bottom?
p60
aVThere's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.
p61
aVThat's what they thought they had built it for.
p62
aVThe reality is we got the programming manual
p63
aVand we started making games for it.
p64
aVWe were programming in BASIC,
p65
aVwhich is a pretty awful language for games,
p66
aVso we ended up learning Assembly language
p67
aVso we could really take control of the hardware.
p68
aVThis is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,
p69
aVand he's showing his machine.
p70
aVYou had this same thing in America,
p71
aVit was called the Timex Sinclair1000.
p72
aa(lp73
VTo play a game in those days you had to have an imagination
p74
aVto believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica."
p75
aVThe graphics were just horrible.
p76
aVYou had to have an even better imagination to play this game,
p77
aV"Death Rider."
p78
aVBut of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.
p79
aVThey started making their own video games.
p80
aVThis is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,
p81
aVso males choose the lucky rabbit.
p82
aa(lp83
VIt was around this time we went from 1K to 16K,
p84
aVwhich was quite the leap.
p85
aVAnd if you're wondering how much 16K is,
p86
aVthis eBay logo here is 16K.
p87
aVAnd in that amount of memory someone programmed
p88
aVa full flight simulation program.
p89
aVAnd that's what it looked like.
p90
aVI spent ages flying this flight simulator,
p91
aVand I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.
p92
aa(lp93
VHere's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer.
p94
aVHe's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.
p95
aVHe's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's
p96
aVsmiling in this photograph.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo I went on for the next 20 years or so
p99
aVmaking a lot of different games.
p100
aVSome of the highlights were things like "The Terminator,"
p101
aV"Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles."
p102
aVBecause I was from the United Kingdom,
p103
aVthey thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,
p104
aVso they decided to call it hero instead.
p105
aVI personally preferred the Spanish version,
p106
aVwhich was "Tortugas Ninja."
p107
aVThat was much better.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VThen the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry
p112
aVand Hollywood to actually work together on something \u2014
p113
aVinstead of licensing from each other, to actually work.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,
p116
aVso I've done that.
p117
aVThe video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.
p118
aVIt grows every year.
p119
aVLast year was the biggest year.
p120
aVBy 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.
p121
aVBy 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.
p122
aV43 percent of gamers are female.
p123
aVSo there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.
p124
aa(lp125
VThe average age of gamers?
p126
aVWell, obviously it's for children, right?
p127
aVWell, no, actually it's 30 years old.
p128
aVAnd interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.
p129
aVSo 37 is our target audience.
p130
aVAll video games are violent.
p131
aVOf course the newspapers love to beat on this.
p132
aVBut 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,
p133
aVso it's just not true.
p134
aa(lp135
VOnline gaming statistics.
p136
aVI brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.
p137
aVIt makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.
p138
aVIt costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,
p139
aVmaking the publisher about another 275 million.
p140
aVThe game costs about 80 million dollars to make,
p141
aVso basically it pays for itself in about a month.
p142
aVA player in a game called "Project Entropia"
p143
aVactually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.
p144
aVYou have to remember that this is not a real island.
p145
aVHe didn't actually buy anything, just some data.
p146
aVBut he got great terms on it.
p147
aVThis purchase included mining and hunting rights,
p148
aVownership of all land on the island, and a castle
p149
aVwith no furniture included.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VThis market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.
p154
aVAnd what's interesting about it is the market was actually created
p155
aVby the gamers themselves.
p156
aVThey found clever ways to trade items
p157
aVand to sell their accounts to each other
p158
aVso that they could make money while they were playing their games.
p159
aVI dove onto eBay a couple of days ago
p160
aVjust to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.
p161
aVI liked this one the best:
p162
aVa level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.
p163
aVIt's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo as far as popularity of games,
p166
aVwhat do you think these people are doing here?
p167
aVIt turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles
p168
aVlistening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.
p169
aVThat's what the show looks like.
p170
aVYou would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.
p171
aVIt's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.
p172
aVAnd the people that went there absolutely loved it.
p173
aa(lp174
VWhat do you think these people are doing?
p175
aVThey're actually bringing their computers so they can play games
p176
aVagainst each other.
p177
aVAnd this is happening in every city around the world.
p178
aVThis is happening in your local cities too,
p179
aVyou're probably just not aware of it.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago
p182
aVhere just to show how video game graphics have been improving.
p183
aVI wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.
p184
aVBut what I want you to do is to try to understand it.
p185
aVWe're on this curve, and the graphics are getting
p186
aVso ridiculously better.
p187
aVAnd I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.
p188
aVBut I want you to try and think about what games could look like
p189
aV10 years from now.
p190
aVSo we're going to start that video.
p191
aa(lp192
VVideo: Throughout human history people have played games.
p193
aVAs man's intellect and technology have evolved
p194
aVso too have the games he plays.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Music)
p197
aa(lp198
V(Applause)
p199
aa(lp200
VDavid Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,
p201
aVdon't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.
p202
aVThink about that's where we are right now,
p203
aVand the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue
p204
aVto get better.
p205
aVThis is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw
p206
aVif you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.
p207
aVYou need to be really an incredible artist.
p208
aVAnd once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want
p209
aVmore fantasy artists that can create places
p210
aVwe've never been to before, or characters that
p211
aVwe've just never seen before.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio.
p214
aVBut if you were to go to a game developers conference,
p215
aVwhat they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,
p216
aVmeaning, understanding and feeling.
p217
aVYou'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?
p218
aVAnd these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.
p219
aa(lp220
VI came across a student who's absolutely excellent
p221
aVat expressing himself, and this student agreed
p222
aVthat he would not show his video to anybody until
p223
aVyou here at TED had seen it.
p224
aVSo I'd like to play this video.
p225
aVSo this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.
p226
aa(lp227
VVideo: I, like many of you, live somewhere between
p228
aVreality and video games.
p229
aVSome part of me \u2014 a true living, breathing person \u2014
p230
aVhas become programmed, electronic and virtual.
p231
aVThe boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy
p232
aVhas finally begun to crumble.
p233
aVI'm a video game addict and this is my story.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Music)
p236
aa(lp237
VIn the year of my birth
p238
aVthe Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.
p239
aVI played in the backyard, learned to read,
p240
aVand even ate some of my vegetables.
p241
aVMost of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.
p242
aVBut as was the case for most of my generation,
p243
aVI spent a lot of time in front of the TV.
p244
aVMr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,
p245
aVand roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly
p246
aVleft their mark on me.
p247
aa(lp248
VWhen my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo,
p249
aVwhatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive
p250
aVelectronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.
p251
aVAt some point something clicked.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Music)
p254
aa(lp255
VWith the combination of simple, interactive stories
p256
aVand the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo
p257
aVbecame more than just an escape.
p258
aVIt became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Music)
p261
aa(lp262
VI'm a video game addict, and it's not because of
p263
aVa certain number of hours I have spent playing,
p264
aVor nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.
p265
aVIt is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,
p266
aVand video games had begun to erode my own understanding
p267
aVof what is real and what is not.
p268
aVI'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,
p269
aVI still crave more.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Music)
p272
aa(lp273
VFrom an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally
p274
aVin what unfolded before me on screen.
p275
aVToday, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,
p276
aVeven a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.
p277
aVI am just one of a new generation that is growing up.
p278
aVA generation who may experience much more meaning
p279
aVthrough video games than they will through the real world.
p280
aVVideo games are nearing an evolutionary leap,
p281
aVa point where game worlds will look and feel just as real
p282
aVas the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.
p283
aVAnd while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds
p284
aVmay still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.
p285
aVPlay enough video games and eventually you will
p286
aVreally believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,
p287
aVdrive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.
p288
aVI know I can.
p289
aa(lp290
VUnlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,
p291
aVvideo games actually allow us to become part of the machine.
p292
aVThey allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,
p293
aVdownloaded, streaming, HD reality.
p294
aVWe are interacting with our entertainment.
p295
aVI have come to expect this level of interaction.
p296
aVWithout it, the problems faced in the real world \u2014
p297
aVpoverty, war, disease and genocide \u2014 lack the levity they should.
p298
aVTheir importance blends into the sensationalized drama
p299
aVof prime time TV.
p300
aa(lp301
VBut the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,
p302
aVthe vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.
p303
aVIt lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.
p304
aVI have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,
p305
aVwatched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel
p306
aVmore real than any textbook or any news story.
p307
aa(lp308
VThe people who create these games are smart.
p309
aVThey know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.
p310
aVThen they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.
p311
aVA well-designed video game will seamlessly
p312
aVweave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.
p313
aVAs one becomes more experienced
p314
aVthe awareness of physical control melts away.
p315
aVI know what I want and I do it.
p316
aVNo buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.
p317
aVMy fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.
p318
aVI know violent video games make my mother worry.
p319
aVWhat troubles me is not that video game violence
p320
aVis becoming more and more like real life violence,
p321
aVbut that real life violence is starting to look more and more
p322
aVlike a video game.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Music)
p325
aa(lp326
VThese are all troubles outside of myself.
p327
aVI, however, have a problem very close to home.
p328
aVSomething has happened to my brain.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Music)
p331
aa(lp332
VPerhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds
p333
aVall of our gut instincts, the things we know to do
p334
aVbefore we even think.
p335
aVWhile some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,
p336
aVand all of them are hardwired into our brains.
p337
aVThese instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.
p338
aVOnly in recent years has the technology behind video games
p339
aVallowed for a true overlap in stimuli.
p340
aVAs gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics
p341
aVin the same cities and doing many of the same things
p342
aVwe once did in real life, only virtually.
p343
aVConsider this \u2014
p344
aVmy real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.
p345
aVIn all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.
p346
aVTo some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.
p347
aVThe sensory cues are very similar.
p348
aVIt's a funny feeling when you have spent more time
p349
aVdoing something on the TV than you have in real life.
p350
aVWhen I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,
p351
aVthis is almost as beautiful as my games are.
p352
aa(lp353
VFor my virtual worlds are perfect.
p354
aVMore beautiful and rich than the real world around us.
p355
aVI'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,
p356
aVbut the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition
p357
aVon a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.
p358
aVToday I believe Big Brother would find much more success
p359
aVbrainwashing the masses with video games
p360
aVrather than just simply TVs.
p361
aVVideo games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain
p362
aVcompletely vulnerable to re-programming.
p363
aVBut maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.
p364
aa(lp365
VImagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,
p366
aVor helps us to understand the problems we're all facing
p367
aVin the real world.
p368
aVThere is a potential to do good as well.
p369
aVIt is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror
p370
aVthe real world we live in, that game developers realize
p371
aVthat they have tremendous responsibilities before them.
p372
aVI'm not sure what the future of video games holds
p373
aVfor our civilization.
p374
aVBut as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap
p375
aVthere is a greater and greater potential for other people
p376
aVto feel the same way I do.
p377
aa(lp378
VWhat I have only recently come to realize
p379
aVis that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion
p380
aVit is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating
p381
aVand addictive to me.
p382
aVI know that I am losing my grip.
p383
aVPart of me is just waiting to let go.
p384
aVI know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,
p385
aVor how flat the real world may seem to us,
p386
aVthat we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us
p387
aVand how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Applause)
p390
aa(lp391
VDP: Wow.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause)
p394
aa(lp395
VI found that video very, very thought provoking,
p396
aVand that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.
p397
aVAnd what was interesting about it is the obvious choice
p398
aVfor me to talk about was graphics and audio.
p399
aVBut as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.
p400
aVVideo games give an awful lot of other things too,
p401
aVand that's why people get so addicted.
p402
aVThe most important one being fun.
p403
aa(lp404
VThe name of this track is "The Magic To Come."
p405
aVWho is that going to come from?
p406
aVIs it going to come from the best directors in the world
p407
aVas we thought it probably would?
p408
aVI don't think so.
p409
aVI think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now
p410
aVthat aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.
p411
aVThey're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.
p412
aVThe same with students or highly creative people,
p413
aVwriters and people like that.
p414
aa(lp415
VAs far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the world
p416
aVteaching video game courses.
p417
aVThat means there's literally thousands of new ideas.
p418
aVSome of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.
p419
aVThere's nothing worse than having to listen to someone
p420
aVtry and pitch you a really bad video game idea.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
VChris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it.
p425
aVHe's out of time.
p426
aa(lp427
VDP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me.
p428
aa(lp429
VCA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though.
p430
aa(lp431
V(Laughter)
p432
aa(lp433
VDP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.
p434
aVThe school is closed; they're coming back at midnight
p435
aVbecause they want to pitch their video game ideas.
p436
aVI'm sitting at the front of the class,
p437
aVand they're actually pitching their ideas.
p438
aVSo it's hard to get students to come back to class,
p439
aVbut it is possible.
p440
aa(lp441
VThis is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old.
p442
aVAnd I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience
p443
aVin the video game world?
p444
aVAnd as I've shown here, we have the audience.
p445
aVShe's never going to know a world where you can't press a button
p446
aVand have millions of people ready to play.
p447
aVYou know, we have the technology.
p448
aVShe's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't
p449
aVstunning and really immersive.
p450
aVAnd as the student video showed, we can impact and move.
p451
aVShe's never going to know a world where video games
p452
aVaren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.
p453
aVI just hope she likes video games.

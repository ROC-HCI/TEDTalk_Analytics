VWhen we park in a big parking lot,
p5
aVhow do we remember where we parked our car?
p6
aVHere's the problem facing Homer.
p7
aVAnd we're going to try to understand
p8
aVwhat's happening in his brain.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,
p11
aVwhich is the organ of memory.
p12
aVIf you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's,
p13
aVyou can't remember things including where you parked your car.
p14
aVIt's named after Latin for "seahorse,"
p15
aVwhich it resembles.
p16
aVAnd like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo the human brain
p19
aVhas about a hundred billion neurons in it.
p20
aVAnd the neurons communicate with each other
p21
aVby sending little pulses or spikes of electricity
p22
aVvia connections to each other.
p23
aVThe hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells,
p24
aVwhich are very densely interconnected.
p25
aVAnd scientists have begun to understand
p26
aVhow spatial memory works
p27
aVby recording from individual neurons
p28
aVin rats or mice
p29
aVwhile they forage or explore an environment
p30
aVlooking for food.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron
p33
aVin the hippocampus of this rat here.
p34
aVAnd when it fires a little spike of electricity,
p35
aVthere's going to be a red dot and a click.
p36
aVSo what we see
p37
aVis that this neuron knows
p38
aVwhenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
p39
aVAnd it signals to the rest of the brain
p40
aVby sending a little electrical spike.
p41
aVSo we could show the firing rate of that neuron
p42
aVas a function of the animal's location.
p43
aVAnd if we record from lots of different neurons,
p44
aVwe'll see that different neurons fire
p45
aVwhen the animal goes in different parts of its environment,
p46
aVlike in this square box shown here.
p47
aVSo together they form a map
p48
aVfor the rest of the brain,
p49
aVtelling the brain continually,
p50
aV"Where am I now within my environment?"
p51
aa(lp52
VPlace cells are also being recorded in humans.
p53
aVSo epilepsy patients sometimes need
p54
aVthe electrical activity in their brain monitoring.
p55
aVAnd some of these patients played a video game
p56
aVwhere they drive around a small town.
p57
aVAnd place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active,
p58
aVstart sending electrical impulses
p59
aVwhenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo how does a place cell know
p62
aVwhere the rat or person is within its environment?
p63
aVWell these two cells here
p64
aVshow us that the boundaries of the environment
p65
aVare particularly important.
p66
aVSo the one on the top
p67
aVlikes to fire sort of midway between the walls
p68
aVof the box that their rat's in.
p69
aVAnd when you expand the box, the firing location expands.
p70
aVThe one below likes to fire
p71
aVwhenever there's a wall close by to the south.
p72
aVAnd if you put another wall inside the box,
p73
aVthen the cell fires in both place
p74
aVwherever there's a wall to the south
p75
aVas the animal explores around in its box.
p76
aVSo this predicts
p77
aVthat sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you \u2014
p78
aVextended buildings and so on \u2014
p79
aVis particularly important for the hippocampus.
p80
aVAnd indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus,
p81
aVcells are found which project into the hippocampus,
p82
aVwhich do respond exactly
p83
aVto detecting boundaries or edges
p84
aVat particular distances and directions
p85
aVfrom the rat or mouse
p86
aVas it's exploring around.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo the cell on the left, you can see,
p89
aVit fires whenever the animal gets near
p90
aVto a wall or a boundary to the east,
p91
aVwhether it's the edge or the wall of a square box
p92
aVor the circular wall of the circular box
p93
aVor even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.
p94
aVAnd the cell on the right there
p95
aVfires whenever there's a boundary to the south,
p96
aVwhether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall
p97
aVor even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
p98
aVSo that's one way in which we think
p99
aVplace cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
p100
aa(lp101
VWe can also test where we think objects are,
p102
aVlike this goal flag, in simple environments \u2014
p103
aVor indeed, where your car would be.
p104
aVSo we can have people explore an environment
p105
aVand see the location they have to remember.
p106
aVAnd then, if we put them back in the environment,
p107
aVgenerally they're quite good at putting a marker down
p108
aVwhere they thought that flag or their car was.
p109
aVBut on some trials,
p110
aVwe could change the shape and size of the environment
p111
aVlike we did with the place cell.
p112
aa(lp113
VIn that case, we can see
p114
aVhow where they think the flag had been changes
p115
aVas a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.
p116
aVAnd what you see, for example,
p117
aVif the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment,
p118
aVand then if you ask people where it was,
p119
aVbut you've made the environment bigger,
p120
aVwhere they think the flag had been
p121
aVstretches out in exactly the same way
p122
aVthat the place cell firing stretched out.
p123
aVIt's as if you remember where the flag was
p124
aVby storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells
p125
aVat that location,
p126
aVand then you can get back to that location
p127
aVby moving around
p128
aVso that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells
p129
aVwith that stored pattern.
p130
aVThat guides you back to the location that you want to remember.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut we also know where we are through movement.
p133
aVSo if we take some outbound path \u2014
p134
aVperhaps we park and we wander off \u2014
p135
aVwe know because our own movements,
p136
aVwhich we can integrate over this path
p137
aVroughly what the heading direction is to go back.
p138
aVAnd place cells also get this kind of path integration input
p139
aVfrom a kind of cell called a grid cell.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow grid cells are found, again,
p142
aVon the inputs to the hippocampus,
p143
aVand they're a bit like place cells.
p144
aVBut now as the rat explores around,
p145
aVeach individual cell fires
p146
aVin a whole array of different locations
p147
aVwhich are laid out across the environment
p148
aVin an amazingly regular triangular grid.
p149
aVAnd if you record from several grid cells \u2014
p150
aVshown here in different colors \u2014
p151
aVeach one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment,
p152
aVand each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly
p153
aVrelative to the other cells.
p154
aVSo the red one fires on this grid
p155
aVand the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo together, it's as if the rat
p158
aVcan put a virtual grid of firing locations
p159
aVacross its environment \u2014
p160
aVa bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map,
p161
aVbut using triangles.
p162
aVAnd as it moves around,
p163
aVthe electrical activity can pass
p164
aVfrom one of these cells to the next cell
p165
aVto keep track of where it is,
p166
aVso that it can use its own movements
p167
aVto know where it is in its environment.
p168
aa(lp169
VDo people have grid cells?
p170
aVWell because all of the grid-like firing patterns
p171
aVhave the same axes of symmetry,
p172
aVthe same orientations of grid, shown in orange here,
p173
aVit means that the net activity
p174
aVof all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain
p175
aVshould change
p176
aVaccording to whether we're running along these six directions
p177
aVor running along one of the six directions in between.
p178
aVSo we can put people in an MRI scanner
p179
aVand have them do a little video game
p180
aVlike the one I showed you
p181
aVand look for this signal.
p182
aVAnd indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex,
p183
aVwhich is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo back to Homer.
p186
aVHe's probably remembering where his car was
p187
aVin terms of the distances and directions
p188
aVto extended buildings and boundaries
p189
aVaround the location where he parked.
p190
aVAnd that would be represented
p191
aVby the firing of boundary-detecting cells.
p192
aVHe's also remembering the path he took out of the car park,
p193
aVwhich would be represented in the firing of grid cells.
p194
aVNow both of these kinds of cells
p195
aVcan make the place cells fire.
p196
aVAnd he can return to the location where he parked
p197
aVby moving so as to find where it is
p198
aVthat best matches the firing pattern
p199
aVof the place cells in his brain currently
p200
aVwith the stored pattern where he parked his car.
p201
aVAnd that guides him back to that location
p202
aVirrespective of visual cues
p203
aVlike whether his car's actually there.
p204
aVMaybe it's been towed.
p205
aVBut he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo beyond spatial memory,
p208
aVif we look for this grid-like firing pattern
p209
aVthroughout the whole brain,
p210
aVwe see it in a whole series of locations
p211
aVwhich are always active
p212
aVwhen we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks,
p213
aVlike remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.
p214
aVSo it may be that the neural mechanisms
p215
aVfor representing the space around us
p216
aVare also used for generating visual imagery
p217
aVso that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least,
p218
aVof the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo if this was happening,
p221
aVyour memories could start by place cells activating each other
p222
aVvia these dense interconnections
p223
aVand then reactivating boundary cells
p224
aVto create the spatial structure
p225
aVof the scene around your viewpoint.
p226
aVAnd grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.
p227
aVAnother kind of cell, head direction cells,
p228
aVwhich I didn't mention yet,
p229
aVthey fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.
p230
aVThey could define the viewing direction
p231
aVfrom which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery,
p232
aVso you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo this is just one example
p235
aVof a new era really
p236
aVin cognitive neuroscience
p237
aVwhere we're beginning to understand
p238
aVpsychological processes
p239
aVlike how you remember or imagine or even think
p240
aVin terms of the actions
p241
aVof the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.
p242
aa(lp243
VThank you very much.

VFor the next 16 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey
p5
aVthat is probably the biggest dream of humanity:
p6
aVto understand the code of life.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo for me, everything started many, many years ago
p9
aVwhen I met the first 3D printer.
p10
aVThe concept was fascinating.
p11
aVA 3D printer needs three elements:
p12
aVa bit of information, some raw material, some energy,
p13
aVand it can produce any object that was not there before.
p14
aa(lp15
VI was doing physics, I was coming back home
p16
aVand I realized that I actually always knew a 3D printer.
p17
aVAnd everyone does.
p18
aVIt was my mom.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VMy mom takes three elements:
p23
aVa bit of information, which is between my father and my mom in this case,
p24
aVraw elements and energy in the same media, that is food,
p25
aVand after several months, produces me.
p26
aVAnd I was not existent before.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a 3D printer,
p29
aVI immediately got mesmerized by that piece,
p30
aVthe first one, the information.
p31
aVWhat amount of information does it take
p32
aVto build and assemble a human?
p33
aVIs it much? Is it little?
p34
aVHow many thumb drives can you fill?
p35
aa(lp36
VWell, I was studying physics at the beginning
p37
aVand I took this approximation of a human as a gigantic Lego piece.
p38
aVSo, imagine that the building blocks are little atoms
p39
aVand there is a hydrogen here, a carbon here, a nitrogen here.
p40
aVSo in the first approximation,
p41
aVif I can list the number of atoms that compose a human being,
p42
aVI can build it.
p43
aVNow, you can run some numbers
p44
aVand that happens to be quite an astonishing number.
p45
aVSo the number of atoms,
p46
aVthe file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby,
p47
aVwill actually fill an entire Titanic of thumb drives \u2014
p48
aVmultiplied 2,000 times.
p49
aVThis is the miracle of life.
p50
aVEvery time you see from now on a pregnant lady,
p51
aVshe's assembling the biggest amount of information
p52
aVthat you will ever encounter.
p53
aVForget big data, forget anything you heard of.
p54
aVThis is the biggest amount of information that exists.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VBut nature, fortunately, is much smarter than a young physicist,
p59
aVand in four billion years, managed to pack this information
p60
aVin a small crystal we call DNA.
p61
aVWe met it for the first time in 1950 when Rosalind Franklin,
p62
aVan amazing scientist, a woman,
p63
aVtook a picture of it.
p64
aVBut it took us more than 40 years to finally poke inside a human cell,
p65
aVtake out this crystal,
p66
aVunroll it, and read it for the first time.
p67
aVThe code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet,
p68
aVfour letters: A, T, C and G.
p69
aVAnd to build a human, you need three billion of them.
p70
aVThree billion.
p71
aVHow many are three billion?
p72
aVIt doesn't really make any sense as a number, right?
p73
aa(lp74
VSo I was thinking how I could explain myself better
p75
aVabout how big and enormous this code is.
p76
aVBut there is \u2014 I mean, I'm going to have some help,
p77
aVand the best person to help me introduce the code
p78
aVis actually the first man to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.
p79
aVSo welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VNot the man in the flesh,
p84
aVbut for the first time in history,
p85
aVthis is the genome of a specific human,
p86
aVprinted page-by-page, letter-by-letter:
p87
aV262,000 pages of information,
p88
aV450 kilograms, shipped from the United States to Canada
p89
aVthanks to Bruno Bowden, Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything.
p90
aVIt was an amazing feat.
p91
aa(lp92
VBut this is the visual perception of what is the code of life.
p93
aVAnd now, for the first time, I can do something fun.
p94
aVI can actually poke inside it and read.
p95
aVSo let me take an interesting book ... like this one.
p96
aVI have an annotation; it's a fairly big book.
p97
aVSo just to let you see what is the code of life.
p98
aVThousands and thousands and thousands
p99
aVand millions of letters.
p100
aVAnd they apparently make sense.
p101
aVLet's get to a specific part.
p102
aVLet me read it to you:
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
V"AAG, AAT, ATA."
p107
aa(lp108
VTo you it sounds like mute letters,
p109
aVbut this sequence gives the color of the eyes to Craig.
p110
aVI'll show you another part of the book.
p111
aVThis is actually a little more complicated.
p112
aa(lp113
VChromosome 14, book 132:
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VAs you might expect.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
V"ATT, CTT, GATT."
p122
aa(lp123
VThis human is lucky,
p124
aVbecause if you miss just two letters in this position \u2014
p125
aVtwo letters of our three billion \u2014
p126
aVhe will be condemned to a terrible disease:
p127
aVcystic fibrosis.
p128
aVWe have no cure for it, we don't know how to solve it,
p129
aVand it's just two letters of difference from what we are.
p130
aa(lp131
VA wonderful book, a mighty book,
p132
aVa mighty book that helped me understand
p133
aVand show you something quite remarkable.
p134
aVEvery one of you \u2014 what makes me, me and you, you \u2014
p135
aVis just about five million of these,
p136
aVhalf a book.
p137
aVFor the rest,
p138
aVwe are all absolutely identical.
p139
aVFive hundred pages is the miracle of life that you are.
p140
aVThe rest, we all share it.
p141
aVSo think about that again when we think that we are different.
p142
aVThis is the amount that we share.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo now that I have your attention,
p145
aVthe next question is:
p146
aVHow do I read it?
p147
aVHow do I make sense out of it?
p148
aVWell, for however good you can be at assembling Swedish furniture,
p149
aVthis instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,
p154
aVPeter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself,
p155
aVdecided to assemble a new company.
p156
aVHuman Longevity was born,
p157
aVwith one mission:
p158
aVtrying everything we can try
p159
aVand learning everything we can learn from these books,
p160
aVwith one target \u2014
p161
aVmaking real the dream of personalized medicine,
p162
aVunderstanding what things should be done to have better health
p163
aVand what are the secrets in these books.
p164
aa(lp165
VAn amazing team, 40 data scientists and many, many more people,
p166
aVa pleasure to work with.
p167
aVThe concept is actually very simple.
p168
aVWe're going to use a technology called machine learning.
p169
aVOn one side, we have genomes \u2014 thousands of them.
p170
aVOn the other side, we collected the biggest database of human beings:
p171
aVphenotypes, 3D scan, NMR \u2014 everything you can think of.
p172
aVInside there, on these two opposite sides,
p173
aVthere is the secret of translation.
p174
aVAnd in the middle, we build a machine.
p175
aVWe build a machine and we train a machine \u2014
p176
aVwell, not exactly one machine, many, many machines \u2014
p177
aVto try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype.
p178
aVWhat are those letters, and what do they do?
p179
aVIt's an approach that can be used for everything,
p180
aVbut using it in genomics is particularly complicated.
p181
aVLittle by little we grew and we wanted to build different challenges.
p182
aVWe started from the beginning, from common traits.
p183
aVCommon traits are comfortable because they are common,
p184
aVeveryone has them.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo we started to ask our questions:
p187
aVCan we predict height?
p188
aVCan we read the books and predict your height?
p189
aVWell, we actually can,
p190
aVwith five centimeters of precision.
p191
aVBMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,
p192
aVbut we still can, we get in the ballpark, eight kilograms of precision.
p193
aVCan we predict eye color?
p194
aVYeah, we can.
p195
aVEighty percent accuracy.
p196
aVCan we predict skin color?
p197
aVYeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.
p198
aVCan we predict age?
p199
aVWe can, because apparently, the code changes during your life.
p200
aVIt gets shorter, you lose pieces, it gets insertions.
p201
aVWe read the signals, and we make a model.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow, an interesting challenge:
p204
aVCan we predict a human face?
p205
aVIt's a little complicated,
p206
aVbecause a human face is scattered among millions of these letters.
p207
aVAnd a human face is not a very well-defined object.
p208
aVSo, we had to build an entire tier of it
p209
aVto learn and teach a machine what a face is,
p210
aVand embed and compress it.
p211
aVAnd if you're comfortable with machine learning,
p212
aVyou understand what the challenge is here.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, after 15 years \u2014 15 years after we read the first sequence \u2014
p215
aVthis October, we started to see some signals.
p216
aVAnd it was a very emotional moment.
p217
aVWhat you see here is a subject coming in our lab.
p218
aVThis is a face for us.
p219
aVSo we take the real face of a subject, we reduce the complexity,
p220
aVbecause not everything is in your face \u2014
p221
aVlots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life.
p222
aVWe symmetrize the face, and we run our algorithm.
p223
aVThe results that I show you right now,
p224
aVthis is the prediction we have from the blood.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Applause)
p227
aa(lp228
VWait a second.
p229
aVIn these seconds, your eyes are watching, left and right, left and right,
p230
aVand your brain wants those pictures to be identical.
p231
aVSo I ask you to do another exercise, to be honest.
p232
aVPlease search for the differences,
p233
aVwhich are many.
p234
aVThe biggest amount of signal comes from gender,
p235
aVthen there is age, BMI, the ethnicity component of a human.
p236
aVAnd scaling up over that signal is much more complicated.
p237
aVBut what you see here, even in the differences,
p238
aVlets you understand that we are in the right ballpark,
p239
aVthat we are getting closer.
p240
aVAnd it's already giving you some emotions.
p241
aa(lp242
VThis is another subject that comes in place,
p243
aVand this is a prediction.
p244
aVA little smaller face, we didn't get the complete cranial structure,
p245
aVbut still, it's in the ballpark.
p246
aVThis is a subject that comes in our lab,
p247
aVand this is the prediction.
p248
aVSo these people have never been seen in the training of the machine.
p249
aVThese are the so-called "held-out" set.
p250
aVBut these are people that you will probably never believe.
p251
aVWe're publishing everything in a scientific publication,
p252
aVyou can read it.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut since we are onstage, Chris challenged me.
p255
aVI probably exposed myself and tried to predict
p256
aVsomeone that you might recognize.
p257
aVSo, in this vial of blood \u2014 and believe me, you have no idea
p258
aVwhat we had to do to have this blood now, here \u2014
p259
aVin this vial of blood is the amount of biological information
p260
aVthat we need to do a full genome sequence.
p261
aVWe just need this amount.
p262
aVWe ran this sequence, and I'm going to do it with you.
p263
aVAnd we start to layer up all the understanding we have.
p264
aVIn the vial of blood, we predicted he's a male.
p265
aVAnd the subject is a male.
p266
aVWe predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.
p267
aVThe subject is a meter and 77 cm.
p268
aVSo, we predicted that he's 76; the subject is 82.
p269
aVWe predict his age, 38.
p270
aVThe subject is 35.
p271
aVWe predict his eye color.
p272
aVToo dark.
p273
aVWe predict his skin color.
p274
aVWe are almost there.
p275
aVThat's his face.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, the reveal moment:
p278
aVthe subject is this person.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd I did it intentionally.
p283
aVI am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity.
p284
aVSouthern European, Italians \u2014 they never fit in models.
p285
aVAnd it's particular \u2014 that ethnicity is a complex corner case for our model.
p286
aVBut there is another point.
p287
aVSo, one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people
p288
aVwill never be written in the genome.
p289
aVIt's our free will, it's how I look.
p290
aVNot my haircut in this case, but my beard cut.
p291
aVSo I'm going to show you, I'm going to, in this case, transfer it \u2014
p292
aVand this is nothing more than Photoshop, no modeling \u2014
p293
aVthe beard on the subject.
p294
aVAnd immediately, we get much, much better in the feeling.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo, why do we do this?
p297
aVWe certainly don't do it for predicting height
p298
aVor taking a beautiful picture out of your blood.
p299
aVWe do it because the same technology and the same approach,
p300
aVthe machine learning of this code,
p301
aVis helping us to understand how we work,
p302
aVhow your body works,
p303
aVhow your body ages,
p304
aVhow disease generates in your body,
p305
aVhow your cancer grows and develops,
p306
aVhow drugs work
p307
aVand if they work on your body.
p308
aa(lp309
VThis is a huge challenge.
p310
aVThis is a challenge that we share
p311
aVwith thousands of other researchers around the world.
p312
aVIt's called personalized medicine.
p313
aVIt's the ability to move from a statistical approach
p314
aVwhere you're a dot in the ocean,
p315
aVto a personalized approach,
p316
aVwhere we read all these books
p317
aVand we get an understanding of exactly how you are.
p318
aVBut it is a particularly complicated challenge,
p319
aVbecause of all these books, as of today,
p320
aVwe just know probably two percent:
p321
aVfour books of more than 175.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd this is not the topic of my talk,
p324
aVbecause we will learn more.
p325
aVThere are the best minds in the world on this topic.
p326
aVThe prediction will get better,
p327
aVthe model will get more precise.
p328
aVAnd the more we learn,
p329
aVthe more we will be confronted with decisions
p330
aVthat we never had to face before
p331
aVabout life,
p332
aVabout death,
p333
aVabout parenting.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo, we are touching the very inner detail on how life works.
p336
aVAnd it's a revolution that cannot be confined
p337
aVin the domain of science or technology.
p338
aVThis must be a global conversation.
p339
aVWe must start to think of the future we're building as a humanity.
p340
aVWe need to interact with creatives, with artists, with philosophers,
p341
aVwith politicians.
p342
aVEveryone is involved,
p343
aVbecause it's the future of our species.
p344
aVWithout fear, but with the understanding
p345
aVthat the decisions that we make in the next year
p346
aVwill change the course of history forever.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you.

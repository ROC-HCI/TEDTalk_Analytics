VAs a conceptual artist,
p5
aVI'm constantly looking for creative ways to spark challenging conversations.
p6
aVI do this though painting, sculpture, video and performance.
p7
aVBut regardless of the format,
p8
aVtwo of my favorite materials are history and dialogue.
p9
aa(lp10
VIn 2007, I created "Lotus,"
p11
aVa seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,
p12
aV600-pound glass depiction of a lotus blossom.
p13
aVIn Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol for transcendence
p14
aVand for purity of mind and spirit.
p15
aVBut a closer look at this lotus
p16
aVreveals each petal to be the cross-section of a slave ship.
p17
aVThis iconic diagram was taken from a British slaving manual
p18
aVand later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery.
p19
aVIn America, we don't like to talk about slavery,
p20
aVnor do we look at it as a global industry.
p21
aVBut by using this Buddhist symbol,
p22
aVI hope to universalize and transcend
p23
aVthe history and trauma of black America
p24
aVand encourage discussions about our shared past.
p25
aa(lp26
VTo create "Lotus," we carved over 6,000 figures.
p27
aVAnd this later led to a commission by the City of New York
p28
aVto create a 28-foot version in steel
p29
aVas a permanent installation at the Eagle Academy for Young Men,
p30
aVa school for black and latino students,
p31
aVthe two groups most affected by this history.
p32
aVThe same two groups are very affected by a more recent phenomenon,
p33
aVbut let me digress.
p34
aa(lp35
VI've been collecting wooden African figures
p36
aVfrom tourist shops and flea markets around the world.
p37
aVThe authenticity and origin of them is completely debatable,
p38
aVbut people believe these to be imbued with power,
p39
aVor even magic.
p40
aVOnly recently have I figured out how to use this in my own work.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Gun shots)
p43
aa(lp44
VSince 2012, the world has witnessed the killings of Trayvon Martin,
p45
aVMichael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice
p46
aVand literally countless other unarmed black citizens
p47
aVat the hands of the police,
p48
aVwho frequently walk away with no punishment at all.
p49
aVIn consideration of these victims
p50
aVand the several times that even I,
p51
aVa law-abiding, Ivy League professor,
p52
aVhave been targeted and harassed at gunpoint by the police.
p53
aVI created this body of work simply entitled "BAM."
p54
aa(lp55
VIt was important to erase the identity of each of these figures,
p56
aVto make them all look the same and easier to disregard.
p57
aVTo do this, I dip them in a thick, brown wax
p58
aVbefore taking them to a shooting range
p59
aVwhere I re-sculpted them using bullets.
p60
aVAnd it was fun,
p61
aVplaying with big guns and high-speed video cameras.
p62
aVBut my reverence for these figures kept me from actually pulling the trigger,
p63
aVsomehow feeling as if I would be shooting myself.
p64
aVFinally, my cameraman, Raul, fired the shots.
p65
aVI then took the fragments of these
p66
aVand created molds, and cast them first in wax,
p67
aVand finally in bronze like the image you see here,
p68
aVwhich bears the marks of its violent creation
p69
aVlike battle wounds or scars.
p70
aa(lp71
VWhen I showed this work recently in Miami,
p72
aVa woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul.
p73
aVBut she also felt that these artworks
p74
aVmemorialized the victims of these killings
p75
aVas well as other victims of racial violence throughout US history.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger than just US history.
p78
aVWhile showing in Berlin last year,
p79
aVa philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings.
p80
aVI showed him a photo of a lynching postcard
p81
aVfrom the early 1900s
p82
aVand reminded him that these killings have been going on for over 500 years.
p83
aVBut it's only through questions like his
p84
aVand more thoughtful dialogue about history and race
p85
aVcan we evolve as individuals and society.
p86
aa(lp87
VI hope my artwork creates a safe space
p88
aVfor this type of honest exchange
p89
aVand an opportunity for people to engage one another
p90
aVin real and necessary conversation.
p91
aa(lp92
VThank you.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Applause)

Sanford Biggers creates artworks that integrate film, video, installation, sculpture, drawing, original music and performance. He intentionally complicates issues such as hip hop, Buddhism, politics, identity and art history in order to offer new perspectives and associations for established symbols. Through a multi-disciplinary formal process and a syncretic creative approach, he makes works that are as aesthetically pleasing as they are conceptual.</p><p>The significance of Biggers&#39; work within contemporary society has been celebrated through solo exhibitions both nationally and internationally, most recently at the Brooklyn Museum, Sculpture Center and Mass MoCA. He has participated in prestigious residencies and fellowships including: Akademie Schloss Solitude, Stuttgart, Germany; Ujazdowski Castle, Warsaw, Poland; Headlands Center for the Arts, Sausalito, California; ARCUS Project Foundation, Ibaraki, Japan; and the Art in General/ Trafo Gallery Eastern European Exchange in Budapest, Hungary. He has been a fellow of the Creative Time Global Residency, the Socrates Sculpture Park Residency, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council World Views AIR Program, the Eyebeam Atelier Teaching Residency, the Studio Museum AIR Program, the P.S. 1 International Studio Program and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture residency.</p><p>Biggers&#39; installations, videos and performances have appeared in venues worldwide including Tate Britain and Tate Modern in London, the Whitney Museum and Studio Museum in Harlem, New York and the Yerba Bue a Center for the Arts in San Francisco, as well as institutions in China, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Poland and Russia. The artist&#39;s works have been included in notable exhibitions such as: Prospect 1 New Orleans Biennial, Illuminations at the Tate Modern, Performa 07 in NY, the Whitney Biennial and Freestyle at the Studio Museum in Harlem. His works are included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Walker Art Center, Whitney Museum, Brooklyn Museum and Bronx Museum.</p><p>Biggers has won awards including: the American Academy in Berlin Prize, Greenfield Prize, New York City Art Teachers Association Artist-of-the-Year, Creative Time Travel Grant, Creative Capital Project Grant, New York Percent for the Arts Commission, Art Matters Grant, New York Foundation for the Arts Award, the Lambent Fellowship in the Arts, the Pennies From Heaven/ New York Community Trust Award, Tanne Foundation Award and Rema Hort Mann Foundation Award Grant.</p><p>Biggers is Assistant Professor at Columbia University&#39;s Visual Arts program and a board member of Sculpture Center, Soho House and the CUE Foundation.

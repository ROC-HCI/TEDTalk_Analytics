VChris Anderson: This is such a strange thing.
p5
aVYour software, Linux, is in millions of computers,
p6
aVit probably powers much of the Internet.
p7
aVAnd I think that there are, like,
p8
aVa billion and a half active Android devices out there.
p9
aVYour software is in every single one of them.
p10
aVIt's kind of amazing.
p11
aVYou must have some amazing software headquarters driving all this.
p12
aVThat's what I thought \u2014 and I was shocked when I saw a picture of it.
p13
aVI mean, this is \u2014
p14
aVthis is the Linux world headquarters.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
V(Applause)
p19
aa(lp20
VLinus Torvalds: It really doesn't look like much.
p21
aVAnd I have to say,
p22
aVthe most interesting part in this picture,
p23
aVthat people mostly react to,
p24
aVis the walking desk.
p25
aVIt is the most interesting part in my office
p26
aVand I'm not actually using it anymore.
p27
aVAnd I think the two things are related.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe way I work is ...
p30
aVI want to not have external stimulation.
p31
aVYou can kind of see, on the walls are this light green.
p32
aVI'm told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VIt's like a calming color,
p37
aVit's not something that really stimulates you.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhat you can't see is the computer here, you only see the screen,
p40
aVbut the main thing I worry about in my computer is \u2014
p41
aVit doesn't have to be big and powerful, although I like that \u2014
p42
aVit really has to be completely silent.
p43
aVI know people who work for Google
p44
aVand they have their own small data center at home,
p45
aVand I don't do that.
p46
aVMy office is the most boring office you'll ever see.
p47
aVAnd I sit there alone in the quiet.
p48
aVIf the cat comes up,
p49
aVit sits in my lap.
p50
aVAnd I want to hear the cat purring,
p51
aVnot the sound of the fans in the computer.
p52
aa(lp53
VCA: So this is astonishing,
p54
aVbecause working this way,
p55
aVyou're able to run this vast technology empire \u2014
p56
aVit is an empire \u2014
p57
aVso that's an amazing testament to the power of open source.
p58
aa(lp59
VTell us how you got to understand open source
p60
aVand how it lead to the development of Linux.
p61
aa(lp62
VLT: I mean, I still work alone.
p63
aVReally \u2014 I work alone in my house,
p64
aVoften in my bathrobe.
p65
aVWhen a photographer shows up, I dress up,
p66
aVso I have clothes on.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd that's how I've always worked.
p71
aVI mean, this was how I started Linux, too.
p72
aVI did not start Linux as a collaborative project.
p73
aVI started it as one in a series of many projects
p74
aVI had done at the time for myself,
p75
aVpartly because I needed the end result,
p76
aVbut even more because I just enjoyed programming.
p77
aVSo it was about the end of the journey,
p78
aVwhich, 25 years later, we still have not reached.
p79
aVBut it was really about the fact that I was looking for a project on my own
p80
aVand there was no open source, really, on my radar at all.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd what happened is ...
p83
aVthe project grows and becomes something you want to show off to people.
p84
aVReally, this is more of a, "Wow, look at what I did!"
p85
aVAnd trust me \u2014 it was not that great back then.
p86
aVI made it publicly available,
p87
aVand it wasn't even open source at that point.
p88
aVAt that point it was source that was open, but there was no intention
p89
aVbehind using the kind of open-source methodology that we think of today
p90
aVto improve it.
p91
aVIt was more like,
p92
aV"Look, I've been working on this for half a year,
p93
aVI'd love to have comments."
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd other people approached me.
p96
aVAt the University of Helsinki,
p97
aVI had a friend who was one of the open source \u2014
p98
aVit was called mainly "free software" back then \u2014
p99
aVand he actually introduced me to the notion that, hey,
p100
aVyou can use these open-source licenses that had been around.
p101
aVAnd I thought about it for a while.
p102
aVI was actually worried about the whole commercial interests coming in.
p103
aVI mean, that's one of the worries I think most people who start out have,
p104
aVis that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work, right?
p105
aVAnd I decided, "What the hell?"
p106
aVAnd \u2014
p107
aa(lp108
VCA: And then at some point,
p109
aVsomeone contributed some code that you thought,
p110
aV"Wow, that really is interesting, I would not have thought of that.
p111
aVThis could actually improve this."
p112
aa(lp113
VLT: It didn't even start by people contributing code,
p114
aVit was more that people started contributing ideas.
p115
aVAnd just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project \u2014
p116
aVand I'm sure it's true of other things, too,
p117
aVbut it's definitely true in code \u2014
p118
aVis that somebody else takes an interest in your code,
p119
aVlooks at it enough to actually give you feedback
p120
aVand give you ideas.
p121
aVThat was a huge thing for me.
p122
aa(lp123
VI was 21 at the time, so I was young,
p124
aVbut I had already programmed for half my life, basically.
p125
aVAnd every project before that had been completely personal
p126
aVand it was a revelation when people just started commenting,
p127
aVstarted giving feedback on your code.
p128
aVAnd even before they started giving code back,
p129
aVthat was, I think, one of the big moments where I said,
p130
aV"I love other people!"
p131
aVDon't get me wrong \u2014
p132
aVI'm actually not a people person.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VI don't really love other people \u2014
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VBut I love computers,
p141
aVI love interacting with other people on email,
p142
aVbecause it kind of gives you that buffer.
p143
aVBut I do love other people who comment and get involved in my project.
p144
aVAnd it made it so much more.
p145
aa(lp146
VCA: So was there a moment when you saw what was being built
p147
aVand it suddenly started taking off,
p148
aVand you thought, "Wait a sec, this actually could be something huge,
p149
aVnot just a personal project that I'm getting nice feedback on,
p150
aVbut a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world"?
p151
aa(lp152
VLT: Not really.
p153
aVI mean, the big point for me, really, was not when it was becoming huge,
p154
aVit was when it was becoming little.
p155
aVThe big point for me was not being alone
p156
aVand having 10, maybe 100 people being involved \u2014
p157
aVthat was a big point.
p158
aVThen everything else was very gradual.
p159
aVGoing from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal \u2014 to me.
p160
aVWell, I mean, maybe it is if you're \u2014
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VIf you want to sell your result then it's a huge deal \u2014
p165
aVdon't get me wrong.
p166
aVBut if you're interested in the technology
p167
aVand you're interested in the project,
p168
aVthe big part was getting the community.
p169
aVThen the community grew gradually.
p170
aVAnd there's actually not a single point where I went like,
p171
aV"Wow, that just took off!" because it \u2014
p172
aVI mean \u2014 it took a long time, relatively.
p173
aa(lp174
VCA: So all the technologists that I talk to really credit you
p175
aVwith massively changing their work.
p176
aVAnd it's not just Linux,
p177
aVit's this thing called Git,
p178
aVwhich is this management system for software development.
p179
aVTell us briefly about that and your role in that.
p180
aa(lp181
VLT: So one of the issues we had,
p182
aVand this took a while to start to appear,
p183
aVis when you ...
p184
aVWhen you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project
p185
aVto having 10,000 people, which \u2014
p186
aVI mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel,
p187
aVwe have 1,000 people involved in every single release
p188
aVand that's every two months, roughly two or three months.
p189
aVSome of those people don't do a lot.
p190
aVThere's a lot of people who make small, small changes.
p191
aa(lp192
VBut to maintain this,
p193
aVthe scale changes how you have to maintain it.
p194
aVAnd we went through a lot of pain.
p195
aVAnd there are whole projects that do only source-code maintenance.
p196
aVCVS is the one that used to be the most commonly used,
p197
aVand I hated CVS with a passion and refused to touch it
p198
aVand tried something else that was radical and interesting
p199
aVand everybody else hated.
p200
aa(lp201
VCA: (Laughs)
p202
aa(lp203
VLT: And we were in this bad spot,
p204
aVwhere we had thousands of people who wanted to participate,
p205
aVbut in many ways, I was the kind of break point,
p206
aVwhere I could not scale to the point
p207
aVwhere I could work with thousands of people.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo Git is my second big project,
p210
aVwhich was only created for me to maintain my first big project.
p211
aVAnd this is literally how I work.
p212
aVI don't code for \u2014
p213
aVwell, I do code for fun \u2014
p214
aVbut I want to code for something meaningful
p215
aVso every single project I've ever done has been something I needed
p216
aVand \u2014
p217
aa(lp218
VCA: So really, both Linux and Git kind of arose
p219
aValmost as an unintended consequence
p220
aVof your desire not to have to work with too many people.
p221
aa(lp222
VLT: Absolutely. Yes.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VCA: That's amazing. LT: Yeah.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd yet, you're the man who's transformed technology
p231
aVnot just once but twice,
p232
aVand we have to try and understand why it is.
p233
aVYou've given us some clues, but ...
p234
aVHere's a picture of you as a kid, with a Rubik's Cube.
p235
aVYou mentioned that you've been programming since you were like 10 or 11,
p236
aVhalf your life.
p237
aa(lp238
VWere you this sort of computer genius, you know, übernerd,
p239
aVwere you the star at school who could do everything?
p240
aVWhat were you like as a kid?
p241
aa(lp242
VLT: Yeah, I think I was the prototypical nerd.
p243
aVI mean, I was ...
p244
aVI was not a people person back then.
p245
aVThat's my younger brother.
p246
aVI was clearly more interested in the Rubik's Cube
p247
aVthan my younger brother.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VMy younger sister, who's not in the picture,
p252
aVwhen we had family meetings \u2014
p253
aVand it's not a huge family, but I have, like, a couple of cousins \u2014
p254
aVshe would prep me beforehand.
p255
aVLike, before I stepped into the room she would say,
p256
aV"OK. That's so-and-so ..."
p257
aVBecause I was not \u2014
p258
aVI was a geek.
p259
aVI was into computers,
p260
aVI was into math,
p261
aVI was into physics.
p262
aVI was good at that.
p263
aVI don't think I was particularly exceptional.
p264
aVApparently, my sister said
p265
aVthat my biggest exceptional quality was that I would not let go.
p266
aa(lp267
VCA: OK, so let's go there, because that's interesting.
p268
aVYou would not let go.
p269
aVSo that's not about being a geek and being smart,
p270
aVthat's about being ... stubborn?
p271
aa(lp272
VLT: That's about being stubborn.
p273
aVThat's about, like,
p274
aVjust starting something
p275
aVand not saying, "OK, I'm done, let's do something else \u2014
p276
aVLook: shiny!"
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd I notice that in many other parts in my life, too.
p279
aVI lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.
p280
aVAnd I worked for the same company, in Silicon Valley,
p281
aVfor the whole time.
p282
aVThat is unheard of.
p283
aVThat's not how Silicon Valley works.
p284
aVThe whole point of Silicon Valley is that people jump between jobs
p285
aVto kind of mix up the pot.
p286
aVAnd that's not the kind of person I am.
p287
aa(lp288
VCA: But during the actual development of Linux itself,
p289
aVthat stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people.
p290
aVTalk about that a bit.
p291
aVWas that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built?
p292
aVHow would you describe what happened?
p293
aa(lp294
VLT: I don't know if it's essential.
p295
aVGoing back to the "I'm not a people person," \u2014
p296
aVsometimes I'm also ...
p297
aVshall we say,
p298
aV"myopic" when it comes to other people's feelings,
p299
aVand that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people.
p300
aVAnd I'm not proud of that.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VBut, at the same time, it's \u2014
p305
aVI get people who tell me that I should be nice.
p306
aVAnd then when I try to explain to them that maybe you're nice,
p307
aVmaybe you should be more aggressive,
p308
aVthey see that as me being not nice.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VWhat I'm trying to say is we are different.
p313
aVI'm not a people person;
p314
aVit's not something I'm particularly proud of,
p315
aVbut it's part of me.
p316
aVAnd one of the things I really like about open source
p317
aVis it really allows different people to work together.
p318
aVWe don't have to like each other \u2014
p319
aVand sometimes we really don't like each other.
p320
aVReally \u2014 I mean, there are very, very heated arguments.
p321
aVBut you can, actually, you can find things that \u2014
p322
aVyou don't even agree to disagree,
p323
aVit's just that you're interested in really different things.
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd coming back to the point where I said earlier
p326
aVthat I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work,
p327
aVit turned out, and very quickly turned out,
p328
aVthat those commercial people were lovely, lovely people.
p329
aVAnd they did all the things that I was not at all interested in doing,
p330
aVand they had completely different goals.
p331
aVAnd they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go.
p332
aVBut because it was open source they could do it,
p333
aVand it actually works really beautifully together.
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd I actually think it works the same way.
p336
aVYou need to have the people-people, the communicators,
p337
aVthe warm and friendly people
p338
aVwho like \u2014
p339
aa(lp340
V(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
Vreally want to hug you and get you into the community.
p343
aVBut that's not everybody.
p344
aVAnd that's not me.
p345
aVI care about the technology.
p346
aVThere are people who care about the UI.
p347
aVI can't do UI to save my life.
p348
aVI mean, if I was stranded on an island
p349
aVand the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI,
p350
aVI'd die there.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VSo there's different kinds of people,
p355
aVand I'm not making excuses, I'm trying to explain.
p356
aa(lp357
VCA: Now, when we talked last week,
p358
aVyou talked about some other trait that you have,
p359
aVwhich I found really interesting.
p360
aVIt's this idea called taste.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd I've just got a couple of images here.
p363
aVI think this is an example of not particularly good taste in code,
p364
aVand this one is better taste,
p365
aVwhich one can immediately see.
p366
aVWhat is the difference between these two?
p367
aa(lp368
VLT: So this is \u2014
p369
aVHow many people here actually have coded?
p370
aa(lp371
VCA: Oh my goodness.
p372
aa(lp373
VLT: So I guarantee you,
p374
aVeverybody who raised their hand,
p375
aVthey have done what's called a singly-linked list.
p376
aVAnd it's taught \u2014
p377
aVThis, the first not very good taste approach,
p378
aVis basically how it's taught to be done when you start out coding.
p379
aVAnd you don't have to understand the code.
p380
aa(lp381
VThe most interesting part to me
p382
aVis the last if statement.
p383
aVBecause what happens in a singly-linked list \u2014
p384
aVthis is trying to remove an existing entry from a list \u2014
p385
aVand there's a difference between if it's the first entry
p386
aVor whether it's an entry in the middle.
p387
aVBecause if it's the first entry,
p388
aVyou have to change the pointer to the first entry.
p389
aVIf it's in the middle,
p390
aVyou have to change the pointer of a previous entry.
p391
aVSo they're two completely different cases.
p392
aa(lp393
VCA: And that's better.
p394
aa(lp395
VLT: And this is better.
p396
aVIt does not have the if statement.
p397
aVAnd it doesn't really matter \u2014
p398
aVI don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement,
p399
aVbut I want you to understand
p400
aVthat sometimes you can see a problem in a different way
p401
aVand rewrite it so that a special case goes away
p402
aVand becomes the normal case.
p403
aVAnd that's good code.
p404
aVBut this is simple code.
p405
aVThis is CS 101.
p406
aVThis is not important \u2014 although, details are important.
p407
aa(lp408
VTo me, the sign of people I really want to work with
p409
aVis that they have good taste, which is how ...
p410
aVI sent you this stupid example
p411
aVthat is not relevant because it's too small.
p412
aVGood taste is much bigger than this.
p413
aVGood taste is about really seeing the big patterns
p414
aVand kind of instinctively knowing what's the right way to do things.
p415
aa(lp416
VCA: OK, so we're putting the pieces together here now.
p417
aVYou have taste,
p418
aVin a way that's meaningful to software people.
p419
aVYou're \u2014
p420
aa(lp421
V(Laughter)
p422
aa(lp423
VLT: I think it was meaningful to some people here.
p424
aa(lp425
VCA: You're a very smart computer coder,
p426
aVand you're hellish stubborn.
p427
aVBut there must be something else.
p428
aVI mean, you've changed the future.
p429
aVYou must have the ability of these grand visions of the future.
p430
aVYou're a visionary, right?
p431
aa(lp432
VLT: I've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED
p433
aVfor the last two days,
p434
aVbecause there's a lot of vision going on, right?
p435
aVAnd I am not a visionary.
p436
aVI do not have a five-year plan.
p437
aVI'm an engineer.
p438
aVAnd I think it's really \u2014
p439
aVI mean \u2014 I'm perfectly happy with all the people
p440
aVwho are walking around and just staring at the clouds
p441
aVand looking at the stars and saying, "I want to go there."
p442
aVBut I'm looking at the ground,
p443
aVand I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me
p444
aVbefore I fall in.
p445
aVThis is the kind of person I am.
p446
aa(lp447
V(Cheers)
p448
aa(lp449
V(Applause)
p450
aa(lp451
VCA: So you spoke to me last week about these two guys.
p452
aVWho are they and how do you relate to them?
p453
aa(lp454
VLT: Well, so this is kind of cliché in technology,
p455
aVthe whole Tesla versus Edison,
p456
aVwhere Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man.
p457
aVAnd people love Tesla.
p458
aVI mean, there are people who name their companies after him.
p459
aa(lp460
V(Laughter)
p461
aa(lp462
VThe other person there is Edison,
p463
aVwho is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian
p464
aVand is \u2014
p465
aVI mean, his most famous quote is,
p466
aV"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration."
p467
aVAnd I'm in the Edison camp,

aVeven if people don't always like him.
p469
aVBecause if you actually compare the two,
p470
aVTesla has kind of this mind grab these days,
p471
aVbut who actually changed the world?
p472
aVEdison may not have been a nice person,
p473
aVhe did a lot of things \u2014
p474
aVhe was maybe not so intellectual,
p475
aVnot so visionary.
p476
aVBut I think I'm more of an Edison than a Tesla.
p477
aa(lp478
VCA: So our theme at TED this week is dreams \u2014
p479
aVbig, bold, audacious dreams.
p480
aVYou're really the antidote to that.
p481
aa(lp482
VLT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.
p483
aa(lp484
VCA: That's good.
p485
aa(lp486
V(Laughter)
p487
aVWe embrace you, we embrace you.
p488
aa(lp489
VCompanies like Google and many others have made, arguably,
p490
aVlike, billions of dollars out of your software.
p491
aVDoes that piss you off?
p492
aa(lp493
VLT: No.
p494
aVNo, it doesn't piss me off for several reasons.
p495
aVAnd one of them is, I'm doing fine.
p496
aVI'm really doing fine.
p497
aa(lp498
VBut the other reason is \u2014
p499
aVI mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing,
p500
aVLinux would never have been what it is.
p501
aVAnd it's brought experiences I don't really enjoy, public talking,
p502
aVbut at the same time, this is an experience.
p503
aVTrust me.
p504
aVSo there's a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man
p505
aVand thinking I did the right choices.
p506
aa(lp507
VCA: Is the open source idea \u2014
p508
aVthis is, I think we'll end here \u2014
p509
aVis the open source idea fully realized now in the world,
p510
aVor is there more that it could go,
p511
aVare there more things that it could do?
p512
aa(lp513
VLT: So, I'm of two minds there.
p514
aVI think one reason open source works so well in code
p515
aVis that at the end of the day,
p516
aVcode tends to be somewhat black and white.
p517
aVThere's often a fairly good way to decide,
p518
aVthis is done correctly and this is not done well.
p519
aVCode either works or it doesn't,
p520
aVwhich means that there's less room for arguments.
p521
aVAnd we have arguments despite this, right?
p522
aVIn many other areas \u2014
p523
aVI mean, people have talked about open politics and things like that \u2014
p524
aVand it's really hard sometimes to say
p525
aVthat, yes, you can apply the same principles in some other areas
p526
aVjust because the black and white turns into not just gray,
p527
aVbut different colors.
p528
aa(lp529
VSo, obviously open source in science is making a comeback.
p530
aVScience was there first.
p531
aVBut then science ended up being pretty closed,
p532
aVwith very expensive journals and some of that going on.
p533
aVAnd open source is making a comeback in science,
p534
aVwith things like arXiv and open journals.
p535
aVWikipedia changed the world, too.
p536
aVSo there are other examples,
p537
aVI'm sure there are more to come.
p538
aa(lp539
VCA: But you're not a visionary,
p540
aVand so it's not up to you to name them.
p541
aa(lp542
VLT: No.
p543
aa(lp544
V(Laughter)
p545
aa(lp546
VIt's up to you guys to make them, right?
p547
aa(lp548
VCA: Exactly.
p549
aa(lp550
VLinus Torvalds,
p551
aVthank you for Linux, thank you for the Internet,
p552
aVthank you for all those Android phones.
p553
aa(lp554
VThank you for coming here to TED and revealing so much of yourself.
p555
aa(lp556
VLT: Thank you.

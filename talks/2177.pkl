VWhen I was invited to give this talk  a couple of months ago,
p5
aVwe discussed a number  of titles with the organizers,
p6
aVand a lot of different items were  kicked around and were discussed.
p7
aVBut nobody suggested this one,
p8
aVand the reason for that was two months ago,
p9
aVEbola was escalating exponentially
p10
aVand spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen,
p11
aVand the world was terrified,  concerned and alarmed
p12
aVby this disease, in a way we've not  seen in recent history.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut today, I can stand here  and I can talk to you about beating Ebola
p15
aVbecause of people  whom you've never heard of,
p16
aVpeople like Peter Clement, a Liberian  doctor who's working in Lofa County,
p17
aVa place that many of you have  never heard of, probably, in Liberia.
p18
aVThe reason that Lofa County  is so important
p19
aVis because about five months ago,
p20
aVwhen the epidemic was  just starting to escalate,
p21
aVLofa County was right at the center,  the epicenter of this epidemic.
p22
aVAt that time, MSF and the treatment center there,
p23
aVthey were seeing dozens of patients  every single day,
p24
aVand these patients, these communities were becoming more and more terrified
p25
aVas time went by, with this disease  and what it was doing to their families,
p26
aVto their communities,  to their children, to their relatives.
p27
aVAnd so Peter Clement was charged with  driving that 12-hour-long rough road
p28
aVfrom Monrovia, the capital, up to Lofa County,
p29
aVto try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you.
p32
aVSo he sat down with the local chiefs,  and he listened.
p33
aVAnd what he heard was heartbreaking.
p34
aVHe heard about the devastation  and the desperation
p35
aVof people affected by this disease.
p36
aVHe heard the heartbreaking stories
p37
aVabout not just the damage that Ebola did to people,
p38
aVbut what it did to families  and what it did to communities.
p39
aVAnd he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him \u2014
p40
aVThey said, "When our children are sick,  when our children are dying,
p41
aVwe can't hold them at a time when  we want to be closest to them.
p42
aVWhen our relatives die, we can't take care of them as our tradition demands.
p43
aVWe are not allowed to wash  the bodies to bury them
p44
aVthe way our communities and  our rituals demand.
p45
aVAnd for this reason, they were deeply disturbed, deeply alarmed
p46
aVand the entire epidemic  was unraveling in front of them.
p47
aa(lp48
VPeople were turning on the healthcare  workers who had come,
p49
aVthe heroes who had come to try  and help save the community,
p50
aVto help work with the community, and they were unable to access them.
p51
aVAnd what happened then was  Peter explained to the leaders.
p52
aVThe leaders listened.  They turned the tables.
p53
aVAnd Peter explained what Ebola was. He explained what the disease was.
p54
aVHe explained what it did to their communities.
p55
aVAnd he explained that Ebola threatened  everything that made us human.
p56
aVEbola means you can't hold your children the way you would in this situation.
p57
aVYou can't bury your dead  the way that you would.
p58
aVYou have to trust these people  in these space suits to do that for you.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd ladies and gentlemen, what  happened then was rather extraordinary:
p61
aVThe community and the health workers,  Peter, they sat down together
p62
aVand they put together a new plan  for controlling Ebola in Lofa County.
p63
aVAnd the reason that this is such  an important story, ladies and gentlemen,
p64
aVis because today, this county, which is  right at the center of this epidemic
p65
aVyou've been watching,  you've been seeing in the newspapers,
p66
aVyou've been seeing on  the television screens,
p67
aVtoday Lofa County is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of Ebola.
p68
aV(Applause)
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, this doesn't mean that  the job is done, obviously.
p71
aVThere's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there.
p72
aVBut what it does teach us  is that Ebola can be beaten.
p73
aVThat's the key thing.
p74
aVEven on this scale,
p75
aVeven with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here,
p76
aVwe now know Ebola can be beaten.
p77
aVWhen communities come together  with health care workers, work together,
p78
aVthat's when this disease can be stopped.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut how did Ebola end up in Lofa County in the first place?
p81
aVWell, for that, we have to go back  12 months, to the start of this epidemic.
p82
aVAnd as many of you know,  this virus went undetected,
p83
aVit evaded detection for three  or four months when it began.
p84
aVThat's because this is not  a disease of West Africa,
p85
aVit's a disease of Central Africa,  half a continent away.
p86
aVPeople hadn't seen the disease before;
p87
aVhealth workers hadn't seen  the disease before.
p88
aVThey didn't know what  they were dealing with,
p89
aVand to make it  even more complicated,
p90
aVthe virus itself was causing a symptom, a type of a presentation
p91
aVthat wasn't classical of the disease.
p92
aVSo people didn't even recognize  the disease, people who knew Ebola.
p93
aVFor that reason it evaded detection  for some time,
p94
aa(lp95
VBut contrary to public belief  sometimes these days,
p96
aVonce the virus was detected,  there was a rapid surge in of support.
p97
aVMSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment  center, as many of you know, in the area.
p98
aVThe World Health Organization and the partners that it works with
p99
aVdeployed eventually hundreds of people  over the next two months
p100
aVto be able to help track the virus.
p101
aVThe problem, ladies and gentlemen, is by then, this virus,
p102
aVwell known now as Ebola,  had spread too far.
p103
aVIt had already outstripped what was  one of the largest responses
p104
aVthat had been mounted so far to an Ebola outbreak.
p105
aa(lp106
VBy the middle of the year, not just Guinea
p107
aVbut now Sierra Leone and Liberia were also infected.
p108
aVAs the virus was spreading geographically, the numbers were increasing
p109
aVand at this time, not only were  hundreds of people infected
p110
aVand dying of the disease,
p111
aVbut as importantly, the front line responders,
p112
aVthe people who had gone to try and help,
p113
aVthe health care workers, the other  responders
p114
aVwere also sick and dying by the dozens.
p115
aVThe presidents of these countries  recognized the emergencies.
p116
aVThey met right around that time,  they agreed on common action
p117
aVand they put together an emergency  joint operation center in Conakry
p118
aVto try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped,
p119
aVto implement the strategies we talked about.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut what happened then was something  we had never seen before with Ebola.
p122
aVWhat happened then was the virus,  or someone sick with the virus,
p123
aVboarded an airplane,  flew to another country,
p124
aVand for the first time, we saw in another distant country
p125
aVthe virus pop up again.
p126
aVThis time it was in Nigeria, in the teeming metropolis of Lagos,
p127
aV21 million people.
p128
aVNow the virus was in that environment.
p129
aVAnd as you can anticipate,  there was international alarm,
p130
aVinternational concern on a scale that  we hadn't seen in recent years
p131
aVcaused by a disease like this.
p132
aVThe World Health Organization immediately  called together an expert panel,
p133
aVlooked at the situation,  declared an international emergency.
p134
aVAnd in doing so, the expectation would be that there would be a huge outpouring
p135
aVof international assistance to help these countries
p136
aVwhich were in so much trouble and concern at that time.
p137
aa(lp138
VBut what we saw was  something very different.
p139
aVThere was some great response.
p140
aVA number of countries came to assist \u2014 many, many NGOs and others, as you know,
p141
aVbut at the same time, the opposite  happened in many places.
p142
aVAlarm escalated, and very soon  these countries found themselves
p143
aVnot receiving the support they needed, but increasingly isolated.
p144
aVWhat we saw was commercial airlines [stopped] flying into these countries
p145
aVand people who hadn't even been exposed to the virus
p146
aVwere no longer allowed to travel.
p147
aVThis caused not only problems, obviously,  for the countries themselves,
p148
aVbut also for the response.
p149
aVThose organizations that were  trying to bring people in,
p150
aVto try and help them respond to the outbreak,
p151
aVthey could not get  people on airplanes,
p152
aVthey could not get them into the  countries to be able to respond.
p153
aVIn that situation, ladies and gentleman,
p154
aVa virus like Ebola takes advantage.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd what we saw then was something  also we hadn't seen before.
p157
aVNot only did this virus  continue in the places
p158
aVwhere they'd already become infected, but then it started to escalate
p159
aVand we saw the case numbers that you see here,
p160
aVsomething we'd never seen before on such a scale,
p161
aVan exponential increase of Ebola cases
p162
aVnot just in these countries or the areas  already infected in these countries
p163
aVbut also spreading further and  deeper into these countries.
p164
aVLadies and gentleman, this was one of the most concerning
p165
aVinternational emergencies in public health we've ever seen.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd what happened in these countries then,
p168
aVmany of you saw, again, on the television, read about in the newspapers,
p169
aVwe saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic.
p170
aVWe saw the schools begin to close,  markets no longer started,
p171
aVno longer functioned the way  that they should in these countries.
p172
aVWe saw that misinformation and  misperceptions started to spread
p173
aVeven faster through the communities, which became even more alarmed
p174
aVabout the situation.
p175
aVThey started to recoil from those people  that you saw in those space suits,
p176
aVas they call them,  who had come to help them.
p177
aVAnd then the situation deteriorated even further.
p178
aVThe countries had to declare a state of emergency.
p179
aVLarge populations needed to be quarantined in some areas, and then riots broke out.
p180
aVIt was a very, very terrifying situation.
p181
aa(lp182
VAround the world, many people began to ask,
p183
aVcan we ever stop Ebola  when it starts to spread like this?
p184
aVAnd they started to ask, how well  do we really know this virus?
p185
aVThe reality is we don't know  Ebola extremely well.
p186
aVIt's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it.
p187
aVWe've known the disease only for 40 years,
p188
aVsince it first popped up in Central Africa in 1976.
p189
aVBut despite that, we do know many things:
p190
aVWe know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat.
p191
aVWe know that it probably enters  a human population
p192
aVwhen we come in contact with a wild animal
p193
aVthat has been infected with the virus  and probably sickened by it.
p194
aVThen we know that the virus spreads from person to person
p195
aVthrough contaminated body fluids.
p196
aVAnd as you've all seen,
p197
aVwe know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans,
p198
aVwhere we see this disease cause severe fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,
p199
aVand then unfortunately, in 70 percent of the cases or often more, death.
p200
aVThis is a very dangerous, debilitating, and deadly disease.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut despite the fact that we've not known this disease for a particularly long time,
p203
aVand we don't know everything about it, we do know how to stop this disease.
p204
aVThere are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola.
p205
aVFirst and foremost, the communities  have got to understand this disease,
p206
aVthey've got to understand  how it spreads and how to stop it.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd then we've got to be able to have  systems that can find every single case,
p209
aVevery contact of those cases,
p210
aVand begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission.
p211
aVWe have to have treatment centers, specialized Ebola treatment centers,
p212
aVwhere the workers can be protected
p213
aVas they try to provide support to the people who are infected,
p214
aVso that they might survive the disease.
p215
aVAnd then for those who do die,
p216
aVwe have to ensure there is a safe, but at the same time dignified, burial process,
p217
aVso that there is no spread  at that time as well.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo we do know how to stop Ebola, and these strategies work, ladies and gentlemen.
p220
aVThe virus was stopped in Nigeria  by these four strategies
p221
aVand the people implementing  them, obviously.
p222
aVIt was stopped in Senegal, where it had spread, and also in the other countries
p223
aVthat were affected by this virus,  in this outbreak.
p224
aVSo there's no question that  these strategies actually work.
p225
aVThe big question, ladies and gentlemen, was whether these strategies could work
p226
aVon this scale, in this situation, with so many countries affected
p227
aVwith the kind of exponential  growth that you saw.
p228
aa(lp229
VThat was the big question that we were  facing just two or three months ago.
p230
aVToday we know the answer to that question.
p231
aVAnd we know that answer  because of the extraordinary work
p232
aVof an incredible group of NGOs, of governments, of local leaders,
p233
aVof U.N. agencies and many humanitarian  and other organizations
p234
aVthat came and joined the fight to try and stop Ebola in West Africa.
p235
aa(lp236
VBut what had to be done there  was slightly different.
p237
aVThese countries took those strategies  I just showed you;
p238
aVthe community engagement, the case finding, contact tracing, etc.,
p239
aVand they turned them on their head.
p240
aVThere was so much disease, they approached it differently.
p241
aVWhat they decided to do was they would  first try and slow down this epidemic
p242
aVby rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers
p243
aVso that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected.
p244
aVThey would rapidly build out many, many burial teams
p245
aVso that they could safely deal with the dead,
p246
aVand with that, they would try  and slow this outbreak
p247
aVto see if it could actually then  be controlled using the classic approach
p248
aVof case finding and contact tracing.
p249
aVAnd when I went to West Africa about three months ago,
p250
aVwhen I was there what I saw was extraordinary.
p251
aVI saw presidents opening emergency operation centers themselves against Ebola
p252
aVso that they could personally coordinate  and oversee and champion
p253
aVthis surge of international support  to try and stop this disease.
p254
aVWe saw militaries from within  those countries and from far beyond
p255
aVcoming in to help build  Ebola treatment centers
p256
aVthat could be used to isolate  those who were sick.
p257
aVWe saw the Red Cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there
p258
aVto help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead
p259
aVin a dignified manner themselves.
p260
aVAnd we saw the U.N. agencies,  the World Food Program,
p261
aVbuild a tremendous air bridge
p262
aVthat could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly
p263
aVto be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about.
p264
aa(lp265
VWhat we saw, ladies and gentlemen,  which was probably most impressive,
p266
aVwas this incredible work by the governments,
p267
aVby the leaders in these countries, with the communities,
p268
aVto try to ensure people  understood this disease,
p269
aVunderstood the extraordinary things they  would have to do to try and stop Ebola.
p270
aVAnd as a result, ladies and gentlemen,
p271
aVwe saw something that we did not know only two or three months earlier,
p272
aVwhether or not it would be possible.
p273
aVWhat we saw was  what you see now in this graph,
p274
aVwhen we took stock on December 1.
p275
aVWhat we saw was we could  bend that curve, so to speak,
p276
aVchange this exponential growth,
p277
aVand bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak.
p278
aVAnd for this reason, ladies and gentlemen, there's absolutely no question now
p279
aVthat we can catch up with this outbreak  in West Africa and we can beat Ebola.
p280
aa(lp281
VThe big question, though,  that many people are asking,
p282
aVeven when they saw this curve, they said,
p283
aV"Well, hang on a minute \u2014 that's great you can slow it down,
p284
aVbut can you actually drive it down to zero?"
p285
aVWe already answered that question  back at the beginning of this talk,
p286
aVwhen I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia.
p287
aVWe told you the story how Lofa County got to a situation
p288
aVwhere they have not seen Ebola for eight weeks.
p289
aVBut there are similar stories from  the other countries as well.
p290
aVFrom Gueckedou in Guinea,
p291
aVthe first area where the first case was actually diagnosed.
p292
aa(lp293
VWe've seen very, very few cases in the last couple of months,
p294
aVand here in Kenema, in Sierra Leone,  another area in the epicenter,
p295
aVwe have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks \u2014
p296
aVway too early to declare  victory, obviously,
p297
aVbut evidence, ladies and gentlemen,
p298
aVnot only can the response  catch up to the disease,
p299
aVbut this disease can be driven to zero.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe challenge now, of course,  is doing this on the scale needed
p302
aVright across these three countries, and that is a huge challenge.
p303
aVBecause when you've been at something for this long, on this scale,
p304
aVtwo other big threats  come in to join the virus.
p305
aVThe first of those is complacency,
p306
aVthe risk that as this  disease curve starts to bend,
p307
aVthe media look elsewhere,  the world looks elsewhere.
p308
aVComplacency always a risk.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd the other risk, of course, is when you've been working so hard for so long,
p311
aVand slept so few hours  over the past months,
p312
aVpeople are tired, people become fatigued,
p313
aVand these new risks  start to creep into the response.
p314
aVLadies and gentlemen, I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa.
p315
aVThe people of these countries, the leaders of these countries,
p316
aVthey are not complacent.
p317
aVThey want to drive Ebola to zero  in their countries.
p318
aVAnd these people, yes, they're tired,  but they are not fatigued.
p319
aVThey have an energy, they have a courage,
p320
aVthey have the strength  to get this finished.
p321
aa(lp322
VWhat they need, ladies and gentlemen, at this point,
p323
aVis the unwavering support of the  international community,
p324
aVto stand with them,
p325
aVto bolster and bring even more support  at this time, to get the job finished.
p326
aVBecause finishing Ebola right now  means turning the tables on this virus,
p327
aVand beginning to hunt it.
p328
aa(lp329
VRemember, this virus, this whole crisis,  rather, started with one case,
p330
aVand is going to finish with one case.
p331
aVBut it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists,
p332
aVenough health workers, enough logisticians and enough other people working with them
p333
aVto be able to find every one  of those cases, track their contacts
p334
aVand make sure that this disease  stops once and for all.
p335
aa(lp336
VLadies and gentleman, Ebola can be beaten.
p337
aVNow we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen
p338
aVand educate them  on what it means to beat Ebola,
p339
aVand more importantly, we need you to advocate with the people
p340
aVwho can help us bring the resources we need to these countries,
p341
aVto beat this disease.
p342
aVThere are a lot of people out there  who will survive and will thrive,
p343
aVin part because of what you do  to help us beat Ebola.
p344
aa(lp345
VThank you.

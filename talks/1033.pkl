VWe are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment
p5
aVwhere the power dynamics between men and women
p6
aVare shifting very rapidly,
p7
aVand in many of the places where it counts the most,
p8
aVwomen are, in fact, taking control of everything.
p9
aVIn my mother's day, she didn't go to college.
p10
aVNot a lot of women did.
p11
aVAnd now, for every two men who get a college degree,
p12
aVthree women will do the same.
p13
aVWomen, for the first time this year,
p14
aVbecame the majority of the American workforce.
p15
aVAnd they're starting to dominate lots of professions \u2014
p16
aVdoctors, lawyers,
p17
aVbankers, accountants.
p18
aVOver 50 percent of managers are women these days,
p19
aVand in the 15 professions
p20
aVprojected to grow the most in the next decade,
p21
aVall but two of them are dominated by women.
p22
aVSo the global economy is becoming a place
p23
aVwhere women are more successful than men,
p24
aVbelieve it or not,
p25
aVand these economic changes
p26
aVare starting to rapidly affect our culture \u2014
p27
aVwhat our romantic comedies look like,
p28
aVwhat our marriages look like,
p29
aVwhat our dating lives look like,
p30
aVand our new set of superheroes.
p31
aa(lp32
VFor a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated \u2014
p33
aVtough, rugged,
p34
aVin control of his own environment.
p35
aVA few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired
p36
aVand replaced by this
p37
aVmuch less impressive specimen,
p38
aVwho is a parody of American manhood,
p39
aVand that's what we have in our commercials today.
p40
aVThe phrase "first-born son"
p41
aVis so deeply ingrained in our consciousness
p42
aVthat this statistic alone shocked me.
p43
aVIn American fertility clinics,
p44
aV75 percent of couples
p45
aVare requesting girls and not boys.
p46
aVAnd in places where you wouldn't think,
p47
aVsuch as South Korea, India and China,
p48
aVthe very strict patriarchal societies
p49
aVare starting to break down a little,
p50
aVand families are no longer
p51
aVstrongly preferring first-born sons.
p52
aa(lp53
VIf you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility
p54
aVand start to connect the dots,
p55
aVyou can see the evidence everywhere.
p56
aVYou can see it in college graduation patterns,
p57
aVin job projections,
p58
aVin our marriage statistics,
p59
aVyou can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,
p60
aVand you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,
p61
aVthat something amazing and unprecedented
p62
aVis happening with women.
p63
aVCertainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.
p64
aVThe '20s and the '60s also come to mind.
p65
aVBut the difference is that, back then,
p66
aVit was driven by a very passionate feminist movement
p67
aVthat was trying to project its own desires,
p68
aVwhereas this time, it's not about passion,
p69
aVand it's not about any kind of movement.
p70
aVThis is really just about the facts
p71
aVof this economic moment that we live in.
p72
aVThe 200,000-year period
p73
aVin which men have been top dog
p74
aVis truly coming to an end, believe it or not,
p75
aVand that's why I talk about the "end of men."
p76
aa(lp77
VNow all you men out there,
p78
aVthis is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,
p79
aVbecause the point is that this
p80
aVis happening to all of us.
p81
aVI myself have a husband and a father
p82
aVand two sons whom I dearly love.
p83
aVAnd this is why I like to talk about this,
p84
aVbecause if we don't acknowledge it,
p85
aVthen the transition will be pretty painful.
p86
aVBut if we do take account of it,
p87
aVthen I think it will go much more smoothly.
p88
aVI first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.
p89
aVI was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,
p90
aVand I started to notice a distinct pattern \u2014
p91
aVthat the recession was affecting men
p92
aVmuch more deeply than it was affecting women.
p93
aVAnd I remembered back to about 10 years ago
p94
aVwhen I read a book by Susan Faludi
p95
aVcalled "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,"
p96
aVin which she described how hard the recession had hit men,
p97
aVand I started to think about
p98
aVwhether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.
p99
aVAnd I realized that two things were different this time around.
p100
aVThe first was that
p101
aVthese were no longer just temporary hits
p102
aVthat the recession was giving men \u2014
p103
aVthat this was reflecting a deeper
p104
aVunderlying shift in our global economy.
p105
aVAnd second, that the story was no longer
p106
aVjust about the crisis of men,
p107
aVbut it was also about what was happening to women.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd now look at this second set of slides.
p110
aVThese are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.
p111
aVThese are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.
p112
aVWomen, a majority of the workplace.
p113
aVAnd labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.
p114
aVThis second set of headlines \u2014
p115
aVyou can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.
p116
aVAnd look at that last headline \u2014
p117
aVyoung women earning more than young men.
p118
aVThat particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.
p119
aVThey were basically asked by one of their clients
p120
aVwho was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.
p121
aVAnd they expected that it would be young families,
p122
aVor young men, just like it had always been.
p123
aVBut in fact, they found something very surprising.
p124
aVIt was young, single women
p125
aVwho were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.
p126
aVAnd so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,
p127
aVto do a nationwide survey.
p128
aVSo they spread out all the census data,
p129
aVand what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,
p130
aVwhich is that in 1,997
p131
aVout of 2,000 communities,
p132
aVwomen, young women,
p133
aVwere making more money than young men.
p134
aVSo here you have a generation of young women
p135
aVwho grow up thinking of themselves
p136
aVas being more powerful earners
p137
aVthan the young men around them.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, I've just laid out the picture for you,
p140
aVbut I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.
p141
aVAnd in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,
p142
aVand what you'll see on this graph \u2014
p143
aVit begins in 1973,
p144
aVjust before women start flooding the workforce,
p145
aVand it brings us up to our current day.
p146
aVAnd basically what you'll see
p147
aVis what economists talk about
p148
aVas the polarization of the economy.
p149
aVNow what does that mean?
p150
aVIt means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs
p151
aVand low-skill, low-wage jobs \u2014
p152
aVand that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,
p153
aVand the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.
p154
aVThis has been going on for 40 years now.
p155
aVBut this process is affecting men
p156
aVvery differently than it's affecting women.
p157
aVYou'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.
p158
aVYou'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,
p159
aVbut see what happens to women and see what happens to men.
p160
aVThere we go.
p161
aVSo watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.
p162
aVWatch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.
p163
aVThe men sort of stagnate there,
p164
aVwhile the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.
p165
aVSo what's that about?
p166
aVIt looks like women got some power boost on a video game,
p167
aVor like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills
p168
aVthat lets them shoot up high.
p169
aVBut of course, it's not about that.
p170
aa(lp171
VWhat it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.
p172
aVWe used to have a manufacturing economy,
p173
aVwhich was about building goods and products,
p174
aVand now we have a service economy
p175
aVand an information and creative economy.
p176
aVThose two economies require very different skills,
p177
aVand as it happens, women have been much better
p178
aVat acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.
p179
aVIt used to be that you were
p180
aVa guy who went to high school
p181
aVwho didn't have a college degree,
p182
aVbut you had a specific set of skills,
p183
aVand with the help of a union,
p184
aVyou could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.
p185
aVBut that really isn't true anymore.
p186
aVThis new economy is pretty indifferent
p187
aVto size and strength,
p188
aVwhich is what's helped men along all these years.
p189
aVWhat the economy requires now
p190
aVis a whole different set of skills.
p191
aVYou basically need intelligence,
p192
aVyou need an ability to sit still and focus,
p193
aVto communicate openly,
p194
aVto be able to listen to people
p195
aVand to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,
p196
aVand those are things that women do extremely well,
p197
aVas we're seeing.
p198
aa(lp199
VIf you look at management theory these days,
p200
aVit used to be that our ideal leader
p201
aVsounded something like General Patton, right?
p202
aVYou would be issuing orders from above.
p203
aVYou would be very hierarchical.
p204
aVYou would tell everyone below you what to do.
p205
aVBut that's not what an ideal leader is like now.
p206
aVIf you read management books now,
p207
aVa leader is somebody who can foster creativity,
p208
aVwho can get his \u2014 get the employees \u2014 see, I still say "his" \u2014
p209
aVwho can get the employees to talk to each other,
p210
aVwho can basically build teams and get them to be creative.
p211
aVAnd those are all things that women do very well.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.
p214
aVWomen enter the workplace at the top,
p215
aVand then at the working class,
p216
aVall the new jobs that are created
p217
aVare the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.
p218
aVSo that's childcare,
p219
aVelder care and food preparation.
p220
aVSo those are all the jobs that are growing,
p221
aVand those are jobs that women tend to do.
p222
aVNow one day it might be
p223
aVthat mothers will hire an out-of-work,
p224
aVmiddle-aged, former steelworker guy
p225
aVto watch their children at home,
p226
aVand that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.
p227
aa(lp228
VTo see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,
p229
aVyou have to look at our future workforce.
p230
aVAnd here the story is fairly simple.
p231
aVWomen are getting college degrees
p232
aVat a faster rate than men.
p233
aVWhy? This is a real mystery.
p234
aVPeople have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,
p235
aVto community college, say, and retool themselves,
p236
aVlearn a new set of skills?
p237
aVWell it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.
p238
aVThey're used to thinking of themselves as providers,
p239
aVand they can't seem to build the social networks
p240
aVthat allow them to get through college.
p241
aVSo for some reason
p242
aVmen just don't end up going back to college.
p243
aVAnd what's even more disturbing
p244
aVis what's happening with younger boys.
p245
aVThere's been about a decade of research
p246
aVabout what people are calling the "boy crisis."
p247
aVNow the boy crisis is this idea
p248
aVthat very young boys, for whatever reason,
p249
aVare doing worse in school than very young girls,
p250
aVand people have theories about that.
p251
aVIs it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,
p252
aVand little girls are better at that than little boys?
p253
aVOr that we require kids to sit still too much,
p254
aVand so boys initially feel like failures?
p255
aVAnd some people say it's because,
p256
aVin 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.
p257
aVBecause I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,
p258
aVso I don't have the answer.
p259
aVBut in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,
p260
aVwho's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,
p261
aVto talk to you about
p262
aVwhy the boys in her class do worse.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.
p265
aVI mean they have much larger vocabulary.
p266
aVThey learn much faster.
p267
aVThey are more controlled.
p268
aVOn the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.
p269
aa(lp270
VHanna Rosin: And why is that?
p271
aa(lp272
VNoa: Why? They were just not listening to the class
p273
aVwhile the girls sat there very nicely.
p274
aa(lp275
VHR: So there you go.
p276
aVThis whole thesis really came home to me
p277
aVwhen I went to visit a college in Kansas City \u2014
p278
aVworking-class college.
p279
aVCertainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life \u2014
p280
aVthat my husband and I would both work,
p281
aVand that we would equally raise the children.
p282
aVBut these college girls
p283
aVhad a completely different view of their future.
p284
aVBasically, the way they said it to me is
p285
aVthat they would be working 18 hours a day,
p286
aVthat their husband would maybe have a job,
p287
aVbut that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.
p288
aVAnd this was kind of a shocker to me.
p289
aVAnd then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:
p290
aV"Men are the new ball and chain."
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VNow you laugh,
p295
aVbut that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?
p296
aVAnd I think the reason it has a sting
p297
aVis because thousands of years of history
p298
aVdon't reverse themselves
p299
aVwithout a lot of pain,
p300
aVand that's why I talk about
p301
aVus all going through this together.
p302
aVThe night after I talked to these college girls,
p303
aVI also went to a men's group in Kansas,
p304
aVand these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy
p305
aVwhich I spoke to you about earlier.
p306
aVThey were men who had been contractors,
p307
aVor they had been building houses
p308
aVand they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,
p309
aVand they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.
p310
aVAnd the instructor was up there in the class
p311
aVexplaining to them all the ways
p312
aVin which they had lost their identity in this new age.
p313
aVHe was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,
p314
aVthat nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,
p315
aVand they were not really the providers.
p316
aVSo who were they?
p317
aVAnd this was very disheartening for them.
p318
aVAnd what he did was he wrote down on the board
p319
aV"$85,000,"
p320
aVand he said, "That's her salary,"
p321
aVand then he wrote down "$12,000."
p322
aV"That's your salary.
p323
aVSo who's the man now?" he asked them.
p324
aV"Who's the damn man?
p325
aVShe's the man now."
p326
aVAnd that really sent a shudder through the room.
p327
aVAnd that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,
p328
aVbecause I think it can be pretty painful,
p329
aVand we really have to work through it.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd the other reason it's kind of urgent
p332
aVis because it's not just happening in the U.S.
p333
aVIt's happening all over the world.
p334
aVIn India, poor women are learning English
p335
aVfaster than their male counterparts
p336
aVin order to staff the new call centers
p337
aVthat are growing in India.
p338
aVIn China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship
p339
aVis happening because women are starting businesses,
p340
aVsmall businesses, faster than men.
p341
aVAnd here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.
p342
aVOver several decades,
p343
aVSouth Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.
p344
aVThey basically enshrined the second-class status of women
p345
aVin the civil code.
p346
aVAnd if women failed to birth male children,
p347
aVthey were basically treated like domestic servants.
p348
aVAnd sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child
p349
aVso they could have a male child.
p350
aVBut over the '70s and '80s,
p351
aVthe South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,
p352
aVand so what they did was,
p353
aVthey started to push women into the workforce.
p354
aVNow they've been asking a question since 1985:
p355
aV"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?"
p356
aVAnd now look at the chart.
p357
aVThat's from 1985 to 2003.
p358
aVHow much do you prefer a first-born son?
p359
aa(lp360
VSo you can see that these economic changes
p361
aVreally do have a strong effect on our culture.
p362
aVNow because we haven't fully processed this information,
p363
aVit's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture
p364
aVin these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,
p365
aVwhere you can see that the stereotypes are changing.
p366
aVAnd so we have on the male side
p367
aVwhat one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up,
p368
aVwho are the males who are romantically challenged losers
p369
aVwho can't find a job.
p370
aVAnd they come up in lots of different forms.
p371
aVSo we have the perpetual adolescent.
p372
aVWe have the charmless misanthrope.
p373
aVThen we have our Bud Light guy
p374
aVwho's the happy couch potato.
p375
aVAnd then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,
p376
aVthe sexiest man alive
p377
aVgets romantically played these days in a movie.
p378
aVAnd then on the female side, you have the opposite,
p379
aVin which you have these crazy superhero women.
p380
aVYou've got Lady Gaga.
p381
aVYou've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.
p382
aVAnd it's not just for the young, right?
p383
aVEven Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.
p384
aVAnd so it feels like we have to move from this place
p385
aVwhere we've got these uber-exaggerated images
p386
aVinto something that feels a little more normal.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo for a long time in the economic sphere,
p389
aVwe've lived with the term "glass ceiling."
p390
aVNow I've never really liked this term.
p391
aVFor one thing, it puts men and women
p392
aVin a really antagonistic relationship with one another,
p393
aVbecause the men are these devious tricksters up there
p394
aVwho've put up this glass ceiling.
p395
aVAnd we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.
p396
aVAnd we have a lot of skill and experience,
p397
aVbut it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare
p398
aVto get through that glass ceiling?
p399
aVAnd also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase.
p400
aVWhat crazy person
p401
aVwould pop their head through a glass ceiling?
p402
aa(lp403
VSo the image that I like to think of,
p404
aVinstead of glass ceiling,
p405
aVis the high bridge.
p406
aVIt's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,
p407
aVbut it's also pretty exhilarating,
p408
aVbecause it's beautiful up there,
p409
aVand you're looking out on a beautiful view.
p410
aVAnd the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.
p411
aVThere's no man or woman standing in the middle
p412
aVabout to cut the cables.
p413
aVThere's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.
p414
aVAnd the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.
p415
aVYou can bring your husband along.
p416
aVYou can bring your friends, or your colleagues,
p417
aVor your babysitter to walk along with you.
p418
aVAnd husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready.
p419
aVBut the point about the high bridge
p420
aVis that you have to have the confidence
p421
aVto know that you deserve to be on that bridge,
p422
aVthat you have all the skills and experience you need
p423
aVin order to walk across the high bridge,
p424
aVbut you just have to make the decision
p425
aVto take the first step and do it.
p426
aa(lp427
VThanks very much.

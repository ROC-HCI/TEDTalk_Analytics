VWe can cut violent deaths around the world
p5
aVby 50 percent in the next three decades.
p6
aVAll we have to do is drop killing by 2.3 percent a year,
p7
aVand we'll hit that target.
p8
aa(lp9
VYou don't believe me?
p10
aVWell, the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world
p11
aVseem to think we can, and so do I,
p12
aVbut only if we focus on our cities, especially the most fragile ones.
p13
aa(lp14
VYou see, I've been thinking about this a lot.
p15
aVFor the last 20 years, I've been working
p16
aVin countries and cities ripped apart by conflict,
p17
aVviolence, terrorism, or some insidious combination of all.
p18
aVI've tracked gun smugglers from Russia to Somalia,
p19
aVI've worked with warlords in Afghanistan and the Congo,
p20
aVI've counted cadavers in Colombia, in  Haiti, in Sri Lanka, in Papua New Guinea.
p21
aVYou don't need to be on the front line, though,
p22
aVto get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control, right?
p23
aVThere's this feeling that international instability is the new normal.
p24
aVBut I want you to take a closer look,
p25
aVand I think you'll see that the geography of violence is changing,
p26
aVbecause it's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime
p27
aVas our cities: Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas,  Erbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador.
p28
aVViolence is migrating to the metropole.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd maybe this is to be expected, right?
p31
aVAfter all, most people today, they live in cities, not the countryside.
p32
aVJust 600 cities, including 30 megacities, account for two thirds of global GDP.
p33
aVBut when it comes to cities,
p34
aVthe conversation is dominated by the North,
p35
aVthat is, North America, Western Europe, Australia and Japan,
p36
aVwhere violence is  actually at historic lows.
p37
aVAs a result, city enthusiasts, they talk about the triumph of the city,
p38
aVof the creative classes, and the mayors that will rule the world.
p39
aVNow, I hope that mayors do one day rule the world,
p40
aVbut, you know, the fact is,
p41
aVwe don't hear any conversation, really, about what is happening in the South.
p42
aVAnd by South, I mean Latin America, Africa, Asia,
p43
aVwhere violence in some cases is accelerating,
p44
aVwhere infrastructure is overstretched,
p45
aVand where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, some diplomats and development experts and specialists,
p48
aVthey talk about 40 to 50 fragile states
p49
aVthat will shape security in the 21st century.
p50
aVI think it's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder.
p51
aVThat's because warfare and humanitarian action
p52
aVare going to be concentrated in our cities,
p53
aVand the fight for development,
p54
aVwhether you define that as eradicating poverty,
p55
aVuniversal healthcare, beating back climate change,
p56
aVwill be won or lost in the shantytowns, slums and favelas of our cities.
p57
aVI want to talk to you about four megarisks
p58
aVthat I think will define fragility in our time,
p59
aVand if we can get to grips with these,
p60
aVI think we can do something with that lethal violence problem.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo let me start with some good news.
p63
aVFact is, we're living in the most peaceful moment in human history.
p64
aVSteven Pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict
p65
aVis actually at an all-time low.
p66
aVNow, Gaza, Syria, Sudan, Ukraine,
p67
aVas ghastly as these conflicts are, and they are horrific,
p68
aVthey represent a relatively small blip upwards
p69
aVin a 50-year-long secular decline.
p70
aVWhat's more, we're seeing a dramatic reduction in homicide.
p71
aVManuel Eisner and others have shown
p72
aVthat for centuries, we've seen this incredible drop in murder,
p73
aVespecially in the West.
p74
aVMost Northern cities today are 100 times safer than they were just 100 years ago.
p75
aa(lp76
VThese two facts \u2014 the decline in armed  conflict and the decline in murder \u2014
p77
aVare amongst the most extraordinary,
p78
aVif unheralded, accomplishments of human history,
p79
aVand we should be really excited, right?
p80
aVWell, yeah, we should.
p81
aVThere's just one problem: These two scourges are still with us.
p82
aVYou see, 525,000 people \u2014 men, women, boys and girls \u2014
p83
aVdie violently every single year.
p84
aVResearch I've been doing with Keith Krause and others
p85
aVhas shown that between 50,000 and 60,000 people are dying in war zones violently.
p86
aVThe rest, almost 500,000 people, are dying outside of conflict zones.
p87
aVIn other words, 10 times more people are dying outside of war than inside war.
p88
aVWhat's more, violence is moving south,
p89
aVto Latin America and the Caribbean,
p90
aVto parts of Central and Southern Africa,
p91
aVand to bits of the Middle East and Central Asia.
p92
aVForty of the 50 most dangerous  cities in the world
p93
aVare right here in Latin America,
p94
aV13 in Brazil,
p95
aVand the most dangerous of all, it's  San Pedro Sula, Honduras' second city,
p96
aVwith a staggering homicide rate of 187 murders per 100,000 people.
p97
aVThat's 23 times the global average.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, if violence is re-concentrating geographically,
p100
aVit's also being reconfigured to the world's new topography,
p101
aVbecause when it comes to cities, the world ain't flat,
p102
aVlike Thomas Friedman likes to say.
p103
aVIt's spiky.
p104
aVThe dominance of the city as the primary mode of urban living
p105
aVis one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history,
p106
aVand it all happened so fast.
p107
aVYou all know the figures, right?
p108
aVThere's 7.3 billion people in the world today;
p109
aVthere will be 9.6 billion by 2050.
p110
aVBut consider this one fact:
p111
aVIn the 1800s, one in 30 people lived in cities,
p112
aVtoday it's one in two,
p113
aVand tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there.
p114
aVAnd this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable.
p115
aVThe vast majority, 90 percent,
p116
aVwill be happening in the South, in cities of the South.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo urban geographers and demographers,
p119
aVthey tell us that it's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities
p120
aVthat predicts violence, no.
p121
aVTokyo, with 35 million people,
p122
aVis one of the largest, and some might say safest, urban metropolises in the world.
p123
aVNo, it's the speed of urbanization that matters.
p124
aVI call this turbo-urbanization, and it's  one of the key drivers of fragility.
p125
aa(lp126
VWhen you think about the incredible expansion of these cities,
p127
aVand you think about turbo-urbanization, think about Karachi.
p128
aVKarachi was about 500,000 people in 1947, a hustling, bustling city.
p129
aVToday, it's 21 million people,
p130
aVand apart from accounting for three quarters of Pakistan's GDP,
p131
aVit's also one of the most violent cities in South Asia.
p132
aVDhaka, Lagos, Kinshasa,
p133
aVthese cities are now 40 times larger than they were in the 1950s.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow take a look at New York.
p136
aVThe Big Apple, it took 150 years to get to eight million people.
p137
aVSão Paulo, Mexico City, took 15 to reach that same interval.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, what do these medium, large, mega-, and hypercities look like?
p140
aVWhat is their profile?
p141
aVWell, for one thing, they're young.
p142
aVWhat we're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge.
p143
aVNow, this is actually a good news story.
p144
aVIt's a function of reductions in child mortality rates.
p145
aVBut the youth bulge is something we've got to watch.
p146
aVWhat it basically means
p147
aVis the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities
p148
aVis much larger than those living  in our healthier and wealthier ones.
p149
aVIn some fragile cities,
p150
aV75 percent of the population is under the age of 30.
p151
aVThink about that: Three in four people are under 30.
p152
aVIt's like Palo Alto on steroids.
p153
aVNow, if you look at Mogadishu for example,
p154
aVin Mogadishu the mean age is 16 years old.
p155
aVDitto for Dhaka, Dili and Kabul.
p156
aVAnd Tokyo? It's 46.
p157
aVSame for most Western European cities.
p158
aVNow, it's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence.
p159
aVThat's one factor among many,
p160
aVbut youthfulness combined with unemployment, lack of education,
p161
aVand \u2014 this is the kicker \u2014  being male, is a deadly proposition.
p162
aVThey're statistically correlated, all those risk factors, with youth,
p163
aVand they tend to relate to increases in violence.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, for those of you who are parents of teenage sons,
p166
aVyou know what I'm talking about, right?
p167
aVJust imagine your boy without any structure
p168
aVwith those unruly friends of his, out there cavorting about.
p169
aVNow, take away the parents,
p170
aVtake away the education, limit the education possibilities,
p171
aVsprinkle in a little bit of drugs, alcohol and guns,
p172
aVand sit back and watch the fireworks.
p173
aVThe implications are disconcerting.
p174
aVRight here in Brazil, the life expectancy is 73.6 years.
p175
aVIf you live in Rio, I'm sorry, shave off two right there.
p176
aVBut if you're young, you're uneducated,
p177
aVyou lack employment, you're black, and you're male,
p178
aVyour life expectancy drops to less than 60 years old.
p179
aVThere's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers
p180
aVin this country.
p181
aa(lp182
VOkay, so it's not all doom and gloom in our cities.
p183
aVAfter all, cities are hubs of innovation,
p184
aVdynamism, prosperity,  excitement, connectivity.
p185
aVThey're where the smart people gather.
p186
aVAnd those young people I just mentioned,
p187
aVthey're more digitally savvy and tech-aware than ever before.
p188
aVAnd this explosion, the Internet, and mobile technology,
p189
aVmeans that the digital divide separating the North and the South
p190
aVbetween countries and within them, is shrinking.
p191
aVBut as we've heard so many times,
p192
aVthese new technologies are dual-edged, right?
p193
aVTake the case of law enforcement.
p194
aVPolice around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data
p195
aVto anticipate crime.
p196
aVSome cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens.
p197
aVThe future crime scenario, it's here today,
p198
aVand we've got to be careful.
p199
aVWe have to manage the issues of the public safety
p200
aVagainst rights to individual privacy.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut it's not just the cops who are innovating.
p203
aVWe've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups
p204
aVwho are engaging in local  and global collective action,
p205
aVand this is leading to digital protest and real revolution.
p206
aVBut most worrying of all are criminal gangs
p207
aVwho are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace.
p208
aVIn Ciudad Juárez in Mexico, where I've been working,
p209
aVgroups like the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel
p210
aVare hijacking social media.
p211
aVThey're using it to recruit, to sell their products,
p212
aVto coerce, to intimidate and to kill.
p213
aVViolence is going virtual.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo this is just a partial sketch
p216
aVof a fast-moving and dynamic and complex situation.
p217
aVI mean, there are many other megarisks
p218
aVthat are going to define fragility in our time,
p219
aVnot least income inequality,
p220
aVpoverty, climate change, impunity.
p221
aVBut we're facing a stark dilemma
p222
aVwhere some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth
p223
aVand others are going to stumble and pull it backwards.
p224
aVIf we're going to change course, we need to start a conversation.
p225
aVWe can't only focus on those cities that work,
p226
aVthe Singapores, the Kuala Lumpurs,
p227
aVthe Dubais, the Shanghais.
p228
aVWe've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation.
p229
aa(lp230
VOne way to do this might be to start twinning
p231
aVour fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones,
p232
aVkickstarting a process of learning and collaboration
p233
aVand sharing of practices, of what works and what doesn't.
p234
aVA wonderful example of this is coming from El Salvador and Los Angeles,
p235
aVwhere the mayors in San Salvador and Los Angeles are collaborating
p236
aVon getting ex-gang members to work with current gang members,
p237
aVoffering tutoring, education,
p238
aVand in the process are helping incubate cease-fires and truces,
p239
aVand we've seen homicide rates go down in San Salvador,
p240
aVonce the world's most violent city,
p241
aVby 50 percent.
p242
aVWe can also focus  on hot cities, but also hot spots.
p243
aVPlace and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities.
p244
aVDid you know that between one and two percent
p245
aVof street addresses in any fragile city
p246
aVcan predict up to 99 percent of violent crime?
p247
aVTake the case of São Paulo, where I've been working.
p248
aVIt's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest,
p249
aVand it did this by doubling down
p250
aVon information collection, hot spot mapping, and police reform,
p251
aVand in the process, it dropped homicide by 70 percent in just over 10 years.
p252
aVWe also got to focus on those hot people.
p253
aVIt's tragic, but being young, unemployed, uneducated, male,
p254
aVincreases the risks of being killed and killing.
p255
aVWe have to break this cycle of violence
p256
aVand get in there early with our children, our youngest children,
p257
aVand valorize them, not stigmatize them.
p258
aVThere's wonderful work that's happening that I've been involved with
p259
aVin Kingston, Jamaica and right here in Rio,
p260
aVwhich is putting education, employment, recreation
p261
aVup front for these high-risk groups,
p262
aVand as a result, we're seeing violence going down in their communities.
p263
aa(lp264
VWe've also got to make our cities safer, more inclusive, and livable for all.
p265
aVThe fact is, social cohesion matters.
p266
aVMobility matters in our cities.
p267
aVWe've got to get away from this model of segregation, exclusion,
p268
aVand cities with walls.
p269
aVMy favorite example of how to do this comes from Medellín.
p270
aVWhen I lived in Colombia in the late 1990s,
p271
aVMedellín was the murder capital  of the world, but it changed course,
p272
aVand it did this by deliberately investing in its low-income and most violent areas
p273
aVand integrating them with the middle-class ones
p274
aVthrough a network of cable cars,
p275
aVof public transport, and first-class infrastructure,
p276
aVand in the process, it dropped homicide by 79 percent in just under two decades.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd finally, there's technology.
p279
aVTechnology has enormous promise but also peril.
p280
aVWe've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation,
p281
aVand much of it coming from this room,
p282
aVThe police are engaging  in predictive analytics.
p283
aVCitizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions.
p284
aVEven my own group is involved in developing applications
p285
aVto provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens.
p286
aVBut we need to be careful.
p287
aa(lp288
VIf I have one single message for you, it's this:
p289
aVThere is nothing inevitable about lethal violence,
p290
aVand we can make our cities safer.
p291
aVFolks, we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence
p292
aVin half within our lifetime.
p293
aVSo I have just one question:
p294
aVWhat are we waiting for?
p295
aa(lp296
VThank you.

VFive years ago, I was a Ph.D. student
p5
aVliving two lives.
p6
aVIn one, I used NASA supercomputers
p7
aVto design next-generation spacecraft,
p8
aVand in the other I was a data scientist
p9
aVlooking for potential smugglers
p10
aVof sensitive nuclear technologies.
p11
aVAs a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses,
p12
aVmostly of facilities,
p13
aVindustrial facilities around the world.
p14
aVAnd I was always looking for a better canvas
p15
aVto tie these all together.
p16
aVAnd one day, I was thinking about how
p17
aVall data has a location,
p18
aVand I realized that the answer
p19
aVhad been staring me in the face.
p20
aVAlthough I was a satellite engineer,
p21
aVI hadn't thought about using satellite imagery
p22
aVin my work.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, like most of us, I'd been online,
p25
aVI'd see my house, so I thought,
p26
aVI'll hop in there and I'll start looking up
p27
aVsome of these facilities.
p28
aVAnd what I found really surprised me.
p29
aVThe pictures that I was finding
p30
aVwere years out of date,
p31
aVand because of that,
p32
aVit had relatively little relevance
p33
aVto the work that I was doing today.
p34
aVBut I was intrigued.
p35
aVI mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff.
p36
aVThere are millions and millions of sensors
p37
aVsurrounding us today,
p38
aVbut there's still so much we don't know on a daily basis.
p39
aVHow much oil is stored in all of China?
p40
aVHow much corn is being produced?
p41
aVHow many ships are in all of our world's ports?
p42
aVNow, in theory, all of these questions
p43
aVcould be answered by imagery,
p44
aVbut not if it's old.
p45
aVAnd if this data was so valuable,
p46
aVthen how come I couldn't get my hands
p47
aVon more recent pictures?
p48
aa(lp49
VSo the story begins over 50 years ago
p50
aVwith the launch of the first generation
p51
aVof U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites.
p52
aVAnd today, there's a handful
p53
aVof the great, great grandchildren
p54
aVof these early Cold War machines
p55
aVwhich are now operated by private companies
p56
aVand from which the vast majority of satellite imagery
p57
aVthat you and I see on a daily basis comes.
p58
aVDuring this period, launching things into space,
p59
aVjust the rocket to get the satellite up there,
p60
aVhas cost hundreds of millions of dollars each,
p61
aVand that's created tremendous pressure
p62
aVto launch things infrequently
p63
aVand to make sure that when you do,
p64
aVyou cram as much functionality in there as possible.
p65
aVAll of this has only made satellites
p66
aVbigger and bigger and bigger
p67
aVand more expensive,
p68
aVnow nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy.
p69
aVBecause they are so expensive,
p70
aVthere aren't very many of them.
p71
aVBecause there aren't very many of them,
p72
aVthe pictures that we see on a daily basis
p73
aVtend to be old.
p74
aa(lp75
VI think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally,
p76
aVbut in order to visualize just how sparsely
p77
aVour planet is collected,
p78
aVsome friends and I put together a dataset
p79
aVof the 30 million pictures that have been gathered
p80
aVby these satellites between 2000 and 2010.
p81
aVAs you can see in blue, huge areas of our world
p82
aVare barely seen, less than once a year,
p83
aVand even the areas that are seen most frequently,
p84
aVthose in red, are seen at best once a quarter.
p85
aVNow as aerospace engineering grad students,
p86
aVthis chart cried out to us as a challenge.
p87
aVWhy do these things have to be so expensive?
p88
aVDoes a single satellite really have to cost
p89
aVthe equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets?
p90
aVWasn't there a way to build a smaller,
p91
aVsimpler, new satellite design that could enable
p92
aVmore timely imaging?
p93
aa(lp94
VI realize that it does sound a little bit crazy
p95
aVthat we were going to go out and just
p96
aVbegin designing satellites,
p97
aVbut fortunately we had help.
p98
aVIn the late 1990s, a couple of professors
p99
aVproposed a concept for radically reducing the price
p100
aVof putting things in space.
p101
aVThis was hitchhiking small satellites
p102
aValongside much larger satellites.
p103
aVThis dropped the cost of putting objects up there
p104
aVby over a factor of 100,
p105
aVand suddenly we could afford to experiment,
p106
aVto take a little bit of risk,
p107
aVand to realize a lot of innovation.
p108
aVAnd a new generation of engineers and scientists,
p109
aVmostly out of universities,
p110
aVbegan launching these very small,
p111
aVbreadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats.
p112
aVAnd these were built with electronics obtained
p113
aVfrom RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow it was using the lessons learned from these early missions
p116
aVthat my friends and I began a series of sketches
p117
aVof our own satellite design.
p118
aVAnd I can't remember a specific day
p119
aVwhere we made a conscious decision
p120
aVthat we were actually going to go out and build these things,
p121
aVbut once we got that idea in our minds
p122
aVof the world as a dataset,
p123
aVof being able to capture millions of data points
p124
aVon a daily basis describing the global economy,
p125
aVof being able to unearth billions of connections
p126
aVbetween them that had never before been found,
p127
aVit just seemed boring
p128
aVto go work on anything else.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd so we moved into a cramped,
p131
aVwindowless office in Palo Alto,
p132
aVand began working to take our design
p133
aVfrom the drawing board into the lab.
p134
aVThe first major question we had to tackle
p135
aVwas just how big to build this thing.
p136
aVIn space, size drives cost,
p137
aVand we had worked with these very small,
p138
aVbreadbox-sized satellites in school,
p139
aVbut as we began to better understand the laws of physics,
p140
aVwe found that the quality of pictures
p141
aVthose satellites could take was very limited,
p142
aVbecause the laws of physics dictate
p143
aVthat the best picture you can take through a telescope
p144
aVis a function of the diameter of that telescope,
p145
aVand these satellites had a very small,
p146
aVvery constrained volume.
p147
aVAnd we found that the best picture we would
p148
aVhave been able to get looked something like this.
p149
aVAlthough this was the low-cost option,
p150
aVquite frankly it was just too blurry
p151
aVto see the things that make satellite imagery valuable.
p152
aVSo about three or four weeks later,
p153
aVwe met a group of engineers randomly
p154
aVwho had worked on the first
p155
aVprivate imaging satellite ever developed,
p156
aVand they told us that back in the 1970s,
p157
aVthe U.S. government had found a powerful
p158
aVoptimal tradeoff \u2014
p159
aVthat in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution,
p160
aVbeing able to see objects one meter in size,
p161
aVthey had found that they could not just get very high-quality images,
p162
aVbut get a lot of them at an affordable price.
p163
aVFrom our own computer simulations,
p164
aVwe quickly found that one meter really was
p165
aVthe minimum viable product
p166
aVto be able to see the drivers of our global economy,
p167
aVfor the first time, being able to count
p168
aVthe ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks
p169
aVthat move around our world on a daily basis,
p170
aVwhile conveniently still not being able to see individuals.
p171
aVWe had found our compromise.
p172
aVWe would have to build something larger
p173
aVthan the original breadbox,
p174
aVnow more like a mini-fridge,
p175
aVbut we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck.
p176
aVSo now we had our constraint.
p177
aVThe laws of physics dictated
p178
aVthe absolute minimum-sized telescope that we could build.
p179
aa(lp180
VWhat came next was making the rest of the satellite
p181
aVas small and as simple as possible,
p182
aVbasically a flying telescope with four walls
p183
aVand a set of electronics smaller than a phone book
p184
aVthat used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb.
p185
aVThe big challenge became actually taking
p186
aVthe pictures through that telescope.
p187
aVTraditional imaging satellites use a line scanner,
p188
aVsimilar to a Xerox machine,
p189
aVand as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures,
p190
aVscanning row by row by row
p191
aVto build the complete image.
p192
aVNow people use these because they get a lot of light,
p193
aVwhich means less of the noise you see
p194
aVin a low-cost cell phone image.
p195
aVThe problem with them is they require
p196
aVvery sophisticated pointing.
p197
aVYou have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target
p198
aVfrom over 600 miles away
p199
aVwhile moving at more than seven kilometers a second,
p200
aVwhich requires an awesome degree of complexity.
p201
aVSo instead, we turned to a new generation of video sensors,
p202
aVoriginally created for use in night vision goggles.
p203
aVInstead of taking a single, high quality image,
p204
aVwe could take a videostream
p205
aVof individually noisier frames,
p206
aVbut then we could recombine
p207
aVall of those frames together
p208
aVinto very high-quality images
p209
aVusing sophisticated pixel processing techniques
p210
aVhere on the ground,
p211
aVat a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system.
p212
aVAnd we applied this technique
p213
aVto many of the other systems on the satellite as well,
p214
aVand day by day, our design evolved
p215
aVfrom CAD to prototypes
p216
aVto production units.
p217
aa(lp218
VA few short weeks ago,
p219
aVwe packed up SkySat 1,
p220
aVput our signatures on it,
p221
aVand waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.
p222
aVToday, it's sitting in its final launch configuration
p223
aVready to blast off in a few short weeks.
p224
aVAnd soon, we'll turn our attention to launching
p225
aVa constellation of 24 or more of these satellites
p226
aVand beginning to build the scalable analytics
p227
aVthat will allow us to unearth the insights
p228
aVin the petabytes of data we will collect.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo why do all of this? Why build these satellites?
p231
aVWell, it turns out imaging satellites
p232
aVhave a unique ability to provide global transparency,
p233
aVand providing that transparency on a timely basis
p234
aVis simply an idea whose time has come.
p235
aVWe see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier,
p236
aVand beyond economic data,
p237
aVunlocking the human story, moment by moment.
p238
aVFor a data scientist
p239
aVthat just happened to go to space camp as a kid,
p240
aVit just doesn't get much better than that.
p241
aa(lp242
VThank you.

In 2013, SkySat-1, the first such satellite, was launched and is now beaming back images that are high-enough resolution to show the real-time state of global commerce. The idea: to &quot;revolutionize the ways that consumers, businesses, and governments make  decisions in their day-to-day lives.&quot;</p>  <p>In a previous life, Berkenstock worked in the Advanced Supercomputing Division at NASA&#39;s Ames Research Center, and also worked as a  counterproliferation analyst at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,  where he focused on trying to find and thwart potential potential smugglers of nuclear technologies.

Skybox is hoping to recoup the cost of the constellation by expanding the market for fresh satellite imagery beyond the government and the military.

VIn 2007,
p5
aVI decided that we needed to reconceptualize
p6
aVhow we thought about economic development.
p7
aVOur new goal should be
p8
aVthat when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,
p9
aVthey should be able to choose between
p10
aVat least a handful
p11
aVof different cities
p12
aVthat were all competing to attract new residents.
p13
aVNow we're a long way away from that goal right now.
p14
aVThere are billions of people in developing countries
p15
aVwho don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.
p16
aVBut the amazing thing about cities
p17
aVis they're worth so much more
p18
aVthan it costs to build them.
p19
aVSo we could easily supply the world
p20
aVwith dozens, maybe hundreds,
p21
aVof new cities.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow this might sound preposterous to you
p24
aVif you've never thought about new cities.
p25
aVBut just substitute apartment building for cities.
p26
aVImagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;
p27
aVthe other half aren't there yet.
p28
aVYou could try and expand the capacity
p29
aVby doing additions on all the existing apartments.
p30
aVBut you know what you'd run into
p31
aVis those apartments and the surrounding areas
p32
aVhave rules to avoid discomfort
p33
aVand the distractions of construction.
p34
aVSo it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.
p35
aVBut you could go out someplace brand new,
p36
aVbuild a brand new apartment building,
p37
aVas long as the rules there
p38
aVwere ones that facilitated construction
p39
aVrather than getting in the way.
p40
aVSo I proposed
p41
aVthat governments create new reform zones
p42
aVbig enough to hold cities
p43
aVand gave them a name: charter cities.
p44
aa(lp45
VLater I learned that at about this same time,
p46
aVJavier and Octavio
p47
aVwere thinking about the challenge of reform
p48
aVin Honduras.
p49
aVThey knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year
p50
aVwould leave to go to the United States,
p51
aVand they wanted to ask, what could they do
p52
aVto make sure that those people could stay
p53
aVand do the same things in Honduras.
p54
aVAt one point, Javier said to Octavio,
p55
aV"What if we took some of our empty land \u2014
p56
aVwhat if we just gave it to an embassy \u2014
p57
aVgive some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy \u2014
p58
aVand then if people want to go work
p59
aVunder the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,
p60
aVthey can go get jobs,
p61
aVdo everything they do on those embassy grounds
p62
aVthat they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?"
p63
aa(lp64
VIn the summer of 2009,
p65
aVHonduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.
p66
aVAt the next regularly scheduled election,
p67
aVPepe Lobo won in a landslide
p68
aVon a platform that promised reform,
p69
aVbut reconciliation as well.
p70
aVHe asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.
p71
aVMeanwhile, I was getting ready
p72
aVto give a talk at TEDGlobal.
p73
aVThrough a process of refinement,
p74
aVtrial and error, a lot of user testing,
p75
aVI tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city
p76
aVdown to the bare essentials.
p77
aVThe first point was the importance of rules,
p78
aVlike those rules that say
p79
aVyou can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.
p80
aVWe pay a lot of attention to new technologies,
p81
aVbut it takes technologies and rules to get progress,
p82
aVand it's usually the rules that hold us back.
p83
aa(lp84
VIn the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala
p85
aVsent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.
p86
aVHe showed it to Javier.
p87
aVThey called me.
p88
aVThey said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country."
p89
aVSo in December we met in Miami,
p90
aVin a hotel conference room.
p91
aVI tried to explain this point
p92
aVabout how valuable cities are,
p93
aVhow much more valuable they are than they cost.
p94
aVAnd I used this slide
p95
aVshowing how valuable the raw land is
p96
aVin a place like New York City:
p97
aVnotice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,
p98
aVper square meter.
p99
aVBut it was a fairly abstract discussion,
p100
aVand at some point when there was a pause,
p101
aVOctavio said,
p102
aV"Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughing)
p105
aa(lp106
VSo the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,
p107
aVa charter city is a place
p108
aVwhere you start with uninhabited land,
p109
aVa charter that specifies the rules that will apply there
p110
aVand then a chance for people to opt in,
p111
aVto go live under those rules or not.
p112
aVSo I was asked by the president of Honduras
p113
aVwho said that we need to do this project,
p114
aVthis is important,
p115
aVthis could be the way forward for our country.
p116
aVI was asked to come to Tegucigalpa
p117
aVand talk again on January fourth and fifth.
p118
aVSo I presented
p119
aVanother fact-filled lecture
p120
aVthat included a slide like this,
p121
aVwhich tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,
p122
aVit has to be very big.
p123
aVThis is a picture of Denver,
p124
aVand the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.
p125
aVThis airport alone
p126
aVcovers more than 100 square kilometers.
p127
aVSo I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,
p128
aVif you build a new city,
p129
aVyou've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.
p130
aVThat's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.
p131
aVEverybody applauded politely.
p132
aVThe faces in the audience
p133
aVwere very serious and attentive.
p134
aVThe leader of the congress came up on stage and said,
p135
aV"Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,
p136
aVbut maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.
p137
aVI've got it here on my laptop."
p138
aVSo I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd it got to the essence,
p141
aVwhich is that a new city could offer new choices for people.
p142
aVThere would be a choice of a city which you could go to
p143
aVwhich could be in Honduras,
p144
aVinstead of hundreds of miles away in the North.
p145
aVAnd it also involved new choices for leaders.
p146
aVBecause the leaders in the government there in Honduras
p147
aVwould need help from partner countries,
p148
aVwho could benefit from partner countries
p149
aVwho help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,
p150
aVso everybody can trust
p151
aVthat the charter really will be enforced.
p152
aVAnd the insight of President Lobo
p153
aVwas that that assurance of enforcement
p154
aVthat I was thinking about
p155
aVas a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city
p156
aVcould be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras
p157
aVwho had suffered for so many years
p158
aVfrom fear and distrust.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe went and looked at a site.
p161
aVThis picture's from there.
p162
aVIt easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.
p163
aVAnd shortly thereafter, on January 19th,
p164
aVthey voted in the congress to amend their constitution
p165
aVto have a constitutional provision
p166
aVthat allows for special development regions.
p167
aVIn a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,
p168
aVthe vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment
p169
aVwas 124 to one.
p170
aVAll parties, all factions in society, backed this.
p171
aVTo be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.
p172
aVOn February 17th they passed it again
p173
aVwith another vote of 114 to one.
p174
aa(lp175
VImmediately after that vote,
p176
aVon February 21st to the 24th,
p177
aVa delegation of about 30 Hondurans
p178
aVwent to the two places in the world
p179
aVthat are most interested in getting into the city building business.
p180
aVOne is South Korea.
p181
aVThis is a picture of a big, new city center
p182
aVthat's being built in South Korea \u2014
p183
aVbigger than downtown Boston.
p184
aVEverything you see there was built in four years,
p185
aVafter they spent four years getting the permits.
p186
aVThe other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.
p187
aVThey've actually built two cities already in China
p188
aVand are preparing the third.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo if you think about this practically,
p191
aVhere's where we are.
p192
aVThey've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.
p193
aVThey're putting in place a legal system
p194
aVthat could allow for managers to come in,
p195
aVand also an external legal system.
p196
aVOne country has already volunteered to let its supreme court
p197
aVbe the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.
p198
aVThere's designers and builders of cities
p199
aVwho are very interested.
p200
aVThey even can bring with them some financing.
p201
aVBut the one thing you know they've already solved
p202
aVis that there's lots of tenants.
p203
aVThere's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,
p204
aVespecially in a place with a free trade zone,
p205
aVand there's lots of people who'd like to go there.
p206
aVAround the world, there's 700 million people
p207
aVwho say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.
p208
aa(lp209
VThere's a million a year
p210
aVwho leave Latin America to go to the United States.
p211
aVMany of these are a father
p212
aVwho has to leave his family behind to go get a job \u2014
p213
aVsometimes a single mother
p214
aVwho has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.
p215
aVSadly, sometimes there are even children
p216
aVwho are trying to get reunited with their parents
p217
aVthat they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo what kind of an idea is it
p220
aVto think about building a brand new city in Honduras?
p221
aVOr to build a dozen of these,
p222
aVor a hundred of these, around the world?
p223
aVWhat kind of an idea is it
p224
aVto think about insisting
p225
aVthat every family have a choice of several cities
p226
aVthat are competing to attract new residents?
p227
aVThis is an idea worth spreading.
p228
aVAnd my friends from Honduras
p229
aVasked me to say thank you, TED.

Romer believes in the power of ideas. He first studied how to speed up the discovery and implementation of new technologies. But to address the big problems we&#39;ll face this century -- insecurity, harm to the environment, global poverty -- new technologies will not be enough. We must also speed up the discovery and implementation of new rules, of new ideas about how people interact. <br /><br />Throughout human history, big improvements in systems of rules took place when new governments entered the scene. In today&#39;s world, this process has been largely shut down. To bring it back to life, Romer proposes that we create new cities where people can go to escape from bad rules and opt in to new and better ones. With better rules, people can be safe, self-interest can protect the environment, and investment can bring families all the resources that the modern world has to offer.</p><p>Romer took office as the World Bank&#39;s Chief Economist and Senior Vice President in October&nbsp;2016.</p>", "slug": "paul_romer", "whotheyare": "Paul Romer\'s research on catch-up growth in low- and middle-income countries has emphasized the importance of government policies that encourage orderly urban expansion.", "whatotherssay": "Paul Romer has had a massive and profound impact on modern economic thinking and policymaking.  ...

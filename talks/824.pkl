VLet's pretend right here we have a machine.
p5
aVA big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,
p6
aVand it's a time machine.
p7
aVAnd everyone in this room has to get into it.
p8
aVAnd you can go backwards, you can go forwards;
p9
aVyou cannot stay where you are.
p10
aVAnd I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends
p11
aVthis question a lot lately and they all want to go back.
p12
aVI don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles
p13
aVor Twitter or "American Idol."
p14
aVI don't know.
p15
aVI'm convinced that there's some sort of pull
p16
aVto nostalgia, to wishful thinking.
p17
aVAnd I understand that.
p18
aa(lp19
VI'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.
p20
aVI don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.
p21
aVIt's because possibilities on this planet,
p22
aVthey don't go back, they go forward.
p23
aVSo I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.
p24
aVThis is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet
p25
aVby any measure that you wish to choose:
p26
aVhealth, wealth,
p27
aVmobility, opportunity,
p28
aVdeclining rates of disease ...
p29
aVThere's never been a time like this.
p30
aVMy great-grandparents died, all of them,
p31
aVby the time they were 60.
p32
aVMy grandparents pushed that number to 70.
p33
aVMy parents are closing in on 80.
p34
aVSo there better be
p35
aVa nine at the beginning of my death number.
p36
aVBut it's not even about people like us,
p37
aVbecause this is a bigger deal than that.
p38
aa(lp39
VA kid born in New Delhi today
p40
aVcan expect to live as long as
p41
aVthe richest man in the world did 100 years ago.
p42
aVThink about that, it's an incredible fact.
p43
aVAnd why is it true?
p44
aVSmallpox. Smallpox killed billions
p45
aVof people on this planet.
p46
aVIt reshaped the demography of the globe
p47
aVin a way that no war ever has.
p48
aVIt's gone. It's vanished.
p49
aVWe vanquished it. Puff.
p50
aVIn the rich world,
p51
aVdiseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago
p52
aVno longer exist, hardly.
p53
aVDiphtheria, rubella, polio ...
p54
aVdoes anyone even know what those things are?
p55
aVVaccines, modern medicine,
p56
aVour ability to feed billions of people,
p57
aVthose are triumphs of the scientific method.
p58
aVAnd to my mind, the scientific method \u2014
p59
aVtrying stuff out,
p60
aVseeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't \u2014
p61
aVis one of the great accomplishments of humanity.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo that's the good news.
p64
aVUnfortunately, that's all the good news
p65
aVbecause there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.
p66
aVAnd one of them is that
p67
aVdespite all our accomplishments,
p68
aVa billion people go to bed hungry
p69
aVin this world every day.
p70
aVThat number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.
p71
aVAnd not only that, we've used our imagination
p72
aVto thoroughly trash this globe.
p73
aVPotable water, arable land,
p74
aVrainforests, oil, gas:
p75
aVthey're going away, and they're going away soon,
p76
aVand unless we innovate our way out of this mess,
p77
aVwe're going away too.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.
p80
aVI think it's clear that we can make food
p81
aVthat will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.
p82
aVI think we can power this world with energy
p83
aVthat doesn't also destroy it.
p84
aVI really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.
p85
aVBut here's the thing that keeps me up at night \u2014
p86
aVone of the things that keeps me up at night:
p87
aVWe've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never.
p88
aVAnd we've also never been in a position
p89
aVto deploy it properly in the way that we can today.
p90
aVWe're on the verge of amazing, amazing events
p91
aVin many fields,
p92
aVand yet I actually think we'd have to go back
p93
aVhundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,
p94
aVto find a time when we battled progress,
p95
aVwhen we fought about these things
p96
aVmore vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now.
p97
aa(lp98
VPeople wrap themselves in their beliefs,
p99
aVand they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.
p100
aVNot even the truth will set them free.
p101
aVAnd, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;
p102
aVthey're even entitled to their opinion about progress.
p103
aVBut you know what you're not entitled to?
p104
aVYou're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not.
p105
aVAnd this took me awhile to figure out.
p106
aa(lp107
VAbout a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines
p108
aVfor The New Yorker. A little story.
p109
aVAnd I was amazed to find opposition:
p110
aVopposition to what is, after all,
p111
aVthe most effective public health measure in human history.
p112
aVI didn't know what to do,
p113
aVso I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.
p114
aVAnd soon after that,
p115
aVI wrote a story about genetically engineered food.
p116
aVSame thing, only bigger.
p117
aVPeople were going crazy.
p118
aVSo I wrote a story about that too,
p119
aVand I couldn't understand why
p120
aVpeople thought this was "Frankenfoods,"
p121
aVwhy they thought moving molecules around
p122
aVin a specific, rather than a haphazard way,
p123
aVwas trespassing on nature's ground.
p124
aVBut, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.
p125
aVI mean, I'm a journalist.
p126
aVWe type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VBut these stories bothered me,
p131
aVand I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.
p132
aVAnd that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy
p133
aVweren't actually fanatics at all.
p134
aVThey were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.
p135
aVThey were exactly like the people in this room.
p136
aVAnd it just disturbed me so much.
p137
aVBut then I thought, you know, let's be honest.
p138
aVWe're at a point in this world
p139
aVwhere we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.
p140
aVWe talk about it ambivalently.
p141
aVWe talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:
p142
aV"progress."
p143
aVOkay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.
p144
aVWe've lost faith in institutions,
p145
aVin authority,
p146
aVand sometimes in science itself,
p147
aVand there's no reason we shouldn't have.
p148
aVYou can just say a few names
p149
aVand people will understand.
p150
aVChernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,
p151
aVVioxx, weapons of mass destruction,
p152
aVhanging chads.
p153
aVYou know, you can choose your list.
p154
aVThere are questions and problems
p155
aVwith the people we used to believe were always right,
p156
aVso be skeptical.
p157
aVAsk questions, demand proof, demand evidence.
p158
aVDon't take anything for granted.
p159
aVBut here's the thing: When you get proof,
p160
aVyou need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.
p161
aVAnd the reason that I can say that is because
p162
aVwe're now in an epidemic of fear
p163
aVlike one I've never seen and hope never to see again.
p164
aa(lp165
VAbout 12 years ago, there was a story published,
p166
aVa horrible story,
p167
aVthat linked the epidemic of autism
p168
aVto the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.
p169
aVVery scary.
p170
aVTons of studies were done to see if this was true.
p171
aVTons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.
p172
aVThe data came back.
p173
aVThe data came back from the United States, from England,
p174
aVfrom Sweden, from Canada,
p175
aVand it was all the same: no correlation,
p176
aVno connection, none at all.
p177
aVIt doesn't matter. It doesn't matter
p178
aVbecause we believe anecdotes,
p179
aVwe believe what we see, what we think we see,
p180
aVwhat makes us feel real.
p181
aVWe don't believe a bunch of documents
p182
aVfrom a government official giving us data,
p183
aVand I do understand that, I think we all do.
p184
aVBut you know what?
p185
aVThe result of that has been disastrous.
p186
aVDisastrous because here's a fact:
p187
aVThe United States is one of the only countries in the world
p188
aVwhere the vaccine rate for measles is going down.
p189
aVThat is disgraceful,
p190
aVand we should be ashamed of ourselves.
p191
aVIt's horrible.
p192
aVWhat kind of a thing happened
p193
aVthat we could do that?
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, I understand it. I do understand it.
p196
aVBecause, did anyone have measles here?
p197
aVHas one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles?
p198
aVDoesn't happen very much.
p199
aVDoesn't happen in this country at all,
p200
aVbut it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
p201
aVThat's a lot of death of measles \u2014
p202
aV20 an hour.
p203
aVBut since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,
p204
aVand people like Jenny McCarthy
p205
aVcan go around preaching messages
p206
aVof fear and illiteracy from platforms
p207
aVlike "Oprah" and "Larry King Live."
p208
aVAnd they can do it because
p209
aVthey don't link causation and correlation.
p210
aVThey don't understand that these things seem the same,
p211
aVbut they're almost never the same.
p212
aVAnd it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.
p213
aa(lp214
VThis guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.
p215
aVHe took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.
p216
aVNo fear, no agony. Polio \u2014 puff, gone.
p217
aVThat guy in the middle, not so much.
p218
aVHis name is Paul Offit.
p219
aVHe just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.
p220
aVIt'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids
p221
aVin the developing world every year.
p222
aVPretty good, right?
p223
aVWell, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines
p224
aVand says how valuable they are
p225
aVand that people ought to just stop the whining.
p226
aVAnd he actually says it that way.
p227
aVSo, Paul's a terrorist.
p228
aVWhen Paul speaks in a public hearing,
p229
aVhe can't testify without armed guards.
p230
aVHe gets called at home
p231
aVbecause people like to tell him
p232
aVthat they remember where his kids go to school.
p233
aVAnd why? Because Paul made a vaccine.
p234
aa(lp235
VI don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.
p236
aVYou take them away, disease comes back,
p237
aVhorrible diseases. And that's happening.
p238
aVWe have measles in this country now.
p239
aVAnd it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids
p240
aVare going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.
p241
aVAnd they're not just going to die of measles.
p242
aVWhat about polio? Let's have that. Why not?
p243
aVA college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said
p244
aVshe thought I was a little strident.
p245
aVNo one's ever said that before.
p246
aVShe wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,
p247
aVno way.
p248
aVFine.
p249
aVWhy? Because we don't have polio. And you know what?
p250
aVWe didn't have polio in this country yesterday.
p251
aVToday, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,
p252
aVand he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.
p253
aVAnd he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car,
p254
aVand he's going to come to Long Beach,
p255
aVand he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight.
p256
aVAnd he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,
p257
aVand we don't either because that's the way the world works.
p258
aVThat's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it.
p261
aVEveryone take their vitamins this morning?
p262
aVEchinacea, a little antioxidant
p263
aVto get you going.
p264
aVI know you did because half of Americans do every day.
p265
aVThey take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,
p266
aVand it doesn't matter how often
p267
aVwe find out that they're useless.
p268
aVThe data says it all the time.
p269
aVThey darken your urine. They almost never do more than that.
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aVIt's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine?
p272
aVI'm totally with you.
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVDark urine. Dark.
p275
aVWhy do we do that? Why do we do that?
p276
aVWell, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma.
p277
aVWe hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man.
p278
aVAnd we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks.
p279
aVIt's cruel to millions of people.
p280
aVIt's absolutely astonishingly cold
p281
aVand soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it.
p282
aVSo we run away from it, and where do we run?
p283
aVWe leap into the arms of Big Placebo.
p284
aV(Laughter)
p285
aVThat's fantastic. I love Big Placebo.
p286
aV(Applause)
p287
aa(lp288
VBut, you know, it's really a serious thing
p289
aVbecause this stuff is crap,
p290
aVand we spend billions of dollars on it.
p291
aVAnd I have all sorts of little props here.
p292
aVNone of it ... ginkgo, fraud;
p293
aVechinacea, fraud;
p294
aVacai \u2014 I don't even know what that is
p295
aVbut we're spending billions of dollars on it \u2014 it's fraud.
p296
aVAnd you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me,
p297
aVand they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do.
p298
aVIt makes them feel good."
p299
aVAnd you know what? You're wrong.
p300
aVBecause I don't care
p301
aVif it's the secretary of HHS
p302
aVwho's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence
p303
aVof my experts on mammograms,"
p304
aVor some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient
p305
aVwith coffee enemas.
p306
aVWhen you start down the road
p307
aVwhere belief and magic replace evidence and science,
p308
aVyou end up in a place you don't want to be.
p309
aVYou end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa.
p310
aVHe killed 400,000 of his people
p311
aVby insisting that beetroot,
p312
aVgarlic and lemon oil
p313
aVwere much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs
p314
aVwe know can slow the course of AIDS.
p315
aVHundreds of thousands of needless deaths
p316
aVin a country that has been plagued
p317
aVworse than any other by this disease.
p318
aVPlease, don't tell me
p319
aVthere are no consequences to these things.
p320
aVThere are. There always are.
p321
aa(lp322
VNow, the most mindless epidemic
p323
aVwe're in the middle of right now
p324
aVis this absurd battle
p325
aVbetween proponents of genetically engineered food
p326
aVand the organic elite.
p327
aVIt's an idiotic debate. It has to stop.
p328
aVIt's a debate about words, about metaphors.
p329
aVIt's ideology, it's not science.
p330
aVEvery single thing we eat, every grain of rice,
p331
aVevery sprig of parsley,
p332
aVevery Brussels sprout
p333
aVhas been modified by man.
p334
aVYou know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden.
p335
aVThere wasn't any cantaloupe. (Laughter)
p336
aVThere weren't Christmas trees. We made it all.
p337
aVWe made it over the last 11,000 years.
p338
aVAnd some of it worked, and some of it didn't.
p339
aVWe got rid of the stuff that didn't.
p340
aVNow we can do it in a more precise way \u2014
p341
aVand there are risks, absolutely \u2014
p342
aVbut we can put something like vitamin A into rice,
p343
aVand that stuff can help millions of people,
p344
aVmillions of people, prolong their lives.
p345
aVYou don't want to do that?
p346
aVI have to say, I don't understand it.
p347
aa(lp348
VWe object to genetically engineered food.
p349
aVWhy do we do that?
p350
aVWell, the things I constantly hear are:
p351
aVToo many chemicals,
p352
aVpesticides, hormones,
p353
aVmonoculture, we don't want giant fields
p354
aVof the same thing, that's wrong.
p355
aVWe don't companies patenting life.
p356
aVWe don't want companies owning seeds.
p357
aVAnd you know what my response to all of that is?
p358
aVYes, you're right. Let's fix it.
p359
aVIt's true, we've got a huge food problem,
p360
aVbut this isn't science.
p361
aVThis has nothing to do with science.
p362
aVIt's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.
p363
aVYou know science isn't a company.
p364
aVIt's not a country.
p365
aVIt's not even an idea; it's a process.
p366
aVIt's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,
p367
aVbut the idea that we should not allow
p368
aVscience to do its job
p369
aVbecause we're afraid,
p370
aVis really very deadening,
p371
aVand it's preventing millions of people
p372
aVfrom prospering.
p373
aa(lp374
VYou know, in the next 50 years
p375
aVwe're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now,
p376
aV70 percent.
p377
aVThis investment in Africa over the last 30 years.
p378
aVDisgraceful. Disgraceful.
p379
aVThey need it, and we're not giving it to them.
p380
aVAnd why? Genetically engineered food.
p381
aVWe don't want to encourage people
p382
aVto eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance.
p383
aVCassava's something that half a billion people eat.
p384
aVIt's kind of like a potato.
p385
aVIt's just a bunch of calories. It sucks.
p386
aVIt doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein,
p387
aVand scientists are engineering
p388
aVall of that into it right now.
p389
aVAnd then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.
p390
aVThey wouldn't starve, and you know what?
p391
aVThat would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse,
p392
aVbut it would be nice.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd all I can say about this is:
p395
aVWhy are we fighting it?
p396
aVI mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it?
p397
aVBecause we don't want to move genes around?
p398
aVThis is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals.
p399
aVIt's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones,
p400
aVour insistence on having bigger food,
p401
aVbetter food, singular food.
p402
aVThis isn't about Rice Krispies,
p403
aVthis is about keeping people alive,
p404
aVand it's about time we started to understand what that meant.
p405
aVBecause, you know something?
p406
aVIf we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting,
p407
aVwe're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of:
p408
aVhigh-tech colonialism.
p409
aVThere's no other way to describe what's going on here.
p410
aVIt's selfish, it's ugly,
p411
aVit's beneath us,
p412
aVand we really have to stop it.
p413
aa(lp414
VSo after this amazingly fun conversation,
p415
aV(Laughter)
p416
aVyou might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this
p417
aVridiculous time machine and go forward?"
p418
aVAbsolutely. Absolutely, I do.
p419
aVIt's stuck in the present right now,
p420
aVbut we have an amazing opportunity.
p421
aVWe can set that time machine on anything we want.
p422
aVWe can move it where we want to move it,
p423
aVand we're going to move it where we want to move it.
p424
aVWe have to have these conversations and we have to think,
p425
aVbut when we get in the time machine and we go ahead,
p426
aVwe're going to be happy we do.
p427
aVI know that we can,
p428
aVand as far as I'm concerned,
p429
aVthat's something the world needs right now.
p430
aa(lp431
V(Applause)
p432
aa(lp433
VThank you.
p434
aa(lp435
VThank you.
p436

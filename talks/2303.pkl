VThis back here was my brain cancer.
p5
aVIsn't it nice?
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVThe key phrase is "was,"
p8
aVphew.
p9
aV(Applause)
p10
aa(lp11
VHaving brain cancer was really, as you can imagine,
p12
aVshocking news for me.
p13
aVI knew nothing about cancer.
p14
aVIn Western cultures, when you have cancer,
p15
aVit's as if you disappear in a way.
p16
aVYour life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data:
p17
aVYour images, your exams, your lab values,
p18
aVa list of medicines.
p19
aVAnd everyone changes as well.
p20
aVYou suddenly become a disease on legs.
p21
aVDoctors start speaking a language which you don't understand.
p22
aVThey start pointing their fingers
p23
aVat your body and your images.
p24
aVPeople start changing as well
p25
aVbecause they start dealing with the disease,
p26
aVinstead of with the human being.
p27
aVThey say, "What did the doctor say?"
p28
aVbefore even saying, "Hello."
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd in the meanwhile,
p31
aVyou're left with questions to which nobody gives an answer.
p32
aVThese are the "Can I?" questions:
p33
aVCan I work while I have cancer?
p34
aVCan I study? Can I make love? Can I be creative?
p35
aVAnd you wonder, "What have I done to deserve this?"
p36
aVYou wonder, "Can I change something about my lifestyle?"
p37
aVYou wonder, "Can I do something?
p38
aVAre there any other options?"
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd, obviously, doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios,
p41
aVbecause they are very professional and dedicated to curing you.
p42
aVBut they also are very used to having to deal with patients,
p43
aVso I'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you
p44
aVand that you become, literally, a patient \u2014
p45
aV"patient" means "the one who waits."
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVThings are changing, but classically,
p48
aVthey tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition,
p49
aVto get your friends and family engaged,
p50
aVor showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle
p51
aVto minimize the risks of what you're going through.
p52
aVBut instead, you're forced there to wait
p53
aVin the hands of a series of very professional strangers.
p54
aa(lp55
VWhile I was in the hospital,
p56
aVI asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer
p57
aVand I spoke with it.
p58
aVIt was really hard to obtain,
p59
aVbecause it's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer.
p60
aVI talked to it and I said,
p61
aV"Okay, cancer, you're not all there is to me.
p62
aVThere's more to me.
p63
aVA cure, whichever it is, will have to deal with the whole of me."
p64
aVAnd so, the next day, I left the hospital against medical advice.
p65
aVI was determined to change my relationship with the cancer
p66
aVand I was determined to learn more about my cancer
p67
aVbefore doing anything as drastic as a surgery.
p68
aa(lp69
VI'm an artist, I use several forms of open-source technologies
p70
aVand open information in my practice.
p71
aVSo my best bet was to get it all out there, get the information out there,
p72
aVand use it so that it could be accessed by anyone.
p73
aVSo I created a website, which is called La Cura,
p74
aVon which I put my medical data, online.
p75
aVI actually had to hack it
p76
aVand that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVI chose this word, La Cura \u2014
p79
aVLa Cura in Italian means "the cure" \u2014
p80
aVbecause in many different cultures,
p81
aVthe word "cure" can mean many different things.
p82
aVIn our Western cultures,
p83
aVit means eradicating or reversing a disease,
p84
aVbut in different cultures,
p85
aVfor example, a culture from Asia,
p86
aVfrom the Mediterranean, from Latin countries, from Africa,
p87
aVit can mean many more things.
p88
aa(lp89
VOf course, I was interested in the opinions of doctors
p90
aVand healthcare providers,
p91
aVbut I was also interested in the cure of the artist, of the poet,
p92
aVof the designer,
p93
aVof, who knows, the musicians.
p94
aVI was interested in the social cure,
p95
aVI was interested in the psychological cure,
p96
aVI was interested in the spiritual cure,
p97
aVI was interested in the emotional cure,
p98
aVI was interested in any form of cure.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd, it worked.
p101
aVThe La Cura website went viral.
p102
aVI received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad
p103
aVand I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts \u2014
p104
aVemails, social networking \u2014
p105
aVmost of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer,
p106
aVbut more of them were about how to cure myself
p107
aVas a full individual.
p108
aVFor example, many thousands of videos,
p109
aVimages, pictures, art performances
p110
aVwere produced for La Cura.
p111
aVFor example, here we see Francesca Fini in her performance.
p112
aVOr, as artist Patrick Lichty has done:
p113
aVHe produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor
p114
aVand put it on sale on Thingiverse.
p115
aVNow you can have my cancer, too!
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aVWhich is a nice thing, if you think about it,
p118
aVwe can share our cancer.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd this was going on \u2014
p121
aVscientists, the traditional medicine experts,
p122
aVseveral researchers, doctors \u2014
p123
aVall connected with me to give advice.
p124
aVWith all this information and support,
p125
aVI was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons,
p126
aVtraditional doctors,
p127
aVoncologists, and several hundred volunteers
p128
aVwith whom I was able to discuss
p129
aVthe information I was receiving, which is very important.
p130
aVAnd together, we were able to form a strategy for my own cure
p131
aVin many languages, according to many cultures.
p132
aVAnd the current strategy spans the whole world
p133
aVand thousands of years of human history,
p134
aVwhich is quite remarkable for me.
p135
aV[Surgery]
p136
aa(lp137
VThe follow-up MRIs showed, luckily, little to no growth of the cancer.
p138
aVSo I was able to take my time and choose.
p139
aVI chose the doctor I wanted to work with,
p140
aVI chose the hospital I wanted to stay in,
p141
aVand in the meanwhile, I was supported by thousands of people,
p142
aVnone of whom felt pity for me.
p143
aVEveryone felt like they could take an active role
p144
aVin helping me to get well,
p145
aVand this was the most important part of La Cura.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhat are the outcomes?
p148
aVI'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine.
p149
aV(Applause)
p150
aVI had excellent news
p151
aVafter the surgery \u2014
p152
aVI have \u2014 I had a very low-grade glioma,
p153
aVwhich is a "good" kind of cancer which doesn't grow a lot.
p154
aVI have completely changed my life and my lifestyle.
p155
aVEverything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged.
p156
aa(lp157
VUp until the very last few minutes of the surgery,
p158
aVwhich was very intense,
p159
aVa matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain
p160
aVfrom this side,
p161
aVto be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls.
p162
aVAnd right before the operation,
p163
aVwe were able to discuss the functional map of my brain
p164
aVwith the doctor, to understand which risks I was running into
p165
aVand if there were any I wanted to avoid.
p166
aVObviously, there were.
p167
aV[Open]
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura.
p170
aVThousands of people shared their stories, their experiences.
p171
aVDoctors got to talk with people they don't usually consult
p172
aVwhen they think about cancer.
p173
aVI'm a self-founding, continuous state of translation
p174
aVamong many different languages,
p175
aVin which science meets emotion
p176
aVand conventional research meets traditional research.
p177
aV[Society]
p178
aa(lp179
VThe most important thing of La Cura
p180
aVwas to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society
p181
aVwhose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components.
p182
aVThis global performance is my open-source cure for cancer.
p183
aVAnd from what I feel,
p184
aVit's a cure for me, but for us all.
p185
aa(lp186
VThank you.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Applause).

VHave you ever been asked by your Chinese friend,
p5
aV"What is your zodiac sign?"
p6
aVDon't think they are making small talk.
p7
aVIf you say, "I'm a Monkey,"
p8
aVthey immediately know
p9
aVyou are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aVAsking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age.
p13
aa(lp14
VBy revealing your zodiac sign, you are also being evaluated.
p15
aVJudgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune,
p16
aVyour personality, career prospects
p17
aVand how you will do in a given year.
p18
aVIf you share you and your partner's animal signs,
p19
aVthey will paint a picture in their mind about your private life.
p20
aVMaybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac.
p21
aVAs a quarter of the world population is influenced by it,
p22
aVyou'd be wise to do something about that.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly?
p25
aVMost Westerners think of Greco-Roman zodiac,
p26
aVthe signs divided into 12 months.
p27
aVThe Chinese zodiac is different.
p28
aVIt's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals,
p29
aVstarting with a Rat and ending with a Pig,
p30
aVand has no association with constellations.
p31
aVFor example, if you were born in 1975, you are a Rabbit.
p32
aVCan you see your zodiac sign there?
p33
aVOur Chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework
p34
aVbased on yin and yang, the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals.
p35
aVOver thousands of years,
p36
aVthis popular culture has affected people's major decisions,
p37
aVsuch as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other.
p38
aVAnd some of the implications are quite amazing.
p39
aa(lp40
VThe Chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others.
p41
aVSo parents choose specific years to give birth to babies,
p42
aVbecause they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals
p43
aVcan give prosperity to families.
p44
aVWe even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations.
p45
aVI'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits.
p46
aVChinese people believe some animals are natural enemies.
p47
aVAs a Pig, I need to be careful with a Snake.
p48
aVRaise your hand if you are a Snake.
p49
aVLet's have a chat later.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VWe believe some animals are luckier than the others,
p54
aVsuch as the Dragon.
p55
aVUnlike the Western tradition,
p56
aVthe Chinese Dragon is a symbol for power, strength and wealth.
p57
aVIt's everyone's dream to have a Dragon baby.
p58
aVJack Ma's parents must have been very proud.
p59
aVAnd they are not the only ones.
p60
aVIn 2012, the Year of the Dragon,
p61
aVthe birthrate in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan
p62
aVincreased by five percent.
p63
aVThat means another one million more babies.
p64
aVWith a traditional preference to baby boys,
p65
aVthe boy-girl ratio that year was 120 to 100.
p66
aVWhen those Dragon boys grow up,
p67
aVthey will face much more severe competition in love and job markets.
p68
aa(lp69
VAccording to the BBC and the Chinese government's press release,
p70
aVJanuary 2015 saw a peak of Cesarean sections.
p71
aVWhy?
p72
aVThat was the last month for the Year of the Horse.
p73
aVIt's not because they like horses so much,
p74
aVit's because they try to avoid having unlucky Goat babies.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VIf you are a Goat, please don't feel bad.
p79
aVThose are Goat babies.
p80
aVThey don't look like losers to me.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VTiger is another undesirable animal,
p85
aVdue to its volatile temperament.
p86
aVMany Chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate
p87
aVduring those years.
p88
aVPerhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse,
p89
aVas those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition.
p90
aVMaybe they are the lucky ones.
p91
aVI went through the Forbes top 300 richest people in the world,
p92
aVand it's interesting to see
p93
aVthe most undesirable two animals, the Goat and Tiger,
p94
aVare at the top of the chart,
p95
aVeven higher than the Dragon.
p96
aVSo maybe we should consider,
p97
aVmaybe it's much better to have less competition.
p98
aa(lp99
VOne last but interesting point:
p100
aVmany Chinese people make their investment decisions
p101
aVbased on the zodiac sign index.
p102
aVAlthough the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign
p103
aVhas been over thousands of years,
p104
aVthe trend of using it in making major decisions
p105
aVdid not really happen until the past few decades.
p106
aVOur ancestors were very busy surviving poverty, drought,
p107
aVfamine, riot, disease and civil war.
p108
aVAnd finally, Chinese people have the time, wealth and technology
p109
aVto create an ideal life they've always wanted.
p110
aVThe collective decision made by 1.3 billion people
p111
aVhas caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything,
p112
aVfrom health care and education to property and consumer goods.
p113
aVAs China plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics,
p114
aVthe decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions
p115
aVend up impacting everyone around the world.
p116
aa(lp117
VAre there any Monkeys here?
p118
aV2016 is the Year of the Monkey.
p119
aVMonkeys are clever, curious, creative and mischievous.
p120
aa(lp121
VThank you.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Applause)

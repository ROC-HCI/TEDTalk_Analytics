VFor the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.
p5
aVAnd I'm here today to give you
p6
aVa little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed,
p7
aVthrough what I'm doing now.
p8
aVI've designed puzzles for books, printed things.
p9
aVI'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.
p10
aVI've been doing that for about 10 years.
p11
aVI have a monthly puzzle calendar.
p12
aVI do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games.
p13
aVI did puzzles for "Bejeweled."
p14
aV(Applause)
p15
aVI didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo, very first puzzle,
p18
aVsixth grade, my teacher said,
p19
aV"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.
p20
aVI'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper
p21
aVfor the board."
p22
aVI thought this was a great assignment.
p23
aVAnd so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.
p24
aVI came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet
p25
aVthat's been folded just once.
p26
aVThe question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?
p27
aVOne hint: It's not "L."
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVIt could be an "L," of course.
p30
aVSo, what else could it be?
p31
aVYeah, a lot of you got it.
p32
aVOh yeah. So, clever thing.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.
p35
aVI created something new, I was very excited
p36
aVbecause, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,
p37
aVbut that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.
p38
aVThis was something really original. I got hooked.
p39
aVI read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.
p40
aVWent on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?
p43
aVA puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve
p44
aVand has a right answer.
p45
aV"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems,
p46
aVwhich, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.
p47
aVYou know, they might have a solution.
p48
aVIt might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.
p49
aVWho designed this?
p50
aVIt's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story
p51
aVso we have to hire writers to make movies.
p52
aa(lp53
VWell, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.
p54
aVAnd "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer;
p55
aVmany puzzles have more than one.
p56
aVBut as opposed to a couple other forms of play,
p57
aVtoys and games \u2014
p58
aVby toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.
p59
aVYou can create one out of Legos.
p60
aVYou know, you can do anything you want.
p61
aVOr competitive games like chess where,
p62
aVwell, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,
p63
aVbut the goal really is to beat another player.
p64
aa(lp65
VI consider that puzzles are an art form.
p66
aVThey're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.
p67
aVIt's a very small form, like a joke,
p68
aVa poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.
p69
aVAt worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.
p70
aVBut at best they can reach for something more
p71
aVand create a memorable impression.
p72
aVThe progression of my career that you'll see
p73
aVis looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games,
p76
aVis that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.
p77
aVI'll show you how. Here is a famous one.
p78
aVSo, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.
p79
aVThis is called a figure-ground illusion.
p80
aVThe artist M.C. Escher exploited that
p81
aVin some of his wonderful prints.
p82
aVHere we have "Day and Night."
p83
aVHere is what I did with figure and ground.
p84
aVSo, here we have "figure" in black.
p85
aVHere we have "figure" in white.
p86
aVAnd it's all part of the same design.
p87
aVThe background to one is the other.
p88
aVOriginally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground."
p89
aVBut I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.
p90
aVIt's all "figure."
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VA few other things. Here is my name.
p94
aVAnd that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions."
p95
aVThese sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram."
p96
aVI'll show you just a couple others. Here we have
p97
aVthe numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.
p98
aVEach letter here is one of these digits.
p99
aVNot strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.
p100
aVI like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.
p101
aa(lp102
VHere's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down.
p103
aVIt's the same this way.
p104
aVAnd a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab
p105
aVwho just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.
p106
aVAnd so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVAnd recently in Magic magazine
p109
aVI've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.
p110
aVSo here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.
p111
aVThis appears in my puzzle calendar.
p112
aVOkay, let's go back to the slides.
p113
aVThank you very much.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, those are fun to look at.
p116
aVNow how would you do it interactively?
p117
aVFor a while I was an interface designer.
p118
aVAnd so I think a lot about interaction.
p119
aVWell, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,
p120
aVmake the thing on the right.
p121
aVNow, if you could pick up the black vase,
p122
aVit would look like the figure on top.
p123
aVIf you could pick up the white area,
p124
aVit would look like the figure on the bottom.
p125
aVWell, you can't do that physically,
p126
aVbut on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd here it is, figure-ground.
p129
aVThe goal here is to take the pieces on the left
p130
aVand make them so they look like the shape on the right.
p131
aVAnd this follows the rules I just said:
p132
aVany black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.
p133
aVBut that is also true of any white area.
p134
aVSo, here we got the white area in the middle,
p135
aVand you can pick it up.
p136
aVI'll just go one step further.
p137
aVSo, here is \u2014
p138
aVhere is a couple pieces. Move them together,
p139
aVand now this is an active piece.
p140
aVYou can really get inside somebody's perception
p141
aVand have them experience something.
p142
aVIt's like the old maxim of
p143
aV"you can tell somebody something
p144
aVand show them, but if they do it they really learn it."
p145
aa(lp146
VHere is another thing you can do.
p147
aVThere is a game called Rush Hour.
p148
aVThis is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design
p149
aVbesides Rubik's cube.
p150
aVSo, here we have a crowded parking lot
p151
aVwith cars all over the place.
p152
aVThe goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.
p153
aVIt's made by the company Think Fun.
p154
aVIt's done very well. I love this puzzle.
p155
aa(lp156
VWell, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.
p157
aVWell, that's too simple, let's add another piece.
p158
aVOkay, so how would you solve this one?
p159
aVWell, move the blue one out of the way.
p160
aVHere, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.
p161
aVNow we'll make it harder, a little harder.
p162
aVNow, this one is a little bit trickier.
p163
aVYou know? What do you do here?
p164
aVThe first move is going to be what?
p165
aVYou're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.
p166
aVAnd you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.
p167
aVThose four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.
p168
aa(lp169
VI wanted to make a sequel.
p170
aVI didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way
p171
aVI work as an inventor is to create a sequel.
p172
aVI came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.
p173
aVIt's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,
p174
aVa square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.
p175
aVIn the other game the cars can only move forward and back.
p176
aVCreated a whole bunch of levels for it.
p177
aVNow I'm making it available to schools.
p178
aVAnd it includes exercises that show you
p179
aVnot just how to solve these puzzles,
p180
aVbut how to extract the principles that will let you solve
p181
aVmathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles
p184
aVas well as just me creating them.
p185
aVGarry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.
p186
aVYou know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.
p187
aVIn Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.
p188
aVI got interested in gene sequencing.
p189
aVAnd I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence
p190
aVof the base pairs in DNA?"
p191
aVCut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,
p192
aVand then you look for overlaps,
p193
aVand you basically match them at the edges. And I said,
p194
aV"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."
p195
aa(lp196
VSo, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.
p197
aVAnd it has to be solvable in a magazine.
p198
aVYou know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.
p199
aVSo, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.
p200
aVAnd you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.
p201
aVThere is only one solution. It's not that hard.
p202
aVBut it takes some persistence.
p203
aVAnd when you're done, it makes this design,
p204
aVwhich, if you squint, is the word "helix."
p205
aVSo, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,
p206
aVrather than the other way around.
p207
aa(lp208
VHere is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.
p209
aVWhich way will these fall?
p210
aVOne of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.
p211
aVAnd depending on which one weighs which amount,
p212
aVthey'll fall different directions.
p213
aVAnd here is a puzzle based on color mixing.
p214
aVI separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,
p215
aVthe basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,
p216
aVand you get these peculiar pictures.
p217
aVWhich separations were mixed up to make those pictures?
p218
aVGets you thinking about color.
p219
aa(lp220
VFinally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com,
p221
aVwebsite you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.
p222
aVShe could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.
p223
aVSo, we're making smart games for social media.
p224
aVI'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.
p225
aVThis is what's going on in the games industry right now.
p226
aVFirst of all, you know, for a long time
p227
aVcomputer games meant things like "Doom,"
p228
aVwhere you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,
p229
aVaimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.
p230
aa(lp231
VWell, guess what? That's changing.
p232
aV"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open
p233
aVwhat's called casual games.
p234
aVAnd the main players are over 35, and are female.
p235
aVThen recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.
p236
aVAnd it's a game you play with other people.
p237
aVIt's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.
p238
aVThis is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, within that there is some interesting things happening.
p241
aVThere is also a trend towards games that are good for you.
p242
aVWhy? Well, we aging Boomers,
p243
aVBaby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,
p244
aVwe're exercising. What about our minds?
p245
aVOh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.
p246
aVTurns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.
p247
aVSo, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.
p248
aVA lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.
p251
aVEverybody now considers themselves a creator,
p252
aVand not just a viewer.
p253
aVAnd what does this add up to?
p254
aVHere is what we see coming.
p255
aVIt's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.
p256
aVThey're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.
p257
aVAnd they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.
p258
aVI'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.
p259
aVAnd we decided to combine our skills.
p260
aa(lp261
VOur first game is called "Photo Grab." The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.
p262
aVThis is your first time playing my game. Okay.
p263
aVLet's see how well we can do. There are three images.
p264
aVAnd we have 24 seconds each.
p265
aVWhere is that?
p266
aVI'll play as fast as I can.
p267
aVBut if you can see it, shout out the answer.
p268
aVYou get more \u2014 Down, okay, yeah where is that?
p269
aVOh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and \u2014
p270
aVI guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.
p271
aVThat's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.
p272
aVYeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.
p273
aVOkay, so that's the lens.
p274
aVAnybody?
p275
aVLooks like a black shape. So, where is that?
p276
aVThat's the corner of the whole thing.
p277
aVYeah, I've played this image before,
p278
aVbut even when I make up my own puzzles \u2014
p279
aVand you can put your own images in here.
p280
aVAnd we have people all over the world doing that now.
p281
aa(lp282
VThere we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com
p283
aVif you want to try it yourself. Thank you.

He specializes in ambigrams, or inversions: for example, a word that reads more than one way. His first puzzles appeared in <em>Scientific American</em> in Martin Gardner&#39;s Mathematical Games column, and are now included in many different books, toys and games. His games can also be played on his&nbsp;website&nbsp;or found on greeting cards. Kim&#39;s 1981 book, <a href=\\"http://geni.us/3cnm\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Inversions</em></a>, features a collection of &quot;inversions&quot; -- a word or name written so it reads in more than one way.

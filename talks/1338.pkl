VThe maxim, "Know thyself" has been around since the ancient Greeks.
p5
aVSome attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.
p6
aVBut the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first,
p7
aVbecause it's still sage advice, even today.
p8
aV"Know thyself."
p9
aVIt's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless,
p10
aVbut it rings familiar and true, doesn't it?
p11
aV"Know thyself."
p12
aVI understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems,
p13
aVor more exactly, the confusions, of consciousness.
p14
aVI've always been fascinated with knowing the self.
p15
aVThis fascination led me to submerge myself in art,
p16
aVstudy neuroscience, and later, to become a psychotherapist.
p17
aa(lp18
VToday I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon,
p19
aVa thought-controlled computing company.
p20
aVMy goal, quite simply, is to help people become more in tune with themselves.
p21
aVI take it from this little dictum, "Know thyself."
p22
aVIf you think about it,
p23
aVthis imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species, isn't it?
p24
aVI mean, it's self-awareness
p25
aVthat separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind.
p26
aa(lp27
VToday we're often too busy
p28
aVtending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves.
p29
aVUnder the deluge of minute-to-minute text conversations,
p30
aVe-mails, relentless exchange of media channels
p31
aVand passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags,
p32
aVwe lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place:
p33
aVOurselves.
p34
aVMuch of the time we're transfixed
p35
aVby all of the ways we can reflect ourselves out into the world.
p36
aVAnd we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves.
p37
aVWe've cluttered ourselves up with all this.
p38
aVAnd we feel like we have to get far, far away to a secluded retreat,
p39
aVleaving it all behind.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo we go far away to the top of a mountain,
p42
aVassuming that perching ourselves on a piece
p43
aVis bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday,
p44
aVand find ourselves again.
p45
aVBut on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind,
p46
aVwhat are we really achieving?
p47
aVIt's really only a successful escape.
p48
aVThink of the term we use, "Retreat."
p49
aVThis is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle.
p50
aVIt means we've got to get out of here.
p51
aVIs this how we feel about the pressures of our world,
p52
aVthat in order to get inside ourselves,
p53
aVyou have to run for the hills?
p54
aVAnd the problem with escaping your day-to-day life
p55
aVis that you have to come home, eventually.
p56
aVSo when you think about it,
p57
aVwe're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there.
p58
aVAnd eventually, that vacation's got to come to an end.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo my question to you is,
p61
aVcan we find ways to know ourselves without the escape?
p62
aVCan we redefine our relationship with the technologized world
p63
aVin order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek?
p64
aVCan we live here and now in our wired web
p65
aVand still follow those ancient instructions, "Know thyself?"
p66
aVI say the answer is yes.
p67
aVAnd I'm here today to share a new way
p68
aVthat we're working with technology to this end,
p69
aVto get familiar with our inner self like never before \u2014
p70
aVhumanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours
p71
aVto more fully know the self.
p72
aVIt's called thought-controlled computing.
p73
aa(lp74
VYou may or may not have noticed
p75
aVthat I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead.
p76
aVThis is actually a brainwave sensor
p77
aVthat's reading the electrical activity of my brain
p78
aVas I give this talk.
p79
aVThese brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph.
p80
aVLet me show you what it looks like.
p81
aVThat blue line there is my brainwave.
p82
aVIt's the direct signal being recorded from my head, rendered in real time.
p83
aVThe green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency,
p84
aVwith lower frequencies here
p85
aVand higher frequencies up here.
p86
aVYou're actually looking inside my head as I speak.
p87
aVThese graphs are compelling, they're undulating,
p88
aVbut from a human's perspective, they're actually not very useful.
p89
aVThat's why we've spent a lot of time
p90
aVthinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it.
p91
aa(lp92
VFor instance,
p93
aVwhat if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment?
p94
aVOr what if I can take that information
p95
aVand put it into an organic shape up on the screen?
p96
aVThe shape on the right over here
p97
aVhas become an indicator of what's going on in my head.
p98
aVThe more relaxed I am,
p99
aVthe more the energy's going to fall through it.
p100
aVI may also be interested in knowing how focused I am,
p101
aVso I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side.
p102
aVAnd the more focused my brain is,
p103
aVthe more the circuit board is going to surge with energy.
p104
aa(lp105
VOrdinarily, I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was
p106
aVin any tangible way.
p107
aVAs we know, our feelings about how we're feeling
p108
aVare notoriously unreliable.
p109
aVWe've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it
p110
aVuntil we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it,
p111
aVand then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves
p112
aVa little earlier.
p113
aVThis new awareness opens up vast possibilities
p114
aVfor applications that help improve our lives and ourselves.
p115
aVWe're trying to create technology that uses the insights
p116
aVto make our work more efficient, our breaks more relaxing
p117
aVand our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever.
p118
aVI'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit,
p119
aVbut first I want to take a look at how we got here.
p120
aVBy the way, feel free to check in on my head at any time.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VMy team at InteraXon and I
p125
aVhave been developing thought-controlled application for almost a decade now.
p126
aVIn the first phase of development,
p127
aVwe were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind.
p128
aVWe were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking.
p129
aVWe were transcending the space between the mind and the device.
p130
aVWe brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products
p131
aVthat you could control with your mind,
p132
aVlike thought-controlled home appliances
p133
aVor slot-car games or video games or a levitating chair.
p134
aVWe created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations,
p135
aVand it was really exciting.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics.
p138
aVWe were invited to create a massive installation
p139
aVat the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics,
p140
aVwere used in Vancouver,
p141
aVgot to control the lighting on the CN Tower,
p142
aVthe Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls
p143
aVfrom all the way across the country using their minds.
p144
aVOver 17 days at the Olympics, 7,000 visitors from all over the world
p145
aVactually got to individually control the light
p146
aVfrom the CN Tower, parliament and Niagara in real time
p147
aVwith their minds from across the country, 3,000 km away.
p148
aVSo controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut we're always interested in multitiered levels of human interaction.
p151
aVAnd so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications
p152
aVin a more complex frame than just control.
p153
aVAnd that was responsiveness.
p154
aVWe realized that we had a system
p155
aVthat allowed technology to know something about you.
p156
aVAnd it could join into the relationship with you.
p157
aVWe created the responsive room
p158
aVwhere the lights, music and blinds adjusted to your state.
p159
aVThey followed these little shifts in your mental activity.
p160
aVSo as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day,
p161
aVon the couch in our office,
p162
aVthe music would mellow with you.
p163
aVWhen you read, the desk lamp would get brighter.
p164
aVIf you nod off, the system would know, dimming to darkness as you do.
p165
aa(lp166
VWe then realized that if technology could know something about you
p167
aVand use it to help you,
p168
aVthere's an even more valuable application than that.
p169
aVThat you could know something about yourself.
p170
aVWe could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible
p171
aVand come to see things that were previously hidden.
p172
aVLet me show you an example of what I'm talking about here.
p173
aa(lp174
VHere's an application that I created for the iPad.
p175
aVSo the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form.
p176
aVSo you use it with your headset.
p177
aVThe headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone.
p178
aVIn that headset, you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear.
p179
aVIn the original Zen Bound game,
p180
aVyou play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad.
p181
aVIn the game that we created, of course,
p182
aVyou control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind.
p183
aVAs you focus on the wooden form,
p184
aVit rotates.
p185
aVThe more you focus, the faster the rotation.
p186
aVThis is for real.
p187
aVThis is not a fake.
p188
aVWhat's really interesting to me though
p189
aVis at the end of the game, you get stats and feedback about how you did.
p190
aVYou have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing \u2014
p191
aVnot just how much rope you used or what your high score is,
p192
aVbut what was going on inside of your mind.
p193
aVAnd this is valuable feedback
p194
aVthat we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves.
p195
aa(lp196
VI like to call this "intra-active."
p197
aVNormally, we think about technology as interactive.
p198
aVThis technology is intra-active.
p199
aVIt understands what's inside of you
p200
aVand builds a sort of responsive relationship
p201
aVbetween you and your technology
p202
aVso that you can use this information to move you forward.
p203
aVSo you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop.
p204
aVAt InteraXon \u2014
p205
aVintra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates.
p206
aVIt's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside
p207
aVinto this tight loop.
p208
aa(lp209
VFor example, thought-controlled computing
p210
aVcan teach children with ADD how to improve their focus.
p211
aVWith ADD, children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states
p212
aVand a high proportion of theta states.
p213
aVSo you can create applications that reward focused brain states.
p214
aVSo you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves
p215
aVand improving their ADD symptoms as they do it.
p216
aVThis can be as effective as Ritalin.
p217
aVPerhaps even more importantly,
p218
aVthought-controlled computing can give children with ADD
p219
aVinsights into their own fluctuating mental states,
p220
aVso they can better understand themselves and their learning needs.
p221
aVThe way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves
p222
aVwill upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas
p223
aVthat people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with.
p224
aa(lp225
VWe can peer inside our heads
p226
aVand interact with what was once locked away from us,
p227
aVwhat once mystified and separated us.
p228
aVBrainwave technology can understand us, anticipate our emotions
p229
aVand find the best solutions for our needs.
p230
aVImagine this collected awareness of the individual
p231
aVcomputed and reflected across an entire lifespan.
p232
aVImagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight.
p233
aVIt would be like plugging into your own personal Google.
p234
aa(lp235
VOn the subject of Google,
p236
aVtoday you can search and tag images
p237
aVbased on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them.
p238
aVYou can tag pictures of baby animals as happy,
p239
aVor whatever baby animals are to you,
p240
aVand then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings,
p241
aVrather than the keywords that just hint at them.
p242
aVOr you could tag Facebook photos
p243
aVwith the emotions that you had associated with those memories
p244
aVand then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention,
p245
aVjust like this.
p246
aVHumanizing technology is about taking what's already natural
p247
aVabout the human-tech experience
p248
aVand building technology seamlessly in tandem with it.
p249
aVAs it aligns with our human behaviors,
p250
aVit can allow us to make better sense of what we do
p251
aVand, more importantly, why.
p252
aVCreating a big picture out of all the important little details
p253
aVthat make up who we are.
p254
aa(lp255
VWith humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles.
p256
aVWhen our productivity starts to slacken, we can go back to that data
p257
aVand see how we can make more effective balance between work and play.
p258
aVDo you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self,
p259
aVwhat triggers cause you to be depressed
p260
aVor what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk?
p261
aVImagine if you had access to data
p262
aVthat allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness
p263
aVwhich people in your life made you the happiest,
p264
aVor what activities brought you joy.
p265
aVWould you make more time for those people? Would you prioritize?
p266
aVWould you get a divorce?
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VWhat thought-controlled computing can allow you to do
p271
aVis build colorful layered pictures of our lives.
p272
aVAnd with this, we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings
p273
aVand build a story of our behaviors over time.
p274
aVWe can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward
p275
aVand tell us about what's going on.
p276
aVAnd from this, we can learn how to change the plot, the outcome
p277
aVand the character of our personal stories.
p278
aa(lp279
VTwo millennia ago, those Greeks had some powerful insights.
p280
aVThey knew that a fundamental piece falls into place
p281
aVwhen you start to live out their little phrase,
p282
aVwhen you come into contact with yourself.
p283
aVThey understood the power of human narrative
p284
aVand the value that we place on humans as changing, evolving and growing.
p285
aVBut they understood something more fundamental \u2014
p286
aVthe sheer joy in discovery,
p287
aVthe delight and fascination that we get from the world
p288
aVand being ourselves in it;
p289
aVthe richness that we get from seeing, feeling and knowing the lives that we are.
p290
aa(lp291
VMy mom's an artist,
p292
aVand as a child, I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush.
p293
aVOne moment, it was all white space, pure possibility.
p294
aVThe next, it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions.
p295
aVAs I sat easel-side, watching her transform canvas after canvas,
p296
aVI learned that you could create your own world.
p297
aVI learned that our own inner worlds \u2014
p298
aVour ideas, emotions and imaginations \u2014
p299
aVwere, in fact, not bound by our brains and bodies.
p300
aVIf you could think it, if you could discover it,
p301
aVyou could bring it to life.
p302
aa(lp303
VTo me, thought-controlled computing
p304
aVis as simple and powerful as a paintbrush \u2014
p305
aVone more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us.
p306
aVI look forward to the day that I can sit beside you, easel-side,
p307
aVwatching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes
p308
aVand the discoveries that we can make about ourselves.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you.

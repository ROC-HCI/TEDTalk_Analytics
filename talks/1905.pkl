VIt's a pleasure to be here
p5
aVin Edinburgh, Scotland,
p6
aVthe birthplace of the needle and syringe.
p7
aVLess than a mile from here in this direction,
p8
aVin 1853 a Scotsman
p9
aVfiled his very first patent on the needle and syringe.
p10
aVHis name was Alexander Wood,
p11
aVand it was at the Royal College of Physicians.
p12
aVThis is the patent.
p13
aVWhat blows my mind when I look at it even today
p14
aVis that it looks almost identical
p15
aVto the needle in use today.
p16
aVYet, it's 160 years old.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo we turn to the field of vaccines.
p19
aVMost vaccines are delivered with
p20
aVthe needle and syringe,  this 160-year-old technology.
p21
aVAnd credit where it's due \u2014 on many levels,
p22
aVvaccines are a successful technology.
p23
aVAfter clean water and sanitation,
p24
aVvaccines are the one technology that has increased
p25
aVour life span the most.
p26
aVThat's a pretty hard act to beat.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut just like any other technology,
p29
aVvaccines have their shortcomings,
p30
aVand the needle and syringe
p31
aVis a key part within that narrative \u2014
p32
aVthis old technology.
p33
aVSo let's start with the obvious:
p34
aVMany of us don't like the needle and syringe.
p35
aVI share that view.
p36
aVHowever, 20 percent of the population
p37
aVhave a thing called needle phobia.
p38
aVThat's more than disliking the needle;
p39
aVthat is actively avoiding being vaccinated
p40
aVbecause of needle phobia.
p41
aVAnd that's problematic in terms  of the rollout of vaccines.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, related to this is another key issue,
p44
aVwhich is needlestick injuries.
p45
aVAnd the WHO has figures
p46
aVthat suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year
p47
aVtake place due to cross-contamination
p48
aVwith needlestick injuries.
p49
aVThese are early deaths that take place.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, these are two things that  you probably may have heard of,
p52
aVbut there are two other shortcomings
p53
aVof the needle and syringe you  may not have heard about.
p54
aVOne is it could be holding back
p55
aVthe next generation of vaccines
p56
aVin terms of their immune responses.
p57
aVAnd the second is that it could be responsible
p58
aVfor the problem of the cold chain that I'll tell you about as well.
p59
aa(lp60
VI'm going to tell you about some work
p61
aVthat my team and I are doing in Australia
p62
aVat the University of Queensland
p63
aVon a technology designed to  tackle those four problems.
p64
aVAnd that technology is called the Nanopatch.
p65
aVNow, this is a specimen of the Nanopatch.
p66
aVTo the naked eye
p67
aVit just looks like a square
p68
aVsmaller than a postage stamp,
p69
aVbut under a microscope
p70
aVwhat you see are thousands of tiny projections
p71
aVthat are invisible to the human eye.
p72
aVAnd there's about 4,000 projections
p73
aVon this particular square compared to the needle.
p74
aVAnd I've designed those projections
p75
aVto serve a key role, which is to  work with the skin's immune system.
p76
aVSo that's a very important function
p77
aVtied in with the Nanopatch.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow we make the Nanopatch
p80
aVwith a technique
p81
aVcalled deep reactive ion etching.
p82
aVAnd this particular technique  is one that's been borrowed
p83
aVfrom the semiconductor industry,
p84
aVand therefore is low cost
p85
aVand can be rolled out in large numbers.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow we dry-coat vaccines to  the projections of the Nanopatch
p88
aVand apply it to the skin.
p89
aVNow, the simplest form of application
p90
aVis using our finger,
p91
aVbut our finger has some limitations,
p92
aVso we've devised an applicator.
p93
aVAnd it's a very simple device \u2014
p94
aVyou could call it a sophisticated finger.
p95
aVIt's a spring-operated device.
p96
aVWhat we do is when we apply  the Nanopatch to the skin as so \u2014
p97
aV(Click) \u2014
p98
aVimmediately a few things happen.
p99
aVSo firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch
p100
aVbreach through the tough outer layer
p101
aVand the vaccine is very quickly released \u2014
p102
aVwithin less than a minute, in fact.
p103
aVThen we can take the Nanopatch off
p104
aVand discard it.
p105
aVAnd indeed we can make  a reuse of the applicator itself.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch,
p108
aVand immediately you can see some key advantages.
p109
aVWe've talked about it being needle-free \u2014
p110
aVthese are projections that you can't even see \u2014
p111
aVand, of course, we get around
p112
aVthe needle phobia issue as well.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, if we take a step back and think about
p115
aVthese other two really important advantages:
p116
aVOne is improved immune  responses through delivery,
p117
aVand the second is getting rid of the cold chain.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo let's start with the first one,  this immunogenicity idea.
p120
aVIt takes a little while to get our heads around,
p121
aVbut I'll try to explain it in simple terms.
p122
aVSo I'll take a step back and explain to you
p123
aVhow vaccines work in a simple way.
p124
aVSo vaccines work by introducing into our body
p125
aVa thing called an antigen
p126
aVwhich is a safe form of a germ.
p127
aVNow that safe germ, that antigen,
p128
aVtricks our body into mounting an immune response,
p129
aVlearning and remembering  how to deal with intruders.
p130
aVWhen the real intruder comes along
p131
aVthe body quickly mounts an immune response
p132
aVto deal with that vaccine
p133
aVand neutralizes the infection.
p134
aVSo it does that well.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, the way it's done today  with the needle and syringe,
p137
aVmost vaccines are delivered that way \u2014
p138
aVwith this old technology and the needle.
p139
aVBut it could be argued that the needle  is holding back our immune responses;
p140
aVit's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin.
p141
aVTo describe this idea,
p142
aVwe need to take a journey through the skin,
p143
aVstarting with one of those projections
p144
aVand applying the Nanopatch to the skin.
p145
aVAnd we see this kind of data.
p146
aVNow, this is real data \u2014
p147
aVthat thing that we can see there is one projection
p148
aVfrom the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin
p149
aVand those colors are different layers.
p150
aVNow, to give you an idea of scale,
p151
aVif the needle was shown here, it would be too big.
p152
aVIt would be 10 times bigger
p153
aVthan the size of that screen, going 10 times deeper as well.
p154
aVIt's off the grid entirely.
p155
aVYou can see immediately that we  have those projections in the skin.
p156
aVThat red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin,
p157
aVbut the brown layer and the magenta layer
p158
aVare jammed full of immune cells.
p159
aVAs one example, in the brown layer
p160
aVthere's a certain type of cell  called a Langerhans cell \u2014
p161
aVevery square millimeter of our body
p162
aVis jammed full of those Langerhans cells,
p163
aVthose immune cells, and  there's others shown as well
p164
aVthat we haven't stained in this image.
p165
aVBut you can immediately see that the Nanopatch
p166
aVachieves that penetration indeed.
p167
aVWe target thousands upon thousands  of these particular cells
p168
aVjust residing within a hair's width
p169
aVof the surface of the skin.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, as the guy that's invented this thing and designed it to do that,
p172
aVI found that exciting. But so what?
p173
aVSo what if you've targeted cells?
p174
aVIn the world of vaccines, what does that mean?
p175
aVThe world of vaccines is getting better.
p176
aVIt's getting more systematic.
p177
aVHowever, you still don't really know
p178
aVif a vaccine is going to work
p179
aVuntil you roll your sleeves up
p180
aVand vaccinate and wait.
p181
aVIt's a gambler's game even today.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo, we had to do that gamble.
p184
aVWe obtained an influenza vaccine,
p185
aVwe applied it to our Nanopatches
p186
aVand we applied the Nanopatches to the skin,
p187
aVand we waited \u2014
p188
aVand this is in the live animal.
p189
aVWe waited a month,
p190
aVand this is what we found out.
p191
aVThis is a data slide showing the immune responses
p192
aVthat we've generated with a Nanopatch
p193
aVcompared to the needle and syringe into muscle.
p194
aVSo on the horizontal axis we have  the dose shown in nanograms.
p195
aVOn the vertical axis we have  the immune response generated,
p196
aVand that dashed line indicates  the protection threshold.
p197
aVIf we're above that line it's considered protective;
p198
aVif we're below that line it's not.
p199
aVSo the red line is mostly below that curve
p200
aVand indeed there's only one point that  is achieved with the needle that's protective,
p201
aVand that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms.
p202
aVBut notice immediately the distinctly different curve
p203
aVthat we achieve with the blue line.
p204
aVThat's what's achieved with the Nanopatch;
p205
aVthe delivered dose of the Nanopatch is
p206
aVa completely different immunogenicity curve.
p207
aVThat's a real fresh opportunity.
p208
aVSuddenly we have a brand new lever
p209
aVin the world of vaccines.
p210
aVWe can push it one way,
p211
aVwhere we can take a vaccine  that works but is too expensive
p212
aVand can get protection
p213
aVwith a hundredth of the dose  compared to the needle.
p214
aVThat can take a vaccine that's suddenly  10 dollars down to 10 cents,
p215
aVand that's particularly important  within the developing world.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut there's another angle to this as well \u2014
p218
aVyou can take vaccines that currently don't work
p219
aVand get them over that line
p220
aVand get them protective.
p221
aVAnd certainly in the world of vaccines
p222
aVthat can be important.
p223
aVLet's consider the big three:
p224
aVHIV, malaria, tuberculosis.
p225
aVThey're responsible for about  7 million deaths per year,
p226
aVand there is no adequate vaccination  method for any of those.
p227
aVSo potentially, with this new lever  that we have with the Nanopatch,
p228
aVwe can help make that happen.
p229
aVWe can push that lever to help get those  candidate vaccines over the line.
p230
aVNow, of course, we've worked within my lab
p231
aVwith many other vaccines that have attained
p232
aVsimilar responses and similar curves to this,
p233
aVwhat we've achieved with influenza.
p234
aa(lp235
VI'd like to now switch to talk about
p236
aVanother key shortcoming of today's vaccines,
p237
aVand that is the need to maintain the cold chain.
p238
aVAs the name suggests \u2014 the cold chain \u2014
p239
aVit's the requirements of keeping  a vaccine right from production
p240
aVall the way through to when the vaccine is applied,
p241
aVto keep it refrigerated.
p242
aVNow, that presents some logistical challenges
p243
aVbut we have ways to do it.
p244
aVThis is a slightly extreme case in point
p245
aVbut it helps illustrate the logistical challenges,
p246
aVin particular in resource-poor settings,
p247
aVof what's required to get vaccines
p248
aVrefrigerated and maintain the cold chain.
p249
aVIf the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down,
p250
aVbut interestingly it can be too cold
p251
aVand the vaccine can break down as well.
p252
aa(lp253
VNow, the stakes are very high.
p254
aVThe WHO estimates that within Africa,
p255
aVup to half the vaccines used there
p256
aVare considered to not be working properly
p257
aVbecause at some point the  cold chain has fallen over.
p258
aVSo it's a big problem, and it's tied  in with the needle and syringe
p259
aVbecause it's a liquid form vaccine, and  when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration.
p260
aa(lp261
VA key attribute of our Nanopatch
p262
aVis that the vaccine is dry,
p263
aVand when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration.
p264
aVWithin my lab we've shown that we can keep
p265
aVthe vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius
p266
aVfor more than a year without  any loss in activity at all.
p267
aVThat's an important improvement.
p268
aV(Applause)
p269
aVWe're delighted about it as well.
p270
aVAnd the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven
p271
aVthe Nanopatch within the laboratory setting.
p272
aVAnd as a scientist, I love that and I love science.
p273
aVHowever, as an engineer,
p274
aVas a biomedical engineer
p275
aVand also as a human being,
p276
aVI'm not going to be satisfied
p277
aVuntil we've rolled this thing  out, taken it out of the lab
p278
aVand got it to people in large numbers
p279
aVand particularly the people that need it the most.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo we've commenced this particular journey,
p282
aVand we've commenced this  journey in an unusual way.
p283
aVWe've started with Papua New Guinea.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow, Papua New Guinea is an example  of a developing world country.
p286
aVIt's about the same size as France,
p287
aVbut it suffers from many of the key barriers
p288
aVexisting within the world of today's vaccines.
p289
aVThere's the logistics:
p290
aVWithin this country there are only 800  refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled.
p291
aVMany of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby, many of them are breaking down
p292
aVand many are not in the Highlands  where they are required.
p293
aVThat's a challenge.
p294
aVBut also, Papua New Guinea has the  world's highest incidence of HPV,
p295
aVhuman papillomavirus, the  cervical cancer [risk factor].
p296
aVYet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers
p297
aVbecause it's too expensive.
p298
aVSo for those two reasons, with  the attributes of the Nanopatch,
p299
aVwe've got into the field and  worked with the Nanopatch,
p300
aVand taken it to Papua New Guinea
p301
aVand we'll be following that up shortly.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow, doing this kind of work is not easy.
p304
aVIt's challenging,
p305
aVbut there's nothing else in  the world I'd rather be doing.
p306
aVAnd as we look ahead
p307
aVI'd like to share with you a thought:
p308
aVIt's the thought of a future where
p309
aVthe 17 million deaths per year
p310
aVthat we currently have due to infectious disease
p311
aVis a historical footnote.
p312
aVAnd it's a historical footnote that has been achieved
p313
aVby improved, radically improved vaccines.
p314
aVNow standing here today in front of you
p315
aVat the birthplace of the needle and syringe,
p316
aVa device that's 160 years old,
p317
aVI'm presenting to you an alternative approach
p318
aVthat could really help make that happen \u2014
p319
aVand it's the Nanopatch with its attributes  of being needle-free, pain-free,
p320
aVthe ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity.
p321
aVThank you.

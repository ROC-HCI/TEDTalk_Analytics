VMy talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."
p5
aVAnd you would think that should have nothing to do with one another,
p6
aVbut I hope by the end of these 18 minutes,
p7
aVyou'll see a little bit of a relation.
p8
aVIt ties to origami. So let me start.
p9
aVWhat is origami?
p10
aVMost people think they know what origami is. It's this:
p11
aVflapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.
p12
aVAnd that is what origami used to be.
p13
aVBut it's become something else.
p14
aVIt's become an art form, a form of sculpture.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe common theme \u2014 what makes it origami \u2014
p17
aVis folding is how we create the form.
p18
aVYou know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.
p19
aVIt shows these women playing with these toys.
p20
aVIf you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.
p21
aVEvery Japanese kid
p22
aVlearns how to fold that crane.
p23
aVSo this art has been around for hundreds of years,
p24
aVand you would think something
p25
aVthat's been around that long \u2014 so restrictive, folding only \u2014
p26
aVeverything that could be done has been done a long time ago.
p27
aVAnd that might have been the case.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut in the twentieth century,
p30
aVa Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,
p31
aVand he created tens of thousands of new designs.
p32
aVBut even more importantly, he created a language,
p33
aVa way we could communicate,
p34
aVa code of dots, dashes and arrows.
p35
aVHarkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,
p36
aVwe now have a means of transmitting information
p37
aVwith heredity and selection,
p38
aVand we know where that leads.
p39
aVAnd where it has led in origami
p40
aVis to things like this.
p41
aVThis is an origami figure \u2014
p42
aVone sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.
p43
aVThis, too, is origami,
p44
aVand this shows where we've gone in the modern world.
p45
aVNaturalism. Detail.
p46
aVYou can get horns, antlers \u2014
p47
aVeven, if you look close, cloven hooves.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd it raises a question: what changed?
p50
aVAnd what changed is something
p51
aVyou might not have expected in an art,
p52
aVwhich is math.
p53
aVThat is, people applied mathematical principles
p54
aVto the art,
p55
aVto discover the underlying laws.
p56
aVAnd that leads to a very powerful tool.
p57
aVThe secret to productivity in so many fields \u2014
p58
aVand in origami \u2014
p59
aVis letting dead people do your work for you.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VBecause what you can do is
p64
aVtake your problem,
p65
aVand turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,
p66
aVand use their solutions.
p67
aVAnd I want to tell you how we did that in origami.
p68
aVOrigami revolves around crease patterns.
p69
aVThe crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint
p70
aVfor an origami figure.
p71
aVAnd you can't just draw them arbitrarily.
p72
aVThey have to obey four simple laws.
p73
aVAnd they're very simple, easy to understand.
p74
aVThe first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern
p75
aVwith just two colors without ever having
p76
aVthe same color meeting.
p77
aVThe directions of the folds at any vertex \u2014
p78
aVthe number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds \u2014
p79
aValways differs by two. Two more or two less.
p80
aVNothing else.
p81
aVIf you look at the angles around the fold,
p82
aVyou find that if you number the angles in a circle,
p83
aVall the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,
p84
aVall the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.
p85
aVAnd if you look at how the layers stack,
p86
aVyou'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,
p87
aVa sheet can never
p88
aVpenetrate a fold.
p89
aVSo that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.
p90
aVAll of origami comes from that.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd you'd think, "Can four simple laws
p93
aVgive rise to that kind of complexity?"
p94
aVBut indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics
p95
aVcan be written down on a napkin,
p96
aVand yet they govern all of chemistry,
p97
aVall of life, all of history.
p98
aVIf we obey these laws,
p99
aVwe can do amazing things.
p100
aVSo in origami, to obey these laws,
p101
aVwe can take simple patterns \u2014
p102
aVlike this repeating pattern of folds, called textures \u2014
p103
aVand by itself it's nothing.
p104
aVBut if we follow the laws of origami,
p105
aVwe can put these patterns into another fold
p106
aVthat itself might be something very, very simple,
p107
aVbut when we put it together,
p108
aVwe get something a little different.
p109
aVThis fish, 400 scales \u2014
p110
aVagain, it is one uncut square, only folding.
p111
aVAnd if you don't want to fold 400 scales,
p112
aVyou can back off and just do a few things,
p113
aVand add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.
p114
aVOr you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars
p115
aVon a flag, with 13 stripes.
p116
aVAnd if you want to go really crazy,
p117
aV1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.
p118
aVAnd this guy's on display downstairs,
p119
aVso take a look if you get a chance.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe most powerful tools in origami
p122
aVhave related to how we get parts of creatures.
p123
aVAnd I can put it in this simple equation.
p124
aVWe take an idea,
p125
aVcombine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VWhat matters is what we mean by those symbols.
p130
aVAnd you might say, "Can you really be that specific?
p131
aVI mean, a stag beetle \u2014 it's got two points for jaws,
p132
aVit's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"
p133
aVAnd yeah, you really can.
p134
aVSo how do we do that? Well, we break it down
p135
aVinto a few smaller steps.
p136
aVSo let me stretch out that equation.
p137
aVI start with my idea. I abstract it.
p138
aVWhat's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.
p139
aVAnd from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape
p140
aVthat has a part for every bit of the subject,
p141
aVa flap for every leg.
p142
aVAnd then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,
p143
aVyou can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,
p144
aVyou can turn it into the finished shape.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow the first step, pretty easy.
p147
aVTake an idea, draw a stick figure.
p148
aVThe last step is not so hard, but that middle step \u2014
p149
aVgoing from the abstract description to the folded shape \u2014
p150
aVthat's hard.
p151
aVBut that's the place where the mathematical ideas
p152
aVcan get us over the hump.
p153
aVAnd I'm going to show you all how to do that
p154
aVso you can go out of here and fold something.
p155
aVBut we're going to start small.
p156
aVThis base has a lot of flaps in it.
p157
aVWe're going to learn how to make one flap.
p158
aVHow would you make a single flap?
p159
aVTake a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,
p160
aVuntil it gets long and narrow,
p161
aVand then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.
p162
aVI could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.
p163
aa(lp164
VWhat paper went into that flap?
p165
aVWell, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,
p166
aVyou can see that the upper left corner of that shape
p167
aVis the paper that went into the flap.
p168
aVSo that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.
p169
aVI can use it for something else.
p170
aVWell, there are other ways of making a flap.
p171
aVThere are other dimensions for flaps.
p172
aVIf I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.
p173
aVIf I make the flap as skinny as possible,
p174
aVI get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.
p175
aVAnd you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.
p176
aVThere's other ways of making flaps.
p177
aVIf I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.
p178
aVAnd if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.
p179
aVSo, no matter how I make a flap,
p180
aVit needs some part
p181
aVof a circular region of paper.
p182
aVSo now we're ready to scale up.
p183
aVWhat if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?
p184
aVWhat do I need? I need a lot of circles.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd in the 1990s,
p187
aVorigami artists discovered these principles
p188
aVand realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures
p189
aVjust by packing circles.
p190
aVAnd here's where the dead people start to help us out,
p191
aVbecause lots of people have studied
p192
aVthe problem of packing circles.
p193
aVI can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists
p194
aVlooking at disc packings and arrangements.
p195
aVAnd I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.
p196
aVSo we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,
p197
aVyou decorate the patterns of circles with lines
p198
aVaccording to more rules. That gives you the folds.
p199
aVThose folds fold into a base. You shape the base.
p200
aVYou get a folded shape \u2014 in this case, a cockroach.
p201
aVAnd it's so simple.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VIt's so simple that a computer could do it.
p206
aVAnd you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"
p207
aVBut computers \u2014 you need to be able to describe things
p208
aVin very basic terms, and with this, we could.
p209
aVSo I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago
p210
aVcalled TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.
p211
aVIt's free. It runs on all the major platforms \u2014 even Windows.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd you just draw a stick figure,
p216
aVand it calculates the crease pattern.
p217
aVIt does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,
p218
aVand if you use that stick figure that I just showed \u2014
p219
aVwhich you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers \u2014
p220
aVyou'll get this crease pattern.
p221
aVAnd if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,
p222
aVyou'll get a base that you can then shape
p223
aVinto a deer,
p224
aVwith exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.
p225
aVAnd if you want a different deer,
p226
aVnot a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,
p227
aVyou change the packing,
p228
aVand you can do an elk.
p229
aVOr you could do a moose.
p230
aVOr, really, any other kind of deer.
p231
aVThese techniques revolutionized this art.
p232
aVWe found we could do insects,
p233
aVspiders, which are close,
p234
aVthings with legs, things with legs and wings,
p235
aVthings with legs and antennae.
p236
aVAnd if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square
p237
aVwasn't interesting enough,
p238
aVthen you could do two praying mantises
p239
aVfrom a single uncut square.
p240
aVShe's eating him.
p241
aVI call it "Snack Time."
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd you can do more than just insects.
p244
aVThis \u2014 you can put details,
p245
aVtoes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.
p246
aVThis tree frog has toes.
p247
aVActually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.
p248
aVToes have become an origami meme,
p249
aVbecause everyone's doing it.
p250
aVYou can make multiple subjects.
p251
aVSo these are a couple of instrumentalists.
p252
aVThe guitar player from a single square,
p253
aVthe bass player from a single square.
p254
aVAnd if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass \u2014
p255
aVthat's not so hot.
p256
aVDo a little more complicated instrument."
p257
aVWell, then you could do an organ.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd what this has allowed is the creation
p262
aVof origami-on-demand.
p263
aVSo now people can say, "I want exactly this and this and this,"
p264
aVand you can go out and fold it.
p265
aVAnd sometimes you create high art,
p266
aVand sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.
p267
aVBut I want to show you some examples.
p268
aVEverything you'll see here,
p269
aVexcept the car, is origami.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Video)
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)
p274
aa(lp275
VJust to show you, this really was folded paper.
p276
aVComputers made things move,
p277
aVbut these were all real, folded objects that we made.
p278
aVAnd we can use this not just for visuals,
p279
aVbut it turns out to be useful even in the real world.
p280
aVSurprisingly, origami
p281
aVand the structures that we've developed in origami
p282
aVturn out to have applications in medicine, in science,
p283
aVin space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd I want to show you some of these examples.
p286
aVOne of the earliest was this pattern,
p287
aVthis folded pattern,
p288
aVstudied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.
p289
aVHe studied a folding pattern, and realized
p290
aVthis could fold down into an extremely compact package
p291
aVthat had a very simple opening and closing structure.
p292
aVAnd he used it to design this solar array.
p293
aVIt's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope
p294
aVin 1995.
p295
aVNow, there is actually a little origami
p296
aVin the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.
p297
aVThe telescope, going up in space,
p298
aVit unfolds in two places.
p299
aVIt folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern \u2014
p300
aVyou wouldn't even call that origami.
p301
aVThey certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.
p302
aa(lp303
VBut if you want to go higher and go larger than this,
p304
aVthen you might need some origami.
p305
aVEngineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab
p306
aVhad an idea for a telescope much larger.
p307
aVThey called it the Eyeglass.
p308
aVThe design called for geosynchronous orbit
p309
aV25,000 miles up,
p310
aV100-meter diameter lens.
p311
aVSo, imagine a lens the size of a football field.
p312
aVThere were two groups of people who were interested in this:
p313
aVplanetary scientists, who want to look up,
p314
aVand then other people, who wanted to look down.
p315
aVWhether you look up or look down,
p316
aVhow do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.
p317
aVAnd rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.
p318
aVHow do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?
p319
aVWell, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.
p320
aVSo you have to do something like this.
p321
aVThis was a small model.
p322
aa(lp323
VFolded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.
p324
aVBut this pattern's not going to work
p325
aVto get something 100 meters down to a few meters.
p326
aVSo the Livermore engineers,
p327
aVwanting to make use of the work of dead people,
p328
aVor perhaps live origamists, said,
p329
aV"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing."
p330
aVSo they looked into the origami community,
p331
aVwe got in touch with them, and I started working with them.
p332
aVAnd we developed a pattern together
p333
aVthat scales to arbitrarily large size,
p334
aVbut that allows any flat ring or disc
p335
aVto fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.
p336
aVAnd they adopted that for their first generation,
p337
aVwhich was not 100 meters \u2014 it was a five-meter.
p338
aVBut this is a five-meter telescope \u2014
p339
aVhas about a quarter-mile focal length.
p340
aVAnd it works perfectly on its test range,
p341
aVand it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.
p342
aa(lp343
VNow, there is other origami in space.
p344
aVJapan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,
p345
aVand you can see here that the sail expands out,
p346
aVand you can still see the fold lines.
p347
aVThe problem that's being solved here is
p348
aVsomething that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,
p349
aVbut needs to be small for the journey.
p350
aVAnd that works whether you're going into space,
p351
aVor whether you're just going into a body.
p352
aVAnd this example is the latter.
p353
aVThis is a heart stent developed by Zhong You
p354
aVat Oxford University.
p355
aVIt holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,
p356
aVbut it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,
p357
aVthrough your blood vessels.
p358
aVAnd this stent folds down using an origami pattern,
p359
aVbased on a model called the water bomb base.
p360
aa(lp361
VAirbag designers also have the problem
p362
aVof getting flat sheets
p363
aVinto a small space.
p364
aVAnd they want to do their design by simulation.
p365
aVSo they need to figure out how, in a computer,
p366
aVto flatten an airbag.
p367
aVAnd the algorithms that we developed
p368
aVto do insects
p369
aVturned out to be the solution for airbags
p370
aVto do their simulation.
p371
aVAnd so they can do a simulation like this.
p372
aVThose are the origami creases forming,
p373
aVand now you can see the airbag inflate
p374
aVand find out, does it work?
p375
aVAnd that leads
p376
aVto a really interesting idea.
p377
aa(lp378
VYou know, where did these things come from?
p379
aVWell, the heart stent
p380
aVcame from that little blow-up box
p381
aVthat you might have learned in elementary school.
p382
aVIt's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.
p383
aVThe airbag-flattening algorithm
p384
aVcame from all the developments
p385
aVof circle packing and the mathematical theory
p386
aVthat was really developed
p387
aVjust to create insects \u2014 things with legs.
p388
aVThe thing is, that this often happens
p389
aVin math and science.
p390
aVWhen you get math involved, problems that you solve
p391
aVfor aesthetic value only,
p392
aVor to create something beautiful,
p393
aVturn around and turn out
p394
aVto have an application in the real world.
p395
aVAnd as weird and surprising as it may sound,
p396
aVorigami may someday even save a life.
p397
aVThanks.

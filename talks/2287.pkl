p7
aVBlah blah blah, blah.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo what the hell was that?
p10
aVWell, you don't know because you couldn't understand it.
p11
aVIt wasn't clear.
p12
aVBut hopefully, it was said with enough conviction
p13
aVthat it was at least alluringly mysterious.
p14
aa(lp15
VClarity or mystery?
p16
aVI'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer,
p17
aVas well as my daily life as a New Yorker
p18
aVevery day,
p19
aVand there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me.
p20
aa(lp21
VHere's an example.
p22
aVNow, how many people know what this is?
p23
aVOkay. Now how many people know what this is?
p24
aVOkay. Thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius Charles M. Schulz,
p25
aVwe now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves
p26
aVcreate an entire emotional life,
p27
aVone that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans
p28
aVfor over 50 years.
p29
aVThis is actually a cover of a book
p30
aVthat I designed about the work of Schulz and his art,
p31
aVwhich will be coming out this fall,
p32
aVand that is the entire cover.
p33
aVThere is no other typographic information or visual information on the front,
p34
aVand the name of the book is "Only What's Necessary."
p35
aVSo this is sort of symbolic about the decisions I have to make every day
p36
aVabout the design that I'm perceiving,
p37
aVand the design I'm creating.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo clarity.
p40
aVClarity gets to the point.
p41
aVIt's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.
p42
aVWe ask ourselves this. ["When should you be clear?"]
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, something like this, whether we can read it or not,
p45
aVneeds to be really, really clear.
p46
aVIs it?
p47
aa(lp48
VThis is a rather recent example of urban clarity that I just love,
p49
aVmainly because I'm always late and I am always in a hurry.
p50
aVSo when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners,
p51
aVI was thrilled, because now I finally knew
p52
aVhow many seconds I had to get across the street
p53
aVbefore I got run over by a car.
p54
aVSix? I can do that. (Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VSo let's look at the yin to the clarity yang,
p57
aVand that is mystery.
p58
aVMystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition.
p59
aVMystery demands to be decoded,
p60
aVand when it's done right, we really, really want to.
p61
aV["When should you be mysterious?"]
p62
aVIn World War II, the Germans really, really wanted to decode this,
p63
aVand they couldn't.
p64
aa(lp65
VHere's an example of a design that I've done recently
p66
aVfor a novel by Haruki Murakami,
p67
aVwho I've done design work for for over 20 years now,
p68
aVand this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends
p69
aVwho all of a sudden, after their freshman year of college,
p70
aVcompletely cut him off with no explanation,
p71
aVand he is devastated.
p72
aVAnd the friends' names each have a connotation in Japanese to a color.
p73
aVSo there's Mr. Red, there's Mr. Blue, there's Ms. White, and Ms. Black.
p74
aVTsukuru Tazaki, his name does not correspond to a color,
p75
aVso his nickname is Colorless, and as he's looking back on their friendship,
p76
aVhe recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand.
p77
aVSo I created this sort of abstract representation of this,
p78
aVbut there's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story,
p79
aVand there's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket.
p80
aVThe four fingers are now four train lines
p81
aVin the Tokyo subway system,
p82
aVwhich has significance within the story.
p83
aVAnd then you have the colorless subway line
p84
aVintersecting with each of the other colors,
p85
aVwhich basically he does later on in the story.
p86
aVHe catches up with each of these people
p87
aVto find out why they treated him the way they did.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd so this is the three-dimensional finished product
p90
aVsitting on my desk in my office,
p91
aVand what I was hoping for here is that you'll simply be allured
p92
aVby the mystery of what this looks like,
p93
aVand will want to read it
p94
aVto decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does.
p95
aa(lp96
V["The Visual Vernacular."]
p97
aa(lp98
VThis is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery.
p99
aVWhat does this mean?
p100
aVThis is what it means. ["Make it look like something else."]
p101
aVThe visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing
p102
aVapplied to something else so that we see it in a different way.
p103
aa(lp104
VThis is an approach I wanted to take to a book of essays by David Sedaris
p105
aVthat had this title at the time. ["All the Beauty You Will Ever Need"]
p106
aVNow, the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing.
p107
aVIt's not connected to any of the essays in the book.
p108
aVIt came to the author's boyfriend in a dream.
p109
aVThank you very much, so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 so usually, I am creating a design
p110
aVthat is in some way based on the text, but this is all the text there is.
p111
aVSo you've got this mysterious title that really doesn't mean anything,
p112
aVso I was trying to think:
p113
aVWhere might I see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn't?
p114
aVAnd sure enough, not long after,
p115
aVone evening after a Chinese meal,
p116
aVthis arrived, and I thought, "Ah, bing, ideagasm!" (Laughter)
p117
aVI've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes of fortune cookies
p118
aVthat seem to mean something extremely deep
p119
aVbut when you think about them \u2014 if you think about them \u2014 they really don't.
p120
aVThis says, "Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future."
p121
aVThank you. (Laughter)
p122
aVBut we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to Mr. Sedaris,
p123
aVand we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look
p124
aVthat we don't even need the bits of the cookie anymore.
p125
aVWe're just seeing this strange thing
p126
aVand we know we love David Sedaris,
p127
aVand so we're hoping that we're in for a good time.
p128
aa(lp129
V["'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff"] David Rakoff was a wonderful writer
p130
aVand he called his first book "Fraud"
p131
aVbecause he was getting sent on assignments by magazines
p132
aVto do things that he was not equipped to do.
p133
aVSo he was this skinny little urban guy
p134
aVand GQ magazine would send him down the Colorado River
p135
aVwhitewater rafting to see if he would survive.
p136
aVAnd then he would write about it, and he felt that he was a fraud
p137
aVand that he was misrepresenting himself.
p138
aVAnd so I wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself
p139
aVand then somehow show a reader reacting to it.
p140
aa(lp141
VThis led me to graffiti.
p142
aVI'm fascinated by graffiti.
p143
aVI think anybody who lives in an urban environment
p144
aVencounters graffiti all the time, and there's all different sorts of it.
p145
aVThis is a picture I took on the Lower East Side
p146
aVof just a transformer box on the sidewalk
p147
aVand it's been tagged like crazy.
p148
aVNow whether you look at this and think, "Oh, that's a charming urban affectation,"
p149
aVor you look at it and say, "That's illegal abuse of property,"
p150
aVthe one thing I think we can all agree on
p151
aVis that you cannot read it.
p152
aVRight? There is no clear message here.
p153
aVThere is another kind of graffiti that I find far more interesting,
p154
aVwhich I call editorial graffiti.
p155
aVThis is a picture I took recently in the subway,
p156
aVand sometimes you see lots of prurient, stupid stuff,
p157
aVbut I thought this was interesting, and this is a poster that is saying
p158
aVrah-rah Airbnb,
p159
aVand someone has taken a Magic Marker
p160
aVand has editorialized about what they think about it.
p161
aVAnd it got my attention.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo I was thinking, how do we apply this to this book?
p164
aVSo I get the book by this person, and I start reading it, and I'm thinking,
p165
aVthis guy is not who he says  he is; he's a fraud.
p166
aVAnd I get out a red Magic Marker,
p167
aVand out of frustration just scribble this across the front.
p168
aVDesign done. (Laughter)
p169
aVAnd they went for it! (Laughter)
p170
aVAuthor liked it, publisher liked it,
p171
aVand that is how the book went out into the world,
p172
aVand it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway
p173
aVand walking around with it and what have you,
p174
aVand they all sort of looked like they were crazy.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
V["'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy"] Okay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer,
p178
aVa good friend, I've worked with him for many years.
p179
aVHe is probably best known as the author
p180
aVof "The Black Dahlia" and "L.A. Confidential."
p181
aVHis most recent novel was called this, which is a very mysterious name
p182
aVthat I'm sure a lot of people know what it means, but a lot of people don't.
p183
aVAnd it's a story about a Japanese-American detective in Los Angeles in 1941
p184
aVinvestigating a murder.
p185
aVAnd then Pearl Harbor happens,
p186
aVand as if his life wasn't difficult enough,
p187
aVnow the race relations have really ratcheted up,
p188
aVand then the Japanese-American internment camps are quickly created,
p189
aVand there's lots of tension
p190
aVand horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder.
p191
aVAnd so I did at first think very literally about this in terms of
p192
aVall right, we'll take Pearl Harbor and we'll add it to Los Angeles
p193
aVand we'll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city.
p194
aVAnd so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor
p195
aVjust grafted onto Los Angeles.
p196
aVMy editor in chief said, "You know, it's interesting
p197
aVbut I think you can do better and I think you can make it simpler."
p198
aVAnd so I went back to the drawing board, as I often do.
p199
aVBut also, being alive to my surroundings,
p200
aVI work in a high-rise in Midtown,
p201
aVand every night, before I leave the office,
p202
aVI have to push this button to get out,
p203
aVand the big heavy glass doors open and I can get onto the elevator.
p204
aVAnd one night, all of a sudden,
p205
aVI looked at this and I saw it in a way that I hadn't really noticed it before.
p206
aVBig red circle, danger.
p207
aVAnd I thought this was so obvious
p208
aVthat it had to have been done a zillion times,
p209
aVand so I did a Google image search, and I couldn't find another book cover
p210
aVthat looked quite like this,
p211
aVand so this is really what solved the problem,
p212
aVand graphically it's more interesting
p213
aVand creates a bigger tension between the idea
p214
aVof a certain kind of sunrise coming up over L.A. and America.
p215
aa(lp216
V["'Gulp' A tour of the human digestive system by Mary Roach."]
p217
aa(lp218
VMary Roach is an amazing writer
p219
aVwho takes potentially mundane scientific subjects
p220
aVand makes them not mundane at all; she makes them really fun.
p221
aVSo in this particular case,
p222
aVit's about the human digestive system.
p223
aVSo I'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be.
p224
aVThis is a self-portrait. (Laughter)
p225
aVEvery morning I look at myself in the medicine cabinet mirror
p226
aVto see if my tongue is black.
p227
aVAnd if it's not, I'm good to go.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVI recommend you all do this.
p230
aVBut I also started thinking, here's our introduction.
p231
aVRight? Into the human digestive system.
p232
aVBut I think what we can all agree on
p233
aVis that actual photographs of human mouths, at least based on this,
p234
aVare off-putting. (Laughter)
p235
aVSo for the cover, then, I had this illustration done
p236
aVwhich is literally more palatable
p237
aVand reminds us that it's best to approach the digestive system
p238
aVfrom this end.
p239
aV(Laughter)
p240
aVI don't even have to complete the sentence. All right.
p241
aa(lp242
V["Unuseful mystery"]
p243
aVWhat happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up?
p244
aVAnd we see this all the time.
p245
aVThis is what I call unuseful mystery.
p246
aVI go down into the subway \u2014 I take the subway a lot \u2014
p247
aVand this piece of paper is taped to a girder.
p248
aVRight? And now I'm thinking, uh-oh,
p249
aVand the train's about to come and I'm trying to figure out what this means,
p250
aVand thanks a lot.
p251
aVPart of the problem here is that they've compartmentalized the information
p252
aVin a way they think is helpful, and frankly, I don't think it is at all.
p253
aVSo this is mystery we do not need.
p254
aVWhat we need is useful clarity, so just for fun, I redesigned this.
p255
aVThis is using all the same elements.
p256
aV(Applause)
p257
aVThank you. I am still waiting for a call from the MTA. (Laughter)
p258
aVYou know, I'm actually not even using more colors than they use.
p259
aVThey just didn't even bother to make the 4 and the 5 green,
p260
aVthose idiots. (Laughter)
p261
aVSo the first thing we see is that there is a service change,
p262
aVand then, in two complete sentences with a beginning, a middle and an end,
p263
aVit tells us what the change is and what's going to be happening.
p264
aVCall me crazy! (Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
V["Useful mystery"] All right.
p267
aVNow, here is a piece of mystery that I love:
p268
aVpackaging.
p269
aVThis redesign of the Diet Coke can
p270
aVby Turner Duckworth is to me truly a piece of art.
p271
aVIt's a work of art. It's beautiful.
p272
aVBut part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer
p273
aVis that he's taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke \u2014
p274
aVthe typefaces, the colors, the silver background \u2014
p275
aVand he's reduced them to their most essential parts,
p276
aVso it's like going back to the Charlie Brown face.
p277
aVIt's like, how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is
p278
aVbut giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have
p279
aVabout this thing?
p280
aVIt looks great, and you would go into a delicatessen
p281
aVand all of a sudden see that on the shelf, and it's wonderful.
p282
aVWhich makes the next thing \u2014
p283
aV["Unuseful clarity"] \u2014 all the more disheartening,
p284
aVat least to me.
p285
aVSo okay, again, going back down into the subway,
p286
aVafter this came out,
p287
aVthese are pictures that I took.
p288
aVTimes Square subway station:
p289
aVCoca-Cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising. Okay?
p290
aVAnd maybe some of you know where this is going.
p291
aVAhem.
p292
aa(lp293
V"You moved to New York with the clothes on your back,
p294
aVthe cash in your pocket, and your eyes on the prize.
p295
aVYou're on Coke." (Laughter)
p296
aV"You moved to New York with an MBA, one clean suit,
p297
aVand an extremely firm handshake.
p298
aVYou're on Coke." (Laughter)
p299
aVThese are real! (Laughter)
p300
aVNot even the support beams were spared,
p301
aVexcept they switched into Yoda mode. (Laughter)
p302
aV"Coke you're on." (Laughter)
p303
aV["Excuse me, I'm on WHAT??"]
p304
aVThis campaign was a huge misstep.
p305
aVIt was pulled almost instantly due to consumer backlash
p306
aVand all sorts of unflattering parodies on the web \u2014
p307
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p308
aVand also that dot next to "You're on," that's not a period, that's a trademark.
p309
aVSo thanks a lot.
p310
aa(lp311
VSo to me, this was just so bizarre
p312
aVabout how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect
p313
aVand the message so unbearably, clearly wrong.
p314
aVIt was just incredible to me.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo I just hope that I've been able to share with you some of my insights
p317
aVon the uses of clarity and mystery in my work,
p318
aVand maybe how you might decide to be more clear in your life,
p319
aVor maybe to be a bit more mysterious and not so over-sharing.
p320
aV(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd if there's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk,
p323
aVI hope it's this:
p324
aVBlih blih blih blah. Blah blah blih blih. ["'Judge This,' Chip Kidd"]
p325
aVBlih blih blah blah blah. Blah blah blah.
p326
aa(lp327
VBlah blah.

VA public, Dewey long ago observed,
p5
aVis constituted through discussion and debate.
p6
aVIf we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question,
p7
aVand avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned,
p8
aVthen we must be willing to subject our own assumptions
p9
aVto debate and discussion.
p10
aVIt is in this spirit that I join into a discussion
p11
aVof one of the critical issues of our time,
p12
aVnamely, how to mobilize different forms of capital
p13
aVfor the project of state building.
p14
aa(lp15
VTo put the assumptions very clearly:
p16
aVcapitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable,
p17
aVand so has democracy.
p18
aVIf we looked in the world of 1945
p19
aVand looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities,
p20
aVthey were the rare exception, not the norm.
p21
aVThe question now, however,
p22
aVis both about which form of capitalism
p23
aVand which type of democratic participation.
p24
aVBut we must acknowledge
p25
aVthat this moment has brought about
p26
aVa rare consensus of assumptions.
p27
aVAnd that provides the ground
p28
aVfor a type of action,
p29
aVbecause consensus of each moment
p30
aVallows us to act.
p31
aVAnd it is necessary, no matter how fragile
p32
aVor how provisional our consensus,
p33
aVto be able to move forward.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut the majority of the world
p36
aVneither benefits from capitalism
p37
aVnor from democratic systems.
p38
aVMost of the globe
p39
aVexperiences the state as repressive,
p40
aVas an organization that is concerned
p41
aVabout denial of rights,
p42
aVabout denial of justice,
p43
aVrather than provision of it.
p44
aVAnd in terms of experience of capitalism,
p45
aVthere are two aspects
p46
aVthat the rest of the globe experiences.
p47
aVFirst, extractive industry.
p48
aVBlood diamonds, smuggled emeralds,
p49
aVtimber,
p50
aVthat is cut right from under the poorest.
p51
aVSecond is technical assistance.
p52
aVAnd technical assistance might shock you,
p53
aVbut it's the worst form
p54
aVof \u2014 today \u2014 of the ugly face
p55
aVof the developed world to the developing countries.
p56
aVTens of billions of dollars
p57
aVare supposedly spent on building capacity
p58
aVwith people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day,
p59
aVwho are incapable
p60
aVof thinking creatively,
p61
aVor organically.
p62
aa(lp63
VNext assumption \u2014
p64
aVand of course the events of July 7,
p65
aVI express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 \u2014
p66
aVhave reminded us
p67
aVwe do not live in three different worlds.
p68
aVWe live in one world.
p69
aVBut that's easily said.
p70
aVBut we are not dealing with the implications
p71
aVof the one world that we are living in.
p72
aVAnd that is that if we want to have one world,
p73
aVthis one world cannot be based
p74
aVon huge pockets of exclusion,
p75
aVand then inclusion for some.
p76
aVWe must now finally come
p77
aVto think about the premises
p78
aVof a truly global world,
p79
aVin relationship to the regime of rights
p80
aVand responsibilities and accountabilities
p81
aVthat are truly global in scope.
p82
aVOtherwise we will be missing
p83
aVthis open moment in history,
p84
aVwhere we have a consensus
p85
aVon both the form of politics
p86
aVand the form of economics.
p87
aa(lp88
VWhat is one of these organizations to pick?
p89
aVWe have three critical terms:
p90
aVeconomy,
p91
aVcivil society
p92
aVand the state.
p93
aVI will not deal with those first two, except to say
p94
aVthat uncritical transfer of assumptions,
p95
aVfrom one context to another,
p96
aVcan only make for disaster.
p97
aVEconomics
p98
aVtaught in most of the elite universities
p99
aVare practically useless in my context.
p100
aVMy country is dominated
p101
aVby drug economy and a mafia.
p102
aVTextbook economics does not work in my context,
p103
aVand I have very few recommendations from anybody
p104
aVas to how to put together a legal economy.
p105
aVThe poverty of our knowledge
p106
aVmust become the first basis
p107
aVof moving forward,
p108
aVand not imposition of the framework
p109
aVthat works on the basis of mathematical modeling,
p110
aVfor which I have enormous respect.
p111
aVMy colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.
p112
aa(lp113
VSecond,
p114
aVinstead of debating endlessly
p115
aVabout what is the structure of the state,
p116
aVwhy don't we simplify
p117
aVand say, what are a series of functions
p118
aVthat the state in the 21st century must perform?
p119
aVClare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this;
p120
aVwe hope to share that much widely with \u2014
p121
aVand third is that we could actually construct an index
p122
aVto measure comparatively
p123
aVhow well these functions that we would agree on
p124
aVare being performed in different places.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo what are these functions?
p127
aVWe propose 10.
p128
aVAnd it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence,
p129
aVadministrative control, management of public finances,
p130
aVinvestment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights,
p131
aVprovision of infrastructure,
p132
aVmanagement of the tangible and intangible assets of the state
p133
aVthrough regulation, creation of the market,
p134
aVinternational agreements, including public borrowing,
p135
aVand then, most importantly, rule of law.
p136
aa(lp137
VI won't elaborate.
p138
aVI hope the questions will give me an opportunity.
p139
aVThis is a feasible goal,
p140
aVbasically because, contrary to widespread assumption,
p141
aVI would argue that we know how to do this.
p142
aVWho would have imagined that Germany
p143
aVwould be either united or democratic today,
p144
aVif you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?
p145
aVBut people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany
p146
aVand engaged in planning.
p147
aVAnd there are lots of other examples.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow in order to do this \u2014 and this brings this group \u2014
p150
aVwe have to rethink the notion of capital.
p151
aVThe least important form of capital, in this project,
p152
aVis financial capital \u2014 money.
p153
aVMoney is not capital in most of the developing countries.
p154
aVIt's just cash.
p155
aVBecause it lacks the institutional,
p156
aVorganizational, managerial forms
p157
aVto turn it into capital.
p158
aVAnd what is required
p159
aVis a combination of physical capital,
p160
aVinstitutional capital, human capital \u2014
p161
aVand security, of course, is critical,
p162
aVbut so is information.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, the issue that should concern us here \u2014
p165
aVand that's the challenge
p166
aVthat I would like to pose to this group \u2014
p167
aVis again, it takes 16 years
p168
aVin your countries
p169
aVto produce somebody with a B.S. degree.
p170
aVIt takes 20 years
p171
aVto produce somebody with a Ph.D.
p172
aVThe first challenge is to rethink,
p173
aVfundamentally,
p174
aVthe issue of the time.
p175
aVDo we need to repeat
p176
aVthe modalities that we have inherited?
p177
aVOur educational systems are inherited from the 19th century.
p178
aVWhat is it that we need to do fundamentally
p179
aVto re-engage in a project,
p180
aVthat capital formation is rapid?
p181
aVThe absolute majority of the world's population
p182
aVare below 20,
p183
aVand they are growing larger and faster.
p184
aVThey need different ways
p185
aVof being approached,
p186
aVdifferent ways of being enfranchised,
p187
aVdifferent ways of being skilled.
p188
aVAnd that's the first thing.
p189
aa(lp190
VSecond is, you're problem solvers,
p191
aVbut you're not engaging your global responsibility.
p192
aVYou've stayed away
p193
aVfrom the problems of corruption.
p194
aVYou only want clean environments in which to function.
p195
aVBut if you don't think through the problems of corruption,
p196
aVwho will?
p197
aVYou stay away from design for development.
p198
aVYou're great designers,
p199
aVbut your designs are selfish.
p200
aVIt's for your own immediate use.
p201
aVThe world in which I operate
p202
aVoperates with designs
p203
aVregarding roads, or dams,
p204
aVor provision of electricity
p205
aVthat have not been revisited in 60 years.
p206
aVThis is not right. It requires thinking.
p207
aa(lp208
VBut, particularly, what we need
p209
aVmore than anything else from this group
p210
aVis your imagination
p211
aVto be brought to bear on problems
p212
aVthe way a meme is supposed to work.
p213
aVAs the work on paradigms, long time ago showed \u2014
p214
aVThomas Kuhn's work \u2014
p215
aVit's in the intersection of ideas
p216
aVthat new developments \u2014
p217
aVtrue breakthroughs \u2014 occur.
p218
aVAnd I hope that this group
p219
aVwould be able to deal with the issue of state and development
p220
aVand the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor,
p221
aVthrough this means.
p222
aVThank you.
p223
aV(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VChris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently,
p226
aVyou were the finance minister of Afghanistan,
p227
aVa country right at the middle
p228
aVof much of the world's agenda.
p229
aVIs the country gonna make it?
p230
aVWill democracy flourish? What scares you most?
p231
aa(lp232
VAshraf Ghani: What scares me most is \u2014 is you,
p233
aVlack of your engagement.
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVYou asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer.
p236
aVNo. But seriously,
p237
aVthe issue of Afghanistan
p238
aVfirst has to be seen as,
p239
aVat least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.
p240
aVToday the world of globalization
p241
aVis on speed.
p242
aVTime has been compressed.
p243
aVAnd space does not exist for most people.
p244
aVBut in my world \u2014
p245
aVyou know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years,
p246
aVspace had expanded.
p247
aVEvery conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.
p248
aVI rode \u2014 traveled \u2014
p249
aVtravel between two cities that used to take three hours
p250
aVnow took 12.
p251
aVSo the first is when the scale is that,
p252
aVwe need to recognize
p253
aVthat just the simple things that are infrastructure \u2014
p254
aVit takes six years to deliver infrastructure.
p255
aVIn our world.
p256
aVAny meaningful sort of thing.
p257
aVBut the modality of attention,
p258
aVor what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.
p259
aa(lp260
VSecond is,
p261
aVwhen a country has been subjected
p262
aVto one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power \u2014
p263
aVwe had the Red Army
p264
aVfor 10 continuous years,
p265
aV110,000 strong,
p266
aVliterally terrorizing.
p267
aVThe sky:
p268
aVevery Afghan
p269
aVsees the sky as a source of fear.
p270
aVWe were bombed
p271
aVpractically out of existence.
p272
aVThen, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism \u2014
p273
aVfrom all sides.
p274
aVThe United States, Great Britain, joined for instance,
p275
aVEgyptian intelligence service
p276
aVto train thousands of people
p277
aVin resistance and urban terrorism.
p278
aVHow to turn a bicycle
p279
aVinto an instrument of terror.
p280
aVHow to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything.
p281
aVAnd the Russians, equally.
p282
aVSo, when violence erupts
p283
aVin a country like Afghanistan,
p284
aVit's because of that legacy.
p285
aVBut we have to understand
p286
aVthat we've been incredibly lucky.
p287
aVI mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here,
p288
aVstanding in front of you, speaking.
p289
aVWhen I joined as finance minister,
p290
aVI thought that the chances of my living more than three years
p291
aVwould not be more than five percent.
p292
aVThose were the risks. They were worth it.
p293
aa(lp294
VI think we can make it,
p295
aVand the reason we can make it
p296
aVis because of the people.
p297
aVYou see, because, I mean \u2014 I give you one statistic.
p298
aV91 percent of the men in Afghanistan,
p299
aV86 percent of the women,
p300
aVlisten to at least three radio stations a day.
p301
aVIn terms of their discourse,
p302
aVin terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world,
p303
aVI think that I would dare say,
p304
aVthey're much more sophisticated
p305
aVthan rural Americans with college degrees
p306
aVand the bulk of Europeans \u2014
p307
aVbecause the world matters to them.
p308
aVAnd what is their predominant concern?
p309
aVAbandonment.
p310
aVAfghans have become deeply internationalist.
p311
aa(lp312
VYou know, when I went back in December of 2001,
p313
aVI had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government
p314
aVbecause I'd lived as a nationalist.
p315
aVAnd I told them \u2014 my people, with the Americans here \u2014
p316
aVseparate.
p317
aVYes, I have an advisory position with the U.N.
p318
aVI went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly.
p319
aVAnd everybody was telling me it was a different world.
p320
aVYou know, they engage.
p321
aVThey see engagement, global engagement,
p322
aVas absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.
p323
aVAnd the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is \u2014
p324
aVClare Lockhart is here,
p325
aVso I'll recite a discussion she had
p326
aVwith an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan.
p327
aVAnd that woman said she didn't care
p328
aVwhether she had food on her table.
p329
aVWhat she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future,
p330
aVwhere her children could really have a different life.
p331
aVThat gives me hope.
p332
aVCA: How is Afghanistan
p333
aVgoing to provide alternative income
p334
aVto the many people
p335
aVwho are making their living off the drugs trade?
p336
aa(lp337
VAG: Certainly. Well, the first is,
p338
aVinstead of sending a billion dollars
p339
aVon drug eradication
p340
aVand paying it to a couple of security companies,
p341
aVthey should give this hundred billion dollars
p342
aVto 50
p343
aVof the most critically innovative companies in the world
p344
aVto ask them to create one million jobs.
p345
aVThe key to the drug eradication is jobs.
p346
aVLook, there's a very little known fact:
p347
aVcountries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars
p348
aVdon't produce drugs.
p349
aa(lp350
VSecond, textile.
p351
aVTrade is the key, not aid.
p352
aVThe U.S. and Europe
p353
aVshould give us a zero percent tariff.
p354
aVThe textile industry is incredibly mobile.
p355
aVIf you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment,
p356
aVwe could probably attract
p357
aVfour to six billion dollars
p358
aVquite easily in the textile sector,
p359
aVif there was zero tariffs \u2014
p360
aVwould create the type of job.
p361
aVCotton does not compete with opium;
p362
aVa t-shirt does.
p363
aVAnd we need to understand, it's the value chain.
p364
aVLook, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired
p365
aVof hearing about microcredit.
p366
aVIt is important,
p367
aVbut what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want
p368
aVis global access.
p369
aVThey don't want to sell to the charity bazaars
p370
aVthat are only for foreigners \u2014
p371
aVand the same bloody shirt
p372
aVembroidered time and again.
p373
aVWhat we want is a partnership
p374
aVwith the Italian design firms.
p375
aVYeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world!
p376
aVWhy can't we do what was done with northern Italy?
p377
aVWith the Put Out system?
p378
aVSo I think economically,
p379
aVthe critical issue really is to now think through.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.
p382
aVYou know, the aid system is broken.
p383
aVThe aid system does not have the knowledge,
p384
aVthe vision, the ability.
p385
aVI'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.
p386
aVYeah, to be exact, you know,
p387
aVI managed to persuade the world that
p388
aVthey had to give my country 27.5 billion.
p389
aVThey didn't want to give us the money.
p390
aa(lp391
VCA: And it still didn't work?
p392
aa(lp393
VAG: No. It's not that it didn't work.
p394
aVIt's that a dollar of private investment,
p395
aVin my judgment,
p396
aVis equal at least to 20 dollars of aid,
p397
aVin terms of the dynamic that it generates.
p398
aVSecond is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents;
p399
aVit could be 20 cents;
p400
aVor it could be four dollars.
p401
aVIt depends on what form it comes,
p402
aVwhat degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.
p403
aVYou know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit
p404
aVentrepreneurs of the developed countries,
p405
aVnot to generate growth in the poor countries.
p406
aVAnd this is, again, one of those assumptions \u2014
p407
aVthe way car seats are an assumption
p408
aVthat we've inherited in governments, and doors.
p409
aVYou would think that the US government
p410
aVwould not think that American firms needed subsidizing
p411
aVto function in developing countries, provide advice,
p412
aVbut they do.
p413
aVThere's an entire weight of history
p414
aVvis-a-vis aid
p415
aVthat now needs to be reexamined.
p416
aVIf the goal is to build states
p417
aVthat can credibly take care of themselves \u2014
p418
aVand I'm putting that proposition equally;
p419
aVyou know I'm very harsh on my counterparts \u2014
p420
aVaid must end
p421
aVin each country in a definable period.
p422
aVAnd every year there must be progress
p423
aVon mobilization of domestic revenue
p424
aVand generation of the economy.
p425
aVUnless that kind of compact is entered into,
p426
aVyou will not be able to sustain the consensus.

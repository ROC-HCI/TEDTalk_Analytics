VI'm a, or was, or kind of am a toy designer.
p5
aVAnd before I was a toy designer, oh, I was a mime, a street mime, actually.
p6
aVAnd then I was an entertainer, I guess.
p7
aVAnd before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was \u2014
p8
aVI was out of the house at about 15 and a half,
p9
aVand I never wound up going into college.
p10
aVI didn't really \u2014 I didn't see the point at the time.
p11
aVI do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aVIt's really cool.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnyway, I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design,
p17
aVat least from my small aperture of the world.
p18
aVThis is a video I made when I first started doing toy design.
p19
aVI'm in my garage, making weird stuff.
p20
aVAnd then you go to these toy companies
p21
aVand there's some guy across the table,
p22
aVand he goes, "Pass. Pass. Pass."
p23
aVYou know, you think it's so cool, but they \u2014
p24
aVanyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in.
p25
aVThis is the name of my company, Giving Toys.
p26
aVSo I used to work at Mattel, actually.
p27
aVAnd after I left Mattel, I started all these hamburger makers,
p28
aVand then got the license to make the maker.
p29
aVSo this is a hamburger maker that
p30
aVyou take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there, and it makes \u2014
p31
aVand this is a French fry maker, little, tiny food you can eat.
p32
aVI beat up the pasta maker to make that.
p33
aVThen this is a McNugget maker, I think.
p34
aVThis, now that's the McNugget maker,
p35
aVand this is a \u2014 this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie.
p36
aVAnd let's see, you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar,
p37
aVand then you eat, and you eat, and you eat, and you \u2014
p38
aVshe's about 300 pounds now.
p39
aVNo, she's not, she's beautiful.
p40
aVThis is how they looked when they came out at the end.
p41
aVThese are a \u2014 this is like a 15 million dollar line.
p42
aVAnd it got me through some \u2014 I didn't make any royalties on this, but it got me through.
p43
aa(lp44
VNext is a compilation of a bunch of stuff.
p45
aVThat was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold.
p46
aVThis is a squishy head, for no apparent reason.
p47
aVThis is some effects that I did for "Wig, Rattle and Roll."
p48
aVThat was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back.
p49
aVThat paid the rent for about a month.
p50
aVThis is a walking Barbie \u2014 I said, "Oh, this is it!"
p51
aVAnd they go, "Oh, that's really nice," and out it goes.
p52
aVSo this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these.
p53
aVThey fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool?
p54
aVAnd they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock.
p55
aVThey're pretty cool.
p56
aVThis is a\u2014 we're doing some flight-testing
p57
aVon my little pug, seeing if this can really grab.
p58
aVIt does pretty good.
p59
aVI'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin.
p60
aVIt's how they, see, have those album things \u2014 kids don't know what they are.
p61
aVThis is a clay maker.
p62
aVYou know, I said \u2014 I went to Play-Doh,
p63
aVand said, "Look, I can animate this."
p64
aVThey said, "Don't talk to us about Play-Doh."
p65
aVAnd then, I made a Lego animator.
p66
aVI thought, this would be so great!
p67
aVAnd you know, Lego \u2014 don't take Legos to Lego.
p68
aVThat's the answer. They know everything about it.
p69
aa(lp70
VThen I started doing animatronics.
p71
aVI loved dinosaurs.
p72
aVI used to be in the film business, kind of,
p73
aVand actually, Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was, like, 12,
p74
aVand anyway, so then they said, "No, you have to make two and they have to fight."
p75
aVYou know, how \u2014 why would a kid want a dinosaur?
p76
aVThis is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio, back in the '80s.
p77
aVThat's David Letterman.
p78
aVYou can see how old this stuff is.
p79
aVThat's my youngest cousin.
p80
aVThis is a segment called, "Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas."
p81
aVWe had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair.
p82
aVMy career basically peaked here.
p83
aVAnd in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show.
p84
aVThis is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor.
p85
aVSo this is a \u2014 I used to kind of be an actor.
p86
aVAnd I'm really not very good at it.
p87
aVBut the \u2014 this is a guy named Dr. Yatz,
p88
aVwho would take toys apart and show kids about engineering.
p89
aVAnd you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.
p90
aVAnd over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM.
p91
aVAnd a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot.
p92
aVThis is a \u2014 you can see the little window there.
p93
aVYou can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.
p94
aVYou see the keyboard strapped to my wrist.
p95
aVWay ahead of my time here.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Video) I'm getting dizzy ...
p98
aVNarrator: I love toys!
p99
aa(lp100
VCaleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys.
p101
aVOK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a \u2014
p102
aVthat was the first batch of products.
p103
aVMost of them did not go.
p104
aVYou get one out of 20, one out of 30 products.
p105
aVAnd every now and then, we do something like a,
p106
aVyou know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know,
p107
aVthat tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and \u2014
p108
aVand we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out.
p109
aVBut eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho,
p110
aVwhere there was actually a lot of peace and quiet.
p111
aVAnd I started working on this project
p112
aV\u2014 oh, I have to tell you about this real quick.
p113
aVThroughout this whole thing, making toys,
p114
aVI think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science.
p115
aVThere's some kind of a blend that happens
p116
aVthat allows, you know, to find innovation.
p117
aVAnd I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol
p118
aVthat means something, to me anyway.
p119
aVAnd so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance,
p120
aVthat's where I think innovation happens.
p121
aVAnd actually, this is, to me, how I can come up with great ideas.
p122
aVBut it's not how you actually get leverage.
p123
aVActually, you have to put a circle around that, and call it business.
p124
aVAnd those three together, I think, give you leverage in the world.
p125
aVBut moving on.
p126
aVSo, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale.
p127
aVAs he said, I was co-inventor of the Furby.
p128
aVI did the body and creature \u2014 well, you'll see.
p129
aVSo by way of showing you this, you can kind of
p130
aVget an understanding of what it is to,
p131
aVhopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technology
p132
aVthat has an emotional connection with the user.
p133
aVSo this is my family.
p134
aVThis is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa,
p135
aVand my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble.
p136
aVAll right, there's that robot again.
p137
aVI came out of the movie business, as I said,
p138
aVand I said, let's make these animatronic robots.
p139
aVLet's make these things.
p140
aVAnd so I've always had a big interest in this.
p141
aVThis one actually didn't go anywhere,
p142
aVbut I got my feet wet doing this.
p143
aVThis is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there.
p144
aVA little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives,
p145
aVlots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff.
p146
aVThere's another one.
p147
aVHe actually has skeletor legs, I think, he's wearing there.
p148
aVOh, this is a little pony, little pony \u2014 very cute little thing.
p149
aa(lp150
VThe point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces.
p151
aVSo the challenge was \u2014 I worked for Microsoft for a little bit,
p152
aVworking on the Microsoft Barney.
p153
aVAnd this is a \u2014 you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear.
p154
aVAnd, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought.
p155
aVAnd then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse
p156
aVfull of this stuff and see if they sell.
p157
aVSo it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company.
p158
aVBut anyway, a friend of mine and I, Dave Hampton,
p159
aVdecided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism.
p160
aVWhat's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form?
p161
aVAnd that's our little, thirty-cent Mabuchi motor.
p162
aVAnd so, I have all these design books,
p163
aVlike I'm sure many of you have.
p164
aVAnd throughout the books \u2014 this is the first page on Furby \u2014
p165
aVI have kind of the art and science.
p166
aVI have the why over here, and the how over there.
p167
aVI try to do a lot of philosophy, a lot of thinking about all of these projects.
p168
aVBecause they're not just "bing" ideas;
p169
aVyou have to really dig deep in these things.
p170
aVSo there's some real pseudo-code over here,
p171
aVand getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that.
p172
aVAnd originally, Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom.
p173
aVAnd then we said, well, you're going to feed him,
p174
aVand he needs to talk, and it got more complicated.
p175
aVAnd then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor
p176
aVto make the eyes move, and the ears move,
p177
aVand the body to move, and the mouth to move.
p178
aVAnd, you know, I want to make it blink
p179
aVand do all that at the same time.
p180
aVWell, I came up with this kind of linear
p181
aVexpression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well.
p182
aVThen I started to get a little more realistic
p183
aVand I have to start drawing the stuff.
p184
aVAnd there's my "note to self" at the top:
p185
aV"lots of engineering."
p186
aVSo that turned out to be a little more than true.
p187
aVThere's my first exploded view and all the little pieces
p188
aVand the little worm drive and all that stuff.
p189
aVAnd then I've got to start building it,
p190
aVso this is the real thing.
p191
aVI get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together.
p192
aVAnd that's my little workshop.
p193
aVAnd there's the first little cam that drove Furby.
p194
aVAnd there's Furby on the half shell.
p195
aVYou can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor.
p196
aVI just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic.
p197
aVSo there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it.
p198
aVAnd there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.
p199
aVNo, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVSo right now, you see, I love little robots.
p202
aVSo my wife says, "Well, you may like it, but nobody else will."
p203
aVSo she comes to the rescue.
p204
aVThis is my wife Christi, who is just, you know,
p205
aVmy muse and my partner for eternity here.
p206
aVAnd she does drawings, right?
p207
aVShe's an actual, you know, artist.
p208
aVAnd she starts doing all these different drawings
p209
aVand does color patterns and coloring books.
p210
aVAnd I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there.
p211
aVHe didn't test so well, but I like him.
p212
aVAnd then she started doing these other images.
p213
aVAt that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit,
p214
aVand we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones.
p215
aVSo here's a little pink one, a little pouf on his head.
p216
aVAnd here's \u2014 this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why.
p217
aVThere's my favorite, Demon Furby.
p218
aVThat was a good one.
p219
aVAnyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look,
p220
aVlittle poufy body, a little imaginary character.
p221
aVAnd there he is, a little bush baby on \u2014 caught in the headlights there.
p222
aVI actually went to Toys"R"Us, got a little furry cat,
p223
aVripped it apart and made this.
p224
aVAnd since then, every time I come home from Toys"R"Us
p225
aVwith dolls or something, they disappear from my desk
p226
aVand they get hidden in the house.
p227
aVI have three girls and they just, they \u2014
p228
aVit's like a rescue animal thing they're going there.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVSo, a little tether coming off,
p231
aVit's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes.
p232
aVIt's just a little server control and I made a little video going:
p233
aV"Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good,"
p234
aVyou know, and then I'd reach my hand.
p235
aVHe'd \u2014 you can tickle him. When I put my hand up,
p236
aV"Ha, ha, ha, ha" and that's how we sold him.
p237
aVAnd Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time,
p238
aVsaid, "Yeah, we want to do this.
p239
aVWe have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair,
p240
aVand we're going to hire you guys to do this."
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd so Dave and I got working.
p243
aVMostly me, because it was all mechanics at this point.
p244
aVSo now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff
p245
aVI don't know how to do.
p246
aVAnd I started working with Solid Works
p247
aVand a whole other group to do that.
p248
aVAnd we started \u2014
p249
aVthis was way back before there was really much SLA going on,
p250
aVnot a lot of rapid prototyping.
p251
aVWe certainly didn't have the money to do this.
p252
aVThey only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this,
p253
aVso I had to call a friend of a friend
p254
aVwho was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down.
p255
aVAnd they said, "Yeah, well, we'll run them."
p256
aVSo they ran all the shells for us, which was nice of them.
p257
aVAnd the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard.
p258
aVWe snuck in on the weekend.
p259
aVAnd so we just had a disc of the files.
p260
aVBut they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine.
p261
aVSo we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors.
p262
aVAnd on the weekend we ran the parts for that.
p263
aVSo this is how they come out close to the end.
p264
aVAnd then they looked like little Garfields there.
p265
aVEight months later \u2014 you may remember this,
p266
aVthis was a \u2014 total, total, total chaos.
p267
aVFor a while, they were making two million Furbys a month.
p268
aVThey actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys.
p269
aVI \u2014 it's unbelievable how \u2014 I don't know how that can be.
p270
aVAnd Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars.
p271
aVAnd I just a little bit on each one.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo full circle \u2014 why do I do this?
p274
aVWhy do you, you know, try to do this stuff?
p275
aVAnd it's, of course, for your kids.
p276
aVAnd there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys.
p277
aVAnd she still actually has those.
p278
aVSo I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise
p279
aVup in Boise, on a river, you know. So
p280
aVand then I started another company called Toy Innovation
p281
aVand we did some projects with Mattel with
p282
aVactually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross,
p283
aVand we did Miracle Moves Baby,
p284
aVmade it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff.
p285
aVAnd then I started another company.
p286
aVWe did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet,
p287
aVwon "Best Innovations" at CES,
p288
aVbut really I kind of slowed down and said, OK,
p289
aVI just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur,
p290
aVand I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it,
p291
aVand then people started to want to do it.
p292
aVAnd they said they'd spend all this time.
p293
aVSo I said, "OK, let's try to do this dinosaur project."
p294
aVThe crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur
p295
aVas much as we can with today's technology.
p296
aVAnd it's not really \u2014 but as close as we can do.
p297
aVAnd we're going to try to really pull this off,
p298
aVintentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive.
p299
aVNot a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it.
p300
aVSo I picked a Camarasaurus,
p301
aVbecause the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America.
p302
aVAnd you could actually find full fossil evidence of these.
p303
aVThat's a juvenile.
p304
aVAnd so we actually went in.
p305
aVThere's a book called "Walking on Eggshells,"
p306
aVwhere they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia.
p307
aVAnd the picture from the book, so when I \u2014
p308
aVI told the sculptor to use this bump pattern, whatever you can to copy that.
p309
aVVery, very obsessive.
p310
aVThere's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton,
p311
aVbut the geometry's correct.
p312
aVAnd then I went in, and measured all the geometry
p313
aVbecause I figured, hey, biomimicry.
p314
aVIf I do it kind of right, it might move kind of like the real thing.
p315
aVSo there's the motor.
p316
aVAnd about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help.
p317
aVHere's an example of what we did with the skull.
p318
aVThere's the skull, there's my drawing of a skull.
p319
aVThere's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue.
p320
aVThere's the mechanism that would go in there,
p321
aVkind of a Geneva drive.
p322
aVThere's some Solid Works versions of it.
p323
aVHere's some SLA parts of the same thing.
p324
aVAnd then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here.
p325
aVThere's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus.
p326
aVThere's a photorealistic eye behind a lens.
p327
aVAnd there's kind of the first exploded view, or see-through view.
p328
aVThere's the first SLA version, and it already kind of has the feel,
p329
aVit has kind of a cuteness already.
p330
aVAnd the thing about blending science and art
p331
aVin this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot,
p332
aVand then you go back and do the shape,
p333
aVand then you go back and forth.
p334
aVThe servos in the front legs, we had to shape those like muscles.
p335
aVThey had to fit within the envelope.
p336
aVThere was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right.
p337
aVAll the neck and the tail are cable,
p338
aVso it moves smoothly and organically.
p339
aVAnd then, of course, you're not done yet.
p340
aVYou have to get the look for the skin.
p341
aVThe skin's a whole another thing, probably the hardest part.
p342
aVSo you hire artists, and you try to get the look and feel
p343
aVof the character.
p344
aVNow, this is not \u2014 we're character designers, right?
p345
aVAnd we're still trying to keep with the real character.
p346
aVSo, now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay.
p347
aVNow you start doing the sculpture for this.
p348
aVAnd you can see we got a guy from \u2014
p349
aVwho's just a fanatic about dinosaurs
p350
aVto do the sculpting for us,
p351
aVdown to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything.
p352
aVAnd then more sculpting, and then more sculpting,
p353
aVand then more sculpting, and then more sculpting.
p354
aVAnd then, four years and 10 million dollars later,
p355
aVwe have a little Pleo.
p356
aVJohn, do you want to bring him up?
p357
aa(lp358
VJohn Sosoka is our CTO, and is really the man
p359
aVthat's done most of the work with our 40-person company.
p360
aVI'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka.
p361
aV(Applause)
p362
aVSo, thank you, John, thank you,
p363
aVand get back to work, all right, man?
p364
aVAll right \u2014
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aV\u2014 no, it's very painful, so \u2014
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aV\u2014 these are little Pleos and you can probably see them.
p369
aVThis \u2014 I on purpose \u2014 they go through life stages.
p370
aVSo when you first get them, they're babies.
p371
aVAnd you \u2014 more you have them, kind of the older they get,
p372
aVand they kind of learn through their behavior.
p373
aVSo this one, this one's actually asleep, and \u2014 hang on.
p374
aVPleo, wake up. Pleo, come on.
p375
aVSo this guy's listening to my voice here.
p376
aVBut they have 40 sensors all over their body.
p377
aVThey have seven processors, they have 14 motors,
p378
aVthey have \u2014
p379
aVbut you don't care, do you?
p380
aVThey're just cute, right? That's the idea, that's the idea.
p381
aVSo you see \u2014 hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that?
p382
aVThere's something big and loud over here.
p383
aVHey.
p384
aV(Laughter)
p385
aVThat's good, wake up, wake up, wake up.
p386
aVYeah, they're like kids, you know.
p387
aVYou, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry.
p388
aVI'll show you what he's been doing for, for four years.
p389
aVHere, here, here. Have some money, Pleo.
p390
aV(Laughter)
p391
aVThere you go.
p392
aVThat's what the investors think, that it's just \u2014
p393
aV(Laughter)
p394
aV\u2014 right, right. So they're really sweet little guys.
p395
aVAnd we're hoping that \u2014 you know,
p396
aVour belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things
p397
aVin order to be more human.
p398
aVAnd we think we can help that out by having
p399
aVlittle creatures that you can love.
p400
aVNow these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know.
p401
aVThey do change over time.
p402
aVBut mostly they evoke a feeling of caring.
p403
aVAnd we have a \u2014 I have a little something here.
p404
aVNow I do want to say that, you know, Ugobe is not there yet.
p405
aVWe've just opened the door, and it's for all of you to step through it.
p406
aVWe did include some things that are hopefully useful.
p407
aVExcuse me, Pleo.
p408
aVThey \u2014 he has a USB and he has a SD card,
p409
aVso it's completely open architecture.
p410
aVSo anyone can plug him \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 thank you.
p411
aVThis is John over here.
p412
aVAnyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality.
p413
aVYou can make him bipolar, or as someone said, a \u2014
p414
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p415
aVyou can change his homeostatic drives, or whatever you want to call them.
p416
aVKids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds.
p417
aVWe \u2014 actually, it's very hard to keep people from doing this.
p418
aVWe have one animator who's taken it and
p419
aVhe's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial,
p420
aVand they're going, "Whassup," you know?
p421
aV(Laughter)
p422
aVYou \u2014 so it's \u2014 yes, he likes that.
p423
aVSo they're a handful. We hope you get one.
p424
aVI don't know what I'm missing to say,
p425
aVbut as a last thing, I'd like to say is that
p426
aVif we continue along this path, we are designing our children's best friends.
p427
aVAnd there's a lot of social responsibility in that.
p428
aVThat's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving.
p429
aVAnd so I just \u2014 I hope we all dream well.
p430
aVThank you.
p431
aV(Applause)

VLike most journalists, I'm an idealist.
p5
aVI love unearthing good stories, especially untold stories.
p6
aVI just didn't think that in 2011,
p7
aVwomen would still be in that category.
p8
aa(lp9
VI'm the President of the Journalism and Women Symposium \u2014 JAWS.
p10
aVThat's Sharky.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VI joined 10 years ago because I wanted female role models,
p15
aVand I was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession
p16
aVand what that meant for our image in the media.
p17
aVWe make up half the population of the world,
p18
aVbut we're just 24 percent of the news subjects
p19
aVquoted in news stories.
p20
aVAnd we're just 20 percent of the experts quoted in stories.
p21
aVAnd now, with today's technology,
p22
aVit's possible to remove women from the picture completely.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is a picture of President Barack Obama and his advisors,
p25
aVtracking the killing of Osama bin Laden.
p26
aVYou can see Hillary Clinton on the right.
p27
aVLet's see how the photo ran
p28
aVin an Orthodox Jewish newspaper based in Brooklyn.
p29
aVHillary's completely gone.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VThe paper apologized, but said it never runs photos of women;
p34
aVthey might be sexually provocative.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VThis is an extreme case, yes.
p39
aVBut the fact is,
p40
aVwomen are only 19 percent of the sources in stories on politics,
p41
aVand only 20 percent in stories on the economy.
p42
aVThe news continues to give us a picture
p43
aVwhere men outnumber women
p44
aVin nearly all occupational categories, except two:
p45
aVstudents and homemakers.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo we all get a very distorted picture of reality.
p50
aVThe problem is, of course, there aren't enough women in newsrooms.
p51
aVThey report at just 37 percent of stories in print, TV and radio.
p52
aVEven in stories on gender-based violence,
p53
aVmen get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime.
p54
aa(lp55
VCase in point:
p56
aVThis March, the New York Times ran a story by James McKinley
p57
aVabout a gang rape of a young girl,
p58
aV11 years old, in a small Texas town.
p59
aVMcKinley writes that the community is wondering,
p60
aV"How could their boys have been drawn into this?"
p61
aV"Drawn into this" \u2014
p62
aVlike they were seduced into committing an act of violence.
p63
aVAnd the first person he quotes says,
p64
aV"These boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives."
p65
aV(Groans, laughter)
p66
aVYou don't hear much about the 11-year-old victim,
p67
aVexcept that she wore clothes that were a little old for her
p68
aVand she wore makeup.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe Times was deluged with criticism.
p71
aVInitially, it defended itself,
p72
aVand said, "These aren't our views.
p73
aVThis is what we found in our reporting."
p74
aVNow, here's a secret you probably know already:
p75
aVYour stories are constructed.
p76
aVAs reporters, we research, we interview.
p77
aVWe try to give a good picture of reality.
p78
aVWe also have our own unconscious biases.
p79
aVBut The Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story
p80
aVthe same way.
p81
aVI disagree with that.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo three weeks later,
p84
aVThe Times revisits the story.
p85
aVThis time, it adds another byline to it with McKinley's:
p86
aVErica Goode.
p87
aVWhat emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale
p88
aVof a young girl and her family trapped in poverty.
p89
aVShe was raped numerous times by many men.
p90
aVShe had been a bright, easygoing girl.
p91
aVShe was maturing quickly, physically,
p92
aVbut her bed was still covered with stuffed animals.
p93
aVIt's a very different picture.
p94
aVPerhaps the addition of Ms. Goode is what made this story more complete.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe Global Media Monitoring Project has found that stories by female reporters
p97
aVare more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters.
p98
aVAt KUNM here in Albuquerque,
p99
aVElaine Baumgartel did some graduate research
p100
aVon the coverage of violence against women.
p101
aVWhat she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims
p102
aVand devalue their lives.
p103
aVThey tend to sensationalize, and they lack context.
p104
aVSo for her graduate work,
p105
aVshe did a three-part series on the murder of 11 women,
p106
aVfound buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa.
p107
aVShe tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work
p108
aVand she tried to show the challenges that journalists face
p109
aVfrom external sources, their own internal biases
p110
aVand cultural norms.
p111
aVAnd she worked with an editor at National Public Radio
p112
aVto try to get a story aired nationally.
p113
aVShe's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female.
p114
aa(lp115
VStories in the news
p116
aVare more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men,
p117
aVand women are more likely to be defined by their body parts.
p118
aVWired magazine, November 2010.
p119
aVYes, the issue was about breast-tissue engineering.
p120
aVNow I know you're all distracted, so I'll take that off.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VEyes up here.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VSo \u2014
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VHere's the thing:
p133
aVWired almost never puts women on its cover.
p134
aVOh, there have been some gimmicky ones \u2014
p135
aVPam from "The Office,"
p136
aVmanga girls,
p137
aVa voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds.
p138
aVTexas State University professor Cindy Royal wondered in her blog
p139
aVhow are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles
p140
aVin technology, reading Wired.
p141
aVChris Anderson, the editor of Wired, defended his choice
p142
aVand said there aren't enough women, prominent women
p143
aVin technology to sell a cover, to sell an issue.
p144
aVPart of that is true,
p145
aVthere aren't as many prominent women in technology.
p146
aa(lp147
VHere's my problem with that argument:
p148
aVMedia tells us every day what's important,
p149
aVby the stories they choose and where they place them;
p150
aVit's called agenda setting.
p151
aVHow many people knew the founders of Facebook and Google
p152
aVbefore their faces were on a magazine cover?
p153
aVPutting them there made them more recognizable.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, Fast Company Magazine embraces that idea.
p156
aVThis is its cover from November 15, 2010.
p157
aVThe issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology.
p158
aVEditor Robert Safian told the Poynter Institute,
p159
aV"Silicon Valley is very white and very male.
p160
aVBut that's not what Fast Company thinks
p161
aVthe business world will look like in the future,
p162
aVso it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving."
p163
aa(lp164
VBy the way, apparently, Wired took all this to heart.
p165
aVThis was its issue in April.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VThat's Limor Fried, the founder of Adafruit Industries,
p170
aVin the Rosie the Riveter pose.
p171
aa(lp172
VIt would help to have more women in positions of leadership in media.
p173
aVA recent global survey
p174
aVfound that 73 percent of the top media-management jobs
p175
aVare still held by men.
p176
aVBut this is also about something far more complex:
p177
aVour own unconscious biases and blind spots.
p178
aa(lp179
VShankar Vedantam is the author
p180
aVof "The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents,
p181
aVControl Markets, Wage Wars, and Save Our Lives."
p182
aVHe told the former ombudsman at National Public Radio,
p183
aVwho was doing a report on how women fare in NPR coverage,
p184
aVunconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives.
p185
aVIt's really difficult to disentangle those strands.
p186
aVBut he did have one suggestion.
p187
aVHe used to work for two editors
p188
aVwho said every story had to have at least one female source.
p189
aVHe balked at first,
p190
aVbut said he eventually followed the directive happily,
p191
aVbecause his stories got better
p192
aVand his job got easier.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, I don't know if one of the editors was a woman,
p195
aVbut that can make the biggest difference.
p196
aVThe Dallas Morning News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994
p197
aVfor a series it did on women around the world,
p198
aVbut one of the reporters told me
p199
aVshe's convinced it never would have happened
p200
aVif they had not had a female assistant foreign editor,
p201
aVand they would not have gotten some of those stories
p202
aVwithout female reporters and editors on the ground,
p203
aVparticularly one on female genital mutilation \u2014
p204
aVmen would just not be allowed into those situations.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis is an important point to consider,
p207
aVbecause much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries
p208
aVwhere the treatment of women is an issue,
p209
aVsuch as Afghanistan.
p210
aVWhat we're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country
p211
aVis that the fate of the women is primary.
p212
aVNow, I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul can find women to interview.
p213
aVNot so sure about rural, traditional areas,
p214
aVwhere I'm guessing women can't talk to strange men.
p215
aa(lp216
VIt's important to keep talking about this, in light of Lara Logan.
p217
aVShe was the CBS News correspondent
p218
aVwho was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt's Tahrir Square,
p219
aVright after this photo was taken.
p220
aVAlmost immediately, pundits weighed in,
p221
aVblaming her and saying things like,
p222
aV"You know, maybe women shouldn't be sent to cover those stories."
p223
aVI never heard anyone say this about Anderson Cooper and his crew,
p224
aVwho were attacked covering the same story.
p225
aa(lp226
VOne way to get more women into leadership
p227
aVis to have other women mentor them.
p228
aVOne of my board members is an editor at a major global media company,
p229
aVbut she never thought about this as a career path,
p230
aVuntil she met female role models at JAWS.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut this is not just a job for super-journalists
p233
aVor my organization.
p234
aVYou all have a stake in a strong, vibrant media.
p235
aVAnalyze your news.
p236
aVAnd speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage,
p237
aVlike people at The New York Times did.
p238
aVSuggest female sources to reporters and editors.
p239
aVRemember \u2014 a complete picture of reality may depend upon it.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd I'll leave you with a video clip
p242
aVthat I first saw in [1987] when I was a student in London.
p243
aVIt's for The Guardian newspaper.
p244
aVIt's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist,
p245
aVbut I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world.
p246
aVNarrator: An event seen from one point of view gives one impression.
p247
aVSeen from another point of view,
p248
aVit gives quite a different impression.
p249
aVBut it's only when you get the whole picture,
p250
aVyou can fully understand what's going on.
p251
aa(lp252
V[The Guardian]
p253
aa(lp254
VMegan Kamerick: I think you'll all agree
p255
aVthat we'd be better off if we all had the whole picture.

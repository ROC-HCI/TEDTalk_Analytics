VI study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work.
p5
aVAnd in particular, how the simple parts of organizations
p6
aVinteract to create the behavior of the whole organization.
p7
aVSo, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that,
p8
aVand there are many others. The web is one.
p9
aVThere are many biological systems like that \u2014
p10
aVbrains, cells, developing embryos.
p11
aa(lp12
VThere are about 10,000 species of ants.
p13
aVThey all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens,
p14
aVand then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers.
p15
aVAnd all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control.
p16
aVNobody tells anybody what to do.
p17
aVThe queen just lays the eggs. There's no management.
p18
aVNo ant directs the behavior of any other ant.
p19
aVAnd I try to figure out how that works.
p20
aVAnd I've been working for the past 20 years
p21
aVon a population of seed-eating ants in southeastern Arizona.
p22
aa(lp23
VHere's my study site. This is really a picture of ants,
p24
aVand the rabbit just happens to be there.
p25
aVAnd these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds.
p26
aVThis is the nest of the mature colony, and there's the nest entrance.
p27
aVAnd they forage maybe for about 20 meters away,
p28
aVgather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest, and store them.
p29
aVAnd every year I go there and make a map of my study site.
p30
aVThis is just a road. And it's not very big:
p31
aVit's about 250 meters on one side, 400 on the other.
p32
aVAnd every colony has a name, which is a number,
p33
aVwhich is painted on a rock. And I go there every year
p34
aVand look for all the colonies that were alive the year before,
p35
aVand figure out which ones have died, and put all the new ones on the map.
p36
aVAnd by doing this I know how old they all are.
p37
aVAnd because of that, I've been able to study how their behavior changes
p38
aVas the colony gets older and larger.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony.
p41
aVAnts never make more ants; colonies make more colonies.
p42
aVAnd they do that by each year sending out the reproductives \u2014
p43
aVthose are the ones with wings \u2014 on a mating flight.
p44
aVSo every year, on the same day \u2014 and it's a mystery exactly how that happens \u2014
p45
aVeach colony sends out its virgin, unmated queens with wings, and the males,
p46
aVand they all fly to a common place. And they mate.
p47
aVAnd this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings.
p48
aVAnd she's in the process of mating with this male,
p49
aVand there's another male on top waiting his turn.
p50
aVOften the queens mate more than once.
p51
aVAnd after that, the males all die. That's it for them.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere, drop their wings,
p56
aVdig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs.
p57
aVAnd they will live for 15 or 20 years, continuing to lay eggs
p58
aVusing the sperm from that original mating.
p59
aVSo the queen goes down in there.
p60
aVShe lays eggs, she feeds the larvae \u2014 so an ant starts as an egg, then it's a larva.
p61
aVShe feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves.
p62
aVThen, as soon as the ants \u2014 the first group of ants \u2014 emerge,
p63
aVthey're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants.
p64
aVThey go out, they get the food, they dig the nest,
p65
aVand the queen never comes out again.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo this is a one-year-old colony \u2014 this happens to be 536.
p68
aVThere's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.
p69
aVSo this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer.
p70
aVThis is a three-year-old colony.
p71
aVThere's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.
p72
aVThey make a midden, a pile of refuse \u2014 mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat.
p73
aVThis is a five-year-old colony. This is the nest entrance, here's a pencil for scale.
p74
aVThis is about as big as they get, about a meter across.
p75
aVAnd then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes \u2014
p76
aVso this is about 10,000 worker ants \u2014
p77
aVchanges as a function of colony age, in years.
p78
aVSo it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen,
p79
aVand it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.
p80
aVAnd it stays that size until the queen dies
p81
aVand there's nobody to make more ants, when she's about 15 or 20 years old.
p82
aVAnd it's when they reach this stable size, in numbers of ants,
p83
aVthat they start to reproduce.
p84
aVThat is, to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight.
p85
aVAnd I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age
p86
aVbecause I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants. (Laughter)
p87
aVSo that's not the most fun part of this research, although it's interesting.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VReally the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation.
p92
aVThat's not just how is the colony organized,
p93
aVbut how does it change what it's doing?
p94
aVHow is it that the colony manages to adjust
p95
aVthe numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change?
p96
aVSo, things happen to an ant colony.
p97
aVWhen it rains in the summer, it floods in the desert.
p98
aVThere's a lot of damage to the nest,
p99
aVand extra ants are needed to clean up that mess.
p100
aVWhen extra food becomes available \u2014
p101
aVand this is what everybody knows about picnics \u2014
p102
aVthen extra ants are allocated to collect the food.
p103
aVSo, with nobody telling anybody what to do, how is it that
p104
aVthe colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task?
p105
aVAnd that's the process that I call task allocation.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd in harvester ants, I divide the tasks
p108
aVof the ants I see just outside the nest
p109
aVinto these four categories: where an ant is foraging,
p110
aVwhen it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back.
p111
aVThe patrollers \u2014 that's supposed to be a magnifying glass \u2014
p112
aVare an interesting group that go out early in the morning
p113
aVbefore the foragers are active.
p114
aVThey somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go,
p115
aVand by coming back \u2014 just by making it back \u2014
p116
aVthey tell the foragers that it's safe to go out.
p117
aVThen the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest,
p118
aVand I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house.
p119
aVThat is, that there are chambers inside,
p120
aVthey line the walls of the chambers with moist soil
p121
aVand it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it.
p122
aVIt also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings
p123
aVof the Hopi people that are in that area.
p124
aVAnd the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest,
p125
aVand then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles.
p126
aVSo you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand,
p127
aVput it down, turn around, and go back in.
p128
aVAnd finally, the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage.
p129
aVSo what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.
p130
aVOn one day, it'll all be here, and then the next day
p131
aVthey'll move it over there, and then they'll move it back.
p132
aVSo that's what the midden workers do.
p133
aVAnd these four groups are just the ants outside the nest.
p134
aVSo that's only about 25 percent of the colony, and they're the oldest ants.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo, an ant starts out somewhere near the queen.
p137
aVAnd when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep
p138
aVas the colony is wide, so about a meter deep for the big old nests.
p139
aVAnd then there's another long tunnel and a chamber, where we often find the queen,
p140
aVafter eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes.
p141
aVI don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe
p142
aVand my crew of students with pickaxes,
p143
aVbut instead because when there's flooding,
p144
aVoccasionally the colony has to go down deep.
p145
aVSo there's this whole network of chambers.
p146
aVThe queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs.
p147
aVThere's the larvae, and they consume most of the food.
p148
aVAnd this is true of most ants \u2014
p149
aVthat the ants you see walking around don't do much eating.
p150
aVThey bring it back and feed it to the larvae.
p151
aVWhen the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber,
p152
aVand other ants come up from below, get the food,
p153
aVbring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up.
p154
aVThere are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest.
p155
aVAnd curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time
p156
aVabout half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.
p157
aVSo, despite what it says in the Bible,
p158
aVabout, you know, "Look to the ant, thou sluggard,"
p159
aVin fact, you could think of those ants as reserves.
p160
aVThat is to say, if something happened \u2014 and I've never seen anything like this happen,
p161
aVbut I've only been looking for 20 years \u2014
p162
aVif something happened, they might all come out if they were needed.
p163
aVBut in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd I think it's a very interesting question \u2014
p166
aVwhat is there about the way the colony is organized
p167
aVthat might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing?
p168
aVAnd they sort of stand as a buffer in between
p169
aVthe ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside.
p170
aVAnd if you mark ants that are working outside, and dig up a colony,
p171
aVyou never see them deep down.
p172
aVSo what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger.
p173
aVThey somehow get into this reserve.
p174
aVAnd then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce.
p175
aVAnd once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down.
p176
aVNow ants \u2014 most ants, including these, don't see very well.
p177
aVThey have eyes, they can distinguish between light and dark,
p178
aVbut they mostly work by smell.
p179
aVSo just to reinforce that what you might have thought
p180
aVabout ant queens isn't true \u2014
p181
aVyou know, even if the queen did have the intelligence
p182
aVto send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers
p183
aVto tell the ants outside what to do,
p184
aVthere is no way that such messages could make it in time to see
p185
aVthe shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest.
p186
aVSo that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo when I first set out to work on task allocation,
p189
aVmy first question was, "What's the relationship
p190
aVbetween the ants doing different tasks?
p191
aVDoes it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing?
p192
aVDoes it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing?"
p193
aVAnd I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant
p194
aVwas somehow dedicated to its task from birth
p195
aVand sort of performed independently of the others,
p196
aVknowing its place on the assembly line.
p197
aVAnd instead I wanted to ask, "How are the different task groups interdependent?"
p198
aa(lp199
VSo I did experiments where I changed one thing.
p200
aVSo for example, I created more work for the nest maintenance workers
p201
aVby putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance,
p202
aVearly in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active.
p203
aVThis is what it looks like about 20 minutes later.
p204
aVHere it is about 40 minutes later.
p205
aVAnd the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks
p206
aVto the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there.
p207
aVAnd what I wanted to know was, "OK,
p208
aVhere's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited \u2014
p209
aVis this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?"
p210
aVThen we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked.
p211
aVSo here's some blue nest maintenance workers.
p212
aVAnd lately we've gotten more sophisticated
p213
aVand we have this three-color system.
p214
aVAnd we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which.
p215
aVWe started out with model airplane paint
p216
aVand then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers,
p217
aVand they work really well.
p218
aVAnd so just to summarize the result,
p219
aVwell it turns out that yes, the different tasks are interdependent.
p220
aVSo, if I change the numbers performing one task,
p221
aVit changes the numbers performing another.
p222
aVSo for example, if I make a mess
p223
aVthat the nest maintenance workers have to clean up,
p224
aVthen I see fewer ants out foraging.
p225
aVAnd this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd the second result, which was surprising to a lot of people,
p228
aVwas that ants actually switch tasks.
p229
aVThe same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life.
p230
aVSo for example, if I put out extra food, everybody else \u2014
p231
aVthe midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food,
p232
aVthey become foragers.
p233
aVThe nest maintenance workers become foragers.
p234
aVThe patrollers become foragers.
p235
aVBut not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works.
p236
aVLike I just said, if there is more food to collect, the patrollers, the midden workers,
p237
aVthe nest maintenance workers will all change to forage.
p238
aVIf there's more patrolling to do \u2014
p239
aVso I created a disturbance, so extra patrollers were needed \u2014
p240
aVthe nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol.
p241
aVBut if more nest maintenance work is needed \u2014
p242
aVfor example, if I put out a bunch of toothpicks \u2014
p243
aVthen nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance,
p244
aVthey have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest.
p245
aVSo foraging acts as a sink, and the ants inside the nest act as a source.
p246
aVAnd finally, it looks like each ant is deciding
p247
aVmoment to moment whether to be active or not.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do,
p250
aVit's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that.
p251
aVBut the foragers somehow decide not to come out.
p252
aVAnd here was the most intriguing result: the task allocation.
p253
aVThis process changes with colony age, and it changes like this.
p254
aVWhen I do these experiments with older colonies \u2014
p255
aVso ones that are five years or older \u2014
p256
aVthey're much more consistent from one time to another
p257
aVand much more homeostatic. The worse things get,
p258
aVthe more I hassle them, the more they act like undisturbed colonies.
p259
aVWhereas the young, small colonies \u2014
p260
aVthe two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants \u2014 are much more variable.
p261
aVAnd the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year.
p262
aVIt could be this year, or this year.
p263
aVSo, the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable
p264
aVare not any older than the ants in the younger colony.
p265
aVIt's not due to the experience of older, wiser ants.
p266
aVInstead, something about the organization
p267
aVmust be changing as the colony gets older.
p268
aVAnd the obvious thing that's changing is its size.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo since I've had this result, I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out
p271
aVwhat kinds of decision rules \u2014 very simple, local, probably olfactory, chemical
p272
aVrules could an ant could be using, since no ant can assess the global situation \u2014
p273
aVthat would have the outcome that I see,
p274
aVthese predictable dynamics, in who does what task.
p275
aVAnd it would change as the colony gets larger.
p276
aVAnd what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.
p277
aVSo anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae.
p278
aVThey smell with their antennae.
p279
aVWhen one ant touches another, it's smelling it,
p280
aVand it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate
p281
aVbecause ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming,
p282
aVwith a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor.
p283
aVAnd what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts,
p284
aVthe rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do.
p285
aVAnd so what the message is, is not any message
p286
aVthat they transmit from one ant to another, but the pattern.
p287
aVThe pattern itself is the message.
p288
aVAnd I'll tell you a little bit more about that.
p289
aa(lp290
VBut first you might be wondering:
p291
aVhow is it that an ant can tell, for example, I'm a forager.
p292
aVI expect to meet another forager every so often.
p293
aVBut if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers,
p294
aVI'm less likely to forage.
p295
aVSo it has to know the difference between
p296
aVa forager and a nest maintenance worker.
p297
aVAnd we've learned that, in this species \u2014
p298
aVand I suspect in others as well \u2014
p299
aVthese hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants,
p300
aVis different as ants perform different tasks.
p301
aVAnd we've done experiments that show that
p302
aVthat's because the longer an ant stays outside,
p303
aVthe more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change,
p304
aVand so they come to smell different by doing different tasks.
p305
aVAnd they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons \u2014
p306
aVthey can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow
p307
aVkeep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks.
p308
aVAnd we've just recently demonstrated this
p309
aVby putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads,
p310
aVand dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate.
p311
aVAnd it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact
p312
aVwith a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it,
p313
aVas they would to contact with real ants.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo I want now to show you a bit of film \u2014
p316
aVand this will start out, first of all, showing you the nest entrance.
p317
aVSo the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance.
p318
aVThey've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet
p319
aVas they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences,
p320
aVeach ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform.
p321
aVThis is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest.
p322
aVIn the beginning you see the ants
p323
aVjust kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope.
p324
aVBut the idea is that the ants are in there,
p325
aVand each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it \u2014
p326
aVa stream of contacts with other ants.
p327
aVAnd the pattern of these interactions determines
p328
aVwhether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out.
p329
aVYou can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.
p330
aVEach ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants.
p331
aVAnd the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance
p332
aVto decide whether to go out on their next trip,
p333
aVare contacting the ants coming in.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.
p336
aVIt's variable. It's noisy. And, in particular, in two ways.
p337
aVThe first is that the experience of the ant \u2014 of each ant \u2014 can't be very predictable.
p338
aVBecause the rate at which ants come back depends on
p339
aVall the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.
p340
aVAnd the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern
p341
aVmust be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting.
p342
aVSo, we do a lot of simulation and modeling, and also experimental work,
p343
aVto try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to,
p344
aVin the aggregate, produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies.
p345
aa(lp346
VAgain, I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions
p347
aVproduces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork.
p348
aVIn fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them
p349
aVbecause they never seem to be doing anything
p350
aVexactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it.
p351
aVSo it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts, perfection arises.
p352
aVBut it works pretty well.
p353
aVAnts have been around for several hundred million years.
p354
aVThey cover the earth, except for Antarctica.
p355
aVSomething that they're doing is clearly successful enough
p356
aVthat this pattern of haphazard contacts, in the aggregate,
p357
aVproduces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants.
p358
aVAnd one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection
p359
aVmight be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns \u2014
p360
aVthis network of interaction patterns \u2014
p361
aVto perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies.
p362
aa(lp363
VSo the one thing, though, that I want you to remember about this
p364
aVis that these patterns of interactions
p365
aVare something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size.
p366
aVThe simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony \u2014
p367
aVand an ant in a large colony can use the same rule,
p368
aVlike "I expect to meet another forager every three seconds."
p369
aVBut in a small colony, it's likely to meet fewer foragers,
p370
aVjust because there are fewer other foragers there to meet.
p371
aVSo this is the kind of rule that, as the colony develops and gets older and larger,
p372
aVwill produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one.
p373

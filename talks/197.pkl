VYou will understand nothing with my type of English.
p5
aVIt's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people.
p6
aVI must tell you I am like that, not very comfortable,
p7
aVbecause usually, in life, I think my job is absolutely useless.
p8
aVI mean, I feel useless.
p9
aVNow after Carolyn, and all the other guys, I feel like shit.
p10
aVAnd definitively, I don't know why I am here,
p11
aVbut \u2014 you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor,
p12
aVyou arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!"
p13
aVI don't know. (Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VSo, so, because I have nothing to show, nothing to say,
p16
aVwe shall try to speak about something else.
p17
aVWe can start, if you want, by understanding \u2014
p18
aVit's just to start, it's not interesting, but \u2014 how I work.
p19
aVWhen somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known,
p20
aVI mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats,
p21
aVand why not \u2014 a toothbrush?
p22
aVI don't try to design the toothbrush.
p23
aVI don't try to say, "Oh, that will be a beautiful object," or something like that.
p24
aVThat doesn't interest me.
p25
aa(lp26
VBecause there is different types of design.
p27
aVThe one, we can call it the cynical design,
p28
aVthat means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '50s,
p29
aVwho said, what is ugly is a bad sale, la laideur se vend mal, which is terrible.
p30
aVIt means the design must be just the weapon for marketing,
p31
aVfor producer to make product more sexy, like that,
p32
aVthey sell more: it's shit, it's obsolete, it's ridiculous.
p33
aVI call that the cynical design.
p34
aa(lp35
VAfter, there is the narcissistic design:
p36
aVit's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers. (Laughter)
p37
aVAfter, there is people like me, who try to deserve to exist,
p38
aVand who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in another way,
p39
aVand they try, I try, to not make the object for the object but for the result,
p40
aVfor the profit for the human being, the person who will use it.
p41
aVIf we take the toothbrush \u2014 I don't think about the toothbrush.
p42
aVI think, "What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth?"
p43
aVAnd to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth,
p44
aVI must imagine: Who owns this mouth?
p45
aVWhat is the life of the owner of this mouth? In what society [does] this guy live?
p46
aVWhat civilization creates this society?
p47
aVWhat animal species creates this civilization?
p48
aVWhen I arrive \u2014 and I take one minute, I am not so intelligent \u2014
p49
aVwhen I arrive at the level of animal species, that becomes real interesting.
p50
aa(lp51
VMe, I have strictly no power to change anything.
p52
aVBut when I come back, I can understand why I shall not do it,
p53
aVbecause today to not do it, it's more positive than do it, or how I shall do it.
p54
aVBut to come back, where I am at the animal species, there is things to see.
p55
aVThere is things to see, there is the big challenge.
p56
aVThe big challenge in front of us.
p57
aVBecause there is not a human production
p58
aVwhich exists outside of what I call "the big image."
p59
aVThe big image is our story, our poetry, our romanticism.
p60
aVOur poetry is our mutation, our life.
p61
aVWe must remember, and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old,
p62
aVthat life appears four billion years ago, around \u2014 four billion point two?
p63
aa(lp64
VVoice offstage: Four point five.
p65
aa(lp66
VYes, point five, OK, OK, OK! (Laughter) I'm a designer,
p67
aVthat's all, of Christmas gifts.
p68
aVAnd before, there was this soup, called "soupe primordiale,"
p69
aVthis first soup \u2014 bloop bloop bloop \u2014
p70
aVsort of dirty mud, no life, nothing.
p71
aVSo then \u2014 pshoo-shoo \u2014 lightning \u2014 pshoo \u2014 arrive \u2014
p72
aVpshoo-shoo \u2014 makes life \u2014 bloop bloop \u2014 and that dies.
p73
aVSome million years after \u2014 pshoo-shoo, bloop-bloop \u2014 ah, wake up!
p74
aVAt the end, finally, that succeeds, and life appears.
p75
aVWe was so, so stupid. The most stupid bacteria.
p76
aVEven, I think, we copy our way to reproduce, you know what I mean,
p77
aVand something of \u2014 oh no, forget it.
p78
aa(lp79
VAfter, we become a fish; after, we become a frog;
p80
aVafter, we become a monkey; after, we become what we are today: a super-monkey,
p81
aVand the fun is, the super-monkey we are today, is at half of the story.
p82
aVCan you imagine? From that stupid bacteria to us,
p83
aVwith a microphone, with a computer, with an iPod: four billion years.
p84
aVAnd we know, and especially Carolyn knows, that when the sun will implode,
p85
aVthe earth will burn, explode, I don't know what,
p86
aVand this is scheduled for four, four billion years?
p87
aVYes, she said, something like that. OK, that means we are at half of the story.
p88
aVFantastic! It's a beauty!
p89
aVCan you imagine? It's very symbolic.
p90
aVBecause the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today.
p91
aVAnd today, we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years.
p92
aVAnd this territory is fantastic.
p93
aa(lp94
VThat is our poetry. That is our beautiful story.
p95
aVIt's our romanticism. Mu-ta-tion. We are mutants.
p96
aVAnd if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutants,
p97
aVwe completely miss the story.
p98
aVBecause every generation thinks we are the final one.
p99
aVWe have a way to look at Earth like that, you know,
p100
aV"I am the man. The final man.
p101
aVYou know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin. (Laughter)
p102
aVFor the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket."
p103
aVSomething like that. I am not sure of that. (Laughter)
p104
aVBecause that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.
p105
aVThere is so many things to do; it's so fresh.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd here is something: nobody is obliged to be a genius,
p108
aVbut everybody is obliged to participate.
p109
aVAnd to participate, for a mutant, there is a minimum of exercise, a minimum of sport.
p110
aVWe can say that.
p111
aVThe first, if you want \u2014 there is so many \u2014
p112
aVbut one which is very easy to do, is the duty of vision.
p113
aVI can explain you. I shall try.
p114
aVIf you walk like that, it's OK, it's OK, you can walk,
p115
aVbut perhaps, because you walk with the eyes like that, you will not see, oh, there is a hole.
p116
aVAnd you will fall, and you will die. Dangerous.
p117
aa(lp118
VThat's why, perhaps, you will try to have this angle of vision.
p119
aVOK, I can see, if I found something, up, up, and they continue, up up up.
p120
aVI raise the angle of vision, but it's still very \u2014 selfish, selfish, egoiste \u2014 yes, selfish.
p121
aVYou, you survive. It's OK.
p122
aVIf you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go,
p123
aV"I see you, oh my God you are here, how are you, I can help you,
p124
aVI can design for you a new toothbrush, new toilet brush," something like that.
p125
aVI live in society; I live in community.
p126
aVIt's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence, we can say.
p127
aVFrom this level, the more you can raise this angle of view,
p128
aVthe more you will be important for the society.
p129
aVThe more you will rise, the more you will be important for the civilization.
p130
aVThe more you will rise, to see far and high, like that,
p131
aVthe more you will be important for the story of our mutation.
p132
aVThat means intelligent people are in this angle. That is intelligence.
p133
aVFrom this to here, that, it's genius.
p134
aVPtolemy, Eratosthenes, Einstein, things like that.
p135
aVNobody's obliged to be a genius.
p136
aVIt's better, but nobody.
p137
aa(lp138
VTake care, in this training, to be a good mutant.
p139
aVThere is some danger, there is some trap. One trap: the vertical.
p140
aVBecause at the vertical of us, if you look like that,
p141
aV"Ah! my God, there is God. Ah! God!"
p142
aVGod is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer.
p143
aVThat means, when your brain is not enough big, when you don't understand,
p144
aVyou go, "Ah, it's God, it's God." That's ridiculous.
p145
aVThat's why \u2014 jump, like that? No, don't jump.
p146
aVCome back. Because, after, there is another trap.
p147
aVIf you look like that, you look to the past,
p148
aVor you look inside if you are very flexible, inside yourself.
p149
aVIt's called schizophrenia, and you are dead also.
p150
aa(lp151
VThat's why every morning, now, because you are a good mutant,
p152
aVyou will raise your angle of view.
p153
aVOut, more of the horizontal. You are an intelligence.
p154
aVNever forget \u2014 like that, like that.
p155
aVIt's very, very, very important.
p156
aVWhat, what else we can say about that? Why do that?
p157
aVIt's because we \u2014 if we look from far, we see our line of evolution.
p158
aVThis line of evolution is clearly positive.
p159
aVFrom far, this line looks very smooth, like that.
p160
aVBut if you take a lens, like that, this line is ack, ack, ack, ack, ack. Like that.
p161
aVIt's made of light and shadow.
p162
aVWe can say light is civilization, shadow is barbaria.
p163
aVAnd it's very important to know where we are.
p164
aVBecause some cycle, there is a spot in the cycle,
p165
aVand you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle.
p166
aa(lp167
VThat means, we can imagine \u2014 I don't say it was fantastic,
p168
aVbut in the '80s, there was not too much war, like that, it was \u2014
p169
aVwe can imagine that the civilization can become civilized.
p170
aVIn this case, people like me are acceptable.
p171
aVWe can say, "It's luxurious time."
p172
aVWe have time to think, we have time to I don't know what,
p173
aVspeak about art and things like that.
p174
aVIt's OK. We are in the light.
p175
aVBut sometimes, like today, we fall, we fall so fast, so fast to shadow, we fall so fast to barbaria.
p176
aVWith many, many, many, many face of barbaria.
p177
aVBecause it's not, the barbaria we have today, it's perhaps not the barbaria we think.
p178
aVThere is different type of barbaria.
p179
aVThat's why we must adapt.
p180
aVThat means, when barbaria is back, forget the beautiful chairs, forget the beautiful hotel,
p181
aVforget design, even \u2014 I'm sorry to say \u2014 forget art.
p182
aVForget all that. There is priority; there is urgency.
p183
aVYou must go back to politics, you must go back to radicalization,
p184
aVI'm sorry if that's not very English.
p185
aVYou must go back to fight, to battle.
p186
aa(lp187
VThat's why today I'm so ashamed to make this job.
p188
aVThat's why I am here, to try to do it the best possible.
p189
aVBut I know that even I do it the best possible
p190
aV\u2014 that's why I'm the best \u2014 it's nothing.
p191
aVBecause it's not the right time.
p192
aVThat's why I say that. I say that, because, I repeat, nothing exist if it's not in the good reason,
p193
aVthe reason of our beautiful dream, of this civilization.
p194
aVAnd because we must all work to finish this story.
p195
aVBecause the scenario of this civilization
p196
aV\u2014 about love, progress, and things like that \u2014 it's OK,
p197
aVbut there is so many different, other scenarios of other civilizations.
p198
aVThis scenario, of this civilization, was about becoming powerful, intelligent,
p199
aVlike this idea we have invented, this concept of God.
p200
aVWe are God now. We are. It's almost done.
p201
aVWe have just to finish the story.
p202
aVThat is very, very important.
p203
aVAnd when you don't understand really what's happened,
p204
aVyou cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that.
p205
aVYou go to the future back, back, back, back, like that.
p206
aVAnd you can fall, and it's very dangerous.
p207
aVNo, you must really understand that.
p208
aa(lp209
VBecause we have almost finished, I'll repeat this story.
p210
aVAnd the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely this civilization,
p211
aVand offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story,
p212
aVa new poetry, a new romanticism.
p213
aVWith billions of people who have been born, worked, lived and died before us,
p214
aVthese people who have worked so much,
p215
aVwe have now bring beautiful things, beautiful gifts, we know so many things.
p216
aVWe can say to our children, OK, done, that was our story. That passed.
p217
aVNow you have a duty: invent a new story. Invent a new poetry.
p218
aVThe only rule is, we have not to have any idea about the next story.
p219
aVWe give you white pages. Invent.
p220
aVWe give you the best tools, the best tools, and now, do it.
p221
aVThat's why I continue to work, even if it's for toilet brush.

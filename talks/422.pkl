VI was trying to think, how is sync connected to happiness,
p5
aVand it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing.
p6
aVWe like to dance together, we like singing together.
p7
aVAnd so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help
p8
aVwith a first experiment today. The experiment is \u2014
p9
aVand I notice, by the way, that when you applauded,
p10
aVthat you did it in a typical North American way,
p11
aVthat is, you were raucous and incoherent.
p12
aVYou were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison.
p13
aVDo you think you could do it? I would like to see if this audience would \u2014
p14
aVno, you haven't practiced, as far as I know \u2014
p15
aVcan you get it together to clap in sync?
p16
aa(lp17
V(Clapping)
p18
aa(lp19
VWhoa! Now, that's what we call emergent behavior.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VSo I didn't expect that, but \u2014 I mean, I expected you could synchronize.
p24
aVIt didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency.
p25
aVIt's interesting.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VSo what do we make of that? First of all, we know that you're all brilliant.
p30
aVThis is a room full of intelligent people, highly sensitive.
p31
aVSome trained musicians out there.
p32
aVIs that what enabled you to synchronize?
p33
aVSo to put the question a little more seriously,
p34
aVlet's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did,
p35
aVfor spontaneous synchronization.
p36
aVDo you need, for instance, to be as smart as you are?
p37
aVDo you even need a brain at all just to synchronize?
p38
aVDo you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right?
p39
aVInanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.
p40
aVIt's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of,
p41
aVif not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.
p42
aVIt extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.
p43
aVIt's a deep tendency toward order in nature
p44
aVthat opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.
p45
aVI mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong \u2014 it's not.
p46
aVBut there is a countervailing force in the universe \u2014
p47
aVthe tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, to get into that, let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately
p50
aVwhen you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature,
p51
aVwhich is the glorious example of birds that flock together,
p52
aVor fish swimming in organized schools.
p53
aVSo these are not particularly intelligent creatures,
p54
aVand yet, as we'll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets.
p55
aVThis is from a BBC show called "Predators,"
p56
aVand what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.
p57
aVWhen you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings,
p58
aVor like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.
p59
aVLet me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.
p60
aVFor a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior,
p61
aVwondering how it could be possible.
p62
aVWe're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.
p63
aVThese creatures are not choreographed.
p64
aVThey're choreographing themselves.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd only today is science starting to figure out how it works.
p67
aVI'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin, a researcher at Oxford,
p68
aVthat shows how swarms work.
p69
aVThere are just three simple rules.
p70
aVFirst, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.
p71
aVSecond, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.
p72
aVAnd third, they're all attracted to each other,
p73
aVbut they try to keep a small distance apart.
p74
aVAnd when you build those three rules in,
p75
aVautomatically you start to see swarms
p76
aVthat look very much like fish schools or bird flocks.
p77
aVNow, fish like to stay close together, about a body length apart.
p78
aVBirds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart.
p79
aVBut except for that difference, the rules are the same for both.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, all this changes when a predator enters the scene.
p82
aVThere's a fourth rule: when a predator's coming, get out of the way.
p83
aVHere on the model you see the predator attacking.
p84
aVThe prey move out in random directions,
p85
aVand then the rule of attraction brings them back together again,
p86
aVso there's this constant splitting and reforming.
p87
aVAnd you see that in nature.
p88
aVKeep in mind that, although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate,
p89
aVwhat's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior.
p90
aVEach is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers.
p91
aVThat is, out of the desire to save itself,
p92
aVeach creature is following these rules,
p93
aVand that leads to something that's safe for all of them.
p94
aVEven though it looks like they're thinking as a group, they're not.
p95
aVYou might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm,
p96
aVso you can think of several.
p97
aa(lp98
VAs I say, if you're in a swarm, your odds of being the unlucky one
p99
aVare reduced as compared to a small group.
p100
aVThere are many eyes to spot danger.
p101
aVAnd you'll see in the example with the starlings, with the birds,
p102
aVwhen this peregrine hawk is about to attack them,
p103
aVthat actually waves of panic can propagate,
p104
aVsending messages over great distances.
p105
aVYou'll see \u2014 let's see, it's coming up possibly at the very end \u2014 maybe not.
p106
aVInformation can be sent over half a kilometer away
p107
aVin a very short time through this mechanism.
p108
aVYes, it's happening here.
p109
aVSee if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm.
p110
aVIt's beautiful. The birds are, we sort of understand, we think,
p111
aVfrom that computer model, what's going on.
p112
aVAs I say, it's just those three simple rules,
p113
aVplus the one about watch out for predators.
p114
aa(lp115
VThere doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this.
p116
aVWe don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level.
p117
aVI'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better.
p118
aVI mean, I showed you a computer model, but a computer is not understanding.
p119
aVA computer is, in a way, just another experiment.
p120
aVWe would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works
p121
aVand to understand, you know, exactly where this organization comes from.
p122
aVHow do the rules give rise to the patterns?
p123
aa(lp124
VThere is one case that we have begun to understand better,
p125
aVand it's the case of fireflies.
p126
aVIf you see fireflies in North America,
p127
aVlike so many North American sorts of things,
p128
aVthey tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other.
p129
aVThey each do their own thing, flashing on and off,
p130
aVpaying no attention to their neighbors.
p131
aVBut in Southeast Asia \u2014 places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo \u2014
p132
aVthere's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies.
p133
aVYou can see it every night along the river banks.
p134
aVThe trees, mangrove trees, are filled with fireflies communicating with light.
p135
aVSpecifically, it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together,
p136
aVin perfect synchrony, to reinforce a message to the females.
p137
aVAnd the message, as you can imagine, is "Come hither. Mate with me."
p138
aa(lp139
V(Music)
p140
aa(lp141
VIn a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly
p142
aVso that you can get a sense. This is a single frame.
p143
aVThen on, and then off \u2014 a 30th of a second, there.
p144
aVAnd then watch this whole river bank, and watch how precise the synchrony is.
p145
aVOn, more on and then off.
p146
aVThe combined light from these beetles \u2014 these are actually tiny beetles \u2014
p147
aVis so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them
p148
aVas navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning.
p149
aVFor a long time it was not believed
p150
aVwhen the first Western travelers, like Sir Francis Drake,
p151
aVwent to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle.
p152
aVNo one believed them.
p153
aVWe don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.
p154
aVAnd for a long time, even after it was documented,
p155
aVit was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.
p156
aVScientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids
p157
aVthat explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency
p158
aVto see patterns where there are none.
p159
aVBut I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video,
p160
aVthat they really were very well synchronized.
p161
aa(lp162
VOkay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive
p163
aVto see this kind of spontaneous order,
p164
aVand I've already hinted that the answer is no.
p165
aVWell, you don't have to be a whole creature.
p166
aVYou can even be just a single cell.
p167
aVLike, take, for instance, your pacemaker cells in your heart right now.
p168
aVThey're keeping you alive.
p169
aVEvery beat of your heart depends on this crucial region, the sinoatrial node,
p170
aVwhich has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep,
p171
aVhave an electrical rhythm \u2014 a voltage up and down \u2014
p172
aVto send a signal to the ventricles to pump.
p173
aVNow, your pacemaker is not a single cell.
p174
aVIt's this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison
p175
aVfor the pacemaker to work correctly.
p176
aa(lp177
VI don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea.
p178
aVIf you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions,
p179
aVdischarging in pathological concert.
p180
aVSo this tendency towards order is not always a good thing.
p181
aVYou don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell.
p182
aVIf you look, for instance, at how lasers work,
p183
aVthat would be a case of atomic synchrony.
p184
aVIn a laser, what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here
p185
aVis that this light is incoherent \u2014
p186
aVmany different colors and different frequencies,
p187
aVsort of like the way you clapped initially \u2014
p188
aVbut if you were a laser, it would be rhythmic applause.
p189
aVIt would be all atoms pulsating in unison,
p190
aVemitting light of one color, one frequency.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow comes the very risky part of my talk,
p193
aVwhich is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize.
p194
aVHold your breath for me.
p195
aVWhat I have here are two empty water bottles.
p196
aVThis is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick.
p197
aVThis is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.
p198
aVI have some metronomes here.
p199
aVCan you hear that?
p200
aVAll right, so, I've got a metronome,
p201
aVand it's the world's smallest metronome, the \u2014 well, I shouldn't advertise.
p202
aVAnyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome.
p203
aVI've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take
p204
aVanother one set to the same setting.
p205
aVWe can try this first. If I just put them on the table together,
p206
aVthere's no reason for them to synchronize, and they probably won't.
p207
aa(lp208
VMaybe you'd better listen to them. I'll stand here.
p209
aVWhat I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart
p210
aVbecause their frequencies aren't perfectly the same.
p211
aVRight? They did.
p212
aVThey were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart.
p213
aVAnd the reason is that they're not able to communicate.
p214
aVNow, you might think that's a bizarre idea.
p215
aVHow can metronomes communicate?
p216
aVWell, they can communicate through mechanical forces.
p217
aVSo I'm going to give them a chance to do that.
p218
aVI also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate?
p219
aVI'm going to put them on a movable platform,
p220
aVwhich is the "Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell." Okay? So here it is.
p221
aVLet's see if we can get this to work.
p222
aVMy wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time
p223
aVbecause otherwise the whole thing will tip over.
p224
aVAll right. So there we go. Let's see. OK, I'm not trying to cheat \u2014
p225
aVlet me start them out of sync. No, hard to even do that.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VAll right. So before any one goes out of sync, I'll just put those right there.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aVNow, that might seem a bit whimsical,
p233
aVbut this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order
p234
aVsometimes has unexpected consequences.
p235
aVAnd a clear case of that,
p236
aVwas something that happened in London in the year 2000.
p237
aVThe Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London \u2014
p238
aVa beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames,
p239
aVfirst river crossing in over 100 years in London.
p240
aVThere was a big competition for the design of this bridge,
p241
aVand the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team \u2014
p242
aVin the TED spirit, actually \u2014 of an architect \u2014
p243
aVperhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster \u2014
p244
aVworking with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro,
p245
aVand an engineering firm, Ove Arup.
p246
aVAnd together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision,
p247
aVwhich was \u2014 he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books,
p248
aVand he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss,
p249
aVhe would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber.
p250
aa(lp251
VHe would shoot his light saber across the abyss, making a blade of light,
p252
aVand then scamper across on this blade of light.
p253
aVHe said, "That's the vision I want to give to London.
p254
aVI want a blade of light across the Thames."
p255
aVSo they built the blade of light,
p256
aVand it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's \u2014
p257
aVprobably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is,
p258
aVwith cables that are out on the side.
p259
aVYou're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.
p260
aVThese cables were on the side of the bridge,
p261
aVlike if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames \u2014
p262
aVthat's what's holding up this bridge.
p263
aVNow, everyone was very excited to try it out.
p264
aVOn opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.
p265
aVAnd within two days the bridge was closed to the public.
p266
aVSo I want to first show you some interviews with people
p267
aVwho were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.
p268
aa(lp269
VMan: It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down,
p270
aVrather like being on the boat.
p271
aa(lp272
VWoman: Yeah, it felt unstable, and it was very windy,
p273
aVand I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides, so you could definitely \u2014
p274
aVthere was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe.
p275
aa(lp276
VInterviewer: Not up and down? Boy: No.
p277
aa(lp278
VInterviewer: And not forwards and backwards? Boy: No.
p279
aa(lp280
VInterviewer: Just sideways. About how much was it moving, do you think?
p281
aa(lp282
VBoy: It was about \u2014
p283
aa(lp284
VInterviewer: I mean, that much, or this much?
p285
aa(lp286
VBoy: About the second one.
p287
aa(lp288
VInterviewer: This much? Boy: Yeah.
p289
aa(lp290
VMan: It was at least six, six to eight inches, I would have thought.
p291
aa(lp292
VInterviewer: Right, so, at least this much? Man: Oh, yes.
p293
aa(lp294
VWoman: I remember wanting to get off.
p295
aa(lp296
VInterviewer: Oh, did you? Woman: Yeah. It felt odd.
p297
aa(lp298
VInterviewer: So it was enough to be scary? Woman: Yeah, but I thought that was just me.
p299
aa(lp300
VInterviewer: Ah! Now, tell me why you had to do this?
p301
aa(lp302
VBoy: We had to do this because, to keep in balance
p303
aVbecause if you didn't keep your balance,
p304
aVthen you would just fall over about, like, to the left or right, about 45 degrees.
p305
aVInterviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right.
p306
aVAnd then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right.
p307
aVSo you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and \u2014
p308
aVoh, and short steps?
p309
aa(lp310
VMan: That's right. And it seemed obvious to me
p311
aVthat it was probably the number of people on it.
p312
aa(lp313
VInterviewer: Were they deliberately walking in step, or anything like that?
p314
aa(lp315
VMan: No, they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge.
p316
aa(lp317
VSteven Strogatz: All right, so that already gives you a hint of what happened.
p318
aVThink of the bridge as being like this platform.
p319
aVThink of the people as being like metronomes.
p320
aVNow, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome,
p321
aVbut after all, we do walk like \u2014 I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk.
p322
aVAnd especially if we start to walk like those people did, right?
p323
aVThey all showed this strange sort of skating gait
p324
aVthat they adopted once the bridge started to move.
p325
aVAnd so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.
p326
aVBut also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip
p327
aVof work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie,
p328
aVwho figured out what happened on the bridge,
p329
aVand who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was.
p330
aVIt was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop
p331
aVbetween the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move,
p332
aVthat engineers knew nothing about.
p333
aVActually, I think the first person you'll see
p334
aVis the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Video) Interviewer: Did anyone get hurt? Engineer: No.
p337
aa(lp338
VInterviewer: Right. So it was quite small \u2014 Engineer: Yes. Interviewer: \u2014 but real?
p339
aa(lp340
VEngineer: Absolutely. Interviewer: You thought, "Oh, bother."
p341
aa(lp342
VEngineer: I felt I was disappointed about it.
p343
aa(lp344
VWe'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it,
p345
aVwe'd checked it to codes \u2014 to heavier loads than the codes \u2014
p346
aVand here it was doing something that we didn't know about.
p347
aVInterviewer: You didn't expect. Engineer: Exactly.
p348
aa(lp349
VNarrator: The most dramatic and shocking footage
p350
aVshows whole sections of the crowd \u2014 hundreds of people \u2014
p351
aVapparently rocking from side to side in unison,
p352
aVnot only with each other, but with the bridge.
p353
aVThis synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge.
p354
aVBut how could the crowd become synchronized?
p355
aVWas there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect?
p356
aVThis was to be the focus of the investigation.
p357
aa(lp358
VInterviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble.
p359
aVNow, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes.
p360
aa(lp361
VInterviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge,
p362
aVand this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge?
p363
aa(lp364
VAM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes.
p365
aa(lp366
VInterviewer: Right. So if we get on it, we should be able to wobble it, yes?
p367
aa(lp368
VAllan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me,
p369
aVsuggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble
p370
aVin the same way as the real bridge \u2014
p371
aVprovided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length.
p372
aa(lp373
VAM: This one's only a couple of tons, so it's fairly easy to get going.
p374
aVJust by walking. Interviewer: Well, it's certainly going now.
p375
aa(lp376
VAM: It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go.
p377
aa(lp378
VInterviewer: It's actually quite difficult to walk.
p379
aVYou have to be careful where you put your feet down, don't you,
p380
aVbecause if you get it wrong, it just throws you off your feet.
p381
aa(lp382
VAM: It certainly affects the way you walk, yes. You can't walk normally on it.
p383
aa(lp384
VInterviewer: No. If you try and put one foot in front of another,
p385
aVit's moving your feet away from under you. AM: Yes.
p386
aa(lp387
VInterviewer: So you've got to put your feet out sideways.
p388
aVSo already, the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way
p389
aVas our witnesses walked on the real bridge.
p390
aa(lp391
VAM: ... ice-skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking.
p392
aa(lp393
VInterviewer: For a more convincing experiment,
p394
aVI wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team.
p395
aVTheir instructions: just walk normally.
p396
aVIt's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it.
p397
aVThey're all having some difficulty walking.
p398
aVAnd the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.
p399
aVBut then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.
p400
aVYou can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step,
p401
aVand therefore to drive it to move further.
p402
aa(lp403
VSS: All right, well, with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks,
p404

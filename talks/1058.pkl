VSome of the greatest innovations
p5
aVand developments in the world
p6
aVoften happen at the intersection of two fields.
p7
aVSo tonight I'd like to tell you
p8
aVabout the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment,
p9
aVwhich is entertainment and robotics.
p10
aVSo if we're trying to make robots
p11
aVthat can be more expressive
p12
aVand that can connect better with us in society,
p13
aVmaybe we should look to some of the human professionals
p14
aVof artificial emotion and personality
p15
aVthat occur in the dramatic arts.
p16
aVI'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts
p17
aVand to attract people
p18
aVto science and technology.
p19
aVSome people in the last decade or two
p20
aVhave started creating artwork with technology.
p21
aVWith my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot,
p22
aVI would like to use art to create tech.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VSo we're based in New York City.
p27
aVAnd if you're a performer that wants to collaborate
p28
aVwith an adorable robot,
p29
aVor if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation,
p30
aVplease contact me, the Bot-Agent.
p31
aVThe bot, our rising celebrity,
p32
aValso has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild.
p33
aVI'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.
p34
aVHe's named after the Star Trek character.
p35
aVI think he's going to be super popular.
p36
aVWe've got the robot \u2014
p37
aVin his head is a database of a lot of jokes.
p38
aVNow each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.
p39
aVSo it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.
p40
aVIt knows how much it's moving.
p41
aVAnd so it's going to try to watch your response.
p42
aVI actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VIt can also learn from you
p47
aVabout the quality of its jokes
p48
aVand cater things, sort of like Netflix-style,
p49
aVover longer-term
p50
aVto different communities or audiences,
p51
aVchildren versus adults, different cultures.
p52
aVYou can learn something from the robot
p53
aVabout the community that you're in.
p54
aVAnd also I can use each one of you as the acting coach
p55
aVto our future robot companions.
p56
aVSome of you in this middle section \u2014
p57
aVyou have red/green paddles.
p58
aVIf you like what's going on,
p59
aVshow the green.
p60
aVIf you don't like the subject or the performance,
p61
aVyou can hold the red.
p62
aVNow don't be shy.
p63
aVIt's just a robot.
p64
aVIt doesn't have feelings ... yet.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVAnd the rest of you,
p67
aVyou still count, you still matter.
p68
aVThere's also a microphone
p69
aVthat's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause
p70
aVand booing \u2014 I hope not \u2014
p71
aVto help make some of its next decisions.
p72
aVRight, so,
p73
aVlet the robot stand-up comedy begin.
p74
aa(lp75
VData: Hello TEDWomen.
p76
aVIt's an honor to be here.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause)
p81
aa(lp82
VYou guys are looking good out there.
p83
aVReady for some jokes?
p84
aa(lp85
VAudience: Yeah.
p86
aa(lp87
VData: Here's the first one.
p88
aVRight, so,
p89
aVa doctor says to his patient,
p90
aV"I have bad news and worse news.
p91
aVThe bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live."
p92
aV"That's terrible," said the patient.
p93
aV"How can the news possibly be worse?"
p94
aV"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
V(Applause)
p99
aa(lp100
VThe Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war.
p101
aVHeather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss.
p102
aVData: Pretty lucky for them.
p103
aVEver see that little Swiss Army knife
p104
aVthey have to fight with?
p105
aV"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here.
p106
aVYou get past me,
p107
aVthe guy behind me has a spoon."
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VHK: He's a French robot.
p112
aa(lp113
VData: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods.
p114
aVOne of them falls to the ground.
p115
aVHe does not seem to be breathing.
p116
aVThe other guy whips out his cell phone
p117
aVand calls 911.
p118
aVHe gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.
p119
aVWhat can I do?"
p120
aVThe operator says, "Just take it easy.
p121
aVI can help.
p122
aVFirst, let's make sure he's dead."
p123
aVThere is a silence,
p124
aVand the operator hears a shot.
p125
aVThe guy's voice comes back on the line,
p126
aV"Okay, now what?"
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VQuestion: Why is television called a medium?
p133
aVAnyone?
p134
aVBecause it's neither rare nor well done.
p135
aVBut to be completely honest with you,
p136
aVI kind of love television.
p137
aVAny of you like television? Audience: Yes.
p138
aVData: I find it incredibly educational.
p139
aVActually, as soon as someone turns it on,
p140
aVI go into the other room and read.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aVThat's all for now.
p143
aVWas that okay for my first time?
p144
aa(lp145
V(Applause)
p146
aa(lp147
VYou've been a great audience.
p148
aVThank you.
p149
aa(lp150
VHK: Yay.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VSo this is actually the first time
p155
aVwe've ever done live audience feedback to a performance.
p156
aVSo thank you all for being a part of it.
p157
aVThere's a lot more to come.
p158
aVAnd we hope to learn a lot about robot expression.
p159
aa(lp160
VThank you very much.

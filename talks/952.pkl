VI am a cultural omnivore,
p5
aVone whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod \u2014
p6
aVan iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart,
p7
aVpop diva Christina Aguilera,
p8
aVcountry singer Josh Turner,
p9
aVgangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin,
p10
aVconcerti, symphonies and more and more.
p11
aVI'm a voracious reader,
p12
aVa reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer.
p13
aVI have read the Twilight tetralogy.
p14
aVAnd one who lives for my home theater,
p15
aVa home theater where I devour DVDs, video on demand
p16
aVand a lot of television.
p17
aVFor me, "Law & Order: SVU," Tina Fey and "30 Rock"
p18
aVand "Judge Judy" \u2014
p19
aV"The people are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final."
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions,
p24
aVespecially my passion for "Judge Judy,"
p25
aVand you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us,
p26
aVbut I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life,
p27
aVa passion for the live professional performing arts,
p28
aVperforming arts that represent the orchestral repertoire, yes,
p29
aVbut jazz as well, modern dance, opera,
p30
aVtheater and more and more and more.
p31
aa(lp32
VFrankly, it's a sector that many of us who work in the field
p33
aVworry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology.
p34
aVWhile we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device
p35
aVthat was going to solve all our problems,
p36
aVwe now realize that the Internet is, if anything,
p37
aVtoo effective in that regard.
p38
aVDepending on who you read, an arts organization
p39
aVor an artist, who tries to attract the attention
p40
aVof a potential single ticket buyer,
p41
aVnow competes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages
p42
aVa typical citizen sees every single day.
p43
aVWe now know, in fact,
p44
aVthat technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time.
p45
aVFive years ago,
p46
aVGen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV, the majority on TV.
p47
aVGen Yers spent even more \u2014
p48
aV23.8 hours, the majority online.
p49
aVAnd now, a typical university-entering student arrives at college
p50
aValready having spent 20,000 hours online
p51
aVand an additional 10,000 hours playing video games \u2014
p52
aVa stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context
p53
aVwhere video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined.
p54
aa(lp55
VMoreover, we're afraid that technology
p56
aVhas altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption.
p57
aVThanks to the Internet,
p58
aVwe believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it,
p59
aVdelivered to our own doorstep.
p60
aVWe can shop at three in the morning or eight at night,
p61
aVordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types.
p62
aVExpectations of personalization and customization
p63
aVthat the live performing arts \u2014
p64
aVwhich have set curtain times, set venues,
p65
aVattendant inconveniences of travel, parking and the like \u2014
p66
aVsimply cannot meet.
p67
aVAnd we're all acutely aware:
p68
aVwhat's it going to mean in the future
p69
aVwhen we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars
p70
aVfor a symphony, opera or ballet ticket,
p71
aVwhen that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet
p72
aV24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free?
p73
aVThese are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain.
p74
aVBut as particular as they feel to us, we know we're not alone.
p75
aa(lp76
VAll of us are engaged
p77
aVin a seismic, fundamental realignment of culture and communications,
p78
aVa realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry,
p79
aVthe magazine industry, the book and publishing industry and more.
p80
aVSaddled in the performing arts as we are, by antiquated union agreements
p81
aVthat inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming,
p82
aVlocked into large facilities that were designed to ossify
p83
aVthe ideal relationship between artist and audience
p84
aVmost appropriate to the 19th century
p85
aVand locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues,
p86
aVwhere we charge exorbitant prices.
p87
aVMany of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records
p88
aVand ask ourselves, "Are we next?"
p89
aVEveryone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich,
p90
aVwho, in "Dreams of a Common Language," wrote,
p91
aV"We are out in a country that has no language, no laws.
p92
aVWhatever we do together is pure invention.
p93
aVThe maps they gave us are out of date by years."
p94
aVAnd for those of you who love the arts,
p95
aVaren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day?
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
V(Applause)
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation,
p102
aVI prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation,
p103
aVa reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century.
p104
aVThe arts reformation, like the religious Reformation,
p105
aVis spurred in part by technology,
p106
aVwith indeed, the printing press really leading the charge
p107
aVon the religious Reformation.
p108
aVBoth reformations were predicated on fractious discussion,
p109
aVinternal self-doubt
p110
aVand massive realignment of antiquated business models.
p111
aVAnd at heart, both reformations, I think, were asking the questions:
p112
aVwho's entitled to practice?
p113
aVHow are they entitled to practice?
p114
aVAnd indeed, do we need anyone to intermediate for us
p115
aVin order to have an experience with a spiritual divine?
p116
aa(lp117
VChris Anderson, someone I trust you all know,
p118
aVeditor in chief of Wired magazine and author of The Long Tail,
p119
aVreally was the first, for me, to nail a lot of this.
p120
aVHe wrote a long time ago, you know,
p121
aVthanks to the invention of the Internet, web technology, minicams and more,
p122
aVthe means of artistic production have been democratized
p123
aVfor the first time in all of human history.
p124
aVIn the 1930s, if any of you wanted to make a movie,
p125
aVyou had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO,
p126
aVbecause who could afford a movie set
p127
aVand lighting equipment and editing equipment
p128
aVand scoring, and more?
p129
aVAnd now who in this room doesn't know a 14 year-old
p130
aVhard at work on her second, third, or fourth movie?
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VSimilarly, the means of artistic distribution
p135
aVhave been democratized for the first time in human history.
p136
aVAgain, in the '30s, Warner Brothers, RKO did that for you.
p137
aVNow, go to YouTube, Facebook;
p138
aVyou have worldwide distribution
p139
aVwithout leaving the privacy of your own bedroom.
p140
aa(lp141
VThis double impact is occasioning
p142
aVa massive redefinition of the cultural market,
p143
aVa time when anyone is a potential author.
p144
aVFrankly, what we're seeing now in this environment
p145
aVis a massive time, when the entire world is changing
p146
aVas we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting.
p147
aVBut the number of arts participants,
p148
aVpeople who write poetry, who sing songs, who perform in church choirs,
p149
aVis exploding beyond our wildest imaginations.
p150
aVThis group, others have called the pro-ams,
p151
aVamateur artists doing work at a professional level.
p152
aVYou see them on YouTube, in dance competitions,
p153
aVfilm festivals and more.
p154
aVThey are radically expanding
p155
aVour notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary,
p156
aVwhile they are challenging and undermining
p157
aVthe cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions.
p158
aVUltimately, we now live in a world defined not by consumption,
p159
aVbut by participation.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut I want to be clear,
p162
aVjust as the religious Reformation did not spell the end
p163
aVto the formal Church or to the priesthood;
p164
aVI believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance.
p165
aVThey currently are the best opportunities
p166
aVfor artists to have lives of economic dignity \u2014
p167
aVnot opulence, of dignity.
p168
aVAnd they are the places where artists
p169
aVwho deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources
p170
aVwill find a home.
p171
aVBut to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community
p172
aVis, by far, too shortsighted.
p173
aVAnd indeed, while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional,
p174
aVthe single most exciting development in the last five to 10 years
p175
aVhas been the rise of the professional hybrid artist,
p176
aVthe professional artist who works,
p177
aVnot primarily in the concert hall or on the stage;
p178
aVbut most frequently around women's rights, or human rights,
p179
aVor on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more \u2014
p180
aVnot out of economic necessity,
p181
aVbut out of a deep, organic conviction
p182
aVthat the work that she or he is called to do
p183
aVcannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment.
p184
aa(lp185
VToday's dance world is not defined solely
p186
aVby the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada,
p187
aVbut by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange \u2014
p188
aVa multi-generational, professional dance company,
p189
aVwhose dancers range in age from 18 to 82,
p190
aVand who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand
p191
aVand with nuclear physicists at CERN.
p192
aVToday's professional theater community
p193
aVis defined, not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals,
p194
aVbut by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles \u2014
p195
aVa collective of artists that after 9/11,
p196
aVbrought together 10 different religious communities \u2014
p197
aVthe Baha'i, the Catholic,
p198
aVthe Muslim, the Jewish,
p199
aVeven the Native American
p200
aVand the gay and lesbian communities of faith,
p201
aVhelping them create their own individual plays
p202
aVand one massive play,
p203
aVwhere they explored the differences in their faith
p204
aVand found commonality
p205
aVas an important first step toward cross-community healing.
p206
aVToday's performers, like Rhodessa Jones, work in women's prisons,
p207
aVhelping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration,
p208
aVwhile today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs
p209
aVto find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more.
p210
aVAnd indeed, I think, rather than being annihilated,
p211
aVthe performing arts are poised on the brink of a time
p212
aVwhen we will be more important than we have ever been.
p213
aa(lp214
VYou know, we've said for a long time,
p215
aVwe are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town.
p216
aVAnd absolutely \u2014
p217
aVI hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community
p218
aVgenerates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy,
p219
aVdollars spent in restaurants or on parking,
p220
aVat the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes,
p221
aVthe piano tuner who tunes the instruments, and more.
p222
aVBut the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward,
p223
aVespecially in industries we can't even imagine yet,
p224
aVjust as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries,
p225
aVwhich few, if any of us, could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago.
p226
aVBusiness leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence,
p227
aVthe ability to listen deeply,
p228
aVto have empathy,
p229
aVto articulate change, to motivate others \u2014
p230
aVthe very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter.
p231
aa(lp232
VEspecially now,
p233
aVas we all must confront the fallacy of a market-only orientation,
p234
aVuninformed by social conscience;
p235
aVwe must seize and celebrate the power of the arts
p236
aVto shape our individual and national characters,
p237
aVand especially characters of the young people,
p238
aVwho all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation,
p239
aVrather than digested experience.
p240
aVUltimately, especially now in this world,
p241
aVwhere we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws,
p242
aVin reality TV that thrives on humiliation,
p243
aVand in a context of analysis,
p244
aVwhere the thing we hear most repeatedly, day in, day out in the United States,
p245
aVin every train station, every bus station, every plane station is,
p246
aV"Ladies and gentlemen,
p247
aVplease report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals
p248
aVto the authorities nearest to you,"
p249
aVwhen all of these ways we are encouraged
p250
aVto view our fellow human being with hostility and fear
p251
aVand contempt and suspicion.
p252
aa(lp253
VThe arts, whatever they do, whenever they call us together,
p254
aVinvite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity.
p255
aVGod knows, if we ever needed that capacity in human history,
p256
aVwe need it now.
p257
aVYou know, we're bound together,
p258
aVnot, I think by technology, entertainment and design,
p259
aVbut by common cause.
p260
aVWe work to promote healthy vibrant societies,
p261
aVto ameliorate human suffering,
p262
aVto promote a more thoughtful, substantive, empathic world order.
p263
aa(lp264
VI salute all of you as activists in that quest
p265
aVand urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work,
p266
aVwhatever your purpose may be.
p267
aVI promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation
p268
aVis stretched out in friendship for now and years to come.
p269
aVAnd I thank you for your kindness and your patience
p270
aVin listening to me this afternoon.
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you, and Godspeed.

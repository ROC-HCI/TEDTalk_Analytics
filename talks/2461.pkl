VThousands of years from now,
p5
aVwe'll look back at the first century of computing
p6
aVas a fascinating but very peculiar time \u2014
p7
aVthe only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2D space,
p8
aVinteracting with technology as if we were machines;
p9
aVa singular, 100-year period in the vastness of time
p10
aVwhere humans communicated,
p11
aVwere entertained and managed their lives
p12
aVfrom behind a screen.
p13
aa(lp14
VToday, we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens.
p15
aVWhat happened to interacting with each other?
p16
aVI don't know about you, but I feel limited
p17
aVinside this 2D world of monitors and pixels.
p18
aVAnd it is this very limitation
p19
aVand my desire to connect with people
p20
aVthat inspires me as a creator.
p21
aVPut simply: I want to create a new reality,
p22
aVa reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other,
p23
aVa reality where people, not devices,
p24
aVare the center of everything.
p25
aa(lp26
VI dream of a reality where technology senses what we see, touch and feel;
p27
aVa reality where technology no longer gets in our way,
p28
aVbut instead embraces who we are.
p29
aVI dream of technology
p30
aVon a human path.
p31
aVWe have all experienced technology
p32
aVthat enables people to act more like people,
p33
aVproducts that enable natural interactions, voice controls or biometrics.
p34
aa(lp35
VThis is the next step in the evolution.
p36
aVThis is Microsoft HoloLens,
p37
aVthe first fully untethered holographic computer.
p38
aVDevices like this will bring 3D holographic content
p39
aVright into our world,
p40
aVenhancing the way we experience life
p41
aVbeyond our ordinary range of perceptions.
p42
aVNow, I'm not thinking about a distant future.
p43
aVI'm talking about today.
p44
aVWe are already seeing car companies like Volvo
p45
aVdesigning cars differently with HoloLens;
p46
aVuniversities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn;
p47
aVand my personal favorite,
p48
aVNASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets
p49
aVholographically.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, this is important.
p52
aVBy bringing holograms into our world,
p53
aVI'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer.
p54
aVI'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines
p55
aVof traditional computing.
p56
aa(lp57
VPut it this way:
p58
aVtemporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms.
p59
aVWe've barely discovered charcoal
p60
aVand started drawing the first stick figures in our cave.
p61
aVNow, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day.
p62
aVAnd now for the next few minutes,
p63
aVI invite all of you to apply the same perspective
p64
aVto the journey ahead of us.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, as I put this HoloLens on,
p67
aVlet me explain the setup a little bit.
p68
aVIt's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage
p69
aVwith HoloLens,
p70
aVand I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED.
p71
aVMomentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms
p72
aVright on this stage,
p73
aVjust as clearly as I can see all of you.
p74
aVNow at the same time, we have also this special camera
p75
aVthat just walked in onstage
p76
aVso that all of you can share in this experience with me
p77
aVup on all the monitors.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo let's start our journey.
p80
aVAnd what better place to begin our journey,
p81
aVthan in the computer cave of 2D.
p82
aVLet's explore the world all around us with this new lens,
p83
aVand understand the computer world from a brand new perspective.
p84
aa(lp85
VThe computer universe is both marvelous and primitive.
p86
aVIt's a universe based on causality.
p87
aVAs developers, we dream the different causes
p88
aVand then we program the different effects.
p89
aVDouble click on an icon, that's a cause.
p90
aVOpen an application, that's an effect.
p91
aVNow when we compare this to our physical universe,
p92
aVit is overly constraining,
p93
aVbecause our universe is not digital.
p94
aVOur universe is analog.
p95
aVOur universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one,
p96
aVtrue or false, or black or white.
p97
aVWe exist in a world governed by quantum physics,
p98
aVa universe of zero and one both at the same time,
p99
aVa reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray.
p100
aVYou can see how these two worlds collide.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo why are screens so pervasive in our analog life?
p103
aVWe see screens from the moment we wake up,
p104
aVto the moment we fall asleep.
p105
aVWhy?
p106
aa(lp107
VI think it's because computers give us superpowers.
p108
aVWithin the digital universe, we have the power to displace space
p109
aVand the power to displace time.
p110
aVIt doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment,
p111
aVproductivity or communication.
p112
aVThink of it this way:
p113
aVlet's all go home tonight
p114
aVand watch our favorite show on television.
p115
aVThis is theater \u2014 time and space displaced.
p116
aVAs soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,
p117
aVI'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle.
p118
aVThat's displacement of space.
p119
aVNow, these are such great superpowers
p120
aVthat we put up with the two-dimensional limitations
p121
aVof our current digital world.
p122
aVBut what if we didn't have to?
p123
aVWhat if we could have these same digital powers
p124
aVin our world?
p125
aVYou can already see glimmers of this,
p126
aVbut I believe our children's children
p127
aVwill grow up in a world devoid of 2D technology.
p128
aVIt's remarkable to dream of this world,
p129
aVa world where technology truly understands us \u2014
p130
aVwhere we live, work and communicate \u2014
p131
aVwith tools that enhance the human experience,
p132
aVnot machines that limit our humanity.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo how do we get there?
p135
aVFor me, the answer required looking at the problem
p136
aVfrom a different perspective.
p137
aVIt required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine.
p138
aVIf you're a machine trying to sense our world,
p139
aVhow would you actually break the problem down?
p140
aVYou'd probably try to classify things
p141
aVas a human,
p142
aVan environment
p143
aVor an object.
p144
aVBut how would that machine then interact with reality?
p145
aVAnd I can think of three ways.
p146
aa(lp147
VFirst, as a machine,
p148
aVI would observe or I would input reality.
p149
aVSpeech recognition and biometric authentication
p150
aVare great examples of a machine interacting with humans
p151
aVfrom an input perspective.
p152
aVSecondly, as a machine,
p153
aVI could place digital information, or output information,
p154
aVinto reality.
p155
aVHolograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment
p156
aVfrom an output perspective.
p157
aVFinally, as a machine,
p158
aVI could exchange energy with the world via haptics.
p159
aVNow, imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object,
p160
aVor better yet, imagine pushing a hologram
p161
aVand having it push you back with equal force.
p162
aa(lp163
VWith this perspective,
p164
aVwe are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix.
p165
aVNow here's a secret:
p166
aVas an engineer, I get really excited
p167
aVanytime I can reduce something to the matrix.
p168
aVFrom self-driving cars
p169
aVto smartphones
p170
aVto this holographic computer on my head,
p171
aVmachines are becoming capable of understanding our world.
p172
aVAnd they are starting to interact with us
p173
aVin significantly more personal ways.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, imagine having granular control
p176
aVover everything in the world.
p177
aVMove the dial one way,
p178
aVand you get reality.
p179
aVMove the dial the other way,
p180
aVand you get virtual reality.
p181
aVNow, imagine dialing your entire environment
p182
aVbetween virtual and real worlds.
p183
aVI love it down here.
p184
aVNow, imagine if I could look at all of you
p185
aVand dial from real humans into elves.
p186
aVWhen technology truly understands our world,
p187
aVit will again transform the ways we interact,
p188
aVthe ways we work and the ways we play.
p189
aa(lp190
VLess than half a century ago,
p191
aVtwo courageous men landed on the moon,
p192
aVusing computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets.
p193
aVSix hundred million humans watched them
p194
aVon grainy, black-and-white televisions.
p195
aVAnd the world?
p196
aVThe world was mesmerized.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow imagine how our children and their children
p199
aVwill experience the continued exploration of space
p200
aVwith technology that understands this world.
p201
aVWe already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist.
p202
aVAnd I can squint, and I can already see holographic telepresence
p203
aVin our near future.
p204
aVIn fact, since we've been lucky with our demo so far,
p205
aVlet's try doing something else even more crazy.
p206
aVI invite you to experience,
p207
aVfor the first time anywhere in the world,
p208
aVhere on the TED stage,
p209
aVa real-life holographic teleportation,
p210
aVbetween me and my friend, Dr. Jeffrey Norris,
p211
aVfrom NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
p212
aa(lp213
VFinger crossed. Hi, Jeff.
p214
aa(lp215
VJeff Norris: Hey, Alex.
p216
aa(lp217
VAlex Kipman: Phew! That worked. How are you doing today, Jeff?
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VJN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.
p222
aa(lp223
VAK: So, can you tell us a little bit, Jeff, about where you are?
p224
aa(lp225
VJN: Well, I'm actually in three places.
p226
aVI'm standing in a room across the street,
p227
aVwhile I'm standing on this stage with you,
p228
aVwhile I'm standing on Mars, a hundred million miles away.
p229
aa(lp230
VAK: Wow, a hundred million miles away. This is crazy!
p231
aVCan you tell us a little bit more about where all this data
p232
aVfrom Mars is coming from?
p233
aa(lp234
VJN: Absolutely.
p235
aVThis is a precise holographic replica of Mars,
p236
aVbuilt from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover,
p237
aVthat I can explore as easily as a place on Earth.
p238
aVHumans are natural explorers.
p239
aVWe can instantly understand an environment,
p240
aVjust by being present in it.
p241
aVWe've built tools like our Mars Rover
p242
aVto extend our vision and lengthen our reach.
p243
aVBut for decades,
p244
aVwe've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards.
p245
aVNow, we're leaping over all of that,
p246
aVover the giant antennas and the relay satellites
p247
aVand the vastness between worlds
p248
aVto take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there.
p249
aVToday, a group of scientists on our mission
p250
aVare seeing Mars as never before \u2014
p251
aVan alien world made a little more familiar,
p252
aVbecause they're finally exploring it as humans should.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there.
p255
aVWhen we dial this real world to the virtual,
p256
aVwe can do magical things.
p257
aVWe can see in invisible wavelengths
p258
aVor teleport to the top of a mountain.
p259
aVPerhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it.
p260
aVWe're taking the first steps.
p261
aVBut we want the whole world to join us in taking the next,
p262
aVbecause this is not a journey for a few,
p263
aVbut for all of us.
p264
aa(lp265
VAK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.
p266
aVThank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
VJN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.
p271
aa(lp272
VAK: Bye, Jeff.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Applause)
p275
aa(lp276
VI dream about this future
p277
aVevery single day.
p278
aVI take inspiration from our ancestors.
p279
aVWe used to live in tribes where we interacted,
p280
aVcommunicated and worked together.
p281
aVWe are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return
p282
aVto the humanity that brought us where we are today \u2014
p283
aVtechnology that will let us stop living inside this 2D world
p284
aVof monitors and pixels,
p285
aVand let us start remembering what it feels like
p286
aVto live in our 3D world.
p287
aVIt's a phenomenal time to be human.
p288
aa(lp289
VThank you.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Applause)
p292
aa(lp293
VHelen Walters: Thanks so much. I have some questions.
p294
aa(lp295
VAK: OK.
p296
aa(lp297
VHW: So there's been some talk in the press.
p298
aVAnd I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer.
p299
aVThere's been talk about the difference between the demos
p300
aVand the reality of the commercial product.
p301
aVTalk about this field of view issue.
p302
aVIs this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get?
p303
aa(lp304
VAK: It's a great question,
p305
aVOr, said better, this is a question we've been receiving
p306
aVin the media for possibly the last year.
p307
aVIf you do your research, I haven't answered that question.
p308
aVI've purposely ignored it,
p309
aVbecause ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask.
p310
aVThat's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time,
p311
aVand you then saying, "What's the size of your television?"
p312
aVThe field of view for the product is almost irrelevant.
p313
aVWhat we should be talking about is the density of lights,
p314
aVor radiance, that shows up.
p315
aVBetter said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see.
p316
aVSo from that perspective, what you saw \u2014
p317
aVyou know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens.
p318
aVSo even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.
p319
aa(lp320
VHW: But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right?
p321
aa(lp322
VAK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.
p323
aVIt's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is.
p324
aVSo if you think about the points of light that show up radially
p325
aVfrom the vision of the camera,
p326
aVwhich is the thing that matters:
p327
aVhow many points of light can I get in a given volume?
p328
aVThat's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one.
p329
aVNow, this camera sees a much wider view of the world, right?
p330
aa(lp331
VHW: Jesus Christ!
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VAK: He did show up! I told you he'd show up.
p336
aVCome this way.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VHW: Oh, shit.
p341
aa(lp342
VAK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.
p343
aa(lp344
VHW: I knew something was happening, but I really wasn't sure what.
p345
aa(lp346
VAK: So in short: to be super crisp,
p347
aVthe camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view
p348
aVthan the human eye.
p349
aVBut the angular resolution of the holograms that you see,
p350
aVthe points of light per unit of area,
p351
aVare actually the same.
p352
aa(lp353
VHW: So you spent \u2014 Jeff, I'll get to you in a minute \u2014
p354
aVso you spent a lot of time mapping the stage \u2014
p355
aa(lp356
VAK: That's right.
p357
aa(lp358
VHW: So help me out here:
p359
aVif I buy a HoloLens and have it at home,
p360
aVI don't need to map my apartment, right?
p361
aa(lp362
VAK: The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second,
p363
aVwith this technology that we call spatial mapping.
p364
aVSo in your home, as soon as you put it on,
p365
aVholograms will start showing up, and you'll start placing them
p366
aVand they'll start learning your home.
p367
aVIn a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head
p368
aVto communicate with something over there
p369
aVwith all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down,
p370
aVwe don't take the risk of trying to do this live.
p371
aVSo what we do is pre-map the stage at five frames per second
p372
aVwith the same spatial-mapping technology
p373
aVthat you'll use with the product at home,
p374
aVand then we store it,
p375
aVso that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this,
p376
aVbetween the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head,
p377
aVwe don't have things disappear.
p378
aVBecause ultimately, the holograms are coming from this HoloLens,
p379
aVand that one is just viewing the HoloLens.
p380
aVSo if I lose connectivity,
p381
aVyou would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen.
p382
aa(lp383
VHW: And it was beautiful.
p384
aVUm ... Jeff?
p385
aa(lp386
VJN: Yes?
p387
aa(lp388
VHW: Hi.
p389
aa(lp390
VAK: I'll take a step back.
p391
aa(lp392
VHW: So Jeff, you were on Mars,
p393
aVyou were here, you were in a room across the street.
p394
aVTell me more about the fact that, with holograms, you have sight
p395
aVbut you don't have touch, you don't have smell.
p396
aVIs this scientifically useful now?
p397
aVThat's my question for a hologram.
p398
aa(lp399
VJN: Thanks for the question.
p400
aVAbsolutely, I believe that these technologies
p401
aVare scientifically useful right now,
p402
aVand that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA.
p403
aVSo we're using it to improve the ways that we explore Mars.
p404
aVWe're also using it for our astronauts on the space station.
p405
aVWe're even using it now to design
p406
aVthe next generation of our spacecraft.
p407
aa(lp408
VHW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away. Thank you very much.
p409
aa(lp410
V(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
VAlex, really, that was amazing. Thank you so much.
p413
aa(lp414
VAK: Thank you.
p415
aa(lp416
VHW: Thank you. Thank you.

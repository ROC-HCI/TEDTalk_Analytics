VWhy do we cheat?
p5
aVAnd why do happy people cheat?
p6
aVAnd when we say "infidelity," what exactly do we mean?
p7
aVIs it a hookup, a love story, paid sex, a chat room,
p8
aVa massage with a happy ending?
p9
aVWhy do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy,
p10
aVbut women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy?
p11
aVAnd is an affair always the end of a relationship?
p12
aa(lp13
VFor the past 10 years, I have traveled the globe
p14
aVand worked extensively with hundreds of couples
p15
aVwho have been shattered by infidelity.
p16
aVThere is one simple act of transgression
p17
aVthat can rob a couple of their relationship,
p18
aVtheir happiness and their very identity: an affair.
p19
aVAnd yet, this extremely common act is so poorly understood.
p20
aVSo this talk is for anyone who has ever loved.
p21
aa(lp22
VAdultery has existed since marriage was invented,
p23
aVand so, too, the taboo against it.
p24
aVIn fact, infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy,
p25
aVso much so, that this is the only commandment
p26
aVthat is repeated twice in the Bible:
p27
aVonce for doing it, and once just for thinking about it.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVSo how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden,
p30
aVyet universally practiced?
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, throughout history, men practically had a license to cheat
p33
aVwith little consequence,
p34
aVand supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories
p35
aVthat justified their need to roam,
p36
aVso the double standard is as old as adultery itself.
p37
aVBut who knows what's really going on under the sheets there, right?
p38
aVBecause when it comes to sex,
p39
aVthe pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate,
p40
aVbut the pressure for women is to hide, minimize and deny,
p41
aVwhich isn't surprising when you consider that there are still nine countries
p42
aVwhere women can be killed for straying.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, monogamy used to be one person for life.
p45
aVToday, monogamy is one person at a time.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aV(Applause)
p48
aa(lp49
VI mean, many of you probably have said,
p50
aV"I am monogamous in all my relationships."
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VWe used to marry,
p54
aVand had sex for the first time.
p55
aVBut now we marry,
p56
aVand we stop having sex with others.
p57
aVThe fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love.
p58
aVMen relied on women's fidelity
p59
aVin order to know whose children these are,
p60
aVand who gets the cows when I die.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, everyone wants to know
p63
aVwhat percentage of people cheat.
p64
aVI've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVIt applies to you.
p67
aVBut the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding:
p68
aVsexting, watching porn, staying secretly active on dating apps.
p69
aVSo because there is no universally agreed-upon definition
p70
aVof what even constitutes an infidelity,
p71
aVestimates vary widely, from 26 percent to 75 percent.
p72
aVBut on top of it, we are walking contradictions.
p73
aVSo 95 percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong
p74
aVfor our partner to lie about having an affair,
p75
aVbut just about the same amount of us will say
p76
aVthat that's exactly what we would do if we were having one.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, I like this definition of an affair \u2014
p80
aVit brings together the three key elements:
p81
aVa secretive relationship, which is the core structure of an affair;
p82
aVan emotional connection to one degree or another;
p83
aVand a sexual alchemy.
p84
aVAnd alchemy is the key word here,
p85
aVbecause the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving,
p86
aVcan be as powerful and as enchanting
p87
aVas hours of actual lovemaking.
p88
aVAs Marcel Proust said,
p89
aVit's our imagination that is responsible for love, not the other person.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo it's never been easier to cheat,
p92
aVand it's never been more difficult to keep a secret.
p93
aVAnd never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll.
p94
aVWhen marriage was an economic enterprise,
p95
aVinfidelity threatened our economic security.
p96
aVBut now that marriage is a romantic arrangement,
p97
aVinfidelity threatens our emotional security.
p98
aVIronically, we used to turn to adultery \u2014
p99
aVthat was the space where we sought pure love.
p100
aVBut now that we seek love in marriage,
p101
aVadultery destroys it.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, there are three ways that I think infidelity hurts differently today.
p104
aVWe have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person
p105
aVto fulfill an endless list of needs:
p106
aVto be my greatest lover, my best friend,
p107
aVthe best parent, my trusted confidant,
p108
aVmy emotional companion, my intellectual equal.
p109
aVAnd I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,
p110
aVI'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,
p111
aVI'm the one.
p112
aVAnd infidelity tells me I'm not.
p113
aVIt is the ultimate betrayal.
p114
aVInfidelity shatters the grand ambition of love.
p115
aVBut if throughout history, infidelity has always been painful,
p116
aVtoday it is often traumatic,
p117
aVbecause it threatens our sense of self.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo my patient Fernando, he's plagued.
p120
aVHe goes on: "I thought I knew my life.
p121
aVI thought I knew who you were, who we were as a couple, who I was.
p122
aVNow, I question everything."
p123
aVInfidelity \u2014 a violation of trust, a crisis of identity.
p124
aV"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.
p125
aV"Can I ever trust anyone again?"
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd this is also what my patient Heather is telling me,
p128
aVwhen she's talking to me about her story with Nick.
p129
aVMarried, two kids.
p130
aVNick just left on a business trip,
p131
aVand Heather is playing on his iPad with the boys,
p132
aVwhen she sees a message appear on the screen:
p133
aV"Can't wait to see you."
p134
aVStrange, she thinks, we just saw each other.
p135
aVAnd then another message:
p136
aV"Can't wait to hold you in my arms."
p137
aVAnd Heather realizes
p138
aVthese are not for her.
p139
aVShe also tells me that her father had affairs,
p140
aVbut her mother, she found one little receipt in the pocket,
p141
aVand a little bit of lipstick on the collar.
p142
aVHeather, she goes digging,
p143
aVand she finds hundreds of messages,
p144
aVand photos exchanged and desires expressed.
p145
aVThe vivid details of Nick's two-year affair
p146
aVunfold in front of her in real time,
p147
aVAnd it made me think:
p148
aVAffairs in the digital age are death by a thousand cuts.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut then we have another paradox that we're dealing with these days.
p151
aVBecause of this romantic ideal,
p152
aVwe are relying on our partner's fidelity with a unique fervor.
p153
aVBut we also have never been more inclined to stray,
p154
aVand not because we have new desires today,
p155
aVbut because we live in an era
p156
aVwhere we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires,
p157
aVbecause this is the culture where I deserve to be happy.
p158
aVAnd if we used to divorce because we were unhappy,
p159
aVtoday we divorce because we could be happier.
p160
aVAnd if divorce carried all the shame,
p161
aVtoday, choosing to stay when you can leave
p162
aVis the new shame.
p163
aVSo Heather, she can't talk to her friends
p164
aVbecause she's afraid that they will judge her for still loving Nick,
p165
aVand everywhere she turns, she gets the same advice:
p166
aVLeave him. Throw the dog on the curb.
p167
aVAnd if the situation were reversed, Nick would be in the same situation.
p168
aVStaying is the new shame.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo if we can divorce,
p171
aVwhy do we still have affairs?
p172
aVNow, the typical assumption is that if someone cheats,
p173
aVeither there's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you.
p174
aVBut millions of people can't all be pathological.
p175
aVThe logic goes like this: If you have everything you need at home,
p176
aVthen there is no need to go looking elsewhere,
p177
aVassuming that there is such a thing as a perfect marriage
p178
aVthat will inoculate us against wanderlust.
p179
aVBut what if passion has a finite shelf life?
p180
aVWhat if there are things that even a good relationship
p181
aVcan never provide?
p182
aVIf even happy people cheat,
p183
aVwhat is it about?
p184
aa(lp185
VThe vast majority of people that I actually work with
p186
aVare not at all chronic philanderers.
p187
aVThey are often people who are deeply monogamous in their beliefs,
p188
aVand at least for their partner.
p189
aVBut they find themselves in a conflict
p190
aVbetween their values and their behavior.
p191
aVThey often are people who have actually been faithful for decades,
p192
aVbut one day they cross a line
p193
aVthat they never thought they would cross,
p194
aVand at the risk of losing everything.
p195
aVBut for a glimmer of what?
p196
aVAffairs are an act of betrayal,
p197
aVand they are also an expression of longing and loss.
p198
aVAt the heart of an affair, you will often find
p199
aVa longing and a yearning for an emotional connection,
p200
aVfor novelty, for freedom, for autonomy, for sexual intensity,
p201
aVa wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves
p202
aVor an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.
p203
aa(lp204
VI'm thinking about another patient of mine, Priya,
p205
aVwho is blissfully married,
p206
aVloves her husband,
p207
aVand would never want to hurt the man.
p208
aVBut she also tells me
p209
aVthat she's always done what was expected of her:
p210
aVgood girl, good wife, good mother,
p211
aVtaking care of her immigrant parents.
p212
aVPriya, she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard
p213
aVafter Hurricane Sandy.
p214
aVAnd with his truck and his tattoos, he's quite the opposite of her.
p215
aVBut at 47, Priya's affair is about the adolescence that she never had.
p216
aVAnd her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaze of another,
p217
aVit isn't always our partner that we are turning away from,
p218
aVbut the person that we have ourselves become.
p219
aVAnd it isn't so much that we're looking for another person,
p220
aVas much as we are looking for another self.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, all over the world,
p223
aVthere is one word that people who have affairs always tell me.
p224
aVThey feel alive.
p225
aVAnd they often will tell me stories of recent losses \u2014
p226
aVof a parent who died,
p227
aVand a friend that went too soon,
p228
aVand bad news at the doctor.
p229
aVDeath and mortality often live in the shadow of an affair,
p230
aVbecause they raise these questions.
p231
aVIs this it? Is there more?
p232
aVAm I going on for another 25 years like this?
p233
aVWill I ever feel that thing again?
p234
aVAnd it has led me to think that perhaps these questions
p235
aVare the ones that propel people to cross the line,
p236
aVand that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness,
p237
aVin an antidote to death.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd contrary to what you may think,
p240
aVaffairs are way less about sex, and a lot more about desire:
p241
aVdesire for attention, desire to feel special,
p242
aVdesire to feel important.
p243
aVAnd the very structure of an affair,
p244
aVthe fact that you can never have your lover,
p245
aVkeeps you wanting.
p246
aVThat in itself is a desire machine,
p247
aVbecause the incompleteness, the ambiguity,
p248
aVkeeps you wanting that which you can't have.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow some of you probably think
p251
aVthat affairs don't happen in open relationships,
p252
aVbut they do.
p253
aVFirst of all, the conversation about monogamy is not the same
p254
aVas the conversation about infidelity.
p255
aVBut the fact is that it seems that even when we have
p256
aVthe freedom to have other sexual partners,
p257
aVwe still seem to be lured by the power of the forbidden,
p258
aVthat if we do that which we are not supposed to do,
p259
aVthen we feel like we are really doing what we want to.
p260
aVAnd I've also told quite a few of my patients
p261
aVthat if they could bring into their relationships
p262
aVone tenth of the boldness, the imagination and the verve
p263
aVthat they put into their affairs,
p264
aVthey probably would never need to see me.
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VSo how do we heal from an affair?
p268
aVDesire runs deep.
p269
aVBetrayal runs deep.
p270
aVBut it can be healed.
p271
aVAnd some affairs are death knells
p272
aVfor relationships that were already dying on the vine.
p273
aVBut others will jolt us into new possibilities.
p274
aVThe fact is, the majority of couples
p275
aVwho have experienced affairs stay together.
p276
aVBut some of them will merely survive,
p277
aVand others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity.
p278
aVThey'll be able to turn this into a generative experience.
p279
aVAnd I'm actually thinking even more so for the deceived partner,
p280
aVwho will often say,
p281
aV"You think I didn't want more?
p282
aVBut I'm not the one who did it."
p283
aVBut now that the affair is exposed,
p284
aVthey, too, get to claim more,
p285
aVand they no longer have to uphold the status quo
p286
aVthat may not have been working for them that well, either.
p287
aa(lp288
VI've noticed that a lot of couples,
p289
aVin the immediate aftermath of an affair,
p290
aVbecause of this new disorder that may actually lead to a new order,
p291
aVwill have depths of conversations with honesty and openness
p292
aVthat they haven't had in decades.
p293
aVAnd, partners who were sexually indifferent
p294
aVfind themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious,
p295
aVthey don't know where it's coming from.
p296
aVSomething about the fear of loss will rekindle desire,
p297
aVand make way for an entirely new kind of truth.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo when an affair is exposed,
p300
aVwhat are some of the specific things that couples can do?
p301
aVWe know from trauma that healing begins
p302
aVwhen the perpetrator acknowledges their wrongdoing.
p303
aVSo for the partner who had the affair,
p304
aVfor Nick,
p305
aVone thing is to end the affair,
p306
aVbut the other is the essential, important act of expressing
p307
aVguilt and remorse for hurting his wife.
p308
aVBut the truth is
p309
aVthat I have noticed that quite a lot of people who have affairs
p310
aVmay feel terribly guilty for hurting their partner,
p311
aVbut they don't feel guilty for the experience of the affair itself.
p312
aVAnd that distinction is important.
p313
aVAnd Nick, he needs to hold vigil for the relationship.
p314
aVHe needs to become, for a while, the protector of the boundaries.
p315
aVIt's his responsibility to bring it up,
p316
aVbecause if he thinks about it,
p317
aVhe can relieve Heather from the obsession,
p318
aVand from having to make sure that the affair isn't forgotten,
p319
aVand that in itself begins to restore trust.
p320
aa(lp321
VBut for Heather,
p322
aVor deceived partners,
p323
aVit is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self-worth,
p324
aVto surround oneself with love and with friends and activities
p325
aVthat give back joy and meaning and identity.
p326
aVBut even more important,
p327
aVis to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details \u2014
p328
aVWhere were you? Where did you do it?
p329
aVHow often? Is she better than me in bed? \u2014
p330
aVquestions that only inflict more pain,
p331
aVand keep you awake at night.
p332
aVAnd instead, switch to what I call the investigative questions,
p333
aVthe ones that mine the meaning and the motives \u2014
p334
aVWhat did this affair mean for you?
p335
aVWhat were you able to express or experience there
p336
aVthat you could no longer do with me?
p337
aVWhat was it like for you when you came home?
p338
aVWhat is it about us that you value?
p339
aVAre you pleased this is over?
p340
aa(lp341
VEvery affair will redefine a relationship,
p342
aVand every couple will determine
p343
aVwhat the legacy of the affair will be.
p344
aVBut affairs are here to stay, and they're not going away.
p345
aVAnd the dilemmas of love and desire,
p346
aVthey don't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad,
p347
aVand victim and perpetrator.
p348
aVBetrayal in a relationship comes in many forms.
p349
aVThere are many ways that we betray our partner:
p350
aVwith contempt, with neglect,
p351
aVwith indifference, with violence.
p352
aVSexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner.
p353
aVIn other words, the victim of an affair
p354
aVis not always the victim of the marriage.
p355
aa(lp356
VNow, you've listened to me,
p357
aVand I know what you're thinking:
p358
aVShe has a French accent, she must be pro-affair.
p359
aV(Laughter)
p360
aVSo, you're wrong.
p361
aVI am not French.
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aV(Applause)
p364
aVAnd I'm not pro-affair.
p365
aVBut because I think that good can come out of an affair,
p366
aVI have often been asked this very strange question:
p367
aVWould I ever recommend it?
p368
aVNow, I would no more recommend you have an affair
p369
aVthan I would recommend you have cancer,
p370
aVand yet we know that people who have been ill
p371
aVoften talk about how their illness has yielded them a new perspective.
p372
aVThe main question that I've been asked since I arrived at this conference
p373
aVwhen I said I would talk about infidelity is, for or against?
p374
aVI said, "Yes."
p375
aV(Laughter)
p376
aa(lp377
VI look at affairs from a dual perspective:
p378
aVhurt and betrayal on one side,
p379
aVgrowth and self-discovery on the other \u2014
p380
aVwhat it did to you, and what it meant for me.
p381
aVAnd so when a couple comes to me in the aftermath of an affair
p382
aVthat has been revealed,
p383
aVI will often tell them this:
p384
aVToday in the West,
p385
aVmost of us are going to have two or three relationships
p386
aVor marriages,
p387
aVand some of us are going to do it with the same person.
p388
aVYour first marriage is over.
p389
aVWould you like to create a second one together?
p390
aa(lp391
VThank you.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause)

VThank you.
p5
aVIt's a real pleasure to be here.
p6
aVI last did a TED Talk
p7
aVI think about seven years ago or so.
p8
aVI talked about spaghetti sauce.
p9
aVAnd so many people, I guess, watch those videos.
p10
aVPeople have been coming up to me ever since
p11
aVto ask me questions about spaghetti sauce,
p12
aVwhich is a wonderful thing in the short term \u2014
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVbut it's proven to be less than ideal
p15
aVover seven years.
p16
aVAnd so I though I would come
p17
aVand try and put spaghetti sauce behind me.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VThe theme of this morning's session is Things We Make.
p22
aVAnd so I thought I would tell a story
p23
aVabout someone
p24
aVwho made one of the most precious objects
p25
aVof his era.
p26
aVAnd the man's name is Carl Norden.
p27
aVCarl Norden was born in 1880.
p28
aVAnd he was Swiss.
p29
aVAnd of course, the Swiss can be divided
p30
aVinto two general categories:
p31
aVthose who make small, exquisite,
p32
aVexpensive objects
p33
aVand those who handle the money
p34
aVof those who buy small, exquisite,
p35
aVexpensive objects.
p36
aVAnd Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp.
p37
aVHe's an engineer.
p38
aVHe goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.
p39
aVIn fact, one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin
p40
aVwho would go on
p41
aVto break small, expensive, exquisite objects.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd he's a Swiss engineer, Carl.
p44
aVAnd I mean that in its fullest sense of the word.
p45
aVHe wears three-piece suits;
p46
aVand he has a very, very small, important mustache;
p47
aVand he is domineering
p48
aVand narcissistic
p49
aVand driven
p50
aVand has an extraordinary ego;
p51
aVand he works 16-hour days;
p52
aVand he has very strong feelings about alternating current;
p53
aVand he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness;
p54
aVand he drinks lots of coffee;
p55
aVand he does his best work
p56
aVsitting in his mother's kitchen in Zurich for hours
p57
aVin complete silence
p58
aVwith nothing but a slide rule.
p59
aa(lp60
VIn any case,
p61
aVCarl Norden emigrates to the United States
p62
aVjust before the First World War
p63
aVand sets up shop on Lafayette Street
p64
aVin downtown Manhattan.
p65
aVAnd he becomes obsessed with the question
p66
aVof how to drop bombs from an airplane.
p67
aVNow if you think about it,
p68
aVin the age before GPS and radar,
p69
aVthat was obviously a really difficult problem.
p70
aVIt's a complicated physics problem.
p71
aVYou've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air,
p72
aVgoing at hundreds of miles an hour,
p73
aVand you're trying to drop an object, a bomb,
p74
aVtowards some stationary target
p75
aVin the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover
p76
aVand all kinds of other impediments.
p77
aVAnd all sorts of people,
p78
aVmoving up to the First World War and between the wars,
p79
aVtried to solve this problem,
p80
aVand nearly everybody came up short.
p81
aVThe bombsights that were available
p82
aVwere incredibly crude.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code.
p85
aVAnd he comes up with this incredibly complicated device.
p86
aVIt weighs about 50 lbs.
p87
aVIt's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
p88
aVAnd it has all kinds of levers and ball-bearings
p89
aVand gadgets and gauges.
p90
aVAnd he makes this complicated thing.
p91
aVAnd what he allows people to do
p92
aVis he makes the bombardier take this particular object,
p93
aVvisually sight the target,
p94
aVbecause they're in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber,
p95
aVand then they plug in the altitude of the plane,
p96
aVthe speed of the plane, the speed of the wind
p97
aVand the coordinates
p98
aVof the target.
p99
aVAnd the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb.
p100
aVAnd as Norden famously says,
p101
aV"Before that bombsight came along,
p102
aVbombs would routinely miss their target
p103
aVby a mile or more."
p104
aVBut he said, with the Mark 15 Norden bombsight,
p105
aVhe could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel
p106
aVat 20,000 ft.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow I cannot tell you
p109
aVhow incredibly excited
p110
aVthe U.S. military was
p111
aVby the news of the Norden bombsight.
p112
aVIt was like manna from heaven.
p113
aVHere was an army
p114
aVthat had just had experience in the First World War,
p115
aVwhere millions of men
p116
aVfought each other in the trenches,
p117
aVgetting nowhere, making no progress,
p118
aVand here someone had come up with a device
p119
aVthat allowed them to fly up in the skies
p120
aVhigh above enemy territory
p121
aVand destroy whatever they wanted
p122
aVwith pinpoint accuracy.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd the U.S. military
p125
aVspends 1.5 billion dollars \u2014
p126
aVbillion dollars in 1940 dollars \u2014
p127
aVdeveloping the Norden bombsight.
p128
aVAnd to put that in perspective,
p129
aVthe total cost of the Manhattan project
p130
aVwas three billion dollars.
p131
aVHalf as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight
p132
aVas was spent on the most famous military-industrial project
p133
aVof the modern era.
p134
aVAnd there were people, strategists, within the U.S. military
p135
aVwho genuinely thought that this single device
p136
aVwas going to spell the difference
p137
aVbetween defeat and victory
p138
aVwhen it came to the battle against the Nazis
p139
aVand against the Japanese.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd for Norden as well,
p142
aVthis device had incredible moral importance,
p143
aVbecause Norden was a committed Christian.
p144
aVIn fact, he would always get upset
p145
aVwhen people referred to the bombsight as his invention,
p146
aVbecause in his eyes,
p147
aVonly God could invent things.
p148
aVHe was simply the instrument of God's will.
p149
aVAnd what was God's will?
p150
aVWell God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war
p151
aVbe reduced to as small an amount as possible.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd what did the Norden bombsight do?
p154
aVWell it allowed you to do that.
p155
aVIt allowed you to bomb only those things
p156
aVthat you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb.
p157
aVSo in the years leading up to the Second World War,
p158
aVthe U.S. military buys 90,000
p159
aVof these Norden bombsights
p160
aVat a cost of $14,000 each \u2014
p161
aVagain, in 1940 dollars, that's a lot of money.
p162
aVAnd they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them \u2014
p163
aVlong extensive, months-long training sessions \u2014
p164
aVbecause these things are essentially analog computers;
p165
aVthey're not easy to use.
p166
aVAnd they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath,
p167
aVto swear that if they're ever captured,
p168
aVthey will not divulge a single detail
p169
aVof this particular device to the enemy,
p170
aVbecause it's imperative the enemy not get their hands
p171
aVon this absolutely essential piece of technology.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane,
p174
aVit's escorted there by a series of armed guards.
p175
aVAnd it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it.
p176
aVAnd the box is handcuffed to one of the guards.
p177
aVIt's never allowed to be photographed.
p178
aVAnd there's a little incendiary device inside of it,
p179
aVso that, if the plane ever crashes, it will be destroyed
p180
aVand there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it.
p181
aVThe Norden bombsight
p182
aVis the Holy Grail.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo what happens during the Second World War?
p185
aVWell, it turns out it's not the Holy Grail.
p186
aVIn practice, the Norden bombsight
p187
aVcan drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.,
p188
aVbut that's under perfect conditions.
p189
aVAnd of course, in wartime,
p190
aVconditions aren't perfect.
p191
aVFirst of all, it's really hard to use \u2014 really hard to use.
p192
aVAnd not all of the people
p193
aVwho are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers
p194
aVhave the ability to properly program an analog computer.
p195
aVSecondly, it breaks down a lot.
p196
aVIt's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys
p197
aVand gadgets and ball-bearings,
p198
aVand they don't work as well as they ought to
p199
aVin the heat of battle.
p200
aa(lp201
VThirdly, when Norden was making his calculations,
p202
aVhe assumed that a plane would be flying
p203
aVat a relatively slow speed at low altitudes.
p204
aVWell in a real war, you can't do that;
p205
aVyou'll get shot down.
p206
aVSo they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds.
p207
aVAnd the Norden bombsight doesn't work as well
p208
aVunder those conditions.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut most of all,
p211
aVthe Norden bombsight required the bombardier
p212
aVto make visual contact with the target.
p213
aVBut of course, what happens in real life?
p214
aVThere are clouds, right.
p215
aVIt needs cloudless sky to be really accurate.
p216
aVWell how many cloudless skies
p217
aVdo you think there were above Central Europe
p218
aVbetween 1940 and 1945?
p219
aVNot a lot.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd then to give you a sense
p222
aVof just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was,
p223
aVthere was a famous case in 1944
p224
aVwhere the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.
p225
aVAnd the chemical plant comprised
p226
aV757 acres.
p227
aVAnd over the course of 22 bombing missions,
p228
aVthe Allies dropped 85,000 bombs
p229
aVon this 757 acre chemical plant,
p230
aVusing the Norden bombsight.
p231
aVWell what percentage of those bombs
p232
aVdo you think actually landed
p233
aVinside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant?
p234
aV10 percent. 10 percent.
p235
aVAnd of those 10 percent that landed,
p236
aV16 percent didn't even go off; they were duds.
p237
aVThe Leuna chemical plant,
p238
aVafter one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war,
p239
aVwas up and running within weeks.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd by the way, all those precautions
p242
aVto keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis?
p243
aVWell it turns out
p244
aVthat Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss,
p245
aVwas very enamored of German engineers.
p246
aVSo in the 1930s, he hired a whole bunch of them,
p247
aVincluding a man named Hermann Long
p248
aVwho, in 1938,
p249
aVgave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.
p250
aVSo they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war \u2014
p251
aVwhich also, by the way, didn't work very well.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VSo why do we talk about the Norden bombsight?
p256
aVWell because we live in an age
p257
aVwhere there are lots and lots
p258
aVof Norden bombsights.
p259
aVWe live in a time where there are all kinds
p260
aVof really, really smart people
p261
aVrunning around, saying that they've invented gadgets
p262
aVthat will forever change our world.
p263
aVThey've invented websites that will allow people to be free.
p264
aVThey've invented some kind of this thing, or this thing, or this thing
p265
aVthat will make our world forever better.
p266
aa(lp267
VIf you go into the military,
p268
aVyou'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well.
p269
aVIf you go to the Pentagon, they will say,
p270
aV"You know what, now we really can
p271
aVput a bomb inside a pickle barrel
p272
aVat 20,000 ft."
p273
aVAnd you know what, it's true; they actually can do that now.
p274
aVBut we need to be very clear
p275
aVabout how little that means.
p276
aa(lp277
VIn the Iraq War, at the beginning of the first Iraq War,
p278
aVthe U.S. military, the air force,
p279
aVsent two squadrons of F-15E Fighter Eagles
p280
aVto the Iraqi desert
p281
aVequipped with these five million dollar cameras
p282
aVthat allowed them to see the entire desert floor.
p283
aVAnd their mission was to find and to destroy \u2014
p284
aVremember the Scud missile launchers,
p285
aVthose surface-to-air missiles
p286
aVthat the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis?
p287
aVThe mission of the two squadrons
p288
aVwas to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers.
p289
aVAnd so they flew missions day and night,
p290
aVand they dropped thousands of bombs,
p291
aVand they fired thousands of missiles
p292
aVin an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd after the war was over, there was an audit done \u2014
p295
aVas the army always does, the air force always does \u2014
p296
aVand they asked the question:
p297
aVhow many Scuds did we actually destroy?
p298
aVYou know what the answer was?
p299
aVZero, not a single one.
p300
aVNow why is that?
p301
aVIs it because their weapons weren't accurate?
p302
aVOh no, they were brilliantly accurate.
p303
aVThey could have destroyed this little thing right here
p304
aVfrom 25,000 ft.
p305
aVThe issue was they didn't know where the Scud launchers were.
p306
aVThe problem with bombs and pickle barrels
p307
aVis not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel,
p308
aVit's knowing how to find the pickle barrel.
p309
aVThat's always been the harder problem
p310
aVwhen it comes to fighting wars.
p311
aa(lp312
VOr take the battle in Afghanistan.
p313
aVWhat is the signature weapon
p314
aVof the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan?
p315
aVIt's the drone. What is the drone?
p316
aVWell it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
p317
aVIt is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision.
p318
aVAnd over the course of the last six years
p319
aVin Northwest Pakistan,
p320
aVthe CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles,
p321
aVand it's used those drones
p322
aVto kill 2,000 suspected
p323
aVPakistani and Taliban militants.
p324
aVNow what is the accuracy of those drones?
p325
aVWell it's extraordinary.
p326
aVWe think we're now at 95 percent accuracy
p327
aVwhen it comes to drone strikes.
p328
aV95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed, right?
p329
aVThat is one of the most extraordinary records
p330
aVin the history of modern warfare.
p331
aa(lp332
VBut do you know what the crucial thing is?
p333
aVIn that exact same period
p334
aVthat we've been using these drones
p335
aVwith devastating accuracy,
p336
aVthe number of attacks, of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks,
p337
aVagainst American forces in Afghanistan
p338
aVhas increased tenfold.
p339
aVAs we have gotten more and more efficient
p340
aVin killing them,
p341
aVthey have become angrier and angrier
p342
aVand more and more motivated to kill us.
p343
aVI have not described to you a success story.
p344
aVI've described to you
p345
aVthe opposite of a success story.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd this is the problem
p348
aVwith our infatuation with the things we make.
p349
aVWe think the things we make can solve our problems,
p350
aVbut our problems are much more complex than that.
p351
aVThe issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have,
p352
aVit's how you use the bombs you have,
p353
aVand more importantly,
p354
aVwhether you ought to use bombs at all.
p355
aa(lp356
VThere's a postscript
p357
aVto the Norden story
p358
aVof Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.
p359
aVAnd that is, on August 6, 1945,
p360
aVa B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay
p361
aVflew over Japan
p362
aVand, using a Norden bombsight,
p363
aVdropped a very large thermonuclear device
p364
aVon the city of Hiroshima.
p365
aVAnd as was typical with the Norden bombsight,
p366
aVthe bomb actually missed its target by 800 ft.
p367
aVBut of course, it didn't matter.
p368
aVAnd that's the greatest irony of all
p369
aVwhen it comes to the Norden bombsight.
p370
aVthe air force's 1.5 billion dollar bombsight
p371
aVwas used to drop its three billion dollar bomb,
p372
aVwhich didn't need a bombsight at all.
p373
aa(lp374
VMeanwhile, back in New York,
p375
aVno one told Carl Norden
p376
aVthat his bombsight was used over Hiroshima.
p377
aVHe was a committed Christian.
p378
aVHe thought he had designed something
p379
aVthat would reduce the toll of suffering in war.
p380
aVIt would have broken his heart.

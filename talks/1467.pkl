VAll right. So, like all good stories,
p5
aVthis starts a long, long time ago
p6
aVwhen there was basically nothing.
p7
aVSo here is a complete picture of the universe
p8
aVabout 14-odd billion years ago.
p9
aVAll energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.
p10
aVFor some reason it explodes,
p11
aVand you begin to get these things.
p12
aVSo you're now about 14 billion years into this.
p13
aVAnd these things expand and expand and expand
p14
aVinto these giant galaxies,
p15
aVand you get trillions of them.
p16
aVAnd within these galaxies
p17
aVyou get these enormous dust clouds.
p18
aVAnd I want you to pay particular attention
p19
aVto the three little prongs
p20
aa(lp21
Vin the center of this picture.
p22
aVIf you take a close-up of those,
p23
aVthey look like this.
p24
aVAnd what you're looking at is columns of dust
p25
aVwhere there's so much dust \u2014
p26
aVby the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles \u2014
p27
aVand what's happening is there's so much dust,
p28
aVit comes together and it fuses
p29
aVand ignites a thermonuclear reaction.
p30
aVAnd so what you're watching
p31
aVis the birth of stars.
p32
aVThese are stars being born out of here.
p33
aVWhen enough stars come out,
p34
aVthey create a galaxy.
p35
aVThis one happens to be a particularly important galaxy,
p36
aVbecause you are here.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVAnd as you take a close-up of this galaxy,
p39
aVyou find a relatively normal,
p40
aVnot particularly interesting star.
p41
aa(lp42
VBy the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story.
p43
aVSo this star doesn't even appear
p44
aVuntil about two-thirds of the way into this story.
p45
aVAnd then what happens
p46
aVis there's enough dust left over
p47
aVthat it doesn't ignite into a star,
p48
aVit becomes a planet.
p49
aVAnd this is about a little over four billion years ago.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd soon thereafter
p52
aVthere's enough material left over
p53
aVthat you get a primordial soup,
p54
aVand that creates life.
p55
aVAnd life starts to expand and expand and expand,
p56
aVuntil it goes kaput.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VNow the really strange thing
p61
aVis life goes kaput, not once, not twice,
p62
aVbut five times.
p63
aVSo almost all life on Earth
p64
aVis wiped out about five times.
p65
aVAnd as you're thinking about that,
p66
aVwhat happens is you get more and more complexity,
p67
aVmore and more stuff
p68
aVto build new things with.
p69
aVAnd we don't appear
p70
aVuntil about 99.96 percent of the time into this story,
p71
aVjust to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo within that context, there's two theories of the case
p74
aVas to why we're all here.
p75
aVThe first theory of the case
p76
aVis that's all she wrote.
p77
aVUnder that theory,
p78
aVwe are the be-all and end-all
p79
aVof all creation.
p80
aVAnd the reason for trillions of galaxies,
p81
aVsextillions of planets,
p82
aVis to create something that looks like that
p83
aVand something that looks like that.
p84
aVAnd that's the purpose of the universe;
p85
aVand then it flat-lines,
p86
aVit doesn't get any better.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VThe only question you might want to ask yourself is,
p91
aVcould that be just mildly arrogant?
p92
aVAnd if it is \u2014
p93
aVand particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction.
p94
aVThere were only about 2,000 of our species left.
p95
aVA few more weeks without rain,
p96
aVwe would have never seen any of these.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
V(Applause)
p101
aa(lp102
VSo maybe you have to think about a second theory
p103
aVif the first one isn't good enough.
p104
aVSecond theory is: Could we upgrade?
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVWell, why would one ask a question like that?
p107
aVBecause there have been at least 29 upgrades so far
p108
aVof humanoids.
p109
aVSo it turns out that we have upgraded.
p110
aVWe've upgraded time and again and again.
p111
aVAnd it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades.
p112
aVWe found this one last year.
p113
aVWe found another one last month.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd as you're thinking about this,
p116
aVyou might also ask the question:
p117
aVSo why a single human species?
p118
aVWouldn't it be really odd
p119
aVif you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica
p120
aVand found exactly the same bird \u2014
p121
aVparticularly given that we co-existed at the same time
p122
aVwith at least eight other versions of humanoid
p123
aVat the same time on this planet?
p124
aVSo the normal state of affairs
p125
aVis not to have just a Homo sapiens;
p126
aVthe normal state of affairs
p127
aVis to have various versions of humans walking around.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd if that is the normal state of affairs,
p130
aVthen you might ask yourself,
p131
aVall right, so if we want to create something else,
p132
aVhow big does a mutation have to be?
p133
aVWell Svante Paabo has the answer.
p134
aVThe difference between humans and Neanderthal
p135
aVis 0.004 percent of gene code.
p136
aVThat's how big the difference is
p137
aVone species to another.
p138
aVThis explains most contemporary political debates.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VBut as you're thinking about this,
p143
aVone of the interesting things
p144
aVis how small these mutations are and where they take place.
p145
aVDifference human/Neanderthal
p146
aVis sperm and testis,
p147
aVsmell and skin.
p148
aVAnd those are the specific genes
p149
aVthat differ from one to the other.
p150
aVSo very small changes can have a big impact.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd as you're thinking about this,
p153
aVwe're continuing to mutate.
p154
aVSo about 10,000 years ago by the Black Sea,
p155
aVwe had one mutation in one gene
p156
aVwhich led to blue eyes.
p157
aVAnd this is continuing and continuing and continuing.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd as it continues,
p160
aVone of the things that's going to happen this year
p161
aVis we're going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes,
p162
aVbecause it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing.
p163
aVAnd when we find these,
p164
aVwe may find differences.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for,
p167
aVbecause we have really misused the science in this.
p168
aVIn the 1920s, we thought there were major differences between people.
p169
aVThat was partly based on Francis Galton's work.
p170
aVHe was Darwin's cousin.
p171
aVBut the U.S., the Carnegie Institute,
p172
aVStanford, American Neurological Association
p173
aVtook this really far.
p174
aVThat got exported and was really misused.
p175
aVIn fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous
p176
aVtreatment of human beings.
p177
aVSo since the 1940s, we've been saying there are no differences,
p178
aVwe're all identical.
p179
aVWe're going to know at year end if that is true.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd as we think about that,
p182
aVwe're actually beginning to find things
p183
aVlike, do you have an ACE gene?
p184
aVWhy would that matter?
p185
aVBecause nobody's ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen
p186
aVthat doesn't have an ACE gene.
p187
aVAnd if you want to get more specific,
p188
aVhow about a 577R genotype?
p189
aVWell it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested
p190
aVcarries at least one of these variants.
p191
aa(lp192
VIf that is true,
p193
aVit leads to some very complicated questions
p194
aVfor the London Olympics.
p195
aVThree options:
p196
aVDo you want the Olympics to be a showcase
p197
aVfor really hardworking mutants?
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVOption number two:
p200
aVWhy don't we play it like golf or sailing?
p201
aVBecause you have one and you don't have one,
p202
aVI'll give you a tenth of a second head start.
p203
aVVersion number three:
p204
aVBecause this is a naturally occurring gene
p205
aVand you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents,
p206
aVyou get the right to upgrade.
p207
aVThree different options.
p208
aVIf these differences are the difference
p209
aVbetween an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd it turns out that as we discover these things,
p212
aVwe human beings really like to change
p213
aVhow we look, how we act,
p214
aVwhat our bodies do.
p215
aVAnd we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States,
p216
aVexcept that with the technologies that are coming online today,
p217
aVtoday's corrections, deletions,
p218
aVaugmentations and enhancements
p219
aVare going to seem like child's play.
p220
aa(lp221
VYou already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED,
p222
aVbut this ability to start filling
p223
aVthings like inkjet cartridges with cells
p224
aVare allowing us to print skin, organs
p225
aVand a whole series of other body parts.
p226
aVAnd as these technologies go forward,
p227
aVyou keep seeing this, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing things \u2014
p228
aV2000, human genome sequence \u2014
p229
aVand it seems like nothing's happening,
p230
aVuntil it does.
p231
aVAnd we may just be in some of these weeks.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd as you're thinking about
p234
aVthese two guys sequencing a human genome in 2000
p235
aVand the Public Project sequencing the human genome in 2000,
p236
aVthen you don't hear a lot,
p237
aVuntil you hear about an experiment last year in China,
p238
aVwhere they take skin cells from this mouse,
p239
aVput four chemicals on it,
p240
aVturn those skin cells into stem cells,
p241
aVlet the stem cells grow
p242
aVand create a full copy of that mouse.
p243
aa(lp244
VThat's a big deal.
p245
aVBecause in essence
p246
aVwhat it means is you can take a cell,
p247
aVwhich is a pluripotent stem cell,
p248
aVwhich is like a skier at the top of a mountain,
p249
aVand those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells,
p250
aVfour, eight, 16,
p251
aVand then it gets so crowded
p252
aVafter 16 divisions
p253
aVthat those cells have to differentiate.
p254
aVSo they go down one side of the mountain,
p255
aVthey go down another.
p256
aVAnd as they pick that,
p257
aVthese become bone,
p258
aVand then they pick another road and these become platelets,
p259
aVand these become macrophages,
p260
aVand these become T cells.
p261
aVBut it's really hard, once you ski down,
p262
aVto get back up.
p263
aVUnless, of course, if you have a ski lift.
p264
aVAnd what those four chemicals do
p265
aVis they take any cell
p266
aVand take it way back up the mountain
p267
aVso it can become any body part.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd as you think of that,
p270
aVwhat it means is potentially
p271
aVyou can rebuild a full copy
p272
aVof any organism
p273
aVout of any one of its cells.
p274
aVThat turns out to be a big deal
p275
aVbecause now you can take, not just mouse cells,
p276
aVbut you can human skin cells
p277
aVand turn them into human stem cells.
p278
aVAnd then what they did in October
p279
aVis they took skin cells, turned them into stem cells
p280
aVand began to turn them into liver cells.
p281
aVSo in theory,
p282
aVyou could grow any organ from any one of your cells.
p283
aa(lp284
VHere's a second experiment:
p285
aVIf you could photocopy your body,
p286
aVmaybe you also want to take your mind.
p287
aVAnd one of the things you saw at TED
p288
aVabout a year and a half ago
p289
aVwas this guy.
p290
aVAnd he gave a wonderful technical talk.
p291
aVHe's a professor at MIT.
p292
aVBut in essence what he said
p293
aVis you can take retroviruses,
p294
aVwhich get inside brain cells of mice.
p295
aVYou can tag them with proteins
p296
aVthat light up when you light them.
p297
aVAnd you can map the exact pathways
p298
aVwhen a mouse sees, feels, touches,
p299
aVremembers, loves.
p300
aVAnd then you can take a fiber optic cable
p301
aVand light up some of the same things.
p302
aVAnd by the way, as you do this,
p303
aVyou can image it in two colors,
p304
aVwhich means you can download this information
p305
aVas binary code directly into a computer.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo what's the bottom line on that?
p308
aVWell it's not completely inconceivable
p309
aVthat someday you'll be able to download your own memories,
p310
aVmaybe into a new body.
p311
aVAnd maybe you can upload other people's memories as well.
p312
aVAnd this might have just one or two
p313
aVsmall ethical, political, moral implications.
p314
aV(Laughter)
p315
aVJust a thought.
p316
aa(lp317
VHere's the kind of questions
p318
aVthat are becoming interesting questions
p319
aVfor philosophers, for governing people,
p320
aVfor economists, for scientists.
p321
aVBecause these technologies are moving really quickly.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd as you think about it,
p324
aVlet me close with an example of the brain.
p325
aVThe first place where you would expect
p326
aVto see enormous evolutionary pressure today,
p327
aVboth because of the inputs,
p328
aVwhich are becoming massive,
p329
aVand because of the plasticity of the organ,
p330
aVis the brain.
p331
aa(lp332
VDo we have any evidence that that is happening?
p333
aVWell let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand.
p334
aVHere's what it looks like in 2000.
p335
aVHere's what it looks like in 2002,
p336
aV2006, 2008.
p337
aVHere's the increase in less than a decade.
p338
aVAnd we still don't know why this is happening.
p339
aVWhat we do know is, potentially,
p340
aVthe brain is reacting in
p341
aVa hyperactive, hyper-plastic way,
p342
aVand creating individuals that are like this.
p343
aVAnd this is only one of the conditions that's out there.
p344
aVYou've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart,
p345
aVpeople who can remember everything they've seen in their lives,
p346
aVpeople who've got synesthesia,
p347
aVpeople who've got schizophrenia.
p348
aVYou've got all kinds of stuff going on out there,
p349
aVand we still don't understand
p350
aVhow and why this is happening.
p351
aa(lp352
VBut one question you might want to ask is,
p353
aVare we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain
p354
aVand of how we process data?
p355
aVBecause when you think of how much data's coming into our brains,
p356
aVwe're trying to take in as much data in a day
p357
aVas people used to take in in a lifetime.
p358
aVAnd as you're thinking about this,
p359
aVthere's four theories as to why this might be going on,
p360
aVplus a whole series of others.
p361
aVI don't have a good answer.
p362
aVThere really needs to be more research on this.
p363
aa(lp364
VOne option is the fast food fetish.
p365
aVThere's beginning to be some evidence
p366
aVthat obesity and diet
p367
aVhave something to do
p368
aVwith gene modifications,
p369
aVwhich may or may not have an impact
p370
aVon how the brain of an infant works.
p371
aa(lp372
VA second option is the sexy geek option.
p373
aVThese conditions are highly rare.
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aV(Applause)
p376
aVBut what's beginning to happen
p377
aVis because these geeks are all getting together,
p378
aVbecause they are highly qualified for computer programming
p379
aVand it is highly remunerated,
p380
aVas well as other very detail-oriented tasks,
p381
aVthat they are concentrating geographically
p382
aVand finding like-minded mates.
p383
aVSo this is the assortative mating hypothesis
p384
aVof these genes reinforcing one another
p385
aVin these structures.
p386
aa(lp387
VThe third, is this too much information?
p388
aVWe're trying to process so much stuff
p389
aVthat some people get synesthetic
p390
aVand just have huge pipes that remember everything.
p391
aVOther people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information.
p392
aVOther people react with various psychological conditions
p393
aVor reactions to this information.
p394
aVOr maybe it's chemicals.
p395
aa(lp396
VBut when you see an increase
p397
aVof that order of magnitude in a condition,
p398
aVeither you're not measuring it right
p399
aVor there's something going on very quickly,
p400
aVand it may be evolution in real time.
p401
aa(lp402
VHere's the bottom line.
p403
aVWhat I think we are doing
p404
aVis we're transitioning as a species.
p405
aVAnd I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together.
p406
aVI think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis
p407
aVthat, for better or worse,
p408
aVis not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment,
p409
aVit's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately
p410
aVcontrol the evolution of its own species,
p411
aVof bacteria, of plants, of animals.
p412
aVAnd I think that's such an order of magnitude change
p413
aVthat your grandkids or your great-grandkids
p414
aVmay be a species very different from you.
p415
aa(lp416
VThank you very much.

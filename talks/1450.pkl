VThis is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain.
p5
aVIt's a diagram of the visual system.
p6
aVAnd some things look very familiar today.
p7
aVTwo eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.
p8
aVThere's a very large nose
p9
aVthat doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular.
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd if we compare this
p12
aVto more recent representations of the visual system,
p13
aVyou'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated
p14
aVover the intervening thousand years.
p15
aVAnd that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain,
p16
aVrather than just looking at its overall shape.
p17
aa(lp18
VImagine you wanted to understand how a computer works
p19
aVand all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.
p20
aVYou really would be kind of out of luck.
p21
aVYou want to be able to open it up, crack it open,
p22
aVlook at the wiring inside.
p23
aVAnd up until a little more than a century ago,
p24
aVnobody was able to do that with the brain.
p25
aVNobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd that's because if you take a brain out of the skull
p28
aVand you cut a thin slice of it,
p29
aVput it under even a very powerful microscope,
p30
aVthere's nothing there.
p31
aVIt's gray, formless.
p32
aVThere's no structure. It won't tell you anything.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd this all changed in the late 19th century.
p35
aVSuddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed
p36
aVand they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring.
p37
aVThe computer was cracked open.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo what really launched modern neuroscience
p40
aVwas a stain called the Golgi stain.
p41
aVAnd it works in a very particular way.
p42
aVInstead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue,
p43
aVit somehow only stains about one percent of them.
p44
aVIt clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.
p45
aVIf everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.
p46
aVSo somehow it shows what's there.
p47
aa(lp48
VSpanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal,
p49
aVwho's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience,
p50
aVapplied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this,
p51
aVand really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron.
p52
aVAnd if you're thinking of the brain as a computer,
p53
aVthis is the transistor.
p54
aVAnd very quickly Cajal realized
p55
aVthat neurons don't operate alone,
p56
aVbut rather make connections with others
p57
aVthat form circuits just like in a computer.
p58
aVToday, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons,
p59
aVthey light them up from the inside rather than darkening them.
p60
aVAnd there's several ways of doing this.
p61
aVBut one of the most popular ones
p62
aVinvolves green fluorescent protein.
p63
aVNow green fluorescent protein,
p64
aVwhich oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish,
p65
aVis very useful.
p66
aVBecause if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein
p67
aVand deliver it to a cell,
p68
aVthat cell will glow green \u2014
p69
aVor any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein,
p70
aVyou get a cell to glow many different colors.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd so coming back to the brain,
p73
aVthis is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."
p74
aVAnd it's so called, of course,
p75
aVbecause all of these neurons are glowing different colors.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow sometimes neuroscientists need to identify
p78
aVindividual molecular components of neurons, molecules,
p79
aVrather than the entire cell.
p80
aVAnd there's several ways of doing this,
p81
aVbut one of the most popular ones
p82
aVinvolves using antibodies.
p83
aVAnd you're familiar, of course,
p84
aVwith antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system.
p85
aVBut it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system
p86
aVbecause they can recognize specific molecules,
p87
aVlike, for example, the coat protein
p88
aVof a virus that's invading the body.
p89
aVAnd researchers have used this fact
p90
aVin order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain,
p91
aVrecognize specific substructures of the cell
p92
aVand identify them individually.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful,
p95
aVbut they're also very powerful.
p96
aVThey have great explanatory power.
p97
aVThis, for example, is an antibody staining
p98
aVagainst serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd you've heard of serotonin, of course,
p101
aVin the context of diseases like depression and anxiety.
p102
aVYou've heard of SSRIs,
p103
aVwhich are drugs that are used to treat these diseases.
p104
aVAnd in order to understand how serotonin works,
p105
aVit's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is.
p106
aVAnd antibody stainings like this one
p107
aVcan be used to understand that sort of question.
p108
aa(lp109
VI'd like to leave you with the following thought:
p110
aVGreen fluorescent protein and antibodies
p111
aVare both totally natural products at the get-go.
p112
aVThey were evolved by nature
p113
aVin order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason,
p114
aVor in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example.
p115
aVAnd only much later did scientists come onto the scene
p116
aVand say, "Hey, these are tools,
p117
aVthese are functions that we could use
p118
aVin our own research tool palette."
p119
aVAnd instead of applying feeble human minds
p120
aVto designing these tools from scratch,
p121
aVthere were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature
p122
aVdeveloped and refined steadily for millions of years
p123
aVby the greatest engineer of all.
p124
aVThank you.

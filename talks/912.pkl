VI still remember the day in school
p5
aVwhen our teacher told us
p6
aVthat the world population had become
p7
aVthree billion people,
p8
aVand that was in 1960.
p9
aVI'm going to talk now about
p10
aVhow world population has changed from that year
p11
aVand into the future,
p12
aVbut I will not use digital technology,
p13
aVas I've done during my first five TEDTalks.
p14
aVInstead, I have progressed,
p15
aVand I am, today, launching
p16
aVa brand new analog teaching technology
p17
aVthat I picked up from IKEA:
p18
aVthis box.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis box contains one billion people.
p21
aVAnd our teacher told us
p22
aVthat the industrialized world, 1960,
p23
aVhad one billion people.
p24
aVIn the developing world, she said,
p25
aVthey had two billion people.
p26
aVAnd they lived away then.
p27
aVThere was a big gap between
p28
aVthe one billion in the industrialized world
p29
aVand the two billion in the developing world.
p30
aVIn the industrialized world,
p31
aVpeople were healthy,
p32
aVeducated, rich,
p33
aVand they had small families.
p34
aVAnd their aspiration
p35
aVwas to buy a car.
p36
aVAnd in 1960, all Swedes were saving
p37
aVto try to buy a Volvo like this.
p38
aVThis was the economic level at which Sweden was.
p39
aVBut in contrast to this,
p40
aVin the developing world, far away,
p41
aVthe aspiration of the average family there
p42
aVwas to have food for the day.
p43
aVThey were saving
p44
aVto be able to buy a pair of shoes.
p45
aVThere was an enormous gap in the world
p46
aVwhen I grew up.
p47
aVAnd this gap between the West and the rest
p48
aVhas created a mindset of the world,
p49
aVwhich we still use linguistically
p50
aVwhen we talk about "the West"
p51
aVand "the Developing World."
p52
aVBut the world has changed,
p53
aVand it's overdue to upgrade that mindset
p54
aVand that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd that's what I'm going to show you,
p57
aVbecause since 1960
p58
aVwhat has happened in the world up to 2010
p59
aVis that a staggering
p60
aVfour billion people
p61
aVhave been added to the world population.
p62
aVJust look how many.
p63
aVThe world population has doubled
p64
aVsince I went to school.
p65
aVAnd of course, there's been economic growth in the West.
p66
aVA lot of companies have happened to grow the economy,
p67
aVso the Western population moved over to here.
p68
aVAnd now their aspiration is not only to have a car.
p69
aVNow they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination
p70
aVand they want to fly.
p71
aVSo this is where they are today.
p72
aVAnd the most successful of the developing countries,
p73
aVthey have moved on, you know,
p74
aVand they have become emerging economies, we call them.
p75
aVThey are now buying cars.
p76
aVAnd what happened a month ago
p77
aVwas that the Chinese company, Geely,
p78
aVthey acquired the Volvo company,
p79
aVand then finally the Swedes understood that
p80
aVsomething big had happened in the world.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VSo there they are.
p84
aVAnd the tragedy is that the two billion over here
p85
aVthat is struggling for food and shoes,
p86
aVthey are still almost as poor
p87
aVas they were 50 years ago.
p88
aVThe new thing is that
p89
aVwe have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here,
p90
aVwhich are also becoming emerging economies,
p91
aVbecause they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated,
p92
aVand they already also have two to three children
p93
aVper woman, as those [richer also] have.
p94
aVAnd their aspiration now
p95
aVis, of course, to buy a bicycle,
p96
aVand then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.
p97
aVBut this is the world
p98
aVwe have today,
p99
aVno longer any gap.
p100
aVBut the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest,
p101
aVto the very richest over here is wider than ever.
p102
aVBut there is a continuous world
p103
aVfrom walking, biking,
p104
aVdriving, flying \u2014
p105
aVthere are people on all levels,
p106
aVand most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.
p107
aVThis is the new world we have today
p108
aVin 2010.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd what will happen in the future?
p111
aVWell, I'm going to project
p112
aVinto 2050.
p113
aVI was in Shanghai recently,
p114
aVand I listened to what's happening in China,
p115
aVand it's pretty sure that they will catch up,
p116
aVjust as Japan did.
p117
aVAll the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with
p118
aVone to two or three percent.
p119
aV[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.
p120
aVThey will start flying.
p121
aVAnd these
p122
aVlower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries,
p123
aVthey will also forge forwards economically.
p124
aVAnd if,
p125
aVbut only if,
p126
aVwe invest in the right green technology \u2014
p127
aVso that we can avoid severe climate change,
p128
aVand energy can still be relatively cheap \u2014
p129
aVthen they will move all the way up here.
p130
aVAnd they will start to buy
p131
aVelectric cars.
p132
aVThis is what we will find there.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo what about the poorest two billion?
p135
aVWhat about the poorest two billion here?
p136
aVWill they move on?
p137
aVWell, here population [growth] comes in
p138
aVbecause there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman,
p139
aVfamily planning is widely used,
p140
aVand population growth is coming to an end.
p141
aVHere [among the poorest], population is growing.
p142
aVSo these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades,
p143
aVincrease to three billion,
p144
aVand they will thereafter
p145
aVincrease to four billion.
p146
aVThere is nothing \u2014
p147
aVbut a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen \u2014
p148
aVthat can stop this [growth] from happening.
p149
aVBecause we already have this [growth] in process.
p150
aVBut if, and only if,
p151
aV[the poorest] get out of poverty,
p152
aVthey get education, they get improved child survival,
p153
aVthey can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here,
p154
aVthen population growth
p155
aVwill stop in 2050.
p156
aVWe cannot have people on this level
p157
aVlooking for food and shoes
p158
aVbecause then we get continued population growth.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd let me show you why
p161
aVby converting back to the old-time
p162
aVdigital technology.
p163
aVHere I have on the screen
p164
aVmy country bubbles.
p165
aVEvery bubble is a country. The size is population.
p166
aVThe colors show the continent.
p167
aVThe yellow on there is the Americas;
p168
aVdark blue is Africa; brown is Europe;
p169
aVgreen is the Middle East
p170
aVand this light blue is South Asia.
p171
aVThat's India and this is China. Size is population.
p172
aVHere I have children per woman:
p173
aVtwo children, four children, six children, eight children \u2014
p174
aVbig families, small families.
p175
aVThe year is 1960.
p176
aVAnd down here, child survival,
p177
aVthe percentage of children surviving childhood
p178
aVup to starting school:
p179
aV60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90,
p180
aVand almost 100 percent, as we have today
p181
aVin the wealthiest and healthiest countries.
p182
aVBut look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960:
p183
aVone billion Western world here \u2014
p184
aVhigh child-survival, small families \u2014
p185
aVand all the rest,
p186
aVthe rainbow of developing countries,
p187
aVwith very large families
p188
aVand poor child survival.
p189
aa(lp190
VWhat has happened? I start the world. Here we go.
p191
aVCan you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?
p192
aVThey get soap, hygiene, education,
p193
aVvaccination, penicillin
p194
aVand then family planning. Family size is decreasing.
p195
aV[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease,
p196
aVand most of the Arab countries in the Middle East
p197
aVis falling down there [to small families].
p198
aVLook, Bangladesh catching up with India.
p199
aVThe whole emerging world
p200
aVjoins the Western world
p201
aVwith good child survival
p202
aVand small family size,
p203
aVbut we still have the poorest billion.
p204
aVCan you see the poorest billion,
p205
aVthose [two] boxes I had over here?
p206
aVThey are still up here.
p207
aVAnd they still have a child survival
p208
aVof only 70 to 80 percent,
p209
aVmeaning that if you have six children born,
p210
aVthere will be at least four who survive
p211
aVto the next generation.
p212
aVAnd the population will double in one generation.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo the only way
p215
aVof really getting world population [growth] to stop
p216
aVis to continue to improve child survival
p217
aVto 90 percent.
p218
aVThat's why investments by Gates Foundation,
p219
aVUNICEF and aid organizations,
p220
aVtogether with national government in the poorest countries,
p221
aVare so good;
p222
aVbecause they are actually
p223
aVhelping us to reach
p224
aVa sustainable population size of the world.
p225
aVWe can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.
p226
aVChild survival is the new green.
p227
aVIt's only by child survival
p228
aVthat we will stop population growth.
p229
aVAnd will it happen?
p230
aVWell, I'm not an optimist,
p231
aVneither am I a pessimist.
p232
aVI'm a very serious "possibilist."
p233
aVIt's a new category where we take emotion apart,
p234
aVand we just work analytically with the world.
p235
aVIt can be done.
p236
aVWe can have a much more just world.
p237
aVWith green technology
p238
aVand with investments to alleviate poverty,
p239
aVand global governance,
p240
aVthe world can become like this.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd look at the position of the old West.
p243
aVRemember when this blue box was all alone,
p244
aVleading the world, living its own life.
p245
aVThis will not happen [again].
p246
aVThe role of the old West in the new world
p247
aVis to become the foundation
p248
aVof the modern world \u2014
p249
aVnothing more, nothing less.
p250
aVBut it's a very important role.
p251
aVDo it well and get used to it.
p252
aa(lp253
VThank you very much.

A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />As if all this weren&#39;t enough, the irrepressible Rosling is also an accomplished sword-swallower &mdash; a skill he demonstrated at TED2007.<br /><br /><br /> </p>", "slug": "hans_rosling", "whotheyare": "In Hans Rosling\\u2019s hands, data sings.

"<p>Even the most worldly and well-traveled among us will have their perspectives shifted by Hans Rosling. A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />As if all this weren&#39;t enough, the irrepressible Rosling is also an accomplished sword-swallower &mdash; a skill he demonstrated at TED2007.<br /><br /><br /> </p>", "slug": "hans_rosling", "whotheyare": "In Hans Rosling\\u2019s hands, data sings.

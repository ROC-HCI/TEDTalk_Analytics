VWe live in a very complex environment:
p5
aVcomplexity and dynamism
p6
aVand patterns of evidence
p7
aVfrom satellite photographs, from videos.
p8
aVYou can even see it outside your window.
p9
aVIt's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar,
p10
aVbut the patterns kind of repeat,
p11
aVbut they never repeat exactly.
p12
aVIt's a huge challenge to understand.
p13
aVThe patterns that you see
p14
aVare there at all of the different scales,
p15
aVbut you can't chop it into one little bit and say,
p16
aV"Oh, well let me just make a smaller climate."
p17
aVI can't use the normal products of reductionism
p18
aVto get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study
p19
aVin a laboratory and say, "Oh,
p20
aVnow that's something I now understand."
p21
aVIt's the whole or it's nothing.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe different scales that give you
p24
aVthese kinds of patterns
p25
aVrange over an enormous range of magnitude,
p26
aVroughly 14 orders of magnitude,
p27
aVfrom the small microscopic particles
p28
aVthat seed clouds
p29
aVto the size of the planet itself,
p30
aVfrom 10 to the minus six
p31
aVto 10 to the eight,
p32
aV14 orders of spatial magnitude.
p33
aVIn time, from milliseconds to millennia,
p34
aVagain around 14 orders of magnitude.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhat does that mean?
p37
aVOkay, well if you think about how
p38
aVyou can calculate these things,
p39
aVyou can take what you can see,
p40
aVokay, I'm going to chop it up
p41
aVinto lots of little boxes,
p42
aVand that's the result of physics, right?
p43
aVAnd if I think about a weather model,
p44
aVthat spans about five orders of magnitude,
p45
aVfrom the planet to a few kilometers,
p46
aVand the time scale
p47
aVfrom a few minutes to 10 days, maybe a month.
p48
aVWe're interested in more than that.
p49
aVWe're interested in the climate.
p50
aVThat's years, that's millennia,
p51
aVand we need to go to even smaller scales.
p52
aVThe stuff that we can't resolve,
p53
aVthe sub-scale processes,
p54
aVwe need to approximate in some way.
p55
aVThat is a huge challenge.
p56
aVClimate models in the 1990s
p57
aVtook an even smaller chunk of that,
p58
aVonly about three orders of magnitude.
p59
aVClimate models in the 2010s,
p60
aVkind of what we're working with now,
p61
aVfour orders of magnitude.
p62
aVWe have 14 to go,
p63
aVand we're increasing our capability
p64
aVof simulating those at about
p65
aVone extra order of magnitude every decade.
p66
aVOne extra order of magnitude in space
p67
aVis 10,000 times more calculations.
p68
aVAnd we keep adding more things,
p69
aVmore questions to these different models.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo what does a climate model look like?
p72
aVThis is an old climate model, admittedly,
p73
aVa punch card, a single line of Fortran code.
p74
aVWe no longer use punch cards.
p75
aVWe do still use Fortran.
p76
aVNew-fangled ideas like C
p77
aVreally haven't had a big impact
p78
aVon the climate modeling community.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut how do we go about doing it?
p81
aVHow do we go from that complexity that you saw
p82
aVto a line of code?
p83
aVWe do it one piece at a time.
p84
aVThis is a picture of sea ice
p85
aVtaken flying over the Arctic.
p86
aVWe can look at all of the different equations
p87
aVthat go into making the ice grow
p88
aVor melt or change shape.
p89
aVWe can look at the fluxes.
p90
aVWe can look at the rate at which
p91
aVsnow turns to ice, and we can code that.
p92
aVWe can encapsulate that in code.
p93
aVThese models are around
p94
aVa million lines of code at this point,
p95
aVand growing by tens of thousands of lines of code
p96
aVevery year.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo you can look at that piece,
p99
aVbut you can look at the other pieces too.
p100
aVWhat happens when you have clouds?
p101
aVWhat happens when clouds form,
p102
aVwhen they dissipate, when they rain out?
p103
aVThat's another piece.
p104
aVWhat happens when we have radiation
p105
aVcoming from the sun, going through the atmosphere,
p106
aVbeing absorbed and reflected?
p107
aVWe can code each of those very small pieces as well.
p108
aVThere are other pieces:
p109
aVthe winds changing the ocean currents.
p110
aVWe can talk about the role of vegetation
p111
aVin transporting water from the soils
p112
aVback into the atmosphere.
p113
aVAnd each of these different elements
p114
aVwe can encapsulate and put into a system.
p115
aVEach of those pieces ends up adding to the whole.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd you get something like this.
p118
aVYou get a beautiful representation
p119
aVof what's going on in the climate system,
p120
aVwhere each and every one of those
p121
aVemergent patterns that you can see,
p122
aVthe swirls in the Southern Ocean,
p123
aVthe tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico,
p124
aVand there's two more that are going to pop up
p125
aVin the Pacific at any point now,
p126
aVthose rivers of atmospheric water,
p127
aVall of those are emergent properties
p128
aVthat come from the interactions
p129
aVof all of those small-scale processes I mentioned.
p130
aVThere's no code that says,
p131
aV"Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean."
p132
aVThere's no code that says, "Have two
p133
aVtropical cyclones that spin around each other."
p134
aVAll of those things are emergent properties.
p135
aa(lp136
VThis is all very good. This is all great.
p137
aVBut what we really want to know
p138
aVis what happens to these emergent properties
p139
aVwhen we kick the system?
p140
aVWhen something changes, what happens to those properties?
p141
aVAnd there's lots of different ways to kick the system.
p142
aVThere are wobbles in the Earth's orbit
p143
aVover hundreds of thousands of years
p144
aVthat change the climate.
p145
aVThere are changes in the solar cycles,
p146
aVevery 11 years and longer, that change the climate.
p147
aVBig volcanoes go off and change the climate.
p148
aVChanges in biomass burning, in smoke,
p149
aVin aerosol particles, all of those things
p150
aVchange the climate.
p151
aVThe ozone hole changed the climate.
p152
aVDeforestation changes the climate
p153
aVby changing the surface properties
p154
aVand how water is evaporated
p155
aVand moved around in the system.
p156
aVContrails change the climate
p157
aVby creating clouds where there were none before,
p158
aVand of course greenhouse gases change the system.
p159
aa(lp160
VEach of these different kicks
p161
aVprovides us with a target
p162
aVto evaluate whether we understand
p163
aVsomething about this system.
p164
aVSo we can go to look at
p165
aVwhat model skill is.
p166
aVNow I use the word "skill" advisedly:
p167
aVModels are not right or wrong; they're always wrong.
p168
aVThey're always approximations.
p169
aVThe question you have to ask
p170
aVis whether a model tells you more information
p171
aVthan you would have had otherwise.
p172
aVIf it does, it's skillful.
p173
aVThis is the impact of the ozone hole
p174
aVon sea level pressure, so low pressure, high pressures,
p175
aVaround the southern oceans, around Antarctica.
p176
aVThis is observed data.
p177
aVThis is modeled data.
p178
aVThere's a good match
p179
aVbecause we understand the physics
p180
aVthat controls the temperatures in the stratosphere
p181
aVand what that does to the winds
p182
aVaround the southern oceans.
p183
aa(lp184
VWe can look at other examples.
p185
aVThe eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991
p186
aVput an enormous amount of aerosols, small particles,
p187
aVinto the stratosphere.
p188
aVThat changed the radiation balance of the whole planet.
p189
aVThere was less energy coming in than there was before,
p190
aVso that cooled the planet,
p191
aVand those red lines and those green lines,
p192
aVthose are the differences between what we expected
p193
aVand what actually happened.
p194
aVThe models are skillful,
p195
aVnot just in the global mean,
p196
aVbut also in the regional patterns.
p197
aa(lp198
VI could go through a dozen more examples:
p199
aVthe skill associated with solar cycles,
p200
aVchanging the ozone in the stratosphere;
p201
aVthe skill associated with orbital changes
p202
aVover 6,000 years.
p203
aVWe can look at that too, and the models are skillful.
p204
aVThe models are skillful in response to the ice sheets
p205
aV20,000 years ago.
p206
aVThe models are skillful
p207
aVwhen it comes to the 20th-century trends
p208
aVover the decades.
p209
aVModels are successful at modeling
p210
aVlake outbursts into the North Atlantic
p211
aV8,000 years ago.
p212
aVAnd we can get a good match to the data.
p213
aa(lp214
VEach of these different targets,
p215
aVeach of these different evaluations,
p216
aVleads us to add more scope
p217
aVto these models,
p218
aVand leads us to more and more
p219
aVcomplex situations that we can ask
p220
aVmore and more interesting questions,
p221
aVlike, how does dust from the Sahara,
p222
aVthat you can see in the orange,
p223
aVinteract with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic?
p224
aVHow do organic aerosols from biomass burning,
p225
aVwhich you can see in the red dots,
p226
aVintersect with clouds and rainfall patterns?
p227
aVHow does pollution, which you can see
p228
aVin the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe,
p229
aVhow does that affect the temperatures at the surface
p230
aVand the sunlight that you get at the surface?
p231
aa(lp232
VWe can look at this across the world.
p233
aVWe can look at the pollution from China.
p234
aVWe can look at the impacts of storms
p235
aVon sea salt particles in the atmosphere.
p236
aVWe can see the combination
p237
aVof all of these different things
p238
aVhappening all at once,
p239
aVand we can ask much more interesting questions.
p240
aVHow do air pollution and climate coexist?
p241
aVCan we change things
p242
aVthat affect air pollution and climate at the same time?
p243
aVThe answer is yes.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo this is a history of the 20th century.
p246
aVThe first one is the model.
p247
aVThe weather is a little bit different
p248
aVto what actually happened.
p249
aVThe second one are the observations.
p250
aVAnd we're going through the 1930s.
p251
aVThere's variability, there are things going on,
p252
aVbut it's all kind of in the noise.
p253
aVAs you get towards the 1970s,
p254
aVthings are going to start to change.
p255
aVThey're going to start to look more similar,
p256
aVand by the time you get to the 2000s,
p257
aVyou're already seeing the patterns of global warming,
p258
aVboth in the observations and in the model.
p259
aa(lp260
VWe know what happened over the 20th century.
p261
aVRight? We know that it's gotten warmer.
p262
aVWe know where it's gotten warmer.
p263
aVAnd if you ask the models why did that happen,
p264
aVand you say, okay, well, yes,
p265
aVbasically it's because of the carbon dioxide
p266
aVwe put into the atmosphere.
p267
aVWe have a very good match
p268
aVup until the present day.
p269
aa(lp270
VBut there's one key reason why we look at models,
p271
aVand that's because of this phrase here.
p272
aVBecause if we had observations of the future,
p273
aVwe obviously would trust them more than models,
p274
aVBut unfortunately,
p275
aVobservations of the future are not available at this time.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo when we go out into the future, there's a difference.
p278
aVThe future is unknown, the future is uncertain,
p279
aVand there are choices.
p280
aVHere are the choices that we have.
p281
aVWe can do some work to mitigate
p282
aVthe emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
p283
aVThat's the top one.
p284
aVWe can do more work
p285
aVto really bring it down
p286
aVso that by the end of the century,
p287
aVit's not much more than there is now.
p288
aVOr we can just leave it to fate
p289
aVand continue on
p290
aVwith a business-as-usual type of attitude.
p291
aVThe differences between these choices
p292
aVcan't be answered by looking at models.
p293
aa(lp294
VThere's a great phrase
p295
aVthat Sherwood Rowland,
p296
aVwho won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry
p297
aVthat led to ozone depletion,
p298
aVwhen he was accepting his Nobel Prize,
p299
aVhe asked this question:
p300
aV"What is the use of having developed a science
p301
aVwell enough to make predictions if, in the end,
p302
aVall we're willing to do is stand around
p303
aVand wait for them to come true?"
p304
aVThe models are skillful,
p305
aVbut what we do with the information from those models
p306
aVis totally up to you.
p307
aa(lp308
VThank you.

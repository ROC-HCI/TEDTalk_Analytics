VI want to discuss with you this afternoon
p5
aVwhy you're going to fail to have a great career.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI'm an economist.
p10
aa(lp11
VI do dismal.
p12
aVEnd of the day, it's ready for dismal remarks.
p13
aVI only want to talk to those of you who want a great career.
p14
aVI know some of you have already decided you want a good career.
p15
aVYou're going to fail, too.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VBecause \u2014 goodness, you're all cheery about failing.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VCanadian group, undoubtedly.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VThose trying to have good careers are going to fail,
p28
aVbecause, really, good jobs are now disappearing.
p29
aVThere are great jobs and great careers,
p30
aVand then there are the high-workload,
p31
aVhigh-stress, bloodsucking, soul-destroying kinds of jobs,
p32
aVand practically nothing in-between.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo people looking for good jobs are going to fail.
p35
aVI want to talk about those looking for great jobs, great careers,
p36
aVand why you're going to fail.
p37
aVFirst reason is that no matter how many times people tell you,
p38
aV"If you want a great career, you have to pursue your passion,
p39
aVyou have to pursue your dreams, you have to pursue
p40
aVthe greatest fascination in your life,"
p41
aVyou hear it again and again, and then you decide not to do it.
p42
aVIt doesn't matter how many times you download
p43
aVSteven J.'s Stanford commencement address,
p44
aVyou still look at it and decide not to do it.
p45
aa(lp46
VI'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it.
p47
aVYou're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.
p48
aVYou're afraid if you look for your passion and don't find it,
p49
aVyou'll feel like you're an idiot, so then you make excuses
p50
aVabout why you're not going to look for your passion.
p51
aVThey are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.
p52
aVWe're going to go through a whole long list \u2014
p53
aVyour creativity in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do
p54
aVif you want to have a great career.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo, for example, one of your great excuses is:
p57
aa(lp58
V(Sigh)
p59
aa(lp60
V"Well, great careers are really and truly, for most people,
p61
aVjust a matter of luck.
p62
aVSo I'm going to stand around, I'm going to try to be lucky,
p63
aVand if I'm lucky, I'll have a great career.
p64
aVIf not, I'll have a good career."
p65
aVBut a good career is an impossibility, so that's not going to work.
p66
aa(lp67
VThen, your other excuse is,
p68
aV"Yes, there are special people who pursue their passions,
p69
aVbut they are geniuses.
p70
aVThey are Steven J.
p71
aVI'm not a genius.
p72
aVWhen I was five, I thought I was a genius,
p73
aVbut my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since."
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
V"And now I know I am completely competent."
p78
aVNow, you see, if this was 1950,
p79
aVbeing completely competent \u2014
p80
aVthat would have given you a great career.
p81
aVBut guess what?
p82
aVThis is almost 2012, and saying to the world,
p83
aV"I am totally, completely competent,"
p84
aVis damning yourself with the faintest of praise.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd then, of course, another excuse:
p87
aV"Well, I would do this, I would do this, but, but \u2014
p88
aVwell, after all, I'm not weird.
p89
aVEverybody knows that people who pursue their passions
p90
aVare somewhat obsessive.
p91
aVA little strange.
p92
aVHmm? Hmm? Okay?
p93
aVYou know, a fine line between madness and genius.
p94
aV"I'm not weird. I've read Steven J.'s biography.
p95
aVOh my goodness \u2014 I'm not that person. I am nice.
p96
aVI am normal.
p97
aVI'm a nice, normal person, and nice, normal people \u2014
p98
aVdon't have passion."
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
V"Ah, but I still want a great career.
p103
aVI'm not prepared to pursue my passion,
p104
aVso I know what I'm going to do,
p105
aVbecause I have a solution.
p106
aVI have a strategy.
p107
aVIt's the one Mommy and Daddy told me about.
p108
aVMommy and Daddy told me that if I worked hard,
p109
aVI'd have a good career.
p110
aVSo, if you work hard and have a good career,
p111
aVif you work really, really, really hard,
p112
aVyou'll have a great career.
p113
aVDoesn't that, like, mathematically make sense?"
p114
aVHmm. Not.
p115
aVBut you've managed to talk yourself into that.
p116
aa(lp117
VYou know what? Here's a little secret:
p118
aVYou want to work? You want to work really, really, really hard?
p119
aVYou know what? You'll succeed.
p120
aVThe world will give you the opportunity
p121
aVto work really, really, really, really hard.
p122
aVBut, are you so sure
p123
aVthat that's going to give you a great career,
p124
aVwhen all the evidence is to the contrary?
p125
aa(lp126
VSo let's deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion.
p127
aVYou actually understand that you really had better do it,
p128
aVnever mind the excuses.
p129
aVYou're trying to find your passion \u2014
p130
aa(lp131
V(Sigh)
p132
aa(lp133
Vand you're so happy.
p134
aVYou found something you're interested in.
p135
aa(lp136
V"I have an interest! I have an interest!"
p137
aa(lp138
VYou tell me.
p139
aVYou say, "I have an interest!" I say, "That's wonderful!
p140
aVAnd what are you trying to tell me?"
p141
aV"Well, I have an interest."
p142
aVI say, "Do you have passion?"
p143
aV"I have an interest," you say.
p144
aV"Your interest is compared to what?"
p145
aV"Well, I'm interested in this."
p146
aV"And what about the rest of humanity's activities?"
p147
aV"I'm not interested in them."
p148
aV"You've looked at them all, have you?"
p149
aV"No. Not exactly."
p150
aa(lp151
VPassion is your greatest love.
p152
aVPassion is the thing
p153
aVthat will help you create the highest expression of your talent.
p154
aVPassion, interest \u2014 it's not the same thing.
p155
aVAre you really going to go to your sweetie and say,
p156
aV"Marry me! You're interesting."
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VWon't happen.
p161
aVWon't happen, and you will die alone.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VWhat you want,
p166
aVwhat you want, what you want,
p167
aVis passion.
p168
aVIt is beyond interest.
p169
aVYou need 20 interests, and then one of them,
p170
aVone of them might grab you,
p171
aVone of them might engage you more than anything else,
p172
aVand then you may have found your greatest love,
p173
aVin comparison to all the other things that interest you,
p174
aVand that's what passion is.
p175
aa(lp176
VI have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.
p177
aVHe was an economically rational person.
p178
aVHe said to his sweetie, "Let us marry.
p179
aVLet us merge our interests."
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VYes, he did.
p184
aa(lp185
V"I love you truly," he said. "I love you deeply.
p186
aVI love you more than any other woman I've ever encountered.
p187
aVI love you more than Mary, Jane, Susie, Penelope,
p188
aVIngrid, Gertrude, Gretel \u2014
p189
aVI was on a German exchange program then.
p190
aVI love you more than \u2014"
p191
aVAll right.
p192
aVShe left the room
p193
aVhalfway through his enumeration of his love for her.
p194
aVAfter he got over his surprise at being, you know, turned down,
p195
aVhe concluded he'd had a narrow escape
p196
aVfrom marrying an irrational person.
p197
aVAlthough, he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed,
p198
aVit was perhaps not necessary
p199
aVto enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VBut the point stands.
p204
aVYou must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny,
p205
aVor are you afraid of the word "destiny"?
p206
aVDoes the word "destiny" scare you?
p207
aVThat's what we're talking about.
p208
aVAnd if you don't find the highest expression of your talent,
p209
aVif you settle for "interesting," what the hell ever that means,
p210
aVdo you know what will happen at the end of your long life?
p211
aVYour friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery,
p212
aVand there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone,
p213
aVand inscribed on that tombstone
p214
aVit will say, "Here lies a distinguished engineer,
p215
aVwho invented Velcro."
p216
aVBut what that tombstone should have said,
p217
aVin an alternative lifetime,
p218
aVwhat it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent,
p219
aVwas, "Here lies the last Nobel Laureate in Physics,
p220
aVwho formulated the Grand Unified Field Theory
p221
aVand demonstrated the practicality of warp drive."
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VVelcro, indeed!
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VOne was a great career.
p230
aVOne was a missed opportunity.
p231
aVBut then, there are some of you who,
p232
aVin spite of all these excuses, you will find,
p233
aVyou will find your passion.
p234
aVAnd you'll still fail.
p235
aa(lp236
VYou're going to fail, because \u2014
p237
aVbecause you're not going to do it,
p238
aVbecause you will have invented a new excuse,
p239
aVany excuse to fail to take action,
p240
aVand this excuse, I've heard so many times:
p241
aV"Yes, I would pursue a great career,
p242
aVbut, I value human relationships \u2014
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
Vmore than accomplishment.
p247
aVI want to be a great friend.
p248
aVI want to be a great spouse.
p249
aVI want to be a great parent,
p250
aVand I will not sacrifice them
p251
aVon the altar of great accomplishment."
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VWhat do you want me to say?
p256
aVNow, do you really want me to say now, tell you,
p257
aV"Really, I swear I don't kick children."
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VLook at the worldview you've given yourself.
p262
aVYou're a hero no matter what.
p263
aVAnd I, by suggesting ever so delicately
p264
aVthat you might want a great career, must hate children.
p265
aVI don't hate children. I don't kick them.
p266
aVYes, there was a little kid wandering through this building
p267
aVwhen I came here, and no, I didn't kick him.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VCourse, I had to tell him the building was for adults only,
p272
aVand to get out.
p273
aVHe mumbled something about his mother,
p274
aVand I told him she'd probably find him outside anyway.
p275
aVLast time I saw him, he was on the stairs crying.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VWhat a wimp.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VBut what do you mean? That's what you expect me to say.
p284
aVDo you really think it's appropriate
p285
aVthat you should actually take children and use them as a shield?
p286
aVYou know what will happen someday,
p287
aVyou ideal parent, you?
p288
aVThe kid will come to you someday and say,
p289
aV"I know what I want to be.
p290
aVI know what I'm going to do with my life."
p291
aVYou are so happy.
p292
aVIt's the conversation a parent wants to hear,
p293
aVbecause your kid's good in math,
p294
aVand you know you're going to like what comes next.
p295
aVSays your kid,
p296
aV"I have decided I want to be a magician.
p297
aVI want to perform magic tricks on the stage."
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd what do you say?
p302
aVYou say, you say,
p303
aV"That's risky, kid.
p304
aVMight fail, kid. Don't make a lot of money at that, kid.
p305
aVI don't know, kid, you should think about that again, kid.
p306
aVYou're so good at math, why don't you \u2014"
p307
aa(lp308
VThe kid interrupts you and says,
p309
aV"But it is my dream. It is my dream to do this."
p310
aVAnd what are you going to say?
p311
aVYou know what you're going to say?
p312
aV"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but \u2014
p313
aVBut \u2014"
p314
aVSo how are you going to finish the sentence with your "but"?
p315
aV"But. I had a dream too, once, kid, but I was afraid to pursue it."
p316
aVOr are you going to tell him this:
p317
aV"I had a dream once, kid.
p318
aVBut then, you were born."
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
V(Applause)
p323
aa(lp324
VDo you really want to use your family,
p325
aVdo you really ever want to look at your spouse and your kid,
p326
aVand see your jailers?
p327
aVThere was something you could have said to your kid,
p328
aVwhen he or she said, "I have a dream."
p329
aVYou could have said \u2014
p330
aVlooked the kid in the face and said,
p331
aV"Go for it, kid!
p332
aVJust like I did."
p333
aVBut you won't be able to say that,
p334
aVbecause you didn't.
p335
aVSo you can't.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd so the sins of the parents
p340
aVare visited on the poor children.
p341
aVWhy will you seek refuge in human relationships
p342
aVas your excuse not to find and pursue your passion?
p343
aVYou know why.
p344
aVIn your heart of hearts, you know why,
p345
aVand I'm being deadly serious.
p346
aVYou know why you would get all warm and fuzzy
p347
aVand wrap yourself up in human relationships.
p348
aVIt is because you are \u2014
p349
aVyou know what you are.
p350
aa(lp351
VYou're afraid to pursue your passion.
p352
aVYou're afraid to look ridiculous.
p353
aVYou're afraid to try.
p354
aVYou're afraid you may fail.
p355
aVGreat friend, great spouse, great parent, great career.
p356
aVIs that not a package? Is that not who you are?
p357
aVHow can you be one without the other?
p358
aVBut you're afraid.
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd that's why you're not going to have a great career.
p361
aVUnless \u2014
p362
aV"unless," that most evocative of all English words \u2014
p363
aV"unless."
p364
aVBut the "unless" word is also attached
p365
aVto that other, most terrifying phrase,
p366
aV"If only I had ..."
p367
aV"If only I had ..."
p368
aVIf you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain,
p369
aVit will hurt a lot.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo, those are the many reasons
p372
aVwhy you are going to fail
p373
aVto have a great career.
p374
aVUnless \u2014
p375
aa(lp376
VUnless.
p377
aa(lp378
VThank you.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Applause)

VToday's computers are so amazing
p5
aVthat we fail to notice how terrible they really are.
p6
aVI'd like to talk to you today about this problem,
p7
aVand how we can fix it with neuroscience.
p8
aa(lp9
VFirst, I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011
p10
aVthat had a profound impact on me.
p11
aVI was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University,
p12
aVwhere I studied computer science and neuroscience,
p13
aVand I was having this great conversation with a fellow student
p14
aVabout the power of holograms to one day replace computers.
p15
aVAnd just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation,
p16
aVof course, his phone lights up.
p17
aVAnd he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing.
p18
aVAnd then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes,
p19
aV"Keep going. I'm with you."
p20
aVBut of course his eyes were glazed over,
p21
aVand the moment was dead.
p22
aa(lp23
VMeanwhile across the bar,
p24
aVI noticed another student holding his phone,
p25
aVthis time towards a group.
p26
aVHe was swiping through pictures on Instagram,
p27
aVand these kids were laughing hysterically.
p28
aVAnd that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling
p29
aVand how happy they were feeling about the same technology,
p30
aVreally got me thinking.
p31
aVAnd the more I thought of it, the more I realized
p32
aVit was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here,
p33
aVit was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend
p34
aVand that was binding those kids together.
p35
aa(lp36
VSee, they were connected around something,
p37
aVjust like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions
p38
aVtelling stories around the campfire.
p39
aVAnd that's exactly what tools should do, I think.
p40
aVThey should extend our bodies.
p41
aVAnd I think computers today are doing quite the opposite.
p42
aVWhether you're sending an email to your wife
p43
aVor you're composing a symphony
p44
aVor just consoling a friend,
p45
aVyou're doing it in pretty much the same way.
p46
aVYou're hunched over these rectangles,
p47
aVfumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles.
p48
aVAnd I think this is the wrong way,
p49
aVI think we can start using a much more natural machine.
p50
aVWe should use machines that bring our work back into the world.
p51
aVWe should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience
p52
aVto extend our senses versus going against them.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow it just so happens that I have such a machine here.
p55
aVIt's called the Meta 2.
p56
aVLet's try it out.
p57
aVNow in front of me right now, I can see the audience,
p58
aVand I can see my very hands.
p59
aVAnd in three, two, one,
p60
aVwe're going to see an immersive hologram appear,
p61
aVa very realistic hologram appear in front of me,
p62
aVof our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now.
p63
aVAnd of course this could be anything that we're shopping for
p64
aVor learning from,
p65
aVand I can use my hands
p66
aVto very nicely kind of move it around with fine control.
p67
aVAnd I think Iron Man would be proud.
p68
aVWe're going to come back to this in just a bit.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Applause)
p71
aa(lp72
VNow if you're anything like me, your mind is already reeling
p73
aVwith the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology,
p74
aVso let's look at a few.
p75
aa(lp76
VMy mom is an architect,
p77
aVso naturally the first thing I imagined
p78
aVwas laying out a building in 3D space
p79
aVinstead of having to use these 2D floor plans.
p80
aVShe's actually touching graphics right now
p81
aVand selecting an interior decor.
p82
aVThis was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd this next use case is very personal to me,
p85
aVit's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project,
p86
aVcourtesy of UCSF.
p87
aVAs a neuroscience student,
p88
aVI would always fantasize
p89
aVabout the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures
p90
aVwith an actual machine,
p91
aVwhere I could touch and play with the various brain structures.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow what you're seeing is called augmented reality,
p94
aVbut to me, it's part of a much more important story \u2014
p95
aVa story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices,
p96
aVinstead of the other way around.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow ...
p99
aVin the next few years, humanity's going to go through a shift, I think.
p100
aVWe're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information
p101
aVon the real world.
p102
aVJust imagine for a moment
p103
aVwhat this could mean for storytellers,
p104
aVfor painters,
p105
aVfor brain surgeons,
p106
aVfor interior decorators
p107
aVand maybe for all of us here today.
p108
aVAnd what I think we need to do as a community,
p109
aVis really try and make an effort
p110
aVto imagine how we can create this new reality
p111
aVin a way that extends the human experience,
p112
aVinstead of gamifying our reality
p113
aVor cluttering it with digital information.
p114
aVAnd that's what I'm very passionate about.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, I want to tell you a little secret.
p117
aVIn about five years \u2014
p118
aVthis is not the smallest device \u2014
p119
aVin about five years,
p120
aVthese are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes
p121
aVthat project holograms.
p122
aVAnd just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy
p123
aVin terms of the hardware \u2014 we buy it for the operating system \u2014
p124
aVas a neuroscientist,
p125
aVI always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind, if you will.
p126
aVAnd it's very, very important that we get this right,
p127
aVbecause we might be living inside of these things
p128
aVfor at least as long as we've lived
p129
aVwith the Windows graphical user interface.
p130
aVAnd I don't know about you,
p131
aVbut living inside of Windows scares me.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VTo isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity,
p136
aVwe use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines,
p137
aVinstead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom.
p138
aVAnd the principle we all revolve around
p139
aVis what's called the "Neural Path of Least Resistance."
p140
aa(lp141
VAt every turn, we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain
p142
aVon, for the first time, our brain's terms.
p143
aVIn other words, we're trying to create a zero learning-curve computer.
p144
aVWe're building a system that you've always known how to use.
p145
aa(lp146
VHere are the first three design guidelines that we employ
p147
aVin this brand-new form of user experience.
p148
aVFirst and foremost, you are the operating system.
p149
aVTraditional file systems are complex and abstract,
p150
aVand they take your brain extra steps to decode them.
p151
aVWe're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance.
p152
aVMeanwhile, in augmented reality,
p153
aVyou can of course place your holographic TED panel over here,
p154
aVand your holographic email on the other side of the desk,
p155
aVand your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them.
p156
aVYou could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for \u2014
p157
aVor whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VPerfect. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe second interface guideline we call "touch to see."
p164
aVWhat do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest?
p165
aVThey try and reach out and touch it.
p166
aVAnd that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well.
p167
aVTurns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost
p168
aVfrom a sense we call proprioception \u2014
p169
aVthat's the sense of our body parts in space.
p170
aVSo by touching our work directly, we're not only going to control it better,
p171
aVwe're also going to understand it much more deeply.
p172
aVHence, touch to see.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut it's not enough to experience things ourselves.
p175
aVWe're inherently these social primates.
p176
aVAnd this leads me to our third guideline,
p177
aVthe holographic campfire from our first story.
p178
aa(lp179
VOur mirror-neuron subsystem suggests
p180
aVthat we can connect with each other and with our work much better
p181
aVif we can see each other's faces and hands in 3D.
p182
aVSo if you look at the video behind me,
p183
aVyou can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram,
p184
aVmaking eye contact, connected around this thing,
p185
aVinstead of being distracted by external devices.
p186
aa(lp187
VLet's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind.
p188
aVSo again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind.
p189
aVI'm going to now take a step further
p190
aVand go ahead and grab this pair of glasses
p191
aVand leave it right here by the desk.
p192
aVI'm now with you, I'm in the moment,
p193
aVwe're connecting.
p194
aVMy spatial memory kicks in, and I can go ahead and grab it
p195
aVand bring it right back here, reminding me
p196
aVthat I am the operating system.
p197
aVAnd now my proprioception is working,
p198
aVand I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts
p199
aVand touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand.
p200
aa(lp201
VBut it's not enough to see things alone,
p202
aVso in a second, my co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call \u2014
p203
aVRay?
p204
aa(lp205
V(Ringing)
p206
aa(lp207
VHey Ray, how's it going?
p208
aVGuys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D.
p209
aVAnd he is photo-realistic.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Applause)
p212
aa(lp213
VThank you.
p214
aa(lp215
VMy mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones
p216
aVin not too long.
p217
aVRay, how's it going?
p218
aa(lp219
VRay: Great. We're live today.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Applause)
p222
aa(lp223
VMG: Ray, give the crowd a gift
p224
aVof the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier.
p225
aVGuys, this is not only going to change phones,
p226
aVit's also going to change the way we collaborate.
p227
aa(lp228
VThank you so much.
p229
aa(lp230
VThanks, Ray.
p231
aa(lp232
VRay: You're welcome.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Applause)
p235
aa(lp236
VMG: So folks, this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011:
p237
aVThe future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens.
p238
aVIt's right here, inside of us.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Applause)
p241
aa(lp242
VSo if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today,
p243
aVit's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future,
p244
aVit's right here in 2016.
p245
aVWhich is why all hundred of us at Meta,
p246
aVincluding the administrative staff,
p247
aVthe executives,
p248
aVthe designers, the engineers \u2014
p249
aVbefore TED2017,
p250
aVwe're all going to be throwing away our external monitors
p251
aVand replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine.
p252
aa(lp253
VThank you very much.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Applause)
p256
aa(lp257
VThank you, appreciate it.
p258
aVThanks, guys.
p259
aa(lp260
VChris Anderson: So help me out on one thing,
p261
aVbecause there've been a few augmented reality demos
p262
aVshown over the last year or so out there.
p263
aVAnd there's sometimes a debate among technologists
p264
aVabout, are we really seeing the real thing on-screen?
p265
aVThere's this issue of field of view,
p266
aVthat somehow the technology is showing a broader view
p267
aVthan you would actually see wearing the glasses.
p268
aVWere we seeing the real deal there?
p269
aa(lp270
VMG: Absolutely the real deal.
p271
aVNot only that,
p272
aVwe took extra measures to shoot it with a GoPro through the actual lens
p273
aVin the various videos that you've seen here.
p274
aVWe want to try to simulate the experience for the world
p275
aVthat we're actually seeing through the glasses,
p276
aVand not cut any corners.
p277
aa(lp278
VCA: Thank you so much for showing us that.
p279
aa(lp280
VMG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.

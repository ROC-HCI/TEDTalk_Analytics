VB.J. was one of many fellow inmates
p5
aVwho had big plans for the future.
p6
aVHe had a vision. When he got out,
p7
aVhe was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight,
p8
aVand he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.
p9
aVHe'd spent 10,000 dollars
p10
aVto buy a website that exclusively featured women
p11
aVhaving sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars. (Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VIt was my first week in federal prison,
p14
aVand I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.
p15
aVIn fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men
p16
aVwhose business instincts were in many cases
p17
aVas sharp as those of the CEOs
p18
aVwho had wined and dined me six months earlier
p19
aVwhen I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.
p20
aVNow, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with
p21
aVhad been drug dealers on the outside,
p22
aVbut when they talked about what they did,
p23
aVthey talked about it in a different jargon,
p24
aVbut the business concepts that they talked about
p25
aVweren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton:
p26
aVpromotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user,
p27
aVfocus-grouping new product launches,
p28
aVterritorial expansion.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.
p31
aVFor the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.
p32
aVIt's a lot harder than you might think.
p33
aVContrary to what most people think,
p34
aVpeople don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life
p35
aVwhen you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.
p36
aVYou've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant,
p37
aVtoothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.
p38
aVAnd it's hard for a couple of reasons.
p39
aVFirst, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent
p40
aVfrom what you'd pay on the street,
p41
aVand second, you don't make a lot of money.
p42
aVI unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job,
p43
aVunloading trucks at a food warehouse,
p44
aVfor $5.25, not an hour, but per month.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo how do you survive?
p47
aVWell, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.
p48
aVThere's legal hustles.
p49
aVYou pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.
p50
aVYou charge another inmate to clean his cell.
p51
aVThere's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.
p52
aVThere's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
p53
aVAnd there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in,
p54
aVyou get smuggled in, drugs, pornography,
p55
aVcell phones, and just as in the outer world,
p56
aVthere's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise,
p57
aVthe more profitable it can potentially be.
p58
aVYou want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.
p59
aVYou want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open
p60
aVand is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.
p61
aVYou want a dirty magazine?
p62
aVWell, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects
p65
aVof prison life is ingenuity.
p66
aVWhether it was concocting delicious meals
p67
aVfrom stolen scraps from the warehouse,
p68
aVsculpting people's hair with toenail clippers,
p69
aVor constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags
p70
aVtied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less,
p71
aVand many of them want to take this ingenuity
p72
aVthat they've learned to the outside
p73
aVand start restaurants, barber shops,
p74
aVpersonal training businesses.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that,
p77
aVno rehabilitation at all in prison,
p78
aVno one to help them write a business plan,
p79
aVfigure out a way to translate the business concepts
p80
aVthey intuitively grasp into legal enterprises,
p81
aVno access to the Internet, even.
p82
aVAnd then, when they come out, most states
p83
aVdon't even have a law prohibiting employers
p84
aVfrom discriminating against people with a background.
p85
aVSo none of us should be surprised
p86
aVthat two out of three ex-offenders re-offend
p87
aVwithin five years.
p88
aa(lp89
VLook, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.
p90
aVBut when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do
p91
aVwhatever I could to make sure
p92
aVthat guys like the ones I was locked up with
p93
aVdidn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.
p96
aVThe best thing we can do is figure out ways
p97
aVto nurture the entrepreneurial spirit
p98
aVand the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons,
p99
aVbecause if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills
p100
aVthat's going to help them, and they'll be right back.
p101
aVAll they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.
p102
aVThank you. (Applause)

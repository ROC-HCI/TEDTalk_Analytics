VHow many of you have been to Oklahoma City?
p5
aa(lp6
VRaise your hand. Yeah?
p7
aa(lp8
VHow many of you have not been to Oklahoma City
p9
aVand have no idea who I am? (Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VMost of you. Let me give you a little bit of background.
p12
aa(lp13
VOklahoma City started in the most
p14
aVunique way imaginable.
p15
aVBack on a spring day in 1889,
p16
aVthe federal government held what they called
p17
aVa land run.
p18
aVThey literally lined up the settlers
p19
aValong an imaginary line,
p20
aVand they fired off a gun,
p21
aVand the settlers roared across the countryside
p22
aVand put down a stake,
p23
aVand wherever they put down that stake,
p24
aVthat was their new home.
p25
aVAnd at the end of the very first day,
p26
aVthe population of Oklahoma City
p27
aVhad gone from zero to 10,000,
p28
aVand our planning department
p29
aVis still paying for that.
p30
aVThe citizens got together on that first day
p31
aVand elected a mayor.
p32
aVAnd then they shot him.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVThat's not really all that funny
p35
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p36
aVbut it allows me to see what type of audience
p37
aVI'm dealing with, so I appreciate the feedback.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe 20th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City.
p40
aVOur economy was based on commodities,
p41
aVso the price of cotton or the price of wheat,
p42
aVand ultimately the price of oil and natural gas.
p43
aVAnd along the way, we became a city
p44
aVof innovation.
p45
aVThe shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City.
p46
aV(Applause)
p47
aVThe parking meter, invented in Oklahoma City.
p48
aVYou're welcome.
p49
aa(lp50
VHaving an economy, though,
p51
aVthat relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs,
p52
aVand that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history.
p53
aVIn the 1970s, when it appeared
p54
aVthat the price of energy would never retreat,
p55
aVour economy was soaring,
p56
aVand then in the early 1980s, it cratered quickly.
p57
aVThe price of energy dropped.
p58
aVOur banks began to fail.
p59
aVBefore the end of the decade,
p60
aV100 banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma.
p61
aVThere was no bailout on the horizon.
p62
aVOur banking industry, our oil and gas industry,
p63
aVour commercial real estate industry,
p64
aVwere all at the bottom of the economic scale.
p65
aVYoung people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves
p66
aVfor Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo,
p67
aVanywhere where they could  find a job that measured up
p68
aVto their educational attainment,
p69
aVbecause in Oklahoma City, the good jobs just weren't there.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut along at the end of the '80s
p72
aVcame an enterprising businessman
p73
aVwho became mayor named Ron Norick.
p74
aVRon Norick eventually figured out
p75
aVthat the secret to economic development
p76
aVwasn't incentivizing companies up front,
p77
aVit was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate,
p78
aVand so he pushed an initiative called MAPS
p79
aVthat basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax
p80
aVto build a bunch of stuff.
p81
aVIt built a new sports arena,
p82
aVa new canal downtown,
p83
aVit fixed up our performing arts center,
p84
aVa new baseball stadium downtown,
p85
aVa lot of things to improve the quality of life.
p86
aVAnd the economy indeed seemed to start
p87
aVshowing some signs of life.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe next mayor came along.
p90
aVHe started MAPS for Kids,
p91
aVrebuilt the entire inner city school system,
p92
aVall 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd then, in 2004,
p95
aVin this rare collective lack of judgment
p96
aVbordering on civil disobedience,
p97
aVthe citizens elected me mayor.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow the city I inherited
p100
aVwas just on the verge
p101
aVof coming out of its slumbering economy,
p102
aVand for the very first time,
p103
aVwe started showing up on the lists.
p104
aVNow you know the lists I'm talking about.
p105
aVThe media and the Internet
p106
aVlove to rank cities.
p107
aVAnd in Oklahoma City,
p108
aVwe'd never really been on lists before.
p109
aVSo I thought it was kind of cool
p110
aVwhen they came out with these positive lists and we were on there.
p111
aVWe weren't anywhere close to the top,
p112
aVbut we were on the list, we were somebody.
p113
aVBest city to get a job,
p114
aVbest city to start a business,
p115
aVbest downtown \u2014
p116
aVOklahoma City.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd then came the list
p119
aVof the most obese cities in the country.
p120
aVAnd there we were.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow I like to point out that we were on that list
p123
aVwith a lot of really cool places.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVDallas and Houston and New Orleans
p126
aVand Atlanta and Miami.
p127
aVYou know, these are cities that, typically,
p128
aVyou're not embarrassed to be associated with.
p129
aVBut nonetheless, I didn't like being on the list.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd about that time, I got on the scales.
p132
aVAnd I weighed 220 pounds.
p133
aVAnd then I went to this website
p134
aVsponsored by the federal government,
p135
aVand I typed in my height, I typed in my weight,
p136
aVand I pushed Enter,
p137
aVand it came back and said "obese."
p138
aa(lp139
VI thought, "What a stupid website."
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aV"I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese."
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd then I started getting honest with myself
p144
aVabout what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity,
p145
aVand I noticed this pattern,
p146
aVthat I was gaining about two or three pounds a year,
p147
aVand then about every 10 years, I'd drop 20 or 30 pounds.
p148
aVAnd then I'd do it again.
p149
aVAnd I had this huge closet full of clothes,
p150
aVand I could only wear a third of it at any one time,
p151
aVand only I knew which part of the closet I could wear.
p152
aVBut it all seemed fairly normal, going through it.
p153
aa(lp154
VWell, I finally decided I needed to lose weight,
p155
aVand I knew I could because I'd done it so many times before,
p156
aVso I simply stopped eating as much.
p157
aVI had always exercised.
p158
aVThat really wasn't the part of the equation
p159
aVthat I needed to work on.
p160
aVBut I had been eating 3,000 calories a day,
p161
aVand I cut it to 2,000 calories a day,
p162
aVand the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week
p163
aVfor about 40 weeks.
p164
aa(lp165
VAlong the way, though,
p166
aVI started examining my city,
p167
aVits culture, its infrastructure,
p168
aVtrying to figure out why our specific city
p169
aVseemed to have a problem with obesity.
p170
aVAnd I came to the conclusion
p171
aVthat we had built an incredible quality of life
p172
aVif you happen to be a car.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVBut if you happen to be a person,
p175
aVyou are combatting the car seemingly at every turn.
p176
aVOur city is very spread out.
p177
aVWe have a great intersection of highways,
p178
aVI mean, literally no traffic congestion in Oklahoma City to speak of.
p179
aVAnd so people live far, far away.
p180
aVOur city limits are enormous, 620 square miles,
p181
aVbut 15 miles is less than 15 minutes.
p182
aVYou literally can get a speeding ticket
p183
aVduring rush hour in Oklahoma City.
p184
aVAnd as a result, people tend to spread out.
p185
aVLand's cheap.
p186
aVWe had also not required developers
p187
aVto build sidewalks on new developments  for a long, long time.
p188
aVWe had fixed that, but it had been relatively recently,
p189
aVand there were literally 100,000
p190
aVor more homes into our inventory
p191
aVin neighborhoods that had  virtually no level of walkability.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd as I tried to examine
p194
aVhow we might deal with obesity,
p195
aVand was taking all of these elements into my mind,
p196
aVI decided that the first thing we need to do
p197
aVwas have a conversation.
p198
aVYou see, in Oklahoma City,
p199
aVwe weren't talking about obesity.
p200
aVAnd so, on New Year's Eve of 2007,
p201
aVI went to the zoo,
p202
aVand I stood in front of the elephants,
p203
aVand I said, "This city is going on a diet,
p204
aVand we're going to lose a million pounds."
p205
aa(lp206
VWell, that's when all hell broke loose.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VThe national media
p211
aVgravitated toward this story immediately,
p212
aVand they really could have  gone with it one of two ways.
p213
aVThey could have said,
p214
aV"This city is so fat
p215
aVthat the mayor had to put them on a diet."
p216
aVBut fortunately, the consensus was,
p217
aV"Look, this is a problem in a lot of places.
p218
aVThis is a city that's wanting to do something about it."
p219
aVAnd so they started helping us
p220
aVdrive traffic to the website.
p221
aVNow, the web address was
p222
aVthiscityisgoingonadiet.com.
p223
aVAnd I appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"
p224
aVone weekday morning to talk about the initiative,
p225
aVand on that day, 150,000 visits
p226
aVwere placed to our website.
p227
aVPeople were signing up,
p228
aVand so the pounds started to add up,
p229
aVand the conversation that I thought
p230
aVwas so important to have was starting to take place.
p231
aVIt was taking place inside the homes,
p232
aVmothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.
p233
aVIt was taking place in churches.
p234
aVChurches were starting their own running groups
p235
aVand their own support groups
p236
aVfor people who were dealing with obesity.
p237
aVSuddenly, it was a topic worth discussing at schools
p238
aVand in the workplace.
p239
aVAnd the large companies, they typically have
p240
aVwonderful wellness programs,
p241
aVbut the medium-sized companies
p242
aVthat typically fall between the cracks on issues like this,
p243
aVthey started to get engaged and used our program
p244
aVas a model for their own employees
p245
aVto try and have contests to see
p246
aVwho might be able to deal with their obesity situation
p247
aVin a way that could be proactively beneficial to others.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd then came the next stage of the equation.
p250
aVIt was time to push what I called MAPS 3.
p251
aVNow MAPS 3, like the other two programs,
p252
aVhad had an economic development motive behind it,
p253
aVbut along with the traditional economic development tasks
p254
aVlike building a new convention center,
p255
aVwe added some health-related infrastructure
p256
aVto the process.
p257
aVWe added a new central park, 70 acres in size,
p258
aVto be right downtown in Oklahoma City.
p259
aVWe're building a downtown streetcar
p260
aVto try and help the walkability formula
p261
aVfor people who choose to live in the inner city
p262
aVand help us create the density there.
p263
aVWe're building senior health and wellness centers
p264
aVthroughout the community.
p265
aVWe put some investments on the river
p266
aVthat had originally been invested upon
p267
aVin the original MAPS,
p268
aVand now we are currently in the final stages
p269
aVof developing the finest venue in the world
p270
aVfor the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing.
p271
aVWe hosted the Olympic trials last spring.
p272
aVWe have Olympic-caliber events coming to Oklahoma City,
p273
aVand athletes from all over the world moving in,
p274
aValong with inner city programs
p275
aVto get kids more engaged in these types of recreational activities
p276
aVthat are a little bit nontraditional.
p277
aVWe also, with another initiative that was passed,
p278
aVare building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks
p279
aVthroughout the metro area.
p280
aVWe're even going back into some
p281
aVinner city situations
p282
aVwhere we had built neighborhoods
p283
aVand we had built schools
p284
aVbut we had not connected the two.
p285
aVWe had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods,
p286
aVbut we had never really connected the two
p287
aVwith any sort of walkability.
p288
aVThrough yet another funding source,
p289
aVwe're redesigning all of our inner city streets
p290
aVto be more pedestrian-friendly.
p291
aVOur streets were really wide,
p292
aVand you'd push the button to allow you to walk across,
p293
aVand you had to run in order to get there in time.
p294
aVBut now we've narrowed the streets,
p295
aVhighly landscaped them, making them more pedestrian-friendly,
p296
aVreally a redesign, rethinking the way
p297
aVwe build our infrastructure,
p298
aVdesigning a city around people and not cars.
p299
aVWe're completing our bicycle trail master plan.
p300
aVWe'll have over 100 miles
p301
aVwhen we're through building it out.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd so you see this culture starting to shift
p304
aVin Oklahoma City.
p305
aVAnd lo and behold, the demographic changes
p306
aVthat are coming with it are very inspiring.
p307
aVHighly educated twentysomethings
p308
aVare moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region
p309
aVand, indeed, even from further away, in California.
p310
aa(lp311
VWhen we reached a million pounds,
p312
aVin January of 2012,
p313
aVI flew to New York with some our participants
p314
aVwho had lost over 100 pounds,
p315
aVwhose lives had been changed,
p316
aVand we appeared on the Rachael Ray show,
p317
aVand then that afternoon, I did a round of media in New York
p318
aVpushing the same messages
p319
aVthat you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it.
p320
aVAnd I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine,
p321
aVthe same magazine that had put us on that list
p322
aVfive years before.
p323
aVAnd as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter,
p324
aVI notice there's a magazine copy
p325
aVof the current issue right there on the table,
p326
aVand I pick it up, and I look at the headline
p327
aVacross the top, and it says,
p328
aV"America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?"
p329
aVWell, I knew I did,
p330
aVso I picked up the magazine
p331
aVand I began to look,
p332
aVand we weren't on it.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Applause)
p335
aa(lp336
VThen I looked on the list of fittest cities,
p337
aVand we were on that list.
p338
aVWe were on the list as the 22nd fittest city in the United States.
p339
aVOur state health statistics are doing better.
p340
aVGranted, we have a long way to go.
p341
aVHealth is still not something
p342
aVthat we should be proud of in Oklahoma City,
p343
aVbut we seem to have turned the cultural shift
p344
aVof making health a greater priority.
p345
aVAnd we love the idea of the demographics
p346
aVof highly educated twentysomethings,
p347
aVpeople with choices, choosing Oklahoma City
p348
aVin large numbers.
p349
aVWe have the lowest unemployment in the United States,
p350
aVprobably the strongest economy in the United States.
p351
aVAnd if you're like me, at some point
p352
aVin your educational career,
p353
aVyou were asked to read a book called
p354
aV"The Grapes of Wrath."
p355
aVOklahomans leaving for California
p356
aVin large numbers for a better future.
p357
aVWhen we look at the demographic shifts
p358
aVof people coming from the west,
p359
aVit appears that what we're seeing now
p360
aVis the wrath of grapes.
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aV(Applause)
p363
aVThe grandchildren are coming home.
p364
aa(lp365
VYou've been a great audience and very attentive.
p366
aVThank you very much for having me here.
p367

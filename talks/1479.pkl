VThank you.

p20
aa(lp21
VAs a kid, I grew up on a farm in Florida,
p22
aVand I did what most little kids do.
p23
aVI played a little baseball, did a few other things like that,
p24
aVbut I always had the sense of being an outsider,
p25
aVand it wasn't until I saw pictures in the magazines
p26
aVthat a couple other guys skate, I thought,
p27
aV"Wow, that's for me," you know?
p28
aVBecause there was no coach standing directly over you,
p29
aVand these guys, they were just being themselves.
p30
aVThere was no opponent directly across from you.
p31
aVAnd I loved that sense, so I started skating
p32
aVwhen I was about 10 years old, in 1977,
p33
aVand when I did, I picked it up pretty quickly.
p34
aVIn fact, here's some footage from about 1984.
p35
aVIt wasn't until 79 I won my first amateur championship,
p36
aVand then, by 81, I was 14, and I won my first world championship,
p37
aVwhich was amazing to me,
p38
aVand in a very real sense, that was the first real victory I had.
p39
aa(lp40
VOh, watch this.
p41
aVThis is a Casper slide, where the board's upside down.
p42
aVMental note on that one.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd this one here?
p47
aVAn ollie.
p48
aVSo, as she mentioned, that is overstated for sure,
p49
aVbut that's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating.
p50
aVHere's some images of that.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, I was about halfway through my pro career
p53
aVin, I would say, the mid-'80s.
p54
aVFreestyle itself \u2014 we developed all these flat ground tricks, as you saw,
p55
aVbut there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding,
p56
aVwhere guys were taking it to the streets, and they were using that ollie,
p57
aVlike I showed you.
p58
aVThey were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails
p59
aVand over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff.
p60
aVSo it was evolving upwards.
p61
aVIn fact, when someone tells you they're a skater today,
p62
aVthey pretty much mean a street skater,
p63
aVbecause freestyle, it took about five years for it to die,
p64
aVand at that stage, I'd been a "champion" champion for 11 years, which \u2014
p65
aVPhew!
p66
aVAnd suddenly, it was over for me, that's it \u2014 it was gone.
p67
aVThey took my pro model off the shelf,
p68
aVwhich was essentially pronouncing you dead, publicly.
p69
aVThat's how you make your money, you know?
p70
aVYou have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes.
p71
aVI had all that stuff, and it's gone.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe crazy thing was, there was a really liberating sense about it,
p74
aVbecause I no longer had to protect my record as a champion.
p75
aV"Champion," again.
p76
aVChampion sounds so goofy, but it's what it was, right?
p77
aVWhat drew me to skateboarding, the freedom,
p78
aVwas now restored, where I could just create things,
p79
aVbecause that's where the joy was for me, always,
p80
aVwas creating new stuff.
p81
aVThe other thing that I had was a deep well of tricks to draw from
p82
aVthat were rooted in these flat ground tricks.
p83
aVStuff the normal guys were doing was very much different.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo, as humbling and rotten as it was \u2014
p86
aVAnd believe me, it was rotten.
p87
aVI would go to skate spots, and I was already "famous guy," right?
p88
aVAnd everyone thought I was good,
p89
aVbut in this new terrain, I was horrible.
p90
aVSo people would go, "Oh, what happened to Mullen?"
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VSo, humbling as it was, I began again.
p95
aVHere are some tricks that I started to bring to that new terrain.
p96
aVAnd again, there's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle \u2014
p97
aVOh, that one?
p98
aVThat's, like, the hardest thing I've ever done.
p99
aVOK, look at that, it's a Darkslide.
p100
aVSee how it's sliding on the backside?
p101
aVThose are super fun, and, actually, not that hard.
p102
aVYou know, at the very root of that, see, Caspers,
p103
aVsee how you throw it?
p104
aVSimple as that, right? No biggie.
p105
aVAnd your front foot, the way it grabs it \u2014
p106
aVI'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that,
p107
aVand I was like, "How can I get it over?"
p108
aVBecause that had not yet been done.
p109
aVAnd then it dawned on me, and here's part of what I'm saying.
p110
aVI had an infrastructure. I had this deep layer,
p111
aVwhere it was like, oh my gosh, it's just your foot.
p112
aVIt's just the way you throw your board over.
p113
aVJust let the ledge do that, and it's easy,
p114
aVand the next thing you know, there's 20 more tricks
p115
aVbased out of the variations.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo that's the kind of thing \u2014 here, check this out,
p118
aVhere's another way, and I won't overdo this.
p119
aVA little indulgent, I understand.
p120
aVThere's something called a Primo slide.
p121
aVIt is the funnest trick ever to do.
p122
aVIt's like skimboarding.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd this one, look how it slides sideways, every which way?
p125
aVOK, so when you're skating, and you take a fall,
p126
aVthe board slips that way or that way; it's kind of predictable.
p127
aVThis? It goes every which way \u2014 it's like a cartoon, the falls,
p128
aVand that's what I love the most about it.
p129
aVIt's so much fun to do.
p130
aVIn fact, when I started doing them, I remember, because I got hurt.
p131
aVI had to get a knee surgery, right?
p132
aVSo there were a couple of weeks where I couldn't skate at all.
p133
aVIt would give out on me, and I would watch the guys,
p134
aVI'd go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating,
p135
aVmy friends, and I was like,
p136
aV"I've got to do something new, I want to do something new.
p137
aVI want to start fresh."
p138
aVAnd so the night before my surgery, I'd watched, and I was like,
p139
aV"How am I going to do this?"
p140
aVSo I ran up, and I jumped on my board,
p141
aVand I Cavemanned, and I flipped it down,
p142
aVand I remember thinking, I landed so light-footed, thinking,
p143
aVif my knee gives, they'll just have more work to do in the morning.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd so, when it was the crazy thing.
p148
aVI don't know how many of you guys have had surgery, but \u2014
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
Vyou are so helpless, right?
p153
aVYou're on this gurney and you're watching the ceiling go by,
p154
aVevery time, it's always that,
p155
aVand right when they're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep,
p156
aVall I was thinking is, "Man, when I wake up and I get better,
p157
aVthe first thing I'm going to do is film that trick."
p158
aVAnd indeed I did, it was the very first thing I filmed, which was awesome.
p159
aa(lp160
VI told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks.
p161
aVConsider that content, in a sense.
p162
aVWhat we do as street skaters is, you have these tricks \u2014
p163
aVSay I'm working on Darkslides, or a Primo,
p164
aVthat you guys know this stuff now.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VWhat you do is, you cruise around the same streets
p169
aVthat you've seen a hundred times,
p170
aVbut suddenly, because you already have something
p171
aVin this fixed domain of this target, it's like, what will match this trick?
p172
aVHow can I expand, how can the context,
p173
aVhow can the environment change the very nature of what I do?
p174
aVSo you drive and drive and drive, and, actually I've got to admit,
p175
aVjust because I was struggling with this because I'm here,
p176
aVbut I'll just say it, is, I cannot tell you,
p177
aVnot only to be here in front of you,
p178
aVbut what a privilege it is to be at US campus,
p179
aVbecause I have been escorted off of this campus so many times.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
V(Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VSo let me give you another example of how context shapes content.
p186
aVThis is a place not that far from here, It's a rotten neighborhood.
p187
aVYour first consideration is, am I going to get beat up?
p188
aVYou go out and \u2014 See this wall?
p189
aVIt's fairly mellow, and it's beckoning to do bank tricks, right?
p190
aVBut there's this other aspect of it for wheelies,
p191
aVso check this out.
p192
aVThere's a few tricks, again,
p193
aVhow environment changes the nature of your tricks.
p194
aVFreestyle oriented, manual down \u2014 wheelie down.
p195
aVWatch, this one? Oh, I love this, it's like surfing, this one,
p196
aVthe way you catch it.
p197
aVThis one, a little sketchy going backwards,
p198
aVand watch the back foot.
p199
aVOops \u2014
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VMental note right there.
p204
aVAgain, we'll get back to that.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VHere, back foot, back foot.
p209
aVOK, up there?
p210
aVThat was called a 360 flip.
p211
aVNotice how the board flipped and spun this way, both axes.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd another example of how the context changed,
p214
aVand the creative process for me and for most skaters,
p215
aVis, you go, you get out of the car, you check for security,
p216
aVyou check for stuff.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VIt's funny, you get to know their rhythms, you know,
p221
aVthe guys that cruise around \u2014
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VSkateboarding is such a humbling thing, man.
p226
aVNo matter how good you are, you've still got to deal with \u2014
p227
aVSo you hit this wall, and when I hit it,
p228
aVthe first thing you do is you fall forward,
p229
aVand I'm like, all right, all right.
p230
aVAs you adjust ...
p231
aVyou punch it up, and then when I would do that,
p232
aVit was throwing my shoulder this way ...
p233
aVwhich as I was doing it, I was like, "Oh wow, that's begging for a 360 flip,"
p234
aVbecause that's how you load up for a 360 flip.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd so this is what I want to emphasize that, as you can imagine,
p237
aVall of these tricks are made of submovements,
p238
aVexecutive motor functions,
p239
aVmore granular to the degree to which I can't quite tell you,
p240
aVbut one thing I do know is,
p241
aVevery trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements.
p242
aVAnd so, as I'm going up, these things are floating around,
p243
aVand you have to sort of let the cognitive mind rest back,
p244
aVpull it back a little bit,
p245
aVand let your intuition go as you feel these things.
p246
aVAnd these submovements are kind of floating around,
p247
aVand as the wall hits you, they connect themselves to an extent,
p248
aVand that's when the cognitive mind: "Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that."
p249
aVSo that's how that works to me, the creative process,
p250
aVthe process itself, of street skating.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo, next \u2014 Oh, mind you ...
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VThose are the community.
p257
aVThese are some of the best skaters in the world.
p258
aVThese are my friends \u2014 oh my gosh, they're such good people.
p259
aVAnd the beauty of skateboarding is that,
p260
aVno one guy is the best.
p261
aVIn fact, I know this is rotten to say, they're my friends,
p262
aVbut a couple of them actually don't look that comfortable on their board.
p263
aVWhat makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding
p264
aVto individuate themselves.
p265
aVEvery single one of these guys, you look at them,
p266
aVyou can see a silhouette of them, and you realize,
p267
aV"Oh, that's him, that's Haslam, that's Koston,
p268
aVthere's these guys, these are the guys."
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd skaters, I think they tend to be outsiders
p271
aVwho seek a sense of belonging,
p272
aVbut belonging on their own terms.
p273
aVAnd real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do,
p274
aVthese basic tricks, 360 flips, we take that, we make it our own,
p275
aVand then we contribute back to the community
p276
aVthe inner way that edifies the community itself.
p277
aVThe greater the contribution,
p278
aVthe more we express and form our individuality,
p279
aVwhich is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with.
p280
aVThe summation of that
p281
aVgives us something we could never achieve as an individual.
p282
aVI should say this.
p283
aVThere's some sort of beautiful symmetry
p284
aVthat the degree to which we connect to a community
p285
aVis in proportion to our individuality,
p286
aVwhich we are expressing by what we do.
p287
aa(lp288
VNext,
p289
aVthese guys, very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VNotice a couple of these shots from the police department.
p294
aVBut it is quite similar, I mean, what is it to hack, right?
p295
aVIt's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it
p296
aVand steer it to do things it was never intended to do, right?
p297
aVAnd they're not all bad.
p298
aVYou can be a Linux kernel hacker, make it more stable, right?
p299
aVMore safe, more secure.
p300
aVYou can be an iOS hacker,
p301
aVmake your iPhone do stuff it wasn't supposed to.
p302
aVNot authorized, but not illegal.
p303
aVAnd then, you've got some of these guys, right?
p304
aVWhat they do is very similar to our creative process.
p305
aVThey connect disparate information,
p306
aVand they bring it together in a way that a security analyst doesn't expect.
p307
aVIt doesn't make them good people,
p308
aVbut it's at the heart of engineering,
p309
aVat the heart of a creative community, an innovative community,
p310
aVand the open source community, the basic ethos of it
p311
aVis, take what other people do, make it better,
p312
aVgive it back so we all rise further.
p313
aVVery similar communities, very similar.
p314
aa(lp315
VWe have our edgier sides, too.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Laughter)
p318
aa(lp319
VIt's funny, my dad was right.
p320
aVThese are my peers.
p321
aVBut I respect what they do, and they respect what I do,
p322
aVbecause they can do things, it's amazing what they can do.
p323
aVIn fact, one of them,
p324
aVhe was Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County,
p325
aVso they're not \u2014 you never know who you're dealing with.
p326
aa(lp327
VWe've all had some degree of fame.
p328
aVIn fact, I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of.
p329
aVI've had a patent, and that was cool, and we started a company,
p330
aVand it grew, and it became the biggest,
p331
aVand then it went down, and then it became the biggest again,
p332
aVwhich is harder than the first time, and then we sold it,
p333
aVand then we sold it again.
p334
aVSo I've had some success.
p335
aVAnd in the end, when you've had all of these things,
p336
aVwhat is it that continues to drive you?
p337
aVAs I mentioned, the knee stuff and these things,
p338
aVwhat is it that will punch you?
p339
aVBecause it's not just the mind.
p340
aVWhat is it that will punch you and make you do something
p341
aVand bring it to another level, and when you've had it all,
p342
aVsometimes, guys, they die on the vine with all of that talent,
p343
aVand one of the things we've had, all of us, is fame \u2014
p344
aVI think the best kind of fame, because you can take it off.
p345
aVI've been all around the world,
p346
aVand there will be a thousand kids crying out your name,
p347
aVand it's such a weird, visceral experience.
p348
aVIt's like, it's disorienting.
p349
aVAnd you get in a car, and you drive away,
p350
aVand 10-minute drive, and you get out,
p351
aVand no one gives a rat's who you are.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd it gives you that clarity of perspective of, man, I'm just me,
p356
aVand popularity, what does that really mean again?
p357
aVNot much.
p358
aVIt's peer respect that drives us.
p359
aVThat's the one thing that makes us do what we do.
p360
aVI've had over a dozen bones, this guy, over, eight, 10 concussions,
p361
aVto the point where it's comedy, right?
p362
aVIt is actually comedy, they mess with him.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
VNext,
p367
aVand this is something deeper.
p368
aVI think I was on tour when I was reading one of the Feynman biographies.
p369
aVIt was the red one or the blue one.
p370
aVAnd he made this statement that was so profound to me.
p371
aVIt was that the Nobel Prize was the tombstone on all great work,
p372
aVand it resonated because I had won 35 out of 36 contests
p373
aVthat I'd entered over 11 years, and it made me bananas.
p374
aVIn fact, winning isn't the word, I won it once.
p375
aVThe rest of the time, you're just defending,
p376
aVand you get into this, turtle posture, you know?
p377
aVWhere you're not doing \u2014 it usurped the joy of what I loved to do
p378
aVbecause I was no longer doing it to create and have fun,
p379
aVand when it died out from under me,
p380
aVthat was one of the most liberating things,
p381
aVbecause I could create.
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd look, I understand that I am on the very edge of preachy, here.
p384
aVI'm not here to do that.
p385
aVIt's just that I'm in front of a very privileged audience.
p386
aVIf you guys aren't already leaders in your community,
p387
aVyou probably will be, and if there's anything I can give you
p388
aVthat will transcend what I've gotten from skateboarding,
p389
aVthe only things of meaning, I think, and of permanence,
p390
aVit's not fame, it's not all these things.
p391
aVWhat it is, is that there's an intrinsic value in creating something
p392
aVfor the sake of creating it,
p393
aVand better than that, because I'm 46 years old, or I'll be 46,
p394
aVand how pathetic is that I'm still skateboarding, but there is \u2014
p395
aVthere is this beauty in dropping it into a community of your own making,
p396
aVand seeing it dispersed, and seeing younger, more talented,
p397
aVjust different talent, take it to levels you can never imagine,
p398
aVbecause that lives on.
p399
aVSo thank you for your time.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Applause)
p402
aa(lp403
VKristina Holly: I have a question for you.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Applause)
p406
aa(lp407
VSo you've really reinvented yourself in the past, from freestyle to street,
p408
aVand, I think it was about four years ago you officially retired.
p409
aVIs that it? What's next?
p410
aa(lp411
VRodney Mullen: That's a good question. KG: Something tells me it's not the end.
p412
aa(lp413
VRM: Yeah. Every time you think you've chased something down,
p414
aVit's funny, no matter how good you are, and I know guys like this,
p415
aVit feels like you're polishing a turd, you know?
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
VAnd I thought, the only way I can extend this
p420
aVis to change something infrastructural.
p421
aVAnd so that's what I proceeded to do, through a long story,
p422
aVone of desperation, so if I do it, rather than talk about it,
p423
aVif I do it, you'll be the first to know.
p424
aa(lp425
VKG: All right, we won't ask you any more. RM: You'll get a text.
p426
aa(lp427
VKG: Right, thank you, good job. RM: Thank you. Thank you.

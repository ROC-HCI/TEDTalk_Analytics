VThere's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world
p5
aVand at IDEO this past year,
p6
aVand I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.
p7
aa(lp8
VI didn't attend the first TED back in 1984
p9
aVbut I've been to a lot of them since that time.
p10
aVI thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time
p11
aVwhen Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard;
p12
aVit's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd so thinking back, I was thinking
p15
aVthose of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects \u2014
p16
aVcertainly technological objects.
p17
aVAnd so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you
p18
aVwho are in the audience were my clients.
p19
aVWe'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth
p20
aVand we'd put it on the conference table,
p21
aVand we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would "ooh" and "ah."
p22
aVThat was a really good time.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have.
p25
aVAnd if you were here last year,
p26
aVI probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2,
p27
aVwhich was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.
p28
aVAnd I took a lot of pictures last year;
p29
aVvery few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures.
p30
aVThis year \u2014 maybe you could show the slides \u2014
p31
aVthis year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with
p32
aVand helped Handspring design it.
p33
aVAlso, though we designed it a few years ago \u2014
p34
aVit's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so \u2014
p35
aVthis Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives.
p36
aVMaybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now.
p37
aVLots of lives are being saved by those.
p38
aVAnd, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product
p39
aVthat I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read.
p40
aVSo, we really will continue to focus on products.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED,
p43
aVand that's that people like us \u2014
p44
aVI know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time,
p45
aVbut for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of
p46
aVclimbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit \u2014
p47
aVand so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design,
p48
aVhuman-centeredness in an approach to design.
p49
aVThat really involves designing behaviors and personality into products.
p50
aVAnd I think you're starting to see that,
p51
aVand it's making our job even more enjoyable.
p52
aa(lp53
VInterestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models \u2014
p54
aVyou know, you've seen some today \u2014 and 3-D renderings.
p55
aVThen we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.
p56
aVBut firms like ours are having to move to a point where
p57
aVwe get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion,
p58
aVshowing how they'll be used.
p59
aVAnd so in order to do that we've been forming
p60
aVinternal video-production groups
p61
aVin order to make these kind of experience prototypes
p62
aVthat show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship.
p63
aVAnd it's a much better way to see.
p64
aVIt's kind of like architects who show people in their houses,
p65
aVas opposed to them being empty.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I thought that I would show you a few videos
p68
aVto show off this new, broader definition
p69
aVof design in products and services and environments.
p70
aVI have a few of them \u2014 they're no more than a minute
p71
aVor a minute-and-a-half apiece \u2014
p72
aVbut I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our
p73
aVwork over the last year, and how it responds in video.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas
p76
aVand OMA to help us conceive the technology
p77
aVthat's in their retail store in New York.
p78
aVHe wanted a new kind of store \u2014 a new one \u2014
p79
aVa store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.
p80
aVAnd that meant actually designing custom technology
p81
aVas opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags:
p84
aVthere's RF tags on the user, on the cards,
p85
aVthere's the staff devices that are all around the store.
p86
aVYou pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in,
p87
aVthe staff person can scan them in
p88
aVand then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.
p89
aVYou can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.
p90
aVAnd so then the object \u2014 the merchandise that you're interested in \u2014
p91
aVcan be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room,
p92
aVand in the dressing room there are scanners
p93
aVso that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.
p94
aVWe can put that up on a touch screen
p95
aVand you can play with that, and get more information
p96
aVabout the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on.
p97
aVIt's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here
p98
aVof liquid crystal displays in the changing room.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe last time I went to see this store,
p101
aVthere was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering,
p102
aV"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?"
p103
aVBut if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark.
p104
aVSo you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing.
p105
aVAnd then one of my favorite features of the technology
p106
aVis the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.
p107
aVThere's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around \u2014
p108
aVbut there's a three second delay.
p109
aVSo you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look.
p110
aV(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VAbout a year and a half ago we were asked to design
p113
aVan installation in the museum \u2014
p114
aVthis is a new wing of the Science Museum in London,
p115
aVand it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues.
p116
aVAnd a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO,
p117
aVdesigned this interactive wall that's about four stories tall.
p118
aVI don't know if anybody's seen this \u2014
p119
aVit's pretty spectacular in the room.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnyway, it's based on the London subway system.
p122
aVAnd so you can see that
p123
aVthe goal is to bring some of the feedback
p124
aVthat the people who had gone to the museum were giving,
p125
aVand get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see.
p126
aVSo you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system,
p127
aVthe little trains go around with what you're thinking about.
p128
aVAnd then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.
p129
aa(lp130
VThen when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor \u2014
p131
aVmostly teenagers coming out of there \u2014
p132
aVthere's this big open space that has these tables in it
p133
aVthat have interactive games which are quite fun,
p134
aValso designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch.
p135
aVAnd the topics include things that the museum is about:
p136
aVmale fertility, choosing the sex of your baby
p137
aVor what a driverless car might be like.
p138
aVThere's lots of room, so people can come up
p139
aVand understand what it is before they get involved.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful.
p142
aVThey go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top,
p143
aVafter they've bounced around, they disperse into bits
p144
aVand go off into the atmosphere.
p145
aa(lp146
VThe next video is not done by us.
p147
aVThis is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago.
p148
aVScott Adams ran into us
p149
aVand asked us if we wouldn't help to design
p150
aVthe ultimate cubicle for Dilbert,
p151
aVwhich sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up.
p152
aVHe's always been interested in technology in the future.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be
p155
aVthe world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles.
p156
aVSo we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together
p157
aVwith some of the smartest design guys in the world
p158
aVand try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better?
p159
aa(lp160
VNarrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space
p161
aVspectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge,
p162
aVthe team built their own little cubicles
p163
aVto fully experience the problems.
p164
aa(lp165
VWoman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself.
p166
aa(lp167
VNarrator: They took pictures.
p168
aa(lp169
VWoman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over
p170
aVand you're sort of held captive there for a minute.
p171
aa(lp172
VSA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good.
p173
aVWe'll see what happens.
p174
aa(lp175
VNarrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens
p176
aVfor the computer and for family photos.
p177
aVIn the second group's scenario, the walls are alive
p178
aVand actually give Dilbert a group hug.
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aVBehind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)
p181
aa(lp182
VDavid Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting
p183
aVthat follows the sun across \u2014 that follows the tracks of the sun \u2014 across the sky.
p184
aVSo you feel that in your cubicle.
p185
aVAnd my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase
p186
aVthat wilts when you leave in disappointment,
p187
aVand then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.
p188
aa(lp189
V(SA: The storage is built right into the wall.)
p190
aa(lp191
VDK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls,
p192
aVor something to be aggressive with to release tension.
p193
aa(lp194
V(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.)
p195
aa(lp196
VDK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap
p197
aVthat stretches across your cubicle.
p198
aa(lp199
V(SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.)
p200
aa(lp201
VDK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate
p202
aVthe recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.
p203
aVThe dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it,
p204
aVas well as wastewater.
p205
aVSo this building actually celebrates the water
p206
aVas it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed
p207
aVso that it can be filtered for the final time.
p208
aa(lp209
VThe pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful.
p210
aVIn contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's
p211
aVkind of wild and crazy and everybody's
p212
aVlearning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing.
p213
aVBut it was intended to be quite quiet.
p214
aVAnd then you would wander around and gather information,
p215
aVin a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process
p216
aVand what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water
p217
aVonce it comes through the plant.
p218
aVAnd then, if you saw,
p219
aVthe panels actually rotate. So you can get the information
p220
aVon the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual
p221
aVrecycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.
p222
aVYou can see: there's the plant.
p223
aVThese are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd we're announcing a new product here tonight,
p226
aVwhich is the first time this has ever been shown in public.
p227
aVIt's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye,
p228
aVstarted by Nigel Jagger in London.
p229
aVAnd it's a company that's trying to bring the experience \u2014 many people have boats,
p230
aVor enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people
p231
aVactually have the capability or the interest in going under the water
p232
aVand actually seeing what's there,
p233
aVand enjoying what scuba divers do.
p234
aVThis product, it has two cameras.
p235
aVYou throw it over the side of your boat
p236
aVand you basically scuba dive without getting wet.
p237
aa(lp238
VFor us \u2014 there's the object \u2014 for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface
p239
aVso that the interface doesn't get in your way.
p240
aVYou could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater \u2014
p241
aVof feeling like you're underwater \u2014 seeing what's going on.
p242
aVAnd the other one was to design the object
p243
aVand make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.
p244
aVAnd so we spent a lot of time \u2014 this has been going on for about
p245
aVseven or eight years, this project \u2014
p246
aVand [we're] just ready to start building them.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.
p249
aVIt can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate,
p250
aVand is equipped with powerful lights.
p251
aVIt becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.
p252
aVThe battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.)
p253
aa(lp254
VDK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement
p255
aVand it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together.
p258
aVManeuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control.
p259
aVYou watch the video with superimposed graphics
p260
aVthat indicate your depth and compass heading.
p261
aVThe fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine
p262
aVto help you completely lose yourself underwater.)
p263
aV(Applause)
p264
aa(lp265
VDK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC,
p266
aVwhich is a project that I'm very excited about.
p267
aVApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher,
p268
aVwho's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.
p269
aVHe found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright
p270
aVand he had a very interesting insight, which is that
p271
aVhe said, "There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya;
p272
aVthere must be entrepreneurs everywhere."
p273
aVAnd he noticed that for weddings and funerals there
p274
aVthey could find enough money to put something together.
p275
aVSo he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya
p276
aVwith Kenyan manufacturers \u2014 designed by people like us, but taken there.
p277
aVAnd to this date \u2014 he's been gone for only a few years \u2014
p278
aVhe's started 19,000 companies.
p279
aVHe's made 30,000 new jobs.
p280
aVAnd just the sales of the products \u2014 this is a non-profit \u2014
p281
aVthe sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya.
p282
aVThis is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo we're in the process of helping them design
p285
aVdeep-well, low-cost manual pumps
p286
aVin order for these people who have a quarter acre of land
p287
aVto be able to grow crops in the off-season.
p288
aVWhat they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season
p289
aVbut they can't grow them in the off-season.
p290
aVAnd so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing \u2014
p291
aVshe's a school teacher \u2014 always wanted to send her kids to college
p292
aVand she's going to be able to do it because of these things.
p293
aVSo with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and
p294
aVvery straightforward things that we're designing \u2014
p295
aVmy students are doing this as class projects
p296
aVand IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work \u2014
p297
aVit's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.
p298
aa(lp299
VWe also were thinking about the experience of Richard,
p300
aVand so \u2014
p301
aV(Laughter)
p302
aV\u2014 we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day
p303
aVand I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say.
p304
aV(Laughter)
p305
aVCan you read it?
p306
aV(Laughter)
p307
aVWell, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers.
p308
aVYou know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty,
p309
aVand so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here.
p310
aV(Laughter)
p311
aV(Applause)
p312
aa(lp313
VSo we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session,
p314
aVand from all the different presenters.
p315
aVAnd in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC,
p316
aVit's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design,
p317
aVthat we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do,
p318
aVand I think this is great.
p319
aVDesigners are more trusted and more integrated
p320
aVinto the business strategy of companies,
p321
aVand I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design
p322
aVhas made since the first TED. Thanks a lot.

But what matters even more to him is  unlocking the creative potential of people and organizations so they can  innovate routinely.</p><p>David Kelley&#39;s most enduring contributions to  the field of design are a methodology and culture of innovation. More  recently, he led the creation of the groundbreaking d.school at  Stanford, the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, where students from  the business, engineering, medicine, law, and other diverse disciplines  develop the capacity to solve complex problems collaboratively and  creatively.</p><p>Kelley was working (unhappily) as an electrical  engineer when he heard about Stanford&#39;s cross-disciplinary Joint Program  in Design, which merged engineering and art. What he learned there -- a  human-centered, team-based approach to tackling sticky problems through  design -- propelled his professional life as a &quot;design thinker.&quot;</p><p>In  1978, he co-founded the design firm that ultimately became IDEO, now  emulated worldwide for its innovative, user-centered approach to design.

But what matters even more to him is  unlocking the creative potential of people and organizations so they can  innovate routinely.</p><p>David Kelley&#39;s most enduring contributions to  the field of design are a methodology and culture of innovation.

What he learned there -- a  human-centered, team-based approach to tackling sticky problems through  design -- propelled his professional life as a &quot;design thinker.&quot;</p><p>In  1978, he co-founded the design firm that ultimately became IDEO, now  emulated worldwide for its innovative, user-centered approach to design.  IDEO works with a range of clients -- from food and beverage  conglomerates to high tech startups, hospitals to universities, and  today even governments -- conceiving breakthrough innovations ranging  from a life-saving portable defibrillator to a new kind of residence for  wounded warriors, and helping organizations build their own innovation  culture.</p><p>Today, David serves as chair of IDEO and is the Donald  W.

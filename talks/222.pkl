p5
aa(lp6
V\u266b I first saw you and I got so shy. \u266b
p7
aa(lp8
V\u266b You see, I was a little paranoid 'cause I might have been high. \u266b
p9
aa(lp10
V\u266b And I hadn't done that in ages and I won't do that again. \u266b
p11
aa(lp12
V\u266b But that's another story. \u266b
p13
aa(lp14
V\u266b Loved you forever and I've been a big fan, \u266b
p15
aa(lp16
V\u266b the one-woman shows, I even rented "Pat." \u266b
p17
aa(lp18
V\u266b I got enough nerve to come up to you, \u266b
p19
aa(lp20
V\u266b but little did I know one year later we'd be doing this show. \u266b
p21
aa(lp22
V\u266b I sing. Julia Sweeney: I tell stories. Together: The Jill and Julia Show. \u266b
p23
aa(lp24

V\u266b I first saw you and I wasn't so shy. \u266b
p31
aa(lp32
VI made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan I was
p33
aVever since I was writing that pilot for Fox, and Wendy
p34
aVand I wanted you to do the theme song.
p35
aVAnd then the pilot didn't go and I was so sad,
p36
aVbut I kept remaining a fan of yours.
p37
aVAnd then when I went through that big, horrible breakup with Carl
p38
aVand I couldn't get off the couch, I listened to your song,
p39
aV\u266b "Now That I Don't Have You," \u266b over and over and over and over again.
p40
aVAnd I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED.
p41
aVAnd also, I can't believe that we're eating sushi
p42
aVin front of the fish tank,
p43
aVwhich, personally, I think is really inappropriate.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aV(Applause)
p46
aa(lp47

p54
aa(lp55
V\u266b Sobule: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? \u266b
p56

p62
aa(lp63
V\u266b William Faulkner, drunk and depressed. \u266b Sweeney: Mmm.
p64
aa(lp65
V\u266b Dorothy Parker, mean, drunk and depressed. \u266b Sweeney: I know.
p66
aa(lp67
V\u266b And that guy, "Seven Years in Tibet," turned out to be a Nazi. \u266b Sweeney: Yeah.
p68
aa(lp69
V\u266b Founding fathers all had slaves. \u266b Sweeney: I know.
p70
aa(lp71
V\u266b The explorers slaughtered the braves. \u266b Sweeney: Horribly.
p72
aa(lp73
V\u266b Sobule: The Old Testament God can be so petty. \u266b
p74
aa(lp75
VSweeney: Don't get me started on that. (Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
V\u266b Sobule: Paul McCartney, jealous of John, even more so now that he's gone. \u266b
p78
aa(lp79
V\u266b Dylan was so mean to Donovan in that movie. \u266b
p80
aa(lp81
V\u266b Pablo Picasso, cruel to his wives. \u266b Sweeney: Horrible.
p82
aa(lp83
V\u266b Sobule: My favorite poets took their own lives. \u266b
p84
aa(lp85
V\u266b Orson Welles peaked at twenty-five, below before our eyes. \u266b
p86
aa(lp87
V\u266b And he sold bad wine. \u266b
p88
aa(lp89
V\u266b Together: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? Yeah \u266b
p90
aa(lp91
V\u266b Why do they always bring me down? \u266b
p92
aa(lp93
V\u266b Sobule: Heard Babe Ruth was full of malice. \u266b Sweeney: Oh.
p94
aa(lp95
V\u266b Lewis Carroll I'm sure did Alice. \u266b Sweeney: What?!
p96
aa(lp97
V\u266b Plato in the cave with those very young boys. \u266b Sweeney: Ooh...
p98
aa(lp99
V\u266b Sobule: Hillary supported the war. \u266b
p100
aa(lp101
V\u266b Sweeney: Even Thomas Friedman supported the war. \u266b (Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
V\u266b Sobule: Colin Powell turned out to be ... Together: ... such a pussy. \u266b (Laughter) (Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
V\u266b Sobule: William Faulkner, drunk and depressed, \u266b
p106
aa(lp107
V\u266b Tennessee Williams, drunk and depressed. \u266b Sweeney: Yeah.
p108
aa(lp109
V\u266b Sobule: Take it, Julia. \u266b
p110
aa(lp111
VSweeney: Okay. Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine.
p112
aVI mean, I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane
p113
aVvisiting my mother. And to my mother,
p114
aVOprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope,
p115
aVwhich is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic.
p116
aVAnyway, I like Oprah \u2014 I like her girlfriendy-ness,
p117
aVI like her weight issues,
p118
aVI like how she's transformed talk television,
p119
aVI like how she's brought reading back to America \u2014
p120
aVbut there was something that happened the last two weeks
p121
aVthat was ... I call it the Soon-Yi moment:
p122
aVit is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone.
p123
aVAnd that was that she did two entire shows
p124
aVpromoting that movie "The Secret."
p125
aVDo you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?
p126
aVIt makes "What the Bleep Do We Know" seem like a doctoral dissertation
p127
aVfrom Harvard on quantum mechanics \u2014 that's how bad it is.
p128
aVIt makes "The DaVinci Code" seem like "War and Peace."
p129
aVThat movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience.
p130
aVAnd the basic idea is
p131
aVthat there's this law of attraction, and
p132
aVyour thoughts have this vibrating energy
p133
aVthat goes out into the universe
p134
aVand then you attract good things to happen to you.
p135
aVOn a scientific basis, it's more than just "Power of Positive Thinking" \u2014
p136
aVit has a horrible, horrible dark side. Like if you get ill,
p137
aVit's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts.
p138
aVYeah, stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it.
p139
aVAnd all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann
p140
aVwould go on Oprah
p141
aVand just explain to her that the law of attraction is, in fact, not a law.
p142
aVSo that's what I have to say.
p143

Her endearing story-songs veer from fanciful storytelling to forceful satire and back again, covering a wide range of political and social issues from climate change to prostitution; anorexia to anti-semitism. Her winning combination of <strong>memorable characters, clever lyrics and catchy tunes</strong> has inspired comparisons that range from Burt Bacharach to Gertrude Stein.

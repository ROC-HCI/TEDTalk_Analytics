VSo, can we dare to be optimistic?
p5
aVWell, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion"
p6
aVis that a billion people have been stuck living
p7
aVin economies that have been stagnant for 40 years,
p8
aVand hence diverging from the rest of mankind.
p9
aVAnd so, the real question to pose is not, "Can we be optimistic?"
p10
aVIt's, "How can we give credible hope to that billion people?"
p11
aVThat, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development.
p12
aa(lp13
VWhat I'm going to offer you is a recipe,
p14
aVa combination of the two forces that changed the world for good,
p15
aVwhich is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.
p16
aVCompassion, because a billion people are living in societies
p17
aVthat have not offered credible hope.
p18
aVThat is a human tragedy.
p19
aVEnlightened self-interest, because if that economic divergence
p20
aVcontinues for another 40 years,
p21
aVcombined with social integration globally,
p22
aVit will build a nightmare for our children.
p23
aVWe need compassion to get ourselves started,
p24
aVand enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious.
p25
aVThat's the alliance that changes the world.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo, what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion?
p28
aVWhat can we actually do?
p29
aVWell, a good guide is to think,
p30
aV"What did we do last time the rich world got serious
p31
aVabout developing another region of the world?"
p32
aVThat gives us, it turns out, quite a good clue,
p33
aVexcept you have to go back quite a long time.
p34
aVThe last time the rich world got serious
p35
aVabout developing another region was in the late 1940s.
p36
aVThe rich world was you, America,
p37
aVand the region that needed to be developed was my world, Europe.
p38
aVThat was post-War Europe.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhy did America get serious?
p41
aVIt wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that.
p42
aVIt was that you knew you had to,
p43
aVbecause, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europe
p44
aVwas falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice.
p45
aVEurope had to be dragged into economic development.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo, what did you do, last time you got serious?
p48
aVWell, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much.
p49
aVThat was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution.
p50
aVBut what else did you do?
p51
aVWell, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it.
p52
aVBefore the war, America had been highly protectionist.
p53
aVAfter the war, you opened your markets to Europe,
p54
aVyou dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy,
p55
aVand you institutionalized that trade liberalization
p56
aVthrough founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
p57
aVSo, total reversal of trade policy.
p58
aa(lp59
VDid you do anything else?
p60
aVYes, you totally reversed your security policy.
p61
aVBefore the war, your security policy had been isolationist.
p62
aVAfter the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe
p63
aVfor over 40 years.
p64
aVSo, total reversal of security policy. Anything else?
p65
aVYes, you tear up the "Eleventh Commandment" \u2014
p66
aVnational sovereignty.
p67
aVBefore the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct
p68
aVthat you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations.
p69
aVAfter the war, you found the United Nations,
p70
aVyou found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
p71
aVyou found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community \u2014
p72
aVall systems for mutual government support.
p73
aVThat is still the waterfront of effective policies:
p74
aVaid, trade, security, governments.
p75
aVOf course, the details of policy are going to be different,
p76
aVbecause the challenge is different.
p77
aVIt's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence
p78
aVfor the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up.
p79
aVIs that easier or harder?
p80
aVWe need to be at least as serious as we were then.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, today I'm going to take just one of those four.
p83
aVI'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest,
p84
aVthe one that's just motherhood and apple pie \u2014
p85
aVgovernments, mutual systems of support for governments \u2014
p86
aVand I'm going to show you one idea
p87
aVin how we could do something to strengthen governance,
p88
aVand I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now.
p89
aVThe opportunity we're going to look to
p90
aVis a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion,
p91
aVand that is the commodity booms.
p92
aVThe commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money
p93
aVinto many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.
p94
aVPartly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high,
p95
aVbut it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries.
p96
aVUganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth;
p97
aVGhana has discovered oil;
p98
aVGuinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground.
p99
aVSo, a mass of new discoveries.
p100
aVBetween them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid.
p101
aVJust to give you one example:
p102
aVAngola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue.
p103
aVThe entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion.
p104
aVSo, the flow of resources from the commodity booms
p105
aVto the bottom billion are without precedent.
p106
aVSo there's the optimism.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe question is, how is it going to help their development?
p109
aVIt's a huge opportunity for transformational development.
p110
aVWill it be taken?
p111
aVSo, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done
p112
aVsince "The Bottom Billion," so it's new.
p113
aVI've looked to see what is the relationship between
p114
aVhigher commodity prices of exports,
p115
aVand the growth of commodity-exporting countries.
p116
aVAnd I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world
p117
aVfor the last 40 years,
p118
aVand looked to see what the relationship is.
p119
aVAnd the short run \u2014 say, the first five to seven years \u2014 is just great.
p120
aVIn fact, it's hunky dory: everything goes up.
p121
aVYou get more money because your terms of trade have improved,
p122
aVbut also that drives up output across the board.
p123
aVSo GDP goes up a lot \u2014 fantastic! That's the short run.
p124
aVAnd how about the long run?
p125
aVCome back 15 years later.
p126
aVWell, the short run, it's hunky dory,
p127
aVbut the long run, it's humpty dumpty.
p128
aVYou go up in the short run, but then most societies
p129
aVhistorically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all.
p130
aVThat is not a forecast about how commodity prices go;
p131
aVit's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences,
p132
aVfor growth of an increase in prices.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo, what goes wrong? Why is there this "resource curse," as it's called?
p135
aVAnd again, I've looked at that, and it turns out
p136
aVthat the critical issue is the level of governance,
p137
aVthe initial level of economic governance,
p138
aVwhen the resource booms accrue.
p139
aVIn fact, if you've got good enough governance,
p140
aVthere is no resource boom.
p141
aVYou go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.
p142
aVThat's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada.
p143
aVThe resource curse is entirely confined to countries
p144
aVbelow a threshold of governance.
p145
aVThey still go up in the short run.
p146
aVThat's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.
p147
aVThe best growth rates they've had \u2014 ever.
p148
aVAnd the question is whether the short run will persist.
p149
aVAnd with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't.
p150
aVIt's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term,
p153
aVand below which you go down.
p154
aVJust to benchmark that threshold,
p155
aVit's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s.
p156
aVSo, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold?
p157
aVNow, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s,
p158
aVand that is the spread of democracy.
p159
aVSo I thought, well, maybe that is the thing
p160
aVwhich has transformed governance in the bottom billion.
p161
aVMaybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.
p162
aVSo, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects \u2014
p163
aVand unfortunately, they're adverse.
p164
aVDemocracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.
p165
aa(lp166
VAt that stage I just wanted to abandon the research, but \u2014
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aV\u2014 it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that.
p169
aVBecause there are two distinct aspects of democracy:
p170
aVthere's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power,
p171
aVand there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.
p172
aVIt turns out that electoral competition is the thing
p173
aVthat's doing the damage with democracy,
p174
aVwhereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good.
p175
aVAnd so, what the countries of the bottom billion need
p176
aVis very strong checks and balances.
p177
aVThey haven't got them.
p178
aVThey got instant democracy in the 1990s:
p179
aVelections without checks and balances.
p180
aa(lp181
VHow can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances?
p182
aVIn all the societies of the bottom billion,
p183
aVthere are intense struggles to do just that.
p184
aVThe simple proposal is that we should have some international standards,
p185
aVwhich will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision points
p186
aVthat need to be taken in order
p187
aVto harness these resource revenues.
p188
aVWe know these international standards work
p189
aVbecause we've already got one.
p190
aVIt's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
p191
aVThat is the very simple idea that governments should report
p192
aVto their citizens what revenues they have.
p193
aVNo sooner was it proposed
p194
aVthan reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.
p195
aVNigerian newspapers circulations spiked.
p196
aVPeople wanted to know what their government was getting
p197
aVin terms of revenue.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards?
p200
aVI can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example.
p201
aVThe first is how to take the resources out of the ground \u2014
p202
aVthe economic processes, taking the resources out of the ground
p203
aVand putting assets on top of the ground.
p204
aVAnd the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.
p205
aVYou know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment,
p206
aVhow they've been sold over the last 40 years?
p207
aVA company flies in, does a deal with a minister.
p208
aVAnd that's great for the company,
p209
aVand it's quite often great for the minister \u2014
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aV\u2014 and it's not great for their country.
p212
aVThere's a very simple institutional technology
p213
aVwhich can transform that,
p214
aVand it's called verified auctions.
p215
aVThe public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth
p216
aVis of course the treasury \u2014 that is, the British Treasury.
p217
aVAnd the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights
p218
aVto third-generation mobile phones
p219
aVby working out what those rights were worth.
p220
aVThey worked out they were worth two billion pounds.
p221
aVJust in time, a set of economists got there and said,
p222
aV"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value."
p223
aVIt went for 20 billion pounds through auction.
p224
aVIf the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,
p225
aVthink what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVWhen I put that to the President of Sierra Leone,
p228
aVthe next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team
p229
aVto give expertise on how to conduct auctions.
p230
aa(lp231
VThere are five such decision points;
p232
aVeach one needs an international standard.
p233
aVIf we could do it, we would change the world.
p234
aVWe would be helping the reformers in these societies,
p235
aVwho are struggling for change.
p236
aVThat's our modest role. We cannot change these societies,
p237
aVbut we can help the people in these societies
p238
aVwho are struggling and usually failing,
p239
aVbecause the odds are so stacked against them.
p240
aVAnd yet, we've not got these rules.
p241
aVIf you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules
p242
aVis zilch \u2014 nothing.
p243
aVWhy on Earth are they not there?
p244
aVI realized that the reason they're not there
p245
aVis that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies,
p246
aVpoliticians will get away with gestures.
p247
aVThat unless we have an informed society,
p248
aVwhat politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures:
p249
aVthings that look good, but don't work.
p250
aVAnd so I realized we had to go through the business
p251
aVof building an informed citizenry.
p252
aa(lp253
VThat's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist,
p254
aVand I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.
p255
aV(Laughter).
p256
aVHowever, I have to say, the process of communication
p257
aVdoes not come naturally to me.
p258
aVThis is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming.
p259
aVI grew up in a culture of self-effacement.
p260
aVMy wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks,
p261
aVand the blog comment said, "Collier is not charismatic \u2014
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aV\u2014 but his arguments are compelling."
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aV(Applause)
p266
aVIf you agree with that sentiment,
p267
aVand if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry,
p268
aVyou will realize that I need you.
p269
aVPlease, become ambassadors.
p270
aVThank you.
p271

VOK, so, confession:
p5
aVI've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising.
p6
aVI remember watching Saturday morning cartoons,
p7
aVpaying more attention to the commercials
p8
aVthan to the shows,
p9
aVtrying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head.
p10
aVUltimately, that led me to my dream job.
p11
aVI became a partner at a big New York ad agency.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997,
p14
aVwhen my little brother Matt was shot in the head
p15
aVin a shooting that happened on the observation deck
p16
aVof the Empire State Building.
p17
aVSuddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare,
p18
aVbeing told that my brother was going to die,
p19
aVactually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him,
p20
aVthen several emergency brain surgeries
p21
aVand now what's amounted, for Matt,
p22
aVto a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury.
p23
aVHe is definitely my hero.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut as much as (Applause) \u2014 yeah, deserves it \u2014
p26
aa(lp27
V(Applause)
p28
aa(lp29
VBut as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family,
p30
aVI often think about how much worse it could have been;
p31
aVin fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day
p32
aVwho aren't as fortunate,
p33
aVwho lose loved ones \u2014 brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents.
p34
aVThey don't all make national headlines.
p35
aVIn fact, most of them don't.
p36
aVThey go largely unnoticed,
p37
aVin a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic
p38
aVas some kind of new normal.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I quit my job in advertising
p41
aVto try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic,
p42
aVbecause I came to realize
p43
aVthat the challenges to preventing gun violence
p44
aVare actually the same ones that made me love advertising,
p45
aVwhich is to try to figure out how to engage people.
p46
aVOnly instead of doing it to sell products,
p47
aVdoing it to save lives.
p48
aVAnd that comes down to finding common ground,
p49
aVwhere what I want overlaps with what you want.
p50
aVAnd you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence,
p51
aVjust how much common ground there is.
p52
aa(lp53
VLet's look, for example, at people who love to hunt,
p54
aVa sport enjoyed by millions across the US.
p55
aVIt's a proud tradition. Families.
p56
aVIn some places,
p57
aVthe first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday.
p58
aVWhat do hunters want?
p59
aVWell, they want to hunt. They love their guns.
p60
aVThey believe deeply
p61
aVin the Second Amendment right to own those guns.
p62
aVBut that doesn't mean there isn't common ground.
p63
aa(lp64
VIn fact, there's a lot of it,
p65
aVstarting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.
p66
aVThis isn't about taking certain guns away from all people.
p67
aVIt's about keeping all guns away from certain people,
p68
aVand it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns:
p69
aVconvicted violent criminals, domestic abusers,
p70
aVthe dangerously mentally ill.
p71
aVWe can all appreciate
p72
aVhow Brady background checks have been incredibly effective
p73
aVin keeping guns out of those dangerous hands.
p74
aVIn 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers
p75
aVhave blocked 2.4 million gun sales
p76
aVto those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Applause)
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate
p81
aVthat there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day
p82
aVat guns shows or online
p83
aVwithout those Brady background checks,
p84
aVjust like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane \u2014
p85
aVone with security and one with no security.
p86
aVAnd \u2014
p87
aa(lp88
V(Applause)
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public:
p91
aV90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks
p92
aVto all gun sales \u2014 including 90 percent of Republicans,
p93
aVmore than 80 percent of gun owners,
p94
aVmore than 70 percent of NRA members.
p95
aVThis is not a controversial idea.
p96
aVIn fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees.
p97
aVThat's about the percentage of the American public
p98
aVthat believes the moon landing was a fake.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd it's also about the percentage that believes the government
p103
aVis putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals.
p104
aVThat's the extent to which we agree about background checks.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut what about the 300 million guns
p107
aValready out there in homes across America?
p108
aVWell first, it's important to realize
p109
aVthat those guns are mostly in the hands and homes
p110
aVof decent, law-abiding people like you and me,
p111
aVwho want what we all want \u2014 including keeping our families safe.
p112
aVIn fact, that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns.
p113
aVTen years ago, 42 percent of the American public
p114
aVbelieved \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that a gun makes your home safer.
p115
aVToday, that number is 63 percent.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhy?
p118
aVI kind of hate to say it,
p119
aVbecause it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising,
p120
aVwhich is if you tell a big enough lie enough times,
p121
aVeventually that lie becomes the truth.
p122
aVAnd that's exactly what's happened here.
p123
aVThe corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars
p124
aVblocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic
p125
aVof gun violence;
p126
aVblocking pediatricians from talking to parents
p127
aVabout the dangers of guns in the home;
p128
aVblocking smart-gun technology and other technology
p129
aVthat would prevent kids from firing parents' guns
p130
aVand would save lives.
p131
aVThey're desperate to hide the truth,
p132
aVbecause they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd every day,
p135
aVpeople are dying as a result.
p136
aVAnd a lot of those people are children.
p137
aVEvery day in the US,
p138
aVnine kids are just shot unintentionally.
p139
aV900 children and teens take their own lives every year.
p140
aVAnd here's the thing: they're almost all with a parent's gun.
p141
aVEven two-thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the home,
p142
aVincluding the terrible tragedy
p143
aVat Sandy Hook.
p144
aVI meet so many of these parents;
p145
aVit's the most heartbreaking part of my job.
p146
aVThese are not bad people.
p147
aVThey're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision,
p148
aVmade based on very bad information
p149
aVthat was put into their minds by very bad people,
p150
aVwho know good and well the misery that they're causing,
p151
aVbut just don't care.
p152
aVAnd the result is a nightmare \u2014
p153
aVnot only for families like mine,
p154
aVbut for, really, at the end of the day, all of us.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut I'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence.
p157
aVI'm here to talk about our dream, and it's a dream we all share,
p158
aVwhich is the dream of a better, safer, future.
p159
aVFor my organization, for the Brady Campaign,
p160
aVthat dream is reflected in the bold goal
p161
aVto cut the number of gun deaths in the US in half by 2025.
p162
aVAnd I hope to leave all of you here tonight
p163
aVwith a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach.
p164
aVBecause folks,
p165
aVfor every great movement around the world,
p166
aVthere's a moment where you can look back and say,
p167
aV"That's when things really started to change."
p168
aVAnd I'm here to say
p169
aVthat for the movement to end gun violence in America,
p170
aVthat moment is here.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Applause)
p173
aa(lp174
VWe are so clearly at a tipping point,
p175
aVbecause the American public has come together by the millions
p176
aVlike never before, based on that common ground,
p177
aVto say, "Enough."
p178
aVEnough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters
p179
aVand churches and schools.
p180
aVEnough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets
p181
aVthat's claimed the lives of women and young black men
p182
aVin staggering proportions.
p183
aVEnough of easy access to guns
p184
aVby the people that we all agree shouldn't have them.
p185
aVAnd enough of a small group of craven politicians
p186
aVputting the interests of the corporate gun lobby
p187
aVahead of the people they have been elected to represent.
p188
aVEnough.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd the really exciting thing is, it's not just the usual suspects like me
p193
aVthat are saying it anymore.
p194
aVIt's so much bigger than that.
p195
aVAnd if you want proof,
p196
aVlet's start where most conversations in the US seem to start \u2014
p197
aVwith Kim Kardashian.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd here's the thing: it's not really a joke.
p202
aVI mean, think about when issues change.
p203
aVIt's when they go from being political and advocacy issues
p204
aVto being part of pop culture,
p205
aVvoices coming from everywhere, celebrities using their platforms,
p206
aVmusicians, athletes.
p207
aVThe NBA has come forward.
p208
aVConservative pundits that you never would have imagined
p209
aVhave come forward.
p210
aVThere's real cultural change \u2014
p211
aVI even hear there's a TED Talk about it this year.
p212
aVThat's the extent to which this cultural change is happening.
p213
aVAnd yes, Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal
p214
aVto her 35 million Twitter followers
p215
aVfor expanded background checks.
p216
aa(lp217
VLet's look at the political elections that are heating up.
p218
aVThis used to be the classic third-rail issue for Democrats.
p219
aVCouldn't run from it fast enough.
p220
aVNow candidates are running on it.
p221
aVSome are being forced to reverse very bad positions
p222
aVthey defended very comfortably, until very recently.
p223
aVFor somebody like me,
p224
aVwatching people wave around their negative NRA ratings \u2014
p225
aVit's almost surreal to watch.
p226
aVWe're still outfunded, yes, by the corporate gun lobby,
p227
aVand ultimately that needs to change.
p228
aVBut you know what?
p229
aVWe're smarter and we're scrappier, and we have the truth on our side.
p230
aVAnd we're on offense.
p231
aa(lp232
VYou know, they say that the Internet democratizes information.
p233
aVSocial media and some of the organizing tools that plug into it
p234
aVhave democratized activism.
p235
aVIt's allowed us to show what 90 percent support really looks like.
p236
aVSometimes I think of it \u2014
p237
aVyou know, we're converging and attacking instantly by the millions,
p238
aVkind of like white blood cells.
p239
aVIt's enabled us to start to really close \u2014 and this is the bottom line \u2014
p240
aVclose that disgraceful disconnect
p241
aVbetween what the American public wants
p242
aVand what our elected leaders are doing about it.
p243
aa(lp244
VUntil recently,
p245
aVthe narrative in Congress was that calls from the other side,
p246
aVfrom that six percent,
p247
aVoutnumbered calls from our side 10 to one.
p248
aVWe're flipping that narrative on its head.
p249
aVAfter that recent terrible tragedy in San Bernardino,
p250
aVwe jammed Congressional switchboards.
p251
aVWe put 15,000 calls into Congress in 24 hours.
p252
aVAnd you know what?
p253
aVWe got a vote on a bill
p254
aVthat nobody thought was going to see the light of day anytime soon.
p255
aVWe're seeing real movement to repeal some of the most evil,
p256
aVugly gun lobby legislation passed over the last dark decade.
p257
aVThe stranglehold of the gun lobby is clearly being broken.
p258
aVWe've seen President Obama's historic executive actions.
p259
aVThey don't go all the way,
p260
aVbut they are going to save lives,
p261
aVbecause they expand Brady background checks
p262
aVto thousands of gun sales that didn't have them previously.
p263
aVAnd we're marching across the country \u2014 we're not just waiting
p264
aVfor Congress to act; that would almost be the definition of insanity.
p265
aVWe're marching across the country,
p266
aVstate by state, marriage-equality style.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd you know what? We're winning.
p269
aVCongress is almost always the last to wake up and realize
p270
aVthat it's on the wrong side of history.
p271
aVAnd when they do, it's always because the American public shakes them.
p272
aVAnd that's exactly what we're doing right now,
p273
aVas we're in this tipping point.
p274
aa(lp275
VYou know, recently I was flying cross-country to give a speech
p276
aVto a large group like this, although far less intimidating,
p277
aVand the woman sitting next to me happened to be binge-watching
p278
aVone of my all-time favorite TV shows, "Mad Men,"
p279
aVa period TV show about advertising
p280
aVin the 1960s.
p281
aVAnd as I was trying to think about how to end my remarks,
p282
aVI'd glance up at her screen every now and then,
p283
aVand it seemed that every time I did,
p284
aVI'd see somebody smoking in an office or around children
p285
aVor while pregnant or drinking and driving
p286
aVor driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a coworker.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd ultimately it dawned on me:
p289
aVwhat tremendous inspiration
p290
aVto those of us who have this dream to end gun violence.
p291
aVI mean, think about how much the world has changed
p292
aVin a relatively short period of time,
p293
aVhow all those behaviors that were once considered commonplace or normal \u2014
p294
aVsome even glamorous or sexy \u2014
p295
aVhave become stigmatized in just a generation or two,
p296
aVonce they became conversations about our common ground.
p297
aVThat is the magnitude of the change we have the potential to create
p298
aVaround gun violence.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd that's my dream,
p301
aVthat maybe someday,
p302
aVsome period TV show will depict the terrible nightmare of gun violence,
p303
aVand a future generation of children might only be able to imagine
p304
aVhow terrible it must have been.
p305
aa(lp306
VThank you.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VThank you.

VI'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine
p5
aVthat I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard,
p6
aVand I'll try to make some connections myself,
p7
aVin case you missed them.
p8
aa(lp9
VBut I want to start with what I call the "official dogma."
p10
aVThe official dogma of what?
p11
aVThe official dogma of all Western industrial societies.
p12
aVAnd the official dogma runs like this:
p13
aVif we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens,
p14
aVthe way to do that is to maximize individual freedom.
p15
aVThe reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good,
p16
aVvaluable, worthwhile, essential to being human.
p17
aVAnd because if people have freedom,
p18
aVthen each of us can act on our own
p19
aVto do the things that will maximize our welfare,
p20
aVand no one has to decide on our behalf.
p21
aVThe way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe more choice people have, the more freedom they have,
p24
aVand the more freedom they have,
p25
aVthe more welfare they have.
p26
aVThis, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply
p27
aVthat it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it.
p28
aVAnd it's also deeply embedded in our lives.
p29
aVI'll give you some examples
p30
aVof what modern progress has made possible for us.
p31
aa(lp32
VThis is my supermarket.
p33
aVNot such a big one.
p34
aVI want to say just a word about salad dressing.
p35
aV175 salad dressings in my supermarket,
p36
aVif you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils
p37
aVand 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy
p38
aVto make a very large number of your own salad dressings,
p39
aVin the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you.
p40
aVSo this is what the supermarket is like.
p41
aVAnd then you go to the consumer electronics store
p42
aVto set up a stereo system \u2014
p43
aVspeakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier \u2014
p44
aVand in this one single consumer electronics store,
p45
aVthere are that many stereo systems.
p46
aVWe can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems
p47
aVout of the components that are on offer in one store.
p48
aa(lp49
VYou've got to admit that's a lot of choice.
p50
aVIn other domains \u2014 the world of communications.
p51
aVThere was a time, when I was a boy,
p52
aVwhen you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted,
p53
aVas long as it came from Ma Bell.
p54
aVYou rented your phone. You didn't buy it.
p55
aVOne consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke.
p56
aVAnd those days are gone.
p57
aVWe now have an almost unlimited variety of phones,
p58
aVespecially in the world of cell phones.
p59
aVThese are cell phones of the future.
p60
aVMy favorite is the middle one \u2014
p61
aVthe MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and crème brûlée torch.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet,
p66
aVyou can rest assured that one day soon, you will.
p67
aVAnd what this does
p68
aVis it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question.
p69
aVAnd do you know what the answer to this question now is?
p70
aVThe answer is "no."
p71
aVIt is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things,
p74
aVthe same explosion of choice is true.
p75
aVHealth care.
p76
aVIt is no longer the case in the United States
p77
aVthat you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do.
p78
aVInstead, you go to the doctor,
p79
aVand the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B.
p80
aVA has these benefits, and these risks.
p81
aVB has these benefits, and these risks.
p82
aVWhat do you want to do?"
p83
aVAnd you say, "Doc, what should I do?"
p84
aVAnd the doc says, "A has these benefits and risks,
p85
aVand B has these benefits and risks.
p86
aVWhat do you want to do?"
p87
aVAnd you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?"
p88
aVAnd the doc says, "But I'm not you."
p89
aVAnd the result is \u2014 we call it "patient autonomy,"
p90
aVwhich makes it sound like a good thing,
p91
aVbut it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility
p92
aVfor decision-making from somebody who knows something \u2014
p93
aVnamely, the doctor \u2014
p94
aVto somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick
p95
aVand thus not in the best shape to be making decisions \u2014
p96
aVnamely, the patient.
p97
aVThere's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
p98
aVto people like you and me,
p99
aVwhich, if you think about it, makes no sense at all,
p100
aVsince we can't buy them.
p101
aVWhy do they market to us if we can't buy them?
p102
aVThe answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning
p103
aVand ask for our prescriptions to be changed.
p104
aa(lp105
VSomething as dramatic as our identity
p106
aVhas now become a matter of choice,
p107
aVas this slide is meant to indicate.
p108
aVWe don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it.
p109
aVAnd we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like.
p110
aVAnd that means that every day, when you wake up in the morning,
p111
aVyou have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
p112
aVWith respect to marriage and family,
p113
aVthere was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had
p114
aVis that you got married as soon as you could,
p115
aVand then you started having kids as soon as you could.
p116
aVThe only real choice was who,
p117
aVnot when, and not what you did after.
p118
aa(lp119
VNowadays, everything is very much up for grabs.
p120
aVI teach wonderfully intelligent students,
p121
aVand I assign 20 percent less work than I used to.
p122
aVAnd it's not because they're less smart,
p123
aVand it's not because they're less diligent.
p124
aVIt's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves,
p125
aV"Should I get married or not? Should I get married now?
p126
aVShould I get married later?
p127
aVShould I have kids first, or a career first?"
p128
aVAll of these are consuming questions.
p129
aVAnd they're going to answer these questions,
p130
aVwhether or not it means not doing all the work I assign
p131
aVand not getting a good grade in my courses.
p132
aVAnd indeed they should.
p133
aVThese are important questions to answer.
p134
aa(lp135
VWork \u2014
p136
aVwe are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,
p137
aVwith the technology that enables us
p138
aVto work every minute of every day from any place on the planet \u2014
p139
aVexcept the Randolph Hotel.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
V(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VThere is one corner, by the way,
p146
aVthat I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi actually works.
p147
aVI'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.
p148
aVSo what this means,
p149
aVthis incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work,
p150
aVis that we have to make a decision,
p151
aVagain and again and again,
p152
aVabout whether we should or shouldn't be working.
p153
aVWe can go to watch our kid play soccer,
p154
aVand we have our cell phone on one hip,
p155
aVand our Blackberry on our other hip,
p156
aVand our laptop, presumably, on our laps.
p157
aVAnd even if they're all shut off,
p158
aVevery minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game,
p159
aVwe are also asking ourselves,
p160
aV"Should I answer this cell phone call?
p161
aVShould I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?"
p162
aVAnd even if the answer to the question is "no,"
p163
aVit's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game
p164
aVvery different than it would've been.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo everywhere we look,
p167
aVbig things and small things, material things and lifestyle things,
p168
aVlife is a matter of choice.
p169
aVAnd the world we used to live in looked like this.
p170
aV[Well, actually, they are written in stone.]
p171
aVThat is to say, there were some choices,
p172
aVbut not everything was a matter of choice.
p173
aVAnd the world we now live in looks like this.
p174
aa(lp175
V[The Ten Commandments DYI Kit]
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd the question is, is this good news, or bad news?
p178
aVAnd the answer is, "yes."
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VWe all know what's good about it,
p183
aVso I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.
p184
aVAll of this choice has two effects,
p185
aVtwo negative effects on people.
p186
aVOne effect, paradoxically,
p187
aVis that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation.
p188
aVWith so many options to choose from,
p189
aVpeople find it very difficult to choose at all.
p190
aVI'll give you one very dramatic example of this:
p191
aVa study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans.
p192
aVA colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard,
p193
aVthe gigantic mutual-fund company
p194
aVof about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.
p195
aVAnd what she found
p196
aVis that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered,
p197
aVrate of participation went down two percent.
p198
aVYou offer 50 funds \u2014 10 percent fewer employees participate
p199
aVthan if you only offer five.
p200
aVWhy?
p201
aVBecause with 50 funds to choose from,
p202
aVit's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose,
p203
aVthat you'll just put it off until tomorrow.
p204
aVAnd then tomorrow,
p205
aVand tomorrow, and tomorrow,
p206
aVand of course tomorrow never comes.
p207
aVUnderstand that not only does this mean
p208
aVthat people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire
p209
aVbecause they don't have enough money put away,
p210
aVit also means that making the decision is so hard
p211
aVthat they pass up significant matching money from the employer.
p212
aVBy not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year
p213
aVfrom the employer,
p214
aVwho would happily match their contribution.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
p217
aVAnd I think it makes the world look like this.
p218
aa(lp219
V[And lastly, for all eternity, French, bleu cheese, or ranch?]
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VYou really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right?
p224
aVYou don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing.
p225
aVSo that's one effect.
p226
aVThe second effect
p227
aVis that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice,
p228
aVwe end up less satisfied with the result of the choice
p229
aVthan we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.
p230
aVAnd there are several reasons for this.
p231
aVOne of them
p232
aVis that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from,
p233
aVif you buy one, and it's not perfect \u2014 and what salad dressing is? \u2014
p234
aVit's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice
p235
aVthat would have been better.
p236
aVAnd what happens
p237
aVis this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made,
p238
aVand this regret subtracts from the satisfaction
p239
aVyou get out of the decision you made,
p240
aVeven if it was a good decision.
p241
aVThe more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all
p242
aVthat is disappointing about the option that you chose.
p243
aa(lp244
VSecond, what economists call "opportunity costs."
p245
aVDan Gilbert made a big point this morning
p246
aVof talking about how much the way in which we value things
p247
aVdepends on what we compare them to.
p248
aVWell, when there are lots of alternatives to consider,
p249
aVit is easy to imagine the attractive features
p250
aVof alternatives that you reject
p251
aVthat make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen.
p252
aVHere's an example.
p253
aa(lp254
V[I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th street]
p255
aa(lp256
VSorry if you're not New Yorkers.
p257
aVHere's what you're supposed to be thinking.
p258
aVHere's this couple on the Hamptons.
p259
aVVery expensive real estate.
p260
aVGorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves.
p261
aVWhat could be better?
p262
aV"Well, damn it," this guy is thinking,
p263
aV"It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.
p264
aVI could be parking right in front of my building."
p265
aVAnd he spends two weeks nagged by the idea
p266
aVthat he is missing the opportunity,
p267
aVday after day, to have a great parking space.
p268
aVOpportunity costs
p269
aVsubtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose,
p270
aVeven when what we choose is terrific.
p271
aVAnd the more options there are to consider,
p272
aVthe more attractive features of these options
p273
aVare going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.
p274
aa(lp275
VHere's another example.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VNow this cartoon makes a lot of points.
p280
aVIt makes points about living in the moment as well,
p281
aVand probably about doing things slowly.
p282
aVBut one point it makes
p283
aVis that whenever you're choosing one thing,
p284
aVyou're choosing not to do other things
p285
aVthat may have lots of attractive features,
p286
aVand it's going to make what you're doing less attractive.
p287
aa(lp288
VThird: escalation of expectations.
p289
aVThis hit me when I went to replace my jeans.
p290
aVI wear jeans almost all the time.
p291
aVThere was a time when jeans came in one flavor,
p292
aVand you bought them, and they fit like crap,
p293
aVthey were incredibly uncomfortable,
p294
aVif you wore them and washed them enough times,
p295
aVthey started to feel OK.
p296
aVI went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones,
p297
aVand I said, "I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size."
p298
aVAnd the shopkeeper said,
p299
aV"Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit?
p300
aVYou want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed?
p301
aVDo you want them distressed?
p302
aVYou want boot cut, tapered, blah blah." On and on he went.
p303
aVMy jaw dropped.
p304
aVAnd after I recovered, I said,
p305
aV"I want the kind that used to be the only kind."
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VHe had no idea what that was,
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
Vso I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans,
p314
aVand I walked out of the store \u2014 truth! \u2014
p315
aVwith the best-fitting jeans I had ever had.
p316
aVI did better.
p317
aa(lp318
VAll this choice made it possible for me to do better.
p319
aVBut \u2014
p320
aVI felt worse.
p321
aVWhy? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself.
p322
aVThe reason \u2014
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VThe reason I felt worse is that,
p327
aVwith all of these options available,
p328
aVmy expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.
p329
aVI had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor.
p330
aVWhen they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect.
p331
aVAnd what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.
p332
aVAnd so I compared what I got to what I expected,
p333
aVand what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected.
p334
aVAdding options to people's lives
p335
aVcan't help but increase the expectations people have
p336
aVabout how good those options will be.
p337
aVAnd what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results,
p338
aVeven when they're good results.
p339
aVNobody in the world of marketing knows this.
p340
aa(lp341
V[It all looks so great. I can't wait to be disappointed.]
p342
aa(lp343
VBecause if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.
p344
aVThe truth is more like this.
p345
aa(lp346
V[Everything was better back when everything was worse]
p347
aa(lp348
VThe reason that everything was better back when everything was worse
p349
aVis that when everything was worse,
p350
aVit was actually possible for people
p351
aVto have experiences that were a pleasant surprise.
p352
aVNowadays, the world we live in \u2014 we affluent, industrialized citizens,
p353
aVwith perfection the expectation \u2014
p354
aVthe best you can ever hope for
p355
aVis that stuff is as good as you expect it to be.
p356
aVYou will never be pleasantly surprised
p357
aVbecause your expectations, my expectations,
p358
aVhave gone through the roof.
p359
aVThe secret to happiness \u2014 this is what you all came for \u2014
p360
aVthe secret to happiness
p361
aVis low expectations.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
V[You'll do]
p366
aa(lp367
V(Applause)
p368
aa(lp369
V(Laughter)
p370
aa(lp371
VI want to say \u2014
p372
aVjust a little autobiographical moment \u2014
p373
aVthat I actually am married to a wife,
p374
aVand she's really quite wonderful.
p375
aVI couldn't have done better.
p376
aVI didn't settle.
p377
aVBut settling isn't always such a bad thing.
p378
aa(lp379
VFinally \u2014
p380
aVOne consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans
p381
aVwhen there is only one kind to buy
p382
aVis that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why,
p383
aVwho's responsible,
p384
aVthe answer is clear: the world is responsible.
p385
aVWhat could you do?
p386
aVWhen there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available,
p387
aVand you buy one that is disappointing,
p388
aVand you ask why, who's responsible?
p389
aVIt is equally clear that the answer to the question is "you."
p390
aVYou could have done better.
p391
aVWith a hundred different kinds of jeans on display,
p392
aVthere is no excuse for failure.
p393
aVAnd so when people make decisions,
p394
aVand even though the results of the decisions are good,
p395
aVthey feel disappointed about them;
p396
aVthey blame themselves.
p397
aa(lp398
VClinical depression has exploded
p399
aVin the industrial world in the last generation.
p400
aVI believe a significant \u2014 not the only, but a significant \u2014 contributor
p401
aVto this explosion of depression, and also suicide,
p402
aVis that people have experiences that are disappointing
p403
aVbecause their standards are so high,
p404
aVand then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves,
p405
aVthey think they're at fault.
p406
aVAnd so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively,
p407
aVand we feel worse.
p408
aVSo let me remind you.
p409
aVThis is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true,
p410
aVand it's all false.
p411
aVIt is not true.
p412
aVThere's no question that some choice is better than none,
p413
aVbut it doesn't follow from that
p414
aVthat more choice is better than some choice.
p415
aVThere's some magical amount. I don't know what it is.
p416
aVI'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point
p417
aVwhere options improve our welfare.
p418
aa(lp419
VNow, as a policy matter \u2014 I'm almost done \u2014
p420
aVas a policy matter, the thing to think about is this:
p421
aVwhat enables all of this choice
p422
aVin industrial societies is material affluence.
p423
aVThere are lots of places in the world,
p424
aVand we have heard about several of them,
p425
aVwhere their problem is not that they have too much choice.
p426
aVTheir problem is that they have too little.
p427
aVSo the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem
p428
aVof modern, affluent, Western societies.
p429
aVAnd what is so frustrating and infuriating is this:
p430
aVSteve Levitt talked to you yesterday
p431
aVabout how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats
p432
aVdon't help.
p433
aVIt's a waste of money.
p434
aVWhat I'm telling you
p435
aVis that these expensive, complicated choices \u2014
p436
aVit's not simply that they don't help.
p437
aVThey actually hurt.
p438
aVThey actually make us worse off.
p439
aa(lp440
VIf some of what enables people in our societies
p441
aVto make all of the choices we make
p442
aVwere shifted to societies in which people have too few options,
p443
aVnot only would those people's lives be improved,
p444
aVbut ours would be improved also,
p445
aVwhich is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move."
p446
aVIncome redistribution will make everyone better off \u2014
p447
aVnot just poor people \u2014
p448
aVbecause of how all this excess choice plagues us.
p449
aVSo to conclude.
p450
aV[You can be anything you want to be \u2014 no limits]
p451
aVYou're supposed to read this cartoon, and, being a sophisticated person, say,

aV"Ah! What does this fish know?
p453
aVYou know, nothing is possible in this fishbowl."
p454
aVImpoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world \u2014

aVand that's the way I read it at first.
p456
aVThe more I thought about it, however,
p457
aVthe more I came to the view that this fish knows something.
p458
aVBecause the truth of the matter
p459
aVis that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible,
p460
aVyou don't have freedom.
p461
aVYou have paralysis.
p462
aVIf you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible,
p463
aVyou decrease satisfaction.
p464
aVYou increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction.

aa(lp466
VEverybody needs a fishbowl.
p467
aVThis one is almost certainly too limited \u2014

aVBut the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery,
p470
aVand, I suspect, disaster.

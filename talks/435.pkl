VMy work is play.
p5
aVAnd I play when I design.
p6
aVI even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure
p7
aVthat I actually do that,
p8
aVand the definition of play,
p9
aVnumber one, was engaging in a childlike
p10
aVactivity or endeavor,
p11
aVand number two was gambling.
p12
aVAnd I realize I do both
p13
aVwhen I'm designing.
p14
aVI'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.
p15
aVAnd I think that if you're not,
p16
aVthere's probably something inherently wrong
p17
aVwith the structure or the situation you're in,
p18
aVif you're a designer.
p19
aVBut the serious part is what threw me,
p20
aVand I couldn't quite get a handle
p21
aVon it until I remembered an essay.
p22
aVAnd it's an essay I read 30 years ago.
p23
aVIt was written by Russell Baker,
p24
aVwho used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.
p25
aVHe's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you
p26
aVthis essay,
p27
aVor an excerpt from it
p28
aVbecause it really hit home for me.
p29
aVHere is a letter of friendly advice.
p30
aa(lp31
VBe serious, it says.
p32
aVWhat it means, of course, is, be solemn.
p33
aVBeing solemn is easy.
p34
aVBeing serious is hard.
p35
aVChildren almost always begin by being serious,
p36
aVwhich is what makes them so entertaining
p37
aVwhen compared with adults as a class.
p38
aVAdults, on the whole, are solemn.
p39
aVIn politics, the rare candidate who is serious,
p40
aVlike Adlai Stevenson,
p41
aVis easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.
p42
aVThat's because it is hard for most people
p43
aVto recognize seriousness, which is rare,
p44
aVbut more comfortable to endorse solemnity,
p45
aVwhich is commonplace.
p46
aVJogging, which is commonplace,
p47
aVand widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.
p48
aVPoker is serious.
p49
aVWashington, D.C. is solemn.
p50
aVNew York is serious.
p51
aVGoing to educational conferences to tell you anything
p52
aVabout the future is solemn.
p53
aVTaking a long walk by yourself,
p54
aVduring which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's,
p55
aVis serious.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, when I apply Russell Baker's definition
p60
aVof solemnity or seriousness to design,
p61
aVit doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality.
p62
aVSolemn design is often important and very effective design.
p63
aVSolemn design is also socially correct,
p64
aVand is accepted by appropriate audiences.
p65
aVIt's what right-thinking designers
p66
aVand all the clients are striving for.
p67
aVSerious design, serious play,
p68
aVis something else.
p69
aVFor one thing, it often happens
p70
aVspontaneously, intuitively,
p71
aVaccidentally or incidentally.
p72
aVIt can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance,
p73
aVor out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.
p74
aVBut mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy
p75
aVparts of human behavior that
p76
aVdon't really make any sense.
p77
aa(lp78
VSerious design is imperfect.
p79
aVIt's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being
p80
aVthe first of its kind.
p81
aVSerious design is also \u2014 often \u2014 quite unsuccessful
p82
aVfrom the solemn point of view.
p83
aVThat's because the art of serious play
p84
aVis about invention, change, rebellion \u2014 not perfection.
p85
aVPerfection happens during solemn play.
p86
aVNow, I always saw design careers
p87
aVlike surreal staircases.
p88
aVIf you look at the staircase, you'll see
p89
aVthat in your 20s the risers are very high
p90
aVand the steps are very short,
p91
aVand you make huge discoveries.
p92
aVYou sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.
p93
aVThat's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn,
p94
aVand so that anything you do is a learning experience
p95
aVand you're just jumping right up there.
p96
aVAs you get older, the risers get shallower
p97
aVand the steps get wider,
p98
aVand you start moving along at a slower pace
p99
aVbecause you're making fewer discoveries.
p100
aVAnd as you get older and more decrepit,
p101
aVyou sort of inch along on this
p102
aVsort of depressing, long staircase,
p103
aVleading you into oblivion.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VI find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.
p108
aVI'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more
p109
aVthat I'm solemn when I don't have to be.
p110
aVAnd in my 35 years of working experience,
p111
aVI think I was really serious four times.
p112
aVAnd I'm going to show them to you now,
p113
aVbecause they came out of very specific conditions.
p114
aVIt's great to be a kid.
p115
aVNow, when I was in my early 20s,
p116
aVI worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records,
p117
aVand I had no idea what a great job I had.
p118
aVI thought everybody had a job like that.
p119
aVAnd what \u2014
p120
aVthe way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was,
p121
aVwhat was going on around me
p122
aVand the things that came at the time I walked into design
p123
aVwere the enemy.
p124
aVI really, really, really hated
p125
aVthe typeface Helvetica.
p126
aVI thought the typeface Helvetica
p127
aVwas the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic,
p128
aVreally repressive typeface,
p129
aVand I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.
p130
aVAnd when I was in
p131
aVmy college days,
p132
aVthis was the sort of design
p133
aVthat was fashionable and popular.
p134
aVThis is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak,
p135
aVbut I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica,
p136
aVand I made parodies about it.
p137
aVI just thought it was, you know, completely boring.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VSo \u2014 so, my goal in life
p142
aVwas to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.
p143
aVAnd to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica
p144
aVwas actually kind of hard because you had to find it.
p145
aVAnd there weren't a lot of books about the history of design
p146
aVin the early 70s. There weren't \u2014
p147
aVthere wasn't a plethora of design publishing.
p148
aVYou actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.
p149
aVYou had to go places and find the stuff.
p150
aVAnd what I responded to was, you know,
p151
aVArt Nouveau, or deco,
p152
aVor Victorian typography,
p153
aVor things that were just completely not Helvetica.
p154
aVAnd I taught myself design this way,
p155
aVand this was sort of my early years,
p156
aVand I used these things
p157
aVin really goofy ways
p158
aVon record covers and in my design.
p159
aVI wasn't educated. I just sort of
p160
aVput these things together.
p161
aVI mixed up Victorian designs with pop,
p162
aVand I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.
p163
aVAnd I made these very lush,
p164
aVvery elaborate record covers,
p165
aVnot because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist \u2014
p166
aVbecause I didn't know what those things were.
p167
aVI just hated Helvetica.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd that kind of passion
p172
aVdrove me into very serious play,
p173
aVa kind of play I could never do now
p174
aVbecause I'm too well-educated.
p175
aVAnd there's something wonderful about
p176
aVthat form of youth,
p177
aVwhere you can let yourself
p178
aVgrow and play, and be
p179
aVreally a brat, and then accomplish things.
p180
aVBy the end of the '70s, actually,
p181
aVthe stuff became known.
p182
aVI mean, these covers appeared all over the world,
p183
aVand they started winning awards,
p184
aVand people knew them.
p185
aVAnd I was suddenly a post-modernist,
p186
aVand I began a career as \u2014 in my own business.
p187
aVAnd first I was praised for it, then criticized for it,
p188
aVbut the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.
p189
aVI didn't do what I think
p190
aVwas a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.
p191
aVI spent most of the '80s being quite solemn,
p192
aVturning out these sorts of designs
p193
aVthat I was expected to do
p194
aVbecause that's who I was,
p195
aVand I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn
p196
aVto hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo, here was the second condition
p199
aVfor which I think I accomplished some serious play.
p200
aVThere's a Paul Newman movie
p201
aVthat I love called "The Verdict."
p202
aVI don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut.
p203
aVAnd in the movie, he plays
p204
aVa down-and-out lawyer
p205
aVwho's become an ambulance chaser.
p206
aVAnd he's taken on \u2014
p207
aVhe's given, actually \u2014 a malpractice suit to handle
p208
aVthat's sort of an easy deal,
p209
aVand in the midst of trying to connect the deal,
p210
aVhe starts to empathize
p211
aVand identify with his client,
p212
aVand he regains his morality and purpose,
p213
aVand he goes on to win the case.
p214
aVAnd in the depth of despair,
p215
aVin the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off,
p216
aVand he needs this case,
p217
aVhe needs to win this case so badly.
p218
aVThere's a shot of Paul Newman alone,
p219
aVin his office, saying,
p220
aV"This is the case. There are no other cases.
p221
aVThis is the case. There are no other cases."
p222
aVAnd in that moment of
p223
aVdesire and focus,
p224
aVhe can win.
p225
aVAnd that is a wonderful
p226
aVposition to be in to create some serious play.
p227
aVAnd I had that moment in 1994
p228
aVwhen I met a theater director
p229
aVnamed George Wolfe,
p230
aVwho was going to have me design
p231
aVan identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival,
p232
aVthen known,
p233
aVand then became the Public Theater.
p234
aVAnd I began getting immersed
p235
aVin this project
p236
aVin a way I never was before.
p237
aa(lp238
VThis is what theater advertising looked like at that time.
p239
aVThis is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.
p240
aVSo, this is sort of a comment on the time.
p241
aVAnd the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.
p242
aVThey had no logo and no identity,
p243
aVbut they had these very iconic posters
p244
aVpainted by Paul Davis.
p245
aVAnd George Wolf had taken over from another director
p246
aVand he wanted to change the theater,
p247
aVand he wanted to make it urban and loud
p248
aVand a place that was inclusive.
p249
aVSo, drawing on my love of typography,
p250
aVI immersed myself into this project.
p251
aVAnd what was different about it was the totality of it,
p252
aVwas that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place
p253
aVin a way I had never done before,
p254
aVwhere every aspect \u2014
p255
aVthe smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was \u2014
p256
aVwas designed by me.
p257
aVThere was no format.
p258
aVThere was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.
p259
aVI literally for three years made everything \u2014
p260
aVevery scrap of paper, everything online,
p261
aVthat this theater did.
p262
aVAnd it was the only job,
p263
aVeven though I was doing other jobs.
p264
aVI lived and breathed it in a way I haven't
p265
aVwith a client since.
p266
aVIt enabled me to really express myself and grow.
p267
aVAnd I think that you know
p268
aVwhen you're going to be given this position,
p269
aVand it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity,
p270
aVit's the moment of serious play.
p271
aa(lp272
VI did these things, and I still do them.
p273
aVI still work for the Public Theater.
p274
aVI'm on their board, and
p275
aVI still am involved with it.
p276
aVThe high point of the Public Theater, I think, was in 1996,
p277
aVtwo years after I designed it,
p278
aVwhich was the "Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk" campaign
p279
aVthat was all over New York.
p280
aVBut something happened to it, and what happened to it was,
p281
aVit became very popular.
p282
aVAnd that is a kiss of death for something serious
p283
aVbecause it makes it solemn.
p284
aVAnd what happened was
p285
aVthat New York City, to a degree,
p286
aVate my identity
p287
aVbecause people began to copy it.
p288
aVHere's an ad in the New York Times
p289
aVsomebody did for a play called "Mind Games."
p290
aVThen "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics,
p291
aVand the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away,
p292
aVwhich meant I had to change it.
p293
aVSo, I changed it so that every season was different,
p294
aVand I continued to do these posters,
p295
aVbut they never had the seriousness
p296
aVof the first identity
p297
aVbecause they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft
p298
aVof everything being the same thing.
p299
aVNow \u2014 and I think since the Public Theater,
p300
aVI must have done more than a dozen
p301
aVcultural identities for major institutions,
p302
aVand I don't think I ever \u2014 I ever
p303
aVgrasped that seriousness again \u2014
p304
aVI do them for very big, important institutions
p305
aVin New York City.
p306
aa(lp307
VThe institutions are solemn,
p308
aVand so is the design.
p309
aVThey're better crafted than the Public Theater was,
p310
aVand they spend more money on them, but I think
p311
aVthat that moment comes and goes.
p312
aVThe best way to accomplish serious design \u2014
p313
aVwhich I think we all have the opportunity to do \u2014
p314
aVis to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.
p315
aVThat doesn't happen very often,
p316
aVbut it happened to me in the year 2000,
p317
aVwhen for some reason or another,
p318
aVa whole pile of different architects
p319
aVstarted to ask me to design
p320
aVthe insides of theaters with them,
p321
aVwhere I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.
p322
aVI'd never done this kind of work before.
p323
aVI didn't know how to read an architectural plan,
p324
aVI didn't know what they were talking about,
p325
aVand I really couldn't handle the fact that a job \u2014
p326
aVa single job \u2014 could go on for four years
p327
aVbecause I was used to immediacy in graphic design,
p328
aVand that kind of attention to detail
p329
aVwas really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo, it was a rough \u2014 it was a rough go,
p332
aVbut I fell in love with this process
p333
aVof actually integrating graphics into architecture
p334
aVbecause I didn't know what I was doing.
p335
aVI said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"
p336
aVNew Yorkers look at their feet.
p337
aVAnd then I found that actors and actresses
p338
aVactually take their cues from the floor,
p339
aVso it turned out that these sorts of sign systems
p340
aVbegan to make sense.
p341
aVThey integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.
p342
aVThey ran around corners,
p343
aVthey went up sides of buildings,
p344
aVand they melded into the architecture.
p345
aVThis is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway,
p346
aVand the type is interwoven into the stainless steel
p347
aVand backlit with fiber optics.
p348
aVAnd the architect, Jim Polshek,
p349
aVessentially gave me a canvas
p350
aVto play typography out on.
p351
aVAnd it was serious play.
p352
aVThis is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
p353
aVmade out of completely inexpensive materials.
p354
aVExtruded typography that's backlit with neon.
p355
aVThings I never did before, built before.
p356
aVI just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.
p357
aVDonors' walls made out of Lucite.
p358
aVAnd then, inexpensive signage.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
VI think my favorite of these
p363
aVwas this little job in Newark, New Jersey.
p364
aVIt's a performing arts school.
p365
aVThis is the building that \u2014 they had no money,
p366
aVand they had to recast it, and they said,
p367
aVif we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?
p368
aVAnd I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said,
p369
aVWell, I think we can paint it.
p370
aVAnd we did. And it was play.
p371
aVAnd there's the building. Everything was painted \u2014
p372
aVtypography over the whole damn thing,
p373
aVincluding the air conditioning ducts.
p374
aVI hired guys who paint flats
p375
aVfixed on the sides of garages
p376
aVto do the painting on the building, and they loved it.
p377
aVThey got into it \u2014 they took the job incredibly seriously.
p378
aVThey used to climb up on the building and call me
p379
aVand tell me that they had to correct my typography \u2014
p380
aVthat my spacing was wrong, and they moved it,
p381
aVand they did wonderful things with it.
p382
aVThey were pretty serious, too. It was quite wonderful.
p383
aa(lp384
VBy the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters
p385
aVmy work had begun to become accepted.
p386
aVPeople wanted it in big, expensive places.
p387
aVAnd that began to make it solemn.
p388
aVBloomberg was all about numbers,
p389
aVand we did big numbers through the space
p390
aVand the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED
p391
aVthat my partner, Lisa Strausfeld, programmed.
p392
aVBut it became the end
p393
aVof the seriousness of the play,
p394
aVand it started to, once again, become solemn.
p395
aVThis is a current project
p396
aVin Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
p397
aVwhere I got to be goofy.
p398
aVI was invited to design
p399
aVa logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side,
p400
aVand I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.
p401
aVI think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?
p402
aVA neighborhood has a thing \u2014 it's got a landmark, it's got a place,
p403
aVit's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be?
p404
aa(lp405
VSo I had to actually give a presentation
p406
aVto a city council
p407
aVand neighborhood constituents,
p408
aVand I went to Pittsburgh and I said,
p409
aV"You know, really what you have here
p410
aVare all these underpasses
p411
aVthat separate the neighborhood from the center of town.
p412
aVWhy don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?"
p413
aVSo I began doing this crazy presentation
p414
aVof these installations \u2014
p415
aVpotential installations \u2014 on
p416
aVthese underpass bridges,
p417
aVand stood up in front of the city council \u2014
p418
aVand was a little bit scared,
p419
aVI have to admit.
p420
aVBut I was so utterly unqualified for this project,
p421
aVand so utterly ridiculous,
p422
aVand ignored the brief so desperately
p423
aVthat I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness,
p424
aVjust completely because it was so goofy to begin with.
p425
aVAnd this is the bridge they're actually
p426
aVpainting up and preparing as we speak.
p427
aVIt will change every six months, and it will become an art installation
p428
aVin the North Side of Pittsburgh,
p429
aVand it will probably become a landmark in the area.
p430
aa(lp431
VJohn Hockenberry told you a bit about
p432
aVmy travail with Citibank,
p433
aVthat is now a 10-year relationship, and I still work with them.
p434
aVAnd I actually am amused by them and like them,
p435
aVand think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation
p436
aVthey actually keep their graphics very nice.
p437
aVI drew the logo for Citibank
p438
aVon a napkin in the first meeting.
p439
aVThat was the play part of the job.
p440
aVAnd then I spent a year
p441
aVgoing to long, tedious,
p442
aVboring meetings,
p443
aVtrying to sell this logo through
p444
aVto a huge corporation
p445
aVto the point of tears.
p446
aVI thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.
p447
aVWe made idiotic presentations
p448
aVshowing how the Citi logo made sense,
p449
aVand how it was really derived from an umbrella,
p450
aVand we made animations of these things,
p451
aVand we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
p452
aVAnd it was worth it, because they bought this thing,
p453
aVand it played out on such a grand scale,
p454
aVand it's so internationally recognizable,
p455
aVbut for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.
p456
aVAs a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logo
p457
aVuntil Fallon put it on
p458
aVits very good "Live Richly" campaign,
p459
aVand then everybody accepted it all over the world.
p460
aa(lp461
VSo during this time I needed
p462
aVsome kind of counterbalance
p463
aVfor this crazy, crazy existence
p464
aVof going to these long, idiotic meetings.
p465
aVAnd I was up in my country house,
p466
aVand for some reason, I began painting
p467
aVthese very big, very involved,
p468
aVlaborious, complicated
p469
aVmaps of the entire world,
p470
aVand listing every place on the planet, and putting them in,
p471
aVand misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot,
p472
aVand completely controlling the information,
p473
aVand going totally and completely nuts with it.
p474
aVThey would take me about six months initially,
p475
aVbut then I started getting faster at it.
p476
aVHere's the United States.
p477
aVEvery single city of the United States is on here.
p478
aVAnd it hung for about eight months
p479
aVat the Cooper-Hewitt, and people walked up to it,
p480
aVand they would point to a part of the map
p481
aVand they'd say, "Oh, I've been here."
p482
aVAnd, of course, they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot.
p483
aV(Laughter)
p484
aVBut what I liked about it was,
p485
aVI was controlling my own idiotic information,
p486
aVand I was creating my own palette of information,
p487
aVand I was totally and completely
p488
aVat play.
p489
aVOne of my favorites was
p490
aVthis painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election
p491
aVthat has the election results rolling around in the water.
p492
aVI keep that for evidence.
p493
aa(lp494
V(Laughter)
p495
aa(lp496
VSomebody
p497
aVwas up at my house and saw the paintings
p498
aVand recommended them to a gallery,
p499
aVand I had a first show
p500
aVabout two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintings
p501
aVthat I'm showing you now.
p502
aVAnd then a funny thing happened \u2014 they sold.
p503
aVAnd they sold quickly,
p504
aVand became rather popular.
p505
aVWe started making prints from them.
p506
aVThis is Manhattan, one from the series.
p507
aVThis is a print from the United States which we did in red, white and blue.
p508
aVWe began doing these big silkscreen prints,
p509
aVand they started selling, too.
p510
aVSo, the gallery wanted me to have another show
p511
aVin two years,
p512
aVwhich meant that I really
p513
aVhad to paint these paintings
p514
aVmuch faster
p515
aVthan I had ever done them. And I \u2014
p516
aVthey started to become more political, and I picked areas
p517
aVthat sort of were in the news
p518
aVor that I had some feeling about,
p519
aVand I began doing these things.
p520
aa(lp521
VAnd then this funny thing happened.
p522
aVI found that I was no longer at play.
p523
aVI was actually in this solemn landscape
p524
aVof fulfilling an expectation
p525
aVfor a show,
p526
aVwhich is not where I started with these things.
p527
aVSo, while they became successful,
p528
aVI know how to make them,
p529
aVso I'm not a neophyte,
p530
aVand they're no longer serious \u2014
p531
aVthey have become solemn.
p532
aVAnd that's a terrifying factor \u2014
p533
aVwhen you start something and it turns that way \u2014
p534
aVbecause it means that all that's left for you
p535
aVis to go back and to find out
p536
aVwhat the next thing is that you can push,
p537
aVthat you can invent, that you can be ignorant about,
p538
aVthat you can be arrogant about,
p539
aVthat you can fail with,
p540
aVand that you can be a fool with.
p541
aVBecause in the end, that's how you grow,
p542
aVand that's all that matters.
p543
aa(lp544
VSo, I'm plugging along here \u2014
p545
aV(Laughter)
p546
aVand I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase.
p547
aVThank you very much.

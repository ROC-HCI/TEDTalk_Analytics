VThis is your conference,
p5
aVand I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period,
p6
aVabout this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.
p7
aVSo, I'm just going to grab a chair here.
p8
aa(lp9
VTwo years ago at TED, I think \u2014
p10
aVI've come to this conclusion \u2014
p11
aVI think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.
p12
aVI think that I may have believed unconsciously,
p13
aVthen, that I was kind of a business hero.
p14
aVI had this company that I'd spent 15 years building. It's called Future;
p15
aVit was a magazine publishing company.
p16
aVIt had recently gone public
p17
aVand the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars,
p18
aVa number I didn't really understand.
p19
aVA magazine I'd recently launched called Business 2.0
p20
aVwas fatter than a telephone directory,
p21
aVbusy pumping hot air into the bubble.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVAnd I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom
p24
aVthat was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more.
p25
aVAnd all this had come from nothing.
p26
aVFifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at
p27
aVwhen I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine."
p28
aVAnd 15 years later, there are 100 of them
p29
aVand 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.
p30
aVThe date was February 2000.
p31
aVI thought the little graph of my business life
p32
aVthat kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law \u2014
p33
aVever upward and to the right \u2014 it was going to go on forever.
p34
aVI mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.
p35
aa(lp36
VThe dotcom, ironically called Snowball,
p37
aVwas the very last consumer web company to go public
p38
aVthe next month before NASDAQ exploded, and I entered 18 months of business hell.
p39
aVI watched everything that I'd built crumbling,
p40
aVand it looked like all this stuff was going to die
p41
aVand 15 years work would have come for nothing.
p42
aVAnd it was gut wrenching.
p43
aVIt took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees,
p44
aVsomething which I was very proud of in the business.
p45
aVFebruary 2001 \u2014 in one day we laid off 350 people,
p46
aVand before the bloodshed was finished, 1,000 people had lost their jobs
p47
aVfrom my companies. I felt sick.
p48
aVI watched my own net worth falling
p49
aVby about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months.
p50
aVAnd worse than that, far worse than that,
p51
aVmy sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.
p52
aVI was going around with this big sign on my forehead: "LOSER."
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVAnd I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back,
p55
aVis how the hell did I let my personal happiness
p56
aVget so tied up with this business thing?
p57
aa(lp58
VWell, in the end, we were able to save Future and Snowball,
p59
aVbut I was, at that point, ready to move on.
p60
aVAnd to cut a long story short, here's where I came to.
p61
aVAnd the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations,
p62
aVthat a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster \u2014
p63
aVemotional rollercoaster \u2014 in the last couple years.
p64
aVThis has been a big, big transition time,
p65
aVand I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us
p66
aVin taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next.
p67
aVThe theme next year is re-birth.
p68
aa(lp69
VIt was at the same TED two years ago
p70
aVwhen Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.
p71
aVAnd at about the same time, and I think partly because of that,
p72
aVI started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus:
p73
aVI started to read again.
p74
aVAnd I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games,
p75
aVthere'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest:
p76
aVcosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology
p77
aVto ... all this stuff had changed.
p78
aVAnd the way in which you could think about us as a species
p79
aVand us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting.
p80
aVAnd what was really most exciting \u2014
p81
aVand I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did \u2014
p82
aVwas that all this stuff is connected.
p83
aVIt's connected; it all hooks into each other.
p84
aa(lp85
VWe talk about this a lot,
p86
aVand I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example:
p87
aVMadame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president,
p88
aVwas famously asked once, "What do you most desire?"
p89
aVAnd she answered, "A penis."
p90
aVAnd when you think about it, it's very true:
p91
aVwhat we all most desire is a penis \u2014
p92
aVor "happiness" as we say in English.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVAnd something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aV(Applause)
p97
aa(lp98
VBut something as basic as happiness,
p99
aVwhich 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion
p100
aVin the church or mosque or synagogue,
p101
aVtoday it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions
p102
aVthat you can ask about it, which are really interesting.
p103
aVYou can ask about what causes it biochemically:
p104
aVneuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.
p105
aVYou can ask what are the psychological causes of it:
p106
aVnature? Nurture? Current circumstance?
p107
aVTurns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.
p108
aVYou can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem:
p109
aVdo you need to incorporate
p110
aVsome sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?
p111
aVYou can view it in sort of geopolitical terms
p112
aVand say, why is it that a billion people on this planet
p113
aVare so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness,
p114
aVand whereas almost all the rest of them,
p115
aVregardless of how much money they have \u2014 whether it's two dollars a day or whatever \u2014
p116
aVare almost equally happy on average?
p117
aVOr you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing:
p118
aVdid our genes invent this as a kind of trick
p119
aVto get us to behave in certain ways? The ant's brain, parasitized,
p120
aVto make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate?
p121
aVAre we the victims of a mass delusion?
p122
aVAnd so on, and so on.
p123
aa(lp124
VTo understand even something as important to us as happiness,
p125
aVyou kind of have to branch off in all these different directions,
p126
aVand there's nowhere that I've discovered \u2014 other than TED \u2014
p127
aVwhere you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.
p128
aVAnd so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about:
p129
aVto understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits;
p130
aVa little bit about everything that surrounds it.
p131
aVAnd so, gradually over these three days,
p132
aVyou start off kind of trying to figure out,
p133
aV"Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?"
p134
aVAnd at the end of the four days,
p135
aVyour brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited,
p136
aVand it's because all these different bits have been put together.
p137
aVIt's the total brain experience, we're going to ...
p138
aVit's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVEvery mental organ addressed. It really is.
p141
aa(lp142
VEnough of the theory, Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right?
p143
aVSo, I will. Here's the vision for TED.
p144
aa(lp145
VNumber one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it.
p146
aVJeff Bezos kindly remarked to me,
p147
aV"Chris, TED is a really great conference.
p148
aVYou're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVSo, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason,
p151
aVand I will promise you right here and now
p152
aVthat the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with.
p153
aVTruth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit,
p154
aVno bandwagoning, no platforms.
p155
aVJust the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies,
p156
aVacross all the disciplines that are represented here.
p157
aVThat's not going to be changed at all.
p158
aa(lp159
VNumber two: I am going to put together
p160
aVan incredible line up of speakers for next year.
p161
aVThe time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic
p162
aVafter coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.
p163
aVThere's a year to do this, and already \u2014
p164
aVI hope to show you a bit later \u2014
p165
aVthere's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.
p166
aVAnd I'm getting fantastic help from the community;
p167
aVthis is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts
p168
aVreach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet.
p169
aVIt's true.
p170
aa(lp171
VNumber three: I do want to, if I can, find a way
p172
aVof extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.
p173
aVAnd one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.
p174
aVBooks kind of saved me in the last couple years,
p175
aVand that's a gift that I would like to pass on.
p176
aVSo, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package
p177
aVwith a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED.
p178
aVThey may well be by a TED speaker,
p179
aVand so we can get the conversation going during the year
p180
aVand come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.
p181
aVI think it will be great.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation,
p184
aVwhich is the new owner of TED.
p185
aVWhat Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED
p186
aVwill go towards the causes that Sapling stands for.
p187
aVAnd more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized here
p188
aVare ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy.
p189
aVAlready, just in the last few days,
p190
aVwe've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about,
p191
aVthat they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world,
p192
aVand the idea of getting this group of people together \u2014
p193
aVsome of the causes that we believe in,
p194
aVthe money that this conference can raise and the ideas \u2014
p195
aVI really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.
p196
aVI'm incredibly excited about that.
p197
aVIn fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life.
p198
aVI'm in this for the long run,
p199
aVand I would be greatly honored and excited
p200
aVif you'll come on this journey with me.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\\"p1\\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>", "slug": "chris_anderson_ted", "whotheyare": "After a long career in journalism and publishing, Chris Anderson became the curator of the TED Conference in 2002 and has developed it as a platform for identifying and disseminating ideas worth spreading.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 187, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/15a78b07d0340fcf8f391e7529b6f4b050a60cc0_254x191.jpg"}], "current_talk": 211, "description": "Chris Anderson gave this talk in 2002, prior to taking over leadership of TED.

"whylisten": "<p class=\\"p1\\">Chris Anderson is the Curator of TED, a nonprofit devoted to sharing valuable ideas, primarily through the medium of &#39;TED Talks&#39; -- short talks that are offered free online to a global audience.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Chris was born in a remote village in Pakistan in 1957. He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\\"p1\\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>", "slug": "chris_anderson_ted", "whotheyare": "After a long career in journalism and publishing, Chris Anderson became the curator of the TED Conference in 2002 and has developed it as a platform for identifying and disseminating ideas worth spreading.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 187, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/15a78b07d0340fcf8f391e7529b6f4b050a60cc0_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "TED\'s nonprofit transition", "take_action": null, "comments": 192, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/27581_480x360.jpg", "description": "Chris Anderson gave this talk in 2002, prior to taking over leadership of TED.

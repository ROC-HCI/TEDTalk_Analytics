VHow would you like to be better than you are?
p5
aVSuppose I said
p6
aVthat, with just a few changes in your genes,
p7
aVyou could get a better memory \u2014
p8
aVmore precise,
p9
aVmore accurate and quicker.
p10
aVOr maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger,
p11
aVwith more stamina.
p12
aVWould you like to be more attractive and self-confident?
p13
aVHow about living longer with good health?
p14
aVOr perhaps you're one of those
p15
aVwho's always yearned for more creativity.
p16
aVWhich one would you like the most?
p17
aVWhich would you like, if you could have just one?
p18
aV(Audience Member: Creativity.)
p19
aVCreativity.
p20
aVHow many people would choose creativity?
p21
aVRaise your hands. Let me see.
p22
aVA few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.
p23
aV(Laughter) That's very good.
p24
aVHow many would opt for memory?
p25
aVQuite a few more.
p26
aVHow about fitness?
p27
aVA few less.
p28
aVWhat about longevity?
p29
aVAh, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
p30
aVIf you could have any one of these,
p31
aVit would be a very different world.
p32
aVIs it just imaginary?
p33
aVOr, is it, perhaps, possible?
p34
aa(lp35
VEvolution has been a perennial topic
p36
aVhere at the TED Conference,
p37
aVbut I want to give you today
p38
aVone doctor's take on the subject.
p39
aVThe great 20th-century geneticist,
p40
aVT.G. Dobzhansky,
p41
aVwho was also a communicant
p42
aVin the Russian Orthodox Church,
p43
aVonce wrote an essay that he titled
p44
aV"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense
p45
aVExcept in the Light of Evolution."
p46
aVNow if you are one of those
p47
aVwho does not accept the evidence for biological evolution,
p48
aVthis would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid,
p49
aVtake out your personal communications device \u2014
p50
aVI give you permission \u2014
p51
aVand perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong,
p52
aVbecause nothing in the rest of this talk
p53
aVis going to make any sense whatsoever to you.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVBut if you do accept
p56
aVbiological evolution,
p57
aVconsider this:
p58
aVis it just about the past,
p59
aVor is it about the future?
p60
aVDoes it apply to others,
p61
aVor does it apply to us?
p62
aa(lp63
VThis is another look at the tree of life.
p64
aVIn this picture,
p65
aVI've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions,
p66
aVbecause if you look at the edges
p67
aVof the tree of life,
p68
aVevery existing species
p69
aVat the tips of those branches
p70
aVhas succeeded in evolutionary terms:
p71
aVit has survived;
p72
aVit has demonstrated a fitness
p73
aVto its environment.
p74
aVThe human part of this branch,
p75
aVway out on one end,
p76
aVis, of course, the one that we are most interested in.
p77
aVWe branch off of a common ancestor
p78
aVto modern chimpanzees
p79
aVabout six or eight million years ago.
p80
aVIn the interval,
p81
aVthere have been perhaps 20 or 25
p82
aVdifferent species of hominids.
p83
aVSome have come and gone.
p84
aVWe have been here for about 130,000 years.
p85
aVIt may seem like we're quite remote
p86
aVfrom other parts of this tree of life,
p87
aVbut actually, for the most part,
p88
aVthe basic machinery of our cells
p89
aVis pretty much the same.
p90
aa(lp91
VDo you realize that we can take advantage
p92
aVand commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium
p93
aVto produce the protein of human insulin
p94
aVused to treat diabetics?
p95
aVThis is not like human insulin;
p96
aVthis is the same protein
p97
aVthat is chemically indistinguishable
p98
aVfrom what comes out of your pancreas.
p99
aVAnd speaking of bacteria,
p100
aVdo you realize that each of us carries in our gut
p101
aVmore bacteria
p102
aVthan there are cells in the rest of our body?
p103
aVMaybe 10 times more.
p104
aVI mean think of it,
p105
aVwhen Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,
p106
aVdo you think about the bacteria?
p107
aVOur gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment
p108
aVfor those bacteria.
p109
aVIt's warm, it's dark, it's moist,
p110
aVit's very cozy.
p111
aVAnd you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want
p112
aVwith no effort on their part.
p113
aVIt's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,
p114
aVwith the occasional interruption
p115
aVof the unintended forced rush to the exit.
p116
aVBut otherwise,
p117
aVyou are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,
p118
aVjust as they are essential to your life.
p119
aVThey help in the digestion of essential nutrients,
p120
aVand they protect you against certain diseases.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut what will come in the future?
p123
aVAre we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise
p124
aVas a species?
p125
aVOr, are we destined
p126
aVto become something different \u2014
p127
aVsomething, perhaps, even better adapted
p128
aVto the environment?
p129
aVNow let's take a step back in time
p130
aVto the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago \u2014
p131
aVthe Earth, the solar system,
p132
aVabout four and a half billion years \u2014
p133
aVthe first signs of proto-life,
p134
aVmaybe three to four billion years ago on Earth \u2014
p135
aVthe first multi-celled organisms,
p136
aVperhaps as much
p137
aVas 800 or a billion years ago \u2014
p138
aVand then the human species,
p139
aVfinally emerging
p140
aVin the last 130,000 years.
p141
aVIn this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,
p142
aVlife on Earth is like a brief measure;
p143
aVthe animal kingdom,
p144
aVlike a single measure;
p145
aVand human life,
p146
aVa small grace note.
p147
aVThat was us.
p148
aVThat also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,
p149
aVso I hope you enjoyed it.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VNow when I was a freshman in college,
p154
aVI took my first biology class.
p155
aVI was fascinated
p156
aVby the elegance and beauty of biology.
p157
aVI became enamored of the power of evolution,
p158
aVand I realized something very fundamental:
p159
aVin most of the existence of life
p160
aVin single-celled organisms,
p161
aVeach cell simply divides,
p162
aVand all of the genetic energy of that cell
p163
aVis carried on in both daughter cells.
p164
aVBut at the time multi-celled organisms come online,
p165
aVthings start to change.
p166
aVSexual reproduction enters the picture.
p167
aVAnd very importantly,
p168
aVwith the introduction of sexual reproduction
p169
aVthat passes on the genome,
p170
aVthe rest of the body
p171
aVbecomes expendable.
p172
aVIn fact, you could say
p173
aVthat the inevitability of the death of our bodies
p174
aVenters in evolutionary time
p175
aVat the same moment
p176
aVas sexual reproduction.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow I have to confess,
p179
aVwhen I was a college undergraduate,
p180
aVI thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex \u2014
p181
aVit seemed pretty reasonable at the time,
p182
aVbut with each passing year,
p183
aVI've come to have increasing doubts.
p184
aVI've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,
p185
aVwho was performing still in Las Vegas
p186
aVwell into his 90s.
p187
aVAnd one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.
p188
aVHe answers the door.
p189
aVStanding before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.
p190
aVShe looks at him and says,
p191
aV"I'm here for super sex."
p192
aV"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup."
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VI came to realize,
p197
aVas a physician,
p198
aVthat I was working toward a goal
p199
aVwhich was different from the goal of evolution \u2014
p200
aVnot necessarily contradictory, just different.
p201
aVI was trying to preserve the body.
p202
aVI wanted to keep us healthy.
p203
aVI wanted to restore health from disease.
p204
aVI wanted us to live long and healthy lives.
p205
aVEvolution is all about passing on the genome
p206
aVto the next generation,
p207
aVadapting and surviving
p208
aVthrough generation after generation.
p209
aVFrom an evolutionary point of view,
p210
aVyou and I are like the booster rockets
p211
aVdesigned to send the genetic payload
p212
aVinto the next level of orbit
p213
aVand then drop off into the sea.
p214
aVI think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed
p215
aVwhen he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
p216
aVI want to achieve it through not dying."
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VEvolution does not necessarily
p221
aVfavor the longest-lived.
p222
aVIt doesn't necessarily favor the biggest
p223
aVor the strongest or the fastest,
p224
aVand not even the smartest.
p225
aVEvolution favors
p226
aVthose creatures best adapted
p227
aVto their environment.
p228
aVThat is the sole test
p229
aVof survival and success.
p230
aVAt the bottom of the ocean,
p231
aVbacteria that are thermophilic
p232
aVand can survive at the steam vent heat
p233
aVthat would otherwise produce, if fish were there,
p234
aVsous-vide cooked fish,
p235
aVnevertheless, have managed
p236
aVto make that a hospitable environment for them.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo what does this mean,
p239
aVas we look back at what has happened in evolution,
p240
aVand as we think about the place again
p241
aVof humans in evolution,
p242
aVand particularly as we look ahead
p243
aVto the next phase,
p244
aVI would say
p245
aVthat there are a number of possibilities.
p246
aVThe first is that we will not evolve.
p247
aVWe have reached
p248
aVa kind of equipoise.
p249
aVAnd the reasoning behind that would be,
p250
aVfirst, we have, through medicine,
p251
aVmanaged to preserve a lot of genes
p252
aVthat would otherwise be selected out
p253
aVand be removed from the population.
p254
aVAnd secondly, we as a species
p255
aVhave so configured our environment
p256
aVthat we have managed to make it adapt to us
p257
aVas well as we adapt to it.
p258
aVAnd by the way, we immigrate and circulate
p259
aVand intermix so much
p260
aVthat you can't any longer
p261
aVhave the isolation that is necessary
p262
aVfor evolution to take place.
p263
aa(lp264
VA second possibility
p265
aVis that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,
p266
aVnatural, imposed by the forces of nature.
p267
aVAnd the argument here would be
p268
aVthat the wheels of evolution grind slowly,
p269
aVbut they are inexorable.
p270
aVAnd as far as isolation goes,
p271
aVwhen we as a species
p272
aVdo colonize distant planets,
p273
aVthere will be the isolation and the environmental changes
p274
aVthat could produce evolution
p275
aVin the natural way.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut there's a third possibility,
p278
aVan enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.
p279
aVI call it neo-evolution \u2014
p280
aVthe new evolution
p281
aVthat is not simply natural,
p282
aVbut guided and chosen
p283
aVby us as individuals
p284
aVin the choices that we will make.
p285
aVNow how could this come about?
p286
aVHow could it be possible that we would do this?
p287
aVConsider, first, the reality
p288
aVthat people today, in some cultures,
p289
aVare making choices about their offspring.
p290
aVThey're, in some cultures,
p291
aVchoosing to have more males than females.
p292
aVIt's not necessarily good for the society,
p293
aVbut it's what the individual and the family are choosing.
p294
aa(lp295
VThink also,
p296
aVif it were possible ever
p297
aVfor you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,
p298
aVbut for you in your body
p299
aVto make the genetic adjustments
p300
aVthat would cure or prevent diseases.
p301
aVWhat if you could make the genetic changes
p302
aVto eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's
p303
aVor reduce the risk of cancer
p304
aVor eliminate stroke?
p305
aVWouldn't you want
p306
aVto make those changes
p307
aVin your genes?
p308
aVIf we look ahead,
p309
aVthese kind of changes
p310
aVare going to be increasingly possible.
p311
aa(lp312
VThe Human Genome Project
p313
aVstarted in 1990,
p314
aVand it took 13 years.
p315
aVIt cost 2.7 billion dollars.
p316
aVThe year after it was finished in 2004,
p317
aVyou could do the same job
p318
aVfor 20 million dollars in three to four months.
p319
aVToday, you can have a complete sequence
p320
aVof the three billion base pairs in the human genome
p321
aVat a cost of about 20,000 dollars
p322
aVand in the space of about a week.
p323
aVIt won't be very long
p324
aVbefore the reality will be
p325
aVthe 1,000-dollar human genome,
p326
aVand it will be increasingly available for everyone.
p327
aVJust a week ago,
p328
aVthe National Academy of Engineering
p329
aVawarded its Draper Prize
p330
aVto Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer,
p331
aVtwo scientists who independently developed techniques
p332
aVto encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster
p333
aVand to lead to desirable proteins
p334
aVin a more efficient way \u2014
p335
aVwhat Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution."
p336
aVA couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize
p337
aVwas awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka
p338
aVfor his research
p339
aVin which he took an adult skin cell,
p340
aVa fibroblast,
p341
aVand by manipulating just four genes,
p342
aVhe induced that cell
p343
aVto revert to a pluripotential stem cell \u2014
p344
aVa cell potentially capable
p345
aVof becoming any cell in your body.
p346
aa(lp347
VThese changes are coming.
p348
aVThe same technology
p349
aVthat has produced the human insulin in bacteria
p350
aVcan make viruses
p351
aVthat will not only protect you against themselves,
p352
aVbut induce immunity against other viruses.
p353
aVBelieve it or not,
p354
aVthere's an experimental trial going on
p355
aVwith vaccine against influenza
p356
aVthat has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.
p357
aVCan you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?
p358
aa(lp359
VThese are all reality today,
p360
aVand [in] the future, will be evermore possible.
p361
aVImagine then
p362
aVjust two other little changes.
p363
aVYou can change the cells in your body,
p364
aVbut what if you could change the cells in your offspring?
p365
aVWhat if you could change the sperm and the ova,
p366
aVor change the newly fertilized egg,
p367
aVand give your offspring a better chance
p368
aVat a healthier life \u2014
p369
aVeliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,
p370
aVreduce the risk of cancer?
p371
aVWho doesn't want healthier children?
p372
aVAnd then, that same analytic technology,
p373
aVthat same engine of science
p374
aVthat can produce
p375
aVthe changes to prevent disease,
p376
aVwill also enable us
p377
aVto adopt super-attributes,
p378
aVhyper-capacities \u2014
p379
aVthat better memory.
p380
aVWhy not have the quick wit
p381
aVof a Ken Jennings,
p382
aVespecially if you can augment it
p383
aVwith the next generation of the Watson machine?
p384
aVWhy not have the quick twitch muscle
p385
aVthat will enable you to run faster and longer?
p386
aVWhy not live longer?
p387
aVThese will be irresistible.
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd when we are at a position
p390
aVwhere we can pass it on to the next generation,
p391
aVand we can adopt the attributes we want,
p392
aVwe will have converted
p393
aVold-style evolution
p394
aVinto neo-evolution.
p395
aVWe'll take a process
p396
aVthat normally might require 100,000 years,
p397
aVand we can compress it down to a thousand years \u2014
p398
aVand maybe even in the next 100 years.
p399
aVThese are choices
p400
aVthat your grandchildren,
p401
aVor their grandchildren,
p402
aVare going to have before them.
p403
aVWill we use these choices
p404
aVto make a society that is better,
p405
aVthat is more successful, that is kinder?
p406
aVOr, will we selectively choose different attributes
p407
aVthat we want for some of us
p408
aVand not for others of us?
p409
aVWill we make a society
p410
aVthat is more boring and more uniform,
p411
aVor more robust and more versatile?
p412
aVThese are the kinds of questions
p413
aVthat we will have to face.
p414
aa(lp415
VAnd most profoundly of all,
p416
aVwill we ever be able to develop the wisdom,
p417
aVand to inherit the wisdom,
p418
aVthat we'll need to make these choices wisely?
p419
aVFor better or worse,
p420
aVand sooner than you may think,
p421
aVthese choices will be up to us.

How do we decide which treatment to use in a tricky case -- both individually and as a community? Is it fair that the richest hospitals get the best healthcare? Who should bear the risk (and gain the reward) of trying the newest treatments?<br /><br />Fineberg helped found and served as president of the Society for Medical Decision Making and also served as consultant to the World Health Organization.

VTen years ago, on a Tuesday morning,
p5
aVI conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
p6
aVIt was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done
p7
aVsince I became a paratrooper
p8
aV27 years before.
p9
aVWe went down to the airfield early
p10
aVbecause this is the Army and you always go early.
p11
aVYou do some routine refresher training,
p12
aVand then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.
p13
aVAnd you put on the T-10 parachute.
p14
aVAnd you're very careful how you put the straps,
p15
aVparticularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.
p16
aVAnd then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.
p17
aVAnd then a jumpmaster comes,
p18
aVand he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.
p19
aVHe checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps
p20
aVand he tightens everything
p21
aVso that your chest is crushed,
p22
aVyour shoulders are crushed down,
p23
aVand, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.
p24
aVThen you sit down, and you wait a little while,
p25
aVbecause this is the Army.
p26
aVThen you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on,
p27
aVand you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people,
p28
aVand you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.
p29
aVAnd you wait a little bit longer,
p30
aVbecause this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.
p31
aa(lp32
VThen you take off.
p33
aVAnd it's painful enough now \u2014
p34
aVand I think it's designed this way \u2014
p35
aVit's painful enough so you want to jump.
p36
aVYou didn't really want to jump, but you want out.
p37
aVSo you get in the aircraft, you're flying along,
p38
aVand at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.
p39
aVThey give 20 minutes \u2014 that's a time warning.
p40
aVYou sit there, OK.
p41
aVThen they give you 10 minutes.
p42
aVAnd of course, you're responding with all of these.
p43
aVAnd that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.
p44
aVThen they give you, "Get ready."
p45
aVThen they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up."
p46
aVIf you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up.
p47
aVIf you're an inboard personnel, stand up.
p48
aVAnd then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.
p49
aVAnd at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what?
p50
aVI'm probably going to jump.
p51
aVThere's no way to get out of this at this point."
p52
aVYou go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd this was that Tuesday morning in September,
p55
aVand it was pretty nice outside.
p56
aVSo nice air comes flowing in.
p57
aVThe jumpmasters start to check the door.
p58
aVAnd then when it's time to go,
p59
aVa green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go."
p60
aVThe first guy goes, and you're just in line,
p61
aVand you just kind of lumber to the door.
p62
aVJump is a misnomer; you fall.
p63
aVYou fall outside the door,
p64
aVyou're caught in the slipstream.
p65
aVThe first thing you do is lock into a tight body position \u2014
p66
aVhead down in your chest, your arms extended,
p67
aVput over your reserve parachute.
p68
aVYou do that because, 27 years before,
p69
aVan airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.
p70
aVI have no idea whether it makes any difference,
p71
aVbut he seemed to make sense,
p72
aVand I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.
p73
aVAnd then you wait for the opening shock
p74
aVfor your parachute to open.
p75
aVIf you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute \u2014
p76
aVyou've got a whole new problem set.
p77
aVBut typically you do; typically it opens.
p78
aVAnd of course, if your leg straps aren't set right,
p79
aVat that point you get another little thrill.
p80
aVBoom.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo then you look around,
p83
aVyou're under a canopy and you say, "This is good."
p84
aVNow you prepare for the inevitable.
p85
aVYou are going to hit the ground.
p86
aVYou can't delay that much.
p87
aVAnd you really can't decide where you hit very much,
p88
aVbecause they pretend you can steer,
p89
aVbut you're being delivered.
p90
aVSo you look around, where you're going to land,
p91
aVyou try to make yourself ready.
p92
aVAnd then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line,
p93
aVso that it's not on you when you land,
p94
aVand you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.
p95
aVNow the Army teaches you
p96
aVto do five points of performance \u2014
p97
aVthe toes of your feet,
p98
aVyour calves, your thighs,
p99
aVyour buttocks and your push-up muscles.
p100
aVIt's this elegant little land, twist and roll.
p101
aVAnd that's not going to hurt.
p102
aVIn 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVI always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd as soon as I hit,
p109
aVthe first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.
p110
aVI'd shake my head,
p111
aVand I'd ask myself the eternal question:
p112
aV"Why didn't I go into banking?"
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVAnd I'd look around,
p115
aVand then I'd see another paratrooper,
p116
aVa young guy or girl,
p117
aVand they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine
p118
aVand they'd be picking up their equipment.
p119
aVThey'd be doing everything
p120
aVthat we had taught them.
p121
aVAnd I realized
p122
aVthat, if they had to go into combat,
p123
aVthey would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.
p124
aVAnd I realized that, if they came out of combat,
p125
aVit would be because we led them well.
p126
aVAnd I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo now I do that Tuesday morning jump,
p129
aVbut it's not any jump \u2014
p130
aVthat was September 11th, 2001.
p131
aVAnd when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.
p132
aVWhen we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.
p133
aVAnd what we thought
p134
aVabout the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat
p135
aVas being theoretical
p136
aVwas now very, very real \u2014
p137
aVand leadership seemed important.
p138
aVBut things had changed;
p139
aVI was a 46-year-old brigadier general.
p140
aVI'd been successful,
p141
aVbut things changed so much
p142
aVthat I was going to have to make some significant changes,
p143
aVand on that morning, I didn't know it.
p144
aa(lp145
VI was raised with traditional stories of leadership:
p146
aVRobert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.
p147
aVAnd I also was raised
p148
aVwith personal examples of leadership.
p149
aVThis was my father in Vietnam.
p150
aVAnd I was raised to believe
p151
aVthat soldiers were strong and wise
p152
aVand brave and faithful;
p153
aVthey didn't lie, cheat, steal
p154
aVor abandon their comrades.
p155
aVAnd I still believe real leaders are like that.
p156
aVBut in my first 25 years of career,
p157
aVI had a bunch of different experiences.
p158
aa(lp159
VOne of my first battalion commanders,
p160
aVI worked in his battalion for 18 months
p161
aVand the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal
p162
aVwas at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march,
p163
aVand he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.
p164
aVAnd I'm not sure that was real interaction.
p165
aVBut then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander,
p166
aVI went out to the National Training Center.
p167
aVAnd we did an operation,
p168
aVand my company did a dawn attack \u2014
p169
aVyou know, the classic dawn attack:
p170
aVyou prepare all night, move to the line of departure.
p171
aVAnd I had an armored organization at that point.
p172
aVWe move forward, and we get wiped out \u2014
p173
aVI mean, wiped out immediately.
p174
aVThe enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.
p175
aVAnd after the battle,
p176
aVthey bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review"
p177
aVto teach you what you've done wrong.
p178
aVSort of leadership by humiliation.
p179
aVThey put a big screen up, and they take you through everything:
p180
aV"and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc."
p181
aVI walked out feeling as low
p182
aVas a snake's belly in a wagon rut.
p183
aVAnd I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.
p184
aVAnd I went up to apologize to him,
p185
aVand he said, "Stanley, I thought you did great."
p186
aVAnd in one sentence,
p187
aVhe lifted me, put me back on my feet,
p188
aVand taught me that leaders can let you fail
p189
aVand yet not let you be a failure.
p190
aa(lp191
VWhen 9/11 came,
p192
aV46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.
p193
aVFirst, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with:
p194
aVthe environment changed \u2014
p195
aVthe speed, the scrutiny,
p196
aVthe sensitivity of everything now is so fast,
p197
aVsometimes it evolves faster
p198
aVthan people have time to really reflect on it.
p199
aVBut everything we do
p200
aVis in a different context.
p201
aVMore importantly, the force that I led
p202
aVwas spread over more than 20 countries.
p203
aVAnd instead of being able to get all the key leaders
p204
aVfor a decision together in a single room
p205
aVand look them in the eye and build their confidence
p206
aVand get trust from them,
p207
aVI'm now leading a force that's dispersed,
p208
aVand I've got to use other techniques.
p209
aVI've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat,
p210
aVI've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls \u2014
p211
aVI've got to use everything I can,
p212
aVnot just for communication,
p213
aVbut for leadership.
p214
aVA 22-year-old individual
p215
aVoperating alone,
p216
aVthousands of miles from me,
p217
aVhas got to communicate to me with confidence.
p218
aVI have to have trust in them and vice versa.
p219
aVAnd I also have to build their faith.
p220
aVAnd that's a new kind of leadership
p221
aVfor me.
p222
aa(lp223
VWe had one operation
p224
aVwhere we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.
p225
aVAn emerging opportunity came \u2014
p226
aVdidn't have time to get everybody together.
p227
aVSo we had to get complex intelligence together,
p228
aVwe had to line up the ability to act.
p229
aVIt was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command,
p230
aVconvince them that this was the right thing to do
p231
aVand do all of this
p232
aVon electronic medium.
p233
aVWe failed.
p234
aVThe mission didn't work.
p235
aVAnd so now what we had to do
p236
aVis I had to reach out
p237
aVto try to rebuild the trust of that force,
p238
aVrebuild their confidence \u2014
p239
aVme and them, and them and me,
p240
aVand our seniors and us as a force \u2014
p241
aVall without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.
p242
aVEntirely new requirement.
p243
aa(lp244
VAlso, the people had changed.
p245
aVYou probably think that the force that I led
p246
aVwas all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists
p247
aVcarrying exotic weapons.
p248
aVIn reality,
p249
aVmuch of the force I led
p250
aVlooked exactly like you.
p251
aVIt was men, women, young, old \u2014
p252
aVnot just from military; from different organizations,
p253
aVmany of them detailed to us just from a handshake.
p254
aVAnd so instead of giving orders,
p255
aVyou're now building consensus
p256
aVand you're building a sense of shared purpose.
p257
aVProbably the biggest change
p258
aVwas understanding that the generational difference,
p259
aVthe ages, had changed so much.
p260
aVI went down to be with a Ranger platoon
p261
aVon an operation in Afghanistan,
p262
aVand on that operation,
p263
aVa sergeant in the platoon
p264
aVhad lost about half his arm
p265
aVthrowing a Taliban hand grenade
p266
aVback at the enemy
p267
aVafter it had landed in his fire team.
p268
aVWe talked about the operation,
p269
aVand then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.
p270
aVI asked, "Where were you on 9/11?"
p271
aVAnd one young Ranger in the back \u2014
p272
aVhis hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown
p273
aVfrom being in combat in the cold Afghan wind \u2014
p274
aVhe said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade."
p275
aVAnd it reminded me
p276
aVthat we're operating a force
p277
aVthat must have shared purpose
p278
aVand shared consciousness,
p279
aVand yet he has different experiences,
p280
aVin many cases a different vocabulary,
p281
aVa completely different skill set
p282
aVin terms of digital media
p283
aVthan I do and many of the other senior leaders.
p284
aVAnd yet, we need to have that shared sense.
p285
aa(lp286
VIt also produced something
p287
aVwhich I call an inversion of expertise,
p288
aVbecause we had so many changes at the lower levels
p289
aVin technology and tactics and whatnot,
p290
aVthat suddenly the things that we grew up doing
p291
aVwasn't what the force was doing anymore.
p292
aVSo how does a leader
p293
aVstay credible and legitimate
p294
aVwhen they haven't done
p295
aVwhat the people you're leading are doing?
p296
aVAnd it's a brand new leadership challenge.
p297
aVAnd it forced me to become a lot more transparent,
p298
aVa lot more willing to listen,
p299
aVa lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.
p300
aVAnd yet, again, you're not all in one room.
p301
aVThen another thing.
p302
aVThere's an effect on you and on your leaders.
p303
aVThere's an impact, it's cumulative.
p304
aVYou don't reset, or recharge your battery every time.
p305
aa(lp306
VI stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq
p307
aVwith one of my senior officers
p308
aVand we watched a firefight from one of our forces.
p309
aVAnd I remembered his son was in our force.
p310
aVAnd I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?"
p311
aVAnd he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking."
p312
aVI said, "Where is he now?"
p313
aVAnd he pointed at the screen, he said, "He's in that firefight."
p314
aVThink about watching your brother, father,
p315
aVdaughter, son, wife
p316
aVin a firefight in real time
p317
aVand you can't do anything about it.
p318
aVThink about knowing that over time.
p319
aVAnd it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd you have to watch and take care of each other.
p322
aVI probably learned the most about relationships.
p323
aVI learned they are the sinew
p324
aVwhich hold the force together.
p325
aVI grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.
p326
aVAnd every morning in the Ranger regiment,
p327
aVevery Ranger \u2014 and there are more than 2,000 of them \u2014
p328
aVsays a six-stanza Ranger creed.
p329
aVYou may know one line of it, it says,
p330
aV"I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy."
p331
aVAnd it's not a mindless mantra,
p332
aVand it's not a poem.
p333
aVIt's a promise.
p334
aVEvery Ranger promises every other Ranger,
p335
aV"No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me,
p336
aVif you need me, I'm coming."
p337
aVAnd every Ranger gets that same promise
p338
aVfrom every other Ranger.
p339
aVThink about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.
p340
aVIt's probably more powerful than marriage vows.
p341
aVAnd they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.
p342
aVAnd so the organizational relationship that bonds them
p343
aVis just amazing.
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd I learned personal relationships
p346
aVwere more important than ever.
p347
aVWe were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007,
p348
aVand an old friend of mine,
p349
aVthat I had spent many years
p350
aVat various points of my career with \u2014
p351
aVgodfather to one of their kids \u2014
p352
aVhe sent me a note, just in an envelope,
p353
aVthat had a quote from Sherman to Grant
p354
aVthat said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot,
p355
aVthat you would come, if alive."
p356
aVAnd having that kind of relationship, for me,
p357
aVturned out to be critical at many points in my career.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd I learned that you have to give that
p360
aVin this environment,
p361
aVbecause it's tough.
p362
aVThat was my journey.
p363
aVI hope it's not over.
p364
aVI came to believe
p365
aVthat a leader isn't good because they're right;
p366
aVthey're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.
p367
aVThis isn't easy stuff.
p368
aVIt's not like that electronic abs machine
p369
aVwhere, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.
p370
aV(Laughter)
p371
aVAnd it isn't always fair.
p372
aVYou can get knocked down,
p373
aVand it hurts
p374
aVand it leaves scars.
p375
aVBut if you're a leader,
p376
aVthe people you've counted on
p377
aVwill help you up.
p378
aVAnd if you're a leader,
p379
aVthe people who count on you need you on your feet.
p380
aa(lp381
VThank you.
p382

A four-star general, he is the former commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan and the former leader of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), which oversees the military&rsquo;s most sensitive forces. McChrystal&rsquo;s leadership of JSOC is credited with the December 2003 capture of Saddam Hussein and the June 2006 location and killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. McChrystal, a former Green Beret, is known for his candor.<br /><br />After McChrystal graduated from West Point, he was commissioned as an infantry officer, and spent much of his career commanding special operations and airborne infantry units. During the Persian Gulf War, McChrystal served in a Joint Special Operations Task Force and later commanded the 75th Ranger Regiment. He completed year-long fellowships at Harvard&rsquo;s John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1997 and in 2000 at the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2002, he was appointed chief of staff of military operations in Afghanistan. Two years later, McChrystal was selected to deliver nationally televised Pentagon briefings about military operations in Iraq. From 2003 to 2008, McChrystal commanded JSOC and was responsible for leading the nation&rsquo;s deployed military counter-terrorism efforts around the globe. He assumed command of all International Forces in Afghanistan in June 2009. President Obama&rsquo;s order for an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan was based on McChrystal&rsquo;s assessment of the war there. McChrystal retired from the military in August 2010. </p>", "slug": "stanley_mcchrystal", "whotheyare": "General Stanley McChrystal is the former commander of U.S. and International forces in Afghanistan.

VSo I think data can actually make us more human.
p5
aVWe're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives,
p6
aVand it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories.
p7
aVRecently, a wise media theorist Tweeted,
p8
aV"The 19th century culture was defined by the novel,
p9
aVthe 20th century culture was defined by the cinema,
p10
aVand the culture of the 21st century
p11
aVwill be defined by the interface."
p12
aVAnd I believe this is going to prove true.
p13
aVOur lives are being driven by data,
p14
aVand the presentation of that data is an opportunity
p15
aVfor us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories.
p16
aVSo I'm going to show you a few of the projects
p17
aVthat I've been working on over the last couple years
p18
aVthat reflect on our lives and our systems.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis is a project called Flight Patterns.
p21
aVWhat you're looking at is airplane traffic
p22
aVover North America for a 24-hour period.
p23
aVAs you see, everything starts to fade to black,
p24
aVand you see people going to sleep.
p25
aVFollowed by that, you see on the West coast
p26
aVplanes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast.
p27
aVAnd you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast,
p28
aVfollowed by European flights coming in the upper right-hand corner.
p29
aVEverybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast.
p30
aVYou see San Francisco and Los Angeles
p31
aVstart to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner.
p32
aa(lp33
VI think it's one thing to say there's 140,000 planes
p34
aVbeing monitored by the federal government at any one time,
p35
aVand it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows.
p36
aVThis is a time-lapse image of that exact same data,
p37
aVbut I've color-coded it by type,
p38
aVso you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us.
p39
aVAnd I started making these, and I put them into Google Maps
p40
aVand allow you to zoom in and see individual airports
p41
aVand the patterns that are occurring there.
p42
aVSo here we can see the white represents low altitudes,
p43
aVand the blue are higher altitudes.
p44
aVAnd you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta.
p45
aVYou can see this is a major shipping airport,
p46
aVand there's all kinds of activity there.
p47
aVYou can also toggle between altitude
p48
aVfor model and manufacturer.
p49
aVSee again, the diversity.
p50
aVAnd you can scroll around and see
p51
aVsome of the different airports and the different patterns that they have.
p52
aVThis is scrolling up the East coast.
p53
aVYou can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York
p54
aVwith the air traffic controllers
p55
aVhaving to deal with all those major airports next to each other.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo zooming back out real quick,
p58
aVwe see, again, the U.S. \u2014 you get Florida down in the right-hand corner.
p59
aVMoving across to the West coast,
p60
aVyou see San Francisco and Los Angeles \u2014
p61
aVbig low-traffic zones
p62
aVacross Nevada and Arizona.
p63
aVAnd that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom.
p64
aVI started taking a look as well at different perimeters,
p65
aVbecause you can choose what you want to pull out from the data.
p66
aVThis is looking at ascending versus descending flights.
p67
aVAnd you can see, over time, the ways the airports change.
p68
aVYou see the holding patterns that start to develop
p69
aVin the bottom of the screen.
p70
aVAnd you can see, eventually the airport actually flips directions.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT.
p73
aVThis is visualizing international communications.
p74
aVSo it's how New York communicates
p75
aVwith other international cities.
p76
aVAnd we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York
p77
aVfor the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition.
p78
aVAnd it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset,
p79
aVso you could see the changing relationship
p80
aVand some demographic info
p81
aVcoming through AT&T's data and revealing itself.
p82
aVThis is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab
p83
aVand CurrentCity.org.
p84
aVAnd it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam.
p85
aVSo you're seeing the daily ebb and flow
p86
aVof people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city,
p87
aVuntil we approach New Year's Eve, where everybody says, "Happy New Year!"
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VSo this is an interactive tool
p92
aVthat you can move around and see different parts of the city.
p93
aVThis is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day.
p94
aVSo again, you get this daily ebb and flow
p95
aVof people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city.
p96
aVAnd then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city
p97
aVto celebrate the night before,
p98
aVwhich happens right here.
p99
aVAnd then you can see people celebrating the next day.
p100
aVAnd you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo now on to something completely different.
p103
aVSome of you may recognize this.
p104
aVThis is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine.
p105
aVAnd it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well,
p106
aVexcept for one thing: it's not a robot at all.
p107
aVThere's actually a legless man that sits in that box
p108
aVand controls this chess player.
p109
aVThis was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon
p110
aVcalled the Mechanical Turk \u2014 named after this guy.
p111
aVAnd it's based on the premise that there are certain things
p112
aVthat are easy for people, but really difficult for computers.
p113
aVSo they made this web service and said,
p114
aV"Any programmer can write a piece of software
p115
aVand tap into the minds of thousands of people."
p116
aVThe nerdy side of me thought, "Wow, this is amazing.
p117
aVI can tap into thousands of people's minds."
p118
aVAnd the other nerdy side of me thought,
p119
aV"This is horrible. This is completely bizarre.
p120
aVWhat does this mean for the future of mankind,
p121
aVwhere we're all plugged into this borg?"
p122
aVI was probably being a little extreme.
p123
aVBut what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on,
p124
aVand we're just doing these little labors?
p125
aa(lp126
VSo I created this drawing tool.
p127
aVI asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left.
p128
aVAnd I said, "I'll pay you two cents for your contribution."
p129
aVAnd I started collecting sheep.
p130
aVAnd I collected a lot, a lot of different sheep.
p131
aVLots of sheep.
p132
aVI took the first 10,000 sheep that I collected,
p133
aVand I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com
p134
aVwhere you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep.
p135
aVYou can't pick individual sheep,
p136
aVbut you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity.
p137
aVAnd juxtaposed against this grid,
p138
aVyou see actually, by rolling over each individual one,
p139
aVthe humanity behind this hugely mechanical process.
p140
aVI think there's something really interesting
p141
aVto watching people as they go through this creative toil \u2014
p142
aVsomething we can all relate to,
p143
aVthis creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing.
p144
aVI think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity
p145
aVversus this massive distributed grid.
p146
aVKind of amazing what some people did.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo here's a few statistics from the project.
p149
aVApproximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour,
p150
aVwhich would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour.
p151
aVThere were 662 rejected sheep
p152
aVthat didn't meet "sheep-like" criteria and were thrown out of the flock.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVThe amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes.
p155
aVThat gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication.
p156
aVAnd there were 7,599 people that contributed to the project,
p157
aVor were unique IP addresses \u2014
p158
aVso about how many people contributed.
p159
aVBut only one of them out of the 7,599 said this.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVWhich I was pretty surprised by.
p162
aVI expected people to be wondering, "Why did I draw a sheep?"
p163
aVAnd I think it's a pretty valid question.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep.
p166
aVSheep were the first animal
p167
aVto be raised from mechanically processed byproducts,
p168
aVthe first to be selectively bred for production traits,
p169
aVthe first animal to be cloned.
p170
aVObviously, we think of sheep as followers.
p171
aVAnd there's this reference to "Le Petit Prince"
p172
aVwhere the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep.
p173
aVHe draws sheep after sheep.
p174
aVThe narrator's only appeased when he draws a box.
p175
aVAnd he says, "It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep.
p176
aVIt's about your own interpretation and doing something different."
p177
aVAnd I like that.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times."
p180
aVIt's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes
p181
aVduring the Industrial Revolution.
p182
aVSo there were no longer shoe makers,
p183
aVbut now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes.
p184
aVAnd the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot.
p185
aVSo I thought this was an interesting clip
p186
aVto divide into 16 pieces
p187
aVand feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool.
p188
aVThis basically allowed \u2014 what you see on the left side is the original frame,
p189
aVand on the right side you see that frame
p190
aVas interpreted by 16 people
p191
aVwho have no idea what it is they're doing.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd this was the inspiration for a project
p194
aVthat I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima.
p195
aVWe decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for,
p196
aVwhich is making money.
p197
aVSo we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces,
p198
aVand we fed those into the Mechanical Turk.
p199
aVWe asked people to draw what it was that they saw.
p200
aVBut here there was no sheep-like criteria.
p201
aVPeople, if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face,
p202
aVit actually made it into the bill.
p203
aVSo what you see is actually a representation of how well people did
p204
aVwhat it was they were asked to do.
p205
aVSo we took these hundred dollar bills,
p206
aVand we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com,
p207
aVwhere you can browse through and see all the individual contributions.
p208
aVAnd you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills
p209
aVand make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project,
p210
aVwhich is now known as One Laptop Per Child.
p211
aVThis is again showing all the different contributions.
p212
aVYou see some people did beautiful stipple renderings,
p213
aVlike this one on top \u2014
p214
aVspent a long time making realistic versions.
p215
aVAnd other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces.
p216
aVHere on the right-hand side in the middle
p217
aVyou see this one guy writing, "$0.01!!! Really?"
p218
aVThat's all I'm getting paid for this?
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VSo the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about
p223
aVis called Bicycle Built for 2000.
p224
aVThis is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey.
p225
aVYou may recognize these two guys.
p226
aVThis is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '60s,
p227
aVwhere they created the song "Daisy Bell,"
p228
aVwhich was the world's first singing computer.
p229
aVYou may recognize it from "2001: A Space Odyssey."
p230
aVWhen HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song,
p231
aVas a reference to when computers became human.
p232
aVSo we resynthesized this song.
p233
aVThis is what that sounded like.
p234
aVWe broke down all the individual notes
p235
aVin the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing.
p236
aa(lp237
VDaisy Bell: \u266b Daisy, Daisy ... \u266b
p238
aa(lp239
VAaron Koblin: And we took all of those individual pieces,
p240
aVand we fed them into another Turk request.
p241
aVThis is what it would look like if you went to the site.
p242
aVYou type in your code,
p243
aVbut you first test your mic.
p244
aVYou'd be fed a simple audio clip.
p245
aV(Honk)
p246
aVAnd then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice.
p247
aVAfter previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted,
p248
aVyou could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context.
p249
aVAnd this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions.
p250
aa(lp251
VRecording: \u266b Daisy, Daisy \u266b
p252
aV\u266b give me your answer do \u266b
p253
aV\u266b I'm half crazy \u266b
p254
aV\u266b all for the love of you \u266b
p255
aV\u266b It can't be a stylish marriage \u266b
p256
aV\u266b I can't afford a carriage \u266b
p257
aV\u266b But you'll look sweet upon the seat \u266b
p258
aV\u266b of a bicycle built for two \u266b
p259
aa(lp260
VAK: So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds,
p261
aVthat says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual.
p262
aVWe wanted to see how this applies to collaborative, distributed music making,
p263
aVwhere nobody has any idea what it is they're working on.
p264
aVSo if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com
p265
aVyou can actually hear what all this sounds like together.
p266
aVI'm sorry for this.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Noise)
p269
aa(lp270
VChorus: \u266b Daisy, Daisy \u266b
p271
aV\u266b Give me your answer do \u266b
p272
aV\u266b I'm half crazy \u266b
p273
aV\u266b all for the love of you \u266b
p274
aV\u266b It can't be a stylish marriage \u266b
p275
aV\u266b I can't afford a carriage \u266b
p276
aV\u266b But you'd look sweet upon the seat \u266b
p277
aV\u266b of a bicycle built for two \u266b
p278
aa(lp279
VAK: So stepping back for a quick second,
p280
aVwhen I was at UCLA going to grad school,
p281
aVI was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing.
p282
aVAnd I was writing software to visualize laser scanners.
p283
aVSo basically motion through 3D space.
p284
aVAnd this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost
p285
aVwho said, "Wait a minute.
p286
aVYou mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video?"
p287
aVSo we did exactly that.
p288
aVWe made a music video for one of my favorite bands, Radiohead.
p289
aVAnd I think one of my favorite parts of this project
p290
aVwas not just shooting a video with lasers,
p291
aVbut we also open sourced it,
p292
aVand we made it released as a Google Code project,
p293
aVwhere people could download a bunch of the data and some source code
p294
aVto build their own versions of it.
p295
aVAnd people were making some amazing things.
p296
aVThis is actually two of my favorites:
p297
aVthe pin-board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke.
p298
aVA whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content.
p299
aVMore recently, somebody even 3D-printed Thom Yorke's head,
p300
aVwhich is a little creepy, but pretty cool.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo with everybody making so much amazing stuff
p303
aVand actually understanding what it was they were working on,
p304
aVI was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project
p305
aVwhere people were working together to build something.
p306
aVAnd I met a music video director named Chris Milk.
p307
aVAnd we started bouncing around ideas
p308
aVto make a collaborative music video project.
p309
aVBut we knew we really needed the right person
p310
aVto kind of rally behind and build something for.
p311
aVSo we put the idea on the back burner for a few months.
p312
aVAnd he ended up talking to Rick Rubin,
p313
aVwho was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album
p314
aVcalled "Ain't No Grave."
p315
aVThe lyrics to the leading track are "Ain't no grave can hold my body down."
p316
aVSo we thought this was the perfect
p317
aVproject to build a collaborative memorial
p318
aVand a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello, also known as Mr. doob,
p321
aVwho's a much better programmer than I am,
p322
aVand he made this amazing Flash drawing tool.
p323
aVAs you know,
p324
aVan animation is a series of images.
p325
aVSo what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash,
p326
aVand at eight frames a second,
p327
aVwe allowed individuals to draw a single frame
p328
aVthat would get woven into
p329
aVthis dynamically changing music video.
p330
aVSo I don't have time to play the entire thing for you,
p331
aVbut I want to show you two short clips.
p332
aVOne is the beginning of the music video.
p333
aVAnd that's going to be followed by a short clip
p334
aVof people who have already contributed to the project
p335
aVtalking about it briefly.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Music)
p338
aa(lp339
V(Video) Johnny Cash: \u266b There ain't no grave \u266b
p340
aV\u266b can hold my body down \u266b
p341
aV\u266b There ain't no grave \u266b
p342
aV\u266b can hold body down \u266b
p343
aV\u266b When I hear the trumpet sound \u266b
p344
aV\u266b I'm going to ride right out of the ground \u266b
p345
aV\u266b Ain't no grave \u266b
p346
aV\u266b can hold my body ... \u266b
p347
aa(lp348
V(Applause)
p349
aa(lp350
VAK: What better way to pay tribute to the man
p351
aVthan to make something for one of his songs.
p352
aa(lp353
VCollaborator: I felt really sad when he died.
p354
aVAnd I just thought it'd be wonderful,
p355
aVit'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory.
p356
aa(lp357
VCollaborator Two: It really allows
p358
aVthis last recording of his
p359
aVto be a living, breathing memorial.
p360
aa(lp361
VCollaborator Three: For all of the frames to be drawn by fans,
p362
aVeach individual frame,
p363
aVit's got a very powerful feeling to it.
p364
aa(lp365
VCollaborator Four: I've seen everybody
p366
aVfrom Japan, Venezuela, to the States,
p367
aVto Knoxville, Tennessee.
p368
aa(lp369
VCollaborator Five: As much as is different from frame to frame,
p370
aVit really is personal.
p371
aVCollaborator Six: Watching the video in my room,
p372
aVI could see me not understanding at the beginning of it.
p373
aVAnd I just worked and worked through problems,
p374
aVuntil my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture
p375
aVall began to resolve themselves.
p376
aVYou can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing,
p377
aVand a lot of light and dark comes into it.
p378
aVAnd in a weird way,
p379
aVthat's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well.
p380
aVIt's the sum total of his life,
p381
aVall the things that had happened \u2014
p382
aVthe bad things, the good things.
p383
aVYou're hearing a person's life.
p384
aa(lp385
VAK: So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com,
p386
aVwhat you'll see is the video playing above.
p387
aVAnd below it are all the individual frames
p388
aVthat people have been submitting to the project.
p389
aVSo this isn't finished at all,
p390
aVbut it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate.
p391
aVIf you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails,
p392
aVyou can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail
p393
aVand where they were located.
p394
aVAnd if you find one that you're interested in,
p395
aVyou can actually click on it and open up an information panel
p396
aVwhere you're able to rate that frame,
p397
aVwhich helps it bubble up to the top.
p398
aVAnd you can also see the way that it was drawn.
p399
aVAgain, you can get the playback and personal contribution.
p400
aVIn addition to that, it's listed, the artist's name, the location,
p401
aVhow long they spent drawing it.
p402
aVAnd you can pick a style. So this one was tagged "Abstract."
p403
aVBut there's a bunch of different styles.
p404
aVAnd you can sort the video a number of different ways.
p405
aVYou can say, "I want to see the pointillist version
p406
aVor the sketchy version or the realistic version.
p407
aVAnd then this is, again, the abstract version,
p408
aVwhich ends up getting a little bit crazy.
p409
aa(lp410
VSo the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk.
p411
aVAnd this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."
p412
aVIt's an online music video for the Arcade Fire.
p413
aVChris and I were really amazed
p414
aVby the potential now with modern web browsers,
p415
aVwhere you have HTML5 audio and video
p416
aVand the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast.
p417
aVAnd we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web
p418

aVand try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen.
p420
aVBut most importantly, I think,
p421
aVwe really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project,
p422
aVwhere you had a small group of people spending a lot of time
p423
aVto contribute something for everyone.
p424
aVWhat if we had a very low commitment,
p425
aVbut delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed?
p426
aa(lp427
VSo the project starts off by asking you to enter the address
p428
aVof the home where you grew up.
p429
aVAnd you type in the address \u2014
p430
aVit actually creates a music video specifically for you,
p431
aVpulling in Google maps and Streetview images
p432
aVinto the experience itself.
p433
aVSo this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address,
p434
aVbut I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect.

VAK: So I think, if there's one thing to take away from my talk today,
p451
aVit's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device.
p452
aVAnd as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data,
p453
aVwe have an opportunity, and maybe even an obligation,
p454
aVto maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories
p455
aVas we explore and collaborate together.

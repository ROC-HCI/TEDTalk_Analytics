VThe Internet, the Web as we know it,
p5
aVthe kind of Web \u2014 the things we're all talking about \u2014
p6
aVis already less than 5,000 days old.
p7
aVSo all of the things that we've seen come about,
p8
aVstarting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth,
p9
aVwhich we couldn't even imagine happening before,
p10
aVall these things rolling into our lives,
p11
aVjust this abundance of things that are right before us,
p12
aVsitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop.
p13
aVThis kind of cornucopia of stuff
p14
aVjust coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed.
p15
aVIt's really amazing that all this stuff is here.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVIt's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come.
p18
aVAnd I know that 10 years ago,
p19
aVif I had told you that this was all coming,
p20
aVyou would have said that that's impossible.
p21
aVThere's simply no economic model that that would be possible.
p22
aVAnd if I told you it was all coming for free,
p23
aVyou would say, this is simply \u2014 you're dreaming.
p24
aVYou're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist.
p25
aVAnd yet it's here.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,
p28
aVas I looked at what even Wired was talking about,
p29
aVwe thought it was going to be TV, but better.
p30
aVThat was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting
p31
aVwas going to be coming.
p32
aVAnd it turns out that that's not what it was.
p33
aVFirst of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.
p34
aVAnd so one of the things that I think we're learning \u2014
p35
aVif you think about, like, Wikipedia,
p36
aVit's something that was simply impossible.
p37
aVIt's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.
p38
aVAnd if you take all these things that are impossible,
p39
aVI think one of the things that we're learning from this era,
p40
aVfrom this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,
p41
aVbecause we're unprepared for it.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.
p44
aVBut if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,
p45
aVwhat's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?
p46
aVSo, I have a kind of a simple story,
p47
aVand it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,
p48
aVthis thing that has happened in 5,000 days \u2014
p49
aVthat's all these computers, all these handhelds,
p50
aVall these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers \u2014
p51
aVbasically what we're getting out of all these connections
p52
aVis we're getting one machine.
p53
aVIf there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices
p54
aVare actually just little windows into those machines,
p55
aVbut that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd so I began to think about that.
p58
aVAnd it turned out that this machine happens to be
p59
aVthe most reliable machine that we've ever made.
p60
aVIt has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.
p61
aVAnd there's almost no other machine that we've ever made
p62
aVthat runs the number of hours, the number of days.
p63
aV5,000 days without interruption \u2014 that's just unbelievable.
p64
aVAnd of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;
p65
aVthe Web is only 5,000 days.
p66
aVSo, I was trying to basically make measurements.
p67
aVWhat are the dimensions of this machine?
p68
aVAnd I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are
p69
aVall around the globe on all the computers.
p70
aVAnd there is a 100 billion clicks per day.
p71
aVAnd there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,
p74
aVand I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,
p75
aVtalking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?
p76
aVWell, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,
p77
aVbut there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,
p78
aVif you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.
p79
aVThere's two million emails per second.
p80
aVSo it's a very big number.
p81
aVIt's just a huge machine,
p82
aVand it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.
p83
aVSo here's the specifications,
p84
aVjust as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:
p85
aV170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,
p86
aVemails running at two megahertz itself,
p87
aV31 kilohertz text messaging,
p88
aV246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.
p89
aVThat's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.
p90
aVAnd the total traffic on this
p91
aVis running at seven terabytes per second.
p92
aVBrewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.
p93
aVSo every second, half of the Library of Congress
p94
aVis swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,
p97
aV55 trillion links is almost the same
p98
aVas the number of synapses in your brain.
p99
aVA quadrillion transistors is almost the same
p100
aVas the number of neurons in your brain.
p101
aVSo to a first approximation, we have these things \u2014
p102
aVtwenty petahertz synapse firings.
p103
aVOf course, the memory is really huge.
p104
aVBut to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size \u2014
p105
aVand its complexity, kind of \u2014 to your brain.
p106
aVBecause in fact, that's how your brain works \u2014 in kind of the same way that the Web works.
p107
aVHowever, your brain isn't doubling every two years.
p108
aVSo if we say this machine right now that we've made
p109
aVis about one HB, one human brain,
p110
aVif we look at the rate that this is increasing,
p111
aV30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.
p112
aVSo by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine
p113
aVwill exceed a total processing power of humanity,
p114
aa(lp115
Vin raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where
p116
aVRay Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.
p117
aVSo, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.
p118
aVI have three kind of general things
p119
aVI would like to say, three consequences of this.
p120
aVFirst, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.
p121
aVWe're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do
p122
aVin the next 5,000 days \u2014 we're going to give this machine a body.
p123
aVAnd the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.
p124
aVAnd thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo let me go through those three things.
p127
aVFirst of all, we have all these things in our hands.
p128
aVWe think they're all separate devices,
p129
aVbut in fact, every screen in the world
p130
aVis looking into the one machine.
p131
aVThese are all basically portals into that one machine.
p132
aVThe second thing is that \u2014 some people call this the cloud,
p133
aVand you're kind of touching the cloud with this.
p134
aVAnd so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.
p135
aVAnd the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.
p136
aVIt's wireless. It's always connected.
p137
aVThere's many things about it. It becomes very simple,
p138
aVand basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,
p139
aVyou're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.
p140
aVSo the machine is computing.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd in some ways, it's sort of back
p143
aVto the kind of old idea of centralized computing.
p144
aVBut everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,
p145
aVand the sensors in cars
p146
aVand everything is connected to this machine.
p147
aVAnd everything will go through the Web.
p148
aVAnd we're seeing that already with, say, phones.
p149
aVRight now, phones don't go through the Web,
p150
aVbut they are beginning to, and they will.
p151
aVAnd if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has
p152
aVin terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah \u2014
p153
aVall these things are going to become Web based.
p154
aVThey're going through the machine.
p155
aVAnd I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.
p156
aVRight now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,
p157
aVa Word document, they aren't on the Web,
p158
aVbut they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.
p159
aVThey're going to speak the Web language.
p160
aVThey're going to talk to the machine.
p161
aVThe Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole
p162
aVthat's sucking up everything into it.
p163
aVAnd so every thing will be part of the Web.
p164
aVSo every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it
p165
aVsome little sliver of Web-ness and connection,
p166
aVand it will be part of this machine,
p167
aVso that our environment \u2014 kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense \u2014
p168
aVour environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, with RFIDs and other things \u2014 whatever technology it is,
p171
aVit doesn't really matter. The point is that everything
p172
aVwill have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,
p173
aVand so we have, basically, an Internet of things.
p174
aVSo you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,
p175
aVand a car as a chip with wheels,
p176
aVbecause basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars
p177
aVis the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.
p178
aVA lot of people think about the new economy
p179
aVas something that was going to be a disembodied,
p180
aValternative, virtual existence,
p181
aVand that we would have the old economy of atoms.
p182
aVBut in fact, what the new economy really is
p183
aVis the marriage of those two, where we embed the information,
p184
aVand the digital nature of things into the material world.
p185
aVThat's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going \u2014
p186
aVthis union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd so one of the consequences of that, I believe,
p189
aVis that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now \u2014
p190
aVTV, film, video \u2014 that basically becomes one media platform.
p191
aVAnd while there's many differences in some senses,
p192
aVthey will share more and more in common with each other.
p193
aVSo that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,
p194
aVthe value's in the uncopiable things,
p195
aVthe immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.
p196
aVThe media wants to be liquid.
p197
aVThe reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,
p198
aVnot so that they are "free" as in "beer," but "free" as in "freedom."
p199
aVAnd the network effects rule,
p200
aVmeaning that the more you have, the more you get.
p201
aVThe first fax machine \u2014 the person who bought the first fax machine
p202
aVwas an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.
p203
aVBut here she became an evangelist, recruiting others
p204
aVto get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.
p205
aVThose are the effects that we're going to see.
p206
aVAttention is the currency.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.
p209
aVAnd the other thing about this embodiment
p210
aVis that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.
p211
aVMcLuhan was saying, "Machines are the extensions of the human senses."
p212
aVAnd I'm saying, "Humans are now going to be
p213
aVthe extended senses of the machine," in a certain sense.
p214
aVSo we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,
p215
aVthrough all our digital photographs and cameras.
p216
aVAnd we see that in things like Flickr,
p217
aVor Photosynth, this program from Microsoft
p218
aVthat will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place
p219
aVfrom the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.
p220
aVIn a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring,
p223
aVthat what the Web is doing is restructuring.
p224
aVAnd I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is \u2014
p225
aVI'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a "semantic Web."
p226
aa(lp227
VSo first of all, the first stage that we've seen
p228
aVof the Internet was that it was going to link computers.
p229
aVAnd that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.
p230
aVAnd we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.
p231
aVAnd if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,
p232
aVand there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,
p233
aVyou connected it from one computer to another computer.
p234
aVAnd what you had to do was \u2014 if you wanted to participate in this,
p235
aVyou had to share packets of information.
p236
aVSo you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.
p237
aVIt wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:
p238
aVyou had to share packets.
p239
aa(lp240
VThe second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.
p241
aVSo in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,
p242
aVI went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.
p243
aVNow we have pages \u2014 the unit has been resolved into pages,
p244
aVso one page links to another page.
p245
aVAnd if I want to go in to book a flight,
p246
aVI go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,
p247
aVand I'm linking to that page.
p248
aVAnd what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.
p249
aVYou couldn't deny \u2014 if someone wanted to link to you,
p250
aVyou couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea
p251
aVof opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.
p252
aVSo that's what we were doing.
p253
aa(lp254
VWe're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,
p255
aVand that is where we link the data.
p256
aVSo, I don't know what the name of this thing is.
p257
aVI'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.
p258
aVSo we're going from machine to machine,
p259
aVfrom page to page, and now data to data.
p260
aVSo the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,
p261
aVwe're actually going to link from one idea on a page
p262
aVto another idea, rather than to the other page.
p263
aVSo every idea is basically being supported \u2014
p264
aVor every item, or every noun \u2014 is being supported by the entire Web.
p265
aVIt's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.
p266
aVSo besides physically coming out again into this idea
p267
aVthat it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.
p268
aVSo something will resolve down to the information
p269
aVabout a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.
p270
aVEvery person, every item will have a something
p271
aVthat will be very specific, and will link
p272
aVto a specific representation of that idea or item.
p273
aVSo now, in this new one, when I link to it,
p274
aVI would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.
p275
aVAnd so, giving an example of this thing,
p276
aVI live in Pacifica, rather than \u2014 right now Pacifica
p277
aVis just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.
p278
aVThe Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,
p279
aVand that it's a specific town that I live in,
p280
aVbut that's what we're going to be talking about.
p281
aVIt's going to link directly to \u2014
p282
aVit will know, the Web will be able to read itself
p283
aVand know that that actually is a place,
p284
aVand that whenever it sees that word, "Pacifica,"
p285
aVit knows that it actually has a place,
p286
aVlatitude, longitude, a certain population.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,
p289
aVthat you'll see a lot more of.
p290
aVAll these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.
p291
aVSo I'll give you one kind of an example.
p292
aVThere's like a billion social sites on the Web.
p293
aVEach time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are
p294
aVand all your friends are.
p295
aVWhy should you be doing that? You should just do that once,
p296
aVand it should know who all your friends are.
p297
aVSo that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,
p298
aVand you should just carry these relationships around.
p299
aVAll this data about you should just be conveyed,
p300
aVand you should do it once and that's all that should happen.
p301
aVAnd you should have all the networks
p302
aVof all the relationships between those pieces of data.
p303
aVThat's what we're moving into \u2014 where it sort of knows these things down to that level.
p304
aVA semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph \u2014
p305
aVwe're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.
p306
aVBut what's it's doing is sharing data.
p307
aVSo you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step
p308
aVthan just sharing your Web page, or your computer.
p309
aVAnd all these things that are going to be on this
p310
aVare not just pages, they are things.
p311
aVEverything we've described, every artifact or place,
p312
aVwill be a specific representation,
p313
aVwill have a specific character that can be linked to directly.
p314
aVSo we have this database of things.
p315
aVAnd so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,
p316
aVthat we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,
p317
aVbut I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things \u2014
p318
aVwhere I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane \u2014
p319
aVthat that physical thing becomes part of the Web.
p320
aVAnd so we are in the middle of this thing
p321
aVthat's completely linked, down to every object
p322
aVin the little sliver of a connection that it has.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea
p325
aVthat we're going to be codependent.
p326
aVIt's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.
p327
aVIf you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.
p328
aVAnd I found out by looking at it
p329
aVthat I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.
p330
aVSo I am open, and being transparent to that.
p331
aVAnd I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.
p332
aVThat is going to be the price.
p333
aVIf you want to have total personalization,
p334
aVyou have to be totally transparent.
p335
aVGoogle. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.
p336
aVWe're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point
p337
aVwhere I don't even try to remember things \u2014
p338
aVI'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.
p339
aVAnd we kind of object at first, saying, "Oh, that's awful."
p340
aVBut if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,
p341
aVcalled the alphabet, and writing,
p342
aVwe're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.
p343
aVWe cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.
p344
aVAnd so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves
p345
aVwithout this other machine being there.
p346
aVAnd what is happening with this is
p347
aVsome kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,
p348
aVas being an expert, Larry Page told me
p349
aVthat that's what they're trying to do,
p350
aVand that's what they're trying to do.
p351
aVBut when six billion humans are Googling,
p352
aVwho's searching who? It goes both ways.
p353
aVSo we are the Web, that's what this thing is.
p354
aVWe are going to be the machine.
p355
aVSo the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.
p356
aVJust like it wasn't TV and only better.
p357
aVThe next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web
p358
aVbut only better \u2014 it's going to be something different.
p359
aVAnd I think it's going to be smarter.
p360
aVIt'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.
p361
aVBut it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.
p362
aVSecondly, it's become much more personalized.
p363
aVIt will know us, and that's good.
p364
aVAnd again, the price of that will be transparency.
p365
aVAnd thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous
p366
aVin terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.
p367
aVAnd all these devices will be portals into that.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo the single idea that I wanted to leave with you
p370
aVis that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better,"
p371
aVbut a new kind of stage in this development.
p372
aVIt looks more global. If you take this whole thing,
p373
aVit is a very big machine, very reliable machine,
p374
aVmore reliable than its parts.
p375
aVBut we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.
p376
aVSo we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,
p377
aVmore as if this wasn't a large organism
p378
aVthat we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."
p379
aVAnd I don't know what else to call it, than the One.
p380
aVWe'll have a better word for it.

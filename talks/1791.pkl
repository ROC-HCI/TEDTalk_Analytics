VSo here's the most important economic fact of our time.
p5
aVWe are living in an age of surging income inequality,
p6
aVparticularly between those at the very top
p7
aVand everyone else.
p8
aVThis shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,
p9
aVbut it's a global phenomenon.
p10
aVIt's happening in communist China,
p11
aVin formerly communist Russia,
p12
aVit's happening in India, in my own native Canada.
p13
aVWe're even seeing it in cozy social democracies
p14
aVlike Sweden, Finland and Germany.
p15
aa(lp16
VLet me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.
p17
aVIn the 1970s, the One Percent
p18
aVaccounted for about 10 percent of the national income
p19
aVin the United States.
p20
aVToday, their share has more than doubled
p21
aVto above 20 percent.
p22
aVBut what's even more striking
p23
aVis what's happening at the very tippy top
p24
aVof the income distribution.
p25
aVThe 0.1 percent in the U.S.
p26
aVtoday account for more than eight percent
p27
aVof the national income.
p28
aVThey are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.
p29
aVLet me give you another number to put that in perspective,
p30
aVand this is a figure that was calculated in 2005
p31
aVby Robert Reich,
p32
aVthe Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.
p33
aVReich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men,
p34
aVBill Gates and Warren Buffett,
p35
aVand he found that it was equivalent to the wealth
p36
aVof the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population,
p37
aV120 million people.
p38
aVNow, as it happens,
p39
aVWarren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat,
p40
aVhe is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon,
p41
aVand he has his own favorite number.
p42
aVBuffett likes to point out that in 1992,
p43
aVthe combined wealth of the people
p44
aVon the Forbes 400 list \u2014
p45
aVand this is the list of the 400 richest Americans \u2014
p46
aVwas 300 billion dollars.
p47
aVJust think about it.
p48
aVYou didn't even need to be a billionaire
p49
aVto get on that list in 1992.
p50
aVWell, today, that figure has more than quintupled
p51
aVto 1.7 trillion,
p52
aVand I probably don't need to tell you
p53
aVthat we haven't seen anything similar happen
p54
aVto the middle class,
p55
aVwhose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo we're living in the age of the global plutocracy,
p58
aVbut we've been slow to notice it.
p59
aVOne of the reasons, I think,
p60
aVis a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.
p61
aVChanges which are slow and gradual
p62
aVcan be hard to notice
p63
aVeven if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.
p64
aVThink about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.
p65
aVBut I think there's something else going on.
p66
aVTalking about income inequality,
p67
aVeven if you're not on the Forbes 400 list,
p68
aVcan make us feel uncomfortable.
p69
aVIt feels less positive, less optimistic,
p70
aVto talk about how the pie is sliced
p71
aVthan to think about how to make the pie bigger.
p72
aVAnd if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list,
p73
aVtalking about income distribution,
p74
aVand inevitably its cousin, income redistribution,
p75
aVcan be downright threatening.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo we're living in the age of surging income inequality,
p78
aVespecially at the top.
p79
aVWhat's driving it, and what can we do about it?
p80
aa(lp81
VOne set of causes is political:
p82
aVlower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services,
p83
aVprivatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions,
p84
aVall of these have contributed
p85
aVto more and more income going to the very, very top.
p86
aa(lp87
VA lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped
p88
aVunder the category of "crony capitalism,"
p89
aVpolitical changes that benefit a group
p90
aVof well-connected insiders
p91
aVbut don't actually do much good for the rest of us.
p92
aVIn practice, getting rid of crony capitalism
p93
aVis incredibly difficult.
p94
aVThink of all the years reformers of various stripes
p95
aVhave tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance,
p96
aVor how hard it is to re-regulate the banks
p97
aVeven after the most profound financial crisis
p98
aVsince the Great Depression,
p99
aVor even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies,
p100
aVincluding those whose motto might be "don't do evil,"
p101
aVto pay taxes at a rate even approaching that
p102
aVpaid by the middle class.
p103
aVBut while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice
p104
aVis really, really hard,
p105
aVat least intellectually, it's an easy problem.
p106
aVAfter all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.
p107
aVIndeed, this is one of those rare issues
p108
aVthat unites the left and the right.
p109
aVA critique of crony capitalism is as central
p110
aVto the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least,
p113
aVthe easy part of the problem,
p114
aVthings get trickier when you look at the economic drivers
p115
aVof surging income inequality.
p116
aVIn and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.
p117
aVGlobalization and the technology revolution,
p118
aVthe twin economic transformations
p119
aVwhich are changing our lives
p120
aVand transforming the global economy,
p121
aVare also powering the rise of the super-rich.
p122
aVJust think about it.
p123
aVFor the first time in history,
p124
aVif you are an energetic entrepreneur
p125
aVwith a brilliant new idea
p126
aVor a fantastic new product,
p127
aVyou have almost instant, almost frictionless access
p128
aVto a global market of more than a billion people.
p129
aVAs a result, if you are very, very smart
p130
aVand very, very lucky,
p131
aVyou can get very, very rich
p132
aVvery, very quickly.
p133
aVThe latest poster boy for this phenomenon
p134
aVis David Karp.
p135
aVThe 26-year-old founder of Tumblr
p136
aVrecently sold his company to Yahoo
p137
aVfor 1.1 billion dollars.
p138
aVThink about that for a minute:
p139
aV1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.
p140
aVIt's easiest to see how the technology revolution
p141
aVand globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect
p142
aVin highly visible fields,
p143
aVlike sports and entertainment.
p144
aVWe can all watch how a fantastic athlete
p145
aVor a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills
p146
aVacross the global economy as never before.
p147
aVBut today, that superstar effect
p148
aVis happening across the entire economy.
p149
aVWe have superstar technologists.
p150
aVWe have superstar bankers.
p151
aVWe have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.
p152
aVThere are superstar cooks
p153
aVand superstar farmers.
p154
aVThere are even, and this is my personal favorite example,
p155
aVsuperstar dentists,
p156
aVthe most dazzling exemplar of whom
p157
aVis Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers
p158
aVto the smiles of fellow superstars
p159
aVlike Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich
p160
aVor European-born American fashion designer
p161
aVDiane von Furstenberg.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut while it's pretty easy to see how globalization
p164
aVand the technology revolution
p165
aVare creating this global plutocracy,
p166
aVwhat's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.
p167
aVAnd that's because,
p168
aVin contrast with crony capitalism,
p169
aVso much of what globalization and the technology revolution
p170
aVhave done is highly positive.
p171
aVLet's start with technology.
p172
aVI love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.
p173
aVI love the fact that they mean that
p174
aVwhoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk
p175
aVfar beyond this auditorium.
p176
aVI'm even more of a fan of globalization.
p177
aVThis is the transformation
p178
aVwhich has lifted hundreds of millions
p179
aVof the world's poorest people out of poverty
p180
aVand into the middle class,
p181
aVand if you happen to live in the rich part of the world,
p182
aVit's made many new products affordable \u2014
p183
aVwho do you think built your iPhone? \u2014
p184
aVand things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.
p185
aVThink of your dishwasher or your t-shirt.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo what's not to like?
p188
aVWell, a few things.
p189
aVOne of the things that worries me
p190
aVis how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy
p191
aVcan become crony plutocracy.
p192
aVImagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur
p193
aVwho has successfully sold that idea or that product
p194
aVto the global billions
p195
aVand become a billionaire in the process.
p196
aVIt gets tempting at that point
p197
aVto use your economic nous
p198
aVto manipulate the rules of the global political economy
p199
aVin your own favor.
p200
aVAnd that's no mere hypothetical example.
p201
aVThink about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.
p202
aVThese are among the world's most admired,
p203
aVmost beloved, most innovative companies.
p204
aVThey also happen to be particularly adept
p205
aVat working the international tax system
p206
aVso as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.
p207
aVAnd why stop at just playing the global political
p208
aVand economic system as it exists
p209
aVto your own maximum advantage?
p210
aVOnce you have the tremendous economic power
p211
aVthat we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution
p212
aVand the political power that inevitably entails,
p213
aVit becomes tempting as well
p214
aVto start trying to change the rules of the game
p215
aVin your own favor.
p216
aVAgain, this is no mere hypothetical.
p217
aVIt's what the Russian oligarchs did
p218
aVin creating the sale-of-the-century privatization
p219
aVof Russia's natural resources.
p220
aVIt's one way of describing what happened
p221
aVwith deregulation of the financial services
p222
aVin the U.S. and the U.K.
p223
aa(lp224
VA second thing that worries me
p225
aVis how easily meritocratic plutocracy
p226
aVcan become aristocracy.
p227
aVOne way of describing the plutocrats
p228
aVis as alpha geeks,
p229
aVand they are people who are acutely aware
p230
aVof how important highly sophisticated
p231
aVanalytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.
p232
aVThat's why they are spending
p233
aVunprecedented time and resources
p234
aVeducating their own children.
p235
aVThe middle class is spending more on schooling too,
p236
aVbut in the global educational arms race
p237
aVthat starts at nursery school
p238
aVand ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT,
p239
aVthe 99 percent is increasingly outgunned
p240
aVby the One Percent.
p241
aVThe result is something that economists Alan Krueger
p242
aVand Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.
p243
aVAs income inequality increases,
p244
aVsocial mobility decreases.
p245
aVThe plutocracy may be a meritocracy,
p246
aVbut increasingly you have to be born
p247
aVon the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.
p248
aa(lp249
VThe third thing, and this is what worries me the most,
p250
aVis the extent to which those same largely positive forces
p251
aVwhich are driving the rise of the global plutocracy
p252
aValso happen to be hollowing out the middle class
p253
aVin Western industrialized economies.
p254
aVLet's start with technology.
p255
aVThose same forces that are creating billionaires
p256
aVare also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.
p257
aVWhen's the last time you used a travel agent?
p258
aVAnd in contrast with the industrial revolution,
p259
aVthe titans of our new economy
p260
aVaren't creating that many new jobs.
p261
aVAt its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands,
p262
aVFacebook fewer than 10,000.
p263
aVThe same is true of globalization.
p264
aVFor all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people
p265
aVout of poverty in the emerging markets,
p266
aVit's also outsourcing a lot of jobs
p267
aVfrom the developed Western economies.
p268
aVThe terrifying reality is
p269
aVthat there is no economic rule
p270
aVwhich automatically translates
p271
aVincreased economic growth
p272
aVinto widely shared prosperity.
p273
aVThat's shown in what I consider to be
p274
aVthe most scary economic statistic of our time.
p275
aVSince the late 1990s, increases in productivity
p276
aVhave been decoupled from increases
p277
aVin wages and employment.
p278
aVThat means that our countries are getting richer,
p279
aVour companies are getting more efficient,
p280
aVbut we're not creating more jobs
p281
aVand we're not paying people, as a whole, more.
p282
aa(lp283
VOne scary conclusion you could draw from all of this
p284
aVis to worry about structural unemployment.
p285
aVWhat worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.
p286
aVAfter all, in a totally free labor market,
p287
aVwe could find jobs for pretty much everyone.
p288
aVThe dystopia that worries me
p289
aVis a universe in which a few geniuses
p290
aVinvent Google and its ilk
p291
aVand the rest of us are employed giving them massages.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo when I get really depressed about all of this,
p294
aVI comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.
p295
aVAfter all, for all its grim, satanic mills,
p296
aVit worked out pretty well, didn't it?
p297
aVAfter all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller \u2014
p298
aVwell, there are a few exceptions \u2014
p299
aVand live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.
p300
aVBut it's important to remember
p301
aVthat before we learned how to share the fruits
p302
aVof the Industrial Revolution
p303
aVwith the broad swathes of society,
p304
aVwe had to go through two depressions,
p305
aVthe Great Depression of the 1930s,
p306
aVthe Long Depression of the 1870s,
p307
aVtwo world wars, communist revolutions
p308
aVin Russia and in China,
p309
aVand an era of tremendous social
p310
aVand political upheaval in the West.
p311
aVWe also, not coincidentally,
p312
aVwent through an era of tremendous
p313
aVsocial and political inventions.
p314
aVWe created the modern welfare state.
p315
aVWe created public education.
p316
aVWe created public health care.
p317
aVWe created public pensions.
p318
aVWe created unions.
p319
aa(lp320
VToday, we are living through an era
p321
aVof economic transformation
p322
aVcomparable in its scale and its scope
p323
aVto the Industrial Revolution.
p324
aVTo be sure that this new economy benefits us all
p325
aVand not just the plutocrats,
p326
aVwe need to embark on an era
p327
aVof comparably ambitious social and political change.
p328
aVWe need a new New Deal.

VI'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems
p5
aVand how it can be solved.
p6
aa(lp7
VI'd like to start with a little experiment.
p8
aVCould you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses,
p9
aVor you've had laser refractive surgery?
p10
aVNow, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.
p11
aVBut it looks like \u2014 I'm guessing \u2014 that it'll be about 60 percent of the room
p12
aVbecause that's roughly the fraction of developed world population
p13
aVthat have some sort of vision correction.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe World Health Organization estimates \u2014
p16
aVwell, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses \u2014
p17
aVthe lowest estimate is 150 million people.
p18
aVThey also have an estimate of around a billion.
p19
aVBut in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now,
p20
aVwhich shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear
p21
aVis around half of any population.
p22
aVAnd the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem,
p23
aVit's also an educational problem,
p24
aVand it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.
p25
aa(lp26
VGlasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.
p27
aVThe problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world
p28
aVto use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear
p29
aVthat we have in the developed world.
p30
aVThere are just way too few eye care professionals.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo this little slide here shows you an optometrist
p33
aVand the little blue person represents about 10,000 people
p34
aVand that's the ratio in the U.K.
p35
aVThis is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.
p36
aVIn fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa
p37
aVwhere there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.
p38
aa(lp39
VHow do you do this? How do you solve this problem?
p40
aVI came up with a solution to this problem,
p41
aVand I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.
p42
aVAnd the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself
p43
aVand that solves the problem.
p44
aa(lp45
VWhat I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
p46
aVI shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.
p47
aVI'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.
p48
aVSo \u2014 okay, I can now see that man running out there,
p49
aVand I can see that guy running out there.
p50
aVI've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.
p51
aVNext step in my process.
p52
aVSo, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.
p53
aVOkay, so I've made these glasses and ...
p54
aVOkay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
p55
aV... I've just ...
p56
aVAnd I've now made some glasses. That's it.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VNow, these aren't the only pair in the world.
p61
aVIn fact, this technology's been evolving.
p62
aVI started working on it in 1985,
p63
aVand it's been evolving very slowly.
p64
aVThere are about 30,000 in use now.
p65
aVAnd they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd I have a vision, which I'll share with you.
p68
aVI have a global vision for vision.
p69
aVAnd that vision is to try to get a billion people
p70
aVwearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.
p71
aVTo do that \u2014 this is an early example of the technology.
p72
aVThe technology is being further developed \u2014
p73
aVthe cost has to be brought down.
p74
aVThis pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.
p75
aVBut the cost has to be brought right down.
p76
aVIt has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations
p77
aVwho live on a dollar a day.
p78
aa(lp79
VHow do you solve this problem?
p80
aVYou start to get into detail.
p81
aVAnd on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
p82
aVHow do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing?
p83
aVHow do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?
p84
aVHow do you deal with the industry?
p85
aVAnd the answer to that is research.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhat we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World
p88
aVhere in the university.
p89
aVIf you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you.

VI wanted to be a rock star.
p5
aVI dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.
p6
aVTo be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.
p7
aVThis was in the late '80s.
p8
aVAnd mostly I wanted to be the fifth member
p9
aVof Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.
p10
aVThey wouldn't have me.
p11
aVI didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.
p12
aVAnd I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.
p13
aVAnd I was certain that's what my life would be.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas
p16
aVwhen I was 18,
p17
aVI was stunned to find
p18
aVthat there was not a Pop Star 101,
p19
aVor even a degree program for that interest.
p20
aVAnd the choir conductor there
p21
aVknew that I sang
p22
aVand invited me to come and join the choir.
p23
aVAnd I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great."
p24
aVAnd I left the room and said, "No way."
p25
aVThe choir people in my high school were pretty geeky,
p26
aVand there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.
p27
aVAnd about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said,
p28
aV"Listen, you've got to join choir.
p29
aVAt the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico,
p30
aVall expenses paid.
p31
aVAnd the soprano section is just full of hot girls."
p32
aVAnd so I figured for Mexico and babes,
p33
aVI could do just about anything.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd I went to my first day in choir,
p36
aVand I sat down with the basses
p37
aVand sort of looked over my shoulder
p38
aVto see what they were doing.
p39
aVThey opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat,
p40
aVand boom, they launched into the Kyrie
p41
aVfrom the "Requiem" by Mozart.
p42
aVIn my entire life I had seen in black and white,
p43
aVand suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.
p44
aVThe most transformative experience I've ever had \u2014
p45
aVin that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony
p46
aVand people singing, people together,
p47
aVthe shared vision.
p48
aVAnd I felt for the first time in my life
p49
aVthat I was part of something bigger than myself.
p50
aVAnd there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.
p51
aa(lp52
VI decided to write a piece for choir
p53
aVa couple of years later
p54
aVas a gift to this conductor
p55
aVwho had changed my life.
p56
aVI had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.
p57
aVAnd that piece was published,
p58
aVand then I wrote another piece, and that got published.
p59
aVAnd then I started conducting,
p60
aVand I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.
p61
aVAnd I find myself now in the unlikely position
p62
aVof standing in front of all of you
p63
aVas a professional classical composer and conductor.
p64
aa(lp65
VWell a couple of years ago,
p66
aVa friend of mine emailed me
p67
aVa link, a YouTube link,
p68
aVand said, "You have got to see this."
p69
aVAnd it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me,
p70
aVsinging the soprano line
p71
aVto a piece of mine called "Sleep."
p72
aa(lp73
V(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.
p74
aVMy name is Britlin Losee,
p75
aVand this is a video
p76
aVthat I'd like to make for you.
p77
aVHere's me singing "Sleep."
p78
aVI'm a little nervous, just to let you know.
p79
aV\u266b If there are noises \u266b
p80
aV\u266b in the night \u266b
p81
aa(lp82
VEric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.
p83
aVBritlin was so innocent and so sweet,
p84
aVand her voice was so pure.
p85
aVAnd I even loved seeing behind her;
p86
aVI could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.
p87
aVSuch an intimate video.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd I had this idea: if I could get 50 people
p90
aVto all do this same thing,
p91
aVsing their parts \u2014 soprano, alto, tenor and bass \u2014
p92
aVwherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube,
p93
aVwe could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.
p94
aVSo I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG."
p95
aVI actually wrote, "OMG,"
p96
aVhopefully for the last time in public ever.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVAnd I sent out this call to singers.
p99
aVAnd I made free the download of the music
p100
aVto a piece that I had written in the year 2000
p101
aVcalled "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold."
p102
aVAnd lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow I should say, before that,
p105
aVwhat I did is I posted a conductor track
p106
aVof myself conducting.
p107
aVAnd it's in complete silence when I filmed it,
p108
aVbecause I was only hearing the music in my head,
p109
aVimagining the choir that would one day come to be.
p110
aVAfterwards, I played a piano track underneath
p111
aVso that the singers would have something to listen to.
p112
aVAnd then as the videos started to come in ...
p113
aa(lp114
V(Singing)
p115
aVThis is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Singing)
p118
aVThis is Evangelina Etienne
p119
aa(lp120
V(Singing)
p121
aVfrom Massachusetts.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Singing)
p124
aVStephen Hanson from Sweden.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Singing)
p127
aVThis is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Singing)
p130
aa(lp131
VThere was even a little soprano solo in the piece,
p132
aVand so I had auditions.
p133
aVAnd a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.
p134
aVI was told later,
p135
aVand also by lots of singers who were involved in this,
p136
aVthat they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes
p137
aVuntil they got just the right take \u2014 they uploaded it.
p138
aVHere's our winner of the soprano solo.
p139
aVThis is Melody Myers from Tennessee.
p140
aV(Singing)
p141
aVI love the little smile she does right over the top of the note \u2014
p142
aVlike, "No problem, everything's fine."
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd from the crowd
p147
aVemerged this young man, Scott Haines.
p148
aVAnd he said, "Listen, this is the project
p149
aVI've been looking for my whole life.
p150
aVI'd like to be the person to edit this all together."
p151
aVI said, "Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me."
p152
aVAnd Scott aggregated all of the videos.
p153
aVHe scrubbed the audio.
p154
aVHe made sure that everything lined up.
p155
aVAnd then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.
p156
aVThis is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Singing)
p159
aa(lp160
VI'll stop it there in the interest of time.
p161
aV(Applause)
p162
aa(lp163
VThank you. Thank you.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VThank you.
p168
aVSo there's more. There's more.
p169
aVThank you so much.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd I had the same reaction you did.
p172
aVI actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.
p173
aVI just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it \u2014
p174
aVthese souls all on their own desert island,
p175
aVsending electronic messages in bottles to each other.
p176
aVAnd the video went viral.
p177
aVWe had a million hits in the first month
p178
aVand got a lot of attention for it.
p179
aVAnd because of that, then a lot of singers started saying,
p180
aV"All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?"
p181
aVAnd so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0
p182
aVthat I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing,
p183
aV"Sleep," which is another work
p184
aVthat I wrote in the year 2000 \u2014
p185
aVpoetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.
p186
aVAnd again, I posted a conductor video,
p187
aVand we started accepting submissions.
p188
aVThis time we got some more mature members.
p189
aV(Singing)
p190
aVAnd some younger members.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Video) Soprano: \u266b Upon my pillow \u266b
p193
aV\u266b Safe in bed \u266b
p194
aVEW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine.
p195
aVIsn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?
p196
aa(lp197
VSomeone did all eight videos \u2014
p198
aVa bass even singing the soprano parts.
p199
aVThis is Beau Awtin.
p200
aV(Video) Beau Awtin: \u266b Safe in bed \u266b
p201
aa(lp202
VEW: And our goal \u2014 it was sort of an arbitrary goal \u2014
p203
aVthere was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop"
p204
aVand they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.
p205
aVAnd there were 900 people involved in that.
p206
aVSo I told the singers, "That's our goal.
p207
aVThat's the number for us to beat."
p208
aVAnd we just closed submissions January 10th,
p209
aVand our final tally was 2,051 videos
p210
aVfrom 58 different countries.
p211
aVThank you.
p212
aV(Applause)
p213
aVFrom Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam,
p214
aVJordan, Egypt, Israel,
p215
aVas far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd we also put a page on Facebook
p218
aVfor the singers to upload their testimonials,
p219
aVwhat it was like for them, their experience singing it.
p220
aVAnd I've just chosen a few of them here.
p221
aV"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly.
p222
aVNow she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling.
p223
aVIt's so wonderful to sing together again!"
p224
aVI love the idea that she's singing with her sister.
p225
aV"Aside from the beautiful music,
p226
aVit's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before,
p227
aVbut who are connected anyway."
p228
aVAnd my personal favorite,
p229
aV"When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this,
p230
aVhe told me that I did not have the voice for it."
p231
aVYeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too.
p232
aVMe too.
p233
aV"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears,
p234
aVbut something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.
p235
aVIt is a dream come true to be part of this choir,
p236
aVas I've never been part of one.
p237
aVWhen I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map,
p238
aVI had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live.
p239
aVAs I am in the Great Alaskan Bush,
p240
aVsatellite is my connection to the world."
p241
aa(lp242
VSo two things struck me deeply about this.
p243
aVThe first is that human beings
p244
aVwill go to any lengths necessary
p245
aVto find and connect with each other.
p246
aVIt doesn't matter the technology.
p247
aVAnd the second is
p248
aVthat people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.
p249
aVIt wasn't a virtual choir.
p250
aVThere are people now online that are friends; they've never met.
p251
aVBut, I know myself too, I feel
p252
aVthis virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.
p253
aVI feel a closeness to this choir \u2014
p254
aValmost like a family.
p255
aa(lp256
VWhat I'd like to close with then today
p257
aVis the first look
p258
aVat "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0.
p259
aVThis will be a premiere today.
p260
aVWe're not finished with the video yet.
p261
aVYou can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos,
p262
aVthe render time is just atrocious.
p263
aVBut we do have the first three minutes.
p264
aVAnd it's a tremendous honor
p265
aVfor me to be able to show it to you here first.
p266
aVYou're the very first people to see this.
p267
aVThis is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Video) Virtual Choir: \u266b The evening hangs \u266b
p270
aV\u266b beneath the moon \u266b
p271
aV\u266b A silver thread on darkened dune \u266b
p272
aV\u266b With closing eyes and resting head \u266b
p273
aV\u266b I know that sleep is coming soon \u266b
p274
aV\u266b Upon my pillow, \u266b
p275
aV\u266b safe in bed, \u266b
p276
aV\u266b a thousand pictures fill my head \u266b
p277
aV\u266b I cannot sleep \u266b
p278
aV\u266b my mind's aflight \u266b

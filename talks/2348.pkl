VDo you think the world is going to be a better place next year?
p5
aVIn the next decade?
p6
aVCan we end hunger,
p7
aVachieve gender equality,
p8
aVhalt climate change,
p9
aVall in the next 15 years?
p10
aa(lp11
VWell, according to the governments of the world, yes we can.
p12
aVIn the last few days, the leaders of the world,
p13
aVmeeting at the UN in New York,
p14
aVagreed a new set of Global Goals
p15
aVfor the development of the world to 2030.
p16
aVAnd here they are:
p17
aVthese goals are the product of a massive consultation exercise.
p18
aVThe Global Goals are who we, humanity, want to be.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow that's the plan, but can we get there?
p21
aVCan this vision for a better world really be achieved?
p22
aVWell, I'm here today because we've run the numbers,
p23
aVand the answer, shockingly,
p24
aVis that maybe we actually can.
p25
aVBut not with business as usual.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, the idea that the world is going to get a better place
p28
aVmay seem a little fanciful.
p29
aVWatch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards, not forwards.
p30
aVAnd let's be frank:
p31
aVit's pretty easy to be skeptical about grand announcements
p32
aVcoming out of the UN.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut please, I invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment.
p35
aVBecause back in 2001,
p36
aVthe UN agreed another set of goals, the Millennium Development Goals.
p37
aVAnd the flagship target there was to halve the proportion of people
p38
aVliving in poverty by 2015.
p39
aVThe target was to take from a baseline of 1990,
p40
aVwhen 36 percent of the world's population lived in poverty,
p41
aVto get to 18 percent poverty this year.
p42
aa(lp43
VDid we hit this target?
p44
aVWell, no, we didn't.
p45
aVWe exceeded it.
p46
aVThis year, global poverty is going to fall to 12 percent.
p47
aVNow, that's still not good enough,
p48
aVand the world does still have plenty of problems.
p49
aVBut the pessimists and doomsayers who say that the world can't get better
p50
aVare simply wrong.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo how did we achieve this success?
p53
aVWell, a lot of it was because of economic growth.
p54
aVSome of the biggest reductions in poverty were in countries such as China and India,
p55
aVwhich have seen rapid economic growth in recent years.
p56
aVSo can we pull off the same trick again?
p57
aVCan economic growth get us to the Global Goals?
p58
aVWell, to answer that question,
p59
aVwe need to benchmark where the world is today against the Global Goals
p60
aVand figure out how far we have to travel.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut that ain't easy,
p63
aVbecause the Global Goals aren't just ambitious,
p64
aVthey're also pretty complicated.
p65
aVOver 17 goals, there are then 169 targets
p66
aVand literally hundreds of indicators.
p67
aVAlso, while some of the goals are pretty specific \u2014
p68
aVend hunger \u2014
p69
aVothers are a lot vaguer \u2014
p70
aVpromote peaceful and tolerant societies.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo to help us with this benchmarking,
p73
aVI'm going to use a tool called the Social Progress Index.
p74
aVWhat this does is measures all the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve,
p75
aVbut sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark
p76
aVand track progress over time.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe Social Progress Index basically asks three fundamental questions
p79
aVabout a society.
p80
aVFirst of all, does everyone have the basic needs of survival:
p81
aVfood, water, shelter, safety?
p82
aVSecondly, does everyone have the building blocks of a better life:
p83
aVeducation, information, health and a sustainable environment?
p84
aVAnd does everyone have the opportunity to improve their lives,
p85
aVthrough rights, freedom of choice, freedom from discrimination,
p86
aVand access to the world's most advanced knowledge?
p87
aa(lp88
VThe Social Progress Index sums all this together using 52 indicators
p89
aVto create an aggregate score on a scale of 0 to 100.
p90
aVAnd what we find is that there's a wide diversity of performance
p91
aVin the world today.
p92
aVThe highest performing country, Norway, scores 88.
p93
aVThe lowest performing country, Central African Republic, scores 31.
p94
aVAnd we can add up all the countries together,
p95
aVweighting for the different population sizes,
p96
aVand that global score is 61.
p97
aVIn concrete terms,
p98
aVthat means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress
p99
aVabout the same of Cuba or Kazakhstan today.
p100
aa(lp101
VThat's where we are today: 61 out of 100.
p102
aVWhat do we have to get to to achieve the Global Goals?
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, the Global Goals are certainly ambitious,
p105
aVbut they're not about turning the world into Norway in just 15 years.
p106
aVSo having looked at the numbers, my estimate is that a score of 75
p107
aVwould not only be a giant leap forward in human well-being,
p108
aVit would also count as hitting the Global Goals target.
p109
aVSo there's our target, 75 out of 100.
p110
aVCan we get there?
p111
aa(lp112
VWell, the Social Progress Index can help us calculate this,
p113
aVbecause as you might have noticed,
p114
aVthere are no economic indicators in there;
p115
aVthere's no GDP or economic growth in the Social Progress Index model.
p116
aVAnd what that lets us do is understand the relationship
p117
aVbetween economic growth and social progress.
p118
aa(lp119
VLet me show you on this chart.
p120
aVSo here on the vertical axis, I've put social progress,
p121
aVthe stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve.
p122
aVHigher is better.
p123
aVAnd then on the horizontal axis, is GDP per capita.
p124
aVFurther to the right means richer.
p125
aVAnd in there, I'm now going to put all the countries of the world,
p126
aVeach one represented by a dot,
p127
aVand on top of that I'm going to put the regression line
p128
aVthat shows the average relationship.
p129
aVAnd what this tells us is that as we get richer,
p130
aVsocial progress does tend to improve.
p131
aVHowever, as we get richer, each extra dollar of GDP
p132
aVis buying us less and less social progress.
p133
aVAnd now we can use this information to start building our forecast.
p134
aVSo here is the world in 2015.
p135
aVWe have a social progress score of 61
p136
aVand a GDP per capita of $14,000.
p137
aVAnd the place we're trying to get to, remember, is 75, that Global Goals target.
p138
aVSo here we are today, $14,000 per capita GDP.
p139
aVHow rich are we going to be in 2030?
p140
aVThat's what we need to know next.
p141
aVWell, the best forecast we can find comes from the US Department of Agriculture,
p142
aVwhich forecasts 3.1 percent average global economic growth
p143
aVover the next 15 years,
p144
aVwhich means that in 2030, if they're right,
p145
aVper capita GDP will be about $23,000.
p146
aVSo now the question is: if we get that much richer,
p147
aVhow much social progress are we going to get?
p148
aVWell, we asked a team of economists at Deloitte
p149
aVwho checked and crunched the numbers,
p150
aVand they came back and said, well, look: if the world's average wealth goes
p151
aVfrom $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,
p152
aVsocial progress is going to increase
p153
aVfrom 61 to 62.4.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VJust 62.4. Just a tiny increase.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow this seems a bit strange.
p160
aVEconomic growth seems to have really helped
p161
aVin the fight against poverty,
p162
aVbut it doesn't seem to be having much impact
p163
aVon trying to get to the Global Goals.
p164
aVSo what's going on?
p165
aVWell, I think there are two things.
p166
aVThe first is that in a way, we're the victims of our own success.
p167
aVWe've used up the easy wins from economic growth,
p168
aVand now we're moving on to harder problems.
p169
aVAnd also, we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits.
p170
aVThere are costs to the environment, costs from new health problems like obesity.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo that's the bad news.
p173
aVWe're not going to get to the Global Goals just by getting richer.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo are the pessimists right?
p176
aa(lp177
VWell, maybe not.
p178
aVBecause the Social Progress Index also has some very good news.
p179
aVLet me take you back to that regression line.
p180
aVSo this is the average relationship between GDP and social progress,
p181
aVand this is what our last forecast was based on.
p182
aVBut as you saw already,
p183
aVthere is actually lots of noise around this trend line.
p184
aa(lp185
VWhat that tells us, quite simply,
p186
aVis that GDP is not destiny.
p187
aVWe have countries that are underperforming
p188
aVon social progress, relative to their wealth.
p189
aVRussia has lots of natural resource wealth,
p190
aVbut lots of social problems.
p191
aVChina has boomed economically,
p192
aVbut hasn't made much headway on human rights or environmental issues.
p193
aVIndia has a space program and millions of people without toilets.
p194
aVNow, on the other hand, we have countries that are overperforming
p195
aVon social progress relative to their GDP.
p196
aVCosta Rica has prioritized education, health and environmental sustainability,
p197
aVand as a result, it's achieving a very high level of social progress,
p198
aVdespite only having a rather modest GDP.
p199
aVAnd Costa Rica's not alone.
p200
aVFrom poor countries like Rwanda to richer countries like New Zealand,
p201
aVwe see that it's possible to get lots of social progress,
p202
aVeven if your GDP is not so great.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd that's really important, because it tells us two things.
p205
aVFirst of all, it tells us that we already in the world have the solutions
p206
aVto many of the problems that the Global Goals are trying to solve.
p207
aVIt also tells us that we're not slaves to GDP.
p208
aVOur choices matter: if we prioritize the well-being of people,
p209
aVthen we can make a lot more progress than our GDP might expect.
p210
aa(lp211
VHow much? Enough to get us to the Global Goals?
p212
aVWell, let's look at some numbers.
p213
aVWhat we know already: the world today is scoring 61 on social progress,
p214
aVand the place we want to get to is 75.
p215
aVIf we rely on economic growth alone,
p216
aVwe're going to get to 62.4.
p217
aVSo let's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently
p218
aVunderperforming on social progress \u2014 the Russia, China, Indias \u2014
p219
aVjust up to the average.
p220
aVHow much social progress does that get us?
p221
aVWell, that takes us to 65.
p222
aVIt's a bit better, but still quite a long way to go.
p223
aVSo let's get a little bit more optimistic and say,
p224
aVwhat if every country gets a little bit better
p225
aVat turning its wealth into well-being?
p226
aVWell then, we get to 67.
p227
aVAnd now let's be even bolder still.
p228
aVWhat if every country in the world chose to be like Costa Rica
p229
aVin prioritizing human well-being,
p230
aVusing its wealth for the well-being of its citizens?
p231
aVWell then, we get to nearly 73, very close to the Global Goals.
p232
aa(lp233
VCan we achieve the Global Goals?
p234
aVCertainly not with business as usual.
p235
aVEven a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there,
p236
aVif it just raises the mega-yachts and the super-wealthy
p237
aVand leaves the rest behind.
p238
aVIf we're going to achieve the Global Goals we have to do things differently.
p239
aVWe have to prioritize social progress, and really scale solutions
p240
aVaround the world.
p241
aVI believe the Global Goals are a historic opportunity,
p242
aVbecause the world's leaders have promised to deliver them.
p243
aVLet's not dismiss the goals or slide into pessimism;
p244
aVlet's hold them to that promise.
p245
aVAnd we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable,
p246
aVtracking their progress all the way through the next 15 years.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd I want to finish by showing you
p249
aVa way to do that, called the People's Report Card.
p250
aVThe People's Report Card brings together all this data into a simple framework
p251
aVthat we'll all be familiar with from our school days,
p252
aVto hold them to account.
p253
aVIt grades our performance on the Global Goals
p254
aVon a scale from F to A,
p255
aVwhere F is humanity at its worst, and A is humanity at its best.
p256
aVOur world today is scoring a C-.
p257
aVThe Global Goals are all about getting to an A,
p258
aVand that's why we're going to be updating the People's Report Card annually,
p259
aVfor the world and for all the countries of the world,
p260
aVso we can hold our leaders to account
p261
aVto achieve this target and fulfill this promise.
p262
aVBecause getting to the Global Goals will only happen if we do things differently,
p263
aVif our leaders do things differently,
p264
aVand for that to happen, that needs us to demand it.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo let's reject business as usual.
p267
aVLet's demand a different path.
p268
aVLet's choose the world that we want.
p269
aa(lp270
VThank you.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.
p275
aVMichael, just one question: the Millennium Development Goals
p276
aVestablished 15 years ago,
p277
aVthey were kind of applying to every country
p278
aVbut it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging countries.
p279
aVNow the new Global Goals are explicitly universal.
p280
aVThey ask for every country to show action and to show progress.
p281
aVHow can I, as a private citizen, use the report card
p282
aVto create pressure for action?
p283
aa(lp284
VMichael Green: This is a really important point; it's a big shift in priorities \u2014
p285
aVit's no longer about poor countries and just poverty.
p286
aVIt's about every country.
p287
aVAnd every country is going to have challenges in getting to the Global Goals.
p288
aVEven, I'm sorry to say, Bruno, Switzerland has got to work to do.
p289
aVAnd so that's why we're going to produce these report cards in 2016
p290
aVfor every country in the world.
p291
aVThen we can really see, how are we doing?
p292
aVAnd it's not going to be rich countries scoring straight A's.
p293
aVAnd that, then, I think, is to provide a point of focus
p294
aVfor people to start demanding action and start demanding progress.
p295
aa(lp296
VBG: Thank you very much.
p297
aa(lp298

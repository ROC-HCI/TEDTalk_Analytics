VI would like to tell you about a project which I started about 16 years ago.
p5
aVIt's about making new forms of life.
p6
aVAnd these are made of this kind of tube \u2014
p7
aVelectricity tube, we call it in Holland.
p8
aVAnd we can start a film about that,
p9
aVand we can see a little bit backwards in time.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Video) Narrator: Eventually, these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches.
p12
aVTheo Jansen is working hard on this evolution.
p13
aa(lp14
VTheo Jansen: I want to put these forms of life on the beaches.
p15
aVAnd they should survive over there,
p16
aVon their own, in the future.
p17
aVLearning to live on their own \u2014
p18
aVand it'll take couple of more years
p19
aVto let them walk on their own.
p20
aa(lp21
VNarrator: The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food,
p22
aVbut from the wind.
p23
aVThe wind will move feathers on their back, which will drive their feet.
p24
aVThe beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach,
p25
aVwith its nose pointed into the wind.
p26
aVAs soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand,
p27
aVit stops, and walks in the opposite direction.
p28
aa(lp29
VEvolution has generated many species.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Music)
p32
aa(lp33
VThis is the Animaris Currens Ventosa.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Music)
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
V(Applause)
p40
aa(lp41
VTJ: This is a herd, and it is built according to genetic codes.
p42
aVAnd it is a sort of race, and each and every animal is different,
p43
aVand the winning codes will multiply.
p44
aa(lp45
VThis is the wave, going from left to right.
p46
aVYou can see this one.
p47
aVYes, and now it goes from left to right.
p48
aVThis is a new generation, a new family,
p49
aVwhich is able to store the wind.
p50
aVSo, the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles,
p51
aVwhich are on top of that.
p52
aVAnd they can use that energy in case the wind falls away,
p53
aVand the tide is coming up,
p54
aVand there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives,
p55
aVbecause they are drowned very easily.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VI could show you this animal.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Applause)
p62
aa(lp63
VThank you.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VSo, the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking.
p68
aVThere are 11 numbers, which I call The 11 Holy Numbers.
p69
aVThese are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way.
p70
aVIn fact, it's a new invention of the wheel.
p71
aVIt works the same as a wheel.
p72
aVThe axis of a wheel stays on the same level,
p73
aVand this hip is staying on the same level as well.
p74
aVIn fact, this is better than a wheel,
p75
aVbecause when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach,
p76
aVyou will notice it's very hard to do.
p77
aVAnd the feet just step over the sand,
p78
aVand the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in-between.
p79
aVSo 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel,
p80
aVwe have a new wheel.
p81
aVI will show you, in the next video \u2014
p82
aVcan you start it, please? \u2014
p83
aVthat very heavy loads can be moved.
p84
aVThere's a guy pushing there, behind,
p85
aVbut it can also walk on the wind very well.
p86
aVIt's 3.2 tons.
p87
aa(lp88
VThis is working on the stored wind in the bottles.
p89
aVIt has a feeler, where it can feel obstacles and turn around.
p90
aVYou see, it's going the other way.
p91
aa(lp92
VCan I have the feeler here?
p93
aVOK. Good.
p94
aVSo, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach,
p95
aVand one of the big dangers is the sea.
p96
aVThis is the sea.
p97
aVAnd it must feel the water of the sea.
p98
aVAnd this is the water feeler,
p99
aVand what's very important is this tube.
p100
aVIt sucks in air normally,
p101
aVbut when it swallows water, it feels the resistance of it.
p102
aVSo, imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea.
p103
aVAs soon as it touches the water \u2014
p104
aVyou should hear a sound of running air.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Sound of running air)
p107
aa(lp108
VYes!
p109
aVSo if it doesn't feel, it will be drowned, OK?
p110
aa(lp111
VHere we have the brain of the animal.
p112
aVIn fact, it is a step counter, and it counts the steps.
p113
aVIt's a binary step counter.
p114
aVSo as soon it has been to the sea,
p115
aVit changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here.
p116
aVAnd it always knows where it is on the beach.
p117
aVSo it's very simple brain.
p118
aVIt says, well, there's the sea, there are dunes, and I'm here.
p119
aVSo it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal.
p120
aa(lp121
VThank you.
p122
aa(lp123
VOne of the biggest enemies are the storms.
p124
aVThis is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere.
p125
aVWhen the nose of the animal is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
p126
aVSo when the storm is coming up,
p127
aVit drives a pin into the ground.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VAudience member: Wow!
p132
aa(lp133
VThe nose is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
p134
aVThe wind may turn, but the animal will always turn its nose into the wind.
p135
aVNow, another couple of years, and these animals will survive on their own.
p136
aVI still have to help them a lot.
p137
aa(lp138
VThank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
p139

VThis man is wearing what we call
p5
aVa bee beard. (Laughter)
p6
aVA beard full of bees.
p7
aa(lp8
VNow, this is what many of you might picture
p9
aVwhen you think about honeybees, maybe insects,
p10
aVor maybe anything that has more legs than two.
p11
aVAnd let me start by telling you, I gotcha.
p12
aVI understand that. But, there are many things to know,
p13
aVand I want you to open your minds here,
p14
aVkeep them open, and change your perspective about honeybees.
p15
aa(lp16
VNotice that this man is not getting stung.
p17
aVHe probably has a queen bee tied to his chin,
p18
aVand the other bees are attracted to it.
p19
aVSo this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees,
p20
aVand that goes deep back for thousands of years.
p21
aVWe're very co-evolved, because we depend on bees
p22
aVfor pollination and, even more recently,
p23
aVas an economic commodity.
p24
aa(lp25
VMany of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing,
p26
aVnot just dying, but they're gone.
p27
aVWe don't even find dead bodies.
p28
aVThis is called colony collapse disorder,
p29
aVand it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe
p30
aVstill do not know what's causing it,
p31
aVbut what we do know is that, with the declining numbers
p32
aVof bees, the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops
p33
aVthat we rely on for food is going up in price.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo honeybees are important for their role in the economy
p36
aVas well as in agriculture.
p37
aVHere you can see some pictures of what are called
p38
aVgreen roofs, or urban agriculture.
p39
aVWe're familiar with the image on the left that shows
p40
aVa local neighborhood garden in the South End.
p41
aVThat's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard.
p42
aVAnd perhaps a green roof in the future,
p43
aVwhen we're further utilizing urban areas,
p44
aVwhere there are stacks of garden spaces.
p45
aa(lp46
VCheck out this image above the orange line in Boston.
p47
aVTry to spot the beehive. It's there.
p48
aVIt's on the rooftop, right on the corner there,
p49
aVand it's been there for a couple of years now.
p50
aVThe way that urban beekeeping currently operates
p51
aVis that the beehives are quite hidden,
p52
aVand it's not because they need to be.
p53
aVIt's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea,
p54
aVand that's why I want you today to try to think about this,
p55
aVthink about the benefits of bees in cities
p56
aVand why they really are a terrific thing.
p57
aa(lp58
VLet me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works.
p59
aVSo we know flowers, we know fruits and vegetables,
p60
aVeven some alfalfa in hay that the livestock
p61
aVfor the meats that we eat, rely on pollinators,
p62
aVbut you've got male and female parts to a plant here,
p63
aVand basically pollinators are attracted to plants
p64
aVfor their nectar, and in the process,
p65
aVa bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen,
p66
aVor that male kind of sperm counterpart, along the way,
p67
aVand then travel to different flowers, and eventually
p68
aVan apple, in this case, will be produced.
p69
aVYou can see the orientation. The stem is down.
p70
aVThe blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it,
p71
aVbut that's a basic overview of how pollination works.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd let's think about urban living, not today,
p74
aVand not in the past, but what about in a hundred years?
p75
aVWhat's it gonna look like? We have huge grand challenges
p76
aVthese days of habitat loss. We have more and more people,
p77
aVbillions of people, in 100 years, God knows how many people,
p78
aVand how little space there will be to fit all of them,
p79
aVso we need to change the way that we see cities, and
p80
aVlooking at this picture on the left of New York City today,
p81
aVyou can see how gray and brown it is.
p82
aVWe have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back
p83
aVinto the atmosphere,
p84
aVcontributing to global climate change, no doubt.
p85
aVWhat about in 100 years, if we have green rooftops
p86
aVeverywhere, and gardening, and we create our own crops
p87
aVright in the cities? We save on the costs of transportation,
p88
aVwe save on a healthier diet, and we also educate
p89
aVand create new jobs locally.
p90
aVWe need bees for the future of our cities and urban living.
p91
aa(lp92
VHere's some data that we collected through our company
p93
aVwith Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage
p94
aVhoneybee hives for anybody who wants them,
p95
aVin the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees,
p96
aVand the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop
p97
aVor fire escape, for even that matter,
p98
aVand seeing how simple it is and how possible it is.
p99
aa(lp100
VThere's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed
p101
aVin these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here,
p102
aVoverwintering survival.
p103
aVNow this has been a huge problem for many years,
p104
aVbasically since the late 1980s, when the varroa mite came
p105
aVand brought many different viruses, bacteria
p106
aVand fungal diseases with it.
p107
aVOverwintering success is hard,
p108
aVand that's when most of the colonies are lost,
p109
aVand we found that in the cities, bees are surviving
p110
aVbetter than they are in the country.
p111
aVA bit counterintuitive, right?
p112
aVWe think, oh, bees, countryside, agriculture,
p113
aVbut that's not what the bees are showing.
p114
aVThe bees like it in the city. (Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VFurthermore, they also produce more honey.
p117
aVThe urban honey is delicious.
p118
aVThe bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel,
p119
aVwhere we have hundreds of thousands of bees
p120
aVflying overheard right now
p121
aVthat I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by,
p122
aVare going to all of the local community gardens
p123
aVand making delicious, healthy honey
p124
aVthat just tastes like the flowers in our city.
p125
aVSo the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production,
p126
aVis higher as well as the overwintering survival,
p127
aVcompared to rural areas.
p128
aVAgain, a bit counterintuitive.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd looking back historically at the timeline
p131
aVof honeybee health, we can go back to the year 950 and see
p132
aVthat there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland.
p133
aVSo the problems of bees today isn't necessarily
p134
aVsomething new. It has been happening
p135
aVsince over a thousand years ago,
p136
aVbut what we don't really notice are these problems in cities.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo one thing I want to encourage you to think about
p139
aVis the idea of what an urban island is.
p140
aVYou think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer.
p141
aVWhy are bees doing better in the city?
p142
aVThis is a big question now to help us understand
p143
aVwhy they should be in the city.
p144
aVPerhaps there's more pollen in the city.
p145
aVWith the trains coming in to urban hubs, they can
p146
aVcarry pollen with them, very light pollen,
p147
aVand it's just a big supermarket in the city.
p148
aVA lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks.
p149
aVPerhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities
p150
aVthan there are in [rural] areas.
p151
aVPerhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet,
p152
aVbut that's one idea to think about, urban islands.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd colony collapse disorder is not the only thing
p155
aVaffecting honeybees. Honeybees are dying,
p156
aVand it's a huge, huge grand challenge of our time.
p157
aVWhat you can see up here is a map of the world,
p158
aVand we're tracking the spread of this varroa mite.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow, the varroa mite is what changed the game
p161
aVin beekeeping, and you can see, at the top right,
p162
aVthe years are changing, we're coming up to modern times,
p163
aVand you can see the spread of the varroa mite
p164
aVfrom the early 1900s through now.
p165
aVIt's 1968, and we're pretty much covering Asia.
p166
aV1971, we saw it spread to Europe and South America,
p167
aVand then, when we get to the 1980s,
p168
aVand specifically to 1987, the varroa mite finally came
p169
aVto North America and to the United States,
p170
aVand that is when the game changed
p171
aVfor honeybees in the United States.
p172
aa(lp173
VMany of us will remember our childhood growing up,
p174
aVmaybe you got stung by a bee, you saw bees on flowers.
p175
aVThink of the kids today. Their childhood's a bit different.
p176
aVThey don't experience this.
p177
aVThe bees just aren't around anymore.
p178
aVSo we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem.
p179
aa(lp180
VWhat can we do here?
p181
aVSo, what I do is honeybee research.
p182
aVI got my Ph.D. studying honeybee health.
p183
aVI started in 2005 studying honeybees.
p184
aVIn 2006, honeybees started disappearing,
p185
aVso suddenly, like, this little nerd kid
p186
aVgoing to school working with bugs \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p187
aVbecame very relevant in the world.
p188
aVAnd it worked out that way.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier.
p191
aVI don't research what's killing the bees, per se.
p192
aVI'm not one of the many researchers around the world
p193
aVwho's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases
p194
aVor habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees.
p195
aVWe're looking at ways to make bees healthier
p196
aVthrough vaccines, through yogurt, like probiotics,
p197
aVand other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees,
p198
aVand this process is so easy, even a 7-year-old can do it.
p199
aVYou just mix up some pollen, sugar and water,
p200
aVand whatever active ingredient you want to put in,
p201
aVand you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved,
p202
aVjust immune boosters.
p203
aa(lp204
VHumans think about our own health in a prospective way.
p205
aVWe exercise, we eat healthy, we take vitamins.
p206
aVWhy don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way?
p207
aVBring them to areas where they're thriving
p208
aVand try to make them healthier before they get sick.
p209
aa(lp210
VI spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines
p211
aVwith needles. (Laughter) Like, years,
p212
aVyears at the bench, "Oh my gosh, it's 3 a.m.
p213
aVand I'm still pricking bees." (Laughter)
p214
aVAnd then one day I said, "Why don't we just do an oral vaccine?"
p215
aVIt's like, "Ugh," so that's what we do. (Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VI'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives,
p218
aVbecause they can be anything.
p219
aVI mean, really open your mind with this.
p220
aVYou can paint a hive to match your home.
p221
aVYou can hide a hive inside your home.
p222
aVThese are three hives on the rooftop
p223
aVof the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel,
p224
aVand they're beautiful here. I mean, we matched
p225
aVthe new color of the inside of their rooms to do
p226
aVsome type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets,
p227
aVand these bees are terrific, and they also will use
p228
aVherbs that are growing in the garden.
p229
aVThat's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking,
p230
aVand the honey \u2014 they do live events \u2014
p231
aVthey'll use that honey at their bars.
p232
aVHoney is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar
p233
aVbecause there are different types of sugars in there.
p234
aa(lp235
VWe also have a classroom hives project,
p236
aVwhere \u2014 this is a nonprofit venture \u2014
p237
aVwe're spreading the word around the world for how
p238
aVhoneybee hives can be taken into the classroom
p239
aVor into the museum setting, behind glass,
p240
aVand used as an educational tool.
p241
aa(lp242
VThis hive that you see here has been
p243
aVin Fenway High School for many years now.
p244
aVThe bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park.
p245
aVNobody notices it. If you're not a flower,
p246
aVthese bees do not care about you. (Laughter)
p247
aVThey don't. They don't. They'll say,
p248
aV"S'cuse me, flying around." (Laughter)
p249
aVSome other images here in telling a part of the story
p250
aVthat really made urban beekeeping terrific is
p251
aVin New York City, beekeeping was illegal until 2010.
p252
aVThat's a big problem, because what's going to pollinate
p253
aVall of the gardens and the produce locally? Hands?
p254
aVI mean, locally in Boston, there is a terrific company
p255
aVcalled Green City Growers, and they are going
p256
aVand pollinating their squash crops by hand with Q-Tips,
p257
aVand if they miss that three day window, there's no fruit.
p258
aVTheir clients aren't happy, and people go hungry.
p259
aVSo this is important.
p260
aa(lp261
VWe have also some images of honey from Brooklyn.
p262
aVNow, this was a mystery in the New York Times
p263
aVwhere the honey was very red, and the
p264
aVNew York State forensics department came in
p265
aVand they actually did some science to match
p266
aVthe red dye with that found
p267
aVin a maraschino cherry factory down the street. (Laughter)
p268
aVSo you can tailor your honey to taste however you want
p269
aVby planting bee-friendly flowers.
p270
aa(lp271
VParis has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping.
p272
aVThey've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house
p273
aVfor many years now, and that's what really got people started, thinking,
p274
aV"Wow, we can do this, and we should do this."
p275
aVAlso in London, and in Europe across the board,
p276
aVthey're very advanced in their use of green rooftops
p277
aVand integrating beehives,
p278
aVand I'll show you an ending note here.
p279
aa(lp280
VI would like to encourage you to open your mind.
p281
aVWhat can you do to save the bees or to help them
p282
aVor to think of sustainable cities in the future?
p283
aVWell, really, just change your perspective.
p284
aVTry to understand that bees are very important.
p285
aVA bee isn't going to sting you if you see it.
p286
aVThe bee dies. Honeybees die when they sting,
p287
aVso they don't want to do it either. (Laughter)
p288
aVIt's nothing to panic about. They're all over the city.
p289
aVYou could even get your own hive if you want.
p290
aVThere are great resources available,
p291
aVand there are even companies that will help get you set up and mentor you
p292
aVand it's important for our educational system in the world
p293
aVfor students to learn about agriculture worldwide
p294
aVsuch as this little girl, who, again, is not even getting stung.
p295
aVThank you. (Applause)

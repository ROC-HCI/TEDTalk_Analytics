VThere have been many revolutions over the last century,
p5
aVbut perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution.
p6
aVWe are living on average today 34 years longer
p7
aVthan our great-grandparents did \u2014 think about that.
p8
aVThat's an entire second adult lifetime
p9
aVthat's been added to our lifespan.
p10
aVAnd yet, for the most part,
p11
aVour culture has not come to terms with what this means.
p12
aVWe're still living with the old paradigm
p13
aVof age as an arch.
p14
aVThat's the metaphor, the old metaphor.
p15
aVYou're born, you peak at midlife
p16
aVand decline into decrepitude.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAge as pathology.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut many people today \u2014 philosophers, artists, doctors, scientists \u2014
p23
aVare taking a new look at what I call "the third act" \u2014
p24
aVthe last three decades of life.
p25
aVThey realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life
p26
aVwith its own significance,
p27
aVas different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood.
p28
aVAnd they are asking \u2014 we should all be asking:
p29
aVHow do we use this time?
p30
aVHow do we live it successfully?
p31
aVWhat is the appropriate new metaphor for aging?
p32
aa(lp33
VI've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject.
p34
aVAnd I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging
p35
aVis a staircase \u2014
p36
aVthe upward ascension of the human spirit,
p37
aVbringing us into wisdom, wholeness, and authenticity.
p38
aVAge not at all as pathology.
p39
aVAge as potential.
p40
aVAnd guess what?
p41
aVThis potential is not for the lucky few.
p42
aVIt turns out, most people over 50
p43
aVfeel better, are less stressed, less hostile, less anxious.
p44
aVWe tend to see commonalities more than differences.
p45
aVSome of the studies even say we're happier.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VThis is not what I expected, trust me.
p50
aVI come from a long line of depressives.
p51
aVAs I was approaching my late 40s,
p52
aVwhen I would wake up in the morning,
p53
aVmy first six thoughts would all be negative.
p54
aVAnd I got scared.
p55
aVI thought, "Oh my gosh. I'm going to become a crotchety old lady."
p56
aVBut now that I am actually smack-dab in the middle of my own third act,
p57
aVI realize I've never been happier.
p58
aVI have such a powerful feeling of well-being.
p59
aVAnd I've discovered
p60
aVthat when you're inside oldness,
p61
aVas opposed to looking at it from the outside,
p62
aVfear subsides.
p63
aVYou realize you're still yourself \u2014
p64
aVmaybe even more so.
p65
aVPicasso once said, "It takes a long time to become young."
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VI don't want to romanticize aging.
p70
aVObviously, there's no guarantee
p71
aVthat it can be a time of fruition and growth.
p72
aVSome of it is a matter of luck.
p73
aVSome of it, obviously, is genetic.
p74
aVOne third of it, in fact, is genetic.
p75
aVAnd there isn't much we can do about that.
p76
aVBut that means that two-thirds of how well we do in the third act,
p77
aVwe can do something about.
p78
aVWe're going to discuss what we can do
p79
aVto make these added years really successful,
p80
aVand use them to make a difference.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, let me say something about the staircase,
p83
aVwhich may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors,
p84
aVgiven the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VMyself included.
p89
aVAs you may know, the entire world operates on a universal law:
p90
aVentropy, the second law of thermodynamics.
p91
aVEntropy means that everything in the world \u2014 everything \u2014
p92
aVis in a state of decline and decay \u2014
p93
aVthe arch.
p94
aVThere's only one exception to this universal law,
p95
aVand that is the human spirit,
p96
aVwhich can continue to evolve upwards, the staircase,
p97
aVbringing us into wholeness, authenticity, and wisdom.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd here's an example of what I mean.
p100
aVThis upward ascension
p101
aVcan happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges.
p102
aVAbout three years ago, I read an article in the New York Times.
p103
aVIt was about a man named Neil Selinger \u2014
p104
aV57 years old, a retired lawyer,
p105
aVwho had joined the writers' group at Sarah Lawrence,
p106
aVwhere he found his writer's voice.
p107
aVTwo years later,
p108
aVhe was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
p109
aVIt's a terrible disease. It's fatal.
p110
aVIt wastes the body, but the mind remains intact.
p111
aVIn this article, Mr. Selinger wrote the following
p112
aVto describe what was happening to him.
p113
aVAnd I quote:
p114
aV"As my muscles weakened,
p115
aVmy writing became stronger.
p116
aVAs I slowly lost my speech,
p117
aVI gained my voice.
p118
aVAs I diminished, I grew.
p119
aVAs I lost so much,
p120
aVI finally started to find myself."
p121
aVNeil Selinger, to me,
p122
aVis the embodiment of mounting the staircase
p123
aVin his third act.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow we're all born with spirit, all of us,
p126
aVbut sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life,
p127
aVviolence, abuse, neglect.
p128
aVPerhaps our parents suffered from depression.
p129
aVPerhaps they weren't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world.
p130
aVPerhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain, a wound.
p131
aVPerhaps we feel that many of our relationships
p132
aVhave not had closure.
p133
aVAnd so we can feel unfinished.
p134
aVPerhaps the task of the third act
p135
aVis to finish up the task of finishing ourselves.
p136
aa(lp137
VFor me, it began as I was approaching my third act, my 60th birthday.
p138
aVHow was I supposed to live it?
p139
aVWhat was I supposed to accomplish in this final act?
p140
aVAnd I realized that, in order to know where I was going,
p141
aVI had to know where I'd been.
p142
aVAnd so I went back and I studied my first two acts,
p143
aVtrying to see who I was then,
p144
aVwho I really was, not who my parents or other people told me I was,
p145
aVor treated me like I was.
p146
aVBut who was I?
p147
aVWho were my parents \u2014 not as parents, but as people?
p148
aVWho were my grandparents?
p149
aVHow did they treat my parents?
p150
aVThese kinds of things.
p151
aa(lp152
VI discovered, a couple of years later,
p153
aVthat this process that I had gone through
p154
aVis called by psychologists "doing a life review."
p155
aVAnd they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning
p156
aVto a person's life.
p157
aVYou may discover, as I did,
p158
aVthat a lot of things that you used to think were your fault,
p159
aVa lot of things you used to think about yourself,
p160
aVreally had nothing to do with you.
p161
aVIt wasn't your fault; you're just fine.
p162
aVAnd you're able to go back and forgive them.
p163
aVAnd forgive yourself.
p164
aVYou're able to free yourself
p165
aVfrom your past.
p166
aVYou can work to change your relationship to your past.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow while I was writing about this,
p169
aVI came upon a book called "Man's Search for Meaning"
p170
aVby Viktor Frankl.
p171
aVViktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist
p172
aVwho'd spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp.
p173
aVAnd he wrote that, while he was in the camp,
p174
aVhe could tell, should they ever be released,
p175
aVwhich of the people would be OK, and which would not.
p176
aVAnd he wrote this:
p177
aV"Everything you have in life can be taken from you
p178
aVexcept one thing:
p179
aVyour freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.
p180
aVThis is what determines the quality of the life we've lived \u2014
p181
aVnot whether we've been rich or poor,
p182
aVfamous or unknown,
p183
aVhealthy or suffering.
p184
aVWhat determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities,
p185
aVwhat kind of meaning we assign them,
p186
aVwhat kind of attitude we cling to about them,
p187
aVwhat state of mind we allow them to trigger."
p188
aa(lp189
VPerhaps the central purpose of the third act
p190
aVis to go back and to try, if appropriate,
p191
aVto change our relationship to the past.
p192
aVIt turns out that cognitive research shows
p193
aVwhen we are able to do this,
p194
aVit manifests neurologically \u2014
p195
aVneural pathways are created in the brain.
p196
aVYou see, if you have, over time,
p197
aVreacted negatively to past events and people,
p198
aVneural pathways are laid down
p199
aVby chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain.
p200
aVAnd over time, these neural pathways become hardwired.
p201
aVThey become the norm \u2014 even if it's bad for us,
p202
aVbecause it causes us stress and anxiety.
p203
aa(lp204
VIf, however,
p205
aVwe can go back and alter our relationship,
p206
aVre-vision our relationship to past people and events,
p207
aVneural pathways can change.
p208
aVAnd if we can maintain the more positive feelings
p209
aVabout the past,
p210
aVthat becomes the new norm.
p211
aVIt's like resetting a thermostat.
p212
aVIt's not having experiences
p213
aVthat makes us wise.
p214
aVIt's reflecting on the experiences that we've had that makes us wise
p215
aVand that helps us become whole,
p216
aVbrings wisdom and authenticity.
p217
aVIt helps us become what we might have been.
p218
aa(lp219
VWomen start off whole, don't we?
p220
aVI mean, as girls, we're feisty \u2014 "Yeah? Who says?"
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VWe have agency.
p225
aVWe are the subjects of our own lives.
p226
aVBut very often,
p227
aVmany, if not most of us, when we hit puberty,
p228
aVwe start worrying about fitting in and being popular.
p229
aVAnd we become the subjects and objects of other people's lives.
p230
aVBut now, in our third acts,
p231
aVit may be possible for us to circle back to where we started,
p232
aVand know it for the first time.
p233
aVAnd if we can do that,
p234
aVit will not just be for ourselves.
p235
aVOlder women are the largest demographic in the world.
p236
aVIf we can go back and redefine ourselves
p237
aVand become whole,
p238
aVthis will create a cultural shift in the world,
p239
aVand it will give an example to younger generations
p240
aVso that they can reconceive their own lifespan.
p241
aa(lp242
VThank you very much.

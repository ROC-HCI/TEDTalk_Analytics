VThis is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,
p5
aVwhere I work as a curator.
p6
aVIt's my job to make sure the collection stays okay,
p7
aVand that it grows,
p8
aVand basically it means I collect dead animals.
p9
aVBack in 1995,
p10
aVwe got a new wing next to the museum.
p11
aVIt was made of glass,
p12
aVand this building really helped me to do my job good.
p13
aVThe building was a true bird-killer.
p14
aVYou may know that birds don't understand
p15
aVthe concept of glass. They don't see it,
p16
aVso they fly into the windows and get killed.
p17
aVThe only thing I had to do was go out,
p18
aVpick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVAnd in those days,
p21
aVI developed an ear to identify birds
p22
aVjust by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd it was on June 5, 1995,
p25
aVthat I heard a loud bang against the glass
p26
aVthat changed my life and ended that of a duck.
p27
aVAnd this is what I saw when I looked out of the window.
p28
aVThis is the dead duck. It flew against the window.
p29
aVIt's laying dead on its belly.
p30
aVBut next to the dead duck is a live duck,
p31
aVand please pay attention.
p32
aVBoth are of the male sex.
p33
aVAnd then this happened.
p34
aVThe live duck mounted the dead duck,
p35
aVand started to copulate.
p36
aa(lp37
VWell, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist.
p38
aVI said, "Something's wrong here."
p39
aVOne is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia.
p40
aVI look. Both are of the male sex.
p41
aVHomosexual necrophilia.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo I \u2014 (Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VI took my camera, I took my notebook,
p46
aVtook a chair, and started to observe this behavior.
p47
aVAfter 75 minutes \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p48
aVI had seen enough, and I got hungry,
p49
aVand I wanted to go home.
p50
aVSo I went out, collected the duck,
p51
aVand before I put it in the freezer,
p52
aVI checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.
p53
aVAnd here's a rare picture of a duck's penis,
p54
aVso it was indeed of the male sex.
p55
aVIt's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds
p56
aVand only 300 possess a penis.
p57
aa(lp58
V[The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)]
p59
aa(lp60
VI knew I'd seen something special,
p61
aVbut it took me six years to decide to publish it.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVI mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party
p64
aVor at the coffee machine,
p65
aVbut to share this among your peers is something different.
p66
aVI didn't have the framework.
p67
aVSo after six years, my friends and colleagues urged me to publish,
p68
aVso I published "The first case of homosexual necrophilia
p69
aVin the mallard."
p70
aVAnd here's the situation again.
p71
aVA is my office,
p72
aVB is the place where the duck hit the glass,
p73
aVand C is from where I watched it.
p74
aVAnd here are the ducks again.
p75
aa(lp76
VAs you probably know, in science,
p77
aVwhen you write a kind of special paper,
p78
aVonly six or seven people read it.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVBut then something good happened.
p81
aVI got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams,
p82
aVand he told me, "You've won a prize with your duck paper:
p83
aVthe Ig Nobel Prize."
p84
aVAnd the Ig Nobel Prize \u2014
p85
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p86
aVthe Ig Nobel Prize honors research
p87
aVthat first makes people laugh, and then makes them think,
p88
aVwith the ultimate goal to make more people
p89
aVinterested in science.
p90
aVThat's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VI went \u2014 let me remind you that Marc Abrahams
p94
aVdidn't call me from Stockholm.
p95
aVHe called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.
p96
aVSo I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge,
p97
aVand I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony
p98
aVheld at Harvard University, and this ceremony
p99
aVis a very nice experience.
p100
aVReal Nobel laureates hand you the prize.
p101
aVThat's the first thing.
p102
aVAnd there are nine other winners who get prizes.
p103
aVHere's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton
p104
aVwho won the 2000 biology prize for his paper,
p105
aV"Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans
p106
aVunder farming conditions in Britain."
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVAnd I think there are one or two more
p109
aVIg Nobel Prize winners in this room.
p110
aVDan, where are you? Dan Ariely?
p111
aVApplause for Dan.
p112
aV(Applause)
p113
aVDan won his prize in medicine
p114
aVfor demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine
p115
aVworks better than low-priced fake medicine.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VSo here's my one minute of fame,
p119
aVmy acceptance speech,
p120
aVand here's the duck.
p121
aVThis is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.
p122
aVI'm going to pass it around.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVYeah?
p125
aVYou can pass it around.
p126
aVPlease note it's a museum specimen,
p127
aVbut there's no chance you'll get the avian flu.
p128
aa(lp129
VAfter winning this prize, my life changed.
p130
aVIn the first place, people started to send me
p131
aVall kinds of duck-related things,
p132
aVand I got a real nice collection.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVMore importantly,
p135
aVpeople started to send me their observations
p136
aVof remarkable animal behavior,
p137
aVand believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet,
p138
aVI know about it.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VThis is a moose.
p143
aVIt's a moose trying to copulate
p144
aVwith a bronze statue of a bison.
p145
aVThis is in Montana, 2008.
p146
aVThis is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish.
p147
aVThis is the Netherlands, 2011.
p148
aVThese are cane toads in Australia.
p149
aVThis is roadkill.
p150
aVPlease note that this is necrophilia.
p151
aVIt's remarkable: the position.
p152
aVThe missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom.
p153
aVThese are pigeons in Rotterdam.
p154
aVBarn swallows in Hong Kong, 2004.
p155
aVThis is a turkey in Wisconsin
p156
aVon the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution.
p157
aVIt took all day,
p158
aVand the prisoners had a great time.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo what does this mean?
p161
aVI mean, the question I ask myself,
p162
aVwhy does this happen in nature?
p163
aVWell, what I concluded
p164
aVfrom reviewing all these cases
p165
aVis that it is important that this happens
p166
aVonly when death is instant
p167
aVand in a dramatic way
p168
aVand in the right position for copulation.
p169
aVAt least, I thought it was till I got these slides.
p170
aVAnd here you see a dead duck.
p171
aVIt's been there for three days,
p172
aVand it's laying on its back.
p173
aVSo there goes my theory of necrophilia.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnother example of the impact
p176
aVof glass buildings on the life of birds.
p177
aVThis is Mad Max, a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam.
p178
aVThe only thing this bird did was fly against this window
p179
aVfrom 2004 to 2008, day in and day out.
p180
aVHere he goes, and here's a short video.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Music) (Clunk)
p183
aV(Clunk)
p184
aV(Clunk)
p185
aV(Clunk)
p186
aa(lp187
VSo what this bird does
p188
aVis fight his own image.
p189
aVHe sees an intruder in his territory,
p190
aVand it's coming all the time and he's there,
p191
aVso there is no end to it.
p192
aVAnd I thought, in the beginning \u2014 I studied this bird for a couple of years \u2014
p193
aVthat, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?
p194
aVIt's not. I show you here some slides,
p195
aVsome frames from the video,
p196
aVand at the last moment before he hits the glass,
p197
aVhe puts his feet in front,
p198
aVand then he bangs against the glass.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day.
p201
aVThat's on June 5 every year.
p202
aVAt five minutes to six in the afternoon,
p203
aVwe come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,
p204
aVthe duck comes out of the museum,
p205
aVand we try to discuss new ways
p206
aVto prevent birds from colliding with windows.
p207
aVAnd as you know, or as you may not know,
p208
aVthis is one of the major causes of death
p209
aVfor birds in the world.
p210
aVIn the U.S. alone, a billion birds die
p211
aVin collision with glass buildings.
p212
aVAnd when it's over, we go to a Chinese restaurant
p213
aVand we have a six-course duck dinner.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo I hope to see you
p216
aVnext year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
p217
aVfor Dead Duck Day.
p218
aVThank you.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VOh, sorry.
p223
aVMay I have my duck back, please?
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p226
aa(lp227
VThank you.

long-lost birds, such as the black-chinned monarch (<em>Monarcha boanensis</em>) on the remote Moluccan island of Boano in 1991. On the tiny West Papuan island of Boo he collected and named a new subspecies of fruit bat (<em>Macroglossus minimus booensis</em>).</p><p>Aaaaand he&#39;s the guy who observed and published the first scientifically documented case of homosexual necrophilia in ducks. For this, he was awarded the 2003 Ig Nobel biology prize, and that much-coveted award led him to appreciate that curiosity and humour can be powerful tools for scientists and science communicators. </p><p>Moeliker later used these tools to tell the world about two other notorious, complicated subjects: the brutally murdered &lsquo;Domino&rsquo; sparrow and the feared disappearance of the once-ubiquitous pubic louse. He has pioneered unusual ways to engage international audience &mdash; to make people think about remarkable animal behaviour, biodiversity and habitat destruction.</p><p>His writings include two books, in Dutch: <a href=\\"http://www.nieuwamsterdam.nl/boekUitgave.aspx?ID=1176\\" target=\\"_blank\\">&#39;<em>De eendenman</em></a>&#39; (<em>The Duck Guy</em>, 2009) and &#39;<a href=\\"http://www.nieuwamsterdam.nl/boekUitgave.aspx?ID=2333\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>De bilnaad van de teek</em></a>&#39; (<em>The Butt Crack of the Tick</em>, 2012). </p><p>Each year, on June 5, he organizes <a href=\\"http://www.deadduckday.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Dead Duck Day</a>, an event that commemorates the first known case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard duck.

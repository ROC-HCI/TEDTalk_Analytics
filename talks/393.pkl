VThe fragrance that you will smell, you will never be able to smell this way again.
p5
aVIt\u2019s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise,
p6
aVwhich you can find in any store in the nation.
p7
aVExcept here it\u2019s been split up in parts by Estée Lauder
p8
aVand by the perfumer who did it, Calice Becker,
p9
aVand I'm most grateful to them for this.
p10
aVAnd it\u2019s been split up in successive bits and a chord.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo what you\u2019re smelling now is the top note.
p13
aVAnd then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.
p14
aVI will show it to you.
p15
aVThe Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe lush heart note, Melaleuca bark note \u2014 which does not contain any Melaleuca bark,
p18
aVbecause it\u2019s totally forbidden.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd after that, the complete fragrance.
p21
aVNow what you are smelling is a combination of \u2014
p22
aVI asked how many molecules there were in there, and nobody would tell me.
p23
aVSo I put it through a G.C., a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office,
p24
aVand it\u2019s about 400.
p25
aVSo what you\u2019re smelling is several hundred molecules
p26
aVfloating through the air, hitting your nose.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd do not get the impression that this is very subjective.
p29
aVYou are all smelling pretty much the same thing, OK?
p30
aVSmell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person.
p31
aVIt\u2019s not really true.
p32
aVAnd perfumery shows you that can\u2019t be true,
p33
aVbecause if it were like that it wouldn\u2019t be an art, OK?
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, while the smell wafts over you, let me tell you the history of an idea.
p36
aVEverything that you\u2019re smelling in here
p37
aVis made up of atoms that come from what I call
p38
aVthe Upper East Side of the periodic table \u2014 a nice, safe neighborhood.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVYou really don\u2019t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery.
p41
aVSome people have tried in the 1920s
p42
aVto add things from the bad parts, and it didn\u2019t really work.
p43
aa(lp44
VThese are the five atoms from which just about everything
p45
aVthat you\u2019re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of.
p46
aVThe top note that you smelled at the very beginning,
p47
aVthe cut-grass green, what we call in perfumery \u2014 they\u2019re weird terms \u2014
p48
aVand this would be called a green note,
p49
aVbecause it smells of something green, like cut grass.
p50
aa(lp51
VThis is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly
p52
aVin the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education.
p53
aVThis has six carbon atoms, so "hexa," hexene-1-ol.
p54
aVIt has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end,
p55
aVso it\u2019s "ol," and that\u2019s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol.
p56
aVOnce you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.
p57
aa(lp58
VThis smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.
p59
aVIf you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms \u2014
p60
aVthat\u2019s what it looks like when you have it on your computer \u2014
p61
aVbut actually it\u2019s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain
p62
aVsphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.
p63
aa(lp64
VOK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?
p65
aVWhy doesn\u2019t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories.
p66
aVBut the first theory is: it must be the shape.
p67
aVAnd that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that
p68
aValmost everything else in biology works by shape.
p69
aVEnzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it\u2019s all, you know,
p70
aVthe fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell.
p71
aVAnd I will try and explain to you what\u2019s wrong with this notion.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations.
p74
aVNow, this is a totally insane idea.
p75
aVAnd when I first came across it in the early '90s, I thought my predecessor,
p76
aVMalcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses,
p77
aVand I\u2019ll explain to you why this was the case.
p78
aVHowever, I came to realize gradually that they may be right \u2014
p79
aVand I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I\u2019m working on it.
p80
aa(lp81
VHere\u2019s how shape works in normal receptors.
p82
aVYou have a molecule coming in, it gets into the protein, which is schematic here,
p83
aVand it causes this thing to switch, to turn, to move in some way
p84
aVby binding in certain parts.
p85
aVAnd the attraction, the forces, between the molecule and the protein
p86
aVcause the motion. This is a shape-based idea.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, what\u2019s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide.
p89
aVThe way \u2014I expect everybody to memorize these compounds.
p90
aVThis is one page of work from a chemist\u2019s workbook, OK?
p91
aVWorking for a fragrance company.
p92
aVHe\u2019s making 45 molecules, and he\u2019s looking for a sandalwood,
p93
aVsomething that smells of sandalwood.
p94
aVBecause there\u2019s a lot of money in sandalwoods.
p95
aVAnd of these 45 molecules, only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood.
p96
aVAnd he puts an exclamation mark, OK? This is an awful lot of work.
p97
aVThis actually is roughly, in man-years of work, 200,000 dollars roughly,
p98
aVif you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits.
p99
aVSo this is a profoundly inefficient process.
p100
aVAnd my definition of a theory is, it\u2019s not just something
p101
aVthat you teach people; it\u2019s labor saving.
p102
aVA theory is something that enables you to do less work.
p103
aVI love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why \u2014 a very simple fact
p104
aVthat tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well.
p105
aa(lp106
VThis is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. It smells of cut grass.
p107
aVThis is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK?
p108
aVNow, you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs.
p109
aVIf it does, you put the glass down, you go to a different bar.
p110
aVThis is \u2014 in other words, we never get the O-H \u2014
p111
aVwe never mistake it for an S-H, OK?
p112
aVLike, at no concentration, even pure, you know,
p113
aVif you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn\u2019t smell of rotten eggs.
p114
aVConversely, there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka.
p115
aVIt\u2019s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition.
p116
aVNow, I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste
p117
aVfor biology, and he says, "That\u2019s easy! The things are a different color!"
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VWe have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has
p121
aVsome sort of interest in it. These molecules, as you saw in the beginning,
p122
aVthe building blocks had springs connecting them to each other.
p123
aVIn fact, molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies
p124
aVwhich are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo this is the sound of the O-H stretch, translated into the audible range.
p127
aVS-H, quite a different frequency.
p128
aVNow, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you
p129
aVthat you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this:
p130
aVnothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK?
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, Fact B: nothing in the world has that frequency except S-H.
p133
aVIf you look on this, imagine a piano keyboard.
p134
aVThe S-H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard
p135
aVthat has been, so to speak, damaged,
p136
aVand there are no neighboring notes, nothing is close to it.
p137
aVYou have a unique smell, a unique vibration.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo I went searching when I started in this game
p140
aVto convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility
p141
aVto this whole crazy story.
p142
aVI went searching for a type of molecule, any molecule,
p143
aVthat would have that vibration and that \u2014 the obvious prediction
p144
aVwas that it should absolutely smell of sulfur.
p145
aVIf it didn\u2019t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, after searching high and low for several months,
p148
aVI discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane
p149
aVwhich has exactly the same vibration.
p150
aVNow the good news is, Boranes you can get hold of.
p151
aVThe bad news is they\u2019re rocket fuels.
p152
aVMost of them explode spontaneously in contact with air,
p153
aVand when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK?
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVSo this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment,
p156
aVand they wouldn\u2019t have liked it at my college.
p157
aa(lp158
VHowever, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast.
p159
aVAnd it really does have the same \u2014 if you calculate,
p160
aVif you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature,
p163
aVthere\u2019s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone
p164
aValive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them.
p165
aVAnd in an enormous 40-page paper in German he says, at one point \u2014
p166
aVmy wife is German and she translated it for me \u2014
p167
aVand at one point he says, "ganz widerlich Geruch,"
p168
aVan "absolutely repulsive smell," which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide.
p169
aVSo this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur
p170
aVhad been known since 1910, and utterly forgotten until 1997, 1998.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, the slight fly in the ointment is this: that
p173
aVif we smell molecular vibrations, we must have a spectroscope in our nose.
p174
aVNow, this is a spectroscope, OK, on my laboratory bench.
p175
aVAnd it\u2019s fair to say that if you look up somebody\u2019s nose,
p176
aVyou\u2019re unlikely to see anything resembling this.
p177
aVAnd this is the main objection to the theory.
p178
aa(lp179
VOK, great, we smell vibrations. How? All right?
p180
aVNow when people ask this kind of question, they neglect something,
p181
aVwhich is that physicists are really clever, unlike biologists.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVThis is a joke. I\u2019m a biologist, OK?
p184
aVSo it\u2019s a joke against myself.
p185
aa(lp186
VBob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company,
p187
aVin the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money
p188
aVon fundamental research, discovered a way
p189
aVto build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale.
p190
aVIn other words, no mirrors, no lasers, no prisms, no nonsense,
p191
aVjust a tiny device, and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling.
p192
aVNow, I could do the dance of electron tunneling,
p193
aVbut I\u2019ve done a video instead, which is much more interesting. Here\u2019s how it works.
p194
aa(lp195
VElectrons are fuzzy creatures, and they can jump across gaps,
p196
aVbut only at equal energy. If the energy differs, they can\u2019t jump.
p197
aVUnlike us, they won\u2019t fall off the cliff.
p198
aVOK. Now. If something absorbs the energy, the electron can travel.
p199
aVSo here you have a system, you have something \u2014
p200
aVand there\u2019s plenty of that stuff in biology \u2014
p201
aVsome substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump,
p202
aVand only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration
p203
aVdoes the reaction happen, OK?
p204
aVThis is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology.
p207
aVIn other words, I\u2019ve taken off-the-shelf components,
p208
aVand I\u2019ve made a spectroscope.
p209
aVWhat\u2019s nice about this idea, if you have a philosophical bent of mind,
p210
aVis that then it tells you that the nose,
p211
aVthe ear and the eye are all vibrational senses.
p212
aVOf course, it doesn\u2019t matter, because it could also be that they\u2019re not.
p213
aVBut it has a certain \u2014
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aV\u2014 it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people
p216
aVwho read too much 19th-century German literature.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd then a magnificent thing happened:
p219
aVI left academia and joined the real world of business,
p220
aVand a company was created around my ideas
p221
aVto make new molecules using my method,
p222
aValong the lines of, let\u2019s put someone else\u2019s money where your mouth is.
p223
aVAnd one of the first things that happened was
p224
aVwe started going around to fragrance companies
p225
aVasking for what they needed, because, of course,
p226
aVif you could calculate smell, you don\u2019t need chemists.
p227
aVYou need a computer, a Mac will do it, if you know how to program the thing right,
p228
aVOK? So you can try a thousand molecules,
p229
aVyou can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend,
p230
aVand then you only tell the chemists to make the right one.
p231
aVAnd so that\u2019s a direct path to making new odorants.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd one of the first things that happened was
p234
aVwe went to see some perfumers in France \u2014
p235
aVand here\u2019s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression \u2014
p236
aVand one of them says, "You cannot make a coumarin."
p237
aVHe says to me, "I bet you cannot make a coumarin."
p238
aa(lp239
VNow, coumarin is a very common thing, a material,
p240
aVin fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America.
p241
aVAnd it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK?
p242
aVIt\u2019s the molecule that has made men\u2019s fragrances
p243
aVsmell the way they do since 1881, to be exact.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd the problem is it\u2019s a carcinogen.
p246
aVSo nobody likes particularly to \u2014 you know, aftershave with carcinogens.
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVThere are some reckless people, but it\u2019s not worth it, OK?
p249
aa(lp250
VSo they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations.
p251
aVAnd the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum
p252
aVof coumarin, and you smooth it out,
p253
aVso that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is.
p254
aVAnd then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules,
p255
aVrelated or unrelated, that have the same vibrations.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd we actually, in this case, I\u2019m sorry to say,
p258
aVit happened \u2014 it was serendipitous.
p259
aVBecause I got a phone call from our chief chemist
p260
aVand he said, look, I\u2019ve just found this such a beautiful reaction,
p261
aVthat even if this compound doesn\u2019t smell of coumarin,
p262
aVI want to do it, it\u2019s just such a nifty,
p263
aVone step \u2014 I mean, chemists have weird minds \u2014
p264
aVone step, 90 percent yield, you know, and you get this lovely
p265
aVcrystalline compound. Let us try it.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd I said, first of all, let me do the calculation on that compound, bottom right,
p268
aVwhich is related to coumarin, but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule.
p269
aVCalculate the vibrations, the purple spectrum is that new fellow,
p270
aVthe white one is the old one.
p271
aVAnd the prediction is it should smell of coumarin.
p272
aVThey made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin.
p273
aVAnd this is our new baby, called tonkene.
p274
aVYou see, when you\u2019re a scientist, you\u2019re always selling ideas.
p275
aVAnd people are very resistant to ideas, and rightly so.
p276
aVWhy should new ideas be accepted?
p277
aVBut when you put a little 10-gram vial on the table in front of perfumers
p278
aVand it smells like coumarin, and it isn\u2019t coumarin,
p279
aVand you\u2019ve found it in three weeks,
p280
aVthis focuses everybody\u2019s mind wonderfully.
p281
aV(Laughter)
p282
aV(Applause)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd people often ask me, is your theory accepted?
p285
aVAnd I said, well, by whom? I mean most, you know \u2014 there\u2019s three attitudes:
p286
aVYou\u2019re right, and I don\u2019t know why, which is the most rational one at this point.
p287
aVYou\u2019re right, and I don\u2019t care how you do it, in a sense;
p288
aVyou bring me the molecules, you know.
p289
aVAnd: You\u2019re completely wrong, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re completely wrong.
p290
aa(lp291
VOK? Now, we\u2019re dealing with people who only want results,
p292
aVand this is the commercial world.
p293
aVAnd they tell us that even if we do it by astrology, they\u2019re happy.
p294
aVBut we\u2019re not actually doing it by astrology.
p295
aVBut for the last three years, I\u2019ve had what I consider to be
p296
aVthe best job in the entire universe, which is to put my hobby \u2014
p297
aVwhich is, you know, fragrance and all the magnificent things \u2014
p298
aVplus a little bit of biophysics, a small amount of self-taught chemistry
p299
aVat the service of something that actually works.
p300
aa(lp301
VThank you very much.

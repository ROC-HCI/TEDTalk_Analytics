VAs a scientist, and also as a human being,
p5
aVI've been trying to make myself
p6
aVsusceptible to wonder.
p7
aVI think Jason Webley last night called it
p8
aV"conspiring to be part of the magic."
p9
aVSo it's fortunate that my career as a biologist
p10
aVlets me dive deeply into the lives
p11
aVof some truly wondrous creatures
p12
aVthat share our planet:
p13
aVfireflies.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, for many of you, I know that fireflies
p16
aVmight conjure up some really great memories:
p17
aVchildhood, summertime,
p18
aVeven other TED Talks.
p19
aVMaybe something like this.
p20
aa(lp21
VMy seduction into the world of fireflies
p22
aVbegan when I was back in graduate school.
p23
aVOne evening, I was sitting out in my backyard
p24
aVin North Carolina,
p25
aVand suddenly, these silent sparks
p26
aVrose up all around me,
p27
aVand I began to wonder:
p28
aVHow do these creatures make light,
p29
aVand what's with all this flashing?
p30
aVAre they talking to one another?
p31
aVAnd what happens after the lights go out?
p32
aVI've been lucky enough to answer
p33
aVsome of these questions
p34
aVas I've explored this nocturnal world.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow if you've ever seen
p37
aVor even heard about fireflies,
p38
aVthen you'll know how magically they can transform
p39
aVour everyday landscape into something
p40
aVethereal and otherworldly,
p41
aVand this happens around the globe,
p42
aVlike this hillside in the Smoky Mountains
p43
aVthat I saw transformed into a living cascade of light
p44
aVby the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies,
p45
aVor a roadside river that I visited in Japan
p46
aVas it was giving birth to the slow, floating flashes
p47
aVof these Genji fireflies,
p48
aVor in Malaysia, the mangrove trees
p49
aVthat I watched blossom nightly
p50
aVnot with flowers
p51
aVbut with the lights of a thousand \u2014  (Bleep! Bleep!) \u2014 fireflies,
p52
aVall blinking together
p53
aVin stunning synchrony.
p54
aVThese luminous landscapes
p55
aVstill fill me with wonder,
p56
aVand they keep me connected to the magic
p57
aVof the natural world.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd I find it amazing that they're created
p60
aVby these tiny insects.
p61
aVIn person, fireflies are charming.
p62
aVThey're charismatic.
p63
aVThey've been celebrated in art
p64
aVand in poetry for centuries.
p65
aVAs I've traveled around the world,
p66
aVI've met many thoughtful people
p67
aVwho have told me that God put fireflies on Earth
p68
aVfor humans to enjoy.
p69
aVOther creatures can enjoy them too.
p70
aVI think these graceful insects are truly miraculous
p71
aVbecause they so beautifully illuminate
p72
aVthe creative improvisation of evolution.
p73
aVThey've been shaped by two powerful
p74
aVevolutionary forces:
p75
aVnatural selection, the struggle for survival,
p76
aVand sexual selection,
p77
aVthe struggle for reproductive opportunity.
p78
aVAs a firefly junkie, the past 20 years
p79
aVhave been quite an exciting ride.
p80
aVTogether with my students at Tufts University
p81
aVand other colleagues,
p82
aVwe've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies:
p83
aVtheir courtship and sex lives,
p84
aVtheir treachery and murder.
p85
aVSo today I'd like to share with you
p86
aVjust a couple of tales that we've brought back
p87
aVfrom our collective adventures
p88
aVinto this hidden world.
p89
aa(lp90
VFireflies belong to a very beautiful
p91
aVand diverse group of insects, the beetles.
p92
aVWorldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species,
p93
aVand these have evolved remarkably diverse
p94
aVcourtship signals,
p95
aVthat is, different ways to find and attract mates.
p96
aVAround 150 million years ago,
p97
aVthe very first fireflies probably looked like this.
p98
aVThey flew during the daytime
p99
aVand they didn't light up.
p100
aVInstead, males used their fantastic antennae
p101
aVto sniff out perfumes given off by their females.
p102
aVIn other fireflies, it's only the females who light up.
p103
aVThey are attractively plump and wingless,
p104
aVso every night, they climb up onto perches
p105
aVand they glow brightly for hours
p106
aVto attract their flying but unlit males.
p107
aVIn still other fireflies, both sexes
p108
aVuse quick, bright flashes to find their mates.
p109
aVHere in North America,
p110
aVwe have more than 100 different kinds of firefly
p111
aVthat have the remarkable ability to shine energy
p112
aVout from their bodies
p113
aVin the form of light.
p114
aVHow do they do that?
p115
aVIt seems totally magical,
p116
aVbut these bioluminescent signals
p117
aVarise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions
p118
aVthat happen inside the firefly lantern.
p119
aVThe main star is an enzyme called luciferase,
p120
aVwhich in the course of evolution
p121
aVhas figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms
p122
aVaround an even smaller molecule called luciferin,
p123
aVin the process getting it so excited
p124
aVthat it actually gives off light.
p125
aVIncredible.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut how could these bright lights
p128
aVhave benefited some proto-firefly?
p129
aVTo answer this question, we need to flip back
p130
aVin the family album to some baby pictures.
p131
aVFireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow.
p132
aVThey spend the vast majority of their lifetime,
p133
aVup to two years,
p134
aVin this larval form.
p135
aVTheir main goal here, like my teenagers,
p136
aVis to eat and grow.
p137
aVAnd firefly light first originated
p138
aVin these juveniles.
p139
aVEvery single firefly larva can light up,
p140
aVeven when their adults can't.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut what's the point
p143
aVto being so conspicuous?
p144
aVWell, we know that these juveniles
p145
aVmake nasty-tasting chemicals
p146
aVthat help them survive their extended childhood,
p147
aVso we think these lights first evolved as a warning,
p148
aVa neon sign that says, "Toxic! Stay away!"
p149
aVto any would-be predators.
p150
aVIt took many millions of years
p151
aVbefore these bright lights
p152
aVevolved into a smart communication tool
p153
aVthat could be used not just to ward off potential predators
p154
aVbut to bring in potential mates.
p155
aVDriven now by sexual selection,
p156
aVsome adult fireflies
p157
aVlike this proud male
p158
aVevolved a shiny new glow-in-the-dark lantern
p159
aVthat would let them take courtship
p160
aVto a whole new level.
p161
aVThese adults only live a few weeks,
p162
aVand now they're single-mindedly focused on sex,
p163
aVthat is, on propelling their genes
p164
aVinto the next firefly generation.
p165
aVSo we can follow this male out into the field
p166
aVas he joins hundreds of other males
p167
aVwho are all showing off their new courtship signals.
p168
aVIt's amazing to think that the luminous displays
p169
aVwe admire
p170
aVhere and in fact everywhere around the world
p171
aVare actually the silent love songs
p172
aVof male fireflies.
p173
aVThey're flying and flashing their hearts out.
p174
aVI still find it very romantic.
p175
aa(lp176
VBut meanwhile, where are all the females?
p177
aVWell, they're lounging down below
p178
aVsurveying their options.
p179
aVThey have plenty of males to choose from,
p180
aVand these females turn out to be very picky.
p181
aVWhen a female sees a flash
p182
aVfrom an especially attractive male,
p183
aVshe'll aim her lantern in his direction,
p184
aVand give him a flash back.
p185
aVIt's her "come hither" sign.
p186
aVSo he flies closer and he flashes again.
p187
aVIf she still likes him,
p188
aVthey'll strike up a conversation.
p189
aVThese creatures speak their love
p190
aVin the language of light.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo what exactly do these females consider sexy?
p193
aVWe decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls
p194
aVto find out.
p195
aVWhen we tested females using blinking LED lights,
p196
aVwe discovered they prefer males
p197
aVwho give longer-lasting flashes.
p198
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p199
aVI know you're wondering,
p200
aVwhat gives these males their sex appeal?
p201
aVNow we get to see what happens
p202
aVwhen the lights go out.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe first thing we discovered
p205
aVis that once a male and female hook up like this,
p206
aVthey stay together all night long,
p207
aVand when we looked inside
p208
aVto see what might be happening,
p209
aVwe discovered a surprising new twist
p210
aVto firefly sex.
p211
aVWhile they're mating,
p212
aVthe male is busy giving the female
p213
aVnot just his sperm
p214
aVbut also a nutrient-filled package
p215
aVcalled a nuptial gift.
p216
aVWe can zoom in to look more closely
p217
aVinside this mating pair.
p218
aVWe can actually see the gift \u2014
p219
aVit's shown here in red \u2014
p220
aVas it's being passed from the male to the female.
p221
aVWhat makes this gift so valuable
p222
aVis that it's packed with protein
p223
aVthat the female will use to provision her eggs.
p224
aVSo females are keeping their eyes on this prize
p225
aVas they size up potential mates.
p226
aVWe discovered that females use male flash signals
p227
aVto try to predict which males
p228
aVhave the biggest gifts to offer,
p229
aVbecause this bling helps the female lay more eggs
p230
aVand ultimately launch more of her own offspring
p231
aVinto the next generation.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo it's not all sweetness and light.
p234
aVFirefly romance is risky.
p235
aVFor the most part, these adult fireflies
p236
aVdon't get eaten because like their juveniles
p237
aVthey can manufacture toxins that are repellent
p238
aVto birds and other insectivores,
p239
aVbut somewhere along the line,
p240
aVone particular group of fireflies
p241
aVsomehow lost the metabolic machinery
p242
aVneeded to make their own protective toxins.
p243
aVThis evolutionary flaw,
p244
aVwhich was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner,
p245
aVhas driven these fireflies
p246
aVto take their bright lights out into the night
p247
aVwith treacherous intent.
p248
aVDubbed "femme fatales"
p249
aVby Jim Lloyd, another colleague,
p250
aVthese females have figured out how to target
p251
aVthe males of other firefly species.
p252
aVSo the hunt begins with the predator \u2014
p253
aVshe's shown here in the lower left \u2014
p254
aVwhere she's sitting quietly
p255
aVand eavesdropping on the courtship conversation
p256
aVof her intended prey,
p257
aVand here's how it might go.
p258
aVFirst the prey male flashes, "Do you love me?"
p259
aVHis own female responds, "Maybe."
p260
aVSo then he flashes again.
p261
aVBut this time, the predator sneaks in a reply
p262
aVthat cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said.
p263
aVShe's not looking for love: she's looking for toxins.
p264
aVIf she's good, she can lure this male close enough
p265
aVto reach out and grab him,
p266
aVand he's not just a light snack.
p267
aVOver the next hour, she slowly
p268
aVexsanguinates this male
p269
aVleaving behind just some gory remains.
p270
aVUnable to make their own toxins,
p271
aVthese females resort to drinking the blood
p272
aVof other fireflies to get these protective chemicals.
p273
aVSo a firefly vampire,
p274
aVbrought to you by natural selection.
p275
aa(lp276
VWe still have a lot to learn about fireflies,
p277
aVbut it looks like many stories will remain untold,
p278
aVbecause around the world, firefly populations
p279
aVare blinking out.
p280
aVThe main culprit: habitat loss.
p281
aVPretty much everywhere, the fields and forests,
p282
aVthe mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive,
p283
aVare giving way to development and to sprawl.
p284
aa(lp285
VHere's another problem: we've conquered darkness,
p286
aVbut in the process, we spill so much extra light out into the night
p287
aVthat it disrupts the lives of other creatures,
p288
aVand fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution
p289
aVbecause it obscures the signals
p290
aVthat they use to find their mates.
p291
aa(lp292
VDo we really need fireflies?
p293
aVAfter all, they're just one tiny bit
p294
aVof Earth's biodiversity.
p295
aVYet every time a species is lost,
p296
aVit's like extinguishing a room full of candles
p297
aVone by one.
p298
aVYou might not notice
p299
aVwhen the first few flames flicker out,
p300
aVbut in the end, you're left sitting in darkness.
p301
aVAs we work together to craft a planetary future,
p302
aVI hope we can find a way
p303
aVto keep these bright lights shining.
p304
aa(lp305
VThank you.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Applause)

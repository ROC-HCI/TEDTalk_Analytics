VWhen we use the word "architect" or "designer,"
p5
aVwhat we usually mean is a professional,
p6
aVsomeone who gets paid,
p7
aVand we tend to assume that it's those professionals
p8
aVwho are going to be the ones to help us solve
p9
aVthe really big, systemic design challenges that we face
p10
aVlike climate change, urbanization and social inequality.
p11
aVThat's our kind of working presumption.
p12
aVAnd I think it's wrong, actually.
p13
aa(lp14
VIn 2008, I was just about to graduate from architecture school
p15
aVafter several years, and go out and get a job,
p16
aVand this happened.
p17
aVThe economy ran out of jobs.
p18
aVAnd a couple of things struck me about this.
p19
aVOne, don't listen to career advisers.
p20
aVAnd two, actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture,
p21
aVwhich is that, as a society, we've never needed design thinking more,
p22
aVand yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed.
p23
aVIt strikes me that we talk very deeply about design,
p24
aVbut actually there's an economics behind architecture
p25
aVthat we don't talk about, and I think we need to.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd a good place to start is your own paycheck.
p28
aVSo, as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate,
p29
aVI might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds.
p30
aVThat's about 36,000, 37,000 dollars.
p31
aVNow in terms of the whole world's population,
p32
aVthat already puts me in the top 1.95 richest people,
p33
aVwhich raises the question of, who is it I'm working for?
p34
aVThe uncomfortable fact is that
p35
aVactually almost everything that we call architecture today
p36
aVis actually the business of designing
p37
aVfor about the richest one percent of the world's population,
p38
aVand it always has been.
p39
aVThe reason why we forgot that
p40
aVis because the times in history when architecture
p41
aVdid the most to transform society were those times
p42
aVwhen, actually, the one percent would build
p43
aVon behalf of the 99 percent, for various different reasons,
p44
aVwhether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century,
p45
aVcommunism in the early 20th,
p46
aVthe welfare state, and most recently, of course,
p47
aVthrough this inflated real estate bubble.
p48
aVAnd all of those booms, in their own various ways,
p49
aVhave now kicked the bucket,
p50
aVand we're back in this situation
p51
aVwhere the smartest designers and architects in the world
p52
aVare only really able to work for one percent of the population.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow it's not just that that's bad for democracy,
p55
aVthough I think it probably is,
p56
aVit's actually not a very clever business strategy, actually.
p57
aVI think the challenge facing the next generation of architects
p58
aVis, how are we going to turn our client
p59
aVfrom the one percent to the 100 percent?
p60
aVAnd I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas
p61
aVfor how it might be done.
p62
aa(lp63
VThe first is, I think we need to question this idea
p64
aVthat architecture is about making buildings.
p65
aVActually, a building is about the most expensive solution
p66
aVyou can think of to almost any given problem.
p67
aVAnd fundamentally, design should be much, much more interested
p68
aVin solving problems and creating new conditions.
p69
aVSo here's a story.
p70
aVThe office was working with a school,
p71
aVand they had an old Victorian school building.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd they said to the architects, "Look,
p74
aVour corridors are an absolute nightmare.
p75
aVThey're far too small. They get congested between classes.
p76
aVThere's bullying. We can't control them.
p77
aVSo what we want you to do is re-plan our entire building,
p78
aVand we know it's going to cost several million pounds,
p79
aVbut we're reconciled to the fact."
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd the team thought about this, and they went away,
p82
aVand they said, "Actually, don't do that.
p83
aVInstead, get rid of the school bell.
p84
aVAnd instead of having one school bell that goes off once,
p85
aVhave several smaller school bells that go off
p86
aVin different places and different times,
p87
aVdistribute the traffic through the corridors."
p88
aVIt solves the same problem,
p89
aVbut instead of spending several million pounds,
p90
aVyou spend several hundred pounds.
p91
aVNow, it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job,
p92
aVbut you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful.
p93
aVArchitects are actually really, really good
p94
aVat this kind of resourceful, strategic thinking.
p95
aVAnd the problem is that, like a lot of design professions,
p96
aVwe got fixated on the idea of providing
p97
aVa particular kind of consumer product,
p98
aVand I don't think that needs to be the case anymore.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe second idea worth questioning is this 20th-century thing
p101
aVthat mass architecture is about big \u2014
p102
aVbig buildings and big finance.
p103
aVActually, we've got ourselves locked into this
p104
aVIndustrial Era mindset which says that
p105
aVthe only people who can make cities are large organizations
p106
aVor corporations who build on our behalf,
p107
aVprocuring whole neighborhoods
p108
aVin single, monolithic projects, and of course,
p109
aVform follows finance.
p110
aVSo what you end up with are single, monolithic neighborhoods
p111
aVbased on this kind of one-size-fits-all model.
p112
aVAnd a lot of people can't even afford them.
p113
aVBut what if, actually, it's possible now for cities
p114
aVto be made not just by the few with a lot
p115
aVbut also by the many with a bit?
p116
aVAnd when they do, they bring with them
p117
aVa completely different set of values about the place that they want to live.
p118
aVAnd it raises really interesting questions about,
p119
aVhow will we plan cities? How will finance development?
p120
aVHow will we sell design services?
p121
aVWhat would it mean for democratic societies
p122
aVto offer their citizens a right to build?
p123
aVAnd in a way it should be kind of obvious, right,
p124
aVthat in the 21st century, maybe cities can be developed by citizens.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd thirdly, we need to remember that,
p127
aVfrom a strictly economic point of view,
p128
aVdesign shares a category with sex and care of the elderly \u2014
p129
aVmostly it's done by amateurs.
p130
aVAnd that's a good thing.
p131
aVMost of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy
p132
aVin what's called the social economy or the core economy,
p133
aVwhich is people doing it for themselves.
p134
aVAnd the problem is that, up until now,
p135
aVit was the monetary economy which had
p136
aVall the infrastructure and all the tools.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo the challenge we face is, how are we going
p139
aVto build the tools, the infrastructure and the institutions
p140
aVfor architecture's social economy?
p141
aVAnd that began with open-source software.
p142
aVAnd over the last few years, it's been moving
p143
aVinto the physical world with open-source hardware,
p144
aVwhich are freely shared blueprints
p145
aVthat anyone can download and make for themselves.
p146
aVAnd that's where 3D printing gets really, really interesting.
p147
aVRight? When suddenly you had a 3D printer
p148
aVthat was open-source, the parts for which
p149
aVcould be made on another 3D printer.
p150
aVOr the same idea here, which is for a CNC machine,
p151
aVwhich is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood.
p152
aVWhat these technologies are doing is radically
p153
aVlowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill.
p154
aVThey're challenging the idea that
p155
aVif you want something to be affordable it's got to be one-size-fits-all.
p156
aVAnd they're distributing massively
p157
aVreally complex manufacturing capabilities.
p158
aVWe're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere,
p159
aVand increasingly that means
p160
aVthat the design team is everyone.
p161
aVThat really is an industrial revolution.
p162
aVAnd when we think that the major ideological conflicts
p163
aVthat we inherited were all based around this question
p164
aVof who should control the means of production,
p165
aVand these technologies are coming back with a solution:
p166
aVactually, maybe no one. All of us.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd we were fascinated by
p169
aVwhat that might mean for architecture.
p170
aVSo about a year and a half ago,
p171
aVwe started working on a project called WikiHouse,
p172
aVand WikiHouse is an open-source construction system.
p173
aVAnd the idea is to make it possible for anyone
p174
aVto go online, access a freely shared library
p175
aVof 3D models which they can download and adapt in,
p176
aVat the moment, SketchUp, because it's free, and it's easy to use,
p177
aVand almost at the click of a switch
p178
aVthey can generate a set of cutting files
p179
aVwhich allow them, in effect,
p180
aVto print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine
p181
aVand a standard sheet material like plywood.
p182
aVAnd the parts are all numbered,
p183
aVand basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVAnd it goes together without any bolts.
p186
aVIt uses wedge and peg connections.
p187
aVAnd even the mallets to make it
p188
aVcan be provided on the cutting sheets as well.
p189
aVAnd a team of about two or three people,
p190
aVworking together, can build this.
p191
aVThey don't need any traditional construction skills.
p192
aVThey don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that,
p193
aVand they can build a small house of about this size
p194
aVin about a day.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Applause)
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house
p199
aVonto which you can then apply systems like windows
p200
aVand cladding and insulation and services
p201
aVbased on what's cheap and what's available.
p202
aVOf course, the house is never finished.
p203
aVWe're shifting our heads here, so the house is not a finished product.
p204
aVWith the CNC machine, you can make new parts for it
p205
aVover its life or even use it to make the house next door.
p206
aVSo we can begin to see the seed of a completely open-source,
p207
aVcitizen-led urban development model, potentially.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now,
p210
aVand some really interesting lessons here.
p211
aVOne of them is that it's always incredibly sociable.
p212
aVPeople get confused between construction work and having fun.
p213
aVBut the principles of openness go right down
p214
aVinto the really mundane, physical details.
p215
aVLike, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.
p216
aVOr, when you're designing a piece,
p217
aVmake sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round,
p218
aVor, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical.
p219
aVProbably the principal which runs deepest with us
p220
aVis the principal set out by Linus Torvalds,
p221
aVthe open-source pioneer,
p222
aVwhich was that idea of, "Be lazy like a fox."
p223
aVDon't reinvent the wheel every time.
p224
aVTake what already works, and adapt it for your own needs.
p225
aVContrary to almost everything that you might get taught
p226
aVat an architecture school, copying is good.
p227
aa(lp228
VWhich is appropriate, because actually,
p229
aVthis approach is not innovative.
p230
aVIt's actually how we built buildings
p231
aVfor hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution
p232
aVin these sorts of community barn-raisings.
p233
aVThe only difference between traditional
p234
aVvernacular architecture and open-source architecture
p235
aVmight be a web connection,
p236
aVbut it's a really, really big difference.
p237
aVWe shared the whole of WikiHouse
p238
aVunder a Creative Commons license,
p239
aVand now what's just beginning to happen
p240
aVis that groups around the world are beginning to take it
p241
aVand use it and hack it and tinker with it, and it's amazing.
p242
aVThere's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand
p243
aVlooking at post-earthquake development housing,
p244
aVand thanks to the TED city Prize,
p245
aVwe're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas
p246
aVto set up a kind of community factory
p247
aVand micro-university.
p248
aVThese are very, very small beginnings,
p249
aVand actually there's more people in the last week
p250
aVwho have got in touch and they're not even on this map.
p251
aVI hope next time you see it, you won't even be able to see the map.
p252
aa(lp253
VWe're aware that WikiHouse is a very, very small answer,
p254
aVbut it's a small answer to a really, really big question,
p255
aVwhich is that globally, right now, the fastest-growing cities
p256
aVare not skyscraper cities.
p257
aVThey're self-made cities in one form or another.
p258
aVIf we're talking about the 21st-century city,
p259
aVthese are the guys who are going to be making it.
p260
aVYou know, like it or not, welcome to the world's biggest design team.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo if we're serious about problems
p263
aVlike climate change, urbanization and health,
p264
aVactually, our existing development models aren't going to do it.
p265
aVAs I think Robert Neuwirth said, there isn't a bank
p266
aVor a corporation or a government or an NGO
p267
aVwho's going to be able to do it
p268
aVif we treat citizens only as consumers.
p269
aVHow extraordinary would it be, though, if collectively
p270
aVwe were to develop solutions not just to the problem
p271
aVof structure that we've been working on,
p272
aVbut to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning,
p273
aVoff-grid energy, off-grid sanitation \u2014
p274
aVlow-cost, open-source, high-performance solutions
p275
aVthat anyone can very, very easily make,
p276
aVand to put them all into a commons
p277
aVwhere they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone?
p278
aVA kind of Wikipedia for stuff?
p279
aVAnd once something's in the commons,
p280
aVit will always be there.
p281
aVHow much would that change the rules?
p282
aVAnd I think the technology's on our side.
p283
aa(lp284
VIf design's great project in the 20th century
p285
aVwas the democratization of consumption \u2014
p286
aVthat was Henry Ford, Levittown, Coca-Cola, IKEA \u2014
p287
aVI think design's great project in the 21st century
p288
aVis the democratization of production.
p289
aVAnd when it comes to architecture in cities,
p290
aVthat really matters.
p291
aVThank you very much.

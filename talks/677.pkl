VI want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement,
p5
aVjust so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century
p6
aValso agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.
p7
aVHe said, "A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' \u2014
p8
aVa part limited in time and space.
p9
aVHe experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings,
p10
aVas something separated from the rest,
p11
aVa kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
p12
aVThis delusion is a kind of prison for us,
p13
aVrestricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.
p14
aVOur task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion,
p15
aVto embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."
p16
aa(lp17
VThis insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology,
p18
aVwherein compassion \u2014 "karuna," it is called \u2014
p19
aVis defined as, "the sensitivity to another's suffering
p20
aVand the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering."
p21
aVIt pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy,
p22
aVwhich requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself
p23
aVand wishes to share it.
p24
aVThis is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness
p25
aVand selfishness to compassion, the concern for others,
p26
aVand, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern
p27
aVsuffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free
p28
aVand, implicitly, more happy.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend.
p31
aVIt helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.
p32
aVCompassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering
p33
aVas the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had
p34
aVand broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others,
p35
aVeven of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.
p36
aVIn fact, suffering is so huge and enormous,
p37
aVhis own becomes less and less monumental.
p38
aVAnd he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others.
p39
aVAnd this immediately cheers him up,
p40
aVas his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion.
p41
aVThus, he uses his own suffering
p42
aVas a doorway to widening his circle of compassion.
p43
aVHe is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, I want to tell a story,
p46
aVwhich is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition,
p47
aVof the great Saint Asanga
p48
aVwho was a contemporary of Augustine in the West
p49
aVand was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine.
p50
aVAnd Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time.
p51
aVAnd he was discontented with the state of people's practice
p52
aVof the Buddhist religion in India at that time.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd so he said, "I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine.
p55
aVThey're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment,
p56
aVbut they are acting selfish and pathetic.
p57
aVSo, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.
p58
aVI know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now,
p59
aVbut exists currently in a certain heaven" \u2014 that's Maitreya \u2014
p60
aV"so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate
p61
aVand pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me,
p62
aVand gives me a teaching or something
p63
aVto revive the practice of compassion in the world today."
p64
aa(lp65
VSo he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years
p66
aVand he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.
p67
aVAnd he left in disgust.
p68
aVAnd as he was leaving, he saw a man \u2014
p69
aVa funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.
p70
aVAnd he had a lump of iron.
p71
aVAnd he was rubbing it with a cloth.
p72
aVAnd he became interested in that.
p73
aVHe said, "Well what are you doing?"
p74
aVAnd the man said, "I'm making a needle."
p75
aVAnd he said, "That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle
p76
aVby rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth."
p77
aVAnd the man said, "Really?" And he showed him a dish full of needles.
p78
aVSo he said, "Okay, I get the point."
p79
aVHe went back to his cave. He meditated again.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnother three years, no vision. He leaves again.
p82
aVThis time, he comes down.
p83
aVAnd as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.
p84
aVAnd where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff,
p85
aVits feathers brushes the rock \u2014 and it had cut the rock
p86
aVsix to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock
p87
aVby the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.
p88
aVSo he said, "All right. I get the point." He went back.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnother three years.
p91
aVAgain, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.
p92
aVAnd he again leaves, and this time: water dripping,
p93
aVmaking a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.
p94
aVAnd so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.
p95
aVAnd he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right
p96
aVto see any encouraging vision.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd he comes to the town. He's a broken person.
p99
aVAnd there, in the town, he's approached by a dog
p100
aVwho comes like this \u2014 one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries,
p101
aVeven in America, I think, in some areas \u2014
p102
aVand he's looking just terrible.
p103
aVAnd he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic,
p104
aVand it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.
p105
aVAnd the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.
p106
aVSome of it is like gangrenous,
p107
aVand there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible.
p108
aVHe thinks, "What can I do to fix up this dog?
p109
aVWell, at least I can clean this wound and wash it."
p110
aa(lp111
VSo, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean,
p112
aVbut then his awareness focuses on the maggots.
p113
aVAnd he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute.
p114
aVAnd they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.
p115
aV"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be?
p116
aVThat's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya,
p117
aVand everything is all hopeless.
p118
aVAnd now I'm going to kill the maggots?"
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, he had a brilliant idea.
p121
aVAnd he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh,
p122
aVand he placed it on ground.
p123
aVHe was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA.
p124
aVHe was just immediately caught with the situation.
p125
aVSo he thought, "I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh,
p126
aVthen clean the dog's wounds, and then
p127
aVI'll figure out what to do with the maggots."
p128
aa(lp129
VSo he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots.
p130
aVApparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots.
p131
aVSo he says, "Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh.
p132
aVAnd then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue" \u2014
p133
aVthe dog is kind of used up \u2014
p134
aV"and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing."
p135
aVSo he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this.
p136
aVAnd he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that.
p139
aVHe jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya
p140
aVin a beautiful vision \u2014 rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body,
p141
aVan exquisite mystic vision \u2014 that he sees.
p142
aVAnd he says, "Oh." He bows.
p143
aVBut, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo as he comes up from his first bow he says,
p146
aV"My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?
p147
aVWhat is this?"
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd Maitreya says, "I was with you. Who do you think was making needles
p150
aVand making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?"
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aV"Looking for the Buddha in person," he said.
p153
aVAnd he said, "You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion.
p154
aVAnd, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."
p155
aV"Maitreya" means love, "the loving one," in Sanskrit.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd so he looked very dubious, Asanga did.
p158
aVAnd he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you."
p159
aVAnd so he took the Maitreya \u2014 it shrunk into a globe, a ball \u2014
p160
aVtook him on his shoulder.
p161
aVAnd he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, "Rejoice! Rejoice!
p162
aVThe future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is."
p163
aVAnd then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him \u2014
p164
aVit wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town \u2014
p165
aVbecause they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man,
p166
aVlike some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder,
p167
aVshouting that the future Buddha had come.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, naturally, they chased him out of town.
p170
aVBut on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground,
p171
aVsaw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog,
p172
aVbut she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.
p173
aVSo that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.
p174
aa(lp175
VMaitreya then took him to a certain heaven,
p176
aVwhich is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.
p177
aVAnd Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years,
p178
aVdictating to him five complicated tomes
p179
aVof the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them.
p182
aVA famous one, it's called the "Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion."
p183
aVAnd it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one \u2014
p184
aVeven animals too, but everyone is in human form.
p185
aVThe animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.
p186
aVAnd then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.
p187
aVAnd you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.
p188
aVAnd then you try to say, "Well, the loved ones I love.
p189
aVBut, you know, after all, they're nice to me.
p190
aVI had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.
p191
aVI got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.
p192
aVSo, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.
p193
aVWhile the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.
p194
aVAnd then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.
p195
aVBut they are nice to somebody. I could be them."
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives,
p198
aVwe've all been each other's relatives, actually.
p199
aVTherefore all of you, in the Buddhist view,
p200
aVin some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I,
p201
aVhave been my mother \u2014 for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.
p202
aVAnd also, actually, I've been your mother.
p203
aVI've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life,
p204
aVthe way the Buddhists reflect.
p205
aVSo, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way
p206
aVare part of the eternal mother.
p207
aVYou gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful.
p208
aVSo, that's the way the Buddhists do it.
p209
aVA theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.
p210
aVSo, in that sense, we're related.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo, they first create this foundation of equality.
p213
aVSo, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love \u2014
p214
aVjust in the meditation \u2014 and we open our mind to those we don't know.
p215
aVAnd we definitely reduce the hostility and the "I don't want to be compassionate to them"
p216
aVto the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.
p217
aVAnd we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd then the next thing we do is what is called "mother recognition."
p220
aVAnd that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.
p221
aVWe expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama,
p222
aVand we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.
p223
aVAnd we see the mother in every being.
p224
aVWe see that look that the mother has on her face,
p225
aVlooking at this child that is a miracle
p226
aVthat she has produced from her own body, being a mammal,
p227
aVwhere she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.
p228
aVOften the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.
p229
aVAnd that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.
p230
aVThe mother is the model of all altruism for human beings,
p231
aVin spiritual traditions.
p232
aVAnd so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.
p233
aa(lp234
VPeople laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that
p235
aVI used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom,
p236
aVwhen, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq.
p237
aVI used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.
p238
aVHe has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms.
p239
aVAnd you think of him as nursing you.
p240
aVAnd then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem,
p241
aVbut you think of him as a mom.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you,
p244
aVand you see how they could be familiar to you.
p245
aVAnd you do that for a while, until you really feel that.
p246
aVYou can feel the familiarity of all beings.
p247
aVNobody seems alien. They're not "other."
p248
aVYou reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.
p249
aVThen you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general,
p250
aVif you can remember the kindness of your own mother,
p251
aVif you can remember the kindness of your spouse,
p252
aVor, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.
p253
aVAnd you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.
p254
aVYou will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.
p255
aVAnd then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.
p256
aVEvery being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd then, third, you step from there to what is called "a feeling of gratitude."
p259
aVYou want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.
p260
aVAnd then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love."
p261
aVIn each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days
p262
aVdepending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.
p263
aVAnd then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy,
p264
aVwhen they are satisfied.
p265
aVAnd every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.
p266
aVTheir face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being,
p267
aVbut when they're happy they look beautiful.
p268
aVAnd so you see beings in their potential happiness.
p269
aVAnd you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.
p270
aa(lp271
VWe think Jesus is being unrealistic
p272
aVwhen he says, "Love thine enemy."
p273
aVHe does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic
p274
aVand sort of spiritual and highfalutin. "Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that."
p275
aVBut, actually, that's practical.
p276
aVIf you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.
p277
aVIf your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?
p278
aVHow boring to run around chasing you.
p279
aVThey would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.
p280
aVSo it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy,
p281
aVbecause they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.
p282
aa(lp283
VBut anyway, that's the "lovely love. "
p284
aVAnd then finally, the fifth step is compassion, "universal compassion."
p285
aVAnd that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of.
p286
aVAnd you look at them, and you see how they are.
p287
aVAnd you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.
p288
aVYou see that furrowed brow in people.
p289
aVAnd then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves.
p290
aVThey're driven by this duty and this obligation.
p291
aV"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something."
p292
aVAnd they're rushing around all stressed out.
p293
aVAnd they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.
p294
aVBut actually they are cruel to themselves.
p295
aVAnd, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others.
p296
aVAnd they, then, never get any positive feedback.
p297
aVAnd the more they succeed and the more power they have,
p298
aVthe more unhappy they are.
p299
aVAnd this is where you feel real compassion for them.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd you then feel you must act.
p302
aVAnd the choice of the action, of course,
p303
aVhopefully will be more practical
p304
aVthan poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog
p305
aVbecause he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him,
p306
aVhe wanted to help.
p307
aVBut, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town
p308
aVand gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.
p309
aVAnd I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd so the next step \u2014 the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" \u2014
p312
aVis this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,
p313
aVand you have compassion for yourself also,
p314
aVand it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.
p315
aVSome bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy
p316
aVbeing more and more mean to other people
p317
aVand getting punished in the future for it in various ways.
p318
aVAnd in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.
p319
aVOf course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.
p320
aVAnd materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing,
p321
aVby dying, but they don't.
p322
aVAnd so they get reborn as whatever, you know.
p323
aa(lp324
VNever mind. I won't get into that.
p325
aVBut the next step is called "universal responsibility."
p326
aVAnd that is very important \u2014 the Charter of Compassion
p327
aVmust lead us to develop through true compassion,
p328
aVwhat is called "universal responsibility."
p329
aVIn the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama
p330
aVthat he always teaches everywhere, he says
p331
aVthat that is the common religion of humanity: kindness.
p332
aVBut "kindness" means "universal responsibility."
p333
aVAnd that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us:
p334
aVwe are responsible for that, and we should take it
p335
aVand do whatever we can at whatever little level
p336
aVand small level that we can do it.
p337
aVWe absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life
p340
aVwhere we live equally for ourselves and for others
p341
aVand we are
p342
aVjoyful and happy.
p343
aVOne thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable.
p344
aVCompassion makes you happy.
p345
aVThe first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself,
p346
aVeven if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else.
p347
aVAlthough, the change in your mind already does something for other beings:
p348
aVthey can sense this new quality in yourself,
p349
aVand it helps them already, and gives them an example.
p350
aa(lp351
VAnd that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it
p354
aVand develop it within yourself.
p355
aVDon't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate,"
p356
aVand sort of think you're stuck there.
p357
aVYou can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion,
p358
aVthe cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others,
p359
aVand take universal responsibility for them.
p360
aVAnd then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile,
p361
aVbut Karen Armstrong will smile.
p362
aa(lp363
VThank you very much. (Applause)

VOver our lifetimes,
p5
aVwe've all contributed to climate change.
p6
aVActions, choices and behaviors
p7
aVwill have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.
p8
aVAnd I think that that's quite a powerful thought.
p9
aVBut it does have the potential to make us feel guilty
p10
aVwhen we think about decisions we might have made
p11
aVaround where to travel to,
p12
aVhow often and how,
p13
aVabout the energy that we choose to use
p14
aVin our homes or in our workplaces,
p15
aVor quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy.
p16
aVBut we can also turn that thought on its head,
p17
aVand think that if we've had such a profound
p18
aVbut a negative impact on our climate already,
p19
aVthen we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change
p20
aVthat we will need to adapt to.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo we have a choice.
p23
aVWe can either choose to start to take climate change seriously,
p24
aVand significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions,
p25
aVand then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future.
p26
aVAlternatively, we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem.
p27
aVBut if we do that, we are also choosing
p28
aVto adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future.
p29
aVAnd not only that.
p30
aVAs people who live in countries with high per capita emissions,
p31
aVwe're making that choice on behalf of others as well.
p32
aVBut the choice that we don't have
p33
aVis a no climate change future.
p34
aa(lp35
VOver the last two decades,
p36
aVour government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together
p37
aVto discuss climate change,
p38
aVand they've been focused on avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming
p39
aVabove pre-industrial levels.
p40
aVThat's the temperature that's associated with dangerous impacts
p41
aVacross a range of different indicators,
p42
aVto humans and to the environment.
p43
aVSo two degrees centigrade constitutes dangerous climate change.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut dangerous climate change can be subjective.
p46
aVSo if we think about an extreme weather event
p47
aVthat might happen in some part of the world,
p48
aVand if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure,
p49
aVwhere there are people that are well-insured and so on,
p50
aVthen that impact can be disruptive.
p51
aVIt can cause upset, it could cause cost.
p52
aVIt could even cause some deaths.
p53
aVBut if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world
p54
aVwhere there is poor infrastructure,
p55
aVor where people are not well-insured,
p56
aVor they're not having good support networks,
p57
aVthen that same climate change impact could be devastating.
p58
aVIt could cause a significant loss of home,
p59
aVbut it could also cause significant amounts of death.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo this is a graph of the CO2 emissions at the left-hand side
p62
aVfrom fossil fuel and industry,
p63
aVand time from before the Industrial Revolution
p64
aVout towards the present day.
p65
aVAnd what's immediately striking about this
p66
aVis that emissions have been growing exponentially.
p67
aVIf we focus in on a shorter period of time from 1950,
p68
aVwe have established in 1988
p69
aVthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
p70
aVthe Rio Earth Summit in 1992,
p71
aVthen rolling on a few years, in 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord,
p72
aVwhere it established avoiding a two-degree temperature rise
p73
aVin keeping with the science and on the basis of equity.
p74
aVAnd then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event.
p75
aVAnd all the way through, during all of these meetings
p76
aVand many others as well,
p77
aVemissions have continued to rise.
p78
aVAnd if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years,
p79
aVand we put that together with our understanding
p80
aVof the direction of travel in our global economy,
p81
aVthen we are much more on track
p82
aVfor a four-degree centigrade global warming
p83
aVthan we are for the two-degree centigrade.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, let's just pause for a moment
p86
aVand think about this four-degree global average temperature.
p87
aVMost of our planet is actually made up of the sea.
p88
aVNow, because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land,
p89
aVthe average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher
p90
aVthan they are over the sea.
p91
aVThe second thing is that we as human beings don't experience
p92
aVglobal average temperatures.
p93
aVWe experience hot days, cold days,
p94
aVrainy days, especially if you live in Manchester like me.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo now put yourself in a city center.
p97
aVImagine somewhere in the world:
p98
aVMumbai, Beijing, New York, London.
p99
aVIt's the hottest day that you've ever experienced.
p100
aVThere's sun beating down,
p101
aVthere's concrete and glass all around you.
p102
aVNow imagine that same day \u2014
p103
aVbut it's six, eight, maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer
p104
aVon that day during that heat wave.
p105
aVThat's the kind of thing we're going to experience
p106
aVunder a four-degree global average temperature scenario.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd the problem with these extremes,
p109
aVand not just the temperature extremes,
p110
aVbut also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts,
p111
aVis our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with these sorts of events.
p112
aVSo our roads and our rail networks
p113
aVhave been designed to last for a long time
p114
aVand withstand only certain amounts of impacts
p115
aVin different parts of the world.
p116
aVAnd this is going to be extremely challenged.
p117
aVOur power stations are expected to be cooled by water
p118
aVto a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient.
p119
aVAnd our buildings are designed to be comfortable
p120
aVwithin a particular temperature range.
p121
aVAnd this is all going to be significantly challenged
p122
aVunder a four-degree-type scenario.
p123
aVOur infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo if we go back, also thinking about four degrees,
p126
aVit's not just the direct impacts,
p127
aVbut also some indirect impacts.
p128
aVSo if we take food security, for example.
p129
aVMaize and wheat yields
p130
aVin some parts of the world
p131
aVare expected to be up to 40 percent lower
p132
aVunder a four-degree scenario,
p133
aVrice up to 30 percent lower.
p134
aVThis will be absolutely devastating for global food security.
p135
aVSo all in all, the kinds of impacts anticipated
p136
aVunder this four-degree centigrade scenario
p137
aVare going to be incompatible with global organized living.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees.
p140
aVIs it reasonable still to focus on the two-degree path?
p141
aVThere are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists
p142
aVwho would say that it's now too late to avoid a two-degree warming.
p143
aVBut I would just like to draw on my own research
p144
aVon energy systems, on food systems,
p145
aVaviation and also shipping,
p146
aVjust to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance
p147
aVof avoiding this two-degree dangerous climate change.
p148
aVBut we really need to get to grips with the numbers
p149
aVto work out how to do it.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo if you focus in on this trajectory and these graphs,
p152
aVthe yellow circle there highlights that the departure
p153
aVfrom the red four-degree pathway
p154
aVto the two-degree green pathway is immediate.
p155
aVAnd that's because of cumulative emissions,
p156
aVor the carbon budget.
p157
aVSo in other words, because of the lights and the projectors
p158
aVthat are on in this room right now,
p159
aVthe CO2 that is going into our atmosphere
p160
aVas a result of that electricity consumption
p161
aVlasts a very long time.
p162
aVSome of it will be in our atmosphere for a century, maybe much longer.
p163
aVIt will accumulate, and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative.
p164
aVAnd that tells us something about these trajectories.
p165
aVFirst of all, it tells us that it's the area under these curves that matter,
p166
aVnot where we reach at a particular date in future.
p167
aVAnd that's important, because it doesn't matter
p168
aVif we come up with some amazing whiz-bang technology
p169
aVto sort out our energy problem on the last day of 2049,
p170
aVjust in the nick of time to sort things out.
p171
aVBecause in the meantime, emissions will have accumulated.
p172
aVSo if we continue on this red, four-degree centigrade scenario pathway,
p173
aVthe longer we continue on it,
p174
aVthat will need to be made up for in later years
p175
aVto keep the same carbon budget, to keep the same area under the curve,
p176
aVwhich means that that trajectory, the red one there, becomes steeper.
p177
aVSo in other words, if we don't reduce emissions in the short to medium term,
p178
aVthen we'll have to make more significant year-on-year emission reductions.
p179
aVWe also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system.
p180
aVBut if we don't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term,
p181
aVthen we will have to do that even sooner.
p182
aVSo this poses really big challenges for us.
p183
aa(lp184
VThe other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy.
p185
aVIf you live in a part of the world where per capita emissions are already high,
p186
aVit points us towards reducing energy demand.
p187
aVAnd that's because with all the will in the world,
p188
aVthe large-scale engineering infrastructure
p189
aVthat we need to roll out rapidly
p190
aVto decarbonize the supply side of our energy system
p191
aVis just simply not going to happen in time.
p192
aVSo it doesn't matter whether we choose nuclear power
p193
aVor carbon capture and storage,
p194
aVupscale our biofuel production,
p195
aVor go for a much bigger roll-out of wind turbines and wave turbines.
p196
aVAll of that will take time.
p197
aVSo because it's the area under the curve that matters,
p198
aVwe need to focus on energy efficiency,
p199
aVbut also on energy conservation \u2014 in other words, using less energy.
p200
aVAnd if we do that, that also means
p201
aVthat as we continue to roll out the supply-side technology,
p202
aVwe will have less of a job to do if we've actually managed
p203
aVto reduce our energy consumption,
p204
aVbecause we will then need less infrastructure on the supply side.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnother issue that we really need to grapple with
p207
aVis the issue of well-being and equity.
p208
aVThere are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise.
p209
aVBbut with energy systems currently reliant on fossil fuel,
p210
aVas those economies grow so will emissions.
p211
aVAnd now, if we're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget,
p212
aVthat means that if some parts of the world's emissions are needing to rise,
p213
aVthen other parts of the world's emissions need to reduce.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo that poses very significant challenges for wealthy nations.
p216
aVBecause according to our research,
p217
aVif you're in a country where per capita emissions are really high \u2014
p218
aVso North America, Europe, Australia \u2014
p219
aVemissions reductions of the order of 10 percent per year,
p220
aVand starting immediately, will be required for a good chance
p221
aVof avoiding the two-degree target.
p222
aVLet me just put that into context.
p223
aVThe economist Nicholas Stern
p224
aVsaid that emission reductions of more than one percent per year
p225
aVhad only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval.
p226
aVSo this poses huge challenges for the issue of economic growth,
p227
aVbecause if we have our high carbon infrastructure in place,
p228
aVit means that if our economies grow,
p229
aVthen so do our emissions.
p230
aVSo I'd just like to take a quote from a paper
p231
aVby myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011
p232
aVwhere we said that to avoid the two-degree framing of dangerous climate change,
p233
aVeconomic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily
p234
aVfor a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations.
p235
aa(lp236
VThis is a really difficult message to take,
p237
aVbecause what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently.
p238
aVThis is not about just incremental change.
p239
aVThis is about doing things differently, about whole system change,
p240
aVand sometimes it's about doing less things.
p241
aVAnd this applies to all of us,
p242
aVwhatever sphere of influence we have.
p243
aVSo it could be from writing to our local politician
p244
aVto talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work,
p245
aVor talking with our friends and family, or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles.
p246
aVBecause we really need to make significant change.
p247
aVAt the moment, we're choosing a four-degree scenario.
p248
aVIf we really want to avoid the two-degree scenario,
p249
aVthere really is no time like the present to act.
p250
aa(lp251
VThank you.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VBruno Giussani: Alice, basically what you're saying,
p256
aVthe talk is, unless wealthy nations start cutting 10 percent per year
p257
aVthe emissions now, this year, not in 2020 or '25,
p258
aVwe are going to go straight to the four-plus-degree scenario.
p259
aVI am wondering what's your take on the cut by 70 percent for 2070.
p260
aa(lp261
VAlice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees.
p262
aVOne of the things that often \u2014
p263
aVwhen there are these modeling studies that look at what we need to do,
p264
aVis they tend to hugely overestimate how quickly other countries in the world
p265
aVcan start to reduce emissions.
p266
aVSo they make kind of heroic assumptions about that.
p267
aVThe more we do that, because it's the cumulative emissions,
p268
aVthe short-term stuff that really matters.
p269
aVSo it does make a huge difference.
p270
aVIf a big country like China, for example,
p271
aVcontinues to grow even for just a few extra years,
p272
aVthat will make a big difference to when we need to decarbonize.
p273
aVSo I don't think we can even say when it will be,
p274
aVbecause it all depends on what we have to do in the short term.
p275
aVBut I think we've just got huge scope, and we don't pull those levers
p276
aVthat allow us to reduce the energy demand, which is a shame.
p277

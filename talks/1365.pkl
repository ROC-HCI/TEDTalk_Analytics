VGabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,
p5
aVfor his storytelling,
p6
aVbut even more, I think,
p7
aVfor the beauty and precision of his prose.
p8
aVAnd whether it's the opening line from "One Hundred Years of Solitude"
p9
aVor the fantastical stream of consciousness
p10
aVin "Autumn of the Patriarch,"
p11
aVwhere the words rush by,
p12
aVpage after page of unpunctuated imagery
p13
aVsweeping the reader along
p14
aVlike some wild river
p15
aVtwisting through a primal South American jungle,
p16
aVreading Márquez is a visceral experience.
p17
aVWhich struck me as particularly remarkable
p18
aVduring one session with the novel
p19
aVwhen I realized that I was being swept along
p20
aVon this remarkable, vivid journey
p21
aVin translation.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow I was a comparative literature major in college,
p24
aVwhich is like an English major,
p25
aVonly instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,
p26
aVwe got to read great literature in translation
p27
aVfrom around the world.
p28
aVAnd as great as these books were,
p29
aVyou could always tell
p30
aVthat you were getting close to the full effect.
p31
aVBut not so with Márquez
p32
aVwho once praised his translator's versions
p33
aVas being better than his own,
p34
aVwhich is an astonishing compliment.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,
p37
aVhad written his own book on the subject,
p38
aVI couldn't wait to read it.
p39
aVIt's called apropos of the Italian adage
p40
aVthat I lifted from his forward,
p41
aV"If This Be Treason."
p42
aVAnd it's a charming read.
p43
aVIt's highly recommended for anyone who's interested
p44
aVin the translator's art.
p45
aVBut the reason that I mention it
p46
aVis that early on, Rabassa offers
p47
aVthis elegantly simple insight:
p48
aV"Every act of communication
p49
aVis an act of translation."
p50
aa(lp51
VNow maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time,
p52
aVbut for me,
p53
aVas often as I'd encountered
p54
aVthat exact difficulty on a daily basis,
p55
aVI had never seen the inherent challenge of communication
p56
aVin so crystalline a light.
p57
aVEver since I can remember
p58
aVthinking consciously about such things,
p59
aVcommunication has been my central passion.
p60
aVEven as a child,
p61
aVI remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life
p62
aVwas to be able to understand everything
p63
aVand then to communicate it to everyone else.
p64
aVSo no ego problems.
p65
aVIt's funny, my wife, Daisy,
p66
aVwhose family is littered with schizophrenics \u2014
p67
aVand I mean littered with them \u2014
p68
aVonce said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God.
p69
aVI don't need a husband who wants to be."
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VAnyway, as I plunged through my 20s
p74
aVever more aware of how unobtainable
p75
aVthe first part of my childhood ambition was,
p76
aVit was that second part,
p77
aVbeing able to successfully communicate to others
p78
aVwhatever knowledge I was gaining,
p79
aVwhere the futility of my quest really set in.
p80
aVTime after time,
p81
aVwhenever I set out to share some great truth
p82
aVwith a soon-to-be grateful recipient,
p83
aVit had the opposite effect.
p84
aVInterestingly, when your opening line of communication is,
p85
aV"Hey, listen up,
p86
aVbecause I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you,"
p87
aVit's amazing how quickly you'll discover
p88
aVboth ice and the firing squad.
p89
aa(lp90
VFinally, after about 10 years
p91
aVof alienating friends and strangers alike,
p92
aVI finally got it,
p93
aVa new personal truth all my own,
p94
aVthat if I was going to ever communicate well with other people
p95
aVthe ideas that I was gaining,
p96
aVI'd better find a different way of going about it.
p97
aVAnd that's when I discovered comedy.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow comedy travels along a distinct wavelength
p100
aVfrom other forms of language.
p101
aVIf I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,
p102
aVI'd say it falls somewhere
p103
aVbetween poetry and lies.
p104
aVAnd I'm not talking about all comedy here,
p105
aVbecause, clearly, there's plenty of humor
p106
aVthat colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.
p107
aVWhat I want to talk about
p108
aVis the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has
p109
aVat circumventing our ingrained perspectives \u2014
p110
aVcomedy as the philosopher's stone.
p111
aVIt takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom
p112
aVand transforms it through ridicule
p113
aVinto a different way of seeing
p114
aVand ultimately being in the world.
p115
aVBecause that's what I take
p116
aVfrom the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.
p117
aVThat it's about communication
p118
aVthat doesn't just produce greater understanding
p119
aVwithin the individual,
p120
aVbut leads to real change.
p121
aVWhich in my experience means communication
p122
aVthat manages to speak to and expand
p123
aVour concept of self-interest.
p124
aVNow I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest
p125
aVbecause we're all wired for that.
p126
aVIt's part of our survival package,
p127
aVand that's why it's become so important for us,
p128
aVand that's why we're always listening at that level.
p129
aVAnd also because that's where,
p130
aVin terms of our own self-interest,
p131
aVwe finally begin to grasp
p132
aVour ability to respond, our responsibility
p133
aVto the rest of the world.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire,
p136
aVI mean work that comes first and foremost
p137
aVfrom a place of honesty and integrity.
p138
aVNow if you think back
p139
aVon Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live
p140
aVof the newly nominated vice presidential candidate
p141
aVSarah Palin,
p142
aVthey were devastating.
p143
aVFey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit
p144
aVthe candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness,
p145
aVcementing an impression
p146
aVthat the majority of the American public still holds today.
p147
aVAnd the key detail of this
p148
aVis that Fey's scripts weren't written by her
p149
aVand they weren't written by the SNL writers.
p150
aVThey were lifted verbatim
p151
aVfrom Palin's own remarks.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVHere was a Palin impersonator
p154
aVquoting Palin word for word.
p155
aVNow that's honesty and integrity,
p156
aVand it's also why Fey's performances
p157
aVleft such a lasting impression.
p158
aa(lp159
VOn the other side of the political spectrum,
p160
aVthe first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh
p161
aVrefer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl
p162
aVI knew that he'd made a direct hit.
p163
aVNow it's not often that I'm going to associate
p164
aVthe words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,
p165
aVbut it's really hard to argue with that punchline.
p166
aVThe description perfectly captured
p167
aVEdwards' personal vanity.
p168
aVAnd guess what?
p169
aVThat ended up being the exact personality trait
p170
aVthat was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow The Daily Show with John Stewart
p173
aVis by far the most \u2014
p174
aV(Applause)
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVit's by far the most well-documented example
p177
aVof the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.
p178
aVSurvey after survey,
p179
aVfrom Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy,
p180
aVhas found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events
p181
aVthan the viewers of all major network and cable news shows.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VNow whether this says more
p186
aVabout the conflict between integrity and profitability
p187
aVof corporate journalism
p188
aVthan it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers,
p189
aVthe larger point remains
p190
aVthat Stewart's material
p191
aVis always grounded in a commitment to the facts \u2014
p192
aVnot because his intent is to inform. It's not.
p193
aVHis intent is to be funny.
p194
aVIt just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny
p195
aVdoesn't work unless the facts are true.
p196
aVAnd the result is great comedy
p197
aVthat's also an information delivery system
p198
aVthat scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention
p199
aVthan the professional news media.
p200
aVNow this is doubly ironic
p201
aVwhen you consider that what gives comedy its edge
p202
aVat reaching around people's walls
p203
aVis the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.
p204
aa(lp205
VA great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,
p206
aVwhere you think it's going over here
p207
aVand then all of a sudden you're transported over here.
p208
aVAnd there's this mental delight
p209
aVthat's followed by the physical response of laughter,
p210
aVwhich, not coincidentally,
p211
aVreleases endorphins in the brain.
p212
aVAnd just like that, you've been seduced
p213
aVinto a different way of looking at something
p214
aVbecause the endorphins have brought down your defenses.
p215
aVThis is the exact opposite
p216
aVof the way that anger and fear and panic,
p217
aVall of the flight-or-fight responses, operate.
p218
aVFlight-or-fight releases adrenalin,
p219
aVwhich throws our walls up sky-high.
p220
aVAnd the comedy comes along,
p221
aVdealing with a lot of the same areas
p222
aVwhere our defenses are the strongest \u2014
p223
aVrace, religion, politics, sexuality \u2014
p224
aVonly by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,
p225
aVwe get endorphins
p226
aVand the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,
p227
aVrevealing a fresh and unexpected point of view.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow let me give you an example from my act.
p230
aVI have some material
p231
aVabout the so-called radical gay agenda,
p232
aVwhich starts off by asking,
p233
aVhow radical is the gay agenda?
p234
aVBecause from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want most
p235
aVare to join the military, get married and start a family.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVThree things I've tried to avoid my entire life.
p238
aV(Laughter)
p239
aVHave at it you radical bastards. The field is yours.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd that's followed by these lines
p244
aVabout gay adoption:
p245
aVWhat is the problem with gay adoption?
p246
aVWhy is this remotely controversial?
p247
aVIf you have a baby and you think that baby's gay,
p248
aVyou should be allowed to put it up for adoption.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVYou have given birth to an abomination.
p251
aVRemove it from your household.
p252
aVNow by taking the biblical epithet "abomination"
p253
aVand attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby,
p254
aVthis joke short circuits the emotional wiring
p255
aVbehind the debate
p256
aVand it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter,
p257
aVto question its validity.
p258
aa(lp259
VMisdirection isn't the only trick
p260
aVthat comedy has up its sleeve.
p261
aVEconomy of language
p262
aVis another real strong suit of great comedy.
p263
aVThere are few phrases
p264
aVthat pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol
p265
aVthan the perfect punchline.
p266
aVBill Hicks \u2014 and if you don't know his work,
p267
aVyou should really Google him \u2014
p268
aVHicks had a routine
p269
aVabout getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground,
p270
aVwhere finally the other kid says to him,
p271
aV"Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad,"
p272
aVto which Hicks replies,
p273
aV"Really? How soon?"
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVThat's an entire childhood
p276
aVin three words.
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aVNot to mention what it reveals
p279
aVabout the adult who's speaking them.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd one last powerful attribute
p282
aVthat comedy has as communication
p283
aVis that it's inherently viral.
p284
aVPeople can't wait
p285
aVto pass along that new great joke.
p286
aVAnd this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world.
p287
aVComedy has been crossing country
p288
aVwith remarkable speed
p289
aVway before the Internet, social media,
p290
aVeven cable TV.
p291
aVBack in 1980
p292
aVwhen comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire
p293
aVduring a freebasing accident,
p294
aVI was in Los Angeles the day after it happened
p295
aVand then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that.
p296
aVAnd I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts \u2014
p297
aVsomething about the Ignited Negro College Fund.
p298
aVClearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue.
p299
aVAnd my guess here \u2014 and I have no research on this \u2014
p300
aVis that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it,
p301
aVyou'd find out that comedy
p302
aVis the second oldest viral profession.
p303
aVFirst there were drums
p304
aVand then knock-knock jokes.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VBut it's when you put all of these elements together \u2014
p309
aVwhen you get the viral appeal of a great joke
p310
aVwith a powerful punchline
p311
aVthat's crafted from honesty and integrity,
p312
aVit can have a real world impact
p313
aVat changing a conversation.
p314
aVNow I have a close friend, Joel Pett,
p315
aVwho's the editorial cartoonist
p316
aVfor the Lexington Herald-Leader.
p317
aVAnd he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy.
p318
aVI was visiting with Joel
p319
aVthe weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened
p320
aVin December of 2009.
p321
aVAnd Joel was explaining to me
p322
aVthat, because USA Today
p323
aVwas one of America's four papers of record,
p324
aVit would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference,
p325
aVwhich meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon
p326
aVon Monday, the opening day of the conference,
p327
aVit could get passed around
p328
aVat the highest level among actual decision-makers.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo we started talking about climate change.
p331
aVAnd it turned out that Joel and I
p332
aVwere both bothered by the same thing,
p333
aVwhich was how so much of the debate
p334
aVwas still focused on the science
p335
aVand how complete it was or wasn't,
p336
aVwhich, to both of us,
p337
aVseems somewhat intentionally off point.
p338
aVBecause first of all, there's this false premise
p339
aVthat such a thing as complete science exists.
p340
aVNow Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas
p341
aVwas pushing this same line this past summer
p342
aVat the beginning of his oops-fated campaign
p343
aVfor the Republican presidential nomination,
p344
aVproclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete
p345
aVat the same time that 250
p346
aVout of 254 counties in the state of Texas
p347
aVwere on fire.
p348
aVAnd Perry's policy solution
p349
aVwas to ask the people of Texas
p350
aVto pray for rain.
p351
aVPersonally, I was praying for four more fires
p352
aVso we could finally complete the damn science.
p353
aa(lp354
V(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VBut back in 2009,
p357
aVthe question Joel and I kept turning over and over
p358
aVwas why this late in the game
p359
aVso much energy was being spent talking about the science
p360
aVwhen the policies necessary to address climate change
p361
aVwere unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run
p362
aVregardless of the science.
p363
aVSo we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.
p364
aVCartoon: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aVYou've got to love that idea.
p367
aV(Applause)
p368
aVHow about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?
p369
aVNot for God, not for country, not for profit \u2014
p370
aVjust as a basic metric for global decision-making.
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd this cartoon hit the bull's eye.
p373
aVShortly after the conference was over,
p374
aVJoel got a request for a signed copy
p375
aVfrom the head of the EPA in Washington
p376
aVwhose wall it now hangs on.
p377
aVAnd not long after that, he got another request for a copy
p378
aVfrom the head of the EPA in California
p379
aVwho used it as part of her presentation
p380
aVat an international conference on climate change
p381
aVin Sacramento last year.
p382
aVAnd it didn't stop there.
p383
aVTo date, Joel's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups,
p384
aVin the United States, Canada and Europe.
p385
aVAnd earlier this year,
p386
aVhe got a request from the Green Party in Australia
p387
aVwho used it in their campaign
p388
aVwhere it became part of the debate
p389
aVthat resulted in the Australian parliament
p390
aVadopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime
p391
aVof any country in the world.
p392
aV(Applause)
p393
aVThat is a lot of punch
p394
aVfor 14 words.
p395
aa(lp396
VSo my suggestion to those of you out here
p397
aVwho are seriously focused on creating a better world
p398
aVis to take a little bit of time each day
p399
aVand practice thinking funny,
p400
aVbecause you might just find the question that you've been looking for.
p401
aa(lp402
VThank you.
p403
aa(lp404

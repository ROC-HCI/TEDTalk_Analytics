VI have a vision for each one of you,
p5
aVand the vision I have for you
p6
aVis that when you wake up in the morning,
p7
aVyour blood is singing at the thought of being who you are
p8
aVand doing what you do;
p9
aVthat as you go through the day,
p10
aVyou can literally sink to your knees in gratitude
p11
aVat the tremendous good fortune that's been bestowed on you;
p12
aVthat as you go through the day,
p13
aVyou become radiantly alive several times.
p14
aVAnd if your life isn't like that,
p15
aVI'd like to humbly suggest that you're wasting your life.
p16
aVA life is too short to be wasted.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo what I propose to do in the next 17 minutes \u2014
p19
aVI've used up one minute already \u2014
p20
aVis to give you a set of powerful tools
p21
aVwhich can get you started on being there.
p22
aVIs that of interest to you?
p23
aa(lp24
VAudience: Yes.
p25
aa(lp26
VSrikumar Rao: OK.
p27
aa(lp28
VThis is a conference on happiness,
p29
aVbut even if it wasn't a conference on happiness,
p30
aVwould it be right if I said that in some way, shape, fashion or form,
p31
aVyou're devoting your entire life
p32
aVto being happy?
p33
aVEverything you do \u2014 your job, family, children, relationships, whatever \u2014
p34
aVis a quest for happiness.
p35
aVCorrect?
p36
aa(lp37
VI'd like you to think about the following:
p38
aVWhat do you have to get
p39
aVin order to be happy?
p40
aVWe're just going to spend a minute on this.
p41
aVWhat do you have to get in order to be happy?
p42
aa(lp43
VAnybody, quick?
p44
aa(lp45
VWhen I conduct this experiment, a bunch of stuff comes up:
p46
aVvast wealth, trophy spouse, good health, lots of travel, time, etc, etc, etc.
p47
aVRight now, if you were to think about it,
p48
aVyou probably have a list of, "Here's what I need to get
p49
aVin order to be happy."
p50
aVI would like you to consider this:
p51
aVanything that you can get \u2014
p52
aVlet me repeat that \u2014 anything you can get, you can un-get.
p53
aVIs that correct?
p54
aVSo, vast wealth can make you happy. Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow.
p55
aVA number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already.
p56
aVSo whatever you get that can make you happy
p57
aVcan go away.
p58
aVWhere does that leave you?
p59
aVNot a very nice place, right?
p60
aa(lp61
VI have a different proposition to suggest to you.
p62
aVWhat I have to suggest to you
p63
aVis that there is nothing that you have to get, do or be
p64
aVin order to be happy.
p65
aVLet me repeat that:
p66
aVthere is nothing that you have to get, do or be in order to be happy.
p67
aVIn fact, happiness is your innate nature.
p68
aVIt is hardwired into you. It is part of your DNA.
p69
aVYou cannot not be happy.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, all of you are very polite,
p72
aVand in some of the other forums I speak in, such as top business schools,
p73
aVthey're not so polite.
p74
aVAnd invariably, somebody articulates what many of you are thinking,
p75
aVwhich is: "If happiness is my innate nature,
p76
aVhow come I am not experiencing it?
p77
aVHow come I am experiencing my life sucks?"
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd the answer to that is actually very simple.
p82
aVYou have spent your entire life
p83
aVlearning to be unhappy.
p84
aVLet me repeat that: you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy.
p85
aVAnd the way we learn to be unhappy
p86
aVis by buying into a particular mental model.
p87
aa(lp88
VA mental model is a notion we have that this is the way the world works.
p89
aVAll of us have mental models, we've got dozens of mental models.
p90
aVWe've got mental models on how to find a job,
p91
aVhow to get ahead at work, how to pick a restaurant to eat at,
p92
aVhow to have a movie to go to ... dozens of them.
p93
aVThe problem isn't that we have mental models.
p94
aVThe problem is that we don't know that we have mental models.
p95
aVWe think this is the way the world works.
p96
aVAnd the more we invest in a mental model,
p97
aVthe more it appears that this, in fact, is the way the world works.
p98
aVBut it isn't: it's just a mental model,
p99
aVand the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly
p100
aVis that we have to get something so we can do something
p101
aVso we can be something.
p102
aVLike, we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places
p103
aVso we can be happy.
p104
aVWe have to be in a relationship so we can have great sex
p105
aVso we can be happy.
p106
aa(lp107
VAll of this is a variation of the if-then model.
p108
aVAnd the if-then model is:
p109
aVif this happens,
p110
aVthen we will be happy.
p111
aVIf I were to get a better job, if I were to get more money,
p112
aVif my boss would have a heart attack,
p113
aVif only I was married, if only my wife would leave me \u2014
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
Vif only I had children,
p118
aVif my children would grow up and go to college ...
p119
aVIt doesn't matter what it is.
p120
aVThe whole notion is if this happens,
p121
aVthen I will be happy.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd right now, the only thing that's different
p124
aVbetween the persons in this audience
p125
aVis what is the particular "if" that you are focusing on?
p126
aVAnd the only thing that's different
p127
aVbetween you now and where you were 10 years ago
p128
aVis what is the particular "if" that you were focusing on?
p129
aVThink about your life 10 years ago.
p130
aVSpend a minute doing that.
p131
aVTen years ago, if you remember clearly,
p132
aVthere were certain things you wanted.
p133
aVIs that correct?
p134
aVOdds are pretty good
p135
aVthat many of those things you wanted 10 years ago you now have.
p136
aVIs that correct?
p137
aVWhere has that left you?
p138
aVIn exactly the same place, right?
p139
aa(lp140
VWhat we don't realize is the model itself is flawed.
p141
aVThe if-then model \u2014 "If this happens I will be happy" \u2014
p142
aVthe model itself is flawed.
p143
aVBut instead of recognizing that it is the model itself that's flawed,
p144
aVwhat we do is spend enormous amounts of time
p145
aVchanging the "if."
p146
aV"Oh, well, I thought if I became CEO it would help,
p147
aVbut now I realize it's not that I want to become a CEO.
p148
aVI want to become the billionaire CEO,
p149
aVand then I will be happy."
p150
aVYou've got your own variation on that.
p151
aVBut it's the model itself that's flawed, not what you put on the "if" side
p152
aVof the equation.
p153
aVI can demonstrate that to you.
p154
aa(lp155
VCan any of you recall a time
p156
aVwhen you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty
p157
aVthat it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity?
p158
aVMaybe a rainbow, a mountain range,
p159
aVa valley, the sea.
p160
aVAnd if you remember that \u2014 raise your hands if you could.
p161
aVVirtually all of you could, right?
p162
aVHave you ever wondered why that happened?
p163
aVThe reason that happened is that somehow,
p164
aVfor some reason,
p165
aVat that instant,
p166
aVyou accepted the universe exactly as it was.
p167
aVYou didn't say,
p168
aV"That's a beautiful rainbow, but it's kind of off to the left,
p169
aVand if I could move it 200 yards to the right,
p170
aVit would be ever so much more beautiful."
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VYou didn't say, "That's a beautiful valley,
p175
aVbut the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches.
p176
aVSo if you gave me a chainsaw and 20 minutes,
p177
aVI'd make it ever so much better."
p178
aa(lp179
VOh no, the rainbow off-center
p180
aVwas just fine.
p181
aVThe tree with its crooked branches
p182
aVwas just fine.
p183
aVAnd the moment you accepted the universe just as it was,
p184
aVyour habitual-wanting self dropped away,
p185
aVand the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced,
p186
aVand you felt it.
p187
aVAnd I know you felt it because now,
p188
aVeven now after all those years,
p189
aVyou can still remember it.
p190
aa(lp191
VThe problem is that your life right now,
p192
aVwith all of the problems that you have \u2014
p193
aVmore precisely, all of the problems that you think you have \u2014
p194
aVis equally perfect.
p195
aVBut you do not accept it.
p196
aVIn fact, you're spending all your time
p197
aVstriving with might and main to make it different.
p198
aVYou are not accepting it.
p199
aVAnd when you're not accepting it,
p200
aVyou're buying into the if-then model:
p201
aVif this happens, then I will be happy.
p202
aVAnd it's the model itself that is flawed.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo let me show you how you can get out of that,
p205
aVor at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that.
p206
aVI'd like to share with you that action.
p207
aVWe all live our lives because we want to achieve something, correct?
p208
aVYou know, we are here and we want to have something.
p209
aVAlex wants to have a successful conference.
p210
aVYou know, many of you want to have great programs for your companies
p211
aVthat are very successful.
p212
aVYou want to progress, have more money, all of that, is that correct?
p213
aVEach of those is an outcome; you would like something to happen.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, I'd like you to think about the following:
p216
aVactions are within your control,
p217
aVnot entirely, but to a large extent.
p218
aVThe outcome is completely out of your control.
p219
aVOK?
p220
aVActions are within your control.
p221
aVThe outcome is completely outside your control.
p222
aa(lp223
VHave any of you recognized that when you have a goal
p224
aVand you start to work towards it,
p225
aVsome of the time you don't achieve your goal,
p226
aVand some of the time what you get
p227
aVis the exact opposite of what you wanted?
p228
aVHas that happened to any of you?
p229
aa(lp230
VLike there was a friend of mine who said, "Gee, you know,
p231
aVI have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife,
p232
aVand this has to change."
p233
aVSo the next time we went on a business trip,
p234
aVhe bought a very expensive dress for her.
p235
aVAnd this was his way of showing, you know, I care for you,
p236
aVand nice things would happen.
p237
aVAnd when he presented the gift to his wife, her immediate reaction was,
p238
aV"After 20 years of marriage, you don't know my size?"
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
V"And furthermore, don't you know I never wear this kind of thing?"
p243
aVAnd the next thing you know, he had a full-blown marital spat.
p244
aVHas that happened to any of you?
p245
aVYou've taken action for a particular outcome
p246
aVand the outcome you got was the exact opposite
p247
aVof what you wanted?
p248
aVHappens all the time.
p249
aa(lp250
VWell, we live in a world where what we think of,
p251
aVwhat we invest in,
p252
aVis the outcome.
p253
aVWe define our life in the following way:
p254
aVhere I am, here is where I want to go,
p255
aVthese are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am
p256
aVto where I want to go,
p257
aVand if I succeed, life is wonderful.
p258
aVAnd if I don't, then I have failed,
p259
aVlife is no good, life sucks.
p260
aVTrue? False?
p261
aVThat is how we live.
p262
aVWe invest in the outcome,
p263
aVand as I've just pointed out,
p264
aVthe outcome is frequently different from what we would like,
p265
aVand sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like.
p266
aVYou invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have
p267
aVmore than your share of frustration, angst
p268
aVand all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck.
p269
aa(lp270
VThere is an alternative.
p271
aVAnd the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome,
p272
aVyou invest in the process.
p273
aVAnd the best way to describe that is a quote by John Wooden.
p274
aVI don't know how many of you are familiar with John Wooden.
p275
aVHe's very well-known in the United States
p276
aVand certainly among basketball fans.
p277
aVHe's the only person ever to make the basketball Hall of Fame
p278
aVboth as a player and as a coach.
p279
aVAnd what he told his entering team \u2014
p280
aVhe led UCLA to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the NCAA \u2014
p281
aVand what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning.
p282
aVHe always said, "When it's over and you look in the mirror,
p283
aVdid you do the best that you were capable of?
p284
aVAnd if you did the best that you were capable of,
p285
aVthe score doesn't matter.
p286
aVBut I would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of,
p287
aVyou will find the score to your liking."
p288
aVThat is investing in a process.
p289
aa(lp290
VWhat we do is the exact opposite.
p291
aVWe invest in the outcome.
p292
aVThis is what I want \u2014 oh, I want it so desperately,
p293
aVbecause if I get it I will be happy.
p294
aVAnd you try with might and main, to do whatever you can,
p295
aVbut you are always focusing on, "This is the outcome."
p296
aVNow, focusing on the outcome is fine.
p297
aVIt gives you direction.
p298
aVInvesting in the outcome means
p299
aVthat you make the achievement of a particular outcome
p300
aVdependent for your well-being.
p301
aVAnd that is a surefire recipe for failure.
p302
aa(lp303
VWhat you can do is something else.
p304
aVYou can invest in the process.
p305
aVThat is, once you have determined, here is where I am,
p306
aVhere is where I want to be, and that's fine,
p307
aVyou focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction,
p308
aVand then you invest yourself completely in the process.
p309
aVYou say, here are the steps you want to take,
p310
aVand you put everything into it.
p311
aVAnd if you succeed, wonderful.
p312
aVAnd if you don't succeed,
p313
aVstill wonderful,
p314
aVbecause now you have a new starting point, and from that new starting point,
p315
aVyou select another outcome and keep going.
p316
aVAnd when you do that, you will find that every day is a blast.
p317
aa(lp318
VLet me give you an example.
p319
aVAnd if you have children \u2014 raise your hands if you have children.
p320
aVHave you ever seen a small child learn to walk?
p321
aVWhat happens, and this happens typically between 11 and 13 months,
p322
aVis the child gets up and she sees everybody walking,
p323
aVshe wants to walk, she gets up, she falls down, she starts crying
p324
aVand momma runs up and comforts her, kisses the place, makes it well.
p325
aVShe tries again, falls down, mommy runs up again.
p326
aVAfter some time, mommy feels tired and no longer runs up
p327
aVand the child stops crying,
p328
aVand then she gets up, takes a step
p329
aVand doesn't fall down, and then she takes another,
p330
aVand a beautiful smile comes on her face.
p331
aVAnd very soon, generally within 24 hours, she's walking all over the place,
p332
aVupsetting your living room arrangements.
p333
aVAnd you know you've gone to a new stage of parenting.
p334
aVRight?
p335
aa(lp336
VNow, imagine what would happen
p337
aVif each time the child fell,
p338
aVshe would say, "Oh my God, I failed again.
p339
aVI'm never going to learn to walk."
p340
aVAnd you have to get counseling for her
p341
aVto help her deal with feelings of inadequacy
p342
aVand not being able to achieve and fail yet again.
p343
aVHow long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that,
p344
aVif every three times she fell down, you had to get a counselor
p345
aVto counsel her and so on?
p346
aVSounds funny, doesn't it?
p347
aVBut that is exactly what we're doing.
p348
aVWhat the child is doing is focusing on the process.
p349
aVShe's investing in the process,
p350
aVnot in the outcome.
p351
aa(lp352
VWhat we do is the exact opposite.
p353
aVAs we grow up, we lose the ability to invest in the process,
p354
aVwe start investing in the outcome.
p355
aVBy definition the outcome is outside of our control,
p356
aVand if that's where we spend all of our emotional energy,
p357
aVwe are going to get drained as we do.
p358
aa(lp359
VBut if, on the other hand, we said,
p360
aV"Here is the outcome, I am going to invest in the process
p361
aVand give it every single bit I could,"
p362
aVevery day is a blast,
p363
aVand you're well on your way to achieving the vision that I outlined to you.
p364
aa(lp365
VThe question that I get all the time, is people say, "Professor Rao,
p366
aVbut nothing makes me passionate."
p367
aVSo I say, "OK, what would?"
p368
aVAnd they invariably come up with, you know, here is a list of things.
p369
aVHere's my job and here's how much it pays,
p370
aVthis is the kind of person my boss is,
p371
aVthe kind of people my colleagues are,
p372
aVand here's how my customers are, here's how much I travel,
p373
aVhere's how big my office is, how deep the carpeting is,
p374
aVhow many windows I have \u2014
p375
aVa bunch of parameters.
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd what I tell them is what I want to share with you,
p378
aVbecause all of that stuff \u2014 first of all, it doesn't exist.
p379
aVBut second, even if it did and you were plugged into it,
p380
aVit would not take more than six months
p381
aVfor you to be the same sorry, miserable self there as you are now,
p382
aVbecause passion exists inside you.
p383
aVIt does not exist in the job.
p384
aVAnd if you don't find a way to ignite it within you
p385
aVright where you are,
p386
aVyou are not going to find it outside.
p387
aVBut if you do find a way to ignite it where you are,
p388
aVthen you will find that the external world
p389
aVrearranges itself
p390
aVto accommodate the new person that you are becoming.
p391
aVAnd as you do that, you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis.
p392
aVPersons come up whom you're delighted to meet.
p393
aVNew people enter your life.
p394
aVIt's just a breeze,
p395
aVbecause all you do in your life is you take journeys.
p396
aa(lp397
VYou came here to this conference; you went on a journey.
p398
aVYou hang around the water cooler,
p399
aVtalking about how terrible your place of work is;
p400
aVyou went on a journey.
p401
aVYou watch "Desperate Housewives," you go on a journey.
p402
aVYou go on a journey
p403
aVwhere 40-something women are having affairs with 19-something gardeners
p404
aVwhile the husbands are playing around with models.
p405
aVAll you do is go on journeys.
p406
aVThere's nothing wrong with that, but just ask yourself,
p407
aV"Is this a journey I want to take?
p408
aVDoes this take me to a place I want to spend time?"
p409
aa(lp410
VAnd if you start doing that,
p411
aVyou will find that your life changes.
p412
aVThe kind of people you meet, the things you talk about,
p413
aVthe movies you go to, the books you read \u2014
p414
aVeverything changes.
p415
aVAnd you begin all of that
p416
aVby focusing on the process.
p417
aa(lp418
VInvest in the process, not in the outcome.
p419
aa(lp420
VThank you.

VMy name is Ryan Lobo,
p5
aVand I've been involved in the documentary
p6
aVfilmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.
p7
aVDuring the process of making these films
p8
aVI found myself taking photographs,
p9
aVoften much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.
p10
aa(lp11
VI found this photography of mine almost compulsive.
p12
aVAnd at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that
p13
aVI had photographs that told a better story
p14
aVthan a sometimes-sensational documentary.
p15
aVI felt, when I had my photographs,
p16
aVthat I was holding on to something true,
p17
aVregardless of agendas or politics.
p18
aVIn 2007, I traveled to three war zones.
p19
aVI traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.
p20
aVAnd over there I experienced
p21
aVother people's suffering, up close and personal,
p22
aVimmersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,
p23
aVand at times I experienced great fear for my own life.
p24
aa(lp25
VAs always, I would return to Bangalore,
p26
aVand often to animated discussions at friend's homes,
p27
aVwhere we would discuss various issues
p28
aVwhile they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,
p29
aVwhere a drink often cost more than what they'd paid
p30
aVtheir 14-year-old maid.
p31
aVI would feel very isolated during these discussions.
p32
aVBut at the same time, I questioned myself
p33
aVand my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.
p34
aVAnd I decided that I had compromised,
p35
aVjust like my friends in those discussions,
p36
aVwhere we told stories
p37
aVin contexts we made excuses for,
p38
aVrather than taking responsibility for.
p39
aa(lp40
VI won't go into details about what led to a decision I made,
p41
aVbut let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,
p42
aVother substances and a woman.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVI basically decided that it was I,
p45
aVnot the camera or the network,
p46
aVor anything that lay outside myself,
p47
aVthat was the only instrument in storytelling
p48
aVtruly worth tuning.
p49
aVIn my life, when I tried to achieve things
p50
aVlike success or recognition, they eluded me.
p51
aVParadoxically, when I let go of these objectives,
p52
aVand worked from a place of compassion and purpose,
p53
aVlooking for excellence, rather than the results of it,
p54
aVeverything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.
p55
aa(lp56
VPhotography transcended culture, including my own.
p57
aVAnd it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,
p58
aVand gives voice to people and stories without.
p59
aVI invite you into three recent stories of mine,
p60
aVwhich are about this way of looking, if you will,
p61
aVwhich I believe exemplify the tenets
p62
aVof what I like to call compassion in storytelling.
p63
aa(lp64
VIn 2007 I went to Liberia,
p65
aVwhere a group of my friends and I
p66
aVdid an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,
p67
aVon a very legendary and brutal war-lord
p68
aVnamed General Butt Naked.
p69
aVHis real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell
p70
aVwhere he once used to torture and murder people,
p71
aVincluding children.
p72
aVJoshua claims to have personally killed
p73
aVmore than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war.
p74
aVHe got his name from fighting stark naked.
p75
aVAnd he is probably the most prolific mass murderer
p76
aValive on Earth today.
p77
aa(lp78
VThis woman witnessed the General murdering her brother.
p79
aVJoshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,
p80
aVand enforced his command with great brutality.
p81
aVToday many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,
p82
aVand they are destitute, like these young men in the image.
p83
aVHow do you live with yourself
p84
aVif you know you've committed horrific crimes?
p85
aVToday the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.
p86
aVAnd he's on a mission.
p87
aa(lp88
VWe accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth,
p89
aVvisiting villages where he had once killed and raped.
p90
aVHe seeked forgiveness,
p91
aVand he claims to endeavor to improve
p92
aVthe lives of his child-soldiers.
p93
aVDuring this expedition I expected him
p94
aVto be killed outright, and us as well.
p95
aVBut what I saw opened my eyes
p96
aVto an idea of forgiveness
p97
aVwhich I never thought possible.
p98
aVIn the midst of incredible poverty and loss,
p99
aVpeople who had nothing absolved a man
p100
aVwho had taken everything from them.
p101
aVHe begs for forgiveness,
p102
aVand receives it from the same woman
p103
aVwhose brother he murdered.
p104
aVSenegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,
p105
aVwas once a child soldier, under the General's command,
p106
aVuntil he disobeyed orders,
p107
aVand the General shot off both his legs.
p108
aVHe forgives the General in this image.
p109
aVHe risked his life as he walked up to people
p110
aVwhose families he'd murdered.
p111
aa(lp112
VIn this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.
p113
aVAnd Joshua remains silent
p114
aVas they vented their rage against him.
p115
aVThis image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,
p116
aVwith a man, surrounded by various influences,
p117
aVdesperate to hold on to something true within himself,
p118
aVin a context of great suffering that he has created himself.
p119
aa(lp120
VI was intensely moved during all this.
p121
aVBut the question is,
p122
aVdoes forgiveness and redemption replace justice?
p123
aVJoshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind
p124
aVstanding trial for his crimes,
p125
aVand speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,
p126
aVto an audience that often includes his victims.
p127
aVA very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of
p128
aVseparation of church and state.
p129
aa(lp130
VThe second story I'm going to tell you about
p131
aVis about a group of very special fighting women
p132
aVwith rather unique peace-keeping skills.
p133
aVLiberia has been devastated by one of Africa's
p134
aVbloodiest civil wars,
p135
aVwhich has left more than 200,000 people dead,
p136
aVthousands of women scarred by rape and crime
p137
aVon a spectacular scale.
p138
aVLiberia is now home
p139
aVto an all-woman United Nations contingent
p140
aVof Indian peacekeepers.
p141
aa(lp142
VThese women, many from small towns in India,
p143
aVhelp keep the peace, far away from home and family.
p144
aVThey use negotiation and tolerance
p145
aVmore often than an armed response.
p146
aVThe commander told me that a woman could gauge
p147
aVa potentially violent situation
p148
aVmuch better than men.
p149
aVAnd that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.
p150
aVThis man was very drunk,
p151
aVand he was very interested in my camera,
p152
aVuntil he noticed the women, who handled him
p153
aVwith smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VThis contingent seems to be quite lucky,
p157
aVand it has not sustained any casualties,
p158
aVeven though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.
p159
aVAnd yes, all of those people killed were male.
p160
aVMany of the women are married with children,
p161
aVand they say the hardest part of their deployment
p162
aVwas being kept away from their children.
p163
aa(lp164
VI accompanied these women on their patrols,
p165
aVand watched as they walked past men,
p166
aVmany who passed very lewd comments incessantly.
p167
aVAnd when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,
p168
aVshe said, "Don't worry, same thing back home.
p169
aVWe know how to deal with these fellows,"
p170
aVand ignored them.
p171
aa(lp172
VIn a country ravaged by violence against women,
p173
aVIndian peacekeepers have inspired many local women
p174
aVto join the police force.
p175
aVSometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,
p176
aVthe most inspiring stories are the ones
p177
aVthat float just beneath the radar.
p178
aVI came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.
p179
aVAnd one editor told me that she wasn't interested
p180
aVin doing what she called "manual labor stories."
p181
aa(lp182
VIn 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS,
p183
aVwhich, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department.
p184
aVThey answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.
p185
aVAnd all this against incredible logistical odds,
p186
aVlike heat and traffic jams.
p187
aVSomething amazing happened during this shoot.
p188
aVDue to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,
p189
aVa large slum, which had caught fire.
p190
aVAs we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks
p191
aVand stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.
p192
aVThese men were terrified,
p193
aVas the mob attacked our vehicle.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut nonetheless, despite the hostility,
p196
aVfirefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.
p197
aVRunning the gauntlet through hostile crowds,
p198
aVand some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.
p199
aVSome of the local people forcibly took away the hoses
p200
aVfrom the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.
p201
aVNow, hundreds of homes were destroyed.
p202
aVBut the question that lingered in my mind was,
p203
aVwhat causes people to destroy fire trucks
p204
aVheaded to their own homes?
p205
aVWhere does such rage come from?
p206
aVAnd how are we responsible for this?
p207
aV45 percent of the 14 million people
p208
aVwho live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,
p209
aVwhich are chronically overcrowded.
p210
aVThey lack even the most basic amenities.
p211
aVAnd this is something that is common to all our big cities.
p212
aa(lp213
VBack to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire,
p214
aVthousands of drums filled with petrochemicals
p215
aVwere blazing away and exploding all around us.
p216
aVThe heat was so intense, that hoses were used
p217
aVto cool down firefighters
p218
aVfighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.
p219
aVIn India we often love to complain about our government bodies.
p220
aVBut over here, the heads of the DFS,
p221
aVMr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,
p222
aVled the firefight with their men.
p223
aVSomething wonderful in a country where
p224
aVmanual labor is often looked down upon.
p225
aV(Applause)
p226
aa(lp227
VOver the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.
p228
aVAnd I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy,
p229
aVand my own faith in humanity.
p230
aVHowever, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.
p231
aVAnd when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with
p232
aVand they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.
p233
aVSome of the firemen told me that they were also inspired
p234
aVto do better because they were so pleased
p235
aVto get thank-yous rather than brick bats.
p236
aa(lp237
VIt seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS,
p238
aVat least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,
p239
aVread magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.
p240
aVSometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified,
p241
aVregardless of the context,
p242
aVcan help magnify these intangibles three ways,
p243
aVin the protagonist of the story, in the audience,
p244
aVand also in the storyteller.
p245
aVAnd that's the power of storytelling.
p246
aVFocus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful,
p247
aVand it grows. Thank you.
p248
aV(Applause)

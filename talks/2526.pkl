VSo we all have our own biases.
p5
aVFor example, some of us tend to think
p6
aVthat it's very difficult to transform failing government systems.
p7
aVWhen we think of government systems,
p8
aVwe tend to think that they're archaic, set in their ways,
p9
aVand perhaps, the leadership is just too bureaucratic
p10
aVto be able to change things.
p11
aVWell, today, I want to challenge that theory.
p12
aVI want to tell you a story of a very large government system
p13
aVthat has not only put itself on the path of reform
p14
aVbut has also shown fairly spectacular results
p15
aVin less than three years.
p16
aa(lp17
VThis is what a classroom in a public school in India looks like.
p18
aVThere are 1 million such schools in India.
p19
aVAnd even for me, who's lived in India all her life,
p20
aVwalking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking.
p21
aVBy the time kids are 11,
p22
aV50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education
p23
aVthat they have no hope to recover.
p24
aV11-year-olds cannot do simple addition,
p25
aVthey cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence.
p26
aVThese are things that you and I would expect an 8-year-old
p27
aVto be able to do.
p28
aVBy the time kids are 13 or 14,
p29
aVthey tend to drop out of schools.
p30
aVIn India, public schools not only offer free education \u2014
p31
aVthey offer free textbooks, free workbooks, free meals,
p32
aVsometimes even cash scholarships.
p33
aVAnd yet, 40 percent of the parents today
p34
aVare choosing to pull their children out of public schools
p35
aVand pay out of their pockets to put them in private schools.
p36
aVAs a comparison, in a far richer country, the US,
p37
aVthat number is only 10 percent.
p38
aVThat's a huge statement on how broken the Indian public education system is.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo it was with that background that I got a call in the summer of 2013
p41
aVfrom an absolutely brilliant lady called Surina Rajan.
p42
aVShe was, at that time, the head of the Department of School Education
p43
aVin a state called Haryana in India.
p44
aVSo she said to us, "Look, I've been heading this department
p45
aVfor the last two years.
p46
aVI've tried a number of things, and nothing seems to work.
p47
aVCan you possibly help?"
p48
aa(lp49
VLet me describe Haryana a little bit to you.
p50
aVHaryana is a state which has 30 million people.
p51
aVIt has 15,000 public schools
p52
aVand 2 million plus children in those public schools.
p53
aVSo basically, with that phone call,
p54
aVI promised to help a state and system
p55
aVwhich was as large as that of Peru or Canada transform itself.
p56
aVAs I started this project, I was very painfully aware of two things.
p57
aVOne, that I had never done anything like this before.
p58
aVAnd two, many others had, perhaps without too much success.
p59
aVAs my colleagues and I looked across the country
p60
aVand across the world,
p61
aVwe couldn't find another example
p62
aVthat we could just pick up and replicate in Haryana.
p63
aVWe knew that we had to craft our own journey.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut anyway, we jumped right in and as we jumped in,
p66
aVall sorts of ideas started flying at us.
p67
aVPeople said, "Let's change the way we recruit teachers,
p68
aVlet's hire new principals and train them
p69
aVand send them on international learning tours,
p70
aVlet's put technology inside classrooms."
p71
aVBy the end of week one, we had 50 ideas on the table,
p72
aVall amazing, all sounded right.
p73
aVThere was no way we were going to be able to implement 50 things.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo I said, "Hang on, stop.
p76
aVLet's first at least decide what is it we're trying to achieve."
p77
aVSo with a lot of push and pull and debate,
p78
aVHaryana set itself a goal which said: by 2020,
p79
aVwe want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge.
p80
aVNow the specifics of the goal don't matter here,
p81
aVbut what matters is how specific the goal is.
p82
aVBecause it really allowed us to take all those ideas
p83
aVwhich were being thrown at us
p84
aVand say which ones we were going to implement.
p85
aVDoes this idea support this goal? If yes, let's keep it.
p86
aVBut if it doesn't or we're not sure, then let's put it aside.
p87
aVAs simple as it sounds, having a very specific goal right up front
p88
aVhas really allowed us to be very sharp and focused
p89
aVin our transformation journey.
p90
aVAnd looking back over the last two and a half years,
p91
aVthat has been a huge positive for us.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo we had the goal,
p94
aVand now we needed to figure out what are the issues, what is broken.
p95
aVBefore we went into schools, a lot of people told us
p96
aVthat education quality is poor
p97
aVbecause either the teachers are lazy, they don't come into schools,
p98
aVor they're incapable, they actually don't know how to teach.
p99
aVWell, when we went inside schools, we found something completely different.
p100
aVOn most days, most teachers were actually inside schools.
p101
aVAnd when you spoke with them,
p102
aVyou realized they were perfectly capable of teaching elementary classes.
p103
aVBut they were not teaching.
p104
aVI went to a school
p105
aVwhere the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom
p106
aVand a toilet supervised.
p107
aVI went to another school
p108
aVwhere two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch
p109
aVto deposit scholarship money into kids' accounts.
p110
aVAt lunchtime, most teachers were spending all of their time
p111
aVgetting the midday meal cooking, supervised and served to the students.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo we asked the teachers,
p114
aV"What's going on, why are you not teaching?"
p115
aVAnd they said, "This is what's expected of us.
p116
aVWhen a supervisor comes to visit us,
p117
aVthese are exactly the things that he checks.
p118
aVHas the toilet been made, has the meal been served.
p119
aVWhen my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters,
p120
aVthese are exactly the things which are discussed."
p121
aa(lp122
VYou see, what had happened was, over the last two decades,
p123
aVIndia had been fighting the challenge of access, having enough schools,
p124
aVand enrollment, bringing children into the schools.
p125
aVSo the government launched a whole host of programs
p126
aVto address these challenges,
p127
aVand the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs.
p128
aVNot explicitly, but implicitly.
p129
aVAnd now, what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further
p130
aVor to monitor their attendance
p131
aVbut to tell them that what is most important
p132
aVis for them to go back inside classrooms and teach.
p133
aVThey needed to be monitored and measured and awarded
p134
aVon the quality of teaching
p135
aVand not on all sorts of other things.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo as we went through the education system,
p138
aVas we delved into it deeper, we found a few such core root causes
p139
aVwhich were determining, which were shaping how people behaved in the system.
p140
aVAnd we realized that unless we change those specific things,
p141
aVwe could do a number of other things.
p142
aVWe could train, we could put technology into schools,
p143
aVbut the system wouldn't change.
p144
aVAnd addressing these non-obvious core issues
p145
aVbecame a key part of the program.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo, we had the goal and we had the issues,
p148
aVand now we needed to figure out what the solutions were.
p149
aVWe obviously did not want to recreate the wheel,
p150
aVso we said, "Let's look around and see what we can find."
p151
aVAnd we found these beautiful, small pilot experiments
p152
aVall over the country and all over the world.
p153
aVSmall things being done by NGOs, being done by foundations.
p154
aVBut what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled.
p155
aVAll of them were limited to 50, 100 or 500 schools.
p156
aVAnd here, we were looking for a solution for 15,000 schools.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo we looked into why,
p159
aVif these things actually work, why don't they actually scale?
p160
aVWhat happens is that when a typical NGO comes in,
p161
aVthey not only bring in their expertise
p162
aVbut they also bring in additional resources.
p163
aVSo they might bring in money,
p164
aVthey might bring in people,
p165
aVthey might bring in technology.
p166
aVAnd in the 50 or 100 schools that they actually operate in,
p167
aVthose additional resources actually create a difference.
p168
aVBut now imagine that the head of this NGO
p169
aVgoes to the head of the School Education Department
p170
aVand says, "Hey, now let's do this for 15,000 schools."
p171
aVWhere is that guy or girl going to find the money
p172
aVto actually scale this up to 15,000 schools?
p173
aVHe doesn't have the additional money,
p174
aVhe doesn't have the resources.
p175
aVAnd hence, innovations don't scale.
p176
aVSo right at the beginning of the project, what we said was,
p177
aV"Whatever we have to do has to be scalable,
p178
aVit has to work in all 15,000 schools."
p179
aVAnd hence, it has to work within the existing budgets
p180
aVand resources that the state actually has.
p181
aVMuch easier said than done.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VI think this was definitely the point in time
p185
aVwhen my team hated me.
p186
aVWe spent a lot of long hours in office, in cafés,
p187
aVsometimes even in bars,
p188
aVscratching out heads and saying,
p189
aV"Where are the solutions, how are we going to solve this problem?"
p190
aa(lp191
VIn the end, I think we did find solutions to many of the issues.
p192
aVI'll give you an example.
p193
aVIn the context of effective learning,
p194
aVone of the things people talk about is hands-on learning.
p195
aVChildren shouldn't memorize things from books,
p196
aVthey should do activities,
p197
aVand that's a more effective way to learn.
p198
aVWhich basically means giving students things
p199
aVlike beads, learning rods, abacuses.
p200
aVBut we did not have the budgets to give that
p201
aVto 15,000 schools, 2 million children.
p202
aVWe needed another solution.
p203
aVWe couldn't think of anything.
p204
aVOne day, one of our team members went to a school
p205
aVand saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside
p206
aVand take them into the classroom
p207
aVand give them to the students.
p208
aVThat was a huge eureka moment for us.
p209
aVSo what happens now in the textbooks in Haryana
p210
aVis that after every concept, we have a little box
p211
aVwhich are instructions for the teachers which say,
p212
aV"To teach this concept, here's an activity that you can do.
p213
aVAnd by the way, in order to actually do this activity,
p214
aVhere are things that you can use from your immediate environment,
p215
aVwhether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside,
p216
aVwhich can be used as learning aids for kids."
p217
aVAnd we see teachers all over Haryana
p218
aVusing lots of innovative things to be able to teach students.
p219
aVSo in this way, whatever we designed,
p220
aVwe were actually able to implement it
p221
aVacross all 15,000 schools from day one.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow, this brings me to my last point.
p224
aVHow do you implement something across 15,000 schools
p225
aVand 100,000 teachers?
p226
aVThe department used to have a process
p227
aVwhich is very interesting.
p228
aVI like to call it "The Chain of Hope."
p229
aVThey would write a letter from the headquarters
p230
aVand send it to the next level,
p231
aVwhich was the district offices.
p232
aVThey would hope that in each of these district offices,
p233
aVan officer would get the letter, would open it, read it
p234
aVand then forward it to the next level,
p235
aVwhich was the block offices.
p236
aVAnd then you would hope that at the block office,
p237
aVsomebody else got the letter,
p238
aVopened it, read it and forwarded it eventually to the 15,000 principals.
p239
aVAnd then one would hope that the principals
p240
aVgot the letter, received it, understood it
p241
aVand started implementing it.
p242
aVIt was a little bit ridiculous.
p243
aVNow, we knew technology was the answer,
p244
aVbut we also knew that most of these schools
p245
aVdon't have a computer or email.
p246
aVHowever, what the teachers do have are smartphones.
p247
aVThey're constantly on SMS, on Facebook and on WhatsApp.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo what now happens in Haryana is,
p250
aVall principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of WhatsApp groups
p251
aVand anytime something needs to be communicated,
p252
aVit's just posted across all WhatsApp groups.
p253
aVIt spreads like wildfire.
p254
aVYou can immediately check who has received it,
p255
aVwho has read it.
p256
aVTeachers can ask clarification questions instantaneously.
p257
aVAnd what's interesting is,
p258
aVit's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions.
p259
aVAnother teacher from a completely different part of the state
p260
aVwill stand up and answer the question.
p261
aVEverybody's acting as everybody's peer group,
p262
aVand things are getting implemented.
p263
aVSo today, when you go to a school in Haryana,
p264
aVthings look different.
p265
aVThe teachers are back inside classrooms,
p266
aVthey're teaching.
p267
aVOften with innovative techniques.
p268
aVWhen a supervisor comes to visit the classroom,
p269
aVhe or she not only checks the construction of the toilet
p270
aVbut also what is the quality of teaching.
p271
aVOnce a quarter, all students across the state
p272
aVare assessed on their learning outcomes
p273
aVand schools which are doing well are rewarded.
p274
aVAnd schools which are not doing so well
p275
aVfind themselves having difficult conversations.
p276
aVOf course, they also get additional support
p277
aVto be able to do better in the future.
p278
aVIn the context of education,
p279
aVit's very difficult to see results quickly.
p280
aa(lp281
VWhen people talk about systemic, large-scale change,
p282
aVthey talk about periods of 7 years and 10 years.
p283
aVBut not in Haryana.
p284
aVIn the last one year, there have been three independent studies,
p285
aVall measuring student learning outcomes,
p286
aVwhich indicate that something fundamental,
p287
aVsomething unique is happening in Haryana.
p288
aVLearning levels of children have stopped declining,
p289
aVand they have started going up.
p290
aVHaryana is one of the few states in the country
p291
aVwhich is showing an improvement,
p292
aVand certainly the one that is showing the fastest rate of improvement.
p293
aVThese are still early signs,
p294
aVthere's a long way to go,
p295
aVbut this gives us a lot of hope for the future.
p296
aVI recently went to a school,
p297
aVand as I was leaving,
p298
aVI ran into a lady,
p299
aVher name was Parvati,
p300
aVshe was the mother of a child,
p301
aVand she was smiling.
p302
aVAnd I said, "Why are you smiling, what's going on?"
p303
aVAnd she said, "I don't know what's going on,
p304
aVbut what I do know is that my children are learning,
p305
aVthey're having fun,
p306
aVand for the time being, I'll stop my search for a private school
p307
aVto send them to."
p308
aa(lp309
VSo I go back to where I started:
p310
aVCan government systems transform?
p311
aVI certainly believe so.
p312
aVI think if you give them the right levers,
p313
aVthey can move mountains.
p314
aa(lp315
VThank you.

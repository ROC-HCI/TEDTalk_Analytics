VWe're going to talk \u2014 my \u2014 a new lecture, just
p5
aVfor TED \u2014 and I'm going show you some illusions
p6
aVthat we've created for TED, and I'm going to try
p7
aVto relate this to happiness. What I was thinking
p8
aVabout with happiness is, what gives happiness \u2014
p9
aVor happiness, which I equate with joy in my
p10
aVparticular area, and I think there's something very
p11
aVfundamental. And I was thinking about this. And
p12
aVit's in terms of both illusions and movies that we
p13
aVgo see and jokes and magic shows is that there's
p14
aVsomething about these things where our
p15
aVexpectations are violated in some sort of pleasing
p16
aVway. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected
p17
aVtwist \u2014 something that you didn't expect \u2014 and
p18
aVyou find a joyful experience. You look at those
p19
aVsort of illusions in my book and it's not as what
p20
aVyou'd expect. And there's something joyful about
p21
aVit. And it's the same thing with jokes and all
p22
aVthese sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try
p23
aVand do in my lecture is go a little bit further
p24
aVand see if I can violate your expectations in a
p25
aVpleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that
p26
aVare violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try
p27
aVto do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,
p28
aVso I can make the audience here happy.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo I'm going to show you some ways that we can
p31
aVviolate your expectations. First of all, I want to
p32
aVshow you the particular illusion here. I want you
p33
aVfirst of all when it pops up on the screen to
p34
aVnotice that the two holes are perpendicular to
p35
aVeach other. These are all perceptual tricks. These
p36
aVare real objects that I'm going to show you. Now
p37
aVI'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped
p38
aVthe film here so you can get a very interesting
p39
aVexperience. I want you to see how this illusion is
p40
aVconstructed, and it's going to rotate so you see
p41
aVthat it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates
p42
aVback, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.
p43
aVWatch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very
p44
aVbright audience, all right? See if you can stop it
p45
aVfrom happening, even though you know 100 percent it's
p46
aVtrue that \u2014 bam! You can't undo it. What does
p47
aVthat tell you about yourselves? We're going to do
p48
aVit again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop
p49
aVit from happening. No. It's difficult.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd we can violate your expectations in a whole
p52
aVvariety of ways about representation, about shape,
p53
aVabout color and so forth and it's very primal. And
p54
aVit's an interesting question to ponder, why these
p55
aVthings \u2014 we find these things joyful. Why would
p56
aVwe find them joyful? So, here's something that
p57
aVLionel did a while ago. I like these sort of
p58
aVlittle things like this.
p59
aa(lp60
VAgain, this is not an optical trick. This is what
p61
aVyou would see. In other words, it's not a camera
p62
aVcut. It's a perceptual trick.
p63
aVOK. We can violate your expectations about
p64
aVshape.
p65
aVWe can violate your expectations on representation
p66
aV\u2014 what an image represents. What do you see here?
p67
aVHow many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand
p68
aVif you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised
p69
aVtheir hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience,
p70
aVgo talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the
p71
aVbest example of priming by experience that I know.
p72
aVIf you are a child under the age of 10 who
p73
aVhaven't been ruined yet, you will look at this
p74
aVimage and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults
p75
aVhere are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?"
p76
aVBut in fact, if you reversed the figure ground \u2014
p77
aVin other words, the dark areas here \u2014 I forgot to
p78
aVask for a pointer \u2014 but if you reverse it, you'll
p79
aVsee a whole series of little dolphins. By the way,
p80
aVif you're also a student at CalTech \u2014 they also
p81
aVtend to just see the dolphins. It's based on
p82
aVexperience.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, something like this can be used because this
p85
aVis after all talk about design, too. This was
p86
aVdone by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got
p87
aVaway with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at
p88
aVthis ad for beer, all those people are in sort of
p89
aVprovocative positions. But they got it passed, and
p90
aVactually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do
p91
aVthese things.
p92
aVRemember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did
p93
aVwhen the Florida ballot was going around. You
p94
aVknow, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for
p95
aVBush; count 'em again ...
p96
aa(lp97
VYou can violate your expectations about
p98
aVexperience. Here is an outside water fountain that
p99
aVI created with some friends of mine, but you can
p100
aVstop the water in drops and \u2014 actually make all
p101
aVthe drops levitate. This is something we're
p102
aVbuilding for, you know, amusement parks and that
p103
aVkind of stuff.
p104
aVNow let's take a static image. Can you see this?
p105
aVDo you see the middle section moving down and the
p106
aVouter sections moving up? It's completely static.
p107
aVIt's a static image. How many people see this
p108
aVillusion? It's completely static.
p109
aVRight. Now, when \u2014 it's interesting that when we
p110
aVlook at an image we see, you know, color, depth,
p111
aVtexture. And you can look at this whole scene and
p112
aVanalyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than
p113
aVthe wall and so forth. But the whole thing is
p114
aVactually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.
p115
aVAnd it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people
p116
aVgot irritated when they tried to talk to the
p117
aVwoman and she wouldn't respond.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, you can make design mistakes. Like this
p120
aVbuilding in New York. So that when you see it from
p121
aVthis side, it looks like the balconies tilt up,
p122
aVand when you walk around to the other side it
p123
aVlooks like the balconies go down. So there are
p124
aVcases where you have mistakes in design that
p125
aVincorporate illusions.
p126
aVOr, you take this particular un-retouched
p127
aVphotograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot
p128
aVof emails from people who say, "Is there any
p129
aVperceptual difference between males and females?"
p130
aVAnd I really say, "No." I mean, women can navigate
p131
aVthrough the world just as well as males can \u2014 and
p132
aVwhy wouldn't they? However, this is the one
p133
aVillusion that women can consistently do better
p134
aVthan males: in matching which head because they
p135
aVrely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.
p136
aa(lp137
VOkay, now getting to a part \u2014 I want to show
p138
aVdesign in illusions. I believe that the first
p139
aVexample of illusions being used purposely was by
p140
aVda Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So
p141
aVthat when you saw from one little angle was like
p142
aVthis. And this little technique got popular in the
p143
aV16th century and the 17th century to disguise
p144
aVhidden meanings, where you could flip the image and
p145
aVsee it from one little point of view like this.
p146
aVBut these are early incorporations of illusions
p147
aVbrought to \u2014 sort of high point with Hans
p148
aVHolbein's "Ambassadors." And Hans Holbein worked
p149
aVfor Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you
p150
aVcould walk down from the stair and you can see
p151
aVthis hidden skull.
p152
aa(lp153
VAll right, now I'm going to show you some
p154
aVdesigners who work with illusions to give that
p155
aVelement of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott
p156
aVKim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions
p157
aVfor TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one
p158
aVhere on TED and happiness.
p159
aVOK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is
p160
aVgoing to be a delightful talk and he has some of
p161
aVhis really fantastic machines outside. And so, we
p162
aV\u2014 Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur
p163
aVGanson.
p164
aa(lp165
VWell, there's analog and digital. Thought that
p166
aVwas appropriate here.
p167
aVAnd figure goes to ground.
p168
aVAnd for the musicians.
p169
aVAnd of course, since happiness \u2014 we want "joy to the
p170
aVworld."
p171
aVNow, another great designer \u2014 he's very well
p172
aVknown in Japan \u2014 Shigeo Fukuda. And he just
p173
aVbuilds some fantastic things. This is simply
p174
aVamazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view
p175
aVit from one particular angle, you see its
p176
aVreflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.
p177
aVPianist transforms to violinist.
p178
aVThis is really wild. This assemblage of forks,
p179
aVknives and spoons and various cutlery, welded
p180
aVtogether. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn
p181
aVsomething in the sort of thing that I do, which
p182
aVis there are people out there with a lot of time
p183
aVon their hands.
p184
aa(lp185
VKen Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like
p186
aVcreating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells \u2014
p187
aVun-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging
p188
aVthem. He did Einstein out of dice because, after
p189
aVall, Einstein said, "God does not play dice with
p190
aVthe universe." Bert Herzog out of un-retouched
p191
aVkeyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John
p192
aVCederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil
p193
aVcabinets.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running
p196
aV[behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've
p197
aVcreated, some new type of illusions. I've done
p198
aVsomething with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So
p199
aVyou see these kids the same size here, running
p200
aVdown the hall. The two table tops of the same size.
p201
aVThey're looking out two directions at once. You
p202
aVhave a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And
p203
aVthat's something for you to think about, all
p204
aVright? So you see larger pieces fitting in within
p205
aVsmaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which
p206
aVis impossible. You can see the two kids are
p207
aVlooking out simultaneously out of two different
p208
aVdirections at once. Now can you believe these two
p209
aVtable tops are the same size and shape? They are.
p210
aVSo, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say,
p211
aVthose two figures are identical in size and shape.
p212
aVAnd it's interesting, by doing this in this sort
p213
aVof rendered fashion, how much stronger the
p214
aVillusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought
p215
aVyou a little joy and happiness, and if you're
p216
aVinterested in seeing more cool effects, see me
p217
aVoutside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.

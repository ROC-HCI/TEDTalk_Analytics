VNature's my muse and it's been my passion.
p5
aVAs a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.
p6
aVBut five years ago, I went on a personal journey.
p7
aVI wanted to visualize the story of life.
p8
aVIt's the hardest thing I've ever attempted,
p9
aVand there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.
p10
aVBut there were also revelations.
p11
aVAnd one of those I'd like to share with you today.
p12
aa(lp13
VI went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth
p14
aVthe way it was three billion years ago,
p15
aVback before the sky turned blue.
p16
aVThere's stromatolites down there \u2014
p17
aVthe first living things to capture photosynthesis \u2014
p18
aVand it's the only place they still occur today.
p19
aVGoing down there was like entering a time capsule,
p20
aVand I came out with a different sense of myself in time.
p21
aVThe oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites
p22
aVis what we all breathe today.
p23
aa(lp24
VStromatolites are the heroes in my story.
p25
aVI hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.
p26
aVIt's a story about you and me, nature and science.
p27
aVAnd with that said, I'd like to invite you for
p28
aVa short, brief journey of life through time.
p29
aVOur journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ...
p30
aVsolidifying into surface, molded by fire.
p31
aVThe fire gave way, Earth emerged \u2014 but this was an alien planet.
p32
aVThe moon was closer; things were different.
p33
aVHeat from within made geysers erupt \u2014 that is how the oceans were born.
p34
aVWater froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.
p35
aVWater is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.
p36
aVAnd when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut this planet is different \u2014 it's roiling inside.
p39
aVAnd where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.
p40
aVIt arises around cracks in the Earth.
p41
aVMud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria.
p42
aVLearn to multiply, thickening in places ...
p43
aVGrowing living structures under an alien sky ...
p44
aVStromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen.
p45
aVAnd they changed the atmosphere.
p46
aVA breath that's fossilized now as iron.
p47
aa(lp48
VMeteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.
p49
aVLife needs a membrane to contain itself
p50
aVso it can replicate and mutate.
p51
aVThese are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton
p52
aVwith skeletons of silicon ...
p53
aVcircuit boards of the future.
p54
aVShallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed
p55
aVinto more complex forms.
p56
aVIt grew as light and oxygen increased.
p57
aVLife hardened and became defensive.
p58
aVIt learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites.
p59
aVVision was refined in horseshoe crabs,
p60
aVamong the first to leave the sea.
p61
aVThey still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.
p62
aa(lp63
VScorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails.
p64
aVFish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts.
p65
aVLichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ...
p66
aVclinging to rock, and eating it too ... transforming barren land.
p67
aVTrue land plants arose, leafless at first.
p68
aVOnce they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.
p69
aVThe fundamental forms of ferns followed,
p70
aVto bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.
p71
aVLife flourished in swamps.
p72
aa(lp73
VOn land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later.
p74
aVLeatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.
p75
aVIt took time for life to break away from water,
p76
aVand it still beckons all the time.
p77
aVLife turned hard so it could venture inland.
p78
aVAnd the dragons that arose are still among us today.
p79
aVJurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar,
p80
aVand the center of Brazil,
p81
aVwhere plants called "cycads" remain rock hard.
p82
aVForests arose and nurtured things with wings.
p83
aVOne early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.
p84
aVAnd others fly today like echoes of the past.
p85
aVIn birds, life gained new mobility.
p86
aVFlamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway.
p87
aa(lp88
VBirds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants.
p89
aVWater lilies were among the first.
p90
aVPlants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees.
p91
aVIn Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree,
p92
aVand in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.
p93
aVIn Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas.
p94
aVBut when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher.
p95
aVTropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.
p96
aVFungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ...
p97
aVa trick shared by the largest flower on Earth.
p98
aVCo-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever.
p99
aVWhen birds can't fly, they become vulnerable.
p100
aVKiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica.
p101
aa(lp102
VExtinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast.
p103
aVAn asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames.
p104
aVBut there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.
p105
aVWhen the skies cleared, a new world was born.
p106
aVA world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews [came]
p107
aVtenrecs, accustomed to the dark.
p108
aVNew forms became bats. Civets.
p109
aVNew predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still.
p110
aa(lp111
VGrasslands created opportunities.
p112
aVHerd safety came with sharpened senses.
p113
aVGrowing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.
p114
aVSome mammals turned back to water.
p115
aVWalruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek.
p116
aVAnd cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.
p117
aVThere are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz;
p118
aVa horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil.
p119
aVPrimates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first,
p120
aVbecoming lemurs not much later.
p121
aVLearning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open.
p122
aVAnd forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo who are we? Brothers of masculine chimps,
p125
aVsisters of feminine bonobos? We are all of them, and more.
p126
aVWe're molded by the same life force.
p127
aVThe blood veins in our hands
p128
aVechoed a course of water traces on the Earth.
p129
aVAnd our brains \u2014 our celebrated brains \u2014
p130
aVreflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.
p131
aa(lp132
VLife is a force in its own right. It is a new element.
p133
aVAnd it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.
p134
aVAnd where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter,
p135
aVMars is still not very far.
p136
aVBut that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.
p137
aVAnd where water is liquid, it becomes a womb
p138
aVfor cells green with chlorophyll \u2014 and that molecular marvel
p139
aVis what's made a difference \u2014 it powers everything.
p140
aVThe whole animal world today lives on a stockpile
p141
aVof bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly
p142
aVthrough plants and algae, and their waste is our breath,
p143
aVand vice versa.
p144
aVThis Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.
p145
aVWe call it "atmosphere." This is the icon of our journey.
p146
aVAnd you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.
p147
aV(Applause)
p148
aVThank you. Thank you.

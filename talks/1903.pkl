V(Music)
p5
aVFor any of you who have visited or lived in New York City,
p6
aVthese shots might start to look familiar.
p7
aVThis is Central Park,
p8
aVone of the most beautifully designed
p9
aVpublic spaces in America.
p10
aVBut to anyone who hasn't visited,
p11
aVthese images can't really fully convey.
p12
aVTo really understand Central Park,
p13
aVyou have to physically be there.
p14
aVWell, the same is true of the music,
p15
aVwhich my brother and I composed and mapped
p16
aVspecifically for Central Park.
p17
aV(Music)
p18
aa(lp19
VI'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work
p20
aVthat my brother Hays and I are doing \u2014
p21
aVThat's us there. That's both of us actually \u2014
p22
aVspecifically about a concept that we've been developing over the last few years,
p23
aVthis idea of location-aware music.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, my brother and I, we're musicians
p26
aVand music producers.
p27
aVWe've been working together since,
p28
aVwell, since we were kids, really.
p29
aVBut recently, we've become more and more interested
p30
aVin projects where art
p31
aVand technology intersect,
p32
aVfrom creating sight-specific audio
p33
aVand video installation
p34
aVto engineering interactive concerts.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut today I want to focus on this concept
p37
aVof composition for physical space.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut before I go too much further into that,
p40
aVlet me tell you a little bit about how we got started
p41
aVwith this idea.
p42
aVMy brother and I were living in New York City
p43
aVwhen the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude
p44
aVdid their temporary installation, The Gates,
p45
aVin Central Park.
p46
aVHundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures
p47
aVdecorated the park for a number of weeks,
p48
aVand unlike work that's exhibited
p49
aVin a more neutral space,
p50
aVlike on the walls of a gallery or a museum,
p51
aVthis was work that was really in dialogue
p52
aVwith this place,
p53
aVand in a lot of ways, The Gates
p54
aVwas really a celebration
p55
aVof Frederick Olmsted's incredible design.
p56
aVThis was an experience that stayed with us
p57
aVfor a long time, and years later,
p58
aVmy brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C.,
p59
aVand we started to ask the question,
p60
aVwould it be possible,
p61
aVin the same way that The Gates
p62
aVresponded to the physical layout of the park,
p63
aVto compose music for a landscape?
p64
aVWhich brought us to this.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Music)
p67
aa(lp68
VOn Memorial Day, we released "The National Mall,"
p69
aVa location-aware album
p70
aVreleased exclusively as a mobile app
p71
aVthat uses the device's built-in GPS functionality
p72
aVto sonically map the entire park
p73
aVin our hometown of Washington, D.C.
p74
aVHundreds of musical segments
p75
aVare geo-tagged throughout the entire park
p76
aVso that as a listener traverses the landscape,
p77
aVa musical score is actually unfolding around them.
p78
aVSo this is not a playlist or a list of songs
p79
aVintended for the park,
p80
aVbut rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms
p81
aVthat fit together like pieces of a puzzle
p82
aVand blend seamlessly
p83
aVbased on a listener's chosen trajectory.
p84
aVSo think of this as
p85
aVa choose-your-own-adventure of an album.
p86
aa(lp87
VLet's take a closer look.
p88
aVLet's look at one example here.
p89
aVSo using the app,
p90
aVas you make your way towards the grounds
p91
aVsurrounding the Washington Monument,
p92
aVyou hear the sounds of instruments warming up,
p93
aVwhich then gives way to the sound of a mellotron
p94
aVspelling out a very simple melody.
p95
aVThis is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.
p96
aVKeep walking, and a full choir joins in,
p97
aVuntil you finally reach the top of the hill
p98
aVand you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks
p99
aVand all sorts of musical craziness,
p100
aVas if all of these sounds are radiating out
p101
aVfrom this giant obelisk that punctuates
p102
aVthe center of the park.
p103
aVBut were you to walk in the opposite direction,
p104
aVthis entire sequence happens in reverse.
p105
aVAnd were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park,
p106
aVthe music would fade to silence,
p107
aVand the play button would disappear.
p108
aa(lp109
VWe're sometimes contacted by  people in other parts of the world
p110
aVwho can't travel to the United States,
p111
aVbut would like to hear this record.
p112
aVWell, unlike a normal album,
p113
aVwe haven't been able to accommodate this request.
p114
aVWhen they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version,
p115
aVwe just can't make that happen,
p116
aVand the reason is because
p117
aVthis isn't a promotional app
p118
aVor a game to promote or accompany
p119
aVthe release of a traditional record.
p120
aVIn this case, the app is the work itself,
p121
aVand the architecture of the landscape
p122
aVis intrinsic to the listening experience.
p123
aa(lp124
VSix months later, we did a location-aware album
p125
aVfor Central Park,
p126
aVa park that is over two times the size of the National Mall,
p127
aVwith music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow
p128
aVto the Ramble to the Reservoir.
p129
aa(lp130
VCurrently, my brother and I are working on
p131
aVprojects all over the country,
p132
aVbut last spring we started a project,
p133
aVhere actually at Stanford's
p134
aVExperimental Media Art Department,
p135
aVwhere we're creating our largest location-aware album to date,
p136
aVone that will span the entirety of Highway 1
p137
aVhere on the Pacific Coast.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut what we're doing, integrating GPS with music,
p140
aVis really just one idea.
p141
aVBut it speaks to a larger vision
p142
aVfor a music industry that's sometimes struggled
p143
aVto find its footing in this digital age,
p144
aVthat they begin to see these new technologies
p145
aVnot simply as ways of adding bells and whistles
p146
aVto an existing model,
p147
aVbut to dream up entirely new ways
p148
aVfor people to interact with
p149
aVand experience music.
p150
aa(lp151
VThank you.

VThe advances that have taken place in astronomy,
p5
aVcosmology and biology, in the last 10 years,
p6
aVare really extraordinary \u2014
p7
aVto the point where we know more about our universe and how it works
p8
aVthan many of you might imagine.
p9
aVBut there was something else that I've noticed
p10
aVas those changes were taking place, as people were starting to find out that
p11
aVhmm ... yeah, there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy.
p12
aVThe science writers and editors \u2014 I shouldn't say science writers,
p13
aVI should say people who write about science \u2014
p14
aVand editors would sit down over a couple of beers,
p15
aVafter a hard day of work, and start talking about
p16
aVsome of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place,
p19
aVwhich is ways the world could end very suddenly.
p20
aVAnd that's what I want to talk about today. (Laughter)
p21
aVAh, you laugh, you fools. (Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
V(Voice: Can we finish up a little early?)
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter) Yeah, we need the time!
p26
aVStephen Petranek: At first, it all seemed a little fantastical to me, but after challenging a lot of these ideas,
p27
aVI began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September 11 happened,
p28
aVand I thought, ah, God,
p29
aVI can't go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end.
p30
aVNobody wants to hear that. Not after this!
p31
aVAnd that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists,
p32
aVabout maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to,
p33
aVwho was a neuroscientist, said,
p34
aV"You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up,"
p35
aVand reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday
p36
aVand his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem.
p37
aVSo, we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow,
p38
aVand lo and behold, we found them.
p39
aVWhich leads me to a videotape of a President Bush
p40
aVpress conference from a couple of weeks ago.
p41
aVCan we run that, Andrew?
p42
aa(lp43
VPresident George W. Bush: Whatever it costs to defend our security,
p44
aVand whatever it costs to defend our freedom, we must pay it.
p45
aa(lp46
VSP: I agree with the president.
p47
aVHe wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year,
p48
aVa two-trillion-dollar federal budget, which will land us back into deficit spending real fast.
p49
aVBut terrorists aren't the only threat we face.
p50
aVThere are really serious calamities staring us in the eye
p51
aVthat we're in the same kind of denial about
p52
aVthat we were about terrorism, and what could've happened on September 11.
p53
aa(lp54
VI would propose, therefore, that if we took 10 billion dollars
p55
aVfrom that 2.13 trillion dollar budget \u2014
p56
aVwhich is two one hundredths of that budget \u2014
p57
aVand we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems
p58
aVI'm going to talk to you about, the vast majority could be solved,
p59
aVand the rest we could deal with. So, I hope you find this both fascinating \u2014
p60
aVI'm fascinated by this kind of stuff, I gotta admit \u2014
p61
aVto me these are Richard's cockroaches.
p62
aa(lp63
VBut I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world,
p64
aVI hope you take some of this stuff away with you,
p65
aVand when you have an opportunity to be influential,
p66
aVthat you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive.
p69
aVWe live in an incredible age of modern medicine.
p70
aVWe are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago.
p71
aVPeople around the world are getting better medicine \u2014
p72
aVbut mentally, we're falling apart.
p73
aVThe World Health Organization now estimates
p74
aVthat one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed.
p75
aVAnd the World Health Organization also says that depression is the
p76
aVbiggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced.
p77
aa(lp78
VSoon, genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine
p79
aVare going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan.
p80
aVA female child born tomorrow, on average \u2014 median \u2014 will live to age 83.
p81
aVOur life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes.
p82
aVNow the problem with all of this, getting older,
p83
aVis that people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo, what are the solutions?
p86
aVWe don't really have mental health insurance in this country,
p87
aVand it's \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 it's really a crime.
p88
aVSomething like 98 percent of all people with depression,
p89
aVand I mean really severe depression
p90
aV\u2014 I have a friend with stunningly severe depression
p91
aV\u2014 this is a curable disease, with present medicine and present technology.
p92
aVBut it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills.
p93
aVPills alone don't do it, especially in clinically depressed people.
p94
aVYou ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist,
p95
aVand put down your 10-dollar copay, and get treated,
p96
aVjust like you do when you got a cut on your arm. It's ridiculous.
p97
aa(lp98
VSecondly, drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated
p99
aVpsychoactive drugs. We know that most mental illnesses have a biological
p100
aVcomponent that can be dealt with.
p101
aVAnd we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we
p102
aVdid 10 years ago. We need a pump-push from the federal government,
p103
aVthrough NIH and National Science \u2014 NSF \u2014
p104
aVand places like that to start helping the drug companies
p105
aVdevelop some advanced psychoactive drugs.
p106
aa(lp107
VMoving on. Number nine \u2014 don't laugh \u2014 aliens invade Earth.
p108
aVTen years ago, you couldn't have found an astronomer \u2014
p109
aVwell, very few astronomers \u2014 in the world who would've told you that
p110
aVthere are any planets anywhere outside our solar system.
p111
aV1995, we found three. The count now is up to 80 \u2014
p112
aVwe're finding about two or three a month.
p113
aVAll of the ones we've found, by the way, are in this little, teeny, tiny corner where we live,
p114
aVin the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way,
p115
aVand as Carl Sagan insisted for many years,
p116
aVand was laughed at for it, there must be billions and billions in the universe.
p117
aVIn a few years, NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter,
p118
aVwhere there's less dust, and start looking for Earth-like planets,
p119
aVwhich we cannot see with present technology, nor detect.
p120
aVIt's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe,
p121
aVand probably fairly close to us, is a fairly remote idea.
p122
aVAnd the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea.
p123
aa(lp124
VRemember, we've only been an advanced civilization \u2014
p125
aVan industrial civilization, if you would \u2014 for 200 years.
p126
aVAlthough every time I go to Pompeii, I'm amazed that they had
p127
aVthe equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner, too.
p128
aVSo, I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD 79,
p129
aVbut there's a great likelihood. I really believe this,
p130
aVand I don't believe in aliens, and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth
p131
aVor anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a
p132
aVcivilization that is more intelligent than our own.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, what will happen? What if they come to, you know,
p135
aVsuck up our oceans for the hydrogen?
p136
aVAnd swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into
p137
aVthe rainforest and start logging it.
p138
aVWe can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said,
p139
aV"Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect
p140
aVon all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with,
p141
aVeven in those cases where every attempt was made
p142
aVto protect and guard the primitive civilization."
p143
aVIf the aliens come visiting, we're the primitive civilization.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo, what are the solutions to this? (Laughter)
p146
aVThank God you can all read!
p147
aVIt may seem ridiculous, but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this
p148
aVand actually being prepared for them.
p149
aVHow much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan
p150
aVto negotiate with an advanced species?
p151
aa(lp152
VSecondly \u2014 and you're going to hear more from me about this \u2014
p153
aVwe have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation.
p154
aVWe have got to develop the
p155
aVidea that the Earth doesn't last forever,
p156
aVour sun doesn't last forever.
p157
aVIf we want humanity to last forever, we have to colonize the Milky Way.
p158
aVAnd that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point.
p159
aV(Applause)
p160
aVIt'll also help us a lot, if we meet an advanced civilization along the way,
p161
aVif we're trying to be an advanced civilization. Number eight \u2014
p162
aa(lp163
V(Voice: Steve, that's what I'm doing after TED.) (Laughter) (Applause)
p164
aa(lp165
VSP: You've got it! You've got the job.
p166
aa(lp167
VNumber eight: the ecosystem collapses.
p168
aVLast July, in Science, the journal Science,
p169
aV19 oceanographers published a very, very unusual article.
p170
aVIt wasn't really a research report; it was a screed.
p171
aVThey said, we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now,
p172
aVand we want to tell you they're not in trouble, they're near collapse.
p173
aVMany other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger.
p174
aVWe're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record
p175
aVby a factor of 10,000.
p176
aVWe have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years.
p177
aVCalifornia is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years.
p178
aVSomewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree.
p179
aVYou cut down that tree, the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.
p180
aVThere's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to.
p181
aVAnd when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it,
p182
aVlike our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions?
p183
aa(lp184
VThere is some modeling of ecosystems going on now.
p185
aVThe problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly,
p186
aVthat we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late.
p187
aVWe need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble,
p188
aVand we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models.
p189
aVAnd with the kind of computing power we have now,
p190
aVthere is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money.
p191
aVNational Science Foundation needs to say \u2014 you know,
p192
aValmost all the money that's spent on science in this country
p193
aVcomes from the federal government, one way or another.
p194
aVAnd they get to prioritize, you know?
p195
aVThere are people at the National Science Foundation
p196
aVwho get to say, this is the most important thing.
p197
aVThis is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about.
p198
aa(lp199
VSecondly, we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet,
p200
aVand start moving them around.
p201
aVThere's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank,
p202
aVor the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. It's a no-take fishing zone.
p203
aVThey can't fish there for a radius of 200 miles.
p204
aVAnd an amazing thing has happened: almost all the fish have come back,
p205
aVand they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this
p206
aVaround the globe. We're going to have to have no-take zones.
p207
aVWe're going to have to say, no more logging in the Amazon for 20 years.
p208
aVLet it recover, before we start logging again.
p209
aV(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VNumber seven: particle accelerator mishap.
p212
aVYou all remember Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber?
p213
aVOne of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment
p214
aVcould go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world.
p215
aVA lot of very sober-minded physicists, believe it or not,
p216
aVhave had exactly the same thought.
p217
aVThis spring \u2014 there's a collider at Brookhaven, on Long Island \u2014
p218
aVthis spring, it's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes.
p219
aVThey are expecting to create little, tiny black holes.
p220
aVThey expect them to evaporate. (Laughter)
p221
aVI hope they're right. (Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VOther collider experiments \u2014 there's one that's going to take place next summer
p224
aVat CERN \u2014 have the possibility of creating something called strangelets,
p225
aVwhich are kind of like antimatter. Whenever they hit other matter, they destroy it
p226
aVand obliterate it. Most physicists say that the accelerators we have now
p227
aVare not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets
p228
aVthat we need to worry about, and they're probably right.
p229
aVBut, all around the world, in Japan, in Canada,
p230
aVthere's talk about this, of reviving this in the United States.
p231
aVWe shut one down that was going to be big.
p232
aVBut there's talk of building very big accelerators.
p233
aVWhat can we do about this? What are the solutions?
p234
aa(lp235
VWe've got the fox watching the henhouse here.
p236
aVWe need to \u2014 we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics
p237
aVand what should be done in particle physics,
p238
aVbut we need some outside thinking and watchdogging
p239
aVof what's going on with these experiments.
p240
aa(lp241
VSecondly, we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth.
p242
aVWe have an electromagnetic field around the Earth,
p243
aVand it's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, like protons.
p244
aVAnd in my opinion, we don't spend enough time
p245
aVlooking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what's safe to do on Earth.
p246
aa(lp247
VNumber six: biotech disaster.
p248
aVIt's one of my favorite ones, because we've done several stories on Bt corn.
p249
aVBt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer.
p250
aVYou may of heard of it \u2014 heard it called StarLink,
p251
aVespecially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets
p252
aVabout a year and a half ago.
p253
aVThis stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States,
p254
aVand it got into the human food supply, and somebody should've figured out
p255
aVthat it would get in the human food supply very easily.
p256
aVBut the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago, in Mexico,
p257
aVwhere Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal,
p258
aVthey found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.
p259
aVNow, corn originated, we think, in Mexico.
p260
aVThis is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn.
p261
aVThis brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently,
p262
aVthat superweeds and superpests could spread around the world,
p263
aVfrom biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply
p264
aVin very short order.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo, what do we do about that?
p267
aVWe treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants.
p268
aVIt's that simple. This is an amazingly unregulated field.
p269
aVWhen the StarLink disaster happened, there was a battle between the
p270
aVEPA and the FDA over who really had authority, and over what parts of this,
p271
aVand they didn't get it straightened out for months. That's kind of crazy.
p272
aa(lp273
VNumber five, one of my favorites: reversal of the Earth's magnetic field.
p274
aVBelieve it or not, this happens every few hundred thousand years,
p275
aVand has happened many times in our history.
p276
aVNorth Pole goes to the South, South Pole goes to the North, and vice versa.
p277
aVBut what happens, as this occurs,
p278
aVis that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years,
p279
aVand that means that all these cosmic rays and particles
p280
aVthat are to come streaming at us from the sun,
p281
aVthat this field protects us from, are \u2014 well, basically, we're gonna fry. (Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
V(Voice: Steve, I have some additional hats downstairs.)
p284
aa(lp285
VSP: So, what can we do about this? Oh, by the way, we're overdue.
p286
aVIt's been 780,000 years since this happened.
p287
aVSo, it should have happened about 480,000 years ago.
p288
aVOh, and here's one other thing.
p289
aVScientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent.
p290
aVSo, maybe we're in the throes of it.
p291
aVOne of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is,
p292
aVis that we have \u2014 you know, we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago,
p293
aVmuch less data on things like the ozone layer.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, there's a fairly simple solution to this.
p296
aVThere's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online
p297
aVin about six or seven years
p298
aVthat gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply.
p299
aVYou know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes.
p300
aVIt's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms.
p301
aVIf you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth,
p302
aVit would be the thickness of two pennies, at 14 pounds per square inch.
p303
aVYou don't need that much up there.
p304
aVWe need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer.
p305
aV(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VNumber four: giant solar flares.
p308
aVSolar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun
p309
aVthat bombard the Earth with high-speed subatomic particles.
p310
aVSo far, our atmosphere has done, and our magnetic field has done
p311
aVpretty well protecting us from this.
p312
aVOccasionally, we get a flare from the Sun that causes havoc
p313
aVwith communications and so forth, and electricity.
p314
aVBut the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying
p315
aVstars that are similar to our Sun,
p316
aVand they've found that a number of them, when they're about the age of our Sun,
p317
aVbrighten by a factor of as much as 20. Doesn't last for very long.
p318
aVAnd they think these are super-flares, millions of times more powerful
p319
aVthan any flares we've had from our Sun so far.
p320
aa(lp321
VObviously, we don't want one of those. (Laughter)
p322
aVThere's a flip side to it. In studying stars
p323
aVlike our Sun, we've found that they go through periods of diminishment,
p324
aVwhen their total amount of energy that's expelled from them
p325
aVgoes down by maybe one percent.
p326
aVOne percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it would cause one hell of an ice age here.
p327
aVSo, what can we do about this?
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter) Start terraforming Mars. This is one of my favorite subjects.
p330
aVI wrote a story about this in Life magazine in 1993.
p331
aVThis is rocket science, but it's not hard rocket science.
p332
aVEverything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars,
p333
aVand to make a livable planet on Mars, is probably there.
p334
aVAnd you just, literally, have to send little nuclear factories up there
p335
aVthat gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen.
p336
aVThe problem is it takes 300 years to terraform Mars, minimum.
p337
aVReally more like 500 years to do it right.
p338
aVThere's no reason why we shouldn't start now. (Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VNumber three \u2014 isn't this stuff cool? (Laughter)
p341
aVA new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs
p342
aVever since there have been people,
p343
aVand from time to time, the germs sure get the upper hand.
p344
aVIn 1918, we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed 20 million people.
p345
aVThat was back when the population was around 100 million people.
p346
aVThe bubonic plague in Europe, in the Middle Ages,
p347
aVkilled one out of four Europeans.
p348
aVAIDS is coming back. Ebola seems to be rearing its head
p349
aVwith much too much frequency,
p350
aVand old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics.
p351
aVWe've all learned what \u2014 the kind of panic that can occur
p352
aVwhen an old disease rears its head, like anthrax.
p353
aa(lp354
VThe worst possibility is that a very simple germ, like staph,
p355
aVfor which we have one antibiotic that still works, mutates.
p356
aVAnd we know staph can do amazing things.
p357
aVA staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it
p358
aVwhen antibiotics come, and change and mutate.
p359
aVThe danger is that some germ like staph will be \u2014
p360
aVwill mutate into something that's really virulent, very contagious,
p361
aVand will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it.
p362
aVThat's happened before. About 12,000 years ago,
p363
aVthere was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the Americas,
p364
aVand that is thought to have been a virulent disease.
p365
aVSo, what can we do about it?
p366
aa(lp367
VIt is nuts. We give antibiotics \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p368
aVevery cow, every lamb, every chicken, they get antibiotics every day, all.
p369
aVYou know, you go to a restaurant, you eat fish, I got news for you,
p370
aVit's all farmed. You know, you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish,
p371
aVcause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code.
p372
aVThis is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code.
p373
aVWe're telling the germs out there how to fight us.
p374
aVWe gotta fix that. We gotta outlaw that right away.
p375
aa(lp376
VSecondly, our public health system, as we saw with anthrax, is a real disaster.
p377
aVWe have a real, major outbreak of disease in the United States,
p378
aVwe are not prepared to cope with it.
p379
aVNow, there is money in the federal budget, next year,
p380
aVto build up the public health service.
p381
aVBut I don't think to any extent that it really needs to be done.
p382
aa(lp383
VNumber two \u2014 my favorite \u2014 we meet a rogue black hole.
p384
aVYou know, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, really,
p385
aVyou walk into an astronomy convention, and you say,
p386
aV"You know, there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy,"
p387
aVand they're going to hoot you off the stage.
p388
aVAnd now, if you went into one of those conventions and you said,
p389
aV"Well, I don't think black holes are out there," they'd hoot you off the stage.
p390
aVOur comprehension of the way the universe works is really \u2014
p391
aVhas just gained unbelievably in recent years.
p392
aa(lp393
VWe think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the Milky Way alone, our galaxy.
p394
aVAnd these stars have compressed down to maybe something like 12, 15 miles wide,
p395
aVand they are black holes. And they are gobbling up everything around them,
p396
aVincluding light, which is why we can't see them.
p397
aVMost of them should be in orbit around something.
p398
aVBut galaxies are very violent places, and things can be spun out of orbit.
p399
aVAnd also, space is incredibly vast.
p400
aVSo even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit,
p401
aVthe chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote.
p402
aVBut it only has to get close, about a billion miles away, one of these things.
p403
aVAbout a billion miles away, here's what happens to Earth's orbit:
p404
aVit becomes elliptical instead of circular.
p405
aVAnd for three months out of the year,
p406
aVthe surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180.
p407
aVFor three months out of the year, they go to 50 below zero.
p408
aVThat won't work too well. What can we do about this?
p409
aVAnd this is my scariest. (Laughter)
p410
aVI don't have a good answer for this one.
p411
aVAgain, we gotta think about being a colonizing race.
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd finally, number one: biggest danger to life as we know it, I think,
p414
aVa really big asteroid heads for Earth.
p415
aVThe important thing to remember here \u2014 this is not a question of if,
p416
aVthis is a question of when, and how big.
p417
aVIn 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet
p418
aVexploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles.
p419
aVIt had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs.
p420
aVAstronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years.
p421
aVIn 1989, a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth.
p422
aa(lp423
VNothing to worry about, right?
p424
aVIt passed directly through Earth's orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier.
p425
aVA small asteroid, say a half mile wide, would touch off firestorms
p426
aVfollowed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up \u2014
p427
aVCarl Sagan's nuclear winter thing.
p428
aVAn asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions.
p429
aVWe think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide.
p430
aVWhere are they? There's something called the Kuiper belt,
p431
aVwhich \u2014 some people think Pluto's not a planet,
p432
aVthat's where Pluto is, it's in the Kuiper belt.
p433
aVThere's also something a little farther out, called the Oort cloud.
p434
aVThere are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock \u2014 comets, really \u2014
p435
aVout there, that are 50 miles in diameter or more,
p436
aVand they regularly take a little spin,
p437
aVin towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us.
p438
aVOf more concern, I think, is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter.
p439
aVThe folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall \u2014
p440
aVthey're making the first map of the universe, three-dimensional map of the universe \u2014
p441
aVthat there are probably 700,000 asteroids between Mars and Jupiter
p442
aVthat are a half a mile big or bigger.
p443
aVSo you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening?
p444
aVAndrew, can you put that chart up?
p445
aa(lp446
VThis is a chart that Dr. Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute
p447
aVpresented to Congress a few years ago.
p448
aVYou'll notice that the chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you
p449
aVis about one in 20,000, according to the work they've done.
p450
aVNow look at the one right below that.
p451
aVPassenger aircraft crash, one in 20,000.
p452
aVWe spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don't die in airplane accidents,
p453
aVand we're not spending hardly anything on this. And yet, this is completely preventable.
p454
aVWe finally have, just in the last year, the technology to stop this cold.
p455
aVCould we have the solutions?
p456
aa(lp457
VNASA's spending three million dollars a year, three million bucks \u2014
p458
aVthat is like pocket change \u2014 to search for asteroids.
p459
aVBecause we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there,
p460
aVand if it might hit Earth, and when it might hit Earth.
p461
aVAnd they're trying to do that.
p462
aVBut it's going to take them 10 years, at spending three million dollars a year,
p463
aVand even then, they claim they'll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued.
p464
aVComets are a tougher act.
p465
aVWe don't really have the technology to predict comet trajectories,
p466
aVor when one with our name on it might arrive.
p467
aVBut we would have lots of time, if we see it coming.
p468
aVWe really need a dedicated observatory.
p469
aVYou'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of,
p470
aVamateur astronomers? That's because nobody's looking for them, except amateurs.
p471
aVWe need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets.
p472
aa(lp473
VPart two of the solutions: we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid,
p474
aVor alter its trajectory. Now, a year ago, we did an amazing thing.
p475
aVWe sent a probe out to this asteroid belt,
p476
aVcalled NEAR, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous.
p477
aVAnd these guys orbited a 30 \u2014 or no, about a 22-mile long asteroid called Eros.
p478
aVAnd then, of course, you know, they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things,
p479
aVwhere they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything,
p480
aVand then, at the last minute, they landed.
p481
aVWhen the mission was over, they actually landed on the thing.
p482
aVWe have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It's not a big deal.
p483
aVNow, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing
p484
aVis that you don't have anything to push against in space, because there's no air.
p485
aVA nuclear explosion is just as hot,
p486
aVbut we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid,
p487
aVor vaporize it, would be more like it.
p488
aa(lp489
VBut we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them
p490
aVand put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it,
p491
aVwhich would gently, slowly, after a period of time, push it into a different trajectory,
p492
aVwhich, if we've done our math right, would keep it from hitting Earth.
p493
aVThis is just a matter of finding 'em, going there, and doing something about it.
p494
aVI know your head is spinning from all this stuff.
p495
aVYikes! So many big threats!
p496
aa(lp497
VThe thing, I think, to remember, is September 11.
p498
aVWe don't want to get caught flat-footed again.
p499
aVWe know about this stuff.
p500
aVScience has the power to predict the future in many cases now.
p501
aVKnowledge is power.
p502
aVThe worst thing we can do is say, jeez, I got enough to worry about
p503
aVwithout worrying about an asteroid. (Laughter)
p504
aVThat's a mistake that could literally cost us our future.
p505
aVThank you.

VMost of the talks
p5
aVthat you've heard in the last several fabulous days
p6
aVhave been from people who have the characteristic
p7
aVthat they have thought about something,
p8
aVthey are experts, they know what's going on.
p9
aVAll of you know about the topic
p10
aVthat I'm supposed to talk about.
p11
aVThat is, you know what simplicity is,
p12
aVyou know what complexity is.
p13
aVThe trouble is, I don't.
p14
aVAnd what I'm going to do is share with you
p15
aVmy ignorance on this subject.
p16
aa(lp17
VI want you to read this,
p18
aVbecause we're going to come back to it in a moment.
p19
aVThe quote is from
p20
aVthe fabled Potter Stewart
p21
aVopinion on pornography.
p22
aVAnd let me just read it,
p23
aVthe important details here:
p24
aV"Shorthand description, ['hardcore pornography'];
p25
aVand perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it.
p26
aVBut I know it when I see it."
p27
aVI'm going to come back to that in a moment.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo, what is simplicity?
p30
aVIt's good to start with some examples.
p31
aVA coffee cup \u2014 we don't think about coffee cups,
p32
aVbut it's much more interesting than one might think \u2014
p33
aVa coffee cup is a device,
p34
aVwhich has a container and a handle.
p35
aVThe handle enables you to hold it
p36
aVwhen the container is filled with hot liquid.
p37
aVWhy is that important?
p38
aVWell, it enables you to drink coffee.
p39
aVBut also, by the way, the coffee is hot,
p40
aVthe liquid is sterile;
p41
aVyou're not likely to get cholera that way.
p42
aVSo the coffee cup, or the cup with a handle,
p43
aVis one of the tools used by society
p44
aVto maintain public health.
p45
aVScissors are your clothes,
p46
aVglasses enable you to see things
p47
aVand keep you from being eaten by cheetahs
p48
aVor run down by automobiles,
p49
aVand books are, after all, your education.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut there's another class of simple things,
p52
aVwhich are also very important.
p53
aVSimple in function,
p54
aVbut not at all simple in how they're constructed.
p55
aVAnd the two here are just examples.
p56
aVOne is the cellphone, which we use every day.
p57
aVAnd it rests on a complexity,
p58
aVwhich has some characteristics
p59
aVvery different from those that my friend
p60
aVBenoit Mandelbrot discussed,
p61
aVbut are very interesting.
p62
aVAnd the other, of course, is a birth control pill,
p63
aVwhich, in a very simple way,
p64
aVfundamentally changed the structure of society
p65
aVby changing the role of women in it
p66
aVby providing to them
p67
aVthe opportunity to make reproductive choices.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think.
p70
aVAnd here I've corrupted
p71
aVthe Potter Stewart quotation
p72
aVby saying that we can think about something \u2014
p73
aVwhich spans all the way from scissors
p74
aVto the cell phone,
p75
aVInternet and birth control pills \u2014
p76
aVby saying that they're simple,
p77
aVthe functions are simple,
p78
aVand we recognize what that simplicity is
p79
aVwhen we see it.
p80
aa(lp81
VOr there may be another way of doing it,
p82
aVwhich is to think about the problem in terms of what \u2014
p83
aVif you associate with moral philosophers \u2014
p84
aVis called the teapot problem.
p85
aVThe teapot problem I'll pose this way.
p86
aVSuppose you see a teapot,
p87
aVand the teapot is
p88
aVfilled with hot water.
p89
aVAnd you then ask the question:
p90
aVWhy is the water hot?
p91
aVAnd that's a simple question.
p92
aVIt's like, what is simplicity?
p93
aVOne answer would be:
p94
aVbecause the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high
p95
aVand they bounce against things rapidly \u2014
p96
aVthat's a kind of physical science argument.
p97
aVA second argument would be:
p98
aVbecause it was sitting on a stove with the flame on \u2014
p99
aVthat's an historical argument.
p100
aVA third is that I wanted hot water
p101
aVfor tea \u2014
p102
aVthat's an intentional argument.
p103
aVAnd, since this is coming from a moral philosopher,
p104
aVthe fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe.
p105
aVAll of these are possibilities.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe point is that you get into trouble
p108
aVwhen you ask a single question
p109
aVwith a single box for an answer,
p110
aVin which that single question actually is many questions
p111
aVwith quite different meanings,
p112
aVbut with the same words.
p113
aVAsking, "What is simplicity?" I think falls in that category.
p114
aVWhat is the state of science?
p115
aVAnd, interestingly, complexity
p116
aVis very highly evolved.
p117
aVWe have a lot of interesting information
p118
aVabout what complexity is.
p119
aVSimplicity, for reasons
p120
aVthat are a little bit obscure,
p121
aVis almost not pursued,
p122
aVat least in the academic world.
p123
aa(lp124
VWe academics \u2014 I am an academic \u2014
p125
aVwe love complexity.
p126
aVYou can write papers about complexity,
p127
aVand the nice thing about complexity is
p128
aVit's fundamentally intractable in many ways,
p129
aVso you're not responsible for outcomes. (Laughter)
p130
aVSimplicity \u2014 all of you really would like
p131
aVyour Waring Blender in the morning
p132
aVto make whatever a Waring Blender does,
p133
aVbut not explode or play Beethoven.
p134
aVYou're not interested in the limits of these things.
p135
aVSo what one is interested in
p136
aVhas a lot to do with the rewards of the system.
p137
aVAnd there's a lot of rewards in thinking
p138
aVabout complexity and emergence,
p139
aVnot so much in thinking about simplicity.
p140
aVOne of the things I want to do
p141
aVis to help you with a very important task \u2014
p142
aVwhich you may not know that you have very often \u2014
p143
aVwhich is to understand
p144
aVhow to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party
p145
aVand have a conversation. (Laughter)
p146
aVAnd the words that I would like you to focus on
p147
aVare complexity and emergence,
p148
aVbecause these will enable you to start the conversation
p149
aVand then daydream about other things.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VAll right, what is complexity in this view of things,
p154
aVand what is emergence?
p155
aVWe have, actually, a pretty good working definition of complexity.
p156
aVIt is a system, like traffic,
p157
aVwhich has components.
p158
aVThe components interact with one another.
p159
aVThese are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy.
p160
aVIt turns out that, whenever you have that system,
p161
aVweird stuff happens,
p162
aVand you in Los Angeles
p163
aVprobably know this better than anyone.
p164
aVHere's another example,
p165
aVwhich I put up because
p166
aVit's an example of really important current science.
p167
aVYou can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it,
p168
aVbut that's a tiny part
p169
aVof the chemical reactions going on
p170
aVin each of your cells at any given moment.
p171
aVAnd it's like the traffic that you see.
p172
aVThe amazing thing about the cell is that
p173
aVit actually does maintain a fairly stable
p174
aVworking relationship with other cells,
p175
aVbut we don't know why.
p176
aVAnyone who tells you that we understand life,
p177
aVwalk away.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd let me reduce this to the simplest level.
p180
aVWe've heard from Bill Gates recently.
p181
aVAll of us, to some extent, study
p182
aVthis thing called a Bill Gates.
p183
aVTerrific. You learn everything you can about that.
p184
aVAnd then there's another kind of thing that you might study,
p185
aVand you study that hard.
p186
aVThat's a Bono, this is a Bono.
p187
aVBut then, if you know everything you can know about those two things,
p188
aVand you put them together,
p189
aVwhat can you say about this combination?
p190
aVThe answer is, not a lot.
p191
aVAnd that's complexity.
p192
aVNow, imagine building that up to a city, or to a society,
p193
aVand you've got, obviously, an interesting problem.
p194
aa(lp195
VAll right, so let me give you an example
p196
aVof simplicity
p197
aVof a particular kind.
p198
aVAnd I want to introduce a word
p199
aVthat I think is very useful,
p200
aVwhich is stacking.
p201
aVAnd I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity
p202
aVthat has the characteristic
p203
aVthat it is so simple
p204
aVand so reliable
p205
aVthat I can build things with it.
p206
aVOr I'm going to use simple to mean
p207
aVreliable, predictable, repeatable.
p208
aVAnd I'm going to use as an example the Internet,
p209
aVbecause it's a particularly good example
p210
aVof stacked simplicity.
p211
aVWe call it a complex system, which it is,
p212
aVbut it's also something else.
p213
aa(lp214
VThe Internet starts with mathematics,
p215
aVit starts with binary.
p216
aVAnd if you look at the list of things on the bottom,
p217
aVwe are familiar with the Arabic numbers
p218
aVone to 10 and so on.
p219
aVIn binary, one is 0001,
p220
aVseven is 0111.
p221
aVThe question is: Why is binary
p222
aVsimpler than Arabic?
p223
aVAnd the answer is, simply,
p224
aVthat if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily,
p225
aVbut if I hold up this,
p226
aVit's sort of hard to say that I just did seven.
p227
aVThe virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way
p228
aVof representing numbers.
p229
aVAnything else is more complicated.
p230
aVYou can catch errors with it,
p231
aVit's unambiguous in its reading,
p232
aVthere are lots of good things about binary.
p233
aVSo it is very, very simple
p234
aVonce you learn how to read it.
p235
aVNow, if you like to represent
p236
aVthis zero and one of binary,
p237
aVyou need a device.
p238
aVAnd think of things in your life
p239
aVthat are binary,
p240
aVone of them is light switches.
p241
aVThey can be on and off. That's binary.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow wall switches, we all know, fail.
p244
aVBut our friends who are condensed matter physicists
p245
aVmanaged to come up, some 50 years ago,
p246
aVwith a very nice device, shown under that bell jar,
p247
aVwhich is a transistor.
p248
aVA transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.
p249
aVIt turns things on and off,
p250
aVbut it does so without moving parts
p251
aVand it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.
p252
aVSo the second layer of simplicity
p253
aVwas the transistor in the Internet.
p254
aVSo, since the transistor is so simple,
p255
aVyou can put lots of them together.
p256
aVAnd you put lots of them together and you come with
p257
aVsomething called integrated circuits.
p258
aVAnd a current integrated circuit
p259
aVmight have in each one of these chips
p260
aVsomething like a billion transistors,
p261
aVall of which have to work perfectly every time.
p262
aVSo that's the next layer of simplicity,
p263
aVand, in fact, integrated circuits
p264
aVare really simple in the sense that they,
p265
aVin general, work really well.
p266
aa(lp267
VWith integrated circuits, you can build cellphones.
p268
aVYou all are accustomed to having your cellphones work
p269
aVthe large majority of the time.
p270
aVIn Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia
p271
aVin its cell phone coverage, (Laughter)
p272
aVso that we're not accustomed to that all the time,
p273
aVbut some of the time.
p274
aVBut, in fact, if you have cell phones,
p275
aVyou can now go to this nice lady
p276
aVwho's somewhere like Namibia,
p277
aVand who is extremely happy with the fact
p278
aVthat although she does not have
p279
aVan master's degree in
p280
aVelectrical engineering from MIT,
p281
aVshe's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone
p282
aVto get power in some funny way.
p283
aVAnd from that comes the Internet.
p284
aVAnd this is a map of bitflows across the continent.
p285
aVThe two blobs that are light in the middle there
p286
aVare the United States and Europe.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd then back to simplicity again.
p289
aVSo here we have what I think is one of the great ideas,
p290
aVwhich is Google.
p291
aVWhich, in this simple portal
p292
aVmakes the claim
p293
aVthat it makes accessible
p294
aVall of the world's information.
p295
aVBut the point is that
p296
aVthat extraordinary simple idea
p297
aVrests on layers of simplicity
p298
aVeach compounded into a complexity
p299
aVthat is itself simple,
p300
aVin the sense that it is completely reliable.
p301
aa(lp302
VAll right, let me then finish off
p303
aVwith four general statements,
p304
aVan example and two aphorisms.
p305
aVThe characteristics, which I think
p306
aVare useful to think about for simple things:
p307
aVFirst, they are predictable.
p308
aVTheir behavior is predictable.
p309
aVNow, one of the nice characteristics
p310
aVof simple things
p311
aVis you know what it's going to do, in general.
p312
aVSo simplicity and predictability
p313
aVare characteristics of simple things.
p314
aVThe second is, and this is a real world statement,
p315
aVthey're cheap.
p316
aVIf you have things that are cheap enough,
p317
aVpeople will find uses for them,
p318
aVeven if they seem very primitive.
p319
aVSo, for example, stones.
p320
aVYou can build cathedrals out of stones,
p321
aVyou just have to know what it does.
p322
aVYou carve them in blocks and then you
p323
aVpile them on top of one another,
p324
aVand they support weight.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo there has to be function, the function has to be predictable
p327
aVand the cost has to be low.
p328
aVWhat that means is
p329
aVthat you have to have a high performance
p330
aVor value for cost.
p331
aVAnd then I would propose
p332
aVas this last component
p333
aVthat they serve, or have the potential to serve,
p334
aVas building blocks.
p335
aVThat is, you can stack them.
p336
aVAnd stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way,
p337
aVor it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space.
p338
aVBut if you have something that has a function,
p339
aVand it's really cheap,
p340
aVpeople will find new ways of putting it together
p341
aVto make new things.
p342
aVCheap, functional, reliable things
p343
aVunleash the creativity of people
p344
aVwho then build stuff that you could not imagine.
p345
aVThere's no way of predicting the Internet
p346
aVbased on the first transistor.
p347
aVIt just is not possible.
p348
aVSo these are the components.
p349
aa(lp350
VNow, the example
p351
aVis something that I want to give you
p352
aVfrom the work that we ourselves do.
p353
aVWe are very interested in
p354
aVdelivering health care in the developing world,
p355
aVand one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business
p356
aVis to find a way of doing medical diagnosis
p357
aVat as close to zero cost
p358
aVas we can manage.
p359
aVSo, how does one do that?
p360
aVThis is a world in which there's no electricity,
p361
aVthere's no money, there's no medical competence.
p362
aVAnd I don't want to spend your time in going through the details,
p363
aVbut in the lower right-hand corner,
p364
aVyou see an example of the kind of thing that we have.
p365
aVIt's a little paper chip.
p366
aVIt has a few things printed on it
p367
aVusing the same technology
p368
aVthat you use for making comic books,
p369
aVwhich was the inspiration for this particular idea.
p370
aVAnd you put a drop, in this case, of urine at the bottom.
p371
aVIt wicks its way up into these little branches.
p372
aVYou know, no power required.
p373
aVIt turns colors. In this particular case,
p374
aVyou're reading kidney function.
p375
aVAnd, since the health care worker
p376
aVof much of this part of the world
p377
aVis an 18 year-old with an AK-47,
p378
aVwho happens to be out of work and is willing
p379
aVto go around and do this sort of thing,
p380
aVhe can take a picture of it with his cellphone,
p381
aVsend the picture back to where there is a doctor,
p382
aVand the doctor can look at it.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo what you've done is to take a technology,
p385
aVwhich is available everywhere,
p386
aVmake a device, which is extremely cheap,
p387
aVand make it in such a fashion
p388
aVthat it is very, very reliable.
p389
aVIf we can pull this off,
p390
aVif we can build more function,
p391
aVit will be stackable.
p392
aVThat is to say, if we can make the basic technology
p393
aVof one or two things work,
p394
aVit will be applicable to a very, very
p395
aVlarge variety of human conditions,
p396
aVand hence, extendable in both
p397
aVvertical and horizontal directions.
p398
aVPart of my interest in this, I have to say,
p399
aVis that I would like to \u2014 how do I put this politely? \u2014
p400
aVchange the way, or maybe eviscerate,
p401
aVthe capital structure of the U.S. health care system,
p402
aVwhich I think is fundamentally broken.
p403
aa(lp404
VSo, let me close \u2014
p405
aV(Applause)
p406
aa(lp407
VLet me close with my two aphorisms.
p408
aVOne of them is from Mr. Einstein,
p409
aVand he says, "Everything should be made
p410
aVas simple as possible, but not simpler."
p411
aVAnd I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.
p412
aVIf you take too much out
p413
aVof something that's simple, you lose function.
p414
aVYou have to have low cost,
p415
aVbut you also have to have a function.
p416
aVSo you can't make it too simple.
p417
aVAnd the second is a design issue,
p418
aVand it's not directly relevant, but it's a nice statement.
p419
aa(lp420
VThis is by de Saint-Exupery.
p421
aVAnd he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design,
p422
aVnot when you have nothing more to add,
p423
aVbut when you have nothing more to take away."
p424
aVAnd that certainly is going in the right direction.
p425
aVSo, what I think one can begin to do
p426
aVwith this kind of
p427
aVcut at the word simplicity,
p428
aVwhich doesn't cover Brancusi,
p429
aVit doesn't answer the question of
p430
aVwhy Mondrian is better or worse
p431
aVor simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh,
p432
aVand certainly doesn't address the question
p433
aVof whether Mozart is simpler than Bach.
p434
aa(lp435
VBut it does make a point \u2014
p436
aVwhich is one which, in a sense,
p437
aVdifferentiates the real world of people who make things,
p438
aVand the world of people who think about things,
p439
aVwhich is, there is an intellectual merit
p440
aVto asking: How do we make things
p441
aVas simple as we can,
p442
aVas cheap as we can, as functional as we can
p443
aVand as freely interconnectable as we can?
p444
aVIf we make that kind of simplicity in our technology
p445
aVand then give it to you guys,
p446
aVyou can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it.
p447
aa(lp448
VThank you very much.
p449
aa(lp450
V(Applause)
p451
aa(lp452
VChris Anderson: Quick question.
p453
aVSo can you picture
p454
aVthat a science of simplicity
p455
aVmight get to the point where
p456
aVyou could look out at various systems \u2014
p457
aVsay a financial system or a legal system, health system \u2014 and say,
p458
aV"That has got to the point of danger
p459
aVor dysfunctionality for the following reasons,
p460
aVand this is how we might simplify it"?
p461
aa(lp462
VGeorge Whitesides: Yes, I think you could. Because if you look
p463
aVat the components from which the system is made
p464
aVand examine their fragility, or their stability,
p465
aVyou can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis.
p466
aa(lp467
VCA: Have you started to do that?
p468
aVI mean, with the health system, you got a sort of
p469
aVradical solution on the cost side,
p470
aVbut in terms of the system itself?
p471
aa(lp472
VGW: Well, no.
p473
aVHow do I put that simply? No.
p474
aa(lp475

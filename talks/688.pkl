VOne day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.
p5
aVUnder a tree she saw a woman
p6
aVmeditating furiously.
p7
aVThe one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.
p8
aVShe was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
p9
aVTo watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.
p10
aVJust then, with a loud bang,
p11
aVthe heavens opened. (Claps)
p12
aVAnd the god Indra jumped into the clearing.
p13
aVIndra saw the woman, a Sekhri.
p14
aVAh-hah.
p15
aVThe woman paid him no heed.
p16
aVSo, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor,
p17
aVand proceeded to rape her.
p18
aVThen Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!)
p19
aVAnd the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.
p20
aVHe realized at once what had happened.
p21
aVSo, he petitioned the higher gods
p22
aVso that he may have justice.
p23
aVSo, the god Vishnu arrived.
p24
aa(lp25
V"Are there any witnesses?"
p26
aa(lp27
V"Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, the one-eyed monkey
p30
aVreally wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice,
p31
aVso she retold events exactly as they had happened.
p32
aVVishnu gave his judgment.
p33
aa(lp34
V"The god Indra has sinned,
p35
aVin that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin.
p36
aVMay he be called to wash away his sins."
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, Indra arrived,
p39
aVand performed the sacrifice of the horse.
p40
aVAnd so it transpired
p41
aVthat a horse was killed,
p42
aVa god was made sin-free,
p43
aVa Brahmin's ego was appeased,
p44
aVa woman ... was ruined,
p45
aVand a one-eyed monkey was left ...
p46
aVvery confused at what we humans call justice.
p47
aa(lp48
VIn India there is a rape every three minutes.
p49
aVIn India, only 25 percent of rapes
p50
aVcome to a police station,
p51
aVand of these 25 percent that come to a police station,
p52
aVconvictions are only in four percent of the cases.
p53
aVThat's a lot of women who don't get justice.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd it's not only about women.
p56
aVLook around you, look at your own countries.
p57
aVThere is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.
p58
aVIf you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.
p59
aVIf you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis,
p60
aVour tribals, the Naxalites.
p61
aVIf you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.
p62
aVThere is a trend here.
p63
aVAnd the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story,
p64
aValways get to tell their truth as The Truth.
p65
aVSo, have we all become
p66
aVone-eyed \u2014 two-eyed instead of one-eyed \u2014 monkeys?
p67
aVHave we stopped seeing injustice?
p68
aa(lp69
VGood morning.
p70
aV(Applause)
p71
aVYou know, I have told this story
p72
aVclose to 550 times,
p73
aVin audiences in 40 countries,
p74
aVto school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth,
p75
aVand every time it hits something.
p76
aVNow, if I were to go into the same crowd
p77
aVand say, "I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"
p78
aVthey would say, "Thank you very much, we have other things to do."
p79
aVAnd that is the astonishing power of art.
p80
aa(lp81
VArt can go through where other things can't.
p82
aVYou can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices,
p83
aVbreaks through everything that you have as your mask,
p84
aVthat says, "I am this, I am that, I am that."
p85
aVNo. It breaks through those.
p86
aVAnd it reaches somewhere where other things don't.
p87
aVAnd in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change,
p88
aVwe need a language that reaches through.
p89
aa(lp90
VHitler knew it; he used Wagner
p91
aVto make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.
p92
aVAnd Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop
p93
aVthis huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.
p94
aVAnd all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies,
p95
aVand who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require,
p96
aVthey also know the power of the arts.
p97
aa(lp98
VFor me it came very early.
p99
aVWhen I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer,
p100
aVcame upon a phenomenon that worried her.
p101
aVIt was a phenomenon where young brides
p102
aVwere committing suicide in rural Gujarat,
p103
aVbecause they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families.
p104
aVAnd she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.
p105
aVHe came to talk to her and said, "What is this about?"
p106
aVShe told him and he set out the first inquiry
p107
aVinto what today we call Dowry Dance.
p108
aVImagine a dance piece
p109
aVfor the first inquiry into something
p110
aVthat even today kills thousands of women.
p111
aa(lp112
VMany years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook
p113
aVin "The Mahabharata" playing this feisty feminine feminist
p114
aVcalled Draupadi, I had similar experiences.
p115
aVBig fat black mamas in the Bronx
p116
aVused to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!"
p117
aVAnd then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,
p118
aV"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!"
p119
aVAnd then aboriginal women in Africa
p120
aVwould come and say, "This is it!"
p121
aVAnd I thought, "This is what we need,
p122
aVas a language."
p123
aa(lp124
VWe had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health.
p125
aVWell, millions of people around the world die
p126
aVof waterborne disease every year.
p127
aVAnd that's because there is no clean water to drink,
p128
aVor in countries like India,
p129
aVpeople don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.
p130
aVSo, what do they do?
p131
aVThey drink the water they know is dirty,
p132
aVthey get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice
p133
aVand they die.
p134
aVAnd governments have not been able to provide clean water.
p135
aVThey try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.
p136
aVAnd the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.
p137
aVSo what do you do? Do you let them die?
p138
aa(lp139
VWell, somebody had a great idea.
p140
aVAnd it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody
p141
aVbut would help health in every field.
p142
aVMost houses in Asia and India
p143
aVhave a cotton garment.
p144
aVAnd it was discovered, and WHO endorses this,
p145
aVthat a clean cotton garment folded eight times over,
p146
aVcan reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through.
p147
aVSo, why aren't governments blaring this on television?
p148
aVWhy isn't it on every poster across the third world?
p149
aVBecause there is no profit in it.
p150
aVBecause nobody can get a kickback.
p151
aVBut it still needs to get to people.
p152
aVAnd here is one of the ways we get it to people.
p153
aa(lp154
V[Video] Woman: Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.
p155
aa(lp156
VMan: You know how expensive those are.
p157
aVI have a solution that requires neither machine,
p158
aVnor wood, nor cooking gas.
p159
aa(lp160
VWoman: What solution?
p161
aa(lp162
VMan: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.
p163
aa(lp164
VBoy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.
p165
aa(lp166
VMan: I will tell all of you. Just wait.
p167
aa(lp168
VWoman: Here father. (Man: Is it clean?) Woman: Yes, of course.
p169
aa(lp170
VMan: Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds.
p171
aa(lp172
VWoman: All right, father.
p173
aa(lp174
VMan: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.)
p175
aa(lp176
VMan: One, two, three, four folds we make.
p177
aVAll the germs from the water we take.
p178
aa(lp179
VChorus: One, two, three, four folds we make.
p180
aVAll the germs from the water we take.
p181
aVFive, six, seven, eight folds we make.
p182
aVOur drinking water safe we make.
p183
aVFive, six, seven, eight folds we make.
p184
aVOur drinking water safe we make.
p185
aa(lp186
VWoman: Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.
p187
aa(lp188
VMan: So this is the cotton sari.
p189
aVAnd through this we will have clean water.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VI think it's safe to say that all of us here
p194
aVare deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
p195
aVWhile universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution,
p196
aVand governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders,
p197
aVwe are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage,
p198
aVor whether it's domestic violence,
p199
aVwhether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her
p200
aVbecause she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere.
p201
aVSo, why are we not doing something
p202
aVto actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?
p203
aa(lp204
VWhat are we doing to try and make children
p205
aVand young people realize
p206
aVthat violence is something that we indulge in,
p207
aVthat we can stop,
p208
aVand that there are other ways of actually
p209
aVtaking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations
p210
aVinto different things that do not harm other people.
p211
aVWell, here is one such way.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.
p214
aVYour parents were peaceful people.
p215
aVYour grandparents were peaceful people.
p216
aVSo much peace in one place?
p217
aVHow could it be otherwise?
p218
aa(lp219
V(Music)
p220
aa(lp221
VBut, what if ...
p222
aVYes. What if ...
p223
aVOne little gene in you
p224
aVhas been trying to get through?
p225
aVFrom your beginnings in Africa,
p226
aVthrough each generation, may be passed on to you,
p227
aVin your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you.
p228
aVAnd if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.
p229
aa(lp230
VIt's what made you smack your baby brother,
p231
aVstamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.
p232
aVIt's the feeling that wells up from deep inside,
p233
aVwhen your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.
p234
aVWant to kill that cyclist on the way to work,
p235
aVand string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.
p236
aVAnd as for outsiders, white, black or brown,
p237
aVtar and feather them, and whip them out of town.
p238
aa(lp239
VIt's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.
p240
aVToo small for detection, it's your built-in protection.
p241
aVAdrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.
p242
aVYes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.
p243
aVYou're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.
p244
aVCause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.
p245
aa(lp246
VGoodbye, Abraham Lincoln.
p247
aVGoodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.
p248
aVGoodbye, Martin Luther King.
p249
aVHello, gangs from this neighborhood
p250
aVkilling gangs from that neighborhood.
p251
aVHello governments of rich countries
p252
aVselling arms to governments of poor countries
p253
aVwho can't even afford to give them food.
p254
aVHello civilization. Hello, 21st century.
p255
aVLook what we've ...
p256
aVlook what they've done.
p257
aV(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
VMainstream art, cinema,
p260
aVhas been used across the world to talk about social issues.
p261
aVA few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti,
p262
aVwhich suddenly spawned thousands of young people
p263
aVwanting to volunteer for social change.
p264
aVIn Venezuela, one of the most popular
p265
aVsoap operas has a heroine called Crystal.
p266
aVAnd when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer,
p267
aV75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.
p268
aVAnd of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about.
p269
aVAnd there are stand-up comics
p270
aVwho are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo, why is it,
p273
aVthat if we think that we all agree
p274
aVthat we need a better world,
p275
aVwe need a more just world,
p276
aVwhy is it that we are not using the one language
p277
aVthat has consistently showed us
p278
aVthat we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?
p279
aVWhat I need to say to the planners of the world,
p280
aVthe governments, the strategists
p281
aVis, "You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.
p282
aVIt needs to be the yeast."
p283
aVBecause, any future planning,
p284
aVif 2048 is when we want to get there,
p285
aVunless the arts are put with the scientists,
p286
aVwith the economists,
p287
aVwith all those who prepare for the future, badly,
p288
aVwe're not going to get there.
p289
aVAnd unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo, what is it that we require? What is it that we need?
p292
aVWe need to break down our vision
p293
aVof what planners are,
p294
aVof what the correct way of a path is.
p295
aVAnd to say all these years of trying
p296
aVto make a better world, and we have failed.
p297
aVThere are more people being raped. There are more wars.
p298
aVThere are more people dying of simple things.
p299
aVSo, something has got to give. And that is what I want.
p300
aVCan I have my last audio track please?
p301
aa(lp302
VOnce there was a princess who whistled beautifully.
p303
aV(Whistling)
p304
aVHer father the king said, "Don't whistle."
p305
aVHer mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle."
p306
aVBut the princess continued whistling.
p307
aV(Whistling)
p308
aa(lp309
VThe years went by and the princess grew up
p310
aVinto a beautiful young woman,
p311
aVwho whistled even more beautifully.
p312
aV(Whistling)
p313
aVHer father the king said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"
p314
aVHer mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"
p315
aa(lp316
VBut the king had an idea.
p317
aVHe announced a Swayamvara.
p318
aVHe invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
p319
aV"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom
p320
aVand her hand in marriage!"
p321
aVSoon the palace filled with princes whistling.
p322
aV(Whistling)
p323
aVSome whistled badly.
p324
aVSome whistled well.
p325
aVBut nobody could defeat the princess.
p326
aa(lp327
V"Now what shall we do?" said the king.
p328
aV"Now what shall we do?" said the queen.
p329
aVBut the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.
p330
aVI have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men
p331
aVand I am going to ask them
p332
aVif they defeated correctly.
p333
aVAnd if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."
p334
aa(lp335
VSo she went up to each and said, "Do you accept that I have defeated you?"
p336
aVAnd they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?
p337
aVNo way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible."
p338
aVTill finally one prince said,
p339
aV"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."
p340
aV"Uh-huh ..." she said.
p341
aV"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."
p342
aV(Whistling)
p343
aa(lp344
VThank you.
p345
aV(Applause)

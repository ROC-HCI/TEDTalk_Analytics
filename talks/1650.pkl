VYou know, my favorite part of being a dad
p5
aVis the movies I get to watch.
p6
aVI love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,
p7
aVand when my daughter was four,
p8
aVwe got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.
p9
aVIt totally dominated her imagination for months.
p10
aVHer favorite character was Glinda, of course.
p11
aVIt gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress
p12
aVand carry a wand.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut you watch that movie enough times,
p15
aVand you start to realize how unusual it is.
p16
aVNow we live today, and are raising our children,
p17
aVin a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.
p18
aVBut "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.
p19
aVIt did not start that trend.
p20
aVForty years later was when the trend really caught on,
p21
aVwith, interestingly, another movie
p22
aVthat featured a metal guy
p23
aVand a furry guy
p24
aVrescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.
p25
aVDo you know what I'm talking about? (Laughter)
p26
aVYeah.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, there's a big difference between these two movies,
p29
aVa couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz"
p30
aVand all the movies we watch today.
p31
aVOne is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."
p32
aVThe monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.
p33
aVBut I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today,
p34
aVthe wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz
p35
aVthat the prophecy foretold.
p36
aVUse your magic slippers to defeat
p37
aVthe computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."
p38
aVBut that's not how it happens.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnother thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz"
p41
aVto me is that all of the most heroic
p42
aVand wise and even villainous characters
p43
aVare female.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow I started to notice this
p46
aVwhen I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter,
p47
aVwhich was years later, and the situation was different.
p48
aVAt that point I also had a son.
p49
aVHe was only three at the time.
p50
aVHe was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.
p51
aVBut he was the second child,
p52
aVand the level of supervision had plummeted. (Laughter)
p53
aVSo he wandered in,
p54
aVand it imprinted on him
p55
aVlike a mommy duck does to its duckling,
p56
aVand I don't think he understands what's going on,
p57
aVbut he is sure soaking in it.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd I wonder what he's soaking in.
p60
aVIs he picking up on the themes of courage
p61
aVand perseverance and loyalty?
p62
aVIs he picking up on the fact that Luke
p63
aVjoins an army to overthrow the government?
p64
aVIs he picking up on the fact that
p65
aVthere are only boys in the universe
p66
aVexcept for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,
p67
aVwho's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie
p68
aVso that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink
p69
aVto thank him for saving the universe, which he does
p70
aVby the magic that he was born with?
p71
aa(lp72
VCompare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."
p73
aVHow does Dorothy win her movie?
p74
aVBy making friends with everybody
p75
aVand being a leader.
p76
aVThat's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in \u2014
p77
aVOz, right? \u2014 and not the world of dudes fighting,
p78
aVwhich is where we kind of have to be.
p79
aVWhy is there so much Force \u2014 capital F, Force \u2014
p80
aVin the movies we have for our kids,
p81
aVand so little yellow brick road?
p82
aa(lp83
VThere is a lot of great writing about the impact
p84
aVthat the boy-violent movie has on girls,
p85
aVand you should do that reading. It's very good.
p86
aVI haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.
p87
aVI know from my own experience that
p88
aVPrincess Leia did not provide the adequate context
p89
aVthat I could have used in navigating the adult world
p90
aVthat is co-ed. (Laughter)
p91
aVI think there was a first-kiss moment
p92
aVwhen I really expected the credits to start rolling
p93
aVbecause that's the end of the movie, right?
p94
aVI finished my quest, I got the girl.
p95
aVWhy are you still standing there?
p96
aVI don't know what I'm supposed to do.
p97
aa(lp98
VThe movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain
p99
aVand getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room
p100
aVfor other relationships and other journeys.
p101
aVIt's almost as though if you're a boy,
p102
aVyou are a dopey animal,
p103
aVand if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.
p104
aVThere are plenty of exceptions,
p105
aVand I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.
p106
aVBut they do send a message to boys,
p107
aVthat they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.
p108
aVThey are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls
p109
aVhow to defend against the patriarchy,
p110
aVbut they are not necessarily showing boys
p111
aVhow they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.
p112
aVThere's no models for them.
p113
aVAnd we also have some terrific women
p114
aVwho are writing new stories for our kids,
p115
aVand as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,
p116
aVthese are still war movies.
p117
aVAnd, of course, the most successful studio of all time
p118
aVcontinues to crank out classic after classic,
p119
aVevery single one of them about
p120
aVthe journey of a boy, or a man,
p121
aVor two men who are friends, or a man and his son,
p122
aVor two men who are raising a little girl.
p123
aVUntil, as many of you are thinking, this year,
p124
aVwhen they finally came out with "Brave."
p125
aVI recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.
p126
aVDo you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?
p127
aV"Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."
p128
aVIt's very good. Don't let that stop you.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.
p131
aVI don't know if you've heard of this.
p132
aVIt has not yet caught on and caught fire,
p133
aVbut maybe today we will start a movement.
p134
aVAlison Bechdel is a comic book artist,
p135
aVand back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation
p136
aVshe'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.
p137
aVAnd it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:
p138
aa(lp139
VIs there more than one character in the movie
p140
aVthat is female who has lines?
p141
aVSo try to meet that bar.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd is their conversation about something other than
p146
aVthe guy that they both like? (Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VRight? Thank you. (Applause)
p149
aVThank you very much.
p150
aa(lp151
VTwo women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.
p152
aVIt does happen. I've seen it,
p153
aVand yet I very rarely see it in the movies
p154
aVthat we know and love.
p155
aa(lp156
VIn fact, this week I went to see
p157
aVa very high-quality movie, "Argo."
p158
aVRight? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,
p159
aVa consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.
p160
aVIt pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.
p161
aVAnd I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie,
p162
aVI don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie
p163
aVtakes place in this embassy where men and women
p164
aVare hiding out during the hostage crisis.
p165
aVWe've got quite a few scenes of the men
p166
aVhaving deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,
p167
aVand the great moment for one of the actresses is
p168
aVto peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"
p169
aVThat's Hollywood for you.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo let's look at the numbers.
p172
aV2011, of the 100 most popular movies,
p173
aVhow many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?
p174
aVEleven. It's not bad.
p175
aVIt's not as many percent as the number of women
p176
aVwe've just elected to Congress, so that's good.
p177
aVBut there is a number that is greater than this
p178
aVthat's going to bring this room down.
p179
aa(lp180
VLast year, The New York Times published a study
p181
aVthat the government had done.
p182
aVHere's what it said.
p183
aVOne out of five women in America
p184
aVsay that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.
p187
aVI don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.
p188
aVI don't even think that
p189
aVmusic videos or pornography are really directly related to that,
p190
aVbut something is going wrong,
p191
aVand when I hear that statistic,
p192
aVone of the things I think of is
p193
aVthat's a lot of sexual assailants.
p194
aVWho are these guys? What are they learning?
p195
aVWhat are they failing to learn?
p196
aVAre they absorbing the story that
p197
aVa male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence
p198
aVand then collect the reward, which is a woman
p199
aVwho has no friends and doesn't speak?
p200
aVAre we soaking up that story?
p201
aa(lp202
VYou know,
p203
aVas a parent with the privilege
p204
aVof raising a daughter
p205
aVlike all of you who are doing the same thing,
p206
aVwe find this world and this statistic very alarming
p207
aVand we want to prepare them.
p208
aVWe have tools at our disposal like "girl power,"
p209
aVand we hope that that will help,
p210
aVbut I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them
p211
aVif, at the same time, actively or passively,
p212
aVwe are training our sons to maintain their boy power?
p213
aVI mean, I think the Netflix queue
p214
aVis one way that we can do something very important,
p215
aVand I'm talking mainly to the dads here.
p216
aVI think we have got to show our sons
p217
aVa new definition of manhood.
p218
aa(lp219
VThe definition of manhood is already turning upside down.
p220
aVYou've read about how the new economy
p221
aVis changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.
p222
aVThey're throwing it up in the air.
p223
aVSo our sons are going to have to find some way
p224
aVof adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,
p225
aVand I think we really have to show them, and model for them,
p226
aVhow a real man
p227
aVis someone who trusts his sisters
p228
aVand respects them, and wants to be on their team,
p229
aVand stands up against the real bad guys,
p230
aVwho are the men who want to abuse the women.
p231
aVAnd I think our job in the Netflix queue
p232
aVis to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,
p233
aVif we can find them, and to seek out the heroines
p234
aVwho are there,
p235
aVwho show real courage, who bring people together,
p236
aVand to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines
p237
aVand to say, "I want to be on their team,"
p238
aVbecause they're going to be on their team.
p239
aa(lp240
VWhen I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars,"
p241
aVdo you know what she said?
p242
aVObi-Wan.
p243
aVObi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
p244
aVWhat do these two have in common?
p245
aVMaybe it's not just the sparkly dress.
p246
aVI think these people are experts.
p247
aVI think these are the two people in the movie
p248
aVwho know more than anybody else,
p249
aVand they love sharing their knowledge with other people
p250
aVto help them reach their potential.
p251
aVNow, they are leaders.
p252
aVI like that kind of quest for my daughter,
p253
aVand I like that kind of quest for my son.
p254
aVI want more quests like that.
p255
aVI want fewer quests where my son is told,
p256
aV"Go out and fight it alone,"
p257
aVand more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team,
p258
aVmaybe a team led by women,
p259
aVto help other people become better
p260
aVand be better people,
p261
aVlike the Wizard of Oz.
p262
aVThank you.

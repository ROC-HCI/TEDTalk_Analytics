VA couple of years ago,
p5
aVwhen I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach,
p6
aVI met Harriet.
p7
aVWe'd actually met online before \u2014 not the way you're thinking.
p8
aVWe were introduced because we both knew Linda Avey,
p9
aVone of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies.
p10
aVAnd because we shared our genetic information with Linda,
p11
aVshe could see that Harriet and I shared
p12
aVa very rare type of mitochondrial DNA, haplotype K1a1b1a,
p13
aVwhich meant we were distantly related.
p14
aVWe actually share the same genealogy with Ötzi the Iceman.
p15
aVSo \u2014 Ötzi, Harriet and me.
p16
aVAnd being the current day, of course, we started our own Facebook group.
p17
aVYou're all welcome to join.
p18
aVWhen I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED conference,
p19
aVshe'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype T-shirts.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VWhy am I telling you this story?
p24
aVWhat does it have to do with the future of health?
p25
aVWell, the way I met Harriet is an example
p26
aVof how leveraging cross-disciplinary, exponentially growing technologies
p27
aVis affecting our future of health and wellness \u2014
p28
aVfrom low-cost gene analysis
p29
aVto the ability to do powerful bioinformatics
p30
aVto the connection of the Internet and social networking.
p31
aVWhat I'd like to talk about today
p32
aVis understanding these exponential technologies.
p33
aVWe often think linearly.
p34
aVBut if you think about it, if you have a lily pad
p35
aVand it just divided every single day \u2014
p36
aVtwo, four, eight, sixteen \u2014 in 15 days, you'd have 32,000.
p37
aVWhat do you think you'd have in a month?
p38
aVWe're at a billion.
p39
aVIf we start to think exponentially,
p40
aVwe can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us.
p41
aa(lp42
VMany of these technologies, speaking as a physician and innovator,
p43
aVwe can start to leverage, to impact the future of our own health
p44
aVand of health care,
p45
aVand to address many of the major challenges in health care today,
p46
aVranging from the exponential costs to the aging population,
p47
aVthe way we really don't use information very well today,
p48
aVthe fragmentation of care
p49
aVand the often very difficult course of adoption of innovation.
p50
aVAnd one of the major things we can do is move the curve to the left.
p51
aVWe spend most of our money on the last 20 percent of life.
p52
aVWhat if we could incentivize physicians in the health care system
p53
aVand our own selves
p54
aVto move the curve to the left and improve our health,
p55
aVleveraging technology as well?
p56
aVNow my favorite example of exponential technology,
p57
aVwe all have in our pocket.
p58
aVIf you think about it, these are really dramatically improving.
p59
aVI mean, this is the iPhone 4.
p60
aVImagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, I've gained some insight into this.
p63
aVI've been the track share for the medicine portion
p64
aVof a new institution called Singularity University,
p65
aVbased in Silicon Valley.
p66
aVWe bring together each summer about 100 very talented students
p67
aVfrom around the world.
p68
aVAnd we look at these exponential technologies from medicine,
p69
aVbiotech, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, space,
p70
aVand address how we can cross-train and leverage these
p71
aVto impact major unmet goals.
p72
aVWe also have seven-day executive programs.
p73
aVAnd coming up next month is FutureMed,
p74
aVa program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, I mentioned the phone.
p77
aVThese mobile phones have over 20,000 different mobile apps available.
p78
aVThere's one out of the UK where you can pee on a little chip,
p79
aVconnect it to your iPhone,
p80
aVand check for an STD.
p81
aVI don't know if I'd try that, but it's available.
p82
aVThere are other sorts of applications.
p83
aVMerging your phone and diagnostics, for example,
p84
aVmeasuring your blood glucose on your iPhone
p85
aVand sending that to your physician,
p86
aVso they can better understand and you can better understand
p87
aVyour blood sugars as a diabetic.
p88
aVSo let's see how exponential technologies are taking health care.
p89
aVLet's start with faster.
p90
aVIt's no secret that computers, through Moore's law,
p91
aVare speeding up faster and faster.
p92
aa(lp93
VWe can do more powerful things with them.
p94
aVThey're really approaching \u2014 in many cases, surpassing \u2014
p95
aVthe ability of the human mind.
p96
aVBut where I think computational speed is most applicable is in imaging.
p97
aVThe ability now to look inside the body in real time
p98
aVwith very high resolution
p99
aVis really becoming incredible.
p100
aVAnd we're layering multiple technologies \u2014 PET scans, CT scans
p101
aVand molecular diagnostics \u2014
p102
aVto find and seek things at different levels.
p103
aVHere you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today,
p104
aVof Marc Hodosh, the curator of TEDMED.
p105
aVAnd now we can see inside of the brain
p106
aVat a resolution and ability never before available,
p107
aVand essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even reengineer
p108
aVor backwards engineer the brain,
p109
aVso we can better understand pathology, disease and therapy.
p110
aVWe can look inside with real-time fMRI in the brain at real time.
p111
aVAnd by understanding these sorts of processes and these connections,
p112
aVwe're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation
p113
aVand better personalize and make effective, for example,
p114
aVpsychoactive drugs.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe scanners for these are getting smaller, less expensive
p117
aVand more portable.
p118
aVAnd this sort of data explosion available from these
p119
aVis really almost becoming a challenge.
p120
aVThe scan of today takes up about 800 books, or 20 gigabytes.
p121
aVThe scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte, or 800,000 books.
p122
aVHow do you leverage that information?
p123
aVLet's get personal.
p124
aVI won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy, but if you're over age 50,
p125
aVit's time for your screening colonoscopy.
p126
aVHow'd you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick?
p127
aVNow there's essentially virtual colonoscopy.
p128
aVCompare those two pictures.
p129
aVAs a radiologist, you can basically fly through your patient's colon,
p130
aVand augmenting that with artificial intelligence,
p131
aVpotentially identify a lesion that we might have missed,
p132
aVbut using AI on top of radiology,
p133
aVwe can find lesions that were missed before.
p134
aVMaybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies
p135
aVthat wouldn't have otherwise.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis is an example of this paradigm shift.
p138
aVWe're moving to this integration of biomedicine, information technology,
p139
aVwireless and, I would say, mobile now \u2014 this era of digital medicine.
p140
aVEven my stethoscope is now digital, and of course, there's an app for that.
p141
aVWe're moving, obviously, to the era of the tricorder.
p142
aVSo the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing
p143
aVand supplanting the stethoscope.
p144
aVThese are now at a price point of what used to be 100,000 euros
p145
aVor a couple hundred-thousand dollars.
p146
aVFor about 5,000 dollars,
p147
aVI can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand.
p148
aVMerging this now with the advent of electronic medical records \u2014
p149
aVin the US, we're still less than 20 percent electronic;
p150
aVhere in the Netherlands, I think it's more than 80 percent.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow that we're switching to merging medical data,
p153
aVmaking it available electronically,
p154
aVwe can crowd-source the information, and as a physician,
p155
aVI can access my patients' data from wherever I am,
p156
aVjust through my mobile device.
p157
aVAnd now, of course, we're in the era of the iPad, even the iPad 2.
p158
aVJust last month,
p159
aVthe first FDA-approved application was approved
p160
aVto allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices.
p161
aVSo certainly, the physicians of today, including myself,
p162
aVare completely reliable on these devices.
p163
aVAnd as you saw just about a month ago,
p164
aVWatson from IBM beat the two champions in "Jeopardy."
p165
aVSo I want you to imagine when, in a couple of years,
p166
aVwe've started to apply this cloud-based information,
p167
aVwhen we really have the AI physician and leverage our brains to connectivity
p168
aVto make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done.
p169
aVAlready today, you don't need to go to your physician in many cases.
p170
aVOnly in about 20 percent of visits do you need to lay hands on the patient.
p171
aVWe're now in the era of virtual visits.
p172
aVFrom Skype-type visits you can do with American Well,
p173
aVto Cisco, that's developed a very complex health presence system,
p174
aa(lp175
Vthe ability to interact with your health care provider is different.
p176
aVAnd these are being augmented even by our devices, again, today.
p177
aVMy friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration,
p178
aVso I can save her a trip to the emergency room,
p179
aVand do diagnostics that way.
p180
aVOr maybe we can leverage today's gaming technology,
p181
aVlike the Microsoft Kinect,
p182
aVhack that to enable diagnostics, for example, in diagnosing stroke,
p183
aVusing simple motion detection, using $100 devices.
p184
aVWe can actually now visit our patients robotically.
p185
aVThis is the RP7;
p186
aVif I'm a hematologist, I can visit another clinic or hospital.
p187
aVThese are being augmented by a whole suite of tools
p188
aVactually in the home now.
p189
aVWe already have wireless scales.
p190
aVYou step on the scale, tweet your weight to your friends,
p191
aVthey can keep you in line.
p192
aa(lp193
VWe have wireless blood pressure cuffs.
p194
aVA whole gamut of technologies are being put together.
p195
aVInstead of wearing kludgy devices, we put on a simple patch.
p196
aVThis was developed at Stanford.
p197
aVIt's called iRhythm; it completely supplants the prior technology
p198
aVat a much lower price point, with much more effectivity.
p199
aVWe're also in the era today of quantified self.
p200
aVConsumers now can basically buy $100 devices, like this little Fitbit.
p201
aVI can measure my steps, my caloric outtake.
p202
aVI can get insight into that on a daily basis
p203
aVand share it with my friends or physician.
p204
aVThere's watches that measure your heart rate, Zeo sleep monitors,
p205
aVa suite of tools that enable you to leverage
p206
aVand have insight into your own health.
p207
aa(lp208
VAs we start to integrate this information,
p209
aVwe'll know better what to do with it, and have better insight
p210
aVinto our own pathologies, health and wellness.
p211
aVThere's even mirrors that can pick up your pulse rate.
p212
aVAnd I would argue, in the future,
p213
aVwe'll have wearable devices in our clothes, monitoring us 24/7.
p214
aVAnd just like the OnStar system in cars, your red light might go on.
p215
aVIt won't say "check engine"; it'll be a "check your body" light,
p216
aVand you'll go get it taken care of.
p217
aVProbably in a few years,
p218
aVyou'll look in your mirror and it'll be diagnosing you.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VFor those of you with kiddos at home,
p223
aVhow would you like a wireless diaper that supports your \u2014
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VMore information, I think, than you might need,
p228
aVbut it's going to be here.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow, we've heard a lot today about technology and connection.
p231
aVAnd I think some of these technologies
p232
aVwill enable us to be more connected with our patients, to take more time
p233
aVand do the important human-touch elements of medicine,
p234
aVas augmented by these technologies.
p235
aVNow, we've talked about augmenting the patient.
p236
aVHow about augmenting the physician?
p237
aVWe're now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon,
p238
aVwho can now go into the body and do robotic surgery, which is here today,
p239
aVat a level that was not really possible even five years ago.
p240
aVAnd now this is being augmented with further layers of technology,
p241
aVlike augmented reality.
p242
aVSo the surgeon can see inside the patient, through their lens,
p243
aVwhere the tumor is, where the blood vessels are.
p244
aVThis can be integrated with decision support.
p245
aVA surgeon in New York can help a surgeon in Amsterdam, for example.
p246
aVAnd we're entering an era of truly scarless surgery called NOTES,
p247
aVwhere the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach
p248
aVand pull out that gallbladder,
p249
aVall in a scarless way and robotically.
p250
aVThis is called NOTES, and it's coming \u2014 basically scarless surgery,
p251
aVas mediated by robotic surgery.
p252
aa(lp253
VNow, how about controlling other elements?
p254
aVFor those who have disabilities \u2014 the paraplegic,
p255
aVthere's the brain-computer interface, or BCI,
p256
aVwhere chips have been put on the motor cortex
p257
aVof completely quadriplegic patients,
p258
aVand they can control a cursor or a wheelchair
p259
aVor, potentially, a robotic arm.
p260
aVThese devices are getting smaller
p261
aVand going into more and more of these patients.
p262
aVStill in clinical trials,
p263
aVbut imagine when we can connect these, for example,
p264
aVto the amazing bionic limb,
p265
aVsuch as the DEKA Arm, built by Dean Kamen and colleagues,
p266
aVwhich has 17 degrees of motion and freedom,
p267
aVand can allow the person who's lost a limb
p268
aVto have much higher dexterity or control than they've had in the past.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo we're really entering the era of wearable robotics, actually.
p271
aVIf you haven't lost a limb but had a stroke,
p272
aVyou can wear these augmented limbs.
p273
aVOr if you're a paraplegic \u2014 I've visited the folks at Berkeley Bionics \u2014
p274
aVthey've developed eLEGS.
p275
aVI took this video last week.
p276
aVHere's a paraplegic patient, walking by strapping on these exoskeletons.
p277
aVHe's otherwise completely wheelchair-bound.
p278
aVThis is the early era of wearable robotics.
p279
aVAnd by leveraging these sorts of technologies,
p280
aVwe're going to change the definition of disability
p281
aVto, in some cases, be superability, or super-enabling.
p282
aVThis is Aimee Mullins, who lost her lower limbs as a young child,
p283
aVand Hugh Herr, who's a professor at MIT,
p284
aVwho lost his limbs in a climbing accident.
p285
aVAnd now both of them can climb better, move faster, swim differently
p286
aVwith their prosthetics than us normal-abled persons.
p287
aa(lp288
VHow about other exponentials?
p289
aVClearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction,
p290
aVincluding with huge costs.
p291
aVBut the trend in medicine is to get exponentially smaller.
p292
aVA few examples: we're now in the era of "Fantastic Voyage," the iPill.
p293
aVYou can swallow this completely integrated device.
p294
aVIt can take pictures of your GI system,
p295
aVhelp diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract.
p296
aVWe get into even smaller micro-robots
p297
aVthat will eventually, autonomously, move through your system,
p298
aVand be able to do things surgeons can't do
p299
aVin a much less invasive manner.
p300
aVSometimes these might self-assemble in your GI system,
p301
aVand be augmented in that reality.
p302
aa(lp303
VOn the cardiac side, pacemakers are getting smaller
p304
aVand much easier to place,
p305
aVso no need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them.
p306
aVAnd they'll be wirelessly telemetered to your mobile devices,
p307
aVso you can go places and be monitored remotely.
p308
aVThese are shrinking even further.
p309
aVThis one is in prototyping by Medtronic; it's smaller than a penny.
p310
aVArtificial retinas, the ability to put arrays on the back of the eyeball
p311
aVand allow the blind to see \u2014
p312
aValso in early trials, but moving into the future.
p313
aVThese are going to be game-changing.
p314
aVOr for those of us who are sighted,
p315
aVhow about having the assisted-living contact lens?
p316
aVBluetooth, Wi-Fi available \u2014 beams back images to your eye.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VNow, if you have trouble maintaining your diet,
p321
aVit might help to have some extra imagery
p322
aVto remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you.
p323
aa(lp324
VHow about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone
p325
aVto see at a microscopic level
p326
aVand to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics?
p327
aVIn fact, the whole era of laboratory medicine
p328
aVis completely changing.
p329
aVWe can now leverage microfluidics,
p330
aVlike this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford.
p331
aVMicrofluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians;
p332
aVput it on a chip, enable thousands of tests at the point of care,
p333
aVanywhere in the world.
p334
aVThis will really leverage technology to the rural and the underserved
p335
aVand enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done for pennies,
p336
aVand at the point of care.
p337
aVIf we go down the small pathway a little bit further,
p338
aVwe're entering the era of nanomedicine,
p339
aVthe ability to make devices super-small,
p340
aVto the point where we can design red blood cells
p341
aVor microrobots that monitor our blood system or immune system,
p342
aVor even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries.
p343
aa(lp344
VNow how about exponentially cheaper?
p345
aVNot something we usually think about in the era of medicine,
p346
aVbut hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars for 10 megabytes \u2014 exponentially cheaper.
p347
aVIn genomics now, the genome cost about a billion dollars
p348
aVabout 10 years ago, when the first one came out.
p349
aVWe're now approaching essentially a $1,000 genome, probably next year.
p350
aVAnd in two years, a $100 genome.
p351
aVWhat will we do with $100 genomes?
p352
aVSoon we'll have millions of these tests available.
p353
aVThen it gets interesting, when we start to crowd-source that information,
p354
aVand enter the era of true personalized medicine:
p355
aVthe right drug for the right person at the right time,
p356
aVinstead of what we're doing now, which is the same drug for everybody,
p357
aVblockbuster drug medications, which don't work for the individual.
p358
aVMany different companies are working on leveraging these approaches.
p359
aa(lp360
VI'll show you a simple example, from 23andMe again.
p361
aVMy data indicates I've got about average risk
p362
aVfor developing macular degeneration, a kind of blindness.
p363
aVBut if I take that same data, upload it to deCODEme,
p364
aVI can look at my risk for type 2 diabetes; I'm at almost twice the risk.
p365
aVI might want to watch how much dessert I have at lunch, for example.
p366
aVIt might change my behavior.
p367
aVLeveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics:
p368
aVhow my genes modulate, what my drugs do and what doses I need
p369
aVwill become increasingly important,
p370
aVand once in the hands of individuals and patients,
p371
aVwill make better drug dosing and selection available.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo again, it's not just genes, it's multiple details \u2014
p374
aVour habits, our environmental exposures.
p375
aVWhen was the last time your doctor asked where you've lived?
p376
aVGeomedicine: where you live, what you've been exposed to,
p377
aVcan dramatically affect your health.
p378
aVWe can capture that information.
p379
aVGenomics, proteomics, the environment \u2014
p380
aVall this data streaming at us individually and as physicians:
p381
aVHow do we manage it?
p382
aVWe're now entering the era of systems medicine, systems biology,
p383
aVwhere we can start to integrate all this information.
p384
aVAnd by looking at the patterns, for example, in our blood,
p385
aVof 10,000 biomarkers in a single test,
p386
aVwe can look at patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage.
p387
aVThis is called by Lee Hood, the father of the field, P4 Medicine.
p388
aVWe'll be predictive and know what you're likely to have.
p389
aVWe can be preventative; that prevention can be personalized.
p390
aVMore importantly, it'll be increasingly participatory.
p391
aVThrough websites like PatientsLikeMe
p392
aVor managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health,
p393
aVleveraging this together in participatory ways
p394
aVwill be increasingly important.
p395
aa(lp396
VI'll finish up with exponentially better.
p397
aVWe'd like to get therapies better and more effective.
p398
aVToday we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills.
p399
aVWhat if we take a new device,
p400
aVknock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure,
p401
aVand in a single therapy, basically cure hypertension?
p402
aVThis is a new device doing essentially that.
p403
aVIt should be on the market in a year or two.
p404
aVHow about more targeted therapies for cancer?
p405
aVI'm an oncologist and know that most of what we give is essentially poison.
p406
aVWe learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells,
p407
aVthe ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse.
p408
aVSo if you think of cancer as a weed,
p409
aVwe often can whack the weed away and it seems to shrink,
p410
aVbut it often comes back.
p411
aVSo we're attacking the wrong target.
p412
aVThe cancer stem cells remain,
p413
aVand the tumor can return months or years later.
p414
aVWe're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells
p415
aVand identify those as targets and go for the long-term cure.
p416
aVWe're entering the era of personalized oncology,
p417
aVthe ability to leverage all of this data together,
p418
aVanalyze the tumor
p419
aVand come up with a real, specific cocktail for the individual patient.
p420
aa(lp421
VI'll close with regenerative medicine.
p422
aVI've studied a lot about stem cells.
p423
aVEmbryonic stem cells are particularly powerful.
p424
aVWe have adult stem cells throughout our body;
p425
aVwe use those in bone marrow transplantation.
p426
aVGeron, last year, started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells
p427
aVto treat spinal cord injuries.
p428
aVStill a phase I trial, but evolving.
p429
aVWe've been using adult stem cells in clinical trials for about 15 years
p430
aVto approach a whole range of topics, particularly cardiovascular disease.
p431
aVIf we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack,
p432
aVwe can see much improved heart function and better survival
p433
aVusing our own bone marrow derived cells after a heart attack.
p434
aa(lp435
VI invented a device called the MarrowMiner,
p436
aVa much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow.
p437
aVIt's now been FDA approved; hopefully on the market in the next year.
p438
aVHopefully you can appreciate the device
p439
aVgoing through the patient's body removing bone marrow, not with 200 punctures,
p440
aVbut with a single puncture, under local anesthesia.
p441
aa(lp442
VWhere is stem-cell therapy going?
p443
aVIf you think about it,
p444
aVevery cell in your body has the same DNA you had when you were an embryo.
p445
aVWe can now reprogram your skin cells
p446
aVto actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell
p447
aVand utilize those, potentially, to treat multiple organs in the same patient,
p448
aVmaking personalized stem cell lines.
p449
aVI think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking
p450
aVto have in the freezer your own cardiac cells, myocytes and neural cells
p451
aVto use them in the future, should you need them.
p452
aVWe're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering,
p453
aVand integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3D organ printing,
p454
aVreplacing the ink with cells,
p455
aVand essentially building and reconstructing a 3D organ.
p456
aa(lp457
VThat's where things are heading.
p458
aVStill very early days,
p459
aVbut I think, as integration of exponential technologies,
p460
aVthis is the example.
p461
aVSo in closing, as you think about technology trends
p462
aVand how to impact health and medicine,
p463
aVwe're entering an era of miniaturization,
p464
aVdecentralization and personalization.
p465
aVAnd by pulling these things together,
p466
aVif we start to think about how to understand and leverage them,
p467
aVwe're going to empower the patient, enable the doctor, enhance wellness
p468
aVand begin to cure the well before they get sick.
p469
aVBecause I know as a doctor, if someone comes to me with stage I disease,
p470
aVI'm thrilled; we can often cure them.
p471
aVBut often it's too late,
p472
aVand it's stage III or IV cancer, for example.
p473
aVSo by leveraging these technologies together,
p474
aVI think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage 0 medicine.
p475
aVAnd as a cancer doctor, I'm looking forward to being out of a job.
p476
aa(lp477
VThanks very much.
p478
aa(lp479

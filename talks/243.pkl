VI have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.
p5
aVI'm giving a short slide show this morning
p6
aVthat I'm giving for the very first time, so \u2014
p7
aVwell it's \u2014 I don't want or need to raise the bar,
p8
aVI'm actually trying to lower the bar.
p9
aVBecause I've cobbled this together
p10
aVto try to meet the challenge of this session.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation
p13
aVthat religion really properly understood
p14
aVis not about belief, but about behavior.
p15
aVPerhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.
p16
aVHow dare we be optimistic?
p17
aVOptimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.
p18
aVAs Mahatma Gandhi famously said,
p19
aV"You must become the change you wish to see in the world."
p20
aVAnd the outcome about which
p21
aVwe wish to be optimistic is not going to be created
p22
aVby the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief
p23
aVbrings about new behavior. But the word "behavior"
p24
aVis also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.
p25
aVI'm a big advocate of changing
p26
aVthe lightbulbs and buying hybrids,
p27
aVand Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house,
p28
aVand dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.
p29
aVBut, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs,
p30
aVit is more important to change the laws.
p31
aVAnd when we change our behavior in our daily lives,
p32
aVwe sometimes leave out the citizenship part
p33
aVand the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this,
p34
aVwe have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.
p35
aVIn order to solve the climate crisis,
p36
aVwe have to solve the democracy crisis.
p37
aVAnd we have one.
p38
aa(lp39
VI have been trying to tell this story for a long time.
p40
aVI was reminded of that recently, by a woman
p41
aVwho walked past the table I was sitting at,
p42
aVjust staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s,
p43
aVlooked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it
p44
aVuntil I saw from the corner of my eye
p45
aVshe was walking from the opposite direction,
p46
aValso just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?"
p47
aVAnd she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black,
p48
aVyou would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VMany years ago, when I was a young congressman,
p51
aVI spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge
p52
aVof nuclear arms control \u2014 the nuclear arms race.
p53
aVAnd the military historians taught me,
p54
aVduring that quest, that military conflicts are typically
p55
aVput into three categories: local battles,
p56
aVregional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important
p57
aVglobal, world war \u2014 strategic conflicts.
p58
aVAnd each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources,
p59
aVa different approach,
p60
aVa different organizational model.
p61
aVEnvironmental challenges fall into the same three categories,
p62
aVand most of what we think about
p63
aVare local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution,
p64
aVhazardous waste dumps. But there are also
p65
aVregional environmental problems, like acid rain
p66
aVfrom the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe
p67
aVto the Arctic, and from the Midwest
p68
aVout the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.
p69
aVAnd there are lots of those. But the climate crisis
p70
aVis the rare but all-important
p71
aVglobal, or strategic, conflict.
p72
aVEverything is affected. And we have to organize our response
p73
aVappropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization
p74
aVfor renewable energy, conservation, efficiency
p75
aVand a global transition to a low-carbon economy.
p76
aVWe have work to do. And we can mobilize resources
p77
aVand political will. But the political will
p78
aVhas to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.
p79
aa(lp80
VLet me show you these slides here.
p81
aVI thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here,
p82
aVof course, is the North Polar ice cap.
p83
aVGreenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the
p84
aVpolar ice cap \u2014 the North Polar ice cap \u2014 looked like
p85
aVat the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.
p86
aVThis last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center
p87
aVin Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers
p88
aVhere in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.
p89
aVThis is what's happened in the last 28 years.
p90
aVTo put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.
p91
aVHere's what happened last fall
p92
aVthat has really unnerved the researchers.
p93
aVThe North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically \u2014
p94
aVdoesn't look quite the same size \u2014
p95
aVbut it is exactly the same size as the United States,
p96
aVminus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.
p97
aVThe amount that disappeared in 2005
p98
aVwas equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.
p99
aVThe extra amount that disappeared last fall
p100
aVwas equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter,
p101
aVbut not as permanent ice, as thin ice \u2014
p102
aVvulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone
p103
aVin summer in as little as five years.
p104
aVThat puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
p105
aVAlready, around the Arctic Circle \u2014
p106
aVthis is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town
p107
aVin Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.
p108
aVThe amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting
p109
aVof an area equivalent to the size of California.
p110
aa(lp111
V"They were the best of times,
p112
aVthey were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence
p113
aVin English literature. I want to share briefly
p114
aVa tale of two planets. Earth and Venus
p115
aVare exactly the same size. Earth's diameter
p116
aVis about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.
p117
aVThey have exactly the same amount of carbon.
p118
aVBut the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon
p119
aVhas been leeched over time out of the atmosphere,
p120
aVdeposited in the ground as coal, oil,
p121
aVnatural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it
p122
aVis in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature
p123
aVis 59 degrees on average. On Venus,
p124
aVit's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy
p125
aVof taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,
p126
aVand putting it into the atmosphere.
p127
aVIt's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
p128
aVIt's three times hotter than Mercury,
p129
aVwhich is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly,
p130
aVhere's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images,
p131
aVbut I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe global scientific community says:
p134
aVman-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere,
p135
aVthickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.
p136
aVYou all know that. At the last
p137
aVIPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say,
p138
aV"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent."
p139
aVThe Chinese objected, and so the compromise was
p140
aV"more than 90 percent."
p141
aVNow, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute,
p142
aVthis could be variations in this energy
p143
aVcoming in from the sun." If that were true,
p144
aVthe stratosphere would be heated as well as the
p145
aVlower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.
p146
aVIf it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would
p147
aVexpect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.
p148
aVHere's the stratosphere: cooler.
p149
aVCSI: Climate.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe
p152
aVthat human activity is responsible
p153
aVfor global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up
p154
aVin a significant way. There has been progress,
p155
aVbut here is the key: when given a list
p156
aVof challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.
p157
aVWhat is missing is a sense of urgency.
p158
aVIf you agree with the factual analysis,
p159
aVbut you don't feel the sense of urgency,
p160
aVwhere does that leave you?
p161
aVWell, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head
p162
aVin conjunction with Current TV \u2014 who did this pro bono \u2014
p163
aVdid a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.
p164
aVThis is the winner.
p165
aa(lp166
VNBC \u2014 I'll show all of the networks here \u2014 the top journalists
p167
aVfor NBC asked 956 questions in 2007
p168
aVof the presidential candidates: two of them were about
p169
aVthe climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.
p170
aVFox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.
p171
aVFrom laughs to tears \u2014 this is one of the older
p172
aVtobacco commercials.
p173
aVSo here's what we're doing.
p174
aVThis is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.
p175
aVBut it's not just the developed nations.
p176
aVThe developing countries are now following us
p177
aVand accelerating their pace. And actually,
p178
aVtheir cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent
p179
aVto where we were in 1965. And they're catching up
p180
aVvery dramatically. The total concentrations:
p181
aVby 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.
p182
aVIf the wealthy countries were completely missing
p183
aVfrom the picture, we would still have this crisis.
p184
aVBut we have given to the developing countries
p185
aVthe technologies and the ways of thinking
p186
aVthat are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia \u2014
p187
aVover thirty years.
p188
aa(lp189
VThis is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s.
p190
aV'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.
p191
aVWe have the technologies.
p192
aVWe have to have a unified view of how to go about this:
p193
aVthe struggle against poverty in the world
p194
aVand the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions,
p195
aVall has a single, very simple solution.
p196
aa(lp197
VPeople say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.
p198
aVPut a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral,
p199
aVto replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck \u2014
p200
aVand some things have changed
p201
aVsince the 19th century.
p202
aVIn the poor world, we have to integrate the responses
p203
aVto poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.
p204
aVPlans to fight poverty in Uganda
p205
aVare mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut responses can actually make a huge difference
p208
aVin the poor countries. This is a proposal
p209
aVthat has been talked about a lot in Europe.
p210
aVThis was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating
p211
aVsolar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid"
p212
aVto supply all of the electrical power
p213
aVto Europe, largely from developing countries \u2014 high-voltage DC currents.
p214
aVThis is not pie in the sky; this can be done.
p215
aa(lp216
VWe need to do it for our own economy.
p217
aVThe latest figures show that the old model
p218
aVis not working. There are a lot of great investments
p219
aVthat you can make. If you are investing in tar sands
p220
aVor shale oil, then you have a portfolio
p221
aVthat is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.
p222
aVAnd it is based on an old model.
p223
aVJunkies find veins in their toes when the ones
p224
aVin their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands
p225
aVand coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments
p226
aVthat I personally think make sense.
p227
aVI have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.
p228
aVBut geothermal, concentrating solar,
p229
aVadvanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation.
p230
aa(lp231
VYou've seen this slide before, but there's a change.
p232
aVThe only two countries that didn't ratify
p233
aV\u2014 and now there's only one. Australia had an election.
p234
aVAnd there was a campaign in Australia
p235
aVthat involved television and Internet and radio commercials
p236
aVto lift the sense of urgency for the people there.
p237
aVAnd we trained 250 people to give the slide show
p238
aVin every town and village and city in Australia.
p239
aVLot of other things contributed to it,
p240
aVbut the new Prime Minister announced that
p241
aVhis very first priority would be to change Australia's position
p242
aVon Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness
p243
aVpartly because of the horrible drought that they have had.
p244
aVThis is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen
p245
aVsaid that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names,
p246
aVwe'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina,
p247
aVand we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.
p248
aVWe can't wait for the kind of drought
p249
aVAustralia had to change our political culture.
p250
aVHere's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
p251
aVare up to 780 \u2014 and I thought I saw one go by there,
p252
aVjust to localize this \u2014 which is good news.
p253
aa(lp254
VNow, to close, we heard a couple of days ago
p255
aVabout the value of making individual heroism so commonplace
p256
aVthat it becomes banal or routine.
p257
aVWhat we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive
p258
aVin the United States of America
p259
aVtoday especially, but also the rest of the world,
p260
aVhave to somehow understand that history
p261
aVhas presented us with a choice \u2014 just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out
p262
aVhow to save her life while she was distracted
p263
aVby the amazing experience that she was going through.
p264
aVWe now have a culture of distraction.
p265
aVBut we have a planetary emergency.
p266
aVAnd we have to find a way to create,
p267
aVin the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.
p268
aVI wish I could find the words to convey this.
p269
aVThis was another hero generation
p270
aVthat brought democracy to the planet.
p271
aVAnother that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.
p272
aVWe can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it.
p273
aVIf we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War,
p274
aVwe could be well on the way to solving this challenge.
p275
aVWe have the capacity to do it.
p276
aa(lp277
VOne final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe
p278
aVwe have the capacity, at moments of great challenge,
p279
aVto set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge
p280
aVthat history is presenting to us.
p281
aVSometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis
p282
aVby saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.
p283
aVWhat a burden we have." I would like to ask you
p284
aVto reframe that. How many generations
p285
aVin all of human history have had the opportunity
p286
aVto rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?
p287
aVA challenge that can pull from us
p288
aVmore than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach
p289
aVthis challenge with a sense of profound joy
p290
aVand gratitude that we are the generation
p291
aVabout which, a thousand years from now,
p292
aVphilharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate
p293
aVby saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves
p294
aVto solve this crisis and lay the basis
p295
aVfor a bright and optimistic human future.
p296
aa(lp297
VLet's do that. Thank you very much.
p298
aa(lp299
VChris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain
p300
aVthat basically a design issue
p301
aVon a voting form \u2014
p302
aVone bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard
p303
aVlike that in the last eight years in a position
p304
aVwhere you could make these things come true.
p305
aVThat hurts.
p306
aa(lp307
VAl Gore: You have no idea. (Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VCA: When you look at what the leading candidates
p310
aVin your own party are doing now \u2014 I mean, there's \u2014
p311
aVare you excited by their plans on global warming?
p312
aa(lp313
VAG: The answer to the question is hard for me
p314
aVbecause, on the one hand, I think that
p315
aVwe should feel really great about the fact
p316
aVthat the Republican nominee \u2014 certain nominee \u2014
p317
aVJohn McCain, and both of the finalists
p318
aVfor the Democratic nomination \u2014 all three have a very different
p319
aVand forward-leaning position
p320
aVon the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership,
p321
aVand all three are very different from the approach taken
p322
aVby the current administration. And I think
p323
aVthat all three have also been responsible in
p324
aVputting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that \u2014
p325
aVas illustrated by the questions \u2014
p326
aVthat was put together by the
p327
aVLeague of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions \u2014
p328
aVand, by the way, the debates have all been
p329
aVsponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label,
p330
aV"Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?
p331
aVEvery single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal."
p332
aV"Now, even lower emissions!"
p333
aa(lp334
VThe richness and fullness of the dialogue
p335
aVin our democracy has not laid the basis
p336
aVfor the kind of bold initiative that is really needed.
p337
aVSo they're saying the right things and they may \u2014
p338
aVwhichever of them is elected \u2014 may do the right thing,
p339
aVbut let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto
p340
aVin 1997, with a feeling of great happiness
p341
aVthat we'd gotten that breakthrough there,
p342
aVand then confronted the United States Senate,
p343
aVonly one out of 100 senators was willing to vote
p344
aVto confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say
p345
aVhas to be laid alongside what the people say.
p346
aa(lp347
VThis challenge is part of the fabric
p348
aVof our whole civilization.
p349
aVCO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.
p350
aVAnd now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern
p351
aVrequires a scope, a scale, a speed of change
p352
aVthat is beyond what we have done in the past.
p353
aVSo that's why I began by saying,
p354
aVbe optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.
p355
aVDemand \u2014 change the light bulbs,
p356
aVbut change the laws. Change the global treaties.
p357
aVWe have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy \u2014 this \u2014
p358
aVWe have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.
p359
aVUse the Internet. Go on the Internet.
p360
aVConnect with people. Become very active as citizens.
p361
aVHave a moratorium \u2014 we shouldn't
p362
aVhave any new coal-fired generating plants
p363
aVthat aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to
p364
aVquickly build these renewable sources.
p365
aVNow, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe
p366
aVthat between now and November, it is possible.
p367
aVThis Alliance for Climate Protection
p368
aVis going to launch a nationwide campaign \u2014
p369
aVgrassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads,
p370
aVradio, newspaper \u2014 with partnerships with everybody
p371
aVfrom the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.
p372
aa(lp373
VWe need help. We need help.
p374
aa(lp375
VCA: In terms of your own personal role going forward,
p376
aVAl, is there something more than that
p377
aVyou would like to be doing?
p378
aa(lp379
VAG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer
p380
aVto that question. What can I do?
p381
aVBuckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future
p382
aVof all human civilization depended on me, what would I do?
p383
aVHow would I be?" It does depend on all of us,
p384
aVbut again, not just with the light bulbs.
p385
aVWe, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy.
p386
aVWe can change things, but we have to actively change.
p387
aVWhat's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.
p388
aVAnd that's hard to \u2014
p389
aVthat's hard to create \u2014 but it is coming.
p390
aVThere's an old African proverb that some of you know
p391
aVthat says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone;
p392
aVif you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly.
p393
aVSo we have to have a change in consciousness.
p394
aVA change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.
p395
aVA new appreciation for the privilege
p396
aVthat we have of undertaking this challenge.
p397
aa(lp398
VCA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED.
p399
aa(lp400
VAG: Thank you. Thank you very much.

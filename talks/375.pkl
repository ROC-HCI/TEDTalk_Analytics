VYou might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,
p5
aVand one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.
p6
aVSo, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.
p7
aVIt's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.
p8
aVAnd it comes in a male form, too \u2014
p9
aVvery glamorous.
p10
aVNot only can he shoot, drive, drink \u2014 you know, he drinks wine,
p11
aVthere actually is a little wine in there \u2014
p12
aVand of course, always wears a tuxedo.
p13
aVBut I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning \u2014
p14
aVone that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,
p15
aVbut also comes in other forms.
p16
aa(lp17
VA magazine?
p18
aVWell, it's certainly not this one.
p19
aVThis is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand \u2014 it's all about sex tips.
p20
aVSex tips are not glamorous.
p21
aVAnd Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,
p22
aVis not glamorous either.
p23
aVBut there is a glamour of industry.
p24
aVThis is Margaret Bourke-White's \u2014
p25
aVone of her pictures she did.
p26
aVFantastic, glamorous pictures
p27
aVof steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.
p28
aVAnd there's the mythic glamour
p29
aVof the garage entrepreneur.
p30
aVThis is the Hewlett-Packard garage.
p31
aVWe know everyone who starts a business in a garage
p32
aVends up founding Hewlett-Packard.
p33
aVThere's the glamour of physics.
p34
aVWhat could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,
p35
aVgrand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene \u2014
p36
aVhe has other kinds of glamour.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd there is, of course, this glamour.
p39
aVThis is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space \u2014
p40
aVand not the alien-style glamour,
p41
aVbut the nice, clean, early '60s version.
p42
aVSo what do we mean by glamour?
p43
aVWell, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means
p44
aVis you can look in the dictionary.
p45
aVAnd it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,
p46
aVin this case the 1913 dictionary.
p47
aVBecause for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,
p48
aVand the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.
p49
aVYou had "a" glamour.
p50
aVIt wasn't glamour as a quality \u2014 you "cast a glamour."
p51
aVGlamour was a literal magic spell.
p52
aVNot a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,
p53
aVbut a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies
p54
aVand to some extent, Celtic magic.
p55
aVAnd over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,
p56
aVit started to take on this other kind of deception \u2014
p57
aVthis definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,
p58
aVan object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.
p59
aVBut still, glamour is an illusion.
p60
aVGlamour is a magic spell.
p61
aVAnd there's something dangerous about glamour
p62
aVthroughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell
p63
aVon you, it was not in your self-interest \u2014
p64
aVit was to get you to act against your interest.
p65
aa(lp66
VWell of course, in the 20th century,
p67
aVglamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.
p68
aVAnd this is Hedy Lamarr.
p69
aVHedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,
p70
aVall you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter)
p71
aVBut in fact, with all due respect to Hedy \u2014
p72
aVabout whom we'll hear more later \u2014 there's a lot more to it.
p73
aVThere was a tremendous amount of technical achievement
p74
aVassociated with creating this Hollywood glamour.
p75
aVThere were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.
p76
aVYou can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood
p77
aVand see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors
p78
aVdepending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.
p79
aVSo you've got this highly stylized portrait of something
p80
aVthat was not entirely of this earth \u2014 it was a portrait of a star.
p81
aVAnd actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time \u2014
p82
aVthey call them false color.
p83
aa(lp84
VGlamour is a form of falsification,
p85
aVbut falsification to achieve a particular purpose.
p86
aVIt may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.
p87
aVAnd it involves a great deal of technique.
p88
aVIt's not \u2014 glamour is not something \u2014
p89
aVyou don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.
p90
aVEven Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.
p91
aVThere is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,"
p92
aVand it's not just the case for people.
p93
aVGlamour doesn't have to be people.
p94
aVArchitectural photography \u2014
p95
aVJulius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,
p96
aVtook this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.
p97
aVArchitectural photography is extremely glamorous.
p98
aVIt puts you into this special, special world.
p99
aVThis is Alex Ross's comic book art,
p100
aVwhich appears to be extremely realistic,
p101
aVas part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.
p102
aVExcept that light doesn't work this way in the real world.
p103
aa(lp104
VWhen you stack people in rows,
p105
aVthe ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground \u2014
p106
aVbut not in the world of glamour.
p107
aVWhat glamour is all about \u2014 I took this from a blurb
p108
aVin the table of contents of New York magazine,
p109
aVwhich was telling us that glamour is back \u2014
p110
aVglamour is all about transcending the everyday.
p111
aVAnd I think that that's starting to get at what the core
p112
aVthat combines all sorts of glamour is.
p113
aVThis is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.
p114
aVAnd I don't know who she is either,
p115
aVbut this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.
p116
aVIt's a very glamorous portrait.
p117
aVWhy is it glamorous?
p118
aVIt's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful \u2014
p119
aVbut that does not make you glamorous,
p120
aVthat only makes you beautiful.
p121
aVShe is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,
p122
aVand those are the central qualities of glamour.
p123
aVYou don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.
p124
aVShe's not looking away from you exactly,
p125
aVbut you have to mentally imagine her world.
p126
aVShe's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world
p127
aVto which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil
p128
aVwhile holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.
p129
aVMel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" \u2014 not glamorous.
p130
aVThat's glamour:
p131
aVthat's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesus
p132
aVand they're both awfully happy and pleasant.
p133
aa(lp134
VGlamour invites us to live in a different world.
p135
aVIt has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant \u2014
p136
aVthat's why, often in these glamour shots,
p137
aVthe person is not looking at the audience,
p138
aVit's why sunglasses are glamorous \u2014
p139
aVbut also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.
p140
aVIn some sense, there has to be something like us.
p141
aVSo as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.
p142
aVGod cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,
p143
aVomniscient \u2014 too far above us.
p144
aVAnd yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary
p145
aVwill often be portrayed \u2014 not always \u2014 in glamorous forms.
p146
aVAs I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,
p147
aVbut it has to have this transcendent quality.
p148
aVWhat is it about Superman?
p149
aVAside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,
p150
aVone thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.
p151
aa(lp152
VGlamour is all about transcending this world
p153
aVand getting to an idealized, perfect place.
p154
aVAnd this is one reason that modes of transportation
p155
aVtend to be extremely glamorous.
p156
aVThe less experience we have with them,
p157
aVthe more glamorous they are.
p158
aVSo you can do a glamorized picture of a car,
p159
aVbut you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.
p160
aVYou can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.
p161
aVThe notion is that it's going to transport you,
p162
aVand the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,
p163
aVwho has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.
p164
aVThe story is about where you're arriving,
p165
aVor thinking about where you're arriving.
p166
aVAnd this sense of being transported
p167
aVis one reason that we have glamour styling.
p168
aVThis sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous
p169
aVbecause we associate it with movies of that period, but because,
p170
aVin it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe same thing \u2014 arches are very glamorous.
p173
aVArches with stained glass \u2014 even more glamorous.
p174
aVStaircases that curve away from you are glamorous.
p175
aVI happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous
p176
aVbecause, to me, it captures the whole promise
p177
aVof the academic contemplative life \u2014
p178
aVbut maybe that's because I went to Princeton.
p179
aVAnyway, skylines are super glamorous,
p180
aVcity streets \u2014 not so glamorous.
p181
aVYou know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.
p182
aVThe horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.
p183
aVThere are few things more glamorous than the horizon \u2014
p184
aVexcept, possibly, multiple horizons.
p185
aVOf course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat \u2014
p186
aVyou just see the possibilities.
p187
aVIn order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality
p188
aVof sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione
p189
aVin his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."
p190
aVThere's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,
p191
aVafter a few centuries.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.
p194
aVIt makes things look effortless.
p195
aVYou don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress \u2014
p196
aVshe just looks completely natural.
p197
aVAnd I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,
p198
aVhow Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.
p199
aVOf course, they covered that with make-up,
p200
aVbecause Lara Croft did all those same stunts \u2014
p201
aVbut she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.
p202
aV"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":
p203
aVAnd this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.
p204
aVGlamour is about editing.
p205
aVHow do you create the sense of transcendence,
p206
aVthe sense of evoking a perfect world?
p207
aVThe sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this \u2014
p208
aVI could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.
p209
aVWe don't tell you all the grubby details.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.
p212
aVThis is underneath Jeff's desk.
p213
aVThis is what the real world of computers,
p214
aVlamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.
p215
aVBut if you look in a catalog \u2014
p216
aVparticularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home \u2014
p217
aVit looks like this.
p218
aVThere are no cords.
p219
aVLook next time you get these catalogs in your mail \u2014
p220
aVyou can usually figure out where they hid the cord.
p221
aVBut there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,
p222
aVyou will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)
p223
aVAnd the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop
p224
aVor you buy this computer \u2014 and even in these wireless eras,
p225
aVyou don't get to live in the world without cords.
p226
aVYou have to have mystery and you have to have grace.
p227
aVAnd there she is \u2014 Grace.
p228
aVThis is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.
p229
aVPart of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,"
p230
aVthe question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?
p231
aVAnd the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.
p232
aa(lp233
VHere's Hedy Lamarr again.
p234
aVAnd, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous
p235
aVbecause, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.
p236
aVTranslucence is glamorous \u2014
p237
aVthat's why all these people wear pearls.
p238
aVIt's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent \u2014
p239
aVnot transparent, not opaque.
p240
aVIt invites us into the world
p241
aVbut it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.
p242
aVAnd I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,
p243
aVmaybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,
p244
aVbecause a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.
p245
aVIt has that sense of going up and away,
p246
aVand yet you never think about how you would really trip
p247
aVif you were \u2014 particularly going down.
p248
aVAnd of course glass block has that sense of translucence.
p249
aVSo, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure
p250
aVbut glamour's really partly about meaning.
p251
aVAll individuals and all cultures have ideals
p252
aVthat cannot possibly be realized in reality.
p253
aa(lp254
VThey have contradictions,
p255
aVthey uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other \u2014
p256
aVwhatever it is \u2014 and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose
p257
aVto our lives as cultures and as individuals.
p258
aVAnd the way we deal with that is we displace them \u2014
p259
aVwe put them into a golden world, an imagined world,
p260
aVan age of heroes, the world to come.
p261
aVAnd in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.
p262
aVThe white picket fence, the perfect house.
p263
aVThe perfect kitchen \u2014 no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.
p264
aVYou know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.
p265
aVThe perfect love life \u2014 symbolized by the perfect necklace,
p266
aVthe perfect diamond ring.
p267
aVThe perfect getaway in your perfect car.
p268
aVThis is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.
p269
aVThe perfect office \u2014
p270
aVagain, no cords, as far as I can tell.
p271
aVAnd certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.
p272
aVI mean, there's no paper on the desk.
p273
aVWe want this golden world.
p274
aVAnd some people get rich enough,
p275
aVand if they have their ideals \u2014 in a sort of domestic sense,
p276
aVthey get to acquire their perfect world.
p277
aa(lp278
VDean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is \u2014
p279
aVI don't think accidentally \u2014 in Art Deco style.
p280
aVThat symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.
p281
aVThis is not always good, because what is your perfect world?
p282
aVWhat is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?
p283
aVIs it something important?
p284
aV"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.
p285
aVI could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.
p286
aVIt was criticized for glamorizing violence,
p287
aVbecause, look \u2014 sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,
p288
aVthey could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things
p289
aVthat are impossible in the real world.
p290
aVThis is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.
p291
aVThis is from Soviet Union. Attractive.
p292
aVI mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.
p293
aVYou know, we're marching toward Utopia.
p294
aa(lp295
VI'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.
p296
aVBecause what they're doing is they're saying,
p297
aVyour coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.
p298
aVBut actually, what's even more important
p299
aVthan remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?
p300
aVBecause glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.
p301
aVAnd it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.
p302
aVThis is from "Triumph Of The Will" \u2014
p303
aVbrilliant editing to cut together things.
p304
aVThere's a glamour shot.
p305
aVNational Socialism is all about glamour.
p306
aVIt was a very aesthetic ideology.
p307
aVIt was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,
p308
aVand ridding it of anything unglamorous.
p309
aVSo glamour can be dangerous.
p310
aa(lp311
VI think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.
p312
aVI'm not against glamour.
p313
aVBut there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.
p314
aVAnd there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour
p315
aVand a way to broaden your appreciation of it.
p316
aVAnd that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice
p317
aVand confront the manipulation of it all,
p318
aVand sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,
p319
aVbut also enjoy how it happens.
p320
aVAnd here's Hedy Lamarr.
p321
aVShe's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.
p322
aVSo she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,
p323
aVeven though she thought she could look stupid.
p324
aa(lp325
VDavid Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this
p326
aVvery glamorous painting is heightened if you think about
p327
aVthe fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,
p328
aVwhich only took a fraction of a second to happen.
p329
aVThere is a book out in the bookstore \u2014
p330
aVit's called "Symphony In Steel,"
p331
aVand it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.
p332
aVAnd that has a fascination.
p333
aVIt's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.
p334
aVThere's a wonderful book called "Crowns"
p335
aVthat's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.
p336
aVAnd there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,
p337
aV"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.
p338
aVThey looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.
p339
aVBut I also knew how hard they worked all week.
p340
aVSometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."
p341
aVAnd, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour
p342
aVwhen you realize what went into creating it.
p343
aVThank you.

VI want to talk to you about,
p5
aVor share with you, a breakthrough new approach
p6
aVfor managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse.
p7
aVWe're talking about a pick, pack and ship setting here.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo as a hint,
p10
aVthis solution involves hundreds of mobile robots,
p11
aVsometimes thousands of mobile robots,
p12
aVmoving around a warehouse. And I'll get to the solution.
p13
aVBut for a moment, just think
p14
aVabout the last time that you ordered something online.
p15
aVYou were sitting on your couch
p16
aVand you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t-shirt.
p17
aVSo \u2014 click! \u2014 you put it into your shopping cart.
p18
aVAnd then you decided that green pair of pants
p19
aVlooks pretty good too \u2014 click!
p20
aVAnd maybe a blue pair of shoes \u2014 click!
p21
aVSo at this point you've assembled your order.
p22
aVYou didn't stop to think  for a moment that
p23
aVthat might not be a great outfit.
p24
aVBut you hit "submit order."
p25
aVAnd two days later, this package shows up on your doorstep.
p26
aVAnd you open the box and you're like, wow, there's my goo.
p27
aa(lp28
VDid you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory
p29
aVactually found their way inside that box in the warehouse?
p30
aVSo I'm here to tell you  it's that guy right there.
p31
aVSo deep in the middle of that picture,
p32
aVyou see a classic pick-pack worker
p33
aVin a distribution or order fulfillments setting.
p34
aVClassically these pick workers will  spend 60 or 70 percent of their day
p35
aVwandering around the warehouse.
p36
aVThey'll often walk as much as 5 or 10 miles
p37
aVin pursuit of those items of inventory.
p38
aVNot only is this an unproductive way to fill orders,
p39
aVit also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem.
p42
aVI was out in the Bay area  in '99, 2000, the dot com boom.
p43
aVI worked for a fabulously spectacular flame-out called Webvan.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVThis company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that
p46
aVwe will deliver grocery orders online.
p47
aVAnd it really came down to the fact that we couldn't do it cost effectively.
p48
aVTurns out e-commerce was something that was very hard and very costly.
p49
aVIn this particular instance we were trying to assemble 30 items of inventory
p50
aVinto a few totes, onto a van to deliver to the home.
p51
aVAnd when you think about it, it was costing us 30 dollars.
p52
aVImagine, we had an 89¢ can of soup
p53
aVthat was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote.
p54
aVAnd that's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo long story short, during my one year at Webvan,
p57
aVwhat I realized by talking to  all the material-handling providers
p58
aVwas that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking.
p59
aVRed item, green, blue, getting those three things in a box.
p60
aVSo we said, there's just got to be a better way to do this.
p61
aVExisting material handling was set up to pump
p62
aVpallets and cases of goo to retail stores.
p63
aa(lp64
VOf course Webvan went out of business, and about a year and a half later,
p65
aVI was still noodling on this problem. It was still nagging at me.
p66
aVAnd I started thinking about it again.
p67
aVAnd I said, let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker,
p68
aVor my vision for how it should work.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVI said, let's focus on the problem.
p71
aVI have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put
p72
aVred, green and blue in this box right here.
p73
aVWhat I need is a system where I put out my hand and \u2014 poof! \u2014
p74
aVthe product shows up  and I pack it into the order,
p75
aVand now we're thinking,
p76
aVthis would be a very operator-centric approach to solving the problem.
p77
aVThis is what I need. What technology is available to solve this problem?
p78
aVBut as you can see, orders can come and go, products can come and go.
p79
aVIt allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem,
p80
aVand providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo how did I arrive at this notion?
p83
aVWell, actually it came from a brainstorming exercise,
p84
aVprobably a technique that many of you use,
p85
aVIt's this notion of testing your ideas.
p86
aVTake a blank sheet, of course,
p87
aVbut then test your ideas at the limits \u2014 infinity, zero.
p88
aVIn this particular case, we challenged ourselves with the idea:
p89
aVWhat if we had to build a distribution center in China,
p90
aVwhere it's a very, very low-cost market?
p91
aVAnd say, labor is cheap, land is cheap.
p92
aVAnd we said specifically,
p93
aV"What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor
p94
aVand we could build a million- square-foot distribution center?"
p95
aVSo naturally that led to ideas that said,
p96
aV"Let's put lots of people in the warehouse."
p97
aVAnd I said, "Hold on, zero dollars per hour,
p98
aVwhat I would do is 'hire'
p99
aV10,000 workers to come to the warehouse every morning at 8 a.m.,
p100
aVwalk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory
p101
aVand then just stand there.
p102
aVSo you hold Captain Crunch, you hold the Mountain Dew,
p103
aVyou hold the Diet Coke.
p104
aVIf I need it, I'll call you, otherwise just stand there.
p105
aVBut when I need Diet Coke and I call it, you guys talk amongst yourselves.
p106
aVDiet Coke walks up to the front \u2014 pick it, put it in the tote, away it goes."
p107
aVWow, what if the products could walk and talk on their own?
p108
aVThat's a very interesting, very powerful way
p109
aVthat we could potentially organize this warehouse.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo of course, labor isn't free,
p112
aVon that practical versus awesome spectrum.
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVSo we said mobile shelving \u2014 We'll put them on mobile shelving.
p115
aVWe'll use mobile robots and we'll move the inventory around.
p116
aVAnd so we got underway on that and then I'm sitting on my couch in 2008.
p117
aVDid any of you see the Beijing Olympics, the opening ceremonies?
p118
aVI about fell out of my couch when I saw this.
p119
aVI'm like, that was the idea!
p120
aV(Laughter and Applause)
p121
aVWe'll put thousands of people on the warehouse floor, the stadium floor.
p122
aVBut interestingly enough, this actually relates to the idea
p123
aVin that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful, impressive digital art,
p124
aVall without computers, I'm told,
p125
aVit was all peer-to-peer coordination and communication.
p126
aVYou stand up, I'll squat down.
p127
aVAnd they made some fabulous art.
p128
aVIt speaks to the power of emergence
p129
aVin systems when you let things start to talk with each other.
p130
aVSo that was a little bit of the journey.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo of course, now what became the practical reality of this idea?
p133
aVHere is a warehouse.
p134
aVIt's a pick, pack and ship center that has about 10,000 different SKUs.
p135
aVWe'll call them red pens, green pens, yellow Post-It Notes.
p136
aVWe send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods.
p137
aVAnd we deliver them to the side of the building.
p138
aVSo all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter.
p139
aVAnd the game here is to pick up the shelves,
p140
aVtake them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker.
p141
aVThis pick worker's life is completely different.
p142
aVRather than wandering around the warehouse, she gets to stay still
p143
aVin a pick station like this
p144
aVand every product in the building can now come to her.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo the process is very productive.
p147
aVReach in, pick an item, scan the bar code, pack it out.
p148
aVBy the time you turn around,
p149
aVthere's another product there ready to be picked and packed.
p150
aVSo what we've done is take out all of the non-value added
p151
aVwalking, searching, wasting, waited time,
p152
aVand we've developed a very  high-fidelity way to pick these orders,
p153
aVwhere you point at it with a laser, scan the UPC barcode,
p154
aVand then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into.
p155
aVSo more productive, more accurate and, it turns out,
p156
aVit's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers.
p157
aVThey actually complete the whole order.
p158
aVSo they do red, green and blue, not just a part of the order.
p159
aVAnd they feel a little bit more in control of their environment.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo the side effects of this approach
p162
aVare what really surprised us.
p163
aVWe knew it was going  to be more productive.
p164
aVBut we didn't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking
p165
aVextended to other functions in the warehouse.
p166
aVBut what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC
p167
aVis turning it into a massively parallel processing engine.
p168
aVSo this is again a cross-fertilization of ideas.
p169
aVHere's a warehouse and we're thinking about
p170
aVparallel processing supercomputer architectures.
p171
aVThe notion here is that you have
p172
aV10 workers on  the right side of the screen
p173
aVthat are now all independent autonomous pick workers.
p174
aVIf the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom,
p175
aVit has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers.
p176
aVContrast that, for a moment, with the traditional method of using a conveyor.
p177
aVWhen one person passes the order to you,
p178
aVyou put something in and pass it downstream.
p179
aVEveryone has to be in place for that serial process to work.
p180
aVThis becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we're tracking
p183
aVthe popularity of the products.
p184
aVAnd we're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms
p185
aVto tune the floor of the warehouse.
p186
aVSo what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine's Day.
p187
aVAll that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building
p188
aVand is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations.
p189
aVCome in two days after Valentine's Day, and that candy, the leftover candy,
p190
aVhas all drifted to the back of the warehouse
p191
aVand is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there.
p192
aVOne other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing
p193
aVis these things can scale to ginormous.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVSo whether you're doing two pick stations, 20 pick stations,
p196
aVor 200 pick stations, the path planning algorithms
p197
aVand all of the inventory algorithms just work.
p198
aVIn this example you see that the inventory
p199
aVhas now occupied all the perimeter of the building
p200
aVbecause that's where the pick stations were.
p201
aVThey sorted it out for themselves.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo I'll conclude with just one final video
p204
aVthat shows how this comes to bear
p205
aVon the pick worker's actual day in the life of.
p206
aVSo as we mentioned, the process is to move inventory along the highway
p207
aVand then find your way into these pick stations.
p208
aVAnd our software in the background
p209
aVunderstands what's going on  in each station,
p210
aVwe direct the pods across the highway
p211
aVand we're attempting to get into a queuing system
p212
aVto present the work to the pick worker.
p213
aVWhat's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers.
p214
aVThe faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few.
p215
aVBut this pick worker now is literally having that experience
p216
aVthat we described before.
p217
aVShe puts out her hand. The product jumps into it.
p218
aVOr she has to reach in and get it.
p219
aVShe scans it and  she puts it in the bucket.
p220
aVAnd all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes.
p221
aVSo she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job.
p222
aVNever has any idle time, never has to leave her mat.
p223
aVAnd actually we think not only a more productive
p224
aVand more accurate way to fill orders.
p225
aVWe think it's a more fulfilling way to fill orders.
p226
aa(lp227
VThe reason we can say that, though, is that workers
p228
aVin a lot of these buildings now compete
p229
aVfor the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day.
p230
aVAnd sometimes we'll catch them on testimonial videos
p231
aVsaying such things as,
p232
aVthey have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren,
p233
aVor in one case a guy said, "the Kiva zone is so stress-free
p234
aVthat I've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication."
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVThat was at a pharmaceutical distributor, so they told us not to use that video.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VSo what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that
p240
aVwhen you let things start to think and walk
p241
aVand talk on their own, interesting processes and productivities can emerge.
p242
aVAnd now I think next time you go to your front step
p243
aVand pick up that box that you just ordered online,
p244
aVyou break it open and the goo is in there,
p245
aVyou'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot
p246
aVassisted in the picking and packing of that order.
p247
aa(lp248
VThank you.
p249
aV(Applause)

VI want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is,
p5
aVwhat it could be,
p6
aVand what your relationship to it is.
p7
aVAnd in doing that, I want to offer you a vision,
p8
aVan imagined future, if you will,
p9
aVof how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it,
p10
aV"Once in a lifetime
p11
aVthe longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up,
p12
aVand hope and history rhyme."
p13
aa(lp14
VI want to start with these word pairs here.
p15
aVWe all know which side of these we'd like to be on.
p16
aVWhen philanthropy was reinvented a century ago,
p17
aVwhen the foundation form was actually invented,
p18
aVthey didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.
p19
aVIn fact they would never have thought of themselves
p20
aVas closed and set in their ways,
p21
aVas slow to respond to new challenges,
p22
aVas small and risk-averse.
p23
aVAnd in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times,
p24
aVwhat Rockefeller called "the business of benevolence."
p25
aVBut by the end of the 20th century,
p26
aVa new generation of critics and reformers
p27
aVhad come to see philanthropy just this way.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe thing to watch for
p30
aVas a global philanthropy industry comes about \u2014
p31
aVand that's exactly what is happening \u2014
p32
aVis how the aspiration is to flip
p33
aVthese old assumptions,
p34
aVfor philanthropy to become open and big
p35
aVand fast and connected, in service of the long term.
p36
aVThis entrepreneurial energy
p37
aVis emerging from many quarters.
p38
aVAnd it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here,
p39
aVby new tools, like the ones we've seen here,
p40
aVand by new pressures.
p41
aa(lp42
VI've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.
p43
aVThis report is our main public report.
p44
aVWhat it tells is the story of how today
p45
aVactually could be as historic
p46
aVas 100 years ago.
p47
aVWhat I want to do is share some of the coolest things
p48
aVthat are going on with you.
p49
aVAnd as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much
p50
aVon the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about \u2014
p51
aVthe Gates or the Soros or the Google.
p52
aVInstead, what I want to do
p53
aVis talk about the philanthropy of all of us:
p54
aVthe democratization of philanthropy.
p55
aVThis is a moment in history when the average person
p56
aVhas more power than at any time.
p57
aa(lp58
VWhat I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments,
p59
aVeach of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.
p60
aVThe first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.
p61
aVNow, this may surprise you.
p62
aVBut remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.
p63
aVClay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked,
p64
aVhas captured the assumption that this challenges
p65
aVin such a beautiful way.
p66
aVHe said, "We have lived in this world
p67
aVwhere little things are done for love
p68
aVand big things for money.
p69
aVNow we have Wikipedia.
p70
aVSuddenly big things can be done for love."
p71
aa(lp72
VWatch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book \u2014
p73
aVAuthor and entrepreneur many of you may know about.
p74
aVThe book is called "Blessed Unrest."
p75
aVAnd when it comes out, a series of wiki sites
p76
aVunder the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.
p77
aVWISER stands for World Index
p78
aVfor Social and Environmental Responsibility.
p79
aVWISER sets out to document, link and empower
p80
aVwhat Paul calls the largest movement,
p81
aVand fastest-growing movement in human history:
p82
aVhumanity's collective immune response
p83
aVto today's threats.
p84
aVNow, all of these big things for love \u2014 experiments \u2014
p85
aVaren't going to take off.
p86
aVBut the ones that do
p87
aVare going to be the biggest, the most open,
p88
aVthe fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.
p89
aa(lp90
VSecond category is online philanthropy marketplaces.
p91
aVThis is, of course, to philanthropy
p92
aVwhat eBay and Amazon are to commerce.
p93
aVThink of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
p94
aVAnd this challenges yet another assumption,
p95
aVwhich is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.
p96
aVTake a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.
p97
aVOmidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose.
p98
aVIt's one of the best known of these new marketplaces
p99
aVwhere a donor can go straight into a classroom
p100
aVand connect with what a teacher says they need.
p101
aVTake a look at Changing the Present,
p102
aVstarted by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.
p103
aVGiveIndia is for a whole country.
p104
aVAnd it goes on and on.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe third category is represented by Warren Buffet,
p107
aVwhich I call aggregated giving.
p108
aVIt's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous
p109
aVin that historic act last summer.
p110
aVIt's that he challenged another assumption,
p111
aVthat every giver should have his or her own
p112
aVfund or foundation.
p113
aVThere are now, today, so many new funds
p114
aVthat are aggregating giving and investing,
p115
aVbringing together people
p116
aVaround a common goal, to think bigger.
p117
aVOne of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz,
p118
aVa TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.
p119
aVBut there are many others: New Profit in Cambridge,
p120
aVNew School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley,
p121
aVVenture Philanthropy Partners in Washington,
p122
aVGlobal Fund for Women in San Francisco.
p123
aVTake a look at these.
p124
aVThese funds are to philanthropy
p125
aVwhat venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds
p126
aVare to investing,
p127
aVbut with a twist \u2014
p128
aVbecause often a community forms around these funds,
p129
aVas it has at Acumen and other places.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, imagine for a second
p132
aVthese first three types of experiments:
p133
aVmass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.
p134
aVAnd understand how they help us re-perceive
p135
aVwhat organized philanthropy is.
p136
aVIt's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.
p137
aVAnd imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future,
p138
aVwhen these things come together in the experiments of the future \u2014
p139
aVimagine that somebody puts up, say,
p140
aV100 million dollars
p141
aVfor an inspiring goal \u2014
p142
aVthere were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year,
p143
aVnot out of the question \u2014
p144
aVbut only puts it up if it's matched
p145
aVby millions of small gifts from around the globe,
p146
aVthereby engaging lots of people,
p147
aVand building visibility and engaging people
p148
aVin the goal that's stated.
p149
aa(lp150
VI'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories,
p151
aVwhich are innovation, competitions and social investing.
p152
aVThey're betting a visible competition, a prize,
p153
aVcan attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues,
p154
aVand thereby speed the solution.
p155
aVThis tackles yet another assumption,
p156
aVthat the giver and the organization is at the center,
p157
aVas opposed to putting the problem at the center.
p158
aVYou can look to these innovators
p159
aVto help us especially with things that require
p160
aVtechnological or scientific solution.
p161
aa(lp162
VThat leaves the final category, social investing,
p163
aVwhich is really, anyway, the biggest of them all,
p164
aVrepresented here by Xigi.net.
p165
aVAnd this, of course, tackles the biggest assumption of all,
p166
aVthat business is business,
p167
aVand philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world.
p168
aVXigi is a new community site
p169
aVthat's built by the community,
p170
aVlinking and mapping this new social capital market.
p171
aVIt lists already 1,000 entities
p172
aVthat are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.
p173
aVSo we can look to these innovators
p174
aVto help us remember
p175
aVthat if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital
p176
aVthat seeks a return,
p177
aVthe good that can be driven could be astonishing.
p178
aa(lp179
VNow, what's really interesting here
p180
aVis that we're not thinking our way
p181
aVinto a new way of acting;
p182
aVwe're acting our way into a new way of thinking.
p183
aVPhilanthropy is reorganizing itself
p184
aVbefore our very eyes.
p185
aVAnd even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers
p186
aVdon't yet fulfill this aspiration,
p187
aVI think this is the new zeitgeist:
p188
aVopen, big, fast, connected,
p189
aVand, let us also hope, long.
p190
aVWe have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.
p191
aVIf we don't develop the stamina to stick with things \u2014
p192
aVwhatever it is you pick, stick with it \u2014
p193
aVall of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut I'm really hopeful.
p196
aVAnd I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy
p197
aVthat's reorganizing itself,
p198
aVit's also whole other portions of the social sector,
p199
aVand of business,
p200
aVthat are busy challenging "business as usual."
p201
aVAnd everywhere I go, including here at TED,
p202
aVI feel that there is a new moral hunger
p203
aVthat is growing.
p204
aVWhat we're seeing is people really wrestling
p205
aVto describe what is this new thing that's happening.
p206
aVWords like "philanthrocapitalism,"
p207
aVand "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur,"
p208
aVand "venture philanthropy."
p209
aVWe don't have a language for it yet.
p210
aVWhatever we call it,
p211
aVit's new, it's beginning,
p212
aVand I think it's gong to quite significant.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd that's where my imagined future comes in,
p215
aVwhich I am going to call the social singularity.
p216
aVMany of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer
p217
aVVernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity,
p218
aVwhere a number of trends accelerate and converge
p219
aVand come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.
p220
aVIt may be that the social singularity
p221
aVahead is the one that we fear the most:
p222
aVa convergence of catastrophes,
p223
aVof environmental degradation,
p224
aVof weapons of mass destruction, of pandemics,
p225
aVof poverty.
p226
aVThat's because
p227
aVour ability to confront the problems that we face
p228
aVhas not kept pace with our ability to create them.
p229
aVAnd as we've heard here,
p230
aVit is no exaggeration to say
p231
aVthat we hold the future of our civilization in our hands
p232
aVas never before.
p233
aa(lp234
VThe question is, is there a positive social singularity?
p235
aVIs there a frontier for us
p236
aVof how we live together?
p237
aVOur future doesn't have to be imagined.
p238
aVWe can create a future where hope and history rhyme.
p239
aVBut we have a problem.
p240
aVOur experience to date, both individually and collectively,
p241
aVhasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do,
p242
aVor who we're going to need to be.
p243
aVWe are going to need
p244
aVa new generation of citizen leaders
p245
aVwilling to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning
p246
aVas rapidly as possible.
p247
aVThat's why I have one last thing I want to show you.
p248
aa(lp249
VThis is a photograph taken about 100 years ago
p250
aVof my grandfather and great-grandfather.
p251
aVThis is a newspaper publisher and a banker.
p252
aVAnd they were great community leaders.
p253
aVAnd, yes, they were great philanthropists.
p254
aVI keep this photograph close by to me \u2014
p255
aVit's in my office \u2014
p256
aVbecause I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men,
p257
aVboth of whom I never knew.
p258
aVAnd so, in their honor,
p259
aVI want to offer you this blank slide.
p260
aVAnd I want you to imagine
p261
aVthat this a photograph of you.
p262
aVAnd I want you to think about the community
p263
aVthat you want to be part of creating.
p264
aVWhatever that means to you.
p265
aVAnd I want you to imagine
p266
aVthat it's 100 years from now,
p267
aVand your grandchild, or great-grandchild,
p268
aVor niece or nephew or god-child,
p269
aVis looking at this photograph of you.
p270
aVWhat is the story you most want for them to tell?
p271
aVThank you very much.
p272
aV(Applause)

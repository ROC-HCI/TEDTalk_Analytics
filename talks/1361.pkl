VThe humanitarian model has barely changed
p5
aVsince the early 20th century.
p6
aVIts origins are firmly rooted
p7
aVin the analog age.
p8
aVAnd there is a major shift coming on the horizon.
p9
aVThe catalyst for this change
p10
aVwas the major earthquake that struck Haiti
p11
aVon the 12th of January in 2010.
p12
aVHaiti was a game changer.
p13
aVThe earthquake destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince,
p14
aVclaiming the lives of some 320,000 people,
p15
aVrendering homeless
p16
aVabout 1.2 million people.
p17
aVGovernment institutions were completely decapitated,
p18
aVincluding the presidential palace.
p19
aVI remember standing
p20
aVon the roof of the Ministry of Justice
p21
aVin downtown Port-au-Prince.
p22
aVIt was about two meters high,
p23
aVcompletely squashed
p24
aVby the violence of the earthquake.
p25
aa(lp26
VFor those of us on the ground in those early days,
p27
aVit was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans
p28
aVthat Haiti was something different.
p29
aVHaiti was something we hadn't seen before.
p30
aVBut Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented.
p31
aVHaiti allowed us to glimpse into a future
p32
aVof what disaster response might look like
p33
aVin a hyper-connected world
p34
aVwhere people have access
p35
aVto mobile smart devices.
p36
aa(lp37
VBecause out of the urban devastation
p38
aVin Port-au-Prince
p39
aVcame a torrent of SMS texts \u2014
p40
aVpeople crying for help,
p41
aVbeseeching us for assistance,
p42
aVsharing data, offering support,
p43
aVlooking for their loved ones.
p44
aVThis was a situation
p45
aVthat traditional aid agencies had never before encountered.
p46
aVWe were in one of the poorest countries on the planet,
p47
aVbut 80 percent of the people
p48
aVhad mobile devices in their hands.
p49
aVAnd we were unprepared for this,
p50
aVand they were shaping the aid effort.
p51
aa(lp52
VOutside Haiti also, things were looking different.
p53
aVTens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers
p54
aVwere scouring the Internet,
p55
aVconverting tweets
p56
aVthat had already been converted from texts
p57
aVand putting these into open-source maps,
p58
aVlayering them with all sorts of important information \u2014
p59
aVpeople like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map \u2014
p60
aVand putting these on the Web for everybody \u2014
p61
aVthe media, the aid organizations and the communities themselves \u2014
p62
aVto participate in and to use.
p63
aa(lp64
VBack in Haiti,
p65
aVpeople were increasingly turning
p66
aVto the medium of SMS.
p67
aVPeople that were hungry and hurting
p68
aVwere signaling their distress,
p69
aVwere signaling their need for help.
p70
aVOn street sides all over Port-au-Prince,
p71
aVentrepreneurs sprung up
p72
aVoffering mobile phone charging stations.
p73
aVThey understood more than we did
p74
aVpeople's innate need
p75
aVto be connected.
p76
aa(lp77
VNever having been confronted
p78
aVwith this type of situation before,
p79
aVwe wanted to try and understand
p80
aVhow we could tap into this incredible resource,
p81
aVhow we could really leverage
p82
aVthis incredible use of mobile technology
p83
aVand SMS technology.
p84
aVWe started talking with a local telecom provider called Voilà,
p85
aVwhich is a subsidiary of Trilogy International.
p86
aVWe had basically three requirements.
p87
aVWe wanted to communicate
p88
aVin a two-way form of communication.
p89
aVWe didn't want to shout; we needed to listen as well.
p90
aVWe wanted to be able to target
p91
aVspecific geographic communities.
p92
aVWe didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time.
p93
aVAnd we wanted it to be easy to use.
p94
aa(lp95
VOut of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation
p96
aVcame something that we call TERA \u2014
p97
aVthe Trilogy Emergency Response Application \u2014
p98
aVwhich has been used to support the aid effort
p99
aVever since.
p100
aVIt has been used to help communities prepare for disasters.
p101
aVIt has been used to signal early warning
p102
aVin advance of weather-related disasters.
p103
aVIt's used for public health awareness campaigns
p104
aVsuch as the prevention of cholera.
p105
aVAnd it is even used for sensitive issues
p106
aVsuch as building awareness
p107
aVaround gender-based violence.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut does it work?
p110
aVWe have just published
p111
aVan evaluation of this program,
p112
aVand the evidence that is there for all to see
p113
aVis quite remarkable.
p114
aVSome 74 percent of people
p115
aVreceived the data.
p116
aVThose who were intended to receive the data,
p117
aV74 percent of them received it.
p118
aV96 percent of them
p119
aVfound it useful.
p120
aV83 percent of them took action \u2014
p121
aVevidence that it is indeed empowering.
p122
aVAnd 73 percent of them shared it.
p123
aa(lp124
VThe TERA system
p125
aVwas developed from Haiti
p126
aVwith support of engineers in the region.
p127
aVIt is a user-appropriate technology
p128
aVthat has been used for humanitarian good to great effect.
p129
aVTechnology is transformational.
p130
aVRight across the developing world,
p131
aVcitizens and communities
p132
aVare using technology
p133
aVto enable them to bring about change, positive change,
p134
aVin their own communities.
p135
aVThe grassroots has been strengthened
p136
aVthrough the social power of sharing
p137
aVand they are challenging the old models,
p138
aVthe old analog models
p139
aVof control and command.
p140
aa(lp141
VOne illustration of the transformational power of technology
p142
aVis in Kibera.
p143
aVKibera is one of Africa's largest slums.
p144
aVIt's on the outskirts of Nairobi,
p145
aVthe capital city of Kenya.
p146
aVIt's home to an unknown number of people \u2014
p147
aVsome say between 250,000
p148
aVand 1.2 million.
p149
aVIf you were to arrive in Nairobi today
p150
aVand pick up a tourist map,
p151
aVKibera is represented
p152
aVas a lush, green national park
p153
aVdevoid of human settlement.
p154
aa(lp155
VYoung people living in Kibera
p156
aVin their community,
p157
aVwith simple handheld devices,
p158
aVGPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones,
p159
aVhave literally put themselves on the map.
p160
aVThey have collated crowd-sourced data
p161
aVand rendered the invisible visible.
p162
aVPeople like Josh and Steve
p163
aVare continuing to layer information upon information,
p164
aVreal-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps
p165
aVfor all to use.
p166
aVYou can find out about the latest impromptu music session.
p167
aVYou can find out about the latest security incident.
p168
aVYou can find out about places of worship.
p169
aVYou can find out about the health centers.
p170
aVYou can feel the dynamism
p171
aVof this living, breathing community.
p172
aVThey also have their own news network on YouTube
p173
aVwith 36,000 viewers at the moment.
p174
aa(lp175
VThey're showing us what can be done
p176
aVwith mobile, digital technologies.
p177
aVThey're showing that the magic of technology
p178
aVcan bring the invisible visible.
p179
aVAnd they are giving a voice to themselves.
p180
aVThey are telling their own story,
p181
aVbypassing the official narrative.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories.
p184
aVIn Mongolia for instance,
p185
aVwhere 30 percent of the people are nomadic,
p186
aVSMS information systems are being used
p187
aVto track migration and weather patterns.
p188
aVSMS is even used
p189
aVto hold herder summits
p190
aVfrom remote participation.
p191
aVAnd if people are migrating
p192
aVinto urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments,
p193
aVthey can also be helped in anticipation
p194
aVwith social supporters ready and waiting for them
p195
aVbased on SMS knowledge.
p196
aVIn Nigeria,
p197
aVopen-source SMS tools
p198
aVare being used by the Red Cross community workers
p199
aVto gather information from the local community
p200
aVin an attempt to better understand and mitigate
p201
aVthe prevalence of malaria.
p202
aVMy colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program,
p203
aVtells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper
p204
aVthan the traditional way of doing things.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd not only is it empowering to the communities,
p207
aVbut really importantly,
p208
aVthis information stays in the community
p209
aVwhere it is needed to formulate long-term health polices.
p210
aVWe are on a planet
p211
aVof seven billion people,
p212
aVfive billion mobile subscriptions.
p213
aVBy 2015,
p214
aVthere will be three billion smartphones in the world.
p215
aVThe U.N. broadband commission
p216
aVhas recently set targets
p217
aVto help broadband access
p218
aVin 50 percent of the Developing World,
p219
aVcompared to 20 percent today.
p220
aVWe are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world
p221
aVwhere citizens from all cultures and all social strata
p222
aVwill have access to smart, fast mobile devices.
p223
aa(lp224
VPeople are understanding,
p225
aVfrom Cairo to Oakland,
p226
aVthat there are new ways to come together,
p227
aVthere are new ways to mobilize,
p228
aVthere are new ways to influence.
p229
aVA transformation is coming which needs to be understood
p230
aVby the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models.
p231
aVThe collective voices of people
p232
aVneeds to be more integrated through new technologies
p233
aVinto the organizational strategies and plans of actions
p234
aVand not just recycled
p235
aVfor fundraising or marketing.
p236
aVWe need to, for example, embrace
p237
aVthe big data,
p238
aVthe knowledge that is there from market leaders
p239
aVwho understand what it means
p240
aVto use and leverage big data.
p241
aa(lp242
VOne idea that I'd like you to consider, for instance,
p243
aVis to take a look at our IT departments.
p244
aVThey're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers,
p245
aVbut they need to be elevated to software strategists.
p246
aVWe need people in our organizations
p247
aVwho know what it's like to work with big data.
p248
aVWe need technology
p249
aVas a core organizational principle.
p250
aVWe need technological strategists in the boardroom
p251
aVwho can ask and answer the question,
p252
aV"What would Amazon or Google
p253
aVdo with all of this data?"
p254
aVand convert it to humanitarian good.
p255
aa(lp256
VThe possibilities
p257
aVthat new digital technologies are bringing
p258
aVcan help humanitarian organizations,
p259
aVnot only ensure
p260
aVthat people's right to information is met,
p261
aVor that they have their right to communicate,
p262
aVbut I think in the future,
p263
aVhumanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate
p264
aVthe right for people to access
p265
aVcritical communication technologies
p266
aVin order to ensure
p267
aVthat their voices are heard,
p268
aVthat they're truly participating,
p269
aVthat they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world.
p270
aVIt has always been the elusive ideal
p271
aVto ensure full participation of people affected by disasters
p272
aVin the humanitarian effort.
p273
aVWe now have the tools. We now have the possibilities.
p274
aVThere are no more reasons not to do it.
p275
aVI believe we need to bring the humanitarian world
p276
aVfrom analog to digital.
p277
aa(lp278
VThank you very much.

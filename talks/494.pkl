VI've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,
p5
aVand so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with
p6
aVis how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?
p7
aVSo often, we look at dollar terms \u2014
p8
aVpeople making less than a dollar or two or three a day.
p9
aVAnd yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at
p10
aVincome as only one variable.
p11
aVBecause really, it's a condition about choice,
p12
aVand the lack of freedom.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me
p15
aVthe understanding that I have.
p16
aVIt was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.
p17
aVI was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer,
p18
aVin the Mathare Valley slums.
p19
aVNow, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.
p20
aVIt's about three miles out of Nairobi,
p21
aVand it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide,
p22
aVwhere over half a million people
p23
aVlive crammed in these little tin shacks,
p24
aVgeneration after generation, renting them,
p25
aVoften eight or 10 people to a room.
p26
aVAnd it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs:
p27
aVa hard place to grow up.
p28
aVAnd when we were walking through the narrow alleys,
p29
aVit was literally impossible not to step in the
p30
aVraw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.
p31
aVBut at the same time it was also
p32
aVimpossible not to see the human vitality,
p33
aVthe aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there:
p34
aVwomen washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.
p35
aVI met this woman, Mama Rose,
p36
aVwho has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,
p37
aVwhere she lives with her seven children.
p38
aVFour sleep in one twin bed,
p39
aVand three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.
p40
aVAnd she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,
p41
aVand from selling soap and bread from the little store inside.
p42
aa(lp43
VIt was also the day after the inauguration,
p44
aVand I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.
p45
aVAnd I would see kids on the street corners,
p46
aVand they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!"
p47
aVAnd I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."
p48
aVAnd they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd it was here that I met Jane.
p51
aVI was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,
p52
aVand I asked her to tell me her story.
p53
aVShe started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.
p54
aVMy first dream was to be a doctor,
p55
aVand the second was to marry a good man
p56
aVwho would stay with me and my family,
p57
aVbecause my mother was a single mom,
p58
aVand couldn't afford to pay for school fees.
p59
aVSo I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."
p60
aVShe got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.
p61
aVAnd when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,
p62
aVher mom died and her husband left her \u2014 married another woman.
p63
aVSo she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.
p64
aVAnd so she ultimately turned to prostitution.
p65
aVIt wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.
p66
aVShe would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,
p67
aVlook for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings,
p68
aVor sometimes with nothing.
p69
aVAnd she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation
p70
aVand the embarrassment of it all."
p71
aa(lp72
VIn 2001, her life changed.
p73
aVShe had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora,
p74
aVthat would lend money to people no matter how poor you were,
p75
aVas long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.
p76
aVAnd so she spent a year to save 50 dollars,
p77
aVand started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.
p78
aVShe started tailoring.
p79
aVAnd that turned into what she does now,
p80
aVwhich is to go into the secondhand clothing markets,
p81
aVand for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.
p82
aVSome of them might be ones you gave.
p83
aVAnd she repurposes them with frills and ribbons,
p84
aVand makes these frothy confections that she sells to women
p85
aVfor their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion \u2014
p86
aVthose milestones in a life that people want to celebrate
p87
aVall along the economic spectrum.
p88
aVAnd she does really good business. In fact, I watched her
p89
aVwalk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it,
p90
aVthere was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses,
p93
aVand also the jewelry that she makes,
p94
aVthat now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.
p95
aVAnd by many definitions she is no longer poor.
p96
aVBut she still lives in Mathare Valley.
p97
aVAnd so she can't move out.
p98
aVShe lives with all of that insecurity,
p99
aVand in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots,
p100
aVshe was chased from her home and had to find a new shack
p101
aVin which she would live.
p102
aa(lp103
VJamii Bora understands that and understands
p104
aVthat when we're talking about poverty,
p105
aVwe've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.
p106
aVAnd so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations,
p107
aVloans and investments that will go the long term with them,
p108
aVthey built a low-cost housing development,
p109
aVabout an hour outside Nairobi central.
p110
aVAnd they designed it from the perspective of
p111
aVcustomers like Jane herself,
p112
aVinsisting on responsibility and accountability.
p113
aVSo she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage \u2014
p114
aVof the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.
p115
aVAnd then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.
p116
aVAnd in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be
p117
aVamong the first 200 families to move into this development.
p118
aa(lp119
VWhen I asked her if she feared anything,
p120
aVor whether she would miss anything from Mathare,
p121
aVshe said, "What would I fear
p122
aVthat I haven't confronted already?
p123
aVI'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."
p124
aVAnd she said, "What would I miss?
p125
aVYou think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?
p126
aVDo you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home
p127
aVat the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes
p128
aVmy bags would be packed."
p129
aVI said, "Well what about your dreams?"
p130
aVAnd she said, "Well, you know,
p131
aVmy dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.
p132
aVBut if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband,
p133
aVbut what I really wanted was a family
p134
aVthat was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back."
p135
aVShe said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor,
p136
aVbut what I really wanted to be was somebody
p137
aVwho served and healed and cured.
p138
aVAnd so I feel so blessed with everything that I have,
p139
aVthat two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.
p140
aVAnd I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.
p141
aVYou are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'"
p142
aVAnd she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.
p143
aVBut maybe me, I give out something better
p144
aVbecause I give them hope."
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd in the middle of this economic crisis,
p147
aVwhere so many of us are inclined to pull in
p148
aVwith fear, I think we're well suited to
p149
aVtake a cue from Jane and reach out,
p150
aVrecognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.
p151
aVBecause when systems are broken,
p152
aVlike the ones that we're seeing around the world,
p153
aVit's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.
p154
aVIt's an opportunity to truly build a world
p155
aVwhere we can extend services and products
p156
aVto all human beings, so that they can
p157
aVmake decisions and choices for themselves.
p158
aVI truly believe it's where dignity starts.
p159
aVWe owe it to the Janes of the world.
p160
aVAnd just as important, we owe it to ourselves.
p161
aa(lp162
VThank you.

So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>", "slug": "jacqueline_novogratz", "whotheyare": "Jacqueline Novogratz works to enable human flourishing.

in the world. </p><p>&quot;I started my career on Wall Street and soon discovered that markets are efficient, but by themselves they too often overlook or exploit the poor.  So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>", "slug": "jacqueline_novogratz", "whotheyare": "Jacqueline Novogratz works to enable human flourishing.

VGeorge and Charlotte Blonsky, who were
p5
aVa married couple living in the Bronx in New York City,
p6
aVinvented something.
p7
aVThey got a patent in 1965 for what they call,
p8
aV"a device to assist women in giving birth."
p9
aVThis device consists of a large, round table
p10
aVand some machinery.
p11
aVWhen the woman is ready to deliver her child,
p12
aVshe lies on her back,
p13
aVshe is strapped down to the table,
p14
aVand the table is rotated at high speed.
p15
aVThe child comes flying out
p16
aVthrough centrifugal force.
p17
aVIf you look at their patent carefully,
p18
aVespecially if you have any engineering background or talent,
p19
aVyou may decide that you see
p20
aVone or two points where the design is  not perfectly adequate. (Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VDoctor Ivan Schwab in California
p23
aVis one of the people,  one of the main people,
p24
aVwho helped answer the question,
p25
aV"Why don't woodpeckers get headaches?"
p26
aVAnd it turns out the answer to that
p27
aVis because their brains
p28
aVare packaged inside their skulls
p29
aVin a way different from the way
p30
aVour brains, we being human beings,
p31
aVtrue, have our brains packaged.
p32
aVThey, the woodpeckers, typically
p33
aVwill peck, they will bang their head
p34
aVon a piece of wood thousands  of times every day. Every day!
p35
aVAnd as far as anyone knows,
p36
aVthat doesn't bother them in the slightest.
p37
aa(lp38
VHow does this happen?
p39
aVTheir brain does not slosh around like ours does.
p40
aVTheir brain is packed in very tightly,
p41
aVat least for blows coming  right from the front.
p42
aVNot too many people paid attention
p43
aVto this research until the last few years
p44
aVwhen, in this country especially,
p45
aVpeople are becoming curious about
p46
aVwhat happens to the brains of football players
p47
aVwho bang their heads repeatedly.
p48
aVAnd the woodpecker maybe relates to that.
p49
aa(lp50
VThere was a paper published
p51
aVin the medical journal The Lancet
p52
aVin England a few years ago called
p53
aV" A man who pricked his finger and smelled putrid for 5 years."
p54
aVDr. Caroline Mills and her team
p55
aVreceived this patient and didn't  really know what to do about it.
p56
aVThe man had cut his finger,
p57
aVhe worked processing chickens,
p58
aVand then he started to smell really, really bad.
p59
aVSo bad that when  he got in a room
p60
aVwith the doctors and the nurses,
p61
aVthey couldn't stand being  in the room with him.
p62
aVIt was intolerable.
p63
aVThey tried every drug,
p64
aVevery other treatment they could think of.
p65
aVAfter a year, he still  smelled putrid.
p66
aVAfter two years, still smelled putrid.
p67
aVThree years, four years, still smelled putrid.
p68
aVAfter five years, it went away on its own.
p69
aVIt's a mystery.
p70
aa(lp71
VIn New Zealand, Dr. Lianne Parkin
p72
aVand her team tested an old  tradition in her city.
p73
aVThey live in a city that has huge hills,
p74
aVSan Francisco-grade hills.
p75
aVAnd in the winter there, it gets very cold
p76
aVand very icy.
p77
aVThere are lots of injuries.
p78
aVThe tradition that they tested,
p79
aVthey tested by asking people
p80
aVwho were on their way to  work in the morning,
p81
aVto stop and try something out.
p82
aVTry one of two conditions.
p83
aVThe tradition is that in the winter,
p84
aVin that city, you wear your socks on the outside of your boots.
p85
aVAnd what they discovered by experiment,
p86
aVand it was quite graphic when they saw it,
p87
aVwas that it's true.
p88
aVThat if you wear your socks on the  outside rather than the inside,
p89
aVyou're much more likely  to survive and not slip and fall.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, I hope you will agree with me that these things
p92
aVI've just described to you,
p93
aVeach of them, deserves some kind of prize. (Laughter)
p94
aVAnd that's what they got,
p95
aVeach of them got an Ig Nobel prize.
p96
aVIn 1991, I, together with bunch of other people,
p97
aVstarted the Ig Nobel prize ceremony.
p98
aVEvery year we give out 10 prizes.
p99
aVThe prizes are based on just  one criteria. It's very simple.
p100
aVIt's that you've done something that  makes people laugh and then think.
p101
aVWhat you've done makes  people laugh and then think.
p102
aVWhatever it is, there's something about it
p103
aVthat when people encounter it at first,
p104
aVtheir only possible reaction is to laugh.
p105
aVAnd then a week later,
p106
aVit's still rattling around in their heads
p107
aVand all they want to do  is tell their friends about it.
p108
aVThat's the quality we look for.
p109
aa(lp110
VEvery year, we get in the neighborhood
p111
aVof 9,000 new nominations  for the Ig Nobel prize.
p112
aVOf those, consistently between 10 percent
p113
aVand 20 percent of those nominations
p114
aVare people who nominate themselves.
p115
aVThose self-nominees almost never win.
p116
aVIt's very difficult, numerically,  to win a prize if you want to.
p117
aVEven if you don't want to,
p118
aVit's very difficult numerically.
p119
aVYou should know that when  we choose somebody
p120
aVto win an Ig Nobel prize,
p121
aVWe get in touch with that person, very quietly.
p122
aVWe offer them the chance to decline
p123
aVthis great honor if they want to.
p124
aVHappily for us, almost everyone  who's offered a prize
p125
aVdecides to accept.
p126
aa(lp127
VWhat do you get if you win an Ig Nobel prize?
p128
aVWell, you get several things.
p129
aVYou get an Ig Nobel prize.
p130
aVThe design is different every year.
p131
aVThese are always handmade from extremely cheap materials.
p132
aVYou're looking at a picture
p133
aVof the prize we gave last year, 2013.
p134
aVMost prizes in the world also give
p135
aVtheir winners some cash, some money.
p136
aVWe don't have any money,
p137
aVso we can't give them.
p138
aVIn fact, the winners have to pay their own way
p139
aVto come to the Ig Nobel ceremony,
p140
aVwhich most of them do.
p141
aVLast year, though, we did manage to scrape up some money.
p142
aVLast year, each of the 10 Ig Nobel prize winners
p143
aVreceived from us 10 trillion dollars.
p144
aVA $10 trillion bill from Zimbabwe. (Laughter)
p145
aVYou may remember that  Zimbabwe had a little adventure
p146
aVfor a few years there of inflation.
p147
aVThey ended up printing bills
p148
aVthat were in denominations as large as 100 trillion dollars.
p149
aVThe man responsible, who runs the national bank there, by the way,
p150
aVwon an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics.
p151
aa(lp152
VThe other thing you win is an invitation
p153
aVto come to the ceremony,
p154
aVwhich happens at Harvard University.
p155
aVAnd when you get there,
p156
aVyou come to Harvard's biggest  meeting place and classroom.
p157
aVIt fits 1,100 people,
p158
aVit's jammed to the gills,
p159
aVand up on the stage,
p160
aVwaiting to shake your hand,
p161
aVwaiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize,
p162
aVare a bunch of Nobel prize winners.
p163
aVThat's the heart of the ceremony.
p164
aVThe winners are kept secret until that moment,
p165
aVeven the Nobel laureates  who will shake their hand
p166
aVdon't know who they are until they're announced.
p167
aa(lp168
VI am going to tell you  about just a very few
p169
aVof the other medical-related prizes we've given.
p170
aVKeep in mind, we've given 230 prizes.
p171
aVThere are lots of these people who walk among you.
p172
aVMaybe you have one.
p173
aVA paper was published about 30 years ago
p174
aVcalled "Injuries due to Falling Coconuts."
p175
aVIt was written by Dr. Peter Barss,
p176
aVwho is Canadian.
p177
aVDr. Barss came to the ceremony
p178
aVand explained that as a young doctor,
p179
aVhe wanted to see the world.
p180
aVSo he went to Papua New Guinea.
p181
aVWhen he got there, he went to work in a hospital, and he was curious
p182
aVwhat kinds of things happen to people that bring them to the hospital.
p183
aVHe looked through the  records, and he discovered
p184
aVthat a surprisingly large number of people
p185
aVin that hospital were there
p186
aVbecause of injuries due to falling coconuts.
p187
aVOne typical thing that happens is
p188
aVpeople will come from the highlands, where there are not many coconut trees,
p189
aVdown to visit their relatives on the coast,
p190
aVwhere there are lots.
p191
aVAnd they'll think that a coconut tree
p192
aVis a fine place to stand and maybe lie down.
p193
aVA coconut tree that is 90 feet tall,
p194
aVand has coconuts that weigh two pounds
p195
aVthat can drop off at any time.
p196
aa(lp197
VA team of doctors in Europe
p198
aVpublished a series of papers about colonoscopies.
p199
aVYou're all familiar with colonoscopies,
p200
aVone way or another.
p201
aVOr in some cases,
p202
aVone way and another.
p203
aVThey, in these papers,
p204
aVexplained to their fellow doctors who perform colonoscopies,
p205
aVhow to minimize the chance
p206
aVthat when you perform a colonoscopy,
p207
aVyour patient will explode. (Laughter)
p208
aVDr. Emmanuel Ben-Soussan
p209
aVone of the authors,
p210
aVflew in from Paris to the ceremony,
p211
aVwhere he explained the history of this,
p212
aVthat in the 1950s,
p213
aVwhen colonoscopies were becoming a common technique for the first time,
p214
aVpeople were figuring out how to do it well.
p215
aVAnd there were some difficulties at first.
p216
aVThe basic problem, I'm sure you're familiar with,
p217
aVthat you're looking inside a  long, narrow, dark place.
p218
aVAnd so, you want to have a larger space.
p219
aVYou add some gas to inflate it
p220
aVso you have room to look around.
p221
aVNow, that's added to the  gas, the methane gas,
p222
aVthat's already inside.
p223
aVThe gas that they used at first, in many cases, was oxygen.
p224
aVSo they added oxygen to methane gas.
p225
aVAnd then they wanted to be able to see,
p226
aVthey needed light,
p227
aVso they'd put in a light source,
p228
aVwhich in the 1950s was very hot.
p229
aVSo you had methane gas, which is flammable,
p230
aVoxygen and heat.
p231
aVThey stopped using oxygen pretty quickly. (Laughter)
p232
aVNow it's rare that patients will explode,
p233
aVbut it does still happen.
p234
aa(lp235
VThe final thing that I want  to tell you about is a prize
p236
aVwe gave to Dr. Elena Bodnar.
p237
aVDr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere
p238
aVthat in an emergency
p239
aVcan be quickly separated
p240
aVinto a pair of protective face masks.
p241
aVOne to save your life,
p242
aVone to save the life of some  lucky bystander. (Laughter)
p243
aVWhy would someone do this, you might wonder.
p244
aVDr. Bodnar came to the ceremony
p245
aVand she explained that  she grew up in Ukraine.
p246
aVShe was one of the doctors who treated victims
p247
aVof the Chernobyl power plant meltdown.
p248
aVAnd they later discovered that
p249
aVa lot of the worst medical problems
p250
aVcame from the particles people breathed in.
p251
aVSo she was always thinking after that
p252
aVabout could there be some simple mask
p253
aVthat was available everywhere when the unexpected happens.
p254
aVYears later, she moved to America.
p255
aVShe had a baby,
p256
aVOne day she looked, and on the floor,
p257
aVher infant son had picked up her bra,
p258
aVand had her bra on his face.
p259
aVAnd that's where the idea came from.
p260
aVShe came to the Ig Nobel ceremony
p261
aVwith the first prototype of the bra
p262
aVand she demonstrated:
p263
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p264
aV["Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate  (2008) in economics"]
p265
aV["Wolfgang Ketterle, Nobel  laureate (2001) in physics"]
p266
aa(lp267
VI myself own an emergency bra. (Laughter)
p268
aVIt's my favorite bra,
p269
aVbut I would be happy to  share it with any of you,
p270
aVshould the need arise.
p271
aVThank you.
p272
aV(Applause)

VAs a singer-songwriter,
p5
aVpeople often ask me about my influences or, as I like to call them,
p6
aVmy sonic lineages.
p7
aVAnd I could easily tell you
p8
aVthat I was shaped by the jazz and hip hop that I grew up with,
p9
aVby the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors,
p10
aVor by the 1980s pop on my childhood radio stations.
p11
aVBut beyond genre, there is another question:
p12
aVhow do the sounds we hear every day influence the music that we make?
p13
aVI believe that everyday soundscape
p14
aVcan be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting,
p15
aVand to look at this idea a little bit more closely,
p16
aVI'm going to talk today about three things:
p17
aVnature, language and silence \u2014
p18
aVor rather, the impossibility of true silence.
p19
aVAnd through this I hope to give you a sense of a world
p20
aValready alive with musical expression,
p21
aVwith each of us serving as active participants,
p22
aVwhether we know it or not.
p23
aa(lp24
VI'm going to start today with nature, but before we do that,
p25
aVlet's quickly listen to this snippet of an opera singer warming up.
p26
aVHere it is.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Singing)
p29
aa(lp30
V(Singing ends)
p31
aa(lp32
VIt's beautiful, isn't it?
p33
aVGotcha!
p34
aVThat is actually not the sound of an opera singer warming up.
p35
aVThat is the sound of a bird
p36
aVslowed down to a pace
p37
aVthat the human ear mistakenly recognizes as its own.
p38
aVIt was released as part of Peter Szöke's 1987 Hungarian recording
p39
aV"The Unknown Music of Birds,"
p40
aVwhere he records many birds and slows down their pitches
p41
aVto reveal what's underneath.
p42
aVLet's listen to the full-speed recording.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Bird singing)
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, let's hear the two of them together
p47
aVso your brain can juxtapose them.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Bird singing at slow then full speed)
p50
aa(lp51
V(Singing ends)
p52
aa(lp53
VIt's incredible.
p54
aVPerhaps the techniques of opera singing were inspired by birdsong.
p55
aVAs humans, we intuitively understand birds to be our musical teachers.
p56
aa(lp57
VIn Ethiopia, birds are considered an integral part
p58
aVof the origin of music itself.
p59
aVThe story goes like this:
p60
aV1,500 years ago, a young man was born in the Empire of Aksum,
p61
aVa major trading center of the ancient world.
p62
aVHis name was Yared.
p63
aVWhen Yared was seven years old his father died,
p64
aVand his mother sent him to go live with an uncle, who was a priest
p65
aVof the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,
p66
aVone of the oldest churches in the world.
p67
aVNow, this tradition has an enormous amount of scholarship and learning,
p68
aVand Yared had to study and study and study and study,
p69
aVand one day he was studying under a tree,
p70
aVwhen three birds came to him.
p71
aVOne by one, these birds became his teachers.
p72
aVThey taught him music \u2014 scales, in fact.
p73
aVAnd Yared, eventually recognized as Saint Yared,
p74
aVused these scales to compose five volumes of chants and hymns
p75
aVfor worship and celebration.
p76
aVAnd he used these scales to compose and to create
p77
aVan indigenous musical notation system.
p78
aVAnd these scales evolved into what is known as kiñit,
p79
aVthe unique, pentatonic, five-note, modal system that is very much alive
p80
aVand thriving and still evolving in Ethiopia today.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, I love this story because it's true at multiple levels.
p83
aVSaint Yared was a real, historical figure,
p84
aVand the natural world can be our musical teacher.
p85
aVAnd we have so many examples of this:
p86
aVthe Pygmies of the Congo tune their instruments
p87
aVto the pitches of the birds in the forest around them.
p88
aVMusician and natural soundscape expert Bernie Krause describes
p89
aVhow a healthy environment has animals and insects
p90
aVtaking up low, medium and high-frequency bands,
p91
aVin exactly the same way as a symphony does.
p92
aVAnd countless works of music were inspired by bird and forest song.
p93
aVYes, the natural world can be our cultural teacher.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo let's go now to the uniquely human world of language.
p96
aVEvery language communicates with pitch to varying degrees,
p97
aVwhether it's Mandarin Chinese,
p98
aVwhere a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable
p99
aVan entirely different meaning,
p100
aVto a language like English,
p101
aVwhere a raised pitch at the end of a sentence ...
p102
aV(Going up in pitch) implies a question?
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VAs an Ethiopian-American woman,
p107
aVI grew up around the language of Amharic, Amhariña.
p108
aVIt was my first language, the language of my parents,
p109
aVone of the main languages of Ethiopia.
p110
aVAnd there are a million reasons to fall in love with this language:
p111
aVits depth of poetics, its double entendres,
p112
aVits wax and gold, its humor,
p113
aVits proverbs that illuminate the wisdom and follies of life.
p114
aVBut there's also this melodicism, a musicality built right in.
p115
aVAnd I find this distilled most clearly
p116
aVin what I like to call emphatic language \u2014
p117
aVlanguage that's meant to highlight or underline
p118
aVor that springs from surprise.
p119
aVTake, for example, the word: "indey."
p120
aVNow, if there are Ethiopians in the audience,
p121
aVthey're probably chuckling to themselves,
p122
aVbecause the word means something like "No!"
p123
aVor "How could he?" or "No, he didn't."
p124
aVIt kind of depends on the situation.
p125
aVBut when I was a kid, this was my very favorite word,
p126
aVand I think it's because it has a pitch.
p127
aVIt has a melody.
p128
aVYou can almost see the shape as it springs from someone's mouth.
p129
aV"Indey" \u2014 it dips, and then raises again.
p130
aVAnd as a musician and composer, when I hear that word,
p131
aVsomething like this is floating through my mind.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Music and singing "Indey")
p134
aa(lp135
V(Music ends)
p136
aa(lp137
VOr take, for example, the phrase for "It is right" or "It is correct" \u2014
p138
aV"Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu."
p139
aVIt's an affirmation, an agreement.
p140
aV"Lickih nehu."
p141
aVWhen I hear that phrase,
p142
aVsomething like this starts rolling through my mind.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Music and singing "Lickih nehu")
p145
aa(lp146
V(Music ends)
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd in both of those cases, what I did was I took the melody
p149
aVand the phrasing of those words and phrases
p150
aVand I turned them into musical parts to use in these short compositions.
p151
aVAnd I like to write bass lines,
p152
aVso they both ended up kind of as bass lines.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, this is based on the work of Jason Moran and others
p155
aVwho work intimately with music and language,
p156
aVbut it's also something I've had in my head since I was a kid,
p157
aVhow musical my parents sounded
p158
aVwhen they were speaking to each other and to us.
p159
aVIt was from them and from Amhariña that I learned
p160
aVthat we are awash in musical expression
p161
aVwith every word, every sentence that we speak,
p162
aVevery word, every sentence that we receive.
p163
aVPerhaps you can hear it in the words I'm speaking even now.
p164
aa(lp165
VFinally, we go to the 1950s United States
p166
aVand the most seminal work of 20th century avant-garde composition:
p167
aVJohn Cage's "4:33,"
p168
aVwritten for any instrument or combination of instruments.
p169
aVThe musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage
p170
aVwith a stopwatch and open the score,
p171
aVwhich was actually purchased by the Museum of Modern Art \u2014
p172
aVthe score, that is.
p173
aVAnd this score has not a single note written
p174
aVand there is not a single note played
p175
aVfor four minutes and 33 seconds.
p176
aVAnd, at once enraging and enrapturing,
p177
aVCage shows us that even when there are no strings
p178
aVbeing plucked by fingers or hands hammering piano keys,
p179
aVstill there is music, still there is music,
p180
aVstill there is music.
p181
aVAnd what is this music?
p182
aVIt was that sneeze in the back.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VIt is the everyday soundscape that arises from the audience themselves:
p187
aVtheir coughs, their sighs, their rustles, their whispers, their sneezes,
p188
aVthe room, the wood of the floors and the walls
p189
aVexpanding and contracting, creaking and groaning
p190
aVwith the heat and the cold,
p191
aVthe pipes clanking and contributing.
p192
aVAnd controversial though it was, and even controversial though it remains,
p193
aVCage's point is that there is no such thing as true silence.
p194
aVEven in the most silent environments, we still hear and feel the sound
p195
aVof our own heartbeats.
p196
aVThe world is alive with musical expression.
p197
aVWe are already immersed.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, I had my own moment of, let's say, remixing John Cage
p200
aVa couple of months ago
p201
aVwhen I was standing in front of the stove cooking lentils.
p202
aVAnd it was late one night and it was time to stir,
p203
aVso I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,
p204
aVand I placed it onto the kitchen counter next to me,
p205
aVand it started to roll back and forth
p206
aVmaking this sound.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Sound of metal lid clanking against a counter)
p209
aa(lp210
V(Clanking ends)
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd it stopped me cold.
p213
aVI thought, "What a weird, cool swing that cooking pan lid has."
p214
aVSo when the lentils were ready and eaten,
p215
aVI hightailed it to my backyard studio,
p216
aVand I made this.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Music, including the sound of the lid, and singing)
p219
aa(lp220
V(Music ends)
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, John Cage wasn't instructing musicians
p223
aVto mine the soundscape for sonic textures to turn into music.
p224
aVHe was saying that on its own,
p225
aVthe environment is musically generative,
p226
aVthat it is generous, that it is fertile,
p227
aVthat we are already immersed.
p228
aa(lp229
VMusician, music researcher, surgeon and human hearing expert Charles Limb
p230
aVis a professor at Johns Hopkins University
p231
aVand he studies music and the brain.
p232
aVAnd he has a theory
p233
aVthat it is possible \u2014 it is possible \u2014
p234
aVthat the human auditory system actually evolved to hear music,
p235
aVbecause it is so much more complex than it needs to be for language alone.
p236
aVAnd if that's true,
p237
aVit means that we're hard-wired for music,
p238
aVthat we can find it anywhere,
p239
aVthat there is no such thing as a musical desert,
p240
aVthat we are permanently hanging out at the oasis,
p241
aVand that is marvelous.
p242
aVWe can add to the soundtrack, but it's already playing.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd it doesn't mean don't study music.
p245
aVStudy music, trace your sonic lineages and enjoy that exploration.
p246
aVBut there is a kind of sonic lineage to which we all belong.
p247
aVSo the next time you are seeking percussion inspiration,
p248
aVlook no further than your tires, as they roll over the unusual grooves
p249
aVof the freeway,
p250
aVor the top-right burner of your stove
p251
aVand that strange way that it clicks
p252
aVas it is preparing to light.
p253
aVWhen seeking melodic inspiration,
p254
aVlook no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras
p255
aVor to the natural lilt of emphatic language.
p256
aVWe are the audience and we are the composers
p257
aVand we take from these pieces
p258
aVwe are given.
p259
aVWe make, we make, we make, we make,
p260
aVknowing that when it comes to nature or language or soundscape,
p261
aVthere is no end to the inspiration \u2014
p262
aVif we are listening.
p263
aa(lp264
VThank you.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Applause)

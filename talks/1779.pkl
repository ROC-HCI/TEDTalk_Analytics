VThere's an old joke about a cop
p5
aVwho's walking his beat in the middle of the night,
p6
aVand he comes across a guy under a street lamp
p7
aVwho's looking at the ground and moving from side to side,
p8
aVand the cop asks him what he's doing.
p9
aVThe guys says he's looking for his keys.
p10
aVSo the cop takes his time
p11
aVand looks over and kind of makes a little matrix
p12
aVand looks for about two, three minutes.
p13
aVNo keys.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe cop says, "Are you sure?
p16
aVHey buddy, are you sure you lost your keys here?"
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd the guy says, "No, actually I lost them
p19
aVdown at the other end of the street,
p20
aVbut the light is better here."
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VThere's a concept that people talk about nowadays called "big data."
p25
aVAnd what they're talking about is all of the information
p26
aVthat we're generating through our interaction
p27
aVwith and over the Internet,
p28
aVeverything from Facebook and Twitter
p29
aVto music downloads, movies, streaming, all this kind of stuff,
p30
aVthe live streaming of TED.
p31
aVAnd the folks who work with big data, for them,
p32
aVthey talk about that their biggest problem
p33
aVis we have so much information.
p34
aVThe biggest problem is: how do we organize all that information?
p35
aa(lp36
VI can tell you that, working in global health,
p37
aVthat is not our biggest problem.
p38
aVBecause for us, even though the light is better on the Internet,
p39
aVthe data that would help us solve the problems we're trying to solve
p40
aVis not actually present on the Internet.
p41
aVSo we don't know, for example,
p42
aVhow many people right now are being affected by disasters
p43
aVor by conflict situations.
p44
aVWe don't know for, really, basically, any of the clinics
p45
aVin the developing world,
p46
aVwhich ones have medicines and which ones don't.
p47
aVWe have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics.
p48
aVWe don't know \u2014 and this is really amazing to me \u2014 we don't know
p49
aVhow many children were born \u2014 or how many children there are \u2014
p50
aVin Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan.
p51
aVWe don't know how many kids died last week
p52
aVin any of those countries.
p53
aVWe don't know the needs of the elderly, the mentally ill.
p54
aVFor all of these different critically important problems
p55
aVor critically important areas that we want to solve problems in,
p56
aVwe basically know nothing at all.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd part of the reason why we don't know anything at all
p59
aVis that the information technology systems that we use in global health
p60
aVto find the data to solve these problems is what you see here.
p61
aVThis is about a 5,000-year-old technology.
p62
aVSome of you may have used it before.
p63
aVIt's kind of on its way out now,
p64
aVbut we still use it for 99 percent of our stuff.
p65
aVThis is a paper form.
p66
aVAnd what you're looking at is a paper form
p67
aVin the hand of a Ministry of Health nurse in Indonesia,
p68
aVwho is tramping out across the countryside
p69
aVin Indonesia on, I'm sure, a very hot and humid day,
p70
aVand she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors
p71
aVover a period of weeks or months,
p72
aVknocking on the doors and saying,
p73
aV"Excuse me, we'd like to ask you some questions.
p74
aVDo you have any children? Were your children vaccinated?"
p75
aa(lp76
VBecause the only way we can actually find out
p77
aVhow many children were vaccinated in the country of Indonesia,
p78
aVwhat percentage were vaccinated,
p79
aVis actually not on the Internet, but by going out and knocking on doors,
p80
aVsometimes tens of thousands of doors.
p81
aVSometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this.
p82
aVYou know, a census of Indonesia
p83
aVwould probably take two years to accomplish.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd the problem, of course, with all of this
p86
aVis that, with all those paper forms \u2014
p87
aVand I'm telling you, we have paper forms for every possible thing:
p88
aVWe have paper forms for vaccination surveys.
p89
aVWe have paper forms to track people who come into clinics.
p90
aVWe have paper forms to track drug supplies, blood supplies \u2014
p91
aVall these different paper forms for many different topics,
p92
aVthey all have a single, common endpoint,
p93
aVand the common endpoint looks something like this.
p94
aVAnd what we're looking at here is a truckful of data.
p95
aVThis is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey
p96
aVin a single district in the country of Zambia
p97
aVfrom a few years ago, that I participated in.
p98
aVThe only thing anyone was trying to find out
p99
aVis what percentage of Zambian children are vaccinated,
p100
aVand this is the data, collected on paper over weeks,
p101
aVfrom a single district,
p102
aVwhich is something like a county in the United States.
p103
aVYou can imagine that, for the entire country of Zambia,
p104
aVanswering just that single question ...
p105
aVlooks something like this.
p106
aVTruck after truck after truck,
p107
aVfilled with stack after stack after stack of data.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd what makes it even worse is that's just the beginning.
p110
aVBecause once you've collected all that data,
p111
aVof course, someone \u2014 some unfortunate person \u2014
p112
aVis going to have to type that into a computer.
p113
aVWhen I was a graduate student,
p114
aVI actually was that unfortunate person sometimes.
p115
aVI can tell you, I often wasn't really paying attention.
p116
aVI probably made a lot of mistakes when I did it
p117
aVthat no one ever discovered, so data quality goes down.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut eventually that data, hopefully, gets typed into a computer,
p120
aVand someone can begin to analyze it,
p121
aVand once they have an analysis and a report,
p122
aVhopefully, then you can take the results of that data collection
p123
aVand use it to vaccinate children better.
p124
aa(lp125
VBecause if there's anything worse in the field of global public health \u2014
p126
aVI don't know what's worse than allowing children on this planet
p127
aVto die of vaccine-preventable diseases \u2014
p128
aVdiseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar.
p129
aVAnd millions of children die of these diseases every year.
p130
aVAnd the fact is, millions is a gross estimate,
p131
aVbecause we don't really know how many kids die each year of this.
p132
aa(lp133
VWhat makes it even more frustrating is that the data-entry part,
p134
aVthe part that I used to do as a grad student,
p135
aVcan take sometimes six months.
p136
aVSometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer,
p137
aVAnd sometimes, actually not infrequently,
p138
aVit actually never happens.
p139
aVNow try and wrap your head around that for a second.
p140
aVYou just had teams of hundreds of people.
p141
aVThey went out into the field to answer a particular question.
p142
aVYou probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
p143
aVon fuel and photocopying and per diem.
p144
aVAnd then for some reason, momentum is lost
p145
aVor there's no money left,
p146
aVand all of that comes to nothing,
p147
aVbecause no one actually types it into the computer at all.
p148
aVThe process just stops.
p149
aVHappens all the time.
p150
aVThis is what we base our decisions on in global health:
p151
aVlittle data, old data, no data.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo back in 1995,
p154
aVI began to think about ways in which we could improve this process.
p155
aVNow 1995 \u2014 obviously, that was quite a long time ago.
p156
aVIt kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was.
p157
aVThe top movie of the year was "Die Hard with a Vengeance."
p158
aVAs you can see, Bruce Willis had a lot more hair back then.
p159
aVI was working in the Centers for Disease Control
p160
aVand I had a lot more hair back then as well.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut to me, the most significant thing that I saw in 1995
p163
aVwas this.
p164
aVHard for us to imagine, but in 1995,
p165
aVthis was the ultimate elite mobile device.
p166
aVIt wasn't an iPhone. It wasn't a Galaxy phone.
p167
aVIt was a PalmPilot.
p168
aVAnd when I saw the PalmPilot for the first time, I thought,
p169
aV"Why can't we put the forms on these PalmPilots?
p170
aVAnd go out into the field just carrying one PalmPilot,
p171
aVwhich can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms?
p172
aVWhy don't we try to do that?
p173
aVBecause if we can do that,
p174
aVif we can actually just collect the data electronically, digitally,
p175
aVfrom the very beginning,
p176
aVwe can just put a shortcut right through that whole process
p177
aVof typing, of having somebody type that stuff into the computer.
p178
aVWe can skip straight to the analysis
p179
aVand then straight to the use of the data to actually save lives."
p180
aa(lp181
VSo that's what I began to do.
p182
aVWorking at CDC, I began to travel to different programs around the world
p183
aVand to train them in using PalmPilots to do data collection,
p184
aVinstead of using paper.
p185
aVAnd it actually worked great.
p186
aVIt worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted.
p187
aVWhat do you know?
p188
aVDigital data collection is actually more efficient than collecting on paper.
p189
aVWhile I was doing it, my business partner,
p190
aVRose, who's here with her husband, Matthew, here in the audience,
p191
aVRose was out doing similar stuff for the American Red Cross.
p192
aa(lp193
VThe problem was, after a few years of doing that,
p194
aVI realized \u2014 I had been to maybe six or seven programs \u2014
p195
aVand I thought, you know, if I keep this up at this pace,
p196
aVover my whole career,
p197
aVmaybe I'm going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs.
p198
aVBut the problem is, 20 or 30 programs,
p199
aVlike, training 20 or 30 programs to use this technology,
p200
aVthat is a tiny drop in the bucket.
p201
aVThe demand for this, the need for data to run better programs
p202
aVjust within health \u2014 not to mention all of the other fields
p203
aVin developing countries \u2014 is enormous.
p204
aVThere are millions and millions and millions of programs,
p205
aVmillions of clinics that need to track drugs,
p206
aVmillions of vaccine programs.
p207
aVThere are schools that need to track attendance.
p208
aVThere are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do.
p209
aVAnd I realized if I kept up the way that I was doing,
p210
aVI was basically hardly going to make any impact
p211
aVby the end of my career.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd so I began to rack my brain,
p214
aVtrying to think about, what was the process that I was doing?
p215
aVHow was I training folks,
p216
aVand what were the bottlenecks and what were the obstacles
p217
aVto doing it faster and to doing it more efficiently?
p218
aVAnd, unfortunately, after thinking about this for some time,
p219
aVI identified the main obstacle.
p220
aVAnd the main obstacle, it turned out \u2014
p221
aVand this is a sad realization \u2014
p222
aVthe main obstacle was me.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo what do I mean by that?
p225
aVI had developed a process
p226
aVwhereby I was the center of the universe of this technology.
p227
aVIf you wanted to use this technology, you had to get in touch with me.
p228
aVThat means you had to know I existed.
p229
aVThen you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country
p230
aVand the money to pay for my hotel and my per diem and my daily rate.
p231
aVSo you could be talking about 10- or 20- or 30,000 dollars,
p232
aVif I actually had the time or it fit my schedule
p233
aVand I wasn't on vacation.
p234
aVThe point is that anything,
p235
aVany system that depends on a single human being
p236
aVor two or three or five human beings \u2014
p237
aVit just doesn't scale.
p238
aVAnd this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology,
p239
aVand we need to scale it now.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd so I began to think of ways in which I could basically
p242
aVtake myself out of the picture.
p243
aVAnd, you know, I was thinking,
p244
aV"How could I take myself out of the picture?"
p245
aVfor quite some time.
p246
aVI'd been trained that the way you distribute technology
p247
aVwithin international development
p248
aVis always consultant-based.
p249
aVIt's always guys that look pretty much like me,
p250
aVflying from countries that look pretty much like this
p251
aVto other countries with people with darker skin.
p252
aVAnd you go out there, and you spend money on airfare
p253
aVand you spend time and you spend per diem
p254
aVand you spend for a hotel and all that stuff.
p255
aVAs far as I knew, that was the only way you could distribute technology,
p256
aVand I couldn't figure out a way around it.
p257
aa(lp258
VBut the miracle that happened \u2014
p259
aVI'm going to call it Hotmail for short.
p260
aVYou may not think of Hotmail as being miraculous,
p261
aVbut for me it was miraculous,
p262
aVbecause I noticed, just as I was wrestling with this problem \u2014
p263
aVI was working in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly, at the time \u2014
p264
aVI noticed that every sub-Saharan African health worker
p265
aVthat I was working with had a Hotmail account.
p266
aVAnd it struck me, "Wait a minute \u2014
p267
aVI know the Hotmail people surely didn't fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya
p268
aVto train people in how to use Hotmail.
p269
aVSo these guys are distributing technology, getting software capacity out there,
p270
aVbut they're not actually flying around the world.
p271
aVI need to think about this more."
p272
aVWhile I was thinking about it,
p273
aVpeople started using even more things like this, just as we were.
p274
aVThey started using LinkedIn and Flickr and Gmail and Google Maps \u2014
p275
aVall these things.
p276
aVOf course, all of these things are cloud based
p277
aVand don't require any training.
p278
aVThey don't require any programmers.
p279
aVThey don't require consultants.
p280
aVBecause the business model for all these businesses
p281
aVrequires that something be so simple we can use it ourselves,
p282
aVwith little or no training.
p283
aVYou just have to hear about it and go to the website.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd so I thought, what would happen if we built software
p286
aVto do what I'd been consulting in?
p287
aVInstead of training people how to put forms onto mobile devices,
p288
aVlet's create software that lets them do it themselves with no training
p289
aVand without me being involved.
p290
aVAnd that's exactly what we did.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo we created software called Magpi, which has an online form creator.
p293
aVNo one has to speak to me,
p294
aVyou just have to hear about it and go to the website.
p295
aVYou can create forms, and once you've created the forms,
p296
aVyou push them to a variety of common mobile phones.
p297
aVObviously, nowadays, we've moved past PalmPilots to mobile phones.
p298
aVAnd it doesn't have to be a smartphone, it can be a basic phone,
p299
aVlike the phone on the right, the basic Symbian phone
p300
aVthat's very common in developing countries.
p301
aVAnd the great part about this is it's just like Hotmail.
p302
aVIt's cloud based,
p303
aVand it doesn't require any training, programming, consultants.
p304
aa(lp305
VBut there are some additional benefits as well.
p306
aVNow we knew when we built this system,
p307
aVthe whole point of it, just like with the PalmPilots,
p308
aVwas that you'd be able to collect the data
p309
aVand immediately upload the data and get your data set.
p310
aVBut what we found, of course, since it's already on a computer,
p311
aVwe can deliver instant maps and analysis and graphing.
p312
aVWe can take a process that took two years
p313
aVand compress that down to the space of five minutes.
p314
aVUnbelievable improvements in efficiency.
p315
aVCloud based, no training, no consultants, no me.
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd I told you that in the first few years
p318
aVof trying to do this the old-fashioned way,
p319
aVgoing out to each country,
p320
aVwe probably trained about 1,000 people.
p321
aVWhat happened after we did this?
p322
aVIn the second three years,
p323
aVwe had 14,000 people find the website,
p324
aVsign up and start using it to collect data:
p325
aVdata for disaster response,
p326
aVCanadian pig farmers tracking pig disease and pig herds,
p327
aVpeople tracking drug supplies.
p328
aa(lp329
VOne of my favorite examples, the IRC, International Rescue Committee,
p330
aVthey have a program where semi-literate midwives,
p331
aVusing $10 mobile phones,
p332
aVsend a text message using our software, once a week,
p333
aVwith the number of births and the number of deaths,
p334
aVwhich gives IRC something that no one in global health has ever had:
p335
aVa near-real-time system of counting babies,
p336
aVof knowing how many kids are born,
p337
aVof knowing how many children there are in Sierra Leone,
p338
aVwhich is the country where this is happening,
p339
aVand knowing how many children die.
p340
aa(lp341
VPhysicians for Human Rights \u2014
p342
aVthis is moving a little bit outside the health field \u2014
p343
aVthey're basically training people to do rape exams in Congo,
p344
aVwhere this is an epidemic,
p345
aVa horrible epidemic,
p346
aVand they're using our software to document the evidence they find,
p347
aVincluding photographically,
p348
aVso that they can bring the perpetrators to justice.
p349
aa(lp350
VCamfed, another charity based out of the UK \u2014
p351
aVCamfed pays girls' families to keep them in school.
p352
aVThey understand this is the most significant intervention they can make.
p353
aVThey used to track the disbursements, the attendance, the grades, on paper.
p354
aVThe turnaround time between a teacher writing down grades or attendance
p355
aVand getting that into a report was about two to three years.
p356
aVNow it's real time.
p357
aVAnd because this is such a low-cost system and based in the cloud,
p358
aVit costs, for the entire five countries that Camfed runs this in,
p359
aVwith tens of thousands of girls,
p360
aVthe whole cost combined is 10,000 dollars a year.
p361
aVThat's less than I used to get
p362
aVjust traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation.
p363
aa(lp364
VSo I told you before that when we were doing it the old-fashioned way,
p365
aVI realized all of our work was really adding up to just a drop in the bucket \u2014
p366
aV10, 20, 30 different programs.
p367
aVWe've made a lot of progress,
p368
aVbut I recognize that right now,
p369
aVeven the work that we've done with 14,000 people using this
p370
aVis still a drop in the bucket.
p371
aa(lp372
VBut something's changed, and I think it should be obvious.
p373
aVWhat's changed now is,
p374
aVinstead of having a program in which we're scaling at such a slow rate
p375
aVthat we can never reach all the people who need us,
p376
aVwe've made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us.
p377
aVWe've created a tool that lets programs keep kids in school,
p378
aVtrack the number of babies that are born and the number of babies that die,
p379
aVcatch criminals and successfully prosecute them \u2014
p380
aVto do all these different things to learn more about what's going on,
p381
aVto understand more,
p382
aVto see more ...
p383
aVand to save lives and improve lives.
p384
aa(lp385
VThank you.

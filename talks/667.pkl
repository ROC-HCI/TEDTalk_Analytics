VAll buildings today have something in common.
p5
aVThey're made using Victorian technologies.
p6
aVThis involves blueprints,
p7
aVindustrial manufacturing
p8
aVand construction using teams of workers.
p9
aVAll of this effort results in an inert object.
p10
aVAnd that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy
p11
aVfrom our environment into our homes and cities.
p12
aVThis is not sustainable.
p13
aVI believe that the only way that it is possible for us
p14
aVto construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities
p15
aVis by connecting them to nature,
p16
aVnot insulating them from it.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.
p19
aVLiving systems are in constant conversation
p20
aVwith the natural world,
p21
aVthrough sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.
p22
aVAnd this is the conversion of one group of substances
p23
aVinto another, either through
p24
aVthe production or the absorption of energy.
p25
aVAnd this is the way in which living materials
p26
aVmake the most of their local resources
p27
aVin a sustainable way.
p28
aVSo, I'm interested in the use of
p29
aVmetabolic materials for the practice of architecture.
p30
aVBut they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.
p31
aa(lp32
VI'm working with architect Neil Spiller
p33
aVat the Bartlett School of Architecture,
p34
aVand we're collaborating with international scientists
p35
aVin order to generate these new materials
p36
aVfrom a bottom up approach.
p37
aVThat means we're generating them from scratch.
p38
aVOne of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,
p39
aVand he's really interested in the transition from
p40
aVinert to living matter.
p41
aVNow, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,
p42
aVwhen we're thinking about sustainable materials.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.
p45
aVNow all this is \u2014 and it's magic \u2014
p46
aVis a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
p47
aVAnd it has no DNA.
p48
aVThis little bag is able to conduct itself
p49
aVin a way that can only be described as living.
p50
aVIt is able to move around its environment.
p51
aVIt can follow chemical gradients.
p52
aVIt can undergo complex reactions,
p53
aVsome of which are happily architectural.
p54
aVSo here we are. These are protocells,
p55
aVpatterning their environment.
p56
aVWe don't know how they do that yet.
p57
aVHere, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.
p58
aVNow, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
p59
aVThis is a violent process.
p60
aa(lp61
VHere, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide
p62
aVout of the atmosphere
p63
aVand turn it into carbonate.
p64
aVAnd that's the shell around that globular fat.
p65
aVThey are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.
p66
aVSo what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies
p67
aVtowards creating bottom-up construction approaches
p68
aVfor architecture,
p69
aVwhich contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods
p70
aVwhich impose structure upon matter.
p71
aVThat can't be energetically sensible.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo, bottom-up materials
p74
aVactually exist today.
p75
aVThey've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.
p76
aVIf you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,
p77
aVand have a look at the brickwork,
p78
aVwhich I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,
p79
aVyou'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
p80
aVAnd if you look even closer,
p81
aVyou'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells
p82
aVand little skeletons that are piled upon each other.
p83
aVAnd then they are fossilized over millions of years.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow a block of limestone, in itself,
p86
aVisn't particularly that interesting.
p87
aVIt looks beautiful.
p88
aVBut imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be
p89
aVif the surfaces were actually
p90
aVin conversation with the atmosphere.
p91
aVMaybe they could extract carbon dioxide.
p92
aVWould it give this block of limestone new properties?
p93
aVWell, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
p94
aVIt might be able to self-repair, and even respond
p95
aVto dramatic changes
p96
aVin the immediate environment.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo, architects are never happy
p99
aVwith just one block of an interesting material.
p100
aVThey think big. Okay?
p101
aVSo when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,
p102
aVwe can start thinking about ecological interventions
p103
aVlike repair of atolls,
p104
aVor reclamation of parts of a city
p105
aVthat are damaged by water.
p106
aVSo, one of these examples
p107
aVwould of course be the historic city of Venice.
p108
aVNow, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,
p109
aVand is built upon wooden piles.
p110
aVSo we've devised a way by which it may be possible
p111
aVfor the protocell technology that we're working with
p112
aVto sustainably reclaim Venice.
p113
aVAnd architect Christian Kerrigan
p114
aVhas come up with a series of designs that show us
p115
aVhow it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef
p116
aVunderneath the city.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo, here is the technology we have today.
p119
aVThis is our protocell technology,
p120
aVeffectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,
p121
aVand depositing it in a very complex environment,
p122
aVagainst natural materials.
p123
aVWe're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.
p124
aVNow, this is the very interesting part.
p125
aVWe don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.
p126
aVWhat we need it to do is to be
p127
aVcreatively crafted around the wooden piles.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually
p130
aVmoving away from the light,
p131
aVtoward the dark foundations.
p132
aVWe've observed this in the laboratory.
p133
aVThe protocells can actually move away from the light.
p134
aVThey can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.
p135
aVSo that these don't just exist as one entity,
p136
aVwe kind of chemically engineer them.
p137
aVAnd so here the protocells are depositing their limestone
p138
aVvery specifically, around the foundations of Venice,
p139
aVeffectively petrifying it.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.
p142
aVIt's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology
p143
aVin order for us to become ready
p144
aVto test it out in a case-by-case basis
p145
aVon the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
p146
aVBut gradually, as the buildings are repaired,
p147
aVwe will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.
p148
aVAn accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
p149
aVAlso it will attract the local marine ecology,
p150
aVwho will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture
p153
aVthat connects a city to the natural world
p154
aVin a very direct and immediate way.
p155
aVBut perhaps the most exciting thing about it
p156
aVis that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
p157
aVThis is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,
p158
aVwhich means that this technology is just as appropriate
p159
aVfor developing countries as it is
p160
aVfor First World countries.
p161
aVSo, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials
p162
aVas a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,
p163
aVand building architectures from a bottom-up approach.
p164
aa(lp165
VSecondly, these metabolic materials
p166
aVhave some of the properties of living systems,
p167
aVwhich means they can perform in similar ways.
p168
aVThey can expect to have a lot of forms and functions
p169
aVwithin the practice of architecture.
p170
aVAnd finally, an observer in the future
p171
aVmarveling at a beautiful structure in the environment
p172
aVmay find it almost impossible to tell
p173
aVwhether this structure
p174
aVhas been created by a natural process
p175
aVor an artificial one.
p176
aVThank you.

Biology &ndash; the rational engineering of living systems - and smart chemistry. Her research prompts a reevaluation of how we think about our homes and cities and raises questions about sustainable development of the built environment. She creates open innovation platforms for academia and industry to address environmental challenges such as carbon capture &amp; recycling, smart &lsquo;living&rsquo; materials and sustainable design. </p><p>Her award winning research underpins her bold approach to the way that she challenges perceptions, presumptions and established principles related to scientific concepts and the building blocks of life and society. She embodies and promotes new transferrable ways of thinking &lsquo;outside of the box&rsquo; and enables others to also develop innovative environmental solutions.

VFor a long time in my life,
p5
aVI felt like I'd been living two different lives.
p6
aVThere's the life that everyone sees,
p7
aVand then there's the life that only I see.
p8
aVAnd in the life that everyone sees,
p9
aVwho I am is a friend,
p10
aVa son, a brother,
p11
aVa stand-up comedian and a teenager.
p12
aVThat's the life everyone sees.
p13
aVIf you were to ask my friends and family to describe me,
p14
aVthat's what they would tell you.
p15
aVAnd that's a huge part of me. That is who I am.
p16
aVAnd if you were to ask me to describe myself,
p17
aVI'd probably say some of those same things.
p18
aVAnd I wouldn't be lying,
p19
aVbut I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either,
p20
aVbecause the truth is,
p21
aVthat's just the life everyone else sees.
p22
aVIn the life that only I see, who I am,
p23
aVwho I really am,
p24
aVis someone who struggles intensely with depression.
p25
aVI have for the last six years of my life,
p26
aVand I continue to every day.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, for someone who has never experienced depression
p29
aVor doesn't really know what that means,
p30
aVthat might surprise them to hear,
p31
aVbecause there's this pretty popular misconception
p32
aVthat depression is just being sad
p33
aVwhen something in your life goes wrong,
p34
aVwhen you break up with your girlfriend,
p35
aVwhen you lose a loved one,
p36
aVwhen you don't get the job you wanted.
p37
aVBut that's sadness. That's a natural thing.
p38
aVThat's a natural human emotion.
p39
aVReal depression isn't being sad
p40
aVwhen something in your life goes wrong.
p41
aVReal depression is being sad
p42
aVwhen everything in your life is going right.
p43
aVThat's real depression, and that's what I suffer from.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd to be totally honest,
p46
aVthat's hard for me to stand up here and say.
p47
aVIt's hard for me to talk about,
p48
aVand it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about,
p49
aVso much so that no one's talking about it.
p50
aVAnd no one's talking about depression, but we need to be,
p51
aVbecause right now it's a massive problem.
p52
aVIt's a massive problem.
p53
aVBut we don't see it on social media, right?
p54
aVWe don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter.
p55
aVWe don't see it on the news, because it's not happy,
p56
aVit's not fun, it's not light.
p57
aVAnd so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this:
p60
aVevery 30 seconds,
p61
aVevery 30 seconds, somewhere,
p62
aVsomeone in the world takes their own life
p63
aVbecause of depression,
p64
aVand it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away,
p65
aVit might be two continents away, but it's happening,
p66
aVand it's happening every single day.
p67
aVAnd we have a tendency, as a society,
p68
aVto look at that and go, "So what?"
p69
aVSo what? We look at that, and we go, "That's your problem.
p70
aVThat's their problem."
p71
aVWe say we're sad and we say we're sorry,
p72
aVbut we also say, "So what?"
p73
aa(lp74
VWell, two years ago it was my problem,
p75
aVbecause I sat on the edge of my bed
p76
aVwhere I'd sat a million times before
p77
aVand I was suicidal.
p78
aVI was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface,
p79
aVyou wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.
p80
aVYou'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team,
p81
aVthe drama and theater student of the year,
p82
aVthe English student of the year,
p83
aVsomeone who was consistently on the honor roll
p84
aVand consistently at every party.
p85
aVSo you would say I wasn't depressed, you would say
p86
aVI wasn't suicidal, but you would be wrong.
p87
aVYou would be wrong. So I sat there that night
p88
aVbeside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand
p89
aVand I thought about taking my own life
p90
aVand I came this close to doing it.
p91
aVI came this close to doing it.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones,
p94
aVone of the people who gets to step out on the ledge
p95
aVand look down but not jump,
p96
aVone of the lucky ones who survives.
p97
aVWell, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story,
p98
aVand my story is this:
p99
aVIn four simple words, I suffer from depression.
p100
aVI suffer from depression,
p101
aVand for a long time, I think,
p102
aVI was living two totally different lives,
p103
aVwhere one person was always afraid of the other.
p104
aVI was afraid that people would see me for who I really was,
p105
aVthat I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was,
p106
aVthat beneath my smile, there was struggle,
p107
aVand beneath my light, there was dark,
p108
aVand beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain.
p109
aa(lp110
VSee, some people might fear girls not liking them back.
p111
aVSome people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death.
p112
aVBut for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.
p113
aVI feared my truth, I feared my honesty, I feared my vulnerability,
p114
aVand that fear made me feel
p115
aVlike I was forced into a corner,
p116
aVlike I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out,
p117
aVand so I thought about that way every single day.
p118
aVI thought about it every single day,
p119
aVand if I'm being totally honest, standing here
p120
aVI've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness,
p121
aVthat's the struggle, that's depression,
p122
aVand depression isn't chicken pox.
p123
aVYou don't beat it once and it's gone forever.
p124
aVIt's something you live with. It's something you live in.
p125
aVIt's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore.
p126
aVIt's the feelings you can't seem to escape,
p127
aVthe scariest part is that after a while,
p128
aVyou become numb to it. It becomes normal for you,
p129
aVand what you really fear the most
p130
aVisn't the suffering inside of you.
p131
aVIt's the stigma inside of others,
p132
aVit's the shame, it's the embarrassment,
p133
aVit's the disapproving look on a friend's face,
p134
aVit's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak,
p135
aVit's the comments that you're crazy.
p136
aVThat's what keeps you from getting help.
p137
aVThat's what makes you hold it in and hide it.
p138
aVIt's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it,
p139
aVand you hold it in and you hide it,
p140
aVand even though it's keeping you in bed every day
p141
aVand it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it,
p142
aVyou hide it, because the stigma in our society
p143
aVaround depression is very real.
p144
aVIt's very real, and if you think that it isn't, ask yourself this:
p145
aVWould you rather make your next Facebook status
p146
aVsay you're having a tough time getting out of bed
p147
aVbecause you hurt your back
p148
aVor you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning
p149
aVbecause you're depressed?
p150
aVThat's the stigma, because unfortunately,
p151
aVwe live in a world where if you break your arm,
p152
aVeveryone runs over to sign your cast,
p153
aVbut if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.
p154
aVThat's the stigma.
p155
aVWe are so, so, so accepting of any body part breaking down
p156
aVother than our brains. And that's ignorance.
p157
aVThat's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created
p158
aVa world that doesn't understand depression,
p159
aVthat doesn't understand mental health.
p160
aVAnd that's ironic to me, because depression
p161
aVis one of the best documented problems we have in the world,
p162
aVyet it's one of the least discussed.
p163
aVWe just push it aside and put it in a corner
p164
aVand pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself.
p165
aa(lp166
VWell, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to,
p167
aVbecause that's wishful thinking,
p168
aVand wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination,
p169
aVand we can't procrastinate on something this important.
p170
aVThe first step in solving any problem
p171
aVis recognizing there is one.
p172
aVWell, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect
p173
aVto find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd I don't know what the solution is.
p176
aVI wish I did, but I don't \u2014 but I think,
p177
aVI think it has to start here.
p178
aVIt has to start with me, it has to start with you,
p179
aVit has to start with the people who are suffering,
p180
aVthe ones who are hidden in the shadows.
p181
aVWe need to speak up and shatter the silence.
p182
aVWe need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in,
p183
aVbecause if there's one thing that I've come to realize,
p184
aVif there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem,
p185
aVit's not in building a world
p186
aVwhere we eliminate the ignorance of others.
p187
aVIt's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves,
p188
aVwhere we're okay with who we are,
p189
aVbecause when we get honest,
p190
aVwe see that we all struggle and we all suffer.
p191
aVWhether it's with this, whether it's with something else,
p192
aVwe all know what it is to hurt.
p193
aVWe all know what it is to have pain in our heart,
p194
aVand we all know how important it is to heal.
p195
aVBut right now, depression is society's deep cut
p196
aVthat we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there.
p197
aa(lp198
VWell, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay.
p199
aVDepression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.
p200
aVAnd know that you're sick, you're not weak,
p201
aVand it's an issue, not an identity,
p202
aVbecause when you get past the fear and the ridicule
p203
aVand the judgment and the stigma of others,
p204
aVyou can see depression for what it really is,
p205
aVand that's just a part of life,
p206
aVjust a part of life, and as much as I hate,
p207
aVas much as I hate some of the places,
p208
aVsome of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to,
p209
aVin a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.
p210
aVBecause yeah, it's put me in the valleys,
p211
aVbut only to show me there's peaks,
p212
aVand yeah it's dragged me through the dark
p213
aVbut only to remind me there is light.
p214
aVMy pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet,
p215
aVhas given me perspective, and my hurt,
p216
aVmy hurt has forced me to have hope,
p217
aVhave hope and to have faith, faith in myself,
p218
aVfaith in others, faith that it can get better,
p219
aVthat we can change this, that we can speak up
p220
aVand speak out and fight back against ignorance,
p221
aVfight back against intolerance,
p222
aVand more than anything,
p223
aVlearn to love ourselves,
p224
aVlearn to accept ourselves for who we are,
p225
aVthe people we are, not the people the world wants us to be.
p226
aVBecause the world I believe in is one
p227
aVwhere embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.
p228
aVThe world I believe in is one where we're measured
p229
aVby our ability to overcome adversities, not avoid them.
p230
aVThe world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye
p231
aVand say, "I'm going through hell,"
p232
aVand they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay,
p233
aVand it's okay because depression is okay. We're people.
p234
aVWe're people, and we struggle and we suffer
p235
aVand we bleed and we cry, and if you think that true strength
p236
aVmeans never showing any weakness, then I'm here
p237
aVto tell you you're wrong.
p238
aVYou're wrong, because it's the opposite.
p239
aVWe're people, and we have problems.
p240
aVWe're not perfect, and that's okay.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo we need to stop the ignorance,
p243
aVstop the intolerance, stop the stigma,
p244
aVand stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos,
p245
aVtake a look at the truth, and start talking,
p246
aVbecause the only way we're going to beat a problem
p247
aVthat people are battling alone
p248
aVis by standing strong together,
p249
aVby standing strong together.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd I believe that we can.
p252
aVI believe that we can. Thank you guys so much.
p253
aVThis is a dream come true. Thank you. (Applause)
p254
aVThank you. (Applause)

VOn my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot
p5
aVthat I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of pottery
p6
aVthat began in Japan centuries ago as a way of
p7
aVmaking bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.
p8
aVThis one is more than 400 years old.
p9
aVEach one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay,
p10
aVand it was the imperfections that people cherished.
p11
aa(lp12
VEveryday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.
p13
aVI just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself
p14
aVtakes another day or two to cool down, but raku
p15
aVis really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln
p16
aVup to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees,
p17
aVand as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside,
p18
aVyou can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off,
p19
aVand you reach in with these long metal tongs,
p20
aVyou grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot
p21
aVwould be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea,
p22
aVand you can imagine what that steam would smell like.
p23
aVBut here in the United States, we ramp up the drama
p24
aVa little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust,
p25
aVwhich catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail,
p26
aVand you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.
p27
aVI would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.
p28
aa(lp29
VI love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.
p30
aVI can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze,
p31
aVbut then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke,
p32
aVand what's wonderful is the surprises that happen,
p33
aVlike this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful
p34
aVon these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees
p35
aVto room temperature in the space of just a minute.
p36
aa(lp37
VRaku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity.
p38
aVI find in so many things that tension between
p39
aVwhat I can control and what I have to let go
p40
aVhappens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio show
p41
aVor just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.
p42
aa(lp43
VWhen I sat down to write a book about creativity,
p44
aVI realized that the steps were reversed.
p45
aVI had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to
p46
aVimmerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists
p47
aVand writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened
p48
aVto these stories, I realized that creativity
p49
aVgrows out of everyday experiences
p50
aVmore often than you might think, including
p51
aVletting go.
p52
aVIt was supposed to break, but that's okay. (Laughter) (Laughs)
p53
aVThat's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens
p54
aVand sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also grows
p55
aVfrom the broken places.
p56
aa(lp57
VThe best way to learn about anything
p58
aVis through stories, and so I want to tell you a story
p59
aVabout work and play and about four aspects of life
p60
aVthat we need to embrace
p61
aVin order for our own creativity to flourish.
p62
aVThe first embrace is something that we think,
p63
aV"Oh, this is very easy," but it's actually getting harder,
p64
aVand that's paying attention to the world around us.
p65
aVSo many artists speak about needing to be open,
p66
aVto embrace experience, and that's hard to do when
p67
aVyou have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that
p68
aVtakes all of your focus.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up
p71
aVin a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar,
p72
aVand here's a picture of one of the temples in her town.
p73
aa(lp74
VMira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples.
p75
aVWe played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up
p76
aVin the rubble. The major thing that inspired me,
p77
aVthat led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually,
p78
aVwas traveling folk theater that would come through the town
p79
aVand I would go off and see these great battles
p80
aVof good and evil by two people in a school field
p81
aVwith no props but with a lot of, you know,
p82
aVpassion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.
p83
aVYou know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana,
p84
aVthe two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of
p85
aVin India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater,
p86
aVI knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.
p87
aa(lp88
VJulie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story?
p89
aVYou can see the sort of break in the everyday.
p90
aVThere they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil,
p91
aVand passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl
p92
aVwith thousands of other people watching this performance,
p93
aVbut she was ready. She was ready to open up
p94
aVto what it sparked in her, and it led her,
p95
aVas she said, down this path to become
p96
aVan award-winning filmmaker.
p97
aVSo being open for that experience that might change you
p98
aVis the first thing we need to embrace.
p99
aa(lp100
VArtists also speak about how some of their most powerful work
p101
aVcomes out of the parts of life that are most difficult.
p102
aVThe novelist Richard Ford speaks about
p103
aVa childhood challenge that continues to be something
p104
aVhe wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic.
p105
aa(lp106
VRichard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the way
p107
aVthrough school not really reading more than the minimum,
p108
aVand still to this day can't read silently
p109
aVmuch faster than I can read aloud,
p110
aVbut there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me
p111
aVbecause when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow
p112
aVI was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowly
p113
aVinto an appreciation of all of those qualities of language
p114
aVand of sentences that are not just the cognitive
p115
aVaspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words,
p116
aVwhat words look like, where paragraphs break,
p117
aVwhere lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic that
p118
aVI was disabled from reading. I just had to do it
p119
aVreally slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences
p120
aVas I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities,
p121
aVwhich I think has helped me write sentences.
p122
aa(lp123
VJB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize,
p124
aVsays that dyslexia helped him write sentences.
p125
aVHe had to embrace this challenge, and I use that word
p126
aVintentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia.
p127
aVHe had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music
p128
aVin language.
p129
aa(lp130
VArtists also speak about how pushing up against
p131
aVthe limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing
p132
aVinto what they can't do, helps them focus
p133
aVon finding their own voice.
p134
aVThe sculptor Richard Serra talks about how,
p135
aVas a young artist, he thought he was a painter,
p136
aVand he lived in Florence after graduate school.
p137
aVWhile he was there, he traveled to Madrid,
p138
aVwhere he went to the Prado to see this picture
p139
aVby the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.
p140
aVIt's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas,"
p141
aVand it's the picture of a little princess
p142
aVand her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over
p143
aVthat little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror,
p144
aVand reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen
p145
aVof Spain, who would be standing where you might stand
p146
aVto look at the picture.
p147
aVAs he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.
p148
aVHe's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand
p149
aVand his palette in the other.
p150
aa(lp151
VRichard Serra: I was standing there looking at it,
p152
aVand I realized that Velázquez was looking at me,
p153
aVand I thought, "Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."
p154
aVAnd I thought, "I'm not going to be able to do that painting."
p155
aVI was to the point where I was using a stopwatch
p156
aVand painting squares out of randomness,
p157
aVand I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped
p158
aVall my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I'm going to just start playing around.
p159
aa(lp160
VJB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might
p161
aVhave missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy
p162
aVwho'd been dead for 300 years, and realized,
p163
aV"I can't do that," and so Richard Serra went back
p164
aVto his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work
p165
aVup to that point, and threw it in a river.
p166
aVRichard Serra let go of painting at that moment,
p167
aVbut he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City,
p168
aVand he put together a list of verbs
p169
aV\u2014 to roll, to crease, to fold \u2014
p170
aVmore than a hundred of them, and as he said,
p171
aVhe just started playing around. He did these things
p172
aVto all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead
p173
aVand roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing
p174
aVto rubber, and when he got to the direction "to lift,"
p175
aVhe created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art.
p176
aVRichard Serra had to let go of painting
p177
aVin order to embark on this playful exploration
p178
aVthat led him to the work that he's known for today:
p179
aVhuge curves of steel that require our time and motion
p180
aVto experience. In sculpture,
p181
aVRichard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting.
p182
aVHe makes us the subject of his art.
p183
aVSo experience and challenge
p184
aVand limitations are all things we need to embrace
p185
aVfor creativity to flourish.
p186
aa(lp187
VThere's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest.
p188
aVIt's the embrace of loss,
p189
aVthe oldest and most constant of human experiences.
p190
aVIn order to create, we have to stand in that space
p191
aVbetween what we see in the world and what we hope for,
p192
aVlooking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak,
p193
aVat war, at death.
p194
aVThat's a tough space to stand in.
p195
aVThe educator Parker Palmer calls it "the tragic gap,"
p196
aVtragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable,
p197
aVand my friend Dick Nodel likes to say,
p198
aV"You can hold that tension like a violin string
p199
aVand make something beautiful."
p200
aa(lp201
VThat tension resonates in the work of the photographer
p202
aVJoel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career was
p203
aVknown for his street photography, for capturing a moment
p204
aVon the street, and also for his beautiful photographs
p205
aVof landscapes \u2014 of Tuscany, of Cape Cod,
p206
aVof light.
p207
aVJoel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years
p208
aVwas in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown
p209
aVto the World Trade Center, and he photographed
p210
aVthose buildings in every sort of light.
p211
aVYou know where this story goes.
p212
aVOn 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town,
p213
aVbut he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site
p214
aVof the destruction.
p215
aa(lp216
VJoel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby,
p217
aVI stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers
p218
aVand Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke
p219
aVand a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera
p220
aVto take a peek, just to see if there was something to see,
p221
aVand some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder,
p222
aVand said, "Hey, no pictures!"
p223
aVAnd it was such a blow that it woke me up,
p224
aVin the way that it was meant to be, I guess.
p225
aVAnd when I asked her why no pictures, she said,
p226
aV"It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed."
p227
aVAnd I asked her, "What would happen if I was a member
p228
aVof the press?" And she told me,
p229
aV"Oh, look back there," and back a block was the press corps
p230
aVtied up in a little penned-in area,
p231
aVand I said, "Well, when do they go in?"
p232
aVand she said, "Probably never."
p233
aVAnd as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization,
p234
aVprobably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way.
p235
aVI thought, "Oh, if there's no pictures,
p236
aVthen there'll be no record. We need a record."
p237
aVAnd I thought, "I'm gonna make that record.
p238
aVI'll find a way to get in, because I don't want to
p239
aVsee this history disappear."
p240
aa(lp241
VJB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could,
p242
aVand got a pass into the World Trade Center site,
p243
aVwhere he photographed for nine months almost every day.
p244
aVLooking at these photographs today brings back
p245
aVthe smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes
p246
aVwhen I went home to my family at night.
p247
aVMy office was just a few blocks away.
p248
aVBut some of these photographs are beautiful,
p249
aVand we wondered, was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz
p250
aVto make such beauty out of such devastation?
p251
aa(lp252
VJM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful
p253
aVand tragic and horrific and everything, but
p254
aVit was also as, in nature, an enormous event
p255
aVthat was transformed after the fact into this residue,
p256
aVand like many other ruins
p257
aV\u2014 you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace \u2014
p258
aVand they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.
p259
aVI mean, there were afternoons I was down there,
p260
aVand the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air
p261
aVand you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself
p262
aVrecognizing both the inherent beauty of nature
p263
aVand the fact that nature, as time,
p264
aVis erasing this wound.
p265
aVTime is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.
p266
aVIt gets further and further away from the day,
p267
aVand light and seasons temper it in some way,
p268
aVand it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist.
p269
aVThe reality is, there's the Woolworth Building
p270
aVin a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrim
p271
aVacross a theater, and it's turning pink,
p272
aVyou know, and down below there are hoses spraying,
p273
aVand the lights have come on for the evening, and the water
p274
aVis turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on,
p275
aVand I'm thinking, "My God, who could dream this up?"
p276
aVBut the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that,
p277
aVyou have to take a picture.
p278
aa(lp279
VJB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency,
p280
aVof the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story.
p281
aVWhen I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently, I told him how much
p282
aVI admired his passionate obstinacy, his determination
p283
aVto push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work,
p284
aVand he laughed, and he said, "I'm stubborn,
p285
aVbut I think what's more important
p286
aVis my passionate optimism."
p287
aa(lp288
VThe first time I told these stories, a man in the audience
p289
aVraised his hand and said, "All these artists talk about
p290
aVtheir work, not their art, which has got me thinking about
p291
aVmy work and where the creativity is there,
p292
aVand I'm not an artist." He's right. We all wrestle
p293
aVwith experience and challenge, limits and loss.
p294
aVCreativity is essential to all of us,
p295
aVwhether we're scientists or teachers,
p296
aVparents or entrepreneurs.
p297
aa(lp298
VI want to leave you with another
p299
aVimage of a Japanese tea bowl. This one
p300
aVis at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.
p301
aVIt's more than a hundred years old and you can still see
p302
aVthe fingermarks where the potter pinched it.
p303
aVBut as you can also see, this one did break
p304
aVat some point in its hundred years.
p305
aVBut the person who put it back together,
p306
aVinstead of hiding the cracks,
p307
aVdecided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.
p308
aVThis bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken,
p309
aVthan it was when it was first made,
p310
aVand we can look at those cracks, because
p311
aVthey tell the story that we all live,
p312
aVof the cycle of creation and destruction,
p313
aVof control and letting go, of picking up the pieces
p314
aVand making something new.
p315
aVThank you. (Applause)

VI had a fire nine days ago.
p5
aVMy archive:
p6
aV175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,
p7
aVall my books, my dad's books, my photographs.
p8
aVI'd collected \u2014
p9
aVI was a collector, major, big-time.
p10
aVIt's gone.
p11
aVI just looked at it,
p12
aVand I didn't know what to do.
p13
aVI mean, this was \u2014
p14
aVwas I my things?
p15
aVI always live in the present \u2014 I love the present.
p16
aa(lp17
VI cherish the future.
p18
aVAnd I was taught some strange thing as a kid,
p19
aVlike, you've got to make something good out of something bad.
p20
aVYou've got to make something good out of something bad.
p21
aVThis was bad! Man, I was \u2014
p22
aVI cough. I was sick.
p23
aVThat's my camera lens. The first one \u2014
p24
aVthe one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago.
p25
aVThat's my feature film. "King, Murray"
p26
aVwon Cannes Film Festival 1970 \u2014
p27
aVthe only print I had.
p28
aVThat's my papers.
p29
aa(lp30
VThat was in minutes \u2014 20 minutes.
p31
aVEpiphany hit me. Something hit me.
p32
aV"You've got to make something good out of something bad,"
p33
aVI started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.
p34
aVBy the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.
p35
aV"Sputnik" was downtown, the negative. It wasn't touched.
p36
aVThese are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film,
p37
aVwhich opens in New York in two weeks
p38
aVdowntown.
p39
aVI called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig."
p40
aVThat's me at my desk.
p41
aVThat was a desk took 40-some years to build.
p42
aVYou know \u2014 all the stuff.
p43
aVThat's my daughter, Jean.
p44
aVShe came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.
p45
aa(lp46
V"Dig it up," I said. "Pieces.
p47
aVI want pieces. Bits and pieces."
p48
aVI came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces,
p49
aVwhich I'm just starting to work on \u2014 my next project.
p50
aVThat's my sister. She took care of pictures,
p51
aVbecause I was a big collector of snapshot photography
p52
aVthat I believed said a lot.
p53
aVAnd those are some of the pictures that \u2014
p54
aVsomething was good about the burnt pictures.
p55
aVI didn't know. I looked at that \u2014
p56
aVI said, "Wow, is that better than the \u2014"
p57
aVThat's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television.
p58
aVIt's the only copy I had. Pieces of it.
p59
aVIdea about women.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo I started to say, "Hey, man, you are too much!
p62
aVYou could cry about this." I really didn't.
p63
aVI just instead said,
p64
aV"I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... "
p65
aVAnd I appreciate this moment
p66
aVto come up on this stage with so many people
p67
aVwho've already given me so much solace,
p68
aVand just say to TEDsters:
p69
aVI'm proud of me. That I take something bad,
p70
aVI turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this,
p71
aVall these pieces.
p72
aVThat's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.
p73
aVI was a big record collector \u2014
p74
aVthe records didn't make it. Boy, I tell you,
p75
aVfilm burns. Film burns.
p76
aVI mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.
p77
aVThe negatives are gone.
p78
aa(lp79
VThat's my father's letter to me, telling me to
p80
aVmarry the woman I first married when I was 20.
p81
aVThat's my daughter and me.
p82
aVShe's still there. She's there this morning, actually.
p83
aVThat's my house.
p84
aVMy family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.
p85
aVThat's my wife, Heidi,
p86
aVwho didn't take it as well as I did.
p87
aVMy children, Davey and Henry.
p88
aVMy son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo, my message to you folks,
p91
aVfrom my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance
p92
aVto share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED.
p93
aVI came to live it, and I am living it.
p94
aVThat's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon,
p95
aVjust 35 miles from here.
p96
aVThank you everybody.

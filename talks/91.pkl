VI want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin,
p5
aVfrom when I was 12 years old.
p6
aVMy uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater \u2014
p7
aVat least I thought it was beautiful.
p8
aVAnd it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach,
p9
aVand Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of
p10
aVright across the chest, that were also fuzzy.
p11
aVAnd I wore it whenever I could,
p12
aVthinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.
p13
aa(lp14
VUntil one day in ninth grade,
p15
aVwhen I was standing with a number of the football players.
p16
aVAnd my body had clearly changed, and Matt,
p17
aVwho was undeniably my nemesis in high school,
p18
aVsaid in a booming voice that
p19
aVwe no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips,
p20
aVbut we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVAnd I was so humiliated and mortified
p23
aVthat I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her
p24
aVfor ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.
p25
aVWe drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away
p26
aVsomewhat ceremoniously,
p27
aVmy idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater
p28
aVnor see it ever again.
p29
aa(lp30
VFast forward \u2014 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid.
p31
aVI'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes,
p32
aVwhen I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy \u2014 11 years old \u2014
p33
aVrunning toward me, wearing my sweater.
p34
aVAnd I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.
p35
aVBut so, curious, I run up to the child \u2014 of course
p36
aVscaring the living bejesus out of him \u2014
p37
aVgrab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name
p38
aVwritten on the collar of this sweater.
p39
aa(lp40
VI tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve
p41
aVas a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness
p42
aVthat we all have on this Earth.
p43
aVWe so often don't realize what our action and our inaction
p44
aVdoes to people we think we will never see and never know.
p45
aVI also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story
p46
aVof what aid is and can be.
p47
aVThat this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia,
p48
aVand moved its way into the larger industry,
p49
aVwhich at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia.
p50
aVWhich was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.
p51
aVAnd at the same time, certainly in Rwanda,
p52
aVit destroyed the local retailing industry.
p53
aVNot to say that it shouldn't have,
p54
aVbut that we have to get better at answering the questions
p55
aVthat need to be considered when we think about consequences
p56
aVand responses.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986,
p59
aVwhere I was doing two things.
p60
aVI had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.
p61
aVWe were called the "Bad News Bears," and our notion was
p62
aVwe were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali,
p63
aVwhich was not hard because there were no snacks before us.
p64
aVAnd because we had a good business model, we actually did it,
p65
aVand I watched these women transform on a micro-level.
p66
aVBut at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank,
p67
aVand tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen,
p68
aVwhich is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks,
p69
aVwhich now is a worldwide movement \u2014 you talk about a meme \u2014
p70
aVbut then it was quite new, especially in an economy
p71
aVthat was moving from barter into trade.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe got a lot of things right.
p74
aVWe focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.
p75
aVThe women made their own decisions at the end of the day
p76
aVas to how they would use this access to credit
p77
aVto build their little businesses, earn more income
p78
aVso they could take care of their families better.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhat we didn't understand, what was happening all around us,
p81
aVwith the confluence of fear, ethnic strife
p82
aVand certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into
p83
aVthis invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda,
p84
aVthat at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.
p85
aVThe genocide happened in 1994,
p86
aVseven years after these women all worked together
p87
aVto build this dream.
p88
aVAnd the good news was that the institution,
p89
aVthe banking institution, lasted.
p90
aVIn fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.
p91
aVThe bakery was completely wiped out,
p92
aVbut the lessons for me were that accountability counts \u2014
p93
aVgot to build things with people on the ground,
p94
aVusing business models where, as Steven Levitt would say,
p95
aVthe incentives matter.
p96
aVUnderstand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything
p99
aVthat was happening in the world,
p100
aVthat we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist,
p101
aVon the one hand I absolutely agree with him,
p102
aVand I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 \u2014
p103
aVthat the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono
p104
aVand Bob Geldof \u2014 the world is talking about global poverty;
p105
aVthe world is talking about Africa
p106
aVin ways I have never seen in my life.
p107
aVIt's thrilling.
p108
aVAnd at the same time, what keeps me up at night
p109
aVis a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 \u2014
p110
aV50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa,
p111
aV40 billion in reduced debt \u2014 as the victory,
p112
aVas more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one,
p115
aVcelebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two
p116
aVthat is all about execution, all about the how-to.
p117
aVAnd if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,
p118
aVit's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,
p119
aVis to build viable systems on the ground
p120
aVthat deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor,
p121
aVin ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.
p122
aVIf we do that, we really can make poverty history.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd it was that \u2014 that whole philosophy \u2014
p125
aVthat encouraged me to start my current endeavor
p126
aVcalled "Acumen Fund,"
p127
aVwhich is trying to build some mini-blueprints
p128
aVfor how we might do that in water, health and housing
p129
aVin Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.
p130
aVAnd I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples,
p131
aVso you can see what it is that we're doing.
p132
aVBut before I do this \u2014 and this is another one of my pet peeves \u2014
p133
aVI want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.
p134
aVBecause we too often talk about them as these
p135
aVstrong, huge masses of people yearning to be free,
p136
aVwhen in fact, it's quite an amazing story.
p137
aVOn a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.
p138
aa(lp139
VThat's who we talk about when we think about "the poor."
p140
aVIf you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth,
p141
aVand yet most of these people go invisible.
p142
aVWhere we typically work, there's people making between
p143
aVone and three dollars a day.
p144
aVWho are these people?
p145
aVThey are farmers and factory workers.
p146
aVThey work in government offices. They're drivers.
p147
aVThey are domestics.
p148
aVThey typically pay for critical goods and services like water,
p149
aVlike healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times
p150
aVwhat their middleclass counterparts pay \u2014
p151
aVcertainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.
p152
aVThe poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions,
p153
aVif you give them that opportunity.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo, two examples.
p156
aVOne is in India, where there are 240 million farmers,
p157
aVmost of whom make less than two dollars a day.
p158
aVWhere we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.
p159
aVYou see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.
p160
aVThis guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.
p161
aVWhat he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches,
p162
aVand figure out how to do a drip irrigation,
p163
aVwhich is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.
p164
aVBut previously it's only been created for large-scale farms,
p165
aVso Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.
p166
aVA couple of principles:
p167
aVbuild small.
p168
aVMake it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.
p169
aa(lp170
VThis family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit
p171
aVwhen they were living in a \u2014 literally a three-walled lean-to
p172
aVwith a corrugated iron roof.
p173
aVAfter one harvest, they had increased their income enough
p174
aVto buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.
p175
aVA couple of years later, I meet them.
p176
aVThey now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India,
p177
aVand they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid
p178
aVto build their house.
p179
aVAnd I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.
p180
aVSomething I truly believe.
p181
aa(lp182
VYou can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets,
p183
aVand I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard
p184
aVhuge kudos for bringing to the world
p185
aVthis notion of his rage \u2014 for five dollars you can save a life.
p186
aVMalaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.
p187
aV300 to 500 million cases are reported.
p188
aVIt's estimated that Africa loses
p189
aVabout 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.
p190
aVFive dollars can save a life.
p191
aVWe can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars \u2014
p192
aVwhy can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?
p193
aa(lp194
VThe question, though, is not "Why can't we?"
p195
aVThe question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?
p196
aVA lot of hurdles.
p197
aVOne: production is too low. Two: price is too high.
p198
aVThree: this is a good road in \u2014 right near where our factory is located.
p199
aVDistribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.
p200
aVWe started by making a 350,000-dollar loan
p201
aVto the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa
p202
aVso that they could transfer technology from Japan
p203
aVand build these long-lasting, five-year nets.
p204
aVHere are just some pictures of the factory.
p205
aa(lp206
VToday, three years later, the company has employed
p207
aVanother thousand women.
p208
aVIt contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.
p209
aVIt's the largest company in Tanzania.
p210
aVThe throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets,
p211
aVthree million by the end of the year.
p212
aVWe hope to have seven million at the end of next year.
p213
aVSo the production side is working.
p214
aVOn the distribution side, though,
p215
aVas a world, we have a lot of work to do.
p216
aVRight now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.,
p217
aVand then given primarily to people around Africa.
p218
aVWe're looking at building
p219
aVon some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.
p220
aVTheir women.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd so I want you to meet Jacqueline,
p223
aVmy namesake, 21 years old.
p224
aVIf she were born anywhere else but Tanzania,
p225
aVI'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.
p226
aVShe runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money
p227
aVto put a down payment on her house.
p228
aVShe makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund,
p229
aVand told me she is not marrying nor having children
p230
aVuntil these things are completed.
p231
aVAnd so, when I told her about our idea \u2014
p232
aVthat maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,
p233
aVand find a way for the women themselves to go out
p234
aVand sell these nets to others \u2014
p235
aVshe quickly started calculating what she herself could make
p236
aVand signed up.
p237
aa(lp238
VWe took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies,
p239
aVand quickly did a prototyping on this,
p240
aVand took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.
p241
aVShe brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts
p242
aVtogether to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,
p243
aVdespite the fact that people say nobody will buy one,
p244
aVand we learned a lot about how you sell things.
p245
aVNot coming in with our own notions,
p246
aVbecause she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.
p247
aVFirst, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.
p248
aVThese nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.
p249
aVChildren can sleep through the night;
p250
aVthe house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.
p251
aVAnd we've started making curtains,
p252
aVand not only is it beautiful, but people can see status \u2014
p253
aVthat you care about your children.
p254
aVOnly then did she talk about saving your children's lives.
p255
aVA lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell
p256
aVgoods and services to the poor.
p257
aa(lp258
VI want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity
p259
aVto make poverty history.
p260
aVTo do it right, we have to build business models that matter,
p261
aVthat are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,
p262
aVpeople all over the developing world
p263
aVwho fit in this category, to do it themselves.
p264
aVBecause at the end of the day, it's about engagement.
p265
aVIt's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,
p266
aVthat they want to make their own decisions;
p267
aVthey want to solve their own problems;
p268
aVand that by engaging with them,
p269
aVnot only do we create much more dignity for them,
p270
aVbut for us as well.
p271
aVAnd so I urge all of you to think next time
p272
aVas to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity
p273
aVthat we all have \u2014 to make poverty history \u2014
p274
aVby really becoming part of the process
p275
aVand moving away from an us-and-them world,
p276
aVand realizing that it's about all of us,
p277
aVand the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.
p278
aVThank you.
p279
aV(Applause)

So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>", "slug": "jacqueline_novogratz", "whotheyare": "Jacqueline Novogratz works to enable human flourishing.

</p><p>&quot;I started my career on Wall Street and soon discovered that markets are efficient, but by themselves they too often overlook or exploit the poor.  So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>", "slug": "jacqueline_novogratz", "whotheyare": "Jacqueline Novogratz works to enable human flourishing.

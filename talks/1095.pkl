VI want to ask you all to consider for a second
p5
aVthe very simple fact
p6
aVthat, by far,
p7
aVmost of what we know about the universe
p8
aVcomes to us from light.
p9
aVWe can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky
p10
aVand see stars with our bare eyes.
p11
aVThe Sun burns our peripheral vision.
p12
aVWe see light reflected off the Moon.
p13
aVAnd in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope
p14
aVat the celestial bodies,
p15
aVthe known universe has come to us through light,
p16
aVacross vast eras in cosmic history.
p17
aVAnd with all of our modern telescopes,
p18
aVwe've been able to collect
p19
aVthis stunning silent movie of the universe \u2014
p20
aVthese series of snapshots
p21
aVthat go all the way back to the Big Bang.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd yet, the universe is not a silent movie
p24
aVbecause the universe isn't silent.
p25
aVI'd like to convince you
p26
aVthat the universe has a soundtrack
p27
aVand that soundtrack is played on space itself,
p28
aVbecause space can wobble like a drum.
p29
aVIt can ring out a kind of recording
p30
aVthroughout the universe
p31
aVof some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.
p32
aVNow we'd like to be able to add
p33
aVto a kind of glorious visual composition
p34
aVthat we have of the universe \u2014
p35
aVa sonic composition.
p36
aVAnd while we've never heard the sounds from space,
p37
aVwe really should, in the next few years,
p38
aVstart to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo in this ambition
p41
aVto capture songs from the universe,
p42
aVwe turn our focus
p43
aVto black holes and the promise they have,
p44
aVbecause black holes can bang on space-time
p45
aVlike mallets on a drum
p46
aVand have a very characteristic song,
p47
aVwhich I'd like to play for you \u2014 some of our predictions
p48
aVfor what that song will be like.
p49
aVNow black holes are dark against a dark sky.
p50
aVWe can't see them directly.
p51
aVThey're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.
p52
aVWe can see them indirectly,
p53
aVbecause black holes wreak havoc on their environment.
p54
aVThey destroy stars around them.
p55
aVThey churn up debris in their surroundings.
p56
aVBut they won't come to us directly through light.
p57
aVWe might one day see a shadow
p58
aVa black hole can cast on a very bright background,
p59
aVbut we haven't yet.
p60
aVAnd yet black holes may be heard
p61
aVeven if they're not seen,
p62
aVand that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum
p65
aVto Albert Einstein \u2014 to whom we owe so much.
p66
aVEinstein realized that if space were empty,
p67
aVif the universe were empty,
p68
aVit would be like this picture,
p69
aVexcept for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
p70
aVBut if we were freely falling through the space,
p71
aVeven without this helpful grid,
p72
aVwe might be able to paint it ourselves,
p73
aVbecause we would notice that we traveled along straight lines,
p74
aVundeflected straight paths
p75
aVthrough the universe.
p76
aVEinstein also realized \u2014
p77
aVand this is the real meat of the matter \u2014
p78
aVthat if you put energy or mass in the universe,
p79
aVit would curve space,
p80
aVand a freely falling object
p81
aVwould pass by, let's say, the Sun
p82
aVand it would be deflected
p83
aValong the natural curves in the space.
p84
aVIt was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
p85
aVNow even light will be bent by those paths.
p86
aVAnd you can be bent so much
p87
aVthat you're caught in orbit around the Sun,
p88
aVas the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.
p89
aVThese are the natural curves in space.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhat Einstein did not realize
p92
aVwas that, if you took our Sun
p93
aVand you crushed it down to six kilometers \u2014
p94
aVso you took a million times the mass of the Earth
p95
aVand you crushed it to six kilometers across,
p96
aVyou would make a black hole,
p97
aVan object so dense
p98
aVthat if light veered too close, it would never escape \u2014
p99
aVa dark shadow against the universe.
p100
aVIt wasn't Einstein who realized this,
p101
aVit was Karl Schwarzschild
p102
aVwho was a German Jew in World War I \u2014
p103
aVjoined the German army already an accomplished scientist,
p104
aVworking on the Russian front.
p105
aVI like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches
p106
aVcalculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire,
p107
aVand then, in between,
p108
aVcalculating Einstein's equations \u2014
p109
aVas you do in the trenches.
p110
aVAnd he was reading Einstein's recently published
p111
aVgeneral theory of relativity,
p112
aVand he was thrilled by this theory.
p113
aVAnd he quickly surmised
p114
aVan exact mathematical solution
p115
aVthat described something very extraordinary:
p116
aVcurves so strong
p117
aVthat space would rain down into them,
p118
aVspace itself would curve like a waterfall
p119
aVflowing down the throat of a hole.
p120
aVAnd even light could not escape this current.
p121
aVLight would be dragged down the hole
p122
aVas everything else would be,
p123
aVand all that would be left would be a shadow.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow he wrote to Einstein,
p126
aVand he said, "As you will see,
p127
aVthe war has been kind to me enough.
p128
aVDespite the heavy gunfire,
p129
aVI've been able to get away from it all
p130
aVand walk through the land of your ideas."
p131
aVAnd Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution,
p132
aVand I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.
p133
aVThis is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.
p134
aVAnd he took Schwarzschild's idea
p135
aVto the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.
p136
aVBut Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.
p137
aVHe did not believe they existed in nature.
p138
aVHe thought nature would protect us from their formation.
p139
aVIt was decades
p140
aVbefore the term "black hole" was coined
p141
aVand people realized
p142
aVthat black holes are real astrophysical objects \u2014
p143
aVin fact they're the death state
p144
aVof very massive stars
p145
aVthat collapse catastrophically
p146
aVat the end of their lifetime.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
p149
aVIt's actually not massive enough.
p150
aVBut if we did a little thought experiment \u2014
p151
aVas Einstein was very fond of doing \u2014
p152
aVwe could imagine
p153
aVputting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers,
p154
aVand putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit,
p155
aVmaybe 30 kilometers
p156
aVoutside of the black-hole sun.
p157
aVAnd it would be self-illuminated,
p158
aVbecause now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light \u2014
p159
aVso let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.
p160
aVAnd you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit
p161
aVeven 30 km
p162
aVoutside of this crushed black hole.
p163
aVThis crushed black hole
p164
aVactually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
p165
aVIt might spill off into the Hudson a little bit
p166
aVbefore it destroyed the Earth.
p167
aVBut basically that's what we're talking about.
p168
aVWe're talking about an object that you could crush down
p169
aVto half the square area of Manhattan.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo we move this Earth very close \u2014
p172
aV30 kilometers outside \u2014
p173
aVand we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.
p174
aVThere's a sort of myth
p175
aVthat black holes devour everything in the universe,
p176
aVbut you actually have to get very close to fall in.
p177
aVBut what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point,
p178
aVwe can always see the Earth.
p179
aVIt cannot hide behind the black hole.
p180
aVThe light from the Earth, some of it falls in,
p181
aVbut some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.
p182
aVSo you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
p183
aVIf this were Battlestar Galactica
p184
aVand you're fighting the Cylons,
p185
aVdon't hide behind the black hole.
p186
aVThey can see you.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole \u2014
p189
aVit's not massive enough \u2014
p190
aVbut there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
p191
aVAnd if one were to eclipse the Milky Way,
p192
aVthis is what it would look like.
p193
aVWe would see a shadow of that black hole
p194
aVagainst the hundred billion stars
p195
aVin the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
p196
aVAnd if we were to fall towards this black hole,
p197
aVwe would see all of that light lensed around it,
p198
aVand we could even start to cross into that shadow
p199
aVand really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
p200
aVIt would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there
p201
aVbecause we couldn't,
p202
aVanymore than light can escape.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut even though the black hole is dark from the outside,
p205
aVit's not dark on the inside,
p206
aVbecause all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
p207
aVAnd even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation,
p208
aVour clocks would seem to slow down
p209
aVrelative to galactic time,
p210
aVit would look as though the evolution of the galaxy
p211
aVhad been sped up and shot at us,
p212
aVright before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
p213
aVIt would be like a near-death experience
p214
aVwhere you see the light at the end of the tunnel,
p215
aVbut it's a total death experience.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aVAnd there's no way of telling anybody
p218
aVabout the light at the end of the tunnel.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole,
p221
aVbut black holes can be heard,
p222
aVeven if they're not seen.
p223
aVImagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation \u2014
p224
aVimagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
p225
aVMaybe they started as stars
p226
aVand collapsed to two black holes \u2014
p227
aVeach one 10 times the mass of the Sun.
p228
aVSo now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.
p229
aVThey can be spinning
p230
aVhundreds of times a second.
p231
aVAt the end of their lives,
p232
aVthey're going around each other very near the speed of light.
p233
aVSo they're crossing thousands of kilometers
p234
aVin a fraction of a second,
p235
aVand as they do so, they not only curve space,
p236
aVbut they leave behind in their wake
p237
aVa ringing of space,
p238
aVan actual wave on space-time.
p239
aVSpace squeezes and stretches
p240
aVas it emanates out from these black holes
p241
aVbanging on the universe.
p242
aVAnd they travel out into the cosmos
p243
aVat the speed of light.
p244
aa(lp245
VThis computer simulation
p246
aVis due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.
p247
aVIt took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.
p248
aVThis was one of the groups.
p249
aVIt shows two black holes in orbit around each other,
p250
aVagain, with these helpfully painted curves.
p251
aVAnd if you can see \u2014 it's kind of faint \u2014
p252
aVbut if you can see the red waves emanating out,
p253
aVthose are the gravitational waves.
p254
aVThey're literally the sounds of space ringing,
p255
aVand they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light
p256
aVas they ring down and coalesce
p257
aVto one spinning, quiet black hole
p258
aVat the end of the day.
p259
aVIf you were standing near enough,
p260
aVyour ear would resonate
p261
aVwith the squeezing and stretching of space.
p262
aVYou would literally hear the sound.
p263
aVNow of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully,
p264
aVso you might have trouble understanding what's going on.
p265
aVBut I'd like to play for you
p266
aVthe sound that we predict.
p267
aa(lp268
VThis is from my group \u2014
p269
aVa slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
p270
aVImagine a lighter black hole
p271
aVfalling into a very heavy black hole.
p272
aVThe sound you're hearing
p273
aVis the light black hole banging on space
p274
aVeach time it gets close.
p275
aVIf it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
p276
aVBut it comes in like a mallet,
p277
aVand it literally cracks space,
p278
aVwobbling it like a drum.
p279
aVAnd we can predict what the sound will be.
p280
aVWe know that, as it falls in,
p281
aVit gets faster and it gets louder.
p282
aVAnd eventually,
p283
aVwe're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
p284
aV(Thumping)
p285
aVThen it's gone.
p286
aVNow I've never heard it that loud \u2014 it's actually more dramatic.
p287
aVAt home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
p288
aVIt's sort of like ding, ding, ding.
p289
aa(lp290
VThis is another sound from my group.
p291
aVNo, I'm not showing you any images,
p292
aVbecause black holes don't leave behind
p293
aVhelpful trails of ink,
p294
aVand space is not painted,
p295
aVshowing you the curves.
p296
aVBut if you were to float by in space on a space holiday
p297
aVand you heard this,
p298
aVyou want to get moving.
p299
aV(Laughter)
p300
aVWant to get away from the sound.
p301
aVBoth black holes are moving.
p302
aVBoth black holes are getting closer together.
p303
aVIn this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.
p304
aVAnd then they're going to merge.
p305
aV(Thumping)
p306
aVNow it's gone.
p307
aVNow that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging \u2014
p308
aVthat it chirps up at the end.
p309
aVNow that's our prediction
p310
aVfor what we'll see.
p311
aa(lp312
VLuckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.
p313
aVAnd surely, somewhere in the universe
p314
aVtwo black holes have merged.
p315
aVAnd surely, the space around us
p316
aVis ringing
p317
aVafter traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years,
p318
aVat the speed of light to get to us.
p319
aVBut the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.
p320
aVThere are very industrious experiments being built on Earth \u2014
p321
aVone called LIGO \u2014
p322
aVwhich will detect deviations
p323
aVin the squeezing and stretching of space
p324
aVat less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom
p325
aVover four kilometers.
p326
aVIt's a remarkably ambitious experiment,
p327
aVand it's going to be at advanced sensitivity
p328
aVwithin the next few years \u2014 to pick this up.
p329
aVThere's also a mission proposed for space,
p330
aVwhich hopefully will launch in the next ten years,
p331
aVcalled LISA.
p332
aVAnd LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes \u2014
p333
aVblack holes millions or billions of times
p334
aVthe mass of the Sun.
p335
aa(lp336
VIn this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.
p337
aVThey look like they're frozen in some embrace.
p338
aVAnd each one probably harbors
p339
aVa super-massive black hole at its core.
p340
aVBut they're not frozen;
p341
aVthey're actually merging.
p342
aVThese two black holes are colliding,
p343
aVand they will merge over a billion-year time scale.
p344
aVIt's beyond our human perception
p345
aVto pick up a song of that duration.
p346
aVBut LISA could see the final stages
p347
aVof two super-massive black holes
p348
aVearlier in the universe's history,
p349
aVthe last 15 minutes before they fall together.
p350
aVAnd it's not just black holes,
p351
aVbut it's also any big disturbance in the universe \u2014
p352
aVand the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
p353
aVWhen that expression was coined, it was derisive \u2014
p354
aVlike, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"
p355
aVBut now it actually might be more technically accurate
p356
aVbecause it might bang.
p357
aVIt might make a sound.
p358
aa(lp359
VThis animation from my friends at Proton Studios
p360
aVshows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
p361
aVWe don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe
p362
aVbecause there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.
p363
aVSo imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
p364
aVIt's everywhere, it's all around you,
p365
aVand the space is wobbling chaotically.
p366
aVFourteen billion years pass
p367
aVand this song is still ringing all around us.
p368
aVGalaxies form,
p369
aVand generations of stars form in those galaxies,
p370
aVand around one star,
p371
aVat least one star,
p372
aVis a habitable planet.
p373
aVAnd here we are frantically building these experiments,
p374
aVdoing these calculations, writing these computer codes.
p375
aa(lp376
VImagine a billion years ago,
p377
aVtwo black holes collided.
p378
aVThat song has been ringing through space
p379
aVfor all that time.
p380
aVWe weren't even here.
p381
aVIt gets closer and closer \u2014
p382
aV40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.
p383
aVIt's like hurry, build your instruments.
p384
aVIt's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...
p385
aVwhatever year it will be
p386
aVwhen our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity \u2014
p387
aVwe'll build them, we'll turn on the machines
p388
aVand, bang, we'll catch it \u2014 the first song from space.
p389
aVIf it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up,
p390
aVit would sound like this.
p391
aV(Static) It's a terrible sound.
p392
aVIt's literally the definition of noise.
p393
aVIt's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.
p394
aVBut it's around us everywhere, presumably,
p395
aVif it hasn't been wiped out
p396
aVby some other process in the universe.
p397
aVAnd if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears
p398
aVbecause it will be the quiet echo
p399
aVof that moment of our creation,
p400
aVof our observable universe.
p401
aa(lp402
VSo within the next few years,
p403
aVwe'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit,
p404
aVrender the universe in audio.
p405
aVBut if we detect those earliest moments,
p406
aVit'll bring us that much closer
p407
aVto an understanding of the Big Bang,
p408
aVwhich brings us that much closer
p409
aVto asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.
p410
aVIf we run the movie of our universe backwards,
p411
aVwe know that there was a Big Bang in our past,
p412
aVand we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it,
p413
aVbut was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
p414
aVI mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
p415
aVWill it happen again?
p416
aVI mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge
p417
aVto reignite wonder,
p418
aVwe can ask questions, at least for this last minute,
p419
aVthat honestly might evade us forever.
p420
aa(lp421
VBut we have to ask:
p422
aVIs it possible that our universe
p423
aVis just a plume off of some greater history?
p424
aVOr, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse \u2014
p425
aVeach branch with its own Big Bang in its past \u2014
p426
aVmaybe some of them with black holes playing drums,
p427
aVmaybe some without \u2014
p428
aVmaybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without \u2014
p429
aVnot in our past, not in our future,
p430
aVbut somehow fundamentally connected to us?
p431
aVSo we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse,
p432
aVin some other patch of that multiverse,
p433
aVare there creatures?
p434
aVHere's my multiverse creatures.
p435
aVAre there other creatures in the multiverse,
p436
aVwondering about us
p437
aVand wondering about their own origins?
p438
aVAnd if they are,
p439
aVI can imagine them as we are,
p440
aVcalculating, writing computer code,
p441
aVbuilding instruments,
p442
aVtrying to detect that faintest sound
p443
aVof their origins
p444
aVand wondering who else is out there.
p445
aa(lp446
VThank you. Thank you.

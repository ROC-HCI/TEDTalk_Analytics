VI love the Internet.
p5
aVIt's true.
p6
aVThink about everything it has brought us.
p7
aVThink about all the services we use,
p8
aVall the connectivity,
p9
aVall the entertainment,
p10
aVall the business, all the commerce.
p11
aVAnd it's happening during our lifetimes.
p12
aVI'm pretty sure that one day
p13
aVwe'll be writing history books
p14
aVhundreds of years from now. This time
p15
aVour generation will be remembered
p16
aVas the generation that got online,
p17
aVthe generation
p18
aVthat built something really and truly global.
p19
aVBut yes, it's also true
p20
aVthat the Internet has problems, very serious problems,
p21
aVproblems with security
p22
aVand problems with privacy.
p23
aVI've spent my career
p24
aVfighting these problems.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo let me show you something.
p27
aVThis here
p28
aVis Brain.
p29
aVThis is a floppy disk
p30
aV\u2014 five and a quarter-inch floppy disk
p31
aVinfected by Brain.A.
p32
aVIt's the first virus we ever found
p33
aVfor PC computers.
p34
aVAnd we actually know
p35
aVwhere Brain came from.
p36
aVWe know because it says so
p37
aVinside the code.
p38
aVLet's take a look.
p39
aVAll right.
p40
aVThat's the boot sector of an infected floppy,
p41
aVand if we take a closer look inside,
p42
aVwe'll see that right there,
p43
aVit says, "Welcome to the dungeon."
p44
aVAnd then it continues,
p45
aVsaying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.
p46
aVAnd Basit and Amjad are first names,
p47
aVPakistani first names.
p48
aVIn fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, 1986.
p53
aVNow it's 2011.
p54
aVThat's 25 years ago.
p55
aVThe PC virus problem is 25 years old now.
p56
aVSo half a year ago,
p57
aVI decided to go to Pakistan myself.
p58
aVSo let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.
p59
aVThis is from the city of Lahore,
p60
aVwhich is around 300 kilometers south
p61
aVfrom Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.
p62
aVHere's a typical street view.
p63
aVAnd here's the street or road leading to this building,
p64
aVwhich is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.
p65
aVAnd I knocked on the door.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVYou want to guess who opened the door?
p68
aVBasit and Amjad; they are still there.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aV(Applause)
p71
aVSo here standing up is Basit.
p72
aVSitting down is his brother Amjad.
p73
aVThese are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.
p74
aVNow of course, we had a very interesting discussion.
p75
aVI asked them why.
p76
aVI asked them how they feel about what they started.
p77
aVAnd I got some sort of satisfaction
p78
aVfrom learning that both Basit and Amjad
p79
aVhad had their computers infected dozens of times
p80
aVby completely unrelated other viruses
p81
aVover these years.
p82
aVSo there is some sort of justice
p83
aVin the world after all.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, the viruses that we used to see
p86
aVin the 1980s and 1990s
p87
aVobviously are not a problem any more.
p88
aVSo let me just show you a couple of examples
p89
aVof what they used to look like.
p90
aVWhat I'm running here
p91
aVis a system that enables me
p92
aVto run age-old programs on a modern computer.
p93
aVSo let me just mount some drives. Go over there.
p94
aVWhat we have here is a list of old viruses.
p95
aVSo let me just run some viruses on my computer.
p96
aa(lp97
VFor example,
p98
aVlet's go with the Centipede virus first.
p99
aVAnd you can see at the top of the screen,
p100
aVthere's a centipede scrolling across your computer
p101
aVwhen you get infected by this one.
p102
aVYou know that you're infected
p103
aVbecause it actually shows up.
p104
aVHere's another one. This is the virus called Crash,
p105
aVinvented in Russia in 1992.
p106
aVLet me show you one which actually makes some sound.
p107
aV(Siren noise)
p108
aVAnd the last example,
p109
aVguess what the Walker virus does?
p110
aVYes, there's a guy walking across your screen
p111
aVonce you get infected.
p112
aVSo it used to be fairly easy to know
p113
aVthat you're infected by a virus,
p114
aVwhen the viruses were written by hobbyists
p115
aVand teenagers.
p116
aa(lp117
VToday, they are no longer being written
p118
aVby hobbyists and teenagers.
p119
aVToday, viruses are a global problem.
p120
aVWhat we have here in the background
p121
aVis an example of our systems that we run in our labs,
p122
aVwhere we track virus infections worldwide.
p123
aVSo we can actually see in real time
p124
aVthat we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan
p125
aVand Russia and elsewhere.
p126
aVIn fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems
p127
aVthrough the Web,
p128
aVwe can see in real time
p129
aVjust some kind of idea of how many viruses,
p130
aVhow many new examples of malware we find every single day.
p131
aVHere's the latest virus we've found,
p132
aVin a file called Server.exe.
p133
aVAnd we found it right over here three seconds ago \u2014
p134
aVthe previous one, six seconds ago.
p135
aVAnd if we just scroll around,
p136
aVit's just massive.
p137
aVWe find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.
p138
aVAnd that's the last 20 minutes of malware
p139
aVevery single day.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo where are all these coming from then?
p142
aVWell today, it's the organized criminal gangs
p143
aVwriting these viruses
p144
aVbecause they make money with their viruses.
p145
aVIt's gangs like \u2014
p146
aVlet's go to GangstaBucks.com.
p147
aVThis is a website operating in Moscow
p148
aVwhere these guys are buying infected computers.
p149
aVSo if you are a virus writer
p150
aVand you're capable of infecting Windows computers,
p151
aVbut you don't know what to do with them,
p152
aVyou can sell those infected computers \u2014
p153
aVsomebody else's computers \u2014 to these guys.
p154
aVAnd they'll actually pay you money for those computers.
p155
aVSo how do these guys then monetize
p156
aVthose infected computers?
p157
aVWell there's multiple different ways,
p158
aVsuch as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts
p159
aVwhen you do online banking,
p160
aVor keyloggers.
p161
aVKeyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view,
p162
aVand they record everything you type.
p163
aVSo you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.
p164
aVEvery single Google search you type
p165
aVis saved and sent to the criminals.
p166
aVEvery single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.
p167
aVSame thing with every single password and so on.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut the thing that they're actually looking for most
p170
aVare sessions where you go online
p171
aVand do online purchases in any online store.
p172
aVBecause when you do purchases in online stores,
p173
aVyou will be typing in your name, the delivery address,
p174
aVyour credit card number and the credit card security codes.
p175
aVAnd here's an example of a file
p176
aVwe found from a server a couple of weeks ago.
p177
aVThat's the credit card number,
p178
aVthat's the expiration date, that's the security code,
p179
aVand that's the name of the owner of the card.
p180
aVOnce you gain access to other people's credit card information,
p181
aVyou can just go online and buy whatever you want
p182
aVwith this information.
p183
aVAnd that, obviously, is a problem.
p184
aVWe now have a whole underground marketplace
p185
aVand business ecosystem
p186
aVbuilt around online crime.
p187
aa(lp188
VOne example of how these guys
p189
aVactually are capable of monetizing their operations:
p190
aVwe go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL
p191
aVand search for wanted persons.
p192
aVWe find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden,
p193
aVand his partner in crime,
p194
aValso listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages,
p195
aVMr. Shaileshkumar Jain,
p196
aVa U.S. citizen.
p197
aVThese guys were running an operation called I.M.U.,
p198
aVa cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.
p199
aVThey are both right now on the run.
p200
aVNobody knows where they are.
p201
aVU.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago,
p202
aVfroze a Swiss bank account
p203
aVbelonging to Mr. Jain,
p204
aVand that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo the amount of money online crime generates
p207
aVis significant.
p208
aVAnd that means that the online criminals
p209
aVcan actually afford to invest into their attacks.
p210
aVWe know that online criminals
p211
aVare hiring programmers, hiring testing people,
p212
aVtesting their code,
p213
aVhaving back-end systems with SQL databases.
p214
aVAnd they can afford to watch how we work \u2014
p215
aVlike how security people work \u2014
p216
aVand try to work their way around
p217
aVany security precautions we can build.
p218
aVThey also use the global nature of Internet
p219
aVto their advantage.
p220
aVI mean, the Internet is international.
p221
aVThat's why we call it the Internet.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd if you just go and take a look
p224
aVat what's happening in the online world,
p225
aVhere's a video built by Clarified Networks,
p226
aVwhich illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.
p227
aVThis operation, believed to be originally from Estonia,
p228
aVmoves around from one country to another
p229
aVas soon as the website is tried to shut down.
p230
aVSo you just can't shut these guys down.
p231
aVThey will switch from one country to another,
p232
aVfrom one jurisdiction to another \u2014
p233
aVmoving around the world,
p234
aVusing the fact that we don't have the capability
p235
aVto globally police operations like this.
p236
aVSo the Internet is as if
p237
aVsomeone would have given free plane tickets
p238
aVto all the online criminals of the world.
p239
aVNow, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before
p240
aVcan reach us.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo how do you actually go around finding online criminals?
p243
aVHow do you actually track them down?
p244
aVLet me give you an example.
p245
aVWhat we have here is one exploit file.
p246
aVHere, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file,
p247
aVwhich contains an exploit.
p248
aVAnd that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer,
p249
aVit actually takes over your computer and runs code.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow, if you'll take a look at this image file \u2014
p252
aVwell there's the image header,
p253
aVand there the actual code of the attack starts.
p254
aVAnd that code has been encrypted,
p255
aVso let's decrypt it.
p256
aVIt has been encrypted with XOR function 97.
p257
aVYou just have to believe me,
p258
aVit is, it is.
p259
aVAnd we can go here
p260
aVand actually start decrypting it.
p261
aVWell the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.
p262
aVAnd I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.
p263
aVBut just keep staring at it.
p264
aVYou'll actually see that down here
p265
aVyou can see a Web address:
p266
aVunionseek.com/d/ioo.exe
p267
aVAnd when you view this image on your computer
p268
aVit actually is going to download and run that program.
p269
aVAnd that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut even more interestingly,
p272
aVif we continue decrypting,
p273
aVwe'll find this mysterious string,
p274
aVwhich says O600KO78RUS.
p275
aVThat code is there underneath the encryption
p276
aVas some sort of a signature.
p277
aVIt's not used for anything.
p278
aVAnd I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.
p279
aVSo obviously I Googled for it.
p280
aVI got zero hits; wasn't there.
p281
aVSo I spoke with the guys at the lab.
p282
aVAnd we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs,
p283
aVand one of them mentioned,
p284
aVwell, it ends in RUS like Russia.
p285
aVAnd 78 is the city code
p286
aVfor the city of St. Petersburg.
p287
aVFor example, you can find it from some phone numbers
p288
aVand car license plates and stuff like that.
p289
aVSo I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg,
p290
aVand through a long road,
p291
aVwe eventually found this one particular website.
p292
aa(lp293
VHere's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years
p294
aVwho runs his own website,
p295
aVand he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.
p296
aVAnd on this blog, he blogs about his life,
p297
aVabout his life in St. Petersburg \u2014
p298
aVhe's in his early 20s \u2014
p299
aVabout his cat,
p300
aVabout his girlfriend.
p301
aVAnd he drives a very nice car.
p302
aVIn fact, this guy drives
p303
aVa Mercedes-Benz S600
p304
aVV12
p305
aVwith a six-liter engine
p306
aVwith more than 400 horsepower.
p307
aVNow that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.
p308
aa(lp309
VHow do I know about this car?
p310
aVBecause he blogged about the car.
p311
aVHe actually had a car accident.
p312
aVIn downtown St. Petersburg,
p313
aVhe actually crashed his car into another car.
p314
aVAnd he put blogged images about the car accident \u2014
p315
aVthat's his Mercedes \u2014
p316
aVright here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.
p317
aVAnd you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara
p318
aVends in 78RUS.
p319
aVAnd if you actually take a look at the scene picture,
p320
aVyou can see that the plate of the Mercedes
p321
aVis O600KO78RUS.
p322
aVNow I'm not a lawyer,
p323
aVbut if I would be,
p324
aVthis is where I would say, "I rest my case."
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
VSo what happens when online criminals are caught?
p329
aVWell in most cases it never gets this far.
p330
aVThe vast majority of the online crime cases,
p331
aVwe don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.
p332
aVAnd even if we are able to find online criminals,
p333
aVquite often there is no outcome.
p334
aVThe local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence,
p335
aVor for some reason we can't take them down.
p336
aVI wish it would be easier;
p337
aVunfortunately it isn't.
p338
aa(lp339
VBut things are also changing
p340
aVat a very rapid pace.
p341
aVYou've all heard about things like Stuxnet.
p342
aVSo if you look at what Stuxnet did
p343
aVis that it infected these.
p344
aVThat's a Siemens S7-400 PLC,
p345
aVprogrammable logic [controller].
p346
aVAnd this is what runs our infrastructure.
p347
aVThis is what runs everything around us.
p348
aVPLC's, these small boxes which have no display,
p349
aVno keyboard,
p350
aVwhich are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.
p351
aVFor example, the elevators in this building
p352
aVmost likely are controlled by one of these.
p353
aVAnd when Stuxnet infects one of these,
p354
aVthat's a massive revolution
p355
aVon the kinds of risks we have to worry about.
p356
aVBecause everything around us is being run by these.
p357
aVI mean, we have critical infrastructure.
p358
aVYou go to any factory, any power plant,
p359
aVany chemical plant, any food processing plant,
p360
aVyou look around \u2014
p361
aVeverything is being run by computers.
p362
aa(lp363
VEverything is being run by computers.
p364
aVEverything is reliant on these computers working.
p365
aVWe have become very reliant
p366
aVon Internet,
p367
aVon basic things like electricity, obviously,
p368
aVon computers working.
p369
aVAnd this really is something
p370
aVwhich creates completely new problems for us.
p371
aVWe must have some way
p372
aVof continuing to work
p373
aVeven if computers fail.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Laughter)
p376
aa(lp377
V(Applause)
p378
aa(lp379
VSo preparedness means that we can do stuff
p380
aVeven when the things we take for granted
p381
aVaren't there.
p382
aVIt's actually very basic stuff \u2014
p383
aVthinking about continuity, thinking about backups,
p384
aVthinking about the things that actually matter.
p385
aa(lp386
VNow I told you \u2014
p387
aV(Laughter)
p388
aVI love the Internet. I do.
p389
aVThink about all the services we have online.
p390
aVThink about if they are taken away from you,
p391
aVif one day you don't actually have them
p392
aVfor some reason or another.
p393
aVI see beauty in the future of the Internet,
p394
aVbut I'm worried
p395
aVthat we might not see that.
p396
aVI'm worried that we are running into problems
p397
aVbecause of online crime.
p398
aVOnline crime is the one thing
p399
aVthat might take these things away from us.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Laughter)
p402
aa(lp403
VI've spent my life
p404
aVdefending the Net,
p405
aVand I do feel that if we don't fight online crime,
p406
aVwe are running a risk of losing it all.
p407
aVWe have to do this globally,
p408
aVand we have to do it right now.
p409
aVWhat we need
p410
aVis more global, international law enforcement work
p411
aVto find online criminal gangs \u2014
p412
aVthese organized gangs
p413
aVthat are making millions out of their attacks.
p414
aVThat's much more important
p415
aVthan running anti-viruses or running firewalls.
p416
aVWhat actually matters
p417
aVis actually finding the people behind these attacks,
p418
aVand even more importantly,
p419
aVwe have to find the people
p420
aVwho are about to become
p421
aVpart of this online world of crime,
p422
aVbut haven't yet done it.
p423
aVWe have to find the people with the skills,
p424
aVbut without the opportunities
p425
aVand give them the opportunities
p426
aVto use their skills for good.
p427
aa(lp428
VThank you very much.

His team took down the world-wide network used by the Sobig.F worm. He was the first to warn the world about the Sasser outbreak, and he has done classified briefings on the operation of the&nbsp;Stuxnet worm -- a hugely complex worm designed to sabotage Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities.<br /><br />As a few hundred million more Internet users join the web from India and China and elsewhere, and as governments and corporations become more sophisticated at using viruses as weapons, Hypponen asks, what&#39;s next? Who will be at the front defending the world&rsquo;s networks from malicious software? He says: &quot;It&#39;s more than unsettling to realize there are large companies out there developing backdoors, exploits and trojans.&quot;</p><p>Even more unsettling: revelations this year that the United States&#39; NSA is conducting widespread digital surveillance of both US citizens and anyone whose data passes through a US entity, and that it has actively sabotaged encryption algorithms. Hypponen has become one of the most outspoken critics of the agency&#39;s programs and asks us all: Why are we so willing to hand over digital privacy?</p><div>&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read his open-season Q&amp;A on Reddit:&quot;My TED Talk was just posted. <a href=\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/itvu5/my_ted_talk_has_just_been_published_ama/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Ask me anything</a>.</p><p>See the full documentary on <a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnedOWfPKT0\\" target=\\"_blank\\">the search for the Brain virus</a>.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "mikko_hypponen", "whotheyare": "As computer access expands, Mikko Hypponen asks: What\'s the next killer virus, and will the world be able to cope with it?

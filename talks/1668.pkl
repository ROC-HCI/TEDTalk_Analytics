V"When the crisis came,
p5
aVthe serious limitations of existing economic and financial models
p6
aVimmediately became apparent."
p7
aV"There is also a strong belief, which I share,
p8
aVthat bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics
p9
aVhelped create the crisis."
p10
aa(lp11
VNow, you've probably all heard of similar criticism
p12
aVcoming from people who are skeptical of capitalism.
p13
aVBut this is different.
p14
aVThis is coming from the heart of finance.
p15
aVThe first quote is from Jean-Claude Trichet
p16
aVwhen he was governor of the European Central Bank.
p17
aVThe second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority.
p18
aVAre these people implying
p19
aVthat we don't understand the economic systems
p20
aVthat drive our modern societies?
p21
aVIt gets worse.
p22
aV"We spend billions of dollars
p23
aVtrying to understand the origins of the universe,
p24
aVwhile we still don't understand the conditions for a stable society,
p25
aVa functioning economy, or peace."
p26
aa(lp27
VWhat's happening here? How can this be possible?
p28
aVDo we really understand more about the fabric of reality
p29
aVthan we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions?
p30
aVUnfortunately, the answer is yes.
p31
aVBut there's an intriguing solution
p32
aVwhich is coming from what is known as the science of complexity.
p33
aa(lp34
VTo explain what this means and what this thing is,
p35
aVplease let me quickly take a couple of steps back.
p36
aVI ended up in physics by accident.
p37
aVIt was a random encounter when I was young,
p38
aVand since then, I've often wondered about the amazing success of physics
p39
aVin describing the reality we wake up in every day.
p40
aVIn a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows.
p41
aVSo you take a chunk of reality you want to understand
p42
aVand you translate it into mathematics.
p43
aVYou encode it into equations.
p44
aVThen, predictions can be made and tested.
p45
aVWe're actually really lucky that this works,
p46
aVbecause no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads
p47
aVshould actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe.
p48
aVDespite the success, physics has its limits.
p49
aVAs Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote,
p50
aVwe don't really understand the complexity that relates to us, that surrounds us.
p51
aVThis paradox is what got me interested in complex systems.
p52
aVSo these are systems which are made up
p53
aVof many interconnected or interacting parts:
p54
aVswarms of birds or fish,
p55
aVant colonies, ecosystems, brains, financial markets.
p56
aVThese are just a few examples.
p57
aa(lp58
VInterestingly, complex systems are very hard to map
p59
aVinto mathematical equations,
p60
aVso the usual physics approach doesn't really work here.
p61
aVSo what do we know about complex systems?
p62
aVWell, it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside
p63
aVis actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction.
p64
aVThis means you can forget about the equations
p65
aVand just start to understand the system
p66
aVby looking at the interactions,
p67
aVso you can actually forget about the equations
p68
aVand you just start to look at the interactions.
p69
aVAnd it gets even better, because most complex systems
p70
aVhave this amazing property called emergence.
p71
aVSo this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior
p72
aVwhich cannot be understood or predicted
p73
aVby looking at the components of the system.
p74
aVSo the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts.
p75
aVAnd all of this also means
p76
aVthat you can forget about the individual parts of the system,
p77
aVhow complex they are.
p78
aVSo if it's a cell or a termite or a bird,
p79
aVyou just focus on the rules of interaction.
p80
aa(lp81
VAs a result, networks are ideal representations of complex systems.
p82
aVThe nodes in the network are the system's components,
p83
aVand the links are given by the interactions.
p84
aVSo what equations are for physics,
p85
aVcomplex networks are for the study of complex systems.
p86
aa(lp87
VThis approach has been very successfully applied
p88
aVto many complex systems in physics, biology,
p89
aVcomputer science, the social sciences,
p90
aVbut what about economics?
p91
aVWhere are economic networks?
p92
aVThis is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature.
p93
aVThe study we published last year, called "The Network of Global Corporate Control,"
p94
aVwas the first extensive analysis of economic networks.
p95
aVThe study went viral on the Internet
p96
aVand it attracted a lot of attention from the international media.
p97
aVThis is quite remarkable, because, again, why did no one look at this before?
p98
aVSimilar data has been around for quite some time.
p99
aa(lp100
VWhat we looked at in detail was ownership networks.
p101
aVSo here the nodes are companies, people, governments, foundations, etc.
p102
aVAnd the links represent the shareholding relations,
p103
aVso shareholder A has x percent of the shares in company B.
p104
aVAnd we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue.
p105
aVSo ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations.
p106
aVIn this little example, you can see a few financial institutions
p107
aVwith some of the many links highlighted.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow, you may think that no one looked at this before
p110
aVbecause ownership networks are really, really boring to study.
p111
aVWell, as ownership is related to control,
p112
aVas I shall explain later,
p113
aVlooking at ownership networks
p114
aVactually can give you answers to questions like,
p115
aVwho are the key players?
p116
aVHow are they organized? Are they isolated?
p117
aVAre they interconnected?
p118
aVAnd what is the overall distribution of control?
p119
aVIn other words, who controls the world?
p120
aVI think this is an interesting question.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd it has implications for systemic risk.
p123
aVThis is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall.
p124
aVA high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability,
p125
aVbecause then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic.
p126
aa(lp127
VScientists have sometimes criticized economists
p128
aVwho believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data,
p129
aVbecause a foundational guideline in science is:
p130
aVLet the data speak. OK. Let's do that.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007.
p133
aVThis is a lot of data, and because we wanted to find out
p134
aV"who rules the world,"
p135
aVwe decided to focus on transnational corporations,
p136
aVor "TNCs," for short.
p137
aVThese are companies that operate in more than one country,
p138
aVand we found 43,000.
p139
aVIn the next step, we built the network around these companies,
p140
aVso we took all the TNCs' shareholders,
p141
aVand the shareholders' shareholders, etc.,
p142
aVall the way upstream, and we did the same downstream,
p143
aVand ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes
p144
aVand one million links.
p145
aVThis is the TNC network which we analyzed.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd it turns out to be structured as follows.
p148
aVSo you have a periphery and a center
p149
aVwhich contains about 75 percent of all the players,
p150
aVand in the center, there's this tiny but dominant core
p151
aVwhich is made up of highly interconnected companies.
p152
aVTo give you a better picture,
p153
aVthink about a metropolitan area.
p154
aVSo you have the suburbs and the periphery,
p155
aVyou have a center, like a financial district,
p156
aVthen the core will be something like
p157
aVthe tallest high-rise building in the center.
p158
aVAnd we already see signs of organization going on here.
p159
aV36 percent of the TNCs are in the core only,
p160
aVbut they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenue of all TNCs.
p161
aa(lp162
VOK, so now we analyzed the structure,
p163
aVso how does this relate to the control?
p164
aVWell, ownership gives voting rights to shareholders.
p165
aVThis is the normal notion of control.
p166
aVAnd there are different models
p167
aVwhich allow you to compute the control you get from ownership.
p168
aVIf you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company,
p169
aVyou get control,
p170
aVbut usually, it depends on the relative distribution of shares.
p171
aVAnd the network really matters.
p172
aVAbout 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Provera
p173
aVhad ownership and control in a small company,
p174
aVwhich had ownership and control in a bigger company.
p175
aVYou get the idea.
p176
aVThis ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26.
p177
aVSo this means that, with each euro he invested,
p178
aVhe was able to move 26 euros of market value
p179
aVthrough the chain of ownership relations.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs' value.
p182
aVThis allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder.
p183
aVThis is very much in the sense of Max Weber's idea of potential power,
p184
aVwhich is the probability of imposing one's own will
p185
aVdespite the opposition of others.
p186
aa(lp187
VIf you want to compute the flow in an ownership network,
p188
aVthis is what you have to do.
p189
aVIt's actually not that hard to understand.
p190
aVLet me explain by giving you this analogy.
p191
aVSo think about water flowing in pipes, where the pipes have different thickness.
p192
aVSo similarly, the control is flowing in the ownership networks
p193
aVand is accumulating at the nodes.
p194
aVSo what did we find after computing all this network control?
p195
aVWell, it turns out that the 737 top shareholders
p196
aVhave the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the TNCs' value.
p197
aVNow remember, we started out with 600,000 nodes,
p198
aVso these 737 top players make up a bit more than 0.1 percent.
p199
aVThey're mostly financial institutions in the US and the UK.
p200
aVAnd it gets even more extreme.
p201
aVThere are 146 top players in the core,
p202
aVand they together have the potential to collectively control
p203
aV40 percent of the TNCs' value.
p204
aa(lp205
VWhat should you take home from all of this?
p206
aVWell, the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard.
p207
aVThe high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core
p208
aVcould pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy.
p209
aVAnd we could easily reproduce the TNC network
p210
aVwith a few simple rules.
p211
aVThis means that its structure is probably the result of self-organization.
p212
aVIt's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system,
p213
aVso it's probably not the result of a top-down approach
p214
aVlike a global conspiracy.
p215
aa(lp216
VOur study "is an impression of the moon's surface.
p217
aVIt's not a street map."
p218
aVSo you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt,
p219
aVyet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance."
p220
aVWe hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction,
p221
aVso the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future.
p222
aVAnd this is slowly starting.
p223
aVWe're seeing the emergence of long-term and highly-funded programs
p224
aVwhich aim at understanding our networked world
p225
aVfrom a complexity point of view.
p226
aVBut this journey has only just begun,
p227
aVso we will have to wait before we see the first results.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow there is still a big problem, in my opinion.
p230
aVIdeas relating to finance, economics, politics, society,
p231
aVare very often tainted by people's personal ideologies.
p232
aVI really hope that this complexity perspective
p233
aVallows for some common ground to be found.
p234
aVIt would be really great if it has the power
p235
aVto help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas,
p236
aVwhich appears to be paralyzing our globalized world.
p237
aVReality is so complex, we need to move away from dogma.
p238
aVBut this is just my own personal ideology.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you.

The study looked at the architecture of ownership across the globe, and computed a level of control exerted by each international player.

What I wanted to say:\\r\\n\\"This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions. You can then understand the complex system by simulating it in a computer. As an example, you need three simple rules to simulate swarming behavior: Move in the same direction as your neighbor, stay close to your neighbor, but avoid collisions. If you think this is no big deal, think again. No one saw this coming. And to this day no one really knows why this is the way things are. It\'s as if reality is giving us a big help in understanding how stuff works. Like the \'miracle\' I mentioned before, those equations mirror the workings of the universe. And it gets even better, because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence. So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system.\\"", "type": "correction", "status": "approved", "published": true}, {"timecode": "08:11", "text": "I misspoke when I said, \\"Thirty-six percent of the TNCs are in the core only ... .\\" Instead, I meant to say, \\"Thirty-six percent of the TNCs are in the *center* only.\\"", "type": "correction", "status": "approved", "published": true}]}], "event": "TEDxZurich 2012", "name": "James B.

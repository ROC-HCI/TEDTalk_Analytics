VMy thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.
p5
aVI'm the Director of Nutrition Services
p6
aVfor the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees
p7
aVand 17 locations, 9,600 kids.
p8
aVI'm doing 7,100 meals a day
p9
aVand I've been doing it for two years,
p10
aVtrying to change how we feed kids in America.
p11
aVAnd that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.
p12
aVThese are some of my kids with a salad bar.
p13
aVI put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.
p14
aVEveryone says it couldn't be done.
p15
aVLittle kids couldn't eat off the salad bar,
p16
aVbig kids would spit in it \u2014 neither happened.
p17
aa(lp18
VWhen I took over this, I tried to really figure out,
p19
aVlike, what my vision would be.
p20
aVHow do we really change children's relationship to food?
p21
aVAnd I'll tell you why we need to change it,
p22
aVbut we absolutely have to change it.
p23
aVAnd what I came to understand is,
p24
aVwe needed to teach children
p25
aVthe symbiotic relationship
p26
aVbetween a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.
p27
aVAnd that if we don't do that, the antithesis,
p28
aValthough we've heard otherwise,
p29
aVis we're really going to become extinct,
p30
aVbecause we're feeding our children to death.
p31
aVThat's my premise.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.
p34
aVAnd the reason this is happening, by and large,
p35
aVis because of our food system
p36
aVand the way the government commodifies food,
p37
aVthe way the government oversees our food,
p38
aVthe way the USDA puts food on kids' plates
p39
aVthat's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.
p40
aVAnd by \u2014 tacitly, all of us send our kids,
p41
aVor grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school
p42
aVand tell them to learn, you know,
p43
aVlearn what's in those schools.
p44
aVAnd when you feed these kids bad food,
p45
aVthat's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.
p46
aa(lp47
VThe way we got here is because of big agribusiness.
p48
aVWe now live in a country where most of us don't decide,
p49
aVby and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,
p50
aVwho brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.
p51
aVThey control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.
p52
aVThese are \u2014 10 companies
p53
aVcontrol much of what's in our grocery stores,
p54
aVmuch of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo when I started thinking about these issues
p57
aVand how I was going to change what kids ate,
p58
aVI really started focusing on what we would teach them.
p59
aVAnd the very first thing
p60
aVwas about regional food \u2014 trying to eat food
p61
aVfrom within our region.
p62
aVAnd clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,
p63
aVor when \u2014 as the fossil fuel is going away,
p64
aVas oil hits its peak oil,
p65
aVyou know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not
p66
aVwe should, or could, be moving food
p67
aV1,500 miles before we eat it.
p68
aVSo we talked to kids about that,
p69
aVand we really start to feed kids regional food.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd then we talk about organic food.
p72
aVNow, most school districts can't really afford organic food,
p73
aVbut we, as a nation,
p74
aVhave to start thinking about
p75
aVconsuming, growing and feeding our children
p76
aVfood that's not chock-full of chemicals.
p77
aVWe can't keep feeding our kids pesticides
p78
aVand herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.
p79
aVWe can't keep doing that.
p80
aVYou know, it doesn't work.
p81
aVAnd the results of that are kids getting sick.
p82
aa(lp83
VOne of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.
p84
aVSeventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America
p85
aVis consumed in animal husbandry.
p86
aVWe are feeding our kids antibiotics
p87
aVin beef and other animal protein every day.
p88
aVSeventy percent \u2014 it's unbelievable.
p89
aVAnd the result of it is, we have diseases.
p90
aVWe have things like E. coli that we can't fix,
p91
aVthat we can't make kids better when they get sick.
p92
aVAnd, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,
p93
aVbut it's an issue in the food supply.
p94
aVOne of my favorite facts is that
p95
aVU.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.
p96
aVThat means every one of us, and our children,
p97
aVconsumes what would equal a five-pound bag \u2014
p98
aVthose bags you have at home. If I had one here
p99
aVand ripped it open,
p100
aVand that pile I would have on the floor
p101
aVis what we consume and feed our children every year
p102
aVbecause of what goes into our food supply,
p103
aVbecause of the way we consume
p104
aVproduce in America.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe USDA allows these antibiotics,
p107
aVthese hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,
p108
aVand the USDA paid for this ad
p109
aVin Time magazine.
p110
aVOkay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,
p111
aVbut we know it wasn't good for you and me.
p112
aVAnd that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.
p113
aVAnd that has to change, you know.
p114
aVThe USDA cannot be seen as
p115
aVthe be-all and end-all of what we feed
p116
aVour kids and what's allowed.
p117
aVWe cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.
p118
aVThe antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.
p119
aVThat's what I really try and get people to understand.
p120
aVI really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important.
p121
aVIt's consuming food in a way
p122
aVin which we'll still have a planet,
p123
aVin which kids will grow up to be healthy,
p124
aVand which really tries to mitigate
p125
aVall the negative impacts we're seeing.
p126
aVIt really is just a new idea.
p127
aVI mean, people toss around sustainability,
p128
aVbut we have to figure out what sustainability is.
p129
aa(lp130
VIn less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations,
p131
aVwe've gone from being 200 \u2014
p132
aVbeing 100 percent, 95 percent farmers
p133
aVto less than 2 percent of farmers.
p134
aVWe now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers \u2014
p135
aV2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers.
p136
aVAnd we spend 35,000 dollars
p137
aVon average a year keeping a prisoner in prison,
p138
aVand school districts spend 500 dollars a year
p139
aVfeeding a child.
p140
aVIt's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd what's happening is, we're getting sick.
p145
aVWe're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.
p146
aVIt is about what we feed them.
p147
aVWhat goes in is what we are.
p148
aVWe really are what we eat.
p149
aVAnd if we continue down this path,
p150
aVif we continue to feed kids bad food,
p151
aVif we continue not to teach them what good food is,
p152
aVwhat's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen?
p153
aVWhat's going to happen to our whole medical system?
p154
aVWhat's going to happen is,
p155
aVwe're going to have kids
p156
aVthat have a life less long than our own.
p157
aVThe CDC, the Center for Disease Control,
p158
aVhas said, of the children born in the year 2000 \u2014
p159
aVthose seven- and eight-year-olds today \u2014
p160
aVone out of every three Caucasians,
p161
aVone out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics
p162
aVare going to have diabetes in their lifetime.
p163
aVAnd if that's not enough, they've gone on to say,
p164
aVmost before they graduate high school.
p165
aVThis means that 40 or 45 percent
p166
aVof all school-aged children
p167
aVcould be insulin-dependent
p168
aVwithin a decade. Within a decade.
p169
aa(lp170
VWhat's going to happen?
p171
aVWell, the CDC has gone further to say
p172
aVthat those children born in the year 2000
p173
aVcould be the first generation
p174
aVin our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents.
p175
aVAnd it's because of what we feed them.
p176
aVBecause eight-year-olds don't get to decide \u2014
p177
aVand if they do, you should be in therapy.
p178
aVYou know, we are responsible
p179
aVfor what kids eat.
p180
aVBut oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.
p181
aVBig companies spend 20 billion dollars a year
p182
aVmarketing non-nutrient foods to kids.
p183
aV20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see.
p184
aVThey spend 500 dollars
p185
aVfor every one dollar \u2014 500 dollars marketing foods
p186
aVthat kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar
p187
aVmarketing healthy, nutritious food.
p188
aVThe result of which is kids think they're going to die
p189
aVif they don't have chicken nuggets.
p190
aa(lp191
VYou know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more.
p192
aVThis is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing.
p193
aVAnd the one over there, that's bigger than my head,
p194
aVis what McDonald's and Burger King
p195
aVand those big companies think we should eat.
p196
aVAnd why can they serve that much?
p197
aVWhy can we have 29-cent Big Gulps
p198
aVand 99-cent double burgers?
p199
aVIt's because of the way the government commodifies food,
p200
aVand the cheap corn and cheap soy
p201
aVthat are pushed into our food supply
p202
aVthat makes these non-nutrient foods
p203
aVreally, really cheap.
p204
aVWhich is why I say it's a social justice issue.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think,
p207
aV"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley."
p208
aVWell, this is the food I found 24 months ago.
p209
aVThis is not even food.
p210
aVThis is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos,
p211
aVcorn dogs,
p212
aVpizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.
p213
aVEverything came in plastic, in cardboard.
p214
aVThe only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.
p215
aVThe only working piece of equipment in my kitchen
p216
aVwas a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can,
p217
aVit came frozen in a box.
p218
aVThe USDA allows this.
p219
aVThe USDA allows all of this stuff.
p220
aVIn case you can't tell, that's, like,
p221
aVpink Danish and some kind of cupcakes.
p222
aVChicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose,
p223
aVcanned fruit cocktail \u2014 a reimbursable meal.
p224
aa(lp225
VThat's what the government says is okay to feed our kids.
p226
aVIt ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay.
p227
aVAnd we, all of us,
p228
aVhave to understand
p229
aVthat this is about us,
p230
aVthat we can make a difference here.
p231
aVNow I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets,
p232
aVbut I'm sure you're rich if you did.
p233
aVBut whoever decided that a chicken should look like
p234
aVa heart, a giraffe, a star?
p235
aVWell, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken.
p236
aVAnd that they could figure it out,
p237
aVthat we could sell this stuff to kids.
p238
aVYou know, what's wrong with teaching kids
p239
aVthat chicken looks like chicken?
p240
aVBut this is what most schools serve.
p241
aVIn fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve,
p242
aVas opposed to \u2014 this is what we try and serve.
p243
aa(lp244
VWe really need to change
p245
aVthis whole paradigm with kids and food.
p246
aVWe really have to teach children
p247
aVthat chicken is not a giraffe.
p248
aVYou know, that vegetables
p249
aVare actually colorful, that they have flavor,
p250
aVthat carrots grow in the ground,
p251
aVthat strawberries grow in the ground.
p252
aVThere's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush.
p253
aVYou know, we have to change
p254
aVthe way we teach kids about these things.
p255
aVThere's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools
p256
aVdoing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools
p257
aVactually getting fresh food into schools.
p258
aa(lp259
VNow, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh.
p260
aVWe have no high-fructose corn syrup,
p261
aVno trans fats, no processed foods.
p262
aVWe're cooking from scratch every day.
p263
aVWe have 25 percent of our \u2014
p264
aV(Applause)
p265
aVthank you \u2014 25 percent of our stuff
p266
aVis organic and local. We cook.
p267
aVThose are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m.
p268
aVevery day and go cook the food for the kids,
p269
aVbecause this is what we need to do.
p270
aVWe can't keep serving kids
p271
aVprocessed crap,
p272
aVfull of chemicals,
p273
aVand expect these are going to be healthy citizens.
p274
aVYou're not going to get the next generation,
p275
aVor the generation after, to be able to think like this
p276
aVif they're not nourished.
p277
aVIf they're eating
p278
aVchemicals all the time,
p279
aVthey're not going to be able to think.
p280
aVThey're not going to be smart.
p281
aVYou know what? They're just going to be sick.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow one of the things that \u2014 what happened when I went into Berkeley
p284
aVis I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people,
p285
aVvery, very different, and I needed to market it.
p286
aVI came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent.
p287
aVAnd these calendars really started to lay out my program.
p288
aVNow I'm in charge of all the cooking classes
p289
aVand all the gardening classes in our school district.
p290
aVSo this is a typical menu.
p291
aVThis is what we're serving this week at the schools.
p292
aVAnd you see these recipes on the side?
p293
aVThose are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes.
p294
aVThey do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes.
p295
aVThey also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias.
p296
aVIf we're going to change children's relationship to food,
p297
aVit's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias,
p298
aVhands-on experience \u2014 you're looking in cooking and gardening classes \u2014
p299
aVand academic curriculum to tie it all together.
p300
aa(lp301
VNow you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA,
p302
aVand I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid,
p303
aVthis upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know.
p304
aVYou know, run up into the end of the rainbow,
p305
aVI don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own.
p306
aVThis is available on my website in English and Spanish,
p307
aVand it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.
p308
aVThe really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.
p309
aVWe have to start changing this.
p310
aVWe have to make kids understand
p311
aVthat their food choices make a big difference.
p312
aVWe have cooking classes \u2014 we have cooking classrooms in our schools.
p313
aVAnd why this is so important is
p314
aVthat we now have grown a generation,
p315
aVmaybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals
p316
aVis eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car
p317
aVand one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.
p318
aVWhat are kids learning? Where is the family time?
p319
aVWhere is socialization? Where is discussion?
p320
aVWhere is learning to talk?
p321
aVYou know, we have to change it.
p322
aa(lp323
VI work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem.
p324
aVEATWISE \u2014 Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating.
p325
aVWe have to teach kids
p326
aVthat Coke and Pop Tarts
p327
aVaren't breakfast.
p328
aVWe have to teach kids that if they're on a diet
p329
aVof refined sugar,
p330
aVthey go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack.
p331
aVAnd we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools.
p332
aVWe have recycling in all of our schools.
p333
aVYou know, the things that we maybe do at home
p334
aVand think are so important,
p335
aVwe have to teach kids about in school.
p336
aVIt has to be so much a part of them
p337
aVthat they really get it.
p338
aVBecause, you know what, many of us
p339
aVare sort of at the end of our careers,
p340
aVand we need to be giving these kids \u2014
p341
aVthese young kids, the next generation \u2014
p342
aVthe tools to save themselves
p343
aVand save the planet.
p344
aa(lp345
VOne of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships.
p346
aVI work with private companies
p347
aVwho are willing to do R & D with me,
p348
aVwho are willing to do distribution for me,
p349
aVwho are really willing to work to go into schools.
p350
aVSchools are underfunded.
p351
aVMost schools in America spend less
p352
aVthan 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.
p353
aVThat comes down to under five dollars an hour.
p354
aVMost of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour
p355
aVfor babysitters when you have them.
p356
aVSo we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.
p357
aVAnd if we're going to change it,
p358
aVand change how we feed kids,
p359
aVwe really have to rethink that.
p360
aVSo, public and private partnerships,
p361
aVadvocacy groups, working with foundations.
p362
aVIn our school district, the way we afford this
p363
aVis our school district allocates .03 percent
p364
aVof the general fund
p365
aVtowards nutrition services. And I think if every school district
p366
aVallocated a half to one percent,
p367
aVwe could start to really fix this program.
p368
aa(lp369
VWe really need to change it.
p370
aVIt's going to take more money.
p371
aVOf course, it's not all about food; it's also about
p372
aVkids getting exercise.
p373
aVAnd one of the simple things we can do
p374
aVis put recess before lunch.
p375
aVIt's sort of this "duh" thing.
p376
aVYou know, if you have kids coming into lunch
p377
aVand all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess,
p378
aVyou see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.
p379
aVAnd then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing.
p380
aVThese are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down
p381
aVwhen you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.
p382
aVSo if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class,
p383
aVbelieve me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch.
p384
aa(lp385
VWe need to \u2014
p386
aVwe need to educate.
p387
aVWe need to educate the kids.
p388
aVWe need to educate the staff.
p389
aVI had 90 employees.
p390
aVTwo were supposed to be cooks \u2014 none could.
p391
aVAnd, you know, I'm not that better off now.
p392
aVBut we really have to educate.
p393
aVWe have to get academic institutions to start thinking
p394
aVabout ways to teach people how to cook again,
p395
aVbecause, of course, they don't \u2014
p396
aVbecause we've had this processed food in schools
p397
aVand institutions for so long.
p398
aVWe need 40-minute lunches \u2014
p399
aVmost schools have 20-minute lunches \u2014
p400
aVand lunches that are time-appropriate.
p401
aVThere was just a big study done, and so many schools
p402
aVare starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.
p403
aVThat is not lunchtime.
p404
aa(lp405
VYou know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing.
p406
aVAnd just remember,
p407
aVat very least tacitly,
p408
aVthis is what we're teaching children
p409
aVas what they should be doing.
p410
aVI think if we're going to fix this,
p411
aVone of the things we have to do
p412
aVis really change how we have oversight
p413
aVover the National School Lunch Program.
p414
aVInstead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA,
p415
aVI think it should be under CDC.
p416
aVIf we started to think about food
p417
aVand how we feed our kids
p418
aVas a health initiative,
p419
aVand we started thinking about food as health,
p420
aVthen I think we wouldn't have corn dogs
p421
aVas lunch.
p422
aa(lp423
VOkay, Finance 101 on this,
p424
aVand this \u2014 I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece,
p425
aVbecause I think this is something we all have to understand.
p426
aVThe National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars
p427
aVfeeding 30 million children a year.
p428
aVThat number probably needs to double.
p429
aVPeople say, "Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?"
p430
aVIn this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year
p431
aVon fast food.
p432
aVWe spend 100 billion dollars a year
p433
aVon diet aids.
p434
aVWe spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables,
p435
aVwhich is why we need all the diet aids.
p436
aVWe spend 200 billion dollars a year
p437
aVon diet-related illness today,
p438
aVwith nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes.
p439
aV200 billion.
p440
aa(lp441
VSo you know what, when we talk
p442
aVabout needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot.
p443
aVThat 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents \u2014
p444
aVthat's what the government allocates for lunch.
p445
aVMost school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.
p446
aVThat means we spend less than a dollar a day
p447
aVon food for kids in schools \u2014
p448
aVmost schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it's 56 cents.
p449
aVSo we're spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch.
p450
aVNow I don't know about you,
p451
aVbut I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that,
p452
aVand venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars.
p453
aVOne gourmet coffee,
p454
aVone, is more \u2014
p455
aVwe spend more on than we are spending to feed kids
p456
aVfor an entire week
p457
aVin our schools.
p458
aa(lp459
VYou know what? We should be ashamed.
p460
aVWe, as a country, should be ashamed
p461
aVat that.
p462
aVThe richest country.
p463
aVIn our country,
p464
aVit's the kids that need it the most,
p465
aVwho get this really, really lousy food.
p466
aVIt's the kids who have parents and grandparents
p467
aVand uncles and aunts that can't even afford
p468
aVto pay for school lunch that gets this food.
p469
aVAnd those are the same kids
p470
aVwho are going to be getting sick.
p471
aVThose are the same kids who we should be taking care of.
p472
aa(lp473
VWe can all make a difference.
p474
aVThat every single one of us,
p475
aVwhether we have children,
p476
aVwhether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews,
p477
aVor anything \u2014
p478
aVthat we can make a difference.
p479
aVWhether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids,
p480
aVwhether you take your kids, or grandchildren,
p481
aVor nieces and nephews shopping
p482
aVto a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them.
p483
aVSit down and care.
p484
aVAnd on the macro level,
p485
aVwe're in what seems to be
p486
aVa 19-month presidential campaign,
p487
aVand of all the things we're asking
p488
aVall of these potential leaders,

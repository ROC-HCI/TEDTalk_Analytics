VThis is our life with bees,
p5
aVand this is our life without bees.
p6
aVBees are the most important pollinators
p7
aVof our fruits and vegetables and flowers
p8
aVand crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.
p9
aVMore than one third of the world's crop production
p10
aVis dependent on bee pollination.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut the ironic thing is that bees are not out there
p13
aVpollinating our food intentionally.
p14
aVThey're out there because they need to eat.
p15
aVBees get all of the protein they need in their diet
p16
aVfrom pollen
p17
aVand all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.
p18
aVThey're flower-feeders,
p19
aVand as they move from flower to flower,
p20
aVbasically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,
p21
aVthey end up providing this valuable pollination service.
p22
aVIn parts of the world where there are no bees,
p23
aVor where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,
p24
aVpeople are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.
p25
aVThese people are moving pollen from flower to flower
p26
aVwith a paintbrush.
p27
aVNow this business of hand pollination
p28
aVis actually not that uncommon.
p29
aVTomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers
p30
aVwith a hand-held vibrator.
p31
aVNow this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter)
p32
aVNow this is because the pollen within a tomato flower
p33
aVis held very securely within
p34
aVthe male part of the flower, the anther,
p35
aVand the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.
p36
aVSo bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world
p37
aVthat are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,
p38
aVand they do this by shaking their flight muscles
p39
aVat a frequency similar to the musical note C.
p40
aVSo they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,
p41
aVand that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,
p42
aVand the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body,
p43
aVand she takes it home as food.
p44
aVTomato growers now put bumblebee colonies
p45
aVinside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes
p46
aVbecause they get much more efficient pollination
p47
aVwhen it's done naturally
p48
aVand they get better quality tomatoes.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo there's other, maybe more personal reasons,
p51
aVto care about bees.
p52
aVThere's over 20,000 species of bees in the world,
p53
aVand they're absolutely gorgeous.
p54
aVThese bees spend the majority of their life cycle
p55
aVhidden in the ground or within a hollow stem
p56
aVand very few of these beautiful species
p57
aVhave evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative
p60
aVfor the other 19,900-plus species
p61
aVbecause there's something about honeybees
p62
aVthat draws people into their world.
p63
aVHumans have been drawn to honeybees
p64
aVsince early recorded history,
p65
aVmostly to harvest their honey,
p66
aVwhich is an amazing natural sweetener.
p67
aa(lp68
VI got drawn into the honeybee world
p69
aVcompletely by a fluke.
p70
aVI was 18 years old and bored,
p71
aVand I picked up a book in the library on bees
p72
aVand I spent the night reading it.
p73
aVI had never thought about insects
p74
aVliving in complex societies.
p75
aVIt was like the best of science fiction come true.
p76
aVAnd even stranger, there were these people,
p77
aVthese beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,
p78
aVand when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.
p79
aVSo I went to work for a commercial beekeeper,
p80
aVa family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.
p81
aVAnd I was permanently hooked.
p82
aa(lp83
VHoneybees can be considered a super-organism,
p84
aVwhere the colony is the organism
p85
aVand it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000
p86
aVindividual bee organisms.
p87
aVNow this society has no central authority.
p88
aVNobody's in charge.
p89
aVSo how they come to collective decisions,
p90
aVand how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,
p91
aVhow they communicate where the flowers are,
p92
aVall of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.
p93
aVMy personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years,
p94
aVis their system of healthcare.
p95
aVSo bees have social healthcare.
p96
aVSo in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.
p97
aVFor example, we study hygiene,
p98
aVwhere some bees are able to locate and weed out
p99
aVsick individuals from the nest, from the colony,
p100
aVand it keeps the colony healthy.
p101
aVAnd more recently, we've been studying resins
p102
aVthat bees collect from plants.
p103
aVSo bees fly to some plants and they scrape
p104
aVthese very, very sticky resins off the leaves,
p105
aVand they take them back to the nest
p106
aVwhere they cement them into the nest architecture
p107
aVwhere we call it propolis.
p108
aVWe've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.
p109
aVIt's a natural antibiotic.
p110
aVIt kills off bacteria and molds and other germs
p111
aVwithin the colony,
p112
aVand so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.
p113
aVHumans have known about the power of propolis
p114
aVsince biblical times.
p115
aVWe've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies
p116
aVfor human medicine,
p117
aVbut we didn't know how good it was for the bees.
p118
aVSo honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses
p119
aVthat have kept them healthy and thriving
p120
aVfor over 50 million years.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo seven years ago, when honeybee colonies
p123
aVwere reported to be dying en masse,
p124
aVfirst in the United States,
p125
aVit was clear that there was something really, really wrong.
p126
aVIn our collective conscience, in a really primal way,
p127
aVwe know we can't afford to lose bees.
p128
aVSo what's going on?
p129
aVBees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,
p130
aVand I'll go through each of these.
p131
aVThe bottom line is,
p132
aVbees dying reflects a flowerless landscape
p133
aVand a dysfunctional food system.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow we have the best data on honeybees,
p136
aVso I'll use them as an example.
p137
aVIn the United States, bees in fact have been
p138
aVin decline since World War II.
p139
aVWe have half the number of managed hives
p140
aVin the United States now compared to 1945.
p141
aVWe're down to about two million hives of bees, we think.
p142
aVAnd the reason is, after World War II,
p143
aVwe changed our farming practices.
p144
aVWe stopped planting cover crops.
p145
aVWe stopped planting clover and alfalfa,
p146
aVwhich are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,
p147
aVand instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.
p148
aVClover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.
p149
aVAnd after World War II, we started using herbicides
p150
aVto kill off the weeds in our farms.
p151
aVMany of these weeds are flowering plants
p152
aVthat bees require for their survival.
p153
aVAnd we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.
p154
aVNow we talk about food deserts,
p155
aVplaces in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.
p156
aVThe very farms that used to sustain bees
p157
aVare now agricultural food deserts,
p158
aVdominated by one or two plant species
p159
aVlike corn and soybeans.
p160
aVSince World War II, we have been systematically
p161
aVeliminating many of the flowering plants
p162
aVthat bees need for their survival.
p163
aVAnd these monocultures extend even to crops
p164
aVthat are good for bees, like almonds.
p165
aVFifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,
p166
aVhives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,
p167
aVand also because the pollen in an almond blossom
p168
aVis really high in protein. It's really good for bees.
p169
aVNow, the scale of almond monoculture
p170
aVdemands that most of our nation's bees,
p171
aVover 1.5 million hives of bees,
p172
aVbe transported across the nation
p173
aVto pollinate this one crop.
p174
aVAnd they're trucked in in semi-loads,
p175
aVand they must be trucked out,
p176
aVbecause after bloom, the almond orchards
p177
aVare a vast and flowerless landscape.
p178
aa(lp179
VBees have been dying over the last 50 years,
p180
aVand we're planting more crops that need them.
p181
aVThere has been a 300 percent increase in crop production
p182
aVthat requires bee pollination.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd then there's pesticides.
p185
aVAfter World War II, we started using pesticides
p186
aVon a large scale, and this became necessary
p187
aVbecause of the monocultures that put out a feast
p188
aVfor crop pests.
p189
aVRecently, researchers from Penn State University
p190
aVhave started looking at the pesticide residue
p191
aVin the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,
p192
aVand they've found that every batch of pollen
p193
aVthat a honeybee collects
p194
aVhas at least six detectable pesticides in it,
p195
aVand this includes every class of insecticides,
p196
aVherbicides, fungicides,
p197
aVand even inert and unlabeled ingredients
p198
aVthat are part of the pesticide formulation
p199
aVthat can be more toxic than the active ingredient.
p200
aVThis small bee is holding up a large mirror.
p201
aVHow much is it going to take to contaminate humans?
p202
aa(lp203
VOne of these class of insecticides,
p204
aVthe neonicontinoids,
p205
aVis making headlines around the world right now.
p206
aVYou've probably heard about it.
p207
aVThis is a new class of insecticides.
p208
aVIt moves through the plant so that a crop pest,
p209
aVa leaf-eating insect,
p210
aVwould take a bite of the plant
p211
aVand get a lethal dose and die.
p212
aVIf one of these neonics, we call them,
p213
aVis applied in a high concentration,
p214
aVsuch as in this ground application,
p215
aVenough of the compound moves through the plant
p216
aVand gets into the pollen and the nectar,
p217
aVwhere a bee can consume, in this case,
p218
aVa high dose of this neurotoxin
p219
aVthat makes the bee twitch and die.
p220
aVIn most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,
p221
aVit's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide,
p222
aVand so a smaller concentration moves through the plant
p223
aVand gets into the pollen and nectar,
p224
aVand if a bee consumes this lower dose,
p225
aVeither nothing happens
p226
aVor the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented
p227
aVand she may not find her way home.
p228
aVAnd on top of everything else, bees have
p229
aVtheir own set of diseases and parasites.
p230
aVPublic enemy number one for bees is this thing.
p231
aVIt's called varroa destructor.
p232
aVIt's aptly named.
p233
aVIt's this big, blood-sucking parasite
p234
aVthat compromises the bee's immune system
p235
aVand circulates viruses.
p236
aa(lp237
VLet me put this all together for you.
p238
aVI don't know what it feels like to a bee
p239
aVto have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,
p240
aVand I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,
p241
aVbut I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,
p242
aVand I know how difficult it is for me to get
p243
aVto the grocery store to get good nutrition.
p244
aVBut what if I lived in a food desert?
p245
aVAnd what if I had to travel a long distance
p246
aVto get to the grocery store,
p247
aVand I finally got my weak body out there
p248
aVand I consumed, in my food,
p249
aVenough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,
p250
aVthat I couldn't find my way home?
p251
aVAnd this is what we mean by multiple
p252
aVand interacting causes of death.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd it's not just our honeybees.
p255
aVAll of our beautiful wild species of bees
p256
aVare at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.
p257
aVThese bees are providing backup for our honeybees.
p258
aVThey're providing the pollination insurance
p259
aValongside our honeybees.
p260
aVWe need all of our bees.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo what are we going to do?
p263
aVWhat are we going to do about this big bee bummer
p264
aVthat we've created?
p265
aVIt turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful.
p266
aVEvery one of you out there can help bees
p267
aVin two very direct and easy ways.
p268
aVPlant bee-friendly flowers,
p269
aVand don't contaminate these flowers,
p270
aVthis bee food, with pesticides.
p271
aVSo go online and search for flowers
p272
aVthat are native to your area and plant them.
p273
aVPlant them in a pot on your doorstep.
p274
aVPlant them in your front yard, in your lawns,
p275
aVin your boulevards.
p276
aVCampaign to have them planted in public gardens,
p277
aVcommunity spaces, meadows.
p278
aVSet aside farmland.
p279
aVWe need a beautiful diversity of flowers
p280
aVthat blooms over the entire growing season,
p281
aVfrom spring to fall.
p282
aVWe need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees,
p283
aVbut also for migrating butterflies and birds
p284
aVand other wildlife.
p285
aVAnd we need to think carefully about putting back in
p286
aVcover crops to nourish our soil
p287
aVand nourish our bees.
p288
aVAnd we need to diversify our farms.
p289
aVWe need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows
p290
aVto disrupt the agricultural food desert
p291
aVand begin to correct the dysfunctional food system
p292
aVthat we've created.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure
p295
aVto a big, huge problem \u2014 just go plant flowers \u2014
p296
aVbut when bees have access to good nutrition,
p297
aVwe have access to good nutrition
p298
aVthrough their pollination services.
p299
aVAnd when bees have access to good nutrition,
p300
aVthey're better able to engage their own natural defenses,
p301
aVtheir healthcare,
p302
aVthat they have relied on for millions of years.
p303
aVSo the beauty of helping bees this way, for me,
p304
aVis that every one of us needs to behave
p305
aVa little bit more like a bee society, an insect society,
p306
aVwhere each of our individual actions
p307
aVcan contribute to a grand solution,
p308
aVan emergent property,
p309
aVthat's much greater than the mere sum
p310
aVof our individual actions.
p311
aVSo let the small act of planting flowers
p312
aVand keeping them free of pesticides
p313
aVbe the driver of large-scale change.
p314
aa(lp315
VOn behalf of the bees, thank you.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Applause)
p318
aa(lp319
VChris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question.
p320
aVThe latest numbers on the die-off of bees,
p321
aVis there any sign of things bottoming out?
p322
aVWhat's your hope/depression level on this?
p323
aa(lp324
VMaria Spivak: Yeah.
p325
aVAt least in the United States,
p326
aVan average of 30 percent of all bee hives
p327
aVare lost every winter.
p328
aVAbout 20 years ago,
p329
aVwe were at a 15-percent loss.
p330
aVSo it's getting precarious.
p331
aa(lp332
VCA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's \u2014 MS: Yes, thirty percent a year.
p333
aa(lp334
VCA: Thirty percent a year. MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies
p335
aVand so they can maintain the same number,
p336
aVthey can recuperate some of their loss.
p337
aa(lp338
VWe're kind of at a tipping point.
p339
aVWe can't really afford to lose that many more.
p340
aVWe need to be really appreciative
p341
aVof all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers.
p342
aa(lp343
VCA: Thank you.
p344
aa(lp345

Marla Spivak, University of Minnesota professor of entomology and <a href=\\"http://www.macfound.org/fellows/43/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">2010 MacArthur Fellow</a>, tries as much as possible to think like bees in her work to protect them.

Now, Spivak is studying how bees collect propolis, or tree resins, in their hives to keep out dirt and microbes. She is also analyzing how flowers&rsquo; decline due to herbicides, pesticides and crop monoculture affect bees&rsquo; numbers and diversity.

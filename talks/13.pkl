VFrank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.
p5
aVDr. Mullis was talking about his experiments,
p6
aVand I realized that I almost became a scientist.
p7
aVWhen I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set
p8
aVand I decided to make water.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVSo, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,
p11
aVand I had the two pipes leading into a beaker
p12
aVand I threw a match in.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVAnd the glass \u2014 luckily I turned around \u2014
p15
aVI had it all in my back
p16
aVand I was about 15 feet away.
p17
aVThe wall was covered with ...
p18
aVI had an explosion.
p19
aa(lp20
VRichard Saul Wurman: Really?
p21
aa(lp22
VFG: People on the street came and knocked on the door
p23
aVto see if I was okay.
p24
aVRSW: ... huh. (Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VI'd like to start
p27
aVthis session again.
p28
aVThe gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous,
p29
aVFrank Gehry.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aV(Applause)
p32
aVAnd Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.
p33
aVI mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect,
p34
aVto become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.
p35
aVI mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it
p36
aVbecause it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought,
p37
aVbut your building is an icon \u2014
p38
aVyou can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads \u2014
p39
aVand you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status
p40
aVin doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.
p41
aVAnd I know the road was extremely difficult.
p42
aVAnd it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs,
p43
aVwhatever they were, were very big.
p44
aVYou kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent
p45
aVon working for somebody.
p46
aVBut that's an interesting thing for a creative person.
p47
aVA lot of us work for people;
p48
aVwe're in the hands of other people.
p49
aVAnd that's one of the great dilemmas \u2014 we're in a creativity session \u2014
p50
aVit's one of the great dilemmas in creativity:
p51
aVhow to do work that's big enough and not sell out.
p52
aVAnd you've achieved that
p53
aVand that makes your win doubly big, triply big.
p54
aVIt's not quite a question but you can comment on it.
p55
aVIt's a big issue.
p56
aa(lp57
VFG: Well, I've always just ...
p58
aVI've never really gone out looking for work.
p59
aVI always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.
p60
aVAnd when I started out,
p61
aVI thought that architecture was a service business
p62
aVand that you had to please the clients and stuff.
p63
aVAnd I realized when I'd come into the meetings
p64
aVwith these corrugated metal and chain link stuff,
p65
aVand people would just look at me
p66
aVlike I'd just landed from Mars.
p67
aVBut I couldn't do anything else.
p68
aVThat was my response to the people in the time.
p69
aVAnd actually, it was responding to clients that I had
p70
aVwho didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.
p71
aVI think it was circumstantial.
p72
aa(lp73
VUntil I got to my house, where the client was my wife.
p74
aVWe bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica
p75
aVand for like 50 grand I built a house around it.
p76
aVAnd a few people got excited about it.
p77
aVI was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer,
p78
aVout in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.
p79
aVHe's building this huge concrete place.
p80
aVAnd it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.
p81
aVWe were standing out in the desert all alone and,
p82
aVthinking about my house, he said,
p83
aV"Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent,
p84
aVsomewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVSo, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
p87
aVLuckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money,
p88
aVso the stuff was a little more permanent.
p89
aVBut I just found out the world ain't going to last that long,
p90
aVthis guy was telling us the other day.
p91
aVSo where do we go now?
p92
aVBack to \u2014 everything's so temporary.
p93
aa(lp94
VI don't see it the way you characterized it.
p95
aVFor me, every day is a new thing.
p96
aVI approach each project with a new insecurity,
p97
aValmost like the first project I ever did,
p98
aVand I get the sweats,
p99
aVI go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going \u2014
p100
aVif I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.
p101
aVWhen I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.
p102
aVI discard it.
p103
aVSo I approach it with the same trepidation.
p104
aVObviously, over time I have a lot more confidence
p105
aVthat it's going to be OK.
p106
aVI do run a kind of a business \u2014
p107
aVI've got 120 people
p108
aVand you've got to pay them,
p109
aVso there's a lot of responsibility involved \u2014
p110
aVbut the actual work on the project is with,
p111
aVI think, a healthy insecurity.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd like the playwright said the other day \u2014 I could relate to him:
p114
aVyou're not sure.
p115
aVWhen Bilbao was finished and I looked at it,
p116
aVI saw all the mistakes, I saw ...
p117
aVThey weren't mistakes;
p118
aVI saw everything that I would have changed
p119
aVand I was embarrassed by it.
p120
aVI felt an embarrassment \u2014 "How could I have done that?
p121
aVHow could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"
p122
aVIt's taken several years to now look at it detached and say \u2014
p123
aVas you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road
p124
aVand the street, and it appears to have a relationship \u2014
p125
aVthat I started to like it.
p126
aa(lp127
VRSW: What's the status of the New York project?
p128
aa(lp129
VFG: I don't really know.
p130
aVTom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me,
p131
aVand I thought he was nuts.
p132
aVI didn't think he knew what he was doing,
p133
aVand he pulled it off.
p134
aVSo, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVHe gets up there and then he ... comes back up.
p137
aVThey're still talking about it.
p138
aVSeptember 11 generated some interest
p139
aVin moving it over to Ground Zero,
p140
aVand I'm totally against that.
p141
aVI just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero
p142
aVI think for a long time.
p143
aa(lp144
VRSW: The picture on the screen,
p145
aVis that Disney?
p146
aa(lp147
VFG: Yeah.
p148
aa(lp149
VRSW: How much further along is it than that,
p150
aVand when will that be finished?
p151
aa(lp152
VFG: That will be finished in 2003 \u2014 September, October \u2014
p153
aVand I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys
p154
aVcome play with us at that place.
p155
aVLuckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.
p156
aVRichard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons
p157
aVthat Disney Hall came to me.
p158
aVHe's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.
p159
aVThere aren't many people around that are really involved
p160
aVwith architecture as clients.
p161
aVIf you think about the world,
p162
aVand even just in this audience,
p163
aVmost of us are involved with buildings.
p164
aVNothing that you would call architecture, right?
p165
aVAnd so to find one, a guy like that,
p166
aVyou hang on to him.
p167
aVHe's become the head of Art Center,
p168
aVand there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.
p169
aVI knew Craig and respected him.
p170
aVThey want to add to it
p171
aVand it's hard to add to a building like that \u2014
p172
aVit's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building \u2014
p173
aVand Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff
p174
aVand it's a lot of acreage.
p175
aVI convinced him to let me bring in another architect
p176
aVfrom Portugal: Alvaro Siza.
p177
aa(lp178
VRSW: Why did you want that?
p179
aa(lp180
VFG: I knew you'd ask that question.
p181
aa(lp182
VIt was intuitive.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VAlvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal
p186
aVand is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.
p187
aVI visited with him a few years ago
p188
aVand he showed me his early work,
p189
aVand his early work had a resemblance to my early work.
p190
aVWhen I came out of college,
p191
aVI started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,
p192
aVand you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs
p193
aVand things like that.
p194
aVI tried to understand that language as a beginning,
p195
aVas a place to jump off,
p196
aVand there was so much of it being done by spec builders
p197
aVand it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...
p198
aVI just stopped.
p199
aVI mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it,
p200
aVbut it didn't feel good to me.
p201
aVSiza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal
p202
aVwhere the real stuff was
p203
aVand evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.
p204
aVAnd I always felt that he should come to Southern California
p205
aVand do a building.
p206
aVI tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.
p207
aVI like the idea of collaboration with people like that
p208
aVbecause it pushes you.
p209
aVI've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra,
p210
aVwho doesn't think architecture is art.
p211
aVDid you see that thing?
p212
aVRSW: No. What did he say?
p213
aa(lp214
VFG: He calls architecture "plumbing."
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VFG: Anyway, the Siza thing.
p218
aVIt's a richer experience.
p219
aVIt must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians \u2014
p220
aVit's similar to that I would imagine \u2014
p221
aVwhere you ... huh?
p222
aa(lp223
VAudience: Liquid architecture.
p224
aa(lp225
VFG: Liquid architecture.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVWhere you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together,
p228
aVyou play off each other, you make something,
p229
aVthey make something.
p230
aVAnd I think
p231
aVfor me, it's a way of trying to understand the city
p232
aVand what might happen in the city.
p233
aa(lp234
VRSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?
p235
aVOr is it going to be down near ...
p236
aa(lp237
VFG: No, it's near the current campus.
p238
aVAnyway, he's that kind of patron.
p239
aVIt's not his money, of course.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VRSW: What's his schedule on that?
p243
aa(lp244
VFG: I don't know.
p245
aVWhat's the schedule, Richard?
p246
aVRichard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.
p247
aa(lp248
VFG: 2004.
p249
aVYou can come to the opening. I'll invite you.
p250
aVNo, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting
p251
aVbecause it creates chaos, right?
p252
aVEverybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment,
p253
aVand if you can figure out how to work off each other \u2014
p254
aVif you can get a bunch of people
p255
aVwho respect each other's work and play off each other,
p256
aVyou might be able to create models for
p257
aVhow to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.
p258
aVLike the Rockefeller Center model,
p259
aVwhich is kind of from another era.
p260
aa(lp261
VRSW: I found the most remarkable thing.
p262
aVMy preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building,
p263
aVyou go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.
p264
aVI'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.
p265
aVThe surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.
p266
aVThat was the surprise of going across the river,
p267
aVof going on the highway around it,
p268
aVof walking down the street and finding it.
p269
aVThat was the real surprise of Bilbao.
p270
aa(lp271
VFG: But you know, Richard,
p272
aVmost architects when they present their work \u2014
p273
aVmost of the people we know,
p274
aVyou get up and you talk about your work,
p275
aVand it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy
p276
aVby saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context,
p277
aVI'm worried about the city,
p278
aVI'm worried about my client,
p279
aVI worry about budget, that I'm on time."
p280
aVBlah, blah, blah and all that stuff.
p281
aVAnd it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...
p282
aVby saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.
p283
aVAnd I think everybody \u2014
p284
aVI mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.
p285
aVYou're not going to defy gravity.
p286
aVYou've got to work with the building department.
p287
aVIf you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.
p288
aVIf it leaks \u2014
p289
aVBilbao did not leak.
p290
aVI was so proud.
p291
aV(Laughter)
p292
aVThe MIT project \u2014 they were interviewing me for MIT
p293
aVand they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.
p294
aVI met them in Bilbao.
p295
aVThey came for three days.
p296
aa(lp297
VRSW: This is the computer building?
p298
aa(lp299
VFG: Yeah, the computer building.
p300
aVThey were there three days and it rained every day
p301
aVand they kept walking around \u2014
p302
aVI noticed they were looking under things
p303
aVand looking for things,
p304
aVand they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?
p305
aVPeople put buckets out ...
p306
aVI was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place,
p307
aVit was just fantastic.
p308
aVBut you've got to \u2014
p309
aVyeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...
p310
aV(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VRSW: Frank had a sort of ...
p313
aa(lp314
VFG: Ask Miriam!
p315
aa(lp316
VRW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.
p317
aV(Laughter)
p318
aa(lp319
VFG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story,
p320
aVwhen the woman called and said,
p321
aV"Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch
p322
aVand the water's pouring in on my head."
p323
aVAnd he said, "Madam, move your chair."
p324
aV(Laughter)
p325
aVSo, some years later I was doing a building,
p326
aVa little house on the beach for Norton Simon,
p327
aVand his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady,
p328
aVcalled me and said,
p329
aV"Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk
p330
aVand the water's coming in on his head."
p331
aVAnd I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.
p332
aa(lp333
VRSW: Didn't get a laugh.
p334
aa(lp335
VFG: No. Not now either.
p336
aV(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VBut my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?"
p339
aVOK, you solved all the problems,
p340
aVyou did all the stuff, you made nice,
p341
aVyou loved your clients,
p342
aVyou loved the city,
p343
aVyou're a good guy, you're a good person ...
p344
aVand then what?
p345
aVWhat do you bring to it?
p346
aVAnd I think that's what I've always been interested in,
p347
aVis that \u2014 which is a personal kind of expression.
p348
aVBilbao, I think, shows that you can have
p349
aVthat kind of personal expression
p350
aVand still touch all the bases that are necessary
p351
aVof fitting into the city.
p352
aVThat's what reminded me of it.
p353
aVAnd I think that's the issue, you know;
p354
aVit's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects \u2014
p355
aVmost clients aren't hiring architects for that.
p356
aVThey're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget,
p357
aVbe polite,
p358
aVand they're missing out on the real value of an architect.
p359
aa(lp360
VRSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people \u2014
p361
aVwhen Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...
p362
aa(lp363
VFG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
VRSW: Did it leak?
p367
aa(lp368
VFG: No.
p369
aV(Laughter)
p370
aa(lp371
VRSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.
p372
aVIs that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?
p373
aa(lp374
VFG: Yeah.
p375
aVSince Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years,
p376
aVboth Krens and I have been called
p377
aVwith at least 100 opportunities \u2014
p378
aVChina, Brazil, other parts of Spain \u2014
p379
aVto come in and do the Bilbao effect.
p380
aVAnd I've met with some of these people.
p381
aVUsually I say no right away,
p382
aVbut some of them come with pedigree
p383
aVand they sound well-intentioned
p384
aVand they get you for at least one or two meetings.
p385
aVIn one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team
p386
aVbecause the thing was signed with seals and various
p387
aVvery official seals from the city,
p388
aVand that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.
p389
aVI asked them what kind of building it was.
p390
aV"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.
p391
aVSo four of us went.
p392
aVAnd they took us \u2014 they put us up in a great hotel
p393
aVand we were looking over the bay,
p394
aVand then they took us in a boat out in the water
p395
aVand showed us all these sights in the harbor.
p396
aVEach one was more beautiful than the other.
p397
aVAnd then we were going to have lunch with the mayor
p398
aVand we were going to have dinner with
p399
aVthe most important people in Malaga.
p400
aVJust before going to lunch with the mayor,
p401
aVwe went to the harbor commissioner.
p402
aVIt was a table as long as this carpet
p403
aVand the harbor commissioner was here,
p404
aVand I was here, and my guys.
p405
aVWe sat down, and we had a drink of water
p406
aVand everybody was quiet.
p407
aVAnd the guy looked at me and said,
p408
aV"Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"
p409
aV(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VRSW: Oh, my God.
p412
aVFG: So, I got up.
p413
aVI said to my team,
p414
aV"Let's get out of here."
p415
aVWe stood up, we walked out.
p416
aVThey followed \u2014 the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said,
p417
aV"You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"
p418
aVI said, "Nope."
p419
aV"You're not going to have dinner at all?"
p420
aVThey just brought us there to hustle this group,
p421
aVyou know, to create a project.
p422
aVAnd we get a lot of that.
p423
aVLuckily, I'm old enough that
p424
aVI can complain I can't travel.
p425
aV(Laughter)
p426
aVI don't have my own plane yet.
p427
aa(lp428
VRSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting
p429
aVbecause it's been very long.
p430
aVBut let me just say a couple words.
p431
aa(lp432
VFG: Can I say something?
p433
aVAre you going to talk about me or you?
p434
aV(Laughter)
p435
aV(Applause)
p436
aa(lp437
VRSW: Once a shit, always a shit!
p438
aa(lp439
VFG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ...
p440
aa(lp441
VRSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!
p442
aV(Laughter)
p443
aa(lp444
VI'm going to make it for you!
p445
aa(lp446
VFG: No, no. Wait a minute!

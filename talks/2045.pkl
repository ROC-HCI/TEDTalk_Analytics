VRight now
p5
aVyou have a movie playing inside your head.
p6
aVIt's an amazing multi-track movie.
p7
aVIt has 3D vision and surround sound
p8
aVfor what you're seeing and hearing right now,
p9
aVbut that's just the start of it.
p10
aVYour movie has smell and taste and touch.
p11
aVIt has a sense of your body,
p12
aVpain, hunger, orgasms.
p13
aVIt has emotions,
p14
aVanger and happiness.
p15
aVIt has memories, like scenes from your childhood
p16
aVplaying before you.
p17
aVAnd it has this constant voiceover narrative
p18
aVin your stream of conscious thinking.
p19
aVAt the heart of this movie is you
p20
aVexperiencing all this directly.
p21
aVThis movie is your stream of consciousness,
p22
aVthe subject of experience
p23
aVof the mind and the world.
p24
aa(lp25
VConsciousness is one of the fundamental facts
p26
aVof human existence.
p27
aVEach of us is conscious.
p28
aVWe all have our own inner movie,
p29
aVyou and you and you.
p30
aVThere's nothing we know about more directly.
p31
aVAt least, I know about my consciousness directly.
p32
aVI can't be certain that you guys are conscious.
p33
aa(lp34
VConsciousness also is what makes life worth living.
p35
aVIf we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives
p36
aVwould have meaning or value.
p37
aVBut at the same time, it's the most
p38
aVmysterious phenomenon in the universe.
p39
aVWhy are we conscious?
p40
aVWhy do we have these inner movies?
p41
aVWhy aren't we just robots
p42
aVwho process all this input,
p43
aVproduce all that output,
p44
aVwithout experiencing the inner movie at all?
p45
aVRight now, nobody knows the answers
p46
aVto those questions.
p47
aVI'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness
p48
aVinto science, some radical ideas may be needed.
p49
aa(lp50
VSome people say a science of consciousness
p51
aVis impossible.
p52
aVScience, by its nature, is objective.
p53
aVConsciousness, by its nature, is subjective.
p54
aVSo there can never be a science of consciousness.
p55
aVFor much of the 20th century, that view held sway.
p56
aVPsychologists studied behavior objectively,
p57
aVneuroscientists studied the brain objectively,
p58
aVand nobody even mentioned consciousness.
p59
aVEven 30 years ago, when TED got started,
p60
aVthere was very little scientific work
p61
aVon consciousness.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, about 20 years ago,
p64
aVall that began to change.
p65
aVNeuroscientists like Francis Crick
p66
aVand physicists like Roger Penrose
p67
aVsaid now is the time for science
p68
aVto attack consciousness.
p69
aVAnd since then, there's been a real explosion,
p70
aVa flowering of scientific work
p71
aVon consciousness.
p72
aVAnd this work has been wonderful. It's been great.
p73
aVBut it also has some fundamental
p74
aVlimitations so far.
p75
aVThe centerpiece
p76
aVof the science of consciousness in recent years
p77
aVhas been the search for correlations,
p78
aVcorrelations between certain areas of the brain
p79
aVand certain states of consciousness.
p80
aVWe saw some of this kind of work
p81
aVfrom Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work
p82
aVshe presented just a few minutes ago.
p83
aVNow we understand much better, for example,
p84
aVthe kinds of brain areas that go along with
p85
aVthe conscious experience of seeing faces
p86
aVor of feeling pain
p87
aVor of feeling happy.
p88
aVBut this is still a science of correlations.
p89
aVIt's not a science of explanations.
p90
aVWe know that these brain areas
p91
aVgo along with certain kinds of conscious experience,
p92
aVbut we don't know why they do.
p93
aVI like to put this by saying
p94
aVthat this kind of work from neuroscience
p95
aVis answering some of the questions
p96
aVwe want answered about consciousness,
p97
aVthe questions about what certain brain areas do
p98
aVand what they correlate with.
p99
aVBut in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.
p100
aVNo knock on the neuroscientists.
p101
aVThere are no truly easy problems with consciousness.
p102
aVBut it doesn't address the real mystery
p103
aVat the core of this subject:
p104
aVwhy is it that all that physical processing in a brain
p105
aVshould be accompanied by consciousness at all?
p106
aVWhy is there this inner subjective movie?
p107
aVRight now, we don't really have a bead on that.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd you might say,
p110
aVlet's just give neuroscience a few years.
p111
aVIt'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon
p112
aVlike traffic jams, like hurricanes,
p113
aVlike life, and we'll figure it out.
p114
aVThe classical cases of emergence
p115
aVare all cases of emergent behavior,
p116
aVhow a traffic jam behaves,
p117
aVhow a hurricane functions,
p118
aVhow a living organism reproduces
p119
aVand adapts and metabolizes,
p120
aVall questions about objective functioning.
p121
aVYou could apply that to the human brain
p122
aVin explaining some of the behaviors
p123
aVand the functions of the human brain
p124
aVas emergent phenomena:
p125
aVhow we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,
p126
aVall these questions about behavior.
p127
aVBut when it comes to consciousness,
p128
aVquestions about behavior
p129
aVare among the easy problems.
p130
aVWhen it comes to the hard problem,
p131
aVthat's the question of why is it
p132
aVthat all this behavior
p133
aVis accompanied by subjective experience?
p134
aVAnd here, the standard paradigm
p135
aVof emergence,
p136
aVeven the standard paradigms of neuroscience,
p137
aVdon't really, so far, have that much to say.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.
p140
aVI want a scientific theory of consciousness
p141
aVthat works,
p142
aVand for a long time, I banged my head
p143
aVagainst the wall
p144
aVlooking for a theory of consciousness
p145
aVin purely physical terms
p146
aVthat would work.
p147
aVBut I eventually came to the conclusion
p148
aVthat that just didn't work for systematic reasons.
p149
aVIt's a long story,
p150
aVbut the core idea is just that what you get
p151
aVfrom purely reductionist explanations
p152
aVin physical terms, in brain-based terms,
p153
aVis stories about the functioning of a system,
p154
aVits structure, its dynamics,
p155
aVthe behavior it produces,
p156
aVgreat for solving the easy problems \u2014
p157
aVhow we behave, how we function \u2014
p158
aVbut when it comes to subjective experience \u2014
p159
aVwhy does all this feel like something from the inside? \u2014
p160
aVthat's something fundamentally new,
p161
aVand it's always a further question.
p162
aVSo I think we're at a kind of impasse here.
p163
aVWe've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,
p164
aVwe're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,
p165
aVchemistry explains biology,
p166
aVbiology explains parts of psychology.
p167
aVBut consciousness
p168
aVdoesn't seem to fit into this picture.
p169
aVOn the one hand, it's a datum
p170
aVthat we're conscious.
p171
aVOn the other hand, we don't know how
p172
aVto accommodate it into our scientific view of the world.
p173
aVSo I think consciousness right now
p174
aVis a kind of anomaly,
p175
aVone that we need to integrate
p176
aVinto our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.
p177
aVFaced with an anomaly like this,
p178
aVradical ideas may be needed,
p179
aVand I think that we may need one or two ideas
p180
aVthat initially seem crazy
p181
aVbefore we can come to grips with consciousness
p182
aVscientifically.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, there are a few candidates
p185
aVfor what those crazy ideas might be.
p186
aVMy friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
p187
aVHis crazy idea is that there is no hard problem
p188
aVof consciousness.
p189
aVThe whole idea of the inner subjective movie
p190
aVinvolves a kind of illusion or confusion.
p191
aVActually, all we've got to do is explain
p192
aVthe objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,
p193
aVand then we've explained everything
p194
aVthat needs to be explained.
p195
aVWell I say, more power to him.
p196
aVThat's the kind of radical idea
p197
aVthat we need to explore
p198
aVif you want to have a purely reductionist
p199
aVbrain-based theory of consciousness.
p200
aVAt the same time, for me and for many other people,
p201
aVthat view is a bit too close to simply
p202
aVdenying the datum of consciousness
p203
aVto be satisfactory.
p204
aVSo I go in a different direction.
p205
aVIn the time remaining,
p206
aVI want to explore two crazy ideas
p207
aVthat I think may have some promise.
p208
aa(lp209
VThe first crazy idea
p210
aVis that consciousness is fundamental.
p211
aVPhysicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe
p212
aVas fundamental building blocks:
p213
aVspace and time and mass.
p214
aVThey postulate fundamental laws governing them,
p215
aVlike the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.
p216
aVThese fundamental properties and laws
p217
aVaren't explained in terms of anything more basic.
p218
aVRather, they're taken as primitive,
p219
aVand you build up the world from there.
p220
aVNow sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.
p221
aVIn the 19th century, Maxwell figured out
p222
aVthat you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena
p223
aVin terms of the existing fundamentals \u2014
p224
aVspace, time, mass, Newton's laws \u2014
p225
aVso he postulated fundamental laws
p226
aVof electromagnetism
p227
aVand postulated electric charge
p228
aVas a fundamental element
p229
aVthat those laws govern.
p230
aVI think that's the situation we're in
p231
aVwith consciousness.
p232
aVIf you can't explain consciousness
p233
aVin terms of the existing fundamentals \u2014
p234
aVspace, time, mass, charge \u2014
p235
aVthen as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.
p236
aVThe natural thing to do is to postulate
p237
aVconsciousness itself as something fundamental,
p238
aVa fundamental building block of nature.
p239
aVThis doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.
p240
aVThis opens up the way for you to do science with it.
p241
aVWhat we then need is to study
p242
aVthe fundamental laws governing consciousness,
p243
aVthe laws that connect consciousness
p244
aVto other fundamentals: space, time, mass,
p245
aVphysical processes.
p246
aVPhysicists sometimes say
p247
aVthat we want fundamental laws so simple
p248
aVthat we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
p249
aVWell I think something like that is the situation
p250
aVwe're in with consciousness.
p251
aVWe want to find fundamental laws so simple
p252
aVwe could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
p253
aVWe don't know what those laws are yet,
p254
aVbut that's what we're after.
p255
aa(lp256
VThe second crazy idea
p257
aVis that consciousness might be universal.
p258
aVEvery system might have some degree
p259
aVof consciousness.
p260
aVThis view is sometimes called panpsychism:
p261
aVpan for all, psych for mind,
p262
aVevery system is conscious,
p263
aVnot just humans, dogs, mice, flies,
p264
aVbut even Rob Knight's microbes,
p265
aVelementary particles.
p266
aVEven a photon has some degree of consciousness.
p267
aVThe idea is not that photons are intelligent
p268
aVor thinking.
p269
aVIt's not that a photon
p270
aVis wracked with angst
p271
aVbecause it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light.
p272
aVI never get to slow down and smell the roses."
p273
aVNo, not like that.
p274
aVBut the thought is maybe photons might have
p275
aVsome element of raw, subjective feeling,
p276
aVsome primitive precursor to consciousness.
p277
aa(lp278
VThis may sound a bit kooky to you.
p279
aVI mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?
p280
aVSome motivation comes from the first crazy idea,
p281
aVthat consciousness is fundamental.
p282
aVIf it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,
p283
aVit's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,
p284
aVthe way they are.
p285
aVIt's also worth noting that although the idea
p286
aVseems counterintuitive to us,
p287
aVit's much less counterintuitive to people
p288
aVfrom different cultures,
p289
aVwhere the human mind is seen as much more
p290
aVcontinuous with nature.
p291
aa(lp292
VA deeper motivation comes from the idea that
p293
aVperhaps the most simple and powerful way
p294
aVto find fundamental laws connecting consciousness
p295
aVto physical processing
p296
aVis to link consciousness to information.
p297
aVWherever there's information processing,
p298
aVthere's consciousness.
p299
aVComplex information processing, like in a human,
p300
aVcomplex consciousness.
p301
aVSimple information processing,
p302
aVsimple consciousness.
p303
aa(lp304
VA really exciting thing is in recent years
p305
aVa neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,
p306
aVhas taken this kind of theory
p307
aVand developed it rigorously
p308
aVwith a mathematical theory.
p309
aVHe has a mathematical measure
p310
aVof information integration
p311
aVwhich he calls phi,
p312
aVmeasuring the amount of information
p313
aVintegrated in a system.
p314
aVAnd he supposes that phi goes along
p315
aVwith consciousness.
p316
aVSo in a human brain,
p317
aVincredibly large amount of information integration,
p318
aVhigh degree of phi,
p319
aVa whole lot of consciousness.
p320
aVIn a mouse, medium degree of information integration,
p321
aVstill pretty significant,
p322
aVpretty serious amount of consciousness.
p323
aVBut as you go down to worms,
p324
aVmicrobes, particles,
p325
aVthe amount of phi falls off.
p326
aVThe amount of information integration falls off,
p327
aVbut it's still non-zero.
p328
aVOn Tononi's theory,
p329
aVthere's still going to be a non-zero degree
p330
aVof consciousness.
p331
aVIn effect, he's proposing a fundamental law
p332
aVof consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
p333
aVNow, I don't know if this theory is right,
p334
aVbut it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now
p335
aVin the science of consciousness,
p336
aVand it's been used to integrate a whole range
p337
aVof scientific data,
p338
aVand it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough
p339
aVyou can write it on the front of a t-shirt.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnother final motivation is that
p342
aVpanpsychism might help us to integrate
p343
aVconsciousness into the physical world.
p344
aVPhysicists and philosophers have often observed
p345
aVthat physics is curiously abstract.
p346
aVIt describes the structure of reality
p347
aVusing a bunch of equations,
p348
aVbut it doesn't tell us about the reality
p349
aVthat underlies it.
p350
aVAs Stephen Hawking puts it,
p351
aVwhat puts the fire into the equations?
p352
aVWell, on the panpsychist view,
p353
aVyou can leave the equations of physics as they are,
p354
aVbut you can take them to be describing
p355
aVthe flux of consciousness.
p356
aVThat's what physics really is ultimately doing,
p357
aVdescribing the flux of consciousness.
p358
aVOn this view, it's consciousness
p359
aVthat puts the fire into the equations.
p360
aVOn that view, consciousness doesn't dangle
p361
aVoutside the physical world
p362
aVas some kind of extra.
p363
aVIt's there right at its heart.
p364
aa(lp365
VThis view, I think, the panpsychist view,
p366
aVhas the potential to transfigure our relationship
p367
aVto nature,
p368
aVand it may have some pretty serious social
p369
aVand ethical consequences.
p370
aVSome of these may be counterintuitive.
p371
aVI used to think I shouldn't eat anything
p372
aVwhich is conscious,
p373
aVso therefore I should be vegetarian.
p374
aVNow, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,
p375
aVyou're going to go very hungry.
p376
aVSo I think when you think about it,
p377
aVthis tends to transfigure your views,
p378
aVwhereas what matters for ethical purposes
p379
aVand moral considerations,
p380
aVnot so much the fact of consciousness,
p381
aVbut the degree and the complexity of consciousness.
p382
aa(lp383
VIt's also natural to ask about consciousness
p384
aVin other systems, like computers.
p385
aVWhat about the artificially intelligent system
p386
aVin the movie "Her," Samantha?
p387
aVIs she conscious?
p388
aVWell, if you take the informational,
p389
aVpanpsychist view,
p390
aVshe certainly has complicated information processing
p391
aVand integration,
p392
aVso the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.
p393
aVIf that's right, it raises pretty serious
p394
aVethical issues about both the ethics
p395
aVof developing intelligent computer systems
p396
aVand the ethics of turning them off.
p397
aa(lp398
VFinally, you might ask about the consciousness
p399
aVof whole groups,
p400
aVthe planet.
p401
aVDoes Canada have its own consciousness?
p402
aVOr at a more local level,
p403
aVdoes an integrated group
p404
aVlike the audience at a TED conference,
p405
aVare we right now having a collective TED consciousness,
p406
aVan inner movie
p407
aVfor this collective TED group
p408
aVwhich is distinct from the inner movies
p409
aVof each of our parts?
p410
aVI don't know the answer to that question,
p411
aVbut I think it's at least one
p412
aVworth taking seriously.
p413
aa(lp414
VOkay, so this panpsychist vision,
p415
aVit is a radical one,
p416
aVand I don't know that it's correct.
p417
aVI'm actually more confident about
p418
aVthe first crazy idea,
p419
aVthat consciousness is fundamental,
p420
aVthan about the second one,
p421
aVthat it's universal.
p422
aVI mean, the view raises any number of questions,
p423
aVhas any number of challenges,
p424
aVlike how do those little bits
p425
aVof consciousness add up
p426
aVto the kind of complex consciousness
p427
aVwe know and love.
p428
aVIf we can answer those questions,
p429
aVthen I think we're going to be well on our way
p430
aVto a serious theory of consciousness.
p431
aVIf not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps
p432
aVin science and philosophy.
p433
aVWe can't expect to solve it overnight.
p434
aVBut I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.
p435
aVUnderstanding consciousness is a real key, I think,
p436
aVboth to understanding the universe
p437
aVand to understanding ourselves.
p438
aVIt may just take the right crazy idea.
p439

VI have a confession to make.
p5
aVAs a scientist and engineer, I've focused on efficiency for many years.
p6
aVBut efficiency can be a cult,
p7
aVand today I'd like to tell you about a journey
p8
aVthat moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality.
p9
aa(lp10
VA few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D.  in London, I moved to Boston.
p11
aVI lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge.
p12
aVI bought a racing bicycle that summer,
p13
aVand I bicycled every day to work.
p14
aVTo find my way, I used my phone.
p15
aVIt sent me over Mass. Ave., Massachusetts Avenue,
p16
aVthe shortest route from Boston to Cambridge.
p17
aVBut after a month
p18
aVthat I was cycling every day on the car-packed Mass. Ave.,
p19
aVI took a different route one day.
p20
aVI'm not entirely sure why I took a different route that day, a detour.
p21
aVI just remember a feeling of surprise;
p22
aVsurprise at finding a street with no cars,
p23
aVas opposed to the nearby Mass. Ave. full of cars;
p24
aVsurprise at finding a street  draped by leaves and surrounded by trees.
p25
aVBut after the feeling  of surprise, I felt shame.
p26
aVHow could I have been so blind?
p27
aVFor an entire month,
p28
aVI was so trapped in my mobile app
p29
aVthat a journey to work became one thing only:
p30
aVthe shortest path.
p31
aVIn this single journey, there was no thought
p32
aVof enjoying the road,
p33
aVno pleasure in connecting with nature,
p34
aVno possibility of looking people in the eyes.
p35
aVAnd why?
p36
aVBecause I was saving a minute out of my commute.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow let me ask you: Am I alone here?
p39
aVHow many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions?
p40
aVMost of you, if not all, have.
p41
aVAnd don't get me wrong \u2014 mapping apps are the greatest game-changer
p42
aVfor encouraging people to explore the city.
p43
aVYou take your phone out and you know immediately where to go.
p44
aVHowever, the app also assumes
p45
aVthere are only a handful of directions to the destination.
p46
aVIt has the power to make those handful of directions
p47
aVthe definitive direction to that destination.
p48
aa(lp49
VAfter that experience, I changed.
p50
aVI changed my research from traditional data-mining
p51
aVto understanding how people experience the city.
p52
aVI used computer science tools
p53
aVto replicate social science experiments at scale, at web scale.
p54
aVI became captivated by the beauty and genius
p55
aVof traditional social science experiments
p56
aVdone by Jane Jacobs, Stanley Milgram, Kevin Lynch.
p57
aVThe result of that research has been the creation of new maps,
p58
aVmaps where you don't only find the shortest path, the blue one,
p59
aVbut also the most enjoyable path,
p60
aVthe red one.
p61
aVHow was that possible?
p62
aa(lp63
VEinstein once said,
p64
aV"Logic will get you from A to B.
p65
aVImagination will take you everywhere."
p66
aVSo with a bit of imagination,
p67
aVwe needed to understand
p68
aVwhich parts of the city people find beautiful.
p69
aVAt the University of Cambridge, with colleagues,
p70
aVwe thought about this simple experiment.
p71
aVIf I were to show you these two urban scenes,
p72
aVand I were to ask you which one is more beautiful,
p73
aVwhich one would you say?
p74
aVDon't be shy.
p75
aVWho says A? Who says B?
p76
aVBrilliant.
p77
aVBased on that idea,
p78
aVwe built a crowdsourcing platform,
p79
aVa web game.
p80
aVPlayers are shown pairs of urban scenes,
p81
aVand they're asked to choose which one  is more beautiful, quiet and happy.
p82
aVBased on thousands of user votes,
p83
aVthen we are able to see where consensus emerges.
p84
aVWe are able to see which are the urban scenes
p85
aVthat make people happy.
p86
aa(lp87
VAfter that work, I joined Yahoo Labs,
p88
aVand I teamed up with Luca and Rossano,
p89
aVand together, we aggregated those winning locations in London
p90
aVto build a new map of the city,
p91
aVa cartography weighted for human emotions.
p92
aVOn this cartography, you're not only able to see and connect
p93
aVfrom point A to point B  the shortest segments,
p94
aVbut you're also able to see the happy segment,
p95
aVthe beautiful path, the quiet path.
p96
aVIn tests, participants found the happy, the beautiful, the quiet path
p97
aVfar more enjoyable than the shortest one,
p98
aVand that just by adding a few minutes to travel time.
p99
aVParticipants also love to attach memories to places.
p100
aVShared memories \u2014 that's where the old BBC building was;
p101
aVand personal memories \u2014 that's where I gave my first kiss.
p102
aVThey also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded.
p103
aVSo what if we had a mapping tool
p104
aVthat would return the most enjoyable routes
p105
aVbased not only on aesthetics
p106
aVbut also based on smell, sound,  and memories?
p107
aVThat's where our research is going right now.
p108
aVMore generally, my research,
p109
aVwhat it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path,
p110
aVto avoid robbing people of fully experiencing the city in which they live.
p111
aVWalk the path through the park, not through the car park,
p112
aVand you have an entirely different path.
p113
aVWalk the path full of people you love
p114
aVand not full of cars,
p115
aVand you have an entirely different path.
p116
aVIt's that simple.
p117
aa(lp118
VI would like to end with this thought:
p119
aVdo you remember "The Truman Show?"
p120
aVIt's a media satire in which a real person
p121
aVdoesn't know he's living in a fabricated world.
p122
aVPerhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency.
p123
aVLook at some of your daily habits,
p124
aVand as Truman did in the movie, escape the fabricated world.
p125
aVWhy?
p126
aVWell, if you think that adventure is dangerous, try routine. It's deadly.
p127
aa(lp128
VThank you.

VI am multidisciplinary.
p5
aa(lp6
VAs a scientist, I've been a crew commander for a NASA Mars simulation last year,
p7
aVand as an artist, I create multicultural community art all over the planet.
p8
aVAnd recently, I've actually been combining both.
p9
aVBut let me first talk a little more about that NASA mission.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is the HI-SEAS program.
p12
aVHI-SEAS is a NASA-funded planetary surface analogue
p13
aVon the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii,
p14
aVand it's a research program that is specifically designed
p15
aVto study the effects of long-term isolation of small crews.
p16
aVI lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six,
p17
aVa very interesting experience, of course.
p18
aVWe did all kinds of research.
p19
aVOur main research was actually a food study,
p20
aVbut apart from that food study \u2014
p21
aVdeveloping a new food system for astronauts living in deep space \u2014
p22
aVwe also did all kinds of other research.
p23
aVWe did extra-vehicular activities, as you can see here,
p24
aVwearing mock-up space suits,
p25
aVbut we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do,
p26
aVlike questionnaires at the end of every day.
p27
aVBusy, busy work.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, as you can imagine,
p30
aVit's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people
p31
aVin a small space for a long time.
p32
aVThere's all kinds of psychological challenges:
p33
aVhow to keep a team together in these circumstances;
p34
aVhow to deal with the warping of time you start to sense
p35
aVwhen you're living in these circumstances;
p36
aVsleep problems that arise; etc.
p37
aVBut also we learned a lot.
p38
aVI learned a lot about how individual crew members
p39
aVactually cope with a situation like this;
p40
aVhow you can keep a crew productive and happy,
p41
aVfor example, giving them a good deal of autonomy
p42
aVis a good trick to do that;
p43
aVand honestly, I learned a lot about leadership,
p44
aVbecause I was a crew commander.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo doing this mission,
p47
aVI really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space.
p48
aVWe will venture into outer space, and we will start inhabiting outer space.
p49
aVI have no doubt about it.
p50
aVIt might take 50 years or it might take 500 years,
p51
aVbut it's going to happen nevertheless.
p52
aVSo I came up with a new art project called Seeker.
p53
aVAnd the Seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world
p54
aVto come up with starship prototypes
p55
aVthat re-envision human habitation and survival.
p56
aVThat's the core of the project.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, one important thing:
p59
aVThis is not a dystopian project.
p60
aVThis is not about, "Oh my God, the world is going wrong
p61
aVand we have to escape because we need another future somewhere else."
p62
aVNo, no.
p63
aVThe project is basically inviting people
p64
aVto take a step away from earthbound constraints
p65
aVand, as such, reimagine our future.
p66
aVAnd it's really helpful, and it works really well,
p67
aVso that's really the important part of what we're doing.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, in this project, I'm using a cocreation approach,
p70
aVwhich is a slightly different approach
p71
aVfrom what you would expect from many artists.
p72
aVI'm essentially dropping a basic idea into a group, into a community,
p73
aVpeople start gravitating to the idea,
p74
aVand together, we shape  and build the artwork.
p75
aVIt's a little bit like termites, really.
p76
aVWe just work together,
p77
aVand even, for example, when architects visit what we're doing,
p78
aVsometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding
p79
aVhow we build without a master plan.
p80
aVWe always come up with these fantastic large-scale scupltures
p81
aVthat actually we can also inhabit.
p82
aVThe first version was done in Belgium and Holland.
p83
aVIt was built with a team of almost 50 people.
p84
aVThis is the second iteration of that same project,
p85
aVbut in Slovenia, in a different country,
p86
aVand the new group was like, we're going  to do the architecture differently.
p87
aVSo they took away the architecture, they kept the base of the artwork,
p88
aVand they built an entirely new,
p89
aVmuch more biomorphic architecture on top of that.
p90
aVAnd that's another crucial part of the project.
p91
aVIt's an evolving artwork, evolving architecture.
p92
aVThis was the last version that was just presented a few weeks ago in Holland,
p93
aVwhich was using caravans  as modules to build a starship.
p94
aVWe bought some second-hand caravans,
p95
aVcut them open,
p96
aVand reassembled them into a starship.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, when we're thinking about starships,
p99
aVwe're not just approaching it as a technological challenge.
p100
aVWe're really looking at it as a combination of three systems:
p101
aVecology, people and technology.
p102
aVSo there's always a strong ecological component in the project.
p103
aVHere you can see aquaponic systems
p104
aVthat are actually surrounding the astronauts,
p105
aVso they're constantly in contact with part of the food that they're eating.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow, a very typical thing for this project
p108
aVis that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects.
p109
aVWe actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end,
p110
aVand test what we build.
p111
aVAnd this is, for example,
p112
aVon the right hand side you can see an isolation mission
p113
aVin the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana in Slovenia,
p114
aVwhere six artists and designers locked themselves up \u2014
p115
aVI was part of that \u2014
p116
aVfor four days inside the museum.
p117
aVAnd, of course, obviously, this is a very performative
p118
aVand very strong experience for all of us.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, the next version of the project is currently being developed
p121
aVtogether with Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran, who is also a TED Fellow,
p122
aVin the Atacama Desert in Chile, a magical place.
p123
aVFirst of all, it's really considered a Mars analogue.
p124
aVIt really does look like Mars in certain locations
p125
aVand has been used by NASA to test equipment.
p126
aVAnd it has a long history of being connected to space
p127
aVthrough observations of the stars.
p128
aVIt's now home to ALMA,
p129
aVthe large telescope that's being developed there.
p130
aVBut also, it's the driest location on the planet,
p131
aVand that makes it extremely interesting to build our project,
p132
aVbecause suddenly, sustainability is something we have to explore fully.
p133
aVWe have no other option,
p134
aVso I'm very curious to see what's going to happen.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, a specific thing for this particular version of the project
p137
aVis that I'm very interested to see
p138
aVhow we can connect with the local population,
p139
aVthe native population.
p140
aVThese people have been living there for a very long time
p141
aVand can be considered experts in sustainability,
p142
aVand so I'm very interested to see what we can learn from them,
p143
aVand have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo we're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space
p146
aVby exploring integration, biology, technology and people;
p147
aVby using a cocreation approach;
p148
aVand by using and exploring local traditions
p149
aVand to see how we can learn from the past and integrate that into our deep future.
p150
aa(lp151
VThank you.

looking for someone who embodies &quot;multidisciplinary,&quot; look no further than TED Senior Fellow Angelo Vermeulen, a space systems researcher, biologist, artist  and community organizer. The one common thread in all his work: the desire to understand the relationship between nature and technology, to learn from what&#39;s happened in the past in order to build a promising future for us all.&nbsp;</p><p>Having received his PhD in Biology from the University of Leuven in Belgium, Angelo nonetheless eschewed a life in the lab to apply a creative lens to everything he does. To date, that includes working on independent projects around the world, including Biomodd, a worldwide series of interactive art installations in which technology and nature coexist. Throughout 2011, he was a member of the European Space Agency Topical Team Arts  &amp; Science (ETTAS), while  in 2013 he was crew commander of the  NASA-funded HI-SEAS Mars mission  simulation in Hawaii. For this project, he and a crew of six astronauts lived for four months in a dome, all in the name of studying the effects of longterm isolation among a small crew. </p><p>In 2009 he launched SEAD (Space  Ecologies Art and Design), a platform for research on the architectures and  ethics of space colonization. In 2014, he launched Seeker, a project calling for the public to co-create starship sculptures that evolve over time; this subject is also the focus of a new PhD at Delft University of  Technology, for which he&#39;s developing &quot;paradigm-shifting concepts for evolvable  starships.&quot;</p><p>In 2012  he was a Michael Kalil Endowment for Smart Design Fellow at Parsons in  New York. He holds  positions at LUCA School of Visual Arts in Ghent, Belgium, and Die  Angewandte in Vienna, Austria.</p>", "slug": "angelo_vermeulen", "whotheyare": "Angelo Vermeulen wears many hats, including one as a crew commander for NASA, another as an artist and community organizer.

After all rational attempts to fix a broken bike engine have failed, he notes, recalling a passage from the book, there often comes a moment when you let \\"go of this desire to solve it in a very rational way and just stare at the engine. ... And then, suddenly, a little idea will pop up ... and before you know it, you\'re into it, and you get the problem solved.\\" \\"The book showed me you don\'t have to choose between the rational and the intuitive,\\" he says. \\"It\'s so important, all the training you have, all the ideas you have, to keep them together somehow and to accept everything. ... That\'s what got my creativity kick-started again.\\"", "id": 2257, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/9018b81df86c60fa684c3488f22161311b96b69c_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "How to go to

VThere is an ancient proverb that says
p5
aVit's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room,
p6
aVespecially when there is no cat.
p7
aVI find this a particularly apt description of science
p8
aVand how science works \u2014
p9
aVbumbling around in a dark room, bumping into things,
p10
aVtrying to figure out what shape this might be,
p11
aVwhat that might be,
p12
aVthere are reports of a cat somewhere around,
p13
aVthey may not be reliable, they may be,
p14
aVand so forth and so on.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow I know this is different than the way most people
p17
aVthink about science.
p18
aVScience, we generally are told,
p19
aVis a very well-ordered mechanism for
p20
aVunderstanding the world,
p21
aVfor gaining facts, for gaining data,
p22
aVthat it's rule-based,
p23
aVthat scientists use this thing called the scientific method
p24
aVand we've been doing this for 14 generations or so now,
p25
aVand the scientific method is a set of rules
p26
aVfor getting hard, cold facts out of the data.
p27
aa(lp28
VI'd like to tell you that's not the case.
p29
aVSo there's the scientific method,
p30
aVbut what's really going on is this. (Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
V[The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around]
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd it's going on kind of like that.
p35
aa(lp36
V[... in the dark] (Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo what is the difference, then,
p39
aVbetween the way I believe science is pursued
p40
aVand the way it seems to be perceived?
p41
aVSo this difference first came to me in some ways
p42
aVin my dual role at Columbia University,
p43
aVwhere I'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience
p44
aVwhere we try to figure out how the brain works.
p45
aVWe do this by studying the sense of smell,
p46
aVthe sense of olfaction, and in the laboratory,
p47
aVit's a great pleasure and fascinating work
p48
aVand exciting to work with graduate students and post-docs
p49
aVand think up cool experiments to understand how this
p50
aVsense of smell works and how the brain might be working,
p51
aVand, well, frankly, it's kind of exhilarating.
p52
aa(lp53
VBut at the same time, it's my responsibility
p54
aVto teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain,
p55
aVand that's a big subject,
p56
aVand it takes quite a while to organize that,
p57
aVand it's quite challenging and it's quite interesting,
p58
aVbut I have to say, it's not so exhilarating.
p59
aVSo what was the difference?
p60
aVWell, the course I was and am teaching
p61
aVis called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience - I. (Laughs)
p62
aVIt's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts,
p63
aVit uses this giant book called "Principles of Neural Science"
p64
aVby three famous neuroscientists.
p65
aVThis book comes in at 1,414 pages,
p66
aVit weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds.
p67
aVJust to put that in some perspective,
p68
aVthat's the weight of two normal human brains.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VSo I began to realize, by the end of this course,
p73
aVthat the students maybe were getting the idea
p74
aVthat we must know everything there is to know about the brain.
p75
aVThat's clearly not true.
p76
aVAnd they must also have this idea, I suppose,
p77
aVthat what scientists do is collect data and collect facts
p78
aVand stick them in these big books.
p79
aVAnd that's not really the case either.
p80
aVWhen I go to a meeting, after the meeting day is over
p81
aVand we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues,
p82
aVwe never talk about what we know.
p83
aVWe talk about what we don't know.
p84
aVWe talk about what still has to get done,
p85
aVwhat's so critical to get done in the lab.
p86
aVIndeed, this was, I think, best said by Marie Curie
p87
aVwho said that one never notices what has been done
p88
aVbut only what remains to be done.
p89
aVThis was in a letter to her brother after obtaining
p90
aVher second graduate degree, I should say.
p91
aa(lp92
VI have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie,
p93
aVbecause I am convinced that that glow behind her
p94
aVis not a photographic effect. (Laughter)
p95
aVThat's the real thing.
p96
aVIt is true that her papers are, to this day,
p97
aVstored in a basement room in the Bibliothèque Française
p98
aVin a concrete room that's lead-lined,
p99
aVand if you're a scholar and you want access to these notebooks,
p100
aVyou have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit,
p101
aVso it's pretty scary business.
p102
aa(lp103
VNonetheless, this is what I think we were leaving out
p104
aVof our courses
p105
aVand leaving out of the interaction that we have
p106
aVwith the public as scientists, the what-remains-to-be-done.
p107
aVThis is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting.
p108
aVIt is, if you will, the ignorance.
p109
aVThat's what was missing.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I thought, well, maybe I should teach a course
p112
aVon ignorance,
p113
aVsomething I can finally excel at, perhaps, for example.
p114
aVSo I did start teaching this course on ignorance,
p115
aVand it's been quite interesting
p116
aVand I'd like to tell you to go to the website.
p117
aVYou can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open.
p118
aVAnd it's been really quite an interesting time for me
p119
aVto meet up with other scientists who come in and talk
p120
aVabout what it is they don't know.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow I use this word "ignorance," of course,
p123
aVto be at least in part intentionally provocative,
p124
aVbecause ignorance has a lot of bad connotations
p125
aVand I clearly don't mean any of those.
p126
aVSo I don't mean stupidity, I don't mean a callow indifference
p127
aVto fact or reason or data.
p128
aVThe ignorant are clearly unenlightened, unaware,
p129
aVuninformed, and present company today excepted,
p130
aVoften occupy elected offices, it seems to me.
p131
aVThat's another story, perhaps.
p132
aa(lp133
VI mean a different kind of ignorance.
p134
aVI mean a kind of ignorance that's less pejorative,
p135
aVa kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge,
p136
aVsomething that's just not there to be known
p137
aVor isn't known well enough yet or we can't make predictions from,
p138
aVthe kind of ignorance that's maybe best summed up
p139
aVin a statement by James Clerk Maxwell,
p140
aVperhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein,
p141
aVwho said, "Thoroughly conscious ignorance
p142
aVis the prelude to every real advance in science."
p143
aVI think it's a wonderful idea:
p144
aVthoroughly conscious ignorance.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today,
p147
aVbut of course the first thing we have to clear up
p148
aVis what are we going to do with all those facts?
p149
aVSo it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate.
p150
aVWe all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts,
p151
aVthis accumulation model of science, as many have called it,
p152
aVand it seems impregnable, it seems impossible.
p153
aVHow can you ever know all of this?
p154
aVAnd indeed, the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate.
p155
aVIn 2006, there were 1.3 million papers published.
p156
aVThere's about a two-and-a-half-percent yearly growth rate,
p157
aVand so last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published.
p158
aVDivide that by the number of minutes in a year,
p159
aVand you wind up with three new papers per minute.
p160
aVSo I've been up here a little over 10 minutes,
p161
aVI've already lost three papers.
p162
aVI have to get out of here actually. I have to go read.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo what do we do about this? Well, the fact is
p165
aVthat what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect, if you will.
p166
aVWe just don't worry about it, in a way.
p167
aVThe facts are important. You have to know a lot of stuff
p168
aVto be a scientist. That's true.
p169
aVBut knowing a lot of stuff doesn't make you a scientist.
p170
aVYou need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer
p171
aVor an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter.
p172
aVBut in science, knowing a lot of stuff is not the point.
p173
aVKnowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get
p174
aVto more ignorance.
p175
aVSo knowledge is a big subject, but I would say
p176
aVignorance is a bigger one.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo this leads us to maybe think about, a little bit
p179
aVabout, some of the models of science that we tend to use,
p180
aVand I'd like to disabuse you of some of them.
p181
aVSo one of them, a popular one, is that scientists
p182
aVare patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together
p183
aVto reveal some grand scheme or another.
p184
aVThis is clearly not true. For one, with puzzles,
p185
aVthe manufacturer has guaranteed that there's a solution.
p186
aVWe don't have any such guarantee.
p187
aVIndeed, there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VSo I think the puzzle model doesn't work.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnother popular model is that science is busy unraveling things
p194
aVthe way you unravel the peels of an onion.
p195
aVSo peel by peel, you take away the layers of the onion
p196
aVto get at some fundamental kernel of truth.
p197
aVI don't think that's the way it works either.
p198
aVAnother one, a kind of popular one, is the iceberg idea,
p199
aVthat we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath
p200
aVis where most of the iceberg is hidden.
p201
aVBut all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts
p202
aVthat we can somehow or another get completed.
p203
aVWe can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is,
p204
aVor we could just wait for it to melt, I suppose, these days,
p205
aVbut one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg. Right?
p206
aVOr make it manageable. But I don't think that's the case.
p207
aVI think what really happens in science
p208
aVis a model more like the magic well,
p209
aVwhere no matter how many buckets you take out,
p210
aVthere's always another bucket of water to be had,
p211
aVor my particularly favorite one,
p212
aVwith the effect and everything, the ripples on a pond.
p213
aVSo if you think of knowledge being this ever-expanding ripple on a pond,
p214
aVthe important thing to realize is that our ignorance,
p215
aVthe circumference of this knowledge, also grows with knowledge.
p216
aVSo the knowledge generates ignorance.
p217
aVThis is really well said, I thought, by George Bernard Shaw.
p218
aVThis is actually part of a toast that he delivered
p219
aVto celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein's work,
p220
aVin which he claims that science
p221
aVjust creates more questions than it answers. ["Science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating 10 more."]
p222
aa(lp223
VI find that kind of glorious, and I think he's precisely right,
p224
aVplus it's a kind of job security.
p225
aVAs it turns out, he kind of cribbed that
p226
aVfrom the philosopher Immanuel Kant
p227
aVwho a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea
p228
aVof question propagation, that every answer begets more questions.
p229
aVI love that term, "question propagation,"
p230
aVthis idea of questions propagating out there.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo I'd say the model we want to take is not
p233
aVthat we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together
p234
aVand then we gain knowledge.
p235
aVIt's rather kind of the other way around, really.
p236
aVWhat do we use this knowledge for?
p237
aVWhat are we using this collection of facts for?
p238
aVWe're using it to make better ignorance,
p239
aVto come up with, if you will, higher-quality ignorance.
p240
aVBecause, you know, there's low-quality ignorance
p241
aVand there's high-quality ignorance. It's not all the same.
p242
aVScientists argue about this all the time.
p243
aVSometimes we call them bull sessions.
p244
aVSometimes we call them grant proposals.
p245
aVBut nonetheless, it's what the argument is about.
p246
aVIt's the ignorance. It's the what we don't know.
p247
aVIt's what makes a good question.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo how do we think about these questions?
p250
aVI'm going to show you a graph that shows up
p251
aVquite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments.
p252
aVThis graph asks the relationship between what you know
p253
aVand how much you know about it.
p254
aVSo what you know, you can know anywhere from nothing to everything, of course,
p255
aVand how much you know about it can be anywhere
p256
aVfrom a little to a lot.
p257
aVSo let's put a point on the graph. There's an undergraduate.
p258
aVDoesn't know much but they have a lot of interest.
p259
aVThey're interested in almost everything.
p260
aVNow you look at a master's student, a little further along in their education,
p261
aVand you see they know a bit more,
p262
aVbut it's been narrowed somewhat.
p263
aVAnd finally you get your Ph.D., where it turns out
p264
aVyou know a tremendous amount about almost nothing. (Laughter)
p265
aVWhat's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that
p266
aVbecause, of course, when it dips below the zero axis, there,
p267
aVit gets into a negative area.
p268
aVThat's where you find people like me, I'm afraid.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo the important thing here is that this can all be changed.
p271
aVThis whole view can be changed
p272
aVby just changing the label on the x-axis.
p273
aVSo instead of how much you know about it,
p274
aVwe could say, "What can you ask about it?"
p275
aVSo yes, you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist,
p276
aVbut the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff
p277
aVis not just to know a lot of stuff. That just makes you a geek, right?
p278
aVKnowing a lot of stuff, the purpose is
p279
aVto be able to ask lots of questions,
p280
aVto be able to frame thoughtful, interesting questions,
p281
aVbecause that's where the real work is.
p282
aa(lp283
VLet me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions.
p284
aVI'm a neuroscientist, so how would we come up
p285
aVwith a question in neuroscience?
p286
aVBecause it's not always quite so straightforward.
p287
aVSo, for example, we could say, well what is it that the brain does?
p288
aVWell, one thing the brain does, it moves us around.
p289
aVWe walk around on two legs.
p290
aVThat seems kind of simple, somehow or another.
p291
aVI mean, virtually everybody over 10 months of age
p292
aVwalks around on two legs, right?
p293
aVSo that maybe is not that interesting.
p294
aVSo instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at.
p295
aVHow about the visual system?
p296
aVThere it is, the visual system.
p297
aVI mean, we love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff.
p298
aVIndeed, there are over 12,000 neuroscientists
p299
aVwho work on the visual system,
p300
aVfrom the retina to the visual cortex,
p301
aVin an attempt to understand not just the visual system
p302
aVbut to also understand how general principles
p303
aVof how the brain might work.
p304
aVBut now here's the thing:
p305
aVOur technology has actually been pretty good
p306
aVat replicating what the visual system does.
p307
aVWe have TV, we have movies,
p308
aVwe have animation, we have photography,
p309
aVwe have pattern recognition, all of these sorts of things.
p310
aVThey work differently than our visual systems in some cases,
p311
aVbut nonetheless we've been pretty good at
p312
aVmaking a technology work like our visual system.
p313
aVSomehow or another, a hundred years of robotics,
p314
aVyou never saw a robot walk on two legs,
p315
aVbecause robots don't walk on two legs
p316
aVbecause it's not such an easy thing to do.
p317
aVA hundred years of robotics,
p318
aVand we can't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other.
p319
aVYou ask them to go up an inclined plane, and they fall over.
p320
aVTurn around, and they fall over. It's a serious problem.
p321
aVSo what is it that's the most difficult thing for a brain to do?
p322
aVWhat ought we to be studying?
p323
aVPerhaps it ought to be walking on two legs, or the motor system.
p324
aVI'll give you an example from my own lab,
p325
aVmy own particularly smelly question,
p326
aVsince we work on the sense of smell.
p327
aVBut here's a diagram of five molecules
p328
aVand sort of a chemical notation.
p329
aVThese are just plain old molecules, but if you sniff those molecules
p330
aVup these two little holes in the front of your face,
p331
aVyou will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose.
p332
aVIf there's a real rose there, those molecules will be the ones,
p333
aVbut even if there's no rose there,
p334
aVyou'll have the memory of a molecule.
p335
aVHow do we turn molecules into perceptions?
p336
aVWhat's the process by which that could happen?
p337
aVHere's another example: two very simple molecules, again in this kind of chemical notation.
p338
aVIt might be easier to visualize them this way,
p339
aVso the gray circles are carbon atoms, the white ones
p340
aVare hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms.
p341
aVNow these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom
p342
aVand two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it,
p343
aVand yet one of them, heptyl acetate,
p344
aVhas the distinct odor of a pear,
p345
aVand hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana.
p346
aVSo there are two really interesting questions here, it seems to me.
p347
aVOne is, how can a simple little molecule like that
p348
aVcreate a perception in your brain that's so clear
p349
aVas a pear or a banana?
p350
aVAnd secondly, how the hell can we tell the difference
p351
aVbetween two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom?
p352
aVI mean, that's remarkable to me,
p353
aVclearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet.
p354
aVAnd you don't even think about it, do you?
p355
aa(lp356
VSo this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us
p357
aVback to the ignorance and the idea of questions.
p358
aVI like to quote because I think dead people
p359
aVshouldn't be excluded from the conversation.
p360
aVAnd I also think it's important to realize that
p361
aVthe conversation's been going on for a while, by the way.
p362
aVSo Erwin Schrodinger, a great quantum physicist
p363
aVand, I think, philosopher, points out how you have to
p364
aV"abide by ignorance for an indefinite period" of time.
p365
aVAnd it's this abiding by ignorance
p366
aVthat I think we have to learn how to do.
p367
aVThis is a tricky thing. This is not such an easy business.
p368
aa(lp369
VI guess it comes down to our education system,
p370
aVso I'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education,
p371
aVbecause I think that's where it really has to play out.
p372
aVSo for one, let's face it,
p373
aVin the age of Google and Wikipedia,
p374
aVthe business model of the university
p375
aVand probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change.
p376
aVWe just can't sell facts for a living anymore.
p377
aVThey're available with a click of the mouse,
p378
aVor if you want to, you could probably just ask the wall
p379
aVone of these days, wherever they're going to hide the things
p380
aVthat tell us all this stuff.
p381
aa(lp382
VSo what do we have to do? We have to give our students
p383
aVa taste for the boundaries, for what's outside that circumference,
p384
aVfor what's outside the facts, what's just beyond the facts.
p385
aa(lp386
VHow do we do that?
p387
aVWell, one of the problems, of course,
p388
aVturns out to be testing.
p389
aVWe currently have an educational system
p390
aVwhich is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing.
p391
aVSo in second grade, all the kids are interested in science,
p392
aVthe girls and the boys.
p393
aVThey like to take stuff apart. They have great curiosity.
p394
aVThey like to investigate things. They go to science museums.
p395
aVThey like to play around. They're in second grade.
p396
aVThey're interested.
p397
aVBut by 11th or 12th grade, fewer than 10 percent
p398
aVof them have any interest in science whatsoever,
p399
aVlet alone a desire to go into science as a career.
p400
aVSo we have this remarkably efficient system
p401
aVfor beating any interest in science out of everybody's head.
p402
aa(lp403
VIs this what we want?
p404
aVI think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine
p405
aVcalls "the bulimic method of education."
p406
aVYou know. You can imagine what it is.
p407
aVWe just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here
p408
aVand then they puke it up on an exam over here
p409
aVand everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever.
p410
aa(lp411
VThis can't possibly continue to go on.
p412
aVSo what do we do? Well the geneticists, I have to say,
p413
aVhave an interesting maxim they live by.
p414
aVGeneticists always say, you always get what you screen for.
p415
aVAnd that's meant as a warning.
p416
aVSo we always will get what we screen for,
p417
aVand part of what we screen for is in our testing methods.
p418
aVWell, we hear a lot about testing and evaluation,
p419
aVand we have to think carefully when we're testing
p420
aVwhether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding,
p421
aVwhether we're weeding people out,
p422
aVwhether we're making some cut.
p423
aVEvaluation is one thing. You hear a lot about evaluation
p424
aVin the literature these days, in the educational literature,
p425
aVbut evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts
p426
aVto an opportunity for trial and error.
p427
aVIt amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time
p428
aVwith this kind of feedback.
p429
aVThat's different than weeding, and usually, I have to tell you,
p430
aVwhen people talk about evaluation, evaluating students,
p431
aVevaluating teachers, evaluating schools,
p432
aVevaluating programs, that they're really talking about weeding.
p433
aVAnd that's a bad thing, because then you will get what you select for,
p434
aVwhich is what we've gotten so far.
p435
aa(lp436
VSo I'd say what we need is a test that says, "What is x?"
p437
aVand the answers are "I don't know, because no one does,"
p438
aVor "What's the question?" Even better.
p439
aVOr, "You know what, I'll look it up, I'll ask someone,
p440
aVI'll phone someone. I'll find out."
p441
aVBecause that's what we want people to do,
p442
aVand that's how you evaluate them.
p443
aVAnd maybe for the advanced placement classes,
p444
aVit could be, "Here's the answer. What's the next question?"
p445
aVThat's the one I like in particular.
p446
aa(lp447
VSo let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats,
p448
aVwho said "Education is not about filling buckets;
p449
aVit is lighting fires."
p450
aa(lp451
VSo I'd say, let's get out the matches.
p452
aVThank you.
p453
aa(lp454
V(Applause)
p455
aa(lp456
VThank you. (Applause)

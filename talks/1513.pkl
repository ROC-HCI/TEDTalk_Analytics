VI'm gonna talk a little bit about open-source security,
p5
aVbecause we've got to get better at security
p6
aVin this 21st century.
p7
aa(lp8
VLet me start by saying, let's look back to the 20th century,
p9
aVand kind of get a sense of how that style of security
p10
aVworked for us.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is Verdun, a battlefield in France
p13
aVjust north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium.
p14
aVAt Verdun, in 1916, over a 300-day period,
p15
aV700,000 people were killed,
p16
aVso about 2,000 a day.
p17
aa(lp18
VIf you roll it forward \u2014 20th-century security \u2014
p19
aVinto the Second World War,
p20
aVyou see the Battle of Stalingrad,
p21
aV300 days, 2 million people killed.
p22
aa(lp23
VWe go into the Cold War, and we continue
p24
aVto try and build walls.
p25
aVWe go from the trench warfare of the First World War
p26
aVto the Maginot Line of the Second World War,
p27
aVand then we go into the Cold War,
p28
aVthe Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall.
p29
aVWalls don't work.
p30
aa(lp31
VMy thesis for us today is, instead of building walls
p32
aVto create security, we need to build bridges.
p33
aVThis is a famous bridge in Europe.
p34
aVIt's in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
p35
aVIt's the bridge over the Drina River,
p36
aVthe subject of a novel by Ivo Andri\u0107,
p37
aVand it talks about how,
p38
aVin that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans,
p39
aVover time there's been enormous building of walls.
p40
aVMore recently, in the last decade, we begin to see
p41
aVthese communities start, hesitatingly,
p42
aVto come together.
p43
aa(lp44
VI would argue, again, open-source security
p45
aVis about connecting the international,
p46
aVthe interagency, the private-public,
p47
aVand lashing it together with strategic communication,
p48
aVlargely in social networks.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that,
p51
aVbecause our global commons is under attack
p52
aVin a variety of ways,
p53
aVand none of the sources of threat to the global commons
p54
aVwill be solved by building walls.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, I'm a sailor, obviously.
p57
aVThis is a ship, a liner, clipping through the Indian Ocean.
p58
aVWhat's wrong with this picture?
p59
aVIt's got concertina wire along the sides of it.
p60
aVThat's to prevent pirates from attacking it.
p61
aVPiracy is a very active threat today
p62
aVaround the world. This is in the Indian Ocean.
p63
aVPiracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca.
p64
aVIt's active in the Gulf of Guinea.
p65
aVWe see it in the Caribbean.
p66
aVIt's a $10-billion-a-year discontinuity
p67
aVin the global transport system.
p68
aVLast year, at this time, there were 20 vessels,
p69
aV500 mariners held hostage.
p70
aVThis is an attack on the global commons.
p71
aVWe need to think about how to address it.
p72
aa(lp73
VLet's shift to a different kind of sea,
p74
aVthe cyber sea.
p75
aVHere are photographs of two young men.
p76
aVAt the moment, they're incarcerated.
p77
aVThey conducted a credit card fraud that netted them
p78
aVover 10 billion dollars.
p79
aVThis is part of cybercrime which is a $2-trillion-a-year
p80
aVdiscontinuity in the global economy.
p81
aVTwo trillion a year.
p82
aVThat's just under the GDP of Great Britain.
p83
aVSo this cyber sea, which we know endlessly
p84
aVis the fundamental piece of radical openness,
p85
aVis very much under threat as well.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnother thing I worry about in the global commons
p88
aVis the threat posed by trafficking,
p89
aVby the movement of narcotics, opium,
p90
aVhere coming out of Afghanistan through Europe
p91
aVover to the United States.
p92
aVWe worry about cocaine
p93
aVcoming from the Andean Ridge north.
p94
aVWe worry about the movement of illegal weapons
p95
aVand trafficking. Above all, perhaps,
p96
aVwe worry about human trafficking, and the awful cost of it.
p97
aVTrafficking moves largely at sea
p98
aVbut in other parts of the global commons.
p99
aa(lp100
VThis is a photograph, and I wish I could tell you
p101
aVthat this is a very high-tech piece of US Navy gear
p102
aVthat we're using to stop the trafficking.
p103
aVThe bad news is,
p104
aVthis is a semi-submersible run by drug cartels.
p105
aVIt was built in the jungles of South America.
p106
aVWe caught it with that low-tech raft \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p107
aVand it was carrying six tons of cocaine.
p108
aVCrew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep.
p109
aVThis kind of trafficking, in narcotics, in humans, in weapons,
p110
aVGod forbid, in weapons of mass destruction,
p111
aVis part of the threat to the global commons.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd let's pull it together in Afghanistan today.
p114
aVThis is a field of poppies in Afghanistan.
p115
aVEighty to 90 percent of the world's poppy,
p116
aVopium and heroin, comes out of Afghanistan.
p117
aVWe also see there, of course, terrorism.
p118
aVThis is where al Qaeda is staged from.
p119
aVWe also see a very strong insurgency embedded there.
p120
aVSo this terrorism concern is also part
p121
aVof the global commons, and what we must address.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo here we are, 21st century.
p124
aVWe know our 20th-century tools are not going to work.
p125
aVWhat should we do?
p126
aa(lp127
VI would argue that we will not deliver security
p128
aVsolely from the barrel of a gun.
p129
aVWe will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun.
p130
aVWe will need the application of military force.
p131
aVWhen we do it, we must do it well, and competently.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut my thesis is, open-source security is about international,
p134
aVinteragency, private-public connection pulled together
p135
aVby this idea of strategic communication on the Internet.
p136
aa(lp137
VLet me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way.
p138
aVThis is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers.
p139
aVThey are all holding books.
p140
aVYou should say, "That's odd. I thought I read that
p141
aVthis demographic, young men and women
p142
aVin their 20s and 30s, is largely illiterate in Afghanistan."
p143
aa(lp144
VYou would be correct.
p145
aa(lp146
VEighty-five percent cannot read
p147
aVwhen they enter the security forces of Afghanistan.
p148
aVWhy? Because the Taliban withheld education
p149
aVduring the period of time in which these men and women
p150
aVwould have learned to read.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo the question is, so,
p153
aVwhy are they all standing there holding books?
p154
aVThe answer is, we are teaching them to read
p155
aVin literacy courses by NATO
p156
aVin partnership with private sector entities,
p157
aVin partnership with development agencies.
p158
aVWe've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces
p159
aVto read and write at a basic level.
p160
aa(lp161
VWhen you can read and write in Afghanistan,
p162
aVyou will typically put a pen in your pocket.
p163
aVAt the ceremonies, when these young men and women
p164
aVgraduate, they take that pen with great pride,
p165
aVand put it in their pocket.
p166
aVThis is bringing together international
p167
aV\u2014 there are 50 nations involved in this mission \u2014
p168
aVinteragency \u2014 these development agencies \u2014
p169
aVand private-public, to take on this kind of security.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, we are also teaching them combat skills, of course,
p172
aVbut I would argue, open-source security
p173
aVmeans connecting in ways that create
p174
aVlonger lasting security effect.
p175
aa(lp176
VHere's another example.
p177
aVThis is a US Navy warship.
p178
aVIt's called the Comfort.
p179
aVThere's a sister ship called the Mercy.
p180
aVThey are hospital ships.
p181
aVThis one, the Comfort, operates throughout
p182
aVthe Caribbean and the coast of South America
p183
aVconducting patient treatments.
p184
aVOn a typical cruise, they'll do 400,000 patient treatments.
p185
aVIt is crewed not strictly by military
p186
aVbut by a combination of humanitarian organizations:
p187
aVOperation Hope, Project Smile.
p188
aVOther organizations send volunteers.
p189
aVInteragency physicians come out.
p190
aVThey're all part of this.
p191
aa(lp192
VTo give you one example of the impact this can have,
p193
aVthis little boy, eight years old,
p194
aVwalked with his mother two days
p195
aVto come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort.
p196
aVWhen he was fitted, over his extremely myopic eyes,
p197
aVhe suddenly looked up and said,
p198
aV"Mama, veo el mundo."
p199
aV"Mom, I see the world."
p200
aVMultiply this by 400,000 patient treatments,
p201
aVthis private-public collaboration with security forces,
p202
aVand you begin to see the power
p203
aVof creating security in a very different way.
p204
aa(lp205
VHere you see baseball players.
p206
aVCan you pick out the two US Army soldiers
p207
aVin this photograph?
p208
aVThey are the two young men on either side
p209
aVof these young boys. This is part of a series
p210
aVof baseball clinics, where we have explored collaboration
p211
aVbetween Major League Baseball,
p212
aVthe Department of State,
p213
aVwho sets up the diplomatic piece of this,
p214
aVmilitary baseball players, who are real soldiers
p215
aVwith real skills but participate in this mission,
p216
aVand they put on clinics
p217
aVthroughout Latin America and the Caribbean,
p218
aVin Honduras, in Nicaragua,
p219
aVin all of the Central American and Caribbean nations
p220
aVwhere baseball is so popular,
p221
aVand it creates security.
p222
aVIt shows role models to young men and women
p223
aVabout fitness and about life that I would argue
p224
aVhelp create security for us.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnother aspect of this partnership
p227
aVis in disaster relief.
p228
aVThis is a US Air Force helicopter participating
p229
aVafter the tsunami in 2004 which killed 250,000 people.
p230
aVIn each of these major disasters \u2014 the tsunami in 2004,
p231
aV250,000 dead, the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan, 2005,
p232
aV85,000 dead,
p233
aVthe Haitian earthquake, about 300,000 dead,
p234
aVmore recently the awful earthquake-tsunami combination
p235
aVwhich struck Japan and its nuclear industry \u2014
p236
aVin all of these instances, we see partnerships
p237
aVbetween international actors,
p238
aVinteragency, private-public working with security forces
p239
aVto respond to this kind of natural disaster.
p240
aVSo these are examples of this idea of open-source security.
p241
aa(lp242
VWe tie it together, increasingly, by doing things like this.
p243
aVNow, you're looking at this thinking, "Ah, Admiral,
p244
aVthese must be sea lanes of communication,
p245
aVor these might be fiber optic cables."
p246
aVNo. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter.
p247
aVPurple are tweets. Green are geolocation.
p248
aVWhite is the synthesis.
p249
aVIt's a perfect evocation of that great population survey,
p250
aVthe six largest nations in the world in descending order:
p251
aVChina, India, Facebook, the United States,
p252
aVTwitter and Indonesia. (Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VWhy do we want to get in these nets?
p255
aVWhy do we want to be involved?
p256
aVWe talked earlier about the Arab Spring,
p257
aVand the power of all this.
p258
aVI'll give you another example,
p259
aVand it's how you move this message.
p260
aa(lp261
VI gave a talk like this in London a while back
p262
aVabout this point. I said, as I say to all of you,
p263
aVI'm on Facebook. Friend me.
p264
aVGot a little laugh from the audience.
p265
aVThere was an article which was run by AP, on the wire.
p266
aVGot picked up in two places in the world:
p267
aVFinland and Indonesia.
p268
aVThe headline was: NATO Admiral Needs Friends.
p269
aV(Laughter)
p270
aVThank you. (Applause)
p271
aVWhich I do. (Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd the story was a catalyst,
p274
aVand the next morning I had hundreds
p275
aVof Facebook friend requests
p276
aVfrom Indonesians and Finns,
p277
aVmostly saying, "Admiral, we heard you need a friend,
p278
aVand oh, by the way, what is NATO?" (Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VSo ... (Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VYeah, we laugh, but this is how we move the message,
p283
aVand moving that message is how we connect
p284
aVinternational, interagency, private-public,
p285
aVand these social nets to help create security.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, let me hit a somber note.
p288
aVThis is a photograph of a brave British soldier.
p289
aVHe's in the Scots Guards.
p290
aVHe's standing the watch in Helmand,
p291
aVin southern Afghanistan.
p292
aVI put him here to remind us,
p293
aVI would not want anyone to leave the room thinking
p294
aVthat we do not need capable, competent militaries
p295
aVwho can create real military effect.
p296
aVThat is the core of who we are and what we do,
p297
aVand we do it to protect freedom, freedom of speech,
p298
aVall the things we treasure in our societies.
p299
aa(lp300
VBut, you know, life is not an on-and-off switch.
p301
aVYou don't have to have a military that is either
p302
aVin hard combat or is in the barracks.
p303
aa(lp304
VI would argue life is a rheostat.
p305
aVYou have to dial it in,
p306
aVand as I think about how we create security
p307
aVin this 21st century, there will be times
p308
aVwhen we will apply hard power in true war and crisis,
p309
aVbut there will be many instances,
p310
aVas we've talked about today,
p311
aVwhere our militaries can be part of creating
p312
aV21st-century security, international,
p313
aVinteragency, private-public,
p314
aVconnected with competent communication.
p315
aa(lp316
VI would close by saying that we heard earlier today
p317
aVabout Wikipedia. I use Wikipedia all the time
p318
aVto look up facts, and as all of you appreciate,
p319
aVWikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people
p320
aVlocked in a room writing articles.
p321
aVWikipedia, every day, is tens of thousands of people
p322
aVinputting information, and every day millions of people
p323
aVwithdrawing that information.
p324
aVIt's a perfect image for the fundamental point
p325
aVthat no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.
p326
aVNo one person, no one alliance, no one nation,
p327
aVno one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.
p328
aa(lp329
VThe vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple:
p330
aVa world in which every human being can freely share
p331
aVin the sum of all knowledge.
p332
aVMy thesis for you is that by combining international,
p333
aVinteragency, private-public, strategic communication,
p334
aVtogether, in this 21st century,
p335
aVwe can create the sum of all security.
p336
aa(lp337
VThank you. (Applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

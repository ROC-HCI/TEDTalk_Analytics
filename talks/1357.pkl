VEvery year in the United States alone,
p5
aV2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision
p6
aVto spend the rest of their lives together \u2014
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd not to have sex with anyone else.
p11
aVEver.
p12
aVHe buys a ring, she buys a dress.
p13
aVThey go shopping for all sorts of things.
p14
aVShe takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom-dancing lessons.
p15
aVAnd the big day comes.
p16
aVAnd they'll stand before God and family
p17
aVand some guy her dad once did business with,
p18
aVand they'll vow that nothing \u2014
p19
aVnot abject poverty,
p20
aVnot life-threatening illness,
p21
aVnot complete and utter misery \u2014
p22
aVwill ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VThese optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other
p27
aVthrough hot flashes and midlife crises
p28
aVand a cumulative 50-pound weight gain,
p29
aVuntil that far-off day, when one of them is finally able to rest in peace.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VYou know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore.
p34
aVAnd then they'll get stupid drunk
p35
aVand smash cake in each other's faces and do the Macarena.
p36
aVAnd we'll be there,
p37
aVshowering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze
p38
aVand throwing birdseed at them every single time ...
p39
aVeven though we know, statistically,
p40
aVhalf of them will be divorced within a decade.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VOf course, the other half won't, right?
p45
aVThey'll keep forgetting anniversaries
p46
aVand arguing about where to spend holidays
p47
aVand debating \u2014
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VWhich way the toilet paper should come off of the roll.
p52
aVAnd some of them will even still be enjoying each other's company
p53
aVwhen neither of them can chew solid food anymore.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd researchers want to know why.
p56
aVI mean, look \u2014 it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study
p57
aVto figure out what makes a marriage not work:
p58
aVdisrespect, boredom,
p59
aVtoo much time on Facebook,
p60
aVhaving sex with other people.
p61
aVBut you can have the exact opposite of all of those things \u2014
p62
aVrespect, excitement,
p63
aVa broken Internet connection,
p64
aVmind-numbing monogamy \u2014
p65
aVand the thing still can go to hell in a handbasket.
p66
aVSo, what's going on when it doesn't?
p67
aVWhat do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots
p68
aVhave in common?
p69
aVWhat are they doing right?
p70
aVWhat can we learn from them?
p71
aVAnd if you're still happily sleeping solo,
p72
aVwhy should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work
p73
aVto find that one special person
p74
aVthat you can annoy for the rest of your life?
p75
aa(lp76
VWell, researchers spend billions of your tax dollars
p77
aVtrying to figure that out.
p78
aVThey stalk blissful couples
p79
aVand study their every move and mannerism.
p80
aVAnd they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart
p81
aVfrom their miserable neighbors and friends.
p82
aVAnd it turns out, the success stories share a few similarities,
p83
aVbeyond that they don't have sex with other people.
p84
aa(lp85
VFor instance, in the happiest marriages,
p86
aVthe wife is thinner and better-looking
p87
aVthan the husband.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VObvious. Right?
p92
aVIt's obvious that this leads to marital bliss,
p93
aVbecause women \u2014 we care a great deal about being thin and good-looking,
p94
aVwhereas men mostly care about sex,
p95
aVideally, with women who are thinner and better looking than they are.
p96
aVThe beauty of this research, though,
p97
aVis that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy.
p98
aVWe just have to be thinner than our partners.
p99
aVSo instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising,
p100
aVwe just need to wait for them to get fat \u2014
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VMaybe bake a few pies.
p105
aVThis is good information to have, and it's not that complicated.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VResearch also suggests
p110
aVthat the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives.
p111
aVFor example: the happy wife.
p112
aVInstead of pointing out her husband's growing gut
p113
aVor suggesting he go for a run,
p114
aVshe might say,
p115
aV"Wow, honey, thank you for going out of your way
p116
aVto make me relatively thinner."
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VThese are couples who can find good in any situation.
p121
aV"Yeah, it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire.
p122
aVBut it's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars.
p123
aVAnd it's a good thing you've got all that body fat to keep us warm."
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VOne of my favorite studies found
p128
aVthat the more willing a husband is to do housework,
p129
aVthe more attractive his wife will find him.
p130
aVBecause we needed a study to tell us this.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VBut here's what's going on here.
p135
aVThe more attractive she finds him, the more sex they have;
p136
aVthe more sex they have, the nicer he is to her;
p137
aVthe nicer he is to her,
p138
aVthe less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed,
p139
aVand ultimately, they live happily ever after.
p140
aVIn other words, men, you might want to pick it up a notch
p141
aVin the domestic department.
p142
aa(lp143
VHere's an interesting one.
p144
aVOne study found that people who smile in childhood photographs
p145
aVare less likely to get a divorce.
p146
aVThis is an actual study, and let me clarify:
p147
aVthe researchers were not looking at documented self-reports
p148
aVof childhood happiness,
p149
aVor even studying old journals.
p150
aVThe data were based entirely on whether people looked happy
p151
aVin these early pictures.
p152
aVNow, I don't know how old all of you are, but when I was a kid,
p153
aVyour parents took pictures with a special kind of camera
p154
aVthat held something called "film."
p155
aVAnd, by God, film was expensive.
p156
aVThey didn't take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode
p157
aVand then pick out the nicest, smiliest one for the Christmas card.
p158
aVOh, no.
p159
aVThey dressed you up, they lined you up,
p160
aVand you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to
p161
aVor you could kiss your birthday party goodbye.
p162
aVBut still, I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures
p163
aVand I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo, what else can you do to safeguard your marriage?
p166
aVDo not win an Oscar for best actress.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VI'm serious.
p171
aVBettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Halle Berry, Hilary Swank,
p172
aVSandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon \u2014
p173
aVall of them single, soon after taking home that statue.
p174
aVThey actually call it the Oscar curse.
p175
aVIt is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous.
p178
aVIt turns out, merely watching a romantic comedy
p179
aVcauses relationship satisfaction to plummet.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VApparently, the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us,
p184
aVbut it obviously hasn't and it probably never will,
p185
aVmakes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison.
p186
aVAnd theoretically,
p187
aVI suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered
p188
aVor dies in a fiery car crash,
p189
aVwe are more likely to walk out of that theater
p190
aVfeeling like we've got it pretty good.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VDrinking alcohol, it seems, is bad for your marriage.
p195
aVYeah.
p196
aVI can't tell you anymore about that one
p197
aVbecause I stopped reading it at the headline.
p198
aVBut here's a scary one: divorce is contagious.
p199
aVThat's right, when you have a close couple friend split up,
p200
aVit increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent.
p201
aVNow, I have to say, I don't get this one at all.
p202
aVMy husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets
p203
aVand then struggle with being our age and single
p204
aVin an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony.
p205
aVAnd I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage
p206
aVthan a lifetime of therapy ever could.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo now you may be wondering: Why does anyone get married ever?
p209
aVWell, the US federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits
p210
aVto being someone's spouse.
p211
aVA list that includes visitation rights in jail,
p212
aVbut hopefully, you'll never need that one.
p213
aVBut beyond the profound federal perks,
p214
aVmarried people make more money.
p215
aVWe're healthier, physically and emotionally.
p216
aVWe produce happier, more stable and more successful kids.
p217
aVWe have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends,
p218
aVbelieve it or not.
p219
aVWe even live longer,
p220
aVwhich is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot
p221
aVin the first place.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VNow, if you're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return,
p226
aVI can't tell you how to find a chore-loving person
p227
aVof the approximately ideal size and attractiveness,
p228
aVwho prefers horror movies
p229
aVand doesn't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce,
p230
aVbut I can only encourage you to try,
p231
aVbecause the benefits, as I've pointed out,
p232
aVare significant.
p233
aVThe bottom line is: whether you're in it or you're searching for it,
p234
aVI believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting.
p235
aVSo I hope you'll use the information I've given you today
p236
aVto weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors.
p237
aa(lp238
VFor instance, in my marriage, I'd say I'm doing OK.
p239
aVOne the one hand,
p240
aVI have a husband who's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome.
p241
aVSo I'm obviously going to need fatten him up.
p242
aVAnd like I said, we have those divorced friends
p243
aVwho may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up.
p244
aVSo we have to keep an eye on that.
p245
aVAnd we do like a cocktail or two.
p246
aVOn the other hand,
p247
aVI have the fake happy picture thing.
p248
aVAnd also, my husband does a lot around the house,
p249
aVand would happily never see another romantic comedy
p250
aVas long as he lives.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo I've got all those things going for me.
p253
aVBut just in case,
p254
aVI plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon.
p255
aVAnd for the good of your relationships,
p256
aVI would encourage you to do the same.
p257
aVI'll see you at the bar.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
V(Applause)

VSixty-five million years ago, a very important
p5
aVand catastrophic event
p6
aVchanged the course of life on land.
p7
aVAnd although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about
p8
aVare just the scum of the Earth on the land \u2014
p9
aVthe little bits of land floating around \u2014 but they are important to us
p10
aVbecause they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters.
p11
aVAnd these animals disappeared,
p12
aVand a separate life, mammals,
p13
aVradiated out to take their place. And so, we know this
p14
aVin extraordinary detail. And so this is a core
p15
aVfrom near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis, the earthquakes,
p16
aVand the things that we've experienced
p17
aVin the entire record of humankind history
p18
aVcan't really quite get around the kind of disaster
p19
aVthat this represented for the Earth.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo even before that impact was known,
p22
aVeven before scientists in general came to an agreement
p23
aVover the theory of evolution,
p24
aVscientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes
p25
aVactually had divided Earth's life's history
p26
aVinto these two episodes:
p27
aVMesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life.
p28
aVAnd as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely
p29
aVwith geologic history.
p30
aVSo we have a Mesozoic period,
p31
aVan age of fragmentation,
p32
aVand a Cenozoic period, an age of reconnection \u2014
p33
aVSouth America to North America, India to Asia.
p34
aVAnd so my work, really, is trying to understand
p35
aVthe character of that Mesozoic radiation
p36
aVcompared to the Cenozoic radiation
p37
aVto see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals
p38
aVabout what life on drifting continents
p39
aVreally can tell us about evolution.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe work immediately begs the question,
p42
aV"Why didn't they go into the waters?"
p43
aVI mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example.
p44
aVYou can go outside \u2014 see many other examples.
p45
aVWithin five, 10 million years of the bolide impact
p46
aVwe had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that?
p47
aVWhy didn't they hang around in trees at good size,
p48
aVand why didn't they burrow?
p49
aVWhy didn't they do all these things, and if they didn't do all these things,
p50
aVwhat kinds of animals were in those spaces?
p51
aVAnd if there were no animals in those spaces, what does that tell us
p52
aVabout, you know, how evolution works on land?
p53
aVReally interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size.
p54
aVIn fact, I think that most of it has to do with body size \u2014
p55
aVthe size you are when you inherit
p56
aVa vacant ecospace
p57
aVfrom whatever natural disaster.
p58
aa(lp59
VLooking at dinosaur evolution
p60
aVand studying it, digging it up for many years,
p61
aVI end up looking at the mammal radiation,
p62
aVand it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology,
p63
aVadvancing by an order of magnitude.
p64
aVDinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace,
p65
aVan order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.
p66
aVYou want to measure it by diversity?
p67
aVYou want to measure it by
p68
aVthe time it took to reach maximum body size?
p69
aVYes, they do have larger body size,
p70
aVbut many of them are smaller,
p71
aVbut we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that.
p72
aVFifty million years to achieve this maximum body size.
p73
aVAnd that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals
p74
aVto achieve maximum body size
p75
aVand invade all those habitats.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo there's lessons to learn,
p78
aVand there's lessons to learn from the exception,
p79
aVthe exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made,
p80
aVand many other scholars have made around the world.
p81
aVThis slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx.
p82
aVWe now know this transition is the one time
p83
aVthat dinosaurs actually went below
p84
aVthat body size \u2014
p85
aVwe're going to see where they began in a minute \u2014
p86
aVand it is the one time that they rapidly
p87
aVinvaded all the habitats
p88
aVI just told you that dinosaurs weren't in.
p89
aVThey became marine. We now know them today
p90
aVfrom the ice caps.
p91
aVThere's burrowing birds.
p92
aVThey inhabit the trees at all body sizes,
p93
aVand, of course, they inhabit the land.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series
p96
aVthat later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature.
p97
aVWe called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx,
p98
aVand if you go to different layers, you find things
p99
aVthat are less advanced than Archaeopteryx, and every grade in between,
p100
aVso that if you find something today, we're usually splitting hairs \u2014
p101
aVor, more appropriately, feathers \u2014 as to decide whether it's actually
p102
aVa non-avian or an avian.
p103
aVIt is the greatest transition that we have, actually,
p104
aVon land from one habitat to another,
p105
aVbar none,
p106
aVto understand how a bony,
p107
aVfairly heavy, kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal
p108
aVcould make such a transition.
p109
aVIt is really our greatest \u2014 one of our greatest \u2014 evolutionary sequences.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, my work began at the beginning.
p112
aVI thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution,
p113
aVI'd have to go back to those beds
p114
aVwhere they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place
p115
aVwhere the earliest dinosaurs existed.
p116
aVI'd like to call for this little video clip
p117
aVto give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions:
p118
aV"Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?"
p119
aVIf we could roll that first video clip.
p120
aVThis is sort of a nice helicopter ride
p121
aVthrough those early beds,
p122
aVand they're located in Northeastern Argentina.
p123
aVAnd we're coming over a cliff, and at the top of that cliff,
p124
aVdinosaurs had basically taken over.
p125
aVAt the bottom of the cliff, we find that they're rare as hens' teeth.
p126
aVThat's where dinosaur origins is to be found: at the bottom of the cliff.
p127
aa(lp128
VYou go into an area like this, you get a geologic map,
p129
aVyou get a topographic map,
p130
aVand the best, most-inspired team you can bring to the area.
p131
aVAnd the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils.
p132
aVYou've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that
p133
aVto get it out; you've got to climb those cliffs
p134
aVand find, really, everything that existed \u2014
p135
aVnot just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you're lucky,
p136
aVand you dig a place like that,
p137
aVyou actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did.
p138
aV228 million years old, we found
p139
aVwhat really is the most primitive dinosaur:
p140
aVthat's the Ur-dinosaur.
p141
aVA three-and-a-half foot thing,
p142
aVbeautiful skull, predator,
p143
aVmeat-eater, a two-legged animal.
p144
aVSo, all the other dinosaurs that you know,
p145
aVor your kids know, at least, on four legs.
p146
aVThis is sort of a look at the skull,
p147
aVand it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.
p148
aVIt looks rather bird-like because it is.
p149
aVIt's bird-like and hollow.
p150
aVA predator. Maybe 25 pounds,
p151
aVor 10 kilograms.
p152
aVThat's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began.
p153
aVThat is 10 times larger
p154
aVthan the mammal radiation, which was a four-legged radiation.
p155
aVWe are extremely dinosaur-like,
p156
aVand unusual in our two-legged approach to life.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, if you want to understand what happened
p159
aVthen when the continents broke apart,
p160
aVand dinosaurs found \u2014 landlubbers, as they are \u2014
p161
aVfound themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces.
p162
aVMost of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents,
p163
aVbecause it was those continents that are least explored.
p164
aVIf you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally,
p165
aVyou really have to force yourself to go down
p166
aVto the four corners of the Earth \u2014
p167
aVAfrica, India, Antarctica, Australia \u2014
p168
aVand start putting together some of these pieces.
p169
aVI've been to some of those continents, but Africa was,
p170
aVin the words of Steven Pinker, was a blank slate, largely.
p171
aVBut one with an immense chalkboard in the middle,
p172
aVwith lots of little areas of dinosaur rock
p173
aVif you could survive an expedition.
p174
aa(lp175
VThere's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place.
p176
aVTo be able to excavate
p177
aVthe 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara
p178
aVand take them out, you really have to put together
p179
aVan expedition team that can handle the conditions.
p180
aVSome of them are political. Many of them are physical.
p181
aVSome of them \u2014 the most important \u2014 are mental.
p182
aVAnd you really have to be able to withstand conditions \u2014
p183
aVyou have to drive into the desert,
p184
aVyou will see landscapes in many cases \u2014
p185
aVyou can see from what we've discovered \u2014
p186
aVthat nobody else has ever seen.
p187
aVAnd the kinds of teams they bring in?
p188
aVWell, they're
p189
aVcomposed of
p190
aVpeople who understand science as adventure with a purpose.
p191
aVThey're usually students who've never seen a desert.
p192
aVSome of them are more experienced.
p193
aa(lp194
VYour job as a leader \u2014 this is definitely a team sport \u2014
p195
aVyour job as a leader is to try to inspire them
p196
aVto do more work than they've ever done in their life
p197
aVunder conditions that they can't imagine.
p198
aVSo, 125 degrees is normal.
p199
aVThe ground surface at 150 \u2014 typical.
p200
aVSo, you can't leave your normal metal tools out
p201
aVbecause you'll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes.
p202
aVSo, you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu.
p203
aVYou're really rubbing shoulders
p204
aVwith the world's last great nomadic people.
p205
aVThese are the Tuareg nomads, and they're living their lives
p206
aVmuch as they have for centuries.
p207
aVYour job is to excavate things like this in the foreground,
p208
aVand make them enter the pages of history.
p209
aVTo do that, you've got to actually transport them
p210
aVthousands of miles out of the desert.
p211
aa(lp212
VWe're talking about Ethiopia, but let's talk about Niger \u2014
p213
aVor Niger, in our English language \u2014 north of Nigeria \u2014
p214
aVthat's where this photograph was taken.
p215
aVBasically you're talking about a country that,
p216
aVwhen we started working there, did not have container traffic.
p217
aVYou transported the bones out yourself
p218
aVto the coast of Africa,
p219
aVonto a boat, if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara.
p220
aVThat's a 2,000 mile journey.
p221
aVSo enormous excavations and a lot of work,
p222
aVand out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs
p223
aVthat you saw buried there \u2014 20 tons of material \u2014
p224
aVwe erect Jobaria,
p225
aVa sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents.
p226
aVIt really is a little bit out of place temporally.
p227
aVIt looks nothing like what we would find
p228
aVif we dug in contemporary beds in North America.
p229
aVHere's the animal that was causing it trouble.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd, you know, on and on \u2014
p232
aVa whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this \u2014
p233
aVand some of you have had the chance to touch it \u2014
p234
aVthis is a piece of history. You're touching something that's 110 million years old.
p235
aVThis is a thumb claw. There it was, moments after it was discovered.
p236
aVIt is an incredible view of life,
p237
aVand it really began when we began to understand
p238
aVthe depth of time.
p239
aVIt's only been with us for less than a century,
p240
aVand in that time, that fourth dimension,
p241
aVwhen radioactive dating came about, less than a century ago,
p242
aVand we could actually tell how old some of these things were,
p243
aVis probably the most profound transformation,
p244
aVbecause it changes the way we look at ourselves
p245
aVand the world dramatically.
p246
aVWhen you pick up a piece of history like that,
p247
aVI think it can transform
p248
aVkids that are possibly interested in science.
p249
aa(lp250
VThat's the animal that thumb claw came from: Suchomimus.
p251
aVHere's some others.
p252
aVThis is something we found in Morocco, an immense animal.
p253
aVWe prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal.
p254
aVIt turns out to have a forebrain
p255
aVone-fifteenth the size of a human.
p256
aVThis was the cover of Science, because they thought
p257
aVthat humans were more intelligent than these animals,
p258
aVbut we can see by some in our administration
p259
aVthat despite
p260
aVthe enormous advantage in brain volume
p261
aVsome of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway,
p262
aVsmaller raptors.
p263
aVAll the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of \u2014
p264
aVall those small animals \u2014
p265
aVthey all come from northern continents.
p266
aVThis is the first skeleton from a southern continent,
p267
aVand guess what? You start preparing it.
p268
aVIt has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor.
p269
aVIt's really a wholly separate radiation.
p270
aVSo what we're trying to piece together here is a story.
p271
aVIt involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur
p272
aVthat we reconstructed from Africa.
p273
aa(lp274
VCrocodiles, of course,
p275
aVand that's a nasty one we haven't named yet.
p276
aVAnd huge things \u2014 I mean, this is a
p277
aVlower jaw just laying there in the desert
p278
aVof this enormous crocodile.
p279
aVThe crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus.
p280
aVThat's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws.
p281
aVWe had to try and reconstruct this.
p282
aVWe had to actually look at recent crocodiles
p283
aVto understand how crocodiles scale.
p284
aVCould I have the second little video clip?
p285
aVNow, this field is just \u2014 and, of course, science in general \u2014 is just \u2014 adventure.
p286
aVWe had to find and measure
p287
aVthe largest crocodiles living today.
p288
aa(lp289
VNarrator: ... as long as their boat.
p290
aa(lp291
VMan: Look at that set of choppers! Yeah, he's a big one.
p292
aa(lp293
VNarrator: If they can just land it,
p294
aVthis croc will provide useful data,
p295
aVhelping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus.
p296
aa(lp297
VMan: OK, hand me some more here. Man 2: OK.
p298
aa(lp299
VNarrator: It falls to Paul to cover its eyes.
p300
aa(lp301
VMan: Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs.
p302
aa(lp303
VMan: I got the back legs.
p304
aa(lp305
VMan 2: You have the back legs? No, you have the front legs, my friend.
p306
aVI've got it. I've got the back legs.
p307
aVSomebody get the front legs.
p308
aa(lp309
VPaul Sereno: Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there.
p310
aVWow.
p311
aVSixty-five. Wow.
p312
aVThat's a big skull.
p313
aa(lp314
VNarrator: Big, but less than half the size
p315
aVof supercroc's skull.
p316
aa(lp317
VMan: Enormous. PS: You've got a ... 14-foot croc.
p318
aa(lp319
VMan: I knew it was big.
p320
aa(lp321
VPS: Don't get off. You don't get off, but don't worry about me.
p322
aa(lp323
VNarrator: Paul has his data, so they decide
p324
aVto release the animal back into the river.
p325
aa(lp326
VPS: Don't get off! Don't get off! Don't get off!
p327
aa(lp328
VNarrator: Paul has never seen a fossil do that.
p329
aa(lp330
VPS: Okay, when I say three, we move.
p331
aVOne, two, three!
p332
aVWhoa!
p333
aa(lp334
VSo \u2014 there were \u2014
p335
aV(Applause)
p336
aVWell, you know, the \u2014 the fossil record is truly amazing
p337
aVbecause it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way.
p338
aVWe proved with those measurements
p339
aVthat crocodiles scaled isometrically.
p340
aVIt depended on the shape of their skull, though,
p341
aVso we had to actually get those measurements
p342
aVto be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world
p343
aVthat supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile, probably a male.
p344
aVAnyway, you find other things, too.
p345
aVI'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara
p346
aVto dig up Africa's largest neolithic site.
p347
aVWe found this last year.
p348
aVTwo hundred skeletons, tools, jewelry.
p349
aa(lp350
VThis is a ceremonial disk.
p351
aVAn amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara
p352
aV5,000 years ago is been sitting out there
p353
aVwaiting for us to go back. So, really exciting.
p354
aVAnd then work later is going to take us to Tibet.
p355
aVNow, we normally think of Tibet as a highland.
p356
aVIt's really an island continent.
p357
aVIt was a precursor to India,
p358
aVa messenger from Gondwana \u2014
p359
aVa lost paradise of dinosaurs
p360
aVisolated for millions of years.
p361
aVNo one's found them. We know where they are,
p362
aVand we're going to go and get them next year.
p363
aVThey're only between 13 and 14,000 feet,
p364
aVbut if you go in the warm part of the year, it's O.K.
p365
aVNow, I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history
p366
aVso that we can try to understand
p367
aVsome basic patterns of evolution.
p368
aVI've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further.
p369
aVWe need to delve into this mass of anatomy
p370
aVthat we've been compiling
p371
aVto understand where the changes are occurring and what this means.
p372
aVWe can't predict, necessarily, what will happen in evolution,
p373
aVbut we can learn some of the rules of the game,
p374
aVand that's really what we're trying to do.
p375
aa(lp376
VWith regard to the biogeographic question,
p377
aVthe Earth is dividing.
p378
aVThese are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices.
p379
aVYou get divided, and a continent's division
p380
aVcorresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree,
p381
aVor you're crafty, and you manage to escape
p382
aVfrom one to the other and erase that division,
p383
aVor you're living peacefully on each side,
p384
aVand on one side you just go extinct,
p385
aVand you survive on the other side and create a difference.
p386
aVAnd the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other
p387
aVof those three things, but the paleontologist never found you.
p388
aVAnd you take those four instances
p389
aVand you realize you have a complex problem.
p390
aVAnd so, in addition to digging, I think we have some answers
p391
aVfrom the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated \u2014
p392
aVwe call it dispersal \u2014 around the globe, with the slightest land bridge.
p393
aVThey did it within two or three degrees of the pole,
p394
aVto maintain similarity between continents.
p395
aVBut when they were divided, indeed they were divided,
p396
aVand we do see the continents
p397
aVcarving differences among dinosaurs.
p398
aa(lp399
VBut there's one thing that's even more important, and I think that's extinction.
p400
aVWe have downgraded this factor.
p401
aVIt carves up the history of life,
p402
aVand gives us the differences that we see
p403
aVin the dinosaur world towards the end,
p404
aVright before the bolide impact.
p405
aVThe best way to test this is to actually create a model.
p406
aVSo if we move back, this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life.
p407
aVI want to give you three dimensions.
p408
aVSo you see the tree of life,
p409
aVbut now I've added the dimension of area.
p410
aVSo the tree of life is normally divergence over time.
p411
aVNow we have divergence over time, but we've created the third dimension of area.
p412
aa(lp413
VThis is a computer program
p414
aVwhich has three knobs.
p415
aVWe can control those things that we're worried about:
p416
aVextinction, sampling, dispersal \u2014
p417
aVgoing from one area to another.
p418
aVAnd ultimately we can control the branching
p419
aVto mimic what we think the continents were like,
p420
aVand run it a thousand times, so we can estimate the parameters,
p421
aVto answer the question whether we are on the mark or not,
p422
aVat least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science.
p423
aa(lp424
VToday I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here
p425
aVtalking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago,
p426
aVwhich is related to the fact that I never \u2014
p427
aVand actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters,
p428
aVthere's a number of you out there \u2014 I don't know that I'd get an answer
p429
aVhonestly, if I asked you to raise your hand,
p430
aVbut there are a number of you out there that started your
p431
aVscientific, technical, entertainment career
p432
aVas failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools.
p433
aVI was one of those. I was failed by my school \u2014 my school failed me.
p434
aVWho's pointing fingers?
p435
aVSeveral teachers nearly killed me.
p436
aVI found myself in art.
p437
aVI was a total failure in school, not really headed to graduate high school.
p438
aVAnd I went on \u2014 that's my first painting on canvas.
p439
aVI read a dictionary. I got into college.
p440
aVI became an artist. O.K., and started drawing.
p441
aVIt became abstract.
p442
aVI worked up a portfolio, and I was headed to New York.
p443
aVSometimes I would see bones when there was a body there.
p444
aVSomething was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio.
p445
aVI took a side trip to the American Museum, and I never recovered.
p446
aa(lp447
VBut really it's the same discipline \u2014 they're kindred disciplines.
p448
aVI mean, is there anything
p449
aVthat is not visualizing what can't be seen,
p450
aVin terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it
p451
aVthat's out there, or seeing the distortion
p452
aVthat we try to see
p453
aVas evolutionary distortion in one animal to another?
p454
aVThis is a very extraordinarily visual.
p455
aVI give you a human face because you're experts at that.
p456
aVIt takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs.
p457
aVThey're really kindred disciplines.
p458
aVBut what we're trying to create in Chicago
p459
aVis a way to get,
p460
aVcollect together, those students
p461
aVwho are least represented in our science and technology spheres.
p462
aVWe all know, and there's been several allusions to it,
p463
aVthat we are failing in our ability to produce
p464
aVenough scientists, engineers and technicians.
p465
aa(lp466
VWe've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase,
p467
aVand now, as you see the increase
p468
aVin the pace of what we're doing,
p469
aVit becomes even more prominent.  Where are all these people going to come from?
p470
aVAnd a more general question for our society is,
p471
aVwhat's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind?
p472
aVWhat about all the kids like me that were in school \u2014
p473
aVkids like some of you out there \u2014
p474
aVthat were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance
p475
aVto participate in science and technology?
p476
aa(lp477
VThose are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia, and it's very important.
p478
aVNiger is equally important, and I'm trying desperately
p479
aVto do something in Niger.
p480
aVThey have an AIDS problem. I asked \u2014
p481
aVthe U.S. State Department asked the government recently,
p482
aVWhat do you want to do? And they gave them two problems.
p483
aVDinosaurs was one of them.
p484
aVGive us a museum of dinosaurs,
p485
aVand we will attract tourists, which is our number two industry.
p486
aVAnd I hope to God the United States government, me, or TED,
p487
aVor somebody helps us do that, because that would be an incredible thing for their country.
p488
aVBut when we look back at our own country, we're looking back at our cities,
p489
aVthe cities where most of you come from \u2014 certainly the city I come from \u2014
p490
aVthere's legions of kids out there
p491
aVlike these.
p492
aVAnd the question is \u2014 and we started to address this question for centuries \u2014
p493
aVas to how we get these kids involved in science.
p494
aa(lp495
VWe've started in Chicago
p496
aVan organization \u2014 a non-profit organization \u2014
p497
aVcalled Project Exploration.
p498
aVThese are two kids from Project Exploration.
p499
aVWe met them in their early stages in high school. They were \u2014
p500
aVfailing to poor students,
p501
aVand they are now \u2014 one at the University of Chicago, another in Illinois.
p502
aVWe've got students at Harvard. We're six years old.
p503
aVAnd we created a track record.
p504
aVBecause when you go out there as a scholar, and you try to find out longitudinal studies,
p505
aVtrack records like that, there essentially are very few, if none.
p506
aVSo, we've created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation,
p507
aV90 percent going to college, many first-generation,
p508
aV90 percent of those choosing science as a career.
p509
aVIt's an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say,
p510
aVwell, we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start,
p511
aVbut when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education.
p512
aa(lp513
VIt's gone through science as an inquiry,
p514
aVwhich was a big advance,
p515
aVand Dewey back at Chicago \u2014
p516
aVyou learn by doing.
p517
aVTo \u2014 you learn by envisioning yourself
p518
aVas a scientist,
p519
aVand then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist.
p520
aVThe next step is to learn the capability
p521
aVto make yourself a scientist.
p522
aVYou have to have those steps. If you have \u2014
p523
aVIt's easy to get kids interested in science.
p524
aVIt's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist,
p525
aVwhich involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium
p526
aVand presenting something as a knowledgeable person,
p527
aVand then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist
p528
aVand giving yourself the tools to pursue that.
p529
aa(lp530
VAnd so, that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago.
p531
aVWe have lots of ideas, but I guarantee you this one thing \u2014
p532
aVand I've talked to some people here at TED \u2014
p533
aVit's not going to look like anything you've seen before.
p534
aVIt's going to be part-school, part-museum hall,
p535
aVpart-conservatory, part-zoo,
p536
aVand part of an answer to the problem
p537
aVof how you interest kids in science.
p538
aVThank you very much.

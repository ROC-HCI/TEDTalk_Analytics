VOne thing I wanted to say about film making is \u2014 about this film \u2014
p5
aVin thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here,
p6
aVMichael Moschen, and some of the talks about music,
p7
aVthis idea that there is a narrative line,
p8
aVand that music exists in time.
p9
aVA film also exists in time; it's an experience
p10
aVthat you should go through emotionally.
p11
aVAnd in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen
p12
aVwere all about learning something,
p13
aVor knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.
p14
aVAnd I wanted this film to be driven by emotions,
p15
aVand really to follow my journey.
p16
aVSo instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes,
p17
aVand we meet people along the way.
p18
aVWe only meet them once.
p19
aVThey don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey.
p20
aVIt's something like life, that once you get in it
p21
aVyou can't get out.
p22
aa(lp23
VThere are two clips I want to show you,
p24
aVthe first one is a kind of hodgepodge,
p25
aVits just three little moments, four little moments
p26
aVwith three of the people who are here tonight.
p27
aVIt's not the way they occur in the film,
p28
aVbecause they are part of much larger scenes.
p29
aVThey play off each other in a wonderful way.
p30
aVAnd that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou,
p31
aVtalking about something that is very dear to him,
p32
aVwhich is the accidents of life.
p33
aVI think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental,
p34
aVand perhaps not planned at all.
p35
aVAnd those three clips will be followed by a scene of
p36
aVperhaps what, to me, is really his greatest building
p37
aVwhich is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
p38
aVHe built the capital over there.
p39
aVAnd I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen \u2014
p40
aVit's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew.
p41
aVWe were the first film crew in there.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo you'll see images of this remarkable building.
p44
aVA couple of things to keep in mind when you see it,
p45
aVit was built entirely by hand,
p46
aVI think they got a crane the last year.
p47
aVIt was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding,
p48
aVpeople carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads,
p49
aVdumping them in the forms.
p50
aVIt is the capital of the country,
p51
aVand it took 23 years to build,
p52
aVwhich is something they seem to be very proud of over there.
p53
aVIt took as long as the Taj Mahal.
p54
aVUnfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished.
p55
aVHe died in 1974.
p56
aVThe building was finished in 1983.
p57
aVSo it continued on for many years
p58
aVafter he died.
p59
aVThink about that when you see that building,
p60
aVthat sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd that really struck me about my father,
p63
aVin the sense that he had such belief
p64
aVthat somehow, doing these things
p65
aVgiving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it,
p66
aVeven in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point,
p67
aVand the construction stopped totally and he kept working,
p68
aVbecause he felt, "Well when the war is done
p69
aVthey'll need this building."
p70
aVSo, those are the two clips I'm going to show.
p71
aVRoll that tape.
p72
aV(Applause)
p73
aa(lp74
VRichard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn.
p75
aVAnd I came home and I said to my father and mother,
p76
aV"I just met this man: doesn't have much work,
p77
aVand he's sort of ugly, funny voice,
p78
aVand he's a teacher at school.
p79
aVI know you've never heard of him, but just mark this day
p80
aVthat someday you will hear of him,
p81
aVbecause he's really an amazing man."
p82
aa(lp83
VFrank Gehry: I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true?
p84
aa(lp85
VNathaniel Kahn: If he did he was a very lucky man.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VNK: Did you hear that, really?
p90
aa(lp91
VFG: Yeah, when he was in Rome.
p92
aa(lp93
VMoshe Safdie: He was a real nomad.
p94
aVAnd you know, when I knew him when I was in the office,
p95
aVhe would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office
p96
aVfor two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go.
p97
aVYou know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us
p98
aVand there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.
p99
aVI mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station,
p100
aVit was so consistent with his life, you know?
p101
aVI mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane,
p102
aVor I'm going to die in an airport,
p103
aVor die jogging without an identification on me.
p104
aVI don't know why I sort of carry that
p105
aVfrom that memory of the way he died.
p106
aVBut he was a sort of a nomad at heart.
p107
aa(lp108
VLouis Kahn: How accidental our existences are really
p109
aVand how full of influence by circumstance.
p110
aa(lp111
VMan: We are the morning workers who come, all the time, here
p112
aVand enjoy the walking, city's beauty and the atmosphere
p113
aVand this is the nicest place of Bangladesh.
p114
aVWe are proud of it.
p115
aa(lp116
VNK: You're proud of it?
p117
aa(lp118
VMan: Yes, it is the national image of Bangladesh.
p119
aa(lp120
VNK: Do you know anything about the architect?
p121
aa(lp122
VMan: Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect.
p123
aa(lp124
VNK: Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son,
p125
aVhe was my father.
p126
aa(lp127
VMan: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan?
p128
aa(lp129
VNK: Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan, Louis Kahn.
p130
aa(lp131
VMan: Louis Kahn, yes!
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VMan: Your father, is he alive?
p136
aa(lp137
VNK: No, he's been dead for 25 years.
p138
aa(lp139
VMan: Very pleased to welcome you back.
p140
aa(lp141
VNK: Thank you.
p142
aa(lp143
VNK: He never saw it finished, Pop.
p144
aVNo, he never saw this.
p145
aa(lp146
VShamsul Wares: It was almost impossible, building for a country like ours.
p147
aVIn 30, 50 years back, it was nothing, only paddy fields,
p148
aVand since we invited him here,
p149
aVhe felt that he has got a responsibility.
p150
aVHe wanted to be a Moses here, he gave us democracy.
p151
aVHe is not a political man,
p152
aVbut in this guise he has given us
p153
aVthe institution for democracy, from where we can rise.
p154
aVIn that way it is so relevant.
p155
aVHe didn't care for how much money this country has,
p156
aVor whether he would be able to ever finish this building,
p157
aVbut somehow he has been able to do it, build it, here.
p158
aVAnd this is the largest project he has got in here, the poorest country in the world.
p159
aa(lp160
VNK: It cost him his life.
p161
aa(lp162
VSW: Yeah, he paid. He paid his life for this,
p163
aVand that is why he is great and we'll remember him.
p164
aVBut he was also human.
p165
aVNow his failure to satisfy the family life,
p166
aVis an inevitable association of great people.
p167
aVBut I think his son will understand this,
p168
aVand will have no sense of grudge,
p169
aVor sense of being neglected, I think.
p170
aVHe cared in a very different manner,
p171
aVbut it takes a lot of time to understand that.
p172
aVIn social aspect of his life
p173
aVhe was just like a child, he was not at all matured.
p174
aVHe could not say no to anything,
p175
aVand that is why, that he cannot say no to things,
p176
aVwe got this building today.
p177
aVYou see, only that way you can be able to understand him.
p178
aVThere is no other shortcut,
p179
aVno other way to really understand him.
p180
aVBut I think he has given us this building
p181
aVand we feel all the time for him,
p182
aVthat's why, he has given love for us.
p183
aVHe could not probably give the right kind of love for you,
p184
aVbut for us, he has given the people the right kind of love,
p185
aVthat is important.
p186
aVYou have to understand that.
p187
aVHe had an enormous amount of love,
p188
aVhe loved everybody.
p189
aVTo love everybody, he sometimes did not see
p190
aVthe very closest ones,
p191
aVand that is inevitable for men of his stature.

architect Louis Kahn was known for formally brilliant modern buildings, but<strong> his personal life was utterly baroque</strong>: married with one child, he had two other children by two other women. His only son, Nathaniel, met him rarely; Louis died when Nathaniel was only 11. Nathaniel grew up to become a playwright and documentary filmmaker -- he worked on such award-winning films as 1996&#39;s <a href=\\"http://geni.us/scs\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>My Father&#39;s Garden</em></a> and <em><a href=\\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245032/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Canary of the Ocean</a></em>.&nbsp;</p><p>His 2002 film <a href=\\"http://www.myarchitectfilm.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>My Architect</em></a>  traveled the world to uncover the mysteries of his father, looking for clues in Louis Kahn&#39;s body of work, in his work relationships and his personal ones. It&#39;s a film with meaning to anyone who seeks to understand <strong>the relationship between art and love</strong>. After <em>My Architect</em>, Kahn directed the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated 2004 documentary <a href=\\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0951151/\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Two Hands</em></a>, about the pianist Leon Fleischer, and produced a mockumental look at the director <a href=\\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391311/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">M.

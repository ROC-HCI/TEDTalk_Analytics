VAt 7:45 a.m., I open the doors to a building
p5
aVdedicated to building, yet only breaks me down.
p6
aVI march down hallways cleaned up after me every day
p7
aVby regular janitors,
p8
aVbut I never have the decency to honor their names.
p9
aVLockers left open like teenage boys' mouths
p10
aVwhen teenage girls wear clothes that covers
p11
aVtheir insecurities but exposes everything else.
p12
aVMasculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers,
p13
aVcamouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed
p14
aVbut need hugs.
p15
aVTeachers paid less than what it costs them to be here.
p16
aVOceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons
p17
aVbut never learn to swim,
p18
aVpart like the Red Sea when the bell rings.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis is a training ground.
p21
aVMy high school is Chicago,
p22
aVdiverse and segregated on purpose.
p23
aVSocial lines are barbed wire.
p24
aVLabels like "Regulars" and "Honors" resonate.
p25
aVI am an Honors but go home with Regular students
p26
aVwho are soldiers in territory that owns them.
p27
aVThis is a training ground to sort out the Regulars
p28
aVfrom the Honors, a reoccurring cycle
p29
aVbuilt to recycle the trash of this system.
p30
aa(lp31
VTrained at a young age to capitalize,
p32
aVletters taught now that capitalism raises you
p33
aVbut you have to step on someone else to get there.
p34
aVThis is a training ground where one group
p35
aVis taught to lead and the other is made to follow.
p36
aVNo wonder so many of my people spit bars,
p37
aVbecause the truth is hard to swallow.
p38
aVThe need for degrees has left so many people frozen.
p39
aa(lp40
VHomework is stressful,
p41
aVbut when you go home every day and your home is work,
p42
aVyou don't want to pick up any assignments.
p43
aVReading textbooks is stressful,
p44
aVbut reading does not matter when you feel
p45
aVyour story is already written,
p46
aVeither dead or getting booked.
p47
aVTaking tests is stressful,
p48
aVbut bubbling in a Scantron does not stop
p49
aVbullets from bursting.
p50
aa(lp51
VI hear education systems are failing,
p52
aVbut I believe they're succeeding at what they're built to do \u2014
p53
aVto train you, to keep you on track,
p54
aVto track down an American dream that has failed
p55
aVso many of us all.

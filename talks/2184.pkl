VWhat's the fastest growing threat to Americans' health?
p5
aVCancer? Heart attacks? Diabetes?
p6
aVThe answer is actually none of these;
p7
aVit's Alzheimer's disease.
p8
aVEvery 67 seconds,
p9
aVsomeone in the United States is diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
p10
aVAs the number of Alzheimer's patients triples by the year 2050,
p11
aVcaring for them, as well as the rest of the aging population,
p12
aVwill become an overwhelming societal challenge.
p13
aa(lp14
VMy family has experienced firsthand
p15
aVthe struggles of caring for an Alzheimer's patient.
p16
aVGrowing up in a family with three generations,
p17
aVI've always been very close to my grandfather.
p18
aVWhen I was four years old,
p19
aVmy grandfather and I  were walking in a park in Japan
p20
aVwhen he suddenly got lost.
p21
aVIt was one of the scariest moments I've ever experienced in my life,
p22
aVand it was also the first instance that informed us
p23
aVthat my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease.
p24
aVOver the past 12 years, his condition got worse and worse,
p25
aVand his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress.
p26
aVMy aunt, his primary caregiver,
p27
aVreally struggled to stay awake at night to keep an eye on him,
p28
aVand even then often failed to catch him leaving the bed.
p29
aVI became really concerned about my aunt's well-being
p30
aVas well as my grandfather's safety.
p31
aVI searched extensively for a solution that could help my family's problems,
p32
aVbut couldn't find one.
p33
aa(lp34
VThen, one night about two years ago,
p35
aVI was looking after my grandfather and I saw him stepping out of the bed.
p36
aVThe moment his foot landed on the floor,
p37
aVI thought, why don't I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot?
p38
aVOnce he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed,
p39
aVthe pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight
p40
aVand then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver's smartphone.
p41
aVThat way, my aunt could sleep much better at night
p42
aVwithout having to worry about my grandfather's wandering.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo now I'd like to perform a demonstration of this sock.
p45
aVCould I please have my sock model on the stage?
p46
aVGreat.
p47
aVSo once the patient steps onto the floor \u2014
p48
aV(Ringing) \u2014
p49
aVan alert is sent to the caregiver's smartphone.
p50
aa(lp51
VThank you. (Applause)
p52
aa(lp53
VThank you, sock model.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo this is a drawing of my preliminary design.
p56
aa(lp57
VMy desire to create a sensor-based technology
p58
aVperhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology.
p59
aVWhen I was six years old,
p60
aVan elderly family friend fell down in the bathroom
p61
aVand suffered severe injuries.
p62
aVI became concerned about my own grandparents
p63
aVand decided to invent a smart bathroom system.
p64
aVMotion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors
p65
aVto detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom.
p66
aVSince I was only six years old at the time
p67
aVand I hadn't graduated from kindergarten yet,
p68
aVI didn't have the necessary resources and  tools to translate my idea into reality,
p69
aVbut nonetheless, my research experience
p70
aVreally implanted in me a firm desire to use sensors to help the elderly people.
p71
aVI really believe that sensors can improve the quality of life of the elderly.
p72
aa(lp73
VWhen I laid out my plan, I realized that I faced three main challenges:
p74
aVfirst, creating a sensor;
p75
aVsecond, designing a circuit;
p76
aVand third, coding a smartphone app.
p77
aVThis made me realize that my project was actually much harder to realize
p78
aVthan I initially had thought it to be.
p79
aa(lp80
VFirst, I had to create a wearable sensor that was thin and flexible enough
p81
aVto be worn comfortably on the bottom of the patient's foot.
p82
aVAfter extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber,
p83
aVwhich I realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot,
p84
aVI decided to print a film sensor
p85
aVwith electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles.
p86
aVOnce pressure is applied, the connectivity between the particles increases.
p87
aVTherefore, I could design a circuit that would measure pressure
p88
aVby measuring electrical resistance.
p89
aa(lp90
VNext, I had to design a wearable wireless circuit,
p91
aVbut wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power
p92
aVand requires heavy, bulky batteries.
p93
aVThankfully, I was able to find out about the Bluetooth low energy technology,
p94
aVwhich consumes very little power and can be driven by a coin-sized battery.
p95
aVThis prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night.
p96
aa(lp97
VLastly, I had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform
p98
aVthe care-giver's smartphone into a remote monitor.
p99
aVFor this, I had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode
p100
aVand I also had to learn about how to code for Bluetooth low energy devices
p101
aVby watching YouTube tutorials and reading various textbooks.
p102
aa(lp103
VIntegrating these components, I was able to successfully create two prototypes,
p104
aVone in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock,
p105
aVand another that's a re-attachable sensor assembly
p106
aVthat can be adhered anywhere that makes contact
p107
aVwith the bottom of the patient's foot.
p108
aVI've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now,
p109
aVand it's had a 100 percent success rate
p110
aVin detecting the over 900  known cases of his wandering.
p111
aVLast summer, I was able to beta test my device
p112
aVat several residential care facilities in California,
p113
aVand I'm currently incorporating the feedback
p114
aVto further improve the device  into a marketable product.
p115
aVTesting the device on a number of patients
p116
aVmade me realize that I needed to invent solutions
p117
aVfor people who didn't want to wear socks to sleep at night.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo sensor data, collected on a vast number of patients,
p120
aVcan be useful for improving patient care
p121
aVand also leading to a cure for the disease, possibly.
p122
aVFor example, I'm currently examining
p123
aVcorrelations between the frequency of a patient's nightly wandering
p124
aVand his or her daily activities and diet.
p125
aa(lp126
VOne thing I'll never forget is when my device first caught
p127
aVmy grandfather's wandering out of bed at night.
p128
aVAt that moment, I was really struck by the power of technology
p129
aVto change lives for the better.
p130
aVPeople living happily and healthfully \u2014
p131
aVthat's the world that I imagine.
p132
aa(lp133
VThank you very much.

VI'm going to talk about hackers.
p5
aVAnd the image that comes to your mind
p6
aVwhen I say that word is probably not
p7
aVof Benjamin Franklin,
p8
aVbut I'm going to explain to you why it should be.
p9
aa(lp10
VThe image that comes to your mind
p11
aVis probably more likely of a pasty kid
p12
aVsitting in a basement doing something mischievous,
p13
aVor of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity,
p14
aVor of an international rogue
p15
aVwith a political agenda.
p16
aVAnd mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea
p17
aVthat hackers are people that we should be afraid of.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut like most things in technology
p20
aVand the technology world,
p21
aVhacking has equal power for good as it has for evil.
p22
aVFor every hacker that's trying to steal your identity
p23
aVthere's one that's building a tool
p24
aVthat will help you find your loved ones after a disaster
p25
aVor to monitor environmental quality
p26
aVafter an oil spill.
p27
aVHacking is really just any amateur innovation
p28
aVon an existing system,
p29
aVand it is a deeply democratic activity.
p30
aVIt's about critical thinking.
p31
aVIt's about questioning existing ways of doing things.
p32
aVIt's the idea that if you see a  problem, you work to fix it,
p33
aVand not just complain about it.
p34
aVAnd in many ways, hacking is what built America.
p35
aVBetsy Ross was a hacker.
p36
aVThe Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack.
p37
aVAnd from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs,
p38
aVhacking has always been at the foundation
p39
aVof American democracy.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today,
p42
aVit's that the next time you think about who a hacker is,
p43
aVyou think not of this guy
p44
aVbut of this guy, Benjamin Franklin,
p45
aVwho was one of the greatest hackers of all time.
p46
aVHe was one of America's most prolific inventors,
p47
aVthough he famously never filed a patent,
p48
aVbecause he thought that all human knowledge
p49
aVshould be freely available.
p50
aVHe brought us bifocals and the lightning rod,
p51
aVand of course there was his collaboration
p52
aVon the invention of American democracy.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd in Code For America, we really try to embody
p55
aVthe spirit of Ben Franklin.
p56
aVHe was a tinkerer and a statesman
p57
aVwhose conception of citizenship
p58
aVwas always predicated on action.
p59
aVHe believed that government could be built
p60
aVby the people,
p61
aVand we call those people civic hackers.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo it's no wonder that the values
p64
aVthat underly a healthy democracy,
p65
aVlike collaboration and empowerment
p66
aVand participation and enterprise,
p67
aVare the same values that underly the Internet.
p68
aVAnd so it's no surprise that many hackers
p69
aVare turning their attention to the problem of government.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut before I give you a few examples
p72
aVof what civic hacking looks like,
p73
aVI want to make clear that you don't have
p74
aVto be a programmer to be a civic hacker.
p75
aVYou just have to believe that you can bring
p76
aVa 21st-century tool set to bear
p77
aVon the problems that government faces.
p78
aVAnd we hear all the time from our community
p79
aVof civic hackers at Code for America
p80
aVthat they didn't understand how much nontechnical work
p81
aVactually went into civic hacking projects.
p82
aVSo keep that in mind.
p83
aVAll of you are potential civic hackers.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo what does civic hacking look like?
p86
aVOur team last year in Honolulu,
p87
aVwhich in this case was three full-time fellows
p88
aVwho were doing a year of public service,
p89
aVwere asked by the city to rebuild the website.
p90
aVAnd it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages
p91
aVwhich just wasn't going to be possible
p92
aVin the few months that they had.
p93
aVSo instead, they decided to build a parallel site
p94
aVthat better conformed to how citizens actually
p95
aVwant to interact with information on a city website.
p96
aVThey're looking for answers to questions,
p97
aVand they want to take action when they're done,
p98
aVwhich is really hard to do from a site
p99
aVthat looks like this.
p100
aVSo our team built Honolulu Answers,
p101
aVwhich is a super-simple search interface
p102
aVwhere you enter a search term or a question
p103
aVand get back plain language answers
p104
aVthat drive a user towards action.
p105
aVNow the site itself was easy enough to build,
p106
aVbut the team was faced with the challenge
p107
aVof how they populate all of the content.
p108
aVIt would have taken the three of them
p109
aVa very long time,
p110
aVespecially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu.
p111
aVAnd so they did something that's really radical,
p112
aVwhen you think about how government
p113
aVis used to working.
p114
aVThey asked citizens to write the content.
p115
aVSo you've heard of a hack-a-thon.
p116
aVThey held a write-a-thon,
p117
aVwhere on one Saturday afternoon \u2014
p118
aV("What do I do about wild pigs  being a nuisance?") (Laughter) \u2014
p119
aVWild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu, apparently.
p120
aVIn one Saturday afternoon,
p121
aVthey were able to populate most of the content
p122
aVfor most of the frequently asked questions,
p123
aVbut more importantly than that,
p124
aVthey created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself,
p127
aVbut it gets more awesome.
p128
aVOn the National Day of Civic Hacking
p129
aVthis past June in Oakland, where I live,
p130
aVthe Code For America team in Oakland
p131
aVtook the open source code base of Honolulu Answers
p132
aVand turned it into Oakland Answers,
p133
aVand again we held a write-a-thon
p134
aVwhere we took the most frequently asked questions
p135
aVand had citizens write the answers to them,
p136
aVand I got into the act.
p137
aVI authored this answer, and a few others.
p138
aVAnd I'm trying to this day to articulate
p139
aVthe sense of empowerment and responsibility
p140
aVthat I feel for the place that I live
p141
aVbased simply on this small act of participation.
p142
aVAnd by stitching together my small act
p143
aVwith the thousands of other small acts of participation
p144
aVthat we're enabling through civic hacking,
p145
aVwe think we can reenergize citizenship
p146
aVand restore trust in government.
p147
aa(lp148
VAt this point, you may be wondering
p149
aVwhat city officials think of all this.
p150
aVThey actually love it.
p151
aVAs most of you guys know, cities are being asked
p152
aVevery day to do more with less,
p153
aVand they're always looking for innovative solutions
p154
aVto entrenched problems.
p155
aVSo when you give citizens a way to participate
p156
aVbeyond attending a town hall meeting,
p157
aVcities can actually capture
p158
aVthe capacity in their communities
p159
aVto do the business of government.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow I don't want to leave the impression
p162
aVthat civic hacking is just an American phenomenon.
p163
aVIt's happening across the globe,
p164
aVand one of my favorite examples
p165
aVis from Mexico City, where earlier this year,
p166
aVthe Mexico House of Representatives
p167
aVentered into a contract with a software development firm
p168
aVto build an app that legislators would use
p169
aVto track bills.
p170
aVSo this was just for the handful of legislators
p171
aVin the House.
p172
aVAnd the contract was a two-year contract
p173
aVfor 9.3 million dollars.
p174
aVNow a lot of people were really angry about this,
p175
aVespecially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars
p176
aVwas an absolutely outrageous amount of money
p177
aVfor what was a very simple app.
p178
aVBut instead of taking to the streets,
p179
aVthey issued a challenge.
p180
aVThey asked programmers in Mexico
p181
aVto build something better and cheaper,
p182
aVand they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars \u2014
p183
aV10,000 times cheaper
p184
aVthan the government contract,
p185
aVand they gave the entrants 10 days.
p186
aVAnd in those 10 days,
p187
aVthey submitted 173 apps,
p188
aVfive of which were presented to Congress
p189
aVand are still in the app store today.
p190
aVAnd because of this action,
p191
aVthat contract was vacated,
p192
aVand now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City
p193
aVwhich is home to one of our partners,
p194
aVCode for Mexico City.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd so what you see in all three of these places,
p197
aVin Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City,
p198
aVare the elements that are at the core of civic hacking.
p199
aVIt's citizens who saw things that could be working better
p200
aVand they decided to fix them,
p201
aVand through that work, they're creating
p202
aVa 21st-century ecosystem of participation.
p203
aVThey're creating a whole new set of ways
p204
aVfor citizens to be involved,
p205
aVbesides voting or signing a petition or protesting.
p206
aVThey can actually build government.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo back to our friend Ben Franklin,
p209
aVwho, one of his lesser-known accomplishments
p210
aVwas that in 1736 he founded
p211
aVthe first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia,
p212
aVcalled a brigade.
p213
aVAnd it's because he and his friends noticed
p214
aVthat the city was having trouble keeping up
p215
aVwith all the fires that were happening in the city,
p216
aVso in true civic hacker fashion,
p217
aVthey built a solution.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd we have our own brigades at Code for America
p220
aVworking on the projects that I've just described,
p221
aVand we want to ask you
p222
aVto follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps
p223
aVand come join us.
p224
aVWe have 31 brigades in the U.S.
p225
aVWe are pleased to announce today
p226
aVthat we're opening up the  brigade to international cities
p227
aVfor the first time,
p228
aVstarting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland.
p229
aVYou can find out if there's a brigade where you live
p230
aVat brigade.codeforamerica.org,
p231
aVand if there's not a brigade where you live, we will help you.
p232
aVWe've created a tool kit which also lives
p233
aVat brigade.codeforamerica.org,
p234
aVand we will support you along the way.
p235
aVOur goal is to create a global network of civic hackers
p236
aVwho are innovating on the existing system
p237
aVin order to build tools that will solve
p238
aVentrenched problems,
p239
aVthat will support local government,
p240
aVand that will empower citizens.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo please come hack with us.
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you.

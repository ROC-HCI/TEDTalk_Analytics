VMy talk today is about something
p5
aVmaybe a couple of you have already heard about.
p6
aVIt's called the Arab Spring.
p7
aVAnyone heard of it?
p8
aa(lp9
V(Applause)
p10
aa(lp11
VSo in 2011, power shifted,
p12
aVfrom the few to the many,
p13
aVfrom oval offices to central squares,
p14
aVfrom carefully guarded airwaves
p15
aVto open-source networks.
p16
aVBut before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation,
p17
aVthere were representative surveys
p18
aValready giving people a voice
p19
aVin quieter but still powerful ways.
p20
aa(lp21
VI study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup.
p22
aVSince 2001,
p23
aVwe've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people \u2014
p24
aVyoung and old, men and women,
p25
aVeducated and illiterate.
p26
aVMy talk today draws on this research
p27
aVto reveal why Arabs rose up
p28
aVand what they want now.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow this region's very diverse,
p31
aVand every country is unique.
p32
aVBut those who revolted
p33
aVshared a common set of grievances
p34
aVand have similar demands today.
p35
aVI'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt.
p36
aVIt has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there, of course.
p37
aVBut it's the largest Arab country
p38
aVand it's also one with a great deal of influence.
p39
aVBut I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region
p40
aVto look at the mundane topics
p41
aVof Arab views of religion and politics
p42
aVand how this impacts women,
p43
aVrevealing some surprises along the way.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo after analyzing mounds of data,
p46
aVwhat we discovered was this:
p47
aVUnemployment and poverty alone
p48
aVdid not lead to the Arab revolts of 2011.
p49
aVIf an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor
p50
aVsparked these revolutions,
p51
aVit was the difference between what Arabs experienced
p52
aVand what they expected
p53
aVthat provided the fuel.
p54
aa(lp55
VTo tell you what I mean,
p56
aVconsider this trend in Egypt.
p57
aVOn paper the country was doing great.
p58
aVIn fact, it attracted accolades
p59
aVfrom multinational organizations
p60
aVbecause of its economic growth.
p61
aVBut under the surface was a very different reality.
p62
aVIn 2010, right before the revolution,
p63
aVeven though GDP per capita
p64
aVhad been growing at five percent for several years,
p65
aVEgyptians had never felt worse about their lives.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow this is very unusual,
p68
aVbecause globally we find that, not surprisingly,
p69
aVpeople feel better as their country gets richer.
p70
aVAnd that's because they have better job opportunities
p71
aVand their state offers better social services.
p72
aVBut it was exactly the opposite in Egypt.
p73
aVAs the country got more well-off,
p74
aVunemployment actually rose
p75
aVand people's satisfaction
p76
aVwith things like housing and education plummeted.
p77
aVBut it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.
p78
aVIt was also people's deep longing for freedom.
p79
aVContrary to the clash of civilizations theory,
p80
aVArabs didn't despise Western liberty,
p81
aVthey desired it.
p82
aa(lp83
VAs early as 2001,
p84
aVwe asked Arabs, and Muslims in general around the world,
p85
aVwhat they admired most about the West.
p86
aVAmong the most frequent responses
p87
aVwas liberty and justice.
p88
aVIn their own words to an open-ended question
p89
aVwe heard, "Their political system is transparent
p90
aVand it's following democracy in its true sense."
p91
aVAnother said it was "liberty and freedom
p92
aVand being open-minded with each other."
p93
aVMajorities as high as 90 percent and greater
p94
aVin Egypt, Indonesia and Iran
p95
aVtold us in 2005
p96
aVthat if they were to write a new constitution
p97
aVfor a theoretical new country
p98
aVthat they would guarantee freedom of speech
p99
aVas a fundamental right,
p100
aVespecially in Egypt.
p101
aVEighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy
p102
aVwould help Muslims progress \u2014
p103
aVthe highest percentage of any country we surveyed.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut pressed up against these democratic aspirations
p106
aVwas a very different day-to-day experience,
p107
aVespecially in Egypt.
p108
aVWhile aspiring to democracy the most,
p109
aVthey were the least likely population in the world
p110
aVto say that they had actually voiced their opinion
p111
aVto a public official in the last month \u2014
p112
aVat only four percent.
p113
aVSo while economic development made a few people rich,
p114
aVit left many more worse off.
p115
aVAs people felt less and less free,
p116
aVthey also felt less and less provided for.
p117
aVSo rather than viewing their former regimes
p118
aVas generous if overprotective fathers,
p119
aVthey viewed them as essentially prison wardens.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's 30-year rule,
p122
aVthey potentially could be
p123
aVan example for the region.
p124
aVIf Egypt is to succeed
p125
aVat building a society based on the rule of law,
p126
aVit could be a model.
p127
aVIf, however,
p128
aVthe core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed,
p129
aVthe consequences could be catastrophic \u2014
p130
aVnot just for Egypt,
p131
aVbut for the entire region.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe signs don't look good, some have said.
p134
aVIslamists, not the young liberals that sparked the revolution,
p135
aVwon the majority in Parliament.
p136
aVThe military council
p137
aVhas cracked down on civil society and protests
p138
aVand the country's economy continues to suffer.
p139
aVEvaluating Egypt on this basis alone, however,
p140
aVignores the real revolution.
p141
aVBecause Egyptians are more optimistic
p142
aVthan they have been in years,
p143
aVfar less divided on religious-secular lines
p144
aVthan we would think
p145
aVand poised for the demands of democracy.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhether they support Islamists or liberals,
p148
aVEgyptians' priorities for this government are identical,
p149
aVand they are jobs, stability and education,
p150
aVnot moral policing.
p151
aVBut most of all,
p152
aVfor the first time in decades,
p153
aVthey expect to be active participants, not spectators,
p154
aVin the affairs of their country.
p155
aa(lp156
VI was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians
p157
aVfrom Egypt and Tunisia
p158
aVa couple of weeks ago.
p159
aVAnd what really struck me about them
p160
aVwas that they weren't only optimistic,
p161
aVbut they kind of struck me as nervous,
p162
aVfor lack of a better word.
p163
aVOne said to me,
p164
aV"Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football" \u2014
p165
aVor soccer, as we say in America \u2014
p166
aV"and now they gather to watch Parliament."
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aV"They're really watching us,
p169
aVand we can't help but worry
p170
aVthat we're not going to live up to their expectations."
p171
aVAnd what really struck me
p172
aVis that less than 24 months ago,
p173
aVit was the people that were nervous
p174
aVabout being watched by their government.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd the reason that they're expecting a lot
p177
aVis because they have a new-found hope for the future.
p178
aVSo right before the revolution
p179
aVwe said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives,
p180
aVbut not only that, they thought their future would be no better.
p181
aVWhat really changed after the ouster of Mubarak
p182
aVwasn't that life got easier.
p183
aVIt actually got harder.
p184
aVBut people's expectations for their future
p185
aVwent up significantly.
p186
aVAnd this hope, this optimism,
p187
aVendured a year of turbulent transition.
p188
aa(lp189
VOne reason that there's this optimism
p190
aVis because, contrary to what many people have said,
p191
aVmost Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways.
p192
aVSo while Egyptians were known
p193
aVfor their single-digit turnout
p194
aVin elections before the revolution,
p195
aVthe last election had around 70 percent voter turnout \u2014
p196
aVmen and women.
p197
aVWhere scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 \u2014
p198
aVI'm surprised it was a quarter \u2014
p199
aV90 percent thought that this last election was honest.
p200
aVNow why this matters
p201
aVis because we discovered a link
p202
aVbetween people's faith in their democratic process
p203
aVand their faith that oppressed people
p204
aVcan change their situation
p205
aVthrough peaceful means alone.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VNow I know what some of you are thinking.
p210
aVThe Egyptian people,
p211
aVand many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition,
p212
aVhave very high expectations of the government.
p213
aVThey're just victims of a long-time autocracy,
p214
aVexpecting a paternal state
p215
aVto solve all their problems.
p216
aVBut this conclusion would ignore
p217
aVa tectonic shift taking place in Egypt
p218
aVfar from the cameras in Tahrir Square.
p219
aVAnd that is Egyptians' elevated expectations
p220
aVare placed first on themselves.
p221
aa(lp222
VIn the country once known for its passive resignation,
p223
aVwhere, as bad as things got,
p224
aVonly four percent expressed their opinion to a public official,
p225
aVtoday 90 percent tell us
p226
aVthat if there's a problem in their community,
p227
aVit's up to them to fix it.
p228
aV(Applause)
p229
aVAnd three-fourths
p230
aVbelieve they not only have the responsibility,
p231
aVbut the power to make change.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd this empowerment
p234
aValso applies to women,
p235
aVwhose role in the revolts
p236
aVcannot be underestimated.
p237
aVThey were doctors and dissidents,
p238
aVartists and organizers.
p239
aVA full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas
p240
aVto ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt
p241
aVwere women.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)
p244
aa(lp245
VNow people have raised some real concerns
p246
aVabout what the rise of Islamist parties means for women.
p247
aVWhat we've found about the role of religion in law
p248
aVand the role of religion in society
p249
aVis that there's no female consensus.
p250
aVWe found that women in one country
p251
aVlook more like the men in that country
p252
aVthan their female counterparts across the border.
p253
aVNow what this suggests
p254
aVis that how women view religion's role in society
p255
aVis shaped more by their own country's culture and context
p256
aVthan one monolithic view
p257
aVthat religion is simply bad for women.
p258
aVWhere women agree, however,
p259
aVis on their own role,
p260
aVand that it must be central and active.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country \u2014
p263
aVon the issue of women's rights.
p264
aVNow how men feel about women's rights
p265
aVmatters to the future of this region.
p266
aVBecause we discovered a link
p267
aVbetween men's support for women's employment
p268
aVand how many women are actually employed
p269
aVin professional fields in that country.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo the question becomes,
p272
aVWhat drives men's support for women's rights?
p273
aVWhat about men's views of religion and law?
p274
aV[Does] a man's opinion
p275
aVof the role of religion in politics
p276
aVshape their view of women's rights?
p277
aVThe answer is no.
p278
aVWe found absolutely no correlation,
p279
aVno impact whatsoever,
p280
aVbetween these two variables.
p281
aVWhat drives men's support for women's employment
p282
aVis men's employment,
p283
aVtheir level of education
p284
aVas well as a high score
p285
aVon their country's U.N. Human Development Index.
p286
aVWhat this means
p287
aVis that human development,
p288
aVnot secularization,
p289
aVis what's key to women's empowerment
p290
aVin the transforming Middle East.
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd the transformation continues.
p293
aVFrom Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street,
p294
aVit has never been more important
p295
aVto understand the aspirations
p296
aVof ordinary people.
p297
aa(lp298
VThank you.

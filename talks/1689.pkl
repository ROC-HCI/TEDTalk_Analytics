VSo raise your hand if you know someone
p5
aVin your immediate family or circle of friends
p6
aVwho suffers from some form of mental illness.
p7
aVYeah. I thought so. Not surprised.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd raise your hand if you think that
p10
aVbasic research on fruit flies has anything to do
p11
aVwith understanding mental illness in humans.
p12
aVYeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised.
p13
aVI can see I've got my work cut out for me here.
p14
aa(lp15
VAs we heard from Dr. Insel this morning,
p16
aVpsychiatric disorders like autism, depression and schizophrenia
p17
aVtake a terrible toll on human suffering.
p18
aVWe know much less about their treatment
p19
aVand the understanding of their basic mechanisms
p20
aVthan we do about diseases of the body.
p21
aVThink about it: In 2013,
p22
aVthe second decade of the millennium,
p23
aVif you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis
p24
aVand you go to your doctor, you get bone scans,
p25
aVbiopsies and blood tests.
p26
aVIn 2013, if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis,
p27
aVyou go to your doctor, and what do you get?
p28
aVA questionnaire.
p29
aVNow, part of the reason for this is that we have
p30
aVan oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view
p31
aVof the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.
p32
aVWe tend to view them \u2014
p33
aVand the popular press aids and abets this view \u2014
p34
aVas chemical imbalances in the brain,
p35
aVas if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup
p36
aVfull of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.
p37
aVThis view is conditioned by the fact
p38
aVthat many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders,
p39
aVlike Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry,
p40
aVas if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup.
p41
aVBut that can't be the answer,
p42
aVbecause these drugs actually don't work all that well.
p43
aVA lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them,
p44
aVbecause of their unpleasant side effects.
p45
aVThese drugs have so many side effects
p46
aVbecause using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder
p47
aVis a bit like trying to change your engine oil
p48
aVby opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.
p49
aVSome of it will dribble into the right place,
p50
aVbut a lot of it will do more harm than good.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, an emerging view
p53
aVthat you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning,
p54
aVis that psychiatric disorders are actually
p55
aVdisturbances of neural circuits that mediate
p56
aVemotion, mood and affect.
p57
aVWhen we think about cognition,
p58
aVwe analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem.
p59
aVWell it turns out that the computer analogy
p60
aVis just as valid for emotion.
p61
aVIt's just that we don't tend to think about it that way.
p62
aVBut we know much less about the circuit basis
p63
aVof psychiatric disorders
p64
aVbecause of the overwhelming dominance
p65
aVof this chemical imbalance hypothesis.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, it's not that chemicals are not important
p68
aVin psychiatric disorders.
p69
aVIt's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup.
p70
aVRather, they're released in very specific locations
p71
aVand they act on specific synapses
p72
aVto change the flow of information in the brain.
p73
aVSo if we ever really want to understand
p74
aVthe biological basis of psychiatric disorders,
p75
aVwe need to pinpoint these locations in the brain
p76
aVwhere these chemicals act.
p77
aVOtherwise, we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines
p78
aVand suffering the consequences.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow to begin to overcome our ignorance
p81
aVof the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry,
p82
aVit's helpful to work on what we biologists call
p83
aV"model organisms,"
p84
aVanimals like fruit flies and laboratory mice,
p85
aVin which we can apply powerful genetic techniques
p86
aVto molecularly identify and pinpoint
p87
aVspecific classes of neurons,
p88
aVas you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning.
p89
aVMoreover, once we can do that,
p90
aVwe can actually activate specific neurons
p91
aVor we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.
p92
aVSo if we inhibit a particular type of neuron,
p93
aVand we find that a behavior is blocked,
p94
aVwe can conclude that those neurons
p95
aVare necessary for that behavior.
p96
aVOn the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons
p97
aVand we find that that produces the behavior,
p98
aVwe can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.
p99
aVSo in this way, by doing this kind of test,
p100
aVwe can draw cause and effect relationships
p101
aVbetween the activity of specific neurons
p102
aVin particular circuits and particular behaviors,
p103
aVsomething that is extremely difficult, if not impossible,
p104
aVto do right now in humans.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut can an organism like a fruit fly, which is \u2014
p107
aVit's a great model organism
p108
aVbecause it's got a small brain,
p109
aVit's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors,
p110
aVit breeds quickly, and it's cheap.
p111
aVBut can an organism like this
p112
aVteach us anything about emotion-like states?
p113
aVDo these organisms even have emotion-like states,
p114
aVor are they just little digital robots?
p115
aa(lp116
VCharles Darwin believed that insects have emotion
p117
aVand express them in their behaviors, as he wrote
p118
aVin his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals.
p119
aVAnd my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well.
p120
aVSeymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila
p121
aVhere at CalTech in the '60s as a model organism
p122
aVto study the connection between genes and behavior.
p123
aVSeymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.
p124
aVHe was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here,
p125
aVand Seymour taught me both to love flies
p126
aVand also to play with science.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo how do we ask this question?
p129
aVIt's one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states,
p130
aVbut how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?
p131
aVNow, in humans we often infer emotional states,
p132
aVas you'll hear later today, from facial expressions.
p133
aVHowever, it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVIt's kind of like landing on Mars
p136
aVand looking out the window of your spaceship
p137
aVat all the little green men who are surrounding it
p138
aVand trying to figure out, "How do I find out
p139
aVif they have emotions or not?"
p140
aVWhat can we do? It's not so easy.
p141
aa(lp142
VWell, one of the ways that we can start
p143
aVis to try to come up with some general characteristics
p144
aVor properties of emotion-like states
p145
aVsuch as arousal, and see if we can identify
p146
aVany fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties.
p147
aVSo three important ones that I can think of
p148
aVare persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.
p149
aVPersistence means long-lasting.
p150
aVWe all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion
p151
aVcauses that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone.
p152
aVGradations of intensity means what it sounds like.
p153
aVYou can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion.
p154
aVIf you're a little bit unhappy, the corners of your mouth
p155
aVturn down and you sniffle,
p156
aVand if you're very unhappy, tears pour down your face
p157
aVand you might sob.
p158
aVValence means good or bad, positive or negative.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing
p161
aVthe kind of behavior that you see
p162
aVby the proverbial wasp at the picnic table,
p163
aVyou know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger
p164
aVthe more vigorously you try to swat it away,
p165
aVand it seems to keep getting irritated.
p166
aVSo we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat,
p167
aVin which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies
p168
aVin these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench
p169
aVand blow them away.
p170
aVAnd what we found is that if we gave these flies
p171
aVin the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row,
p172
aVthey became somewhat hyperactive
p173
aVand continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped
p174
aVand took a while to calm down.
p175
aVSo we quantified this behavior
p176
aVusing custom locomotor tracking software
p177
aVdeveloped with my collaborator Pietro Perona,
p178
aVwho's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech.
p179
aVAnd what this quantification showed us is that,
p180
aVupon experiencing a train of these air puffs,
p181
aVthe flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity
p182
aVwhich is persistent, long-lasting,
p183
aVand also appears to be graded.
p184
aVMore puffs, or more intense puffs,
p185
aVmake the state last for a longer period of time.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo now we wanted to try to understand something
p188
aVabout what controls the duration of this state.
p189
aVSo we decided to use our puff-o-mat
p190
aVand our automated tracking software
p191
aVto screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies
p192
aVto see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.
p193
aVAnd this is one of the great things about fruit flies.
p194
aVThere are repositories where you can just pick up the phone
p195
aVand order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants
p196
aVand screen them in your assay and then find out
p197
aVwhat gene is affected in the mutation.
p198
aVSo doing the screen, we discovered one mutant
p199
aVthat took much longer than normal to calm down
p200
aVafter the air puffs,
p201
aVand when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation,
p202
aVit turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.
p203
aVThat's right \u2014 flies, like people, have dopamine,
p204
aVand it acts on their brains and on their synapses
p205
aVthrough the same dopamine receptor molecules
p206
aVthat you and I have.
p207
aVDopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain,
p208
aVincluding in attention, arousal, reward,
p209
aVand disorders of the dopamine system have been linked
p210
aVto a number of mental disorders including drug abuse,
p211
aVParkinson's disease, and ADHD.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.
p214
aVWe tend to infer the normal function of something
p215
aVby what doesn't happen when we take it away,
p216
aVby the opposite of what we see when we take it away.
p217
aVSo when we take away the dopamine receptor
p218
aVand the flies take longer to calm down,
p219
aVfrom that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine
p220
aVis to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff.
p221
aVAnd that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD,
p222
aVwhich has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.
p223
aVIndeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies
p224
aVby feeding them cocaine
p225
aVafter getting the appropriate DEA license
p226
aV\u2014 oh my God \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p227
aVwe find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies
p228
aVcalm down faster than normal flies do,
p229
aVand that's also reminiscent of ADHD,
p230
aVwhich is often treated with drugs like Ritalin
p231
aVthat act similarly to cocaine.
p232
aVSo slowly I began to realize that what started out
p233
aVas a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies
p234
aVmight actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder.
p235
aa(lp236
VNow, how far does this analogy go?
p237
aVAs many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD
p238
aValso have learning disabilities.
p239
aVIs that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies?
p240
aVRemarkably, the answer is yes.
p241
aVAs Seymour showed back in the 1970s,
p242
aVflies, like songbirds, as you just heard,
p243
aVare capable of learning.
p244
aVYou can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue,
p245
aVif you pair that odor with a shock.
p246
aVThen when you give those trained flies the chance to choose
p247
aVbetween a tube with the shock-paired odor and another odor,
p248
aVit avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock.
p249
aVWell, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies,
p250
aVthey don't learn. Their learning score is zero.
p251
aVThey flunk out of CalTech.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo that means that these flies have two abnormalities,
p254
aVor phenotypes, as we geneticists call them,
p255
aVthat one finds in ADHD: hyperactivity and learning disability.
p256
aVNow what's the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?
p257
aVIn ADHD, it's often assumed that the hyperactivity
p258
aVcauses the learning disability.
p259
aVThe kids can't sit still long enough to focus, so they don't learn.
p260
aVBut it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities
p261
aVthat cause the hyperactivity.
p262
aVBecause the kids can't learn, they look for other things to distract their attention.
p263
aVAnd a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all
p264
aVbetween learning disabilities and hyperactivity,
p265
aVbut that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD.
p266
aa(lp267
VNow people have been wondering about this for a long time
p268
aVin humans, but in flies we can actually test this.
p269
aVAnd the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind
p270
aVof the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics.
p271
aVWe take our dopamine receptor mutant flies
p272
aVand we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor
p273
aVby putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene
p274
aVback into the fly brain.
p275
aVBut in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons
p276
aVand not in others, and then we test each of these flies
p277
aVfor their ability to learn and for hyperactivity.
p278
aa(lp279
VRemarkably, we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities.
p280
aVIf we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back
p281
aVin this elliptical structure called the central complex,
p282
aVthe flies are no longer hyperactive, but they still can't learn.
p283
aVOn the other hand, if we put the receptor back in a different structure
p284
aVcalled the mushroom body,
p285
aVthe learning deficit is rescued, the flies learn well,
p286
aVbut they're still hyperactive.
p287
aVWhat that tells us is that dopamine
p288
aVis not bathing the brain of these flies like soup.
p289
aVRather, it's acting to control two different functions
p290
aVon two different circuits,
p291
aVso the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies
p292
aVis that the same receptor is controlling two different functions
p293
aVin two different regions of the brain.
p294
aVWhether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans
p295
aVwe don't know, but these kinds of results
p296
aVshould at least cause us to consider that possibility.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever
p299
aVthat the brain is not a bag of chemical soup,
p300
aVand it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders
p301
aVjust by changing the flavor of the soup.
p302
aVWhat we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge
p303
aVto try to design a new generation of treatments
p304
aVthat are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain
p305
aVthat are affected in particular psychiatric disorders.
p306
aVIf we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders
p307
aVwithout the unpleasant side effects,
p308
aVputting the oil back in our mental engines,
p309
aVjust where it's needed. Thank you very much.

VHave you ever wondered
p5
aVwhy extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim-majority countries
p6
aVover the course of the last decade?
p7
aVHave you ever wondered
p8
aVhow such a situation can be turned around?
p9
aVHave you ever looked at the Arab uprisings
p10
aVand thought, "How could we have predicted that?"
p11
aVor "How could we have better prepared for that?"
p12
aVWell my personal story, my personal journey,
p13
aVwhat brings me to the TED stage here today,
p14
aVis a demonstration of exactly what's been happening
p15
aVin Muslim-majority countries
p16
aVover the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond.
p17
aVI want to share some of that story with you,
p18
aVbut also some of my ideas around change
p19
aVand the role of social movements in creating change
p20
aVin Muslim-majority societies.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo let me begin
p23
aVby first of all giving a very, very brief history of time,
p24
aVif I may indulge.
p25
aVIn medieval societies there were defined allegiances.
p26
aVAn identity was defined
p27
aVprimarily by religion.
p28
aVAnd then we moved on into an era in the 19th century
p29
aVwith the rise of a European nation-state
p30
aVwhere identities and allegiances were defined
p31
aVby ethnicity.
p32
aVSo identity was primarily defined by ethnicity,
p33
aVand the nation-state reflected that.
p34
aVIn the age of globalization, we moved on.
p35
aVI call it the era of citizenship \u2014
p36
aVwhere people could be from multi-racial, multi-ethnic backgrounds,
p37
aVbut all be equal as citizens
p38
aVin a state.
p39
aVYou could be American-Italian; you could be American-Irish;
p40
aVyou could be British-Pakistani.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut I believe now
p43
aVthat we're moving into a new age,
p44
aVand that age The New York Times dubbed recently
p45
aVas "the age of behavior."
p46
aVHow I define the age of behavior
p47
aVis a period of transnational allegiances,
p48
aVwhere identity is defined more so
p49
aVby ideas and narratives.
p50
aVAnd these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders
p51
aVare increasingly beginning to affect
p52
aVthe way in which people behave.
p53
aVNow this is not all necessarily good news,
p54
aVbecause it's also my belief
p55
aVthat hatred has gone global
p56
aVjust as much as love.
p57
aVBut actually it's my belief
p58
aVthat the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior,
p59
aVup until now, up until recent times,
p60
aVup until the last six months,
p61
aVthe people who have been capitalizing most
p62
aVon the age of behavior
p63
aVand the transnational allegiances,
p64
aVusing digital activism
p65
aVand other sorts of borderless technologies,
p66
aVthose who've been benefiting from this
p67
aVhave been extremists.
p68
aVAnd that's something which I'd like to elaborate on.
p69
aa(lp70
VIf we look at Islamists,
p71
aVif we look at the phenomenon
p72
aVof far-right fascists,
p73
aVone thing they've been very good at,
p74
aVone thing that they've actually been exceeding in,
p75
aVis communicating across borders,
p76
aVusing technologies to organize themselves,
p77
aVto propagate their message
p78
aVand to create truly global phenomena.
p79
aVNow I should know,
p80
aVbecause for 13 years of my life,
p81
aVI was involved in an extreme Islamist organization.
p82
aVAnd I was actually a potent force
p83
aVin spreading ideas across borders,
p84
aVand I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism
p85
aVas distinct from Islam the faith,
p86
aVand the way in which it influenced my co-religionists
p87
aVacross the world.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd my story, my personal story,
p90
aVis truly evidence for the age of behavior
p91
aVthat I'm attempting to elaborate upon here.
p92
aVI was, by the way \u2014 I'm an Essex lad,
p93
aVborn and raised in Essex in the U.K.
p94
aVAnyone who's from England
p95
aVknows the reputation we have from Essex.
p96
aVBut having been born in Essex,
p97
aVat the age of 16,
p98
aVI joined an organization.
p99
aVAt the age of 17, I was recruiting people from Cambridge University
p100
aVto this organization.
p101
aVAt the age of 19,
p102
aVI was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K.
p103
aVAt the age of 21, I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan.
p104
aVAt the age of 22,
p105
aVI was co-founding this organization in Denmark.
p106
aVBy the age of 24,
p107
aVI found myself convicted in prison in Egypt,
p108
aVbeing blacklisted from three countries in the world
p109
aVfor attempting to overthrow their governments,
p110
aVbeing subjected to torture
p111
aVin Egyptian jails
p112
aVand sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow that journey,
p115
aVand what took me from Essex all the way across the world \u2014
p116
aVby the way, we were laughing at democratic activists.
p117
aVWe felt they were from the age of yesteryear.
p118
aVWe felt that they were out of date.
p119
aVI learned how to use email
p120
aVfrom the extremist organization that I used.
p121
aVI learned how to effectively communicate across borders
p122
aVwithout being detected.
p123
aVEventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt.
p124
aVBut the way in which I learned
p125
aVto use technology to my advantage
p126
aVwas because I was within an extremist organization
p127
aVthat was forced to think beyond
p128
aVthe confines of the nation-state.
p129
aVThe age of behavior: where ideas and narratives
p130
aVwere increasingly defining behavior
p131
aVand identity and allegiances.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo as I said, we looked to the status quo
p134
aVand ridiculed it.
p135
aVAnd it's not just Islamist extremists that did this.
p136
aVBut even if you look across
p137
aVthe mood music in Europe of late,
p138
aVfar-right fascism is also on the rise.
p139
aVA form of anti-Islam rhetoric
p140
aVis also on the rise
p141
aVand it's transnational.
p142
aVAnd the consequences that this is having
p143
aVis that it's affecting the political climate
p144
aVacross Europe.
p145
aVWhat's actually happening
p146
aVis that what were previously localized parochialisms,
p147
aVindividual or groupings of extremists
p148
aVwho were isolated from one another,
p149
aVhave become interconnected in a globalized way
p150
aVand have thus become, or are becoming, mainstream.
p151
aVBecause the Internet and connection technologies
p152
aVare connecting them across the world.
p153
aa(lp154
VIf you look at the rise of far-right fascism across Europe of late,
p155
aVyou will see some things that are happening
p156
aVthat are influencing domestic politics,
p157
aVyet the phenomenon is transnational.
p158
aVIn certain countries, mosque minarets are being banned.
p159
aVIn others, headscarves are being banned.
p160
aVIn others, kosher and halal meat are being banned,
p161
aVas we speak.
p162
aVAnd on the flip side,
p163
aVwe have transnational Islamist extremists
p164
aVdoing the same thing across their own societies.
p165
aVAnd so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected
p166
aVin a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream.
p167
aVNow that never would have been possible before.
p168
aVThey would have felt isolated,
p169
aVuntil these sorts of technologies came around
p170
aVand connected them in a way
p171
aVthat made them feel part of a larger phenomenon.
p172
aa(lp173
VWhere does that leave democracy aspirants?
p174
aVWell I believe they're getting left far behind.
p175
aVAnd I'll give you an example here at this stage.
p176
aVIf any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot:
p177
aVthere's a man called Anwar al-Awlaki.
p178
aVAs an American citizen, ethnically a Yemeni,
p179
aVin hiding currently in Yemen,
p180
aVwho inspired a Nigerian,
p181
aVson of the head of Nigeria's national bank.
p182
aVThis Nigerian student studied in London, trained in Yemen,
p183
aVboarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America.
p184
aVIn the meanwhile,
p185
aVthe Old mentality with a capital O,
p186
aVwas represented by his father, the head of the Nigerian bank,
p187
aVwarning the CIA that his own son was about to attack,
p188
aVand this warning fell on deaf ears.
p189
aVThe Old mentality with a capital O,
p190
aVas represented by the nation-state,
p191
aVnot yet fully into the age of behavior,
p192
aVnot recognizing the power of transnational social movements,
p193
aVgot left behind.
p194
aVAnd the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded
p195
aVin attacking the United States of America.
p196
aVAgain with the example of the far right:
p197
aVthat we find, ironically,
p198
aVxenophobic nationalists
p199
aVare utilizing the benefits of globalization.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo why are they succeeding?
p202
aVAnd why are democracy aspirants falling behind?
p203
aVWell we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this.
p204
aVAnd a social movement is comprised, in my view,
p205
aVit's comprised of four main characteristics.
p206
aVIt's comprised of ideas and narratives
p207
aVand symbols and leaders.
p208
aVI'll talk you through one example,
p209
aVand that's the example that everyone here will be aware of,
p210
aVand that's the example of Al-Qaeda.
p211
aVIf I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda,
p212
aVthat's something that comes to your mind immediately.
p213
aVIf I ask you to think of their narratives \u2014
p214
aVthe West being at war with Islam, the need to defend Islam against the West \u2014
p215
aVthese narratives, they come to your mind immediately.
p216
aVIncidentally, the difference between ideas and narratives:
p217
aVthe idea is the cause that one believes in;
p218
aVand the narrative is the way to sell that cause \u2014
p219
aVthe propaganda, if you like, of the cause.
p220
aVSo the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately.
p221
aa(lp222
VIf I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders,
p223
aVthey come to your mind immediately.
p224
aVOne of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently.
p225
aVSo these symbols and these leaders
p226
aVcome to your mind immediately.
p227
aVAnd that's the power of social movements.
p228
aVThey're transnational, and they bond around these ideas and narratives
p229
aVand these symbols and these leaders.
p230
aVHowever,
p231
aVif I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan,
p232
aVand I ask you to think
p233
aVof the symbols and the leaders for democracy
p234
aVin Pakistan today,
p235
aVyou'll be hard pressed
p236
aVto think beyond perhaps
p237
aVthe assassination of Benazir Bhutto.
p238
aVWhich means, by definition,
p239
aVthat particular leader no longer exists.
p240
aa(lp241
VOne of the problems we're facing is, in my view,
p242
aVthat there are no globalized,
p243
aVyouth-led, grassroots social movements
p244
aVadvocating for democratic culture
p245
aVacross Muslim-majority societies.
p246
aVThere is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda, without the terrorism,
p247
aVfor democracy across Muslim-majority societies.
p248
aVThere are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols
p249
aVadvocating the democratic culture on the ground.
p250
aVSo that begs the next question.
p251
aVWhy is it that extremist organizations,
p252
aVwhether of the far-right or of the Islamist extremism \u2014
p253
aVIslamism meaning those who wish to impose
p254
aVone version of Islam over the rest of society \u2014
p255
aVwhy is it that they are succeeding
p256
aVin organizing in a globalized way,
p257
aVwhereas those who aspire to democratic culture
p258
aVare falling behind?
p259
aVAnd I believe that's for four reasons.
p260
aVI believe, number one, it's complacency.
p261
aVBecause those who aspire to democratic culture
p262
aVare in power,
p263
aVor have societies
p264
aVthat are leading globalized, powerful societies,
p265
aVpowerful countries.
p266
aVAnd that level of complacency means
p267
aVthey don't feel the need to advocate for that culture.
p268
aa(lp269
VThe second, I believe,
p270
aVis political correctness.
p271
aVThat we have a hesitation
p272
aVin espousing the universality of democratic culture
p273
aVbecause we are associating that \u2014
p274
aVwe associate believing in the universality of our values \u2014
p275
aVwith extremists.
p276
aVYet actually, whenever we talk about human rights,
p277
aVwe do say that human rights are universal.
p278
aVBut actually going out to propagate that view
p279
aVis associated with either neoconservativism
p280
aVor with Islamist extremism.
p281
aVTo go around saying that I believe
p282
aVdemocratic culture is the best that we've arrived at
p283
aVas a form of political organizing
p284
aVis associated with extremism.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd the third,
p287
aVdemocratic choice in Muslim-majority societies
p288
aVhas been relegated to a political choice,
p289
aVmeaning political parties
p290
aVin many of these societies
p291
aVask people to vote for them
p292
aVas the democratic party,
p293
aVbut then the other parties ask them to vote for them
p294
aVas the military party \u2014
p295
aVwanting to rule by military dictatorship.
p296
aVAnd then you have a third party saying,
p297
aV"Vote for us; we'll establish a theocracy."
p298
aVSo democracy has become merely one political choice
p299
aVamong many other forms
p300
aVof political choices available in those societies.
p301
aVAnd what happens as a result of this
p302
aVis, when those parties are elected,
p303
aVand inevitably they fail,
p304
aVor inevitably they make political mistakes,
p305
aVdemocracy takes the blame
p306
aVfor their political mistakes.
p307
aVAnd then people say, "We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work.
p308
aVLet's bring the military back again."
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd the fourth reason, I believe,
p311
aVis what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance.
p312
aVWhat I mean by that is,
p313
aVif the world superpower today was a communist,
p314
aVit would be much easier for democracy activists
p315
aVto use democracy activism
p316
aVas a form of resistance against colonialism,
p317
aVthan it is today with the world superpower being America,
p318
aVoccupying certain lands
p319
aVand also espousing democratic ideals.
p320
aVSo roughly these four reasons
p321
aVmake it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread
p322
aVas a civilizational choice,
p323
aVnot merely as a political choice.
p324
aa(lp325
VWhen talking about those reasons,
p326
aVlet's break down certain preconceptions.
p327
aVIs it just about grievances?
p328
aVIs it just about a lack of education?
p329
aVWell statistically,
p330
aVthe majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated.
p331
aVStatistically, they are educated, on average,
p332
aVabove the education levels
p333
aVof Western society.
p334
aVAnecdotally, we can demonstrate
p335
aVthat if poverty was the only factor,
p336
aVwell Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia.
p337
aVHis deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a pediatrician \u2014
p338
aVnot an ill-educated man.
p339
aVInternational aid and development has been going on for years,
p340
aVbut extremism in those societies, in many of those societies,
p341
aVhas been on the rise.
p342
aVAnd what I believe is missing
p343
aVis genuine grassroots activism
p344
aVon the ground,
p345
aVin addition to international aid,
p346
aVin addition to education, in addition to health.
p347
aVNot exclusive to these things, but in addition to them,
p348
aVis propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd this is where I believe
p351
aVneoconservatism had it upside-down.
p352
aVNeoconservatism had the philosophy
p353
aVthat you go in with a supply-led approach
p354
aVto impose democratic values from the top down.
p355
aVWhereas Islamists and far-right organizations, for decades,
p356
aVhave been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots.
p357
aVThey've been building civilizational demand for their values
p358
aVon the grassroots,
p359
aVand we've been seeing those societies slowly transition
p360
aVto societies that are increasingly asking for
p361
aVa form of Islamism.
p362
aVMass movements in Pakistan
p363
aVhave been represented after the Arab uprisings
p364
aVmainly by organizations
p365
aVclaiming for some form of theocracy,
p366
aVrather than for a democratic uprising.
p367
aVBecause since pre-partition,
p368
aVthey've been building demand for their ideology on the ground.
p369
aVAnd what's needed is a genuine transnational
p370
aVyouth-led movement
p371
aVthat works to actively advocate
p372
aVfor the democratic culture \u2014
p373
aVwhich is necessarily more
p374
aVthan just elections.
p375
aVBut without freedom of speech, you can't have free and fair elections.
p376
aVWithout human rights, you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign.
p377
aVWithout freedom of belief,
p378
aVyou don't have the right to join organizations.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo what's needed is those organizations on the ground
p381
aVadvocating for the democratic culture itself
p382
aVto create the demand on the ground for this culture.
p383
aVWhat that will do
p384
aVis avoid the problem I was talking about earlier,
p385
aVwhere currently we have political parties presenting democracy
p386
aVas merely a political choice in those societies
p387
aValongside other choices
p388
aVsuch as military rule and theocracy.
p389
aVWhereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level,
p390
aVrather than merely on a political level,
p391
aVa level above politics \u2014
p392
aVmovements that are not political parties,
p393
aVbut are rather creating this civilizational demand
p394
aVfor this democratic culture.
p395
aVWhat we'll have in the end
p396
aVis this ideal that you see on the slide here \u2014
p397
aVthe ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy,
p398
aVnot for a democracy.
p399
aVBut to get to that stage,
p400
aVwhere democracy builds the fabric of society
p401
aVand the political choices within that fabric,
p402
aVbut are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship \u2014
p403
aVi.e. you're voting in a democracy,
p404
aVin an existing democracy,
p405
aVand that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box.
p406
aVTo get to that stage,
p407
aVwe genuinely need to start building demand
p408
aVin those societies on the ground.
p409
aa(lp410
VNow to conclude, how does that happen?
p411
aVWell, Egypt is a good starting point.
p412
aVThe Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning.
p413
aVBut what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt
p414
aVwas particularly cathartic for me.
p415
aVWhat happened there was a political coalition
p416
aVgathered together for a political goal,
p417
aVand that was to remove the leader.
p418
aVWe need to move one step beyond that now.
p419
aVWe need to see how we can help those societies
p420
aVmove from political coalitions,
p421
aVloosely based political coalitions,
p422
aVto civilizational coalitions
p423
aVthat are working for the ideals and narratives
p424
aVof the democratic culture on the ground.
p425
aVBecause it's not enough to remove a leader
p426
aVor ruler or dictator.
p427
aVThat doesn't guarantee that what comes next
p428
aVwill be a society built on democratic values.
p429
aa(lp430
VBut generally, the trends that start in Egypt
p431
aVhave historically spread across the MENA region,
p432
aVthe Middle East and North Africa region.
p433
aVSo when Arab socialism started in Egypt, it spread across the region.
p434
aVIn the '80s and '90s when Islamism started in the region,
p435
aVit spread across the MENA region as a whole.
p436
aa(lp437
VAnd the aspiration that we have at the moment \u2014
p438
aVas young Arabs are proving today
p439
aVand instantly rebranding themselves
p440
aVas being prepared to die for more than just terrorism \u2014
p441
aVis that there is a chance
p442
aVthat democratic culture can start in the region
p443
aVand spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that.
p444
aVBut that will require
p445
aVhelping these societies transition
p446
aVfrom having merely political coalitions
p447
aVto building genuinely grassroots-based social movements
p448
aVthat advocate for the democratic culture.
p449
aVAnd we've made a start for that in Pakistan
p450
aVwith a movement called Khudi,
p451
aVwhere we are working on the ground to encourage the youth
p452
aVto create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture.
p453
aVAnd it's with that thought that I'll end.
p454
aa(lp455
VAnd my time is up, and thank you for your time.

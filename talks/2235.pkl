VWell, you know, sometimes
p5
aVthe most important things come in the smallest packages.
p6
aVI am going to try to convince you, in the 15 minutes I have,
p7
aVthat microbes have a lot to say about questions such as,
p8
aV"Are we alone?"
p9
aVand they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system
p10
aVbut also maybe beyond,
p11
aVand this is why I am tracking them down in the most impossible places on Earth,
p12
aVin extreme environments where conditions
p13
aVare really pushing them to the brink of survival.
p14
aVActually, sometimes me too, when I'm trying to follow them too close.
p15
aVBut here's the thing:
p16
aVWe are the only advanced civilization in the solar system,
p17
aVbut that doesn't mean that there is no microbial life nearby.
p18
aVIn fact, the planets and moons you see here
p19
aVcould host life \u2014 all of them \u2014 and we know that,
p20
aVand it's a strong possibility.
p21
aVAnd if we were going to find life on those moons and planets,
p22
aVthen we would answer questions such as,
p23
aVare we alone in the solar system?
p24
aVWhere are we coming from?
p25
aVDo we have family in the neighborhood?
p26
aVIs there life beyond our solar system?
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution
p29
aVin our understanding of what a habitable planet is,
p30
aVand today, a habitable planet is a planet
p31
aVthat has a zone where water can stay stable,
p32
aVbut to me this is a horizontal definition of habitability,
p33
aVbecause it involves a distance to a star,
p34
aVbut there is another dimension to habitability,
p35
aVand this is a vertical dimension.
p36
aVThink of it as
p37
aVconditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away from a sun,
p38
aVbut you still have water, energy, nutrients,
p39
aVwhich for some of them means food,
p40
aVand a protection.
p41
aVAnd when you look at the Earth,
p42
aVvery far away from any sunlight, deep in the ocean,
p43
aVyou have life thriving
p44
aVand it uses only chemistry for life processes.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo when you think of it  at that point, all walls collapse.
p47
aVYou have no limitations, basically.
p48
aVAnd if you have been looking at the headlines lately,
p49
aVthen you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean
p50
aVon Europa, on Ganymede, on Enceladus, on Titan,
p51
aVand now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on Enceladus,
p52
aVOur solar system is turning into a giant spa.
p53
aVFor anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that, right?
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VSo at that point, think also about Mars.
p57
aVThere is no life possible at the surface of Mars today,
p58
aVbut it might still be hiding underground.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo, we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability,
p61
aVbut we also have been making progress in our understanding
p62
aVof what the signatures of life are on Earth.
p63
aVAnd you can have what we call organic molecules,
p64
aVand these are the bricks of life,
p65
aVand you can have fossils,
p66
aVand you can minerals, biominerals,
p67
aVwhich is due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks,
p68
aVand of course you can have gases in the atmosphere.
p69
aVAnd when you look at those tiny green algae
p70
aVon the right of the slide here,
p71
aVthey are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen
p72
aVa billion years ago in the atmosphere of the Earth.
p73
aVWhen they did that, they poisoned 90 percent of the life
p74
aVat the surface of the Earth,
p75
aVbut they are the reason why you are breathing this air today.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut as much as our understanding grows of all of these things,
p78
aVthere is one question we still cannot answer,
p79
aVand this is, where are we coming from?
p80
aVAnd you know, it's getting worse,
p81
aVbecause we won't be able to find the physical evidence
p82
aVof where we are coming from on this planet,
p83
aVand the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone.
p84
aVAll record is gone,
p85
aVerased by plate tectonics and erosion.
p86
aVThis is what I call the Earth's biological horizon.
p87
aVBeyond this horizon we don't know where we are coming from.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo is everything lost? Well, maybe not.
p90
aVAnd we might be able to find evidence of our own origin
p91
aVin the most unlikely place, and this place in Mars.
p92
aa(lp93
VHow is this possible?
p94
aVWell clearly at the beginning of the solar system,
p95
aVMars and the Earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets,
p96
aVand there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place.
p97
aVEarth and Mars kept throwing rocks at each other for a very long time.
p98
aVPieces of rocks landed on the Earth.
p99
aVPieces of the Earth landed on Mars.
p100
aVSo clearly, those two planets may have been seeded by the same material.
p101
aVSo yeah, maybe Granddady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us.
p102
aVBut that also means that we can go to Mars and try to find traces of our own origin.
p103
aVMars may hold that secret for us.
p104
aVThis is why Mars is so special to us.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut for that to happen,
p107
aVMars needed to be habitable at the time when conditions were right.
p108
aVSo was Mars habitable?
p109
aVWe have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today.
p110
aVAt the time when life appeared on the Earth,
p111
aVMars did have an ocean, it had volcanoes, it had lakes,
p112
aVand it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here.
p113
aVThis picture was sent by the Curiosity  rover only a few weeks ago.
p114
aVIt shows the remnants of a delta, and this picture tells us something:
p115
aVwater was abundant
p116
aVand stayed founting at the surface for a very long time.
p117
aVThis is good news for life.
p118
aVLife chemistry takes a long time to actually happen.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo this is extremely good news,
p121
aVbut does that mean that if we go there, life will be easy to find on Mars?
p122
aVNot necessarily.
p123
aa(lp124
VHere's what happened:
p125
aVAt the time when life exploded at the surface of the Earth,
p126
aVthen everything went south for Mars,
p127
aVliterally.
p128
aVThe atmosphere was stripped away by solar winds,
p129
aVMars lost its magnetosphere,
p130
aVand then cosmic rays and U.V. bombarded the surface
p131
aVand water escaped to space and went underground.
p132
aVSo if we want to be able to understand,
p133
aVif we want to be able to find those traces of the signatures of life
p134
aVat the surface of Mars, if they are there,
p135
aVwe need to understand what was the impact of each of these events
p136
aVon the preservation of its record.
p137
aVOnly then will we be able to know where those signatures are hiding,
p138
aVand only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places
p139
aVwhere we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something
p140
aVreally important about who we are,
p141
aVor, if not, maybe telling us that somewhere, independently,
p142
aVlife has appeared on another planet.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo to do that, it's easy.
p145
aVYou only need to go back 3.5 billion years ago
p146
aVin the past of a planet.
p147
aVWe just need a time machine.
p148
aa(lp149
VEasy, right?
p150
aVWell, actually, it is.
p151
aVLook around you \u2014 that's planet Earth.
p152
aVThis is our time machine.
p153
aVGeologists are using it to go back in the past of our own planet.
p154
aVI am using it a little bit differently.
p155
aVI use planet Earth to go in very extreme environments
p156
aVwhere conditions were similar to those of Mars
p157
aVat the time when the climate changed,
p158
aVand there I'm trying  to understand what happened.
p159
aVWhat are the signatures of life?
p160
aVWhat is left? How are we going to find it?
p161
aVSo for one moment now I'm going to take you with me
p162
aVon a trip into that time machine.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd now, what you see here, we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,
p165
aVbut in fact we are less than a billion years after the Earth and Mars formed.
p166
aVThe Earth and Mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that \u2014
p167
aVvolcanoes everywhere, evaporating lakes everywhere,
p168
aVminerals, hot springs,
p169
aVand then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes?
p170
aVThose are built by the descendants of the first organisms
p171
aVthat gave us the first fossil on Earth.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut if we want to understand what's  going on, we need to go a little further.
p174
aVAnd the other thing about those sites
p175
aVis that exactly like on Mars three and a half billion years ago,
p176
aVthe climate is changing very fast, and water and ice are disappearing.
p177
aVBut we need to go back to that time when everything changed on Mars,
p178
aVand to do that, we need to go higher.
p179
aVWhy is that?
p180
aVBecause when you go higher,
p181
aVthe atmosphere is getting thinner, it's getting more unstable,
p182
aVthe temperature is getting cooler, and you have a lot more U.V. radiation.
p183
aVBasically,
p184
aVyou are getting to those conditions on Mars when everything changed.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo I was not promising anything about a leisurely trip on the time machine.
p187
aVYou are not going to be sitting in that time machine.
p188
aVYou have to haul 1,000 pounds of equipment to the summit
p189
aVof this 20,000-foot volcano in the Andes here.
p190
aVThat's about 6,000 meters.
p191
aVAnd you also have to sleep on 42-degree slopes
p192
aVand really hope that there won't be any earthquake that night.
p193
aVBut when we get to the summit, we actually find the lake we came for.
p194
aVAt this altitude, this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions
p195
aVas those on Mars three and a half billion years ago.
p196
aVAnd now we have to change our voyage
p197
aVinto an inner voyage inside that lake,
p198
aVand to do that, we have to remove our mountain gear
p199
aVand actually don suits and go for it.
p200
aVBut at the time we enter that lake, at the very moment we enter that lake,
p201
aVwe are stepping back
p202
aVthree and a half billion years in the past of another planet,
p203
aVand then we are going to get the answer came for.
p204
aVLife is everywhere, absolutely everywhere.
p205
aVEverything you see in this picture is a living organism.
p206
aVMaybe not so the diver, but everything else.
p207
aVBut this picture is very deceiving.
p208
aVLife is abundant in those lakes,
p209
aVbut like in many places on Earth  right now and due to climate change,
p210
aVthere is a huge loss in biodiversity.
p211
aVIn the samples that we took back home,
p212
aV36 percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species,
p213
aVand those three species are the ones that have survived so far.
p214
aa(lp215
VHere's another lake, right next to the first one.
p216
aVThe red color you see here is not due to minerals.
p217
aVIt's actually due to the presence of a tiny algae.
p218
aVIn this region, the U.V. radiation is really nasty.
p219
aVAnywhere on Earth, 11 is considered to be extreme.
p220
aVDuring U.V. storms there, the U.V. Index reaches 43.
p221
aVSPF 30 is not going to do anything  to you over there,
p222
aVand the water is so transparent in those lakes
p223
aVthat the algae has nowhere to hide, really,
p224
aVand so they are developing their own sunscreen,
p225
aVand this is the red color you see.
p226
aVBut they can adapt only so far,
p227
aVand then when all the water is gone from the surface,
p228
aVmicrobes have only one solution left:
p229
aVThey go underground.
p230
aVAnd those microbes, the rocks you see in that slide here,
p231
aVwell, they are actually living inside rocks
p232
aVand they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks
p233
aVto get the good part of the U.V.
p234
aVand discard the part that could actually damage their DNA.
p235
aVAnd this is why we are taking our rover
p236
aVto train them to search  for life on Mars in these areas,
p237
aVbecause if there was life on Mars three and a half billion years ago,
p238
aVit had to use the same strategy to actually protect itself.
p239
aVNow, it is pretty obvious
p240
aVthat going to extreme environments is helping us very much
p241
aVfor the exploration of Mars  and to prepare missions.
p242
aVSo far, it has helped us to understand the geology of Mars.
p243
aVIt has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution,
p244
aVbut also its habitability potential.
p245
aVOur most recent rover on Mars has discovered traces of organics.
p246
aVYeah, there are organics at the surface of Mars.
p247
aVAnd it also discovered traces of methane.
p248
aVAnd we don't know yet if the methane in question
p249
aVis really from geology or biology.
p250
aVRegardless, what we know is that because of the discovery,
p251
aVthe hypothesis that there is still life present on Mars today
p252
aVremains a viable one.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo by now, I think I have convinced you that Mars is very special to us,
p255
aVbut it would be a mistake to think that Mars is the only place
p256
aVin the solar system that is interesting to find potential microbial life.
p257
aVAnd the reason is because Mars and the Earth
p258
aVcould have a common root to their tree of life,
p259
aVbut when you go beyond Mars, it's not that easy.
p260
aVCelestial mechanics  is not making it so easy
p261
aVfor an exchange of material between planets,
p262
aVand so if we were to discover life on those planets,
p263
aVit would be different from us.
p264
aVIt would be a different type of life.
p265
aVBut in the end, it might be just us,
p266
aVit might be us and Mars,
p267
aVor it can be many trees of life in the solar system.
p268
aVI don't know the answer yet, but I can tell you something:
p269
aVNo matter what the result is, no matter what that magic number is,
p270
aVit is going to give us a standard
p271
aVby which we are going to be able  to measure the life potential,
p272
aVabundance and diversity beyond our own solar system.
p273
aVAnd this can be achieved by our generation.
p274
aVThis can be our legacy, but only if we dare to explore.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow, finally,
p277
aVif somebody tells you that looking  for alien microbes is not cool
p278
aVbecause you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them,
p279
aVlet me show you why and how you can tell them they're wrong.
p280
aVWell, organic material is going to tell you
p281
aVabout environment, about complexity and about diversity.
p282
aVDNA, or any information carrier, is going to tell you about adaptation,
p283
aVabout evolution, about survival, about planetary changes
p284
aVand about the transfer of information.
p285
aVAll together, they are telling us
p286
aVwhat started as a microbial pathway,
p287
aVand why what started as a microbial pathway
p288
aVsometimes ends up as a civilization
p289
aVor sometimes ends up as a dead end.
p290
aa(lp291
VLook at the solar system, and look at the Earth.
p292
aVOn Earth, there are many intelligent species,
p293
aVbut only one has achieved technology.
p294
aVRight here in the journey of our own solar system,
p295
aVthere is a very, very powerful message
p296
aVthat says here's how we should look  for alien life, small and big.
p297
aVSo yeah, microbes are talking and we are listening,
p298
aVand they are taking us,
p299
aVone planet at a time and one moon at a time,
p300
aVtowards their big brothers out there.
p301
aVAnd they are telling us about diversity,
p302
aVthey are telling us about abundance of life,
p303
aVand they are telling us how this life has survived thus far
p304
aVto reach civilization,
p305
aVintelligence, technology and, indeed, philosophy.
p306
aa(lp307

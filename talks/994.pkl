VI'm a bug lover, myself \u2014
p5
aVnot from childhood, by the way,
p6
aVbut rather late.
p7
aVWhen I bachelored,
p8
aVmajoring in zoology at Tel Aviv University,
p9
aVI kind of fell in love with bugs.
p10
aVAnd then, within zoology,
p11
aVI took the course or the discipline of entomology,
p12
aVthe science of insects.
p13
aVAnd then I thought to myself, how can I be practical
p14
aVor help in the science of entomology?
p15
aVAnd then I moved to the world of plant protection \u2014
p16
aVplant protection from insects,
p17
aVfrom bad bugs.
p18
aVAnd then within plant protection,
p19
aVI came into the discipline of biological pest control,
p20
aVwhich we actually define
p21
aVas the use of living organisms
p22
aVto reduce populations of noxious plant pests.
p23
aVSo it's a whole discipline in plant protection
p24
aVaimed at the reduction of chemicals.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd biological pest control, by the way,
p27
aVor these "good bugs" that we are talking about,
p28
aVthey've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years,
p29
aVfor a long, long time.
p30
aVBut only in the last 120 years,
p31
aVpeople started, or people knew more and more
p32
aVhow to exploit, or how to use, this biological control phenomenon,
p33
aVor in fact, natural control phenomenon,
p34
aVfor their own needs.
p35
aVBecause biological control phenomenon \u2014 you can see it in your backyard.
p36
aVJust take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here?
p37
aVThat's a magnifier, times 10.
p38
aVYou just open it, twist leaves,
p39
aVand you see a whole new world of minute insects,
p40
aVor little spiders of one millimeter, one-and-a-half, two millimeters long,
p41
aVand you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones.
p42
aVSo this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere.
p43
aVHere, in front of this building, I'm sure.
p44
aVJust have a look at the plants.
p45
aVSo it's everywhere, and we need to know how to exploit it.
p46
aa(lp47
VWell, let's go hand by hand
p48
aVand browse through just a few examples.
p49
aVWhat is a pest?
p50
aVWhat damage does it actually inflict on the plant?
p51
aVAnd what is the natural enemy,
p52
aVthe biological control agent, or the "good bug"
p53
aVthat we're talking about?
p54
aVIn general, I'm going to talk about insects and spiders,
p55
aVor mites, let us call them.
p56
aVInsects, those six-legged organisms
p57
aVand spiders or mites, the eight-legged organisms.
p58
aVLet's have a look at that.
p59
aVHere is a devastating pest, a spider mite,
p60
aVbecause it does a lot of webbing, like a spider.
p61
aVYou see the mother in between,
p62
aVand two daughters, probably, on the left and right,
p63
aVand a single egg on the right-hand side.
p64
aVAnd then you see what kind of damage it can inflict.
p65
aa(lp66
VOn your right-hand side, you can see a cucumber leaf,
p67
aVin the middle, a cotton leaf,
p68
aVand on the left, a tomato leaf with these little stipplings.
p69
aVThey can literally turn from green to white,
p70
aVbecause of the sucking, piercing mouth parts of those spiders.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut here comes nature, that provides us with a good spider.
p73
aVThis is a predatory mite \u2014 just as small as a spider mite;
p74
aVone, two millimeters long, not more than that \u2014
p75
aVrunning quickly, hunting, chasing the spider mites.
p76
aVAnd here, you can see this lady in action on your left-hand side \u2014
p77
aVjust pierces, sucks the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite.
p78
aVAnd after five minutes, this is what you see:
p79
aVjust a typical dead corpse \u2014
p80
aVthe shriveled, sucked-out, dead corpse of the spider mite,
p81
aVand next to it, two satiated individuals, predatory mites,
p82
aVa mother on the left-hand side, a young nymph on the right-hand side.
p83
aVBy the way, a meal for them for 24 hours,
p84
aVis about five of the spider mites, of the bad mites,
p85
aVand-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites.
p86
aVBy the way, they are always hungry.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd here is another example: aphids.
p91
aVIt's springtime now in Israel.
p92
aVWhen temperatures rise sharply,
p93
aVyou can see those bad ones, those aphids, all over the plants \u2014
p94
aVin your hibiscus, in your lantana,
p95
aVin the young, fresh foliage of the so-called spring flush.
p96
aVBy the way, with aphids you have only females, like Amazons.
p97
aVFemales giving rise to females, giving rise to other females.
p98
aVNo males at all.
p99
aVParthenogenesis, as it's so called.
p100
aVAnd they're very happy with that, apparently.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VHere we can see the damage.
p105
aVThose aphids secrete a sticky, sugary liquid called honeydew,
p106
aVand this just clogs the upper parts of the plant.
p107
aVHere you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned from green to black
p108
aVbecause of a black fungus, sooty mold, which is covering it.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd here comes the salvation, through this parasitic wasp.
p111
aVHere we are not talking about a predator.
p112
aVHere we are talking a parasite \u2014
p113
aVnot a two-legged parasite,
p114
aVbut an eight-legged parasite, of course.
p115
aVThis is a parasitic wasp,
p116
aVagain, two millimeters long, slender, a very quick and sharp flier.
p117
aVAnd here you can see this parasite in action,
p118
aVlike in an acrobatic maneuver.
p119
aVShe stands vis-à-vis
p120
aVin front of the victim at the right-hand side,
p121
aVbending its abdomen and inserting a single egg
p122
aVinto the body fluids of the aphid.
p123
aVBy the way, the aphid tries to escape.
p124
aVShe kicks and bites and secretes different liquids,
p125
aVbut nothing will happen, in fact \u2014
p126
aVonly the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted
p127
aVinto the body fluids of the aphid.
p128
aVAnd after a few days, depending upon temperature,
p129
aVthe egg will hatch
p130
aVand the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VThis is all natural. This is all natural.
p135
aVThis is not fiction, nothing at all.
p136
aVAgain \u2014 in your backyard. In your backyard.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
V(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
VBut this is the end result: mummies.
p143
aVThis is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside,
p144
aVa developing parasitoid that, after a few minutes, you see halfway out.
p145
aVThe birth is almost complete.
p146
aVYou can see, by the way, in different movies, etc.,
p147
aVit takes just a few minutes.
p148
aVAnd if this is a female, she'll immediately mate with a male
p149
aVand off she goes, because time is very short.
p150
aVThis female can live only three to four days,
p151
aVand she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs.
p152
aVThat means she has 400 bad aphids
p153
aVto put her eggs into their body fluids.
p154
aVThis is, of course, not the end of it.
p155
aa(lp156
VThere is a whole wealth of other natural enemies
p157
aVand this is just the last example.
p158
aVAgain, we'll start first with the pest:
p159
aVthe thrips.
p160
aVBy the way, all these weird names \u2014
p161
aVI didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures,
p162
aVjust the popular names.
p163
aVBut this is a nice, slender, very bad pest.
p164
aVIf you can see this: sweet peppers.
p165
aVThis is not just an exotic, ornamental sweet pepper.
p166
aVThis is a sweet pepper which is not consumable
p167
aVbecause it is suffering from a viral disease
p168
aVtransmitted by those thrip adults.
p169
aVAnd here comes the natural enemy, minute pirate bug \u2014
p170
aV"minute," because it is rather small.
p171
aVHere you can see the adult, black, and two young ones.
p172
aVAnd again, in action.
p173
aVThis adult pierces the thrips,
p174
aVsucking it within just several minutes,
p175
aVgoing to the other prey, continuing all over the place.
p176
aVAnd if we spread those minute pirate bugs, the good ones,
p177
aVfor example, in a sweet pepper plot,
p178
aVthey go to the flowers.
p179
aVAnd look \u2014 this flower is flooded with predatory bugs, with the good ones,
p180
aVafter wiping out the bad ones, the thrips.
p181
aVSo this is a very positive situation.
p182
aVNo harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set.
p183
aVEverything is just fine under these circumstances.
p184
aVBut again, the question is,
p185
aVhere you saw them on a one-to-one basis \u2014 the pest, the natural enemy.
p186
aa(lp187
VWhat we do is actually this.
p188
aVIn Northeast Israel, in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu,
p189
aVthere is a facility that mass-produces those natural enemies.
p190
aVIn other words, what we do there is amplify the natural control,
p191
aVor the biological control phenomenon.
p192
aVAnd in 30,000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses,
p193
aVthere, we are mass-producing those predatory mites,
p194
aVthose minute pirate bugs,
p195
aVthose parasitic wasps, etc.
p196
aVMany different parts.
p197
aVBy the way, they have a very nice landscape \u2014
p198
aVyou see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand,
p199
aVand the Jordan Valley on the other hand,
p200
aVand a good, mild winter and a nice, hot summer,
p201
aVwhich is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures.
p202
aVAnd by the way, mass-production \u2014 it is not genetic manipulation.
p203
aVThere are no GMOs \u2014 genetically modified organisms \u2014 whatsoever.
p204
aVWe take them from nature,
p205
aVand the only thing that we do is give them the optimal conditions,
p206
aVunder the greenhouses or in the climate rooms,
p207
aVin order to proliferate, multiply and reproduce.
p208
aVAnd that's what we get.
p209
aa(lp210
VYou see under a microscope.
p211
aVYou see in the upper left corner? You see a single predatory mite.
p212
aVAnd this is the whole bunch of predatory mites.
p213
aVYou see this ampul. You see this one.
p214
aVI have one gram of those predatory mites.
p215
aVOne gram is 80,000 individuals.
p216
aV80,000 individuals are good enough to control one acre,
p217
aV4,000 square meters,
p218
aVof a strawberry plot
p219
aVagainst spider mites for the whole season
p220
aVof almost one year.
p221
aVAnd we can produce from this, believe you me,
p222
aVseveral dozens of kilograms on an annual basis.
p223
aVSo this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon.
p224
aVAnd no, we do not disrupt the balance.
p225
aVOn the contrary,
p226
aVbecause we bring it to every cultural plot
p227
aVwhere the balance was already disrupted
p228
aVby the chemicals.
p229
aVHere we come with those natural enemies
p230
aVin order to reverse a little bit of the wheel
p231
aVand to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot
p232
aVby reducing those chemicals.
p233
aVThat's the whole idea.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd what is the impact?
p236
aVIn this table, you can actually see what is an impact
p237
aVof a successful biological control by good bugs.
p238
aVFor example, in Israel, where we employ more than 1,000 hectares \u2014
p239
aV10,000 dunams in Israeli terms \u2014
p240
aVof biological pests controlling sweet pepper
p241
aVunder protection,
p242
aV75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced.
p243
aVAnd Israeli strawberries, even more \u2014
p244
aV80 percent of the pesticides,
p245
aVespecially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries.
p246
aVSo the impact is very strong.
p247
aVAnd there goes the question,
p248
aVespecially if you ask growers, agriculturists:
p249
aVWhy biological control?
p250
aVWhy good bugs?
p251
aVBy the way, the number of answers you get
p252
aVequals the number of people you ask.
p253
aVBut if we go, for example, to this place, Southeast Israel,
p254
aVthe Arava area above the Great Rift Valley,
p255
aVwhere the pearl of Israeli agriculture is located,
p256
aVespecially under greenhouse conditions, or under screenhouse conditions \u2014
p257
aVif you drive all the way to Eilat, you see this
p258
aVjust in the middle of the desert.
p259
aVAnd if you zoom in,
p260
aVyou can definitely watch this:
p261
aVgrandparents with their grandchildren,
p262
aVdistributing the natural enemies, the good bugs,
p263
aVinstead of wearing special clothes
p264
aVand gas masks and applying chemicals.
p265
aVSo safety, with respect to the application,
p266
aVis the number one answer that we get from growers,
p267
aVfor "Why biological control?"
p268
aa(lp269
VNumber two, many growers are, in fact, petrified
p270
aVby the idea of resistance,
p271
aVthat the pests will become resistant to the chemicals,
p272
aVjust like in our case, that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics.
p273
aVIt's the same, and it can happen very quickly.
p274
aVFortunately, in either biological control or even natural control,
p275
aVresistance is extremely rare.
p276
aVIt hardly happens.
p277
aVBecause this is evolution, this is the natural ratio,
p278
aVunlike resistance, which happens in the case of chemicals.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd thirdly, public demand.
p281
aVThe more the public demands the reduction of chemicals,
p282
aVthe more growers become aware of the fact
p283
aVthat they should, wherever they can and wherever possible,
p284
aVreplace the chemical control with biological control.
p285
aVEven here, there is another grower,
p286
aVyou see, very interested in the bugs, the bad ones and the good ones,
p287
aVwearing this magnifier already on her head,
p288
aVjust walking safely in her crop.
p289
aa(lp290
VFinally, I want to get to my vision,
p291
aVor, in fact, to my dream.
p292
aVBecause, you see, this is the reality.
p293
aVHave a look at the gap.
p294
aVIf we take the overall turnover
p295
aVof the biocontrol industry worldwide,
p296
aVit's 250 million dollars.
p297
aVAnd look at the overall pesticide industry
p298
aVin all the crops throughout the world.
p299
aVI think it's times 100 or something like that.
p300
aVTwenty-five billion.
p301
aVSo there is a huge gap to bridge.
p302
aVSo actually, how can we do it?
p303
aVHow can we bridge, or let's say, narrow, this gap over the years?
p304
aVFirst of all, we need to find more robust,
p305
aVgood and reliable biological solutions,
p306
aVmore good bugs that we can either mass-produce
p307
aVor actually conserve in the field.
p308
aVSecondly, to create even more intensive and strict public demand
p309
aVfor the reduction of chemicals in agricultural fresh produce.
p310
aVAnd thirdly, also to increase awareness by the growers
p311
aVto the potential of this industry.
p312
aVAnd this gap really narrows.
p313
aVStep by step, it does narrow.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo I think my last slide is:
p316
aVAll we are saying \u2014 we can actually sing it \u2014
p317
aVGive nature a chance.
p318
aVI'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners
p319
aVand implementers,
p320
aVin Israel and abroad,
p321
aVreally give nature a chance.
p322
aa(lp323
VThank you.

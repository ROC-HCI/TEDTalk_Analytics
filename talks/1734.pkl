VSo I grew up in East Los Angeles,
p5
aVnot even realizing I was poor.
p6
aVMy dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.
p7
aVEveryone knew who I was,
p8
aVso I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected,
p9
aVand even though my dad spent most of my life
p10
aVin and out of jail,
p11
aVI had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.
p12
aVShe worked at the local high school
p13
aVas a secretary in the dean's office,
p14
aVso she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class,
p15
aVfor whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.
p16
aVMan, her office was packed.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with
p19
aVoutside of school,
p20
aVand sometimes we're just not ready to focus.
p21
aVBut that doesn't mean that we can't.
p22
aVIt just takes a little bit more.
p23
aVLike, I remember one day I found my dad
p24
aVconvulsing, foaming at the mouth,
p25
aVOD-ing on the bathroom floor.
p26
aVReally, do you think that doing my homework that night
p27
aVwas at the top of my priority list?
p28
aVNot so much.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut I really needed a support network,
p31
aVa group of people who were going to help me
p32
aVmake sure that I wasn't going to be
p33
aVa victim of my own circumstance,
p34
aVthat they were going to push me
p35
aVbeyond what I even thought I could do.
p36
aVI needed teachers, in the classroom, every day,
p37
aVwho were going to say, "You can move beyond that."
p38
aVAnd unfortunately, the local junior high
p39
aVwas not going to offer that.
p40
aVIt was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo my mom said, "You're going on a bus
p43
aVan hour and a half away from where we live every day."
p44
aVSo for the next two years, that's what I did.
p45
aVI took a school bus to the fancy side of town.
p46
aVAnd eventually, I ended up at a school
p47
aVwhere there was a mixture.
p48
aVThere were some people who were really gang-affiliated,
p49
aVand then there were those of us
p50
aVreally trying to make it to high school.
p51
aVWell, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.
p52
aVYou had to survive.
p53
aVYou just had to do things sometimes.
p54
aVSo there were a lot of teachers who were like,
p55
aV"She's never going to make it.
p56
aVShe has an issue with authority.
p57
aVShe's not going to go anywhere."
p58
aVSome teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut then, they were very surprised
p61
aVwhen I graduated from high school.
p62
aVI was accepted to Pepperdine University,
p63
aVand I came back to the same school that I attended
p64
aVto be a special ed assistant.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd then I told them, "I want to be a teacher."
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd boy, they were like, "What? Why?
p69
aVWhy would you want to do that?"
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I began my teaching career
p72
aVat the exact same middle school that I attended,
p73
aVand I really wanted to try to save more kids
p74
aVwho were just like me.
p75
aVAnd so every year, I share my background with my kids,
p76
aVbecause they need to know that everyone has a story,
p77
aVeveryone has a struggle,
p78
aVand everyone needs help along the way.
p79
aVAnd I am going to be their help along the way.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.
p82
aVI had a kid one day come into my class
p83
aVhaving been stabbed the night before.
p84
aa(lp85
VI was like, "You need to go to a hospital,
p86
aVthe school nurse, something."
p87
aa(lp88
VHe's like, "No, Miss, I'm not going.
p89
aVI need to be in class because I need to graduate."
p90
aVSo he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim
p91
aVof his circumstance,
p92
aVbut we were going to push forward and keep moving on.
p93
aVAnd this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids
p94
aVand getting to know exactly what they're going through,
p95
aVgetting to know their families \u2014 I wanted that,
p96
aVbut I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids,
p97
aVand teachers turning over year after year after year.
p98
aVHow do you get to build those relationships?
p99
aa(lp100
VSo we created a new school.
p101
aVAnd we created
p102
aVthe San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.
p103
aVAnd we made sure that we were still attached
p104
aVto our school district for funding, for support.
p105
aVBut with that, we were going to gain freedom:
p106
aVfreedom to hire the teachers
p107
aVthat we knew were going to be effective;
p108
aVfreedom to control the curriculum
p109
aVso that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no;
p110
aVand freedom to control a budget,
p111
aVto spend money where it matters,
p112
aVnot how a district or a state says you have to do it.
p113
aVWe wanted those freedoms.
p114
aVBut now, shifting an entire paradigm,
p115
aVit hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.
p116
aVBut we had to do it.
p117
aVOur community deserved a new way of doing things.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd as the very first pilot middle school
p120
aVin all of Los Angeles Unified School District,
p121
aVyou better believe there was some opposition.
p122
aVAnd it was out of fear \u2014
p123
aVfear of, well, what if they get it wrong?
p124
aVYeah, what if we get it wrong?
p125
aVBut what if we get it right?
p126
aVAnd we did.
p127
aVSo even though teachers were against it
p128
aVbecause we employ one-year contracts \u2014
p129
aVyou can't teach, or you don't want to teach,
p130
aVyou don't get to be at my school with my kids.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VSo in our third year, how did we do it?
p135
aVWell, we're making school worth coming to every day.
p136
aVWe make our kids feel like they matter to us.
p137
aVWe make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them,
p138
aVand they use all the technology that they're used to.
p139
aVLaptops, computers, tablets \u2014 you name it, they have it.
p140
aVAnimation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.
p141
aVAnd because we connect it to what they're doing \u2014
p142
aVFor example, they made public service announcements
p143
aVfor the Cancer Society.
p144
aVThese were played in the local trolley system.
p145
aVTeaching elements of persuasion,
p146
aVit doesn't get any more real than that.
p147
aVOur state test scores have gone up
p148
aVmore than 80 points since we've become our own school.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut it's taken all stakeholders, working together \u2014
p151
aVteachers and principals on one-year contracts,
p152
aVworking over and above and beyond their contract hours
p153
aVwithout compensation.
p154
aVAnd it takes a school board member
p155
aVwho is going to lobby for you and say,
p156
aV"Know, the district is trying to impose this,
p157
aVbut you have the freedom to do otherwise."
p158
aVAnd it takes an active parent center
p159
aVwho is not only there, showing a presence every day,
p160
aVbut who is part of our governance,
p161
aVmaking decisions for their kids, our kids.
p162
aa(lp163
VBecause why should our students have to go
p164
aVso far away from where they live?
p165
aVThey deserve a quality school in their neighborhood,
p166
aVa school that they can be proud to say they attend,
p167
aVand a school that the community can be proud of as well,
p168
aVand they need teachers to fight for them every day
p169
aVand empower them to move beyond their circumstances.
p170
aVBecause it's time that kids like me
p171
aVstop being the exception, and we become the norm.
p172
aa(lp173
VThank you.

She was raised by a single-mother, a long time Los Angeles Unified School District office secretary, who saw firsthand the challenges facing students in public schools. To ensure that she got the best education in the district, Arredondo was bussed to schools almost an hour away from home.</p>  <p>Arredondo graduated and moved on to Pepperdine University, where she received both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in Education and Instructional Leadership. She was the first in her family to graduate from college and began her teaching career at San Fernando Middle School (SFMS) -- the very middle school she attended eight years prior.</p>  <p>At SFMS, she embraced the mission of enhancing educational opportunities for historically underserved students. To do so, she launched the school&rsquo;s Multimedia Academy, which serviced 350 low-income students. After three successful years, the Multimedia Academy faculty decided it was time to make a full split and become a separate school. In 2010, she helped lead an ambitious reform agenda, through a pilot reform model, that focused on technology development, improving outcomes for children and strengthening families. The team founded San Fernando Institute for Applied Media (SFiAM), the first pilot school established in the Los Angeles Unified School District at the middle school level.</p>  <p>Arredondo is passionate about increasing student access to technology and closing the digital divide, and is a tireless advocate for technology-based curriculum that prepare students to enter a global economy.

impoverished East Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights. She was raised by a single-mother, a long time Los Angeles Unified School District office secretary, who saw firsthand the challenges facing students in public schools. To ensure that she got the best education in the district, Arredondo was bussed to schools almost an hour away from home.</p>  <p>Arredondo graduated and moved on to Pepperdine University, where she received both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in Education and Instructional Leadership. She was the first in her family to graduate from college and began her teaching career at San Fernando Middle School (SFMS) -- the very middle school she attended eight years prior.</p>  <p>At SFMS, she embraced the mission of enhancing educational opportunities for historically underserved students. To do so, she launched the school&rsquo;s Multimedia Academy, which serviced 350 low-income students. After three successful years, the Multimedia Academy faculty decided it was time to make a full split and become a separate school. In 2010, she helped lead an ambitious reform agenda, through a pilot reform model, that focused on technology development, improving outcomes for children and strengthening families. The team founded San Fernando Institute for Applied Media (SFiAM), the first pilot school established in the Los Angeles Unified School District at the middle school level.</p>  <p>Arredondo is passionate about increasing student access to technology and closing the digital divide, and is a tireless advocate for technology-based curriculum that prepare students to enter a global economy. Her goal is to make SFiAM a model of educational reform.</p><p>Currently, Arredondo is pursuing a Master of Science in Educational Administration and is a 2013 National Board Certified Teacher candidate. She is also part of the 2013 Teach Plus Teaching Policy Fellowship and serves as the Vice President of SFiAM&rsquo;s Governing Council. She is featured in the short documentary film&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.teached.org/the-blame-game/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">TEACHED Vol.1: &ldquo;The Blame Game,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;and is a role model for young Latinas seeking to make a difference in their communities.</p>  ", "slug": "pearl_arredondo", "whotheyare": "Pearl Arredondo helped establish a pilot middle school that teaches students to be good communicators in the 21st century.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 1645, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/dc0fc5be6765c79e8ac9f689f860fd41d8311b60_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "My story, from gangland daughter to star teacher", "take_action": null, "comments": 19806, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/1596a2060e618406993e26d50dbba81305b79684_1600x1200.jpg", "description": "Pearl Arredondo grew up in East Los Angeles, the daughter of a high-ranking gang member who was in and out of jail.

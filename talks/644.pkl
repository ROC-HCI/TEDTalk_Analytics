VClearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.
p5
aVArguably the financial markets have failed us
p6
aVand the aid system is failing us,
p7
aVand yet I stand firmly with the optimists
p8
aVwho believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
p9
aVBecause of some of technologies we've been talking about.
p10
aVBecause of the resources, the skills,
p11
aVand certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,
p12
aVwith the mindset to create change.
p13
aVAnd we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,
p14
aVwho recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,
p15
aVbut that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd by definition, every one of you who is in this room
p18
aVmust consider yourself a global soul,
p19
aVa global citizen.
p20
aVYou work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst
p21
aVthat human beings can do for one another and to one another.
p22
aVAnd no matter what country you live or work in,
p23
aVyou've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,
p24
aVeven in their most ordinariness.
p25
aa(lp26
VToday there is a raging debate
p27
aVas to how best we lift people out of poverty,
p28
aVhow best we release their energies.
p29
aVOn the one hand, we have people that say
p30
aVthe aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
p31
aVAnd on the other we have people who say
p32
aVthe problem is that we need more aid.
p33
aVAnd what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
p34
aVWe call it patient capital.
p35
aa(lp36
VThe critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent
p37
aVin Africa since 1970
p38
aVand say, and what do we have but environmental degradation
p39
aVand incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
p40
aVThey use Mobutu as metaphor.
p41
aVAnd their policy prescription is to
p42
aVmake government more accountable,
p43
aVfocus on the capital markets,
p44
aVinvest, don't give anything away.
p45
aa(lp46
VOn the other side, as I said, there are those who say
p47
aVthe problem is that we need more money.
p48
aVThat when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out
p49
aVand we'll hand a lot of aid,
p50
aVbut when it comes to our poor brethren,
p51
aVwe want little to do with it.
p52
aVThey point to the successes of aid:
p53
aVthe eradication of smallpox,
p54
aVand the distribution of tens of millions
p55
aVof malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
p56
aVBoth sides are right.
p57
aVAnd the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
p58
aVEven more problematic, they're not listening to
p59
aVpoor people themselves.
p60
aa(lp61
VAfter 25 years of working on issues of
p62
aVpoverty and innovation,
p63
aVit's true that there are probably no more market-oriented
p64
aVindividuals on the planet
p65
aVthan low-income people.
p66
aVThey must navigate markets daily,
p67
aVmaking micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,
p68
aVto move their way through society,
p69
aVand yet if a single catastrophic health problem
p70
aVimpacts their family,
p71
aVthey could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
p72
aVAnd so we need both the market
p73
aVand we need aid.
p74
aa(lp75
VPatient capital works between,
p76
aVand tries to take the best of both.
p77
aVIt's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities
p78
aVand are building solutions
p79
aVto healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,
p80
aVthinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,
p81
aVbut as individual customers, consumers, clients,
p82
aVpeople who want to make decisions in their own lives.
p83
aa(lp84
VPatient capital requires that we have
p85
aVincredible tolerance for risk,
p86
aVa long time horizon in terms of allowing those
p87
aVentrepreneurs time to experiment,
p88
aVto use the market as the best listening device that we have,
p89
aVand the expectation of below-market returns,
p90
aVbut outsized social impact.
p91
aVIt recognizes that the market has its limitation,
p92
aVand so patient capital also works
p93
aVwith smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy
p94
aVto include all people.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, entrepreneurs need patient capital
p97
aVfor three reasons.
p98
aVFirst, they tend to work in markets
p99
aVwhere people make one, two, three dollars a day
p100
aVand they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
p101
aVSecond, the geographies in which they work
p102
aVhave terrible infrastructure \u2014
p103
aVno roads to speak of, sporadic electricity
p104
aVand high levels of corruption.
p105
aVThird, they are often creating markets.
p106
aa(lp107
VEven if you're bringing clean water
p108
aVfor the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
p109
aVAnd so many low-income people
p110
aVhave seen so many failed promises broken
p111
aVand seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them
p112
aVthat building trust takes a lot of time,
p113
aVtakes a lot of patience.
p114
aVIt also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
p115
aVNot only to build the systems,
p116
aVthe business models that allow us
p117
aVto reach low income people in a sustainable way,
p118
aVbut to connect those business
p119
aVto other markets, to governments, to corporations \u2014
p120
aVreal partnerships if we want to get to scale.
p121
aa(lp122
VI want to share one story
p123
aVabout an innovation called drip irrigation.
p124
aVIn 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur
p125
aVnamed Amitabha Sadangi from India,
p126
aVwho'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
p127
aVAnd he was expressing his frustration
p128
aVthat the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,
p129
aVdespite the fact that 200 million farmers
p130
aValone in India make under a dollar a day.
p131
aVThey were creating subsidies
p132
aVeither for large farms,
p133
aVor they were giving inputs to the farmers
p134
aVthat they thought they should use, rather than
p135
aVthat the farmers wanted to use.
p136
aa(lp137
VAt the same time Amitabha was
p138
aVobsessed with this drip irrigation technology
p139
aVthat had been invented in Israel.
p140
aVIt was a way of bringing small amounts of water
p141
aVdirectly to the stalk of the plant.
p142
aVAnd it could transform
p143
aVswaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
p144
aVBut the market also had bypassed low income farmers,
p145
aVbecause these systems were both too expensive,
p146
aVand they were constructed for fields that were too large.
p147
aVThe average small village farmer
p148
aVworks on two acres or less.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation
p151
aVand he would redesign it from the perspective
p152
aVof the poor farmers themselves,
p153
aVbecause he spent so many years listening to what they needed
p154
aVnot what he thought that they should have.
p155
aVAnd he used three fundamental principles.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe first one was miniaturization.
p158
aVThe drip irrigation system
p159
aVhad to be small enough that a farmer only had
p160
aVto risk a quarter acre,
p161
aVeven if he had two,
p162
aVbecause it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
p163
aVSecond, it had to be extremely affordable.
p164
aVIn other words, that risk on the quarter acre
p165
aVneeded to be repaid in a single harvest,
p166
aVor else they wouldn't take the risk.
p167
aVAnd third, it had to be what Amitabha calls
p168
aVinfinitely expandable.
p169
aVWhat I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,
p170
aVthe farmers could buy a second
p171
aVand a third and a fourth.
p172
aa(lp173
VAs of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,
p174
aVhas sold over 300,000 farmers these systems
p175
aVand has seen their yields and incomes
p176
aVdouble or triple on average,
p177
aVbut this didn't happen overnight.
p178
aVIn fact, when you go back to the beginning,
p179
aVthere were no private investors
p180
aVwho would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology
p181
aVfor a market class that made under a dollar a day,
p182
aVthat were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet
p183
aVand that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd so we needed grants. And he used significant grants
p186
aVto research, to experiment, to fail,
p187
aVto innovate and try again.
p188
aVAnd when he had a prototype
p189
aVand had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,
p190
aVthat's when patient capital could come in.
p191
aVAnd we helped him build a company, for profit,
p192
aVthat would build on IDE's knowledge,
p193
aVand start looking at sales and exports,
p194
aVand be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
p195
aa(lp196
VSecondarily, we wanted to see if we could export
p197
aVthis drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
p198
aVAnd so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
p199
aVAnd while, again, you needed patience
p200
aVto move a technology for the poor
p201
aVin India into Pakistan,
p202
aVjust to get the permits,
p203
aVover time we were able to start a company
p204
aVwith Dr. Sono, who runs a large
p205
aVcommunity development organization in the Thar Desert,
p206
aVwhich is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
p207
aVAnd though that company has just started,
p208
aVour assumption is that there too
p209
aVwe'll see the impact on millions.
p210
aa(lp211
VBut drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.
p212
aVWe're starting to see these happening all around the world.
p213
aVIn Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing
p214
aVhas worked in partnership with us,
p215
aVwith UNICEF, with the Global Fund,
p216
aVto create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.
p217
aVAnd they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets
p218
aVfor Africans around the world.
p219
aa(lp220
VLifespring Hospital
p221
aVis a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India
p222
aVto bring quality, affordable maternal health care
p223
aVto low-income women,
p224
aVand it's been so successful that it's currently building
p225
aVa new hospital every 35 days.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to
p228
aVreinvent a completely broken industry,
p229
aVbuilding an ambulance service in Bombay
p230
aVthat would use the technology of Google Earth,
p231
aVa sliding scale pricing system
p232
aVso that all people could have access,
p233
aVand a severe and public decision
p234
aVnot to engage in any form of corruption.
p235
aVSo that in the terrorist attacks of November
p236
aVthey were the first responder,
p237
aVand are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.
p238
aVThey've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,
p239
aVand are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies
p240
aVin India.
p241
aa(lp242
VThis idea of scale is critical.
p243
aVBecause we're starting to see these enterprises
p244
aVreach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed
p245
aVhave reached at least a quarter million people.
p246
aVBut that's obviously not enough.
p247
aVAnd it's where the idea of partnership
p248
aVbecomes so important.
p249
aVWhether it's by finding those innovations
p250
aVthat can access the capital markets,
p251
aVgovernment itself, or partner with major corporations,
p252
aVthere is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.
p253
aa(lp254
VPresident Obama understands that.
p255
aVHe recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund
p256
aVto focus on what works in this country,
p257
aVand look at how we can scale it.
p258
aVAnd I would submit that it's time to consider
p259
aVa global innovation fund
p260
aVthat would find these entrepreneurs around the world
p261
aVwho really have innovations, not only for their country,
p262
aVbut ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
p263
aVInvest financial assistance, but also management assistance.
p264
aVAnd then measure the returns,
p265
aVboth from a financial perspective
p266
aVand from a social impact perspective.
p267
aa(lp268
VWhen we think about new approaches to aid,
p269
aVit's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.
p270
aVWe've had a rocky relationship with that country
p271
aVand, in all fairness,
p272
aVthe United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
p273
aVBut again I would say that this is our moment
p274
aVfor extraordinary things to happen.
p275
aVAnd if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,
p276
aVwe could use this time to invest
p277
aVnot directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,
p278
aVnor in international experts,
p279
aVbut in the many existing entrepreneurs
p280
aVand civil society leaders
p281
aVwho already are building wonderful innovations
p282
aVthat are reaching people all across the country.
p283
aa(lp284
VPeople like Rashani Zafar,
p285
aVwho created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,
p286
aVand is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
p287
aVAnd Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way
p288
aVcalled incremental housing,
p289
aVwhere he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers
p290
aVinto safe, affordable community housing.
p291
aVEducational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation
p292
aVthat are building schools across the country.
p293
aVIt's not hyperbole
p294
aVto say that these civil society institutions
p295
aVand these social entrepreneurs
p296
aVare building real alternatives to the Taliban.
p297
aa(lp298
VI've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,
p299
aVand those of you who've also worked there
p300
aVcan attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,
p301
aVand there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
p302
aa(lp303
VPresident Kennedy said that
p304
aVthose who make peaceful revolution impossible
p305
aVmake violent revolution inevitable.
p306
aVI would say that the converse is true.
p307
aVThat these social leaders
p308
aVwho really are looking at innovation
p309
aVand extending opportunity
p310
aVto the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,
p311
aVprovide real pathways to hope.
p312
aVAnd as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,
p313
aVwhile we need to strengthen the judiciary,
p314
aVbuild greater stability,
p315
aVwe also need to think about lifting those leaders
p316
aVwho can be role models for the rest of the world.
p317
aa(lp318
VOn one of my last visits to Pakistan,
p319
aVI asked Dr. Sono if he would take me
p320
aVto see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
p321
aVAnd we left Karachi one morning before dawn.
p322
aVIt was about 115 degrees.
p323
aVAnd we drove for eight hours
p324
aValong this moonscape-like landscape
p325
aVwith very little color, lots of heat,
p326
aVvery little discussion, because we were exhausted.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd finally, at the end of the journey,
p329
aVI could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
p330
aVAnd as we got closer, its significance became apparent.
p331
aVThat there in the desert
p332
aVwas a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
p333
aVBecause one of the poorest farmers on Earth
p334
aVhad gotten access to a technology
p335
aVthat had allowed him to change his own life.
p336
aVHis name was Raja,
p337
aVand he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes
p338
aVand warm expressive hands
p339
aVthat reminded me of my father.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd he said it was the first dry season
p342
aVin his entire life that he hadn't taken
p343
aVhis 12 children and 50 grandchildren
p344
aVon a two day journey across the desert
p345
aVto work as day laborers at a commercial farm
p346
aVfor about 50 cents a day.
p347
aVBecause he was building these crops.
p348
aVAnd with the money he earned he could stay this year.
p349
aVAnd for the first time ever in three generations,
p350
aVhis children would go to school.
p351
aa(lp352
VWe asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
p353
aVAnd he said, "Of course I will.
p354
aVBecause I don't want them discriminated against anymore."
p355
aVWhen we think about solutions to poverty,
p356
aVwe cannot deny individuals
p357
aVtheir fundamental dignity.
p358
aVBecause at the end of the day,
p359
aVdignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
p360
aVAnd what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors
p361
aVwho are building innovations that recognize
p362
aVthat what people want is freedom
p363
aVand choice and opportunity.
p364
aVBecause that is where dignity really starts.
p365
aa(lp366
VMartin Luther King said that
p367
aVlove without power is anemic and sentimental,
p368
aVand that power without love
p369
aVis reckless and abusive.
p370
aVOur generation has seen both approaches tried,
p371
aVand often fail.
p372
aVBut I think our generation also might be the first
p373
aVto have the courage to embrace both love and power.
p374
aVFor that is what we'll need, as we move forward
p375
aVto dream and imagine what it will really take
p376
aVto build a global economy that includes all of us,
p377
aVand to finally extend that fundamental proposition
p378
aVthat all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
p379
aa(lp380
VThe time for us to begin innovating
p381
aVand looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
p382
aVI can only talk from my own experience,
p383
aVbut in eight years of running Acumen fund,
p384
aVI've seen the power of patient capital.
p385
aVNot only to inspire innovation and risk taking,
p386
aVbut to truly build systems that have created
p387
aVmore than 25,000 jobs
p388
aVand delivered tens of millions of services and products
p389
aVto some of the poorest people on the planet.
p390
aVI know it works.
p391
aVBut I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,
p394
aVin whatever job you do,
p395
aVto start thinking about how we might
p396
aVbuild solutions that start
p397
aVfrom the perspective of those we're trying to help.
p398
aVRather than what we think that they might need.
p399
aVIt will take embracing the world with both arms.
p400
aVAnd it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,
p401
aVwith a sense of integrity and perseverance.
p402
aVAnd yet these are the very qualities
p403
aVfor which men and women have been honored
p404
aVthroughout the generations.
p405
aVAnd there is so much good that we can do.
p406
aVJust think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
p407
aVThank you.

So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>", "slug": "jacqueline_novogratz", "whotheyare": "Jacqueline Novogratz works to enable human flourishing.

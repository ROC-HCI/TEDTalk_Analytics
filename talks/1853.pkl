VSo last year, on the Fourth of July,
p5
aVexperiments at the Large Hadron Collider
p6
aVdiscovered the Higgs boson.
p7
aVIt was a historical day.
p8
aVThere's no doubt that from now on,
p9
aVthe Fourth of July will be remembered
p10
aVnot as the day of the Declaration of Independence,
p11
aVbut as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.
p12
aVWell, at least, here at CERN.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut for me, the biggest surprise of that day
p15
aVwas that there was no big surprise.
p16
aVIn the eye of a theoretical physicist,
p17
aVthe Higgs boson is a clever explanation
p18
aVof how some elementary particles gain mass,
p19
aVbut it seems a fairly unsatisfactory
p20
aVand incomplete solution.
p21
aVToo many questions are left unanswered.
p22
aVThe Higgs boson does not share the beauty,
p23
aVthe symmetry, the elegance,
p24
aVof the rest of the elementary particle world.
p25
aVFor this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists
p26
aVbelieve that the Higgs boson could not
p27
aVbe the full story.
p28
aVWe were expecting new particles and new phenomena
p29
aVaccompanying the Higgs boson.
p30
aVInstead, so far, the measurements
p31
aVcoming from the LHC show no signs of new particles
p32
aVor unexpected phenomena.
p33
aa(lp34
VOf course, the verdict is not definitive.
p35
aVIn 2015, the LHC will almost double
p36
aVthe energy of the colliding protons,
p37
aVand these more powerful collisions
p38
aVwill allow us to explore further the particle world,
p39
aVand we will certainly learn much more.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut for the moment, since we have found
p42
aVno evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose
p43
aVthat the particles that we know today,
p44
aVincluding the Higgs boson,
p45
aVare the only elementary particles in nature,
p46
aVeven at energies much larger
p47
aVthan what we have explored so far.
p48
aVLet's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.
p49
aVWe will find a surprising and intriguing result
p50
aVabout our universe, and to explain my point,
p51
aVlet me first tell you what the Higgs is about,
p52
aVand to do so, we have to go back
p53
aVto one tenth of a billionth of a second
p54
aVafter the Big Bang.
p55
aVAnd according to the Higgs theory,
p56
aVat that instant, a dramatic event took place
p57
aVin the universe.
p58
aVSpace-time underwent a phase transition.
p59
aVIt was something very similar to the phase transition
p60
aVthat occurs when water turns into ice
p61
aVbelow zero degrees.
p62
aVBut in our case, the phase transition
p63
aVis not a change in the way the molecules
p64
aVare arranged inside the material,
p65
aVbut is about a change
p66
aVof the very fabric of space-time.
p67
aa(lp68
VDuring this phase transition, empty space
p69
aVbecame filled with a substance
p70
aVthat we now call Higgs field.
p71
aVAnd this substance may seem invisible to us,
p72
aVbut it has a physical reality.
p73
aVIt surrounds us all the time,
p74
aVjust like the air we breathe in this room.
p75
aVAnd some elementary particles interact
p76
aVwith this substance, gaining energy in the process.
p77
aVAnd this intrinsic energy is what we call
p78
aVthe mass of a particle,
p79
aVand by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC
p80
aVhas conclusively proved that this substance is real,
p81
aVbecause it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.
p82
aVAnd this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut this story is far more interesting than that.
p85
aVBy studying the Higgs theory,
p86
aVtheoretical physicists discovered,
p87
aVnot through an experiment
p88
aVbut with the power of mathematics,
p89
aVthat the Higgs field does not necessarily exist
p90
aVonly in the form that we observe today.
p91
aVJust like matter can exist as liquid or solid,
p92
aVso the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,
p93
aVcould exist in two states.
p94
aVBesides the known Higgs state,
p95
aVthere could be a second state in which the Higgs field
p96
aVis billions and billions times denser
p97
aVthan what we observe today,
p98
aVand the mere existence of another state
p99
aVof the Higgs field poses a potential problem.
p100
aVThis is because, according to the laws
p101
aVof quantum mechanics, it is possible
p102
aVto have transitions between two states,
p103
aVeven in the presence of an energy barrier
p104
aVseparating the two states,
p105
aVand the phenomenon is called,
p106
aVquite appropriately, quantum tunneling.
p107
aVBecause of quantum tunneling,
p108
aVI could disappear from this room
p109
aVand reappear in the next room,
p110
aVpractically penetrating the wall.
p111
aVBut don't expect me to actually perform the trick
p112
aVin front of your eyes, because the probability
p113
aVfor me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.
p114
aVYou would have to wait a really long time
p115
aVbefore it happens, but believe me,
p116
aVquantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,
p117
aVand it has been observed in many systems.
p118
aVFor instance, the tunnel diode,
p119
aVa component used in electronics,
p120
aVworks thanks to the wonders
p121
aVof quantum tunneling.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut let's go back to the Higgs field.
p124
aVIf the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,
p125
aVthen, because of quantum tunneling,
p126
aVa bubble of this state could suddenly appear
p127
aVin a certain place of the universe at a certain time,
p128
aVand it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.
p129
aVBubbles of vapor form inside the water,
p130
aVthen they expand, turning liquid into gas.
p131
aVIn the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state
p132
aVcould come into existence because of quantum tunneling.
p133
aVThe bubble would then expand at the speed of light,
p134
aVinvading all space, and turning the Higgs field
p135
aVfrom the familiar state into a new state.
p136
aa(lp137
VIs this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.
p138
aVWe may not realize it in ordinary life,
p139
aVbut the intensity of the Higgs field is critical
p140
aVfor the structure of matter.
p141
aVIf the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,
p142
aVwe would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying
p143
aVinside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,
p144
aVand hydrogen would be
p145
aVthe only possible chemical element in the universe.
p146
aVAnd the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,
p147
aVis not just a few times more intense than today,
p148
aVbut billions of times,
p149
aVand if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,
p150
aVall atomic matter would collapse.
p151
aVNo molecular structures would be possible, no life.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo, I wonder, is it possible
p154
aVthat in the future, the Higgs field
p155
aVwill undergo a phase transition and,
p156
aVthrough quantum tunneling, will be transformed
p157
aVinto this nasty, ultra-dense state?
p158
aVIn other words, I ask myself, what is the fate
p159
aVof the Higgs field in our universe?
p160
aVAnd the crucial ingredient necessary
p161
aVto answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.
p162
aVAnd experiments at the LHC found that the mass
p163
aVof the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.
p164
aVThis is tiny when expressed in familiar units,
p165
aVbecause it's equal to something like
p166
aV10 to the minus 22 grams,
p167
aVbut it is large in particle physics units,
p168
aVbecause it is equal to the weight
p169
aVof an entire molecule
p170
aVof a DNA constituent.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo armed with this information from the LHC,
p173
aVtogether with some colleagues here at CERN,
p174
aVwe computed the probability
p175
aVthat our universe could quantum tunnel
p176
aVinto the ultra-dense Higgs state,
p177
aVand we found a very intriguing result.
p178
aVOur calculations showed
p179
aVthat the measured value of the Higgs boson mass
p180
aVis very special.
p181
aVIt has just the right value
p182
aVto keep the universe hanging
p183
aVin an unstable situation.
p184
aVThe Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration
p185
aVthat has lasted so far
p186
aVbut that will eventually collapse.
p187
aVSo according to these calculations,
p188
aVwe are like campers
p189
aVwho accidentally set their tent
p190
aVat the edge of a cliff.
p191
aVAnd eventually, the Higgs field
p192
aVwill undergo a phase transition
p193
aVand matter will collapse into itself.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo is this how humanity is going to disappear?
p196
aVI don't think so.
p197
aVOur calculation shows that quantum tunneling
p198
aVof the Higgs field is not likely to occur
p199
aVin the next 10 to the 100 years,
p200
aVand this is a very long time.
p201
aVIt's even longer than
p202
aVthe time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VEven so, we will be long gone by then.
p207
aVIn about five billion years,
p208
aVour sun will become a red giant,
p209
aVas large as the Earth's orbit,
p210
aVand our Earth will be kaput,
p211
aVand in a thousand billion years,
p212
aVif dark energy keeps on fueling
p213
aVspace expansion at the present rate,
p214
aVyou will not even be able to see as far as your toes,
p215
aVbecause everything around you
p216
aVexpands at a rate faster than the speed of light.
p217
aVSo it is really unlikely
p218
aVthat we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.
p219
aa(lp220
VBut the reason why I am interested
p221
aVin the transition of the Higgs field
p222
aVis because I want to address the question,
p223
aVwhy is the Higgs boson mass so special?
p224
aVWhy is it just right to keep the universe
p225
aVat the edge of a phase transition?
p226
aVTheoretical physicists always ask "why" questions.
p227
aVMore than how a phenomenon works,
p228
aVtheoretical physicists are always interested in
p229
aVwhy a phenomenon works in the way it works.
p230
aVWe think that this these "why" questions
p231
aVcan give us clues
p232
aVabout the fundamental principles of nature.
p233
aVAnd indeed, a possible answer to my question
p234
aVopens up new universes, literally.
p235
aVIt has been speculated that our universe
p236
aVis only a bubble in a soapy multiverse
p237
aVmade out of a multitude of bubbles,
p238
aVand each bubble is a different universe
p239
aVwith different fundamental constants
p240
aVand different physical laws.
p241
aVAnd in this context, you can only talk about
p242
aVthe probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.
p243
aVThen the key to the mystery
p244
aVcould lie in the statistical properties
p245
aVof the multiverse.
p246
aVIt would be something like what happens
p247
aVwith sand dunes on a beach.
p248
aVIn principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes
p249
aVof any slope angle in a beach,
p250
aVand yet, the slope angles of sand dunes
p251
aVare typically around 30, 35 degrees.
p252
aVAnd the reason is simple:
p253
aVbecause wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.
p254
aVAs a result, the vast majority of sand dunes
p255
aVhave slope angles around the critical value,
p256
aVnear to collapse.
p257
aVAnd something similar could happen
p258
aVfor the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.
p259
aVIn the majority of bubble universes,
p260
aVthe Higgs mass could be around the critical value,
p261
aVnear to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,
p262
aVbecause of two competing effects,
p263
aVjust as in the case of sand.
p264
aa(lp265
VMy story does not have an end,
p266
aVbecause we still don't know the end of the story.
p267
aVThis is science in progress,
p268
aVand to solve the mystery, we need more data,
p269
aVand hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues
p270
aVto this story.
p271
aVJust one number, the Higgs boson mass,
p272
aVand yet, out of this number we learn so much.
p273
aVI started from a hypothesis, that the known particles
p274
aVare all there is in the universe,
p275
aVeven beyond the domain explored so far.
p276
aVFrom this, we discovered that the Higgs field
p277
aVthat permeates space-time may be standing
p278
aVon a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,
p279
aVand we discovered that this may be a hint
p280
aVthat our universe is only a grain of sand
p281
aVin a giant beach, the multiverse.
p282
aa(lp283
VBut I don't know if my hypothesis is right.
p284
aVThat's how physics works: A single measurement
p285
aVcan put us on the road to a new understanding
p286
aVof the universe
p287
aVor it can send us down a blind alley.
p288
aVBut whichever it turns out to be,
p289
aVthere is one thing I'm sure of:
p290
aVThe journey will be full of surprises.
p291
aa(lp292
VThank you.

VThe FBI is responsible for more terrorism plots
p5
aVin the United States
p6
aVthan any other organization.
p7
aVMore than al Qaeda,
p8
aVmore than al Shabaab,
p9
aVmore than the Islamic State,
p10
aVmore than all of them combined.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis isn't likely how you think about the FBI.
p13
aVYou probably think of FBI agents gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger,
p14
aVor arresting corrupt politicians.
p15
aa(lp16
VAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks,
p17
aVthe FBI became less concerned
p18
aVwith gangsters and  crooked elected officials.
p19
aVThe new target became terrorists,
p20
aVand the pursuit of terrorists  has consumed the FBI.
p21
aa(lp22
VEvery year, the Bureau spends 3.3 billion dollars
p23
aVon domestic counterterrorism activities.
p24
aVCompare than to just 2.6 billion dollars combined for organized crime,
p25
aVfinancial fraud, public corruption
p26
aVand all other types of traditional criminal activity.
p27
aa(lp28
VI've spent years pouring through the case files
p29
aVof terrorism prosecutions in  the United States,
p30
aVand I've come to  the conclusion that the FBI
p31
aVis much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists.
p32
aa(lp33
VIn the 14 years since 9/11,
p34
aVyou can count about six real  terrorist attacks in the United States.
p35
aVThese include the Boston Marathon  bombings in 2013,
p36
aVas well as failed attacks,
p37
aVsuch as the time when  a man named Faisal Shahzad
p38
aVtried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square.
p39
aVIn those same 14 years,
p40
aVthe Bureau, however, has bragged
p41
aVabout how it's foiled dozens of terrorism plots.
p42
aVIn all, the FBI has arrested more than 175 people
p43
aVin aggressive, undercover  conterterrorism stings.
p44
aa(lp45
VThese operations, which are usually led by an informant,
p46
aVprovide the means and opportunity,
p47
aVand sometimes even the idea,
p48
aVfor mentally ill and  economically desperate people
p49
aVto become what we now term terrorists.
p50
aa(lp51
VAfter 9/11, the FBI was given an edict:
p52
aVnever again.
p53
aVNever another attack on American soil.
p54
aVFBI agents were told to find terrorists before they struck.
p55
aVTo do this, agents recruited a network of more than 15,000 informants nationwide,
p56
aVall looking for anyone who  might be dangerous.
p57
aVAn informant can earn  100,000 dollars or more
p58
aVfor every terrorism case  they bring to the FBI.
p59
aVThat's right, the FBI is paying mostly criminals and con men
p60
aVsix figures to spy on communities in the United States,
p61
aVbut mostly Muslim American communities.
p62
aa(lp63
VThese informants nab people like  Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif
p64
aVand Walli Mujahidh.
p65
aVBoth are mentally ill.
p66
aVAbdul-Latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide.
p67
aVMujahidh had schizoaffective disorder,
p68
aVhe had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy.
p69
aVIn 2012, the FBI arrested these two men
p70
aVfor conspiring to attack a military recruiting station outside Seattle
p71
aVwith weapons provided,  of course, by the FBI.
p72
aVThe FBI's informant was Robert Childs,
p73
aVa convicted rapist and child molester
p74
aVwho was paid 90,000 dollars  for his work on the case.
p75
aVThis isn't an outlier.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn 2009, an FBI informant who had fled Pakistan on murder charges
p78
aVled four men in a plot to bomb  synagogues in the Bronx.
p79
aVThe lead defendant was James Cromitie,
p80
aVa broke Walmart employee with a history of mental problems.
p81
aVAnd the informant had offered  him 250,000 dollars
p82
aVif he participated in that plot.
p83
aVThere are many more examples.
p84
aa(lp85
VToday, The Intercept published my new story
p86
aVabout a counterterrorism sting in Tampa involving Sami Osmakac,
p87
aVa young man who was living  near Tampa, Florida.
p88
aVOsmakac also had  schizoaffective disorder.
p89
aVHe too was broke,
p90
aVand he had no connections to  international terrorist groups.
p91
aVNonetheless,
p92
aVan FBI informant gave him a job, handed him money,
p93
aVintroduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist,
p94
aVand lured him in a plot to bomb an Irish bar.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut here's what's interesting:
p97
aVThe lead undercover agent \u2014
p98
aVyou can see him in this picture with his face blurred \u2014
p99
aVwould go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on.
p100
aVBehind closed doors,
p101
aVFBI agents admitted that what they were doing was farcical.
p102
aVA federal judge doesn't want you to hear about these conversations.
p103
aVHe sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order
p104
aVin an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this.
p105
aVBehind closed doors, the lead agent,
p106
aVthe squad supervisor,
p107
aVdescribed their would-be terrorist
p108
aVas a "retarded fool who didn't have a pot to piss in."
p109
aVThey described his terrorist ambitions
p110
aVas wishy-washy and a pipe dream scenario.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut that didn't stop the FBI.
p113
aVThey provided Sami Osmakac  everything he needed.
p114
aVThey gave him a car bomb, they gave him an AK-47,
p115
aVthey helped him make a so-called martyrdom video,
p116
aVand they even gave  him money for a taxi cab
p117
aVso that he could get to where they wanted him to go.
p118
aVAs they were working the sting,
p119
aVthe squad supervisor tells his agents he wanted a Hollywood ending.
p120
aVAnd he got a Hollywood ending.
p121
aVWhen Sami Osmakac attempted to deliver what he thought
p122
aVwas a car bomb,
p123
aVhe was arrested, convicted and  sentenced to 40 years in prison.
p124
aa(lp125
VSami Osmakac isn't alone.
p126
aVHe's one of more than  175 so-called terrorists,
p127
aVfor whom the FBI has created  Hollywood endings.
p128
aVU.S. government officials call this the War on Terror.
p129
aVIt's really just theater,
p130
aVa national security theater,
p131
aVwith mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac
p132
aVunwitting actors in a  carefully choreographed production
p133
aVbrought to you by the FBI.
p134
aa(lp135
VThank you.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Applause)
p138
aa(lp139
VTom Rielly: So, those are some pretty strong accusations,
p140
aVpretty strong charges.
p141
aVHow can you back this up?
p142
aa(lp143
VTrevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010
p144
aVwhen I received a grant from the  Investigative Reporting Program
p145
aVat U.C. Berkeley,
p146
aVand a research assistant and I
p147
aVput together a database of all terrorism prosecutions
p148
aVat the time during  the first decade after 9/11.
p149
aVAnd we used the court file to find out whether
p150
aVthe defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups,
p151
aVwhether an informant was used,
p152
aVand whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur
p153
aVby providing the means and opportunity.
p154
aVAnd we submitted that to the FBI
p155
aVand we asked them to respond to our database.
p156
aVIf they believed there were any errors,
p157
aVwe asked them to tell us what they were and we'd go back and check
p158
aVand they never challenged any of our findings.
p159
aVLater, I used that data  in a magazine article
p160
aVand later in my book,
p161
aVand on appearances on places like CBS and NPR,
p162
aVthey were offered that opportunity again
p163
aVto say, "Trevor Aaronson's  findings are wrong."
p164
aVAnd they've never come forward and said,
p165
aV"These are the problems with those findings."
p166
aVSo the data has since been used  by groups like Human Rights Watch
p167
aVon its recent report on  these types of sting operations.
p168
aVAnd so far, the FBI has never  really responded
p169
aVto these charges that it's really not catching terrorists
p170
aVso much as it's catching mentally ill people
p171
aVthat it can dress up as terrorists  in these types of sting operations.
p172
aa(lp173
VTR: So The Intercept is that new investigative journalism website,
p174
aVthat's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald.
p175
aVTell us about your article  and why there.
p176
aa(lp177
VTA: The Intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this
p178
aVbecause my article is  really leveraging the fact that
p179
aVa source had leaked to me transcripts of these
p180
aVprivate FBI conversations that a federal judge had sealed
p181
aVbased on the government's claim  that their release
p182
aVwould irreparably damage  the U.S. government's
p183
aVlaw enforcement strategy.
p184
aVSo a place like The Intercept was set up to protect journalists
p185
aVand publish their work
p186
aVwhen they're dealing with  very sensitive matters like this.
p187
aVSo my story in The Intercept,  which was just published today,
p188
aVtells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting
p189
aVand goes into much greater detail.
p190
aVIn this talk, I could only highlight the things that they said,
p191
aVsuch as calling him a "retarded fool."
p192
aVBut it was much more elaborate,
p193
aVthey went to great lengths to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,
p194
aVwhich he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent.
p195
aVWhen he went to trial,
p196
aVthe central piece of evidence  was that he paid for these weapons,
p197
aVwhen in truth, these transcripts show how the FBI orchestrated
p198
aVsomeone who was essentially mentally ill and broke
p199
aVto get money to then  pay for weapons
p200
aVthat they could then charge him in a conspiracy for.
p201
aa(lp202
VTR: One final question.
p203
aVLess than 10 days ago,
p204
aVthe FBI arrested some potential  ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,
p205
aVsaying that they might be headed to Syria,
p206
aVand were those real, or examples of more of the same?
p207
aa(lp208
VTA: Well so far, we only know what's come out in the court file,
p209
aVbut they seem to suggest it's another example of the same.
p210
aVThese types of sting operations  have moved from flavor to flavor.
p211
aVSo initially it was al Qaeda plots,
p212
aVand now the Islamic State is the current flavor.
p213
aVWhat's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged
p214
aVonly began the plot to go to Syria
p215
aVafter the introduction of the FBI informant,
p216
aVand in fact, the FBI informant had helped them with the travel documents
p217
aVthat they needed.
p218
aVIn kind of a comical turn  in that particular case,
p219
aVone of the defendant's mother had found out
p220
aVthat he was interested in going to Syria and had hid his passport.
p221
aVSo it's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport,
p222
aVthat he ever could have gone anywhere.
p223
aVSo yes, there are people who might be interested in joining the Islamic State
p224
aVin the United States,
p225
aVand those are people that the United  States government should be looking at
p226
aVto see if they're interested in violence here.
p227
aVIn this particular case, given the evidence that's so far come out,
p228
aVit suggests the FBI made it possible for these guys
p229
aVto move along in a plan to go to Syria
p230
aVwhen they were never close  to that in the first place.
p231
aa(lp232
VTR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing. TA: Thank you.

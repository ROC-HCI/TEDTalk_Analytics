VMy journey to become a polar specialist,
p5
aVphotographing, specializing in the polar regions,
p6
aVbegan when I was four years old,
p7
aVwhen my family moved from southern Canada
p8
aVto Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland.
p9
aVThere we lived with the Inuit
p10
aVin the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people,
p11
aVwhere [we] were one of three non-Inuit families.
p12
aVAnd in this community, we didn't have a television;
p13
aVwe didn't have computers, obviously, radio.
p14
aVWe didn't even have a telephone.
p15
aVAll of my time was spent outside
p16
aVwith the Inuit, playing.
p17
aVThe snow and the ice were my sandbox,
p18
aVand the Inuit were my teachers.
p19
aVAnd that's where I became
p20
aVtruly obsessed with this polar realm.
p21
aVAnd I knew someday that I was going to do something
p22
aVthat had to do with trying to share news about it
p23
aVand protect it.
p24
aa(lp25
VI'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only,
p26
aVsome images, a cross-section of my work,
p27
aVto the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, "Have You Ever."
p28
aVI don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before,
p29
aVbut they're allowing me to show you a few images
p30
aVfrom a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet.
p31
aVNational Geographic doesn't do this,
p32
aVso I'm very excited to be able to share this with you.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd what these images are \u2014
p35
aVyou'll see them at the start of the slide show \u2014 there's only about four images \u2014
p36
aVbut it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.
p37
aVIt's pure white, but it's not a polar bear.
p38
aVIt's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear.
p39
aVThere are only 200 of these bears left.
p40
aVThey're more rare than the panda bear.
p41
aa(lp42
VI sat there on the river for two months without seeing one.
p43
aVI thought, my career's over.
p44
aVI proposed this stupid story to National Geographic.
p45
aVWhat in the heck was I thinking?
p46
aVSo I had two months to sit there
p47
aVand figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life,
p48
aVafter I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me.
p49
aVBecause National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time:
p50
aVthey publish pictures, not excuses.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd after two months of sitting there \u2014
p55
aVone day, thinking that it was all over,
p56
aVthis incredible big white male came down,
p57
aVright beside me, three feet away from me,
p58
aVand he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it.
p59
aVAnd then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream
p60
aVof walking around with this bear through the forest.
p61
aVHe went through this old-growth forest
p62
aVand sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep.
p63
aVAnd I actually got to sleep within three feet of him,
p64
aVjust in the forest, and photograph him.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I'm very excited to be able to show you those images
p67
aVand a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions.
p68
aVPlease enjoy.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Music)
p71
aa(lp72
VBrandi Carlile: \u266b Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods? \u266b
p73
aV\u266b And everything there feels just as it should \u266b
p74
aV\u266b You're part of the life there \u266b
p75
aV\u266b You're part of something good \u266b
p76
aV\u266b If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods \u266b
p77
aV\u266b Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh \u266b
p78
aV\u266b If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods \u266b
p79
aV\u266b Have you ever stared into a starry sky? \u266b
p80
aV\u266b Lying on your back, you're asking why \u266b
p81
aV\u266b What's the purpose? \u266b
p82
aV\u266b I wonder, who am I? \u266b
p83
aV\u266b If you've ever stared into a starry sky \u266b
p84
aV\u266b Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh \u266b
p85
aV\u266b Aah, ah, aah \u266b
p86
aV\u266b Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh \u266b
p87
aV\u266b Have you ever stared into a starry sky? \u266b
p88
aV\u266b Have you ever been out walking in the snow? \u266b
p89
aV\u266b Tried to get back where you were before \u266b
p90
aV\u266b You always end up \u266b
p91
aV\u266b Not knowing where to go \u266b
p92
aV\u266b If you've ever been out walking in the snow \u266b
p93
aV\u266b Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh \u266b
p94
aV\u266b Aah, ah, aah, ah, aah \u266b
p95
aV\u266b Ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, ah \u266b
p96
aV\u266b Oh, ah, ah, ah \u266b
p97
aV\u266b Ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh \u266b
p98
aV\u266b If you'd ever been out walking you would know \u266b

aa(lp102
VPaul Nicklen: Thank you very much. The show's not over.
p103
aVMy clock is ticking. OK, let's stop.
p104
aVThank you very much. I appreciate it.
p105
aa(lp106
VWe're inundated with news all the time
p107
aVthat the sea ice is disappearing
p108
aVand it's at its lowest level.
p109
aVAnd in fact, scientists were originally saying
p110
aVsea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.
p111
aVNow they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic,
p112
aVthe summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years.
p113
aVAnd what does that mean?
p114
aVAfter a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news.
p115
aVYou glaze over with it.
p116
aVAnd what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this.
p117
aVAnd I want people to understand and get the concept
p118
aVthat, if we lose ice,
p119
aVwe stand to lose an entire ecosystem.
p120
aVProjections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct
p121
aVin the next 50 to 100 years.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd there's no better, sexier,
p124
aVmore beautiful, charismatic megafauna species
p125
aVfor me to hang my campaign on.
p126
aVPolar bears are amazing hunters.
p127
aVThis was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores.
p128
aVThere was no ice around.
p129
aVBut this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it.
p130
aVAnd this bear swam out to that seal \u2014
p131
aV800 lb. bearded seal \u2014
p132
aVgrabbed it, swam back and ate it.
p133
aVAnd he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal,
p134
aVthat, as I approached him \u2014
p135
aVabout 20 feet away \u2014 to get this picture,
p136
aVhis only defense was to keep eating more seal.
p137
aVAnd as he ate, he was so full \u2014
p138
aVhe probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly \u2014
p139
aVand as he ate inside one side of his mouth,
p140
aVhe was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive,
p143
aVbut it's the ice that's disappearing.
p144
aVWe're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic.
p145
aVWhen I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago,
p146
aVwe never found dead bears.
p147
aVAnd in the last four or five years,
p148
aVwe're finding dead bears popping up all over the place.
p149
aVWe're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,
p150
aVfloating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out.
p151
aVI found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice.
p152
aVThese bears are already showing signs
p153
aVof the stress of disappearing ice.
p154
aa(lp155
VHere's a mother and her two year-old cub
p156
aVwere traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere,
p157
aVand they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice,
p158
aVwhich is great for them; they're safe at this point.
p159
aVThey're not going to die of hypothermia.
p160
aVThey're going to get to land.
p161
aVBut unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic
p162
aVare also receding right now
p163
aVto the point that the ice is ending up on land
p164
aVand not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem.
p165
aa(lp166
VThese ringed seals, these are the "fatsicles" of the Arctic.
p167
aVThese little, fat dumplings,
p168
aV150-pound bundles of blubber
p169
aVare the mainstay of the polar bear.
p170
aVAnd they're not like the harbor seals that you have here.
p171
aVThese ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle
p172
aVassociated and connected to sea ice.
p173
aVThey give birth inside the ice,
p174
aVand they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice.
p175
aVAnd here's a picture of sick ice.
p176
aVThis is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old.
p177
aVAnd what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts,
p178
aVthese big pockets of black water are forming
p179
aVand they're grabbing the sun's energy
p180
aVand accelerating the melting process.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea.
p183
aVThe visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines;
p184
aVthe ice is moving all over the place.
p185
aVI wish I could spend half an hour telling you
p186
aVabout how we almost died on this dive.
p187
aVBut what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice,
p188
aVthat big chunk of ice up in the corner.
p189
aVIn that one single piece of ice,
p190
aVyou have 300 species of microorganisms.
p191
aVAnd in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice,
p192
aVit forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice,
p193
aVand then you get bigger sheets of seaweed,
p194
aVand then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life.
p195
aVSo really what the ice does
p196
aVis it acts like a garden.
p197
aVIt acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden.
p198
aVLosing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden.
p199
aa(lp200
VHere's me in my office.
p201
aVI hope you appreciate yours.
p202
aVThis is after an hour under the ice.
p203
aVI can't feel my lips; my face is frozen;
p204
aVI can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet.
p205
aVAnd I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water.
p206
aVAfter an hour in these conditions,
p207
aVit's so extreme that, when I go down,
p208
aValmost every dive I vomit into my regulator
p209
aVbecause my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head.
p210
aVAnd so I'm just so happy that the dive is over.
p211
aVI get to hand my camera to my assistant,
p212
aVand I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, "Woo. Woo. Woo."
p213
aVWhich means, "Take my camera."
p214
aVAnd he thinks I'm saying, "Take my picture."
p215
aVSo we had this little communication breakdown.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aVBut it's worth it.
p218
aa(lp219
VI'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales,
p220
aVand narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today,
p221
aVbut this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made.
p222
aVI dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw,
p223
aVand I looked up under the underside of the ice,
p224
aVand I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo.
p225
aVI got very nervous \u2014 no rope, no safety line,
p226
aVthe whole world is moving around me \u2014
p227
aVand I thought, "I'm in trouble."
p228
aVBut what happened is that the entire underside
p229
aVwas full of these billions of amphipods and copepods
p230
aVmoving around and feeding on the underside of the ice,
p231
aVgiving birth and living out their entire life cycle.
p232
aVThis is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here.
p233
aVAnd when you have low  productivity in this, in ice,
p234
aVthe productivity in copepods go down.
p235
aa(lp236
VThis is a bowhead whale.
p237
aVSupposedly, science is stating
p238
aVthat it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now.
p239
aVThis very whale right here could be over 250 years old.
p240
aVThis whale could have been born
p241
aVaround the start of the Industrial Revolution.
p242
aVIt could have survived 150 years of whaling.
p243
aVAnd now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North
p244
aVbecause of the lives that we're leading in the South.
p245
aa(lp246
VNarwhals, these majestic narwhals
p247
aVwith their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here;
p248
aVthey could be out on the open water.
p249
aVBut they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes
p250
aVwhere they can breathe, catch a breath,
p251
aVbecause right under that ice are all the swarms of cod.
p252
aVAnd the cod are there
p253
aVbecause they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods.
p254
aa(lp255
VAlright, my favorite part.
p256
aVWhen I'm on my deathbed,
p257
aVI'm going to remember one story more than any other.
p258
aVEven though that spirit bear moment was powerful,
p259
aVI don't think I'll ever have another experience
p260
aVlike I did with these leopard seals.
p261
aVLeopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation.
p262
aVThey've got that wryly smile on their mouth.
p263
aVThey've got those black sinister eyes
p264
aVand those spots on their body.
p265
aVThey look positively prehistoric and a bit scary.
p266
aVAnd tragically in [2003],
p267
aVa scientist was taken down and drowned,
p268
aVand she was being consumed by a leopard seal.
p269
aVAnd people were like, "We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."
p270
aVAnd so people love to form their opinions.
p271
aVAnd that's when I got a story idea:
p272
aVI want to go to Antarctica,
p273
aVget in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can
p274
aVand give them a fair shake \u2014
p275
aVfind out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood.
p276
aVSo this is that story.
p277
aVOh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VAs a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute,
p282
aVtherefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad.
p283
aVIt doesn't work that way.
p284
aVThe penguin doesn't know it's cute,
p285
aVand the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous.
p286
aVThis is just the food chain unfolding.
p287
aVThey're also big.
p288
aVThey're not these little harbor seals.
p289
aVThey are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.
p290
aVAnd they're also curiously aggressive.
p291
aVYou get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac,
p292
aVfloating in these icy waters,
p293
aVand a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon.
p294
aVThe boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship
p295
aVand get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked.
p296
aVAll the leopard seal was doing \u2014
p297
aVit's just biting a balloon.
p298
aVIt just sees this big balloon in the ocean \u2014 it doesn't have hands \u2014
p299
aVit's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VSo after five days of crossing the Drake Passage \u2014
p304
aVisn't that beautiful \u2014
p305
aVafter five days of crossing the Drake Passage,
p306
aVwe have finally arrived at Antarctica.
p307
aVI'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.
p308
aVHis name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden \u2014 Goran.
p309
aVAnd he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one.
p310
aVSo we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat,
p311
aVand there's this monstrous leopard seal.
p312
aVAnd even in his voice, he goes, "That's a bloody big seal, ya."
p313
aV(Laughter)
p314
aVAnd this seal is taking this penguin by the head,
p315
aVand it's flipping it back and forth.
p316
aVAnd what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out,
p317
aVso it can eat the meat off the bones,
p318
aVand then it goes off and gets another one.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin,
p321
aVcame under the boat, the Zodiac,
p322
aVstarting hitting the hull of the boat.
p323
aVAnd we're trying to not fall in the water.
p324
aVAnd we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me,
p325
aV"This is a good seal, ya.
p326
aVIt's time for you to get in the water."
p327
aV(Laughter)
p328
aVAnd I looked at Goran, and I said to him, "Forget that."
p329
aVBut I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter "F."
p330
aVBut he was right.
p331
aVHe scolded me out, and said, "This is why we're here.
p332
aVAnd you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic.
p333
aVAnd now you've got to deliver.
p334
aVAnd you can't publish excuses."
p335
aa(lp336
VSo I had such dry mouth \u2014
p337
aVprobably not as bad as now \u2014
p338
aVbut I had such, such dry mouth.
p339
aVAnd my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs.
p340
aVI put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips.
p341
aVI put my snorkel in my mouth,
p342
aVand I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water.
p343
aVAnd this was the first thing she did.
p344
aVShe came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera \u2014
p345
aVand her teeth are up here and down here \u2014
p346
aVbut Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice.
p347
aVHe said, "If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."
p348
aa(lp349
V(Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
VSo that's all I had to work with at that point.
p352
aVBut I just started to shoot these pictures.
p353
aVSo she did this threat display for a few minutes,
p354
aVand then the most amazing thing happened \u2014 she totally relaxed.
p355
aVShe went off, she got a penguin.
p356
aVShe stopped about 10 feet away from me,
p357
aVand she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go.
p358
aVThe penguin swims toward me, takes off.
p359
aVShe grabs another one. She does this over and over.
p360
aVAnd it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin.
p361
aVWhy else would she release these penguins at me?
p362
aVAnd after she did this four or five times,
p363
aVshe swam by me with this dejected look on her face.
p364
aVYou don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me
p365
aVlike, "This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."
p366
aa(lp367
V(Laughter)
p368
aa(lp369
VSo realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins,
p370
aVshe'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me,
p371
aVbobbing like this, and she'd let them go.
p372
aVThis didn't work.
p373
aVI was laughing so hard and so emotional
p374
aVthat my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater,
p375
aVjust because it was so amazing.
p376
aVAnd so that didn't work.
p377
aVSo then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display
p378
aVsliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter)
p379
aVAnd she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me.
p380
aVThis went on for four days.
p381
aVThis just didn't happen a couple of times.
p382
aVAnd then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones,
p383
aVso she brought me dead penguins.
p384
aV(Laughter)
p385
aVNow I've got four or five penguins floating around my head,
p386
aVand I'm just sitting there shooting away.
p387
aVAnd she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face
p388
aVlike, "Are you for real?"
p389
aVBecause she can't believe I can't eat this penguin.
p390
aVBecause in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating \u2014
p391
aVand I'm not breeding, so ...
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head.
p396
aVShe was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around.
p397
aVShe's trying to force-feed my camera,
p398
aVwhich is every photographer's dream.
p399
aVAnd she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face.
p400
aVShe would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve.
p401
aVBut yet she didn't stop.
p402
aVShe would not stop trying to feed me penguins.
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd on the last day with this female
p405
aVwhere I thought I had pushed her too far,
p406
aVI got nervous because she came up to me,
p407
aVshe rolled over on her back,
p408
aVand she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok.
p409
aVAnd I thought, she's about to bite.
p410
aVShe's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me.
p411
aVWhat had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me,
p412
aVand she did that to threat display.
p413
aVShe chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin
p414
aVand brought it to me.
p415

V(Laughter)
p417
aa(lp418
VThat wasn't the only seal I got in the water with.
p419
aVI got in the water with 30 other leopard seals,
p420
aVand I never once had a scary encounter.
p421
aVThey are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with,
p422
aVand the same with polar bears.
p423
aVAnd just like the polar bears,
p424
aVthese animals depend on an icy environment.
p425
aVI get emotional. Sorry.
p426
aa(lp427
VIt's a story that lives deep in my heart,
p428
aVand I'm proud to share this with you.
p429
aVAnd I'm so passionate about it.
p430
aVAnybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go.

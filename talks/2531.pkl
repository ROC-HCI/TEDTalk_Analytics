VWhen we're designing new products,
p5
aVservices or businesses,
p6
aVthe only time you'll know if they're any good,
p7
aVif the designs are good,
p8
aVis to see how they're used in the real world, in context.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'm reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields
p11
aVin north London.
p12
aVIt's absolutely beautiful.
p13
aVThere's a big open green space.
p14
aVThere's Georgian buildings around the side.
p15
aVBut then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle.
p16
aVPeople clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge.
p17
aVInstead, they want to take the shortcut,
p18
aVand that shortcut is self-reinforcing.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, this shortcut is called a desire path,
p21
aVand it's often the path of least resistance.
p22
aVI find them fascinating,
p23
aVbecause they're often the point where design and user experience diverge.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow at this point, I should apologize,
p26
aVbecause you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere.
p27
aVBut today, I'm going to pick three I find interesting
p28
aVand share what actually it reminds me
p29
aVabout launching new products and services.
p30
aVThe first is in the capital city of Brazil \u2014 Brasilia.
p31
aVAnd it reminds me that sometimes,
p32
aVyou have to just focus on designing for a real need
p33
aVat low friction.
p34
aVNow, Brasilia is fascinating.
p35
aVIt was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.
p36
aVIt was the golden age of flying,
p37
aVso he laid it out like a plane, as you can see there.
p38
aVSlightly worryingly,
p39
aVhe put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit.
p40
aVBut if you zoom in, in the very center of Brasilia,
p41
aVjust where the point is there,
p42
aVyou see it's littered with desire paths.
p43
aVThey're absolutely everywhere.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, they thought that they had future-proofed this design.
p46
aVThey thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere \u2014
p47
aVwe'd be able to drive \u2014
p48
aVso there was little need for walkways or pavements.
p49
aVBut as you can see, there's a real need.
p50
aVThese are very dangerous desire paths.
p51
aVIf we just pick one, in the middle,
p52
aVyou can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic.
p53
aVIt won't surprise you guys
p54
aVthat Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate
p55
aVof your average US city.
p56
aVPeople are resourceful.
p57
aVThey'll always find the low-friction route
p58
aVto save money, save time.
p59
aa(lp60
VNot all these desire paths are dangerous,
p61
aVI was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow.
p62
aVMany of us get frustrated when we're confronted
p63
aVwith the obligatory walk through duty-free.
p64
aVIt was amazing to me
p65
aVhow many people refused to take the long, meandering path to the left,
p66
aVand just cut through to the right,
p67
aVcut through the desire path.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe question that's interesting is:
p70
aVWhat do designers think when they see our behavior here?
p71
aVDo they think we're stupid?
p72
aVDo they think we're lazy?
p73
aVOr do they accept that this is the only truth?
p74
aVThis is their product.
p75
aVWe're effectively co-designing their product.
p76
aVSo our job is to design for real needs at low friction,
p77
aVbecause if you don't, the customer will, anyway.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe second desire path I wanted to share
p80
aVis at the University of California.
p81
aVAnd it reminds me
p82
aVthat sometimes the best way to come up with a great design
p83
aVis just to launch it.
p84
aVNow, university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths.
p85
aVI think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart.
p86
aVSo they're dashing to lectures.
p87
aVThey'll always find the shortcut.
p88
aVAnd the designers here knew that.
p89
aVSo they built the buildings
p90
aVand then they waited a few months for the paths to form.
p91
aVThey then paved them.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVIncredibly smart approach.
p94
aVIn fact, often, just launching the straw man of a service
p95
aVcan teach you what people really want.
p96
aa(lp97
VFor example, Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant.
p98
aVBut where should it be?
p99
aVWhat should the menu be?
p100
aVHe launched a service,
p101
aVin this case a food truck,
p102
aVand he changed the location each day.
p103
aVHe'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker
p104
aVto figure out what people wanted.
p105
aVHe now has a chain of restaurants.
p106
aVSo it can be incredibly efficient
p107
aVto launch something to spot the desire paths.
p108
aa(lp109
VThe third and final desire path I wanted to share with you
p110
aVis the UNIH.
p111
aVIt reminds me that the world's in flux,
p112
aVand we have to respond to those changes.
p113
aVSo as you'll guess, this is a hospital.
p114
aVI've marked for you on the left the Oncology Department.
p115
aVThe patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right.
p116
aVThis was a patient-centered organization,
p117
aVso they laid on cars for their patients.
p118
aVBut what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy
p119
aVis the patients rarely wanted to get in cars.
p120
aVThey were too nauseous, so they'd walk back to their hotels.
p121
aVThis desire path that you see diagonally, formed.
p122
aVThe patients even called it "The Chemo Trail."
p123
aVNow, when the hospital saw this originally,
p124
aVthey tried to lay turf back over it, ignore it.
p125
aVBut after a while, they realized it was an important need
p126
aVthey were meeting for their patients,
p127
aVso they paved it.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd I think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths.
p130
aVIf we look back at the one in North London again,
p131
aVthat desire path hasn't always been there.
p132
aVThe reason it sprung up
p133
aVis people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium
p134
aVon game days,
p135
aVfrom the Underground station you see on the bottom right.
p136
aVSo you see the desire path.
p137
aVIf we just wind the clock back a few years,
p138
aVwhen the stadium was being constructed,
p139
aVthere is no desire path.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging,
p142
aVand, where appropriate, pave them,
p143
aVas someone did here.
p144
aVSomeone installed a barrier,
p145
aVpeople started walking across and round the bottom as you see,
p146
aVand they paved it.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VBut I think this is a wonderful reminder as well,
p151
aVthat, actually, the world is in flux.
p152
aVIt's constantly changing,
p153
aVbecause if you look at the top of this image,
p154
aVthere's another desire path forming.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo these three desire paths remind me
p157
aVwe need to design for real human needs.
p158
aVI think empathy for what your customers want
p159
aVis probably the biggest leading indicator of business success.
p160
aVDesign for real needs
p161
aVand design them in low friction,
p162
aVbecause if you don't offer them in low friction,
p163
aVsomeone else will, often the customer.
p164
aa(lp165
VSecondly, often the best way to learn what people really want
p166
aVis to launch your service.
p167
aVThe answer is rarely inside the building.
p168
aVGet out there and see what people really want.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd finally, in part because of technology,
p171
aVthe world is incredibly flux at the moment.
p172
aVIt's changing constantly.
p173
aVThese desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever.
p174
aVOur job is to pick the appropriate ones
p175
aVand pave over them.
p176
aa(lp177
VThank you very much.

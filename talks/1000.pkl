VI have a doppelganger.

aV(Laughter)
p6
aVDr. Gero is a brilliant
p7
aVbut slightly mad scientist
p8
aVin the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga."
p9
aVIf you look very carefully,
p10
aVyou see that his skull has been replaced
p11
aVwith a transparent Plexiglas dome
p12
aVso that the workings of his brain can be observed
p13
aVand also controlled with light.
p14
aVThat's exactly what I do \u2014
p15
aVoptical mind control.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VBut in contrast to my evil twin
p20
aVwho lusts after world domination,
p21
aVmy motives are not sinister.
p22
aVI control the brain
p23
aVin order to understand how it works.
p24
aVNow wait a minute, you may say,
p25
aVhow can you go straight to controlling the brain
p26
aVwithout understanding it first?
p27
aVIsn't that putting the cart before the horse?
p28
aVMany neuroscientists agree with this view
p29
aVand think that understanding will come
p30
aVfrom more detailed observation and analysis.
p31
aVThey say, "If we could record the activity of our neurons,
p32
aVwe would understand the brain."
p33
aVBut think for a moment what that means.
p34
aVEven if we could measure
p35
aVwhat every cell is doing at all times,
p36
aVwe would still have to make sense
p37
aVof the recorded activity patterns,
p38
aVand that's so difficult,
p39
aVchances are we'll understand these patterns
p40
aVjust as little as the brains that produce them.
p41
aa(lp42
VTake a look at what brain activity might look like.
p43
aVIn this simulation, each black dot
p44
aVis one nerve cell.
p45
aVThe dot is visible
p46
aVwhenever a cell fires an electrical impulse.
p47
aVThere's 10,000 neurons here.
p48
aVSo you're looking at roughly one percent
p49
aVof the brain of a cockroach.
p50
aVYour brains are about 100 million times
p51
aVmore complicated.
p52
aVSomewhere, in a pattern like this,
p53
aVis you,
p54
aVyour perceptions,
p55
aVyour emotions, your memories,
p56
aVyour plans for the future.
p57
aVBut we don't know where,
p58
aVsince we don't know how to read the pattern.
p59
aVWe don't understand the code used by the brain.
p60
aVTo make progress,
p61
aVwe need to break the code.
p62
aVBut how?
p63
aVAn experienced code-breaker will tell you
p64
aVthat in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean,
p65
aVit's essential to be able to play with them,
p66
aVto rearrange them at will.
p67
aVSo in this situation too,
p68
aVto decode the information
p69
aVcontained in patterns like this,
p70
aVwatching alone won't do.
p71
aVWe need to rearrange the pattern.
p72
aVIn other words,
p73
aVinstead of recording the activity of neurons,
p74
aVwe need to control it.
p75
aVIt's not essential that we can control
p76
aVthe activity of all neurons in the brain, just some.
p77
aVThe more targeted our interventions, the better.
p78
aVAnd I'll show you in a moment
p79
aVhow we can achieve the necessary precision.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose,
p82
aVI don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system
p83
aVwill at once unravel all its mysteries.
p84
aVBut we'll certainly learn a lot.
p85
aVNow, I'm by no means
p86
aVthe first person to realize
p87
aVhow powerful a tool intervention is.
p88
aVThe history of attempts
p89
aVto tinker with the function of the nervous system
p90
aVis long and illustrious.
p91
aVIt dates back at least 200 years,
p92
aVto Galvani's famous experiments
p93
aVin the late 18th century and beyond.
p94
aVGalvani showed that a frog's legs twitched
p95
aVwhen he connected the lumbar nerve
p96
aVto a source of electrical current.
p97
aVThis experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental,
p98
aVnugget of the neural code:
p99
aVthat information is written in the form
p100
aVof electrical impulses.
p101
aVGalvani's approach
p102
aVof probing the nervous system with electrodes
p103
aVhas remained state-of-the-art until today,
p104
aVdespite a number of drawbacks.
p105
aVSticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude.
p106
aVIt's hard to do in animals that run around,
p107
aVand there is a physical limit
p108
aVto the number of wires
p109
aVthat can be inserted simultaneously.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo around the turn of the last century,
p112
aVI started to think,
p113
aV"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic
p114
aVand turn it upside down?"
p115
aVSo instead of inserting a wire
p116
aVinto one spot of the brain,
p117
aVre-engineer the brain itself
p118
aVso that some of its neural elements
p119
aVbecome responsive to diffusely broadcast signals
p120
aVsuch as a flash of light.
p121
aVSuch an approach would literally, in a flash of light,
p122
aVovercome many of the obstacles to discovery.
p123
aVFirst, it's clearly a non-invasive,
p124
aVwireless form of communication.
p125
aVAnd second, just as in a radio broadcast,
p126
aVyou can communicate with many receivers at once.
p127
aVYou don't need to know where these receivers are,
p128
aVand it doesn't matter if these receivers move \u2014
p129
aVjust think of the stereo in your car.
p130
aVIt gets even better,
p131
aVfor it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers
p132
aVout of materials that are encoded in DNA.
p133
aVSo each nerve cell
p134
aVwith the right genetic makeup
p135
aVwill spontaneously produce a receiver
p136
aVthat allows us to control its function.
p137
aVI hope you'll appreciate
p138
aVthe beautiful simplicity
p139
aVof this concept.
p140
aVThere's no high-tech gizmos here,
p141
aVjust biology revealed through biology.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close.
p144
aVAs we zoom in on one of these purple neurons,
p145
aVwe see that its outer membrane
p146
aVis studded with microscopic pores.
p147
aVPores like these conduct electrical current
p148
aVand are responsible
p149
aVfor all the communication in the nervous system.
p150
aVBut these pores here are special.
p151
aVThey are coupled to light receptors
p152
aVsimilar to the ones in your eyes.
p153
aVWhenever a flash of light hits the receptor,
p154
aVthe pore opens, an electrical current is switched on,
p155
aVand the neuron fires electrical impulses.
p156
aVBecause the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA,
p157
aVwe can achieve incredible precision.
p158
aVThis is because,
p159
aValthough each cell in our bodies
p160
aVcontains the same set of genes,
p161
aVdifferent mixes of genes get turned on and off
p162
aVin different cells.
p163
aVYou can exploit this to make sure
p164
aVthat only some neurons
p165
aVcontain our light-activated pore and others don't.
p166
aVSo in this cartoon, the bluish white cell
p167
aVin the upper-left corner
p168
aVdoes not respond to light
p169
aVbecause it lacks the light-activated pore.
p170
aVThe approach works so well
p171
aVthat we can write purely artificial messages
p172
aVdirectly to the brain.
p173
aVIn this example, each electrical impulse,
p174
aVeach deflection on the trace,
p175
aVis caused by a brief pulse of light.
p176
aVAnd the approach, of course, also works
p177
aVin moving, behaving animals.
p178
aa(lp179
VThis is the first ever such experiment,
p180
aVsort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's.
p181
aVIt was done six or seven years ago
p182
aVby my then graduate student, Susana Lima.
p183
aVSusana had engineered the fruit fly on the left
p184
aVso that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain
p185
aVexpressed the light-activated pore.
p186
aVYou're familiar with these cells
p187
aVbecause they are the ones that frustrate you
p188
aVwhen you try to swat the fly.
p189
aVThey trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air
p190
aVand fly away whenever you move your hand in position.
p191
aVAnd you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.
p192
aVThe animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them,
p193
aVbut it can't actually take off
p194
aVbecause the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.
p195
aVNow to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly
p196
aVto a flash it could see,
p197
aVSusana did a simple
p198
aVbut brutally effective experiment.
p199
aVShe cut the heads off of her flies.
p200
aVThese headless bodies can live for about a day,
p201
aVbut they don't do much.
p202
aVThey just stand around
p203
aVand groom excessively.
p204
aVSo it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVAnyway, as you'll see in a moment,
p207
aVSusana was able to turn on the flight motor
p208
aVof what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies
p209
aVand get some of the headless bodies
p210
aVto actually take off and fly away.
p211
aVThey didn't get very far, obviously.
p212
aVSince we took these first steps,
p213
aVthe field of optogenetics has exploded.
p214
aVAnd there are now hundreds of labs
p215
aVusing these approaches.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd we've come a long way
p218
aVsince Galvani's and Susana's first successes
p219
aVin making animals twitch or jump.
p220
aVWe can now actually interfere with their psychology
p221
aVin rather profound ways,
p222
aVas I'll show you in my last example,
p223
aVwhich is directed at a familiar question.
p224
aVLife is a string of choices
p225
aVcreating a constant pressure to decide what to do next.
p226
aVWe cope with this pressure by having brains,
p227
aVand within our brains, decision-making centers
p228
aVthat I've called here the "Actor."
p229
aVThe Actor implements a policy that takes into account
p230
aVthe state of the environment
p231
aVand the context in which we operate.
p232
aVOur actions change the environment, or context,
p233
aVand these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.
p234
aa(lp235
VNow to put some neurobiological meat
p236
aVon this abstract model,
p237
aVwe constructed a simple one-dimensional world
p238
aVfor our favorite subject, fruit flies.
p239
aVEach chamber in these two vertical stacks
p240
aVcontains one fly.
p241
aVThe left and the right halves of the chamber
p242
aVare filled with two different odors,
p243
aVand a security camera watches
p244
aVas the flies pace up and down between them.
p245
aVHere's some such CCTV footage.
p246
aVWhenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber
p247
aVwhere the two odor streams meet,
p248
aVit has to make a decision.
p249
aVIt has to decide whether to turn around
p250
aVand stay in the same odor,
p251
aVor whether to cross the midline
p252
aVand try something new.
p253
aVThese decisions are clearly a reflection
p254
aVof the Actor's policy.
p255
aVNow for an intelligent being like our fly,
p256
aVthis policy is not written in stone
p257
aVbut rather changes as the animal learns from experience.
p258
aVWe can incorporate such an element
p259
aVof adaptive intelligence into our model
p260
aVby assuming that the fly's brain
p261
aVcontains not only an Actor,
p262
aVbut a different group of cells,
p263
aVa "Critic," that provides a running commentary
p264
aVon the Actor's choices.
p265
aVYou can think of this nagging inner voice
p266
aVas sort of the brain's equivalent
p267
aVof the Catholic Church,
p268
aVif you're an Austrian like me,
p269
aVor the super-ego, if you're Freudian,
p270
aVor your mother, if you're Jewish.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VNow obviously,
p275
aVthe Critic is a key ingredient
p276
aVin what makes us intelligent.
p277
aVSo we set out to identify
p278
aVthe cells in the fly's brain
p279
aVthat played the role of the Critic.
p280
aVAnd the logic of our experiment was simple.
p281
aVWe thought if we could use our optical remote control
p282
aVto activate the cells of the Critic,
p283
aVwe should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor
p284
aVinto changing its policy.
p285
aVIn other words,
p286
aVthe fly should learn from mistakes
p287
aVthat it thought it had made
p288
aVbut, in reality, it had not made.
p289
aVSo we bred flies
p290
aVwhose brains were more or less randomly peppered
p291
aVwith cells that were light addressable.
p292
aVAnd then we took these flies
p293
aVand allowed them to make choices.
p294
aVAnd whenever they made one of the two choices,
p295
aVchose one odor,
p296
aVin this case the blue one over the orange one,
p297
aVwe switched on the lights.
p298
aVIf the Critic was among the optically activated cells,
p299
aVthe result of this intervention
p300
aVshould be a change in policy.
p301
aVThe fly should learn to avoid
p302
aVthe optically reinforced odor.
p303
aa(lp304
VHere's what happened in two instances:
p305
aVWe're comparing two strains of flies,
p306
aVeach of them having
p307
aVabout 100 light-addressable cells in their brains,
p308
aVshown here in green on the left and on the right.
p309
aVWhat's common among these groups of cells
p310
aVis that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine.
p311
aVBut the identities of the individual
p312
aVdopamine-producing neurons
p313
aVare clearly largely different on the left and on the right.
p314
aVOptically activating
p315
aVthese hundred or so cells
p316
aVinto two strains of flies
p317
aVhas dramatically different consequences.
p318
aVIf you look first at the behavior
p319
aVof the fly on the right,
p320
aVyou can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber
p321
aVwhere the two odors meet,
p322
aVit marches straight through, as it did before.
p323
aVIts behavior is completely unchanged.
p324
aVBut the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.
p325
aVWhenever it comes up to the midpoint,
p326
aVit pauses,
p327
aVit carefully scans the odor interface
p328
aVas if it was sniffing out its environment,
p329
aVand then it turns around.
p330
aVThis means that the policy that the Actor implements
p331
aVnow includes an instruction to avoid the odor
p332
aVthat's in the right half of the chamber.
p333
aVThis means that the Critic
p334
aVmust have spoken in that animal,
p335
aVand that the Critic must be contained
p336
aVamong the dopamine-producing neurons on the left,
p337
aVbut not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.
p338
aa(lp339
VThrough many such experiments,
p340
aVwe were able to narrow down
p341
aVthe identity of the Critic
p342
aVto just 12 cells.
p343
aVThese 12 cells, as shown here in green,
p344
aVsend the output to a brain structure
p345
aVcalled the "mushroom body,"
p346
aVwhich is shown here in gray.
p347
aVWe know from our formal model
p348
aVthat the brain structure
p349
aVat the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor.
p350
aVSo this anatomy suggests
p351
aVthat the mushroom bodies have something to do
p352
aVwith action choice.
p353
aVBased on everything we know about the mushroom bodies,
p354
aVthis makes perfect sense.
p355
aVIn fact, it makes so much sense
p356
aVthat we can construct an electronic toy circuit
p357
aVthat simulates the behavior of the fly.
p358
aVIn this electronic toy circuit,
p359
aVthe mushroom body neurons are symbolized
p360
aVby the vertical bank of blue LEDs
p361
aVin the center of the board.
p362
aVThese LED's are wired to sensors
p363
aVthat detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air.
p364
aVEach odor activates a different combination of sensors,
p365
aVwhich in turn activates
p366
aVa different odor detector in the mushroom body.
p367
aVSo the pilot in the cockpit of the fly,
p368
aVthe Actor,
p369
aVcan tell which odor is present
p370
aVsimply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.
p371
aa(lp372
VWhat the Actor does with this information
p373
aVdepends on its policy,
p374
aVwhich is stored in the strengths of the connection,
p375
aVbetween the odor detectors
p376
aVand the motors
p377
aVthat power the fly's evasive actions.
p378
aVIf the connection is weak, the motors will stay off
p379
aVand the fly will continue straight on its course.
p380
aVIf the connection is strong, the motors will turn on
p381
aVand the fly will initiate a turn.
p382
aVNow consider a situation
p383
aVin which the motors stay off,
p384
aVthe fly continues on its path
p385
aVand it suffers some painful consequence
p386
aVsuch as getting zapped.
p387
aVIn a situation like this,
p388
aVwe would expect the Critic to speak up
p389
aVand to tell the Actor
p390
aVto change its policy.
p391
aVWe have created such a situation, artificially,
p392
aVby turning on the critic with a flash of light.
p393
aVThat caused a strengthening of the connections
p394
aVbetween the currently active odor detector
p395
aVand the motors.
p396
aVSo the next time
p397
aVthe fly finds itself facing the same odor again,
p398
aVthe connection is strong enough to turn on the motors
p399
aVand to trigger an evasive maneuver.
p400
aa(lp401
VI don't know about you,
p402
aVbut I find it exhilarating to see
p403
aVhow vague psychological notions
p404
aVevaporate and give rise
p405
aVto a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind,
p406
aVeven if it's the mind of the fly.
p407
aVThis is one piece of good news.
p408
aVThe other piece of good news,
p409
aVfor a scientist at least,
p410
aVis that much remains to be discovered.
p411
aVIn the experiments I told you about,
p412
aVwe have lifted the identity of the Critic,
p413
aVbut we still have no idea
p414
aVhow the Critic does its job.
p415
aVCome to think of it, knowing when you're wrong
p416
aVwithout a teacher, or your mother, telling you,
p417
aVis a very hard problem.
p418
aVThere are some ideas in computer science
p419
aVand in artificial intelligence
p420
aVas to how this might be done,
p421
aVbut we still haven't solved
p422
aVa single example
p423
aVof how intelligent behavior
p424
aVsprings from the physical interactions
p425
aVin living matter.
p426
aVI think we'll get there in the not too distant future.
p427

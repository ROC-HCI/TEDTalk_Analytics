VHow many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?
p5
aVAny of you get really freaked out by that?
p6
aVYou might want to leave now.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VSo this is a vending machine for crows.
p11
aVOver the past few days, many of you have been asking,
p12
aV"How did you come to this? How did you get started doing this?"
p13
aVIt started, as with many great ideas,
p14
aVor many ideas you can't get rid of, anyway,
p15
aVat a cocktail party.
p16
aVAbout 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine.
p17
aVWe were sitting there, and he was complaining about the crows
p18
aVthat were all over his yard and making a big mess.
p19
aVAnd he was telling me we ought to eradicate these things,
p20
aVkill them, because they're making a mess.
p21
aVI said that was stupid,
p22
aVmaybe we should just train them to do something useful.
p23
aVAnd he said that was impossible.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying,
p26
aVwhen someone tells you it's impossible.
p27
aVSo I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd after 10 years of this, my wife said,
p32
aV"You've got to do this thing you've been talking about,
p33
aVand build the vending machine."
p34
aVSo I did.
p35
aVBut part of the reason I found this interesting is,
p36
aVI started noticing that we're very aware of all the species
p37
aVthat are going extinct on the planet
p38
aVas a result of human habitation expansion,
p39
aVand no one seems to be paying attention to all the species
p40
aVthat are actually living; they're surviving.
p41
aVAnd I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species,
p42
aVwhich have adapted specifically for human ecologies,
p43
aVspecies like rats and cockroaches and crows.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.
p46
aVThey'd become extremely adept at living with us.
p47
aVAnd in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.
p52
aVWe were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.
p53
aVSo, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.
p54
aVAnd cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows,
p55
aVhave become really immune to the poisons that we're using.
p56
aVSo I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial;
p57
aVsomething that we can both benefit from,
p58
aVand find some way to make a new relationship with these species.
p59
aVSo I built the vending machine.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting
p62
aVif you know more about crows.
p63
aVIt turns out, crows aren't just surviving with human beings;
p64
aVthey're actually thriving.
p65
aVThey're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic
p66
aVand the southern tip of South America.
p67
aVAnd in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding
p68
aVmore than five kilometers away from human beings.
p69
aVSo we may not think about them, but they're always around.
p70
aVAnd not surprisingly, given the human population growth,
p71
aVmore than half of the human population is living in cities now.
p72
aVAnd out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population
p73
aVis occurring in cities.
p74
aVWe're seeing a population boom with crows.
p75
aVSo bird counts are indicating
p76
aVthat we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.
p77
aVSo that's no great surprise.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut what was really interesting to me was to find out
p80
aVthat the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.
p81
aVAnd I'll give you an example of that.
p82
aVThis is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow.
p83
aVAnd these crows use sticks in the wild
p84
aVto get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood.
p85
aVHere, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.
p86
aVBut the researchers had a problem.
p87
aVThey messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.
p88
aVAnd she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.
p89
aVYou see, it wasn't working very well.
p90
aVSo she adapted.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow, this is completely unprompted; she had never seen this done before.
p93
aVNo one taught her to bend this into a hook
p94
aVor had shown her how it could happen.
p95
aVBut she did it all on her own.
p96
aVSo keep in mind \u2014 she's never seen this done.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VRight.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VYeah. All right.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VSo that's the part where the researchers freak out.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VIt turns out,
p113
aVwe've been finding more and more that crows are really intelligent.
p114
aVTheir brains are in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.
p115
aVThere's all kinds of anecdotes
p116
aVfor the different kinds of intelligence they have.
p117
aVFor example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen
p118
aVto drop lines through holes in the ice.
p119
aVAnd when the fishermen move off,
p120
aVthe crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait.
p121
aVIt's pretty annoying for the fishermen.
p122
aa(lp123
VOn an entirely different tack,
p124
aVat University of Washington a few years ago,
p125
aVthey were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.
p126
aVSome students went out, netted some crows, brought them in,
p127
aVweighed and measured them, and let them back out again.
p128
aVAnd they were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week,
p129
aVwhenever these particular students walked around campus,
p130
aVthese crows would caw at them and run around,
p131
aVand make their life kind of miserable.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VThey were significantly less entertained
p136
aVwhen this went on for the next week.
p137
aVAnd the next month.
p138
aVAnd after summer break.
p139
aVUntil they finally graduated and left campus,
p140
aVand \u2014 glad to get away, I'm sure \u2014
p141
aVcame back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VSo, the moral being: don't piss off crows.
p146
aVSo now, students at the University of Washington
p147
aVthat are studying these crows, do so with a giant wig and a big mask.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VIt's fairly interesting.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VSo we know these crows are really smart,
p156
aVbut the more I dug into this, the more I found
p157
aVthat they actually have an even more significant adaptation.
p158
aa(lp159
VVideo: Crows have become highly skilled at making a living
p160
aVin these new urban environments.
p161
aVIn this Japanese city, they have devised a way of eating a food
p162
aVthat normally they can't manage:
p163
aVdrop it among the traffic.
p164
aVThe problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over.
p165
aVWait for the light to stop the traffic.
p166
aVThen, collect your cracked nut in safety.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
V(Applause)
p171
aa(lp172
VJoshua Klein: Yeah, pretty interesting.
p173
aVWhat's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars
p174
aVto crack nuts.
p175
aVIn fact, that's old hat for crows.
p176
aVThis happened about 10 years ago
p177
aVin a place called Sendai City, at a driving school
p178
aVin the suburbs of Tokyo.
p179
aVAnd since that time,
p180
aVall the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior.
p181
aVNow every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk,
p182
aVwaiting to collect its lunch.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo they're learning from each other. And research bears this out.
p185
aVParents seem to be teaching their young.
p186
aVThey learn from their peers, they learn from their enemies.
p187
aVIf I have a little extra time,
p188
aVI'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity
p189
aVthat illustrates that nicely.
p190
aVThe point being, they've developed cultural adaptation.
p191
aVAnd as we heard yesterday,
p192
aVthat's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble,
p193
aVand we're starting to see it with them.
p194
aVThey're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt
p195
aVto new challenges and new resources in their environment,
p196
aVwhich is really useful if you live in a city.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo we know that there's lots of crows.
p199
aVWe found out they're really smart and they can teach each other.
p200
aVWhen all this became clear,
p201
aVI realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.
p202
aVSo that's what we did.
p203
aVThis is a vending machine for crows.
p204
aVAnd it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.
p205
aVIt's pretty simple.
p206
aVBasically, what happens is that we put this out in a field
p207
aVor someplace where there's lots of crows.
p208
aVWe put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.
p209
aVCrows eventually come by, eat the peanuts,
p210
aVand get used to the machine being there.
p211
aVEventually, they eat all the peanuts.
p212
aVThen they see peanuts here on the feeder tray,
p213
aVand hop up and help themselves.
p214
aVThen they leave, the machine spits up more coins and peanuts,
p215
aVand life is dandy if you're a crow \u2014
p216
aVyou can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.
p219
aVNow they're used to the sound of the machine;
p220
aVthey keep coming back and digging out peanuts
p221
aVfrom the pile of coins that's there.
p222
aVWhen they get really happy about this, we stymie them.
p223
aa(lp224
VWe move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin.
p225
aVNow, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing,
p226
aVthis really pisses them off.
p227
aVSo they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something:
p228
aVsweep things out of the way with their beak.
p229
aVThey do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot.
p230
aVWhen that happens, they get a peanut.
p231
aVThis goes on for some time.
p232
aVThe crows learn that all they have to do is show up,
p233
aVwait for the coin to come out, put it in the slot,
p234
aVthen get their peanut.
p235
aa(lp236
VWhen they're good and comfortable with that,
p237
aVwe move to the final stage, where they show up and nothing happens.
p238
aVThis is where we see the difference between crows and other animals.
p239
aVSquirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away.
p240
aVCome back, look for the peanut, go away.
p241
aVThey do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored,
p242
aVand then they go off and play in traffic.
p243
aa(lp244
VCrows, on the other hand, show up and they try and figure it out.
p245
aVThey know this machine has been messing with them
p246
aVthrough three different stages of behavior.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VThey figure there must be more to it.
p251
aVSo they poke at it and peck at it.
p252
aVAnd eventually some crow gets a bright idea:
p253
aV"Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage,
p254
aVhops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot, and we're off to the races.
p255
aVThat crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts,
p256
aVuntil his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo, what's significant about this to me
p259
aVisn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.
p260
aVMind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year,
p261
aVbut I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VInstead, I think we should look a little bit larger.
p266
aVI think crows can be trained to do other things.
p267
aVFor example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events?
p268
aVOr find expensive components from discarded electronics?
p269
aVOr maybe do search and rescue?
p270
aVThe main point of all this for me is,
p271
aVwe can find mutually beneficial systems for these species.
p272
aVWe can find ways to interact with these other species
p273
aVthat doesn't involve exterminating them,
p274
aVbut involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance.
p275
aa(lp276
VThanks very much.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Applause)

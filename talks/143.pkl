VSo I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
p5
aVAnd this is a pretty well-educated audience,
p6
aVso I imagine you all know something about AIDS.
p7
aVYou probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa
p8
aVare infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty,
p9
aVand that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.
p10
aVIf you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date,
p11
aVis the only country in sub-Saharan Africa
p12
aVthat has had success in combating the epidemic.
p13
aVUsing a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms \u2014
p14
aVthe ABC campaign \u2014 they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s
p15
aVfrom about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.
p16
aVIf you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago
p17
aVthe president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years,
p18
aVand a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda
p19
aVand use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo today I'm going to talk about some things
p22
aVthat you might not know about the epidemic,
p23
aVand I'm actually also going to challenge
p24
aVsome of these things that you think that you do know.
p25
aVTo do that I'm going to talk about my research
p26
aVas an economist on the epidemic.
p27
aVAnd I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.
p28
aVI'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.
p29
aVBut I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists
p30
aVto think about a problem that's more traditionally
p31
aVpart of public health and epidemiology.
p32
aVAnd I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea.
p33
aVHere I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline
p34
aVto think about problems of another.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.
p37
aVAnd probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.
p38
aVBut this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.
p39
aVIt's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.
p40
aVI think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff,
p41
aVwhich is really the most important,
p42
aVbut I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude
p43
aVthat we actually cannot develop effective policy
p44
aVunless we really understand how the epidemic works.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd the first thing that I want to talk about,
p47
aVthe first thing I think we need to understand is:
p48
aVhow do people respond to the epidemic?
p49
aVSo AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.
p50
aVSo this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS,
p51
aVthere's a really significant cost of sex.
p52
aVIf you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent,
p53
aVif you have one more partner this year \u2014 a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress \u2014
p54
aVyour chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.
p55
aa(lp56
VThat is a huge effect.
p57
aVAnd so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.
p58
aVAnd in fact among gay men in the US
p59
aVwe did see that kind of change in the 1980s.
p60
aVSo if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked,
p61
aV"Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?"
p62
aVOver a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.
p63
aVIt's a huge change in a very short period of time.
p64
aa(lp65
VWe didn't see anything like that in Africa.
p66
aVSo we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here
p67
aVthe share of single men having pre-marital sex,
p68
aVor married men having extra-marital sex,
p69
aVand how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s,
p70
aVand late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.
p71
aVPeople are learning more things about it.
p72
aVWe see almost no change in sexual behavior.
p73
aVThese are just tiny decreases \u2014 two percentage points \u2014 not significant.
p74
aa(lp75
VThis seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this,
p76
aVand that to understand this you need to think about health
p77
aVthe way than an economist does \u2014 as an investment.
p78
aVSo if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about
p79
aVwhether to add some new functionality to your program,
p80
aVit's important to think about how much it costs.
p81
aVIt's also important to think about what the benefit is.
p82
aVAnd one part of that benefit is how much longer
p83
aVyou think this program is going to be active.
p84
aVIf version 10 is coming out next week,
p85
aVthere's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut your health decisions are the same.
p88
aVEvery time you have a carrot instead of a cookie,
p89
aVevery time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies,
p90
aVthat's a costly investment in your health.
p91
aVBut how much you want to invest is going to depend
p92
aVon how much longer you expect to live in the future,
p93
aVeven if you don't make those investments.
p94
aVAIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.
p95
aVPeople really like to have sex.
p96
aVBut, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.
p97
aVBut life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low:
p98
aV40 or 50 years in a lot of places.
p99
aVI think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact,
p100
aVthat maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut we really need to test that.
p103
aVAnd a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see:
p104
aVdo people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?
p105
aVAnd the way that I'm going to do that is,
p106
aVI'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.
p107
aVSo malaria is a disease that kills you.
p108
aVIt's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.
p109
aVAnd so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria
p110
aVare going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.
p111
aVSo one way to test to see whether we can explain
p112
aVsome of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy
p113
aVis to look and see is there more behavior change
p114
aVin areas where there's less malaria.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo that's what this figure shows you.
p117
aVThis shows you \u2014 in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria \u2014
p118
aVwhat happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.
p119
aVIf you look at the blue line,
p120
aVthe areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas,
p121
aVactually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot
p122
aVas HIV prevalence goes up.
p123
aVAreas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some \u2014
p124
aVit doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria \u2014
p125
aVactually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.
p126
aa(lp127
VThis is not just through malaria.
p128
aVYoung women who live in areas with high maternal mortality
p129
aVchange their behavior less in response to HIV
p130
aVthan young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.
p131
aVThere's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave.
p134
aVIt tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut it also tells us something about policy.
p137
aVEven if you only cared about AIDS in Africa,
p138
aVit might still be a good idea to invest in malaria,
p139
aVin combating poor indoor air quality,
p140
aVin improving maternal mortality rates.
p141
aVBecause if you improve those things,
p142
aVthen people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.
p143
aVBut it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.
p144
aVEducation campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding,
p145
aVmay not be enough, at least not alone.
p146
aVIf people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own,
p147
aVeven if they know everything about the disease,
p148
aVthey still may not change their behavior.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself.
p151
aVPeople aren't changing their behavior enough
p152
aVto decrease the growth in the epidemic.
p153
aVSo we're going to need to think about policy
p154
aVand what kind of policies might be effective.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past.
p157
aVThe reason that we know that the ABC campaign
p158
aVwas effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.
p159
aVIn Uganda we see the prevalence went down.
p160
aVWe know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.
p161
aVIt's not the only place we had any interventions.
p162
aVOther places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places
p163
aVand see what happened to their prevalence?
p164
aa(lp165
VUnfortunately, there's almost no good data
p166
aVon HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.
p167
aVSo if I asked you, "Why don't you go and find me
p168
aVthe prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?"
p169
aVYou get on Google, you Google, and you find,
p170
aVactually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991
p171
aVare STD patients and pregnant women,
p172
aVwhich is not a terribly representative group of people.
p173
aVThen if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on,
p174
aVyou'd find that actually that was a pretty good year,
p175
aVbecause in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.
p176
aVBut even worse \u2014 some years it's only IV drug users,
p177
aVsome years it's only pregnant women.
p178
aVWe have no way to figure out what happened over time.
p179
aVWe have no consistent testing.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing.
p182
aVIn Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries,
p183
aVthere's been testing in random samples of the population.
p184
aVBut this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.
p185
aVSo I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003,
p186
aVbut I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research.
p189
aVAnd I started thinking about how else might we figure out
p190
aVwhat the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.
p191
aVAnd I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data,
p192
aVand we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.
p193
aa(lp194
VTo do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact
p195
aVthat AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.
p196
aVIt kills people in the prime of their lives.
p197
aVNot a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here \u2014
p198
aVthis is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.
p199
aVBotswana is a place with a lot of AIDS,
p200
aVEgypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.
p201
aVAnd you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.
p202
aVThat suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut in this middle region, between 20 and 45,
p205
aVthe death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.
p206
aVBut since there are very few other diseases that kill people,
p207
aVwe can really attribute that mortality to HIV.
p208
aVBut because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago,
p209
aVwe can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.
p210
aVSo it turns out, if you use this technique,
p211
aVactually your estimates of prevalence are very close
p212
aVto what we get from testing random samples in the population,
p213
aVbut they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS,
p216
aVand prevalence based on the mortality data
p217
aVfor the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.
p218
aVYou can see, almost without exception,
p219
aVthe UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.
p220
aVUNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent,
p221
aVand mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.
p222
aVAnd these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.
p223
aVSo this is another way to see this.
p224
aVYou can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says,
p225
aVwe have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000
p226
aVrather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.
p227
aa(lp228
VI'm going to talk a little bit in a minute
p229
aVabout how we can use this kind of information to learn something
p230
aVthat's going to help us think about the world.
p231
aVBut this also tells us that one of these facts
p232
aVthat I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.
p233
aVIf you think that 25 million people are infected,
p234
aVif you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high,
p235
aVmaybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.
p236
aVIt doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.
p237
aVBut it does suggest that that number might be a little big.
p238
aVWhat I really want to do, is I want to use this new data
p239
aVto try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports.
p242
aVWhen I started working on these projects,
p243
aVI was not thinking at all about economics,
p244
aVbut eventually it kind of sucks you back in.
p245
aVSo I am going to talk about exports and prices.
p246
aVAnd I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity,
p247
aVin particular export volume, and HIV infections.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar
p250
aVwith the fact that development, that openness to trade,
p251
aVis really good for developing countries.
p252
aVIt's good for improving people's lives.
p253
aVBut openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost
p254
aVwhen we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.
p255
aVOn Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett
p256
aVthat I'm definitely going to get the bird flu,
p257
aVand I wouldn't be at all worried about that
p258
aVif we never had any contact with Asia.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit.
p261
aVThe epidemic was introduced to the US
p262
aVby actually one male steward on an airline flight,
p263
aVwho got the disease in Africa and brought it back.
p264
aVAnd that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.
p265
aVIn Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time
p266
aVthat truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.
p267
aVAreas with a lot of economic activity \u2014
p268
aVwith a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization \u2014
p269
aVthose areas have higher prevalence than others.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut that actually doesn't mean at all
p272
aVthat if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.
p273
aVBy using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time,
p274
aVwe can actually test that. And so it seems to be \u2014
p275
aVfortunately, I think \u2014 it seems to be the case
p276
aVthat these things are positively related.
p277
aVMore exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.
p278
aVSo the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume,
p279
aVit will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.
p282
aVFrom a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change,
p283
aVfor example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act
p284
aVor other policies that encourage trade,
p285
aVwe can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.
p286
aVAnd we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.
p287
aVLikewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports,
p288
aVif we know there's this externality \u2014
p289
aVthis extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports \u2014
p290
aVwe can think about what the right kinds of policies are.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.
p293
aVEven though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS,
p294
aVin the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS,
p295
aVit's not necessarily the case that improving poverty \u2014 at least in the short run,
p296
aVthat improving exports and improving development \u2014
p297
aVit's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead
p298
aVto a decline in HIV prevalence.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times
p301
aVthe special case of Uganda, and the fact that
p302
aVit's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.
p303
aVIt's been widely heralded.
p304
aVIt's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.
p305
aVBut now I want to actually also question that.
p306
aVBecause it is true that there was a decline in prevalence
p307
aVin Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.
p308
aVBut there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.
p309
aa(lp310
VThere was a big decline in coffee prices.
p311
aVCoffee is Uganda's major export.
p312
aVTheir exports went down a lot in the early 1990s \u2014 and actually that decline lines up
p313
aVreally, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.
p314
aVSo you can see that both of these series \u2014
p315
aVthe black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections \u2014
p316
aVyou can see they're both increasing.
p317
aVStarting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.
p318
aVAnd then actually they track each other
p319
aVa little bit on the increase later in the decade.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo if you combine the intuition in this figure
p322
aVwith some of the data that I talked about before,
p323
aVit suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent
p324
aVof the decline in prevalence in Uganda
p325
aVactually would have happened even without any education campaign.
p326
aa(lp327
VBut that's enormously important for policy.
p328
aVWe're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.
p329
aVAnd if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was,
p330
aVthen there are all sorts of other things
p331
aVmaybe we should be spending our money on instead.
p332
aVTrying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.
p333
aVTrying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.
p334
aVThere are tons of other things that we should think about doing.
p335
aVAnd maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.
p336
aa(lp337
VI hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS,
p338
aVand I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit
p339
aVsome of the things that you did know.
p340
aVAnd I hope that I've convinced you maybe
p341
aVthat it's important to understand things about the epidemic
p342
aVin order to think about policy.
p343
aa(lp344
VBut more than anything, you know, I'm an academic.
p345
aVAnd when I leave here, I'm going to go back
p346
aVand sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.
p347
aVAnd the thing that's most exciting about that
p348
aVis every time I think about research, there are more questions.
p349
aVThere are more things that I think that I want to do.
p350
aVAnd what's really, really great about being here
p351
aVis I'm sure that the questions that you guys have
p352
aVare very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.
p353
aVAnd I can't wait to hear about what they are.
p354
aVSo thank you very much.

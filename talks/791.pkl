VOK. We've heard a lot of people
p5
aVspeak at this conference
p6
aVabout the power of the human mind.
p7
aVAnd what I'd like to do today
p8
aVis give you a vivid example
p9
aVof how that power can be unleashed
p10
aVwhen someone is in a survival situation,
p11
aVhow the will to survive can bring that out in people.
p12
aVThis is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest;
p13
aVit was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.
p14
aVAnd when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.
p15
aVSo I'll take you through that
p16
aVand we'll see what it's like
p17
aVwhen someone really
p18
aVsummons the will to survive.
p19
aa(lp20
VOK, this is Mount Everest.
p21
aVIt's 29,035 feet high.
p22
aVI've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic,
p23
aVmaking tectonic plate measurements;
p24
aVtwice, I went with NASA
p25
aVdoing remote sensing devices.
p26
aVIt was on my fourth trip to Everest
p27
aVthat a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.
p28
aVAnd the Sherpas told us then
p29
aVthat was a very bad omen,
p30
aVand we should have listened to them.
p31
aVEverest is an extreme environment.
p32
aVThere's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.
p33
aVNear the summit, temperatures
p34
aVcan be 40 degrees below zero.
p35
aVYou can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.
p36
aVIt's actually a wind-chill factor
p37
aVwhich is lower than a summer day on Mars.
p38
aVI remember one time being up near the summit,
p39
aVI reached into my down jacket
p40
aVfor a drink from my water bottle,
p41
aVinside my down jacket,
p42
aVonly to discover that the water was already frozen solid.
p43
aVThat gives you an idea of just how severe
p44
aVthings are near the summit.
p45
aa(lp46
VOK, this is the route up Everest.
p47
aVIt starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.
p48
aVCamp One, 2,000 feet higher.
p49
aVCamp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up,
p50
aVwhat's called the Western Cwm.
p51
aVCampThree is at the base of Lhotse,
p52
aVwhich is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.
p53
aVAnd then Camp Four is the highest camp;
p54
aVthat's 3,000 feet short of the summit.
p55
aVThis is a view of base camp.
p56
aVThis is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.
p57
aVIt's the highest point you can bring your yaks
p58
aVbefore you have to unload.
p59
aVAnd this is what they unloaded for me:
p60
aVI had four yak loads of medical supplies,
p61
aVwhich are dumped in a tent,
p62
aVand here I am trying to arrange things.
p63
aa(lp64
VThis was our expedition.
p65
aVIt was a National Geographic expedition,
p66
aVbut it was organized by The Explorers Club.
p67
aVThere were three other expeditions on the mountain,
p68
aVan American team, a New Zealand team
p69
aVand an IMAX team.
p70
aVAnd, after actually two months of preparation,
p71
aVwe built our camps all the way up the mountain.
p72
aa(lp73
VThis is a view looking up the icefall,
p74
aVthe first 2,000 feet of the climb
p75
aVup from base camp.
p76
aVAnd here's a picture in the icefall;
p77
aVit's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly,
p78
aVand it actually changes every day.
p79
aVWhen you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze;
p80
aVyou can't even see over the top.
p81
aVThis is near the top of the icefall.
p82
aVYou want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.
p83
aVThat way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.
p84
aVThese are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.
p85
aVThis is me crossing a crevasse.
p86
aVWe cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.
p87
aVThat's another crevasse.
p88
aVSome of these things are 10 stories deep or more,
p89
aVand one of my climbing friends says that
p90
aVthe reason we actually climb at night
p91
aVis because if we ever saw the bottom
p92
aVof what we're climbing over,
p93
aVwe would never do it.
p94
aa(lp95
VOkay. This is Camp One.
p96
aVIt's the first flat spot you can reach
p97
aVafter you get up to the top of the icefall.
p98
aVAnd from there we climb up to Camp Two,
p99
aVwhich is sort of the foreground.
p100
aVThese are climbers moving up the Lhotse face,
p101
aVthat mountain toward Camp Three.
p102
aVThey're on fixed ropes here.
p103
aVA fall here, if you weren't roped in,
p104
aVwould be 5,000 feet down.
p105
aVThis is a view taken from camp three.
p106
aVYou can see the Lhotse face is in profile,
p107
aVit's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it,
p108
aVso you put the camp halfway through.
p109
aa(lp110
VIf you notice, the summit of Everest is black.
p111
aVThere's no ice over it.
p112
aVAnd that's because Everest is so high,
p113
aVit's in the jet stream,
p114
aVand winds are constantly scouring the face,
p115
aVso no snow gets to accumulate.
p116
aVWhat looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge
p117
aVis actually snow being blown off the summit.
p118
aa(lp119
VThis is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four,
p120
aVmoving in, up through the clouds.
p121
aVAnd this is at Camp Four.
p122
aVOnce you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours
p123
aVto decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.
p124
aVEverybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited,
p125
aVand you either have to go up or go down,
p126
aVmake that decision very quickly.
p127
aVThis is a picture of Rob Hall.
p128
aVHe was the leader of the New Zealand team.
p129
aVThis is a radio he used later to call his wife
p130
aVthat I'll tell you about.
p131
aVThese are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.
p132
aVThey're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.
p133
aVThis is not good weather to climb in,
p134
aVso the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.
p135
aVAnd, in fact, the wind does die down at night.
p136
aVIt becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.
p137
aVThis looks like a good chance to go for the summit.
p138
aVSo here are some climbers starting out for the summit
p139
aVon what's called the Triangular Face.
p140
aVIt's the first part of climb.
p141
aVIt's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next,
p142
aVand you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo that's what happened.
p145
aVThe climbers got on the southeast ridge.
p146
aVThis is the view looking at the southeast ridge.
p147
aVThe summit would be in the foreground.
p148
aVFrom here, it's about 1,500 feet
p149
aVup at a 30-degree angle to the summit.
p150
aVBut what happened that year was
p151
aVthe wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.
p152
aVA storm blew in that no one was anticipating.
p153
aVYou can see here some ferocious winds
p154
aVblowing snow way high off the summit.
p155
aVAnd there were climbers on that summit ridge.
p156
aa(lp157
VThis is a picture of me in that area
p158
aVtaken a year before,
p159
aVand you can see I've got an oxygen mask on
p160
aVwith a rebreather.
p161
aVI have an oxygen hose connected here.
p162
aVYou can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack \u2014
p163
aVlittle titanium tanks, very lightweight \u2014
p164
aVand we're not carrying much else.
p165
aVThis is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.
p166
aa(lp167
VOK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.
p168
aVThis is on the way toward the summit,
p169
aVon that 1,500-foot bridge.
p170
aVAll the climbers here are climbing unroped,
p171
aVand the reason is because
p172
aVthe drop off is so sheer on either side
p173
aVthat if you were roped to somebody,
p174
aVyou'd wind up just pulling them off with you.
p175
aVSo each person climbs individually.
p176
aVAnd it's not a straight path at all,
p177
aVit's very difficult climbing,
p178
aVand there's always the risk
p179
aVof falling on either side.
p180
aVIf you fall to your left, you're going to fall
p181
aV8,000 feet into Nepal;
p182
aVif you fall to your right,
p183
aVyou're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.
p184
aVSo it's probably better to fall into Tibet
p185
aVbecause you'll live longer.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVBut, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.
p188
aa(lp189
VOK. Those climbers were up near the summit,
p190
aValong that summit ridge that you see up there,
p191
aVand I was down here in Camp Three.
p192
aVMy expedition was down in Camp Three,
p193
aVwhile these guys were up there in the storm.
p194
aVThe storm was so fierce that we had to lay,
p195
aVfully dressed, fully equipped,
p196
aVlaid out on the tent floor
p197
aVto stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.
p198
aVIt was the worst winds I've ever seen.
p199
aVAnd the climbers up on the ridge
p200
aVwere that much higher, 2,000 feet higher,
p201
aVand completely exposed to the elements.
p202
aVWe were in radio contact with some of them.
p203
aa(lp204
VThis is a view taken along the summit ridge.
p205
aVRob Hall, we heard by radio,
p206
aVwas up here, at this point in the storm
p207
aVwith Doug Hansen.
p208
aVAnd we heard that Rob was OK,
p209
aVbut Doug was too weak to come down.
p210
aVHe was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.
p211
aVWe also got some bad news in the storm
p212
aVthat Beck Weathers, another climber,
p213
aVhad collapsed in the snow and was dead.
p214
aVThere were still 18 other climbers
p215
aVthat we weren't aware of their condition.
p216
aVThey were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain;
p217
aVall the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.
p218
aVWe really had no idea what was going on during that storm.
p219
aVWe were just hunkered down
p220
aVin our tents at Camp Three.
p221
aa(lp222
VOur two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans,
p223
aVdecided to go up to try to rescue who they could
p224
aVeven though there was a ferocious storm going.
p225
aVThey tried to radio a message to Rob Hall,
p226
aVwho was a superb climber
p227
aVstuck, sort of, with a weak climber
p228
aVup near the summit.
p229
aVI expected them to say to Rob,
p230
aV"Hold on. We're coming."
p231
aVBut in fact, what they said was,
p232
aV"Leave Doug and come down yourself.
p233
aVThere's no chance of saving him,
p234
aVand just try to save yourself at this point."
p235
aVAnd Rob got that message,
p236
aVbut his answer was,
p237
aV"We're both listening."
p238
aVTodd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here,
p239
aVand it was a scene of complete chaos up there.
p240
aVBut they did what they could to stabilize the people.
p241
aVI gave them radio advice from Camp Three,
p242
aVand we sent down the climbers that could make it down
p243
aVunder their own power.
p244
aVThe ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.
p245
aVSo the climbers were coming down along this route.
p246
aa(lp247
VThis is taken from Camp Three, where I was.
p248
aVAnd they all came by me
p249
aVso I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them,
p250
aVwhich is really not much, because Camp Three
p251
aVis a little notch cut in the ice
p252
aVin the middle of a 45-degree angle.
p253
aVYou can barely stand outside the tent.
p254
aVIt's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.
p255
aVThe only supplies I had at that altitude
p256
aVwere two plastic bags
p257
aVwith preloaded syringes
p258
aVof painkiller and steroids.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo, as the climbers came by me,
p261
aVI sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition
p262
aVto continue on further down.
p263
aVThe ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated,
p264
aVI would give an injection of steroids
p265
aVto try to give them some period
p266
aVof lucidity and coordination
p267
aVwhere they could then work their way further down the mountain.
p268
aVIt's so awkward to work up there that sometimes
p269
aVI even gave the injections right through their clothes.
p270
aVIt was just too hard to maneuver
p271
aVany other way up there.
p272
aa(lp273
VWhile I was taking care of them,
p274
aVwe got more news about Rob Hall.
p275
aVThere was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.
p276
aVHe called in to say that he was alone now.
p277
aVApparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.
p278
aVBut Rob was now too weak to come down himself,
p279
aVand with the fierce winds and up at that altitude,
p280
aVhe was just beyond rescue
p281
aVand he knew it.
p282
aVAt that point, he asked
p283
aVto be paged into his wife.
p284
aVHe was carrying a radio.
p285
aVHis wife was home in New Zealand,
p286
aVseven months pregnant with their first child,
p287
aVand Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done,
p288
aVand Rob and his wife
p289
aVhad their last conversation.
p290
aVThey picked the name for their baby.
p291
aVRob then signed off,
p292
aVand that was the last we ever heard of him.
p293
aa(lp294
VI was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients
p295
aVat 24,000 feet,
p296
aVwhich was an impossibility.
p297
aVSo what we did was, we got the victims
p298
aVdown to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.
p299
aVThis was my medical kit.
p300
aVIt's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.
p301
aVThis is what I carried up the mountain.
p302
aVI had more supplies lower down,
p303
aVwhich I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.
p304
aVAnd this was scene at the lower camp.
p305
aa(lp306
VThe survivors came in one by one.
p307
aVSome of them were hypothermic,
p308
aVsome of them were frostbitten, some were both.
p309
aVWhat we did was try to warm them up as best we could,
p310
aVput oxygen on them and try to revive them,
p311
aVwhich is difficult to do at 21,000 feet,
p312
aVwhen the tent is freezing.
p313
aVThis is some severe frostbite on the feet,
p314
aVsevere frostbite on the nose.
p315
aVThis climber was snow blind.
p316
aa(lp317
VAs I was taking care of these climbers,
p318
aVwe got a startling experience.
p319
aVOut of nowhere, Beck Weathers,
p320
aVwho we had already been told was dead,
p321
aVstumbled into the tent,
p322
aVjust like a mummy, he walked into the tent.
p323
aVI expected him to be incoherent,
p324
aVbut, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me,
p325
aV"Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?"
p326
aVAnd then he said,
p327
aV"Do you accept my health insurance?"
p328
aV(Laughter)
p329
aVHe really said that.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aVSo he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.
p332
aVYou can see his hand is completely white;
p333
aVhis face, his nose, is burned.
p334
aVFirst, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis,
p335
aVit turns black, and then it falls off.
p336
aVIt's the last stage, just like a scar.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo, as I was taking care of Beck,
p339
aVhe related what had been going on up there.
p340
aVHe said he had gotten lost in the storm,
p341
aVcollapsed in the snow,
p342
aVand just laid there, unable to move.
p343
aVSome climbers had come by and looked at him,
p344
aVand he heard them say, "He's dead."
p345
aVBut Beck wasn't dead; he heard that,
p346
aVbut he was completely unable to move.
p347
aVHe was in some sort of catatonic state
p348
aVwhere he could be aware of his surroundings,
p349
aVbut couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.
p350
aVSo the climbers passed him by,
p351
aVand Beck lay there for a day, a night
p352
aVand another day,
p353
aVin the snow.
p354
aVAnd then he said to himself,
p355
aV"I don't want to die.
p356
aVI have a family to come back to."
p357
aVAnd the thoughts of his family,
p358
aVhis kids and his wife,
p359
aVgenerated enough energy,
p360
aVenough motivation in him,
p361
aVso that he actually got up.
p362
aVAfter laying in the snow that long a time,
p363
aVhe got up and found his way back to the camp.
p364
aVAnd Beck told me that story very quietly,
p365
aVbut I was absolutely stunned by it.
p366
aVI couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow
p367
aVthat long a time
p368
aVand then getting up.
p369
aVHe apparently reversed
p370
aVan irreversible hypothermia.
p371
aVAnd I can only try to speculate
p372
aVon how he did it.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo, what if we had Beck
p375
aVhooked up to a SPECT scan,
p376
aVsomething that could actually measure brain function?
p377
aVJust very simply, the three parts of the brain:
p378
aVthe frontal lobe, where you focus
p379
aVyour attention and concentration;
p380
aVyou have the temporal lobe,
p381
aVwhere you form images and keep memories;
p382
aVand the posterior part of your brain,
p383
aVwhich contains the cerebellum, which controls motion;
p384
aVand the brain stem,
p385
aVwhere you have your basic maintenance functions,
p386
aVlike heartbeat and respiration.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo let's take a cut through the brain here,
p389
aVand imagine that Beck
p390
aVwas hooked up to a SPECT scan.
p391
aVThis measures dynamic blood flow
p392
aVand therefore energy flow within the brain.
p393
aVSo you have the prefrontal cortex here,
p394
aVlighting up in red.
p395
aVThis is a pretty evenly distributed scan.
p396
aVYou have the middle area,
p397
aVwhere the temporal lobe might be, in here,
p398
aVand the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.
p399
aa(lp400
VThis is a roughly normal scan,
p401
aVshowing equal distribution of energy.
p402
aVNow, you go to this one and you see how much more
p403
aVthe frontal lobes are lighting up.
p404
aVThis might be what Beck would be experiencing
p405
aVwhen he realizes he's in danger.
p406
aVHe's focusing all his attention
p407
aVon getting himself out of trouble.
p408
aVThese parts of the brain are quieting down.
p409
aVHe's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point,
p410
aVand he's working pretty hard.
p411
aVHe's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.
p412
aVOK, but he's losing ground here.
p413
aVHe's running out of energy.
p414
aVIt's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going,
p415
aVand, you see, there's no more red here;
p416
aVhis brain is quieting down.
p417
aVHe's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet,
p418
aVthere's very little red anywhere.
p419
aVBeck is powering down.
p420
aVHe's dying.
p421
aa(lp422
VYou go on to the next scan,
p423
aVbut, in Beck's case,
p424
aVyou can see that the middle part of his brain
p425
aVis beginning to light up again.
p426
aVHe's beginning to think about his family.
p427
aVHe's beginning to have images
p428
aVthat are motivating him to get up.
p429
aVHe's developing energy in this area
p430
aVthrough thought.
p431
aVAnd this is how he's going to turn thought
p432
aVback into action.
p433
aVThis part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.
p434
aVIt's an area in which
p435
aVa lot of neuroscientists believe
p436
aVthe seat of will exists.
p437
aVThis is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.
p438
aVAnd, you can see, there's an energy flow
p439
aVgoing from the mid portion of his brain,
p440
aVwhere he's got images of his family,
p441
aVinto this area, which is powering his will.
p442
aa(lp443
VOkay. This is getting stronger and stronger
p444
aVto the point where it's actually
p445
aVgoing to be a motivating factor.
p446
aVHe's going to develop enough energy in that area \u2014
p447
aVafter a day, a night and a day \u2014
p448
aVto actually motivate himself to get up.
p449
aVAnd you can see here,
p450
aVhe's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.
p451
aVHe's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.
p452
aVHe's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.
p453
aVSo this energy has been transmitted
p454
aVup toward the front of his brain,
p455
aVand it's getting quieter down here,
p456
aVbut he's using this energy
p457
aVto think about what he has to do to get himself going.
p458
aVAnd then, that energy is sort of spreading
p459
aVthroughout his thought areas.
p460
aVHe's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.
p461
aVThis is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving,
p462
aVand he's going to be pacing himself.
p463
aVHis heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.
p464
aVSo this is what I can speculate might have been going on
p465
aVhad we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck
p466
aVduring this survival epic.
p467
aa(lp468
VSo here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet,
p469
aVand I felt what I was doing was completely trivial
p470
aVcompared to what he had done for himself.
p471
aVIt just shows you what the power of the mind can do.
p472
aVHe was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients;
p473
aVluckily, we were able to get a helicopter
p474
aVin to rescue these guys.
p475
aVA helicopter came in at 21,000 feet
p476
aVand carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.
p477
aVIt was able to land on the ice, take away Beck
p478
aVand the other survivors, one by one,
p479
aVand get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic
p480
aVbefore we even got back to base camp.
p481
aa(lp482
VThis is a scene at base camp,
p483
aVat one of the camps
p484
aVwhere some of the climbers were lost.
p485
aVAnd we had a memorial service there
p486
aVa few days later.
p487
aVThese are Serphas lighting juniper branches.
p488
aVThey believe juniper smoke is holy.
p489
aVAnd the climbers stood around on the high rocks
p490
aVand spoke of the climbers who were lost
p491
aVup near the summit,
p492
aVturning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.
p493
aVThere were five climbers lost here.
p494
aVThis was Scott Fischer,
p495
aVRob Hall,
p496
aVAndy Harris,
p497
aVDoug Hansen
p498
aVand Yasuko Namba.
p499
aVAnd one more climber
p500
aVshould have died that day, but didn't,
p501
aVand that's Beck Weathers.
p502
aVHe was able to survive
p503
aVbecause he was able to generate that incredible willpower,
p504
aVhe was able to use all the power of his mind
p505
aVto save himself.
p506
aa(lp507
VThese are Tibetan prayer flags.
p508
aVThese Sherpas believe that
p509
aVif you write prayers on these flags,
p510
aVthe message will be carried up to the gods,
p511
aVand that year, Beck's message was answered.
p512
aa(lp513
VThank you.

VBy 2010, Detroit had become the poster child
p5
aVfor an American city in crisis.
p6
aVThere was a housing collapse,
p7
aVan auto industry collapse,
p8
aVand the population had plummeted by 25 percent
p9
aVbetween 2000 and 2010,
p10
aVand many people were beginning to write it off,
p11
aVas it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.
p12
aVBy 2010, I had also been asked by
p13
aVthe Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit
p14
aVto join them in leading a citywide planning process
p15
aVfor the city to create a shared vision for its future.
p16
aVI come to this work
p17
aVas an architect and an urban planner,
p18
aVand I've spent my career working in other contested cities,
p19
aVlike Chicago, my hometown;
p20
aVHarlem, which is my current home;
p21
aVWashington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey.
p22
aVAll of these cities, to me, still had a number
p23
aVof unresolved issues related to urban justice,
p24
aVissues of equity, inclusion and access.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow by 2010, as well,
p27
aVpopular design magazines were also beginning
p28
aVto take a closer look at cities like Detroit,
p29
aVand devoting whole issues to "fixing the city."
p30
aVI was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,
p31
aVto do an interview for the October issue
p32
aVof Architect magazine,
p33
aVand he and I kind of had a good chuckle
p34
aVwhen we saw the magazine released with the title,
p35
aV"Can This Planner Save Detroit?"
p36
aVSo I'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now,
p37
aVbecause obviously, it's completely absurd
p38
aVthat a single person, let alone a planner,
p39
aVcould save a city.
p40
aVBut I'm also smiling because I thought it represented
p41
aVa sense of hopefulness that our profession
p42
aVcould play a role in helping the city to think about
p43
aVhow it would recover from its severe crisis.
p44
aVSo I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon
p45
aVand tell you a little bit about our process
p46
aVfor fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,
p47
aVand I want to do that through the voices of Detroiters.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo we began our process in September of 2010.
p50
aVIt's just after a special mayoral election,
p51
aVand word has gotten out that there is going to be
p52
aVthis citywide planning process,
p53
aVwhich brings a lot of anxiety and fears
p54
aVamong Detroiters.
p55
aVWe had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this
p56
aVto introduce the planning process,
p57
aVand people came out from all over the city,
p58
aVincluding areas that were stable neighborhoods,
p59
aVas well as areas that were beginning to see
p60
aVa lot of vacancy.
p61
aVAnd most of our audience was representative
p62
aVof the 82 percent African-American population
p63
aVin the city at that time.
p64
aVSo obviously, we have a Q&A portion of our program,
p65
aVand people line up to mics to ask questions.
p66
aVMany of them step very firmly to the mic,
p67
aVput their hands across their chest, and go,
p68
aV"I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?"
p69
aa(lp70
VSo that question is really powerful,
p71
aVand it was certainly powerful to us in the moment,
p72
aVwhen you connect it to the stories
p73
aVthat some Detroiters had,
p74
aVand actually a lot of African-Americans'
p75
aVfamilies have had
p76
aVthat are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.
p77
aVMany of them told us the stories about
p78
aVhow they came to own their home
p79
aVthrough their grandparents or great-grandparents,
p80
aVwho were one of 1.6 million people who migrated
p81
aVfrom the rural South to the industrial North,
p82
aVas depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence,
p83
aV"The Great Migration."
p84
aVThey came to Detroit for a better way of life.
p85
aVMany found work in the automobile industry,
p86
aVthe Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural
p87
aVby Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.
p88
aVThe fruits of their labors would afford them a home,
p89
aVfor many the first piece of property that they would ever know,
p90
aVand a community with other first-time
p91
aVAfrican-American home buyers.
p92
aVThe first couple of decades of their life in the North
p93
aVis quite well, up until about 1950,
p94
aVwhich coincides with the city's peak population
p95
aVat 1.8 million people.
p96
aVNow it's at this time that Detroit begins to see
p97
aVa second kind of migration,
p98
aVa migration to the suburbs.
p99
aVBetween 1950 and 2000,
p100
aVthe region grows by 30 percent.
p101
aVBut this time, the migration leaves
p102
aVAfrican-Americans in place,
p103
aVas families and businesses flee the city,
p104
aVleaving the city pretty desolate of people
p105
aVas well as jobs.
p106
aVDuring that same period, between 1950 and 2000, 2010,
p107
aVthe city loses 60 percent of its population,
p108
aVand today it hovers at above 700,000.
p109
aa(lp110
VThe audience members who come and talk to us that night
p111
aVtell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city
p112
aVwith such depleted population.
p113
aVMany tell us that they're one of only a few homes
p114
aVon their block that are occupied,
p115
aVand that they can see several abandoned homes
p116
aVfrom where they sit on their porches.
p117
aVCitywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.
p118
aVThey can also see vacant property.
p119
aVThey're beginning to see illegal activities
p120
aVon these properties, like illegal dumping,
p121
aVand they know that because the city has lost so much population,
p122
aVtheir costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,
p123
aVbecause there are not enough people to pay property taxes
p124
aVto help support the services that they need.
p125
aVCitywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,
p128
aVbecause I know that sounds like a big number,
p129
aVbut I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map.
p130
aVSo the city is 139 square miles.
p131
aVYou can fit Boston, San Francisco,
p132
aVand the island of Manhattan
p133
aVwithin its footprint.
p134
aVSo if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property
p135
aVand we smush it together,
p136
aVit looks like about 20 square miles,
p137
aVand that's roughly equivalent to the size
p138
aVof the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,
p139
aVat 22 square miles.
p140
aVSo it's a lot of vacancy.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow some of our audience members
p143
aValso tell us about some of the positive things
p144
aVthat are happening in their communities,
p145
aVand many of them are banding together
p146
aVto take control of some of the vacant lots,
p147
aVand they're starting community gardens,
p148
aVwhich are creating a great sense of community stewardship,
p149
aVbut they're very, very clear to tell us
p150
aVthat this is not enough,
p151
aVthat they want to see their neighborhoods
p152
aVreturn to the way that their grandparents had found them.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow there's been a lot of speculation since 2010
p155
aVabout what to do with the vacant property,
p156
aVand a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening,
p157
aVor what we call urban agriculture.
p158
aVSo many people would say to us,
p159
aV"What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland?
p160
aVIt can provide fresh foods,
p161
aVand it can put Detroiters back to work too."
p162
aVWhen I hear that story,
p163
aVI always imagine the folks from the Great Migration
p164
aVrolling over in their graves,
p165
aVbecause you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice
p166
aVmoving from the South to the North
p167
aVto create a better life for their families,
p168
aVonly to see their great-grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle,
p169
aVespecially in a city where they came
p170
aVwith little less than a high school education
p171
aVor even a grammar school education
p172
aVand were able to afford the basic elements
p173
aVof the American dream:
p174
aVsteady work and a home that they owned.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow, there's a third wave of migration
p177
aVhappening in Detroit:
p178
aVa new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs.
p179
aVThese folks see that same vacant land
p180
aVand those same abandoned homes
p181
aVas opportunity for new,
p182
aVentrepreneurial ideas and profit,
p183
aVso much so that former models
p184
aVcan move to Detroit,
p185
aVbuy property, start successful
p186
aVbusinesses and restaurants,
p187
aVand become successful community activists in their neighborhood,
p188
aVbringing about very positive change.
p189
aVSimilarly, we have small manufacturing companies
p190
aVmaking conscious decisions to relocate to the city.
p191
aVThis company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch
p192
aVand bicycle company,
p193
aVdeliberately chose to relocate to Detroit,
p194
aVand they quote themselves by saying
p195
aVthey were drawn to the global brand  of Detroit's innovation.
p196
aVAnd they also knew that  they can tap into a workforce
p197
aVthat was still very skilled in how to make things.
p198
aVNow we have community stewardship
p199
aVhappening in neighborhoods,
p200
aVwe have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions
p201
aVto move to the city and create enterprises,
p202
aVand we have businesses relocating,
p203
aVand this is all in the context
p204
aVof what is no secret to us all,
p205
aVa city that's under the control
p206
aVof an emergency manager,
p207
aVand just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo 2010, we started this process, and by 2013,
p210
aVwe released Detroit Future City,
p211
aVwhich was our strategic plan to guide the city
p212
aVinto a better and more prosperous
p213
aVand more sustainable existence \u2014
p214
aVnot what it was, but what it could be,
p215
aVlooking at new ways of economic growth,
p216
aVnew forms of land use,
p217
aVmore sustainable and denser neighborhoods,
p218
aVa reconfigured infrastructure and city service system,
p219
aVand a heightened capacity for civic leaders
p220
aVto take action and implement change.
p221
aVThree key imperatives were really important
p222
aVto our work.
p223
aVOne was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large,
p224
aVbut the economy was too small.
p225
aVThere are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit,
p226
aVvery different from a Denver or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia
p227
aVthat are anywhere between  35 to 70 jobs per 100 people.
p228
aVSecondly, there had to be an acceptance
p229
aVthat we were not going to be able to use
p230
aVall of this vacant land in the way that we had before
p231
aVand maybe for some time to come.
p232
aVIt wasn't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods
p233
aVas we had before,
p234
aVand urban agriculture, while a very productive
p235
aVand successful intervention happening in Detroit,
p236
aVwas not the only answer,
p237
aVthat what we had to do is look at these areas
p238
aVwhere we had significant vacancy
p239
aVbut still had a significant number of population
p240
aVof what could be new, productive, innovative,
p241
aVand entrepreneurial uses
p242
aVthat could stabilize those communities,
p243
aVwhere still nearly 300,000 residents lived.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo we came up with one neighborhood typology \u2014
p246
aVthere are several \u2014 called a live-make neighborhood,
p247
aVwhere folks could reappropriate
p248
aVabandoned structures
p249
aVand turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises,
p250
aVwith a specific emphasis on looking at the, again,
p251
aVmajority 82 percent African-American population.
p252
aVSo they, too, could take businesses
p253
aVthat they maybe were doing out of their home
p254
aVand grow them to more prosperous industries
p255
aVand actually acquire property so they were actually
p256
aVproperty owners as well as business owners
p257
aVin the communities with which they resided.
p258
aVThen we also wanted to look at other ways
p259
aVof using land in addition to growing food
p260
aVand transforming landscape into
p261
aVmuch more productive uses,
p262
aVso that it could be used for storm water management, for example,
p263
aVby using surface lakes and retention ponds,
p264
aVthat created neighborhood amenities,
p265
aVplaces of recreation,
p266
aVand actually helped to elevate
p267
aVadjacent property levels.
p268
aVOr we could use it as research plots,
p269
aVwhere we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,
p270
aVor we could use it to generate energy.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo the descendants of the Great Migration
p273
aVcould either become precision watchmakers at Shinola,
p274
aVlike Willie H., who was featured in one of their ads last year,
p275
aVor they can actually grow a business
p276
aVthat would service companies like Shinola.
p277
aVThe good news is, there is a future
p278
aVfor the next generation of Detroiters,
p279
aVboth those there now and those that want to come.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo no thank you, Mayor Menino,
p282
aVwho recently was quoted as saying,
p283
aV"I'd blow up the place and start over."
p284
aVThere are very important people,
p285
aVbusiness and land assets in Detroit,
p286
aVand there are real opportunities there.
p287
aVSo while Detroit might not be what it was,
p288
aVDetroit will not die.
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you.

VTwelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.
p5
aVZipcar buys cars and parks them
p6
aVthroughout dense metropolitan areas
p7
aVfor people to use, by the hour and by the day,
p8
aVinstead of owning their own cars.
p9
aVEach Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars,
p10
aVand each driver drives about 80 percent less
p11
aVbecause they're now paying the full cost,
p12
aVall at once, in real time.
p13
aVBut what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit,
p16
aVand so a couple years ago I moved to Paris
p17
aVwith my husband and youngest child,
p18
aVand we launched Buzzcar a year ago.
p19
aVBuzzcar lets people rent out their own cars
p20
aVto their friends and neighbors.
p21
aVInstead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.
p22
aVWe bring the power of a corporation
p23
aVto individuals who add their cars to the network.
p24
aVSome people call this peer-to-peer.
p25
aVThis does express the humanity of what's going on,
p26
aVand the personal relationships,
p27
aVbut that is also like saying that it's the same thing
p28
aVas a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.
p29
aVThat's peer-to-peer.
p30
aVIt's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay,
p31
aVor craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut what's really happening is that we've got the power
p34
aVof a free and open Internet,
p35
aVand on top of that we're putting a platform for participation,
p36
aVand the peers are now in partnership with the company,
p37
aVcreating shared value on shared values,
p38
aVand each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.
p39
aVI call this Peers, Inc.
p40
aVThe incorporated side, the company,
p41
aVis doing things that it does really well.
p42
aVWhat does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,
p43
aVsignificant and long-term resource investment,
p44
aVthe expertise of many different kinds of people
p45
aVand different kinds of minds, and for individuals,
p46
aVconsumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse
p47
aVthat we really want as consumers,
p48
aVand this is kind of bound up in a brand promise,
p49
aVand the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.
p50
aVPeers are giving and doing things
p51
aVthat are incredibly expensive for companies to do.
p52
aVWhat do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity,
p53
aVexpensive for companies. And what does that deliver?
p54
aVIt delivers localization and customization,
p55
aVspecialization, and all of this aspect about social networks
p56
aVand how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?
p57
aVIt's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.
p58
aVAnd it also delivers really fabulous innovation,
p59
aVand I'll talk about that later.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo we have the peers that are providing the services and the product,
p62
aVand the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.
p63
aVThe two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.
p64
aVSome of my favorite examples:
p65
aVin transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old,
p66
aVthree and a half million people have joined up,
p67
aVand a million rides are shared every day.
p68
aVIt's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent
p69
aVof 2,500 TGV trains,
p70
aVand just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.
p71
aVThis is all happening with excess capacity.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd it's not just with transportation, my love,
p74
aVbut of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com.
p75
aVI met these founders just weeks after they had launched,
p76
aVand now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?
p77
aVSeven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years,
p78
aVwhat people would do for five dollars.
p79
aVAnd not just easy things that anyone can do.
p80
aVThis Peers, Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm.
p81
aVTopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering
p82
aVcomplex design and engineering services.
p83
aVWhen I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.
p84
aVHe said, "We have a community that owns its own company."
p85
aVAnd then my all-time favorite, Etsy.
p86
aVEtsy is providing goods that people make themselves
p87
aVand they're selling it in a marketplace.
p88
aVIt just celebrated its seventh anniversary,
p89
aVand after seven years, last year it delivered
p90
aV530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals
p91
aVwho have been making those objects.
p92
aa(lp93
VI know you guys out there who are businesspeople,
p94
aVare thinking, "Oh my God, I want to build one of those.
p95
aVI see this incredible speed and scale.
p96
aVYou mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going
p97
aVto put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in?"
p98
aVBuilding these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do.
p99
aVI think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube.
p100
aVWho would have thought that two young guys and a start-up
p101
aVwould beat out Google Video? Why?
p102
aVI actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them.
p103
aVBut I'm thinking, you know, they probably had
p104
aVthe "share" button a little bit brighter and to the right,
p105
aVand so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides
p106
aVthat are always participating on these networks.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now,
p109
aVand a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spent
p110
aVthe last two years doing that in Paris.
p111
aVSo let me take you back how it's so incredibly different
p112
aVbuilding Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar,
p113
aVbecause now every single thing we do has these two
p114
aVdifferent bodies that I have to be thinking about:
p115
aVthe owners who are going to provide the cars
p116
aVand the drivers who are going to rent them.
p117
aVEvery single decision, I have to think about what is right for both sides.
p118
aVThere are many, many examples and I'll give you one
p119
aVthat is not my favorite example: insurance.
p120
aVIt took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right.
p121
aVHours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies
p122
aVand their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative,
p123
aVthey'd never thought of it before.
p124
aVWay too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers,
p125
aVtrying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom,
p126
aVand the result was that we were able to provide owners
p127
aVprotection for their own driving records and their own history.
p128
aVThe cars are completely insured during the rental,
p129
aVand it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?
p130
aVThey need a low deductible,
p131
aVand 24-hour roadside assistance.
p132
aVSo this was a trick to get these two sides.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo now I want to take you to the moment of \u2014
p135
aVWhen you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company,
p136
aVthere's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand,
p137
aVand then the service launches. What happens?
p138
aVSo all those months of work, they come into play.
p139
aa(lp140
VLast June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment.
p141
aVAnd all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting.
p142
aVAll the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent.
p143
aVThe reservations start coming in, and here,
p144
aVowners who were getting text messages and emails
p145
aVthat said, "Hey, Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend.
p146
aVYou can earn 60 euros. Isn't that great? Yes or no?"
p147
aVNo reply. Like, a huge proportion of them
p148
aVcouldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.
p149
aVSo I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference between
p150
aVindustrial production and peer production."
p151
aVIndustrial production, the whole point of industrial production
p152
aVis to provide a standardized, exact service model
p153
aVthat is consistent every single time,
p154
aVand I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made
p155
aVusing industrial production.
p156
aVAnd Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent service
p157
aVthat works fabulously.
p158
aVBut what does peer production do? Peer production
p159
aVis this completely different way of doing things,
p160
aVand you have a big quality range, and so eBay, cleverly,
p161
aVthe first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say,
p162
aVthey figured out early on, we need to have ratings
p163
aVand commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.
p164
aVWe can flag that and we can put it to the side, and people
p165
aVwho are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo going back, this is my look of excitement and joy,
p168
aVbecause all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for
p169
aVactually really did happen, and what's that?
p170
aVThat is the diversity of what's going on.
p171
aVYou have these different fabulous owners
p172
aVand their different cars, different prices,
p173
aVdifferent locations. (Laughter)
p174
aVThey dress differently, and they look different,
p175
aVand, really, I love these photos every time I look at them.
p176
aVCool guys, excited guys,
p177
aVand here is Selma, who \u2014 I love this driver.
p178
aVAnd after a year, we have 1,000 cars
p179
aVthat are parked across France and 6,000 people
p180
aVwho are members and eager to drive them.
p181
aVThis would not be possible to do that in economic fashion
p182
aVfor a traditional company.
p183
aa(lp184
VBack to this spectrum.
p185
aVSo what's happening is, we had the yuck side,
p186
aVbut we actually had this real wow side.
p187
aVAnd I can tell you two great stories.
p188
aVA driver was telling me that they went to rent a car
p189
aVto go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them,
p190
aVand said, "You know what, here's where the cliffs are,
p191
aVand here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach,
p192
aVand this is where the best fish restaurant is."
p193
aVAnd the peers also become,
p194
aVpeers and owners create relationships,
p195
aVand so at the last minute people can \u2014
p196
aVa driver can say, "Hey, you know what, I really need the car,
p197
aVis it available?" And that person will say,
p198
aV"Sure, my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it."
p199
aVSo you can have these really nice things that can't happen,
p200
aVand it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!"
p201
aVtype of thing that's happening here, because individuals,
p202
aVif you're a company, what happens is you might have
p203
aV10 people who are in charge of innovation,
p204
aVor 100 people who are in charge of innovation.
p205
aVWhat happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have
p206
aVtens and hundreds and thousands and even millions
p207
aVof people who are creating experiments on this model,
p208
aVand so out of all that influence and that effort,
p209
aVyou are having this exceptional amount of innovation
p210
aVthat is coming out.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo one of the reasons, if we come back to why did I
p213
aVcall it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us
p214
aVabout the power of the hive,
p215
aVand its incredible facility to create this platform
p216
aVthat individuals want to participate and innovate on.
p217
aVAnd for me, when I think about our future,
p218
aVand all of those problems that seem incredibly large,
p219
aVthe scale is impossible, the urgency is there,
p220
aVPeers, Inc. provides the speed and scale
p221
aVand the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.
p222
aVAll we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation \u2014 nontrivial.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo I continue to think that
p225
aVtransportation is the center of the hard universe.
p226
aVAll problems come back to transportation for me.
p227
aVBut there are all these other areas that are these profound,
p228
aVbig problems that I know that we can work on,
p229
aVand people are working on them in many different sectors,
p230
aVbut there's this really fabulous group of things
p231
aVwith the power of this Peers, Inc. model.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo over the last decade, we've been reveling in
p234
aVthe power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals,
p235
aVand for me, what Peers, Inc. does
p236
aVis it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power
p237
aVof the company and the corporation
p238
aVand supercharging individuals.
p239
aVSo for me, it's a collaboration.
p240
aVTogether, we can. (Applause)
p241
aVThank you. (Applause)

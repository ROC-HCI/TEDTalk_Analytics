VOnce upon a time,
p5
aVat the age of 24,
p6
aVI was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore.
p7
aVI was a guest student during one month
p8
aVof a public health course.
p9
aVAnd that changed my mindset forever.
p10
aVThe course was good, but it was not the course content
p11
aVin itself that changed the mindset.
p12
aVIt was the brutal realization,
p13
aVthe first morning,
p14
aVthat the Indian students were better than me.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VYou see, I was a study nerd.
p19
aVI loved statistics from a young age.
p20
aVAnd I studied very much in Sweden.
p21
aVI used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended.
p22
aVBut in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter.
p23
aVAnd the fact was that Indian students
p24
aVstudied harder than we did in Sweden.
p25
aVThey read the textbook twice,
p26
aVor three times or four times.
p27
aVIn Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laugher)
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd that, to me,
p32
aVthat personal experience
p33
aVwas the first time in my life
p34
aVthat the mindset I grew up with
p35
aVwas changed.
p36
aVAnd I realized that perhaps
p37
aVthe Western world will not continue
p38
aVto dominate the world forever.
p39
aVAnd I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.
p40
aVIt's that realization of someone you meet
p41
aVthat really made you change your ideas about the world.
p42
aVIt's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd I will now,
p45
aVhere, onstage,
p46
aVtry to predict when that will happen \u2014
p47
aVthat Asia will regain
p48
aVits dominant position
p49
aVas the leading part of the world,
p50
aVas it used to be, over thousands of years.
p51
aVAnd I will do that
p52
aVby trying to predict precisely
p53
aVat what year
p54
aVthe average income per person
p55
aVin India, in China, will reach that of the West.
p56
aVAnd I don't mean the whole economy,
p57
aVbecause to grow an economy
p58
aVof India to the size of U.K. \u2014
p59
aVthat's a piece of cake, with one billion people.
p60
aVBut I want to see when will the average pay, the money
p61
aVfor each person, per month,
p62
aVin India and China,
p63
aVwhen will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?
p64
aa(lp65
VBut I will start with a historical background.
p66
aVAnd you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?
p67
aVI will start at 1858.
p68
aV1858 was a year of great technological
p69
aVadvancement in the West.
p70
aVThat was the year when Queen Victoria
p71
aVwas able, for the first time, to communicate
p72
aVwith President Buchanan,
p73
aVthrough the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.
p74
aVAnd they were the first to "Twitter" transatlantically.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aV(Applause)
p77
aVAnd I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,
p78
aVto find the text of the telegram
p79
aVsent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.
p80
aVAnd it ends like this: "This telegraph
p81
aVis a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,
p82
aVcivilization, liberty and law throughout the world."
p83
aa(lp84
VThose are nice words. But I got sort of curious
p85
aVof what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom.
p86
aVAnd we will think about that
p87
aVwhen we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858.
p88
aVBecause 1858
p89
aVwas also watershed year
p90
aVin the history of Asia.
p91
aV1858 was the year
p92
aVwhen the courageous uprising
p93
aVagainst the foreign occupation of India
p94
aVwas defeated by the British forces.
p95
aVAnd India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination.
p96
aa(lp97
V1858 in China
p98
aVwas the victory in the Opium War by the British forces.
p99
aVAnd that meant that foreigners, as it said in the treaty,
p100
aVwere allowed to trade freely in China.
p101
aVIt meant paying with opium for Chinese goods.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd 1858 in Japan
p104
aVwas the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty
p105
aVand accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.
p106
aVAnd they were threatened by those black ships there,
p107
aVthat had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year.
p108
aVBut, Japan, in contrast to India and China,
p109
aVmaintained its national sovereignty.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd let's see how much difference that can make.
p112
aVAnd I will do that by bringing these bubbles
p113
aVback to a Gapminder graph here,
p114
aVwhere you can see each bubble is a country.
p115
aVThe size of the bubble here is the population.
p116
aVOn this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar.
p117
aVAnd on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people.
p118
aVAnd I also bring an innovation here.
p119
aVI have transformed the laser beam
p120
aVinto an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Applause)
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd we will see, you know.
p125
aVLook here, 1858, India was here,
p126
aVChina was here, Japan was there,
p127
aVUnited States and United Kingdom
p128
aVwas richer over there.
p129
aVAnd I will start the world like this.
p130
aVIndia was not always like this level.
p131
aVActually if we go back into the historical record,
p132
aVthere was a time hundreds of years ago
p133
aVwhen the income per person in India and China
p134
aVwas even above that of Europe.
p135
aVBut 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination,
p136
aVand India had been de-industrialized.
p137
aVAnd you can see that the countries who were growing
p138
aVtheir economy was United States and United Kingdom.
p139
aVAnd they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy,
p140
aVand Japan was starting to catch up.
p141
aVIndia was trying down here.
p142
aVCan you see how it starts to move there?
p143
aVBut really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan.
p144
aVAnd Japan is trying to move up there.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd it's the new century now. Health is getting better,
p147
aVUnited Kingdom, United States.
p148
aVBut careful now \u2014 we are approaching the First World War.
p149
aVAnd the First World War, you know,
p150
aVwe'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.
p151
aVUnited Kingdom is going down.
p152
aVAnd now comes the Spanish flu also.
p153
aVAnd then after the First World War, they continue up.
p154
aVStill under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,
p155
aVIndia and China are down in the corner.
p156
aVNot much has happened.
p157
aVThey have grown their population but not much more.
p158
aVIn the 1930's now, you can see
p159
aVthat Japan is going to a period of war,
p160
aVwith lower life expectancy.
p161
aVAnd the Second World War was really a terrible event,
p162
aValso economically for Japan.
p163
aVBut they did recover quite fast afterwards.
p164
aVAnd we are moving into the new world.
p165
aVIn 1947 India finally
p166
aVgained its independence.
p167
aVAnd they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,
p168
aVbut in very big difficulties down there.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Applause)
p171
aa(lp172
VIn 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China
p173
aVin a way which surprised the world.
p174
aVAnd what happened?
p175
aVWhat happens in the after independence?
p176
aVYou can see that the health started to improve.
p177
aVChildren started to go to school.
p178
aVHealth services were provided.
p179
aVThis is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.
p180
aVIt was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.
p181
aVChina recovered. Then they said,
p182
aV"Nevermore, stupid central planning."
p183
aVBut they went up here, and India was trying to follow.
p184
aVAnd they were catching up indeed.
p185
aVAnd both countries had the better health, but still
p186
aVa very low economy.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died,
p189
aVand a new guy turned up from the left.
p190
aVAnd it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.
p191
aVAnd he said, "Doesn't matter
p192
aVif a cat is white or black,
p193
aVas long as it catches mice."
p194
aVBecause catching mice
p195
aVis what the two cats wanted to do.
p196
aVAnd you can see the two cats being here,
p197
aVChina and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.
p198
aVAnd they decided to go not only for health and education,
p199
aVbut also starting to grow their economy.
p200
aVAnd the market reformer was successful there.
p201
aVIn '92 India follows with a market reform.
p202
aVAnd they go quite closely together,
p203
aVand you can see that the similarity with India and China,
p204
aVin many ways, are greater than the differences with them.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd here they march on. And will they catch up?
p207
aa(lp208
VThis is the big question today.
p209
aVThere they are today.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow what does it mean that the \u2014
p212
aV(Applause)
p213
aVthe averages there \u2014 this is the average of China.
p214
aVIf I would split China, look here,
p215
aVShanghai has already catched up.
p216
aVShanghai is already there.
p217
aVAnd it's healthier than the United States.
p218
aVBut on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest
p219
aVinland provinces of China, is there.
p220
aVAnd if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,
p221
aVthe rural part of Guizhou goes down there.
p222
aVYou see this enormous inequity in China,
p223
aVin the midst of fast economic growth.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd if I would also look at India,
p226
aVyou have another type of inequity, actually, in India.
p227
aVThe geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.
p228
aVUttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,
p229
aVis poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.
p230
aVKerala is flying on top there,
p231
aVmatching United States in health,
p232
aVbut not in economy.
p233
aVAnd here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,
p234
aVis forging forward.
p235
aVNow in India, the big inequities are within the state,
p236
aVrather than between the states.
p237
aVAnd that is not a bad thing, in itself.
p238
aVIf you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities
p239
aVcan be more difficult in the long term to deal with,
p240
aVthan if it is in the same area where you have a growth center
p241
aVrelatively close to where poor people are living.
p242
aa(lp243
VNo, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States.
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aVOh, they broke my frame.
p246
aVWashington, D.C. went out here.
p247
aVMy friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this
p248
aVbecause there is a new leader in Washington
p249
aVwho is really concerned about the health system.
p250
aVAnd I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.
p251
aVis so rich over there
p252
aVbut they are not as healthy as Kerala.
p253
aVIt's quite interesting, isn't it?
p254
aV(Applause)
p255
aVI can see a business opportunity for Kerala,
p256
aVhelping fix the health system in the United States.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VNow here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there.
p263
aVAnd when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,
p264
aVyou see that in between them
p265
aVand ahead of them,
p266
aVis the whole emerging economies of the world,
p267
aVwhich Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world."
p268
aVYou can see that in health and education,
p269
aVa large part of the world population is putting forward,
p270
aVbut in Africa, and other parts,
p271
aVas in rural Guizhou in China,
p272
aVthere is still people with low health and very low economy.
p273
aVWe have an enormous disparity in the world.
p274
aVBut most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow, back to my projections.
p277
aVWhen will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.
p278
aVI will show income per person on this axis instead,
p279
aVpoor down here, rich up there.
p280
aVAnd then time here, from 1858
p281
aVI start the world.
p282
aVAnd we shall see what will happen with these countries.
p283
aVYou see, China under foreign domination
p284
aVactually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.
p285
aVWhereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.
p286
aVAnd after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.
p287
aVBut independence is coming here.
p288
aVGrowth is starting, economic reform.
p289
aVGrowth is faster, and with projection from IMF
p290
aVyou can see where you expect them to be in 2014.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow, the question is, "When will the catch up take place?"
p293
aVLook at, look at the United States.
p294
aVCan you see the bubble?
p295
aVThe bubbles, not my bubbles,
p296
aVbut the financial bubbles.
p297
aVThat's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there.
p298
aVYou see it came down there.
p299
aVAnd it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know.
p300
aVSo they doesn't seem to go this way, these countries.
p301
aVThey seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know.
p302
aVAnd people interested in growth
p303
aVare turning their eyes towards Asia.
p304
aa(lp305
VI can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up.
p306
aVYou see, Japan did it like that.
p307
aVWe add Japan to it.
p308
aVAnd there is no doubt that fast catch up
p309
aVcan take place.
p310
aVCan you see here what Japan did?
p311
aVJapan did it like this, until full catch up,
p312
aVand then they follow with the other high-income economies.
p313
aVBut the real projections for those ones,
p314
aVI would like to give it like this.
p315
aVCan be worse, can be better.
p316
aVIt's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.
p317
aVNow, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VI think I'm in a difficult position here.
p322
aVInequalities in China and India
p323
aVI consider really the big obstacle
p324
aVbecause to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity
p325
aVis what will create a domestic market,
p326
aVwhat will avoid social instability,
p327
aVand which will make use of the entire capacity
p328
aVof the population.
p329
aVSo, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,
p330
aVand electricity is really what is needed in India and China.
p331
aa(lp332
VYou know the climate. We have great international experts
p333
aVwithin India telling us that the climate is changing,
p334
aVand actions has to be taken,
p335
aVotherwise China and India would be the countries
p336
aVmost to suffer from climate change.
p337
aVAnd I consider India and China the best partners in the world
p338
aVin a good global climate policy.
p339
aVBut they ain't going to pay
p340
aVfor what others, who have more money,
p341
aVhave largely created, and I can agree on that.
p342
aa(lp343
VBut what I'm really worried about is war.
p344
aVWill the former rich countries really accept
p345
aVa completely changed world economy,
p346
aVand a shift of power away from where it has been
p347
aVthe last 50 to 100 to 150 years,
p348
aVback to Asia?
p349
aVAnd will Asia be able to handle that
p350
aVnew position of being in charge
p351
aVof being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?
p352
aVSo, always avoid war,
p353
aVbecause that always pushes human beings backward.
p354
aVNow if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,
p355
aVget ready for a world in equity,
p356
aVbecause this is what seems to be happening.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd that vision that I got as a young student,
p359
aV1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes,
p360
aVis just about to happen.
p361
aVAnd it will happen precisely
p362
aVthe year 2048
p363
aVin the later part of the summer, in July,
p364
aVmore precisely, the 27th of July.
p365
aV(Applause)
p366
aVThe 27th of July, 2048
p367
aVis my 100th birthday.
p368
aV(Laughter)
p369
aVAnd I expect to speak
p370
aVin the first session of the 39th TED India.
p371
aVGet your bookings in time. Thank you very much.

A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law.

worldly and well-traveled among us will have their perspectives shifted by Hans Rosling. A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007.

VThis is my grandfather.
p5
aVAnd this is my son.
p6
aVMy grandfather taught me to work with wood
p7
aVwhen I was a little boy,
p8
aVand he also taught me the idea that
p9
aVif you cut down a tree to turn it into something,
p10
aVhonor that tree's life and make it as beautiful
p11
aVas you possibly can.
p12
aVMy little boy reminded me
p13
aVthat for all the technology and all the toys in the world,
p14
aVsometimes just a small block of wood,
p15
aVif you stack it up tall,
p16
aVactually is an incredibly inspiring thing.
p17
aVThese are my buildings.
p18
aVI build all around the world
p19
aVout of our office in Vancouver and New York.
p20
aVAnd we build buildings of different sizes and styles
p21
aVand different materials, depending on where we are.
p22
aVBut wood is the material that I love the most,
p23
aVand I'm going to tell you the story about wood.
p24
aVAnd part of the reason I love it is that every time
p25
aVpeople go into my buildings that are wood,
p26
aVI notice they react completely differently.
p27
aVI've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings
p28
aVand hug a steel or a concrete column,
p29
aVbut I've actually seen that happen in a wood building.
p30
aVI've actually seen how people touch the wood,
p31
aVand I think there's a reason for it.
p32
aVJust like snowflakes, no two pieces of wood
p33
aVcan ever be the same anywhere on Earth.
p34
aVThat's a wonderful thing.
p35
aVI like to think that wood
p36
aVgives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings.
p37
aVIt's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make
p38
aVour buildings connect us to nature in the built environment.
p39
aVNow, I live in Vancouver, near a forest
p40
aVthat grows to 33 stories tall.
p41
aVDown the coast here in California, the redwood forest
p42
aVgrows to 40 stories tall.
p43
aVBut the buildings that we think about in wood
p44
aVare only four stories tall in most places on Earth.
p45
aVEven building codes actually limit the ability for us to build
p46
aVmuch taller than four stories in many places,
p47
aVand that's true here in the United States.
p48
aVNow there are exceptions,
p49
aVbut there needs to be some exceptions,
p50
aVand things are going to change, I'm hoping.
p51
aVAnd the reason I think that way is that
p52
aVtoday half of us live in cities,
p53
aVand that number is going to grow to 75 percent.
p54
aVCities and density mean that our buildings
p55
aVare going to continue to be big,
p56
aVand I think there's a role for wood to play in cities.
p57
aVAnd I feel that way because three billion people
p58
aVin the world today, over the next 20 years,
p59
aVwill need a new home.
p60
aVThat's 40 percent of the world that are going to need
p61
aVa new building built for them in the next 20 years.
p62
aVNow, one in three people living in cities today
p63
aVactually live in a slum.
p64
aVThat's one billion people in the world live in slums.
p65
aVA hundred million people in the world are homeless.
p66
aVThe scale of the challenge for architects
p67
aVand for society to deal with in building
p68
aVis to find a solution to house these people.
p69
aVBut the challenge is, as we move to cities,
p70
aVcities are built in these two materials,
p71
aVsteel and concrete, and they're great materials.
p72
aVThey're the materials of the last century.
p73
aVBut they're also materials with very high energy
p74
aVand very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process.
p75
aVSteel represents about three percent
p76
aVof man's greenhouse gas emissions,
p77
aVand concrete is over five percent.
p78
aVSo if you think about that, eight percent
p79
aVof our contribution to greenhouse gases today
p80
aVcomes from those two materials alone.
p81
aVWe don't think about it a lot, and unfortunately,
p82
aVwe actually don't even think about buildings, I think,
p83
aVas much as we should.
p84
aVThis is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases.
p85
aVAlmost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry,
p86
aVand if we look at energy, it's the same story.
p87
aVYou'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list,
p88
aVbut that's the conversation we mostly hear about.
p89
aVAnd although a lot of that is about energy,
p90
aVit's also so much about carbon.
p91
aVThe problem I see is that, ultimately,
p92
aVthe clash of how we solve that problem
p93
aVof serving those three billion people that need a home,
p94
aVand climate change, are a head-on collision
p95
aVabout to happen, or already happening.
p96
aVThat challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways,
p97
aVand I think wood is going to be part of that solution,
p98
aVand I'm going to tell you the story of why.
p99
aVAs an architect, wood is the only material,
p100
aVbig material, that I can build with
p101
aVthat's already grown by the power of the sun.
p102
aVWhen a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen
p103
aVand soaks up carbon dioxide,
p104
aVand it dies and it falls to the forest floor,
p105
aVit gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground.
p106
aVIf it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon
p107
aVback to the atmosphere as well.
p108
aVBut if you take that wood and you put it into a building
p109
aVor into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy,
p110
aVit actually has an amazing capacity
p111
aVto store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration.
p112
aVOne cubic meter of wood will store
p113
aVone tonne of carbon dioxide.
p114
aVNow our two solutions to climate are obviously
p115
aVto reduce our emissions and find storage.
p116
aVWood is the only major material building material
p117
aVI can build with that actually does both those two things.
p118
aVSo I believe that we have
p119
aVan ethic that the Earth grows our food,
p120
aVand we need to move to an ethic in this century
p121
aVthat the Earth should grow our homes.
p122
aVNow, how are we going to do that
p123
aVwhen we're urbanizing at this rate
p124
aVand we think about wood buildings only at four stories?
p125
aVWe need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need
p126
aVto grow bigger, and what we've been working on
p127
aVis 30-story tall buildings made of wood.
p128
aVWe've been engineering them with an engineer
p129
aVnamed Eric Karsh who works with me on it,
p130
aVand we've been doing this new work because
p131
aVthere are new wood products out there for us to use,
p132
aVand we call them mass timber panels.
p133
aVThese are panels made with young trees,
p134
aVsmall growth trees, small pieces of wood
p135
aVglued together to make panels that are enormous:
p136
aVeight feet wide, 64 feet long, and of various thicknesses.
p137
aVThe way I describe this best, I've found, is to say
p138
aVthat we're all used to two-by-four construction
p139
aVwhen we think about wood.
p140
aVThat's what people jump to as a conclusion.
p141
aVTwo-by-four construction is sort of like the little
p142
aVeight-dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids,
p143
aVand you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego
p144
aVat that size, and out of two-by-fours.
p145
aVBut do remember when you were a kid,
p146
aVand you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement,
p147
aVand you found that big 24-dot brick of Lego,
p148
aVand you were kind of like,
p149
aV"Cool, this is awesome. I can build something really big,
p150
aVand this is going to be great."
p151
aVThat's the change.
p152
aVMass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks.
p153
aVThey're changing the scale of what we can do,
p154
aVand what we've developed is something we call FFTT,
p155
aVwhich is a Creative Commons solution
p156
aVto building a very flexible system
p157
aVof building with these large panels where we tilt up
p158
aVsix stories at a time if we want to.
p159
aVThis animation shows you how the building goes together
p160
aVin a very simple way, but these buildings are available
p161
aVfor architects and engineers now to build on
p162
aVfor different cultures in the world,
p163
aVdifferent architectural styles and characters.
p164
aVIn order for us to build safely,
p165
aVwe've engineered these buildings, actually,
p166
aVto work in a Vancouver context,
p167
aVwhere we're a high seismic zone,
p168
aVeven at 30 stories tall.
p169
aVNow obviously, every time I bring this up,
p170
aVpeople even, you know, here at the conference, say,
p171
aV"Are you serious? Thirty stories? How's that going to happen?"
p172
aVAnd there's a lot of really good questions that are asked
p173
aVand important questions that we spent quite a long time
p174
aVworking on the answers to as we put together
p175
aVour report and the peer reviewed report.
p176
aVI'm just going to focus on a few of them,
p177
aVand let's start with fire, because I think fire
p178
aVis probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now.
p179
aVFair enough.
p180
aVAnd the way I describe it is this.
p181
aVIf I asked you to take a match and light it
p182
aVand hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire,
p183
aVit doesn't happen, right? We all know that.
p184
aVBut to build a fire, you kind of start with small pieces
p185
aVof wood and you work your way up,
p186
aVand eventually you can add the log to the fire,
p187
aVand when you do add the log to the fire, of course,
p188
aVit burns, but it burns slowly.
p189
aVWell, mass timber panels, these new products
p190
aVthat we're using, are much like the log.
p191
aVIt's hard to start them on fire, and when they do,
p192
aVthey actually burn extraordinarily predictably,
p193
aVand we can use fire science in order to predict
p194
aVand make these buildings as safe as concrete
p195
aVand as safe as steel.
p196
aVThe next big issue, deforestation.
p197
aVEighteen percent of our contribution
p198
aVto greenhouse gas emissions worldwide
p199
aVis the result of deforestation.
p200
aVThe last thing we want to do is cut down trees.
p201
aVOr, the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees.
p202
aVThere are models for sustainable forestry
p203
aVthat allow us to cut trees properly,
p204
aVand those are the only trees appropriate
p205
aVto use for these kinds of systems.
p206
aVNow I actually think that these ideas
p207
aVwill change the economics of deforestation.
p208
aVIn countries with deforestation issues,
p209
aVwe need to find a way to provide
p210
aVbetter value for the forest
p211
aVand actually encourage people to make money
p212
aVthrough very fast growth cycles \u2014
p213
aV10-, 12-, 15-year-old trees that make these products
p214
aVand allow us to build at this scale.
p215
aVWe've calculated a 20-story building:
p216
aVWe'll grow enough wood in North America every 13 minutes.
p217
aVThat's how much it takes.
p218
aVThe carbon story here is a really good one.
p219
aVIf we built a 20-story building out of cement and concrete,
p220
aVthe process would result in the manufacturing
p221
aVof that cement and 1,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
p222
aVIf we did it in wood, in this solution,
p223
aVwe'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes,
p224
aVfor a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.
p225
aVThat's the equivalent of about 900 cars
p226
aVremoved from the road in one year.
p227
aVThink back to that three billion people
p228
aVthat need a new home,
p229
aVand maybe this is a contributor to reducing.
p230
aVWe're at the beginning of a revolution, I hope,
p231
aVin the way we build, because this is the first new way
p232
aVto build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more.
p233
aVBut the challenge is changing society's perception
p234
aVof possibility, and it's a huge challenge.
p235
aVThe engineering is, truthfully, the easy part of this.
p236
aVAnd the way I describe it is this.
p237
aVThe first skyscraper, technically \u2014
p238
aVand the definition of a skyscraper is 10 stories tall, believe it or not \u2014
p239
aVbut the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago,
p240
aVand people were terrified to walk underneath this building.
p241
aVBut only four years after it was built,
p242
aVGustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower,
p243
aVand as he built the Eiffel Tower,
p244
aVhe changed the skylines of the cities of the world,
p245
aVchanged and created a competition
p246
aVbetween places like New York City and Chicago,
p247
aVwhere developers started building bigger and bigger buildings
p248
aVand pushing the envelope up higher and higher
p249
aVwith better and better engineering.
p250
aVWe built this model in New York, actually,
p251
aVas a theoretical model on the campus
p252
aVof a technical university soon to come,
p253
aVand the reason we picked this site
p254
aVto just show you what these buildings may look like,
p255
aVbecause the exterior can change.
p256
aVIt's really just the structure that we're talking about.
p257
aVThe reason we picked it is because this is a technical university,
p258
aVand I believe that wood is the most
p259
aVtechnologically advanced material I can build with.
p260
aVIt just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent,
p261
aVand we don't really feel comfortable with it.
p262
aVBut that's the way it should be,
p263
aVnature's fingerprints in the built environment.
p264
aVI'm looking for this opportunity
p265
aVto create an Eiffel Tower moment, we call it.
p266
aVBuildings are starting to go up around the world.
p267
aVThere's a building in London that's nine stories,
p268
aVa new building that just finished in Australia
p269
aVthat I believe is 10 or 11.
p270
aVWe're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings,
p271
aVand we're hoping, and I'm hoping,
p272
aVthat my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially
p273
aVannounces the world's tallest at around 20 stories
p274
aVin the not-so-distant future.
p275
aVThat Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling,
p276
aVthese arbitrary ceilings of height,
p277
aVand allow wood buildings to join the competition.
p278
aVAnd I believe the race is ultimately on.
p279
aVThank you.

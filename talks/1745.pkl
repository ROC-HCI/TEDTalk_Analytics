VOkay, it's great to be back at TED.
p5
aVWhy don't I just start by firing away with the video?

p14

p16
aa(lp17

VSergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince.
p52
aVHe needs help getting 10 million dollars.
p53
aVI like to pay attention to these
p54
aVbecause that's how we originally funded the company,
p55
aVand it's gone pretty well.
p56
aa(lp57
VThough in all seriousness,
p58
aVthis position that you just saw me in,
p59
aVlooking down at my phone,
p60
aVthat's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass.
p61
aVBecause we ultimately questioned
p62
aVwhether this is the ultimate future
p63
aVof how you want to connect to other people in your life,
p64
aVhow you want to connect to information.
p65
aVShould it be by just walking around looking down?
p66
aVBut that was the vision behind Glass,
p67
aVand that's why we've created this form factor.
p68
aVOkay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot,
p69
aVbut I want to tell you a little bit more
p70
aVabout the motivation behind what led to it.
p71
aVIn addition to potentially socially isolating yourself
p72
aVwhen you're out and about looking at your phone,
p73
aVit's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body?
p74
aVYou're standing around there
p75
aVand you're just rubbing
p76
aVthis featureless piece of glass.
p77
aVYou're just kind of moving around.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo when we developed Glass, we thought really about,
p80
aVcan we make something that frees your hands?
p81
aVYou saw all of the things people are doing
p82
aVin the video back there.
p83
aVThey were all wearing Glass,
p84
aVand that's how we got that footage.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd also you want something that frees your eyes.
p87
aVThat's why we put the display up high,
p88
aVout of your line of sight,
p89
aVso it wouldn't be where you're looking
p90
aVand it wouldn't be where you're making
p91
aVeye contact with people.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd also we wanted to free up the ears,
p94
aVso the sound actually goes through,
p95
aVconducts straight to the bones in your cranium,
p96
aVwhich is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it.
p97
aVAnd ironically, if you want to hear it better,
p98
aVyou actually just cover your ear,
p99
aVwhich is kind of surprising, but that's how it works.
p100
aa(lp101
VMy vision when we started Google 15 years ago
p102
aVwas that eventually you wouldn't
p103
aVhave to have a search query at all.
p104
aVYou'd just have information come to you as you needed it.
p105
aVAnd this is now, 15 years later,
p106
aVsort of the first form factor
p107
aVthat I think can deliver that vision
p108
aVwhen you're out and about on the street
p109
aVtalking to people and so forth.
p110
aa(lp111
VThis project has lasted now, been just over two years.
p112
aVWe've learned an amazing amount.
p113
aVIt's been really important to make it comfortable.
p114
aVSo our first prototypes we built were huge.
p115
aVIt was like cell phones strapped to your head.
p116
aVIt was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable.
p117
aVWe had to keep it secret from our industrial designer
p118
aVuntil she actually accepted the job,
p119
aVand then she almost ran away screaming.
p120
aVBut we've come a long way.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.
p123
aVOur original prototypes didn't have cameras at all,
p124
aVbut it's been really magical to be able to capture moments
p125
aVspent with my family, my kids.
p126
aVI just never would have dug out a camera
p127
aVor a phone or something else to take that moment.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device,
p130
aVthat I also kind of have a nervous tic.
p131
aVThe cell phone is \u2014 yeah, you have to look down on it and all that,
p132
aVbut it's also kind of a nervous habit.
p133
aVLike if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead.
p134
aVI would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler.
p135
aVYou know, I'd be like \u2014
p136
aVBut in this case, you know, I whip this out
p137
aVand I sit there and look as if I have something
p138
aVvery important to do or attend to.
p139
aVBut it really opened my eyes to how much of my life
p140
aVI spent just secluding away,
p141
aVbe it email or social posts or whatnot,
p142
aVeven though it wasn't really \u2014
p143
aVthere's nothing really that important or that pressing.
p144
aVAnd with this, I know I will get certain messages
p145
aVif I really need them,
p146
aVbut I don't have to be checking them all the time.
p147
aa(lp148
VYeah, I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more,
p149
aVdoing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video.
p150
aa(lp151
VThank you all very much.

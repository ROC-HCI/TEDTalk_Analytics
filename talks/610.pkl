VThere's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something,
p5
aVdoesn't mean it's not there."
p6
aVMy work is \u2014 it's a reflection of myself.
p7
aVWhat I wanted to do is to
p8
aVshow the world that the little things
p9
aVcan be the biggest things.
p10
aVWe all seem to think that,
p11
aVyou know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.
p12
aVAnd we use the word "nothing."
p13
aVNothing doesn't exist, because there is always something.
p14
aVMy mother told me that, when I was a child,
p15
aVthat I should always respect the little things.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhat made me do this work? I shall go into my story.
p18
aVThis all started when I was age five.
p19
aVWhat made me do it? At school, I will admit this:
p20
aVacademically, I couldn't express myself.
p21
aVSo I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."
p22
aVMy world was seen as less.
p23
aVSo I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.
p24
aVI thought, I need to retreat
p25
aVinto something else.
p26
aVSo when my mother used to take me to school,
p27
aVshe thought I was at school,
p28
aVand I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned,
p29
aVand run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, the one time I was in the shed,
p32
aVand my mother suspected something,
p33
aVthinking I was at school.
p34
aVMy mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.
p35
aVSo you'd just see her feet.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVSo I was hiding in the shed, like that.
p38
aVAnd all of a sudden ...
p39
aVAnd then I saw her legs.
p40
aVAnd then she said \u2014 grabbed me like that, because my mother was quite big \u2014
p41
aVand she lifted me up and she says,
p42
aV"How come you're not at school?"
p43
aVI told her I couldn't face it because the way
p44
aVthe teacher was treating me, ridiculing me,
p45
aVand using me as an example of failure.
p46
aVSo I told her.
p47
aVAt that age, obviously, I couldn't express it that way,
p48
aVbut I told her I didn't feel right.
p49
aVAnd then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."
p50
aVAnd walked off. And I didn't expect that,
p51
aVbecause I expected one of these ...
p52
aVBut I didn't get it.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo I'm sitting there thinking.
p55
aVAnd as I looked down on the ground,
p56
aVI noticed there was some ants running around.
p57
aVAnd I went into this little fantasy world.
p58
aVAnd I thought,
p59
aV"These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?
p60
aVOr do they need somewhere to live?"
p61
aVSo I thought "Perhaps,
p62
aVif I made these ants some apartments,
p63
aVthey'll move in."
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVSo I did.
p66
aVAnd how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.
p67
aVAnd I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass,
p68
aVconstructed this little apartment.
p69
aVWell it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.
p70
aVBut I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.
p71
aVAnd so they did.
p72
aVThat was a bit crude, at the time. And I made all these little apartments
p73
aVand little merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings, little ladders.
p74
aVAnd then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that.
p75
aVAnd then I sat down and all the ants came along.
p76
aVAnd all I could hear was "Is this for us?"
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd I say, "Yes, they're all for you."
p81
aVAnd they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVAnd from there I was watching this little world.
p84
aVIt became part of me.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhen I discovered that I had this gift,
p87
aVI wanted to experiment with this world
p88
aVthat we can't see.
p89
aVSo I realized that there was more to life
p90
aVthan just everything that we see around us that's huge.
p91
aVSo I started to educate myself on this molecular level.
p92
aVAnd as I got older, I continued. I showed my mother.
p93
aVMy mother told me to take it smaller.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow I shall show you something here.
p96
aVAnd I'll explain.
p97
aVAs you can see,
p98
aVthat's a pinhead.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VNow that is called the Huf Haus.
p105
aVThe gentleman who commissioned me to do this
p106
aVwas a gentleman called Peter Huf.
p107
aVAnd he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?"
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I say, "How are you going to fit in there?"
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd then he said to me,
p116
aV"I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?"
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd I says, "Well, try me."
p119
aVAnd then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this." So I said, "OK."
p120
aa(lp121
VSo, to cut a long story short,
p122
aVI went home, went underneath the microscope,
p123
aVand I crushed up a piece of glass,
p124
aVcrushed it up.
p125
aVAnd underneath the microscope
p126
aVthere were splinters of glass.
p127
aVSome of them were quite jagged.
p128
aVSo I was crushing up these pieces of glass,
p129
aVwhich, as you can see,
p130
aVthat's the actual frame of the house.
p131
aVAnd the actual roof is made up of a fiber,
p132
aVwhich I found in my sister's old teddy bear.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVSo I got the teddy bear and I said,
p135
aV"Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?"
p136
aVSo I did.
p137
aVAnd I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat.
p138
aVSo I decided to slice these up
p139
aVwith the tool that I make
p140
aVby \u2014 I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.
p141
aVAnd then I actually
p142
aVslow down my whole nervous system.
p143
aVAnd then I work between my heartbeat,
p144
aVI have one-and-a-half seconds
p145
aVto actually move.
p146
aVAnd at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale
p147
aVmy own work, at the same time.
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aV(Applause)
p150
aVBecause that has happened to me.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VSo what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.
p155
aVI found these little bits of glass.
p156
aVAnd I had to make them square.
p157
aVSo I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
p158
aVSo what I did, I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off.
p159
aVAnd what I did, I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them.
p160
aVI used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.
p161
aVAnd I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.
p162
aVAnd then I started rubbing, very very gently,
p163
aVtill some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it.
p164
aVAnd how I constructed it,
p165
aVis by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.
p166
aVAnd then pushing the glass in with its own friction.
p167
aVAnd as I was doing it, what happened?
p168
aVThe instrument that I used turned into a catapult.
p169
aVAnd it went like this ...
p170
aVAnd then that was it.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VGone.
p175
aVSo I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy
p176
aVwhen I told him his house has gone to another,
p177
aVinto the atmosphere somewhere."
p178
aVSo to cut the story short,
p179
aVI decided that I had to go back and do it.
p180
aVSo I found some more. And I decided to, sort of,
p181
aVconstruct it very, very slowly,
p182
aVholding my breath, working between my heartbeat,
p183
aVand making sure everything is leveled.
p184
aVBecause it's such a small sculpture,
p185
aVnothing can go wrong.
p186
aVAnd I decided to build it up.
p187
aVThen I used fibers out of my jumper,
p188
aVwhich I held and stretched.
p189
aVAnd made the beams going around the house.
p190
aVAnd the actual windows and the balcony
p191
aVhad to be sort of constructed.
p192
aVI used a money spider's web
p193
aVto actually attach certain things,
p194
aVwhich sent me insane.
p195
aVBut I managed to do it.
p196
aVAnd when I finished it, I came back the next day.
p197
aVI noticed that the house was occupied.
p198
aVHave we ever heard of a dust mite?
p199
aVDarren dust mite and his family moved in.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo basically I'd completed the house.
p204
aVAnd there you are.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VRight. As you can see,
p211
aVBart Simpson is having a little argument.
p212
aVI think they're arguing about the space on the pin.
p213
aVThere's not enough room for the two of them.
p214
aVSo I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.
p215
aVI think he was just warning him actually.
p216
aVBut this one was made out of a nylon tag
p217
aVout of my shirt.
p218
aVWhat I did, I plucked the tag out
p219
aVand put it underneath the microscope.
p220
aVI used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.
p221
aVCan anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?
p222
aa(lp223
VAudience: No.
p224
aa(lp225
VWW: So what I did is the same process where I
p226
aVjust kind of hold my breath
p227
aVand just work away very, very slowly,
p228
aVmanipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.
p229
aVWhenever you work on that level, things behave different.
p230
aVBecause it's on this molecular level things change
p231
aVand they act different.
p232
aVAnd sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.
p233
aVAnd, you know, all different things happen.
p234
aVBut I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane,
p235
aVto stop it moving.
p236
aVThen static electricity set in.
p237
aVAnd it went ...
p238
aVAnd I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything.
p239
aVSo there is sweat dripping off my head,
p240
aVbecause I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position.
p241
aVAnd after I've cut out the shape,
p242
aVthen I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo after I've done the same thing,
p245
aVthen I have to paint it.
p246
aVAnd after I've actually sculpted them,
p247
aVI have to paint them.
p248
aVI experimented with a \u2014
p249
aVI found a dead fly.
p250
aVAnd I plucked the hair off the fly's head.
p251
aVDecided to make a paintbrush.
p252
aV(Laughter)
p253
aVBut I would never do it to a living fly.
p254
aV(Laughter)
p255
aVBecause I've heard a fly in pain.
p256
aVAnd they go "Meow! Ow!"
p257
aVEven though they get on our nerves,
p258
aVI would never kill an insect
p259
aVbecause, "All creatures great and small" \u2014
p260
aVthere is a hymn that says that.
p261
aVSo what I decided to do
p262
aVis to pluck fine hair out of my face.
p263
aVAnd I looked at it underneath the microscope.
p264
aVThat was the paintbrush.
p265
aVAnd whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful,
p266
aVbecause the paint starts to turn into little blobs.
p267
aVAnd it starts to dry very quickly.
p268
aVSo I have to be very quick.
p269
aVIf I'm not, it will end up looking
p270
aVnot like what it's supposed to look like.
p271
aVIt could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.
p272
aVSo I have to be very very careful.
p273
aa(lp274
VThis one took me approximately,
p275
aVI would say, six to seven weeks.
p276
aVMy work, rough estimate,
p277
aVsometimes five, six to seven weeks;
p278
aVyou can't always anticipate.
p279
aV(Applause)
p280
aVAs you can see,
p281
aVthat's Charlton Heston brought down to size.
p282
aV(Laughter)
p283
aVHe says to me, "Willard" \u2014
p284
aVYou can see him saying, "Why me?"
p285
aVI says, "I enjoyed your film. That's why."
p286
aVAs you can see, there's an aphid fly there.
p287
aVThat's just to show the scale
p288
aVand the actual size of the sculpture.
p289
aVI would say it probably measures ...
p290
aVa quarter of a millimeter.
p291
aVIn America they say a period stop.
p292
aVSo say if you cut a period stop in half,
p293
aVa full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.
p294
aVIt's made \u2014 the chariot is made of gold.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber,
p297
aVwhich I took out of the air.
p298
aVWhen the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.
p299
aVAnd what I normally do is walk 'round a room \u2014
p300
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p301
aVtrying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope.
p302
aVI remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.
p303
aVAnd there was a lady standing by the bus stop.
p304
aVAnd she saw me walking around like this.
p305
aV(Laughter)
p306
aVAnd then she looked at me.
p307
aVAnd then I went ...
p308
aVAnd then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad."
p309
aVYeah, to actually do this thing \u2014
p310
aVthe actual chariot is made of gold.
p311
aVI had a 24-karat gold ring.
p312
aVAnd I cut off a little flake of gold.
p313
aVAnd I bent it 'round,
p314
aVand made it into the chariot.
p315
aVAnd the horse is made from nylon.
p316
aVAnd the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.
p317
aVTo get the symmetrical shape of the horse
p318
aVwas very difficult,
p319
aVbecause I had to get the horse to rear up
p320
aVand look as though it was in some kind of action.
p321
aa(lp322
VWhen I did this one,
p323
aVa gentleman seen it and said to me,
p324
aV"There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.
p325
aVThere's no way a man can do that.
p326
aVIt must be a machine."
p327
aVSo I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ..."
p328
aV(Laughter)
p329
aV(Applause)
p330
aVThat one took me approximately six weeks.
p331
aV(Applause)
p332
aa(lp333
VThe most famous statue in the world.
p334
aVThis one, I would say,
p335
aVwas a serious challenge.
p336
aV(Laughter)
p337
aVBecause I had to put the torch on the top.
p338
aVThat one is, more or less, the same type of process.
p339
aVThe bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand,
p340
aVbecause I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.
p341
aVI used a microscopic shard of diamond
p342
aVto actually carve the actual base.
p343
aVWell, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this,
p344
aVbecause that statue has always sort of
p345
aVkept an image in my head of, you know,
p346
aVthe beginning of people coming to America.
p347
aVSo it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time.
p348
aVAnd that's the first thing they saw.
p349
aVSo I wanted to have that little image.
p350
aVAnd this is it.
p351
aV(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd we all know that is the Hulk.
p354
aVI wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.
p355
aVBecause we know we see needles,
p356
aVbut people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle
p357
aVapart from putting a thread through it.
p358
aVSo I broke the needle.
p359
aVAnd made a needle look like
p360
aVthe Hulk's broken it.
p361
aVIt's \u2014 I had to make little holes
p362
aVin the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.
p363
aVSo most of my work, I don't use glue.
p364
aVThey go in with their own friction.
p365
aVAnd that's how I managed to do it.
p366
aVAs you can see, he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face.
p367
aVAnd his mouth must be probably about
p368
aVthree microns.
p369
aVSo the eyes are probably about one micron or something.
p370
aa(lp371
VThat ship there,
p372
aVthat's made from 24-karat gold.
p373
aVAnd I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.
p374
aVBut I had to rig it with strands of glue.
p375
aVBecause the web of the spider, it was sending me insane,
p376
aVbecause I couldn't get the web to move off.
p377
aVAnd that's 24-karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it.
p378
aVConstructed each plank of gold.
p379
aVAnd the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.
p380
aVThe flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.
p381
aVIt's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.
p382
aV(Applause)
p383
aa(lp384
VAs you can see, dressage.
p385
aV(Laughter)
p386
aVIt's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.
p387
aVThe actual rigging on the reins on the horse
p388
aVare made from the same sort of thing.
p389
aVAnd that was done with a particle from my shirt.
p390
aVAnd the pinhead I've made green around there
p391
aVby scraping the particles off a green shirt
p392
aVand then pressed onto the needle.
p393
aVIt's very painstaking work,
p394
aVbut the best things come in small packages.
p395

VI want you to take a trip with me.
p5
aVPicture yourself driving
p6
aVdown a small road in Africa,
p7
aVand as you drive along, you look off to the side,
p8
aVand this is what you see:
p9
aVyou see a field of graves.
p10
aVAnd you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture.
p11
aVAnd you go into the town,
p12
aVand you inquire, "What's going on here?"
p13
aVand people are initially reluctant to tell you.
p14
aVAnd then someone says,
p15
aV"These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."
p16
aVHIV isn't like other medical conditions;
p17
aVit's stigmatizing.
p18
aVPeople are reluctant to talk about it \u2014
p19
aVthere's a fear associated with it.
p20
aVAnd I'm going to talk about HIV today,
p21
aVabout the deaths,
p22
aVabout the stigma.
p23
aVIt's a medical story, but more than that, it's a social story.
p24
aa(lp25
VThis map depicts the global distribution of HIV.
p26
aVAnd as you can see,
p27
aVAfrica has a disproportionate share of the infection.
p28
aVThere are 33 million people
p29
aVliving with HIV in the world today.
p30
aVOf these, two-thirds, 22 million
p31
aVare living in sub-Saharan Africa.
p32
aVThere are 1.4 million pregnant women
p33
aVin low- and middle-income countries living with HIV
p34
aVand of these, 90 percent
p35
aVare in sub-Saharan Africa.
p36
aVWe talk about things in relative terms.
p37
aVAnd I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies
p38
aVand HIV-positive mothers.
p39
aVThe United States \u2014 a large country \u2014
p40
aVeach year, 7,000 mothers with HIV
p41
aVwho give birth to a child.
p42
aVBut you go to Rwanda \u2014 a very small country \u2014
p43
aV8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant.
p44
aVAnd then you go to Baragwanath Hospital,
p45
aVoutside of Johannesburg in South Africa,
p46
aVand 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women
p47
aVgiving birth \u2014
p48
aVa hospital the same as a country.
p49
aVAnd to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg
p50
aVthat when you compare
p51
aVeverything here to South Africa, it just pales,
p52
aVbecause in South Africa,
p53
aVeach year 300,000 mothers with HIV
p54
aVgive birth to children.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo we talk about PMTCT,
p57
aVand we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission.
p58
aVI think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public
p59
aVthat if a mother is HIV-positive,
p60
aVshe's going to infect her child.
p61
aVThe reality is really, very different.
p62
aVIn resource-rich countries,
p63
aVwith all the tests and treatment we currently have,
p64
aVless than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive \u2014
p65
aV98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative.
p66
aVAnd yet, the reality in resource-poor countries,
p67
aVin the absence of tests and treatment,
p68
aV40 percent \u2014 40 percent of children are infected \u2014
p69
aV40 percent versus two percent \u2014
p70
aVan enormous difference.
p71
aVSo these programs \u2014
p72
aVand I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk \u2014
p73
aVthese prevention programs,
p74
aVsimply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers
p75
aVto prevent them from infecting their babies,
p76
aVand also the medicines we give to mothers
p77
aVto keep them healthy and alive to raise their children.
p78
aVSo it's the test a mother gets when she comes in.
p79
aVIt's the drugs she receives
p80
aVto protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery.
p81
aVIt's the guidance she gets around infant feeding
p82
aVand safer sex.
p83
aVIt's an entire package of services,
p84
aVand it works.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo in the United States,
p87
aVsince the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s,
p88
aVthere's been an 80-percent decline
p89
aVin the number of HIV-infected children.
p90
aVLess than 100 babies are born with HIV
p91
aVeach year in the United States
p92
aVand yet, still,
p93
aVover 400,000 children
p94
aVare born every year in the world today with HIV.
p95
aVWhat does that mean?
p96
aVIt means 1,100 children infected each day \u2014
p97
aV1,100 children each day, infected with HIV.
p98
aVAnd where do they come from?
p99
aVWell, less than one comes from the United States.
p100
aVOne, on average, comes from Europe.
p101
aV100 come from Asia and the Pacific.
p102
aVAnd each day,
p103
aVa thousand babies \u2014 a thousand babies
p104
aVare born each day with HIV in Africa.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo again, I look at the globe here
p107
aVand the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa.
p108
aVAnd let's look at another map.
p109
aVAnd here, again, we see
p110
aVAfrica has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors.
p111
aVThat thin sliver you see here, that's Africa.
p112
aVAnd it's the same with nurses.
p113
aVThe truth is sub-Saharan Africa
p114
aVhas 24 percent
p115
aVof the global disease burden
p116
aVand yet only three percent of the world's health care workers.
p117
aVThat means doctors and nurses
p118
aVsimply don't have the time to take care of patients.
p119
aVA nurse in a busy clinic
p120
aVwill see 50 to 100 patients in a day,
p121
aVwhich leaves her just minutes per patient \u2014
p122
aVminutes per patient.
p123
aVAnd so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean?
p124
aa(lp125
VWell, back in 2001,
p126
aVwhen there was just a simple test
p127
aVand a single dose of a drug,
p128
aVa nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient,
p129
aVwould have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test,
p130
aVexplain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine,
p131
aVexplain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding,
p132
aVand test the baby \u2014 in minutes.
p133
aVWell, fortunately since 2001,
p134
aVwe've got new treatments, new tests,
p135
aVand we're far more successful,
p136
aVbut we don't have any more nurses.
p137
aVAnd so these are the tests
p138
aVa nurse now has to do
p139
aVin those same few minutes.
p140
aVIt's not possible \u2014
p141
aVit doesn't work.
p142
aVAnd so we need to find
p143
aVbetter ways of providing care.
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa \u2014
p146
aVmothers coming, pregnant and with their babies.
p147
aVThese women are here for care,
p148
aVbut we know that just doing a test,
p149
aVjust giving someone a drug,
p150
aVit's not enough.
p151
aVMeds don't equal medical care.
p152
aVDoctors and nurses, frankly,
p153
aVdon't have the time or skills
p154
aVto tell people what to do in ways they understand.
p155
aVI'm a doctor \u2014 I tell people things to do,
p156
aVand I expect them to follow my guidance \u2014
p157
aVbecause I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard \u2014
p158
aVbut the reality is,
p159
aVif I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex.
p160
aVYou should always use a condom,"
p161
aVand yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered \u2014
p162
aVwhat's going to happen?
p163
aVIf I tell her to take her medicines every day
p164
aVand yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so
p165
aVit's just not going to work.
p166
aVAnd so we need to do more,
p167
aVwe need to do it differently,
p168
aVwe need to do it in ways that are affordable
p169
aVand accessible and can be taken to scale,
p170
aVwhich means it can be done everywhere.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo, I want to tell you a story \u2014
p173
aVI want to take you on a little trip.
p174
aVImagine yourself, if you can,
p175
aVyou're a young woman in Africa, you're going to the hospital or clinic.
p176
aVYou go in for a test
p177
aVand you find out that you're pregnant, and you're delighted.
p178
aVAnd then they give you another test
p179
aVand they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated.
p180
aVAnd the nurse takes you into a room,
p181
aVand she tells you about the tests
p182
aVand HIV and the medicines you can take
p183
aVand how to take care of yourself and your baby,
p184
aVand you hear none of it.
p185
aVAll you're hearing is, "I'm going to die,
p186
aVand my baby is going to die."
p187
aVAnd then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go.
p188
aVAnd you don't know who you can talk to,
p189
aVbecause the truth is, HIV is so stigmatizing
p190
aVthat if you partner, your family, anyone in your home,
p191
aVyou're likely to be thrown out
p192
aVwithout any means of support.
p193
aVAnd this \u2014 this is the face and story
p194
aVof HIV in Africa today.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut we're here to talk about possible solutions
p197
aVand some good news.
p198
aVAnd I want to change the story a little bit.
p199
aVTake the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test,
p200
aVtakes her to a room.
p201
aVThe door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies,
p202
aVand they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening.
p203
aVThey're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches.
p204
aVAnd she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says,
p205
aV"Welcome to mothers2mothers.
p206
aVHave a seat. You're safe here.
p207
aVWe're all HIV-positive.
p208
aVYou're going to be okay. You're going to live.
p209
aVYour baby is going to be HIV-negative."
p210
aa(lp211
VWe view mothers
p212
aVas a community's single greatest resource.
p213
aVMothers take care of the children, take care of the home.
p214
aVSo often the men are gone.
p215
aVThey're working, or they're not part of the household.
p216
aVOur organization, mothers2mothers,
p217
aVenlists women with HIV
p218
aVas care providers.
p219
aVWe bring mothers who have HIV,
p220
aVwho've been through these PMTCT programs
p221
aVin the very facilities,
p222
aVto come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses
p223
aVas part of the health care team.
p224
aVThese mothers, we call them mentor mothers,
p225
aVare able to engage women
p226
aVwho, just like themselves, pregnant with babies,
p227
aVhave found out about being HIV-positive,
p228
aVwho need support and education.
p229
aVAnd they support them around the diagnosis
p230
aVand educate them about how to take their medicines,
p231
aVhow to take care of themselves,
p232
aVhow to take care of their babies.
p233
aVConsider: if you needed surgery,
p234
aVyou would want the best possible technical surgeon, right?
p235
aVBut if you wanted to understand
p236
aVwhat that surgery would do to your life,
p237
aVyou'd like to engage someone,
p238
aVsomeone who's had the procedure.
p239
aVPatients are experts on their own experience,
p240
aVand they can share that experience with others.
p241
aVThis is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo the mothers who work for us,
p244
aVthey come from the communities in which they work.
p245
aVThey're hired \u2014 they're paid as professional members of the health care teams,
p246
aVjust like doctors and nurses.
p247
aVAnd we open bank accounts for them
p248
aVand they're paid directly into the accounts,
p249
aVbecause their money's protected;
p250
aVthe men can't take it away from them.
p251
aVThey go through two to three weeks
p252
aVof rigorous curriculum-based education, training.
p253
aVNow, doctors and nurses \u2014 they too get trained.
p254
aVBut so often, they only get trained once,
p255
aVso they're not aware of new medicines,
p256
aVnew guidelines as they come out.
p257
aVOur mentor mothers get trained every single year
p258
aVand retrained.
p259
aVAnd so doctors and nurses \u2014
p260
aVthey look up to them as experts.
p261
aVImagine that: a woman, a former patient,
p262
aVbeing able to educate her doctor for the first time
p263
aVand educate the other patients
p264
aVthat she's taking care of.
p265
aa(lp266
VOur organization has three goals.
p267
aVThe first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
p268
aVThe second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive,
p269
aVkeep the children alive \u2014
p270
aVno more orphans.
p271
aVAnd the third, and maybe the most grand,
p272
aVis to find ways to empower women,
p273
aVenable them to fight the stigma
p274
aVand to live positive and productive lives with HIV.
p275
aVSo how do we do it?
p276
aVWell, maybe the most important engagement
p277
aVis the one-to-one,
p278
aVseeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them,
p279
aVexplaining how they can take care of themselves.
p280
aVWe go beyond that;
p281
aVwe try to bring in the husbands, the partners.
p282
aVIn Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men.
p283
aVMen are not frequently part of pregnancy care.
p284
aVBut in Rwanda, in one country,
p285
aVthey've got a policy
p286
aVthat a woman can't come for care
p287
aVunless she brings the father of the baby with her \u2014
p288
aVthat's the rule.
p289
aVAnd so the father and the mother, together,
p290
aVgo through the counseling and the testing.
p291
aVThe father and the mother, together, they get the results.
p292
aVAnd this is so important in breaking through the stigma.
p293
aa(lp294
VDisclosure is so central to prevention.
p295
aVHow do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly
p296
aVif there hasn't been disclosure?
p297
aVDisclosure is so important to treatment,
p298
aVbecause again, people need the support of family members and friends
p299
aVto take their medicines regularly.
p300
aVWe also work in groups.
p301
aVNow the groups, it's not like me lecturing,
p302
aVbut what happens is women, they come together \u2014
p303
aVunder the support and guidance of our mentor mothers \u2014
p304
aVthey come together, and they share their personal experiences.
p305
aVAnd it's through the sharing
p306
aVthat people get tactics of how to take care of themselves,
p307
aVhow to disclose how to take medicines.
p308
aVAnd then there's the community outreach,
p309
aVengaging women in their communities.
p310
aVIf we can change the way
p311
aVhouseholds believe and think,
p312
aVwe can change the way communities believe and think.
p313
aVAnd if we can change enough communities,
p314
aVwe can change national attitudes.
p315
aVWe can change national attitudes to women
p316
aVand national attitudes to HIV.
p317
aVThe hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction.
p318
aVWe have the medicines, we have the tests,
p319
aVbut how do you reduce the stigma?
p320
aVAnd it's important about disclosure.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back,
p323
aVand she told me a story.
p324
aVShe had been asked by one of the clients
p325
aVto go to the home of the client,
p326
aVbecause the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters
p327
aVabout her HIV status,
p328
aVand she was afraid to go by herself.
p329
aVAnd so the mentor mother went along with.
p330
aVAnd the patient walked into the house
p331
aVand said to her mother and siblings,
p332
aV"I have something to tell you. I'm HIV-positive."
p333
aVAnd everybody was quiet.
p334
aVAnd then her oldest brother stood up and said,
p335
aV"I too have something to tell you.
p336
aVI'm HIV-positive.
p337
aVI've been afraid to tell everybody."
p338
aVAnd then this older sister stood up and said,
p339
aV"I too am living with the virus,
p340
aVand I've been ashamed."
p341
aVAnd then her younger brother stood up and said,
p342
aV"I'm also positive.
p343
aVI thought you were going to throw me out of the family."
p344
aVAnd you see where this is going.
p345
aVThe last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive.
p346
aVI thought you were going to hate me."
p347
aVAnd there they were, all of them together for the first time
p348
aVbeing able to share this experience for the first time
p349
aVand to support each other for the first time.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Video) Female Narrator: Women come to us,
p352
aVand they are crying and scared.
p353
aVI tell them my story,
p354
aVthat I am HIV-positive,
p355
aVbut my child is HIV-negative.
p356
aVI tell them, "You are going to make it,
p357
aVand you will raise a healthy baby."
p358
aVI am proof that there is hope.
p359
aa(lp360
VMitchell Besser: Remember the images I showed you
p361
aVof how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa.
p362
aVAnd it is a crisis in health care systems.
p363
aVEven as we have more tests and more drugs,
p364
aVwe can't reach people; we don't have enough providers.
p365
aVSo we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.
p366
aVTask-shifting is traditionally
p367
aVwhen you take health care services from one provider
p368
aVand have another provider do it.
p369
aVTypically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse.
p370
aVAnd the issue in Africa
p371
aVis that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors,
p372
aVand so we need to find new paradigm for health care.
p373
aVHow do you build a better health care system?
p374
aVWe've chosen to redefine the health care system
p375
aVas a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother.
p376
aVAnd so what nurses do
p377
aVis that they ask the mentor mothers to explain
p378
aVhow to take the drugs, the side effects.
p379
aVThey delegate education about infant feeding,
p380
aVfamily planning, safer sex,
p381
aVactions that nurses simple just don't have time for.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission.
p384
aVThe world is increasingly seeing these programs
p385
aVas the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health.
p386
aVAnd our organization
p387
aVhelps women across that bridge.
p388
aVThe care doesn't stop when the baby's born \u2014
p389
aVwe deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby,
p390
aVensuring that they live healthy,
p391
aVsuccessful lives.
p392
aa(lp393
VOur organization works on three levels.
p394
aVThe first, at the patient level \u2014
p395
aVmothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV,
p396
aVkeeping mothers healthy to raise them.
p397
aVThe second, communities \u2014
p398
aVempowering women.
p399
aVThey become leaders within their communities.
p400
aVThey change the way communities think \u2014
p401
aVwe need to change attitudes to HIV.
p402
aVWe need to change attitudes to women in Africa.
p403
aVWe have to do that.
p404
aVAnd then rework the level of the health care systems,
p405
aVbuilding stronger health care systems.
p406
aVOur health care systems are broken.
p407
aVThey're not going to work the way they're currently designed.
p408
aVAnd so doctors and nurses
p409
aVwho need to try to change people's behaviors
p410
aVdon't have the skills, don't have the time \u2014
p411
aVour mentor mothers do.
p412
aVAnd so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in,
p413
aVwe can do that.
p414
aa(lp415
VI started the program in Capetown, South Africa
p416
aVback in 2001.
p417
aVIt was at that point, just the spark of an idea.
p418
aVReferencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday
p419
aVon where ideas come from,
p420
aVI was in the shower at the time \u2014
p421
aVI was alone.
p422
aV(Laughter)
p423
aVThe program is now working in nine countries,
p424
aVwe have 670 program sites,
p425
aVwe're seeing about 230,000
p426
aVwomen every month,
p427
aVwe're employing 1,600 mentor mothers,
p428
aVand last year, they enrolled
p429
aV300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers.
p430
aVThat is 20 percent
p431
aVof the global HIV-positive pregnant women \u2014
p432
aV20 percent of the world.
p433
aVWhat's extraordinary is how simple the premise is.
p434
aVMothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV.
p435
aVPast patients taking care of present patients.
p436
aVAnd empowerment through employment \u2014
p437
aVreducing stigma.
p438
aa(lp439
V(Video) Female Narrator: There is hope,
p440
aVhope that one day
p441
aVwe shall win this fight
p442
aVagainst HIV and AIDS.
p443
aVEach person must know
p444
aVtheir HIV status.
p445

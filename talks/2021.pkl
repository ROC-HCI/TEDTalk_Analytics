VSix months ago, I got an email
p5
aVfrom a man in Israel
p6
aVwho had read one of my books,
p7
aVand the email said,
p8
aV"You don't know me,
p9
aVbut I'm your 12th cousin."
p10
aVAnd it said, "I have a family tree
p11
aVwith 80,000 people on it, including you,
p12
aVKarl Marx,
p13
aVand several European aristocrats."
p14
aVNow I did not know what to make of this.
p15
aVPart of me was like, okay,
p16
aVwhen's he going to ask me to wire
p17
aV10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right?
p18
aVI also thought, 80,000 relatives,
p19
aVdo I want that?
p20
aVI have enough trouble with some of the ones
p21
aVI have already.
p22
aVAnd I won't name names, but you know who you are.
p23
aVBut another part of me said, this is remarkable.
p24
aVHere I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.
p25
aVI'm connected to 80,000 people around the world,
p26
aVand that's four Madison Square Gardens
p27
aVfull of cousins.
p28
aVAnd some of them are going to be great,
p29
aVand some of them are going to be irritating,
p30
aVbut they're all related to me.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo this email inspired me to dive into genealogy,
p33
aVwhich I always thought was a very staid and proper field,
p34
aVbut it turns out it's going through a fascinating
p35
aVrevolution, and a controversial one.
p36
aVPartly, this is because of DNA and genetic testing,
p37
aVbut partly, it's because of the Internet.
p38
aVThere are sites that now take
p39
aVthe Wikipedia approach to family trees,
p40
aVcollaboration and crowdsourcing,
p41
aVand what you do is,
p42
aVyou load your family tree on,
p43
aVand then these sites search
p44
aVto see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree
p45
aVis the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree,
p46
aVand if it is, then you can combine,
p47
aVand then you combine and combine and combine
p48
aVuntil you get these massive,
p49
aVmega-family trees
p50
aVwith thousands of people on them,
p51
aVor even millions.
p52
aVI'm on something on Geni called
p53
aVthe world family tree,
p54
aVwhich has no less than a jaw-dropping
p55
aV75 million people.
p56
aVSo that's 75 million people connected by blood
p57
aVor marriage, sometimes both.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVIt's in all seven continents, including Antarctica.
p60
aVI'm on it. Many of you are on it,
p61
aVwhether you know it or not,
p62
aVand you can see the links.
p63
aVHere's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow.
p64
aVShe has no idea I exist,
p65
aVbut we are officially cousins.
p66
aVWe have just 17 links between us.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd there's my cousin Barack Obama.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVAnd he is my aunt's fifth great-aunt's husband's
p71
aVfather's wife's seventh great-nephew,
p72
aVso practically my old brother.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd my cousin, of course,
p75
aVthe actor Kevin Bacon \u2014
p76
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p77
aVwho is my first cousin's twice removed's
p78
aVwife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's
p79
aVniece's husband.
p80
aVSo six degrees of Kevin Bacon,
p81
aVplus or minus several degrees.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, I'm not boasting, because all of you
p84
aVhave famous people and historical figures
p85
aVin your tree, because we are all connected,
p86
aVand 75 million may seem like a lot,
p87
aVbut in a few years, it's quite likely
p88
aVwe will have a family tree
p89
aVwith all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut does it really matter?
p92
aVWhat's the importance?
p93
aVAnd I do think it is important,
p94
aVand I'll give you five reasons why, really quickly.
p95
aa(lp96
VFirst, it's got scientific value.
p97
aVThis is an unprecedented history of the human race,
p98
aVand it's giving us valuable data
p99
aVabout how diseases are inherited,
p100
aVhow people migrate,
p101
aVand there's a team of scientists at MIT right now
p102
aVstudying the world family tree.
p103
aa(lp104
VNumber two, it brings history alive.
p105
aVI found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein,
p106
aVso I told my seven-year-old son that,
p107
aVand he was totally engaged.
p108
aVNow Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy
p109
aVwith weird hair.
p110
aVHe's Uncle Albert. (Laughter)
p111
aVAnd my son wanted to know,
p112
aV"What did he say? What is E = MC squared?"
p113
aVAlso, it's not all good news.
p114
aVI found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer,
p115
aVbut I will say that's on my wife's side.
p116
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p117
aVSo I want to make that clear. Sorry, honey.
p118
aa(lp119
VNumber three, interconnectedness.
p120
aVWe all come from the same ancestor,
p121
aVand you don't have to believe the literal Bible version,
p122
aVbut scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam
p123
aVand mitochondrial Eve,
p124
aVand these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.
p125
aVWe all have a bit of their DNA in us.
p126
aVThey are our great-great-great-great-great-great \u2014
p127
aVcontinue that for about 7,000 times \u2014
p128
aVgrandparents,
p129
aVand so that means we literally all are
p130
aVbiological cousins as well,
p131
aVand estimates vary, but probably
p132
aVthe farthest cousin you have on Earth
p133
aVis about a 50th cousin.
p134
aVNow, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants.
p135
aVIf you have kids, and they have kids,
p136
aVlook how quickly the descendants accumulate.
p137
aVSo in 10, 12 generations,
p138
aVyou're going to have thousands of offspring,
p139
aVand millions of offspring.
p140
aa(lp141
VNumber four, a kinder world.
p142
aVNow, I know that there are family feuds.
p143
aVI have three sons, so I see how they fight.
p144
aVBut I think that there's also a human bias
p145
aVto treat your family a little better than strangers.
p146
aVI think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots,
p147
aVbecause they're going to have to realize
p148
aVthat they are cousins with thousands of people
p149
aVin whatever ethnic group they happen
p150
aVto have issues with,
p151
aVand I think you look back at history,
p152
aVand a lot of the terrible things we've done to each other
p153
aVis because one group thinks another group is sub-human,
p154
aVand you can't do that anymore.
p155
aVWe're not just part of the same species.
p156
aVWe're part of the same family.
p157
aVWe share 99.9 percent of our DNA.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow the final one is number five,
p160
aVa democratizing effect.
p161
aVSome genealogy has an elitist strain,
p162
aVlike people say, "Oh, I'm descended
p163
aVfrom Mary Queen of Scots
p164
aVand you're not, so you cannot join my country club."
p165
aVBut that's really going to be hard to do now,
p166
aVbecause everyone is related.
p167
aVI'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots \u2014
p168
aVby marriage, but still.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo it's really a fascinating time
p171
aVin the history of family,
p172
aVbecause it's changing so fast.
p173
aVThere is gay marriage and sperm donors
p174
aVand there's intermarriage on an unprecedented scale,
p175
aVand this makes some of my more conservative cousins
p176
aVa little nervous,
p177
aVbut I actually think it's a good thing.
p178
aVI think the more inclusive the idea of family is,
p179
aVthe better,
p180
aVbecause then you have more potential caretakers,
p181
aVand as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed
p182
aVHillary Clinton says \u2014
p183
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p184
aVit takes a village.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo I have all these hundreds and thousands,
p187
aVmillions of new cousins.
p188
aVI thought, what can I do with this information?
p189
aVAnd that's when I decided,
p190
aVwhy not throw a party?
p191
aVSo that's what I'm doing.
p192
aVAnd you're all invited.
p193
aVNext year, next summer,
p194
aVI will be hosting what I hope is
p195
aVthe biggest and best family reunion in history.
p196
aV(Applause)
p197
aVThank you. I want you there.
p198
aVI want you there.
p199
aVIt's going to be at the New York Hall of Science,
p200
aVwhich is a great venue,
p201
aVbut it's also on the site of the former World's Fair,
p202
aVwhich is, I think, very appropriate,
p203
aVbecause I see this as a family reunion
p204
aVmeets a world's fair.
p205
aVThere's going to be exhibits and food, music.
p206
aVPaul McCartney is 11 steps away,
p207
aVso I'm hoping he brings his guitar.
p208
aVHe hasn't RSVP'd yet, but fingers crossed.
p209
aVAnd there is going to be a day of speakers,
p210
aVof fascinating cousins.
p211
aVIt's early, but I've already,
p212
aVI've got some lined up.
p213
aVCass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhaps
p214
aVthe most brilliant legal scholar, will be talking.
p215
aVHe was a former member of the Obama administration.
p216
aVAnd on the other side of the political spectrum,
p217
aVGeorge H.W. Bush, number 41, the father,
p218
aVhe has agreed to participate,
p219
aVand Nick Kroll, the comedian,
p220
aVand Dr. Oz, and many more to come.
p221
aVAnd, of course, the most important is that you,
p222
aVI want you guys there,
p223
aVand I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org
p224
aVand figure out how you're on the family tree,
p225
aVbecause these are big issues, family and tribe,
p226
aVand I don't know all the answers,
p227
aVbut I have a lot of smart relatives,
p228
aVincluding you guys,
p229
aVso together, I think we can figure it out.
p230
aVOnly together can we solve these big problems.
p231
aVSo from cousin to cousin,
p232
aVI thank you. I can't wait to see you.
p233
aVGoodbye.

VI'd like to introduce you to an organism:
p5
aVa slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
p6
aVIt's a mold with an identity crisis, because it's not a mold,
p7
aVso let's get that straight to start with.
p8
aVIt is one of 700 known slime molds
p9
aVbelonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.
p10
aVIt is a single-celled organism, a cell,
p11
aVthat joins together with other cells
p12
aVto form a mass super-cell
p13
aVto maximize its resources.
p14
aVSo within a slime mold you might find thousands
p15
aVor millions of nuclei,
p16
aVall sharing a cell wall,
p17
aVall operating as one entity.
p18
aVIn its natural habitat,
p19
aVyou might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands,
p20
aVeating rotting vegetation,
p21
aVbut you might equally find it
p22
aVin research laboratories,
p23
aVclassrooms, and even artists' studios.
p24
aa(lp25
VI first came across the slime mold about five years ago.
p26
aVA microbiologist friend of mine
p27
aVgave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it
p28
aVand told me to go home and play with it.
p29
aVThe only instructions I was given,
p30
aVthat it likes it dark and damp
p31
aVand its favorite food is porridge oats.
p32
aVI'm an artist who's worked for many years
p33
aVwith biology, with scientific processes,
p34
aVso living material is not uncommon for me.
p35
aVI've worked with plants, bacteria,
p36
aVcuttlefish, fruit flies.
p37
aVSo I was keen to get my new collaborator home
p38
aVto see what it could do.
p39
aVSo I took it home and I watched.
p40
aVI fed it a varied diet.
p41
aVI observed as it networked.
p42
aVIt formed a connection between food sources.
p43
aVI watched it leave a trail behind it,
p44
aVindicating where it had been.
p45
aVAnd I noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish,
p46
aVit would escape and find a better home.
p47
aa(lp48
VI captured my observations
p49
aVthrough time-lapse photography.
p50
aVSlime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour,
p51
aVso it's not really ideal for live viewing
p52
aVunless there's some form of really extreme meditation,
p53
aVbut through the time lapse,
p54
aVI could observe some really interesting behaviors.
p55
aVFor instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats,
p56
aVthe slime mold goes off to explore new territories
p57
aVin different directions simultaneously.
p58
aVWhen it meets itself,
p59
aVit knows it's already there,
p60
aVit recognizes it's there,
p61
aVand instead retreats back
p62
aVand grows in other directions.
p63
aVI was quite impressed by this feat,
p64
aVat how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime
p65
aVcould somehow map its territory,
p66
aVknow itself, and move with seeming intention.
p67
aa(lp68
VI found countless scientific studies,
p69
aVresearch papers, journal articles,
p70
aVall citing incredible work with this one organism,
p71
aVand I'm going to share a few of those with you.
p72
aVFor example, a team in Hokkaido University in Japan
p73
aVfilled a maze with slime mold.
p74
aVIt joined together and formed a mass cell.
p75
aVThey introduced food at two points,
p76
aVoats of course,
p77
aVand it formed a connection
p78
aVbetween the food.
p79
aVIt retracted from empty areas and dead ends.
p80
aVThere are four possible routes through this maze,
p81
aVyet time and time again,
p82
aVthe slime mold established the shortest
p83
aVand the most efficient route.
p84
aVQuite clever.
p85
aVThe conclusion from their experiment
p86
aVwas that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence.
p87
aVAnother study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold.
p88
aVIt didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold.
p89
aVIt doesn't like it dry.
p90
aVThey did this at repeat intervals,
p91
aVand each time, the slime mold
p92
aVslowed down its growth in response.
p93
aVHowever, at the next interval,
p94
aVthe researchers didn't put the cold air on,
p95
aVyet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation
p96
aVof it happening.
p97
aVIt somehow knew that it was about the time
p98
aVfor the cold air that it didn't like.
p99
aVThe conclusion from their experiment
p100
aVwas that the slime mold was able to learn.
p101
aVA third experiment:
p102
aVthe slime mold was invited
p103
aVto explore a territory covered in oats.
p104
aVIt fans out in a branching pattern.
p105
aVAs it goes, each food node it finds,
p106
aVit forms a network, a connection to,
p107
aVand keeps foraging.
p108
aVAfter 26 hours, it established
p109
aVquite a firm network
p110
aVbetween the different oats.
p111
aVNow there's nothing remarkable in this
p112
aVuntil you learn that the center oat that it started from
p113
aVrepresents the city of Tokyo,
p114
aVand the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations.
p115
aVThe slime mold had replicated
p116
aVthe Tokyo transport network
p117
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p118
aVa complex system developed over time
p119
aVby community dwellings, civil engineering, urban planning.
p120
aVWhat had taken us well over 100 years
p121
aVtook the slime mold just over a day.
p122
aVThe conclusion from their experiment
p123
aVwas that the slime mold can form efficient networks
p124
aVand solve the traveling salesman problem.
p125
aa(lp126
VIt is a biological computer.
p127
aVAs such, it has been mathematically modeled,
p128
aValgorithmically analyzed.
p129
aVIt's been sonified, replicated, simulated.
p130
aVWorld over, teams of researchers
p131
aVare decoding its biological principles
p132
aVto understand its computational rules
p133
aVand applying that learning to the fields of electronics,
p134
aVprogramming and robotics.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo the question is,
p137
aVhow does this thing work?
p138
aVIt doesn't have a central nervous system.
p139
aVIt doesn't have a brain,
p140
aVyet it can perform behaviors
p141
aVthat we associate with brain function.
p142
aVIt can learn, it can remember,
p143
aVit can solve problems, it can make decisions.
p144
aVSo where does that intelligence lie?
p145
aVSo this is a microscopy, a video I shot,
p146
aVand it's about 100 times magnification,
p147
aVsped up about 20 times,
p148
aVand inside the slime mold,
p149
aVthere is a rhythmic pulsing flow,
p150
aVa vein-like structure carrying
p151
aVcellular material, nutrients and chemical information
p152
aVthrough the cell,
p153
aVstreaming first in one direction and then back in another.
p154
aVAnd it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation
p155
aVwithin the cell that allows it to form
p156
aVquite a complex understanding of its environment,
p157
aVbut without any large-scale control center.
p158
aVThis is where its intelligence lies.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo it's not just academic researchers
p161
aVin universities that are interested in this organism.
p162
aVA few years ago, I set up SliMoCo,
p163
aVthe Slime Mould Collective.
p164
aVIt's an online, open, democratic network
p165
aVfor slime mold researchers and enthusiasts
p166
aVto share knowledge and experimentation
p167
aVacross disciplinary divides
p168
aVand across academic divides.
p169
aVThe Slime Mould Collective membership is self-selecting.
p170
aVPeople have found the collective
p171
aVas the slime mold finds the oats.
p172
aVAnd it comprises of scientists
p173
aVand computer scientists and researchers
p174
aVbut also artists like me,
p175
aVarchitects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.
p176
aVIt's a very interesting, eclectic membership.
p177
aVJust a few examples:
p178
aVan artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum;
p179
aVa collaborative team
p180
aVwho are combining biological and electronic design
p181
aVwith 3D printing technologies in a workshop;
p182
aVanother artist who is using the slime mold
p183
aVas a way of engaging a community
p184
aVto map their area.
p185
aVHere, the slime mold is being used directly
p186
aVas a biological tool, but metaphorically
p187
aVas a symbol for ways of talking
p188
aVabout social cohesion, communication
p189
aVand cooperation.
p190
aVOther public engagement activities,
p191
aVI run lots of slime mold workshops,
p192
aVa creative way of engaging with the organism.
p193
aVSo people are invited to come and learn
p194
aVabout what amazing things it can do,
p195
aVand they design their own petri dish experiment,
p196
aVan environment for the slime mold to navigate
p197
aVso they can test its properties.
p198
aVEverybody takes home a new pet
p199
aVand is invited to post their results
p200
aVon the Slime Mould Collective.
p201
aVAnd the collective has enabled me
p202
aVto form collaborations
p203
aVwith a whole array of interesting people.
p204
aVI've been working with filmmakers
p205
aVon a feature-length slime mold documentary,
p206
aVand I stress feature-length,
p207
aVwhich is in the final stages of edit
p208
aVand will be hitting your cinema screens very soon.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VIt's also enabled me to conduct what I think is
p212
aVthe world's first human slime mold experiment.
p213
aVThis is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.
p214
aVWe invited people to become slime mold for half an hour.
p215
aVSo we essentially tied people together
p216
aVso they were a giant cell,
p217
aVand invited them to follow slime mold rules.
p218
aVYou have to communicate through oscillations,
p219
aVno speaking.
p220
aVYou have to operate as one entity, one mass cell,
p221
aVno egos,
p222
aVand the motivation for moving
p223
aVand then exploring the environment
p224
aVis in search of food.
p225
aVSo a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers
p226
aVtied together with yellow ropes wearing "Being Slime Mold" t-shirts
p227
aVwandered through the museum park.
p228
aVWhen they met trees, they had to reshape
p229
aVtheir connections and reform as a mass cell
p230
aVthrough not speaking.
p231
aVThis is a ludicrous experiment in many, many ways.
p232
aVThis isn't hypothesis-driven.
p233
aVWe're not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.
p234
aVBut what it did provide us was a way
p235
aVof engaging a broad section of the public
p236
aVwith ideas of intelligence, agency, autonomy,
p237
aVand provide a playful platform
p238
aVfor discussions about
p239
aVthe things that ensued.
p240
aVOne of the most exciting things
p241
aVabout this experiment
p242
aVwas the conversation that happened afterwards.
p243
aVAn entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park.
p244
aVPeople talked about the human psychology,
p245
aVof how difficult it was to let go
p246
aVof their individual personalities and egos.
p247
aVOther people talked about bacterial communication.
p248
aVEach person brought in their own
p249
aVindividual interpretation,
p250
aVand our conclusion from this experiment was that
p251
aVthe people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative,
p252
aVespecially when given beer.
p253
aVWe didn't just give them oats.
p254
aVWe gave them beer as well.
p255
aa(lp256
VBut they weren't as efficient as the slime mold,
p257
aVand the slime mold, for me,
p258
aVis a fascinating subject matter.
p259
aVIt's biologically fascinating,
p260
aVit's computationally interesting,
p261
aVbut it's also a symbol,
p262
aVa way of engaging with ideas of community,
p263
aVcollective behavior, cooperation.
p264
aVA lot of my work draws on the scientific research,
p265
aVso this pays homage to the maze experiment
p266
aVbut in a different way.
p267
aVAnd the slime mold is also my working material.
p268
aVIt's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations,
p269
aVparticipatory events.
p270
aVWhilst the slime mold doesn't choose
p271
aVto work with me, exactly,
p272
aVit is a collaboration of sorts.
p273
aVI can predict certain behaviors
p274
aVby understanding how it operates,
p275
aVbut I can't control it.
p276
aVThe slime mold has the final say
p277
aVin the creative process.
p278
aVAnd after all, it has its own internal aesthetics.
p279
aVThese branching patterns that we see
p280
aVwe see across all forms, scales of nature,
p281
aVfrom river deltas to lightning strikes,
p282
aVfrom our own blood vessels to neural networks.
p283
aVThere's clearly significant rules at play
p284
aVin this simple yet complex organism,
p285
aVand no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry,
p286
aVthere's a great deal that we can learn
p287
aVfrom observing and engaging
p288
aVwith this beautiful, brainless blob.
p289
aa(lp290
VI give you Physarum polycephalum.
p291
aa(lp292
VThank you.

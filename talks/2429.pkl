VSo I'm a neurosurgeon.
p5
aVAnd like most of my colleagues,
p6
aVI have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.
p7
aVI realize how your life can change from one second to the other
p8
aVafter a major stroke or after a car accident.
p9
aVAnd what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons
p10
aVis to realize that unlike other organs of the body,
p11
aVthe brain has very little ability for self-repair.
p12
aVAnd after a major injury of your central nervous system,
p13
aVthe patients often remain with a severe handicap.
p14
aVAnd that's probably the reason why I've chosen
p15
aVto be a functional neurosurgeon.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhat is a functional neurosurgeon?
p18
aVIt's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function
p19
aVthrough different surgical strategies.
p20
aVYou've certainly heard of one of the famous ones
p21
aVcalled deep brain stimulation,
p22
aVwhere you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain
p23
aVin order to modulate a circuit of neurons
p24
aVto improve a neurological function.
p25
aVIt's really an amazing technology
p26
aVin that it has improved the destiny of patients
p27
aVwith Parkinson's disease,
p28
aVwith severe tremor, with severe pain.
p29
aVHowever, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.
p30
aVAnd the dream of functional neurosurgeons
p31
aVis to repair the brain.
p32
aVI think
p33
aVthat we are approaching this dream.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd I would like to show you
p36
aVthat we are very close to this.
p37
aVAnd that with a little bit of help,
p38
aVthe brain is able to help itself.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo the story started 15 years ago.
p41
aVAt that time, I was a chief resident
p42
aVworking days and nights in the emergency room.
p43
aVI often had to take care of patients with head trauma.
p44
aVYou have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma,
p45
aVhis brain is swelling
p46
aVand he's increasing his intracranial pressure.
p47
aVAnd in order to save his life,
p48
aVyou have to decrease this intracranial pressure.
p49
aVAnd to do that,
p50
aVyou sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.
p51
aVSo instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain,
p52
aVwe decided with Jean-François Brunet,
p53
aVwho is a colleague of mine, a biologist,
p54
aVto study them.
p55
aa(lp56
VWhat do I mean by that?
p57
aVWe wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.
p58
aVIt's not an easy task.
p59
aVGrowing cells from a piece of tissue
p60
aVis a bit the same as growing very small children
p61
aVout from their family.
p62
aVSo you need to find the right nutrients,
p63
aVthe warmth, the humidity
p64
aVand all the nice environments to make them thrive.
p65
aVSo that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
p66
aVAnd after many attempts,
p67
aVJean-François did it.
p68
aVAnd that's what he saw under his microscope.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd that was, for us, a major surprise.
p71
aVWhy?
p72
aVBecause this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture,
p73
aVwith large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.
p74
aVAnd you may remember from biology class
p75
aVthat stem cells are immature cells,
p76
aVable to turn into any type of cell of the body.
p77
aVThe adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare
p78
aVand they're located in deep and small niches
p79
aVin the depths of the brain.
p80
aVSo it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture
p81
aVfrom the superficial part of swollen brain we had
p82
aVin the operating theater.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd there was another intriguing observation:
p85
aVRegular stem cells are very active cells \u2014
p86
aVcells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.
p87
aVAnd they never die, they're immortal cells.
p88
aVBut these cells behave differently.
p89
aVThey divide slowly,
p90
aVand after a few weeks of culture,
p91
aVthey even died.
p92
aVSo we were in front of a strange new cell population
p93
aVthat looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd it took us a long time to understand where they came from.
p96
aVThey come from these cells.
p97
aVThese blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
p98
aVAll of you have them in your brain.
p99
aVThey represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.
p100
aVThey have a very important role during the development stage.
p101
aVWhen you were fetuses,
p102
aVthey helped your brain to fold itself.
p103
aVBut why do they stay in your head?
p104
aVThis, we don't know.
p105
aVWe think that they may participate in brain repair
p106
aVbecause we find them in higher concentration
p107
aVclose to brain lesions.
p108
aVBut it's not so sure.
p109
aVBut there is one clear thing \u2014
p110
aVthat from these cells,
p111
aVwe got our stem cell culture.
p112
aVAnd we were in front of a potential new source of cells
p113
aVto repair the brain.
p114
aVAnd we had to prove this.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo to prove it,
p117
aVwe decided to design an experimental paradigm.
p118
aVThe idea was to biopsy a piece of brain
p119
aVin a non-eloquent area of the brain,
p120
aVand then to culture the cells
p121
aVexactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab.
p122
aVAnd then label them, to put color in them
p123
aVin order to be able to track them in the brain.
p124
aVAnd the last step was to re-implant them
p125
aVin the same individual.
p126
aVWe call these
p127
aVautologous grafts \u2014 autografts.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo the first question we had,
p130
aV"What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain,
p131
aVand what will happen if we re-implant the same cells
p132
aVin a lesioned brain?"
p133
aVThanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller,
p134
aVwe worked with monkeys.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo in the first-case scenario,
p137
aVwe re-implanted the cells in the normal brain
p138
aVand what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks,
p139
aVas if they were taken from the brain,
p140
aVthey go back home,
p141
aVthe space is already busy,
p142
aVthey are not needed there, so they disappear.
p143
aa(lp144
VIn the second-case scenario,
p145
aVwe performed the lesion,
p146
aVwe re-implanted exactly the same cells,
p147
aVand in this case, the cells remained \u2014
p148
aVand they became mature neurons.
p149
aVAnd that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.
p150
aVThose are the cells that were re-implanted.
p151
aVAnd the proof they carry,
p152
aVthese little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled
p153
aVin vitro, when they were in culture.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut we could not stop here, of course.
p156
aVDo these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?
p157
aVSo for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.
p158
aVThey had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.
p159
aVThey were very good at it.
p160
aVAnd when they had reached a plateau of performance,
p161
aVwe did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.
p162
aVSo the monkeys were plegic,
p163
aVthey could not move their hand anymore.
p164
aVAnd exactly the same as humans would do,
p165
aVthey spontaneously recovered to a certain extent,
p166
aVexactly the same as after a stroke.
p167
aVPatients are completely plegic,
p168
aVand then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism,
p169
aVthey recover to a certain extent,
p170
aVexactly the same for the monkey.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau
p173
aVof spontaneous recovery,
p174
aVwe implanted his own cells.
p175
aVSo on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.
p176
aVHe's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance
p177
aVbefore the lesion.
p178
aVHe's not so accurate, not so quick.
p179
aVAnd look now when we re-implant the cells:
p180
aVTwo months after re-implantation, the same individual.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Applause)
p183
aa(lp184
VIt was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.
p185
aVSince that time, we've understood much more about these cells.
p186
aVWe know that we can cryopreserve them,
p187
aVwe can use them later on.
p188
aVWe know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models,
p189
aVlike Parkinson's disease, for example.
p190
aVBut our dream is still to implant them in humans.
p191
aVAnd I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon
p192
aVthat the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.
p193
aa(lp194
VThank you.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Applause)
p197
aa(lp198
VBruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,
p199
aVand I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience,
p200
aVpossibly even a majority,
p201
aVwho are thinking, "I know somebody who can use this."
p202
aVI do, in any case.
p203
aVAnd of course the question is,
p204
aVwhat are the biggest obstacles
p205
aVbefore you can go into human clinical trials?
p206
aa(lp207
VJocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations. (Laughs)
p208
aVSo, from these exciting results, you need to fill out
p209
aVabout two kilograms of papers and forms
p210
aVto be able to go through these kind of trials.
p211
aa(lp212
VBG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.
p213
aa(lp214
VJB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time
p215
aVand a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?
p216
aa(lp217
VBG: If you project yourself \u2014
p218
aVhaving done the research
p219
aVand having tried to get permission to start the trials,
p220
aVif you project yourself out in time,
p221
aVhow many years before somebody gets into a hospital
p222
aVand this therapy is available?
p223
aa(lp224
VJB: So, it's very difficult to say.
p225
aVIt depends, first, on the approval of the trial.
p226
aVWill the regulation allow us to do it soon?
p227
aVAnd then, you have to perform this kind of study
p228
aVin a small group of patients.
p229
aVSo it takes, already, a long time to select the patients,
p230
aVdo the treatment
p231
aVand evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment.
p232
aVAnd then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial.
p233
aVYou have to really prove first that it's useful
p234
aVbefore offering this treatment up for everybody.
p235
aa(lp236
VBG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.
p237
aa(lp238
VBG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.
p239
aVBG: Thank you.

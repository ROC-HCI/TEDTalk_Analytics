VSo, this is my grandfather,
p5
aVSalman Schocken,
p6
aVwho was born into a poor and uneducated family
p7
aVwith six children to feed,
p8
aVand when he was 14 years old, he was forced to
p9
aVdrop out of school in order to help put bread on the table.
p10
aVHe never went back to school.
p11
aVInstead, he went on to build a glittering empire
p12
aVof department stores.
p13
aVSalman was the consummate perfectionist,
p14
aVand every one of his stores was a jewel
p15
aVof Bauhaus architecture.
p16
aVHe was also the ultimate self-learner,
p17
aVand like everything else, he did it in grand style.
p18
aVHe surrounded himself with an entourage
p19
aVof young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber
p20
aVand Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka,
p21
aVand he paid each one of them a monthly salary
p22
aVso that they could write in peace.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming.
p25
aVHe fled Germany, together with his family,
p26
aVleaving everything else behind.
p27
aVHis department stores confiscated,
p28
aVhe spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit
p29
aVof art and culture.
p30
aVThis high school dropout
p31
aVdied at the age of 82,
p32
aVa formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO
p33
aVof the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
p34
aVand founder of Schocken Books,
p35
aVan acclaimed imprint that was later acquired
p36
aVby Random House.
p37
aVSuch is the power of self-study.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd these are my parents.
p40
aVThey too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.
p41
aVThey were too busy building a family and a country.
p42
aVAnd yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong,
p43
aVtenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked
p44
aVwith thousands of books, records and artwork.
p45
aVI remember quite vividly my father telling me
p46
aVthat when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set,
p47
aVthen we'll buy a normal F.M. radio. (Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd that's me,
p50
aVI was going to say holding my first abacus,
p51
aVbut actually holding what my father would consider
p52
aVan ample substitute to an iPad. (Laughter)
p53
aVSo one thing that I took from home is this notion
p54
aVthat educators don't necessarily have to teach.
p55
aVInstead, they can provide an environment and resources
p56
aVthat tease out your natural ability to learn on your own.
p57
aVSelf-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment:
p58
aVthese are the virtues of a great education.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I'd like to share with you a story about a self-study,
p61
aVself-empowering computer science course
p62
aVthat I built, together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan.
p63
aVAs you can see from the pictures, both Noam and I
p64
aVhad an early fascination with first principles,
p65
aVand over the years, as our knowledge of
p66
aVscience and technology became more sophisticated,
p67
aVthis early awe with the basics
p68
aVhas only intensified.
p69
aVSo it's not surprising that, about 12 years ago, when
p70
aVNoam and I were already computer science professors,
p71
aVwe were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon.
p72
aVAs computers became increasingly more complex,
p73
aVour students were losing the forest for the trees,
p74
aVand indeed, it is impossible to connect
p75
aVwith the soul of the machine if you interact
p76
aVwith a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded
p77
aVby numerous layers of closed, proprietary software.
p78
aVSo Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students
p79
aVto understand how computers work,
p80
aVand understand it in the marrow of their bones,
p81
aVthen perhaps the best way to go about it
p82
aVis to have them build a complete, working,
p83
aVgeneral-purpose, useful computer, hardware and software,
p84
aVfrom the ground up, from first principles.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, we had to start somewhere, and so Noam and I
p87
aVdecided to base our cathedral, so to speak,
p88
aVon the simplest possible building block,
p89
aVwhich is something called NAND.
p90
aVIt is nothing more than a trivial logic gate
p91
aVwith four input-output states.
p92
aVSo we now start this journey by telling our students
p93
aVthat God gave us NAND \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p94
aVand told us to build a computer, and when we asked how,
p95
aVGod said, "One step at a time."
p96
aVAnd then, following this advice, we start
p97
aVwith this lowly, humble NAND gate,
p98
aVand we walk our students through an elaborate sequence
p99
aVof projects in which they gradually build a chip set,
p100
aVa hardware platform, an assembler, a virtual machine,
p101
aVa basic operating system and a compiler
p102
aVfor a simple, Java-like language that we call "JACK."
p103
aVThe students celebrate the end of this tour de force
p104
aVby using JACK to write all sorts of cool games
p105
aVlike Pong, Snake and Tetris.
p106
aVYou can imagine the tremendous joy of playing
p107
aVwith a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK
p108
aVand then compiled into machine language in a compiler
p109
aVthat you wrote also, and then seeing the result
p110
aVrunning on a machine that you built starting
p111
aVwith nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates.
p112
aVIt's a tremendous personal triumph of going
p113
aVfrom first principles all the way to a fantastically complex
p114
aVand useful system.
p115
aa(lp116
VNoam and I worked five years to facilitate
p117
aVthis ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure
p118
aVthat will enable students to build it in one semester.
p119
aVAnd this is the great team that helped us make it happen.
p120
aVThe trick was to decompose the computer's construction
p121
aVinto numerous stand-alone modules,
p122
aVeach of which could be individually specified,
p123
aVbuilt and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project.
p124
aVAnd from day one, Noam and I decided to put
p125
aVall these building blocks freely available in open source
p126
aVon the Web.
p127
aVSo chip specifications, APIs, project descriptions,
p128
aVsoftware tools, hardware simulators, CPU emulators,
p129
aVstacks of hundreds of slides, lectures \u2014
p130
aVwe laid out everything on the Web
p131
aVand invited the world to come over,
p132
aVtake whatever they need,
p133
aVand do whatever they want with it.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd then something fascinating happened.
p136
aVThe world came.
p137
aVAnd in short order, thousands of people
p138
aVwere building our machine.
p139
aVAnd NAND2Tetris became one of the first
p140
aVmassive, open, online courses,
p141
aValthough seven years ago we had no idea that what
p142
aVwe were doing is called MOOCs.
p143
aVWe just observed how self-organized courses
p144
aVwere kind of spontaneously spawning
p145
aVout of our materials.
p146
aVFor example, Pramode C.E.,
p147
aVan engineer from Kerala, India,
p148
aVhas organized groups of self-learners
p149
aVwho build our computer under his good guidance.
p150
aVAnd Parag Shah, another engineer, from Mumbai,
p151
aVhas unbundled our projects into smaller,
p152
aVmore manageable bites that he now serves
p153
aVin his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program.
p154
aa(lp155
VThe people who are attracted to these courses
p156
aVtypically have a hacker mentality.
p157
aVThey want to figure out how things work,
p158
aVand they want to do it in groups,
p159
aVlike this hackers club in Washington, D.C.,
p160
aVthat uses our materials to offer community courses.
p161
aVAnd because these materials are widely available
p162
aVand open-source, different people take them
p163
aVto very different and unpredictable directions.
p164
aVFor example, Yu Fangmin, from Guangzhou,
p165
aVhas used FPGA technology
p166
aVto build our computer and show others how to do the same
p167
aVusing a video clip, and Ben Craddock developed
p168
aVa very nice computer game that unfolds
p169
aVinside our CPU architecture, which is quite a complex
p170
aV3D maze that Ben developed
p171
aVusing the Minecraft 3D simulator engine.
p172
aVThe Minecraft community went bananas over this project,
p173
aVand Ben became an instant media celebrity.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd indeed, for quite a few people,
p176
aVtaking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will,
p177
aVhas turned into a life-changing experience.
p178
aVFor example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music
p179
aVand math major from East Lansing, Michigan.
p180
aVA few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post
p181
aVon our website, and I'd like to read it to you.
p182
aVSo here's what Dan said.
p183
aa(lp184
V"I did the coursework because understanding computers
p185
aVis important to me, just like literacy and numeracy,
p186
aVand I made it through. I never worked harder on anything,
p187
aVnever been challenged to this degree.
p188
aVBut given what I now feel capable of doing,
p189
aVI would certainly do it again.
p190
aVTo anyone considering NAND2Tetris,
p191
aVit's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed."
p192
aa(lp193
VSo Dan demonstrates the many self-learners
p194
aVwho take this course off the Web, on their own traction,
p195
aVon their own initiative, and it's quite amazing because
p196
aVthese people cannot care less about
p197
aVgrades.
p198
aVThey are doing it because of one motivation only.
p199
aVThey have a tremendous passion to learn.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd with that in mind,
p202
aVI'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.
p203
aVI'm sick of it.
p204
aVWe are obsessed with grades
p205
aVbecause we are obsessed with data,
p206
aVand yet grading takes away all the fun from failing,
p207
aVand a huge part of education
p208
aVis about failing.
p209
aVCourage, according to Churchill,
p210
aVis the ability to go from one defeat to another
p211
aVwithout losing enthusiasm. (Laughter)
p212
aVAnd [Joyce] said that mistakes
p213
aVare the portals of discovery.
p214
aVAnd yet we don't tolerate mistakes,
p215
aVand we worship grades.
p216
aVSo we collect your B pluses and your A minuses
p217
aVand we aggregate them into a number like 3.4,
p218
aVwhich is stamped on your forehead
p219
aVand sums up who you are.
p220
aVWell, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense,
p221
aVand grading became degrading.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo with that, I'd like to say a few words about upgrading,
p224
aVand share with you a glimpse from my current project,
p225
aVwhich is different from the previous one,
p226
aVbut it shares exactly the same characteristics
p227
aVof self-learning, learning by doing,
p228
aVself-exploration and community-building,
p229
aVand this project deals with K-12 math education,
p230
aVbeginning with early age math,
p231
aVand we do it on tablets because we believe that
p232
aVmath, like anything else, should be taught hands on.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo here's what we do. Basically, we developed
p235
aVnumerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining
p236
aVa particular concept in math.
p237
aVSo for example, let's take area.
p238
aVWhen you deal with a concept like area \u2014
p239
aVwell, we also provide a set of tools that the child
p240
aVis invited to experiment with in order to learn.
p241
aVSo if area is what interests us, then one thing
p242
aVwhich is natural to do is to tile the area
p243
aVof this particular shape and simply count
p244
aVhow many tiles it takes to cover it completely.
p245
aVAnd this little exercise here gives you a first
p246
aVgood insight of the notion of area.
p247
aa(lp248
VMoving along, what about the area of this figure?
p249
aVWell, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it.
p250
aVSo instead, you can experiment
p251
aVwith these different tools here by some process
p252
aVof guided trial and error,
p253
aVand at some point you will discover that one thing
p254
aVthat you can do among several legitimate transformations
p255
aVis the following one. You can cut the figure,
p256
aVyou can rearrange the parts, you can glue them
p257
aVand then proceed to tile just like we did before.
p258
aV(Applause)
p259
aVNow this particular transformation
p260
aVdid not change the area of the original figure,
p261
aVso a six-year-old who plays with this
p262
aVhas just discovered a clever algorithm
p263
aVto compute the area of any given parallelogram.
p264
aa(lp265
VWe don't replace teachers, by the way.
p266
aVWe believe that teachers should be empowered, not replaced.
p267
aa(lp268
VMoving along, what about the area of a triangle?
p269
aVSo after some guided trial and error,
p270
aVthe child will discover, with or without help,
p271
aVthat he or she can duplicate the original figure
p272
aVand then take the result, transpose it,
p273
aVglue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before:
p274
aVcut, rearrange, paste \u2014 oops\u2014 paste and glue,
p275
aVand tile.
p276
aVNow this transformation has doubled the area
p277
aVof the original figure, and therefore we have just learned
p278
aVthat the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle
p279
aVdivided by two.
p280
aVBut we discovered it by self-exploration.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo, in addition to learning some useful geometry,
p283
aVthe child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated
p284
aVscience strategies, like reduction,
p285
aVwhich is the art of
p286
aVtransforming a complex problem into a simple one,
p287
aVor generalization, which is at the heart
p288
aVof any scientific discipline,
p289
aVor the fact that some properties are invariant
p290
aVunder some transformations.
p291
aVAnd all this is something that a very young child
p292
aVcan pick up using such mobile apps.
p293
aVSo presently, we are doing the following:
p294
aVFirst of all, we are decomposing the K-12 math curriculum
p295
aVinto numerous such apps.
p296
aVAnd because we cannot do it on our own,
p297
aVwe've developed a very fancy authoring tool
p298
aVthat any author, any parent or actually anyone
p299
aVwho has an interest in math education,
p300
aVcan use this authoring tool to develop similar apps
p301
aVon tablets without programming.
p302
aVAnd finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem
p303
aVthat will match different learners
p304
aVwith different apps according to their evolving learning style.
p305
aa(lp306
VThe driving force behind this project
p307
aVis my colleague Shmulik London,
p308
aVand, you see, just like
p309
aVSalman did about 90 years ago,
p310
aVthe trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people,
p311
aVbecause at the end,
p312
aVit's all about people.
p313
aVAnd a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv
p314
aVand I saw this graffiti on a wall,
p315
aVand I found it so compelling
p316
aVthat by now I preach it to my students,
p317
aVand I'd like to try to preach it to you.
p318
aVNow, I don't know how many people here are familiar
p319
aVwith the term "mensch."
p320
aVIt basically means to be human
p321
aVand to do the right thing.
p322
aVAnd with that, what this graffiti says is,
p323
aV"High-tech schmigh-tech.
p324
aVThe most important thing is to be a mensch." (Laughter)
p325
aVThank you. (Applause)

helped found in 1995. He&#39;s also taught at NYU, Harvard and Stanford.

Offered in 2005, this led to one of the first successful open online courses. Now, courses based on the approach are offered by traditional universities as well as in crowd-sourced settings, and have been taken freely by thousands of self-learners over the web. Registration, lecture and project schedules are managed by volunteer course coordinators, and student questions are answered by the course alumni community. </p><p><br />His current project focuses on developing instructional materials for early-age math education, which he thinks can be transformed using low-cost tablet computers.

VIt's very nice to be here tonight.
p5
aa(lp6
VSo I've been working on the history of income
p7
aVand wealth distribution for the past 15 years,
p8
aVand one of the interesting lessons
p9
aVcoming from this historical evidence
p10
aVis indeed that, in the long run,
p11
aVthere is a tendency for  the rate of return of capital
p12
aVto exceed the economy's growth rate,
p13
aVand this tends to lead to  high concentration of wealth.
p14
aVNot infinite concentration of wealth,
p15
aVbut the higher the gap between r and g,
p16
aVthe higher the level of inequality of wealth
p17
aVtowards which society tends to converge.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo this is a key force that I'm going to talk about today,
p20
aVbut let me say right away
p21
aVthat this is not the only important force
p22
aVin the dynamics of income  and wealth distribution,
p23
aVand there are many other forces that play
p24
aVan important role in the long-run dynamics
p25
aVof income and wealth distribution.
p26
aVAlso there is a lot of data
p27
aVthat still needs to be collected.
p28
aVWe know a little bit more today
p29
aVthan we used to know,  but we still know too little,
p30
aVand certainly there are  many different processes \u2014
p31
aVeconomic, social, political \u2014
p32
aVthat need to be studied more.
p33
aVAnd so I'm going to focus today on this simple force,
p34
aVbut that doesn't mean that other important forces
p35
aVdo not exist.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo most of the data I'm going to present
p38
aVcomes from this database
p39
aVthat's available online:
p40
aVthe World Top Incomes Database.
p41
aVSo this is the largest existing
p42
aVhistorical database on inequality,
p43
aVand this comes from the effort
p44
aVof over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.
p45
aVSo let me show you a couple of facts
p46
aVcoming from this database,
p47
aVand then we'll return to r bigger than g.
p48
aVSo fact number one is that there has been
p49
aVa big reversal in the ordering of income inequality
p50
aVbetween the United States and Europe
p51
aVover the past century.
p52
aVSo back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually
p53
aVmuch higher in Europe than in the United States,
p54
aVwhereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States.
p55
aVSo let me be very clear:
p56
aVThe main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.
p57
aVIt has more to do with changing supply and demand
p58
aVfor skill, the race between education and technology,
p59
aVglobalization, probably more unequal access
p60
aVto skills in the U.S.,
p61
aVwhere you have very good, very top universities
p62
aVbut where the bottom part of the educational system
p63
aVis not as good,
p64
aVso very unequal access to skills,
p65
aVand also an unprecedented rise
p66
aVof top managerial compensation of the United States,
p67
aVwhich is difficult to account for just on the basis of education.
p68
aVSo there is more going on here,
p69
aVbut I'm not going to talk too much about this today,
p70
aVbecause I want to focus on wealth inequality.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo let me just show you a very simple indicator
p73
aVabout the income inequality part.
p74
aVSo this is the share of total income
p75
aVgoing to the top 10 percent.
p76
aVSo you can see that one century ago,
p77
aVit was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe
p78
aVand a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S.,
p79
aVso there was more inequality in Europe.
p80
aVThen there was a sharp decline
p81
aVduring the first half of the 20th century,
p82
aVand in the recent decade, you can see that
p83
aVthe U.S. has become more unequal than Europe,
p84
aVand this is the first fact I just talked about.
p85
aVNow, the second fact is more about wealth inequality,
p86
aVand here the central fact is that wealth inequality
p87
aVis always a lot higher than income inequality,
p88
aVand also that wealth inequality,
p89
aValthough it has also increased in recent decades,
p90
aVis still less extreme today
p91
aVthan what it was a century ago,
p92
aValthough the total quantity of wealth
p93
aVrelative to income has now recovered
p94
aVfrom the very large shocks
p95
aVcaused by World War I, the Great Depression,
p96
aVWorld War II.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo let me show you two graphs
p99
aVillustrating fact number two and fact number three.
p100
aVSo first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality,
p101
aVthis is the share of total wealth
p102
aVgoing to the top 10 percent of wealth holders,
p103
aVso you can see the same kind of reversal
p104
aVbetween the U.S. and Europe that we had before
p105
aVfor income inequality.
p106
aVSo wealth concentration was higher
p107
aVin Europe than in the U.S. a century ago,
p108
aVand now it is the opposite.
p109
aVBut you can also show two things:
p110
aVFirst, the general level of wealth inequality
p111
aVis always higher than income inequality.
p112
aVSo remember, for income inequality,
p113
aVthe share going to the top 10 percent
p114
aVwas between 30 and 50 percent of total income,
p115
aVwhereas for wealth, the share is always
p116
aVbetween 60 and 90 percent.
p117
aVOkay, so that's fact number one,
p118
aVand that's very important for what follows.
p119
aVWealth concentration is always
p120
aVa lot higher than income concentration.
p121
aa(lp122
VFact number two is that the rise
p123
aVin wealth inequality in recent decades
p124
aVis still not enough to get us back to 1910.
p125
aVSo the big difference today,
p126
aVwealth inequality is still very large,
p127
aVwith 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10,
p128
aVbut the good news is that it's actually
p129
aVbetter than one century ago,
p130
aVwhere you had 90 percent in Europe going to the top 10.
p131
aVSo today what you have
p132
aVis what I call the middle 40 percent,
p133
aVthe people who are not in the top 10
p134
aVand who are not in the bottom 50,
p135
aVand what you can view as the wealth middle class
p136
aVthat owns 20 to 30 percent
p137
aVof total wealth, national wealth,
p138
aVwhereas they used to be poor, a century ago,
p139
aVwhen there was basically no wealth middle class.
p140
aVSo this is an important change,
p141
aVand it's interesting to see that wealth inequality
p142
aVhas not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels,
p143
aValthough the total quantity of wealth has recovered.
p144
aVOkay? So this is the total value
p145
aVof wealth relative to income,
p146
aVand you can see that in particular in Europe,
p147
aVwe are almost back to the pre-World War I level.
p148
aVSo there are really two
p149
aVdifferent parts of the story here.
p150
aVOne has to do with
p151
aVthe total quantity of wealth that we accumulate,
p152
aVand there is nothing bad per se, of course,
p153
aVin accumulating a lot of wealth,
p154
aVand in particular if it is more diffuse
p155
aVand less concentrated.
p156
aVSo what we really want to focus on
p157
aVis the long-run evolution of wealth inequality,
p158
aVand what's going to happen in the future.
p159
aVHow can we account for the fact that
p160
aVuntil World War I, wealth inequality was so high
p161
aVand, if anything, was rising to even higher levels,
p162
aVand how can we think about the future?
p163
aa(lp164
VSo let me come to some of the explanations
p165
aVand speculations about the future.
p166
aVLet me first say that
p167
aVprobably the best model to explain
p168
aVwhy wealth is so much
p169
aVmore concentrated than income
p170
aVis a dynamic, dynastic model
p171
aVwhere individuals have a long horizon
p172
aVand accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons.
p173
aVIf people were accumulating wealth
p174
aVonly for life cycle reasons,
p175
aVyou know, to be able to consume
p176
aVwhen they are old,
p177
aVthen the level of wealth inequality
p178
aVshould be more or less in line
p179
aVwith the level of income inequality.
p180
aVBut it will be very difficult to explain
p181
aVwhy you have so much more wealth inequality
p182
aVthan income inequality
p183
aVwith a pure life cycle model,
p184
aVso you need a story
p185
aVwhere people also care
p186
aVabout wealth accumulation for other reasons.
p187
aVSo typically, they want to transmit
p188
aVwealth to the next generation, to their children,
p189
aVor sometimes they want to accumulate wealth
p190
aVbecause of the prestige, the power that goes with wealth.
p191
aVSo there must be other reasons
p192
aVfor accumulating wealth than just life cycle
p193
aVto explain what we see in the data.
p194
aVNow, in a large class of dynamic models
p195
aVof wealth accumulation
p196
aVwith such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth,
p197
aVyou will have all sorts of random,
p198
aVmultiplicative shocks.
p199
aVSo for instance, some families
p200
aVhave a very large number of children,
p201
aVso the wealth will be divided.
p202
aVSome families have fewer children.
p203
aVYou also have shocks to rates of return.
p204
aVSome families make huge capital gains.
p205
aVSome made bad investments.
p206
aVSo you will always have some mobility
p207
aVin the wealth process.
p208
aVSome people will move up, some people will move down.
p209
aVThe important point is that,
p210
aVin any such model,
p211
aVfor a given variance of such shocks,
p212
aVthe equilibrium level of wealth inequality
p213
aVwill be a steeply rising function of r minus g.
p214
aVAnd intuitively, the reason why the difference
p215
aVbetween the rate of return to wealth
p216
aVand the growth rate is important
p217
aVis that initial wealth inequalities
p218
aVwill be amplified at a faster pace
p219
aVwith a bigger r minus g.
p220
aVSo take a simple example,
p221
aVwith r equals five percent and g equals one percent,
p222
aVwealth holders only need to reinvest
p223
aVone fifth of their capital income to ensure
p224
aVthat their wealth rises as fast
p225
aVas the size of the economy.
p226
aVSo this makes it easier
p227
aVto build and perpetuate large fortunes
p228
aVbecause you can consume four fifths,
p229
aVassuming zero tax,
p230
aVand you can just reinvest one fifth.
p231
aVSo of course some families will consume more than that,
p232
aVsome will consume less, so there will be
p233
aVsome mobility in the distribution,
p234
aVbut on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth,
p235
aVso this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow, you should not be surprised
p238
aVby the statement that r can be bigger than g forever,
p239
aVbecause, in fact, this is what happened
p240
aVduring most of the history of mankind.
p241
aVAnd this was in a way very obvious to everybody
p242
aVfor a simple reason, which is that growth
p243
aVwas close to zero percent
p244
aVduring most of the history of mankind.
p245
aVGrowth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent,
p246
aVbut very slow growth of population
p247
aVand output per capita,
p248
aVwhereas the rate of return on capital
p249
aVof course was not zero percent.
p250
aVIt was, for land assets, which was
p251
aVthe traditional form
p252
aVof assets in preindustrial societies,
p253
aVit was typically five percent.
p254
aVAny reader of Jane Austen would know that.
p255
aVIf you want an annual income of 1,000 pounds,
p256
aVyou should have a capital value
p257
aVof 20,000 pounds so that
p258
aVfive percent of 20,000 is 1,000.
p259
aVAnd in a way, this was
p260
aVthe very foundation of society,
p261
aVbecause r bigger than g
p262
aVwas what allowed holders of wealth and assets
p263
aVto live off their capital income
p264
aVand to do something else in life
p265
aVthan just to care about their own survival.
p266
aa(lp267
VNow, one important conclusion
p268
aVof my historical research is that
p269
aVmodern industrial growth did not change
p270
aVthis basic fact as much as one might have expected.
p271
aVOf course, the growth rate
p272
aVfollowing the Industrial Revolution
p273
aVrose, typically from zero to one to two percent,
p274
aVbut at the same time, the rate of return
p275
aVto capital also rose
p276
aVso that the gap between the two
p277
aVdid not really change.
p278
aVSo during the 20th century,
p279
aVyou had a very unique combination of events.
p280
aVFirst, a very low rate of return
p281
aVdue to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks,
p282
aVdestruction of wealth, inflation,
p283
aVbankruptcy during the Great Depression,
p284
aVand all of this reduced
p285
aVthe private rate of return to wealth
p286
aVto unusually low levels
p287
aVbetween 1914 and 1945.
p288
aVAnd then, in the postwar period,
p289
aVyou had unusually high growth rate,
p290
aVpartly due to the reconstruction.
p291
aVYou know, in Germany, in France, in Japan,
p292
aVyou had five percent growth rate
p293
aVbetween 1950 and 1980
p294
aVlargely due to reconstruction,
p295
aVand also due to very large demographic growth,
p296
aVthe Baby Boom Cohort effect.
p297
aVNow, apparently that's not going to last for very long,
p298
aVor at least the population growth
p299
aVis supposed to decline in the future,
p300
aVand the best projections we have is that
p301
aVthe long-run growth is going to be closer
p302
aVto one to two percent
p303
aVrather than four to five percent.
p304
aVSo if you look at this,
p305
aVthese are the best estimates we have
p306
aVof world GDP growth
p307
aVand rate of return on capital,
p308
aVaverage rates of return on capital,
p309
aVso you can see that during most
p310
aVof the history of mankind,
p311
aVthe growth rate was very small,
p312
aVmuch lower than the rate of return,
p313
aVand then during the 20th century,
p314
aVit is really the population growth,
p315
aVvery high in the postwar period,
p316
aVand the reconstruction process
p317
aVthat brought growth
p318
aVto a smaller gap with the rate of return.
p319
aVHere I use the United Nations population projections,
p320
aVso of course they are uncertain.
p321
aVIt could be that we all start
p322
aVhaving a lot of children in the future,
p323
aVand the growth rates are going to be higher,
p324
aVbut from now on,
p325
aVthese are the best projections we have,
p326
aVand this will make global growth
p327
aVdecline and the gap between
p328
aVthe rate of return go up.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow, the other unusual event
p331
aVduring the 20th century
p332
aVwas, as I said,
p333
aVdestruction, taxation of capital,
p334
aVso this is the pre-tax rate of return.
p335
aVThis is the after-tax rate of return,
p336
aVand after destruction,
p337
aVand this is what brought
p338
aVthe average rate of return
p339
aVafter tax, after destruction,
p340
aVbelow the growth rate during a long time period.
p341
aVBut without the destruction,
p342
aVwithout the taxation, this  would not have happened.
p343
aVSo let me say that the balance between
p344
aVreturns on capital and growth
p345
aVdepends on many different factors
p346
aVthat are very difficult to predict:
p347
aVtechnology and the development
p348
aVof capital-intensive techniques.
p349
aVSo right now, the most capital-intensive sectors
p350
aVin the economy are the real estate sector, housing,
p351
aVthe energy sector, but it could be in the future
p352
aVthat we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors
p353
aVand that this would be a bigger share
p354
aVof the total capital stock that it is today.
p355
aVWell, we are very far from this,
p356
aVand from now, what's going on
p357
aVin the real estate sector, the energy sector,
p358
aVis much more important for the total capital stock
p359
aVand capital share.
p360
aa(lp361
VThe other important issue
p362
aVis that there are scale effects in portfolio management,
p363
aVtogether with financial complexity,
p364
aVfinancial deregulation,
p365
aVthat make it easier to get higher rates of return
p366
aVfor a large portfolio,
p367
aVand this seems to be particularly strong
p368
aVfor billionaires, large capital endowments.
p369
aVJust to give you one example,
p370
aVthis comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings
p371
aVover the 1987-2013 period,
p372
aVand you can see the very top wealth holders
p373
aVhave been going up at six, seven percent per year
p374
aVin real terms above inflation,
p375
aVwhereas average income in the world,
p376
aVaverage wealth in the world,
p377
aVhave increased at only two percent per year.
p378
aVAnd you find the same
p379
aVfor large university endowments \u2014
p380
aVthe bigger the initial endowments,
p381
aVthe bigger the rate of return.
p382
aa(lp383
VNow, what could be done?
p384
aVThe first thing is that I think we need
p385
aVmore financial transparency.
p386
aVWe know too little about global wealth dynamics,
p387
aVso we need international transmission
p388
aVof bank information.
p389
aVWe need a global registry of financial assets,
p390
aVmore coordination on wealth taxation,
p391
aVand even wealth tax with a small tax rate
p392
aVwill be a way to produce information
p393
aVso that then we can adapt our policies
p394
aVto whatever we observe.
p395
aVAnd to some extent, the fight
p396
aVagainst tax havens
p397
aVand automatic transmission of information
p398
aVis pushing us in this direction.
p399
aVNow, there are other ways to redistribute wealth,
p400
aVwhich it can be tempting to use.
p401
aVInflation:
p402
aVit's much easier to print money
p403
aVthan to write a tax code, so that's very tempting,
p404
aVbut sometimes you don't know what you do with the money.
p405
aVThis is a problem.
p406
aVExpropriation is very tempting.
p407
aVJust when you feel some people get too wealthy,
p408
aVyou just expropriate them.
p409
aVBut this is not a very efficient way
p410
aVto organize a regulation of wealth dynamics.
p411
aVSo war is an even less efficient way,
p412
aVso I tend to prefer progressive taxation,
p413
aVbut of course, history \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p414
aVhistory will invent its own best ways,
p415
aVand it will probably involve
p416
aVa combination of all of these.
p417
aa(lp418
VThank you.
p419
aa(lp420
V(Applause)
p421
aa(lp422
VBruno Giussani: Thomas Piketty. Thank you.
p423
aa(lp424
VThomas, I want to ask you two or three questions,
p425
aVbecause it's impressive how you're in command of your data, of course,
p426
aVbut basically what you suggest is
p427
aVgrowing wealth concentration is kind of
p428
aVa natural tendency of capitalism,
p429
aVand if we leave it to its own devices,
p430
aVit may threaten the system itself,
p431
aVso you're suggesting that we need to act
p432
aVto implement policies that redistribute wealth,
p433
aVincluding the ones we just saw:
p434
aVprogressive taxation, etc.
p435
aVIn the current political context,
p436
aVhow realistic are those?
p437
aVHow likely do you think that it is
p438
aVthat they will be implemented?
p439
aa(lp440
VThomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think
p441
aVif you look back through time,
p442
aVthe history of income, wealth and taxation
p443
aVis full of surprise.
p444
aVSo I am not terribly impressed
p445
aVby those who know in advance
p446
aVwhat will or will not happen.
p447
aVI think one century ago,
p448
aVmany people would have said
p449
aVthat progressive income taxation would never happen
p450
aVand then it happened.
p451
aVAnd even five years ago,
p452
aVmany people would have said that bank secrecy
p453
aVwill be with us forever in Switzerland,
p454
aVthat Switzerland was too powerful
p455
aVfor the rest of the world,
p456
aVand then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions
p457
aVagainst Swiss banks for a big change to happen,
p458
aVand now we are moving toward
p459
aVmore financial transparency.
p460
aVSo I think it's not that difficult
p461
aVto better coordinate politically.
p462
aVWe are going to have a treaty
p463
aVwith half of the world GDP around the table
p464
aVwith the U.S. and the European Union,
p465
aVso if half of the world GDP is not enough
p466
aVto make progress on financial transparency
p467
aVand minimal tax for multinational corporate profits,
p468
aVwhat does it take?
p469
aVSo I think these are not technical difficulties.
p470
aVI think we can make progress
p471
aVif we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions
p472
aVand we have the proper sanctions
p473
aVon those who benefit from financial opacity.
p474
aa(lp475
VBG: One of the arguments
p476
aVagainst your point of view
p477
aVis that economic inequality
p478
aVis not only a feature of capitalism but is actually one of its engines.
p479
aVSo we take measures to lower inequality,
p480
aVand at the same time we lower growth, potentially.
p481
aVWhat do you answer to that?
p482
aa(lp483
VTP: Yeah, I think inequality
p484
aVis not a problem per se.
p485
aVI think inequality up to a point
p486
aVcan actually be useful for innovation and growth.
p487
aVThe problem is, it's a question of degree.
p488
aVWhen inequality gets too extreme,
p489
aVthen it becomes useless for growth
p490
aVand it can even become bad
p491
aVbecause it tends to lead to high perpetuation
p492
aVof inequality over time
p493
aVand low mobility.
p494
aVAnd for instance, the kind of wealth concentrations
p495
aVthat we had in the 19th century
p496
aVand pretty much until World War I
p497
aVin every European country
p498
aVwas, I think, not useful for growth.
p499
aVThis was destroyed by a combination
p500
aVof tragic events and policy changes,
p501
aVand this did not prevent growth from happening.
p502
aVAnd also, extreme inequality can be bad
p503
aVfor our democratic institutions
p504
aVif it creates very unequal access to political voice,
p505
aVand the influence of private money
p506
aVin U.S. politics, I think,
p507
aVis a matter of concern right now.
p508
aVSo we don't want to return to that kind of extreme,
p509
aVpre-World War I inequality.
p510
aVHaving a decent share of the national wealth
p511
aVfor the middle class is not bad for growth.
p512
aVIt is actually useful
p513
aVboth for equity and efficiency reasons.
p514
aa(lp515
VBG: I said at the beginning
p516
aVthat your book has been criticized.
p517
aVSome of your data has been criticized.
p518
aVSome of your choice of data sets has been criticized.
p519
aVYou have been accused of cherry-picking data
p520
aVto make your case. What do you answer to that?
p521
aa(lp522
VTP: Well, I answer that I am very happy
p523
aVthat this book is stimulating debate.
p524
aVThis is part of what it is intended for.
p525
aVLook, the reason why I put all the data online
p526
aVwith all of the detailed computation
p527
aVis so that we can have  an open and transparent
p528
aVdebate about this.
p529
aVSo I have responded point by point
p530
aVto every concern.
p531
aVLet me say that if I was to rewrite the book today,
p532
aVI would actually conclude
p533
aVthat the rise in wealth inequality,
p534
aVparticularly in the United States,
p535
aVhas been actually higher than what I report in my book.
p536
aVThere is a recent study by Saez and Zucman
p537
aVshowing, with new data
p538
aVwhich I didn't have at the time of the book,
p539
aVthat wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen
p540
aVeven more than what I report.
p541
aVAnd there will be other data in the future.
p542
aVSome of it will go in different directions.
p543
aVLook, we put online almost every week
p544
aVnew, updated series on the World Top Income Database
p545
aVand we will keep doing so in the future,
p546
aVin particular in emerging countries,
p547
aVand I welcome all of those who want to contribute
p548
aVto this data collection process.
p549
aVIn fact, I certainly agree
p550
aVthat there is not enough
p551
aVtransparency about wealth dynamics,
p552
aVand a good way to have better data
p553
aVwould be to have a wealth tax
p554
aVwith a small tax rate to begin with
p555
aVso that we can all agree
p556
aVabout this important evolution
p557
aVand adapt our policies to whatever we observe.
p558
aVSo taxation is a source of knowledge,
p559
aVand that's what we need the most right now.
p560
aa(lp561

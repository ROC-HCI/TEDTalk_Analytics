VI want to share some personal friends and stories with you
p5
aVthat I've actually never talked about in public before
p6
aVto help illustrate the idea
p7
aVand the need and the hope
p8
aVfor us to reinvent our health care system around the world.
p9
aVTwenty-four years ago, I had \u2014 a sophomore in college,
p10
aVI had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved.
p11
aVAnd I ended up in student health,
p12
aVand they ran some labwork and came back right away,
p13
aVand said, "Kidney problems."
p14
aVAnd before I knew it, I was involved and thrown into
p15
aVthis six months of tests and trials and tribulations
p16
aVwith six doctors across two hospitals
p17
aVin this clash of medical titans
p18
aVto figure out which one of them was right
p19
aVabout what was wrong with me.
p20
aVAnd I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound,
p21
aVand all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once,
p22
aVand I'm like, "Uh oh, this is bad news."
p23
aVAnd their diagnosis was this:
p24
aVThey said, "You have two rare kidney diseases
p25
aVthat are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually,
p26
aVyou have cancer-like cells in your immune system
p27
aVthat we need to start treatment right away,
p28
aVand you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant,
p29
aVand you're not likely to live more than two or three years."
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis,
p32
aVit just sucked me in immediately,
p33
aVas if I began preparing myself as a patient
p34
aVto die according to the schedule that they had just given to me,
p35
aVuntil I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room,
p36
aVwho became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day
p37
aVand took me off to the medical library
p38
aVand did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases,
p39
aVand said, "Eric, these people who get this
p40
aVare normally in their '70s and '80s.
p41
aVThey don't know anything about you. Wake up.
p42
aVTake control of your health and get on with your life."
p43
aVAnd I did.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, these people making these proclamations to me
p46
aVwere not bad people.
p47
aVIn fact, these professionals were miracle workers,
p48
aVbut they're working in a flawed, expensive system that's set up the wrong way.
p49
aVIt's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need.
p50
aVIt's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us.
p51
aVIt's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails,
p52
aVand so something either works or you die.
p53
aVAnd it's dependent on passive patients
p54
aVwho just take it and don't ask any questions.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow the problem with this model
p57
aVis that it's unsustainable globally.
p58
aVIt's unaffordable globally.
p59
aVWe need to invent what I call a personal health system.
p60
aVSo what does this personal health system look like,
p61
aVand what new technologies and roles is it going to entail?
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, I'm going to start by actually sharing with you
p64
aVa new friend of mine, Libby,
p65
aVsomebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months.
p66
aVThis is Libby, or actually, this is an ultrasound image of Libby.
p67
aVThis is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have.
p68
aVNow, this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today,
p69
aVand you'll notice, on the edge of this image,
p70
aVthere's some dark spots there, which was really concerning to me.
p71
aVSo we're going to actually do a live exam
p72
aVto sort of see how Libby's doing.
p73
aVThis is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here.
p74
aVDon't you in the front row worry or anything.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVI'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante.
p77
aVThis is a portable ultrasound.
p78
aVIt can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet.
p79
aVMobisante is up in Redmond, Washington,
p80
aVand they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself.
p81
aVThey're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this.
p82
aVThis is a concept demo, so I want to make that clear.
p83
aVAll right, I gotta gel up.
p84
aVNow the people in the front row are very nervous. (Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk,
p87
aVwho's another friend of mine.
p88
aVHe's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon.
p89
aVSo let me just make sure. Hey, Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay?
p90
aVAnd actually, can you see Libby?
p91
aa(lp92
VThomas Batuik: Hi there, Eric.
p93
aVYou look busy. How are you?
p94
aa(lp95
VEric Dishman: I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off
p96
aVin front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful.
p97
aVSo I just wanted to see, is this the image you need to get?
p98
aVAnd I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there.
p99
aa(lp100
VTB: Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here,
p101
aVgive me a lay of the land.
p102
aa(lp103
VED: All right.TB: Okay. Turn it a little bit inside,
p104
aVa little bit toward the middle for me.
p105
aVOkay, that's good. How about up a little bit?
p106
aVOkay, freeze that image. That's a good one for me.
p107
aa(lp108
VED: All right. Now last week, when I did this,
p109
aVyou had me measure that spot to the right.
p110
aVShould I do that again?
p111
aa(lp112
VTB: Yeah, let's do that.
p113
aa(lp114
VED: All right. This is kind of hard to do
p115
aVwith one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring,
p116
aVbut I've got it, I think,
p117
aVand I'll save that image and send it to you.
p118
aVSo tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means.
p119
aVIt's not something I was very happy about.
p120
aa(lp121
VTB: Many people after a kidney transplant
p122
aVwill develop a little fluid collection around the kidney.
p123
aVMost of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief,
p124
aVbut it does warrant looking at,
p125
aVso I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today,
p126
aVmake sure that it's not growing, it's not creating any problems.
p127
aVBased on the other images we have,
p128
aVI'm really happy how it looks today.
p129
aa(lp130
VED: All right. Well, I guess we'll double check it when I come in.
p131
aVI've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks,
p132
aVand I'm going to let you do that in the clinic,
p133
aVbecause I don't think I can do that one on myself.
p134
aa(lp135
VTB: Good choice.ED: All right, thanks, Dr. Batiuk.
p136
aVAll right. So what you're sort of seeing here
p137
aVis an example of disruptive technologies,
p138
aVof mobile, social and analytic technologies.
p139
aVThese are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow there's really three pillars
p142
aVof this personal health I want to talk to you about now,
p143
aVand it's care anywhere, care networking and care customization.
p144
aVAnd you just saw a little bit of the first two
p145
aVwith my interaction with Dr. Batiuk.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo let's start with care anywhere.
p148
aVHumans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics
p149
aVin the 1780s. It is time to update our thinking.
p150
aVWe have got to untether clinicians and patients
p151
aVfrom the notion of traveling to a special
p152
aVbricks-and-mortar place for all of our care,
p153
aVbecause these places are often the wrong tool,
p154
aVand the most expensive tool, for the job.
p155
aVAnd these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients,
p156
aVespecially in an era of superbugs
p157
aVand hospital-acquired infections.
p158
aVAnd many countries are going to go brickless from the start
p159
aVbecause they're never going to be able to afford
p160
aVthe mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built.
p161
aVNow I personally learned that hospitals
p162
aVcan be a very dangerous place at a young age.
p163
aVThis was me in third grade.
p164
aVI broke my elbow very seriously, had to have surgery,
p165
aVworried that they were going to actually lose the arm.
p166
aVRecovering from the surgery in the hospital, I get bedsores.
p167
aVThose bedsores become infected,
p168
aVand they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to,
p169
aVand now my whole body breaks out,
p170
aVand now all of those become infected.
p171
aVThe longer I stayed in the hospital, the sicker I became,
p172
aVand the more expensive it became,
p173
aVand this happens to millions of people around the world every year.
p174
aVThe future of personal health that I'm talking about
p175
aVsays care must occur at home as the default model,
p176
aVnot in a hospital or clinic.
p177
aVYou have to earn your way into those places
p178
aVby being sick enough to use that tool for the job.
p179
aVNow the smartphones that we're already carrying
p180
aVcan clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them,
p181
aVand a whole array of others, today,
p182
aVand as sensing is built into these,
p183
aVwe'll be able to do vital signs monitor
p184
aVand behavioral monitoring like we've never had before.
p185
aVMany of us will have implantables that will actually look
p186
aVreal-time at what's going on with our blood chemistry
p187
aVand in our proteins right now.
p188
aVNow the software is also getting smarter, right?
p189
aVThink about a coach, an agent online,
p190
aVthat's going to help me do safe self-care.
p191
aVThat same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound
p192
aVwill likely have real-time image processing,
p193
aVand the device will say, "Up, down, left, right,
p194
aVah, Eric, that's the perfect spot to send that image
p195
aVoff to your doctor."
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, if we've got all these networked devices
p198
aVthat are helping us to do care anywhere,
p199
aVit stands to reason that we also need a team
p200
aVto be able to interact with all of that stuff,
p201
aVand that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about,
p202
aVcare networking.
p203
aVWe have got to go beyond this paradigm
p204
aVof isolated specialists doing parts care
p205
aVto multidisciplinary teams doing person care.
p206
aVUncoordinated care today is expensive at best,
p207
aVand it is deadly at worst.
p208
aVEighty percent of medical errors are actually caused
p209
aVby communication and coordination problems
p210
aVamongst medical team members.
p211
aVI had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school,
p212
aVwhen we're under treatment for the kidney,
p213
aVand suddenly, they're like, "Oh, we think you have a heart problem."
p214
aVAnd I have these palpitations that are showing up.
p215
aVThey put me through five weeks of tests \u2014
p216
aVvery expensive, very scary \u2014 before the nurse finally notices
p217
aVthe piece of the paper, my meds list
p218
aVthat I've been carrying to every single appointment,
p219
aVand says, "Oh my gosh."
p220
aVThree different specialists had prescribed
p221
aVthree different versions of the same drug to me.
p222
aVI did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem.
p223
aVI had a care coordination problem.
p224
aVAnd this happens to millions of people every year.
p225
aVI want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen
p226
aVto make health care a coordinated team sport.
p227
aVNow this is the most frightening thing to me.
p228
aVOut of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world,
p229
aVthe first time I've ever had a true team-based care experience
p230
aVwas at Legacy Good Sam these last six months
p231
aVfor me to go get this.
p232
aVAnd this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy.
p233
aVThere's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk.
p234
aVWe just talked to him. Here's Jenny, one of the nurses,
p235
aVAllison, who helped manage the transplant list,
p236
aVand a dozen other people who aren't pictured,
p237
aVa pharmacist, a psychologist, a nutritionist,
p238
aVeven a financial counselor, Lisa,
p239
aVwho helped us deal with all the insurance hassles.
p240
aVI wept the day I graduated.
p241
aVI should have been happy, because I was so well
p242
aVthat I could go back to my normal doctors,
p243
aVbut I wept because I was so actually connected to this team.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd here's the most important part.
p246
aVThe other people in this picture are me and my wife, Ashley.
p247
aVLegacy trained us on how to do care for me at home
p248
aVso that they could offload the hospitals and clinics.
p249
aVThat's the only way that the model works.
p250
aVMy team is actually working in China
p251
aVon one of these self-care models
p252
aVfor a project we called Age-Friendly Cities.
p253
aVWe're trying to help build a social network
p254
aVthat can help track and train the care of seniors
p255
aVcaring for themselves
p256
aVas well as the care provided by their family members
p257
aVor volunteer community health workers,
p258
aVas well as have an exchange network online,
p259
aVwhere, for example, I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom,
p260
aVif somebody else can help me with transportation to meals,
p261
aVand we exchange all of that online.
p262
aVThe most important point I want to make to you about this
p263
aVis the sacred and somewhat over-romanticized
p264
aVdoctor-patient one-on-one
p265
aVis a relic of the past.
p266
aVThe future of health care is smart teams,
p267
aVand you'd better be on that team for yourself.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow, the last thing that I want to talk to you about
p270
aVis care customization,
p271
aVbecause if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking,
p272
aVthose are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system,
p273
aVbut there's still too much guesswork.
p274
aVRandomized clinical trials were actually invented in 1948
p275
aVto help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis,
p276
aVand those are important things, don't get me wrong.
p277
aVThese population studies that we've done have created
p278
aVtons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives,
p279
aVbut the problem is that health care
p280
aVis treating us as averages, not unique individuals,
p281
aVbecause at the end of the day,
p282
aVthe patient is not the same thing as the population
p283
aVwho are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork.
p284
aVThe technologies that are coming,
p285
aVhigh-performance computing, analytics,
p286
aVbig data that everyone's talking about,
p287
aVwill allow us to build predictive models for each of us
p288
aVas individual patients.
p289
aVAnd the magic here is, experiment on my avatar
p290
aVin software, not my body in suffering.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow, I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you
p293
aVof this kind of care customization on my own journey.
p294
aVThe first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago
p295
aVthat all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity.
p296
aVIt's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live.
p297
aVI was optimizing my life for quality of life,
p298
aVand quality of life for me means time in snow.
p299
aVSo on my chart, I forced them to put, "Patient goal:
p300
aVlow doses of drugs over longer periods of time,
p301
aVside effects friendly to skiing."
p302
aVAnd I think that's why I achieved longevity.
p303
aVI think that time-in-snow therapy was as important
p304
aVas the pharmaceuticals that I had.
p305
aVNow the second example of customization \u2014 and by the way,
p306
aVyou can't customize care if you don't know your own goals,
p307
aVso health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals.
p308
aVBut the second example I want to give you is,
p309
aVI happened to be an early guinea pig,
p310
aVand I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced.
p311
aVNow it took about two weeks of processing
p312
aVon Intel's highest-end servers to make this happen,
p313
aVand another six months of human and computing labor
p314
aVto make sense of all of that data.
p315
aVAnd at the end of all of that, they said, "Yes,
p316
aVthose diagnoses of that clash of medical titans
p317
aVall of those years ago were wrong,
p318
aVand we have a better path forward."
p319
aVThe future that Intel's working on now is to figure out
p320
aVhow to make that computing for personalized medicine
p321
aVgo from months and weeks to even hours,
p322
aVand make this kind of tool available,
p323
aVnot just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world,
p324
aVbut in the mainstream \u2014 every patient, every clinic
p325
aVwith access to whole genome sequencing.
p326
aVAnd I tell you, this kind of care customization
p327
aVfor everything from your goals to your genetics
p328
aVwill be the most game-changing transformation
p329
aVthat we witness in health care during our lifetime.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo these three pillars of personal health,
p332
aVcare anywhere, care networking, care customization,
p333
aVare happening in pieces now,
p334
aVbut this vision will completely fail if we don't step up
p335
aVas caregivers and as patients to take on new roles.
p336
aVIt's what my friend Verna said:
p337
aVWake up and take control of your health.
p338
aVBecause at the end of the day these technologies
p339
aVare simply about people caring for other people
p340
aVand ourselves in some powerful new ways.
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you
p343
aVto one last friend, very quickly.
p344
aVTracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney
p345
aVthat I was never supposed to have.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Applause)
p348
aa(lp349
VSo Tracey, just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you.
p350
aa(lp351
VTracey Gamley: For me, it was really easy.
p352
aVI only had one night in the hospital.
p353
aVThe surgery was done laparoscopically,
p354
aVso I have just five very small scars on my abdomen,
p355
aVand I had four weeks away from work
p356
aVand went back to doing everything I'd done before
p357
aVwithout any changes.
p358
aa(lp359
VED: Well, I probably will never get a chance to say this to you
p360
aVin such a large audience ever again.
p361
aVSo "thank you" feel likes a really trite word,
p362
aVbut thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Applause)
p365
aa(lp366
VThis TED stage and all of the TED stages
p367
aVare often about celebrating innovation
p368
aVand celebrating new technologies,
p369
aVand I've done that here today,
p370
aVand I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers,
p371
aVI mean, my gosh, artificial kidneys, even printable kidneys, that are coming.
p372
aVBut until such time that these amazing technologies
p373
aVare available to all of us, and even when they are,
p374
aVit's up to us to care for, and even save, one another.
p375
aVI hope you will go out and make personal health happen
p376
aVfor yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much.

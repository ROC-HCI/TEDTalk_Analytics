VIn the 1600s, there were so many right whales in Cape Cod Bay
p5
aVoff the east coast of the U.S.
p6
aVthat apparently you could walk across their backs
p7
aVfrom one end of the bay to the other.
p8
aVToday, they number in the hundreds, and they're endangered.
p9
aVLike them, many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced
p10
aVby 200 years of whaling,
p11
aVwhere they were hunted and killed for their whale meat, oil and whale bone.
p12
aa(lp13
VWe only have whales in our waters today
p14
aVbecause of the Save the Whales movement of the '70s.
p15
aVIt was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling,
p16
aVand was built on the idea that if we couldn't save whales,
p17
aVwhat could we save?
p18
aVIt was ultimately a test of our political ability
p19
aVto halt environmental destruction.
p20
aVSo in the early '80s, there was a ban on commercial whaling
p21
aVthat came into force as a result of this campaign.
p22
aVWhales in our waters are still low in numbers, however,
p23
aVbecause they do face a range of other human-induced threats.
p24
aa(lp25
VUnfortunately, many people still think that whale conservationists like myself
p26
aVdo what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful.
p27
aVThis is actually a disservice,
p28
aVbecause whales are ecosystem engineers.
p29
aVThey help maintain the stability and health of the oceans,
p30
aVand even provide services to human society.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo let's talk about why saving whales is critical
p33
aVto the resiliency of the oceans.
p34
aVIt boils down to two main things:
p35
aVwhale poop and rotting carcasses.
p36
aa(lp37
VAs whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe,
p38
aVthey actually release these enormous fecal plumes.
p39
aVThis whale pump, as it's called,
p40
aVactually brings essential limiting  nutrients from the depths
p41
aVto the surface waters where they  stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,
p42
aVwhich forms the base of all marine food chains.
p43
aVSo really, having more whales in the oceans pooping
p44
aVis really beneficial to the entire ecosystem.
p45
aa(lp46
VWhales are also known to undertake some  of the longest migrations of all mammals.
p47
aVGray whales off America migrate 16,000 kilometers
p48
aVbetween productive feeding areas and less productive calving, or birthing, areas
p49
aVand back every year.
p50
aVAs they do so, they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces
p51
aVfrom places that have it to places that need it.
p52
aVSo clearly, whales are really important in nutrient cycling,
p53
aVboth horizontally and vertically, through the oceans.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut what's really cool is that they're  also really important after they're dead.
p56
aVWhale carcasses are some of  the largest form of detritus
p57
aVto fall from the ocean's surface,  and they're called whale fall.
p58
aVAs these carcasses sink,
p59
aVthey provide a feast to some 400-odd species,
p60
aVincluding the eel-shaped, slime-producing  hagfish.
p61
aVSo over the 200 years of whaling,
p62
aVwhen we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans,
p63
aVwe likely altered the rate and geographic  distribution of these whale falls
p64
aVthat would descend into deep oceans,
p65
aVand as a result, probably led to a number of extinctions
p66
aVof species that were most specialized
p67
aVand dependent on these carcasses for their survival.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhale carcasses are also known to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon,
p70
aVwhich is the equivalent of that produced
p71
aVby 80,000 cars per year
p72
aVfrom the atmosphere to the deep oceans,
p73
aVand the deep oceans are what we call "carbon sinks,"
p74
aVbecause they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere,
p75
aVand therefore help to delay global warming.
p76
aVSometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches
p77
aVand provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental
p80
aVand caused a reduction in the populations of whales
p81
aVbetween 60 to 90 percent.
p82
aVClearly, the Save the Whales movement
p83
aVwas instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on,
p84
aVbut we need to revise this.
p85
aVWe need to address the more modern, pressing problems that these whales face
p86
aVin our waters today.
p87
aVAmongst other things, we need to stop them
p88
aVfrom getting plowed down by container  ships when they're in their feeding areas,
p89
aVand stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets
p90
aVas they float around in the ocean.
p91
aVWe also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages,
p92
aVso people really understand the true  ecosystem value of these creatures.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo, let's save the whales again,
p95
aVbut this time, let's not just  do it for their sake.
p96
aVLet's also do it for ours.
p97
aa(lp98
VThank you.

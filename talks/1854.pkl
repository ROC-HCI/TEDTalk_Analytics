VMy work focuses on the connection of
p5
aVboth thinking about our community life
p6
aVbeing part of the environment
p7
aVwhere architecture grows from the natural
p8
aVlocal conditions and traditions.
p9
aa(lp10
VToday I brought two recent projects
p11
aVas an example of this.
p12
aVBoth projects are in emerging countries,
p13
aVone in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.
p14
aVAnd also they have in common
p15
aVthat the different analyses from different perspectives
p16
aVbecomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
p17
aa(lp18
VThe first example started with an invitation
p19
aVto design a multistory shopping mall
p20
aVin Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.
p21
aVAnd this is the type of building
p22
aVwe were shown as an example, to my team and myself,
p23
aVof what we had to design.
p24
aVAt first, the first thing I thought was,
p25
aVI want to run away.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VAfter seeing a few of these buildings \u2014
p30
aVthere are many in the city \u2014
p31
aVwe realized that they have three very big points.
p32
aVFirst, these buildings, they are almost empty
p33
aVbecause they have very large shops
p34
aVwhere people cannot afford to buy things.
p35
aVSecond, they need tons of energy to perform
p36
aVbecause of the skin treatment with glass
p37
aVthat creates heat in the inside,
p38
aVand then you need a lot of cooling.
p39
aVIn a city where this shouldn't happen
p40
aVbecause they have really mild weather
p41
aVthat ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.
p42
aVAnd third is that their image has nothing to do
p43
aVwith Africa and with Ethiopia.
p44
aVIt is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.
p45
aa(lp46
VAlso during our first visit to Ethiopia,
p47
aVI was really captivated by the old merkato
p48
aVthat is this open-air structure
p49
aVwhere thousands of people, they go and buy things
p50
aVevery day from small vendors.
p51
aVAnd also it has this idea of the public space
p52
aVthat uses the outdoors to create activity.
p53
aVSo I thought, this is what I really want to design,
p54
aVnot a shopping mall.
p55
aVBut the question was how we could do a multistory,
p56
aVcontemporary building with these principles.
p57
aa(lp58
VThe next challenge was when we looked at the site,
p59
aVthat is, in a really growing area of the city,
p60
aVwhere most of these buildings that you see in the image,
p61
aVthey were not there.
p62
aVAnd it's also between two parallel streets
p63
aVthat don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo the first thing we did was to create a connection
p66
aVbetween these two streets,
p67
aVputting all the entrances of the building.
p68
aVAnd this extends with an inclined atrium
p69
aVthat creates an open-air space in the building
p70
aVthat self-protects itself with its own shape
p71
aVfrom the sun and the rain.
p72
aVAnd around this void
p73
aVwe placed this idea of the market with small shops,
p74
aVthat change in each floor because of the shape of the void.
p75
aa(lp76
VI also thought, how to close the building?
p77
aVAnd I really wanted to find a solution
p78
aVthat would respond to the local climate conditions.
p79
aVAnd I started thinking about the textile
p80
aVlike a shell made of concrete
p81
aVwith perforations that would let the air in,
p82
aVand also the light, but in a filtered way.
p83
aVAnd then the inspiration came from these beautiful  patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.
p84
aVThat they have fractal geometry properties
p85
aVand this helped me to shape the whole facade.
p86
aVAnd we are building that
p87
aVwith these small prefabricated pieces
p88
aVthat are the windows that let the air and the light
p89
aVin a controlled way inside the building.
p90
aVAnd this is complemented by these small colored glasses
p91
aVthat use the light from the inside of the building
p92
aVto light up the building at night.
p93
aa(lp94
VWith these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers
p95
aVbecause they were like,
p96
aV"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."
p97
aVBut then we all realized that this idea of the market
p98
aVhappened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall
p99
aVbecause basically they had more shops to sell.
p100
aVAnd also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,
p101
aVnot only because of the material compared with the glass,
p102
aVbut also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.
p103
aVSo we created some budget savings
p104
aVthat we used to implement the project.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd the first implementation was to think
p107
aVabout how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy
p108
aVin a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.
p109
aVSo we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.
p110
aVAnd then under those panels
p111
aVwe thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars
p112
aVthat would create this urban oasis.
p113
aVAnd these porches on the roof,
p114
aVall together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.
p115
aVHopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe second example is a master plan
p118
aVof 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.
p119
aVAnd for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,
p120
aVI really needed to understand the city of Tunis,
p121
aVbut also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.
p122
aa(lp123
VDuring that analysis I paid special attention to the medina
p124
aVthat is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,
p125
aVopened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.
p126
aVWhen I went to the site, the first design operation we did
p127
aVwas to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks
p128
aVsimilar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona
p129
aVand other cities in Europe with these courtyards.
p130
aVOn top of that, we selected some strategic points
p131
aVreminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,
p132
aVand this modified this initial pattern.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd the last operation was to think about the cell,
p135
aVthe small cell of the project, like the apartment,
p136
aVas an essential part of the master plan.
p137
aVAnd for that I thought, what would be the best orientation
p138
aVin the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?
p139
aVAnd it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house
p140
aVand then a natural ventilation.
p141
aVSo we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments
p142
aVare perfectly oriented in that direction.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd this is the result
p145
aVthat is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
p146
aVIt has these blocks with courtyards,
p147
aVand then on the ground floor
p148
aVyou have all these connections for the pedestrians.
p149
aVAnd also it responds to the local regulations that establish
p150
aVa higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
p151
aVAnd it also reinforces this idea of the gates.
p152
aa(lp153
VThe volume has this connecting shape
p154
aVthat shades itself with three different types of apartments
p155
aVand also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood
p156
aVAnd in the courtyards there are the different facilities,
p157
aVsuch as a gym and a kindergarten
p158
aVand close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.
p159
aVThe roof, which is my favorite space of the project
p160
aVis almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.
p161
aVAnd it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,
p162
aVand do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,
p163
aVjumping from one building to another.
p164
aa(lp165
VThese two examples,
p166
aVthey have a common approach in the design process.
p167
aVAnd also, they are in emerging countries where you can see
p168
aVthe cities literally growing.
p169
aVIn these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow
p170
aVchanges the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.
p171
aVFor this reason, I see even more importance
p172
aVto look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions
p173
aVthat enhance the relationship between the community and the environment
p174
aVand that aim to connect nature and people.
p175
aa(lp176
VThank you very much.

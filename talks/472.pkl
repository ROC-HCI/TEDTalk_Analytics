VI was raised in Seoul, Korea,
p5
aVand moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
p6
aVI was pre-med at the time,
p7
aVand I thought I would become a surgeon
p8
aVbecause I was interested in anatomy
p9
aVand dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
p10
aVAt the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
p11
aVI started to realize that I could look at the whole city
p12
aVas a living organism.
p13
aVI wanted to dissect it
p14
aVand look into its unseen layers.
p15
aVAnd the way to it, for me,
p16
aVwas through artistic means.
p17
aVSo, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.
p18
aVand in grad school I became interested
p19
aVin creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
p20
aa(lp21
VIn New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.
p22
aVMost people ignore them or are frightened of them.
p23
aVBut I took a liking to them
p24
aVbecause they dwell on the fringes of society.
p25
aVAnd even though they're used in labs to promote human lives,
p26
aVthey're also considered pests.
p27
aVI also started looking around in the city
p28
aVand trying to photograph them.
p29
aVOne day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks
p30
aVhoping to catch a rat or two,
p31
aVand a man came up to me and said,
p32
aV"You can't take photographs here.
p33
aVThe MTA will confiscate your camera."
p34
aVI was quite shocked by that,
p35
aVand thought to myself, "Well, OK then.
p36
aVI'll follow the rats."
p37
aVThen I started going into the tunnels,
p38
aVwhich made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city
p39
aVthat I never saw before and most people don't get to see.
p40
aa(lp41
VAround the same time, I met like-minded individuals
p42
aVwho call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers,
p43
aVguerrilla historians, etc.
p44
aVI was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network
p45
aVof people who regularly explore urban ruins
p46
aVsuch as abandoned subway stations,
p47
aVtunnels, sewers, aqueducts,
p48
aVfactories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.
p49
aa(lp50
VWhen I took photographs in these locations,
p51
aVI felt there was something missing in the pictures.
p52
aVSimply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures
p53
aVwasn't enough for me.
p54
aVSo I wanted to create a fictional character
p55
aVor an animal that dwells in these underground spaces,
p56
aVand the simplest way to do it, at the time,
p57
aVwas to model myself.
p58
aVI decided against clothing
p59
aVbecause I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications
p60
aVor time-specific elements.
p61
aVI wanted a simple way to represent a living body
p62
aVinhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.
p63
aa(lp64
VThis was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
p65
aVIt's now an empty, six-acre lot
p66
aVwaiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.
p67
aVI was very fond of this space
p68
aVbecause it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own
p69
aVthat is abandoned.
p70
aVWhen I first went in, I was scared,
p71
aVbecause I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
p72
aVBut they happened to be wild dogs living there,
p73
aVand it was right by the water,
p74
aVso there were swans and ducks swimming around
p75
aVand trees growing everywhere
p76
aVand bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.
p79
aVAnd, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture
p80
aVto become a part of that nature.
p81
aVWhen I got comfortable in the space,
p82
aVit also felt like a big playground.
p83
aVI would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams
p84
aVas if I went back in time and became a child again.
p85
aa(lp86
VThis was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct,
p87
aVwhich supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
p88
aVThe construction began in 1837.
p89
aVIt lasted about five years.
p90
aVIt got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.
p91
aVWhen you go into spaces like this,
p92
aVyou're directly accessing the past,
p93
aVbecause they sit untouched for decades.
p94
aVI love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
p95
aVInstead of looking at reproductions of it at home,
p96
aVyou're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks
p97
aVand shimmying up and down narrow cracks
p98
aVand getting wet and muddy
p99
aVand walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
p100
aa(lp101
VThis is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
p102
aVIt was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
p103
aVThe murals were done by a graffiti artist
p104
aVto commemorate the hundreds of homeless people
p105
aVthat got relocated from the tunnel in 1991
p106
aVwhen the tunnel reopened for trains.
p107
aVWalking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
p108
aVThere's nobody around you,
p109
aVand you hear the kids playing in the park above you,
p110
aVcompletely unaware of what's underneath.
p111
aa(lp112
VWhen I was going out a lot to these places,
p113
aVI was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation
p114
aVbecause I was in a solitary phase in my life,
p115
aVand I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen,"
p116
aVwhich references Charles Baudelaire.
p117
aV"Naked City" is a nickname for New York,
p118
aVand "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia
p119
aVthat come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.
p120
aa(lp121
VThis is the same tunnel.
p122
aVYou see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts
p123
aVand the train approaching.
p124
aa(lp125
VThis is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.
p126
aVI was there alone, setting up,
p127
aVand a homeless man approached.
p128
aVI was basically intruding in his living space.
p129
aVI was really frightened at first,
p130
aVbut I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project
p131
aVand he didn't seem to mind
p132
aVand so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer
p133
aVand ran back and forth.
p134
aVAnd when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt
p135
aVto wipe off my feet
p136
aVand kindly walked me out.
p137
aVIt must have been a very unusual day for him.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VOne thing that struck me, after this incident,
p141
aVwas that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
p142
aVThat homeless man, to me, really represented
p143
aVan element of the unconscious of the city.
p144
aVHe told me that he was abused above ground
p145
aVand was once in Riker's Island,
p146
aVand at last he found peace and quiet in that space.
p147
aVThe tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city,
p148
aVbut is now a sanctuary for outcasts,
p149
aVwho are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
p150
aa(lp151
VThis is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.
p152
aVThe tunnels are famous for having been used
p153
aVduring the development of the Manhattan Project.
p154
aVThis particular tunnel is interesting
p155
aVbecause it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum,
p156
aVwhich was demolished in 1890
p157
aVwhen Columbia moved in.
p158
aa(lp159
VThis is the New York City Farm Colony,
p160
aVwhich was a poorhouse in Staten Island
p161
aVfrom the 1890s to the 1930s.
p162
aVMost of my photos are set in places
p163
aVthat have been abandoned for decades,
p164
aVbut this is an exception.
p165
aa(lp166
VThis children's hospital was closed in 1997;
p167
aVit's located in Newark.
p168
aVWhen I was there three years ago,
p169
aVthe windows were broken and the walls were peeling,
p170
aVbut everything was left there as it was.
p171
aVYou see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines
p172
aVand even used utensils,
p173
aVwhich you see on the autopsy table.
p174
aa(lp175
VAfter exploring recently-abandoned buildings,
p176
aVI felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast:
p177
aVyour home, your office, a shopping mall, a church \u2014
p178
aVany man-made structures around you.
p179
aVI was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is
p180
aVand how vulnerable people truly are.
p181
aa(lp182
VI love to travel,
p183
aVand Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
p184
aVIt's full of history,
p185
aVand also full of underground bunkers
p186
aVand ruins from the war.
p187
aa(lp188
VThis was taken under a homeless asylum
p189
aVbuilt in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
p190
aVI saw the structure while I was on the train,
p191
aVand I got off at the next station and met people there
p192
aVthat gave me access to their catacomb-like basement,
p193
aVwhich was used for ammunition storage during the war
p194
aVand also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.
p195
aVThis is the actual catacombs in Paris.
p196
aVI explored there extensively
p197
aVin the off-limits areas
p198
aVand fell in love right away.
p199
aa(lp200
VThere are more than 185 miles of tunnels,
p201
aVand only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
p202
aVThe first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
p203
aVThey were consistently dug as limestone quarries
p204
aVand by the 18th century,
p205
aVthe caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats,
p206
aVso the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries
p207
aVand dug new observation tunnels
p208
aVin order to monitor and map the whole place.
p209
aa(lp210
VAs you can see, the system is very complex and vast.
p211
aVIt's very dangerous to get lost in there.
p212
aVAnd at the same time,
p213
aVthere was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.
p214
aVSo the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries,
p215
aVmaking them into the catacombs.
p216
aVThe remains of over six million people are housed in there,
p217
aVsome over 1,300 years old.
p218
aVThis was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery
p219
aVwhere most of the ossuaries are located.
p220
aVThere are also phone cables that were used in the '50s
p221
aVand many bunkers from the World War II era.
p222
aa(lp223
VThis is a German bunker.
p224
aVNearby there's a French bunker,
p225
aVand the whole tunnel system is so complex
p226
aVthat the two parties never met.
p227
aVThe tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance,
p228
aVwhich Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."
p229
aVAnd I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.
p230
aa(lp231
VAfter exploring the underground of Paris,
p232
aVI decided to climb up,
p233
aVand I climbed a Gothic monument
p234
aVthat's right in the middle of Paris.
p235
aVThis is the Tower of Saint Jacques.
p236
aVIt was built in the early 1500s.
p237
aVI don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.
p238
aVIt was not very comfortable. (Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd all this time,
p241
aVI never saw a single rat in any of these places,
p242
aVuntil recently, when I was in the London sewers.
p243
aVThis was probably the toughest place to explore.
p244
aVI had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes \u2014
p245
aVI guess, except for in this picture.
p246
aVAnd when the tides of waste matter come in
p247
aVit sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
p248
aa(lp249
VThis is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."
p250
aVI've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
p251
aVAnd the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd this is the first theater project I worked on.
p254
aVI adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.
p255
aVIt was performed last September one time only
p256
aVin the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn,
p257
aVwhich is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world,
p258
aVbuilt in 1844.
p259
aVI've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.
p260
aVBut whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.
p261
aa(lp262
VThe last place I visited
p263
aVwas the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.
p264
aVThis was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
p265
aa(lp266
VI like doing more than just exploring these spaces.
p267
aVI feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually
p268
aVin order to preserve their memories in a creative way \u2014
p269
aVbefore they're lost forever.
p270
aVThank you.

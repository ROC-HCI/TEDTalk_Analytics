VDo you remember the story
p5
aVof Odysseus and the Sirens
p6
aVfrom high school or junior high school?
p7
aVThere was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home
p8
aVafter the Trojan War.
p9
aVAnd he's standing on the deck of his ship,
p10
aVhe's talking to his first mate,
p11
aVand he's saying,
p12
aV"Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,
p13
aVand on those rocks sit some beautiful women
p14
aVcalled Sirens.
p15
aVAnd these women sing an enchanting song,
p16
aVa song so alluring
p17
aVthat all sailors who hear it
p18
aVcrash into the rocks and die."
p19
aVNow you would expect, given that,
p20
aVthat they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens,
p21
aVbut instead Odysseus says,
p22
aV"I want to hear that song.
p23
aVAnd so what I'm going to do
p24
aVis I'm going to pour wax in the ears
p25
aVof you and all the men \u2014
p26
aVstay with me \u2014
p27
aVso that you can't hear the song,
p28
aVand then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast
p29
aVso that I can listen
p30
aVand we can all sail by unaffected."
p31
aVSo this is a captain
p32
aVputting the life of every single person on the ship at risk
p33
aVso that he can hear a song.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd I'd like to think if this was the case,
p36
aVthey probably would have rehearsed it a few times.
p37
aVOdysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run.
p38
aVYou tie me to the mast, and I'm going to beg and plead.
p39
aVAnd no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast.
p40
aVAll right, so tie me to the mast."
p41
aVAnd the first mate takes a rope
p42
aVand ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot.
p43
aVAnd Odysseus does his best job playacting
p44
aVand says, "Untie me. Untie me.
p45
aVI want to hear that song. Untie me."
p46
aVAnd the first mate wisely resists
p47
aVand doesn't untie Odysseus.
p48
aVAnd then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it.
p49
aVAll right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner."
p50
aVAnd the first mate hesitates.
p51
aVHe's like, "Is this still the rehearsal,
p52
aVor should I untie him?"
p53
aVAnd the first mate thinks,
p54
aV"Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end."
p55
aVSo he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out.
p56
aVHe's like, "You idiot. You moron.
p57
aVIf you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead,
p58
aVevery single one of the men will be dead.
p59
aVNow just don't untie me no matter what."
p60
aVHe throws the first mate to the ground.
p61
aVThis repeats itself through the night \u2014
p62
aVrehearsal, tying to the mast,
p63
aVconning his way out of it,
p64
aVbeating the poor first mate up mercilessly.
p65
aVHilarity ensues.
p66
aa(lp67
VTying yourself to a mast
p68
aVis perhaps the oldest written example
p69
aVof what psychologists call a commitment device.
p70
aVA commitment device is a decision that you make
p71
aVwith a cool head to bind yourself
p72
aVso that you don't do something regrettable
p73
aVwhen you have a hot head.
p74
aVBecause there's two heads inside one person
p75
aVwhen you think about it.
p76
aVScholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves
p77
aVwhen it comes to questions of temptation.
p78
aVThere is first, the present self.
p79
aVThis is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song.
p80
aVHe just wants to get to the front row.
p81
aVHe just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.
p82
aVBut then there's this other self, the future self.
p83
aVThis is Odysseus as an old man
p84
aVwho wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa
p85
aVwith his wife Penelope
p86
aVoutside of Ithaca \u2014 the other one.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo why do we need commitment devices?
p89
aVWell resisting temptation is hard,
p90
aVas the 19th century English economist
p91
aVNassau William Senior said,
p92
aV"To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power,
p93
aVor to seek distant rather than immediate results,
p94
aVare among the most painful exertions
p95
aVof the human will."
p96
aVIf you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people,
p97
aVyou probably realize
p98
aVit's not that your goals are physically impossible
p99
aVthat's keeping you from achieving them,
p100
aVit's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.
p101
aVIt's physically possible to lose weight.
p102
aVIt's physically possible to exercise more.
p103
aVBut resisting temptation
p104
aVis hard.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe other reason
p107
aVthat it's difficult to resist temptation
p108
aVis because it's an unequal battle
p109
aVbetween the present self and the future self.
p110
aVI mean, let's face it, the present self is present.
p111
aVIt's in control. It's in power right now.
p112
aVIt has these strong, heroic arms
p113
aVthat can lift doughnuts into your mouth.
p114
aVAnd the future self is not even around.
p115
aVIt's off in the future. It's weak.
p116
aVIt doesn't even have a lawyer present.
p117
aVThere's nobody to stick up for the future self.
p118
aVAnd so the present self can trounce
p119
aVall over its dreams.
p120
aVSo there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought,
p121
aVand we need commitment devices
p122
aVto level the playing field between the two.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually.
p125
aVTying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other ones
p126
aVsuch as locking a credit card away with a key
p127
aVor not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it
p128
aVor unplugging your Internet connection
p129
aVso you can use your computer.
p130
aVI was creating commitment devices of my own
p131
aVlong before I knew what they were.
p132
aVSo when I was a starving post-doc
p133
aVat Columbia University,
p134
aVI was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.
p135
aVI had to write five pages a day
p136
aVtowards papers
p137
aVor I would have to give up five dollars.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd when you try to execute these commitment devices,
p140
aVyou realize the devil is really in the details.
p141
aVBecause it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars.
p142
aVI mean, you can't burn it; that's illegal.
p143
aVAnd I thought, well I could give it to a charity
p144
aVor give it to my wife or something like that.
p145
aVBut then I thought, oh, I'm sending myself mixed messages.
p146
aVBecause not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good.
p147
aVSo then I would kind of justify not writing
p148
aVby giving a gift.
p149
aVAnd then I kind of flipped that around and thought,
p150
aVwell I could give it to the neo-Nazis.
p151
aVBut then I was like, that's more bad than writing is good,
p152
aVand so that wouldn't work.
p153
aVSo ultimately, I just decided
p154
aVI would leave it in an envelope on the subway.
p155
aVSometimes a good person would find it,
p156
aVsometimes a bad person would find it.
p157
aVOn average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of money
p158
aVthat I would regret.
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aVSuch it is with commitment devices.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut despite my like for them,
p163
aVthere's two nagging concerns
p164
aVthat I've always had about commitment devices,
p165
aVand you might feel this if you use them yourself.
p166
aVSo the first is,
p167
aVwhen you've got one of these devices going,
p168
aVsuch as this contract to write everyday or pay,
p169
aVit's just a constant reminder
p170
aVthat you have no self-control.
p171
aVYou're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device,
p172
aVI am nothing, I have no self-discipline."
p173
aVAnd then when you're ever in a situation
p174
aVwhere you don't have a commitment device in place \u2014
p175
aVlike, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut,
p176
aVand I have no defense mechanism," \u2014
p177
aVyou just eat it.
p178
aVSo I don't like the way that they take the power away from you.
p179
aVI think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.
p180
aVThe more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe other problem with commitment devices
p183
aVis that you can always weasel your way out of them.
p184
aVYou say, "Well, of course I can't write today,
p185
aVbecause I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews,
p186
aVand then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that.
p187
aVAnd so there's no way that this is going to work."
p188
aVSo in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first mate
p189
aVin one person.
p190
aVYou're putting yourself, you're binding yourself,
p191
aVand you're weaseling your way out of it,
p192
aVand then you're beating yourself up afterwards.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo I've been working
p195
aVfor about a decade now
p196
aVon finding other ways
p197
aVto change people's relationship to the future self
p198
aVwithout using commitment devices.
p199
aVIn particular, I'm interested in the relationship
p200
aVto the future financial self.
p201
aVAnd this is a timely issue.
p202
aVI'm talking about the topic of saving.
p203
aVNow saving is a classic two selves problem.
p204
aVThe present self does not want to save at all.
p205
aVIt wants to consume.
p206
aVWhereas the future self wants the present self to save.
p207
aVSo this is a timely problem.
p208
aVWe look at the savings rate
p209
aVand it has been declining since the 1950s.
p210
aVAt the same time, the Retirement Risk Index,
p211
aVthe chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement,
p212
aVhas been increasing.
p213
aVAnd we're at a situation now
p214
aVwhere for every three baby boomers,
p215
aVthe McKinsey Global Institute predicts
p216
aVthat two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs
p217
aVwhile they're in retirement.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo what can we do about this?
p220
aVThere's a philosopher, Derek Parfit,
p221
aVwho said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.
p222
aVHe said that, "We might neglect our future selves
p223
aVbecause of some failure of belief or imagination."
p224
aVThat is to say,
p225
aVwe somehow might not believe that we're going to get old,
p226
aVor we might not be able to imagine
p227
aVthat we're going to get old some day.
p228
aVOn the one hand, it sounds ridiculous.
p229
aVOf course, we know that we're going to get old.
p230
aVBut aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time?
p231
aa(lp232
VSo my coauthors and I have used computers,
p233
aVthe greatest tool of our time,
p234
aVto assist people's imagination
p235
aVand help them imagine what it might be like
p236
aVto go into the future.
p237
aVAnd I'll show you some of these tools right here.
p238
aVThe first is called the distribution builder.
p239
aVIt shows people what the future might be like
p240
aVby showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes
p241
aVthat might be obtained in the future.
p242
aVEach outcome is shown by one of these markers,
p243
aVand each sits on a row
p244
aVthat represents a level of wealth and retirement.
p245
aVBeing up at the top
p246
aVmeans that you're enjoying a high income in retirement.
p247
aVBeing down at the bottom
p248
aVmeans that you're struggling to make ends meet.
p249
aVWhen you make an investment,
p250
aVwhat you're really saying is, "I accept
p251
aVthat any one of these 100 things
p252
aVcould happen to me and determine my wealth."
p253
aa(lp254
VNow you can try to move your outcomes around.
p255
aVYou can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing,
p256
aVbut it costs you something to do it.
p257
aVIt means that you have to save more today.
p258
aVOnce you find an investment that you're happy with,
p259
aVwhat people do is they click "done"
p260
aVand the markers begin to disappear,
p261
aVslowly, one by one.
p262
aVIt simulates what it is like to invest in something
p263
aVand to watch that investment pan out.
p264
aVAt the end, there will only be one marker left standing
p265
aVand it will determine our wealth in retirement.
p266
aa(lp267
VYes, this person retired
p268
aVat 150 percent of their working income in retirement.
p269
aVThey're making more money while retired
p270
aVthan they were making while they were working.
p271
aVIf you're like most people,
p272
aVjust seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy \u2014
p273
aVjust to think about making
p274
aV50 percent more money in retirement than before.
p275
aVHowever, had you ended up on the very bottom,
p276
aVit might have given you a slight sense
p277
aVof dread and/or nausea
p278
aVthinking about struggling to get by in retirement.
p279
aVBy using this tool over and over
p280
aVand simulating outcome after outcome,
p281
aVpeople can understand
p282
aVthat the investments and savings that they undertake today
p283
aVdetermine their well-being in the future.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow people are motivated through emotions,
p286
aVbut different people find different things motivating.
p287
aVThis is a simulation
p288
aVthat uses graphics,
p289
aVbut other people find motivating what money can buy,
p290
aVnot just numbers.
p291
aVSo here I made a distribution builder
p292
aVwhere instead of showing numerical outcomes,
p293
aVI show people what those outcomes will get you,
p294
aVin particular apartments that you can afford
p295
aVif you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500,
p296
aV2,000 dollars per month and so on.
p297
aVAs you move down the ladder of apartments,
p298
aVyou see that they get worse and worse.
p299
aVSome of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student.
p300
aVAnd as you get to the very bottom,
p301
aVyou're faced with the unfortunate reality
p302
aVthat if you don't save anything for retirement,
p303
aVyou won't be able to afford any housing at all.
p304
aVThose are actual pictures of actual apartments
p305
aVrenting for that amount
p306
aVas advertised on the Internet.
p307
aa(lp308
VThe last thing I'll show you,
p309
aVthe last behavioral time machine,
p310
aVis something that I created with Hal Hershfield,
p311
aVwho was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project,
p312
aVBill Sharpe.
p313
aVAnd what it is
p314
aVis an exploration into virtual reality.
p315
aVSo what we do is we take pictures of people \u2014
p316
aVin this case, college-age people \u2014
p317
aVand we use software to age them
p318
aVand show these people what they'll look like
p319
aVwhen they're 60, 70, 80 years old.
p320
aVAnd we try to test
p321
aVwhether actually assisting your imagination
p322
aVby looking at the face of your future self
p323
aVcan change you investment behavior.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo this is one of our experiments.
p326
aVHere we see the face of the young subject on the left.
p327
aVHe's given a control
p328
aVthat allows him to adjust his savings rate.
p329
aVAs he moves his savings rate down,
p330
aVit means that he's saving zero
p331
aVwhen it's all the way here at the left.
p332
aVYou can see his current annual income \u2014
p333
aVthis is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today \u2014
p334
aVis quite high, 91 percent,
p335
aVbut his retirement income is quite low.
p336
aVHe's going to retire on 44 percent
p337
aVof what he earned while he was working.
p338
aVIf he saves the maximum legal amount,
p339
aVhis retirement income goes up,
p340
aVbut he's unhappy
p341
aVbecause now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.
p342
aVOther conditions show people the future self.
p343
aVAnd from the future self's point of view, everything is in reverse.
p344
aVIf you save very little,
p345
aVthe future self is unhappy
p346
aVliving on 44 percent of the income.
p347
aVWhereas if the present self saves a lot,
p348
aVthe future self is delighted,
p349
aVwhere the income is close up near 100 percent.
p350
aa(lp351
VTo bring this to a wider audience,
p352
aVI've been working with Hal and Allianz
p353
aVto create something we call the behavioral time machine,
p354
aVin which you not only get to see yourself in the future,
p355
aVbut you get to see anticipated emotional reactions
p356
aVto different levels of retirement wealth.
p357
aVSo for instance,
p358
aVhere is somebody using the tool.
p359
aVAnd just watch the facial expressions
p360
aVas they move the slider.
p361
aVThe younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.
p362
aVThe older face is miserable.
p363
aVAnd slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.
p364
aVAnd then it's a high savings rate.
p365
aVThe younger face is getting unhappy.
p366
aVThe older face is quite pleased
p367
aVwith the decision.
p368
aVWe're going to see if this has an effect on what people do.
p369
aVAnd what's nice about it
p370
aVis it's not something that biasing people actually,
p371
aVbecause as one face smiles,
p372
aVthe other face frowns.
p373
aVIt's not telling you which way to put the slider,
p374
aVit's just reminding you that you are
p375
aVconnected to and legally tied to
p376
aVthis future self.
p377
aa(lp378
VYour decisions today are going to determine its well-being.
p379
aVAnd that's something that's easy to forget.
p380
aVThis use of virtual reality
p381
aVis not just good for making people look older.
p382
aVThere are programs you can get
p383
aVto see how people might look
p384
aVif they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun,
p385
aVif they gain weight and so on.
p386
aVAnd what's good is,
p387
aVunlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith,
p388
aVyou don't have to program these by yourself
p389
aVin order to see the virtual reality.
p390
aVThere are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars
p391
aVthat do the same thing.
p392
aVThis is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor.
p393
aVYou might recognize him from the previous demos.
p394
aVAnd just for kicks we ran his picture
p395
aVthrough the balding, aging and weight gain software
p396
aVto see how he would look.
p397
aVHal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself
p398
aVto disabuse you of that last image.
p399
aVAnd I'll close it there.
p400
aa(lp401
VOn behalf of Hal and myself,
p402
aVI wish all the best to your present and future selves.
p403
aVThank you.

VI was sitting with my girls,
p5
aVand Joy said,
p6
aV"Dang, I wish he'd get off my back.
p7
aVMy daddy, he calls me all the time."
p8
aa(lp9
V"Lucky for you he calls at all," said Jasmine.
p10
aV"I haven't heard from my dad in years."
p11
aa(lp12
VAt this moment, I knew the girls needed a way
p13
aVto connect with their fathers.
p14
aVAt Camp Diva, my non-profit organization,
p15
aVwe have these types of conversations all the time
p16
aVas a way to help girls of African descent
p17
aVprepare for their passage into womanhood.
p18
aVThese girls just needed
p19
aVa way to invite their fathers into their lives
p20
aVon their own terms.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I asked the girls,
p23
aV"How can we help other girls
p24
aVdevelop healthy relationships with their fathers?"
p25
aa(lp26
V"Let's have a dance," one girl shouted,
p27
aVand all the girls quickly backed her up.
p28
aVThey started dreaming about the decorations,
p29
aVinvitations, the dresses they were going to wear,
p30
aVand what their fathers could and could not wear. (Laughter)
p31
aVIt was off and running before I could even blink my eyes,
p32
aVbut even if I could have slowed down those girls,
p33
aVI wouldn't have,
p34
aVbecause one thing that I have learned
p35
aVfrom over a decade of working with girls
p36
aVis that they already know what they need.
p37
aVThe wisdom lives inside of them.
p38
aVAs long as they have infrastructure,
p39
aVmentorship and resources,
p40
aVthey can build what they need,
p41
aVnot only to survive, but to thrive.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo we had a dance,
p44
aVand girls and their fathers came in multitudes.
p45
aVThey were dressed to the nines.
p46
aVThey acted sweet.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVThey acted silly.
p49
aVThey really enjoyed each other's company.
p50
aVIt was a huge success.
p51
aVAnd the girls decided to make it an annual event.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo as the seasons changed,
p54
aVand it was time to plan the dance again,
p55
aVone girl named Brianna spoke up,
p56
aVand she said,
p57
aV"My dad can't come to the dance,
p58
aVand this whole thing is making me sad."
p59
aa(lp60
V"Why not?" the girls asked.
p61
aa(lp62
V"Because he's in jail," she bravely admitted.
p63
aa(lp64
V"Well, can he just get out for a day?" one of the girls asked. (Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
V"And come in shackles?
p67
aVThat's worse than not having him here at all."
p68
aa(lp69
VAt this moment, I saw an opportunity
p70
aVfor the girls to rise to the occasion
p71
aVand to become their own heroes.
p72
aVSo I asked, "What do you think we should do about this?
p73
aVWe want every girl to experience the dance, right?"
p74
aa(lp75
VSo the girls thought for a moment,
p76
aVand one girl suggested,
p77
aV"Why don't we just take the dance in the jail?"
p78
aa(lp79
VMost of the girls doubted the possibility of that,
p80
aVand said, "Are you crazy?
p81
aVWho is going to allow a bunch of little girls,
p82
aVdressed up \u2014 " (Laughter)
p83
aV" \u2014 to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits?"
p84
aVBecause that's what they called them.
p85
aa(lp86
VI said, "Girls, well, well,
p87
aVyou never know unless you ask."
p88
aa(lp89
VSo a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff,
p90
aVsigned collectively by each girl,
p91
aVand I would have to say, he is a very special sheriff.
p92
aVHe contacted me immediately and said,
p93
aVwhenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside,
p94
aVhis doors are always open.
p95
aVBecause one thing he did know,
p96
aVthat when fathers are connected to their children,
p97
aVit is less likely that they will return.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo,
p100
aV16 inmates and 18 girls were invited.
p101
aVThe girls were dressed in their Sunday best,
p102
aVand the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits
p103
aVfor shirts and ties.
p104
aVThey hugged.
p105
aVThey shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish.
p106
aVThey laughed together.
p107
aVIt was beautiful.
p108
aVThe fathers and daughters even experienced
p109
aVan opportunity to have a physical connection,
p110
aVsomething that a lot of them didn't even have
p111
aVfor a while.
p112
aVFathers were in a space where they were able to
p113
aVmake their daughters play,
p114
aVand pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance.
p115
aVEven the guards cried.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut after the dance,
p118
aVwe all realized that Dad still would be in jail.
p119
aVSo we needed to create something
p120
aVthat they could take with them.
p121
aVSo we brought in Flip cams,
p122
aVand we had them look at the Flip cams
p123
aVand just interview each other \u2014
p124
aVtheir messages, their thoughts.
p125
aVThis was going to be used as a touchstone
p126
aVso when they started to miss each other
p127
aVand feel disconnected,
p128
aVthey could reconnect through this image.
p129
aa(lp130
VI'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes
p131
aVwith that camera and said,
p132
aV"Daddy, when you look at me, what do you see?"
p133
aVBecause our daddies are our mirrors
p134
aVthat we reflect back on
p135
aVwhen we decide about what type of man we deserve,
p136
aVand how they see us for the rest of our lives.
p137
aVI know that very well,
p138
aVbecause I was one of the lucky girls.
p139
aVI have had
p140
aVmy father in my life always.
p141
aVHe's even here today.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd that is why it is extremely special
p146
aVfor me to make sure that these girls
p147
aVare connected to their fathers,
p148
aVespecially those who are separated
p149
aVbecause of barbed wires and metal doors.
p150
aVWe have just created a form
p151
aVfor girls who have heavy questions on their heart
p152
aVto be in a position to ask their fathers those questions
p153
aVand given the fathers the freedom to answer.
p154
aVBecause we know that the fathers
p155
aVare even leaving with this one thought:
p156
aVWhat type of woman am I preparing to put in the world?
p157
aVBecause a father is locked in
p158
aVdoes not mean he should be locked out
p159
aVof his daughter's life.

Patton founded Camp Diva in Richmond, Virginia in 2004, to honor Diva Mstadi Smith-Roan, a five-year-old who died in a firearm accident earlier that year. That summer, Patton planned a two-week experience that gave Diva&#39;s mother an opportunity to share her motherly love with girls in need of a support system. The program grew and went national in October 2013, when Camp Diva merged with California-based Girls For A Change, a nonprofit through which 100 girls&#39; groups throughout nation work together to envision and execute lasting change in their neighborhoods, cities or schools. In the summer of 2016, Patton lead her board and staff to retool the organization&#39;s focus and build a program structure to more accurately reflect GFAC&#39;s goal to work with black girls and to disseminate our programs using a specific, replicable approach.</p><p>Following the release of Patton&#39;s&nbsp;TED Talk describing a father-daughter dance for incarcerated dads and their &quot;at-promise&quot; girls, her work was featured on ABC World News, Inside Edition, NPR and This is Life Lisa Ling.

href=\\"http://www.girlsforachange.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Girls For A Change</a>&nbsp;(GFAC), Angela Patton is committed to &quot;preparing black girls for the world ... and the world for black Girls. Patton founded Camp Diva in Richmond, Virginia in 2004, to honor Diva Mstadi Smith-Roan, a five-year-old who died in a firearm accident earlier that year. That summer, Patton planned a two-week experience that gave Diva&#39;s mother an opportunity to share her motherly love with girls in need of a support system. The program grew and went national in October 2013, when Camp Diva merged with California-based Girls For A Change, a nonprofit through which 100 girls&#39; groups throughout nation work together to envision and execute lasting change in their neighborhoods, cities or schools. In the summer of 2016, Patton lead her board and staff to retool the organization&#39;s focus and build a program structure to more accurately reflect GFAC&#39;s goal to work with black girls and to disseminate our programs using a specific, replicable approach.</p><p>Following the release of Patton&#39;s&nbsp;TED Talk describing a father-daughter dance for incarcerated dads and their &quot;at-promise&quot; girls, her work was featured on ABC World News, Inside Edition, NPR and This is Life Lisa Ling. She has spoken for corporations, at conferences on girls as well as colleges and universities throughout the country. When she isn&#39;t inspiring change, advocating gender equality and empowering girls, she enjoys festivals and concerts with her husband and motivator, Raymond Patton, and their loving children, Imhotep and Asani.</p>", "slug": "angela_patton", "whotheyare": "Angela Patton is an ambassador for who she calls \\"at-promise\\" (as opposed to \\"at-risk\\") girls and a serial innovator.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 1520, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/316cab66b9c6f05c7e9cc2fc7bcf0814253b27c6_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "A father-daughter dance ... in prison", "take_action": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "link_url": "http://campdiva.org/DateWithDad_Weekend.htm", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "verb": "attend", "published": true, "visible_url": "campdiva.org", "type": "take_action", "blurb": "**Attend** Camp Diva\'s annual Date With Dad Weekend."}], "comments": 17444, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "A dance of their own", "link_url": "http://blog.ted.com/2013/04/01/angela-patton-holds-second-father-daughter-dance-in-prison-sets-sights-on-a-documentary/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "", "type": "from_the_blog", "blurb": "Angela Patton hosts the second annual father-daughter dance in prison, and sets her sights on what\'s next."}], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/607b6a77d182a5f75b6237d96fc4184fdf2721b8_1600x1200.jpg", "description": "At Camp Diva, Angela Patton works to help young girls and their fathers stay connected and become part of each others\' lives.

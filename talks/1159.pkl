VI spent the best part of last year
p5
aVworking on a documentary
p6
aVabout my own happiness \u2014
p7
aVtrying to see
p8
aVif I can actually train my mind
p9
aVin a particular way,
p10
aVlike I can train my body,
p11
aVso I can end up with an improved feeling
p12
aVof overall well-being.
p13
aVThen this January,
p14
aVmy mother died,
p15
aVand pursuing a film like that
p16
aVjust seemed the last thing that was interesting to me.
p17
aVSo in a very typical, silly designer fashion,
p18
aVafter years worth of work,
p19
aVpretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Music)
p22
aa(lp23
VThey were still done
p24
aVwhen I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia.
p25
aVWe can see the first part here was designed here by pigs.
p26
aVIt was a little bit too funky,
p27
aVand we wanted a more feminine point of view
p28
aVand employed a duck
p29
aVwho did it in a much more fitting way \u2014
p30
aVfashion.
p31
aVMy studio in Bali
p32
aVwas only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest,
p33
aVand monkeys, of course,
p34
aVare supposed to be the happiest of all animals.
p35
aVSo we trained them to be able to do three separate words,
p36
aVto lay out them properly.
p37
aVYou can see,
p38
aVthere still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.
p39
aVThe serif is not really in place.
p40
aVSo of course, what you don't do properly yourself
p41
aVis never deemed done really.
p42
aVSo this is us climbing onto the trees
p43
aVand putting it up over the Sayan Valley
p44
aVin Indonesia.
p45
aa(lp46
VIn that year, what I did do a lot
p47
aVwas look at all sorts of surveys,
p48
aVlooking at a lot of data on this subject.
p49
aVAnd it turns out
p50
aVthat men and women
p51
aVreport very, very similar levels of happiness.
p52
aVThis is a very quick overview
p53
aVof all the studies that I looked at.
p54
aVThat climate plays no role.
p55
aVThat if you live in the best climate,
p56
aVin San Diego in the United States,
p57
aVor in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York,
p58
aVyou are going to be just as happy
p59
aVin either place.
p60
aVIf you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S.,
p61
aVany salary increase you're going to experience
p62
aVwill have only a tiny, tiny influence
p63
aVon your overall well-being.
p64
aVBlack people are just as happy as white people are.
p65
aVIf you're old or young
p66
aVit doesn't really make a difference.
p67
aVIf you're ugly or if you're really, really good-looking
p68
aVit makes no difference whatsoever.
p69
aVYou will adapt to it and get used to it.
p70
aVIf you have manageable health problems
p71
aVit doesn't really matter.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow this does matter.
p74
aVSo now the woman on the right
p75
aVis actually much happier than the guy on the left \u2014
p76
aVmeaning that, if you have a lot of friends,
p77
aVand you have meaningful friendships,
p78
aVthat does make a lot of difference.
p79
aVAs well as being married \u2014 you are likely to be much happier
p80
aVthan if you are single.
p81
aa(lp82
VA fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt,
p83
aVcame up with this beautiful little analogy
p84
aVbetween the conscious and the unconscious mind.
p85
aVHe says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider
p86
aVon this giant elephant, the unconscious.
p87
aVAnd the rider thinks
p88
aVthat he can tell the elephant what to do,
p89
aVbut the elephant really has his own ideas.
p90
aVIf I look at my own life,
p91
aVI'm born in 1962 in Austria.
p92
aVIf I would have been born a hundred years earlier,
p93
aVthe big decisions in my life would have been made for me \u2014
p94
aVmeaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in;
p95
aVI would have very much likely
p96
aVentered the same profession that my dad did;
p97
aVand I would have very much likely married a woman
p98
aVthat my mom had selected.
p99
aVI, of course, and all of us,
p100
aVare very much in charge
p101
aVof these big decisions in our lives.
p102
aVWe live where we want to be \u2014
p103
aVat least in the West.
p104
aVWe become what we really are interested in.
p105
aVWe choose our own profession,
p106
aVand we choose our own partners.
p107
aVAnd so it's quite surprising
p108
aVthat many of us
p109
aVlet our unconscious influence those decisions
p110
aVin ways that we are not quite aware of.
p111
aa(lp112
VIf you look at the statistics
p113
aVand you see that the guy called George,
p114
aVwhen he decides on where he wants to live \u2014
p115
aVis it Florida or North Dakota? \u2014
p116
aVhe goes and lives in Georgia.
p117
aVAnd if you look at a guy called Dennis,
p118
aVwhen he decides what to become \u2014
p119
aVis it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor
p120
aVor a teacher? \u2014
p121
aVbest chance is that he wants to become a dentist.
p122
aVAnd if Paula decides
p123
aVshould she marry Joe or Jack,
p124
aVsomehow Paul sounds the most interesting.
p125
aVAnd so even if we make
p126
aVthose very important decisions
p127
aVfor very silly reasons,
p128
aVit remains statistically true
p129
aVthat there are more Georges living in Georgia
p130
aVand there are more Dennises becoming dentists
p131
aVand there are more Paulas who are married to Paul
p132
aVthan statistically viable.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVNow I, of course, thought,
p135
aV"Well this is American data,"
p136
aVand I thought, "Well, those silly Americans.
p137
aVThey get influenced by things
p138
aVthat they're not aware of.
p139
aVThis is just completely ridiculous."
p140
aVThen, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad \u2014
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aVKarolina and Karl,
p143
aVand grandmom and granddad,
p144
aVJosefine and Josef.
p145
aVSo I am looking still for a Stephanie.
p146
aVI'll figure something out.
p147
aa(lp148
VIf I make this whole thing a little bit more personal
p149
aVand see what makes me happy as a designer,
p150
aVthe easiest answer, of course,
p151
aVis do more of the stuff that I like to do
p152
aVand much less of the stuff that I don't like to do \u2014
p153
aVfor which it would be helpful
p154
aVto know what it is that I actually do like to do.
p155
aVI'm a big list maker,
p156
aVso I came up with a list.
p157
aVOne of them is to think without pressure.
p158
aVThis is a project we're working on right now
p159
aVwith a very healthy deadline.
p160
aVIt's a book on culture,
p161
aVand, as you can see,
p162
aVculture is rapidly drifting around.
p163
aVDoing things like I'm doing right now \u2014
p164
aVtraveling to Cannes.
p165
aVThe example I have here
p166
aVis a chair that came out of the year in Bali \u2014
p167
aVclearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture,
p168
aVnot being stuck behind
p169
aVa single computer screen all day long
p170
aVand be here and there.
p171
aVQuite consciously, design projects
p172
aVthat need an incredible amount of various techniques,
p173
aVjust basically to fight
p174
aVstraightforward adaptation.
p175
aa(lp176
VBeing close to the content \u2014
p177
aVthat's the content really is close to my heart.
p178
aVThis is a bus, or vehicle,
p179
aVfor a charity, for an NGO
p180
aVthat wants to double the education budget in the United States \u2014
p181
aVcarefully designed,
p182
aVso, by two inches, it still clears highway overpasses.
p183
aVHaving end results \u2014 things that come back from the printer well,
p184
aVlike this little business card for an animation company
p185
aVcalled Sideshow
p186
aVon lenticular foils.
p187
aVWorking on projects
p188
aVthat actually have visible impacts,
p189
aVlike a book for a deceased German artist
p190
aVwhose widow came to us
p191
aVwith the requirement to make her late husband famous.
p192
aVIt just came out six months ago,
p193
aVand it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany.
p194
aVAnd I think that his widow
p195
aVis going to be very successful on her quest.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd lately, to be involved in projects
p198
aVwhere I know about 50 percent of the project
p199
aVtechnique-wise
p200
aVand the other 50 percent would be new.
p201
aVSo in this case,
p202
aVit's an outside projection for Singapore
p203
aVon these giant Times Square-like screens.
p204
aVAnd I of course knew stuff, as a designer,
p205
aVabout typography,
p206
aVeven though we worked with those animals not so successfully.
p207
aVBut I didn't quite know
p208
aVall that much about movement or film.
p209
aVAnd from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project.
p210
aVBut also because the content was very close.
p211
aVIn this case, "Keeping a Diary
p212
aVSupports Personal Development" \u2014
p213
aVI've been keeping a diary since I was 12.
p214
aVAnd I've found that it influenced my life and work
p215
aVin a very intriguing way.
p216
aVIn this case also because
p217
aVit's part of one of the many sentiments
p218
aVthat we build the whole series on \u2014
p219
aVthat all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary.
p220
aa(lp221
VThank you so much.

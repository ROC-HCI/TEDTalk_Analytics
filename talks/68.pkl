VI've got apparently 18 minutes
p5
aVto convince you that history has a direction, an arrow;
p6
aVthat in some fundamental sense, it's good;
p7
aVthat the arrow points to something positive.
p8
aVNow, when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk \u2014
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aV\u2014 that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting.
p11
aVIt was before the avian flu had reached Europe.
p12
aVIt was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election,
p13
aVeliciting various counter-measures by Israel.
p14
aVAnd to be honest, if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk
p15
aVthat even as I was giving the upbeat talk,
p16
aVthe apocalypse would be unfolding \u2014
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aV\u2014 I might have said, "Is it okay if I talk about something else?"
p19
aVBut I didn't, OK. So we're here. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can.
p20
aa(lp21
VI've got to warn you:
p22
aVthe sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle,
p23
aVsometimes even elusive.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVThe sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring \u2014
p26
aVI mean, there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension
p27
aVto the way I try to uplift, so if grim inspiration \u2014
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aV\u2014 if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms, that is, I'm afraid,
p30
aVthe most you can hope for. OK, today \u2014 that's if I succeed.
p31
aVI'll see what I can do. OK?
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, in one sense,
p34
aVthe claim that history has a direction is not that controversial.
p35
aVIf you're just talking about social structure,
p36
aVOK, clearly that's gotten more complex
p37
aVa little over the last 10,000 years \u2014 has reached higher and higher levels.
p38
aVAnd in fact, that's actually sustaining
p39
aVa long-standing trend that predates human beings, OK,
p40
aVthat biological evolution was doing for us.
p41
aVBecause what happened in the beginning, this stuff encases itself in a cell,
p42
aVthen cells start hanging out together in societies.
p43
aVEventually they get so close, they form multicellular organisms,
p44
aVthen you get complex multicellular organisms; they form societies.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut then at some point, one of these multicellular organisms
p47
aVdoes something completely amazing with this stuff, which is
p48
aVit launches a whole second kind of evolution: cultural evolution.
p49
aVAnd amazingly, that evolution sustains the trajectory
p50
aVthat biological evolution had established toward greater complexity.
p51
aVBy cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas.
p52
aVA lot of you have heard the term "memes." The evolution of technology,
p53
aVI pay a lot of attention to, so, you know,
p54
aVone of the first things you got was a little hand axe.
p55
aVGenerations go by, somebody says, hey, why don't we put it on a stick?
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVJust absolutely delights the little ones.
p58
aVNext best thing to a video game.
p59
aa(lp60
VThis may not seem to impress,
p61
aVbut technological evolution is progressive, so another 10, 20,000 years,
p62
aVand armaments technology takes you here.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVImpressive. And the rate of technological evolution speeds up,
p65
aVso a mere quarter of a century after this, you get this, OK.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVAnd this.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVI'm sorry \u2014 it was a cheap laugh, but I wanted to find a way
p70
aVto transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse,
p71
aVand I thought that might do it.
p72
aV(Applause)
p73
aa(lp74
VSo, what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse
p75
aVis the collapse of global social organization.
p76
aVNow, first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are,
p77
aVto be on the brink of true global social organization.
p78
aVOriginally, you had the most complex societies, the hunter-gatherer village.
p79
aVStonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom,
p80
aVwhich is what you get with the invention of agriculture: multi-village polity
p81
aVwith centralized rule.
p82
aVWith the invention of writing, you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that
p83
aVbecause it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you
p84
aVhow many levels organic organization has already moved through
p85
aVto get to this point. And then you get to, you know, you get empires.
p86
aa(lp87
VI want to stress, you know, social organization can transcend political bounds.
p88
aVThis is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire.
p89
aVSo you had social complexity spanning the whole continent,
p90
aVeven if no polity did similarly. Today, you've got nation states.
p91
aVPoint is: there's obviously collaboration and organization going on
p92
aVbeyond national bounds.
p93
aVThis is actually just a picture of the earth at night,
p94
aVand I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty.
p95
aVDoes kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something
p98
aVcalled "non-zero sumness."
p99
aVAssuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading, very quickly,
p100
aVthe key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games, in which correlations
p101
aVare inverse: always a winner and a loser.
p102
aVNon-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive, OK.
p103
aVSo like in tennis, usually it's win-lose;
p104
aVit always adds up to zero-zero-sum. But if you're playing doubles,
p105
aVthe person on your side of the net, they're in the same boat as you,
p106
aVso you're playing a non-zero-sum game with them.
p107
aVIt's either for the better or for the worse, OK.
p108
aVA lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on
p109
aVin everyday life often leads to cooperation.
p110
aa(lp111
VThe argument I make is basically that, well,
p112
aVnon-zero-sum games have always been part of life.
p113
aVYou have them in hunter-gatherer societies,
p114
aVbut then through technological evolution, new forms of technology arise
p115
aVthat facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games,
p116
aVinvolving more people over larger territory.
p117
aVSocial structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and
p118
aVto harness this productive potential, so you get cities, you know,
p119
aVand you get all the non-zero-sum games you don't think about
p120
aVthat are being played across the world.
p121
aVLike, have you ever thought when you buy a car,
p122
aVhow many people on how many different continents contributed
p123
aVto the manufacture of that car? Those are people in effect
p124
aVyou're playing a non-zero-sum game with.
p125
aVI mean, there are certainly plenty of them around.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way,
p128
aVbecause when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know,
p129
aVthat's good. Well, there are a few reasons
p130
aVthat actually it's not intrinsically upbeat.
p131
aVFirst of all, it can accommodate; it doesn't deny the existence
p132
aVof inequality exploitation war.
p133
aVBut there's a more fundamental reason
p134
aVthat it's not intrinsically upbeat, because a non-zero-sum game,
p135
aVall it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse.
p136
aVIt doesn't necessarily predict a win-win outcome.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, in a way, the question is: on what grounds
p139
aVam I upbeat at all about history? And the answer is,
p140
aVfirst of all, on balance I would say people have played their games
p141
aVto more win-win outcomes than lose-lose outcomes. On balance,
p142
aVI think history is a net positive in the non-zero-sum game department.
p143
aVAnd a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me,
p144
aVmost impresses me, and most uplifts me,
p145
aVwhich is that there is a moral dimension to history;
p146
aVthere is a moral arrow. We have seen moral progress over time.
p147
aa(lp148
V2,500 years ago, members of one Greek city-state
p149
aVconsidered members of another Greek city-state subhuman
p150
aVand treated them that way. And then this moral revolution arrived,
p151
aVand they decided that actually, no, Greeks are human beings.
p152
aVIt's just the Persians who aren't fully human
p153
aVand don't deserve to be treated very nicely.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut this was progress \u2014 you know, give them credit. And now today,
p156
aVwe've seen more progress. I think \u2014 I hope \u2014 most people here would say
p157
aVthat all people everywhere are human beings,
p158
aVdeserve to be treated decently,
p159
aVunless they do something horrendous, regardless of race or religion.
p160
aVAnd you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been,
p161
aVOK. This was not a prevalent view,
p162
aVfew thousand years ago, and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic.
p163
aVI think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities,
p164
aVethnicities, religions as there is today. If you asked me,
p165
aVyou know, why am I not in favor of bombing Japan,
p166
aVwell, I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car.
p167
aVWe have this non-zero-sum relationship,
p168
aVand I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize
p169
aVthat someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours \u2014
p170
aVyou're more likely to cut them a break.
p171
aa(lp172
VI kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality.
p173
aVUnfortunately, I don't fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough
p174
aVto know, or any other kind of business class really,
p175
aVbut I assume that in business class, you don't hear many expressions of, you know,
p176
aVbigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups,
p177
aVbecause the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class
p178
aVare doing business with all these people; they're making money
p179
aVoff all these people. And I really do think that, in that sense at least,
p180
aVcapitalism has been a constructive force,
p181
aVand more fundamentally, it's a non-zero-sumness
p182
aVthat has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm
p183
aVof moral awareness. I think the non-zero-sum dynamic,
p184
aVwhich is not only economic by any means \u2014 it's not always commerce \u2014
p185
aVbut it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth,
p186
aVwhich is the fundamental equality of everyone. It has done that.
p187
aVAs it has moved global, moved us toward a global level of social organization,
p188
aVit has driven us toward moral truth.
p189
aVI think that's wonderful.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, back to the unfolding apocalypse.
p192
aVAnd you may wonder, OK, that's all fine,
p193
aVsounds great \u2014 moral direction in history \u2014
p194
aVbut what about this so-called clash of civilizations? Well, first of all,
p195
aVI would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework,
p196
aVOK. If you look at the relationship
p197
aVbetween the so-called Muslim world and Western world \u2014
p198
aVtwo terms I don't like, but can't really avoid;
p199
aVin such a short span of time, they're efficient if nothing else \u2014
p200
aVit is non-zero-sum. And by that I mean,
p201
aVif people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful,
p202
aVless happy with their place in the world,
p203
aVit'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy, it'll be good for the West.
p204
aVSo that is a non-zero-sum dynamic.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd I would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time
p207
aVbecause of technological trends, but more intense in a kind of negative way.
p208
aVIt's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible.
p209
aVAnd one reason is because of something I call the "growing lethality of hatred."
p210
aVMore and more, it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad
p211
aVto manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil.
p212
aVAnd that's pretty new, and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse
p213
aV\u2014 this capacity \u2014 because of
p214
aVtrends in information technology, in technologies that can be used
p215
aVfor purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology.
p216
aVWe may be hearing more about that today.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd there's something I worry about especially, which is that
p219
aVthis dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope.
p220
aVWhat I have in mind is: terrorism happens here; we overreact to it.
p221
aVThat, you know, we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation
p222
aVleads to more hatred abroad, more terrorism.
p223
aVWe overreact because being human, we feel like retaliating,
p224
aVand it gets worse and worse and worse.
p225
aVYou could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes,
p226
aVbut I think in something so spooky,
p227
aVwe really shouldn't have the word positive there at all, even in a technical sense.
p228
aVSo let's call it the death spiral of negativity.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVI assure you if it happens, at the end, both the West
p231
aVand the Muslim world will have suffered.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo, what do we do? Well, first of all, we can do a lot more with arms control,
p234
aVthe international regulation of dangerous technologies.
p235
aVI have a whole global governance sermon
p236
aVthat I will spare you right now,
p237
aVbecause I don't think that's going to be enough anyway, although it's essential.
p238
aVI think we're going to have to have a major round
p239
aVof moral progress in the world.
p240
aVI think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups,
p241
aVless bigotry, and, you know, racial groups, religious groups, whatever.
p242
aVI've got to admit I feel silly saying that.
p243
aVIt sounds so kind of Pollyannaish. I feel like Rodney King, you know,
p244
aVsaying, why can't we all just get along?
p245
aVBut hey, I don't really see any alternative, given the way I read the situation.
p246
aVThere's going to have to be moral progress.
p247
aVThere's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world,
p248
aVgiven how dangerous it's becoming.
p249
aVIn my defense, I'd say, as naive as this may sound,
p250
aVit's ultimately grounded in cynicism.
p251
aa(lp252
VThat is to say \u2014
p253
aV(Laughter)
p254
aV\u2014 thank you, thank you. That is to say, remember: my whole view
p255
aVof morality is that it boils down to self-interest.
p256
aVIt's when people's fortunes are correlated.
p257
aVIt's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide, oh yeah,
p258
aVI'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible
p259
aVfor this growth of this moral progress so far,
p260
aVand I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes,
p261
aVand if people respond to it intelligently, we will see
p262
aVthe development of tolerance and so on \u2014
p263
aVthe norms that we need, you know.
p264
aVWe will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention
p267
aVand drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests,
p268
aVwhich is further the moral evolution,
p269
aVthen they could actually have a constructive effect.
p270
aVAnd that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred
p271
aVand death spiral of negativity under the general rubric,
p272
aVreasons to be cheerful.
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVDoing the best I can, OK.
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aVI never called myself Mr. Uplift.
p277
aVI'm just doing what I can here.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VNow, launching a moral revolution has got to be hard, right?
p281
aVI mean, what do you do?
p282
aVAnd I think the answer is a lot of different people
p283
aVare going to have to do a lot of different things.
p284
aVWe all start where we are. Speaking as an American
p285
aVwho has children whose security 10, 20, 30 years down the road
p286
aVI worry about \u2014 what I personally want to start out doing
p287
aVis figuring out why so many people around the world hate us, OK.
p288
aVI think that's a worthy research project myself.
p289
aVI also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise.
p290
aVBecause to understand why somebody
p291
aVin a very different culture does something \u2014
p292
aVsomebody you're kind of viewing as alien,
p293
aVwho's doing things you consider strange
p294
aVin a culture you consider strange \u2014 to really understand why they do
p295
aVthe things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment,
p296
aVbecause you've got to relate their experience to yours.
p297
aVTo really understand it, you've got to say, "Oh, I get it.
p298
aVSo when they feel resentful, it's kind of like
p299
aVthe way I feel resentful when this happens,
p300
aVand for somewhat the same reasons." That's true understanding.
p301
aVAnd I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that.
p302
aa(lp303
VIt's especially hard to do when people hate you, OK,
p304
aVbecause you don't really, in a sense, want
p305
aVto completely understand why people hate you.
p306
aVI mean, you want to hear the reason, but you don't want to be able to relate to it.
p307
aVYou don't want it to make sense, right? (Laughter)
p308
aVYou don't want to say, "Well, yeah, I can kind of understand
p309
aVhow a human being in those circumstances
p310
aVwould hate the country I live in." That's not a pleasant thing,
p311
aVbut I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and
p312
aa(lp313
Vwork on. Now, I want to stress that to understand, you know \u2014
p314
aVthere are people who don't like this whole business of understanding
p315
aVthe grassroots, the root causes of things; they don't want to know
p316
aVwhy people hate us. I want to understand it.
p317
aVThe reason you're trying to understand why they hate us,
p318
aVis to get them to quit hating us. The idea
p319
aVwhen you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate
p320
aVtheir humanity and better understand them, is part of an effort
p321
aVto get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run.
p322
aVI think it's the first step toward that. That's the long-term goal.
p323
aa(lp324
VThere are people who worry about this, and in fact,
p325
aVI, myself, apparently, was denounced on national TV
p326
aVa couple of nights ago because of an op-ed I'd written.
p327
aVIt was kind of along these lines, and the allegation was
p328
aVthat I have, quote, "affection for terrorists."
p329
aVNow, the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aV(Applause)
p332
aVI mean, if you've got to have an enemy, do make it Ann Coulter.
p333
aV(Laughter)
p334
aVBut it's not a crazy concern, OK, because understanding behavior
p335
aVcan lead to a kind of empathy,
p336
aVand it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love, and so on.
p337
aVBut I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending
p338
aVthe situation clearly enough, than in comprehending it so clearly
p339
aVthat we just can't, you know, get the army out to kill terrorists.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo I'm not really worried about it. So \u2014
p342
aV(Laughter)
p343
aV\u2014 I mean, we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts,
p344
aVbut if we succeed \u2014 if we succeed \u2014 then once again,
p345
aVnon-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics
p346
aVwill have forced us to a higher moral level.
p347
aVAnd a kind of saving higher moral level,
p348
aVsomething that kind of literally saves the world.
p349
aVIf you look at the word "salvation" in the Bible \u2014
p350
aVthe Christian usage that we're familiar with \u2014
p351
aVsaving souls, that people go to heaven \u2014 that's actually a latecomer.
p352
aVThe original meaning of the word "salvation" in the Bible is about saving the social system.
p353
aV"Yahweh is our Savior" means "He has saved the nation of Israel,"
p354
aVwhich at the time, was a pretty high-level social organization.
p355
aa(lp356
VNow, social organization has reached the global level, and I guess,
p357
aVif there's good news I can say I'm bringing you, it's just that
p358
aVall the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit
p359
aVof self-interests in a disciplined and careful way.
p360
aVIt's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway
p361
aVbecause we've just come too far to screw it up now.
p362
aVThanks.

VTonight, I'm going to share with you my passion for science.
p5
aVI'm not talking about science that takes baby steps.
p6
aVI'm talking about science that takes enormous leaps.
p7
aVI'm talking Darwin, I'm talking Einstein,
p8
aVI'm talking revolutionary science that turns the world on its head.
p9
aVIn a moment, I'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this.
p10
aVI say "might"
p11
aVbecause, with revolutionary ideas, most are flat wrong,
p12
aVand even those that are right seldom have the impact
p13
aVthat we want them to have.
p14
aa(lp15
VTo explain why I picked two ideas in particular,
p16
aVI'm going to start with a mystery.
p17
aV1847, Vienna, Austria.
p18
aVIgnaz Semmelweis was a somber, compulsively thorough doctor
p19
aVwho ran two maternity clinics.
p20
aVThey were identical except for one thing.
p21
aVWomen were dying of high fevers soon after giving birth
p22
aVthree times more often at one of the clinics than at the other.
p23
aVTrying to figure out what the difference was that caused this,
p24
aVSemmelweis looked at everything he could.
p25
aVSanitation? No.
p26
aVMedical procedures? No.
p27
aVAir flow? No.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe puzzle went unsolved until he happened to autopsy a doctor
p30
aVwho died of an infected scalpel cut.
p31
aVThe doctor's symptoms were identical to those of the mothers who were dying.
p32
aVHow was that possible?
p33
aVHow could a male doctor get the same thing as new mothers?
p34
aVSemmelweis reconstructed everything the doctor had done
p35
aVright before he got sick,
p36
aVand he discovered that he'd been autopsying a corpse.
p37
aVHad something gotten in his wound that killed him?
p38
aVWith growing excitement,
p39
aVSemmelweis looked for any connection he could
p40
aVbetween dead bodies in the morgue and dead mothers in his delivery room,
p41
aVand he found it.
p42
aVIt turned out that at the hospital with the high death rate,
p43
aVbut not the others,
p44
aVdoctors delivered babies immediately after autopsying corpses in the morgue.
p45
aVAha! Corpses were contaminating the doctors' hands
p46
aVand killing his mothers.
p47
aVSo he ordered the doctors to sterilize their hands,
p48
aVand the deaths stopped.
p49
aVDr. Ignaz Semmelweis had discovered infectious disease.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut the doctors of the day thought he was crazy,
p52
aVbecause they knew, and had for hundreds of years,
p53
aVthat odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease,
p54
aVnot these hypothetical particles that you couldn't see.
p55
aVIt took 20 years for Frenchman Louis Pasteur
p56
aVto prove that Semmelweis was right.
p57
aVPasteur was an agricultural chemist
p58
aVwho tried to figure out why milk and beer spoiled so often.
p59
aVHe found that bacteria were the culprits.
p60
aVHe also found that bacteria could kill people in exactly the same way
p61
aVthat Semmelweis's patients were dying.
p62
aa(lp63
VWe now look at what I want to talk about tonight, in two ideas.
p64
aVWe saw it with Semmelweis, that he was a revolutionary.
p65
aVHe did it for two reasons.
p66
aVOne, he opened our eyes to a completely new world.
p67
aVWe'd known since the 1680s about bacteria.
p68
aVWe just didn't know that bacteria killed people.
p69
aVAnd he also demolished fond ideas that people kept close to their heart.
p70
aVMiasmas didn't kill people. Bacteria killed people.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo this brings me to the two ideas I want to talk about tonight.
p73
aVOne has opened our eyes to a completely new universe,
p74
aVand the other attacks long-held beliefs.
p75
aa(lp76
VLet's get started with Dr. Eric Betzig.
p77
aVHe's a physicist who has opened our eyes to an entirely new world
p78
aVby violating the laws of physics.
p79
aVBetzig is a true rebel.
p80
aVHe quit a job at prestigious Bell Laboratory
p81
aVinventing new microscopes for biology
p82
aVbecause he thought scientists were taking his brilliant inventions
p83
aVand doing lousy work with them.
p84
aVSo he became a househusband,
p85
aVbut he never lost his passion for figuring out
p86
aVhow to get microscopes to see finer and finer details
p87
aVthan had ever been seen before or ever could be seen.
p88
aVThis is crucial if we're ever going to understand how cells work,
p89
aVand how cancer works,
p90
aVand how something 150th the size of a head of a pin
p91
aVcan do all these amazing things,
p92
aVlike make proteins
p93
aVand move charges around
p94
aVand all of those things.
p95
aa(lp96
VThere's just one problem.
p97
aVThere's this thing called the law of physics,
p98
aVand part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit.
p99
aVThe diffraction limit is kind of like when you go to a doctor's office,
p100
aVyou can only see so far down, no matter how good glasses you have.
p101
aa(lp102
VThis was a so-called impossible problem.
p103
aVBut one of Betzig's friends figured out how to take a tiny molecule
p104
aVthat was smaller than the best microscope could see
p105
aVand get it to light up and fluoresce.
p106
aV"Aha!" Betzig said.
p107
aV"I think maybe the laws of physics are not so unbreakable after all."
p108
aa(lp109
VSo he lashed together a microscope in his friend's living room.
p110
aVHe had no laboratory.
p111
aVThis revolutionary instrument got different protein molecules
p112
aVto light up in different colors,
p113
aVand with a computer, he was able to turn very, very fuzzy blurs
p114
aVinto very sharp dots and produce images of unprecedented and startling clarity.
p115
aa(lp116
VFor this work, last year,
p117
aVEric Betzig won the Nobel Prize.
p118
aVWhy?
p119
aVBecause now we can see with unprecedented detail
p120
aVthings that we never had seen before,
p121
aVand now doctors can get a better handle on things like cancer.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut do you think Betzig was satisfied there?
p124
aVNo.
p125
aVHe wanted movies.
p126
aVThe problem was
p127
aVthat even the genius microscopes that he invented were just too slow.
p128
aVSo what did he do?
p129
aVHe came up with a 200-year-old idea
p130
aVcalled moiré patterns.
p131
aVSo the way that works is if you take two very, very fine patterns
p132
aVand you move them across each other,
p133
aVyou will see a gross pattern
p134
aVthat a microscope can see
p135
aVthat otherwise you would not be able to see.
p136
aVSo he applied this technique to taking a really blurry image of a cell
p137
aVand moving lots of structured light patterns across it
p138
aVuntil this cell became crystal clear.
p139
aVAnd here is the result:
p140
aVa mysterious new world,
p141
aVfull of strange things zipping around
p142
aVdoing things that we don't know what they're doing.
p143
aVBut when we figure it out, we'll have a better handle on life itself.
p144
aa(lp145
VFor example, those green globs that you see?
p146
aVThose things are called clathrins.
p147
aVThey're molecules that protect other molecules
p148
aVas they move through a cell.
p149
aVUnfortunately, viruses sometimes hijack those to infect cells.
p150
aVAlso, you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around?
p151
aVThose are actin molecules.
p152
aVUnfortunately, viruses also climb down those things
p153
aVto get into the cell nucleus
p154
aVto replicate themselves and make you sick.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow that we can look at movies
p157
aVof what's actually going on deep inside a cell,
p158
aVwe have a much better chance of curing viral diseases like AIDS.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo when you look at a movie like this,
p161
aVit's very clear that Betzig has opened our eyes to a completely new world.
p162
aVBut he hasn't shattered any cherished beliefs.
p163
aa(lp164
VThat leads us to Dr. Aubrey de Grey
p165
aVat Cambridge.
p166
aVDe Grey definitely has scientists squirming with an interesting idea:
p167
aVwe can be immortal.
p168
aVWe can beat aging.
p169
aVNow, most scientists think he's a crackpot.
p170
aVAny Biology 101 student knows
p171
aVthat aging is an inevitable consequence of living.
p172
aVFor example, when we eat,
p173
aVwe take in food and we metabolize it,
p174
aVand that throws off what we call free radicals.
p175
aVYou might have heard of those.
p176
aVAlso known as oxygen ions,
p177
aVthose bind to our DNA, cause it to mutate,
p178
aVand cause us to get old and lose our hair.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VIt's just like, no, it's exactly like
p183
aVoxygen binding to iron and making it rust.
p184
aVSo you age because you rust out.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VOh, and scientists also know there is something called immortality:
p189
aVin cancer cells.
p190
aVSo if you stop aging,
p191
aVall of you are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors.
p192
aa(lp193
VThese are cherished beliefs, but could de Grey be on to something?
p194
aVI think he deserves a closer look.
p195
aVFirst of all, I have a really hard time seeing him as a crackpot.
p196
aVYeah, he started off life as a computer scientist,
p197
aVnot a biologist,
p198
aVbut he earned a PhD in biology from Cambridge,
p199
aVand he has published some very significant work
p200
aVon mitochondrial DNA and a bunch of other stuff.
p201
aVSecondly, he started an antiaging foundation
p202
aVthat has identified seven different causes of aging,
p203
aVto me, that seem very plausible,
p204
aVand he is hot in pursuit of fixes for every single one of them.
p205
aVFor example, one of the reasons we age is that our mitochondrial DNA mutates,
p206
aVand we get kind of old and our cells lose energy.
p207
aVHe believes, and he's made a convincing case,
p208
aVthat using viruses we can do gene therapy,
p209
aVfix that DNA
p210
aVand rejuvenate our cells.
p211
aa(lp212
VOne more thing.
p213
aVWe have an existent proof
p214
aVthat extreme longevity is possible.
p215
aVBristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years,
p216
aVand some lobsters don't age at all.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow, this doesn't mean that de Grey is going to revolutionize our lifespans.
p219
aVI mean, after all, we're not trees, and most of us are not lobsters.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VBut I've got to believe that there are Darwins and Einsteins out there,
p224
aVand I'll tell you why.
p225
aVConsider this:
p226
aVthere are seven times more people alive today than during Darwin's time.
p227
aVThere are four times as many people alive today as Einstein.
p228
aVWhen you consider
p229
aVthat the proportion of scientists in the population has skyrocketed,
p230
aVthere are now seven million scientists.
p231
aVI've got to believe, and I do believe, that there's one of them out there
p232
aVwho is working right now in obscurity
p233
aVto rock our lives, and I don't know about you,
p234
aVbut I can't wait to be rocked.
p235
aa(lp236
VThank you.

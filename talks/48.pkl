VSo anyway, who am I?
p5
aVI usually say to people, when they say, "What do you do?"
p6
aVI say, "I do hardware,"
p7
aVbecause it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do.
p8
aVAnd I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some
p9
aVValley event, to which he replied, "How quaint."
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I sort of really was dumbstruck.
p14
aVAnd I really should have said something smart.
p15
aVAnd now I've had a little bit of time to think about it,
p16
aVI would have said, "Well, you know,
p17
aVif we look at the next 100 years
p18
aVand we've seen all these problems in the last few days,
p19
aVmost of the big issues \u2014 clean water, clean energy \u2014
p20
aVand they're interchangeable in some respects \u2014
p21
aVand cleaner, more functional materials \u2014
p22
aVthey all look to me to be hardware problems.
p23
aVThis doesn't mean we should ignore software,
p24
aVor information, or computation."
p25
aVAnd that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo, this talk is going to be about how do we make things
p28
aVand what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future.
p29
aVNow, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker
p30
aVabout "do this, do that" and you fill out all these forms,
p31
aVand you don't actually know how they're going to describe you,
p32
aVand it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist.
p33
aVAnd I've always been nervous about the term "futurist,"
p34
aVbecause you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it.
p35
aVAnd I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have,
p36
aVand said, "You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?"
p37
aVAnd George Homsey, a great guy, said, "Oh, the future is amazing.
p38
aVIt is so much stranger than you think.
p39
aVWe're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut,
p40
aVand we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint."
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, you may think that's sort of really crazy,
p45
aVbut there are some pretty amazing things that are happening
p46
aVthat make this possible.
p47
aVSo, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT.
p48
aVThis is called the registry of standard biological parts.
p49
aVThis is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight
p50
aVand a few other very, very bright individuals.
p51
aVBasically, what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system.
p52
aVLiterally, think of proteins as subroutines
p53
aVthat you can string together to execute a program.
p54
aVNow, this is actually becoming such an interesting idea.
p55
aVThis is a state diagram. That's an extremely simple computer.
p56
aa(lp57
VThis one is a two-bit counter.
p58
aVSo that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches.
p59
aVAnd this is being built by a group of students at Zurich
p60
aVfor a design competition in biology.
p61
aVAnd from the results of the same competition last year,
p62
aVa University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria
p63
aVso that they can detect light and switch on and off.
p64
aVSo this is interesting in the sense that you can now
p65
aVdo "if-then-for" statements in materials, in structure.
p66
aVThis is a pretty interesting trend,
p67
aVbecause we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly,
p68
aV"Form follows function," but I think I've sort of grown up in a world
p69
aV\u2014 you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday;
p70
aVI was in a lab associated with his \u2014 where it's really a world
p71
aVwhere information defines form and function.
p72
aa(lp73
VI spent six years thinking about that,
p74
aVbut to show you the power of art over science \u2014
p75
aVthis is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called "HowToons."
p76
aVI work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta.
p77
aVTook me six years at MIT,
p78
aVand about that many pages to describe what I was doing,
p79
aVand it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker.
p80
aVHe's an interesting little kid \u2014 and his sister, Celine \u2014
p81
aVand what he's doing here
p82
aVis observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl.
p83
aVAnd in fact you can program the self-assembly of things,
p84
aVso he starts chocolate-dipping edges,
p85
aVchanging the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity.
p86
aVIn theory, if you program those sufficiently,
p87
aVyou should be able to do something pretty interesting
p88
aVand make a very complex structure.
p89
aVIn this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure.
p90
aVAnd that's what I thought about for a long time,
p91
aVbecause this is how we currently make things.
p92
aVThis is a silicon wafer, and essentially
p93
aVthat's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up.
p94
aVThe feature side is \u2014 you know, people will say,
p95
aV[unclear] down around about 65 nanometers now.
p96
aa(lp97
VOn the right, that's a radiolara.
p98
aVThat's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans.
p99
aVAnd that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers,
p100
aVand it's a complex 3D structure.
p101
aVWe could do a lot more with computers and things generally
p102
aVif we knew how to build things this way.
p103
aVThe secret to biology is, it builds computation
p104
aVinto the way it makes things. So this little thing here, polymerase,
p105
aVis essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.
p106
aVAnd the ribosome here is another little computer
p107
aVthat helps in the translation of the proteins.
p108
aVI thought about this
p109
aVin the sense that it's great to build in biological materials,
p110
aVbut can we do similar things?
p111
aVCan we get self-replicating-type behavior?
p112
aVCan we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling
p113
aVin inorganic systems?
p114
aVBecause there are some advantages to inorganic systems,
p115
aVlike higher speed semiconductors, etc.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo, this is some of my work
p118
aVon how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system.
p119
aVAnd this is sort of Babbage's revenge.
p120
aVThese are little mechanical computers.
p121
aVThese are five-state state machines.
p122
aVSo, that's about three light switches lined up.
p123
aVIn a neutral state, they won't bind at all.
p124
aVNow, if I make a string of these, a bit string,
p125
aVthey will be able to replicate.
p126
aVSo we start with white, blue, blue, white.
p127
aVThat encodes; that will now copy. From one comes two,
p128
aVand then from two comes three.
p129
aVAnd so you've got this sort of replicating system.
p130
aVIt was work actually by Lionel Penrose,
p131
aVfather of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy.
p132
aVHe did a lot of this work in the '60s,
p133
aVand so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow
p134
aVas we went down the digital computer revolution, but it's now coming back.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo now I'm going to show you the hands-free, autonomous self-replication.
p137
aVSo we've tracked in the video the input string,
p138
aVwhich was green, green, yellow, yellow, green.
p139
aVWe set them off on this air hockey table.
p140
aVYou know, high science uses air hockey tables \u2014
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
V\u2014 and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy,
p145
aVbut what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string
p146
aVemerging from the parts bin that you have here.
p147
aVSo we've got autonomous replication of bit strings.
p148
aVSo, why would you want to replicate bit strings?
p149
aVWell, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme,
p150
aVthat you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy,
p151
aVand you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure.
p152
aVSo I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version:
p153
aVCan we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials
p154
aVthat will do the same thing?
p155
aa(lp156
VSo what I'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape \u2014
p157
aVthe B \u2014 assemble from a string of components
p158
aVthat follow extremely simple rules.
p159
aVAnd the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here,
p160
aVand the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design,
p161
aVwas that you don't need digital logic to do computation.
p162
aVAnd that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips.
p163
aVSo you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe,
p166
aVbut I'll show you again.
p167
aVThis is literally the colored sequence of those tiles.
p168
aVEach different color has a different magnetic polarity,
p169
aVand the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.
p170
aVNow, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory
p171
aVcan look at that, and that will satisfy you
p172
aVthat that can also do arbitrary 3D structure,
p173
aVand in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up
p174
aVand then reassemble it so it's a linear string
p175
aVthat will fold from a sequence. And now
p176
aVI can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.
p177
aVSo, you know, it's a pretty interesting world
p178
aVwhen you start looking at the world a little bit differently.
p179
aVAnd the universe is now a compiler.
p180
aVAnd so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs
p181
aVfor programming the physical universe?
p182
aVAnd how do we think about materials and structure,
p183
aVsort of as an information and computation problem?
p184
aVNot just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point,
p185
aVbut that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers.
p186
aa(lp187
VHaving totally absorbed this philosophy,
p188
aVI started looking at a lot of problems a little differently.
p189
aVWith the universe as a computer,
p190
aVyou can look at this droplet of water
p191
aVas having performed the computations.
p192
aVYou set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity,
p193
aVthe surface tension, density, etc., and then you press "execute,"
p194
aVand magically, the universe produces you a perfect ball lens.
p195
aVSo, this actually applied to the problem
p196
aVof \u2014 so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world
p197
aVdon't have access to cheap eyeglasses.
p198
aVSo can you make a machine
p199
aVthat could make any prescription lens very quickly on site?
p200
aVThis is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition.
p201
aVIf it's circular, you make a spherical lens.
p202
aVIf it's elliptical, you can make an astigmatic lens.
p203
aVYou then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure \u2014
p204
aVso that's part of the extra program.
p205
aVAnd literally with only those two inputs \u2014
p206
aVso, the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure \u2014
p207
aVyou can define an infinite number of lenses
p208
aVthat cover the range of human refractive error,
p209
aVfrom minus 12 to plus eight diopters, up to four diopters of cylinder.
p210
aVAnd then literally, you now pour on a monomer.
p211
aVYou know, I'll do a Julia Childs here.
p212
aVThis is three minutes of UV light.
p213
aVAnd you reverse the pressure on your membrane
p214
aVonce you've cooked it. Pop it out.
p215
aVI've seen this video, but I still don't know if it's going to end right.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VSo you reverse this. This is a very old movie,
p220
aVso with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible,
p221
aVbut this will show you the point.
p222
aVNow you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out.
p223
aVThat's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape.
p224
aVAnd you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters.
p225
aVAnd as I rotate it against this side shot, you'll see that that has cylinder,
p226
aVand that was programmed in \u2014
p227
aVliterally into the physics of the system.
p228
aVSo, this sort of thinking about structure as computation
p229
aVand structure as information leads to other things, like this.
p230
aa(lp231
VThis is something that my people at SQUID Labs
p232
aVare working on at the moment, called "electronic rope."
p233
aVSo literally, you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave.
p234
aVAnd under no load, it's one structure.
p235
aVUnder a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that
p236
aVby putting in a very small number of
p237
aVconducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.
p238
aVSo this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope
p239
aVat any particular point in the rope.
p240
aVJust by thinking about the physics of the world,
p241
aVmaterials as the computer,
p242
aVyou can start to do things like this.
p243
aa(lp244
VI'm going to segue a little here.
p245
aVI guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things
p246
aVthat I think about with this.
p247
aVOne thing I'm really interested about this right now is, how,
p248
aVif you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer,
p249
aVhow do we make things in a very general sense,
p250
aVand how might we share the way we make things in a general sense
p251
aVthe same way you share open source hardware?
p252
aVAnd a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits
p253
aVof having lots of people look at problems,
p254
aVshare the information and work on those things together.
p255
aVSo, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time,
p256
aVand unless Lisa Randall changes that,
p257
aVwe'll continue to move in linear time.
p258
aVSo that means anything you do, or anything you make,
p259
aVyou produce a sequence of steps \u2014
p260
aVand I think Lego in the '70s nailed this,
p261
aVand they did it most elegantly.
p262
aVBut they can show you how to build things in sequence.
p263
aVSo, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize
p264
aVthe way we make all sorts of things,
p265
aVso you end up with this sort of guy, right?
p266
aVAnd I think this applies across a very broad \u2014 sort of, a lot of concepts.
p267
aa(lp268
VYou know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said,
p269
aV"How do I get everyone to collaborate on design
p270
aVglobally to do housing for humanity?"
p271
aVAnd if you've seen Amy Smith,
p272
aVshe talks about how you get students at MIT
p273
aVto work with communities in Haiti.
p274
aVAnd I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink
p275
aVhow we define structure and materials and assembly things,
p276
aVso that we can really share the information
p277
aVon how you do those things in a more profound way
p278
aVand build on each other's source code for structure.
p279
aVI don't know exactly how to do this yet,
p280
aVbut, you know, it's something being actively thought about.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo, you know, that leads to questions
p283
aVlike, is this a compiler? Is this a sub-routine?
p284
aVInteresting things like that.
p285
aVMaybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know,
p286
aVthis is the sort of \u2014 returning to our comic characters \u2014
p287
aVthis is sort of the universe, or a different universe view,
p288
aVthat I think is going to be very prevalent in the future \u2014
p289
aVfrom biotech to materials assembly. It was great to hear Bill Joy.
p290
aVThey're starting to invest in materials science,
p291
aVbut these are the new things in materials science.
p292
aVHow do we put real information and real structure into new ideas,
p293
aVand see the world in a different way? And it's not going to be binary code
p294
aVthat defines the computers of the universe \u2014
p295
aVit's sort of an analog computer.
p296
aVBut it's definitely an interesting new worldview.
p297
aa(lp298
VI've gone too far. So that sounds like it's it.
p299
aVI've probably got a couple of minutes of questions,
p300
aVor I can show \u2014 I think they also said that I do extreme stuff
p301
aVin the introduction, so I may have to explain that.
p302
aVSo maybe I'll do that with this short video.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite,
p305
aVwhich also happens to be a minimal energy surface.
p306
aVSo returning to the droplet, again,
p307
aVthinking about the universe in a new way.
p308
aVThis is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp.
p309
aVAnd why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite?
p310
aVSo that's a kite the size of your house.
p311
aVAnd so you want that to tow boats very fast.
p312
aVSo I've been working on this a little, also,
p313
aVwith a couple of other guys.
p314
aVBut, you know, this is another way to look at the \u2014
p315
aVif you abstract again,
p316
aVthis is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe.
p317
aVYou could just hang it as a bed sheet,
p318
aVbut again, the computation of all the physics
p319
aVgives you the aerodynamic shape.
p320
aVAnd so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed
p321
aVwith systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future.

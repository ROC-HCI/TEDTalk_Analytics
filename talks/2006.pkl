VSo it was the fall of 1902,
p5
aVand President Theodore Roosevelt
p6
aVneeded a little break from the White House,
p7
aVso he took a train to Mississippi
p8
aVto do a little black bear hunting outside of a town
p9
aVcalled Smedes.
p10
aVThe first day of the hunt, they didn't see a single bear,
p11
aVso it was a big bummer for everyone,
p12
aVbut the second day, the dogs cornered one
p13
aVafter a really long chase, but by that point,
p14
aVthe president had given up
p15
aVand gone back to camp for lunch,
p16
aVso his hunting guide cracked the animal
p17
aVon the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,
p18
aVand then tied it up to a tree
p19
aVand started tooting away on his bugle
p20
aVto call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor
p21
aVof shooting it.
p22
aVThe bear was a female.
p23
aVIt was dazed, injured,
p24
aVseverely underweight, a little mangy-looking,
p25
aVand when Roosevelt saw this animal
p26
aVtied up to the tree,
p27
aVhe just couldn't bring himself to fire at it.
p28
aVHe felt like that would go against his code
p29
aVas a sportsman.
p30
aa(lp31
VA few days later, the scene was memorialized
p32
aVin a political cartoon back in Washington.
p33
aVIt was called "Drawing a Line in Mississippi,"
p34
aVand it showed Roosevelt with his gun down and his arm out,
p35
aVsparing the bear's life,
p36
aVand the bear was sitting on its hind legs
p37
aVwith these two big, frightened, wide eyes
p38
aVand little ears pricked up at the top of its head.
p39
aVIt looked really helpless, like you just wanted to
p40
aVsweep it up into your arms
p41
aVand reassure it.
p42
aVIt wouldn't have looked familiar at the time,
p43
aVbut if you go looking for the cartoon now,
p44
aVyou recognize the animal right away:
p45
aVIt's a teddy bear.
p46
aVAnd this is how the teddy bear was born.
p47
aVEssentially, toymakers took the bear from the cartoon,
p48
aVturned it into a plush toy, and then named it
p49
aVafter President Roosevelt \u2014 Teddy's bear.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I do feel a little ridiculous
p52
aVthat I'm up here on this stage
p53
aVand I'm choosing to use my time
p54
aVto tell you about a 100-year-old story
p55
aVabout the invention of a squishy kid's toy,
p56
aVbut I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear,
p57
aVinside that story is a more important story,
p58
aVa story about how dramatically our ideas
p59
aVabout nature can change,
p60
aVand also about how, on the planet right now,
p61
aVthe stories that we tell
p62
aVare dramatically changing nature.
p63
aa(lp64
VBecause think about the teddy bear.
p65
aVFor us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,
p66
aVbecause bears are so cute and cuddly,
p67
aVand who wouldn't want to give one to their kids to play with,
p68
aVbut the truth is that in 1902,
p69
aVbears weren't cute and cuddly.
p70
aVI mean, they looked the same,
p71
aVbut no one thought of them that way.
p72
aVIn 1902, bears were monsters.
p73
aVBears were something that frickin' terrified kids.
p74
aVFor generations at that point,
p75
aVthe bear had been a shorthand for all the danger
p76
aVthat people were encountering on the frontier,
p77
aVand the federal government was actually
p78
aVsystematically exterminating bears
p79
aVand lots of other predators too,
p80
aVlike coyotes and wolves.
p81
aVThese animals, they were being demonized.
p82
aVThey were called murderers
p83
aVbecause they killed people's livestock.
p84
aVOne government biologist, he explained this
p85
aVwar on animals like the bear by saying
p86
aVthat they no longer had a place
p87
aVin our advancing civilization,
p88
aVand so we were just clearing them out of the way.
p89
aVIn one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves
p90
aVhad been slaughtered.
p91
aVThe grizzly would soon be wiped out
p92
aVfrom 95 percent of its original territory,
p93
aVand whereas once there had been 30 million bison
p94
aVmoving across the plains, and you would have
p95
aVthese stories of trains having to stop
p96
aVfor four or five hours so that these thick,
p97
aVliving rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,
p98
aVnow, by 1902, there were maybe  less than 100 left in the wild.
p99
aVAnd so what I'm saying is, the teddy bear was born
p100
aVinto the middle of this great spasm of extermination,
p101
aVand you can see it as a sign that
p102
aVmaybe some people deep down
p103
aVwere starting to feel conflicted about all that killing.
p104
aVAmerica still hated the bear and feared it,
p105
aVbut all of a sudden, America also wanted
p106
aVto give the bear a great big hug.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo this is something that I've been really curious about in the last few years.
p109
aVHow do we imagine animals,
p110
aVhow do we think and feel about them,
p111
aVand how do their reputations get written
p112
aVand then rewritten in our minds?
p113
aVWe're here living in the eye of a great storm
p114
aVof extinction where half the species on the planet
p115
aVcould be gone by the end of the century,
p116
aVand so why is it that we come to care about
p117
aVsome of those species and not others?
p118
aVWell, there's a new field, a relatively new field
p119
aVof social science that started looking at
p120
aVthese questions and trying to unpack the powerful
p121
aVand sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships
p122
aVthat we have to animals,
p123
aVand I spent a lot of time looking through
p124
aVtheir academic journals,
p125
aVand all I can really say is that their findings
p126
aVare astonishingly wide-ranging.
p127
aVSo some of my favorites include that
p128
aVthe more television a person watches in Upstate New York,
p129
aVthe more he or she is afraid
p130
aVof being attacked by a black bear.
p131
aVIf you show a tiger to an American,
p132
aVthey're much more likely to assume that it's female
p133
aVand not male.
p134
aVIn a study where a fake snake
p135
aVand a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,
p136
aVdrivers hit the snake much more often than the turtle,
p137
aVand about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals
p138
aVseemed to do it on purpose.
p139
aVWomen are more likely than men to get a
p140
aV"magical feeling" when they see dolphins in the surf.
p141
aVSixty-eight percent of mothers with
p142
aV"high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem"
p143
aVidentified with the dancing cats
p144
aVin a commercial for Purina. (Laughter)
p145
aVAmericans consider lobsters
p146
aVmore important than pigeons
p147
aVbut also much, much stupider.
p148
aVWild turkeys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea otters,
p149
aVand pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo some of this is physical, right?
p152
aVWe tend to sympathize more with animals that look like us,
p153
aVand especially that resemble human babies,
p154
aVso with big, forward-facing eyes
p155
aVand circular faces,
p156
aVkind of a roly-poly posture.
p157
aVThis is why, if you get a Christmas card from, like,
p158
aVyour great aunt in Minnesota,
p159
aVthere's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it,
p160
aVand not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider.
p161
aVBut it's not all physical, right?
p162
aVThere's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals,
p163
aVand we're telling stories about these animals,
p164
aVand like all stories,
p165
aVthey are shaped by the times and the places
p166
aVin which we're telling them.
p167
aVSo think about that moment
p168
aVback in 1902 again where a ferocious bear
p169
aVbecame a teddy bear.
p170
aVWhat was the context? Well, America was urbanizing.
p171
aVFor the first time, nearly a majority of people lived in cities,
p172
aVso there was a growing distance between us and nature.
p173
aVThere was a safe space where we could
p174
aVreconsider the bear and romanticize it.
p175
aVNature could only start to seem this pure and adorable
p176
aVbecause we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore.
p177
aVAnd you can see that cycle playing out
p178
aVagain and again with all kinds of animals.
p179
aVIt seems like we're always stuck between
p180
aVdemonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,
p181
aVand then when we get very close to doing that,
p182
aVempathizing with it as an underdog
p183
aVand wanting to show it compassion.
p184
aVSo we exert our power,
p185
aVbut then we're unsettled
p186
aVby how powerful we are.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo for example, this is one of
p189
aVprobably thousands of letters and drawings
p190
aVthat kids sent to the Bush administration,
p191
aVbegging it to protect the polar bear
p192
aVunder the Endangered Species Act,
p193
aVand these were sent back in the mid-2000s,
p194
aVwhen awareness of climate change was suddenly surging.
p195
aVWe kept seeing that image of a polar bear
p196
aVstranded on a little ice floe
p197
aVlooking really morose.
p198
aVI spent days looking through these files.
p199
aVI really love them. This one's my favorite.
p200
aVIf you can see, it's a polar bear that's drowning
p201
aVand then it's also being eaten simultaneously
p202
aVby a lobster and a shark.
p203
aVThis one came from a kid named Fritz,
p204
aVand he's actually got a solution to climate change.
p205
aVHe's got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.
p206
aVHe says, "I feel bad about the polar bears.
p207
aVI like polar bears.
p208
aVEveryone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz."
p209
aVSo 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorers
p210
aVwriting about polar bears leaping into their boats
p211
aVand trying to devour them,
p212
aVeven if they lit the bear on fire,
p213
aVbut these kids don't see the polar bear that way,
p214
aVand actually they don't even see the polar bear
p215
aVthe way that I did back in the '80s.
p216
aVI mean, we thought of these animals
p217
aVas mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic.
p218
aVBut look now how quickly that climate change
p219
aVhas flipped the image of the animal in our minds.
p220
aVIt's gone from that bloodthirsty man-killer
p221
aVto this delicate, drowning victim,
p222
aVand when you think about it, that's kind of
p223
aVthe conclusion to the story
p224
aVthat the teddy bear started telling back in 1902,
p225
aVbecause back then, America had more or less
p226
aVconquered its share of the continent.
p227
aVWe were just getting around to
p228
aVpolishing off these last wild predators.
p229
aVNow, society's reach has expanded
p230
aVall the way to the top of the world,
p231
aVand it's made even these, the most remote,
p232
aVthe most powerful bears on the planet,
p233
aVseem like adorable and blameless victims.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut you know, there's also a postscript to the teddy bear story
p236
aVthat not a lot of people talk about.
p237
aVWe're going to talk about it,
p238
aVbecause even though it didn't really take long
p239
aVafter Roosevelt's hunt in 1902
p240
aVfor the toy to become a full-blown craze,
p241
aVmost people figured it was a fad,
p242
aVit was a sort of silly political novelty item
p243
aVand it would go away once the president left office,
p244
aVand so by 1909, when Roosevelt's successor,
p245
aVWilliam Howard Taft,
p246
aVwas getting ready to be inaugurated,
p247
aVthe toy industry was on the hunt
p248
aVfor the next big thing.
p249
aVThey didn't do too well.
p250
aa(lp251
VThat January, Taft was the guest of honor
p252
aVat a banquet in Atlanta,
p253
aVand for days in advance,
p254
aVthe big news was the menu.
p255
aVThey were going to be serving him
p256
aVa Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,
p257
aVcalled possum and taters.
p258
aVSo you would have a whole opossum
p259
aVroasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,
p260
aVand then sometimes they'd leave
p261
aVthe big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.
p262
aVThe one brought to Taft's table
p263
aVweighed 18 pounds.
p264
aVSo after dinner, the orchestra started to play,
p265
aVand the guests burst into song,
p266
aVand all of a sudden, Taft was surprised
p267
aVwith the presentation of a gift
p268
aVfrom a group of local supporters,
p269
aVand this was a stuffed opossum toy,
p270
aVall beady-eyed and bald-eared,
p271
aVand it was a new product they were putting forward
p272
aVto be the William Taft presidency's answer
p273
aVto Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear.
p274
aVThey were calling it the "billy possum."
p275
aVWithin 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Company
p276
aVwas up and running, brokering deals
p277
aVfor these things nationwide,
p278
aVand the Los Angeles Times announced,
p279
aVvery confidently, "The teddy bear
p280
aVhas been relegated to a seat in the rear,
p281
aVand for four years, possibly eight,
p282
aVthe children of the United States
p283
aVwill play with billy possum."
p284
aVSo from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.
p285
aVThere were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,
p286
aVbilly possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.
p287
aVThere were smaller billy possums on a stick
p288
aVthat kids could wave around like flags.
p289
aVBut even with all this marketing,
p290
aVthe life of the billy possum
p291
aVturned out to be just pathetically brief.
p292
aVThe toy was an absolute flop,
p293
aVand it was almost completely forgotten
p294
aVby the end of the year,
p295
aVand what that means is that the billy possum
p296
aVdidn't even make it to Christmastime,
p297
aVwhich when you think about it is
p298
aVa special sort of tragedy for a toy.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo we can explain that failure two ways.
p301
aVThe first, well, it's pretty obvious.
p302
aVI'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:
p303
aVOpossums are hideous. (Laughter)
p304
aVBut maybe more importantly is that
p305
aVthe story of the billy possum was all wrong,
p306
aVespecially compared
p307
aVto the backstory of the teddy bear.
p308
aVThink about it: for most of human's evolutionary history,
p309
aVwhat's made bears impressive to us
p310
aVhas been their complete independence from us.
p311
aVIt's that they live these parallel lives
p312
aVas menaces and competitors.
p313
aVBy the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,
p314
aVthat stature was being crushed,
p315
aVand the animal that he had roped to a tree
p316
aVreally was a symbol for all bears.
p317
aVWhether those animals lived or died now
p318
aVwas entirely up to the compassion
p319
aVor the indifference of people.
p320
aVThat said something really ominous
p321
aVabout the future of bears,
p322
aVbut it also said something very  unsettling about who we'd become,
p323
aVif the survival of even an animal like that
p324
aVwas up to us now.
p325
aVSo now, a century later, if you're at all
p326
aVpaying attention to what's happening in the environment,
p327
aVyou feel that discomfort so much more intensely.
p328
aVWe're living now in an age of what scientists
p329
aVhave started to call "conservation reliance,"
p330
aVand what that term means is that we've disrupted
p331
aVso much that nature can't possibly stand on its own anymore,
p332
aVand most endangered species
p333
aVare only going to survive
p334
aVif we stay out there in the landscape
p335
aVriggging the world around them in their favor.
p336
aVSo we've gone hands-on
p337
aVand we can't ever take our hands off,
p338
aVand that's a hell of a lot of work.
p339
aVRight now, we're training condors
p340
aVnot to perch on power lines.
p341
aVWe teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter
p342
aVbehind little ultra-light airplanes.
p343
aVWe're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.
p344
aVWe monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.
p345
aVSo we've gone from annihilating species
p346
aVto micromanaging the survival of a lot of species
p347
aVindefinitely, and which ones?
p348
aVWell, the ones that we've told
p349
aVcompelling stories about,
p350
aVthe ones we've decided ought to stick around.
p351
aVThe line between conservation and domestication
p352
aVis blurred.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo what I've been saying is that the stories
p355
aVthat we tell about wild animals are so subjective
p356
aVthey can be irrational
p357
aVor romanticized or sensationalized.
p358
aVSometimes they just have nothing to do with the facts.
p359
aVBut in a world of conservation reliance,
p360
aVthose stories have very real consequences,
p361
aVbecause now, how we feel about an animal
p362
aVaffects its survival
p363
aVmore than anything that you read about
p364
aVin ecology textbooks.
p365
aVStorytelling matters now.
p366
aVEmotion matters.
p367
aVOur imagination has become an ecological force.
p368
aVAnd so maybe the teddy bear worked in part
p369
aVbecause the legend of Roosevelt
p370
aVand that bear in Mississippi
p371
aVwas kind of like an allegory
p372
aVof this great responsibility that society
p373
aVwas just beginning to face up to back then.
p374
aVIt would be another 71 years
p375
aVbefore the Endangered Species Act was passed,
p376
aVbut really, here's its whole ethos
p377
aVboiled down into something like a scene
p378
aVyou'd see in a stained glass window.
p379
aVThe bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,
p380
aVand the president of the United States
p381
aVdecided to show it some mercy.
p382
aVThank you.
p383

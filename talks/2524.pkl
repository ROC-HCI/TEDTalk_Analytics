VWar has been a part of my life since I can remember.
p5
aVI was born in Afghanistan, just six months after the Soviets invaded,
p6
aVand even though I was too young to understand what was happening,
p7
aVI had a deep sense of the suffering and the fear around me.
p8
aa(lp9
VThose early experiences had a major impact on how I now think about war and conflict.
p10
aVI learned that when people have a fundamental issue at stake,
p11
aVfor most of them,
p12
aVgiving in is not an option.
p13
aVFor these types conflicts \u2014
p14
aVwhen people's rights are violated,
p15
aVwhen their countries are occupied,
p16
aVwhen they're oppressed and humiliated \u2014
p17
aVthey need a powerful way to resist and to fight back.
p18
aVWhich means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is,
p19
aVif people see it as their only choice,
p20
aVthey will use it.
p21
aVMost of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world.
p22
aVBut we're not going to end war
p23
aVby telling people that violence is morally wrong.
p24
aVInstead, we must offer them a tool
p25
aVthat's at least as powerful and as effective as violence.
p26
aa(lp27
VThis is the work I do.
p28
aVFor the past 13 years,
p29
aVI've been teaching people
p30
aVin some of the most difficult situations around the world
p31
aVhow they can use nonviolent struggle to conduct conflict.
p32
aVMost people associate this type of action with Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
p33
aVBut people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years.
p34
aVIn fact, most of the rights that we have today in this country \u2014
p35
aVas women,
p36
aVas minorities,
p37
aVas workers,
p38
aVas people of different sexual orientations
p39
aVand citizens concerned with the environment \u2014
p40
aVthese rights weren't handed to us.
p41
aVThey were won by people who fought for them
p42
aVand who sacrificed for them.
p43
aVBut because we haven't learned from this history,
p44
aVnonviolent struggle as a technique is widely misunderstood.
p45
aa(lp46
VI met recently with a group of Ethiopian activists,
p47
aVand they told me something that I hear a lot.
p48
aVThey said they'd already tried nonviolent action,
p49
aVand it hadn't worked.
p50
aVYears ago they held a protest.
p51
aVThe government arrested everyone, and that was the end of that.
p52
aVThe idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests
p53
aVis a real problem.
p54
aVBecause although protests can be a great way to show that people want change,
p55
aVon their own, they don't actually create change \u2014
p56
aVat least change that is fundamental.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VPowerful opponents are not going to give people what they want
p61
aVjust because they asked nicely ...
p62
aVor even not so nicely.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VNonviolent struggle works by destroying an opponent,
p67
aVnot physically,
p68
aVbut by identifying the institutions that an opponent needs to survive,
p69
aVand then denying them those sources of power.
p70
aVNonviolent activists can neutralize the military
p71
aVby causing soldiers to defect.
p72
aVThey can disrupt the economy through strikes and boycotts.
p73
aVAnd they can challenge government propaganda
p74
aVby creating alternative media.
p75
aa(lp76
VThere are a variety of methods that can be used to do this.
p77
aVMy colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp,
p78
aVhas identified 198 methods of nonviolent action.
p79
aVAnd protest is only one.
p80
aVLet me give you a recent example.
p81
aa(lp82
VUntil a few months ago,
p83
aVGuatemala was ruled by corrupt former military officials
p84
aVwith ties to organized crime.
p85
aVPeople were generally aware of this,
p86
aVbut most of them felt powerless to do anything about it \u2014
p87
aVuntil one group of citizens, just 12 regular people,
p88
aVput out a call on Facebook to their friends
p89
aVto meet in the central plaza, holding signs with a message:
p90
aV"Renuncia YA" \u2014
p91
aVresign already.
p92
aVTo their surprise,
p93
aV30,000 people showed up.
p94
aVThey stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country.
p95
aVAt one point,
p96
aVthe organizers delivered hundreds of eggs to various government buildings
p97
aVwith a message:
p98
aV"If you don't have the huevos" \u2014
p99
aVthe balls \u2014
p100
aV"to stop corrupt candidates from running for office,
p101
aVyou can borrow ours."
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
V(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VPresident Molina responded
p108
aVby vowing that he would never step down.
p109
aVAnd the activists realized that they couldn't just keep protesting
p110
aVand ask the president to resign.
p111
aVThey needed to leave him no choice.
p112
aVSo they organized a general strike,
p113
aVin which people throughout the country refused to work.
p114
aVIn Guatemala City alone,
p115
aVover 400 businesses and schools shut their doors.
p116
aVMeanwhile,
p117
aVfarmers throughout the country blocked major roads.
p118
aVWithin five days,
p119
aVthe president,
p120
aValong with dozens of other government officials,
p121
aVresigned already.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Applause)
p124
aa(lp125
VI've been greatly inspired
p126
aVby the creativity and bravery of people using nonviolent action
p127
aVin nearly every country in the world.
p128
aVFor example,
p129
aVrecently a group of activists in Uganda
p130
aVreleased a crate of pigs in the streets.
p131
aVYou can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VThe pigs were painted the color of the ruling party.
p136
aVOne pig was even wearing a hat,
p137
aVa hat that people recognized.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VActivists around the world are getting better at grabbing headlines,
p142
aVbut these isolated actions do very little
p143
aVif they're not part of a larger strategy.
p144
aVA general wouldn't march his troops into battle
p145
aVunless he had a plan to win the war.
p146
aVYet this is how most of the world's nonviolent movements operate.
p147
aVNonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare,
p148
aVif not more.
p149
aVIts participants must be well-trained and have clear objectives,
p150
aVand its leaders must have a strategy of how to achieve those objectives.
p151
aa(lp152
VThe technique of war has been developed over thousands of years
p153
aVwith massive resources
p154
aVand some of our best minds dedicated to understanding
p155
aVand improving how it works.
p156
aVMeanwhile, nonviolent struggle is rarely systematically studied,
p157
aVand even though the number is growing,
p158
aVthere are still only a few dozen people in the world who are teaching it.
p159
aVThis is dangerous,
p160
aVbecause we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict
p161
aVare not adequate for the new challenges that we're facing.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe US government recently admitted
p164
aVthat it's in a stalemate in its war against ISIS.
p165
aVBut what most people don't know
p166
aVis that people have stood up to ISIS using nonviolent action.
p167
aVWhen ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,
p168
aVthey announced that they were putting in place a new public school curriculum,
p169
aVbased on their own extremist ideology.
p170
aVBut on the first day of school,
p171
aVnot a single child showed up.
p172
aVParents simply refused to send them.
p173
aVThey told journalists they would rather homeschool their children
p174
aVthan to have them brainwashed.
p175
aa(lp176
VThis is an example of just one act of defiance
p177
aVin just one city.
p178
aVBut what if it was coordinated
p179
aVwith the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance
p180
aVthat have taken place against ISIS?
p181
aVWhat if the parents' boycott was part of a larger strategy
p182
aVto identify and cut off the resources that ISIS needs to function;
p183
aVthe skilled labor needed to produce food;
p184
aVthe engineers needed to extract and refine oil;
p185
aVthe media infrastructure and communications networks
p186
aVand transportation systems,
p187
aVand the local businesses that ISIS relies on?
p188
aVIt may be difficult to imagine defeating ISIS
p189
aVwith action that is nonviolent.
p190
aVBut it's time we challenge the way we think about conflict
p191
aVand the choices we have in facing it.
p192
aa(lp193
VHere's an idea worth spreading:
p194
aVlet's learn more about where nonviolent action has worked
p195
aVand how we can make it more powerful,
p196
aVjust like we do with other systems and technologies
p197
aVthat are constantly being refined to better meet human needs.
p198
aVIt may be that we can improve nonviolent action
p199
aVto a point where it is increasingly used in place of war.
p200
aVViolence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned
p201
aVin the same way that bows and arrows were,
p202
aVbecause we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective.
p203
aVWith human innovation, we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful
p204
aVthan the newest and latest technologies of war.
p205
aVThe greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence
p206
aVbut in making violence obsolete.
p207
aa(lp208
VThank you.

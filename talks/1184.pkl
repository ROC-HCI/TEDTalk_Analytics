VSo I'm going to tell you a little bit
p5
aVabout reimagining food.
p6
aVI've been interested in food for a long time.
p7
aVI taught myself to cook
p8
aVwith a bunch of big books like this.
p9
aVI went to chef school in France.
p10
aVAnd there is a way
p11
aVthe world both envisions food,
p12
aVthe way the world writes about food and learns about food.
p13
aVAnd it's largely what you would find in these books.
p14
aVAnd it's a wonderful thing.
p15
aVBut there's some things that have been going on
p16
aVsince this idea of food was established.
p17
aa(lp18
VIn the last 20 years,
p19
aVpeople have realized that science
p20
aVhas a tremendous amount to do with food.
p21
aVIn fact, understanding why cooking works
p22
aVrequires knowing the science of cooking \u2014
p23
aVsome of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth.
p24
aVBut that's not in any of those books.
p25
aVThere's also a tremendous number of techniques
p26
aVthat chefs have developed,
p27
aVsome about new aesthetics, new approaches to food.
p28
aVThere's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria.
p29
aVHe's developed a very avant-garde cuisine.
p30
aVA guy in England called Heston Blumenthal,
p31
aVhe's developed his avant-garde cuisine.
p32
aVNone of the techniques that these people have developed
p33
aVover the course of the last 20 years
p34
aVis in any of those books.
p35
aVNone of them are taught in cooking schools.
p36
aVIn order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.
p37
aVAnd finally,
p38
aVthere's the old way of viewing food
p39
aVis the old way.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd so a few years ago \u2014 fours years ago, actually \u2014
p42
aVI set out to say, is there a way
p43
aVwe can communicate science and technique and wonder?
p44
aVIs there a way we can show people food
p45
aVin a way they have not seen it before?
p46
aVSo we tried, and I'll show you what we came up with.
p47
aVThis is a picture called a cutaway.
p48
aVThis is actually the first picture I took in the book.
p49
aVThe idea here is to explain what happens
p50
aVwhen you steam broccoli.
p51
aVAnd this magic view allows you to see
p52
aVall of what's happening
p53
aVwhile the broccoli steams.
p54
aVThen each of the different little pieces around it
p55
aVexplain some fact.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd the hope was two-fold.
p58
aVOne is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli.
p59
aVBut the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people
p60
aVinto stuff that was a little more technical,
p61
aVmaybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y
p62
aVthan they otherwise would have.
p63
aVBecause with that beautiful photo,
p64
aVmaybe I can also package this little box here
p65
aVthat talks about how steaming and boiling
p66
aVactually take different amounts of time.
p67
aVSteaming ought to be faster.
p68
aVIt turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation,
p69
aVand this explains that.
p70
aa(lp71
VWell, that first cutaway picture worked,
p72
aVso we said, "Okay, let's do some more."
p73
aVSo here's another one.
p74
aVWe discovered why woks are the shape they are.
p75
aVThis shaped wok doesn't work very well;
p76
aVthis caught fire three times.
p77
aVBut we had a philosophy,
p78
aVwhich is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd one of our canning cutaways.
p83
aVOnce you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away,
p84
aVso you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.
p85
aVAnd each of these text blocks
p86
aVexplains a key thing that's going on.
p87
aVIn this case, boiling water canning
p88
aVis for canning things that are already pretty acidic.
p89
aVYou don't have to heat them up as hot
p90
aVas you would something you do pressure canning
p91
aVbecause bacterial spores can't grow in the acid.
p92
aVSo this is great for pickled vegetables,
p93
aVwhich is what we're canning here.
p94
aa(lp95
VHere's our hamburger cutaway.
p96
aVOne of our philosophies in the book
p97
aVis that no dish
p98
aVis really intrinsically any better than any other dish.
p99
aVSo you can lavish
p100
aVall the same care, all the same technique,
p101
aVon a hamburger
p102
aVas you would on some much more fancy dish.
p103
aVAnd if you do lavish as much technique as possible,
p104
aVand you try to make the highest quality hamburger,
p105
aVit gets to be a little bit involved.
p106
aVThe New York Times ran a piece
p107
aVafter my book was delayed
p108
aVand it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger
p109
aVJust Got Longer."
p110
aVBecause our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe,
p111
aVif you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff,
p112
aVit does take about 30 hours.
p113
aVOf course, you're not actually working the whole time.
p114
aVMost of the time is kind of sitting there.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe point of this cutaway
p117
aVis to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before
p118
aVand to explain the physics of hamburgers
p119
aVand the chemistry of hamburgers,
p120
aVbecause, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry \u2014
p121
aVin particular, those flames underneath the burger.
p122
aVMost of the characteristic char-grilled taste
p123
aVdoesn't come from the wood or the charcoal.
p124
aVBuying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference.
p125
aVMostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning.
p126
aVSo it's the fat that drips down and flares up
p127
aVthat causes the characteristic taste.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways?
p130
aVMost people assume we use Photoshop.
p131
aVAnd the answer is: no, not really;
p132
aVwe use a machine shop.
p133
aVAnd it turns out, the best way to cut things in half
p134
aVis to actually cut them in half.
p135
aVSo we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVWe cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half.
p138
aVThe manufacturer said,
p139
aV"What would it take for you to cut one in half?"
p140
aVI said, "It would have to show up free."
p141
aVAnd so it showed up, we used it a little while,
p142
aVwe cut it in half.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots.
p145
aVWe would glue a piece of Pyrex
p146
aVor heat-resistant glass in front.
p147
aVWe used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that.
p148
aVThe great thing is, when you cut something in half,
p149
aVyou have another half.
p150
aVSo you photograph that in exactly the same position,
p151
aVand then you can substitute in \u2014
p152
aVand that part does use Photoshop \u2014 just the edges.
p153
aVSo it's very much like in a Hollywood movie
p154
aVwhere a guy flies through the air, supported by wires,
p155
aVand then they take the wires away digitally
p156
aVso you're flying through the air.
p157
aa(lp158
VIn most cases, though, there was no glass.
p159
aVLike for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue.
p160
aVAnd so those coals that kept falling off the edge,
p161
aVwe kept having to put them back up.
p162
aVBut again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second.
p163
aVThe wok shot caught fire three times.
p164
aVWhat happens when you have your wok cut in half
p165
aVis the oil goes down into the fire
p166
aVand whoosh!
p167
aVOne of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way.
p168
aVBut hey, they grow back.
p169
aa(lp170
VIn addition to cutaways,
p171
aVwe also explain physics.
p172
aVThis is Fourier's law of heat conduction.
p173
aVIt's a partial differential equation.
p174
aVWe have the only cookbook in the world
p175
aVthat has partial differential equations in it.
p176
aVBut to make them palatable,
p177
aVwe cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire
p178
aVand photographed it like this.
p179
aVWe've got lots of little tidbits in the book.
p180
aVEverybody knows that your various appliances
p181
aVhave wattage, right?
p182
aVBut you probably don't know that much about James Watt.
p183
aVBut now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in.
p184
aVIt's a little couple paragraphs
p185
aVto explain why we call that unit of heat the watt,
p186
aVand where he got his inspiration.
p187
aVIt turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery
p188
aVto understand why they were burning so damn much peat
p189
aVto distill the whiskey.
p190
aa(lp191
VWe also did a lot of calculation.
p192
aVI personally wrote thousands of lines of code
p193
aVto write this cookbook.
p194
aVHere's a calculation
p195
aVthat shows how the intensity of a barbecue,
p196
aVor other radiant heat source, goes
p197
aVas you move away from it.
p198
aVSo as you move vertically away from this surface,
p199
aVthe heat falls off.
p200
aVAs you move side to side, it moves off.
p201
aVThat horn-shaped region
p202
aVis what we call the sweet spot.
p203
aVThat's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent.
p204
aVSo that's the place where you really want to cook.
p205
aVAnd it's got this funny horn-shaped thing,
p206
aVwhich as far as I know, again,
p207
aVthe first cookbook to ever do this.
p208
aVNow it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it.
p209
aVYou know, there's two ways
p210
aVyou can make a product.
p211
aVYou can do lots of market research
p212
aVand do focus groups
p213
aVand figure out what people really want,
p214
aVor you can just kind of go for it
p215
aVand make the book you want and hope other people like it.
p216
aa(lp217
VHere's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger.
p218
aVIf you really want great hamburger,
p219
aVit turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain.
p220
aVAnd it's really simple, as you can see here.
p221
aVAs it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray,
p222
aVand you just take it off in little passes,
p223
aVbuild it up, slice it vertically.
p224
aVHere's the final hamburger.
p225
aVThis is the 30-hour hamburger.
p226
aVWe make every aspect of this burger.
p227
aVThe lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it.
p228
aVWe also have things about how to make the bun.
p229
aVThere's a mushroom, ketchup \u2014 it goes on and on.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here.
p232
aVThe popcorn is illustrating
p233
aVa key thing in physics.
p234
aVIsn't that beautiful?
p235
aVWe have a very high-speed camera,
p236
aVwhich we had lots of fun with on the book.
p237
aVThe key physics principle here
p238
aVis when water boils to steam
p239
aVit expands by a factor of 1,600.
p240
aVThat's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn.
p241
aVSo it's a great illustration of that.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual.
p244
aVWe have a chapter on gels.
p245
aVAnd because people watch Mythbusters and CSI,
p246
aVI thought, well, let's put in a recipe
p247
aVfor a ballistics gelatin.
p248
aVWell, if you have a high-speed camera,
p249
aVand you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around,
p250
aVpretty soon somebody does this.
p251
aV(Gasps)
p252
aVNow the amazing thing here
p253
aVis that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic
p254
aVwhat happens to human flesh when you get shot \u2014 that's why you shouldn't get shot.
p255
aVThe other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down,
p256
aVit falls back down as a nice block.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnyway, here's the book.
p259
aVHere it is.
p260
aV2,438 pages.
p261
aVAnd they're nice big pages too.
p262
aV(Applause)
p263
aVA friend of mine complained
p264
aVthat this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen,
p265
aVso there's a sixth volume
p266
aVthat has washable, waterproof paper.
p267
aa(lp268

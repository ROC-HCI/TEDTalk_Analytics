VMy grandfather was a cobbler.
p5
aVBack in the day, he made custom-made shoes.
p6
aVI never got to meet him.
p7
aVHe perished in the Holocaust.
p8
aVBut I did inherit his love for making,
p9
aVexcept that it doesn't exist that much anymore.
p10
aVYou see, while the Industrial Revolution
p11
aVdid a great deal to improve humanity,
p12
aVit eradicated the very skill
p13
aVthat my grandfather loved,
p14
aVand it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut all of that is about to change with 3D printing,
p17
aVand it all started with this,
p18
aVthe very first part
p19
aVthat was ever printed.
p20
aVIt's a little older than TED.
p21
aVIt was printed in 1983
p22
aVby Chuck Hull,
p23
aVwho invented 3D printing.
p24
aVBut the thing that I want to talk to you about today,
p25
aVthe big idea that I want to discuss with you,
p26
aVis not that 3D printing
p27
aVis going to catapult us into the future,
p28
aVbut rather that it's actually going
p29
aVto connect us with our heritage,
p30
aVand it's going to usher in a new era
p31
aVof localized, distributed manufacturing
p32
aVthat is actually based
p33
aVon digital fabrication.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo think about useful things.
p36
aVYou all know your shoe size.
p37
aVHow many of you know the size
p38
aVof the bridge of your nose
p39
aVor the distance between your temples?
p40
aVAnybody?
p41
aVWouldn't it be awesome if you could,
p42
aVfor the first time, get eyewear
p43
aVthat actually fits you perfectly
p44
aVand doesn't require any hinge assembly,
p45
aVso chances are, the hinges are not going to break?
p46
aVBut the implications of 3D printing
p47
aVgo well beyond the tips of our noses.
p48
aa(lp49
VWhen I met Amanda for the first time,
p50
aVshe could already stand up and walk a little bit
p51
aVeven though she was paralyzed from the waist down,
p52
aVbut she complained to me that her suit
p53
aVwas uncomfortable.
p54
aVIt was a beautiful robotic suit
p55
aVmade by Ekso Bionics,
p56
aVbut it wasn't inspired by her body.
p57
aVIt wasn't made to measure.
p58
aVSo she challenged me to make her something
p59
aVthat was a little bit more feminine,
p60
aVa little bit more elegant,
p61
aVand lightweight,
p62
aVand like good tailors,
p63
aVwe thought that we would measure her digitally.
p64
aVAnd we did. We built her an amazing suit.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe incredible part about what I learned
p67
aVfrom Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing
p68
aVand we say to ourselves,
p69
aVit's going to replace traditional methods.
p70
aVAmanda looked at it and she said,
p71
aVit's an opportunity for me
p72
aVto reclaim my symmetry
p73
aVand to embrace my authenticity.
p74
aVAnd you know what? She's not standing still.
p75
aVShe now wants to walk in high heels.
p76
aa(lp77
VIt doesn't stop there.
p78
aV3D printing is changing
p79
aVpersonalized medical devices as we know them,
p80
aVfrom new, beautiful, conformal,
p81
aVventilated scoliosis braces
p82
aVto millions of dental restorations
p83
aVand to beautiful bracings
p84
aVfor amputees,
p85
aVanother opportunity to emotionally reconnect
p86
aVwith your symmetry.
p87
aVAnd as we sit here today,
p88
aVyou can go wireless on your braces
p89
aVwith clear aligners,
p90
aVor your dental restorations.
p91
aVMillions of in-the-ear hearing aids
p92
aVare already 3D printed today.
p93
aVMillions of people are served today
p94
aVfrom these devices.
p95
aVWhat about full knee replacements,
p96
aVfrom your data, made to measure,
p97
aVwhere all of the tools and guides are 3D printed?
p98
aVG.E. is using 3D printing
p99
aVto make the next generation LEAP engine
p100
aVthat will save fuel to the tune
p101
aVof about 15 percent
p102
aVand cost for an airline
p103
aVof about 14 million dollars.
p104
aVGood for G.E., right?
p105
aVAnd their customers and the environment.
p106
aVBut, you know, the even better news
p107
aVis that this technology is no longer reserved
p108
aVfor deep-pocketed corporations.
p109
aVPlanetary Resources, a startup
p110
aVfor space explorations
p111
aVis going to put out its first  space probe later this year.
p112
aVIt was a fraction of a NASA spaceship,
p113
aVit costs a fraction of its cost,
p114
aVand it's made with less than a dozen moving parts,
p115
aVand it's going to be out in space later this year.
p116
aVGoogle is taking on this very audacious project
p117
aVof making the block phone, the Ara.
p118
aVIt's only possible because of the development
p119
aVof high-speed 3D printing that for the first time
p120
aVwill make functional, usable modules
p121
aVthat will go into it.
p122
aVA real moonshot, powered by 3D printing.
p123
aa(lp124
VHow about food?
p125
aVWhat if we could, for the first time,
p126
aVmake incredible delectables
p127
aVlike this beautiful TED Teddy here,
p128
aVthat are edible?
p129
aVWhat if we could completely change the experience,
p130
aVlike you see with that absinthe serving
p131
aVthat is completely 3D printed?
p132
aVAnd what if we could begin to put ingredients
p133
aVand colors and flavors in every taste,
p134
aVwhich means not only delicious foods
p135
aVbut the promise of personalized nutrition
p136
aVaround the corner?
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing.
p139
aVWith 3D printing, complexity is free.
p140
aVThe printer doesn't care
p141
aVif it makes the most rudimentary shape
p142
aVor the most complex shape,
p143
aVand that is completely turning design
p144
aVand manufacturing on its head as we know it.
p145
aVMany people think that 3D printing will be
p146
aVthe end of manufacturing as we know it.
p147
aVI think that it's the opportunity to put
p148
aVtomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters
p149
aVthat will create endless abundance
p150
aVof job opportunities,
p151
aVand with that,
p152
aVeverybody can become an expert maker
p153
aVand an expert manufacturer.
p154
aVThat will take new tools.
p155
aVNot everybody knows how to use CAD,
p156
aVso we're developing haptics,
p157
aVperceptual devices
p158
aVthat will allow you to touch
p159
aVand feel your designs
p160
aVas if you play with digital clay.
p161
aVWhen you do things like that,
p162
aVand we also developed things that take
p163
aVphysical photographs that are instantly printable,
p164
aVit will make it easier to create content,
p165
aVbut with all of the unimagined,
p166
aVwe will also have the unintended,
p167
aVlike democratized counterfeiting
p168
aVand ubiquitous illegal possession.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo many people ask me,
p171
aVwill we have a 3D printer in every home?
p172
aVI think it's the wrong question to ask.
p173
aVThe right question to ask is,
p174
aVhow will 3D printing change my life?
p175
aVOr, in other words, what room in my house
p176
aVwill 3D printing fit in?
p177
aa(lp178
VSo everything that you see here
p179
aVhas been 3D printed,
p180
aVincluding these shoes
p181
aVat the Amsterdam fashion show.
p182
aVNow, these are not my grandfather's shoes.
p183
aVThese are shoes that represent
p184
aVthe continuation of his passion
p185
aVfor hyper-local manufacturing.
p186
aVMy grandfather didn't get to see Nike
p187
aVprinting cleats for the recent Super Bowl,
p188
aVand my father didn't get to see me standing
p189
aVin my hybridized 3D printed shoes.
p190
aVHe passed away three years ago.
p191
aVBut Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all,
p192
aVis right here in the house today,
p193
aVand thanks to him,
p194
aVI can say, thanks to his invention, I can say
p195
aVthat I am a cobbler too,
p196
aVand by standing in these shoes
p197
aVI am honoring my past
p198
aVwhile manufacturing the future.
p199
aa(lp200
VThank you.

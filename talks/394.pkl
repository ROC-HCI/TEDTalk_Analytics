VSo, about three years ago I was in London,
p5
aVand somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said,
p6
aVI represent a group of people,
p7
aVand we want to start an institute in theoretical physics.
p8
aVWe have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well.
p9
aVWe want to be in the forefront fields,
p10
aVand we want to do it differently.
p11
aVWe want to get out of this thing
p12
aVwhere the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power
p13
aVand decide what science gets done.
p14
aVIt took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.
p15
aa(lp16
VThree years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics
p17
aVin Waterloo, Ontario. It\u2019s the most exciting job I\u2019ve ever had.
p18
aVAnd it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had a job where I\u2019m afraid to go away
p19
aVbecause of everything that\u2019s going to happen in this week when I\u2019m here.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVBut in any case, what I\u2019m going to do in my little bit of time
p22
aVis take you on a quick tour of some of the things
p23
aVthat we talk about and we think about.
p24
aVSo, we think a lot about what really makes science work?
p25
aVThe first thing that anybody who knows science,
p26
aVand has been around science,
p27
aVis that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method
p28
aVis wrong. There is no method.
p29
aVOn the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together
p30
aVas a community, from incomplete evidence
p31
aVto conclusions that we all agree about.
p32
aVAnd this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo how does it work?
p35
aVWell, my belief is that it works
p36
aVbecause scientists are a community bound together by an ethics.
p37
aVAnd here are some of the ethical principles.
p38
aVI\u2019m not going to read them all to you because I\u2019m not in teacher mode.
p39
aVI\u2019m in entertain, amaze mode.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VBut one of the principles is that everybody
p43
aVwho is part of the community gets to fight and argue
p44
aVas hard as they can for what they believe.
p45
aVBut we\u2019re all disciplined by the understanding
p46
aVthat the only people who are going to decide, you know,
p47
aVwhether I\u2019m right or somebody else is right,
p48
aVare the people in our community in the next generation,
p49
aVin 30 and 50 years.
p50
aVSo it\u2019s this combination of respect
p51
aVfor the tradition and community we\u2019re in,
p52
aVand rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere,
p53
aVthat makes science work.
p54
aVAnd being in this process of being in a community
p55
aVthat reasons from shared evidence to conclusions,
p56
aVI believe, teaches us about democracy.
p57
aVNot only is there a relationship between the ethics of science
p58
aVand the ethics of being a citizen in democracy,
p59
aVbut there has been, historically, a relationship
p60
aVbetween how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is,
p61
aVand how people think about the society that they live in.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd I want to talk about three stages in that evolution.
p64
aVThe first science of cosmology that was anything like science
p65
aVwas Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical.
p66
aVThe earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres,
p67
aVthe sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere,
p68
aVwhere the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place.
p69
aVAnd Aristotle\u2019s law of motion was that everything
p70
aVgoes to its natural place, which was of course,
p71
aVthe rule of the society that Aristotle lived in,
p72
aVand more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity,
p73
aVembraced Aristotle and blessed it.
p74
aVAnd the idea is that everything is defined.
p75
aVWhere something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere,
p76
aVthe celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal,
p77
aVperfect realm, where lives God,
p78
aVwho is the ultimate judge of everything.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo that is both Aristotelian cosmology,
p81
aVand in a certain sense, medieval society.
p82
aVNow, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about
p83
aVspace and time and motion and so forth of Newton.
p84
aVAnd at the same time there was a revolution in social thought
p85
aVof John Locke and his collaborators.
p86
aVAnd they were very closely associated.
p87
aVIn fact, Newton and Locke were friends.
p88
aVTheir way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand,
p89
aVand a society on the other hand, were closely related.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd let me show you.
p92
aVIn a Newtonian universe, there\u2019s no center \u2014 thank you.
p93
aVThere are particles and they move around
p94
aVwith respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time.
p95
aVIt\u2019s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space,
p96
aVbecause that\u2019s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are,
p97
aVbut with respect to this absolute notion of space,
p98
aVwhich for Newton was God.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, similarly, in Locke\u2019s society there are individuals
p101
aVwho have certain rights, properties in a formal sense,
p102
aVand those are defined with respect to some absolute,
p103
aVabstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth,
p104
aVwhich are independent of what else has happened in the society.
p105
aVOf who else there is, of the history and so forth.
p106
aVThere is also an omniscient observer
p107
aVwho knows everything, who is God,
p108
aVwho is in a certain sense outside the universe,
p109
aVbecause he has no role in anything that happens,
p110
aVbut is in a certain sense everywhere,
p111
aVbecause space is just the way that God knows
p112
aVwhere everything is, according to Newton, OK?
p113
aa(lp114
VSo this is the foundations of what\u2019s called, traditionally,
p115
aVliberal political theory and Newtonian physics.
p116
aVNow, in the 20th century we had a revolution
p117
aVthat was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century,
p118
aVand which is still going on.
p119
aVIt was begun with the invention
p120
aVof relativity theory and quantum theory.
p121
aVAnd merging them together to make the final quantum theory
p122
aVof space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that,
p123
aVsomething that\u2019s going on right now.
p124
aVAnd in this universe there\u2019s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK.
p125
aVThis universe is described by being a network of relationships.
p126
aa(lp127
VSpace is just one aspect, so there\u2019s no meaning to say
p128
aVabsolutely where something is.
p129
aVThere\u2019s only where it is relative to everything else that is.
p130
aVAnd this network of relations is ever-evolving.
p131
aVSo we call it a relational universe.
p132
aVAll properties of things are about these kinds of relationships.
p133
aVAnd also, if you\u2019re embedded in such a network of relationships,
p134
aVyour view of the world has to do with what information
p135
aVcomes to you through the network of relations.
p136
aVAnd there\u2019s no place for an omniscient observer
p137
aVor an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything.
p138
aVSo this is general relativity, this is quantum theory.
p139
aVThis is also, if you talk to legal scholars,
p140
aVthe foundations of new ideas in legal thought.
p141
aVThey\u2019re thinking about the same things.
p142
aVAnd not only that, they make the analogy
p143
aVto relativity theory and cosmology often.
p144
aVSo there\u2019s an interesting discussion going on there.
p145
aVThis last view of cosmology is called the relational view.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo the main slogan here is that there\u2019s nothing outside the universe,
p148
aVwhich means that there\u2019s no place
p149
aVto put an explanation for something outside.
p150
aVSo in such a relational universe,
p151
aVif you come upon something that\u2019s ordered and structured,
p152
aVlike this device here, or that device there,
p153
aVor something beautiful, like all the living things,
p154
aVall of you guys in the room \u2014
p155
aV"guys" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women.
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VThen you want to know, you\u2019re a person,
p159
aVyou want to know how is it made.
p160
aVAnd in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself.
p161
aVThere must be mechanisms of self-organization
p162
aVinside the universe that make things.
p163
aVBecause there\u2019s no place to put a maker outside,
p164
aVas there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe.
p165
aVSo in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization
p168
aVthat suffice to explain all of us and everything we see.
p169
aVSo it works. But not only that,
p170
aVif you think about how natural selection works,
p171
aVthen it turns out that natural selection
p172
aVwould only make sense in such a relational universe.
p173
aVThat is, natural selection works on properties,
p174
aVlike fitness, which are about relationships
p175
aVof some species to some other species.
p176
aVDarwin wouldn\u2019t make sense in an Aristotelian universe,
p177
aVand wouldn\u2019t really make sense in a Newtonian universe.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo a theory of biology based on natural selection
p180
aVrequires a relational notion of
p181
aVwhat are the properties of biological systems.
p182
aVAnd if you push that all the way down, really,
p183
aVit makes the best sense in a relational universe
p184
aVwhere all properties are relational.
p185
aVNow, not only that, but Einstein taught us
p186
aVthat gravity is the result of the world being relational.
p187
aVIf it wasn\u2019t for gravity, there wouldn\u2019t be life,
p188
aVbecause gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time,
p189
aVkeeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth,
p190
aVout of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve.
p191
aa(lp192
VIn the 20th century,
p193
aVwe saw the independent development of two big themes in science.
p194
aVIn the biological sciences, they explored
p195
aVthe implications of the notion that order and complexity
p196
aVand structure arise in a self-organized way.
p197
aVThat was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth.
p198
aVAnd slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences,
p199
aVthe human sciences, economics, et cetera.
p200
aVAt the same time, we physicists
p201
aVhave been busy trying to make sense of
p202
aVand build on and integrate the discoveries
p203
aVof quantum theory and relativity.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd what we\u2019ve been working out is the implications, really,
p206
aVof the idea that the universe is made up of relations.
p207
aV21st-century science is going to be driven
p208
aVby the integration of these two ideas:
p209
aVthe triumph of relational ways of thinking
p210
aVabout the world, on the one hand,
p211
aVand self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world,
p212
aVon the other hand.
p213
aVAnd also, is that in the 21st century
p214
aVour thinking about space and time and cosmology,
p215
aVand our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve.
p216
aVAnd what they\u2019re evolving towards is the union
p217
aVof these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, if you think about democracy from this perspective,
p220
aVa new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes
p221
aVthat there are many different interests, many different agendas,
p222
aVmany different individuals, many different points of view.
p223
aVEach one is incomplete, because you\u2019re embedded
p224
aVin a network of relationships.
p225
aVAny actor in a democracy is embedded
p226
aVin a network of relationships.
p227
aVAnd you understand some things better than other things,
p228
aVand because of that there\u2019s a continual jostling
p229
aVand give and take, which is politics.
p230
aVAnd politics is, in the ideal sense,
p231
aVthe way in which we continually address
p232
aVour network of relations in order to achieve
p233
aVa better life and a better society.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd I also think that science will never go away and \u2014
p236
aVI\u2019m finishing on this line.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVIn fact, I\u2019m finished. Science will never go away.

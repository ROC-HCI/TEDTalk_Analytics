VSo I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack,
p5
aVand all it requires of you is this:
p6
aVthat you change your posture for two minutes.
p7
aVBut before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now
p8
aVdo a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body.
p9
aVSo how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?
p10
aVMaybe you're hunching, crossing your legs, maybe wrapping your ankles.
p11
aVSometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
p12
aVSometimes we spread out. (Laughter)
p13
aVI see you.
p14
aVSo I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.
p15
aVWe're going to come back to that in a few minutes,
p16
aVand I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit,
p17
aVit could significantly change the way your life unfolds.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, we're really fascinated with body language,
p20
aVand we're particularly interested in other people's body language.
p21
aVYou know, we're interested in, like, you know \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p22
aVan awkward interaction, or a smile,
p23
aVor a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink,
p24
aVor maybe even something like a handshake.
p25
aa(lp26
VNarrator: Here they are arriving at Number 10.
p27
aVThis lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States.
p28
aVHere comes the Prime Minister \u2014 No. (Laughter) (Applause)
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p31
aa(lp32
VAmy Cuddy: So a handshake, or the lack of a handshake,
p33
aVcan have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks.
p34
aVEven the BBC and The New York Times.
p35
aVSo obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior,
p36
aVor body language \u2014 but we call it nonverbals as social scientists \u2014
p37
aVit's language, so we think about communication.
p38
aVWhen we think about communication, we think about interactions.
p39
aVSo what is your body language communicating to me?
p40
aVWhat's mine communicating to you?
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this.
p43
aVSo social scientists have spent a lot of time
p44
aVlooking at the effects of our body language,
p45
aVor other people's body language, on judgments.
p46
aVAnd we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.
p47
aVAnd those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes
p48
aVlike who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.
p49
aVFor example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University,
p50
aVshows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips
p51
aVof real physician-patient interactions,
p52
aVtheir judgments of the physician's niceness
p53
aVpredict whether or not that physician will be sued.
p54
aVSo it doesn't have to do so much
p55
aVwith whether or not that physician was incompetent,
p56
aVbut do we like that person and how they interacted?
p57
aVEven more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton
p58
aVhas shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces
p59
aVin just one second predict 70 percent
p60
aVof U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes,
p61
aVand even, let's go digital,
p62
aVemoticons used well in online negotiations
p63
aVcan lead you to claim more value from that negotiation.
p64
aVIf you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
p65
aa(lp66
VSo when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others,
p67
aVhow they judge us and what the outcomes are.
p68
aVWe tend to forget, though, the other audience
p69
aVthat's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's ourselves.
p70
aVWe are also influenced by our nonverbals,
p71
aVour thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo what nonverbals am I talking about?
p74
aVI'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice,
p75
aVand I teach at a competitive business school,
p76
aVso it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.
p77
aVI became especially interested in nonverbal expressions
p78
aVof power and dominance.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?
p81
aVWell, this is what they are.
p82
aVSo in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.
p83
aVSo you make yourself big, you stretch out,
p84
aVyou take up space, you're basically opening up.
p85
aVIt's about opening up.
p86
aVAnd this is true across the animal kingdom.
p87
aVIt's not just limited to primates.
p88
aVAnd humans do the same thing. (Laughter)
p89
aVSo they do this both when they have power sort of chronically,
p90
aVand also when they're feeling powerful in the moment.
p91
aVAnd this one is especially interesting because it really shows us
p92
aVhow universal and old these expressions of power are.
p93
aVThis expression, which is known as pride,
p94
aVJessica Tracy has studied.
p95
aVShe shows that people who are born with sight
p96
aVand people who are congenitally blind do this
p97
aVwhen they win at a physical competition.
p98
aVSo when they cross the finish line and they've won,
p99
aVit doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it.
p100
aVThey do this.
p101
aVSo the arms up in the V, the chin is slightly lifted.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhat do we do when we feel powerless?
p104
aVWe do exactly the opposite.
p105
aVWe close up. We wrap ourselves up.
p106
aVWe make ourselves small.
p107
aVWe don't want to bump into the person next to us.
p108
aVSo again, both animals and humans do the same thing.
p109
aVAnd this is what happens when you put together high and low power.
p110
aVSo what we tend to do when it comes to power
p111
aVis that we complement the other's nonverbals.
p112
aVSo if someone is being really powerful with us,
p113
aVwe tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them.
p114
aVWe do the opposite of them.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo I'm watching this behavior in the classroom,
p117
aVand what do I notice?
p118
aVI notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals.
p119
aVSo you have people who are like caricatures of alphas,
p120
aVreally coming into the room, they get right into the middle of the room
p121
aVbefore class even starts, like they really want to occupy space.
p122
aVWhen they sit down, they're sort of spread out.
p123
aVThey raise their hands like this.
p124
aVYou have other people who are virtually collapsing
p125
aVwhen they come in. As soon they come in, you see it.
p126
aVYou see it on their faces and their bodies,
p127
aVand they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny,
p128
aVand they go like this when they raise their hand.
p129
aa(lp130
VI notice a couple of things about this.
p131
aVOne, you're not going to be surprised.
p132
aVIt seems to be related to gender.
p133
aVSo women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.
p134
aVWomen feel chronically less powerful than men,
p135
aVso this is not surprising.
p136
aa(lp137
VBut the other thing I noticed
p138
aVis that it also seemed to be related to the extent
p139
aVto which the students were participating, and how well they were participating.
p140
aVAnd this is really important in the MBA classroom,
p141
aVbecause participation counts for half the grade.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.
p144
aVYou get these equally qualified women and men coming in
p145
aVand then you get these differences in grades,
p146
aVand it seems to be partly attributable to participation.
p147
aVSo I started to wonder, you know, okay,
p148
aVso you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating.
p149
aVIs it possible that we could get people to fake it
p150
aVand would it lead them to participate more?
p151
aa(lp152
VSo my main collaborator Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,
p153
aVand I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it?
p154
aVLike, can you do this just for a little while
p155
aVand actually experience a behavioral outcome
p156
aVthat makes you seem more powerful?
p157
aVSo we know that our nonverbals govern how other people
p158
aVthink and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence.
p159
aVBut our question really was,
p160
aVdo our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves?
p161
aa(lp162
VThere's some evidence that they do.
p163
aVSo, for example, we smile when we feel happy,
p164
aVbut also, when we're forced to smile
p165
aVby holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy.
p166
aVSo it goes both ways.
p167
aVWhen it comes to power, it also goes both ways.
p168
aVSo when you feel powerful,
p169
aVyou're more likely to do this,
p170
aVbut it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful,
p171
aVyou are more likely to actually feel powerful.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo the second question really was, you know,
p174
aVso we know that our minds change our bodies,
p175
aVbut is it also true that our bodies change our minds?
p176
aVAnd when I say minds, in the case of the powerful,
p177
aVwhat am I talking about?
p178
aVSo I'm talking about thoughts and feelings
p179
aVand the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings,
p180
aVand in my case, that's hormones. I look at hormones.
p181
aVSo what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like?
p182
aVSo powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly,
p183
aVmore assertive and more confident, more optimistic.
p184
aVThey actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance.
p185
aVThey also tend to be able to think more abstractly.
p186
aVSo there are a lot of differences. They take more risks.
p187
aVThere are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people.
p188
aVPhysiologically, there also are differences
p189
aVon two key hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone,
p190
aVand cortisol, which is the stress hormone.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies
p193
aVhave high testosterone and low cortisol,
p194
aVand powerful and effective leaders
p195
aValso have high testosterone and low cortisol.
p196
aVSo what does that mean? When you think about power,
p197
aVpeople tended to think only about testosterone,
p198
aVbecause that was about dominance.
p199
aVBut really, power is also about how you react to stress.
p200
aVSo do you want the high-power leader that's dominant,
p201
aVhigh on testosterone, but really stress reactive?
p202
aVProbably not, right?
p203
aVYou want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant,
p204
aVbut not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo we know that in primate hierarchies,
p207
aVif an alpha needs to take over,
p208
aVif an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly,
p209
aVwithin a few days, that individual's testosterone has gone up
p210
aVsignificantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly.
p211
aVSo we have this evidence, both that the body can shape
p212
aVthe mind, at least at the facial level,
p213
aVand also that role changes can shape the mind.
p214
aVSo what happens, okay, you take a role change,
p215
aVwhat happens if you do that at a really minimal level,
p216
aVlike this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention?
p217
aV"For two minutes," you say, "I want you to stand like this,
p218
aVand it's going to make you feel more powerful."
p219
aa(lp220
VSo this is what we did.
p221
aVWe decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment,
p222
aVand these people adopted, for two minutes,
p223
aVeither high-power poses or low-power poses,
p224
aVand I'm just going to show you five of the poses,
p225
aValthough they took on only two.
p226
aVSo here's one.
p227
aVA couple more.
p228
aVThis one has been dubbed the "Wonder Woman" by the media.
p229
aVHere are a couple more.
p230
aVSo you can be standing or you can be sitting.
p231
aVAnd here are the low-power poses.
p232
aVSo you're folding up, you're making yourself small.
p233
aVThis one is very low-power.
p234
aVWhen you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo this is what happens.
p237
aVThey come in, they spit into a vial,
p238
aVfor two minutes, we say, "You need to do this or this."
p239
aVThey don't look at pictures of the poses.
p240
aVWe don't want to prime them with a concept of power.
p241
aVWe want them to be feeling power.
p242
aVSo two minutes they do this.
p243
aVWe then ask them, "How powerful do you feel?" on a series of items,
p244
aVand then we give them an opportunity to gamble,
p245
aVand then we take another saliva sample.
p246
aVThat's it. That's the whole experiment.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo this is what we find.
p249
aVRisk tolerance, which is the gambling,
p250
aVwe find that when you are in the high-power pose condition,
p251
aV86 percent of you will gamble.
p252
aVWhen you're in the low-power pose condition,
p253
aVonly 60 percent, and that's a whopping significant difference.
p254
aa(lp255
VHere's what we find on testosterone.
p256
aVFrom their baseline when they come in,
p257
aVhigh-power people experience about a 20-percent increase,
p258
aVand low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease.
p259
aVSo again, two minutes, and you get these changes.
p260
aVHere's what you get on cortisol.
p261
aVHigh-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease,
p262
aVand the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase.
p263
aVSo two minutes lead to these hormonal changes
p264
aVthat configure your brain
p265
aVto basically be either assertive, confident and comfortable,
p266
aVor really stress-reactive, and feeling sort of shut down.
p267
aVAnd we've all had the feeling, right?
p268
aVSo it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves,
p269
aVso it's not just others, but it's also ourselves.
p270
aVAlso, our bodies change our minds.
p271
aa(lp272
VBut the next question, of course,
p273
aVis, can power posing for a few minutes
p274
aVreally change your life in meaningful ways?
p275
aVThis is in the lab, it's this little task, it's just a couple of minutes.
p276
aVWhere can you actually apply this?
p277
aVWhich we cared about, of course.
p278
aVAnd so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations,
p279
aVlike social threat situations.
p280
aVWhere are you being evaluated, either by your friends?
p281
aVFor teenagers, it's at the lunchroom table.
p282
aVFor some people it's speaking at a school board meeting.
p283
aVIt might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this
p284
aVor doing a job interview.
p285
aVWe decided that the one that most people could relate to
p286
aVbecause most people had been through, was the job interview.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo we published these findings,
p289
aVand the media are all over it,
p290
aVand they say, Okay, so this is what you do
p291
aVwhen you go in for the job interview, right?
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VYou know, so we were of course horrified, and said,
p296
aVOh my God, no, that's not what we meant at all.
p297
aVFor numerous reasons, no, don't do that.
p298
aVAgain, this is not about you talking to other people.
p299
aVIt's you talking to yourself.
p300
aVWhat do you do before you go into a job interview? You do this.
p301
aVYou're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone \u2014
p302
aVor your Android, not trying to leave anyone out.
p303
aVYou're looking at your notes,
p304
aVyou're hunching up, making yourself small,
p305
aVwhen really what you should be doing maybe is this,
p306
aVlike, in the bathroom, right? Do that. Find two minutes.
p307
aVSo that's what we want to test. Okay?
p308
aVSo we bring people into a lab,
p309
aVand they do either high- or low-power poses again,
p310
aVthey go through a very stressful job interview.
p311
aVIt's five minutes long. They are being recorded.
p312
aVThey're being judged also,
p313
aVand the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback,
p314
aVso they look like this.
p315
aVImagine this is the person interviewing you.
p316
aVSo for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.
p317
aVPeople hate this.
p318
aVIt's what Marianne LaFrance calls "standing in social quicksand."
p319
aVSo this really spikes your cortisol.
p320
aVSo this is the job interview we put them through,
p321
aVbecause we really wanted to see what happened.
p322
aVWe then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.
p323
aVThey're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions.
p324
aVThey have no idea who's been posing in what pose,
p325
aVand they end up looking at these sets of tapes,
p326
aVand they say, "We want to hire these people,"
p327
aVall the high-power posers.
p328
aV"We don't want to hire these people.
p329
aVWe also evaluate these people much more positively overall."
p330
aVBut what's driving it?
p331
aVIt's not about the content of the speech.
p332
aVIt's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.
p333
aVBecause we rate them on all these variables
p334
aVrelated to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech?
p335
aVHow good is it? What are their qualifications?
p336
aVNo effect on those things. This is what's affected.
p337
aVThese kinds of things.
p338
aVPeople are bringing their true selves, basically.
p339
aVThey're bringing themselves.
p340
aVThey bring their ideas, but as themselves,
p341
aVwith no, you know, residue over them.
p342
aVSo this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo when I tell people about this,
p345
aVthat our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior,
p346
aVand our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me,
p347
aV"It feels fake." Right?
p348
aVSo I said, fake it till you make it.
p349
aVIt's not me.
p350
aVI don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud.
p351
aVI don't want to feel like an impostor.
p352
aVI don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here.
p353
aVAnd that really resonated with me,
p354
aVbecause I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor
p355
aVand feeling like I'm not supposed to be here.
p356
aa(lp357
VWhen I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.
p358
aVI was thrown out of a car, rolled several times.
p359
aVI was thrown from the car.
p360
aVAnd I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,
p361
aVand I had been withdrawn from college,
p362
aVand I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations,
p363
aVwhich was very traumatic.
p364
aVI knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart,
p365
aVand I had been called gifted as a child.
p366
aVSo I'm taken out of college, I keep trying to go back.
p367
aVThey say, "You're not going to finish college.
p368
aVJust, you know, there are other things for you to do,
p369
aVbut that's not going to work out for you."
p370
aa(lp371
VSo I really struggled with this, and I have to say,
p372
aVhaving your identity taken from you, your core identity,
p373
aVand for me it was being smart,
p374
aVhaving that taken from you,
p375
aVthere's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that.
p376
aVSo I felt entirely powerless.
p377
aVI worked and worked, and I got lucky,
p378
aVand worked, and got lucky, and worked.
p379
aa(lp380
VEventually I graduated from college.
p381
aVIt took me four years longer than my peers,
p382
aVand I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,
p383
aVto take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton,
p384
aVand I was like, I am not supposed to be here.
p385
aVI am an impostor.
p386
aVAnd the night before my first-year talk,
p387
aVand the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.
p388
aVThat's it.
p389
aVI was so afraid of being found out the next day
p390
aVthat I called her and said, "I'm quitting."
p391
aVShe was like, "You are not quitting,
p392
aVbecause I took a gamble on you, and you're staying.
p393
aVYou're going to stay, and this is what you're going to do.
p394
aVYou are going to fake it.
p395
aVYou're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do.
p396
aVYou're just going to do it and do it and do it,
p397
aVeven if you're terrified and just paralyzed
p398
aVand having an out-of-body experience,
p399
aVuntil you have this moment where you say, 'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.
p400
aVLike, I have become this. I am actually doing this.'"
p401
aVSo that's what I did.
p402
aVFive years in grad school,
p403
aVa few years, you know, I'm at Northwestern,
p404
aVI moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,
p405
aVI'm not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking,
p406
aV"Not supposed to be here."
p407
aa(lp408
VSo at the end of my first year at Harvard,
p409
aVa student who had not talked in class the entire semester,
p410
aVwho I had said, "Look, you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail,"
p411
aVcame into my office. I really didn't know her at all.
p412
aVShe came in totally defeated, and she said,
p413
aV"I'm not supposed to be here."
p414
aVAnd that was the moment for me.
p415
aVBecause two things happened.
p416
aVOne was that I realized,
p417
aVoh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore.
p418
aVI don't feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.
p419
aVAnd the second was, she is supposed to be here!
p420
aVLike, she can fake it, she can become it.
p421
aa(lp422
VSo I was like, "Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here!
p423
aVAnd tomorrow you're going to fake it,
p424
aVyou're going to make yourself powerful, and, you know \u2014
p425
aa(lp426
V(Applause)
p427
aa(lp428
VAnd you're going to go into the classroom,
p429
aVand you are going to give the best comment ever."
p430
aVYou know? And she gave the best comment ever,
p431
aVand people turned around and were like,
p432
aVoh my God, I didn't even notice her sitting there. (Laughter)
p433
aa(lp434
VShe comes back to me months later,
p435
aVand I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it,
p436
aVshe had actually faked it till she became it.
p437
aVSo she had changed.
p438
aVAnd so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it.
p439
aVFake it till you become it.
p440
aVDo it enough until you actually become it and internalize.
p441
aa(lp442
VThe last thing I'm going to leave you with is this.
p443
aVTiny tweaks can lead to big changes.
p444
aVSo, this is two minutes.
p445
aVTwo minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
p446
aVBefore you go into the next stressful evaluative situation,
p447
aVfor two minutes, try doing this, in the elevator,
p448
aVin a bathroom stall, at your desk behind closed doors.
p449
aVThat's what you want to do.
p450
aVConfigure your brain to cope the best in that situation.
p451
aVGet your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down.
p452
aVDon't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.
p453
aVLeave that situation feeling like,
p454
aVI really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am.
p455
aa(lp456
VSo I want to ask you first, you know, both to try power posing,
p457
aVand also I want to ask you to share the science, because this is simple.
p458
aVI don't have ego involved in this. (Laughter)
p459
aVGive it away. Share it with people,
p460
aVbecause the people who can use it the most
p461
aVare the ones with no resources and no technology
p462
aVand no status and no power.
p463
aVGive it to them because they can do it in private.
p464
aVThey need their bodies, privacy and two minutes,
p465
aVand it can significantly change the outcomes of their life.
p466
aa(lp467
VThank you.

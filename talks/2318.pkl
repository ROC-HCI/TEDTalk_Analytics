VOver a million people are killed each year in disasters.
p5
aVTwo and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced,
p6
aVand the communities will take 20 to 30 years to recover
p7
aVand billions of economic losses.
p8
aa(lp9
VIf you can reduce the initial response by one day,
p10
aVyou can reduce the overall recovery
p11
aVby a thousand days, or three years.
p12
aVSee how that works?
p13
aVIf the initial responders can get in, save lives,
p14
aVmitigate whatever flooding danger there is,
p15
aVthat means the other groups can get in
p16
aVto restore the water, the roads, the electricity,
p17
aVwhich means then the construction people, the insurance agents,
p18
aVall of them can get in to rebuild the houses,
p19
aVwhich then means you can restore the economy,
p20
aVand maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster.
p21
aVA major insurance company told me
p22
aVthat if they can get a homeowner's claim processed one day earlier,
p23
aVit'll make a difference of six months
p24
aVin that person getting their home repaired.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd that's why I do disaster robotics \u2014
p27
aVbecause robots can make a disaster go away faster.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, you've already seen a couple of these.
p30
aVThese are the UAVs.
p31
aVThese are two types of UAVs:
p32
aVa rotorcraft, or hummingbird;
p33
aVa fixed-wing, a hawk.
p34
aVAnd they're used extensively since 2005 \u2014
p35
aVHurricane Katrina.
p36
aVLet me show you how this hummingbird, this rotorcraft, works.
p37
aVFantastic for structural engineers.
p38
aVBeing able to see damage from angles you can't get from binoculars on the ground
p39
aVor from a satellite image,
p40
aVor anything flying at a higher angle.
p41
aVBut it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this.
p42
aVYou've got things like this fixed-wing, this hawk.
p43
aVNow, this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys.
p44
aVThat's where you're pulling imagery together
p45
aVand getting 3D reconstruction.
p46
aa(lp47
VWe used both of these at the Oso mudslides up in Washington State,
p48
aVbecause the big problem
p49
aVwas geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster \u2014
p50
aVnot the search and rescue.
p51
aVThe search and rescue teams had it under control
p52
aVand knew what they were doing.
p53
aVThe bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out
p54
aVand flood the responders.
p55
aVAnd not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage,
p56
aVit's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing
p57
aValong that part of Washington State.
p58
aVSo they needed to understand what was going on.
p59
aVIn seven hours, going from Arlington,
p60
aVdriving from the Incident Command Post to the site, flying the UAVs,
p61
aVprocessing the data, driving back to Arlington command post \u2014
p62
aVseven hours.
p63
aVWe gave them in seven hours data that they could take
p64
aVonly two to three days to get any other way \u2014
p65
aVand at higher resolution.
p66
aVIt's a game changer.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd don't just think about the UAVs.
p69
aVI mean, they are sexy \u2014 but remember,
p70
aV80 percent of the world's population lives by water,
p71
aVand that means our critical infrastructure is underwater \u2014
p72
aVthe parts that we can't get to, like the bridges and things like that.
p73
aVAnd that's why we have unmanned marine vehicles,
p74
aVone type of which you've already met, which is SARbot, a square dolphin.
p75
aVIt goes underwater and uses sonar.
p76
aVWell, why are marine vehicles so important
p77
aVand why are they very, very important?
p78
aVThey get overlooked.
p79
aVThink about the Japanese tsunami \u2014
p80
aV400 miles of coastland totally devastated,
p81
aVtwice the amount of coastland devastated by Hurricane Katrina in the United States.
p82
aVYou're talking about your bridges, your pipelines, your ports \u2014 wiped out.
p83
aVAnd if you don't have a port,
p84
aVyou don't have a way to get in enough relief supplies
p85
aVto support a population.
p86
aVThat was a huge problem at the Haiti earthquake.
p87
aVSo we need marine vehicles.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, let's look at a viewpoint from the SARbot
p90
aVof what they were seeing.
p91
aVWe were working on a fishing port.
p92
aVWe were able to reopen that fishing port, using her sonar, in four hours.
p93
aVThat fishing port was told it was going to be six months
p94
aVbefore they could get a manual team of divers in,
p95
aVand it was going to take the divers two weeks.
p96
aVThey were going to miss the fall fishing season,
p97
aVwhich was the major economy for that part, which is kind of like their Cape Cod.
p98
aVUMVs, very important.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut you know, all the robots I've shown you have been small,
p101
aVand that's because robots don't do things that people do.
p102
aVThey go places people can't go.
p103
aVAnd a great example of that is Bujold.
p104
aVUnmanned ground vehicles are particularly small,
p105
aVso Bujold \u2014
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VSay hello to Bujold.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VBujold was used extensively at the World Trade Center
p114
aVto go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.
p115
aVYou're climbing into the rubble, rappelling down, going deep in spaces.
p116
aVAnd just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.
p117
aVYou're talking about a disaster where you can't fit a person or a dog \u2014
p118
aVand it's on fire.
p119
aVThe only hope of getting to a survivor way in the basement,
p120
aVyou have to go through things that are on fire.
p121
aVIt was so hot, on one of the robots, the tracks began to melt and come off.
p122
aVRobots don't replace people or dogs,
p123
aVor hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.
p124
aVThey do things new.
p125
aVThey assist the responders, the experts, in new and innovative ways.
p126
aa(lp127
VThe biggest problem is not making the robots smaller, though.
p128
aVIt's not making them more heat-resistant.
p129
aVIt's not making more sensors.
p130
aVThe biggest problem is the data, the informatics,
p131
aVbecause these people need to get the right data at the right time.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo wouldn't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots
p134
aVwithout having to waste any time of driving to the site,
p135
aVso whoever's there, use their robots over the Internet.
p136
aVWell, let's think about that.
p137
aVLet's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county.
p138
aVWhat are the odds that the experts, your chemical engineer,
p139
aVyour railroad transportation engineers,
p140
aVhave been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have?
p141
aVProbably, like, none.
p142
aVSo we're using these kinds of interfaces
p143
aVto allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they're using,
p144
aVor even if they're using a robot or not.
p145
aVWhat the robots give you, what they give the experts, is data.
p146
aa(lp147
VThe problem becomes: who gets what data when?
p148
aVOne thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody
p149
aVand let them sort it out.
p150
aVWell, the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks,
p151
aVand worse yet, it overwhelms the cognitive abilities
p152
aVof each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information
p153
aVthey need to make the decision that's going to make the difference.
p154
aVSo we need to think about those kinds of challenges.
p155
aVSo it's the data.
p156
aa(lp157
VGoing back to the World Trade Center,
p158
aVwe tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold
p159
aVonly when she was deep in the rubble,
p160
aVbecause that's what the USAR team said they wanted.
p161
aVWhat we didn't know at the time
p162
aVwas that the civil engineers would have loved,
p163
aVneeded the data as we recorded the box beams, the serial numbers,
p164
aVthe locations, as we went into the rubble.
p165
aVWe lost valuable data.
p166
aVSo the challenge is getting all the data
p167
aVand getting it to the right people.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, here's another reason.
p170
aVWe've learned that some buildings \u2014
p171
aVthings like schools, hospitals, city halls \u2014
p172
aVget inspected four times by different agencies
p173
aVthroughout the response phases.
p174
aVNow, we're looking, if we can get the data from the robots to share,
p175
aVnot only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases
p176
aVto shorten the response time,
p177
aVbut now we can begin to do the response in parallel.
p178
aVEverybody can see the data.
p179
aVWe can shorten it that way.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo really, "disaster robotics" is a misnomer.
p182
aVIt's not about the robots.
p183
aVIt's about the data.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VSo my challenge to you:
p188
aVthe next time you hear about a disaster,
p189
aVlook for the robots.
p190
aVThey may be underground, they may be underwater,
p191
aVthey may be in the sky,
p192
aVbut they should be there.
p193
aVLook for the robots,
p194
aVbecause robots are coming to the rescue.

VI am a Hazara,
p5
aVand the homeland of my people is Afghanistan.
p6
aVLike hundreds of thousands of other Hazara kids,
p7
aVI was born in exile.
p8
aVThe ongoing persecution and operation against the Hazaras
p9
aVforced my parents to leave Afghanistan.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis persecution has had a long history going back to the late 1800s,
p12
aVand the rule of King Abdur Rahman.
p13
aVHe killed 63 percent of  the Hazara population.
p14
aVHe built minarets with their heads.
p15
aVMany Hazaras were sold into slavery,
p16
aVand many others fled the country for neighboring Iran and Pakistan.
p17
aVMy parents also fled to Pakistan,
p18
aVand settled in Quetta, where I was born.
p19
aa(lp20
VAfter the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers,
p21
aVI got a chance to go to Afghanistan
p22
aVfor the first time, with foreign journalists.
p23
aVI was only 18, and I got a job working as an interpreter.
p24
aVAfter four years,
p25
aVI felt it was safe enough to move to Afghanistan permanently,
p26
aVand I was working there as a documentary photographer,
p27
aVand I worked on many stories.
p28
aa(lp29
VOne of the most important stories that I did
p30
aVwas the dancing boys of Afghanistan.
p31
aVIt is a tragic story about an appalling tradition.
p32
aVIt involves young kids dancing for warlords
p33
aVand powerful men in the society.
p34
aVThese boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents,
p35
aVand they are put to work as sex slaves.
p36
aVThis is Shukur.
p37
aVHe was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord.
p38
aVHe was taken to another province,
p39
aVwhere he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends.
p40
aa(lp41
VWhen this story was published in the Washington Post,
p42
aVI started receiving death threats,
p43
aVand I was forced to leave Afghanistan,
p44
aVas my parents were.
p45
aVAlong with my family, I returned back to Quetta.
p46
aVThe situation in Quetta had changed dramatically since I left in 2005.
p47
aVOnce a peaceful haven for the Hazaras,
p48
aVit had now turned into the most dangerous city in Pakistan.
p49
aVHazaras are confined into two small areas,
p50
aVand they are marginalized socially, educationally, and financially.
p51
aVThis is Nadir.
p52
aVI had known him since my childhood.
p53
aVHe was injured when his van was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta.
p54
aVHe later died of his injuries.
p55
aVAround 1,600 Hazara members
p56
aVhad been killed in various attacks,
p57
aVand around 3,000 of them were injured,
p58
aVand many of them permanently disabled.
p59
aVThe attacks on the Hazara community would only get worse,
p60
aVso it was not surprising that many wanted to flee.
p61
aa(lp62
VAfter Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,
p63
aVAustralia is home to the fourth largest population of Hazaras in the world.
p64
aVWhen it came time to leave Pakistan,
p65
aVAustralia seemed the obvious choice.
p66
aVFinancially, only one of us could leave,
p67
aVand it was decided that I would go,
p68
aVin the hope that if I arrived at my destination safely,
p69
aVI could work to get the rest of my family to join me later.
p70
aa(lp71
VWe all knew about the risks,
p72
aVand how terrifying the journey is,
p73
aVand I met many people who lost loved ones at sea.
p74
aVIt was a desperate decision to take, to leave everything behind,
p75
aVand no one makes this decision easily.
p76
aVIf I had been able to simply fly to Australia,
p77
aVit would have taken me less than 24 hours.
p78
aVBut getting a visa was impossible.
p79
aVMy journey was much longer,
p80
aVmuch more complicated,
p81
aVand certainly more dangerous,
p82
aVtraveling to Thailand by air,
p83
aVand then by road and boat to Malaysia and into Indonesia,
p84
aVpaying people and smugglers all the way
p85
aVand spending a lot of time hiding
p86
aVand a lot of time in fear of being caught.
p87
aa(lp88
VIn Indonesia, I joined a group of seven asylum seekers.
p89
aVWe all shared a bedroom
p90
aVin a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor.
p91
aVAfter spending a week in Bogor,
p92
aVthree of my roommates left for the perilous journey,
p93
aVand we got the news two days later
p94
aVthat a distressed boat sank in the sea en route to Christmas Island.
p95
aVWe found out that our three roommates \u2014 Nawroz, Jaffar and Shabbir \u2014
p96
aVwere also among those.
p97
aVOnly Jaffar was rescued.
p98
aVShabbir and Nawroz were never seen again.
p99
aVIt made me think,
p100
aVam I doing the right thing?
p101
aVI concluded I really had no other choice but to go on.
p102
aa(lp103
VA few weeks later, we got the call from the people smuggler
p104
aVto alert us that the boat is ready for us to commence our sea journey.
p105
aVTaken in the night towards the main vessel
p106
aVon a motorboat,
p107
aVwe boarded an old fishing boat that was already overloaded.
p108
aVThere were 93 of us,
p109
aVand we were all below deck.
p110
aVNo one was allowed up on the top.
p111
aVWe all paid 6,000 dollars each
p112
aVfor this part of the trip.
p113
aVThe first night and day went smoothly,
p114
aVbut by the second night,  the weather turned.
p115
aa(lp116
VWaves tossed the boat around, and the timbers groaned.
p117
aVPeople below deck were crying, praying, recalling their loved ones.
p118
aVThey were screaming.
p119
aVIt was a terrible moment.
p120
aVIt was like a scene from doomsday,
p121
aVor maybe like one of those scenes from those Hollywood movies
p122
aVthat shows that everything is breaking apart
p123
aVand the world is just ending.
p124
aVIt was happening to us for real.
p125
aVWe didn't have any hope.
p126
aVOur boat was floating like a matchbox on the water
p127
aVwithout any control.
p128
aVThe waves were much higher than our boat,
p129
aVand the water poured in faster than the motor pumps could take it out.
p130
aVWe all lost hope.
p131
aVWe thought, this is the end.
p132
aVWe were watching our deaths,
p133
aVand I was documenting it.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe captain told us
p136
aVthat we are not going to make it,
p137
aVwe have to turn back the boat.
p138
aVWe went on the deck
p139
aVand turned our torches on and off
p140
aVto attract the attention of any passing boat.
p141
aVWe kept trying to attract their attention by waving our life jackets and whistling.
p142
aa(lp143
VEventually, we made it to a small island.
p144
aVOur boat crashing onto the rocks,
p145
aVI slipped into the water
p146
aVand destroyed my camera, whatever I had documented.
p147
aVBut luckily, the memory card survived.
p148
aa(lp149
VIt was a thick forest.
p150
aVWe all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next.
p151
aVWe were all scared and confused.
p152
aVThen, after spending the night on the beach,
p153
aVwe found a jetty and coconuts.
p154
aVWe hailed a boat from a nearby resort,
p155
aVand then were quickly handed over to Indonesian water police.
p156
aa(lp157
VAt Serang Detention Center,
p158
aVan immigration officer came and furtively strip-searched us.
p159
aVHe took our mobile, my $300 cash,
p160
aVour shoes that we should not be able to escape,
p161
aVbut we kept watching the guards, checking their movements,
p162
aVand around 4 a.m. when they sat around a fire,
p163
aVwe removed two glass layers from an outside facing window
p164
aVand slipped through.
p165
aVWe climbed a tree next to an outer wall that was topped with the shards of glass.
p166
aVWe put the pillow on that
p167
aVand wrapped our forearms with bedsheets
p168
aVand climbed the wall,
p169
aVand we ran away with bare feet.
p170
aa(lp171
VI was free,
p172
aVwith an uncertain future,
p173
aVno money.
p174
aVThe only thing I had was the memory card with the pictures and footage.
p175
aVWhen my documentary was aired on SBS Dateline,
p176
aVmany of my friends came to know about my situation,
p177
aVand they tried to help me.
p178
aVThey did not allow me to take any other boat to risk my life.
p179
aVI also decided to stay in Indonesia and process my case through UNHCR,
p180
aVbut I was really afraid that I would end up in Indonesia
p181
aVfor many years doing nothing and unable to work,
p182
aVlike every other asylum seeker.
p183
aa(lp184
VBut it had happened to be a little bit different with me.
p185
aVI was lucky.
p186
aVMy contacts worked to expedite my case through UNHCR,
p187
aVand I got resettled in Australia in May 2013.
p188
aa(lp189
VNot every asylum seeker is lucky like me.
p190
aVIt is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate, in limbo.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe issue of asylum seekers in Australia
p193
aVhas been so extremely politicized
p194
aVthat it has lost its human face.
p195
aVThe asylum seekers have been demonized and then presented to the people.
p196
aVI hope my story and the story of other Hazaras
p197
aVcould shed some light to show the people
p198
aVhow these people are suffering in their countries of origin,
p199
aVand how they suffer,
p200
aVwhy they risk their lives to seek asylum.
p201
aa(lp202
VThank you.

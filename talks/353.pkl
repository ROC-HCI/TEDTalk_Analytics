VGood morning.
p5
aVMy name is David Rose.
p6
aVI am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor.
p7
aVAnd by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs,
p8
aVI have personally raised tens of millions of dollars
p9
aVfrom VCs through PowerPoint pitches.
p10
aVAnd turning to the other side of the equation,
p11
aVI've personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars
p12
aVinto companies who have pitched me with PowerPoint presentations.
p13
aVSo I think it's safe to say
p14
aVI know a little bit about the process of pitching.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo, the very first question you've got to figure out is:
p17
aVWhat is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for
p18
aVwhen you come to them pitching your new business idea?
p19
aVThere are obviously all kinds of things \u2014
p20
aVbusiness models and financials and markets and this and that.
p21
aVOverall, of all the things that you have to do,
p22
aVwhat is the single most important thing
p23
aVthe VC is going to be investing in?
p24
aVSomebody? What?
p25
aa(lp26
VAudience: People!
p27
aa(lp28
VDavid Rose: People! You! That's it \u2014 you are the person.
p29
aVTherefore, the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them
p30
aVthat you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money
p31
aVand make a lot of money in return.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, how do you do this?
p34
aVYou can't just walk up and say,
p35
aV"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl, and you should invest in me." Right?
p36
aVSo in the course of your VC pitch \u2014 you have a very few minutes;
p37
aVmost VC pitches, angel pitches, are about 15 minutes,
p38
aVmost should be less than half an hour \u2014
p39
aVpeople's attention span, after 18 minutes, begins to drop off.
p40
aVTests have shown.
p41
aVSo in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,
p42
aVyou have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics,
p43
aVabout 10 different characteristics,
p44
aVwhile you're standing up there.
p45
aVWhat's the single most important thing you've got to convey? What?
p46
aa(lp47
VAudience: Integrity.
p48
aa(lp49
VDR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!
p50
aVThat's a straight line, look at that!
p51
aVAnd I didn't even prompt him.
p52
aVRight, integrity. The key thing.
p53
aVI would much rather invest in, take a chance on,
p54
aVsomebody who I know is straight than where there's any possible question
p55
aVof who are they looking out for, and what's going on.
p56
aVSo the most important thing is integrity.
p57
aVWhat's the second most important thing?
p58
aVLet's see if you can get this one.
p59
aa(lp60
VAudience: Self-confidence.
p61
aa(lp62
VDR: Close enough. Passion.
p63
aVRight? Entrepreneurs, by definition, are people who are leaving something else,
p64
aVstarting a new world, creating and putting their lifeblood into this thing.
p65
aVYou've got to convey passion.
p66
aVIf you're not passionate,
p67
aVwhy should anyone else be, or put money into your company
p68
aVif you're not passionate about it?
p69
aVIntegrity, passion: the most important things.
p70
aa(lp71
VThen there's a whole panoply of other things you've got to wrap up
p72
aVin this package you're presenting to a VC.
p73
aVExperience: you've got to be able to say,
p74
aV"Hey, you know, I've done this before."
p75
aV"Done this before" is starting an enterprise, creating value,
p76
aVand taking something from beginning to end.
p77
aVThat's why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs \u2014
p78
aVeven if you didn't do it right the first time,
p79
aVyou've learned the lessons, which puts you in good stead the next time.
p80
aa(lp81
VAlong with the experience of starting an enterprise or running something \u2014
p82
aVdoesn't have to be a business,
p83
aVit can be an organization in a school, a not-for-profit.
p84
aVBut experience in creating an organization.
p85
aa(lp86
VNext: knowledge.
p87
aVIf you tell me
p88
aVyou're going to be the developer of the map of the human genome,
p89
aVyou better know what a human genome is; I want you to have expertise.
p90
aVI don't want somebody who says,
p91
aV"I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about.
p92
aVI don't know who the players are, what the market is like."
p93
aVYou've got to know your market, your area.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd you have to have the skills that it takes
p96
aVto get a company going.
p97
aVThose skills include everything from technical skills
p98
aVif it's a technology business,
p99
aVto marketing and sales and management and so on.
p100
aVBut, you know, not everybody has all these skills.
p101
aVVery few people have the full set of skills it takes to run a company.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhat else do you require? Well, leadership.
p104
aVYou've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team
p105
aVthat has all those factors in it, or else you can.
p106
aVAnd you have the charisma and the management style
p107
aVand the ability to get people to follow your lead,
p108
aVto inspire them, to motivate them to be part of your team.
p109
aa(lp110
VHaving done all that,
p111
aVwhat else do I want to know as a VC?
p112
aVI want to know that you have commitment.
p113
aVThat you are going to be here to the end.
p114
aVI want you to say \u2014 or I want you to convey \u2014
p115
aVthat you are going to die if you have to, with your very last breath,
p116
aVyour fingernails scratching as they draw you out.
p117
aVYou'll keep my money alive and make more from it.
p118
aVI don't want someone who'll cut and run at the first opportunity.
p119
aVBad things happen.
p120
aVThere's never been a venture-funded company where bad things didn't happen.
p121
aVSo know that you're committed to the very end.
p122
aa(lp123
VYou've got to have vision to see where this is going.
p124
aVI don't want another "me too" product.
p125
aVI want somebody who can change the world out there.
p126
aVBut on top of that, I need realism,
p127
aVBecause while changing the world is great, it doesn't always happen.
p128
aVAnd before you get to change the world,
p129
aVbad things are going to take place;
p130
aVyou have to deal with that.
p131
aVAnd you have to have rational projections.
p132
aa(lp133
VFinally, you're asking for my money \u2014
p134
aVnot just because it's my money, but because it's me.
p135
aVYou need to be coachable.
p136
aVI need to know you have the ability to listen.
p137
aVWe've had a lot of experience.
p138
aVPeople who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience,
p139
aVand they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo how do you convey these 10 things in 10 minutes without saying them?
p142
aVYou can't say, "I've got integrity, invest in me!"
p143
aVYou've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it.
p144
aVThink about your pitch as a timeline.
p145
aVIt starts off, you walk in the door.
p146
aVThey know nothing whatsoever about you.
p147
aVYou can take them on an emotional \u2014 all pitches, all sales presentations,
p148
aVare emotional at some level.
p149
aVYou can go up, you can go down, right?
p150
aVAnd it goes from beginning to end.
p151
aa(lp152
VYou walk in, the first thing you've got to do,
p153
aVthe overall arc of your presentation, it's got to start like a rocket.
p154
aVYou've got maybe 10 seconds \u2014
p155
aVbetween 10 and 30 seconds, depending on how long the pitch is \u2014
p156
aVto get their attention.
p157
aVIn my case, I've invested.
p158
aVI've gotten millions of dollars from PowerPoint pitches.
p159
aV"I've invested millions." That should get you right there.
p160
aVThis can be a fact or something counterintuitive.
p161
aVIt can be a story or an experience.
p162
aVBut you've got to grab their emotional attention, focused on you,
p163
aVwithin that first few seconds.
p164
aVAnd then from there, you've got to take them
p165
aVon a very solid, steady, upward path, right from beginning to end.
p166
aVEverything has to reinforce this.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd you've got to get better and better and better,
p169
aVrevving up to the very end,
p170
aVthen you've got to \u2014 boom! \u2014
p171
aVknock them out of the park.
p172
aVYou want to get them to such an emotional high
p173
aVthey're ready to write you a check, throw money at you,
p174
aVbefore you leave.
p175
aa(lp176
VHow do you do that?
p177
aVFirst of all, logical progression.
p178
aVAny time you go backwards, any time you skip a step \u2014
p179
aVimagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing,
p180
aVor the heights are different.
p181
aVYou stop, you need to figure out a nice, logical progression.
p182
aVStart with what the market is: Why are you going to do X, Y or Z?
p183
aVAnd then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it,
p184
aVand what you're going to do.
p185
aVAnd it's got to flow from beginning to end.
p186
aa(lp187
VYou've got to let me know there are touchstones,
p188
aVto tie in to the rest of the world out there.
p189
aVFor example, reference companies I've heard of,
p190
aVor basic items in your business.
p191
aVI want to know about things that I can relate to:
p192
aVvalidators, or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this,
p193
aVor there's outside validation.
p194
aVIt can be sales; it can be you got an award for something;
p195
aVit can be people have done it before;
p196
aVit can be your beta tests are going great, whatever.
p197
aVI want to know validation \u2014 not just what you're telling me,
p198
aVbut that somebody or something else out there
p199
aVsays this makes sense.
p200
aVAnd then, I'm looking for the upside; I need a believable upside.
p201
aVThat's two parts; it's got to be upside and believable.
p202
aVThe upside means if you tell me that five years out,
p203
aVyou're making a million dollars a year, that's not really upside.
p204
aVTelling me you'll be making a billion dollars a year \u2014
p205
aVthat's not believable.
p206
aVSo it's got to be both.
p207
aa(lp208
VOn the other hand are things that take the emotional level down.
p209
aVYou have to recover from those.
p210
aVFor example, anything that I know is not true.
p211
aV"We have no competition. Nobody makes a widget like this."
p212
aVOdds are I know somebody who's made a widget,
p213
aVand the minute you tell me that,
p214
aVI discount half of what you're saying from then on.
p215
aVAnything I don't understand,
p216
aVwhere I have to make the leap myself, in my own head,
p217
aVwill stop the flow of the presentation.
p218
aVSo you've got to take me through like a sixth-grader \u2014
p219
aVdub, dub, dub \u2014 but without patronizing me.
p220
aVAnd it's a very tricky path.
p221
aVBut if you can do it, it works really well.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnything that's inconsistent within your concept \u2014
p224
aVif you tell me sales of X, Y or Z are 10 million dollars,
p225
aVfive slides later, they're five million dollars ...
p226
aVOne may have been gross sales, one may have been net sales,
p227
aVbut I want to know that all the numbers make sense together.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd then, finally: anything that's an error or a typo,
p230
aVor a stupid mistake or a line that's in the wrong place \u2014
p231
aVthat shows me that if you can't do a presentation, how can you run a company?
p232
aVSo this all feeds in together.
p233
aa(lp234
VThe best way to do this is to look at our betters,
p235
aVpeople who have done this before.
p236
aVLet's look at the most successful technology executive in the business,
p237
aVand see how a presentation goes.
p238
aVBill Gates's PowerPoint presentation over here.
p239
aVHere's Gates doing a thing for Windows.
p240
aVIs this how to do a PowerPoint presentation? What do you think?
p241
aVNo. Who do you think we should look at as our role model?
p242
aa(lp243
VOh, isn't that funny! There's another great one over here.
p244
aVOK, Steve Jobs.
p245
aVYou want absolute \u2014 this is the Zen of presentation, right?
p246
aVHere he is, one little guy, black jeans and stuff,
p247
aVon a totally empty stage.
p248
aVWhat are you focusing on?
p249
aVYou're focusing on him! This is Steve Jobs.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo are these wonderful long bullet points, whole list of things good?
p252
aVNo, they're not. The long bullet points are bad.
p253
aVWhat's good? Short. Short bullet points.
p254
aVBut you know what? Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points.
p255
aVJust give me the headline.
p256
aVAnd you know what?
p257
aVHow many bullet points does Steve Jobs use?
p258
aVBasically, none.
p259
aVWhat do you do?
p260
aVBest of all, images. Just a simple image.
p261
aVI look at the image; a picture's worth a thousand words.
p262
aVYou look at the image and you've got the whole thing.
p263
aVThen you come back to me; you're focused on me, why I'm such a great guy,
p264
aVwhy you want to invest, why this all makes sense.
p265
aa(lp266
VThat said, we only have a very short time,
p267
aVso let's run through the things to include in your presentation.
p268
aVFirst of all, none of these big, long-titled slides
p269
aVwith blah, blah, I'm presenting to so-and-so on X date.
p270
aVI know the day, I know who I am \u2014 I don't need all that.
p271
aVJust give me your company logo.
p272
aVI look at the logo, and it ties it to my brain.
p273
aVThen I come back to you. I'm focused on you, OK?
p274
aVYou give me your quick, 15-second or 30-second intro, grab my attention.
p275
aVThen you give me a quick business overview.
p276
aVThis is not a five-minute pitch. This is, you know, two sentences.
p277
aV"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market."
p278
aVOr, "We sell services to help do X." You know, whatever.
p279
aVAnd that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.
p280
aVThat lets me know the context.
p281
aVIt gives me the armature for the whole thing you'll be going through;
p282
aVit lets me put everything in relation to what you've told me.
p283
aa(lp284
VThen you've got to walk me through, show me who your management team is.
p285
aVI want to know the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at?
p286
aVI want to know your product, that's very important.
p287
aVNow, this is not a product pitch or sales pitch.
p288
aVI don't want to know all the ins and outs, just what the heck is it?
p289
aVIf it's a website, show me a screenshot of your website.
p290
aVDon't do a live demo. Never do a live demo.
p291
aVDo a canned demo, or something that lets me know
p292
aVwhy people are going to buy whatever it is.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow that I know what you're selling,
p295
aVtell me how you make money on it.
p296
aVFor every X you sell, you get Y, or services of Z.
p297
aVI want to know what the business model is on a per-unit basis,
p298
aVor for the actual product you're selling.
p299
aVI want to know who you're selling to in terms of customers
p300
aVand if you have any special relationships that will help you,
p301
aVwhether it's a distribution relationship or a producing partner.
p302
aVAgain, validation.
p303
aVThis helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here.
p304
aa(lp305
VBut everybody has competition.
p306
aVThere's never been a company with no competition,
p307
aVeven if the competition is the old way of doing something.
p308
aVI want to know exactly what your competition is,
p309
aVand that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation.
p310
aVI want to know how you're special.
p311
aa(lp312
VI know what your competition does \u2014
p313
aVhow are you going to prevent them from eating your lunch?
p314
aVAll this ties into the financial overview.
p315
aVAnd you can't do a VC pitch without giving me your financials.
p316
aVI want to know a year or two back, or as long as you've been in existence.
p317
aVAnd I want to know four or five years forward.
p318
aVFive is a bit much. Probably four.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd I want to know how that business model, on a product basis,
p321
aVwill translate into a company model: How many widgets will you sell?
p322
aVYou make X amount per widget. I want to know what the driver is.
p323
aVWe'll have 1,000 customers this year and 10,000 the next,
p324
aVour revenues will do this and that.
p325
aVThat gives me the whole picture for the next several years
p326
aVinto which I'm investing.
p327
aVAnd I want to know how the money from me will help you get there.
p328
aVYou're going to open an offshore plant in China,
p329
aVyou're going to spend it all on sales and marketing,
p330
aVyou're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.
p331
aa(lp332
VBut then comes the ask, where you tell me how much you want.
p333
aVYou're looking for 5 million \u2014 at what valuation?
p334
aVTwo million? 100,000?
p335
aVWhat's the money in so far? Who invested?
p336
aVI hope you invested \u2014 if you can't invest in your own thing, why should I?
p337
aVSo I like to know if you have friends and family,
p338
aVor angel investors, or more VCs before.
p339
aVWhat's the capital structure up until this point?
p340
aVFinally, having done all that, you've now told me the whole thing,
p341
aVso now you bring it back to that conclusion.
p342
aVThis is that rocket going up.
p343
aVHopefully everything has been positive.
p344
aVAnd everything you say clicks, it all makes sense.
p345
aVAnd I'm thinking, "This is really great!"
p346
aa(lp347
VThen you take me back to just your logo on the screen.
p348
aVAnd I look at the logo \u2014 OK, good.
p349
aVNow I come back to you. Nothing else to look at, right?
p350
aVNow you've got to wrap it up to give me the final \u2014 boom! \u2014
p351
aVthe final pitch that's going to send me into space.
p352
aVNow, in the process of doing this,
p353
aVhow do you remember the sequences and do it?
p354
aVYou've noticed I'm not looking at the screen, right?
p355
aVThe screen is in front of me,
p356
aVso I couldn't even see if I wanted to.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo how do I know what's going on?
p359
aVWell, I have a laptop in front of me.
p360
aVYou're looking at me and at this.
p361
aVWhat am I looking at?
p362
aVYou think that I'm looking at that?
p363
aVNo, I'm looking, actually,
p364
aVat a special version of PowerPoint over here,
p365
aVwhich shows me the slides ahead and behind, my notes,
p366
aVso I can see what's going on.
p367
aVPowerPoint has this built into every copy of it that's shipped.
p368
aVIf you use Apple's Keynote, it's got an even better version.
p369
aVThere's another program called Ovation you can get from Adobe
p370
aVthat they bought last summer,
p371
aVwhich helps you run the timers and lets you figure out what's going on.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo, here's my wrap-up to take you to the moon, right?
p374
aVI usually do a Top 10, but we don't have time,
p375
aVso: David's Top Five Presentation Tips.
p376
aVNumber five: always use presenter mode,
p377
aVor Ovation, or presenter tools.
p378
aVIt lets you know exactly where you're going,
p379
aVhelps you pace yourself, gives you a timer, the whole bit.
p380
aa(lp381
VNumber four: always use remote control.
p382
aVHave you seen me touch the computer? No. Why not?
p383
aVBecause I'm using remote control. Always use remote control.
p384
aa(lp385
VNumber three: the handouts you give are not your presentation.
p386
aVIf you follow my suggestions,
p387
aVyou'll have a very spare, Zen-like presentation,
p388
aVwhich is great to convey who you are and get people emotionally involved,
p389
aVbut not good as a handout.
p390
aVYou want a handout that gives more information; it has to stand without you.
p391
aa(lp392
VNumber two: don't read your speech. Can you imagine?
p393
aa(lp394
V(Reading) "You should invest in my company ... "
p395
aa(lp396
VIt doesn't work.
p397
aVAnd the number one presentation tip: never, ever look at the screen.
p398
aVYou're making a connection with your audience,
p399
aVand you always want a one-on-one connection.
p400
aVThe screen should come up behind you
p401
aVand supplement what you're doing, instead of replace you.
p402
aVAnd that is how to pitch to a VC.

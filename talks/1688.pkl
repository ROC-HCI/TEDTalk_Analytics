VI want to talk about social innovation
p5
aVand social entrepreneurship.
p6
aVI happen to have triplets.
p7
aVThey're little. They're five years old.
p8
aVSometimes I tell people I have triplets. They say, "Really? How many?"
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VHere's a picture of the kids \u2014 that's Sage, and Annalisa and Rider.
p13
aVNow, I also happen to be gay.
p14
aVBeing gay and fathering triplets is by far
p15
aVthe most socially innovative, socially entrepreneurial thing
p16
aVI have ever done.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
V(Applause)
p21
aa(lp22
VThe real social innovation I want to talk about involves charity.
p23
aVI want to talk about how the things we've been taught to think
p24
aVabout giving and about charity
p25
aVand about the nonprofit sector,
p26
aVare actually undermining the causes we love,
p27
aVand our profound yearning to change the world.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut before I do that, I want to ask if we even believe
p30
aVthat the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play
p31
aVin changing the world.
p32
aVA lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies,
p33
aVand social business will take care of the rest.
p34
aVAnd I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward.
p35
aVBut it always leaves behind that 10 percent or more
p36
aVthat is most disadvantaged or unlucky.
p37
aVAnd social business needs markets,
p38
aVand there are some issues for which you just can't develop
p39
aVthe kind of money measures that you need for a market.
p40
aa(lp41
VI sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled,
p42
aVand these people want laughter
p43
aVand compassion and they want love.
p44
aVHow do you monetize that?
p45
aVAnd that's where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in.
p46
aVPhilanthropy is the market for love.
p47
aVIt is the market for all those people
p48
aVfor whom there is no other market coming.
p49
aVAnd so if we really want, like Buckminster Fuller said,
p50
aVa world that works for everyone,
p51
aVwith no one and nothing left out,
p52
aVthen the nonprofit sector has to be
p53
aVa serious part of the conversation.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut it doesn't seem to be working.
p56
aVWhy have our breast cancer charities not come close
p57
aVto finding a cure for breast cancer,
p58
aVor our homeless charities not come close
p59
aVto ending homelessness in any major city?
p60
aVWhy has poverty remained stuck
p61
aVat 12 percent of the U.S. population for 40 years?
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd the answer is,
p64
aVthese social problems are massive in scale,
p65
aVour organizations are tiny up against them,
p66
aVand we have a belief system that keeps them tiny.
p67
aVWe have two rulebooks.
p68
aVWe have one for the nonprofit sector,
p69
aVand one for the rest of the economic world.
p70
aVIt's an apartheid, and it discriminates
p71
aVagainst the nonprofit sector in five different areas,
p72
aVthe first being compensation.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo in the for-profit sector, the more value you produce,
p75
aVthe more money you can make.
p76
aVBut we don't like nonprofits to use money
p77
aVto incentivize people to produce more in social service.
p78
aVWe have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone
p79
aVwould make very much money helping other people.
p80
aVInterestingly, we don't have a visceral reaction
p81
aVto the notion that people would make a lot of money
p82
aVnot helping other people.
p83
aVYou know, you want to make 50 million dollars
p84
aVselling violent video games to kids, go for it.
p85
aVWe'll put you on the cover of Wired magazine.
p86
aVBut you want to make half a million dollars
p87
aVtrying to cure kids of malaria,
p88
aVand you're considered a parasite yourself.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Applause)
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd we think of this as our system of ethics,
p93
aVbut what we don't realize is that this system
p94
aVhas a powerful side effect, which is:
p95
aVIt gives a really stark, mutually exclusive choice
p96
aVbetween doing very well for yourself and your family
p97
aVor doing good for the world,
p98
aVto the brightest minds coming out of our best universities,
p99
aVand sends tens of thousands of people
p100
aVwho could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector,
p101
aVmarching every year directly into the for-profit sector
p102
aVbecause they're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice.
p103
aVBusinessweek did a survey, looked at the compensation packages
p104
aVfor MBAs 10 years out of business school.
p105
aVAnd the median compensation for a Stanford MBA,
p106
aVwith bonus, at the age of 38, was 400,000 dollars.
p107
aVMeanwhile, for the same year, the average salary
p108
aVfor the CEO of a $5 million-plus medical charity in the U.S.
p109
aVwas 232,000 dollars, and for a hunger charity, 84,000 dollars.
p110
aVNow, there's no way you're going to get a lot of people
p111
aVwith $400,000 talent to make a $316,000 sacrifice every year
p112
aVto become the CEO of a hunger charity.
p113
aa(lp114
VSome people say, "Well, that's just because those MBA types are greedy."
p115
aVNot necessarily. They might be smart.
p116
aVIt's cheaper for that person to donate
p117
aV100,000 dollars every year to the hunger charity;
p118
aVsave 50,000 dollars on their taxes \u2014
p119
aVso still be roughly 270,000 dollars a year ahead of the game \u2014
p120
aVnow be called a philanthropist because they donated
p121
aV100,000 dollars to charity;
p122
aVprobably sit on the board of the hunger charity;
p123
aVindeed, probably supervise the poor SOB
p124
aVwho decided to become the CEO of the hunger charity;
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
Vand have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence
p129
aVand popular praise still ahead of them.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing.
p132
aVSo we tell the for-profit sector, "Spend, spend, spend on advertising,
p133
aVuntil the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value."
p134
aVBut we don't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity.
p135
aVOur attitude is, "Well, look, if you can get the advertising donated,
p136
aVyou know, to air at four o'clock in the morning, I'm okay with that.
p137
aVBut I don't want my donation spent on advertising,
p138
aVI want it go to the needy."
p139
aVAs if the money invested in advertising
p140
aVcould not bring in dramatically greater sums of money
p141
aVto serve the needy.
p142
aa(lp143
VIn the 1990s, my company created
p144
aVthe long-distance AIDSRide bicycle journeys,
p145
aVand the 60 mile-long breast cancer three-day walks,
p146
aVand over the course of nine years,
p147
aVwe had 182,000 ordinary heroes participate,
p148
aVand they raised a total of 581 million dollars.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Applause)
p151
aa(lp152
VThey raised more money more quickly for these causes
p153
aVthan any events in history,
p154
aVall based on the idea that people are weary
p155
aVof being asked to do the least they can possibly do.
p156
aVPeople are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential
p157
aVon behalf of the causes that they care about deeply.
p158
aVBut they have to be asked.
p159
aVWe got that many people to participate
p160
aVby buying full-page ads in The New York Times,
p161
aVin The Boston Globe, in prime time radio and TV advertising.
p162
aVDo you know how many people we would've gotten
p163
aVif we put up fliers in the laundromat?
p164
aa(lp165
VCharitable giving has remained stuck in the U.S., at two percent of GDP,
p166
aVever since we started measuring it in the 1970s.
p167
aVThat's an important fact, because it tells us
p168
aVthat in 40 years, the nonprofit sector
p169
aVhas not been able to wrestle any market share
p170
aVaway from the for-profit sector.
p171
aVAnd if you think about it, how could one sector
p172
aVpossibly take market share away from another sector
p173
aVif it isn't really allowed to market?
p174
aVAnd if we tell the consumer brands,
p175
aV"You may advertise all the benefits of your product,"
p176
aVbut we tell charities, "You cannot advertise all the good that you do,"
p177
aVwhere do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow?
p178
aa(lp179
VThe third area of discrimination is the taking of risk
p180
aVin pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue.
p181
aVSo Disney can make a new $200 million movie that flops,
p182
aVand nobody calls the attorney general.
p183
aVBut you do a little $1 million community fundraiser for the poor,
p184
aVand it doesn't produce a 75 percent profit to the cause in the first 12 months,
p185
aVand your character is called into question.
p186
aVSo nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave,
p187
aVdaring, giant-scale new fundraising endeavors,
p188
aVfor fear that if the thing fails,
p189
aVtheir reputations will be dragged through the mud.
p190
aVWell, you and I know
p191
aVwhen you prohibit failure, you kill innovation.
p192
aVIf you kill innovation in fundraising, you can't raise more revenue;
p193
aVif you can't raise more revenue, you can't grow;
p194
aVand if you can't grow, you can't possibly solve large social problems.
p195
aa(lp196
VThe fourth area is time.
p197
aVSo Amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors,
p198
aVand people had patience.
p199
aVThey knew that there was a long-term objective down the line,
p200
aVof building market dominance.
p201
aVBut if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream
p202
aVof building magnificent scale that required that for six years,
p203
aVno money was going to go to the needy,
p204
aVit was all going to be invested in building this scale,
p205
aVwe would expect a crucifixion.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe last area is profit itself.
p208
aVSo the for-profit sector can pay people profits
p209
aVin order to attract their capital for their new ideas,
p210
aVbut you can't pay profits in a nonprofit sector,
p211
aVso the for-profit sector has a lock
p212
aVon the multi-trillion-dollar capital markets,
p213
aVand the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital.
p214
aa(lp215
VWell, you put those five things together \u2014
p216
aVyou can't use money to lure talent away from the for-profit sector;
p217
aVyou can't advertise on anywhere near the scale
p218
aVthe for-profit sector does for new customers;
p219
aVyou can't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers
p220
aVthat the for-profit sector takes;
p221
aVyou don't have the same amount of time to find them as the for-profit sector;
p222
aVand you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this,
p223
aVeven if you could do it in the first place \u2014
p224
aVand you've just put the nonprofit sector
p225
aVat an extreme disadvantage to the for-profit sector,
p226
aVon every level.
p227
aVIf we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book,
p228
aVthis statistic is sobering:
p229
aVFrom 1970 to 2009,
p230
aVthe number of nonprofits that really grew,
p231
aVthat crossed the $50 million annual revenue barrier,
p232
aVis 144.
p233
aVIn the same time, the number of for-profits that crossed it
p234
aVis 46,136.
p235
aVSo we're dealing with social problems that are massive in scale,
p236
aVand our organizations can't generate any scale.
p237
aVAll of the scale goes to Coca-Cola and Burger King.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo why do we think this way?
p240
aVWell, like most fanatical dogma in America,
p241
aVthese ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.
p242
aVThe Puritans came here for religious reasons, or so they said,
p243
aVbut they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money.
p244
aVThey were pious people,
p245
aVbut they were also really aggressive capitalists,
p246
aVand they were accused of extreme forms of profit-making tendencies,
p247
aVcompared to the other colonists.
p248
aVBut at the same time, the Puritans were Calvinists,
p249
aVso they were taught literally to hate themselves.
p250
aVThey were taught that self-interest was a raging sea
p251
aVthat was a sure path to eternal damnation.
p252
aVThis created a real problem for these people.
p253
aVHere they've come all the way across the Atlantic to make all this money,
p254
aVbut making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell.
p255
aVWhat were they to do about this?
p256
aa(lp257
VWell, charity became their answer.
p258
aVIt became this economic sanctuary,
p259
aVwhere they could do penance for their profit-making tendencies \u2014
p260
aVat five cents on the dollar.
p261
aVSo of course, how could you make money in charity
p262
aVif charity was your penance for making money?
p263
aVFinancial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others,
p264
aVso that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself,
p265
aVand in 400 years, nothing has intervened
p266
aVto say, "That's counterproductive and that's unfair."
p267
aa(lp268
VNow, this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question,
p269
aVwhich is, "What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead?"
p270
aVThere are a lot of problems with this question.
p271
aVI'm going to just focus on two.
p272
aVFirst, it makes us think that overhead is a negative,
p273
aVthat it is somehow not part of the cause.
p274
aVBut it absolutely is, especially if it's being used for growth.
p275
aVNow, this idea that overhead is somehow an enemy of the cause
p276
aVcreates this second, much larger problem,
p277
aVwhich is, it forces organizations to go without the overhead things
p278
aVthey really need to grow,
p279
aVin the interest of keeping overhead low.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo we've all been taught that charities should spend
p282
aVas little as possible on overhead things like fundraising
p283
aVunder the theory that, well, the less money you spend on fundraising,
p284
aVthe more money there is available for the cause.
p285
aVWell, that's true if it's a depressing world
p286
aVin which this pie cannot be made any bigger.
p287
aVBut if it's a logical world in which investment in fundraising
p288
aVactually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger,
p289
aVthen we have it precisely backwards,
p290
aVand we should be investing more money, not less, in fundraising,
p291
aVbecause fundraising is the one thing
p292
aVthat has the potential to multiply the amount of money
p293
aVavailable for the cause that we care about so deeply.
p294
aa(lp295
VI'll give you two examples.
p296
aVWe launched the AIDSRides
p297
aVwith an initial investment of 50,000 dollars in risk capital.
p298
aVWithin nine years, we had multiplied that 1,982 times,
p299
aVinto 108 million dollars after all expenses, for AIDS services.
p300
aVWe launched the breast cancer three-days
p301
aVwith an initial investment of 350,000 dollars in risk capital.
p302
aVWithin just five years, we had multiplied that 554 times,
p303
aVinto 194 million dollars after all expenses,
p304
aVfor breast cancer research.
p305
aVNow, if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer,
p306
aVwhat would make more sense:
p307
aVgo out and find the most innovative researcher in the world
p308
aVand give her 350,000 dollars for research,
p309
aVor give her fundraising department the 350,000 dollars
p310
aVto multiply it into 194 million dollars for breast cancer research?
p311
aV2002 was our most successful year ever.
p312
aVWe netted for breast cancer alone, that year alone,
p313
aV71 million dollars after all expenses.
p314
aVAnd then we went out of business,
p315
aVsuddenly and traumatically.
p316
aa(lp317
VWhy? Well, the short story is, our sponsors split on us.
p318
aVThey wanted to distance themselves from us
p319
aVbecause we were being crucified in the media
p320
aVfor investing 40 percent of the gross in recruitment
p321
aVand customer service and the magic of the experience,
p322
aVand there is no accounting terminology to describe
p323
aVthat kind of investment in growth and in the future,
p324
aVother than this demonic label of "overhead."
p325
aVSo on one day, all 350 of our great employees
p326
aVlost their jobs ...
p327
aVbecause they were labeled "overhead."
p328
aVOur sponsor went and tried the events on their own.
p329
aVThe overhead went up.
p330
aVNet income for breast cancer research went down by 84 percent,
p331
aVor 60 million dollars, in one year.
p332
aa(lp333
VThis is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality.
p334
aVWe've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead
p335
aVis morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise
p336
aVwith 40 percent overhead,
p337
aVbut we're missing the most important piece of information, which is:
p338
aVWhat is the actual size of these pies?
p339
aVWho cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it's tiny?
p340
aVWhat if the bake sale only netted 71 dollars for charity
p341
aVbecause it made no investment in its scale
p342
aVand the professional fundraising enterprise netted
p343
aV71 million dollars because it did?
p344
aVNow which pie would we prefer,
p345
aVand which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer?
p346
aa(lp347
VHere's how all of this impacts the big picture.
p348
aVI said that charitable giving is two percent of GDP in the United States.
p349
aVThat's about 300 billion dollars a year.
p350
aVBut only about 20 percent of that, or 60 billion dollars,
p351
aVgoes to health and human services causes.
p352
aVThe rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals,
p353
aVand that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough
p354
aVto tackle these problems.
p355
aVBut if we could move charitable giving from two percent of GDP,
p356
aVup just one step to three percent of GDP, by investing in that growth,
p357
aVthat would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contributions,
p358
aVand if that money could go disproportionately
p359
aVto health and human services charities,
p360
aVbecause those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth,
p361
aVthat would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector.
p362
aVNow we're talking scale.
p363
aVNow we're talking the potential for real change.
p364
aVBut it's never going to happen by forcing these organizations
p365
aVto lower their horizons
p366
aVto the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low.
p367
aa(lp368
VOur generation does not want its epitaph to read,
p369
aV"We kept charity overhead low."
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
V(Applause)
p374
aa(lp375
VWe want it to read that we changed the world,
p376
aVand that part of the way we did that
p377
aVwas by changing the way we think about these things.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo the next time you're looking at a charity,
p380
aVdon't ask about the rate of their overhead.
p381
aVAsk about the scale of their dreams,
p382
aVtheir Apple-, Google-, Amazon-scale dreams,
p383
aVhow they measure their progress toward those dreams,
p384
aVand what resources they need to make them come true,
p385
aVregardless of what the overhead is.
p386
aVWho cares what the overhead is
p387
aVif these problems are actually getting solved?
p388
aa(lp389
VIf we can have that kind of generosity \u2014
p390
aVa generosity of thought \u2014
p391
aVthen the non-profit sector can play a massive role
p392
aVin changing the world for all those citizens
p393
aVmost desperately in need of it to change.
p394
aVAnd if that can be our generation's enduring legacy \u2014
p395
aVthat we took responsibility
p396
aVfor the thinking that had been handed down to us,
p397
aVthat we revisited it, we revised it,
p398
aVand we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things,
p399
aVforever, for everyone \u2014
p400
aVwell, I thought I would let the kids sum up what that would be.

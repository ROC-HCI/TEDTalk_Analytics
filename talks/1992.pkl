VWhen I was a young officer, they told me
p5
aVto follow my instincts,
p6
aVto go with my gut,
p7
aVand what I've learned
p8
aVis that often our instincts are wrong.
p9
aa(lp10
VIn the summer of 2010,
p11
aVthere was a massive leak of classified documents
p12
aVthat came out of the Pentagon.
p13
aVIt shocked the world,
p14
aVit shook up the American government,
p15
aVand it made people ask a lot of questions,
p16
aVbecause the sheer amount of information
p17
aVthat was let out, and the potential impacts,
p18
aVwere significant.
p19
aVAnd one of the first questions we asked ourselves
p20
aVwas why would a young soldier have access
p21
aVto that much information?
p22
aVWhy would we let sensitive things
p23
aVbe with a relatively young person?
p24
aa(lp25
VIn the summer of 2003, I was assigned to command
p26
aVa special operations task force,
p27
aVand that task force was spread across the Mideast
p28
aVto fight al Qaeda.
p29
aVOur main effort was inside Iraq,
p30
aVand our specified mission
p31
aVwas to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq.
p32
aVFor almost five years I stayed there,
p33
aVand we focused on fighting a war
p34
aVthat was unconventional and it was difficult
p35
aVand it was bloody
p36
aVand it often claimed its highest price
p37
aVamong innocent people.
p38
aVWe did everything we could
p39
aVto stop al Qaeda
p40
aVand the foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers
p41
aVand as accelerants to the violence.
p42
aVWe honed our combat skills,
p43
aVwe developed new equipment,
p44
aVwe parachuted, we helicoptered,
p45
aVwe took small boats, we drove, and we walked
p46
aVto objectives night after night to stop
p47
aVthe killing that this network was putting forward.
p48
aVWe bled,
p49
aVwe died,
p50
aVand we killed to stop that organization
p51
aVfrom the violence that they were putting
p52
aVlargely against the Iraqi people.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, we did what we knew,
p55
aVhow we had grown up, and one of the things that we knew,
p56
aVthat was in our DNA, was secrecy.
p57
aVIt was security. It was protecting information.
p58
aVIt was the idea that information was the lifeblood
p59
aVand it was what would protect and keep people safe.
p60
aVAnd we had a sense that,
p61
aVas we operated within our organizations,
p62
aVit was important to keep information
p63
aVin the silos within the organizations,
p64
aVparticularly only give information
p65
aVto people had a demonstrated need to know.
p66
aVBut the question often came, who needed to know?
p67
aVWho needed, who had to have the information
p68
aVso that they could do the important  parts of the job that you needed?
p69
aVAnd in a tightly coupled world,
p70
aVthat's very hard to predict.
p71
aVIt's very hard to know who needs to have information
p72
aVand who doesn't.
p73
aVI used to deal with intelligence agencies,
p74
aVand I'd complain that they weren't sharing enough intelligence,
p75
aVand with a straight face, they'd look at me and they'd say,
p76
aV"What aren't you getting?" (Laughter)
p77
aVI said, "If I knew that, we wouldn't have a problem."
p78
aa(lp79
VBut what we found is we had to change.
p80
aVWe had to change our culture about information.
p81
aVWe had to knock down walls. We had to share.
p82
aVWe had to change from who needs to know
p83
aVto the fact that who doesn't know,
p84
aVand we need to tell, and tell them as quickly as we can.
p85
aVIt was a significant culture shift for an organization
p86
aVthat had secrecy in its DNA.
p87
aa(lp88
VWe started by doing things, by building,
p89
aVnot working in offices,
p90
aVknocking down walls, working in things we called
p91
aVsituation awareness rooms,
p92
aVand in the summer of 2007,
p93
aVsomething happened which demonstrated this.
p94
aVWe captured the personnel records
p95
aVfor the people who were bringing foreign fighters
p96
aVinto Iraq.
p97
aVAnd when we got the personnel records, typically,
p98
aVwe would have hidden these,
p99
aVshared them with a few intelligence agencies,
p100
aVand then try to operate with them.
p101
aVBut as I was talking to my intelligence officer,
p102
aVI said, "What do we do?"
p103
aVAnd he said, "Well, you found them." Our command.
p104
aV"You can just declassify them."
p105
aVAnd I said, "Well, can we declassify them?
p106
aVWhat if the enemy finds out?"
p107
aVAnd he says, "They're their personnel records."
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VSo we did,
p111
aVand a lot of people got upset about that,
p112
aVbut as we passed that information around,
p113
aVsuddenly you find that information is only of value
p114
aVif you give it to people who have the ability
p115
aVto do something with it.
p116
aVThe fact that I know something has zero value
p117
aVif I'm not the person who can actually
p118
aVmake something better because of it.
p119
aVSo as a consequence, what we did was
p120
aVwe changed the idea of information,
p121
aVinstead of knowledge is power,
p122
aVto one where sharing is power.
p123
aVIt was the fundamental shift,
p124
aVnot new tactics, not new weapons,
p125
aVnot new anything else.
p126
aVIt was the idea that we were now part of a team
p127
aVin which information became the essential link
p128
aVbetween us, not a block between us.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd I want everybody to take a deep breath
p131
aVand let it out,
p132
aVbecause in your life, there's going to be information
p133
aVthat leaks out you're not going to like.
p134
aVSomebody's going to get my college grades out,
p135
aVa that's going to be a disaster. (Laughter)
p136
aVBut it's going to be okay, and I will tell you that
p137
aVI am more scared of the bureaucrat
p138
aVthat holds information in a desk drawer
p139
aVor in a safe than I am of someone who leaks,
p140
aVbecause ultimately, we'll be better off if we share.
p141
aa(lp142
VThank you.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Applause)
p145
aa(lp146
VHelen Walters: So I don't know if you were here this morning,
p147
aVif you were able to catch Rick Ledgett,
p148
aVthe deputy director of the NSA
p149
aVwho was responding to Edward Snowden's talk earlier this week.
p150
aVI just wonder, do you think the American government
p151
aVshould give Edward Snowden amnesty?
p152
aa(lp153
VStanley McChrystal: I think that Rick said something very important.
p154
aVWe, most people, don't know all the facts.
p155
aVI think there are two parts of this.
p156
aVEdward Snowden shined a light on an important need
p157
aVthat people had to understand.
p158
aVHe also took a lot of documents that he didn't have
p159
aVthe knowledge to know the importance of,
p160
aVso I think we need to learn the facts about this case
p161
aVbefore we make snap judgments
p162
aVabout Edward Snowden.
p163
aVHW: Thank you so much. Thank you.

A four-star general, he is the former commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan and the former leader of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), which oversees the military&rsquo;s most sensitive forces. McChrystal&rsquo;s leadership of JSOC is credited with the December 2003 capture of Saddam Hussein and the June 2006 location and killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. McChrystal, a former Green Beret, is known for his candor.<br /><br />After McChrystal graduated from West Point, he was commissioned as an infantry officer, and spent much of his career commanding special operations and airborne infantry units. During the Persian Gulf War, McChrystal served in a Joint Special Operations Task Force and later commanded the 75th Ranger Regiment. He completed year-long fellowships at Harvard&rsquo;s John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1997 and in 2000 at the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2002, he was appointed chief of staff of military operations in Afghanistan. Two years later, McChrystal was selected to deliver nationally televised Pentagon briefings about military operations in Iraq. From 2003 to 2008, McChrystal commanded JSOC and was responsible for leading the nation&rsquo;s deployed military counter-terrorism efforts around the globe. He assumed command of all International Forces in Afghanistan in June 2009. President Obama&rsquo;s order for an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan was based on McChrystal&rsquo;s assessment of the war there.

record of achievement, General Stanley McChrystal has been praised for creating a revolution in warfare that fused intelligence and operations. A four-star general, he is the former commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan and the former leader of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), which oversees the military&rsquo;s most sensitive forces. McChrystal&rsquo;s leadership of JSOC is credited with the December 2003 capture of Saddam Hussein and the June 2006 location and killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. McChrystal, a former Green Beret, is known for his candor.<br /><br />After McChrystal graduated from West Point, he was commissioned as an infantry officer, and spent much of his career commanding special operations and airborne infantry units. During the Persian Gulf War, McChrystal served in a Joint Special Operations Task Force and later commanded the 75th Ranger Regiment. He completed year-long fellowships at Harvard&rsquo;s John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1997 and in 2000 at the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2002, he was appointed chief of staff of military operations in Afghanistan. Two years later, McChrystal was selected to deliver nationally televised Pentagon briefings about military operations in Iraq. From 2003 to 2008, McChrystal commanded JSOC and was responsible for leading the nation&rsquo;s deployed military counter-terrorism efforts around the globe. He assumed command of all International Forces in Afghanistan in June 2009. President Obama&rsquo;s order for an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan was based on McChrystal&rsquo;s assessment of the war there. McChrystal retired from the military in August 2010. </p>", "slug": "stanley_mcchrystal", "whotheyare": "General Stanley McChrystal is the former commander of U.S. and International forces in Afghanistan.

VWell, it's great to be here.
p5
aVWe've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.
p6
aVI've been quite interested in both.
p7
aVIf we could convert 0.03 percent
p8
aVof the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy,
p9
aVwe could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.
p10
aVWe can't do that today because solar panels are heavy,
p11
aVexpensive and very inefficient.
p12
aVThere are nano-engineered designs,
p13
aVwhich at least have been analyzed theoretically,
p14
aVthat show the potential to be very lightweight,
p15
aVvery inexpensive, very efficient,
p16
aVand we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.
p17
aVNano-engineered fuel cells
p18
aVcould provide the energy where it's needed.
p19
aVThat's a key trend, which is decentralization,
p20
aVmoving from centralized nuclear power plants and
p21
aVliquid natural gas tankers
p22
aVto decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly,
p23
aVa lot more efficient
p24
aVand capable and safe from disruption.
p25
aa(lp26
VBono spoke very eloquently,
p27
aVthat we have the tools, for the first time,
p28
aVto address age-old problems of disease and poverty.
p29
aVMost regions of the world are moving in that direction.
p30
aVIn 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region,
p31
aVthere were 500 million people living in poverty \u2014
p32
aVthat number now is under 200 million.
p33
aVThe World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million,
p34
aVwhich is a reduction of 95 percent.
p35
aVI did enjoy Bono's comment
p36
aVlinking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.
p37
aVBeing from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself,
p38
aVI'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s,
p39
aValthough we hung around Harvard Square.
p40
aVBut we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty,
p41
aVand I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.
p42
aa(lp43
VKevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology.
p44
aVThat's been a strong interest of mine,
p45
aVand a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.
p46
aVI realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.
p47
aVThat invariably, the world was a different place
p48
aVwhen I would introduce a technology.
p49
aVAnd, I noticed that most inventions fail,
p50
aVnot because the R&D department can't get it to work \u2014
p51
aVif you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed
p52
aVif given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build \u2014
p53
aVand 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong \u2014
p54
aVnot all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo I began to be an ardent student of technology trends,
p57
aVand track where technology would be at different points in time,
p58
aVand began to build the mathematical models of that.
p59
aVIt's kind of taken on a life of its own.
p60
aVI've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data
p61
aVon key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.
p62
aVAnd you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.
p63
aVAnd if you ask me,
p64
aVwill the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,
p65
aVthat's very hard to say.
p66
aVWill WiMax CDMA G3
p67
aVbe the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say.
p68
aVBut if you ask me, what will it cost
p69
aVfor one MIPS of computing in 2010,
p70
aVor the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012,
p71
aVor the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014,
p72
aVit turns out that those are very predictable.
p73
aa(lp74
VThere are remarkably smooth exponential curves
p75
aVthat govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.
p76
aVAnd I'm going to show you a small sample of this,
p77
aVbut there's really a theoretical reason
p78
aVwhy technology develops in an exponential fashion.
p79
aVAnd a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.
p80
aVThey think they're going to continue
p81
aVto develop a problem
p82
aVor address a problem using today's tools,
p83
aVat today's pace of progress,
p84
aVand fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990.
p87
aVWe had our best Ph.D. students,
p88
aVour most advanced equipment around the world,
p89
aVwe got 1/10,000th of the project done,
p90
aVso how're we going to get this done in 15 years?
p91
aVAnd 10 years into the project,
p92
aVthe skeptics were still going strong \u2014 says, "You're two-thirds through this project,
p93
aVand you've managed to only sequence
p94
aVa very tiny percentage of the whole genome."
p95
aVBut it's the nature of exponential growth
p96
aVthat once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.
p97
aVMost of the project was done in the last
p98
aVfew years of the project.
p99
aVIt took us 15 years to sequence HIV \u2014
p100
aVwe sequenced SARS in 31 days.
p101
aVSo we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.
p102
aa(lp103
VI'm going to show you just a few examples
p104
aVof how pervasive this phenomena is.
p105
aVThe actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas,
p106
aVis doubling every decade, according to our models.
p107
aVThese are all logarithmic graphs,
p108
aVso as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.
p109
aVIt took us half a century to adopt the telephone,
p110
aVthe first virtual-reality technology.
p111
aVCell phones were adopted in about eight years.
p112
aVIf you put different communication technologies
p113
aVon this logarithmic graph,
p114
aVtelevision, radio, telephone
p115
aVwere adopted in decades.
p116
aVRecent technologies \u2014 like the PC, the web, cell phones \u2014
p117
aVwere under a decade.
p118
aVNow this is an interesting chart,
p119
aVand this really gets at the fundamental reason why
p120
aVan evolutionary process \u2014 and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes \u2014
p121
aVaccelerate.
p122
aVThey work through interaction \u2014 they create a capability,
p123
aVand then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo the first step in biological evolution,
p126
aVthe evolution of DNA \u2014 actually it was RNA came first \u2014
p127
aVtook billions of years,
p128
aVbut then evolution used that information-processing backbone
p129
aVto bring on the next stage.
p130
aVSo the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved,
p131
aVtook only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster.
p132
aVAnd then evolution used those body plans
p133
aVto evolve higher cognitive functions,
p134
aVand biological evolution kept accelerating.
p135
aVIt's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process.
p136
aVSo Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species,
p137
aVthe species that combined a cognitive function
p138
aVwith an opposable appendage \u2014
p139
aVand by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb \u2014
p140
aVso we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip
p141
aVand fine motor coordination,
p142
aVand use our mental models to actually change the world
p143
aVand bring on technology.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years,
p146
aVand then working through interaction,
p147
aVevolution used, essentially,
p148
aVthe technology-creating species to bring on the next stage,
p149
aVwhich were the first steps in technological evolution.
p150
aVAnd the first step took tens of thousands of years \u2014
p151
aVstone tools, fire, the wheel \u2014 kept accelerating.
p152
aVWe always used then the latest generation of technology
p153
aVto create the next generation.
p154
aVPrinting press took a century to be adopted;
p155
aVthe first computers were designed pen-on-paper \u2014 now we use computers.
p156
aVAnd we've had a continual acceleration of this process.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened,
p159
aVbut some observer says, "Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph
p160
aVthat fall on that straight line."
p161
aVSo, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers,
p162
aVlike the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar
p163
aVon the same \u2014 and these people were not trying to make my point;
p164
aVthese were just lists in reference works,
p165
aVand I think that's what they thought the key events were
p166
aVin biological evolution and technological evolution.
p167
aVAnd again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line
p168
aVbecause people do have disagreements, what the key points are,
p169
aVthere's differences of opinion when agriculture started,
p170
aVor how long the Cambrian Explosion took.
p171
aVBut you see a very clear trend.
p172
aVThere's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.
p173
aVInformation technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth,
p174
aVevery year.
p175
aVAnd that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.
p176
aVA personal experience, when I was at MIT \u2014
p177
aVcomputer taking up about the size of this room,
p178
aVless powerful than the computer in your cell phone.
p179
aVBut Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth,
p180
aVis just one example of many, because it's basically
p181
aVa property of the evolutionary process of technology.
p182
aa(lp183
VI put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph \u2014
p184
aVby the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth \u2014
p185
aVthat's another exponential.
p186
aVIt took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900,
p187
aVtwo years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.
p188
aVAnd that's exponential growth through five different paradigms.
p189
aVMoore's Law was just the last part of that,
p190
aVwhere we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit,
p191
aVbut we had electro-mechanical calculators,
p192
aVrelay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,
p193
aVvacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower,
p194
aVdiscreet transistors used in the first space flights
p195
aVand then Moore's Law.
p196
aVEvery time one paradigm ran out of steam,
p197
aVanother paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.
p198
aVThey were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller.
p199
aVThat hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.
p200
aVWhole different paradigm \u2014 transistors came out of the woodwork.
p201
aVIn fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm,
p202
aVit creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.
p203
aVAnd because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law
p204
aVfor quite a long time \u2014 the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022.
p205
aVBut by the teen years,
p206
aVthe features of transistors will be a few atoms in width,
p207
aVand we won't be able to shrink them any more.
p208
aVThat'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of
p209
aVthe exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat.
p210
aVWe live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.
p211
aVWe will go into the third dimension
p212
aVand there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years,
p213
aVof getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.
p214
aVWe'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.
p215
aVSupercomputers \u2014 same thing.
p216
aVProcessor performance on Intel chips,
p217
aVthe average price of a transistor \u2014
p218
aV1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.
p219
aVYou could buy 10 million in 2002.
p220
aa(lp221
VIt's pretty remarkable how smooth
p222
aVan exponential process that is.
p223
aVI mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment,
p224
aVbut this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior \u2014
p225
aVcountries accusing each other of dumping products,
p226
aVIPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs.
p227
aVYou would think it would be a very erratic process,
p228
aVand you have a very smooth
p229
aVoutcome of this chaotic process.
p230
aVJust as we can't predict
p231
aVwhat one molecule in a gas will do \u2014
p232
aVit's hopeless to predict a single molecule \u2014
p233
aVyet we can predict the properties of the whole gas,
p234
aVusing thermodynamics, very accurately.
p235
aVIt's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project,
p236
aVbut the result of this whole worldwide,
p237
aVchaotic, unpredictable activity of competition
p238
aVand the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.
p239
aVAnd we can predict these trends far into the future.
p240
aVUnlike Gertrude Stein's roses,
p241
aVit's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.
p242
aVAs we make them smaller and less expensive,
p243
aVthe electrons have less distance to travel.
p244
aVThey're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors,
p245
aVso the cost of a cycle of one transistor
p246
aVhas been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.
p247
aVYou add other forms of innovation and processor design,
p248
aVyou get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd that's basically deflation \u2014
p251
aV50 percent deflation.
p252
aVAnd it's not just computers. I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing;
p253
aVit's true of brain scanning;
p254
aVit's true of the World Wide Web. I mean, anything that we can quantify,
p255
aVwe have hundreds of different measurements
p256
aVof different, information-related measurements \u2014
p257
aVcapacity, adoption rates \u2014
p258
aVand they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months,
p259
aVdepending on what you're looking at.
p260
aVIn terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.
p261
aVAnd economists have actually started worrying about that.
p262
aVWe had deflation during the Depression,
p263
aVbut that was collapse of the money supply,
p264
aVcollapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena.
p265
aVThis is due to greater productivity,
p266
aVbut the economist says, "But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that.
p267
aVIf you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume
p268
aV30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it."
p269
aVBut what we're actually seeing is that
p270
aVwe actually more than keep up with it.
p271
aVWe've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars
p272
aVin information technology over the last 50 years.
p273
aVI mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.
p274
aVAs the price performance makes new applications feasible,
p275
aVnew applications come to the market.
p276
aVAnd this is a very widespread phenomena.
p277
aVMagnetic data storage \u2014
p278
aVthat's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots,
p279
aVdifferent engineers, different companies, same exponential process.
p280
aa(lp281
VA key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology
p282
aVin these information terms.
p283
aVWe're understanding the software programs
p284
aVthat make our body run.
p285
aVThese were evolved in very different times \u2014
p286
aVwe'd like to actually change those programs.
p287
aVOne little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene,
p288
aVbasically says, "Hold onto every calorie,
p289
aVbecause the next hunting season may not work out so well."
p290
aVThat was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.
p291
aVWe'd like to actually turn that program off.
p292
aVThey tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously
p293
aVand remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.
p294
aVThey didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease;
p295
aVthey lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction
p296
aVwithout the restriction.
p297
aVFour or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this,
p298
aVfelt that would be
p299
aVinteresting drug for the human market,
p300
aVand that's just one of the 30,000 genes
p301
aVthat affect our biochemistry.
p302
aa(lp303
VWe were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people
p304
aVat the age of most people at this conference, like myself,
p305
aVto live much longer, because we were using up the precious resources
p306
aVwhich were better deployed towards the children
p307
aVand those caring for them.
p308
aVSo, life \u2014 long lifespans \u2014
p309
aVlike, that is to say, much more than 30 \u2014
p310
aVweren't selected for,
p311
aVbut we are learning to actually manipulate
p312
aVand change these software programs
p313
aVthrough the biotechnology revolution.
p314
aVFor example, we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference.
p315
aVThere are exciting new forms of gene therapy
p316
aVthat overcome the problem of placing the genetic material
p317
aVin the right place on the chromosome.
p318
aVThere's actually a \u2014 for the first time now,
p319
aVsomething going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension \u2014
p320
aVa fatal disease \u2014 using gene therapy.
p321
aVSo we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.
p322
aVAnd this technology is also accelerating.
p323
aVIt cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990,
p324
aVthen a penny in 2000.
p325
aVIt's now under a 10th of a cent.
p326
aVThe amount of genetic data \u2014
p327
aVbasically this shows that smooth exponential growth
p328
aVdoubled every year,
p329
aVenabling the genome project to be completed.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnother major revolution: the communications revolution.
p332
aVThe price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways;
p333
aVwired, wireless is growing exponentially.
p334
aVThe Internet has been doubling in power and continues to,
p335
aVmeasured many different ways.
p336
aVThis is based on the number of hosts.
p337
aa(lp338
VMiniaturization \u2014 we're shrinking the size of technology
p339
aVat an exponential rate,
p340
aVboth wired and wireless.
p341
aVThese are some designs from Eric Drexler's book \u2014
p342
aVwhich we're now showing are feasible
p343
aVwith super-computing simulations,
p344
aVwhere actually there are scientists building
p345
aVmolecule-scale robots.
p346
aVOne has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait,
p347
aVthat's built out of molecules.
p348
aVThere are little machines doing things in experimental bases.
p349
aVThe most exciting opportunity
p350
aVis actually to go inside the human body
p351
aVand perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.
p352
aVAnd this is less futuristic than it may sound.
p353
aVThese things have already been done in animals.
p354
aa(lp355
VThere's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized.
p356
aVThey put tens of thousands of these
p357
aVin the blood cell \u2014 they tried this in rats \u2014
p358
aVit lets insulin out in a controlled fashion,
p359
aVand actually cures type 1 diabetes.
p360
aVWhat you're watching is a design
p361
aVof a robotic red blood cell,
p362
aVand it does bring up the issue that our biology
p363
aVis actually very sub-optimal,
p364
aVeven though it's remarkable in its intricacy.
p365
aVOnce we understand its principles of operation,
p366
aVand the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating,
p367
aVwe can actually design these things to be
p368
aVthousands of times more capable.
p369
aVAn analysis of this respirocyte, designed by Rob Freitas,
p370
aVindicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions,
p371
aVyou could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath.
p372
aVYou could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours \u2014
p373
aVso, "Honey, I'm in the pool," will take on a whole new meaning.
p374
aVIt will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.
p375
aVPresumably we'll ban them,
p376
aVbut then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms
p377
aVroutinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.
p378
aVFreitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell.
p379
aVThese are 2020-circa scenarios,
p380
aVbut they're not as futuristic as it may sound.
p381
aVThere are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices;
p382
aVthere are many experiments in animals.
p383
aVThere's actually one going into human trial,
p384
aVso this is feasible technology.
p385
aa(lp386
VIf we come back to our exponential growth of computing,
p387
aV1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain.
p388
aVIt will intersect human intelligence
p389
aVin terms of capacity in the 2020s,
p390
aVbut that'll be the hardware side of the equation.
p391
aVWhere will we get the software?
p392
aVWell, it turns out we can see inside the human brain,
p393
aVand in fact not surprisingly,
p394
aVthe spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.
p395
aVAnd with the new generation of scanning tools,
p396
aVfor the first time we can actually see
p397
aVindividual inter-neural fibers
p398
aVand see them processing and signaling in real time \u2014
p399
aVbut then the question is, OK, we can get this data now,
p400
aVbut can we understand it?
p401
aVDoug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligence
p402
aVjust isn't great enough to understand our intelligence,
p403
aVand if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated,
p404
aVand we'd never catch up to it.
p405
aVIt turns out that we can understand it.
p406
aa(lp407
VThis is a block diagram of
p408
aVa model and simulation of the human auditory cortex
p409
aVthat actually works quite well \u2014
p410
aVin applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception.
p411
aVThere's another simulation of the cerebellum \u2014
p412
aVthat's more than half the neurons in the brain \u2014
p413
aVagain, works very similarly to human skill formation.
p414
aVThis is at an early stage, but you can show
p415
aVwith the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain
p416
aVand the exponential improvement
p417
aVin the resolution of brain scanning,
p418
aVwe will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain
p419
aVby the 2020s.
p420
aVWe've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions
p421
aVout of the several hundred.
p422
aa(lp423
VAll of this is driving
p424
aVexponentially growing economic progress.
p425
aVWe've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour
p426
aVof labor in the last 50 years.
p427
aVE-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars.
p428
aVYou might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?
p429
aVThat was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.
p430
aVWall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was,
p431
aVbut then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models,
p432
aVthey figured, well, that was wrong,
p433
aVand then we had this bust.
p434
aa(lp435
VAll right, this is a technology
p436
aVthat we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.
p437
aVThis will be a routine feature in a cell phone.
p438
aVIt would be able to translate from one language to another.
p439
aa(lp440
VSo let me just end with a couple of scenarios.
p441
aVBy 2010 computers will disappear.
p442
aVThey'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.
p443
aVImages will be written directly to our retina,
p444
aVproviding full-immersion virtual reality,
p445
aVaugmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.
p446
aa(lp447
VBut if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends,
p448
aVand you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw
p449
aVin terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point.
p450
aVI mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power
p451
aVgreater price performance, capacity and bandwidth
p452
aVof these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.
p453
aVIt'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.
p454
aVWe'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain,
p455
aV1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful
p456
aVthan the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.
p457
aVComputers will combine
p458
aVthe subtle pan-recognition powers
p459
aVof human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior,
p460
aVin terms of doing analytic thinking,
p461
aVremembering billions of facts accurately.
p462
aVMachines can share their knowledge very quickly.
p463
aVBut it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines.
p464
aVWe are going to merge with our technology.
p465
aa(lp466
VThese nano-bots I mentioned
p467
aVwill first be used for medical and health applications:
p468
aVcleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells
p469
aVand widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment.
p470
aVBut they'll also go inside our brain,
p471
aVinteract with our biological neurons.
p472
aVWe've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.
p473
aVSo, for example,
p474
aVfull-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system,
p475
aVthe nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses,
p476
aVreplace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving
p477
aVif you were in the virtual environment,
p478
aVand then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment.
p479
aVYou can go there with other people, have any kind of experience
p480
aVwith anyone involving all of the senses.
p481
aV"Experience beamers," I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences
p482
aVin the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.
p483
aVYou can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.
p484
aVBut most importantly,
p485
aVit'll be a tremendous expansion
p486
aVof human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology,
p487
aVwhich in some sense we're doing already.
p488
aVWe routinely do intellectual feats
p489
aVthat would be impossible without our technology.
p490
aVHuman life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800,
p491
aVand with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions,
p492
aVthis will move up very rapidly
p493
aVin the years ahead.
p494
aa(lp495
VMy main message is that progress in technology
p496
aVis exponential, not linear.
p497
aVMany \u2014 even scientists \u2014 assume a linear model,
p498
aVso they'll say, "Oh, it'll be hundreds of years
p499
aVbefore we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly
p500
aVor artificial intelligence."
p501
aVIf you really look at the power of exponential growth,
p502
aVyou'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.
p503
aVAnd information technology is increasingly encompassing
p504
aVall of our lives, from our music to our manufacturing
p505
aVto our biology to our energy to materials.
p506
aa(lp507
VWe'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s,
p508
aVfrom information, in very inexpensive raw materials,
p509
aVusing nano-technology.
p510
aVThese are very powerful technologies.
p511
aVThey both empower our promise and our peril.
p512
aVSo we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.
p513
aa(lp514
VThank you very much.

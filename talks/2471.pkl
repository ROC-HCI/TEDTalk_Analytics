VSo there are lands few and far between on Earth itself
p5
aVthat are hospitable to humans by any measure,
p6
aVbut survive we have.
p7
aVOur primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered,
p8
aVthey dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories
p9
aVin search of better opportunities.
p10
aVAnd as the descendants of these explorers,
p11
aVwe have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins.
p12
aVBut at the same time,
p13
aVdistracted by our bread and circuses
p14
aVand embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other,
p15
aVit seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore.
p16
aVWe, as a species, we're evolved uniquely
p17
aVfor Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,
p18
aVand so content are we with our living conditions
p19
aVthat we have grown complacent and just too busy
p20
aVto notice that its resources are finite,
p21
aVand that our Sun's life is also finite.
p22
aVWhile Mars and all the movies made in its name
p23
aVhave reinvigorated the ethos for space travel,
p24
aVfew of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution
p25
aVis woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space.
p26
aa(lp27
VLet us take a trek to your local national forest
p28
aVfor a quick reality check.
p29
aVSo just a quick show of hands here:
p30
aVhow many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness
p31
aVfor a few days?
p32
aVWell, that's a lot of you.
p33
aVHow about a few weeks?
p34
aVThat's a decent amount.
p35
aVHow about a few months?
p36
aVThat's pretty good too.
p37
aVNow, let us imagine that this local national forest
p38
aVexperiences an eternal winter.
p39
aVSame questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days?
p40
aVThat's quite a lot.
p41
aVHow about a few weeks?
p42
aVSo for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available
p43
aVis trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface.
p44
aVSoil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found,
p45
aVand of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of.
p46
aa(lp47
VSuch examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face
p48
aVon a planet like Mars.
p49
aVSo how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed
p50
aVfrom a tropical vacation?
p51
aVWill we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth?
p52
aVBuild space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts
p53
aVthat tether your planet of choice to our home planet?
p54
aVAnd how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?
p55
aa(lp56
VBut I'm getting ahead of myself.
p57
aVIn our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun,
p58
aVwe are more likely than not going to be spending much time
p59
aVin the journey itself,
p60
aVin space,
p61
aVon a ship, a hermetic flying can,
p62
aVpossibly for many generations.
p63
aa(lp64
VThe longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space
p65
aVis in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.
p66
aVFrom astronauts' experiences in space,
p67
aVwe know that spending time in a microgravity environment
p68
aVmeans bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems,
p69
aVamong many other complications
p70
aVthat range for the physiological to the psychological.
p71
aVAnd what about macrogravity,
p72
aVor any other variation in gravitational pull
p73
aVof the planet that we find ourselves on?
p74
aa(lp75
VIn short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers
p76
aVboth known and unknown.
p77
aVSo far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology
p78
aVor that great next generation robot
p79
aVas part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space.
p80
aVWonderful as they are, I believe the time has come
p81
aVfor us to complement these bulky electronic giants
p82
aVwith what nature has already invented:
p83
aVthe microbe,
p84
aVa single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing,
p85
aVliving machine.
p86
aVIt requires fairly little to maintain,
p87
aVoffers much flexibility in design
p88
aVand only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe
p91
aVis known as synthetic biology.
p92
aVIt comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines
p93
aVand better ways to observe the physiological nuances
p94
aVof the human body.
p95
aVUsing the tools of synthetic biology,
p96
aVwe can now edit the genes of nearly any organism,
p97
aVmicroscopic or not,
p98
aVwith incredible speed and fidelity.
p99
aVGiven the limitations of our man-made machines,
p100
aVsynthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food,
p101
aVour fuel and our environment,
p102
aVbut also ourselves
p103
aVto compensate for our physical inadequacies
p104
aVand to ensure our survival in space.
p105
aa(lp106
VTo give you an example
p107
aVof how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration,
p108
aVlet us return to the Mars environment.
p109
aVThe Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,
p110
aVwith trace amounts of organic material.
p111
aVLet's say, hypothetically,
p112
aVwhat if martian soil could actually support plant growth
p113
aVwithout using Earth-derived nutrients?
p114
aVThe first question we should probably ask is,
p115
aVhow would we make our plants cold-tolerant?
p116
aVBecause, on average, the temperature on Mars
p117
aVis a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade.
p118
aVThe next question we should ask is,
p119
aVhow do we make our plants drought-tolerant?
p120
aVConsidering that most of the water that forms as frost
p121
aVevaporates more quickly than I can say the word "evaporate."
p122
aVWell, it turns out we've already done things like this.
p123
aVBy borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish
p124
aVand genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice
p125
aVand then stitching them into the plants that need them,
p126
aVwe now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes.
p127
aVThey're known on Earth as GMOs,
p128
aVor genetically modified organisms,
p129
aVand we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization.
p130
aVNature does stuff like this already,
p131
aVwithout our help.
p132
aVWe have simply found more precise ways to do it.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space?
p135
aVWell, to not do so would mean needing to engineer
p136
aVendless acres of land on an entirely new planet
p137
aVby releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses
p138
aVand then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all.
p139
aVIt's an unrealistic engineering enterprise
p140
aVthat quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission.
p141
aVOne of the best ways to ensure
p142
aVthat we will have the food supplies and the air that we need
p143
aVis to bring with us organisms that have been engineered
p144
aVto adapt to new and harsh environments.
p145
aVIn essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet
p146
aVboth in the short and long term.
p147
aVThese organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us,
p150
aVbut what else can we do?
p151
aVWell, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species,
p152
aVwere evolved uniquely for planet Earth.
p153
aVThat fact has not changed much in the last five minutes
p154
aVthat you were sitting here and I was standing there.
p155
aVAnd so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute,
p156
aVeven given ample food, water, air
p157
aVand a suit,
p158
aVwe are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems
p159
aVfrom the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface
p160
aVof planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere.
p161
aVUnless we plan to stay holed up underground
p162
aVfor the duration of our stay on every new planet,
p163
aVwe must find better ways of protecting ourselves
p164
aVwithout needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor
p165
aVthat weighs something equal to your own body weight,
p166
aVor needing to hide behind a wall of lead.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo let us appeal to nature for inspiration.
p169
aVAmong the plethora of life here on Earth,
p170
aVthere's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles,
p171
aVor lovers of extreme living conditions,
p172
aVif you'll remember from high school biology.
p173
aVAnd among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.
p174
aVIt is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid,
p175
aVand, most notably, radiation.
p176
aVWhile its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known,
p177
aVwe have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals.
p178
aVTo do so is not particularly easy.
p179
aVThere are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance,
p180
aVand it's not as simple as transferring one gene.
p181
aVBut given a little bit of human ingenuity
p182
aVand a little bit of time,
p183
aVI think to do so is not very hard either.
p184
aVEven if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation,
p185
aVit would be infinitely better than what we already have,
p186
aVwhich is just the melanin in our skin.
p187
aVUsing the tools of synthetic biology,
p188
aVwe can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability
p189
aVto thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation.
p190
aVAs difficult as it is to see,
p191
aVhomo sapiens, that is humans,
p192
aVevolves every day,
p193
aVand still continues to evolve.
p194
aVThousands of years of human evolution
p195
aVhas not only given us humans like Tibetans,
p196
aVwho can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,
p197
aVbut also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic,
p198
aVthe chemical element that can kill the average human being.
p199
aVEvery day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations
p200
aVthat equally accidentally allow certain humans
p201
aVto persevere in dismal situations.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut, and this is a big but,
p204
aVsuch evolution requires two things that we may not always have,
p205
aVor be able to afford,
p206
aVand they are death and time.
p207
aVIn our species' struggle to find our place in the universe,
p208
aVwe may not always have the time necessary
p209
aVfor the natural evolution of extra functions
p210
aVfor survival on non-Earth planets.
p211
aVWe're living in what E.O. Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention,
p212
aVduring which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy
p213
aVwith temporary external supplements.
p214
aVBut with every passing day,
p215
aVwe approach the age of volitional evolution,
p216
aVa time during which we as a species
p217
aVwill have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny.
p218
aVAugmenting the human body with new abilities
p219
aVis no longer a question of how,
p220
aVbut of when.
p221
aa(lp222
VUsing synthetic biology
p223
aVto change the genetic makeup of any living organisms,
p224
aVespecially our own,
p225
aVis not without its moral and ethical quandaries.
p226
aVWill engineering ourselves make us less human?
p227
aVBut then again, what is humanity
p228
aVbut star stuff that happens to be conscious?
p229
aVWhere should human genius direct itself?
p230
aVSurely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it.
p231
aVHow do we use our knowledge
p232
aVto protect ourselves from the external dangers
p233
aVand then protect ourselves from ourselves?
p234
aa(lp235
VI pose these questions
p236
aVnot to engender the fear of science
p237
aVbut to bring to light the many possibilities
p238
aVthat science has afforded and continues to afford us.
p239
aVWe must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions
p240
aVnot only with caution
p241
aVbut also with courage.
p242
aa(lp243
VMars is a destination,
p244
aVbut it will not be our last.
p245
aVOur true final frontier is the line we must cross
p246
aVin deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence.
p247
aa(lp248
VSpace is cold, brutal and unforgiving.
p249
aVOur path to the stars will be rife with trials
p250
aVthat will bring us to question not only who we are
p251
aVbut where we will be going.
p252
aVThe answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology
p253
aVthat we have gleaned from life itself,
p254
aVand it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe.
p255
aa(lp256
VThank you.

Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider.

To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours appears to be quite an achievement.

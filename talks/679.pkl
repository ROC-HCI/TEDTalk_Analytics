VI'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule
p5
aVfrom a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective.
p6
aVI'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history
p7
aVof compassion and the golden rule.
p8
aVSo, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language,
p9
aVand so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy
p10
aVas your average compassion talk.
p11
aVI want to warn you about that.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great.
p14
aVThe golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both.
p15
aVAnd I think it's great that
p16
aVthe leaders of the religions of the world
p17
aVare affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles
p18
aVthat are integral to their faiths.
p19
aa(lp20
VAt the same time, I think religions don't deserve all the credit.
p21
aVI think nature gave them a helping hand here.
p22
aVI'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule
p23
aVare, in a certain sense, built into human nature.
p24
aVBut I'm also going to argue
p25
aVthat once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature,
p26
aVyou realize that just affirming compassion,
p27
aVand affirming the golden rule, is really not enough.
p28
aVThere's a lot of work to be done after that.
p29
aa(lp30
VOK so, a quick natural history, first of compassion.
p31
aVIn the beginning, there was compassion,
p32
aVand I mean not just when human beings first showed up,
p33
aVbut actually even before that.
p34
aVI think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage,
p35
aVeven before there were homo sapiens,
p36
aVfeelings like compassion and love and sympathy
p37
aVhad earned their way into the gene pool,
p38
aVand biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened.
p39
aa(lp40
VIt happened through a principle known as kin selection.
p41
aVAnd the basic idea of kin selection is that,
p42
aVif an animal feels compassion for a close relative,
p43
aVand this compassion leads the animal to help the relative,
p44
aVthen, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes
p45
aVunderlying the compassion itself.
p46
aVSo, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually
p47
aVa gene's way of helping itself. OK.
p48
aa(lp49
VI warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.
p50
aVI'll get there \u2014 I hope to get a little fuzzier.
p51
aVThis doesn't bother me so much,
p52
aVthat the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion
p53
aVis kind of self-serving at the genetic level.
p54
aVActually, I think the bad news about kin selection
p55
aVis just that it means that this kind of compassion
p56
aVis naturally deployed only within the family.
p57
aVThat's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural.
p58
aVThe bad news is that this kin selected compassion
p59
aVis naturally confined to the family.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, there's more good news that came along later in evolution,
p62
aVa second kind of evolutionary logic.
p63
aVBiologists call that "reciprocal altruism." OK.
p64
aVAnd there, the basic idea is that
p65
aVcompassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.
p66
aVAgain, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion
p67
aVas you may have heard in the past,
p68
aVbut from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion
p69
aVis ultimately self-serving too.
p70
aVIt's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.
p71
aVIt's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic.
p72
aVAnd so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.
p73
aa(lp74
VI'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them,
p75
aVyou feel really bad.
p76
aVBut if you read in the newspaper
p77
aVthat something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of,
p78
aVyou can probably live with that.
p79
aVThat's just human nature.
p80
aVSo, it's another good news/bad news story.
p81
aVIt's good that compassion was extended beyond the family
p82
aVby this kind of evolutionary logic.
p83
aVThe bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself.
p84
aVSo, there's still work to be done.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism,
p87
aVwhich I think is kind of good news,
p88
aVwhich is that the way that this is played out in the human species,
p89
aVit has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.
p90
aVI don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes,
p91
aVbut you can go to a hunter gatherer society
p92
aVthat has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions,
p93
aVno exposure to ethical philosophy,
p94
aVand you'll find, if you spend time with these people,
p95
aVthat, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another,
p96
aVand that bad deeds should be punished.
p97
aVAnd evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes.
p98
aVSo, they do understand that if you want to be treated well,
p99
aVyou treat other people well.
p100
aVAnd it's good to treat other people well.
p101
aVThat's close to being a kind of built-in intuition.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention,
p104
aVyou're probably anticipating that there's bad news here;
p105
aVwe still aren't to universal love,
p106
aVand it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural,
p107
aVit's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.
p108
aa(lp109
VI mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison,
p110
aVbut we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right?
p111
aVSo, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated.
p112
aVNow, we have a rationale for that.
p113
aVWe say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.
p114
aa(lp115
VNone of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion.
p116
aVWe have the capacity to carve out exceptions,
p117
aVput people in a special category.
p118
aVAnd the problem is that \u2014 although in the case of sending people to prison,
p119
aVyou have this impartial judiciary
p120
aVdetermining who gets excluded from the golden rule \u2014
p121
aVthat in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions
p122
aVabout who we're not going to extend the golden rule to,
p123
aVis we use a much rougher and readier formula.
p124
aVBasically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival \u2014
p125
aVif you're not my friend, if you're not in my family \u2014
p126
aVI'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you.
p127
aa(lp128
VWe all do that,
p129
aVand you see it all over the world.
p130
aVYou see it in the Middle East:
p131
aVpeople who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel.
p132
aVThey wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say,
p133
aV"Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things
p134
aVthat put them in a special category."
p135
aVThe Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them,
p136
aVbut they impose one on Gaza, and they say,
p137
aV"Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves."
p138
aa(lp139
VSo, it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble.
p140
aVAnd it's natural to do that.
p141
aVSo, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us
p142
aVis not, by itself, going to bring us universal love.
p143
aVIt's not going to save the world.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay.
p146
aVAre you on the edges of your seats here?
p147
aVGood, because before I tell you about that good news,
p148
aVI'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain.
p149
aVSo, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news
p150
aVthat may save the world.
p151
aa(lp152
VIt's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.
p153
aVIt's just a quick introduction to game theory.
p154
aVThis won't hurt. Okay.
p155
aVIt's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.
p156
aVIf you ask what kind of a situation
p157
aVis conducive to people becoming friends and allies,
p158
aVthe technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation.
p159
aVAnd if you ask what kind of situation
p160
aVis conducive to people defining people as enemies,
p161
aVit's a zero-sum situation.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo, what do those terms mean?
p164
aVBasically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports,
p165
aVwhere there's a winner and a loser.
p166
aVSo, their fortunes add up to zero.
p167
aVSo, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person,
p168
aVor good for them, bad for you.
p169
aVEither way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, if you're playing doubles,
p172
aVthen the person on your side of the net
p173
aVis in a non-zero-sum relationship with you,
p174
aVbecause every point is either good for both of you \u2014 positive, win-win \u2014
p175
aVor bad for both of you, it's lose-lose.
p176
aVThat's a non-zero-sum game.
p177
aVAnd in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.
p178
aVIn the realm of economics, say, if you buy something:
p179
aVthat means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money,
p180
aVbut the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise.
p181
aVYou both feel you've won.
p182
aVIn a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.
p183
aVIt's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life.
p186
aVAnd you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,
p187
aVabout how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed,
p188
aVby just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels
p189
aVwhere people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation
p190
aVwith some of their friends or allies.
p191
aVThe deployment of the golden rule
p192
aVmost naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels.
p193
aVSo, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness
p194
aVare where you would expect compassion and the golden rule
p195
aVto kind of work their magic.
p196
aVWith zero-sum channels you would expect something else.
p197
aa(lp198
VOkay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world.
p199
aVAnd now I can admit that it might not too,
p200
aVnow that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff.
p201
aVBut it may. And the good news is that history
p202
aVhas naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness,
p203
aVthese webs that can be these channels for compassion.
p204
aVYou can go back all the way to the stone age:
p205
aVtechnological evolution \u2014 roads, the wheel, writing,
p206
aVa lot of transportation and communication technologies \u2014
p207
aVhas just inexorably made it so that more people
p208
aVcan be in more non-zero-sum relationships
p209
aVwith more and more people at greater and greater distances.
p210
aVThat's the story of civilization.
p211
aVIt's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village
p212
aVto the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world.
p213
aVAnd the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness.
p214
aa(lp215
VYou've probably heard the term "interdependence"
p216
aVapplied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum.
p217
aVIf your fortunes are interdependent with somebody,
p218
aVthen you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them.
p219
aVAnd you see this all the time in the modern world.
p220
aVYou saw it with the recent economic crash,
p221
aVwhere bad things happen in the economy \u2014
p222
aVbad for everybody, for much of the world.
p223
aVGood things happen, and it's good for much of the world.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence
p226
aVthat this non-zero-sum kind of connection
p227
aVcan expand the moral compass.
p228
aVI mean, if you look at the American attitudes
p229
aVtoward Japanese during World War II \u2014
p230
aVlook at the depictions of Japanese
p231
aVin the American media as just about subhuman,
p232
aVand look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs,
p233
aVreally without giving it much of a thought \u2014
p234
aVand you compare that to the attitude now,
p235
aVI think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.
p236
aa(lp237
VAny form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship
p238
aVforces you to acknowledge the humanity of people.
p239
aVSo, I think that's good.
p240
aVAnd the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics.
p241
aVEnvironmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat.
p242
aVAnd there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of.
p243
aa(lp244
VFor example, probably a lot of American Christians
p245
aVdon't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship
p246
aVwith Muslims halfway around the world,
p247
aVbut they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier
p248
aVwith their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it,
p249
aVthat's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists
p250
aVto threaten American security.
p251
aVIf they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness.
p254
aVAnd so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness,
p255
aVwhy has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding?
p256
aVThe answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk.
p257
aVCertainly, a couple of things are that,
p258
aVfirst of all, there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world.
p259
aVAnd also, sometimes people don't recognize
p260
aVthe non-zero-sum dynamics in the world.
p261
aVIn both of these areas,
p262
aVI think politicians can play a role.
p263
aa(lp264
VThis isn't only about religion.
p265
aVI think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships,
p266
aVEconomic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on,
p267
aVin this regard.
p268
aVAnd politicians can be aware, and should be aware that,
p269
aVwhen people around the world are looking at them,
p270
aVare looking at their nation
p271
aVand picking up their cues
p272
aVfor whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation \u2014
p273
aVlike, say, America, or any other nation \u2014
p274
aVhuman psychology is such that they use cues like:
p275
aVDo we feel we're being respected?
p276
aVBecause, you know, historically, if you're not being respected,
p277
aVyou're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum,
p278
aVmutually profitable relationship with people.
p279
aVSo, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out.
p280
aVAnd some of this, again, is in the realm of political work.
p281
aa(lp282
VIf there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do,
p283
aVpoliticians, religious leaders, and us,
p284
aVit would be what I call "expanding the moral imagination" \u2014
p285
aVthat is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes
p286
aVof people in very different circumstances.
p287
aVThis is not the same as compassion,
p288
aVbut it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion.
p289
aVAnd I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story,
p290
aVwhich is that the moral imagination is part of human nature.
p291
aVThat's good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively.
p292
aa(lp293
VOnce we define somebody as an enemy,
p294
aVwe have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally.
p295
aVSo, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American:
p296
aVsomebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV.
p297
aVWell, the average American is going to resist
p298
aVthe moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head
p299
aVand is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person.
p300
aVAnd if you tell them, "Well, they think America disrespects them
p301
aVand even wants to dominate them, and they hate America.
p302
aVHas there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much
p303
aVthat you kind of hated them briefly"?
p304
aVYou know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human.
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd, similarly, the person in Iran:
p307
aVwhen you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil,
p308
aVthey'll have trouble with that.
p309
aVSo, it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination
p310
aVto a place it doesn't naturally go.
p311
aVI think it's worth the trouble because,
p312
aVagain, it just helps us to understand.
p313
aVIf you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags,
p314
aVit helps to understand what makes them do it.
p315
aVAnd I think it's good moral exercise.
p316
aa(lp317
VI would say here is where religious leaders come in,
p318
aVbecause religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people,
p319
aVat harnessing the emotional centers of the brain
p320
aVto get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think.
p321
aVI mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business.
p322
aVIt's their great calling right now,
p323
aVto get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations,
p324
aVappreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat.
p325
aa(lp326
VI would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective,
p327
aVas far as compassion and the golden rule go,
p328
aVby saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule
p329
aVare in some sense built into human nature.
p330
aVIt's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed.
p331
aVAnd it's going to take real work to change that.
p332
aVBut, nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.
p333

S'{"viewed_count": 238345, "speakers": [{"description": "Journalist, philosopher", "firstname": "Robert", "title": "", "lastname": "Wright", "middleinitial": "", "whylisten": "<p>Author Robert Wright thinks the crises the human species now faces are moral in nature, and that our salvation lies in the intelligent pursuit of self-interest.

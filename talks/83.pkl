VI have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant.
p5
aVAfter two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed,
p6
aVand feel that you are one of the great hopes \u2014
p7
aVnot just for American achievement in science and technology,
p8
aVbut for the whole world.
p9
aVI've come, however, on a special mission on behalf of my constituency,
p10
aVwhich are the 10-to-the-18th-power \u2014 that's a million trillion \u2014
p11
aVinsects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them.
p12
aVIf we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet \u2014
p13
aVwhich we are trying hard to do \u2014
p14
aVthe rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land.
p15
aVAnd within a few months.
p16
aVNow, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy?
p17
aa(lp18
VAs a little boy, and through my teenage years,
p19
aVI became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life.
p20
aVI had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period
p21
aVand finally and definitively, an ant period.
p22
aVBy my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist,
p23
aVa specialist on the biology of ants,
p24
aVbut my attention and research continued to make journeys
p25
aVacross the great variety of life on Earth in general \u2014
p26
aVincluding all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it
p27
aVand how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it.
p28
aa(lp29
VOut of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition,
p30
aVcrystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you.
p31
aVMy choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment
p32
aVthat began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, on the Florida peninsula.
p33
aVAs far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region
p34
aVand the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there.
p35
aVOne day when I was only seven years old and fishing,
p36
aVI pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast,
p37
aVand I blinded myself in one eye.
p38
aVI later discovered I was also hard of hearing,
p39
aVpossibly congenitally, in the upper registers.
p40
aVSo in planning to be a professional naturalist \u2014
p41
aVI never considered anything else in my entire life \u2014
p42
aVI found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either.
p43
aVSo I turned to the teeming small creatures
p44
aVthat can be held between the thumb and forefinger:
p45
aVthe little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems,
p46
aVthe little things, as I like to say, who run the world.
p47
aVIn so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich,
p48
aVthat it seemed as though it exists on another planet.
p49
aVIn fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet.
p50
aVThe great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science.
p51
aa(lp52
VIn the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world
p53
aVand advances in technology,
p54
aVbiologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species,
p55
aVto bring the current total to 5,400,
p56
aVand more continue to pour in.
p57
aVTwo new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes,
p58
aVdozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant \u2014
p59
aVand even a distinct kind of gorilla.
p60
aVAt the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria,
p61
aVthe Prochlorococci \u2014 that will be on the final exam \u2014
p62
aValthough discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth,
p63
aVand moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.
p64
aVThese bacteria were not uncovered sooner
p65
aVbecause they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms \u2014
p66
aVso minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy.
p67
aVYet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures.
p68
aa(lp69
VThese examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet.
p70
aVConsider the fungi \u2014 including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.
p71
aV60,000 species are known to science,
p72
aVbut more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist.
p73
aVConsider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals.
p74
aVFour out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms \u2014
p75
aVif all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated,
p76
aVyou could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms.
p77
aVAbout 16,000 species of nematode worms
p78
aVhave been discovered and diagnosed by scientists;
p79
aVthere could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown.
p80
aVThis vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further
p81
aVby the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria,
p82
aVwhich within just the last several years
p83
aVstill were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide.
p84
aVBut that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil,
p85
aVjust a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there.
p86
aVIt's been estimated that a single ton of soil \u2014 fertile soil \u2014
p87
aVcontains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo the question is: what are they all doing?
p90
aVThe fact is, we don't know.
p91
aVWe are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment,
p92
aVdone by faith and guess alone.
p93
aVOur lives depend upon these creatures.
p94
aVTo take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known \u2014
p95
aVfriendly bacteria \u2014 living symbiotically in your mouth and throat
p96
aVprobably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria.
p97
aa(lp98
VAt this point I think we have a little impressionistic film
p99
aVthat was made especially for this occasion.
p100
aVAnd I'd like to show it.
p101
aVAssisted in this by Billie Holiday.
p102
aV(Video)
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd that may be just the beginning!
p105
aVThe viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages,
p106
aVthe gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria,
p107
aVare a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves.
p108
aVWhat constitutes a viral species is still unresolved,
p109
aValthough they're obviously of enormous importance to us.
p110
aVBut this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses
p111
aVexceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined.
p112
aVNowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity,
p113
aVscientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology.
p116
aVAlready it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours.
p117
aVSoon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs \u2014
p118
aVto hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface
p119
aVin the way you go watching for birds with binoculars.
p120
aVWhat will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously?
p121
aVAs we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants
p122
aVto the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond
p123
aVto the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world
p124
aVenveloped and living within humanity?
p125
aVAlready what were thought to be bacteria for generations
p126
aVhave been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms:
p127
aVtrue bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea,
p128
aVwhich are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to.
p129
aa(lp130
VSome serious biologists, and I count myself among them,
p131
aVhave begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms,
p132
aVone might \u2014 just might \u2014 find aliens among them.
p133
aVTrue aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space.
p134
aVThey've had billions of years to do it,
p135
aVbut especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.
p136
aVWe do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin
p137
aVare capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature
p138
aVand other harsh changes in environment,
p139
aVincluding hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels
p140
aVaround the growing population of bacteria.
p141
aVThere may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically
p142
aVand the species that compose it as a great flux of entities
p143
aVhardly worth distinguishing one from the other.
p144
aVBut each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci,
p145
aVare masterpieces of evolution.
p146
aVEach has persisted for thousands to millions of years.
p147
aVEach is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,
p148
aVinterlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend
p149
aVin ways we have not begun even to imagine.
p150
aVWe will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them
p151
aVat the peril of our own existence \u2014
p152
aVand unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy.
p153
aa(lp154
VMy own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student,
p155
aVsearching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba,
p156
aVants that shine in the sunlight \u2014
p157
aVmetallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold.
p158
aVI found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains
p159
aVwhere the last of the native Cuban forests hung on,
p160
aVand were then \u2014 and still are \u2014 being cut back.
p161
aVI realized then that these species
p162
aVand a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island \u2014
p163
aVand this is true of practically every part of the world \u2014
p164
aVwhich took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever.
p165
aVAnd so it is everywhere one looks.
p166
aa(lp167
VThe human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces
p168
aVthat can be summarized by the acronym "HIPPO," the animal hippo.
p169
aVH is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases.
p170
aVI is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses
p171
aVand pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate \u2014 that's the I.
p172
aVThe P, the first one in "HIPPO," is for pollution.
p173
aVThe second is for continued population, human population expansion.
p174
aVAnd the final letter is O, for over-harvesting \u2014
p175
aVdriving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing.
p176
aVThe HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined \u2014
p177
aVaccording to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research \u2014
p178
aVto reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species
p179
aVto extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century.
p180
aVHuman-forced climate change alone \u2014 again, if unabated \u2014
p181
aVcould eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades.
p182
aVWhat will we and all future generations lose
p183
aVif much of the living environment is thus degraded?
p184
aVHuge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered,
p185
aVmuch of our environmental stability
p186
aVand new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value \u2014
p187
aVall thrown away.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe loss will inflict a heavy price
p190
aVin wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come,
p191
aVbecause previous cataclysms of this kind \u2014
p192
aVthe last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs \u2014
p193
aVtook, normally, five to 10 million years to repair.
p194
aVSadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete
p195
aVthat we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered.
p196
aVFor example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently
p197
aVactually has been found to be only partial in coverage;
p198
aVit is mostly unknown to us in basic biology.
p199
aVOnly about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status.
p200
aVOf the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril,"
p201
aVthat is, in danger of extinction.
p202
aVThat's in the United States.
p203
aVWe are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.
p204
aVWe urgently need to change this.
p205
aVWe need to have the biosphere properly explored
p206
aVso that we can understand and competently manage it.
p207
aVWe need to settle down before we wreck the planet.
p208
aVAnd we need that knowledge.
p209
aa(lp210
VThis should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project.
p211
aVIt should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable.
p212
aVSo this brings me to my wish for TEDsters,
p213
aVand to anyone else around the world who hears this talk.
p214
aVI wish we will work together to help create the key tools
p215
aVthat we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity.
p216
aVAnd let us call it the "Encyclopedia of Life."
p217
aVWhat is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold
p218
aVand is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously?
p219
aVIt is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet
p220
aVand is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world.
p221
aVAmateurs can do it also.
p222
aVIt has an indefinitely expandable page for each species.
p223
aa(lp224
VIt makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone,
p225
aVon demand, anywhere in the world.
p226
aVI've written about this idea before,
p227
aVand I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past.
p228
aVBut what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form,
p229
aVscience has advanced.
p230
aVTechnology has moved forward.
p231
aVToday, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia,
p232
aVregardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach.
p233
aVIndeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions
p234
aVhave begun mobilizing to realize this dream.
p235
aVI wish you would help them.
p236
aVWorking together, we can make this real.
p237
aa(lp238
VThe encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications.
p239
aVIt will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.
p240
aVIt will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.
p241
aVAnd most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists
p242
aVto continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago:
p243
aVto search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.
p244
aVThat is my wish. Thank you.

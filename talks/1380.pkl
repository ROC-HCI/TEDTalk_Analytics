VWhat do I know
p5
aVthat would cause me,
p6
aVa reticent, Midwestern scientist,
p7
aVto get myself arrested
p8
aVin front of the White House protesting?
p9
aVAnd what would you do
p10
aVif you knew what I know?
p11
aVLet's start with how I got to this point.
p12
aVI was lucky to grow up
p13
aVat a time when it was not difficult
p14
aVfor the child of a tenant farmer
p15
aVto make his way to the state university.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I was really lucky
p18
aVto go to the University of Iowa
p19
aVwhere I could study under Professor James Van Allen
p20
aVwho built instruments
p21
aVfor the first U.S. satellites.
p22
aVProfessor Van Allen told me
p23
aVabout observations of Venus,
p24
aVthat there was intense microwave radiation.
p25
aVDid it mean that Venus had an ionosphere?
p26
aVOr was Venus extremely hot?
p27
aVThe right answer,
p28
aVconfirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft,
p29
aVwas that Venus was very hot \u2014
p30
aV900 degrees Fahrenheit.
p31
aVAnd it was kept hot
p32
aVby a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.
p33
aa(lp34
VI was fortunate to join NASA
p35
aVand successfully propose
p36
aVan experiment to fly to Venus.
p37
aVOur instrument took this image
p38
aVof the veil of Venus,
p39
aVwhich turned out to be
p40
aVa smog of sulfuric acid.
p41
aVBut while our instrument was being built,
p42
aVI became involved in calculations
p43
aVof the greenhouse effect
p44
aVhere on Earth,
p45
aVbecause we realized
p46
aVthat our atmospheric composition was changing.
p47
aVEventually, I resigned
p48
aVas principal investigator
p49
aVon our Venus experiment
p50
aVbecause a planet changing before our eyes
p51
aVis more interesting and important.
p52
aVIts changes will affect all of humanity.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe greenhouse effect had been well understood
p55
aVfor more than a century.
p56
aVBritish physicist John Tyndall,
p57
aVin the 1850's,
p58
aVmade laboratory measurements
p59
aVof the infrared radiation,
p60
aVwhich is heat.
p61
aVAnd he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat,
p62
aVthus acting like a blanket
p63
aVwarming Earth's surface.
p64
aa(lp65
VI worked with other scientists
p66
aVto analyze Earth climate observations.
p67
aVIn 1981,
p68
aVwe published an article in Science magazine
p69
aVconcluding that observed warming
p70
aVof 0.4 degrees Celsius
p71
aVin the prior century
p72
aVwas consistent with the greenhouse effect
p73
aVof increasing CO2.
p74
aVThat Earth would likely warm in the 1980's,
p75
aVand warming would exceed
p76
aVthe noise level of random weather
p77
aVby the end of the century.
p78
aVWe also said that the 21st century
p79
aVwould see shifting climate zones,
p80
aVcreation of drought-prone regions
p81
aVin North America and Asia,
p82
aVerosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels
p83
aVand opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.
p84
aVAll of these impacts
p85
aVhave since either happened
p86
aVor are now well under way.
p87
aa(lp88
VThat paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times
p89
aVand led to me testifying to Congress
p90
aVin the 1980's,
p91
aVtestimony in which I emphasized
p92
aVthat global warming increases both extremes
p93
aVof the Earth's water cycle.
p94
aVHeatwaves and droughts on one hand,
p95
aVdirectly from the warming,
p96
aVbut also, because a warmer atmosphere
p97
aVholds more water vapor
p98
aVwith its latent energy,
p99
aVrainfall will become
p100
aVin more extreme events.
p101
aVThere will be stronger storms and greater flooding.
p102
aVGlobal warming hoopla
p103
aVbecame time-consuming
p104
aVand distracted me from doing science \u2014
p105
aVpartly because I had complained
p106
aVthat the White House altered my testimony.
p107
aVSo I decided to go back
p108
aVto strictly doing science
p109
aVand leave the communication to others.
p110
aa(lp111
VBy 15 years later,
p112
aVevidence of global warming was much stronger.
p113
aVMost of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper
p114
aVwere facts.
p115
aVI had the privilege to speak twice
p116
aVto the president's climate task force.
p117
aVBut energy policies continued to focus
p118
aVon finding more fossil fuels.
p119
aVBy then we had two grandchildren,
p120
aVSophie and Connor.
p121
aVI decided
p122
aVthat I did not want them in the future
p123
aVto say, "Opa understood what was happening,
p124
aVbut he didn't make it clear."
p125
aVSo I decided to give a public talk
p126
aVcriticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy.
p127
aa(lp128
VI gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004
p129
aVand at the 2005 meeting
p130
aVof the American Geophysical Union.
p131
aVThis led to calls
p132
aVfrom the White House to NASA headquarters
p133
aVand I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media
p134
aVwithout prior explicit approval
p135
aVby NASA headquarters.
p136
aVAfter I informed the New York Times
p137
aVabout these restrictions,
p138
aVNASA was forced to end the censorship.
p139
aVBut there were consequences.
p140
aVI had been using the first line
p141
aVof the NASA mission statement,
p142
aV"To understand and protect the home planet,"
p143
aVto justify my talks.
p144
aVSoon the first line of the mission statement
p145
aVwas deleted, never to appear again.
p146
aa(lp147
VOver the next few years
p148
aVI was drawn more and more
p149
aVinto trying to communicate the urgency
p150
aVof a change in energy policies,
p151
aVwhile still researching the physics of climate change.
p152
aVLet me describe the most important conclusion from the physics \u2014
p153
aVfirst, from Earth's energy balance
p154
aVand, second, from Earth's climate history.
p155
aa(lp156
VAdding CO2 to the air
p157
aVis like throwing another blanket on the bed.
p158
aVIt reduces Earth's heat radiation to space,
p159
aVso there's a temporary energy imbalance.
p160
aVMore energy is coming in
p161
aVthan going out,
p162
aVuntil Earth warms up enough
p163
aVto again radiate to space
p164
aVas much energy as it absorbs from the Sun.
p165
aVSo the key quantity
p166
aVis Earth's energy imbalance.
p167
aVIs there more energy coming in
p168
aVthan going out?
p169
aVIf so, more warming is in the pipeline.
p170
aVIt will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow finally,
p173
aVwe can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely
p174
aVby measuring the heat content
p175
aVin Earth's heat reservoirs.
p176
aVThe biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured,
p177
aVuntil more than 3,000 Argo floats
p178
aVwere distributed around the world's ocean.
p179
aVThese floats reveal
p180
aVthat the upper half of the ocean
p181
aVis gaining heat at a substantial rate.
p182
aVThe deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate,
p183
aVand energy is going
p184
aVinto the net melting of ice all around the planet.
p185
aVAnd the land, to depths of tens of meters,
p186
aVis also warming.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe total energy imbalance now
p189
aVis about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.
p190
aVThat may not sound like much,
p191
aVbut when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.
p192
aVIt's about 20 times greater
p193
aVthan the rate of energy use by all of humanity.
p194
aVIt's equivalent to exploding
p195
aV400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day
p196
aV365 days per year.
p197
aVThat's how much extra energy
p198
aVEarth is gaining each day.
p199
aVThis imbalance,
p200
aVif we want to stabilize climate,
p201
aVmeans that we must reduce CO2
p202
aVfrom 391 ppm, parts per million,
p203
aVback to 350 ppm.
p204
aVThat is the change needed to restore energy balance
p205
aVand prevent further warming.
p206
aa(lp207
VClimate change deniers argue
p208
aVthat the Sun is the main cause of climate change.
p209
aVBut the measured energy imbalance occurred
p210
aVduring the deepest solar minimum in the record,
p211
aVwhen the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least.
p212
aVYet, there was more energy coming in than going out.
p213
aVThis shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate
p214
aVis overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses,
p215
aVmainly from burning fossil fuels.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow consider Earth's climate history.
p218
aVThese curves for global temperature,
p219
aVatmospheric CO2 and sea level
p220
aVwere derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores,
p221
aVfrom ocean sediments and snowflakes
p222
aVthat piled up year after year
p223
aVover 800,000 years
p224
aVforming a two-mile thick ice sheet.
p225
aVAs you see, there's a high correlation
p226
aVbetween temperature, CO2 and sea level.
p227
aVCareful examination shows
p228
aVthat the temperature changes
p229
aVslightly lead the CO2 changes
p230
aVby a few centuries.
p231
aVClimate change deniers like to use this fact
p232
aVto confuse and trick the public
p233
aVby saying, "Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change,
p234
aVnot vice versa."
p235
aVBut that lag
p236
aVis exactly what is expected.
p237
aa(lp238
VSmall changes in Earth's orbit
p239
aVthat occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years
p240
aValter the distribution
p241
aVof sunlight on Earth.
p242
aVWhen there is more sunlight
p243
aVat high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt.
p244
aVShrinking ice sheets
p245
aVmake the planet darker,
p246
aVso it absorbs more sunlight
p247
aVand becomes warmer.
p248
aVA warmer ocean releases CO2,
p249
aVjust as a warm Coca-Cola does.
p250
aVAnd more CO2 causes more warming.
p251
aVSo CO2, methane, and ice sheets
p252
aVwere feedbacks
p253
aVthat amplified global temperature change
p254
aVcausing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge,
p255
aVeven though the climate change was initiated
p256
aVby a very weak forcing.
p257
aa(lp258
VThe important point
p259
aVis that these same amplifying feedbacks
p260
aVwill occur today.
p261
aVThe physics does not change.
p262
aVAs Earth warms,
p263
aVnow because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere,
p264
aVice will melt,
p265
aVand CO2 and methane will be released
p266
aVby warming ocean and melting permafrost.
p267
aVWhile we can't say exactly how fast
p268
aVthese amplifying feedbacks will occur,
p269
aVit is certain they will occur,
p270
aVunless we stop the warming.
p271
aVThere is evidence
p272
aVthat feedbacks are already beginning.
p273
aVPrecise measurements
p274
aVby GRACE, the gravity satellite,
p275
aVreveal that both Greenland and Antarctica
p276
aVare now losing mass,
p277
aVseveral hundred cubic kilometers per year.
p278
aVAnd the rate has accelerated
p279
aVsince the measurements began
p280
aVnine years ago.
p281
aVMethane is also beginning
p282
aVto escape from the permafrost.
p283
aa(lp284
VWhat sea level rise
p285
aVcan we look forward to?
p286
aVThe last time CO2 was 390 ppm,
p287
aVtoday's value,
p288
aVsea level was higher
p289
aVby at least 15 meters, 50 feet.
p290
aVWhere you are sitting now
p291
aVwould be under water.
p292
aVMost estimates are that, this century,
p293
aVwe will get at least one meter.
p294
aVI think it will be more
p295
aVif we keep burning fossil fuels,
p296
aVperhaps even five meters, which is 18 feet,
p297
aVthis century or shortly thereafter.
p298
aa(lp299
VThe important point
p300
aVis that we will have started a process
p301
aVthat is out of humanity's control.
p302
aVIce sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries.
p303
aVThere would be no stable shoreline.
p304
aVThe economic consequences are almost unthinkable.
p305
aVHundreds of New Orleans-like devastations
p306
aVaround the world.
p307
aVWhat may be more reprehensible,
p308
aVif climate denial continues,
p309
aVis extermination of species.
p310
aVThe monarch butterfly
p311
aVcould be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species
p312
aVthat the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates
p313
aVwill be ticketed for extinction
p314
aVby the end of the century
p315
aVif we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use.
p316
aa(lp317
VGlobal warming is already affecting people.
p318
aVThe Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico
p319
aVheatwave and drought last year,
p320
aVMoscow the year before
p321
aVand Europe in 2003,
p322
aVwere all exceptional events,
p323
aVmore than three standard deviations outside the norm.
p324
aVFifty years ago,
p325
aVsuch anomalies
p326
aVcovered only two- to three-tenths
p327
aVof one percent of the land area.
p328
aVIn recent years,
p329
aVbecause of global warming,
p330
aVthey now cover about 10 percent \u2014
p331
aVan increase by a factor of 25 to 50.
p332
aVSo we can say with a high degree of confidence
p333
aVthat the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves
p334
aVwere not natural;
p335
aVthey were caused by global warming.
p336
aVAn important impact,
p337
aVif global warming continues,
p338
aVwill be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world,
p339
aVthe Midwest and Great Plains,
p340
aVwhich are expected to become prone to extreme droughts,
p341
aVworse than the Dust Bowl,
p342
aVwithin just a few decades,
p343
aVif we let global warming continue.
p344
aa(lp345
VHow did I get dragged deeper and deeper
p346
aVinto an attempt to communicate,
p347
aVgiving talks in 10 countries, getting arrested,
p348
aVburning up the vacation time
p349
aVthat I had accumulated over 30 years?
p350
aVMore grandchildren helped me along.
p351
aVJake is a super-positive,
p352
aVenthusiastic boy.
p353
aVHere at age two and a half years,
p354
aVhe thinks he can protect
p355
aVhis two and a half-day-old little sister.
p356
aVIt would be immoral
p357
aVto leave these young people
p358
aVwith a climate system
p359
aVspiraling out of control.
p360
aa(lp361
VNow the tragedy about climate change
p362
aVis that we can solve it
p363
aVwith a simple, honest approach
p364
aVof a gradually rising carbon fee
p365
aVcollected from fossil fuel companies
p366
aVand distributed 100 percent electronically
p367
aVevery month to all legal residents
p368
aVon a per capita basis,
p369
aVwith the government not keeping one dime.
p370
aVMost people would get more in the monthly dividend
p371
aVthan they'd pay in increased prices.
p372
aVThis fee and dividend
p373
aVwould stimulate the economy
p374
aVand innovations,
p375
aVcreating millions of jobs.
p376
aVIt is the principal requirement
p377
aVfor moving us rapidly
p378
aVto a clean energy future.
p379
aa(lp380
VSeveral top economists
p381
aVare coauthors on this proposition.
p382
aVJim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection
p383
aVdescribes it thusly:
p384
aV"Transparent. Market-based.
p385
aVDoes not enlarge government.
p386
aVLeaves energy decisions to individual choices.
p387
aVSounds like a conservative climate plan."
p388
aa(lp389
VBut instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions
p390
aVto make fossil fuels pay
p391
aVtheir true cost to society,
p392
aVour governments are forcing the public
p393
aVto subsidize fossil fuels
p394
aVby 400 to 500 billion dollars
p395
aVper year worldwide,
p396
aVthus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel \u2014
p397
aVmountaintop removal,
p398
aVlongwall mining, fracking,
p399
aVtar sands, tar shale,
p400
aVdeep ocean Arctic drilling.
p401
aVThis path, if continued,
p402
aVguarantees that we will pass tipping points
p403
aVleading to ice sheet disintegration
p404
aVthat will accelerate out of control of future generations.
p405
aVA large fraction of species
p406
aVwill be committed to extinction.
p407
aVAnd increasing intensity of droughts and floods
p408
aVwill severely impact breadbaskets of the world,
p409
aVcausing massive famines
p410
aVand economic decline.
p411
aVImagine a giant asteroid
p412
aVon a direct collision course with Earth.
p413
aa(lp414
VThat is the equivalent
p415
aVof what we face now.
p416
aVYet, we dither,
p417
aVtaking no action
p418
aVto divert the asteroid,
p419
aVeven though the longer we wait,
p420
aVthe more difficult and expensive it becomes.
p421
aVIf we had started in 2005,
p422
aVit would have required emission reductions of three percent per year
p423
aVto restore planetary energy balance
p424
aVand stabilize climate this century.
p425
aVIf we start next year,
p426
aVit is six percent per year.
p427
aVIf we wait 10 years, it is 15 percent per year \u2014
p428
aVextremely difficult and expensive,
p429
aVperhaps impossible.
p430
aVBut we aren't even starting.
p431
aa(lp432
VSo now you know what I know
p433
aVthat is moving me to sound this alarm.
p434
aVClearly, I haven't gotten this message across.
p435
aVThe science is clear.
p436
aVI need your help
p437
aVto communicate the gravity and the urgency
p438
aVof this situation
p439
aVand its solutions
p440
aVmore effectively.
p441
aVWe owe it to our children and grandchildren.
p442
aa(lp443

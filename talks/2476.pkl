VStrap yourselves in,
p5
aVwe're going to Mars.
p6
aa(lp7
VNot just a few astronauts \u2014
p8
aVthousands of people are going to colonize Mars.
p9
aVAnd I am telling you that they're going to do this soon.
p10
aVSome of you will end up working on projects on Mars,
p11
aVand I guarantee that some of your children will end up living there.
p12
aa(lp13
VThat probably sounds preposterous,
p14
aVso I'm going to share with you how and when that will happen.
p15
aVBut first I want to discuss the obvious question:
p16
aVWhy the heck should we do this?
p17
aa(lp18
V12 years ago,
p19
aVI gave a TED talk on 10 ways the world could end suddenly.
p20
aVWe are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy.
p21
aVA single, large asteroid could take us out forever.
p22
aVTo survive we have to reach beyond the home planet.
p23
aVThink what a tragedy it would be
p24
aVif all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd there's another reason we should go:
p27
aVexploration is in our DNA.
p28
aVTwo million years ago humans evolved in Africa
p29
aVand then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet
p30
aVby reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons.
p31
aVThis stuff is inside us.
p32
aVAnd they prospered doing that.
p33
aVSome of the greatest advances in civilization and technology
p34
aVcame because we explored.
p35
aa(lp36
VYes, we could do a lot of good
p37
aVwith the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars.
p38
aVAnd yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet.
p39
aVAnd yes, I worry we could screw up Mars the way we've screwed up Earth.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut think for a moment,
p42
aVwhat we had when John F. Kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon.
p43
aVHe excited an entire generation to dream.
p44
aVThink how inspired we will be to see a landing on Mars.
p45
aVPerhaps then we will look back at Earth
p46
aVand see that that is one people instead of many
p47
aVand perhaps then we will look back at Earth,
p48
aVas we struggle to survive on Mars,
p49
aVand realize how precious the home planet is.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're about to undertake.
p52
aVBut first,
p53
aVa few fascinating facts about where we're going.
p54
aVThis picture actually represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth.
p55
aVMars is not our sister planet.
p56
aVIt's far less than half the size of the Earth,
p57
aVand yet despite the fact that it's smaller,
p58
aVthe surface area of Mars that you can stand on
p59
aVis equivalent to the surface area of the Earth that you can stand on,
p60
aVbecause the Earth is mostly covered by water.
p61
aa(lp62
VThe atmosphere on Mars is really thin \u2014
p63
aV100 times thinner than on Earth \u2014
p64
aVand it's not breathable, it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.
p65
aa(lp66
VIt's really cold there.
p67
aVThe average temperature is minus 81 degrees,
p68
aValthough there is quite a range of temperature.
p69
aa(lp70
VA day on Mars is about as long as a day on Earth,
p71
aVplus about 39 minutes.
p72
aVSeasons and years on Mars are twice as long as they are on Earth.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day,
p75
aVMars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,
p76
aVand it's the kind of place
p77
aVwhere you can jump over your car instead of walk around it.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, as you can see, Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,
p80
aVbut it's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system.
p81
aa(lp82
VHere's the problem.
p83
aVMars is a long way away,
p84
aVa thousand times farther away from us than our own moon.
p85
aVThe Moon is 250,000 miles away
p86
aVand it took Apollo astronauts three days to get there.
p87
aVMars is 250 million miles away
p88
aVand it will take us eight months to get there \u2014
p89
aV240 days.
p90
aVAnd that's only if we launch on a very specific day,
p91
aVat a very specific time,
p92
aVonce every two years,
p93
aVwhen Mars and the Earth are aligned just so,
p94
aVso the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest.
p95
aV240 days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd meanwhile, our track record of getting to Mars is lousy.
p98
aVWe and the Russians, the Europeans, the Japanese,
p99
aVthe Chinese and the Indians,
p100
aVhave actually sent 44 rockets there,
p101
aVand the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed.
p102
aVOnly about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd we don't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway.
p105
aVWe once had that rocket, the Saturn V.
p106
aVA couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there.
p107
aVIt was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans,
p108
aVand it was the rocket that took us to the Moon.
p109
aVBut the last Saturn V was used in 1973 to launch the Skylab space station,
p110
aVand we decided to do something called the shuttle
p111
aVinstead of continuing on to Mars after we landed on the Moon.
p112
aVThe biggest rocket we have now
p113
aVis only half big enough to get us anything to Mars.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo getting to Mars is not going to be easy
p116
aVand that brings up a really interesting question ...
p117
aVhow soon will the first humans actually land here?
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, some pundits think if we got there by 2050,
p120
aVthat'd be a pretty good achievement.
p121
aa(lp122
VThese days, NASA seems to be saying that it can get humans to Mars by 2040.
p123
aVMaybe they can.
p124
aVI believe that they can get human beings into Mars orbit by 2035.
p125
aVBut frankly,
p126
aVI don't think they're going to bother in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,
p127
aVbecause we will already be there.
p128
aa(lp129
VWe're going to land on Mars in 2027.
p130
aVAnd the reason is
p131
aVthis man is determined to make that happen.
p132
aVHis name is Elon Musk, he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.
p133
aVNow, he actually told me that we would land on Mars by 2025,
p134
aVbut Elon Musk is more optimistic than I am \u2014
p135
aVand that's going a ways \u2014
p136
aVso I'm giving him a couple of years of slack.
p137
aVStill ...
p138
aVyou've got to ask yourself,
p139
aVcan this guy really do this by 2025 or 2027?
p140
aa(lp141
VWell, let's put a decade with Elon Musk into a little perspective.
p142
aVWhere was this 10 years ago?
p143
aVThat's the Tesla electric automobile.
p144
aVIn 2005, a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying,
p145
aVwe would not have a decent electric car for 50 years.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd where was that?
p148
aVThat is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,
p149
aVlifting six tons of supplies to the International Space Station.
p150
aV10 years ago,
p151
aVSpaceX had not launched anything, or fired a rocket to anywhere.
p152
aVSo I think it's a pretty good bet
p153
aVthat the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry
p154
aVin less than 10 years
p155
aVand the person who created an entire rocket company in less than 10 years
p156
aVwill get us to Mars by 2027.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, you need to know this:
p159
aVgovernments and robots no longer control this game.
p160
aVPrivate companies are leaping into space
p161
aVand they will be happy to take you to Mars.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd that raises a really big question.
p164
aVCan we actually live there?
p165
aVNow, NASA may not be able to get us there until 2040,
p166
aVor we may get there a long time before NASA,
p167
aVbut NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars.
p168
aa(lp169
VLet's look at the problem this way.
p170
aVHere's what you need to live on Earth:
p171
aVfood, water, shelter and clothing.
p172
aVAnd here's what you need to live on Mars:
p173
aVall of the above, plus oxygen.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo let's look at the most important thing on this list first.
p176
aVWater is the basis of all life as we know it,
p177
aVand it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live,
p178
aVso we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on Mars.
p179
aVAnd if you look at Mars, it looks really dry,
p180
aVit looks like the entire planet is a desert.
p181
aVBut it turns out that it's not.
p182
aVThe soil alone on Mars contains up to 60 percent water.
p183
aVAnd a number of orbiters that we still have flying around Mars have shown us \u2014
p184
aVand by the way, that's a real photograph \u2014
p185
aVthat lots of craters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them.
p186
aVIt's not a bad place to start a colony.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, here's a view of a little dig the Phoenix Lander did in 2008,
p189
aVshowing that just below the surface of the soil is ice \u2014
p190
aVthat white stuff is ice.
p191
aVIn the second picture,
p192
aVwhich is four days later than the first picture,
p193
aVyou can see that some of it is evaporating.
p194
aa(lp195
VOrbiters also tell us
p196
aVthat there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars
p197
aVas well as glaciers.
p198
aVIn fact, if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted,
p199
aVmost of the planet would be under 30 feet of water.
p200
aVSo there's plenty of water there,
p201
aVbut most of it's ice, most of it's underground,
p202
aVit takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor.
p203
aa(lp204
VThis is a device cooked up at the University of Washington
p205
aVback in 1998.
p206
aVIt's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.
p207
aVAnd it turns out the Mars atmosphere is often 100 percent humid.
p208
aVSo this device can extract all the water that humans will need
p209
aVsimply from the atmosphere on Mars.
p210
aa(lp211
VNext we have to worry about what we will breathe.
p212
aVFrankly, I was really shocked
p213
aVto find out that NASA has this problem worked out.
p214
aVThis is a scientist at MIT named Michael Hecht.
p215
aVAnd he's developed this machine, Moxie.
p216
aVI love this thing.
p217
aVIt's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,
p218
aVthat sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen.
p219
aVAnd you have to remember that CO2 \u2014
p220
aVcarbon dioxide, which is 96 percent of Mars' atmosphere \u2014
p221
aVCO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow, the next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in 2020
p224
aVis going to have one of these devices aboard,
p225
aVand it will be able to produce enough oxygen
p226
aVto keep one person alive indefinitely.
p227
aVBut the secret to this \u2014
p228
aVand that's just for testing \u2014
p229
aVthe secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get-go
p230
aVto be scalable by a factor of 100.
p231
aa(lp232
VNext, what will we eat?
p233
aVWell, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,
p234
aVbut we're not going to be able to grow
p235
aVmore than 15 to 20 percent of our food there,
p236
aVat least not until water is running on the surface of Mars
p237
aVand we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops.
p238
aVIn the meantime,
p239
aVmost of our food will arrive from Earth,
p240
aVand it will be dried.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd then we need some shelter.
p243
aVAt first we can use inflatable, pressurized buildings
p244
aVas well as the landers themselves.
p245
aVBut this really only works during the daytime.
p246
aVThere is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays.
p247
aVSo we really have to go underground.
p248
aa(lp249
VNow, it turns out that the soil on Mars,
p250
aVby and large, is perfect for making bricks.
p251
aVAnd NASA has figured this one out, too.
p252
aVThey're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks,
p253
aVshove them in a microwave oven,
p254
aVand then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls.
p255
aVOr we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes,
p256
aVof which there are plenty.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd finally there's clothing.
p259
aVOn Earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us,
p260
aVwhich creates 15 pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times,
p261
aVand we're constantly pushing out against that.
p262
aVOn Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure.
p263
aVSo Dava Newman,
p264
aVa scientist at MIT,
p265
aVhas created this sleek space suit.
p266
aVIt will keep us together,
p267
aVblock radiation and keep us warm.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo let's think about this for a minute.
p270
aVFood, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...
p271
aVwe can do this.
p272
aVWe really can.
p273
aVBut it's still a little complicated and a little difficult.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo that leads to the next big \u2014
p276
aVreally big step \u2014
p277
aVin living the good life on Mars.
p278
aVAnd that's terraforming the planet:
p279
aVmaking it more like Earth,
p280
aVreengineering an entire planet.
p281
aa(lp282
VThat sounds like a lot of hubris,
p283
aVbut the truth is
p284
aVthat the technology to do everything I'm about to tell you already exists.
p285
aa(lp286
VFirst we've got to warm it up.
p287
aVMars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere.
p288
aVThe answer lies here, at the south pole and at the north pole of Mars,
p289
aVboth of which are covered
p290
aVwith an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide \u2014
p291
aVdry ice.
p292
aVIf we heat it up,
p293
aVit sublimes directly into the atmosphere
p294
aVand thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd as we know,
p297
aVCO2 is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas.
p298
aVNow, my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very, very large solar sail
p299
aVand focus it \u2014
p300
aVit essentially serves as a mirror \u2014
p301
aVand focus it on the south pole of Mars at first.
p302
aVAs the planet spins, it will heat up all that dry ice, sublime it,
p303
aVand it will go into the atmosphere.
p304
aVIt actually won't take long
p305
aVfor the temperature on Mars to start rising,
p306
aVprobably less than 20 years.
p307
aa(lp308
VRight now,
p309
aVon a perfect day at the equator,
p310
aVin the middle of summer on Mars,
p311
aVtemperatures can actually reach 70 degrees,
p312
aVbut then they go down to minus 100 at night.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VWhat we're shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect:
p317
aVenough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on Mars \u2014
p318
aVespecially the ice in the ground \u2014 melt.
p319
aVThen we get some real magic.
p320
aa(lp321
VAs the atmosphere gets thicker, everything gets better.
p322
aVWe get more protection from radiation,
p323
aVmore atmosphere makes us warmer, makes the planet warmer,
p324
aVso we get running water
p325
aVand that makes crops possible.
p326
aVThen more water vapor goes into the air, forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.
p327
aVIt will rain and it will snow on Mars.
p328
aVAnd a thicker atmosphere will create enough pressure
p329
aVso that we can throw away those space suits.
p330
aVWe only need about five pounds of pressure to survive.
p331
aVEventually, Mars will be made to feel a lot like British Columbia.
p332
aa(lp333
VWe'll still be left with the complicated problem
p334
aVof making the atmosphere breathable,
p335
aVand frankly that could take 1,000 years to accomplish.
p336
aVBut humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable.
p337
aa(lp338
VThere is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish
p339
aVand no telling what we can do with our own bodies.
p340
aVIn biology right now,
p341
aVwe are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics,
p342
aVwhat the genes in our own bodies are doing,
p343
aVand certainly,
p344
aVeventually, our own evolution.
p345
aVWe could end up with a species of human being on Earth
p346
aVthat is slightly different from the species of human beings on Mars.
p347
aa(lp348
VBut what would you do there? How would you live?
p349
aVIt's going to be the same as it is on Earth.
p350
aVSomebody's going to start a restaurant,
p351
aVsomebody's going to build an iron foundry.
p352
aVSomeone will make documentary movies of Mars
p353
aVand sell them on Earth.
p354
aVSome idiot will start a reality TV show.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VThere will be software companies,
p359
aVthere will be hotels, there will be bars.
p360
aa(lp361
VThis much is certain:
p362
aVit will be the most disruptive event in our lifetimes,
p363
aVand I think it will be the most inspiring.
p364
aa(lp365
VAsk any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to Mars.
p366
aVChildren who are now in elementary school are going to choose to live there.
p367
aa(lp368
VRemember when we landed humans on the Moon?
p369
aVWhen that happened, people looked at each other and said,
p370
aV"If we can do this, we can do anything."
p371
aVWhat are they going to think when we actually form a colony on Mars?
p372
aa(lp373
VMost importantly,
p374
aVit will make us a spacefaring species.
p375
aVAnd that means humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth.
p376
aVWe will never be the last of our kind.
p377
aa(lp378
VThank you.
p379
aa(lp380

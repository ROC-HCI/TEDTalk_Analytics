VI'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions
p5
aVthat can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people,
p6
aVwhich we will hope to see happen.
p7
aVWe discussed, in the prior film, some of the old things that we did,
p8
aVlike stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic.
p9
aVAnd I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions
p10
aVthat will change the lives of many people.
p11
aa(lp12
VAt the present time, it takes an average of three hours
p13
aVafter the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient,
p14
aVbefore that patient arrives at an emergency room.
p15
aVAnd people with silent ischemia \u2014
p16
aVwhich, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms \u2014
p17
aVit takes even longer for them to get to the hospital.
p18
aVThe AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction,
p19
aVwhich is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money \u2014
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aV\u2014 means a heart attack. Annual incidence: 1.2 million Americans.
p22
aVMortality: 300,000 people dying each year.
p23
aVAbout half of them, 600,000, have permanent damage to their heart
p24
aVthat will cause them to have very bad problems later on.
p25
aVThus 900,000 people either have died
p26
aVor have significant damage to their heart muscle.
p27
aVSymptoms are often denied by the patient, particularly us men,
p28
aVbecause we are very brave. We are very brave,
p29
aVand we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain.
p30
aVThen, approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms.
p31
aVWhat are we going to do about them? How can we save their lives?
p32
aVIt's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women.
p33
aa(lp34
VWell, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack?
p35
aVA means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery.
p36
aVThat, ladies and gentlemen, is a heart attack.
p37
aVThe means consist of noting something a little technical,
p38
aVST segment elevation of the electrogram \u2014
p39
aVtranslated into English, that means that
p40
aVif there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG \u2014
p41
aVwhich we call the ST segment \u2014 elevates,
p42
aVthat is a sure sign of a heart attack.
p43
aVAnd if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk,
p44
aVwe could know, before they even have symptoms,
p45
aVthat they're having a heart attack, to save their life.
p46
aVWell, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage
p47
aVthat will trigger an emergency alarm,
p48
aVvibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.
p49
aVAnd when it goes beep, beep, beep, you better do something about it,
p50
aVbecause if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo we have to try these devices out
p53
aVbecause the FDA won't just let us use them on people
p54
aVunless we try it out first,
p55
aVand the best model for this happens to be pigs.
p56
aVAnd what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin,
p57
aVlike you see in an emergency room,
p58
aVand I'm going to show you why they don't work very well.
p59
aVAnd then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart,
p60
aVwhich does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart.
p61
aVWell, with the pig, at the baseline,
p62
aVbefore we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal.
p63
aVAfter 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference,
p64
aVand after three minutes \u2014 well,
p65
aVif you really studied it, you'd see a difference.
p66
aVBut what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?
p67
aa(lp68
VThere was the baseline \u2014 first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal.
p69
aVSecond of all, I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference,
p70
aVand we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line.
p71
aVLook at the difference there. It doesn't take much \u2014
p72
aVevery layperson could see that difference,
p73
aVand computers can be programmed to easily detect it.
p74
aVThen, look at that after three minutes.
p75
aVWe see that the signal that's actually in the heart,
p76
aVwe can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack
p77
aVeven before they have symptoms so we can save their life.
p78
aa(lp79
VThen we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell,
p80
aVwe tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.
p81
aVWell, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery,
p82
aVto simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is.
p83
aVAnd it's not hard to see that \u2014 the baseline
p84
aVis the first picture on the upper left.
p85
aVNext to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here,
p86
aVthen this rise \u2014 that's the ST elevation.
p87
aVAnd if we had a computer that could detect it,
p88
aVwe could tell you you're having a heart attack so early
p89
aVit could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure.
p90
aVAnd then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later
p91
aVand here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece,
p92
aVwhich we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker,
p93
aVwith a wire into your heart like a pacemaker.
p94
aVAnd computers don't go to sleep.
p95
aVWe have a little battery and on this little battery
p96
aVthat computer will run for five years without needing replacement.
p97
aa(lp98
VWhat does the system look like?
p99
aVWell, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device,
p100
aVand tonight in the tent you can see it \u2014 they've exhibited it.
p101
aVIt's about this big, the size of a pacemaker.
p102
aVIt's implanted with very conventional techniques.
p103
aVAnd the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.
p104
aVIt'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room
p105
aVwhen the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.
p106
aVAnd then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation,
p107
aVwhich is the level which says you are having a heart attack.
p108
aa(lp109
VThe FDA says, OK, test this final device after it's built in some animal,
p110
aVwhich we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack.
p111
aVAnd when you go to the farmyard, you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks,
p112
aVso we said, well, we're experts in stents.
p113
aVTonight you'll see some of our invented stents.
p114
aVWe said, so we'll put in a stent,
p115
aVbut we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people.
p116
aVWe're putting in a copper stent,
p117
aVand this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks.
p118
aVThat's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is.
p119
aVSo we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig,
p120
aVand let me show you the result that's very gratifying
p121
aVas far as people who have heart disease are concerned.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo there it was, Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication
p124
aVand there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heart
p125
aVcoming out by radio telemetry.
p126
aVThen, on Friday at 6:43, he began to get certain signs,
p127
aVwhich later we had the pig run around \u2014
p128
aVI'm not going to go into this early stage.
p129
aVBut look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medication
p130
aVthat kept him from having a heart attack.
p131
aVAny one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there?
p132
aVCan you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS \u2014 you see ST elevation?
p133
aVThis pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack.
p134
aVWhat happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage?
p135
aVYour rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later.
p136
aVThen, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats \u2014
p137
aVthis is just before death of the pig \u2014 and then the pig died; it went flat-line.
p138
aVBut we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life.
p139
aVWell, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life,
p140
aVbecause we need to do this type of animal research for humans.
p141
aVBut when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life.
p142
aVWe can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.
p143
aa(lp144
VWhat is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today?
p145
aVWell, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.
p146
aVIt's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.
p147
aVSeveral hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it.
p148
aVFinally, you go to the emergency room.
p149
aVYou wait as burns and other critical patients are treated,
p150
aVbecause 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains
p151
aVdon't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously.
p152
aVThey finally see you. It takes more time
p153
aVto get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it,
p154
aVand it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data,
p155
aVwhich the computer we put in you gets.
p156
aVFinally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident,
p157
aVbut the heart muscle has died.
p158
aVAnd that is the typical treatment in the advanced world \u2014 not Africa \u2014
p159
aVthat's the typical treatment in the advanced world today.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo we developed the AngelMed Guardian System
p162
aVand we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.
p163
aVAnd when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off
p164
aVand it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device,
p165
aVwhich gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago
p166
aVand the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room
p167
aVand show them, and say, take care of me right away.
p168
aVThen it goes to a network operations center,
p169
aVwhere they get your data from your patient database
p170
aVthat's been put in at some central location, say, in the United States.
p171
aVThen it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack,
p172
aVyour signal appears on the screen of a computer
p173
aVand the computer analyzes what your problem is.
p174
aVAnd the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you \u2014
p175
aVthis is also a cell phone \u2014 and says,
p176
aV"Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem.
p177
aVWe've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.
p178
aVIt'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.
p179
aVWe're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack,
p180
aVand we're going to send the signal to the hospital
p181
aVand we're going to have it analyzed there,
p182
aVand there you're going to be with your doctor
p183
aVand you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack."
p184
aVThat's the first invention that I wanted to describe.
p185
aV(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd now I want to talk about something entirely different.
p188
aVAt first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem
p189
aVbecause I'd never had a migraine headache,
p190
aVbut then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life,
p191
aVand their lives are being totally ruined by it.
p192
aVWe have a mission statement for our company doing migraine, which is,
p193
aV"Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches
p194
aVby the application of a safe, controlled magnetic pulse
p195
aVapplied, as needed, by the patient."
p196
aVNow, you're probably very few physicists here.
p197
aVIf you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law,
p198
aVwhich says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water \u2014
p199
aVthat's your brains by the way \u2014
p200
aVit'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain
p201
aVcan erase a migraine headache.
p202
aVThat's what we have discovered.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo here's a picture of what we're doing.
p205
aVThe patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura
p206
aVhave a band of excited neurons \u2014 that's shown in red \u2014
p207
aVthat moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.
p208
aVAnd when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.
p209
aVThere's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura,
p210
aVand this visual aura, by the way \u2014 and I'll show you a picture \u2014
p211
aVbut it sort of begins with little dancing lights,
p212
aVgets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field.
p213
aVAnd what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.
p214
aVWeighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter.
p215
aVAnd here's one of the patients who has an aura
p216
aVand always has a headache, bad one, after the aura. What do we do?
p217
aa(lp218
VThis is what an aura looks like.
p219
aVIt's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.
p220
aVAnd that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.
p221
aVIn the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said,
p222
aV"I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura."
p223
aVAnd, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture:
p224
aVhalf of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse.
p225
aVWhat does that mean?
p226
aVThat means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current
p227
aVthat's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.
p228
aVAnd finally he says, "OK, now I'm going to \u2014 "
p229
aVall of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.
p230
aa(lp231
VWhat is the result? We designed a magnetic depolarizer
p232
aVthat looks like this, that you could have \u2014 a lady, in her pocket book \u2014
p233
aVand when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works.
p234
aVWell, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News,
p235
aVChannel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnchor: For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches \u2014
p238
aVand there are 30 million Americans who do \u2014 tonight: a possible answer.
p239
aVEyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine
p240
aVthat literally zaps your migraines away.
p241
aVChristina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was \u2014
p242
aVlooked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange.
p243
aVStacy Sager: But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth trying
p244
aVif it could stop a migraine.
p245
aVIt may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse,
p246
aVbut researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper,
p247
aVsay it is scientifically sound \u2014
p248
aVthat, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine,
p249
aVit's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.
p250
aVThe zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.
p251
aVYousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity,
p252
aVrather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.
p253
aVSS: But is it safe to use everyday?
p254
aVExperts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade,
p255
aVand more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it.
p256
aVCS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine.
p257
aVSS: Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.
p258
aa(lp259
VRobert Fischell: And that is the invention to treat migraines.
p260
aV(Applause)
p261
aVYou see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches,
p262
aVand we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it.
p263
aVAnd this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish,
p264
aVwhich has something to do with this.
p265
aVOur conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers,
p266
aVis there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once.
p267
aVThe most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times,
p268
aVand the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches,
p269
aVnot only those with aura, get treated and get diminished.
p270
aVAnd auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur.
p271
aVAnd that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on.
p272
aV(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VThe third and last invention began with an idea.
p275
aVEpilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation.
p276
aVNow, why do we use \u2014 add on, nearly, an epileptic focus?
p277
aVNow, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono,
p278
aVhave to get into all these technical words.
p279
aVWell, "responsive electrical stimulation" means
p280
aVthat we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an "epileptic focus,"
p281
aVwhich is where the epileptic seizure begins \u2014
p282
aVwe sense there, that it's going to happen,
p283
aVand then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot,
p284
aVwhich erases the errant signal
p285
aVso that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache.
p286
aVWe use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.
p287
aVWe thought we could adapt it for the brain.
p288
aVThe device could be implanted under the scalp
p289
aVto be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage,
p290
aVwhich occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around.
p291
aVForm a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy,
p292
aVas well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brain
p293
aVare a result of some electrical malfunction in it,
p294
aVthat causes many, if not all, of brain disorders.
p295
aa(lp296
VWe formed a company called NeuroPace
p297
aVand we started work on responsive neurostimulation,
p298
aVand this is a picture of what the device looked like,
p299
aVthat's placed into the cranial bone.
p300
aVThis is probably a better picture.
p301
aVHere we have our device in which we put in a frame.
p302
aVThere's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template;
p303
aVhe marks it around, and uses a dental burr
p304
aVto remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device.
p305
aVAnd tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.
p306
aVAnd then with four screws, we put in a frame,
p307
aVthen we snap in the device and we run with wires \u2014
p308
aVthe one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes,
p309
aVto the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy,
p310
aVwhere we can sense the electrical signal
p311
aVand have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current
p312
aVto prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.
p313
aVIn the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode.
p314
aVIf that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.
p315
aa(lp316
VThe comprehensive solution: this is the device;
p317
aVit's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough,
p318
aVjust the thickness of most cranial bones.
p319
aVThe advantages of responsive neurostimulation:
p320
aVIt can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur,
p321
aVprovide stimulation only when needed,
p322
aVcan be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects \u2014
p323
aVas a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date,
p324
aVwe've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted \u2014
p325
aVand it's invisible, cosmetically hidden,
p326
aVso, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,
p327
aVno one will know it because you can't tell that it's there.
p328
aVAnd this shows what an electroencephalogram is,
p329
aVand on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients.
p330
aVThen we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line
p331
aVand then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal,
p332
aVwhich means they did not get the epileptic seizure.
p333
aVThat concludes my discussion of epilepsy,
p334
aVwhich is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon.
p335
aV(Applause)
p336
aa(lp337
VI have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa.
p338
aVI'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry,
p339
aVwhich is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.
p340
aVThe first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator,
p341
aVcalled RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator \u2014 that's a brilliant acronym \u2014
p342
aVfor the treatment of other brain disorders.
p343
aVWell, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?
p344
aVThen you saw what that device looked like,
p345
aVthat the woman was using to fix her migraines?
p346
aVI tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct,
p347
aVnot a real designer of good equipment.
p348
aV(Laughter)
p349
aVWe want to have some people, who really know how to do this,
p350
aVperform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design
p351
aVfor the portable device for treating migraine headaches.
p352
aVAnd some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.
p353
aVThen we're going to challenge the TED attendees
p354
aVto come up with a way to improve health care in the USA,
p355
aVwhere we have problems that Africa doesn't have.
p356
aVAnd by reducing malpractice litigation \u2014
p357
aVmalpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem.
p358
aV(Applause)
p359
aa(lp360
VSo, to get quickly to my first wish \u2014
p361
aVthe brain operates by electrical signals.
p362
aVIf the electrical signals create a brain disorder,
p363
aVelectro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.
p364
aVIn other words, if you've screwed up electrical signals,
p365
aVmaybe, by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain,
p366
aVwe can counteract that.
p367
aVA signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction
p368
aVmight be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation
p369
aVlike we're doing with epilepsy.
p370
aVBut even if there is no signal,
p371
aVelectro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder.
p372
aVAnd consider treating psychotic disorders \u2014
p373
aVand I want this involved with the TED group \u2014
p374
aVsuch as obsessive-compulsive disorder
p375
aVthat, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans.
p376
aVAnd Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believe
p377
aVthat we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world.
p378
aVThat is the first wish.
p379
aV(Applause)
p380
aa(lp381
VThe second wish is, at the present time,
p382
aVthe clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators \u2014
p383
aVthat's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches \u2014
p384
aVappears to be quite successful.
p385
aVWell, that's the good news.
p386
aVThe present portable device is far from optimally designed,
p387
aVboth as to human factors as appearance.
p388
aVI think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns.
p389
aV(Laughter)
p390
aVEngage a company having prior successes
p391
aVfor human factors engineering and industrial design
p392
aVto optimize the design of the first portable TMS device
p393
aVthat will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches.
p394
aVAnd that is the second wish.
p395
aV(Applause)
p396
aa(lp397
VAnd, of the 100,000-dollar prize money, that TED was so generous to give me,
p398
aVI am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people
p399
aVto get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
p400
aVand I'm making another 50,000 available for a company
p401
aVto optimize the design of the device for migraines.
p402
aVAnd that's how I'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money.
p403
aV(Applause)
p404
aa(lp405
VWell, the third and final wish is somewhat \u2014
p406
aVunfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers.
p407
aV(Laughter)
p408
aVWell, medical malpractice litigation in the US
p409
aVhas escalated the cost of malpractice insurance,
p410
aVso that competent physicians are leaving their practice.
p411
aVLawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share
p412
aVof a big settlement by a sympathetic jury, because this patient really ended up badly.
p413
aVThe high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs.
p414
aVI've seen pictures, graphs in today's USA Today
p415
aVshowing it skyrocketing out of control, and this is one factor.
p416
aVWell, how can the TED community help with this situation?
p417
aa(lp418
VI have a couple of ideas to begin with.
p419
aVAs a starting point for discussion with the TED group,
p420
aVa major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent
p421
aVof informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign.
p422
aVFor example, I asked the epilepsy people
p423
aVwhat are they using for informed consent.
p424
aVWould you believe, 12 pages, single space,
p425
aVthe patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy?
p426
aVWhat do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages?
p427
aVThey don't understand what the hell it's about.
p428
aV(Laughter)
p429
aVThat's the present system. How about making a video?
p430
aVWe have entertainment people here;
p431
aVwe have people who know how to do videos,
p432
aVwith visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation.
p433
aVEverybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing
p434
aVthat can be interactive with the patient, where they see the video
p435
aVand they're being videoed and they press, do you understand this? No, I don't.
p436
aVWell, then let's go to a simpler explanation.
p437
aVThen there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that.
p438
aVWell, press the button and you're on record, you understand.
p439
aVAnd that is one of the ideas.
p440
aa(lp441
VNow, also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter,
p442
aVwith the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done,
p443
aVincluding all the possible failure modes.
p444
aVThe patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit
p445
aVif one of the known procedure failures occurs.
p446
aVNow, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury.
p447
aVHowever, if a video is there that everything was explained to you,
p448
aVand you have it all in the video file,
p449
aVit'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer
p450
aVwill take this case on contingency, because it won't be nearly as good a case.
p451
aVIf a medical error occurs, the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement
p452
aVfor fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court.
p453
aVThat would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States
p454
aVand would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone.
p455
aa(lp456
VThese are just some starting points.
p457
aVAnd, so there, that's the end of all my wishes.
p458
aVI wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.
p459
aV(Applause)

VIt's the Second World War.
p5
aVA German prison camp.
p6
aVAnd this man,
p7
aVArchie Cochrane,
p8
aVis a prisoner of war and a doctor,
p9
aVand he has a problem.
p10
aVThe problem is that the men under his care
p11
aVare suffering
p12
aVfrom an excruciating and debilitating condition
p13
aVthat Archie doesn't really understand.
p14
aVThe symptoms
p15
aVare this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin.
p16
aVBut he doesn't know whether it's an infection, whether it's to do with malnutrition.
p17
aVHe doesn't know how to cure it.
p18
aVAnd he's operating in a hostile environment.
p19
aVAnd people do terrible things in wars.
p20
aVThe German camp guards, they've got bored.
p21
aVThey've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random
p22
aVfor fun.
p23
aVOn one particular occasion,
p24
aVone of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory
p25
aVwhile it was full of prisoners.
p26
aVHe said he heard suspicious laughter.
p27
aVAnd Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor,
p28
aVwas one of the first men in
p29
aVto clear up the mess.
p30
aVAnd one more thing:
p31
aVArchie was suffering from this illness himself.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo the situation seemed pretty desperate.
p34
aVBut Archie Cochrane
p35
aVwas a resourceful person.
p36
aVHe'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp,
p37
aVand now he managed
p38
aVto get hold of supplies of marmite
p39
aVon the black market.
p40
aVNow some of you will be wondering what marmite is.
p41
aVMarmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British.
p42
aVIt looks like crude oil.
p43
aVIt tastes ...
p44
aVzesty.
p45
aVAnd importantly,
p46
aVit's a rich source
p47
aVof vitamin B12.
p48
aVSo Archie splits the men under his care as best he can
p49
aVinto two equal groups.
p50
aVHe gives half of them vitamin C.
p51
aVHe gives half of them vitamin B12.
p52
aVHe very carefully and meticulously notes his results
p53
aVin an exercise book.
p54
aVAnd after just a few days,
p55
aVit becomes clear
p56
aVthat whatever is causing this illness,
p57
aVmarmite is the cure.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp.
p60
aVNow you've got to imagine at the moment \u2014
p61
aVforget this photo, imagine this guy
p62
aVwith this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair.
p63
aVHe hasn't been able to shave \u2014 a sort of Billy Connolly figure.
p64
aVCochrane, he starts ranting at these Germans
p65
aVin this Scottish accent \u2014
p66
aVin fluent German, by the way, but in a Scottish accent \u2014
p67
aVand explains to them how German culture was the culture
p68
aVthat gave Schiller and Goethe to the world.
p69
aVAnd he can't understand
p70
aVhow this barbarism can be tolerated,
p71
aVand he vents his frustrations.
p72
aVAnd then he goes back to his quarters,
p73
aVbreaks down and weeps
p74
aVbecause he's convinced that the situation is hopeless.
p75
aVBut a young German doctor
p76
aVpicks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book
p77
aVand says to his colleagues,
p78
aV"This evidence is incontrovertible.
p79
aVIf we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners,
p80
aVit's a war crime."
p81
aVAnd the next morning,
p82
aVsupplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp,
p83
aVand the prisoners begin to recover.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow I'm not telling you this story
p86
aVbecause I think Archie Cochrane is a dude,
p87
aValthough Archie Cochrane is a dude.
p88
aVI'm not even telling you the story
p89
aVbecause I think we should be running
p90
aVmore carefully controlled randomized trials
p91
aVin all aspects of public policy,
p92
aValthough I think that would also be completely awesome.
p93
aVI'm telling you this story
p94
aVbecause Archie Cochrane, all his life,
p95
aVfought against a terrible affliction,
p96
aVand he realized it was debilitating to individuals
p97
aVand it was corrosive to societies.
p98
aVAnd he had a name for it.
p99
aVHe called it the God complex.
p100
aVNow I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily.
p101
aVSo the symptoms of the complex
p102
aVare, no matter how complicated the problem,
p103
aVyou have an absolutely overwhelming belief
p104
aVthat you are infallibly right in your solution.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow Archie was a doctor,
p107
aVso he hung around with doctors a lot.
p108
aVAnd doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.
p109
aVNow I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor,
p110
aVbut I see the God complex around me all the time
p111
aVin my fellow economists.
p112
aVI see it in our business leaders.
p113
aVI see it in the politicians we vote for \u2014
p114
aVpeople who, in the face of an incredibly complicated world,
p115
aVare nevertheless absolutely convinced
p116
aVthat they understand the way that the world works.
p117
aVAnd you know, with the future billions that we've been hearing about,
p118
aVthe world is simply far too complex
p119
aVto understand in that way.
p120
aa(lp121
VWell let me give you an example.
p122
aVImagine for a moment
p123
aVthat, instead of Tim Harford in front of you,
p124
aVthere was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs.
p125
aVYou know Hans:
p126
aVthe Mick Jagger of TED.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVAnd he'd be showing you these amazing statistics,
p129
aVthese amazing animations.
p130
aVAnd they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.
p131
aVBut a typical Hans Rosling graph:
p132
aVthink for a moment, not what it shows,
p133
aVbut think instead about what it leaves out.
p134
aVSo it'll show you GDP per capita,
p135
aVpopulation, longevity,
p136
aVthat's about it.
p137
aVSo three pieces of data for each country \u2014
p138
aVthree pieces of data.
p139
aVThree pieces of data is nothing.
p140
aVI mean, have a look at this graph.
p141
aa(lp142
VThis is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo.
p143
aVHe's at MIT.
p144
aVNow you won't be able to understand a word of it,
p145
aVbut this is what it looks like.
p146
aVCesar has trolled the database
p147
aVof over 5,000 different products,
p148
aVand he's used techniques of network analysis
p149
aVto interrogate this database
p150
aVand to graph relationships between the different products.
p151
aVAnd it's wonderful, wonderful work.
p152
aVYou show all these interconnections, all these interrelations.
p153
aVAnd I think it'll be profoundly useful
p154
aVin understanding how it is that economies grow.
p155
aVBrilliant work.
p156
aVCesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine
p157
aVexplaining how this works.
p158
aVAnd what we learned
p159
aVis Cesar's work is far too good to explain
p160
aVin The New York Times Magazine.
p161
aa(lp162
VFive thousand products \u2014
p163
aVthat's still nothing.
p164
aVFive thousand products \u2014
p165
aVimagine counting every product category
p166
aVin Cesar Hidalgo's data.
p167
aVImagine you had one second
p168
aVper product category.
p169
aVIn about the length of this session,
p170
aVyou would have counted all 5,000.
p171
aVNow imagine doing the same thing
p172
aVfor every different type of product on sale in Walmart.
p173
aVThere are 100,000 there. It would take you all day.
p174
aVNow imagine trying to count
p175
aVevery different specific product and service
p176
aVon sale in a major economy
p177
aVsuch as Tokyo, London or New York.
p178
aVIt's even more difficult in Edinburgh
p179
aVbecause you have to count all the whisky and the tartan.
p180
aVIf you wanted to count every product and service
p181
aVon offer in New York \u2014
p182
aVthere are 10 billion of them \u2014
p183
aVit would take you 317 years.
p184
aVThis is how complex the economy we've created is.
p185
aVAnd I'm just counting toasters here.
p186
aVI'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem.
p187
aVThe complexity here is unbelievable.
p188
aVAnd just a piece of context \u2014
p189
aVthe societies in which our brains evolved
p190
aVhad about 300 products and services.
p191
aVYou could count them in five minutes.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us.
p194
aVThis perhaps is why
p195
aVwe find the God complex so tempting.
p196
aVWe tend to retreat and say, "We can draw a picture,
p197
aVwe can post some graphs,
p198
aVwe get it, we understand how this works."
p199
aVAnd we don't.
p200
aVWe never do.
p201
aVNow I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here.
p202
aVI'm not trying to say we can't solve
p203
aVcomplicated problems in a complicated world.
p204
aVWe clearly can.
p205
aVBut the way we solve them
p206
aVis with humility \u2014
p207
aVto abandon the God complex
p208
aVand to actually use a problem-solving technique that works.
p209
aVAnd we have a problem-solving technique that works.
p210
aVNow you show me
p211
aVa successful complex system,
p212
aVand I will show you a system
p213
aVthat has evolved through trial and error.
p214
aa(lp215
VHere's an example.
p216
aVThis baby was produced through trial and error.
p217
aVI realize that's an ambiguous statement.
p218
aVMaybe I should clarify it.
p219
aVThis baby is a human body: it evolved.
p220
aVWhat is evolution?
p221
aVOver millions of years, variation and selection,
p222
aVvariation and selection \u2014
p223
aVtrial and error,
p224
aVtrial and error.
p225
aVAnd it's not just biological systems
p226
aVthat produce miracles through trial and error.
p227
aVYou could use it in an industrial context.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo let's say you wanted to make detergent.
p230
aVLet's say you're Unilever
p231
aVand you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool.
p232
aVHow do you do it?
p233
aVWell you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent.
p234
aVYou pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle.
p235
aVYou create a spray of detergent.
p236
aVThen the spray dries. It turns into powder.
p237
aVIt falls to the floor.
p238
aVYou scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes.
p239
aVYou sell it at a supermarket.
p240
aVYou make lots of money.
p241
aVHow do you design that nozzle?
p242
aVIt turns out to be very important.
p243
aVNow if you ascribe to the God complex,
p244
aVwhat you do is you find yourself a little God.
p245
aVYou find yourself a mathematician; you find yourself a physicist \u2014
p246
aVsomebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid.
p247
aVAnd he will, or she will,
p248
aVcalculate the optimal design of the nozzle.
p249
aVNow Unilever did this and it didn't work \u2014
p250
aVtoo complicated.
p251
aVEven this problem, too complicated.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut the geneticist Professor Steve Jones
p254
aVdescribes how Unilever actually did solve this problem \u2014
p255
aVtrial and error,
p256
aVvariation and selection.
p257
aVYou take a nozzle
p258
aVand you create 10 random variations on the nozzle.
p259
aVYou try out all 10; you keep the one that works best.
p260
aVYou create 10 variations on that one.
p261
aVYou try out all 10. You keep the one that works best.
p262
aVYou try out 10 variations on that one.
p263
aVYou see how this works, right?
p264
aVAnd after 45 generations,
p265
aVyou have this incredible nozzle.
p266
aVIt looks a bit like a chess piece \u2014
p267
aVfunctions absolutely brilliantly.
p268
aVWe have no idea
p269
aVwhy it works,
p270
aVno idea at all.
p271
aVAnd the moment you step back from the God complex \u2014
p272
aVlet's just try to have a bunch of stuff;
p273
aVlet's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not \u2014
p274
aVyou can solve your problem.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow this process of trial and error
p277
aVis actually far more common in successful institutions
p278
aVthan we care to recognize.
p279
aVAnd we've heard a lot about how economies function.
p280
aVThe U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.
p281
aVHow did it become the world's greatest economy?
p282
aVI could give you all kinds of facts and figures
p283
aVabout the U.S. economy,
p284
aVbut I think the most salient one is this:
p285
aVten percent of American businesses
p286
aVdisappear every year.
p287
aVThat is a huge failure rate.
p288
aVIt's far higher than the failure rate of, say, Americans.
p289
aVTen percent of Americans don't disappear every year.
p290
aVWhich leads us to conclude
p291
aVAmerican businesses fail faster than Americans,
p292
aVand therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.
p293
aVAnd eventually, they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection
p294
aVthat they will make us all their pets \u2014
p295
aV(Laughter)
p296
aVif, of course, they haven't already done so.
p297
aVI sometimes wonder.
p298
aVBut it's this process of trial and error
p299
aVthat explains this great divergence,
p300
aVthis incredible performance of Western economies.
p301
aVIt didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge.
p302
aVIt's come through trial and error.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow I've been sort of banging on about this
p305
aVfor the last couple of months,
p306
aVand people sometimes say to me,
p307
aV"Well Tim, it's kind of obvious.
p308
aVObviously trial and error is very important.
p309
aVObviously experimentation is very important.
p310
aVNow why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?"
p311
aa(lp312
VSo I say, okay, fine.
p313
aVYou think it's obvious?
p314
aVI will admit it's obvious
p315
aVwhen schools
p316
aVstart teaching children
p317
aVthat there are some problems that don't have a correct answer.
p318
aVStop giving them lists of questions
p319
aVevery single one of which has an answer.
p320
aVAnd there's an authority figure in the corner
p321
aVbehind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers.
p322
aVAnd if you can't find the answers,
p323
aVyou must be lazy or stupid.
p324
aVWhen schools stop doing that all the time,
p325
aVI will admit that, yes,
p326
aVit's obvious that trial and error is a good thing.
p327
aVWhen a politician stands up
p328
aVcampaigning for elected office
p329
aVand says, "I want to fix our health system.
p330
aVI want to fix our education system.
p331
aVI have no idea how to do it.
p332
aVI have half a dozen ideas.
p333
aVWe're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail.
p334
aVThen we'll test some other ideas out.
p335
aVWe'll find some that work. We'll build on those.
p336
aVWe'll get rid of the ones that don't." \u2014
p337
aVwhen a politician campaigns on that platform,
p338
aVand more importantly, when voters like you and me
p339
aVare willing to vote for that kind of politician,
p340
aVthen I will admit
p341
aVthat it is obvious that trial and error works, and that \u2014 thank you.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VUntil then, until then
p346
aVI'm going to keep banging on about trial and error
p347
aVand why we should abandon the God complex.
p348
aVBecause it's so hard
p349
aVto admit our own fallibility.
p350
aVIt's so uncomfortable.
p351
aVAnd Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody.
p352
aVThere's this one trial he ran
p353
aVmany years after World War II.
p354
aVHe wanted to test out
p355
aVthe question of, where is it
p356
aVthat patients should recover
p357
aVfrom heart attacks?
p358
aVShould they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital,
p359
aVor should they recover at home?
p360
aVAll the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down.
p361
aVThey had the God complex in spades.
p362
aVThey knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients,
p363
aVand they knew it was very unethical
p364
aVto run any kind of trial or experiment.
p365
aa(lp366
VNevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this.
p367
aVHe ran his trial.
p368
aVAnd after the trial had been running for a little while,
p369
aVhe gathered together all his colleagues
p370
aVaround his table,
p371
aVand he said, "Well, gentlemen,
p372
aVwe have some preliminary results.
p373
aVThey're not statistically significant.
p374
aVBut we have something.
p375
aVAnd it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.
p376
aVIt is dangerous for patients
p377
aVto recover from heart attacks at home.
p378
aVThey should be in hospital."
p379
aVAnd there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table
p380
aVand saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.
p381
aVYou're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now.
p382
aVShut it down at once."
p383
aVAnd there's this huge hubbub.
p384
aVArchie lets it die down.
p385
aVAnd then he says, "Well that's very interesting, gentlemen,
p386
aVbecause when I gave you the table of results,
p387
aVI swapped the two columns around.
p388
aVIt turns out your hospitals are killing people,
p389
aVand they should be at home.
p390
aVWould you like to close down the trial now,
p391
aVor should we wait until we have robust results?"
p392
aVTumbleweed
p393
aVrolls through the meeting room.
p394
aa(lp395
VBut Cochrane would do that kind of thing.
p396
aVAnd the reason he would do that kind of thing
p397
aVis because he understood
p398
aVit feels so much better
p399
aVto stand there and say,
p400
aV"Here in my own little world,
p401
aVI am a god, I understand everything.
p402
aVI do not want to have my opinions challenged.
p403
aVI do not want to have my conclusions tested."
p404
aVIt feels so much more comfortable
p405
aVsimply to lay down the law.
p406
aVCochrane understood
p407
aVthat uncertainty, that fallibility,
p408
aVthat being challenged, they hurt.
p409
aVAnd you sometimes need to be shocked out of that.
p410
aVNow I'm not going to pretend that this is easy.
p411
aVIt isn't easy.
p412
aVIt's incredibly painful.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd since I started talking about this subject
p415
aVand researching this subject,
p416
aVI've been really haunted by something
p417
aVa Japanese mathematician said on the subject.
p418
aVSo shortly after the war,
p419
aVthis young man, Yutaka Taniyama,
p420
aVdeveloped this amazing conjecture
p421
aVcalled the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.
p422
aVIt turned out to be absolutely instrumental
p423
aVmany decades later
p424
aVin proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
p425
aVIn fact, it turns out it's equivalent
p426
aVto proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
p427
aVYou prove one, you prove the other.
p428
aVBut it was always a conjecture.
p429
aVTaniyama tried and tried and tried
p430
aVand he could never prove that it was true.
p431
aVAnd shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958,
p432
aVYutaka Taniyama killed himself.
p433
aVHis friend, Goro Shimura \u2014
p434
aVwho worked on the mathematics with him \u2014
p435
aVmany decades later, reflected on Taniyama's life.
p436
aVHe said,
p437
aV"He was not a very careful person
p438
aVas a mathematician.
p439
aVHe made a lot of mistakes.
p440
aVBut he made mistakes in a good direction.
p441
aVI tried to emulate him,
p442
aVbut I realized
p443
aVit is very difficult
p444
aVto make good mistakes."
p445
aa(lp446
VThank you.

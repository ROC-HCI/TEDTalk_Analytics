VI grew up to study the brain
p5
aVbecause I have a brother who has been diagnosed
p6
aVwith a brain disorder, schizophrenia.
p7
aVAnd as a sister and later, as a scientist,
p8
aVI wanted to understand, why is it that I can take my dreams,
p9
aVI can connect them to my reality,
p10
aVand I can make my dreams come true?
p11
aVWhat is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia
p12
aVthat he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality,
p13
aVso they instead become delusion?
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses.
p16
aVAnd I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston,
p17
aVwhere I was working in the lab of Dr. Francine Benes,
p18
aVin the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.
p19
aVAnd in the lab, we were asking the question,
p20
aV"What are the biological differences
p21
aVbetween the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control,
p22
aVas compared with the brains of individuals
p23
aVdiagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"
p24
aa(lp25
VSo we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain:
p26
aVwhich cells are communicating with which cells,
p27
aVwith which chemicals,
p28
aVand then in what quantities of those chemicals?
p29
aVSo there was a lot of meaning in my life
p30
aVbecause I was performing this type of research during the day,
p31
aVbut then in the evenings and on the weekends,
p32
aVI traveled as an advocate for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut on the morning of December 10, 1996,
p35
aVI woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own.
p36
aVA blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain.
p37
aVAnd in the course of four hours,
p38
aVI watched my brain completely deteriorate
p39
aVin its ability to process all information.
p40
aVOn the morning of the hemorrhage,
p41
aVI could not walk, talk, read, write or recall any of my life.
p42
aVI essentially became an infant in a woman's body.
p43
aa(lp44
VIf you've ever seen a human brain,
p45
aVit's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another.
p46
aVAnd I have brought for you a real human brain.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Groaning, laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VSo this is a real human brain.
p51
aVThis is the front of the brain,
p52
aVthe back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down,
p53
aVand this is how it would be positioned inside of my head.
p54
aVAnd when you look at the brain,
p55
aVit's obvious that the two cerebral cortices
p56
aVare completely separate from one another.
p57
aa(lp58
VFor those of you who understand computers,
p59
aVour right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor,
p60
aVwhile our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor.
p61
aVThe two hemispheres do communicate with one another
p62
aVthrough the corpus callosum,
p63
aVwhich is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers.
p64
aVBut other than that,
p65
aVthe two hemispheres are completely separate.
p66
aVBecause they process information differently,
p67
aVeach of our hemispheres think about different things,
p68
aVthey care about different things, and, dare I say,
p69
aVthey have very different personalities.
p70
aVExcuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.
p71
aa(lp72
VAssistant: It has been.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VOur right human hemisphere is all about this present moment.
p77
aVIt's all about "right here, right now."
p78
aVOur right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures
p79
aVand it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.
p80
aVInformation, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously
p81
aVthrough all of our sensory systems
p82
aVand then it explodes into this enormous collage
p83
aVof what this present moment looks like,
p84
aVwhat this present moment smells like and tastes like,
p85
aVwhat it feels like and what it sounds like.
p86
aVI am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me
p87
aVthrough the consciousness of my right hemisphere.
p88
aVWe are energy-beings connected to one another
p89
aVthrough the consciousness of our right hemispheres
p90
aVas one human family.
p91
aVAnd right here, right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet,
p92
aVhere to make the world a better place.
p93
aVAnd in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful.
p94
aa(lp95
VMy left hemisphere, our left hemisphere, is a very different place.
p96
aVOur left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.
p97
aVOur left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future.
p98
aVOur left hemisphere is designed to take
p99
aVthat enormous collage of the present moment
p100
aVand start picking out details, and more details about those details.
p101
aVIt then categorizes and organizes all that information,
p102
aVassociates it with everything in the past we've ever learned,
p103
aVand projects into the future all of our possibilities.
p104
aVAnd our left hemisphere thinks in language.
p105
aVIt's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world
p106
aVto my external world.
p107
aVIt's that little voice that says to me,
p108
aV"Hey, you've got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home.
p109
aVI need them in the morning."
p110
aVIt's that calculating intelligence
p111
aVthat reminds me when I have to do my laundry.
p112
aVBut perhaps most important, it's that little voice that says to me,
p113
aV"I am. I am."
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd as soon as my left hemisphere says to me "I am,"
p116
aVI become separate.
p117
aVI become a single solid individual,
p118
aVseparate from the energy flow around me
p119
aVand separate from you.
p120
aVAnd this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke.
p121
aa(lp122
VOn the morning of the stroke,
p123
aVI woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye.
p124
aVAnd it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream.
p125
aVAnd it just gripped me \u2014
p126
aVand then it released me.
p127
aVAnd then it just gripped me \u2014
p128
aVand then it released me.
p129
aVAnd it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain,
p130
aVso I thought, "OK, I'll just start my normal routine."
p131
aa(lp132
VSo I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider,
p133
aVwhich is a full-body, full-exercise machine.
p134
aVAnd I'm jamming away on this thing,
p135
aVand I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws
p136
aVgrasping onto the bar.
p137
aVAnd I thought, "That's very peculiar."
p138
aVAnd I looked down at my body
p139
aVand I thought, "Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing."
p140
aVAnd it was as though my consciousness had shifted away
p141
aVfrom my normal perception of reality,
p142
aVwhere I'm the person on the machine having the experience,
p143
aVto some esoteric space
p144
aVwhere I'm witnessing myself having this experience.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd it was all very peculiar, and my headache was just getting worse.
p147
aVSo I get off the machine,
p148
aVand I'm walking across my living room floor,
p149
aVand I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down.
p150
aVAnd every step is very rigid and very deliberate.
p151
aVThere's no fluidity to my pace,
p152
aVand there's this constriction in my area of perception,
p153
aVso I'm just focused on internal systems.
p154
aVAnd I'm standing in my bathroom
p155
aVgetting ready to step into the shower,
p156
aVand I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body.
p157
aVI heard a little voice saying, "OK. You muscles, you've got to contract.
p158
aVYou muscles, you relax."
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd then I lost my balance, and I'm propped up against the wall.
p161
aVAnd I look down at my arm
p162
aVand I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body.
p163
aVI can't define where I begin and where I end,
p164
aVbecause the atoms and the molecules of my arm
p165
aVblended with the atoms and molecules of the wall.
p166
aVAnd all I could detect was this energy \u2014 energy.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd I'm asking myself, "What is wrong with me?
p169
aVWhat is going on?"
p170
aVAnd in that moment, my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent.
p171
aVJust like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button.
p172
aVTotal silence.
p173
aVAnd at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind.
p174
aVBut then I was immediately captivated
p175
aVby the magnificence of the energy around me.
p176
aVAnd because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body,
p177
aVI felt enormous and expansive.
p178
aVI felt at one with all the energy that was,
p179
aVand it was beautiful there.
p180
aa(lp181
VThen all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online
p182
aVand it says to me, "Hey! We've got a problem!
p183
aVWe've got to get some help."
p184
aVAnd I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!"
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VSo it's like, "OK, I've got a problem."
p189
aVBut then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness \u2014
p190
aVand I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land.
p191
aVBut it was beautiful there.
p192
aVImagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected
p193
aVfrom your brain chatter that connects you to the external world.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo here I am in this space,
p196
aVand my job, and any stress related to my job \u2014 it was gone.
p197
aVAnd I felt lighter in my body.
p198
aVAnd imagine all of the relationships in the external world
p199
aVand any stressors related to any of those \u2014 they were gone.
p200
aVAnd I felt this sense of peacefulness.
p201
aVAnd imagine what it would feel like to lose
p202
aV37 years of emotional baggage!
p203
aV(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria \u2014
p204
aVeuphoria.
p205
aVIt was beautiful.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd again, my left hemisphere comes online and it says,
p208
aV"Hey! You've got to pay attention.
p209
aVWe've got to get help."
p210
aVAnd I'm thinking, "I've got to get help. I've got to focus."
p211
aVSo I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress
p212
aVand I'm walking around my apartment,
p213
aVand I'm thinking, "I've got to get to work. Can I drive?"
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd in that moment,
p216
aVmy right arm went totally paralyzed by my side.
p217
aVThen I realized, "Oh my gosh! I'm having a stroke!"
p218
aVAnd the next thing my brain says to me is,
p219
aVWow! This is so cool!
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VThis is so cool!
p224
aVHow many brain scientists have the opportunity
p225
aVto study their own brain from the inside out?"
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd then it crosses my mind, "But I'm a very busy woman!"
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
V"I don't have time for a stroke!"
p234
aVSo I'm like, "OK, I can't stop the stroke from happening,
p235
aVso I'll do this for a week or two, and then I'll get back to my routine. OK.
p236
aVSo I've got to call help. I've got to call work."
p237
aVI couldn't remember the number at work,
p238
aVso I remembered, in my office I had a business card with my number.
p239
aVSo I go into my business room, I pull out a three-inch stack of business cards.
p240
aVAnd I'm looking at the card on top
p241
aVand even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye
p242
aVwhat my business card looked like,
p243
aVI couldn't tell if this was my card or not,
p244
aVbecause all I could see were pixels.
p245
aVAnd the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background
p246
aVand the pixels of the symbols, and I just couldn't tell.
p247
aVAnd then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity.
p248
aVAnd in that moment, I would be able to reattach to normal reality
p249
aVand I could tell that's not the card... that's not the card.
p250
aVIt took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards.
p251
aVIn the meantime, for 45 minutes,
p252
aVthe hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere.
p253
aVI do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone,
p254
aVbut it's the only plan I have.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo I take the phone pad and I put it right here.
p257
aVI take the business card, I put it right here,
p258
aVand I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card
p259
aVto the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad.
p260
aVBut then I would drift back out into La La Land,
p261
aVand not remember when I came back if I'd already dialed those numbers.
p262
aVSo I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump
p263
aVand cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them,
p264
aVso that as I would come back to normal reality,
p265
aVI'd be able to tell, "Yes, I've already dialed that number."
p266
aa(lp267
VEventually, the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the phone,
p268
aVand my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me,
p269
aV"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd I think to myself,
p274
aV"Oh my gosh, he sounds like a Golden Retriever!"
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd so I say to him \u2014 clear in my mind, I say to him:
p279
aV"This is Jill! I need help!"
p280
aVAnd what comes out of my voice is, "Woo woo woo woo woo."
p281
aVI'm thinking, "Oh my gosh, I sound like a Golden Retriever."
p282
aVSo I couldn't know \u2014 I didn't know
p283
aVthat I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried.
p284
aVSo he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd a little while later, I am riding in an ambulance
p287
aVfrom one hospital across Boston to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.
p288
aVAnd I curl up into a little fetal ball.
p289
aVAnd just like a balloon with the last bit of air,
p290
aVjust right out of the balloon,
p291
aVI just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life.
p294
aVAnd either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life,
p295
aVor this was perhaps my moment of transition.
p296
aa(lp297
VWhen I woke later that afternoon,
p298
aVI was shocked to discover that I was still alive.
p299
aVWhen I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my life.
p300
aVAnd my mind was now suspended
p301
aVbetween two very opposite planes of reality.
p302
aVStimulation coming in through my sensory systems
p303
aVfelt like pure pain.
p304
aVLight burned my brain like wildfire,
p305
aVand sounds were so loud and chaotic
p306
aVthat I could not pick a voice out from the background noise,
p307
aVand I just wanted to escape.
p308
aVBecause I could not identify the position of my body in space,
p309
aVI felt enormous and expansive,
p310
aVlike a genie just liberated from her bottle.
p311
aVAnd my spirit soared free,
p312
aVlike a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria.
p313
aVNirvana.
p314
aVI found Nirvana.
p315
aVAnd I remember thinking,
p316
aVthere's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself
p317
aVback inside this tiny little body.
p318
aa(lp319
VBut then I realized, "But I'm still alive!
p320
aVI'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.
p321
aVAnd if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive,
p322
aVthen everyone who is alive can find Nirvana."
p323
aVAnd I pictured a world
p324
aVfilled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people
p325
aVwho knew that they could come to this space at any time.
p326
aVAnd that they could purposely choose
p327
aVto step to the right of their left hemispheres \u2014
p328
aVand find this peace.
p329
aVAnd then I realized
p330
aVwhat a tremendous gift this experience could be,
p331
aVwhat a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives.
p332
aVAnd it motivated me to recover.
p333
aa(lp334
VTwo and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the surgeons went in,
p335
aVand they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball
p336
aVthat was pushing on my language centers.
p337
aVHere I am with my mama,
p338
aVwho is a true angel in my life.
p339
aVIt took me eight years to completely recover.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo who are we?
p342
aVWe are the life-force power of the universe,
p343
aVwith manual dexterity and two cognitive minds.
p344
aVAnd we have the power to choose, moment by moment,
p345
aVwho and how we want to be in the world.
p346
aVRight here, right now,
p347
aVI can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are.
p348
aVI am the life-force power of the universe.
p349
aVI am the life-force power
p350
aVof the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form,
p351
aVat one with all that is.
p352
aVOr, I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere,
p353
aVwhere I become a single individual, a solid.
p354
aVSeparate from the flow, separate from you.
p355
aVI am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:
p356
aVintellectual, neuroanatomist.
p357
aVThese are the "we" inside of me.
p358
aVWhich would you choose?
p359
aVWhich do you choose?
p360
aVAnd when?
p361
aVI believe that the more time we spend
p362
aVchoosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry
p363
aVof our right hemispheres,
p364
aVthe more peace we will project into the world,
p365
aVand the more peaceful our planet will be.
p366
aVAnd I thought that was an idea worth spreading.
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you.
p369

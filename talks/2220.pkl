VI'm a potter,
p5
aVwhich seems like a fairly humble vocation.
p6
aVI know a lot about pots.
p7
aVI've spent about 15 years making them.
p8
aVOne of the things that really excites me in my artistic practice
p9
aVand being trained as a potter
p10
aVis that you very quickly learn how to make great things out of nothing;
p11
aVthat I spent a lot of time at my wheel with mounds of clay trying stuff;
p12
aVand that the limitations of my capacity, my ability,
p13
aVwas based on my hands and my imagination;
p14
aVthat if I wanted to make a really nice bowl
p15
aVand I didn't know how to make a foot yet,
p16
aVI would have to learn how to make a foot;
p17
aVthat that process of learning has been very, very helpful to my life.
p18
aVI feel like, as a potter,
p19
aVyou also start to learn how to shape the world.
p20
aa(lp21
VThere have been times in my artistic capacity
p22
aVthat I wanted to reflect
p23
aVon other really important moments
p24
aVin the history of the U.S., the history of the world
p25
aVwhere tough things happened,
p26
aVbut how do you talk about tough ideas
p27
aVwithout separating people from that content?
p28
aVCould I use art like these old, discontinued firehoses from Alabama,
p29
aVto talk about the complexities of a moment of civil rights in the '60s?
p30
aVIs it possible to talk about my father and I doing labor projects?
p31
aVMy dad was a roofer, construction guy, he owned small businesses,
p32
aVand at 80, he was ready to retire and his tar kettle was my inheritance.
p33
aVNow, a tar kettle doesn't sound like much of an inheritance. It wasn't.
p34
aVIt was stinky and it took up a lot of space in my studio,
p35
aVbut I asked my dad if he would be willing to make some art with me,
p36
aVif we could reimagine this kind of nothing material
p37
aVas something very special.
p38
aVAnd by elevating the material and my dad's skill,
p39
aVcould we start to think about tar just like clay, in a new way,
p40
aVshaping it differently, helping us to imagine what was possible?
p41
aa(lp42
VAfter clay, I was then kind of turned on to lots of different kinds of materials,
p43
aVand my studio grew a lot because I thought, well,
p44
aVit's not really about the material, it's about our capacity to shape things.
p45
aVI became more and more interested in ideas
p46
aVand more and more things that  were happening just outside my studio.
p47
aVJust to give you a little bit of context, I live in Chicago.
p48
aVI live on the South Side now. I'm a West Sider.
p49
aVFor those of you who are not Chicagoans, that won't mean anything,
p50
aVbut if I didn't mention that I was a West Sider,
p51
aVthere would be a lot of people in the city that would be very upset.
p52
aa(lp53
VThe neighborhood that I live in is Grand Crossing.
p54
aVIt's a neighborhood that has seen better days.
p55
aVIt is not a gated community by far.
p56
aVThere is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood,
p57
aVand while I was kind of busy making pots and busy making art
p58
aVand having a good art career,
p59
aVthere was all of this stuff that was happening
p60
aVjust outside my studio.
p61
aVAll of us know about failing housing markets
p62
aVand the challenges of blight,
p63
aVand I feel like we talk about it with some of our cities more than others,
p64
aVbut I think a lot of our U.S. cities and beyond
p65
aVhave the challenge of blight,
p66
aVabandoned buildings that people no longer know what to do anything with.
p67
aVAnd so I thought, is there a way that I could start to think
p68
aVabout these buildings as an extension or an expansion of my artistic practice?
p69
aVAnd that if I was thinking along with other creatives \u2014
p70
aVarchitects, engineers, real estate finance people \u2014
p71
aVthat us together might be able to kind of think
p72
aVin more complicated ways about the reshaping of cities.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd so I bought a building.
p75
aVThe building was really affordable.
p76
aVWe tricked it out.
p77
aVWe made it as beautiful as we could to try to just get some activity happening
p78
aVon my block.
p79
aVOnce I bought the building for about 18,000 dollars,
p80
aVI didn't have any money left.
p81
aVSo I started sweeping the building as a kind of performance.
p82
aVThis is performance art, and people would come over,
p83
aVand I would start sweeping.
p84
aVBecause the broom was free and sweeping was free.
p85
aVIt worked out.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVBut we would use the building, then, to stage exhibitions, small dinners,
p88
aVand we found that that building on my block, Dorchester \u2014
p89
aVwe now referred to the block as Dorchester projects \u2014
p90
aVthat in a way that building became a kind of gathering site
p91
aVfor lots of different kinds of activity.
p92
aVWe turned the building into what we called now the Archive House.
p93
aVThe Archive House would do all of these amazing things.
p94
aVVery significant people in the city and beyond
p95
aVwould find themselves in the middle of the hood.
p96
aVAnd that's when I felt like
p97
aVmaybe there was a relationship between my history with clay
p98
aVand this new thing that was starting to develop,
p99
aVthat we were slowly starting
p100
aVto reshape how people imagined the South Side of the city.
p101
aa(lp102
VOne house turned into a few houses,
p103
aVand we always tried to suggest
p104
aVthat not only is creating a beautiful vessel important,
p105
aVbut the contents of what happens in those buildings is also very important.
p106
aVSo we were not only thinking about development,
p107
aVbut we were thinking about the program,
p108
aVthinking about the kind of connections that could happen
p109
aVbetween one house and another, between one neighbor and another.
p110
aVThis building became what we call the Listening House,
p111
aVand it has a collection of discarded books
p112
aVfrom the Johnson Publishing Corporation,
p113
aVand other books from an old bookstore that was going out of business.
p114
aVI was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as I could
p115
aVwith whatever and whoever would join me.
p116
aa(lp117
VIn Chicago, there's amazing building stock.
p118
aVThis building, which had been the former crack house on the block,
p119
aVand when the building became abandoned,
p120
aVit became a great opportunity to really imagine what else could happen there.
p121
aVSo this space we converted into what we call Black Cinema House.
p122
aVBlack Cinema House was an opportunity in the hood to screen films
p123
aVthat were important and relevant to the folk who lived around me,
p124
aVthat if we wanted to show an old Melvin Van Peebles film, we could.
p125
aVIf we wanted to show "Car Wash," we could.
p126
aVThat would be awesome.
p127
aVThe building we soon outgrew,
p128
aVand we had to move to a larger space.
p129
aVBlack Cinema House, which was made from just a small piece of clay,
p130
aVhad to grow into a much larger piece of clay, which is now my studio.
p131
aa(lp132
VWhat I realized was that for those of you who are zoning junkies,
p133
aVthat some of the things that I was doing
p134
aVin these buildings that had been left behind,
p135
aVthey were not the uses by which the buildings were built,
p136
aVand that there are city policies that say,
p137
aV"Hey, a house that is residential needs to stay residential."
p138
aVBut what do you do in neighborhoods when ain't nobody interested in living there?
p139
aVThat the people who have the means to leave have already left?
p140
aVWhat do we do with these abandoned buildings?
p141
aVAnd so I was trying to wake them up using culture.
p142
aa(lp143
VWe found that that was so exciting for folk,
p144
aVand people were so responsive to the work, that we had to then find bigger buildings.
p145
aVBy the time we found bigger buildings,
p146
aVthere was, in part, the resources  necessary to think about those things.
p147
aVIn this bank that we called the Arts Bank, it was in pretty bad shape.
p148
aVThere was about six feet of standing water.
p149
aVIt was a difficult project to finance,
p150
aVbecause banks weren't interested in the neighborhood
p151
aVbecause people weren't interested in the neighborhood
p152
aVbecause nothing had happened there.
p153
aVIt was dirt. It was nothing. It was nowhere.
p154
aVAnd so we just started imagining, what else could happen in this building?
p155
aV(Applause)
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd so now that the rumor of my block has spread,
p158
aVand lots of people are starting to visit,
p159
aVwe've found that the bank can now be a center
p160
aVfor exhibition, archives, music performance,
p161
aVand that there are people who are now interested
p162
aVin being adjacent to those buildings because we brought some heat,
p163
aVthat we kind of made a fire.
p164
aa(lp165
VOne of the archives that we'll have there is this Johnson Publishing Corporation.
p166
aVWe've also started to collect memorabilia from American history,
p167
aVfrom people who live or have lived in that neighborhood.
p168
aVSome of these images are degraded images of black people,
p169
aVkind of histories of very challenging content,
p170
aVand where better than a neighborhood
p171
aVwith young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity
p172
aVto talk about some of the complexities
p173
aVof race and class?
p174
aa(lp175
VIn some ways, the bank represents a hub,
p176
aVthat we're trying to create a pretty  hardcore node of cultural activity,
p177
aVand that if we could start to make multiple hubs
p178
aVand connect some cool green stuff around there,
p179
aVthat the buildings that we've purchased and rehabbed,
p180
aVwhich is now around 60 or 70 units,
p181
aVthat if we could land miniature Versailles on top of that,
p182
aVand connect these buildings by a beautiful greenbelt \u2014
p183
aV(Applause) \u2014
p184
aVthat this place where people never wanted to be
p185
aVwould become an important destination
p186
aVfor folk from all over the country and world.
p187
aa(lp188
VIn some ways, it feels very much like I'm a potter,
p189
aVthat we tackle the things that are at our wheel,
p190
aVwe try with the skill that we have
p191
aVto think about this next bowl that I want to make.
p192
aVAnd it went from a bowl to a singular house to a block to a neighborhood
p193
aVto a cultural district to thinking about the city,
p194
aVand at every point, there were things that I didn't know that I had to learn.
p195
aVI've never learned so much about zoning law in my life.
p196
aVI never thought I'd have to.
p197
aVBut as a result of that, I'm finding that there's not just room
p198
aVfor my own artistic practice,
p199
aVthere's room for a lot of other artistic practices.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo people started asking us,
p202
aV"Well, Theaster, how are you going to go to scale?"
p203
aVand, "What's your sustainability plan?"
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd what I found was that I couldn't export myself,
p208
aVthat what seems necessary in cities like Akron, Ohio,
p209
aVand Detroit, Michigan, and Gary, Indiana,
p210
aVis that there are people in those places who already believe in those places,
p211
aVthat are already dying to make those places beautiful,
p212
aVand that often, those people who are passionate about a place
p213
aVare disconnected from the resources necessary to make cool things happen,
p214
aVor disconnected from a contingency of people
p215
aVthat could help make things happen.
p216
aVSo now, we're starting to give advice around the country
p217
aVon how to start with what you got,
p218
aVhow to start with the things that are in front of you,
p219
aVhow to make something out of nothing,
p220
aVhow to reshape your world at a wheel or at your block
p221
aVor at the scale of the city.
p222
aa(lp223
VThank you so much.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Applause)
p226
aa(lp227
VJune Cohen: Thank you. So I think many people watching this
p228
aVwill be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end:
p229
aVHow can they do this in their own city?
p230
aVYou can't export yourself.
p231
aVGive us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired
p232
aVabout their city can do to take on projects like yours?
p233
aa(lp234
VTheaster Gates: One of the things I've found that's really important
p235
aVis giving thought to not just the kind of individual project,
p236
aVlike an old house,
p237
aVbut what's the relationship between an old house,
p238
aVa local school, a small bodega,
p239
aVand is there some kind of synergy between those things?
p240
aVCan you get those folk talking?
p241
aVI've found that in cases where neighborhoods have failed,
p242
aVthey still often have a pulse.
p243
aVHow do you identify the pulse in that place, the passionate people,
p244
aVand then how do you get folk who have been fighting,
p245
aVslogging for 20 years, reenergized about the place that they live?
p246
aVAnd so someone has to do that work.
p247
aVIf I were a traditional developer, I would be talking about buildings alone,
p248
aVand then putting a "For Lease" sign in the window.
p249
aVI think that you actually have to curate more than that,
p250
aVthat there's a way in which you have to be mindful about,
p251
aVwhat are the businesses that I want to grow here?
p252
aVAnd then, are there people who live in this place
p253
aVwho want to grow those businesses with me?
p254
aVBecause I think it's not just a cultural space or housing;
p255
aVthere has to be the recreation of an economic core.
p256
aVSo thinking about those things together feels right.
p257
aa(lp258
VJC: It's hard to get people to create the spark again
p259
aVwhen people have been slogging for 20 years.
p260
aVAre there any methods you've found that have helped break through?
p261
aa(lp262
VTG: Yeah, I think that now there are lots of examples
p263
aVof folk who are doing amazing work,
p264
aVbut those methods are sometimes like, when the media is constantly saying
p265
aVthat only violent things happen in a place,
p266
aVthen based on your skill set and the particular context,
p267
aVwhat are the things that you can do in your neighborhood
p268
aVto kind of fight some of that?
p269
aVSo I've found that if you're a theater person,
p270
aVyou have outdoor street theater festivals.
p271
aVIn some cases, we don't have the resources in certain neighborhoods
p272
aVto do things that are a certain kind of splashy,
p273
aVbut if we can then find ways of making sure that people
p274
aVwho are local to a place,
p275
aVplus people who could be supportive of the things that are happening locally,
p276
aVwhen those people get together,
p277
aVI think really amazing things can happen.
p278
aa(lp279
VJC: So interesting.
p280
aVAnd how can you make sure that the projects you're creating
p281
aVare actually for the disadvantaged
p282
aVand not just for the sort of vegetarian indie movie crowd
p283
aVthat might move in to take advantage of them.
p284
aa(lp285
VTG: Right on. So I think this is where it starts to get into the thick weeds.
p286
aa(lp287
VJC: Let's go there. TG: Right now, Grand Crossing
p288
aVis 99 percent black, or at least living,
p289
aVand we know that maybe who owns property in a place
p290
aVis different from who walks the streets every day.
p291
aVSo it's reasonable to say that Grand Crossing is already
p292
aVin the process of being something different than it is today.
p293
aVBut are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts
p294
aVor a mission-based development
p295
aVthat starts to protect some of the space that happens,
p296
aVbecause when you have 7,500 empty lots in a city,
p297
aVyou want something to happen there,
p298
aVbut you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece,
p299
aVbut entities that are interested in the stabilization piece,
p300
aVand I feel like often the developer piece is really motivated,
p301
aVbut the other work of a kind of neighborhood consciousness,
p302
aVthat part doesn't live anymore.
p303
aVSo how do you start to grow up important watchdogs
p304
aVthat ensure that the resources that are made available
p305
aVto new folk that are coming in
p306
aVare also distributed to folk who have lived in a place for a long time.
p307
aa(lp308
VJC: That makes so much sense. One more question:
p309
aVYou make such a compelling case for beauty and the importance of beauty and the arts.
p310
aVThere would be others who would argue that funds would be better spent
p311
aVon basic services for the disadvantaged.
p312
aVHow do you combat that viewpoint, or come against it?
p313
aa(lp314
VTG: I believe that beauty  is a basic service.
p315
aV(Applause)
p316
aVOften what I have found is that when there are resources
p317
aVthat have not been made available to certain under-resourced cities
p318
aVor neighborhoods or communities,
p319
aVthat sometimes culture is the thing that helps to ignite,
p320
aVand that I can't do everything,
p321
aVbut I think that there's a way in which if you can start with culture
p322
aVand get people kind of reinvested in their place,
p323
aVother kinds of adjacent amenities start to grow,
p324
aVand then people can make a demand that's a poetic demand,
p325
aVand the political demands that are necessary to wake up our cities,
p326
aVthey also become very poetic.
p327
aa(lp328
VJC: It makes perfect sense to me.
p329
aVTheaster, thank you so much for being here with us today.
p330
aVThank you. Theaster Gates.

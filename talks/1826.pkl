VI'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on
p5
aVinvolving a man named Steve Titus.
p6
aa(lp7
VTitus was a restaurant manager.
p8
aVHe was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,
p9
aVhe was engaged to Gretchen,
p10
aVabout to be married, she was the love of his life.
p11
aVAnd one night, the couple went out
p12
aVfor a romantic restaurant meal.
p13
aVThey were on their way home,
p14
aVand they were pulled over by a police officer.
p15
aVYou see, Titus' car sort of resembled
p16
aVa car that was driven earlier in the evening
p17
aVby a man who raped a female hitchhiker,
p18
aVand Titus kind of resembled that rapist.
p19
aVSo the police took a picture of Titus,
p20
aVthey put it in a photo lineup,
p21
aVthey later showed it to the victim,
p22
aVand she pointed to Titus' photo.
p23
aVShe said, "That one's the closest."
p24
aVThe police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,
p25
aVand when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,
p26
aVthe rape victim got on the stand
p27
aVand said, "I'm absolutely positive that's the man."
p28
aVAnd Titus was convicted.
p29
aVHe proclaimed his innocence,
p30
aVhis family screamed at the jury,
p31
aVhis fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,
p32
aVand Titus is taken away to jail.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo what would you do at this point?
p35
aVWhat would you do?
p36
aVWell, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,
p37
aVand yet he got an idea.
p38
aVHe called up the local newspaper,
p39
aVhe got the interest of an investigative journalist,
p40
aVand that journalist actually found the real rapist,
p41
aVa man who ultimately confessed to this rape,
p42
aVa man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes
p43
aVin that area,
p44
aVand when this information was given to the judge,
p45
aVthe judge set Titus free.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd really, that's where this case should have ended.
p48
aVIt should have been over.
p49
aVTitus should have thought of this as a horrible year,
p50
aVa year of accusation and trial, but over.
p51
aa(lp52
VIt didn't end that way.
p53
aVTitus was so bitter.
p54
aVHe'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.
p55
aVHe lost his fiancée.
p56
aVShe couldn't put up with his persistent anger.
p57
aVHe lost his entire savings,
p58
aVand so he decided to file a lawsuit
p59
aVagainst the police and others whom he felt
p60
aVwere responsible for his suffering.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd that's when I really started working on this case,
p63
aVtrying to figure out
p64
aVhow did that victim go from
p65
aV"That one's the closest"
p66
aVto "I'm absolutely positive that's the guy."
p67
aa(lp68
VWell, Titus was consumed with his civil case.
p69
aVHe spent every waking moment thinking about it,
p70
aVand just days before he was to have his day in court,
p71
aVhe woke up in the morning,
p72
aVdoubled over in pain,
p73
aVand died of a stress-related heart attack.
p74
aVHe was 35 years old.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo I was asked to work on Titus' case
p77
aVbecause I'm a psychological scientist.
p78
aVI study memory. I've studied memory for decades.
p79
aVAnd if I meet somebody on an airplane \u2014
p80
aVthis happened on the way over to Scotland \u2014
p81
aVif I meet somebody on an airplane,
p82
aVand we ask each other, "What do you do? What do you do?"
p83
aVand I say "I study memory,"
p84
aVthey usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names,
p85
aVor they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's
p86
aVor some kind of memory problem,
p87
aVbut I have to tell them
p88
aVI don't study when people forget.
p89
aVI study the opposite: when they remember,
p90
aVwhen they remember things that didn't happen
p91
aVor remember things that were different
p92
aVfrom the way they really were.
p93
aVI study false memories.
p94
aa(lp95
VUnhappily, Steve Titus is not the only person
p96
aVto be convicted based on somebody's false memory.
p97
aVIn one project in the United States,
p98
aVinformation has been gathered
p99
aVon 300 innocent people,
p100
aV300 defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do.
p101
aVThey spent 10, 20, 30 years in prison for these crimes,
p102
aVand now DNA testing has proven
p103
aVthat they are actually innocent.
p104
aVAnd when those cases have been analyzed,
p105
aVthree quarters of them
p106
aVare due to faulty memory, faulty eyewitness memory.
p107
aa(lp108
VWell, why?
p109
aVLike the jurors who convicted those innocent people
p110
aVand the jurors who convicted Titus,
p111
aVmany people believe that memory
p112
aVworks like a recording device.
p113
aVYou just record the information,
p114
aVthen you call it up and play it back
p115
aVwhen you want to answer questions or identify images.
p116
aVBut decades of work in psychology
p117
aVhas shown that this just isn't true.
p118
aVOur memories are constructive.
p119
aVThey're reconstructive.
p120
aVMemory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page:
p121
aVYou can go in there and change it, but so can other people.
p122
aVI first started studying this constructive memory process
p123
aVin the 1970s.
p124
aVI did my experiments that involved showing people
p125
aVsimulated crimes and accidents
p126
aVand asking them questions about what they remember.
p127
aVIn one study, we showed people a simulated accident
p128
aVand we asked people,
p129
aVhow fast were the cars going when they hit each other?
p130
aVAnd we asked other people,
p131
aVhow fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?
p132
aVAnd if we asked the leading "smashed" question,
p133
aVthe witnesses told us the cars were going faster,
p134
aVand moreover, that leading "smashed" question
p135
aVcaused people to be more likely to tell us
p136
aVthat they saw broken glass in the accident scene
p137
aVwhen there wasn't any broken glass at all.
p138
aVIn another study, we showed a simulated accident
p139
aVwhere a car went through an intersection with a stop sign,
p140
aVand if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign,
p141
aVmany witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign
p142
aVat the intersection, not a stop sign.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd you might be thinking, well, you know,
p145
aVthese are filmed events,
p146
aVthey are not particularly stressful.
p147
aVWould the same kind of mistakes be made
p148
aVwith a really stressful event?
p149
aVIn a study we published just a few months ago,
p150
aVwe have an answer to this question,
p151
aVbecause what was unusual about this study
p152
aVis we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience.
p153
aVThe subjects in this study
p154
aVwere members of the U.S. military
p155
aVwho were undergoing a harrowing training exercise
p156
aVto teach them what it's going to be like for them
p157
aVif they are ever captured as prisoners of war.
p158
aVAnd as part of this training exercise,
p159
aVthese soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive,
p160
aVhostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes
p161
aVand later on they have to try to identify
p162
aVthe person who conducted that interrogation.
p163
aVAnd when we feed them suggestive information
p164
aVthat insinuates it's a different person,
p165
aVmany of them misidentify their interrogator,
p166
aVoften identifying someone who doesn't even remotely
p167
aVresemble the real interrogator.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd so what these studies are showing
p170
aVis that when you feed people misinformation
p171
aVabout some experience that they may have had,
p172
aVyou can distort or contaminate or change their memory.
p173
aa(lp174
VWell out there in the real world,
p175
aVmisinformation is everywhere.
p176
aVWe get misinformation
p177
aVnot only if we're questioned in a leading way,
p178
aVbut if we talk to other witnesses
p179
aVwho might consciously or inadvertently feed us
p180
aVsome erroneous information,
p181
aVor if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,
p182
aVall of these provide the opportunity
p183
aVfor this kind of contamination of our memory.
p184
aa(lp185
VIn the 1990s, we began to see
p186
aVan even more extreme kind of memory problem.
p187
aVSome patients were going into therapy with one problem \u2014
p188
aVmaybe they had depression, an eating disorder \u2014
p189
aVand they were coming out of therapy
p190
aVwith a different problem.
p191
aVExtreme memories for horrific brutalizations,
p192
aVsometimes in satanic rituals,
p193
aVsometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.
p194
aVOne woman came out of psychotherapy
p195
aVbelieving that she'd endured years
p196
aVof ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy
p197
aVand that the baby was cut from her belly.
p198
aVBut there were no physical scars
p199
aVor any kind of physical evidence
p200
aVthat could have supported her story.
p201
aVAnd when I began looking into these cases,
p202
aVI was wondering,
p203
aVwhere do these bizarre memories come from?
p204
aVAnd what I found is that most of these situations
p205
aVinvolved some particular form of psychotherapy.
p206
aVAnd so I asked,
p207
aVwere some of the things going on in this psychotherapy \u2014
p208
aVlike the imagination exercises
p209
aVor dream interpretation,
p210
aVor in some cases hypnosis,
p211
aVor in some cases exposure to false information \u2014
p212
aVwere these leading these patients
p213
aVto develop these very bizarre,
p214
aVunlikely memories?
p215
aVAnd I designed some experiments
p216
aVto try to study the processes that were being used
p217
aVin this psychotherapy so I could study
p218
aVthe development of these very rich false memories.
p219
aa(lp220
VIn one of the first studies we did,
p221
aVwe used suggestion,
p222
aVa method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,
p223
aVwe used this kind of suggestion
p224
aVand planted a false memory
p225
aVthat when you were a kid, five or six years old,
p226
aVyou were lost in a shopping mall.
p227
aVYou were frightened. You were crying.
p228
aVYou were ultimately rescued by an elderly person
p229
aVand reunited with the family.
p230
aVAnd we succeeded in planting this memory
p231
aVin the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.
p232
aVAnd you might be thinking, well,
p233
aVthat's not particularly stressful.
p234
aVBut we and other investigators have planted
p235
aVrich false memories of things that were
p236
aVmuch more unusual and much more stressful.
p237
aVSo in a study done in Tennessee,
p238
aVresearchers planted the false memory
p239
aVthat when you were a kid, you nearly drowned
p240
aVand had to be rescued by a life guard.
p241
aVAnd in a study done in Canada,
p242
aVresearchers planted the false memory
p243
aVthat when you were a kid,
p244
aVsomething as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal
p245
aVhappened to you,
p246
aVsucceeding with about half of their subjects.
p247
aVAnd in a study done in Italy,
p248
aVresearchers planted the false memory,
p249
aVwhen you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.
p250
aa(lp251
VI do want to add that it might seem
p252
aVlike we are traumatizing these experimental subjects
p253
aVin the name of science,
p254
aVbut our studies have gone through thorough evaluation
p255
aVby research ethics boards
p256
aVthat have made the decision
p257
aVthat the temporary discomfort that some
p258
aVof these subjects might experience in these studies
p259
aVis outweighed by the importance of this problem
p260
aVfor understanding memory processes
p261
aVand the abuse of memory that is going on
p262
aVin some places in the world.
p263
aa(lp264
VWell, to my surprise,
p265
aVwhen I published this work and began to speak out
p266
aVagainst this particular brand of psychotherapy,
p267
aVit created some pretty bad problems for me:
p268
aVhostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,
p269
aVwho felt under attack,
p270
aVand by the patients whom they had influenced.
p271
aVI had sometimes armed guards at speeches
p272
aVthat I was invited to give,
p273
aVpeople trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.
p274
aVBut probably the worst
p275
aVwas I suspected that a woman
p276
aVwas innocent of abuse
p277
aVthat was being claimed by her grown daughter.
p278
aVShe accused her mother of sexual abuse
p279
aVbased on a repressed memory.
p280
aVAnd this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story
p281
aVto be filmed and presented in public places.
p282
aVI was suspicious of this story,
p283
aVand so I started to investigate,
p284
aVand eventually found information that convinced me
p285
aVthat this mother was innocent.
p286
aVI published an exposé on the case,
p287
aVand a little while later, the accusing daughter
p288
aVfiled a lawsuit.
p289
aVEven though I'd never mentioned her name,
p290
aVshe sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.
p291
aVAnd I went through nearly five years
p292
aVof dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,
p293
aVbut finally, finally, it was over and I could really
p294
aVget back to my work.
p295
aVIn the process, however, I became part
p296
aVof a disturbing trend in America
p297
aVwhere scientists are being sued
p298
aVfor simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.
p299
aa(lp300
VWhen I got back to my work, I asked this question:
p301
aVif I plant a false memory in your mind,
p302
aVdoes it have repercussions?
p303
aVDoes it affect your later thoughts,
p304
aVyour later behaviors?
p305
aVOur first study planted a false memory
p306
aVthat you got sick as a child eating certain foods:
p307
aVhard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.
p308
aVAnd we found that once we planted this false memory,
p309
aVpeople didn't want to eat the foods as much
p310
aVat an outdoor picnic.
p311
aVThe false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.
p312
aVIf we planted a warm, fuzzy memory
p313
aVinvolving a healthy food like asparagus,
p314
aVwe could get people to want to eat asparagus more.
p315
aVAnd so what these studies are showing
p316
aVis that you can plant false memories
p317
aVand they have repercussions
p318
aVthat affect behavior long after the memories take hold.
p319
aa(lp320
VWell, along with this ability
p321
aVto plant memories and control behavior
p322
aVobviously come some important ethical issues,
p323
aVlike, when should we use this mind technology?
p324
aVAnd should we ever ban its use?
p325
aVTherapists can't ethically plant false memories
p326
aVin the mind of their patients
p327
aVeven if it would help the patient,
p328
aVbut there's nothing to stop a parent
p329
aVfrom trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.
p330
aVAnd when I suggested this publicly,
p331
aVit created an outcry again.
p332
aV"There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children."
p333
aa(lp334
VHello, Santa Claus. (Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VI mean, another way to think about this is,
p337
aVwhich would you rather have,
p338
aVa kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,
p339
aVall the things that go with it,
p340
aVor a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?
p341
aVI know what I would choose for a kid of mine.
p342
aa(lp343
VBut maybe my work has made me different from most people.
p344
aVMost people cherish their memories,
p345
aVknow that they represent their identity,
p346
aVwho they are, where they came from.
p347
aVAnd I appreciate that. I feel that way too.
p348
aVBut I know from my work
p349
aVhow much fiction is already in there.
p350
aVIf I've learned anything from these decades
p351
aVof working on these problems, it's this:
p352
aVjust because somebody tells you something
p353
aVand they say it with confidence,
p354
aVjust because they say it with lots of detail,
p355
aVjust because they express emotion when they say it,
p356
aVit doesn't mean that it really happened.
p357
aVWe can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.
p358
aVWe need independent corroboration.
p359
aVSuch a discovery has made me more tolerant
p360
aVof the everyday memory mistakes
p361
aVthat my friends and family members make.
p362
aVSuch a discovery might have saved Steve Titus,
p363
aVthe man whose whole future was snatched away
p364
aVby a false memory.
p365
aa(lp366
VBut meanwhile, we should all keep in mind,
p367
aVwe'd do well to,
p368
aVthat memory, like liberty,
p369
aVis a fragile thing.
p370
aVThank you. Thank you.
p371
aVThank you. (Applause)
p372
aVThanks very much. (Applause)

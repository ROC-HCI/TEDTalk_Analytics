VIn 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque
p5
aVin my hometown of Gabés, in the south of Tunisia,
p6
aVI never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city.
p7
aa(lp8
VAt the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown,
p9
aVand it happened that the minaret was built in '94.
p10
aVAnd for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey.
p11
aVWhen I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do,
p12
aVhe was like, "Thank God you finally came,"
p13
aVand he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody
p14
aVto do something on it.
p15
aVThe most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything \u2014
p16
aVneither a sketch, or what I was going to write.
p17
aa(lp18
VIn every work that I create, I write messages
p19
aVwith my style of calligraffiti \u2014 a mix of calligraphy and graffiti.
p20
aVI use quotes or poetry.
p21
aVFor the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message
p22
aVto be put on a mosque should come from the Quran,
p23
aVso I picked this verse:
p24
aV"Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female,
p25
aVand made you people and tribe, so you may know each other."
p26
aVIt was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance
p27
aVcoming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media.
p28
aa(lp29
VI was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting,
p30
aVand how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention
p31
aVfrom international press all around the world.
p32
aVFor the imam, it was not just the painting;
p33
aVit was really deeper than that.
p34
aVHe hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city,
p35
aVand attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia.
p36
aVThe universality of the message,
p37
aVthe political context of Tunisia at this time,
p38
aVand the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way
p39
aVwere not insignificant.
p40
aVIt reunited the community.
p41
aa(lp42
VBringing people, future generations,
p43
aVtogether through Arabic calligraphy
p44
aVis what I do.
p45
aVWriting messages is the essence of my artwork.
p46
aVWhat is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people
p47
aVreally need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing.
p48
aVYou don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece.
p49
aVI think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes.
p50
aVThere is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate.
p51
aVArabic script speaks to anyone, I believe;
p52
aVto you, to you, to you, to anybody,
p53
aVand then when you get the meaning,
p54
aVyou feel connected to it.
p55
aVI always make sure to write messages
p56
aVthat are relevant to the place where I'm painting,
p57
aVbut messages that have a universal dimension,
p58
aVso anybody around the world can connect to it.
p59
aa(lp60
VI was born and raised in France, in Paris,
p61
aVand I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18.
p62
aVToday I only write messages in Arabic.
p63
aVOne of the reasons this is so important to me,
p64
aVis because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world.
p65
aa(lp66
VIn Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem
p67
aVfrom Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa,
p68
aVwho was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela,
p69
aVand then I painted it on the rooftop.
p70
aVThe local community were really intrigued by what I was doing,
p71
aVbut as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy,
p72
aVthey thanked me, as they felt connected to the piece.
p73
aa(lp74
VIn South Africa, in Cape Town,
p75
aVthe local community of Philippi
p76
aVoffered me the only concrete wall of the slum.
p77
aVIt was a school, and I wrote on it
p78
aVa quote from Nelson Mandela,
p79
aVsaying, "[in Arabic],"
p80
aVwhich means, "It seems impossible until it's done."
p81
aVThen this guy came to me and said, "Man, why you don't write in English?"
p82
aVand I replied to him, "I would consider your concern legit if you asked me
p83
aVwhy I didn't write in Zulu."
p84
aa(lp85
VIn Paris, once, there was this event,
p86
aVand someone gave his wall to be painted.
p87
aVAnd when he saw I was painting in Arabic,
p88
aVhe got so mad \u2014 actually, hysterical \u2014 and he asked for the wall to be erased.
p89
aVI was mad and disappointed.
p90
aVBut a week later, the organizer of the event asked me to come back,
p91
aVand he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house.
p92
aVSo, this guy \u2014
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVlike, was forced to see it every day.
p95
aVAt the beginning, I was going to write, "[In Arabic],"
p96
aVwhich means, "In your face," but \u2014
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVI decided to be smarter and I wrote, "[In Arabic],"
p99
aVwhich means, "Open your heart."
p100
aa(lp101
VI'm really proud of my culture,
p102
aVand I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork.
p103
aVAnd I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know,
p104
aVwith the beauty of Arabic script.
p105
aVToday, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall.
p106
aVI don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken,
p107
aVas it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning,
p108
aVas you can enjoy any music from other countries.
p109
aVSome people see that as a rejection or a closed door,
p110
aVbut for me, it's more an invitation \u2014
p111
aVto my language, to my culture, and to my art.
p112
aa(lp113
VThank you.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)

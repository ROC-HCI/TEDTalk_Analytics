VThank you very much. Good evening.
p5
aa(lp6
VSome of you may have noticed that my last name is Nutt.
p7
aVAnd if you did, you are forgiven for wondering
p8
aVhow a Nutt managed to end up in a war zone.
p9
aVI actually was offered, right out of medical school, and accepted
p10
aVa volunteer contract to work with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia,
p11
aVthat was worth one dollar.
p12
aVAnd, you see, I had to be paid this dollar
p13
aVin the event that the UN needed to issue an evacuation order,
p14
aVso that I would be covered.
p15
aVI was, after all, heading into one of the world's most dangerous places.
p16
aVAnd by now, some of you may be asking yourselves,
p17
aVand I just want to reassure you,
p18
aVthat I did get half the money up front.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VBut you see, this is how, with 50 cents in my pocket,
p23
aVI ended up in Baidoa, Somalia.
p24
aVJournalists called it the "city of death."
p25
aVAnd they called it the city of death
p26
aVbecause 300,000 people had lost their lives there \u2014
p27
aV300,000 people,
p28
aVmostly as a result of war-related famine and disease.
p29
aa(lp30
VI was part of a team that was tasked with trying to figure out
p31
aVhow best to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe.
p32
aVIt was right on the heels of the Rwandan genocide,
p33
aVand aid money to the region was drying up.
p34
aVMany aid organizations, unfortunately,
p35
aVhad been forced to close their doors.
p36
aVAnd so the question that I was asked to specifically help answer,
p37
aVwhich is one that aid workers ask themselves in war zones the world over,
p38
aVis: What the hell do we do now?
p39
aVYou know, the security environment in Somalia at that moment in time \u2014
p40
aVand nothing has really changed too much \u2014
p41
aVcan best be described as "Mad Max" by way of "A Clockwork Orange."
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival,
p44
aVI went up to a feeding clinic.
p45
aVThere were dozens of women who were standing in line,
p46
aVand they were clutching their infants very close.
p47
aVAbout 20 minutes into this conversation I was having
p48
aVwith this one young woman,
p49
aVI leaned forward
p50
aVand tried to put my finger in the palm of her baby's hand.
p51
aVAnd when I did this,
p52
aVI discovered that her baby was already in rigor.
p53
aVShe was stiff,
p54
aVand her little, lifeless hand was curled into itself.
p55
aVShe had died hours before
p56
aVof malnutrition and dehydration.
p57
aVI later learned that as her baby was dying,
p58
aVthis young woman had been held for two days
p59
aVby some teenage boys who were armed with Kalashnikov rifles,
p60
aVand they were trying to shake her down for more money,
p61
aVmoney she very clearly did not have.
p62
aVAnd this is a scene that I have confronted
p63
aVin war zones the world over;
p64
aVplaces where kids, some as young as eight \u2014 they are this big \u2014
p65
aVand those kids, they have never been to school.
p66
aVBut they have fought and they have killed with automatic rifles.
p67
aa(lp68
VIs this just the way the world is?
p69
aVSome will you tell you that war is unavoidably human.
p70
aVAfter all, it is as old as existence itself.
p71
aVWe say never again, and yet it happens again and again and again.
p72
aVBut I will tell you that I have seen the absolute worst
p73
aVof what we as human beings are capable of doing to one another,
p74
aVand yet I still believe a different outcome is possible.
p75
aVDo you want to know why?
p76
aVBecause over 20 years of doing this work,
p77
aVgoing in and out of war zones around the world,
p78
aVI have come to understand
p79
aVthat there are aspects of this problem
p80
aVthat we, all of us, as people occupying this shared space,
p81
aVthat we can change \u2014
p82
aVnot through force or coercion or invasion,
p83
aVbut by simply looking at all of the options available to us
p84
aVand choosing the ones that favor peace at the expense of war,
p85
aVinstead of war at the expense of peace.
p86
aa(lp87
VHow so?
p88
aVWell, I want you to consider this:
p89
aVthere are at least 800 million small arms and light weapons
p90
aVin circulation in the world today.
p91
aVThe vast majority of civilians, like that young baby,
p92
aVwho are dying in war zones around the world,
p93
aVare dying at the hands of various armed groups
p94
aVwho rely on a near-infinite supply of cheap, easy and efficient weapons
p95
aVto rape, threaten, intimidate and brutalize those civilians
p96
aVat every turn.
p97
aVHow cheap?
p98
aVWell, in some parts of the world,
p99
aVyou can buy an AK-47 for as little as 10 dollars.
p100
aVIn many places in which I have worked,
p101
aVit is easier to get access to an automatic rifle
p102
aVthan it is to get access to clean drinking water.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd so now the important part:
p105
aVCan anything be done about this?
p106
aVTo answer that question,
p107
aVlet's take a look at this map of the world.
p108
aVAnd now, let's add in all of the countries that are currently at war,
p109
aVand the number of people who have either died
p110
aVor have been displaced as a result of that violence.
p111
aVIt is a staggering number \u2014
p112
aVmore than 40 million people.
p113
aVBut you will also notice something else about this map.
p114
aVYou will notice that most of those countries
p115
aVare in the Global South.
p116
aVNow, let's look at the countries
p117
aVthat are the world's top 20 exporters of small arms in the world.
p118
aVAnd what do we notice?
p119
aVWell, you see them in green.
p120
aVYou will notice that those are mostly countries in the Global North,
p121
aVprimarily Western countries.
p122
aVWhat does this tell us?
p123
aVThis tells us that most of the people who are dying in war
p124
aVare living in poor countries,
p125
aVand yet most of the people who are profiting from war
p126
aVare living in rich countries \u2014 people like you and me.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd then what if we go beyond small arms for a second.
p129
aVWhat if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world?
p130
aVWho does the biggest business?
p131
aVWell, roughly 80 percent of those weapons
p132
aVcome from none other than the five permanent members
p133
aVof the United Nations Security Council,
p134
aVplus Germany.
p135
aVIt's shocking, isn't it?
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, some of you might be saying at this moment in time,
p138
aV"Oh yeah, but OK, hang on a second there ... Nutt."
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VGrade school was spectacular for me.
p143
aVIt was, really, a wonderful experience.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VBut you might be saying to yourselves,
p148
aVYou know, all of these weapons in war zones \u2014 they're not a cause,
p149
aVbut an effect of the violence that plagues them
p150
aVeach and every single day.
p151
aVYou know, places like Iraq and Afghanistan,
p152
aVwhere they need these weapons to be able to maintain law and order,
p153
aVpromote peace and security, to combat terror groups \u2014
p154
aVsurely this is a good thing.
p155
aa(lp156
VLet's take a look at that assumption for just one moment,
p157
aVbecause you see there has been a boom in the small-arms trade
p158
aVsince the start of the War on Terror.
p159
aVIn fact, it is a business that has grown threefold
p160
aVover the past 15 years.
p161
aVAnd now let's compare that to the number of people
p162
aVwho have directly died in armed conflict around the world
p163
aVin that same period.
p164
aVWhat do you notice?
p165
aVWell, you notice that, in fact, that also goes up
p166
aVroughly three- to fourfold.
p167
aVThey basically go up and end at the same point.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, we can have a circular argument here
p170
aVabout whether this increase in fatalities is a response
p171
aVto the increase of small arms, or the other way around.
p172
aVBut here's what we should really take away from this.
p173
aVWhat we should take away from this
p174
aVis that this is a relationship worth scrutinizing,
p175
aVespecially when you consider that small arms that were shipped to Iraq
p176
aVfor use by the Iraqi Army,
p177
aVor to Syria for so-called moderate opposition fighters,
p178
aVthat those arms, many of them, are now in the hands of ISIS;
p179
aVor when you consider that arms that were shipped to Libya
p180
aVare now actively drifting across the Sahel,
p181
aVand ending up with groups like Boko Haram and al Qaeda
p182
aVand other militant groups.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd therein lies the problem.
p185
aVBecause, you see,
p186
aVsmall arms anywhere are a menace everywhere,
p187
aVbecause their first stop is rarely their last.
p188
aa(lp189
VSpending on war per person per year
p190
aVnow amounts to about 249 dollars \u2014
p191
aV249 dollars per person,
p192
aVwhich is roughly 12 times what we spend on foreign aid,
p193
aVmoney that is used to educate and vaccinate children
p194
aVand combat malnutrition in the Global South.
p195
aVBut we can shift that balance.
p196
aVHow do we do this?
p197
aVWell, it is essentially a problem of both supply and demand,
p198
aVso we can tackle it from both sides.
p199
aa(lp200
VOn the supply side,
p201
aVwe can push our governments
p202
aVto adopt international arms transparency mechanisms
p203
aVlike the Arms Trade Treaty,
p204
aVwhich makes it so that rich countries have to be more accountable
p205
aVfor where their arms are going
p206
aVand what their arms might be used for.
p207
aVHere in the United States,
p208
aVthe largest arms-exporting country in the world by far,
p209
aVPresident Obama has rightly signed the Arms Trade Treaty,
p210
aVbut none of it takes effect, it isn't binding,
p211
aVuntil it is approved and ratified by the Senate.
p212
aVThis is where we need to make our voices heard.
p213
aVYou know, the curbing of small arms \u2014
p214
aVit's not going to solve the problem of war.
p215
aVIncreased control mechanisms won't solve that problem.
p216
aVBut it's an important step in the right direction.
p217
aVAnd it's up to all of us who live in those rich countries
p218
aVto make change here.
p219
aa(lp220
VWhat about on the demand side?
p221
aVYou know, there are generations around the world
p222
aVwho are being lost to war.
p223
aVIt is possible to disrupt that cycle of violence
p224
aVwith investments in education, in strengthening the rule of law
p225
aVand in economic development, especially for women.
p226
aVI have personally seen
p227
aVjust how incredibly powerful those kinds of efforts can be
p228
aVaround the world.
p229
aa(lp230
VBut here's the thing:
p231
aVthey take time,
p232
aVwhich means for you as individuals, if you want to give,
p233
aVplease, by all means do it.
p234
aVBut know that how you give is just as important
p235
aVas how much you give.
p236
aVRegular contributions like monthly contributions
p237
aVare a far more effective way of giving,
p238
aVbecause they allow humanitarian organizations
p239
aVto properly plan and be invested over the long term,
p240
aVand to be present in the lives of families who have been affected by war,
p241
aVwars that many of us, frankly, all too quickly forget.
p242
aa(lp243
VWhen I first got on that plane for Somalia as a young doctor,
p244
aVI had no idea what it meant to live with war.
p245
aVBut I can tell you that I know what it means now.
p246
aVAnd I know what it means
p247
aVto lie in bed in the pitch-black night
p248
aVand listen to that haunting "pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!"
p249
aVof automatic gunfire,
p250
aVand wonder with absolute dread
p251
aVhow many minutes I have left until it will be right on top of me.
p252
aVI can tell you that it is a terrifying and agonizing fear,
p253
aVone that millions of people around the world are forced to confront
p254
aVeach and every single day,
p255
aVespecially children.
p256
aVOver the years of doing this work,
p257
aVunfortunately, war has killed far too many people close to me.
p258
aVAnd on at least a couple of occasions,
p259
aVwar has very nearly killed me as well.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut I firmly believe,
p262
aVwhich is why I get up and do what I do every single day,
p263
aVthat we can make different choices here.
p264
aVBecause you see, war is ours,
p265
aVas human beings.
p266
aVWe buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.
p267
aVWe are therefore not powerless to solve it.
p268
aVOn the contrary,
p269
aVwe are the only ones who can.
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you very much, and I want to wish you the greatest success.

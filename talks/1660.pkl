VSalaam alaikum.
p5
aVWelcome to Doha.
p6
aVI am in charge of making this country's food secure.
p7
aVThat is my job for the next two years,
p8
aVto design an entire master plan,
p9
aVand then for the next 10 years to implement it \u2014
p10
aVof course, with so many other people.
p11
aVBut first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story,
p12
aVabout the story of this country that you're all here in today.
p13
aVAnd of course, most of you have had three meals today,
p14
aVand probably will continue to have after this event.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s?
p17
aVWe were about 11,000 people living here.
p18
aVThere was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that.
p19
aVMost of the people who lived here
p20
aVeither lived in coastal villages, fishing,
p21
aVor were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water.
p22
aVNone of the glamour that you see today existed.
p23
aVNo cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh.
p24
aVIt wasn't that they couldn't develop cities.
p25
aVResources weren't there to develop them.
p26
aVAnd you can see that life expectancy was also short.
p27
aVMost people died around the age of 50.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo let's move to chapter two: the oil era.
p30
aV1939, that's when they discovered oil.
p31
aVBut unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially
p32
aVuntil after the Second World War.
p33
aVWhat did it do?
p34
aVIt changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.
p35
aVIt also made all those people who roamed around the desert \u2014
p36
aVlooking for water, looking for food,
p37
aVtrying to take care of their livestock \u2014 urbanize.
p38
aa(lp39
VYou might find this strange,
p40
aVbut in my family we have different accents.
p41
aVMy mother has an accent that is so different to my father,
p42
aVand we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country.
p43
aVThere are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.
p44
aVSomeone says, "How so? How could this happen?"
p45
aVBecause we lived scattered.
p46
aVWe couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources.
p47
aVAnd when the resources came, be it oil,
p48
aVwe started building these fancy technologies
p49
aVand bringing people together because we needed the concentration.
p50
aVPeople started to get to know each other.
p51
aVAnd we realized that there are some differences in accents.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo that is the chapter two: the oil era.
p54
aVLet's look at today.
p55
aVThis is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha.
p56
aVSo what's the population today?
p57
aVIt's 1.7 million people.
p58
aVThat is in less than 60 years.
p59
aVThe average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years.
p60
aVLifespan has increased to 78.
p61
aVWater consumption has increased to 430 liters.
p62
aVAnd this is amongst the highest worldwide.
p63
aVFrom having no water whatsoever
p64
aVto consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation.
p65
aVI don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut what is interesting about the story that I've just said?
p68
aVThe interesting part is that we continue to grow
p69
aV15 percent every year for the past five years without water.
p70
aVNow that is historic. It's never happened before in history.
p71
aVCities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water.
p72
aVThis is history being made in this region.
p73
aVNot only cities that we're building,
p74
aVbut cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors.
p75
aVBuild a nice home, bring the architect, design my house.
p76
aVThese people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't.
p77
aVBut of course, with the use of technology.
p78
aVSo Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain.
p79
aVQatar has 74, and we have that growth rate.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe question is how.
p82
aVHow could we survive that?
p83
aVWe have no water whatsoever.
p84
aVSimply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.
p85
aVEnergy is the key factor here. It changed everything.
p86
aVIt is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of,
p87
aVprobably most of you used it coming to Doha.
p88
aVSo that is our lake, if you can see it.
p89
aVThat is our river.
p90
aVThat is how you all happen to use and enjoy water.
p91
aVThis is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo what are the risks?
p94
aVDo you worry much?
p95
aVI would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts,
p96
aVyou will realize, of course I have to worry.
p97
aVThere is growing demand, growing population.
p98
aVWe've turned seven billion only a few months ago.
p99
aVAnd so that number also demands food.
p100
aVAnd there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo a country that has no water
p103
aVhas to worry about what happens beyond its borders.
p104
aVThere's also changing diets.
p105
aVBy elevating to a higher socio-economic level,
p106
aVthey also change their diet.
p107
aVThey start eating more meat and so on and so forth.
p108
aVOn the other hand, there is declining yields
p109
aVbecause of climate change and because of other factors.
p110
aVAnd so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen.
p111
aa(lp112
VThis is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know.
p113
aVWe only have two days of water reserve.
p114
aVWe import 90 percent of our food,
p115
aVand we only cultivate less than one percent of our land.
p116
aVThe limited number of farmers that we have
p117
aVhave been pushed out of their farming practices
p118
aVas a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc.
p119
aVSo we also face risks.
p120
aVThese risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe question is, is there a solution?
p123
aVIs there a sustainable solution?
p124
aVIndeed there is.
p125
aVThis slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents
p126
aVthat we've been working on over the past two years.
p127
aVLet's start with the water.
p128
aVSo we know very well \u2014 I showed you earlier \u2014 that we need this energy.
p129
aVSo if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?
p130
aVA depletable energy? Fossil fuel?
p131
aVOr should we use something else?
p132
aVDo we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy?
p133
aVI guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun.
p134
aVAnd so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need.
p135
aVAnd we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems
p136
aVto produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water.
p137
aVAnd that is a lot of water.
p138
aa(lp139
VThat water will go then to the farmers,
p140
aVand the farmers will be able to water their plants,
p141
aVand they will be able then to supply society with food.
p142
aVBut in order to sustain the horizontal line \u2014
p143
aVbecause these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver \u2014
p144
aVwe need to also develop the vertical line:
p145
aVsystem sustenance, high-level education, research and development,
p146
aVindustries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets.
p147
aVBut what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations.
p148
aVWithout it we can't do anything.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo that's what we are planning to do.
p151
aVWithin two years we should hopefully be done with this plan
p152
aVand taking it to implementation.
p153
aVOur objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around:
p154
aVIstanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo.
p155
aVWe are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever
p156
aVas a city, to live in peace.
p157
aa(lp158
VThank you very much.

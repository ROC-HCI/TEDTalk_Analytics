VI'm going to talk today
p5
aVabout the pleasures of everyday life.
p6
aVBut I want to begin with a story
p7
aVof an unusual and terrible man.
p8
aVThis is Hermann Goering.
p9
aVGoering was Hitler's second in command in World War II,
p10
aVhis designated successor.
p11
aVAnd like Hitler,
p12
aVGoering fancied himself a collector of art.
p13
aVHe went through Europe, through World War II,
p14
aVstealing, extorting and occasionally buying
p15
aVvarious paintings for his collection.
p16
aVAnd what he really wanted was something by Vermeer.
p17
aVHitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.
p18
aVSo he finally found an art dealer,
p19
aVa Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren,
p20
aVwho sold him a wonderful Vermeer
p21
aVfor the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars.
p22
aVAnd it was his favorite artwork ever.
p23
aa(lp24
VWorld War II came to an end,
p25
aVand Goering was captured, tried at Nuremberg
p26
aVand ultimately sentenced to death.
p27
aVThen the Allied forces went through his collections
p28
aVand found the paintings
p29
aVand went after the people who sold it to him.
p30
aVAnd at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam
p31
aVand arrested Van Meegeren.
p32
aVVan Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason,
p33
aVwhich is itself punishable by death.
p34
aVSix weeks into his prison sentence,
p35
aVvan Meegeren confessed.
p36
aVBut he didn't confess to treason.
p37
aVHe said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece
p38
aVto that Nazi.
p39
aVI painted it myself; I'm a forger."
p40
aVNow nobody believed him.
p41
aVAnd he said, "I'll prove it.
p42
aVBring me a canvas and some paint,
p43
aVand I will paint a Vermeer much better
p44
aVthan I sold that disgusting Nazi.
p45
aVI also need alcohol and morphine, because it's the only way I can work."
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVSo they brought him in.
p48
aVHe painted a beautiful Vermeer.
p49
aVAnd then the charges of treason were dropped.
p50
aVHe had a lesser charge of forgery,
p51
aVgot a year sentence
p52
aVand died a hero to the Dutch people.
p53
aVThere's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren,
p54
aVbut I want to turn now to Goering,
p55
aVwho's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow Goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man.
p58
aVEven for a Nazi, he was a terrible man.
p59
aVHis American interrogators described him
p60
aVas an amicable psychopath.
p61
aVBut you could feel sympathy
p62
aVfor the reaction he had
p63
aVwhen he was told that his favorite painting
p64
aVwas actually a forgery.
p65
aVAccording to his biographer,
p66
aV"He looked as if for the first time
p67
aVhe had discovered there was evil in the world."
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVAnd he killed himself soon afterwards.
p70
aVHe had discovered after all
p71
aVthat the painting he thought was this
p72
aVwas actually that.
p73
aVIt looked the same,
p74
aVbut it had a different origin, it was a different artwork.
p75
aa(lp76
VIt wasn't just him who was in for a shock.
p77
aVOnce van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking.
p78
aVAnd he boasted about all the great masterpieces
p79
aVthat he himself had painted
p80
aVthat were attributed to other artists.
p81
aVIn particular, "The Supper at Emmaus"
p82
aVwhich was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece, his best work \u2014
p83
aVpeople would come [from] all over the world to see it \u2014
p84
aVwas actually a forgery.
p85
aVIt was not that painting, but that painting.
p86
aVAnd when that was discovered,
p87
aVit lost all its value and was taken away from the museum.
p88
aa(lp89
VWhy does this matter?
p90
aVI'm a psychologists \u2014 why do origins matter so much?
p91
aVWhy do we respond so much
p92
aVto our knowledge of where something comes from?
p93
aVWell there's an answer that many people would give.
p94
aVMany sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe
p95
aVwould argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously
p96
aVis because we're snobs, because we're focused on status.
p97
aVAmong other things,
p98
aVif you want to show off how rich you are, how powerful you are,
p99
aVit's always better to own an original than a forgery
p100
aVbecause there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries.
p101
aVI don't doubt that that plays some role,
p102
aVbut what I want to convince you of today
p103
aVis that there's something else going on.
p104
aVI want to convince you
p105
aVthat humans are, to some extent, natural born essentialists.
p106
aVWhat I mean by this
p107
aVis we don't just respond to things as we see them,
p108
aVor feel them, or hear them.
p109
aVRather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs,
p110
aVabout what they really are, what they came from,
p111
aVwhat they're made of, what their hidden nature is.
p112
aVI want to suggest that this is true,
p113
aVnot just for how we think about things,
p114
aVbut how we react to things.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo I want to suggest that pleasure is deep \u2014
p117
aVand that this isn't true
p118
aVjust for higher level pleasures like art,
p119
aVbut even the most seemingly simple pleasures
p120
aVare affected by our beliefs about hidden essences.
p121
aVSo take food.
p122
aVWould you eat this?
p123
aVWell, a good answer is, "It depends. What is it?"
p124
aVSome of you would eat it if it's pork, but not beef.
p125
aVSome of you would eat it if it's beef, but not pork.
p126
aVFew of you would eat it if it's a rat
p127
aVor a human.
p128
aVSome of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu.
p129
aVThat's not so surprising.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut what's more interesting
p132
aVis how it tastes to you
p133
aVwill depend critically on what you think you're eating.
p134
aVSo one demonstration of this was done with young children.
p135
aVHow do you make children
p136
aVnot just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk,
p137
aVbut to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk \u2014
p138
aVto think they taste better?
p139
aVIt's simple, you tell them they're from McDonald's.
p140
aVThey believe McDonald's food is tastier,
p141
aVand it leads them to experience it as tastier.
p142
aa(lp143
VHow do you get adults to really enjoy wine?
p144
aVIt's very simple:
p145
aVpour it from an expensive bottle.
p146
aVThere are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing
p147
aVthat if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff,
p148
aVit tastes better to you.
p149
aVThis was recently done with a neuroscientific twist.
p150
aVThey get people into a fMRI scanner,
p151
aVand while they're lying there, through a tube,
p152
aVthey get to sip wine.
p153
aVIn front of them on a screen is information about the wine.
p154
aVEverybody, of course,
p155
aVdrinks exactly the same wine.
p156
aVBut if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff,
p157
aVparts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward
p158
aVlight up like a Christmas tree.
p159
aVIt's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more,
p160
aVyou really experience it in a different way.
p161
aa(lp162
VOr take sex.
p163
aVThese are stimuli I've used in some of my studies.
p164
aVAnd if you simply show people these pictures,
p165
aVthey'll say these are fairly attractive people.
p166
aVBut how attractive you find them,
p167
aVhow sexually or romantically moved you are by them,
p168
aVrests critically on who you think you're looking at.
p169
aVYou probably think the picture on the left is male,
p170
aVthe one on the right is female.
p171
aVIf that belief turns out to be mistaken, it will make a difference.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVIt will make a difference if they turn out to be
p174
aVmuch younger or much older than you think they are.
p175
aVIt will make a difference if you were to discover
p176
aVthat the person you're looking at with lust
p177
aVis actually a disguised version of your son or daughter,
p178
aVyour mother or father.
p179
aVKnowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido.
p180
aVMaybe one of the most heartening findings
p181
aVfrom the psychology of pleasure
p182
aVis there's more to looking good than your physical appearance.
p183
aVIf you like somebody, they look better to you.
p184
aVThis is why spouses in happy marriages
p185
aVtend to think that their husband or wife
p186
aVlooks much better than anyone else thinks that they do.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VA particularly dramatic example of this
p191
aVcomes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome.
p192
aVSo Capgras syndrome is a disorder
p193
aVwhere you get a specific delusion.
p194
aVSufferers of Capgras syndrome
p195
aVbelieve that the people they love most in the world
p196
aVhave been replaced by perfect duplicates.
p197
aVNow often, a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic.
p198
aVPeople have murdered those that they loved,
p199
aVbelieving that they were murdering an imposter.
p200
aVBut there's at least one case
p201
aVwhere Capgras syndrome had a happy ending.
p202
aVThis was recorded in 1931.
p203
aV"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome
p204
aVwho complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover."
p205
aVBut that was before she got Capgras syndrome.
p206
aVAfter she got it, "She was happy to report
p207
aVthat she has discovered that he possessed a double
p208
aVwho was rich, virile, handsome and aristocratic."
p209
aVOf course, it was the same man,
p210
aVbut she was seeing him in different ways.
p211
aa(lp212
VAs a third example,
p213
aVconsider consumer products.
p214
aVSo one reason why you might like something is its utility.
p215
aVYou can put shoes on your feet; you can play golf with golf clubs;
p216
aVand chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you.
p217
aVBut each of these three objects has value
p218
aVabove and beyond what it can do for you
p219
aVbased on its history.
p220
aVThe golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy
p221
aVand sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction.
p222
aVThe bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears
p223
aVand sold for several hundreds of dollars.
p224
aVAnd in fact, there's a thriving market
p225
aVin the partially eaten food of beloved people.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVThe shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all.
p228
aVAccording to an unconfirmed report,
p229
aVa Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars
p230
aVfor this pair of shoes.
p231
aVThey were the ones thrown at George Bush
p232
aVat an Iraqi press conference several years ago.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Applause)
p235
aa(lp236
VNow this attraction to objects
p237
aVdoesn't just work for celebrity objects.
p238
aVEach one of us, most people,
p239
aVhave something in our life that's literally irreplaceable,
p240
aVin that it has value because of its history \u2014
p241
aVmaybe your wedding ring, maybe your child's baby shoes \u2014
p242
aVso that if it was lost, you couldn't get it back.
p243
aVYou could get something that looked like it or felt like it,
p244
aVbut you couldn't get the same object back.
p245
aVWith my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck,
p246
aVwe've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters
p247
aVfor the objects that people like.
p248
aVSo in one of our experiments,
p249
aVwe asked people to name a famous person who they adored,
p250
aVa living person they adored.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo one answer was George Clooney.
p253
aVThen we asked them,
p254
aV"How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?"
p255
aVAnd the answer is a fair amount \u2014
p256
aVmore than you would pay for a brand new sweater
p257
aVor a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore.
p258
aVThen we asked other groups of subjects \u2014
p259
aVwe gave them different restrictions
p260
aVand different conditions.
p261
aVSo for instance, we told some people,
p262
aV"Look, you can buy the sweater,
p263
aVbut you can't tell anybody you own it,
p264
aVand you can't resell it."
p265
aVThat drops the value of it,
p266
aVsuggesting that that's one reason why we like it.
p267
aVBut what really causes an effect
p268
aVis you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it,
p269
aVbut before it gets to you,
p270
aVit's thoroughly washed."
p271
aVThat causes a huge drop in the value.
p272
aVAs my wife put it, "You've washed away the Clooney cooties."
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VSo let's go back to art.
p277
aVI would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall.
p278
aVIf people want to get me something at the end of the conference,
p279
aVyou could buy me a Chagall.
p280
aVBut I don't want a duplicate,
p281
aVeven if I can't tell the difference.
p282
aVThat's not because, or it's not simply because,
p283
aVI'm a snob and want to boast about having an original.
p284
aVRather, it's because I want something that has a specific history.
p285
aVIn the case of artwork,
p286
aVthe history is special indeed.
p287
aVThe philosopher Denis Dutton
p288
aVin his wonderful book "The Art Instinct"
p289
aVmakes the case that, "The value of an artwork
p290
aVis rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation."
p291
aVAnd that could explain the difference
p292
aVbetween an original and a forgery.
p293
aVThey may look alike, but they have a different history.
p294
aVThe original is typically the product of a creative act,
p295
aVthe forgery isn't.
p296
aVI think this approach can explain differences
p297
aVin people's taste in art.
p298
aa(lp299
VThis is a work by Jackson Pollock.
p300
aVWho here likes the work of Jackson Pollock?
p301
aVOkay. Who here, it does nothing for them?
p302
aVThey just don't like it.
p303
aVI'm not going to make a claim about who's right,
p304
aVbut I will make an empirical claim
p305
aVabout people's intuitions,
p306
aVwhich is that, if you like the work of Jackson Pollock,
p307
aVyou'll tend more so than the people who don't like it
p308
aVto believe that these works are difficult to create,
p309
aVthat they require a lot of time and energy
p310
aVand creative energy.
p311
aVI use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example
p312
aVbecause there's a young American artist
p313
aVwho paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock,
p314
aVand her work was worth
p315
aVmany tens of thousands of dollars \u2014
p316
aVin large part because she's a very young artist.
p317
aa(lp318
VThis is Marla Olmstead
p319
aVwho did most of her work when she was three years old.
p320
aVThe interesting thing about Marla Olmstead
p321
aVis her family made the mistake
p322
aVof inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house
p323
aVto film her painting.
p324
aVAnd they then reported that her father was coaching her.
p325
aVWhen this came out on television,
p326
aVthe value of her art dropped to nothing.
p327
aVIt was the same art, physically,
p328
aVbut the history had changed.
p329
aa(lp330
VI've been focusing now on the visual arts,
p331
aVbut I want to give two examples from music.
p332
aVThis is Joshua Bell, a very famous violinist.
p333
aVAnd the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten
p334
aVdecided to enlist him for an audacious experiment.
p335
aVThe question is: How much would people like Joshua Bell,
p336
aVthe music of Joshua Bell,
p337
aVif they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell?
p338
aVSo he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin
p339
aVdown to a Washington D.C. subway station
p340
aVand stand in the corner and see how much money he would make.
p341
aVAnd here's a brief clip of this.
p342
aV(Violin music)
p343
aVAfter being there for three-quarters of an hour,
p344
aVhe made 32 dollars.
p345
aVNot bad. It's also not good.
p346
aVApparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell,
p347
aVyou have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell.
p348
aVHe actually made 20 dollars more than that,
p349
aVbut he didn't count it.
p350
aVBecause this woman comes up \u2014
p351
aVyou see at the end of the video \u2014 she comes up.
p352
aVShe had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before
p353
aVat this extravagant black-tie affair.
p354
aVSo she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station.
p355
aVSo she's struck with pity.
p356
aVShe reaches into her purse and hands him a 20.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Laughter)
p359
aa(lp360
V(Applause)
p361
aa(lp362
VThe second example from music
p363
aVis from John Cage's modernist composition,
p364
aV"4'33"."
p365
aVAs many of you know,
p366
aVthis is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench,
p367
aVopens up the piano
p368
aVand sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds \u2014
p369
aVthat period of silence.
p370
aVAnd people have different views on this.
p371
aVBut what I want to point out
p372
aVis you can buy this from iTunes.
p373
aV(Laughter)
p374
aVFor a dollar 99,
p375
aVyou can listen to that silence,
p376
aVwhich is different than other forms of silence.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
VNow I've been talking so far about pleasure,
p381
aVbut what I want to suggest
p382
aVis that everything I've said applies as well to pain.
p383
aVAnd how you think about what you're experiencing,
p384
aVyour beliefs about the essence of it,
p385
aVaffect how it hurts.
p386
aVOne lovely experiment
p387
aVwas done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner.
p388
aVWhat they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates
p389
aVto an electric shock machine.
p390
aVAnd they gave them a series of painful electric shocks.
p391
aVSo it was a series of five painful shocks.
p392
aVHalf of them are told that they're being given the shocks
p393
aVby somebody in another room,
p394
aVbut the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks.
p395
aVThere's no malevolence, they're just pressing a button.
p396
aVThe first shock is recorded as very painful.
p397
aVThe second shock feels less painful, because you get a bit used to it.
p398
aVThe third drops, the fourth, the fifth.
p399
aVThe pain gets less.
p400
aVIn the other condition,
p401
aVthey're told that the person in the next room
p402
aVis shocking them on purpose \u2014 knows they're shocking them.
p403
aVThe first shock hurts like hell.
p404
aVThe second shock hurts just as much,
p405
aVand the third and the fourth and the fifth.
p406
aVIt hurts more
p407
aVif you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose.
p408
aa(lp409
VThe most extreme example of this
p410
aVis that in some cases,
p411
aVpain under the right circumstances
p412
aVcan transform into pleasure.
p413
aVHumans have this extraordinarily interesting property
p414
aVthat will often seek out low-level doses of pain
p415
aVin controlled circumstances
p416
aVand take pleasure from it \u2014
p417
aVas in the eating of hot chili peppers
p418
aVand roller coaster rides.
p419
aVThe point was nicely summarized
p420
aVby the poet John Milton
p421
aVwho wrote, "The mind is its own place,
p422
aVand in itself can make a heaven of hell,
p423
aVa hell of heaven."
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd I'll end with that. Thank you.

His latest book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/justbabies\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Just Babies</em></a>, examines the nature and origins of good and evil. How do we decide what&#39;s fair and unfair? What is the relationship between emotion and rationality in our judgments of right and wrong? And how much of morality is present at birth?

VThis is a photograph
p5
aVby the artist Michael Najjar,
p6
aVand it's real,
p7
aVin the sense that he went there to Argentina
p8
aVto take the photo.
p9
aVBut it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.
p10
aVAnd what he's done
p11
aVis he's actually reshaped, digitally,
p12
aVall of the contours of the mountains
p13
aVto follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index.
p14
aVSo what you see,
p15
aVthat precipice, that high precipice with the valley,
p16
aVis the 2008 financial crisis.
p17
aVThe photo was made
p18
aVwhen we were deep in the valley over there.
p19
aVI don't know where we are now.
p20
aVThis is the Hang Seng index
p21
aVfor Hong Kong.
p22
aVAnd similar topography.
p23
aVI wonder why.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd this is art. This is metaphor.
p26
aVBut I think the point is
p27
aVthat this is metaphor with teeth,
p28
aVand it's with those teeth that I want to propose today
p29
aVthat we rethink a little bit
p30
aVabout the role of contemporary math \u2014
p31
aVnot just financial math, but math in general.
p32
aVThat its transition
p33
aVfrom being something that we extract and derive from the world
p34
aVto something that actually starts to shape it \u2014
p35
aVthe world around us and the world inside us.
p36
aVAnd it's specifically algorithms,
p37
aVwhich are basically the math
p38
aVthat computers use to decide stuff.
p39
aVThey acquire the sensibility of truth
p40
aVbecause they repeat over and over again,
p41
aVand they ossify and calcify,
p42
aVand they become real.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd I was thinking about this, of all places,
p45
aVon a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago,
p46
aVbecause I happened to be seated
p47
aVnext to a Hungarian physicist about my age
p48
aVand we were talking
p49
aVabout what life was like during the Cold War
p50
aVfor physicists in Hungary.
p51
aVAnd I said, "So what were you doing?"
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth."
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd I said, "That's a good job. That's interesting.
p56
aVHow does that work?"
p57
aVAnd to understand that,
p58
aVyou have to understand a little bit about how stealth works.
p59
aVAnd so \u2014 this is an over-simplification \u2014
p60
aVbut basically, it's not like
p61
aVyou can just pass a radar signal
p62
aVright through 156 tons of steel in the sky.
p63
aVIt's not just going to disappear.
p64
aVBut if you can take this big, massive thing,
p65
aVand you could turn it into
p66
aVa million little things \u2014
p67
aVsomething like a flock of birds \u2014
p68
aVwell then the radar that's looking for that
p69
aVhas to be able to see
p70
aVevery flock of birds in the sky.
p71
aVAnd if you're a radar, that's a really bad job.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd he said, "Yeah." He said, "But that's if you're a radar.
p74
aVSo we didn't use a radar;
p75
aVwe built a black box that was looking for electrical signals,
p76
aVelectronic communication.
p77
aVAnd whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication,
p78
aVwe thought, 'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'"
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd I said, "Yeah.
p81
aVThat's good.
p82
aVSo you've effectively negated
p83
aV60 years of aeronautic research.
p84
aVWhat's your act two?
p85
aVWhat do you do when you grow up?"
p86
aVAnd he said,
p87
aV"Well, financial services."
p88
aVAnd I said, "Oh."
p89
aVBecause those had been in the news lately.
p90
aVAnd I said, "How does that work?"
p91
aVAnd he said, "Well there's 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now,
p92
aVand I'm one of them."
p93
aVAnd I said, "What's the black box for Wall Street?"
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd he said, "It's funny you ask that,
p96
aVbecause it's actually called black box trading.
p97
aVAnd it's also sometimes called algo trading,
p98
aValgorithmic trading."
p99
aVAnd algorithmic trading evolved in part
p100
aVbecause institutional traders have the same problems
p101
aVthat the United States Air Force had,
p102
aVwhich is that they're moving these positions \u2014
p103
aVwhether it's Proctor & Gamble or Accenture, whatever \u2014
p104
aVthey're moving a million shares of something
p105
aVthrough the market.
p106
aVAnd if they do that all at once,
p107
aVit's like playing poker and going all in right away.
p108
aVYou just tip your hand.
p109
aVAnd so they have to find a way \u2014
p110
aVand they use algorithms to do this \u2014
p111
aVto break up that big thing
p112
aVinto a million little transactions.
p113
aVAnd the magic and the horror of that
p114
aVis that the same math
p115
aVthat you use to break up the big thing
p116
aVinto a million little things
p117
aVcan be used to find a million little things
p118
aVand sew them back together
p119
aVand figure out what's actually happening in the market.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo if you need to have some image
p122
aVof what's happening in the stock market right now,
p123
aVwhat you can picture is a bunch of algorithms
p124
aVthat are basically programmed to hide,
p125
aVand a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act.
p126
aVAnd all of that's great, and it's fine.
p127
aVAnd that's 70 percent
p128
aVof the United States stock market,
p129
aV70 percent of the operating system
p130
aVformerly known as your pension,
p131
aVyour mortgage.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd what could go wrong?
p134
aVWhat could go wrong
p135
aVis that a year ago,
p136
aVnine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes,
p137
aVand they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45.
p138
aVAll of a sudden, nine percent just goes away,
p139
aVand nobody to this day
p140
aVcan even agree on what happened
p141
aVbecause nobody ordered it, nobody asked for it.
p142
aVNobody had any control over what was actually happening.
p143
aVAll they had
p144
aVwas just a monitor in front of them
p145
aVthat had the numbers on it
p146
aVand just a red button
p147
aVthat said, "Stop."
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd that's the thing,
p150
aVis that we're writing things,
p151
aVwe're writing these things that we can no longer read.
p152
aVAnd we've rendered something
p153
aVillegible,
p154
aVand we've lost the sense
p155
aVof what's actually happening
p156
aVin this world that we've made.
p157
aVAnd we're starting to make our way.
p158
aVThere's a company in Boston called Nanex,
p159
aVand they use math and magic
p160
aVand I don't know what,
p161
aVand they reach into all the market data
p162
aVand they find, actually sometimes, some of these algorithms.
p163
aVAnd when they find them they pull them out
p164
aVand they pin them to the wall like butterflies.
p165
aVAnd they do what we've always done
p166
aVwhen confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand \u2014
p167
aVwhich is that they give them a name
p168
aVand a story.
p169
aVSo this is one that they found,
p170
aVthey called the Knife,
p171
aVthe Carnival,
p172
aVthe Boston Shuffler,
p173
aVTwilight.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd the gag is
p176
aVthat, of course, these aren't just running through the market.
p177
aVYou can find these kinds of things wherever you look,
p178
aVonce you learn how to look for them.
p179
aVYou can find it here: this book about flies
p180
aVthat you may have been looking at on Amazon.
p181
aVYou may have noticed it
p182
aVwhen its price started at 1.7 million dollars.
p183
aVIt's out of print \u2014 still ...
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVIf you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain.
p186
aVA few hours later, it had gone up
p187
aVto 23.6 million dollars,
p188
aVplus shipping and handling.
p189
aVAnd the question is:
p190
aVNobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?
p191
aVAnd you see this behavior on Amazon
p192
aVas surely as you see it on Wall Street.
p193
aVAnd when you see this kind of behavior,
p194
aVwhat you see is the evidence
p195
aVof algorithms in conflict,
p196
aValgorithms locked in loops with each other,
p197
aVwithout any human oversight,
p198
aVwithout any adult supervision
p199
aVto say, "Actually, 1.7 million is plenty."
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd as with Amazon, so it is with Netflix.
p204
aVAnd so Netflix has gone through
p205
aVseveral different algorithms over the years.
p206
aVThey started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others \u2014
p207
aVthere's Dinosaur Planet; there's Gravity.
p208
aVThey're using Pragmatic Chaos now.
p209
aVPragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms,
p210
aVtrying to do the same thing.
p211
aVIt's trying to get a grasp on you,
p212
aVon the firmware inside the human skull,
p213
aVso that it can recommend what movie
p214
aVyou might want to watch next \u2014
p215
aVwhich is a very, very difficult problem.
p216
aVBut the difficulty of the problem
p217
aVand the fact that we don't really quite have it down,
p218
aVit doesn't take away
p219
aVfrom the effects Pragmatic Chaos has.
p220
aVPragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms,
p221
aVdetermines, in the end,
p222
aV60 percent
p223
aVof what movies end up being rented.
p224
aVSo one piece of code
p225
aVwith one idea about you
p226
aVis responsible for 60 percent of those movies.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut what if you could rate those movies
p229
aVbefore they get made?
p230
aVWouldn't that be handy?
p231
aVWell, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood,
p232
aVand they have "story algorithms" \u2014
p233
aVa company called Epagogix.
p234
aVAnd you can run your script through there,
p235
aVand they can tell you, quantifiably,
p236
aVthat that's a 30 million dollar movie
p237
aVor a 200 million dollar movie.
p238
aVAnd the thing is, is that this isn't Google.
p239
aVThis isn't information.
p240
aVThese aren't financial stats; this is culture.
p241
aVAnd what you see here,
p242
aVor what you don't really see normally,
p243
aVis that these are the physics of culture.
p244
aVAnd if these algorithms,
p245
aVlike the algorithms on Wall Street,
p246
aVjust crashed one day and went awry,
p247
aVhow would we know?
p248
aVWhat would it look like?
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd they're in your house. They're in your house.
p251
aVThese are two algorithms competing for your living room.
p252
aVThese are two different cleaning robots
p253
aVthat have very different ideas about what clean means.
p254
aVAnd you can see it
p255
aVif you slow it down and attach lights to them,
p256
aVand they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom.
p257
aVAnd the idea that architecture itself
p258
aVis somehow subject to algorithmic optimization
p259
aVis not far-fetched.
p260
aVIt's super-real and it's happening around you.
p261
aa(lp262
VYou feel it most
p263
aVwhen you're in a sealed metal box,
p264
aVa new-style elevator;
p265
aVthey're called destination-control elevators.
p266
aVThese are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to
p267
aVbefore you get in the elevator.
p268
aVAnd it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm.
p269
aVSo none of this mishegas
p270
aVof letting everybody go into whatever car they want.
p271
aVEverybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two,
p272
aVand everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five.
p273
aVAnd the problem with that
p274
aVis that people freak out.
p275
aVPeople panic.
p276
aVAnd you see why. You see why.
p277
aVIt's because the elevator
p278
aVis missing some important instrumentation, like the buttons.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aVLike the things that people use.
p281
aVAll it has
p282
aVis just the number that moves up or down
p283
aVand that red button that says, "Stop."
p284
aVAnd this is what we're designing for.
p285
aVWe're designing
p286
aVfor this machine dialect.
p287
aVAnd how far can you take that? How far can you take it?
p288
aVYou can take it really, really far.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo let me take it back to Wall Street.
p291
aVBecause the algorithms of Wall Street
p292
aVare dependent on one quality above all else,
p293
aVwhich is speed.
p294
aVAnd they operate on milliseconds and microseconds.
p295
aVAnd just to give you a sense of what microseconds are,
p296
aVit takes you 500,000 microseconds
p297
aVjust to click a mouse.
p298
aVBut if you're a Wall Street algorithm
p299
aVand you're five microseconds behind,
p300
aVyou're a loser.
p301
aVSo if you were an algorithm,
p302
aVyou'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt
p303
aVwho was hollowing out a skyscraper \u2014
p304
aVthrowing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use,
p305
aVand just running steel on the floors
p306
aVto get ready for the stacks of servers to go in \u2014
p307
aVall so an algorithm
p308
aVcould get close to the Internet.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.
p311
aVAnd of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.
p312
aVIn New York, this is where it's distributed from:
p313
aVthe Carrier Hotel
p314
aVlocated on Hudson Street.
p315
aVAnd this is really where the wires come right up into the city.
p316
aVAnd the reality is that the further away you are from that,
p317
aVyou're a few microseconds behind every time.
p318
aVThese guys down on Wall Street,
p319
aVMarco Polo and Cherokee Nation,
p320
aVthey're eight microseconds
p321
aVbehind all these guys
p322
aVgoing into the empty buildings being hollowed out
p323
aVup around the Carrier Hotel.
p324
aVAnd that's going to keep happening.
p325
aVWe're going to keep hollowing them out,
p326
aVbecause you, inch for inch
p327
aVand pound for pound and dollar for dollar,
p328
aVnone of you could squeeze revenue out of that space
p329
aVlike the Boston Shuffler could.
p330
aa(lp331
VBut if you zoom out,
p332
aVif you zoom out,
p333
aVyou would see an 825-mile trench
p334
aVbetween New York City and Chicago
p335
aVthat's been built over the last few years
p336
aVby a company called Spread Networks.
p337
aVThis is a fiber optic cable
p338
aVthat was laid between those two cities
p339
aVto just be able to traffic one signal
p340
aV37 times faster than you can click a mouse \u2014
p341
aVjust for these algorithms,
p342
aVjust for the Carnival and the Knife.
p343
aVAnd when you think about this,
p344
aVthat we're running through the United States
p345
aVwith dynamite and rock saws
p346
aVso that an algorithm can close the deal
p347
aVthree microseconds faster,
p348
aVall for a communications framework
p349
aVthat no human will ever know,
p350
aVthat's a kind of manifest destiny;
p351
aVand we'll always look for a new frontier.
p352
aa(lp353
VUnfortunately, we have our work cut out for us.
p354
aVThis is just theoretical.
p355
aVThis is some mathematicians at MIT.
p356
aVAnd the truth is I don't really understand
p357
aVa lot of what they're talking about.
p358
aVIt involves light cones and quantum entanglement,
p359
aVand I don't really understand any of that.
p360
aVBut I can read this map,
p361
aVand what this map says
p362
aVis that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are,
p363
aVthat's where people are, where the cities are,
p364
aVyou're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are
p365
aVto do that most effectively.
p366
aVAnd the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots
p367
aVis that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean.
p368
aVSo that's what we'll do: we'll build bubbles or something,
p369
aVor platforms.
p370
aVWe'll actually part the water
p371
aVto pull money out of the air,
p372
aVbecause it's a bright future
p373
aVif you're an algorithm.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Laughter)
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd it's not the money that's so interesting actually.
p378
aVIt's what the money motivates,
p379
aVthat we're actually terraforming
p380
aVthe Earth itself
p381
aVwith this kind of algorithmic efficiency.
p382
aVAnd in that light,
p383
aVyou go back
p384
aVand you look at Michael Najjar's photographs,
p385
aVand you realize that they're not metaphor, they're prophecy.
p386
aVThey're prophecy
p387
aVfor the kind of seismic, terrestrial effects
p388
aVof the math that we're making.
p389
aVAnd the landscape was always made
p390
aVby this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration
p391
aVbetween nature and man.
p392
aVBut now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms \u2014
p393
aVthe Boston Shuffler, the Carnival.
p394
aVAnd we will have to understand those as nature,
p395
aVand in a way, they are.
p396
aa(lp397
VThank you.

VIf I should have a daughter,
p5
aVinstead of "Mom,"
p6
aVshe's going to call me "Point B,"
p7
aVbecause that way she knows that no matter what happens,
p8
aVat least she can always find her way to me.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands
p11
aVso she has to learn the entire universe
p12
aVbefore she can say, "Oh, I know that like the back of my hand."
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd she's going to learn
p15
aVthat this life will hit you hard in the face,
p16
aVwait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach.
p17
aVBut getting the wind knocked out of you
p18
aVis the only way to remind your lungs
p19
aVhow much they like the taste of air.
p20
aVThere is hurt, here,
p21
aVthat cannot be fixed by Band-Aids or poetry.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn't coming,
p24
aVI'll make sure she knows
p25
aVshe doesn't have to wear the cape all by herself,
p26
aVbecause no matter how wide you stretch your fingers,
p27
aVyour hands will always be too small
p28
aVto catch all the pain you want to heal.
p29
aVBelieve me, I've tried.
p30
aV"And, baby," I'll tell her,
p31
aVdon't keep your nose up in the air like that.
p32
aVI know that trick; I've done it a million times.
p33
aVYou're just smelling for smoke
p34
aVso you can follow the trail back to a burning house,
p35
aVso you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire
p36
aVto see if you can save him.
p37
aVOr else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place,
p38
aVto see if you can change him.
p39
aVBut I know she will anyway,
p40
aVso instead I'll always keep an extra supply
p41
aVof chocolate and rain boots nearby,
p42
aVbecause there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix.
p43
aVOkay, there's a few that chocolate can't fix.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut that's what the rain boots are for,
p46
aVbecause rain will wash away everything, if you let it.
p47
aVI want her to look at the world
p48
aVthrough the underside of a glass-bottom boat,
p49
aVto look through a microscope
p50
aVat the galaxies that exist
p51
aVon the pinpoint of a human mind,
p52
aVbecause that's the way my mom taught me.
p53
aVThat there'll be days like this.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Singing) There'll be days like this, my momma said.
p56
aVWhen you open your hands to catch
p57
aVand wind up with only blisters and bruises;
p58
aVwhen you step out of the phone booth and try to fly
p59
aVand the very people you want to save
p60
aVare the ones standing on your cape;
p61
aVwhen your boots will fill with rain,
p62
aVand you'll be up to your knees in disappointment.
p63
aVAnd those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you.
p64
aa(lp65
VBecause there's nothing more beautiful
p66
aVthan the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline,
p67
aVno matter how many times it's sent away.
p68
aVYou will put the wind in win some, lose some.
p69
aVYou will put the star in starting over, and over.
p70
aVAnd no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute,
p71
aVbe sure your mind lands
p72
aVon the beauty of this funny place called life.
p73
aVAnd yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting,
p74
aVI am pretty damn naive.
p75
aVBut I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar.
p76
aVIt can crumble so easily,
p77
aVbut don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.
p78
aa(lp79
V"Baby," I'll tell her, "remember, your momma is a worrier,
p80
aVand your poppa is a warrior,
p81
aVand you are the girl with small hands and big eyes
p82
aVwho never stops asking for more."
p83
aVRemember that good things come in threes
p84
aVand so do bad things.
p85
aVAlways apologize when you've done something wrong,
p86
aVbut don't you ever apologize
p87
aVfor the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.
p88
aVYour voice is small, but don't ever stop singing.
p89
aVAnd when they finally hand you heartache,
p90
aVwhen they slip war and hatred under your door
p91
aVand offer you handouts on street-corners
p92
aVof cynicism and defeat,
p93
aVyou tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Applause)
p96
aa(lp97
VThank you. Thank you.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Applause)
p100
aa(lp101
VThank you.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
VThanks.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Applause)
p108
aa(lp109
VThank you.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Applause)
p112
aa(lp113
VAll right, so I want you to take a moment,
p114
aVand I want you to think of three things that you know to be true.
p115
aVThey can be about whatever you want \u2014
p116
aVtechnology, entertainment, design,
p117
aVyour family, what you had for breakfast.
p118
aVThe only rule is don't think too hard.
p119
aVOkay, ready? Go.
p120
aVOkay.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo here are three things I know to be true.
p123
aVI know that Jean-Luc Godard was right when he said that,
p124
aV"A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end,
p125
aValthough not necessarily in that order."
p126
aVI know that I'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here,
p127
aVwhich is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd I know
p132
aVthat I have been waiting all week to tell this joke.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VWhy was the scarecrow invited to TED?
p137
aVBecause he was out standing in his field.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VI'm sorry.
p142
aVOkay, so these are three things I know to be true.
p143
aVBut there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding.
p144
aVSo I write poems to figure things out.
p145
aVSometimes the only way I know how to work through something
p146
aVis by writing a poem.
p147
aVSometimes I get to the end of the poem,
p148
aVlook back and go, "Oh, that's what this is all about,"
p149
aVand sometimes I get to the end of the poem
p150
aVand haven't solved anything,
p151
aVbut at least I have a new poem out of it.
p152
aa(lp153
VSpoken-word poetry is the art of performance poetry.
p154
aVI tell people it involves creating poetry
p155
aVthat doesn't just want to sit on paper,
p156
aVthat something about it demands it be heard out loud
p157
aVor witnessed in person.
p158
aa(lp159
VWhen I was a freshman in high school,
p160
aVI was a live wire of nervous hormones.
p161
aVAnd I was underdeveloped and over-excitable.
p162
aVAnd despite my fear
p163
aVof ever being looked at for too long,
p164
aVI was fascinated by the idea of spoken-word poetry.
p165
aVI felt that my two secret loves, poetry and theater,
p166
aVhad come together, had a baby,
p167
aVa baby I needed to get to know.
p168
aVSo I decided to give it a try.
p169
aVMy first spoken-word poem,
p170
aVpacked with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old,
p171
aVwas about the injustice
p172
aVof being seen as unfeminine.
p173
aVThe poem was very indignant,
p174
aVand mainly exaggerated,
p175
aVbut the only spoken-word poetry that I had seen up until that point
p176
aVwas mainly indignant,
p177
aVso I thought that's what was expected of me.
p178
aa(lp179
VThe first time that I performed,
p180
aVthe audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy,
p181
aVand when I came off the stage, I was shaking.
p182
aVI felt this tap on my shoulder,
p183
aVand I turned around to see
p184
aVthis giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.
p185
aVShe was maybe eight feet tall
p186
aVand looked like she could beat me up with one hand,
p187
aVbut instead she just nodded at me and said,
p188
aV"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."
p189
aVAnd lightning struck.
p190
aVI was hooked.
p191
aa(lp192
VI discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side
p193
aVthat hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,
p194
aVand my bewildered, but supportive, parents took me
p195
aVto soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could.
p196
aVI was the youngest by at least a decade,
p197
aVbut somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club
p198
aVdidn't seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about.
p199
aVIn fact, they welcomed me.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd it was here, listening to these poets share their stories,
p202
aVthat I learned that spoken-word poetry didn't have to be indignant,
p203
aVit could be fun or painful
p204
aVor serious or silly.
p205
aVThe Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home,
p206
aVand the poets who performed
p207
aVencouraged me to share my stories as well.
p208
aVNever mind the fact that I was 14.
p209
aVThey told me, "Write about being 14."
p210
aVSo I did and stood amazed every week
p211
aVwhen these brilliant, grown-up poets
p212
aVlaughed with me and groaned their sympathy
p213
aVand clapped and told me, "Hey, I really felt that too."
p214
aa(lp215
VNow I can divide my spoken-word journey
p216
aVinto three steps.
p217
aVStep one was the moment I said,
p218
aV"I can. I can do this."
p219
aVAnd that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.
p220
aVStep two was the moment I said,
p221
aV"I will. I will continue.
p222
aVI love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week."
p223
aVAnd step three began
p224
aVwhen I realized I didn't have to write indignant poems,
p225
aVif that's not what I was.
p226
aVThere were things that were specific to me,
p227
aVand the more that I focused on those things,
p228
aVthe weirder my poetry got,
p229
aVbut the more that it felt like mine.
p230
aVIt's not just the adage "Write what you know."
p231
aVIt's about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience
p232
aVyou've collected up to now
p233
aVto help you dive into the things you don't know.
p234
aVI use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand,
p235
aVbut I show up to each new poem
p236
aVwith a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been.
p237
aa(lp238
VWhen I got to university, I met a fellow poet
p239
aVwho shared my belief in the magic of spoken-word poetry.
p240
aVAnd actually, Phil Kaye and I
p241
aVcoincidentally also share the same last name.
p242
aVWhen I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E.
p243
aVas a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me.
p244
aVBut Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E.,
p245
aVthis time changing the mission
p246
aVto using spoken-word poetry as a way to entertain,
p247
aVeducate and inspire.
p248
aVWe stayed full-time students, but in between we traveled,
p249
aVperforming and teaching
p250
aVnine-year-olds to MFA candidates,
p251
aVfrom California to Indiana to India
p252
aVto a public high school just up the street from campus.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd we saw over and over
p255
aVthe way that spoken-word poetry
p256
aVcracks open locks.
p257
aVBut it turns out sometimes, poetry can be really scary.
p258
aVTurns out sometimes,
p259
aVyou have to trick teenagers into writing poetry.
p260
aVSo I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists.
p261
aVAnd the first list that I assign
p262
aVis "10 Things I Know to be True."
p263
aVAnd here's what happens, you would discover it too
p264
aVif we all started sharing our lists out loud.
p265
aVAt a certain point, you would realize that someone has the exact same thing,
p266
aVor one thing very similar,
p267
aVto something on your list.
p268
aVAnd then someone else
p269
aVhas something the complete opposite of yours.
p270
aVThird, someone has something you've never even heard of before.
p271
aVFourth, someone has something you thought you knew everything about,
p272
aVbut they're introducing a new angle of looking at it.
p273
aVAnd I tell people that this is where great stories start from \u2014
p274
aVthese four intersections
p275
aVof what you're passionate about
p276
aVand what others might be invested in.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd most people respond really well to this exercise.
p279
aVBut one of my students, a freshman named Charlotte,
p280
aVwas not convinced.
p281
aVCharlotte was very good at writing lists, but she refused to write any poems.
p282
aV"Miss," she'd say, "I'm just not interesting.
p283
aVI don't have anything interesting to say."
p284
aVSo I assigned her list after list,
p285
aVand one day I assigned the list
p286
aV"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."
p287
aVNumber three on Charlotte's list was,
p288
aV"I should have learned not to crush on guys
p289
aVthree times my age."
p290
aVI asked her what that meant,
p291
aVand she said, "Miss, it's kind of a long story."
p292
aVAnd I said, "Charlotte, it sounds pretty interesting to me."
p293
aVAnd so she wrote her first poem,
p294
aVa love poem unlike any I had ever heard before.
p295
aVAnd the poem began,
p296
aV"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
V"Did you see him on 60 Minutes,
p301
aVracing Michael Phelps in a pool \u2014
p302
aVnothing but swim trunks on \u2014
p303
aVdiving in the water, determined to beat this swimming champion?
p304
aVAfter the race, he tossed his wet, cloud-white hair
p305
aVand said, 'You're a god.'
p306
aVNo, Anderson, you're the god."
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
V(Applause)
p311
aa(lp312
VNow, I know that the number one rule to being cool
p313
aVis to seem unfazed,
p314
aVto never admit that anything scares you
p315
aVor impresses you or excites you.
p316
aVSomebody once told me
p317
aVit's like walking through life like this.
p318
aVYou protect yourself
p319
aVfrom all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up.
p320
aVBut I try to walk through life like this.
p321
aVAnd yes, that means catching all of those miseries and hurt,
p322
aVbut it also means that when beautiful, amazing things
p323
aVjust fall out of the sky,
p324
aVI'm ready to catch them.
p325
aVI use spoken word to help my students
p326
aVrediscover wonder,
p327
aVto fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed
p328
aVand, instead, actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them,
p329
aVso that they can reinterpret and create something from it.
p330
aa(lp331
VIt's not that I think that spoken-word poetry
p332
aVis the ideal art form.
p333
aVI'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story.
p334
aVI write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems.
p335
aVBut I teach spoken-word poetry
p336
aVbecause it's accessible.
p337
aVNot everyone can read music or owns a camera,
p338
aVbut everyone can communicate in some way,
p339
aVand everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from.
p340
aVPlus, spoken-word poetry allows for immediate connection.
p341
aVIt's not uncommon to feel like you're alone
p342
aVor that nobody understands you,
p343
aVbut spoken word teaches
p344
aVthat if you have the ability to express yourself
p345
aVand the courage to present those stories and opinions,
p346
aVyou could be rewarded
p347
aVwith a room full of your peers,
p348
aVor your community, who will listen.
p349
aVAnd maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie
p350
aVwho will connect with what you've shared.
p351
aVAnd that is an amazing realization to have,
p352
aVespecially when you're 14.
p353
aVPlus, now with YouTube,
p354
aVthat connection's not even limited to the room we're in.
p355
aVI'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances
p356
aVthat I can share with my students.
p357
aVIt allows for even more opportunities
p358
aVfor them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to.
p359
aa(lp360
VOnce you've figured this out,
p361
aVit is tempting to keep writing the same poem,
p362
aVor keep telling the same story, over and over,
p363
aVonce you've figured out that it will gain you applause.
p364
aVIt's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself.
p365
aVYou have to grow and explore
p366
aVand take risks and challenge yourself.
p367
aVAnd that is step three:
p368
aVinfusing the work you're doing
p369
aVwith the specific things that make you you,
p370
aVeven while those things are always changing.
p371
aVBecause step three never ends.
p372
aVBut you don't get to start on step three,
p373
aVuntil you take step one first:
p374
aV"I can."
p375
aa(lp376
VI travel a lot while I'm teaching,
p377
aVand I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three,
p378
aVbut I was very lucky with Charlotte,
p379
aVthat I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did.
p380
aVI watched her realize
p381
aVthat, by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing,
p382
aVshe can create poems that only Charlotte can write,
p383
aVabout eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer.
p384
aVAnd I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell \u2014
p385
aVlike this story.
p386
aVI spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story,
p387
aVand I wondered if the best way
p388
aVwas going to be a PowerPoint, a short film \u2014
p389
aVAnd where exactly was the beginning, the middle or the end?
p390
aVI wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk
p391
aVand finally have figured it all out, or not.
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club,
p394
aVbut it's possible that it was much earlier.
p395
aVIn preparing for TED,
p396
aVI discovered this diary page in an old journal.
p397
aVI think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th.
p398
aVIt's clear that when I was a child,
p399
aVI definitely walked through life like this.
p400
aVI think that we all did.
p401
aVI would like to help others rediscover that wonder \u2014
p402
aVto want to engage with it, to want to learn,
p403
aVto want to share what they've learned,
p404
aVwhat they've figured out to be true
p405
aVand what they're still figuring out.
p406
aa(lp407
VSo I'd like to close with this poem.
p408
aa(lp409
VWhen they bombed Hiroshima,
p410
aVthe explosion formed a mini-supernova,
p411
aVso every living animal, human or plant
p412
aVthat received direct contact with the rays from that sun
p413
aVwas instantly turned to ash.
p414
aVAnd what was left of the city soon followed.
p415
aVThe long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation
p416
aVcaused an entire city and its population
p417
aVto turn into powder.
p418
aVWhen I was born, my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room
p419
aVwith a stare that said, "This? I've done this before."
p420
aVShe says I have old eyes.
p421
aVWhen my Grandpa Genji died, I was only five years old,
p422
aVbut I took my mom by the hand and told her,
p423
aV"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."
p424
aVAnd yet, for someone who's apparently done this already,
p425
aVI still haven't figured anything out yet.
p426
aVMy knees still buckle every time I get on a stage.
p427
aVMy self-confidence can be measured out
p428
aVin teaspoons mixed into my poetry,
p429
aVand it still always tastes funny in my mouth.
p430
aVBut in Hiroshima, some people were wiped clean away,
p431
aVleaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.
p432
aVSo no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets,
p433
aVI keep trying,
p434
aVhoping that one day I'll write a poem
p435
aVI can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit
p436
aVas the only proof I existed.
p437
aVMy parents named me Sarah, which is a biblical name.
p438
aVIn the original story, God told Sarah she could do something impossible, and \u2014
p439
aVshe laughed,
p440
aVbecause the first Sarah,
p441
aVshe didn't know what to do with impossible.
p442
aVAnd me?
p443
aVWell, neither do I,
p444
aVbut I see the impossible every day.
p445
aVImpossible is trying to connect in this world,
p446
aVtrying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you,
p447
aVknowing that while you're speaking,
p448
aVthey aren't just waiting for their turn to talk \u2014 they hear you.
p449
aVThey feel exactly what you feel
p450
aVat the same time that you feel it.
p451
aVIt's what I strive for every time I open my mouth \u2014
p452
aVthat impossible connection.
p453
aVThere's this piece of wall in Hiroshima
p454
aVthat was completely burnt black by the radiation.
p455
aVBut on the front step, a person who was sitting there
p456
aVblocked the rays from hitting the stone.
p457
aVThe only thing left now
p458
aVis a permanent shadow of positive light.
p459
aVAfter the A-bomb,
p460
aVspecialists said it would take 75 years
p461
aVfor the radiation-damaged soil of Hiroshima City
p462
aVto ever grow anything again.
p463
aVBut that spring, there were new buds popping up from the earth.
p464
aVWhen I meet you, in that moment,
p465
aVI'm no longer a part of your future.
p466
aVI start quickly becoming part of your past.
p467
aVBut in that instant, I get to share your present.
p468
aVAnd you, you get to share mine.
p469
aVAnd that is the greatest present of all.
p470
aVSo if you tell me I can do the impossible \u2014
p471
aVI'll probably laugh at you.
p472
aVI don't know if I can change the world yet,
p473
aVbecause I don't know that much about it \u2014
p474
aVand I don't know that much about reincarnation either,
p475
aVbut if you make me laugh hard enough,
p476
aVsometimes I forget what century I'm in.
p477
aVThis isn't my first time here. This isn't my last time here.
p478
aVThese aren't the last words I'll share.
p479
aVBut just in case, I'm trying my hardest
p480
aVto get it right this time around.

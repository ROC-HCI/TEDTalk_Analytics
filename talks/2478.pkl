V[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.]
p5
aV[The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people]
p6
aV[hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts.]
p7
aV[What does this mean?]
p8
aV[We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.]
p9
aa(lp10
VThis week, there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories
p11
aVcoming out from the leak of 11 million documents
p12
aVfrom a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca.
p13
aVThe release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece
p14
aVof the secretive offshore world.
p15
aVWe get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers
p16
aVgo to companies like Mossack Fonseca
p17
aVand say, "OK, we want an anonymous company,
p18
aVcan you give us one?"
p19
aVSo you actually get to see the emails,
p20
aVyou get to see the exchanges of messages,
p21
aVyou get to see the mechanics of how this works,
p22
aVhow this operates.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions.
p25
aVThe Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.
p26
aVWe've also had news
p27
aVthat an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad
p28
aVhas also got offshore companies.
p29
aVThere's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail
p30
aVthat leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia
p31
aVvia his close childhood friend,
p32
aVwho happens to be a top cellist.
p33
aVAnd there will be a lot of rich individuals out there
p34
aVand others who will be nervous about the next set of stories
p35
aVand the next set of leaked documents.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller
p38
aVor a John Grisham novel.
p39
aVIt seems very distant from you, me, ordinary people.
p40
aVWhy should we care about this?
p41
aVBut the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals
p42
aVare able to keep their money offshore
p43
aVand not pay the taxes that they should,
p44
aVit means that there is less money for vital public services
p45
aVlike healthcare, education, roads.
p46
aVAnd that affects all of us.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, for my organization Global Witness,
p49
aVthis exposé has been phenomenal.
p50
aVWe have the world's media and political leaders
p51
aVtalking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy
p52
aVto hide and disguise their assets \u2014
p53
aVsomething we have been talking about and exposing for a decade.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow, I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing,
p56
aVand hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works.
p57
aVI like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll.
p58
aVSo you can have one company stacked inside another company,
p59
aVstacked inside another company,
p60
aVmaking it almost impossible to really understand
p61
aVwho is behind these structures.
p62
aVIt can be very difficult for law enforcement
p63
aVor tax authorities, journalists, civil society
p64
aVto really understand what's going on.
p65
aa(lp66
VI also think it's interesting
p67
aVthat there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States.
p68
aVAnd that's perhaps because some prominent US people
p69
aVjust haven't figured in this exposé, in this scandal.
p70
aVNow, that's not because there are no rich Americans
p71
aVwho are stashing their assets offshore.
p72
aVIt's just because of the way in which offshore works,
p73
aVMossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.
p74
aVI think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands
p75
aVor even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada,
p76
aVyou would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn fact, in a number of US states you need less information,
p79
aVyou need to provide less information to get a company
p80
aVthan you do to get a library card.
p81
aVThat sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts
p82
aVto rip off schoolchildren.
p83
aVIt has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors.
p84
aVThis is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, at Global Witness,
p87
aVwe wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice.
p88
aVHow does this actually work?
p89
aVSo what we did
p90
aVis we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms.
p91
aVOur investigator posed as an African minister
p92
aVwho wanted to move suspect funds into the United States
p93
aVto buy a house, a yacht, a jet.
p94
aVNow, what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers
p95
aVprovided our investigator with suggestions
p96
aVon how to move those suspect funds.
p97
aVThese were all preliminary meetings,
p98
aVand none of the lawyers took us on as a client
p99
aVand of course no money moved hands,
p100
aVbut it really shows the problem with the system.
p101
aa(lp102
VIt's also important
p103
aVto not just think about this as individual cases.
p104
aVThis is not just about an individual lawyer
p105
aVwho's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions.
p106
aVIt's not just about a particular senior politician
p107
aVwho's been caught up in a scandal.
p108
aVThis is about how a system works,
p109
aVthat entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.
p110
aVAnd in order to tackle this,
p111
aVwe need to change the game.
p112
aVWe need to change the rules of the game
p113
aVto make this sort of behavior harder.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis may seem like doom and gloom,
p116
aVlike there's nothing we can do about it,
p117
aVlike nothing has ever changed,
p118
aVlike there will always be rich and powerful individuals.
p119
aVBut as a natural optimist,
p120
aVI do see that we are starting to get some change.
p121
aa(lp122
VOver the last couple of years,
p123
aVwe've seen a real push towards greater transparency
p124
aVwhen it comes to company ownership.
p125
aVThis issue was put on the political agenda
p126
aVby the UK Prime Minister David Cameron
p127
aVat a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013.
p128
aVAnd since then, the European Union is going to be creating
p129
aVcentral registers at a national level
p130
aVof who really owns and controls companies across Europe.
p131
aa(lp132
VOne of the things that is sad is that, actually, the US is lagging behind.
p133
aVThere's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced
p134
aVin the House and the Senate,
p135
aVbut it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see.
p136
aVSo we'd really want to see the Panama leaks,
p137
aVthis huge peek into the offshore world,
p138
aVbe used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world.
p139
aa(lp140
VFor us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
p141
aVWe need ordinary people to get angry
p142
aVat the way in which people can hide their identity
p143
aVbehind secret companies.
p144
aVWe need business leaders to stand up and say,
p145
aV"Secrecy like this is not good for business."
p146
aVWe need political leaders to recognize the problem,
p147
aVand to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.
p148
aa(lp149
VTogether, we can end the secrecy
p150
aVthat is currently allowing tax evasion,
p151
aVcorruption, money laundering to flourish.

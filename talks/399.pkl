VI thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab].
p5
aVWhen they were a bunch of kids,
p6
aVthey were kind of very imaginative, very adventurous,
p7
aVas they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals
p8
aVand see which one blows up more.
p9
aVWell, I don't recommend that you try to do that now.
p10
aVNaturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then,
p11
aVhey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, that's what we call our first five employees
p14
aVduring the tea break, you know, in here.
p15
aVAs I said, they were adventurous people.
p16
aVAs a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult
p17
aVwhich was not too far from here on Orange Grove,
p18
aVand unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals
p19
aVand trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals.
p20
aVSo, that gives you a kind of flavor
p21
aVof the kind of people we have there.
p22
aVWe try to avoid blowing ourselves up.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis one I thought I'd show you.
p25
aVGuess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd.
p26
aVI tried to come like him this morning,
p27
aVbut as I walked out, then it was too cold,
p28
aVand I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.
p29
aVBut more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture:
p30
aVlook where the other people are looking,
p31
aVand look where he is looking.
p32
aVWherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else,
p33
aVand go do something different, you know, and doing that.
p34
aVAnd that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson
p37
aVthat one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office,
p38
aVand it says, "Do not go where the path may lead.
p39
aVGo instead where there is no path, and leave a trail."
p40
aVAnd that's my recommendation to all of you:
p41
aVlook what everybody is doing, what they are doing;
p42
aVgo do something completely different.
p43
aVDon't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing,
p44
aVbecause that doesn't get you very far.
p45
aa(lp46
VIn our early days we used to work a lot on rockets,
p47
aVbut we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.
p48
aVAs you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago.
p49
aVBut then a big difference happened about 50 years ago,
p50
aVafter Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite,
p51
aVand that's the one you see on the left in there.
p52
aVAnd here we made 180 degrees change:
p53
aVwe changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.
p54
aVAnd that was done over a period of a couple of years,
p55
aVand now we are the leading organization, you know,
p56
aVexploring space on all of your behalf.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves,
p59
aVsometimes there are setbacks.
p60
aVSo you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward;
p61
aVsomehow it ended going sideways.
p62
aVSo that's what we call the misguided missile.
p63
aVBut then also, just to celebrate that,
p64
aVwe started an event at JPL for "Miss Guided Missile."
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, we used to have a celebration every year and select \u2014
p67
aVthere used to be competition and parades and so on.
p68
aVIt's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it;
p69
aVI think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days.
p70
aVSo, we do something a little bit more serious.
p71
aVAnd that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know,
p72
aVwhen we entered one of the floats.
p73
aVThat's more on the play side. And on the right side,
p74
aVthat's the Rover just before we finished its testing
p75
aVto take it to the Cape to launch it.
p76
aVThese are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now.
p77
aVSo that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things,
p78
aVyou know, and the serious things that we try to do.
p79
aVBut I said I'm going to show you a short clip
p80
aVof one of our employees to kind of give you an idea
p81
aVabout some of the talent that we have.
p82
aa(lp83
VVideo: Morgan Hendry: Beware of Safety is
p84
aVan instrumental rock band.
p85
aVIt branches on more the experimental side.
p86
aVThere's the improvisational side of jazz.
p87
aVThere's the heavy-hitting sound of rock.
p88
aVBeing able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig
p89
aVfor more abstract sounds and things to play live,
p90
aVmixing electronics and acoustics.
p91
aVThe music's half of me, but the other half \u2014
p92
aVI landed probably the best gig of all.
p93
aVI work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover.
p94
aVSome of the most brilliant engineers I know
p95
aVare the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.
p96
aVYou've got to do what you want to do.
p97
aVAnd anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them.
p98
aVMaybe they're right - I doubt it.
p99
aVTell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do.
p100
aVI'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA.
p101
aa(lp102
VCharles Elachi: Now, moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff,
p103
aValways people ask, why do we explore?
p104
aVWhy are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them?
p105
aVWell, the way I think about it is fairly simple.
p106
aVSomehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard
p107
aVa little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe.
p108
aVBut somehow what strikes everybody's imagination \u2014
p109
aVor lots of people's imagination \u2014 somehow from that original Big Bang
p110
aVwe have this beautiful world that we live in today.
p111
aa(lp112
VYou look outside: you have all that beauty that you see,
p113
aVall that life that you see around you,
p114
aVand here we have intelligent people like you and I
p115
aVwho are having a conversation here.
p116
aVAll that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is:
p117
aVHow did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form?
p118
aVHow did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?
p119
aVWhy is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?
p120
aVIs that very common?
p121
aVIs there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?
p122
aVSo we literally are all made out of stardust.
p123
aVWe started from those stars; we are made of stardust.
p124
aVSo, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror
p125
aVand you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here.
p126
aVYou can skip the dust part.
p127
aVBut literally, we are all made of stardust.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively
p130
aVwrite the book of how things have came about as they are today.
p131
aVAnd one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go
p132
aVand explore that is to go towards Mars.
p133
aVAnd the reason Mars takes particular attention:
p134
aVit's not very far from us.
p135
aVYou know, it'll take us only six months to get there.
p136
aVSix to nine months at the right time of the year.
p137
aVIt's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller,
p138
aVbut the land mass on Mars is about the same
p139
aVas the land mass on Earth, you know,
p140
aVif you don't take the oceans into account.
p141
aVIt has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,
p142
aVso it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,
p143
aVand you can see some of the features on it,
p144
aVlike the Grand Canyon on Mars,
p145
aVor what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.
p146
aVIt is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo it's about the size, you know, of the United States.
p149
aVIt has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars,
p150
aVwhich is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.
p151
aVAnd if you look at the height of it
p152
aVand you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you
p153
aVan idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is,
p154
aVrelative to Mount Everest.
p155
aVSo, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth.
p156
aVSo, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events
p157
aVwhich have happened on that planet.
p158
aVRecently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like \u2014
p159
aVwe caught a landslide occurring as it was happening.
p160
aVSo it is a dynamic planet,
p161
aVand activity is going on as we speak today.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today,
p164
aVso I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing.
p165
aVThis is one very large crater. Geologists love craters,
p166
aVbecause craters are like digging a big hole in the ground
p167
aVwithout really working at it,
p168
aVand you can see what's below the surface.
p169
aVSo, this is called Victoria Crater,
p170
aVwhich is about a few football fields in size.
p171
aVAnd if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot.
p172
aVThis picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.
p173
aVIf I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface.
p174
aVSo, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,
p175
aVand we actually saw the Rover on the surface.
p176
aVAnd we actually used the combination of the satellite images
p177
aVand the Rover to actually conduct science,
p178
aVbecause we can observe large areas
p179
aVand then you can get those Rovers to move around
p180
aVand basically go to a certain location.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo, specifically what we are doing now is
p183
aVthat Rover is going down in that crater.
p184
aVAs I told you, geologists love craters.
p185
aVAnd the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon,
p186
aVand you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.
p187
aVAnd what these layers \u2014 that's what the surface used to be
p188
aVa million years ago, 10 million years ago,
p189
aV100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them.
p190
aVSo if you can read the layers it's like reading your book,
p191
aVand you can learn the history of what happened in the past
p192
aVin that location.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall
p195
aVof that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know,
p196
aVthe properties and analyzing the rocks
p197
aVas it's going down, you know, that canyon.
p198
aVNow, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving
p199
aVdown a slope like this.
p200
aVIf you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.
p201
aVBut we really made sure we tested those Rovers
p202
aVbefore we got them down \u2014 or that Rover \u2014
p203
aVand made sure that it's all working well.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow, when I came last time, shortly after the landing \u2014
p206
aVI think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing \u2014
p207
aVI told you I was surprised that those Rovers
p208
aVare lasting even a hundred days.
p209
aVWell, here we are four years later, and they're still working.
p210
aVNow you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on,
p211
aVbut that's not true. We really believed they were going to last
p212
aV90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,
p213
aVand Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust
p214
aVwould start accumulating on the surface, and after a while
p215
aVwe wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.
p216
aa(lp217
VWell, I always say it's important that you are smart,
p218
aVbut every once in a while it's good to be lucky.
p219
aVAnd that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while
p220
aVthere are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here,
p221
aVand when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.
p222
aVIt is like a brand new car that you have,
p223
aVand that's literally why they have lasted so long.
p224
aVAnd now we designed them reasonably well,
p225
aVbut that's exactly why they are lasting that long
p226
aVand still providing all the science data.
p227
aVNow, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.
p228
aVYou know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working,
p229
aVone of the front wheels, so what we are doing,
p230
aVwe are driving it backwards.
p231
aVAnd the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know,
p232
aVit's not working very well, so it's walking like this,
p233
aVand we can move the arm, you know, that way.
p234
aVBut still they are producing a lot of scientific data.
p235
aVNow, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,
p236
aVyou know, outside the science community about these Rovers,
p237
aVso I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection
p238
aVabout how these Rovers are being viewed by people
p239
aVother than the science community.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo let me go on the next short video.
p242
aVBy the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know,
p243
aVabout four years ago.
p244
aVVideo: Okay, we have parachute aligned.
p245
aVOkay, deploy the airbags. Open.
p246
aVCamera. We have a picture right now.
p247
aVYeah!
p248
aVCE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.
p249
aVVideo: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it.
p250
aVWhat is he doing?
p251
aVWhat is that?
p252
aVCE: Not too bad.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit
p255
aVabout the beauty of that planet.
p256
aVAs I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth,
p257
aVso you see sand dunes.
p258
aVIt looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken
p259
aVfrom the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me,
p260
aVbut these are pictures taken from Mars.
p261
aVBut one area which is particularly intriguing for us
p262
aVis the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole,
p263
aVbecause we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking
p264
aVand expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada.
p265
aVAnd we wanted to find out \u2014 and we see all kinds of glacial features on it.
p266
aVSo, we wanted to find out, actually,
p267
aVwhat is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it
p268
aVsome organic, you know, material.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars,
p271
aVcalled Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land
p272
aV17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now,
p273
aVso you can adjust your watch.
p274
aVSo it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here
p275
aVon the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet.
p276
aVAnd as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars,
p277
aVbut I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know,
p278
aVin 17 days, I'll show you, kind of,
p279
aVa little bit of what's going to happen.
p280
aa(lp281
VVideo: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror.
p282
aVSo the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples
p283
aVthat we put them in an oven and actually heat them
p284
aVand look what gases will come from it.
p285
aVSo this was launched about nine months ago.
p286
aVWe'll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour, and in seven minutes
p287
aVwe have to stop and touch the surface very softly
p288
aVso we don't break that lander.
p289
aa(lp290
VBen Cichy: Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission.
p291
aVIt's the first mission that's going to try to land
p292
aVnear the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission
p293
aVthat's actually going to try and reach out and touch water
p294
aVon the surface of another planet.
p295
aa(lp296
VLynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth,
p297
aVthere tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place
p298
aVwhere life could have existed on the planet in the past.
p299
aa(lp300
VErik Bailey: The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling
p301
aVat 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt
p302
aVin a soft way in a very short amount of time.
p303
aVBC: We enter the Martian atmosphere.
p304
aVWe're 70 miles above the surface of Mars.
p305
aVAnd our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell.
p306
aa(lp307
VEB: Looks kind of like an ice cream cone, more or less.
p308
aa(lp309
VBC: And on the front of it is this heat shield,
p310
aVthis saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch
p311
aVof essentially what's cork on the front of it,
p312
aVwhich is our heat shield.
p313
aVNow, this is really special cork,
p314
aVand this cork is what's going to protect us
p315
aVfrom the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience.
p316
aa(lp317
VRob Grover: Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft,
p318
aVand we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere
p319
aVto our advantage to slow us down.
p320
aVBC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour
p321
aVdown to 900 miles an hour.
p322
aa(lp323
VEB: The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun.
p324
aa(lp325
VRG: The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
p326
aa(lp327
VEB: The inside doesn't get very hot.
p328
aVIt probably gets about room temperature.
p329
aVRichard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity
p330
aVwithin which we can deploy the parachute.
p331
aa(lp332
VEB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail.
p333
aVThe fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.
p334
aVAnd that would be bad.
p335
aa(lp336
VBC: In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute,
p337
aVwe'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour
p338
aVto a relatively slow 250 miles an hour.
p339
aVWe no longer need the heat shield to protect us
p340
aVfrom the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield,
p341
aVexposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.
p342
aa(lp343
VLC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed,
p344
aVthe next step is to have the radar system begin to detect
p345
aVhow far Phoenix really is from the ground.
p346
aa(lp347
VBC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity.
p348
aVSo, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.
p349
aVBut that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.
p350
aa(lp351
VEB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide
p352
aVwhen it's going to get rid of its parachute.
p353
aa(lp354
VBC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour
p355
aVat roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet.
p356
aVThat's like taking two Empire State Buildings
p357
aVand stacking them on top of one another.
p358
aa(lp359
VEB: That's when we separate from the back shell,
p360
aVand we're now in free-fall.
p361
aVIt's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen
p362
aVin a very short amount of time.
p363
aVLC: So it's in a free-fall,
p364
aVbut it's also trying to use all of its actuators
p365
aVto make sure that it's in the right position to land.
p366
aa(lp367
VEB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself,
p368
aVand then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.
p369
aa(lp370
VBC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes
p371
aVfor a signal from Mars to get to Earth.
p372
aVAnd EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.
p373
aVSo by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started
p374
aVit'll already be over.
p375
aa(lp376
VEB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft
p377
aVso that it can land itself safely.
p378
aa(lp379
VBC: EDL is this immense, technically challenging problem.
p380
aVIt's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space
p381
aVand using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out
p382
aVhow to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.
p383
aVIt's this immensely exciting and challenging problem.
p384
aa(lp385
VCE: Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here.
p386
aVSo it will be a very tense moment, you know,
p387
aVas we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet.
p388
aa(lp389
VSo now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.
p390
aVSo we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing
p391
aVthe next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars.
p392
aVSo I thought I would go a little bit and tell you, kind of,
p393
aVthe steps we go through.
p394
aVIt's very similar to what you do when you design your product.
p395
aVAs you saw a little bit earlier,
p396
aVwhen we were doing the Phoenix one,
p397
aVwe have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.
p398
aVSo we have to study all kinds of different materials,
p399
aVthe shape that we want to do.
p400
aVIn general we don't try to please the customer here.
p401
aVWhat we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know,
p402
aVan efficient kind of machine.
p403
aa(lp404
VFirst we start by we want to have our employees
p405
aVto be as imaginative as they can.
p406
aVAnd we really love being close to the art center, because we have,
p407
aVas a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center,
p408
aVEric Nyquist, had put a series of displays,
p409
aVfar-out displays, you know,
p410
aVin our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room,
p411
aVjust to get people to think wildly about things.
p412
aVWe have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said,
p413
aVthis is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play
p414
aVwith different shapes and different designs.
p415
aa(lp416
VThen we get a little bit more serious, so we have
p417
aVwhat we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved,
p418
aVor scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties,
p419
aVknow about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes,
p420
aVall of these things, which they work in a team effort
p421
aVand actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent,
p422
aVso to see, does that meet the requirement that we need.
p423
aVOn the right, also, we have to take into account
p424
aVthe environment of the planet where we are going.
p425
aVIf you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation,
p426
aVyou know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment
p427
aVclose by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.
p428
aa(lp429
VSo just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor
p430
aVand it still has to work.
p431
aVSo these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know,
p432
aVthat we have to face.
p433
aVIf we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes.
p434
aVYou saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day,
p435
aVyou know, if that happened, so we have to test,
p436
aVbecause we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds.
p437
aVWe are coming at extremely high speeds, and we are deploying them
p438
aVto slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests.
p439
aVTo give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute
p440
aVrelative to the people standing there.
p441
aa(lp442
VNext step, we go and actually build some kind of test models
p443
aVand actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL,
p444
aVin what we call our Mars Yard.
p445
aVWe kick them, we hit them, we drop them,
p446
aVjust to make sure we understand how, where would they break.
p447
aVAnd then we back off, you know, from that point.
p448
aVAnd then we actually do the actual building and the flight.
p449
aVAnd this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car.
p450
aVThat big shield that you see outside,
p451
aVthat's a heat shield which is going to protect it.
p452
aVAnd that will be basically built over the next year,
p453
aVand it will be launched June a year from now.
p454
aVNow, in that case, because it was a very big Rover,
p455
aVwe couldn't use airbags.
p456
aVAnd I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said
p457
aVwell, that was a cool thing to have \u2014 those airbags.
p458
aVUnfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know,
p459
aVmass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass.
p460
aVSo we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with
p461
aVanother ingenious idea of how do we land it.
p462
aVAnd we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface
p463
aVbecause we didn't want to contaminate the surface;
p464
aVwe wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs.
p465
aa(lp466
VSo we came up with this ingenious idea,
p467
aVwhich is used here on Earth for helicopters.
p468
aVActually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover
p469
aVabove that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane
p470
aVwhich will take that Rover and land it down on the surface.
p471
aVHopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way.
p472
aVAnd that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist.
p473
aVWhat we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around,
p474
aVit's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks.
p475
aVSo it will have an arm which will take samples,
p476
aVput them in an oven, crush and analyze them.
p477
aVBut also, if there is something that we cannot reach
p478
aVbecause it is too high on a cliff, we have a little laser system
p479
aVwhich will actually zap the rock, evaporate some of it,
p480
aVand actually analyze what's coming from that rock.
p481
aVSo it's a little bit like "Star Wars," you know, but it's real.
p482
aVIt's real stuff.
p483
aVAnd also to help you, to help the community
p484
aVso you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover
p485
aVto actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails,
p486
aVyou know, also on Mars.
p487
aa(lp488
VSo that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know,
p489
aVfun things we are doing on Mars.
p490
aVI thought I'd go to "The Lord of the Rings" now
p491
aVand show you some of the things we have there.
p492
aVNow, "The Lord of the Rings" has two things played through it.
p493
aVOne, it's a very attractive planet \u2014
p494
aVit just has the beauty of the rings and so on.
p495
aVBut for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning,
p496
aVbecause we believe they represent, on a small scale,
p497
aVhow the Solar System actually formed.
p498
aVSome of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed,
p499
aVthat the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun,
p500
aVa lot of the dust around it created rings
p501
aVand then the particles in those rings accumulated together,
p502
aVand they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets,
p503
aVyou know, were formed.
p504
aa(lp505
VSo, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching
p506
aVour solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale,
p507
aVso it's like a test bed for it.
p508
aVSo, let me show you a little bit
p509
aVon what that Saturnian system looks like.
p510
aVFirst, I'm going to fly you over the rings.
p511
aVBy the way, all of this is real stuff.
p512
aVThis is not animation or anything like this.
p513
aVThis is actually taken from the satellite
p514
aVthat we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini.
p515
aVAnd you see the amount of detail that is in those rings,
p516
aVwhich are the particles.
p517
aVSome of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles.
p518
aVSo that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know,
p519
aVis being formed in that location.
p520
aVNow, you think that those rings are very large objects.
p521
aVYes, they are very large in one dimension;
p522
aVin the other dimension they are paper thin. Very, very thin.
p523
aVWhat you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself.
p524
aVAnd that's one of the satellites
p525
aVwhich was actually formed on that one.
p526
aVSo, think about it as a paper-thin,
p527
aVhuge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles, which is rotating.
p528
aa(lp529
VAnd we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form,
p530
aVeach one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps
p531
aVscientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this,
p532
aVand telling NASA we need more money so we can explain
p533
aVwhat these things look like, or why they formed that way.
p534
aVWell, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting.
p535
aVOne of them is called Enceladus.
p536
aVIt's a satellite which was all made of ice,
p537
aVand we measured it from orbit. Made of ice.
p538
aVBut there was something bizarre about it.
p539
aVIf you look at these stripes in here, what we call tiger stripes,
p540
aVwhen we flew over them, all of a sudden we saw
p541
aVan increase in the temperature, which said that those stripes
p542
aVare warmer than the rest of the planet.
p543
aa(lp544
VSo as we flew by away from it, we looked back. And guess what?
p545
aVWe saw geysers coming out.
p546
aVSo this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn.
p547
aVWe are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet,
p548
aVwhich indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know,
p549
aVbelow the surface.
p550
aVAnd somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers
p551
aVwhich are being, you know, emitted from it.
p552
aVAnd the reason I showed the little arrow there,
p553
aVI think that should say 30 miles,
p554
aVwe decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft
p555
aVthrough the plume of that geyser
p556
aVso we can actually measure the material that it is made of.
p557
aVThat was [unclear] also \u2014 you know, because we were worried
p558
aVabout the risk of it, but it worked pretty well.
p559
aVWe flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of
p560
aVorganic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice.
p561
aVAnd over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn,
p562
aVwe are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface
p563
aVand make more accurate measurements.
p564
aa(lp565
VNow, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention,
p566
aVand that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting,
p567
aVit's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.
p568
aVAnd that atmosphere is very \u2014 as dense as our own atmosphere.
p569
aVSo if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure
p570
aVthat you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder,
p571
aVand that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.
p572
aVNow, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material,
p573
aVso immediately people start thinking,
p574
aVcould life have evolved in that location,
p575
aVwhen you have a lot of organic material.
p576
aVSo people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call
p577
aVa pre-biotic planet, because it's so cold organic material did not get
p578
aVto the stage of becoming biological material,
p579
aVand therefore life could have evolved on it.
p580
aa(lp581
VSo it could be Earth, frozen three billion years ago
p582
aVbefore life actually started on it.
p583
aVSo that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example
p584
aVof what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe,
p585
aVwhich was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe
p586
aVas we were orbiting Saturn.
p587
aVWe dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan.
p588
aVAnd this is a picture of an area as we were coming down.
p589
aVJust looked like the coast of California for me.
p590
aVYou see the rivers which are coming along the coast,
p591
aVand you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island,
p592
aVand that looks like an ocean.
p593
aVAnd then with an instrument we have on board, a radar instrument,
p594
aVwe found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here,
p595
aVso it looks very much like Earth.
p596
aVIt looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes,
p597
aVwe know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it.
p598
aVSo it's very much like the cycle on Earth except
p599
aVbecause it's so cold, it could not be water, you know,
p600
aVbecause water would have frozen.
p601
aVWhat it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid,
p602
aV[is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane,
p603
aVsimilar to what you put in your car.
p604
aa(lp605
VSo here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth,
p606
aVbut is all made of ethane and methane and organic material.
p607
aVSo if you were on Mars \u2014 sorry, on Titan,
p608
aVyou don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline.
p609
aVYou just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it,
p610
aVand you've got your car filled up.
p611
aVOn the other hand, if you light a match
p612
aVthe whole planet will blow up.
p613
aVSo in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures.
p614
aVAnd just to kind of put us in perspective,
p615
aVthis is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft
p616
aVfrom behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun.
p617
aVThe Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call "forward scattering,"
p618
aVso it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom.
p619
aVThere is a \u2014 I'm not sure you can see it very well,
p620
aVbut on the top left, around 10 o'clock,
p621
aVthere is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth.
p622
aVYou barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it.
p623
aVSo as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know,
p624
aVjust in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center.
p625
aa(lp626
VSo thank you very much.

VCharles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife.
p5
aVDespite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently,
p6
aVthey're not brothers. (Laughter)
p7
aVAnd they were a lot of fun.
p8
aVYou know, Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VWe are going to focus on Charles today, because it is Charles' 100th birthday.
p12
aVBut when I speak of him, I'm really speaking of both of them as a team.
p13
aVHere's Charles when he was three. So he would be 100 this June.
p14
aVWe have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do.
p15
aVThe thing about their work
p16
aVis that most people come to the door of furniture \u2014
p17
aVI suspect you probably recognize this chair
p18
aVand some of the others I'm going to show you.
p19
aVBut we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top.
p20
aVThe whole thing about this, though, is that, you know, why am I showing it?
p21
aVIs it because Charles and Ray made this film?
p22
aVThis is actually a training film for a clown college that they had.
p23
aVThey also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture
p24
aVwas not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be.
p25
aVThere is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe film that we're about to see is a film they made for the Moscow World's Fair.
p28
aa(lp29
VVideo: This is the land.
p30
aVIt has many contrasts.
p31
aVIt is rough and it is flat.
p32
aVIn places it is cold.
p33
aVIn some it is hot.
p34
aVToo much rain falls on some areas,
p35
aVand not enough on others.
p36
aVBut people live on this land.
p37
aVAnd, as in Russia,
p38
aVthey are drawn together into towns and cities.
p39
aVHere is something of the way they live.
p40
aa(lp41
VEames Demetrios: Now, this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States.
p42
aVIt was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across.
p43
aVAnd it was at the height of the Cold War.
p44
aVThe Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate
p45
aVhappened about 50 feet from where this was shown.
p46
aVAnd yet, how did it start?
p47
aVYou know, commonality, the first line
p48
aVin Charles' narration was,
p49
aV"The same stars that shine down on Russia
p50
aVshine down on the United States. From the sky,
p51
aVour cities look much the same."
p52
aVIt was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything.
p53
aVAnd you can imagine, and the thing about it is,
p54
aVthat they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images
p55
aVbecause the important thing was to get the gestalt
p56
aVof what the images were about.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo that was just a little snip.
p59
aVBut the thing about Charles and Ray
p60
aVis that they were always modeling stuff.
p61
aVThey were always trying things out.
p62
aVI think one of the things I am passionate about, my grandparents work,
p63
aVI'm passionate about my work,
p64
aVbut on top of all that I'm passionate
p65
aVabout a holistic vision of design,
p66
aVwhere design is a life skill, not a professional skill.
p67
aVAnd you know, those of us with kids often want our kids to take music.
p68
aVI'm no exception.
p69
aVBut it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman.
p70
aVIt's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking.
p71
aa(lp72
VDesign is the same way. Design has to become that same way.
p73
aVAnd this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation.
p74
aVAnd Charles just checking it out there.
p75
aVSo now we're going to go through that door of furniture.
p76
aVThis is an unusual installation of airport seating.
p77
aVSo what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer
p80
aVwas essentially that of a good host,
p81
aVanticipating the needs of the guest.
p82
aVSo those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool.
p83
aVThese are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes,
p84
aValthough I don't think mistakes is the right word in design.
p85
aVIt's just the things you try out
p86
aVto kind of make it work better.
p87
aVAnd you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs.
p88
aVSome of them are kind of cool looking. It's like "Hey, why didn't they try that?"
p89
aVIt was that hands-on iterative process
p90
aVwhich is so much like vernacular design
p91
aVand folk design in traditional cultures.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd I think that's one of the commonalities between modernism
p94
aVand traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground
p95
aVas we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next 20 or 30 years.
p96
aVThe other thing that's kind of cool is that
p97
aVyou look at this and in the media when people say design,
p98
aVthey actually mean style.
p99
aVAnd I'm really here to talk about design.
p100
aVBut you know the object is just a pivot.
p101
aVIt's a pivot between a process and a system.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd this is a little film I made
p104
aVabout the making of the Eames lounge chair.
p105
aVThe design process for Charles and Ray
p106
aVnever ended in manufacturing.
p107
aVIt continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better.
p108
aVBecause it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics.
p109
aVIt's not enough to create one.
p110
aVYou've got to create a system that will work better and better.
p111
aVSo I've always liked this prototype picture.
p112
aVBecause it just kind of, you know, doesn't get any more basic than that.
p113
aVYou try things out.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis is a relatively famous chair.
p116
aVIts early version had an "X" base. That's what the collectors like.
p117
aVCharles and Ray liked this one because it was better.
p118
aVIt worked better: "H" base, much more practical.
p119
aVThis is something called a splint.
p120
aVAnd I was very touched by Dean Kamen's
p121
aVwork for the military, or for the soldiers,
p122
aVbecause Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it.
p123
aVAnd they'd been working on furniture before.
p124
aVBut doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process,
p125
aVwhich was incredibly important to them.
p126
aa(lp127
VI'm trying to show you too much,
p128
aVbecause I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images.
p129
aVThis is a house that Charles and Ray designed.
p130
aVMy sister is chasing someone else. It's not me.
p131
aVAlthough I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary, it's not me.
p132
aVAnd then this is a film, on the lower left, that Charles and Ray made.
p133
aVNow look at that plastic chair.
p134
aVThe house is 1949.
p135
aVThe chair is done in 1949.
p136
aa(lp137
VCharles and Ray,
p138
aVthey didn't obsess about style for it's own sake.
p139
aVThey didn't say, "Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy."
p140
aVThey didn't say, "Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy."
p141
aVThey focused on the need.
p142
aVThey tried to solve the design problem.
p143
aVCharles used to say, "The extent to which you have a design style
p144
aVis the extent to which you have not solved the design problem."
p145
aVIt's kind of a brutal quote.
p146
aVThis is the earlier design of that house.
p147
aVAnd again, they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype
p148
aVof a house \u2014 architecture, very expensive medium.
p149
aa(lp150
VHere's a film we've been hearing things about.
p151
aVThe "Powers of Ten" is a film they made.
p152
aVIf we watch the next clip,
p153
aVyou're going to see the first version of "Powers of Ten," upper left.
p154
aVThe familiar one on the lower right.
p155
aVThe Eames' film Tops, lower left.
p156
aVAnd a lamp that Charles designed for a church.
p157
aa(lp158
VVideo: Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies.
p159
aVThese form part of a grouping system
p160
aVmuch as the stars do.
p161
aVThey are so many and so varied that from this distance
p162
aVthey appear like the stars from Earth.
p163
aa(lp164
VED: You've seen that film, and what's so great about this
p165
aVwhole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale.
p166
aVEverybody here is coming at it from a different way.
p167
aVI want to give you one example.
p168
aVE.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants \u2014
p169
aVhe loved them, of course, and he wanted to learn more about them \u2014
p170
aVhe consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale.
p171
aVSo here is the tiny creature.
p172
aVAnd yet simply by changing the frame of reference
p173
aVit reveals so much, including what ended up being the TED Prize.
p174
aa(lp175
VModeling, they tried modeling all the time. They were always modeling things.
p176
aVAnd I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding.
p177
aVAnd I think in our family we were very lucky,
p178
aVbecause we learned about design backwards.
p179
aVDesign was not something other.
p180
aVIt was part of the business of life in general.
p181
aVIt was part of the quality of life.
p182
aVAnd here is some family pictures.
p183
aVAnd you can see why I'm down on style, with a haircut like that.
p184
aVBut anyway, (Laughter)
p185
aVI remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid.
p186
aVSo we're going to watch another film.
p187
aa(lp188
VThis is a film, the one called Toys.
p189
aVYou can see me, I have the same haircut, in the upper right corner.
p190
aVUpper left is a film they did on toy trains.
p191
aVLower right is a solar do-nothing toy.
p192
aVLower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.
p193
aVCharles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear.
p194
aVThey are often the precursor to bigger things.
p195
aVAnd these ideas \u2014 that train up there, being about the honest use of materials,
p196
aVis totally the same
p197
aVas the honest use of materials in the plywood.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd now I'm going to test you.
p200
aVThis is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old.
p201
aVSo can you read it?
p202
aVLucia angel,
p203
aVokay, eye.
p204
aa(lp205
VAudience: Saw many trains.
p206
aa(lp207
VED: Awl, also, good that the leather crafter's guild is here.
p208
aVAlso, what is he doing? Row, rowed.
p209
aVSun? No. Well is there another name for a sunrise?
p210
aVDawn, very good.
p211
aVAlso rode on one. I ...
p212
aa(lp213
VAudience: You had, I hope you had \u2014
p214
aa(lp215
VED: Now you've been to the website Dogs of Saint Louis
p216
aVin the late, in the mid-1930's,
p217
aVthen you'd know that was a Great Dane.
p218
aVSo, I hope you had a
p219
aa(lp220
VAudience: Nice time, time \u2014
p221
aa(lp222
VED: Time at.
p223
aVCitizen Kane, rose \u2014
p224
aa(lp225
VAudience: Rosebud.
p226
aa(lp227
VED: No, bud. "D"'s right. At Buddy's \u2014
p228
aa(lp229
VAudience: Party. Love.
p230
aa(lp231
VED: Okay, good.
p232
aVSo, "I saw many trains and also rode on one.
p233
aVI hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party."
p234
aVSo you guys did pretty good, cool.
p235
aVSo my mom and Charles had this great relationship
p236
aVwhere they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another.
p237
aVAnd it's all part of the, you know,
p238
aVthey used to say, "Take your pleasure seriously."
p239
aa(lp240
VThese are some images from a project of mine
p241
aVthat's called Kymaerica.
p242
aVIt's sort of an alternative universe.
p243
aVIt's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape.
p244
aVThose plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America.
p245
aVWe're about to do six in the U.K. next week.
p246
aVAnd they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world.
p247
aVSo, of course, since it's bronze it has to be true.
p248
aa(lp249
VVideo: Kymaerica with waterfalls,
p250
aVtumbling through our \u2014
p251
aa(lp252
VED: This is one of the traditional Kymaerican songs.
p253
aVAnd so we had spelling bees in Paris, Illinois.
p254
aa(lp255
VVideo: Your word is N. Carolina.
p256
aa(lp257
VGirl: Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A.
p258
aa(lp259
VED: And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site,
p260
aVbecause in the Kymaerican story
p261
aVthis is where the Parisian Diaspora started, where there embassy was.
p262
aVSo you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional
p263
aVfictional experience there.
p264
aVAnd the town has really embraced it.
p265
aVWe had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut what is really cool is that we take our visual environment
p268
aVas inevitable. And it's not.
p269
aVOther things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey.
p270
aVAnd we could have been born 100,000 years ago.
p271
aVAnd there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench.
p272
aVThey have trading cards
p273
aVand all sorts of cool things.
p274
aVAnd you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica.
p275
aVThe Tahatchabe, the great road building culture.
p276
aVA guy named Nobu Naga,
p277
aVthe so-called Japanese Columbus.
p278
aVBut now I'm going to return you to the real world.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you,
p281
aVwhich is the first film that Charles ever made.
p282
aVSo let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it.
p283
aVCranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here.
p284
aVIt's a film about Maya Gretel, a famous ceramicist, and a teacher at Cranbrook.
p285
aVAnd he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition.
p286
aVSilent. We don't have a track for it yet.
p287
aVVery simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn-by-doing thing.
p288
aVYou want to learn how to make films? Go make a movie.
p289
aVAnd you try something out.
p290
aa(lp291
VBut here is what's really great.
p292
aVSee that chair there? The orange one? That's the organic chair. 1940.
p293
aVAt the same time that Charles was doing that chair,
p294
aVhe was doing this film.
p295
aVSo my point is that this scope of vision, this holistic vision
p296
aVof design, was with them from the beginning.
p297
aVIt wasn't like "Oh, we made some chairs and got successful.
p298
aVNow we're going to do some movies."
p299
aVIt was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful.
p300
aVAnd I think that all of us in this room, as you move design forward,
p301
aVit's not about just doing one thing.
p302
aVIt's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge, beautiful commonality
p303
aVbetween design, business and the world.
p304
aVSo we're going to do the last clip.
p305
aVAnd I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now.
p306
aVSo this is Charles' voice.
p307
aa(lp308
VCharles Eames: In India, those without, and the lowest in caste,
p309
aVeat very often, particularly in southern India,
p310
aVthey eat off of a banana leaf.
p311
aVAnd those a little bit up the scale
p312
aVeat off of a sort of a low-fired ceramic dish.
p313
aVAnd a little bit higher, why they have a glaze
p314
aVon a thing they call a thali.
p315
aVIf you're up the scale a little bit more,
p316
aVwhy, a brass thali.
p317
aVAnd then things get to be a little questionable.
p318
aVThere are things like silver-plated thalis.
p319
aVAnd there is solid silver thalis.
p320
aVAnd I suppose some nut has had a
p321
aVgold thali that he's eaten off of.
p322
aa(lp323
VBut you can go beyond that.
p324
aVAnd the guys that have not only means,
p325
aVbut a certain amount of knowledge and understanding,
p326
aVgo to the next step, and they eat off a banana leaf.
p327
aVAnd I think that in these times
p328
aVwhen we fall back and regroup,
p329
aVthat somehow or other,
p330
aVthe banana leaf parable
p331
aVsort of got to get working there,
p332
aVbecause I'm not prepared to say
p333
aVthat the banana leaf that one eats off of
p334
aVis the same as the other eats off of.
p335
aVBut it is that process that has happened within the man
p336
aVthat changes the banana leaf.
p337
aa(lp338
VED: I've been looking forward to sharing that quote with you.
p339
aVBecause that's part of where we've got to get to.
p340
aVAnd I also want to share this one.
p341
aV"Beyond the age of information is the age of choices."
p342
aVAnd I really think that's where we are.
p343
aVAnd it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family
p344
aVand a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978.
p345
aVAnd part of why this stuff is important
p346
aVand all the things that we do are important,
p347
aVis that these are the ideas we need.
p348
aVAnd I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.
p349
aVThat's what we all need to do.
p350
aVDesign is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style.
p351
aVAll that great thinking needs to really get about solving
p352
aVpretty key problems.
p353
aVI really thank you for your time.
p354
aV(Applause)

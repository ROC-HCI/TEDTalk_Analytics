VSo today, I would like to talk with you
p5
aVabout bionics,
p6
aVwhich is the popular term
p7
aVfor the science of replacing part of a living organism
p8
aVwith a mechatronic device, or a robot.
p9
aVIt is essentially
p10
aVthe stuff of life meets machine.
p11
aVAnd specifically, I'd like to talk with you
p12
aVabout how bionics is evolving
p13
aVfor people with arm amputations.
p14
aa(lp15
VThis is our motivation.
p16
aVArm amputation causes a huge disability.
p17
aVI mean, the functional impairment is clear.
p18
aVOur hands are amazing instruments.
p19
aVAnd when you lose one, far less both,
p20
aVit's a lot harder to do the things
p21
aVwe physically need to do.
p22
aVThere's also a huge emotional impact.
p23
aVAnd actually, I spend as much of my time in clinic
p24
aVdealing with the emotional adjustment of patients
p25
aVas with the physical disability.
p26
aVAnd finally, there's a profound social impact.
p27
aVWe talk with our hands.
p28
aVWe greet with our hands.
p29
aVAnd we interact with the physical world with our hands.
p30
aVAnd when they're missing,
p31
aVit's a barrier.
p32
aVArm amputation is usually caused by trauma,
p33
aVwith things like industrial accidents,
p34
aVmotor vehicle collisions
p35
aVor, very poignantly, war.
p36
aVThere are also some children who are born without arms,
p37
aVcalled congenital limb deficiency.
p38
aa(lp39
VUnfortunately, we don't do great
p40
aVwith upper-limb prosthetics.
p41
aVThere are two general types.
p42
aVThey're called body-powered prostheses,
p43
aVwhich were invented just after the Civil War,
p44
aVrefined in World War I and World War II.
p45
aVHere you see a patent
p46
aVfor an arm in 1912.
p47
aVIt's not a lot different
p48
aVthan the one you see on my patient.
p49
aVThey work by harnessing shoulder power.
p50
aVSo when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable.
p51
aVAnd that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook
p52
aVor bend an elbow.
p53
aVAnd we still use them commonly,
p54
aVbecause they're very robust
p55
aVand relatively simple devices.
p56
aa(lp57
VThe state of the art
p58
aVis what we call myoelectric prostheses.
p59
aVThese are motorized devices
p60
aVthat are controlled
p61
aVby little electrical signals from your muscle.
p62
aVEvery time you contract a muscle,
p63
aVit emits a little electricity
p64
aVthat you can record with antennae or electrodes
p65
aVand use that to operate the motorized prosthesis.
p66
aVThey work pretty well
p67
aVfor people who have just lost their hand,
p68
aVbecause your hand muscles are still there.
p69
aVYou squeeze your hand, these muscles contract.
p70
aVYou open it, these muscles contract.
p71
aVSo it's intuitive, and it works pretty well.
p72
aa(lp73
VWell how about with higher levels of amputation?
p74
aVNow you've lost your arm above the elbow.
p75
aVYou're missing not only these muscles,
p76
aVbut your hand and your elbow too.
p77
aVWhat do you do?
p78
aVWell our patients have to use
p79
aVvery code-y systems
p80
aVof using just their arm muscles
p81
aVto operate robotic limbs.
p82
aVWe have robotic limbs.
p83
aVThere are several available on the market, and here you see a few.
p84
aVThey contain just a hand that will open and close,
p85
aVa wrist rotator and an elbow.
p86
aVThere's no other functions.
p87
aVIf they did, how would we tell them what to do?
p88
aa(lp89
VWe built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago
p90
aVwhere we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints
p91
aVto get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.
p92
aVAnd we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms
p93
aVthat were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes,
p94
aVthat had up to 10 different degrees of freedom
p95
aVincluding movable hands.
p96
aVBut at the end of the day,
p97
aVhow do we tell these robotic arms what to do?
p98
aVHow do we control them?
p99
aVWell we need a neural interface,
p100
aVa way to connect to our nervous system
p101
aVor our thought processes
p102
aVso that it's intuitive, it's natural,
p103
aVlike for you and I.
p104
aa(lp105
VWell the body works by starting a motor command in your brain,
p106
aVgoing down your spinal cord,
p107
aVout the nerves and to your periphery.
p108
aVAnd your sensation's the exact opposite.
p109
aVYou touch yourself, there's a stimulus
p110
aVthat comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain.
p111
aVWhen you lose your arm, that nervous system still works.
p112
aVThose nerves can put out command signals.
p113
aVAnd if I tap the nerve ending
p114
aVon a World War II vet,
p115
aVhe'll still feel his missing hand.
p116
aVSo you might say,
p117
aVlet's go to the brain
p118
aVand put something in the brain to record signals,
p119
aVor in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there.
p120
aVAnd these are very exciting research areas,
p121
aVbut it's really, really hard.
p122
aVYou have to put in
p123
aVhundreds of microscopic wires
p124
aVto record from little tiny individual neurons \u2014 ordinary fibers
p125
aVthat put out tiny signals
p126
aVthat are microvolts.
p127
aVAnd it's just too hard
p128
aVto use now and for my patients today.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo we developed a different approach.
p131
aVWe're using a biological amplifier
p132
aVto amplify these nerve signals \u2014 muscles.
p133
aVMuscles will amplify the nerve signals
p134
aVabout a thousand-fold,
p135
aVso that we can record them from on top of the skin,
p136
aVlike you saw earlier.
p137
aVSo our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.
p138
aVImagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm,
p139
aVwe still have four major nerves
p140
aVthat go down your arm.
p141
aVAnd we take the nerve away from your chest muscle
p142
aVand let these nerves grow into it.
p143
aVNow you think, "Close hand," and a little section of your chest contracts.
p144
aVYou think, "Bend elbow,"
p145
aVa different section contracts.
p146
aVAnd we can use electrodes or antennae
p147
aVto pick that up and tell the arm to move.
p148
aVThat's the idea.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo this is the first man that we tried it on.
p151
aVHis name is Jesse Sullivan.
p152
aVHe's just a saint of a man \u2014
p153
aV54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire
p154
aVand had both of his arms burnt so badly
p155
aVthey had to be amputated at the shoulder.
p156
aVJesse came to us at the RIC
p157
aVto be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them.
p158
aVI'm still using that old technology
p159
aVwith a bicycle cable on his right side.
p160
aVAnd he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.
p161
aVOn the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis
p162
aVwith those three joints,
p163
aVand he operates little pads in his shoulder
p164
aVthat he touches to make the arm go.
p165
aVAnd Jesse's a good crane operator,
p166
aVand he did okay by our standards.
p167
aa(lp168
VHe also required a revision surgery on his chest.
p169
aVAnd that gave us the opportunity
p170
aVto do targeted reinnervation.
p171
aVSo my colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian, did the surgery.
p172
aVFirst, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle,
p173
aVthen we took the arm nerves
p174
aVand just kind of had them shift down onto his chest
p175
aVand closed him up.
p176
aVAnd after about three months,
p177
aVthe nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch.
p178
aVAnd after six months, the nerves grew in well,
p179
aVand you could see strong contractions.
p180
aVAnd this is what it looks like.
p181
aVThis is what happens when Jesse thinks
p182
aVopen and close his hand,
p183
aVor bend or straighten your elbow.
p184
aVYou can see the movements on his chest,
p185
aVand those little hash marks
p186
aVare where we put our antennae, or electrodes.
p187
aVAnd I challenge anybody in the room
p188
aVto make their chest go like this.
p189
aVHis brain is thinking about his arm.
p190
aVHe has not learned how to do this with the chest.
p191
aVThere is not a learning process.
p192
aVThat's why it's intuitive.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo here's Jesse in our first little test with him.
p195
aVOn the left-hand side, you see his original prosthesis,
p196
aVand he's using those switches
p197
aVto move little blocks from one box to the other.
p198
aVHe's had that arm for about 20 months, so he's pretty good with it.
p199
aVOn the right side,
p200
aVtwo months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis \u2014
p201
aVwhich, by the way, is the same physical arm,
p202
aVjust programmed a little different \u2014
p203
aVyou can see that he's much faster
p204
aVand much smoother as he moves these little blocks.
p205
aVAnd we're only able to use three of the signals at this time.
p206
aa(lp207
VThen we had one of those little surprises in science.
p208
aVSo we're all motivated to get motor commands
p209
aVto drive robotic arms.
p210
aVAnd after a few months,
p211
aVyou touch Jesse on his chest,
p212
aVand he felt his missing hand.
p213
aVHis hand sensation grew into his chest again
p214
aVprobably because we had also taken away a lot of fat,
p215
aVso the skin was right down to the muscle
p216
aVand deinnervated, if you would, his skin.
p217
aVSo you touch Jesse here, he feels his thumb;
p218
aVyou touch it here, he feels his pinky.
p219
aVHe feels light touch
p220
aVdown to one gram of force.
p221
aVHe feels hot, cold, sharp, dull,
p222
aVall in his missing hand,
p223
aVor both his hand and his chest,
p224
aVbut he can attend to either.
p225
aVSo this is really exciting for us,
p226
aVbecause now we have a portal,
p227
aVa portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation,
p228
aVso that he might feel what he touches
p229
aVwith his prosthetic hand.
p230
aVImagine sensors in the hand
p231
aVcoming up and pressing on this new hand skin.
p232
aVSo it was very exciting.
p233
aa(lp234
VWe've also gone on
p235
aVwith what was initially our primary population
p236
aVof people with above-the-elbow amputations.
p237
aVAnd here we deinnervate, or cut the nerve away,
p238
aVjust from little segments of muscle
p239
aVand leave others alone
p240
aVthat give us our up-down signals
p241
aVand two others that will give us a hand open and close signal.
p242
aVThis was one of our first patients, Chris.
p243
aVYou see him with his original device
p244
aVon the left there after eight months of use,
p245
aVand on the right, it is two months.
p246
aVHe's about four or five times as fast
p247
aVwith this simple little performance metric.
p248
aa(lp249
VAll right.
p250
aVSo one of the best parts of my job
p251
aVis working with really great patients
p252
aVwho are also our research collaborators.
p253
aVAnd we're fortunate today
p254
aVto have Amanda Kitts come and join us.
p255
aVPlease welcome Amanda Kitts.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
VSo Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm?
p260
aa(lp261
VAmanda Kitts: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident.
p262
aVAnd I was driving home from work,
p263
aVand a truck was coming the opposite direction,
p264
aVcame over into my lane,
p265
aVran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off.
p266
aa(lp267
VTodd Kuiken: Okay, so after your amputation, you healed up.
p268
aVAnd you've got one of these conventional arms.
p269
aVCan you tell us how it worked?
p270
aa(lp271
VAK: Well, it was a little difficult,
p272
aVbecause all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep.
p273
aVSo for the simple little things like picking something up,
p274
aVI would have to bend my elbow,
p275
aVand then I would have to cocontract
p276
aVto get it to change modes.
p277
aVWhen I did that,
p278
aVI had to use my bicep
p279
aVto get the hand to close,
p280
aVuse my tricep to get it to open,
p281
aVcocontract again
p282
aVto get the elbow to work again.
p283
aa(lp284
VTK: So it was a little slow?
p285
aa(lp286
VAK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work.
p287
aVYou had to concentrate a whole lot.
p288
aa(lp289
VTK: Okay, so I think about nine months later
p290
aVthat you had the targeted reinnervation surgery,
p291
aVtook six more months to have all the reinnervation.
p292
aVThen we fit her with a prosthesis.
p293
aVAnd how did that work for you?
p294
aa(lp295
VAK: It works good.
p296
aVI was able to use my elbow
p297
aVand my hand simultaneously.
p298
aVI could work them just by my thoughts.
p299
aVSo I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that.
p300
aa(lp301
VTK: A little faster?
p302
aa(lp303
VAK: A little faster. And much more easy, much more natural.
p304
aa(lp305
VTK: Okay, this was my goal.
p306
aVFor 20 years, my goal was to let somebody
p307
aV[be] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way
p308
aVand at the same time.
p309
aVAnd we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery,
p310
aVincluding over a dozen of our wounded warriors
p311
aVin the U.S. armed services.
p312
aVThe success rate of the nerve transfers is very high.
p313
aVIt's like 96 percent.
p314
aVBecause we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle.
p315
aVAnd it provides intuitive control.
p316
aVOur functional testing, those little tests,
p317
aVall show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier.
p318
aVAnd the most important thing
p319
aVis our patients have appreciated it.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo that was all very exciting.
p322
aVBut we want to do better.
p323
aVThere's a lot of information in those nerve signals,
p324
aVand we wanted to get more.
p325
aVYou can move each finger. You can move your thumb, your wrist.
p326
aVCan we get more out of it?
p327
aVSo we did some experiments
p328
aVwhere we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes
p329
aVand then had them try to do two dozen different tasks \u2014
p330
aVfrom wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm
p331
aVto reaching for something \u2014
p332
aVand recorded this data.
p333
aVAnd then we used some algorithms
p334
aVthat are a lot like speech recognition algorithms,
p335
aVcalled pattern recognition.
p336
aVSee.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd here you can see, on Jesse's chest,
p341
aVwhen he just tried to do three different things,
p342
aVyou can see three different patterns.
p343
aVBut I can't put in an electrode
p344
aVand say, "Go there."
p345
aVSo we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick,
p346
aVcame up with this algorithm control,
p347
aVwhich Amanda can now demonstrate.
p348
aa(lp349
VAK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down.
p350
aVI have the wrist rotation
p351
aVthat goes \u2014 and it can go all the way around.
p352
aVAnd I have the wrist flexion and extension.
p353
aVAnd I also have the hand closed and open.
p354
aa(lp355
VTK: Thank you, Amanda.
p356
aVNow this is a research arm,
p357
aVbut it's made out of commercial components from here down
p358
aVand a few that I've borrowed from around the world.
p359
aVIt's about seven pounds,
p360
aVwhich is probably about what my arm would weigh
p361
aVif I lost it right here.
p362
aVObviously, that's heavy for Amanda.
p363
aVAnd in fact, it feels even heavier,
p364
aVbecause it's not glued on the same.
p365
aVShe's carrying all the weight through harnesses.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics,
p368
aVbut the control.
p369
aVSo we've developed a small microcomputer
p370
aVthat is blinking somewhere behind her back
p371
aVand is operating this
p372
aVall by the way she trains it
p373
aVto use her individual muscle signals.
p374
aVSo Amanda, when you first started using this arm,
p375
aVhow long did it take to use it?
p376
aa(lp377
VAK: It took just about probably three to four hours
p378
aVto get it to train.
p379
aVI had to hook it up to a computer,
p380
aVso I couldn't just train it anywhere.
p381
aVSo if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.
p382
aVSo now it's able to train
p383
aVwith just this little piece on the back.
p384
aVI can wear it around.
p385
aVIf it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it.
p386
aVTakes about a minute.
p387
aa(lp388
VTK: So we're really excited,
p389
aVbecause now we're getting to a clinically practical device.
p390
aVAnd that's where our goal is \u2014
p391
aVto have something clinically pragmatic to wear.
p392
aVWe've also had Amanda able to use
p393
aVsome of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.
p394
aVHere's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.
p395
aVAnd I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.
p396
aVSo Amanda, you can see,
p397
aVhas really good control.
p398
aVIt's all the pattern recognition.
p399
aVAnd it now has a hand that can do different grasps.
p400
aVWhat we do is have the patient go all the way open
p401
aVand think, "What hand grasp pattern do I want?"
p402
aVIt goes into that mode,
p403
aVand then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand.
p404
aVAmanda, how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm?
p405
aa(lp406
VAK: I was able to get four.
p407
aVI had the key grip, I had a chuck grip,
p408
aVI had a power grasp
p409
aVand I had a fine pinch.
p410
aVBut my favorite one was just when the hand was open,
p411
aVbecause I work with kids,
p412
aVand so all the time you're clapping and singing,
p413
aVso I was able to do that again, which was really good.
p414
aa(lp415
VTK: That hand's not so good for clapping.
p416
aa(lp417
VAK: Can't clap with this one.
p418
aa(lp419
VTK: All right. So that's exciting
p420
aVon where we may go with the better mechatronics,
p421
aVif we make them good enough
p422
aVto put out on the market and use in a field trial.
p423
aVI want you to watch closely.
p424
aa(lp425
V(Video) Claudia: Oooooh!
p426
aa(lp427
VTK: That's Claudia,
p428
aVand that was the first time
p429
aVshe got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.
p430
aVShe had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis
p431
aVthat then she rubbed over different surfaces,
p432
aVand she could feel different textures
p433
aVof sandpaper, different grits, ribbon cable,
p434
aVas it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin.
p435
aVShe said that when she just ran it across the table,
p436
aVit felt like her finger was rocking.
p437
aVSo that's an exciting laboratory experiment
p438
aVon how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation.
p439
aa(lp440
VBut here's another video that shows some of our challenges.
p441
aVThis is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy.
p442
aVAnd the harder he squeezes \u2014 you see a little black thing in the middle
p443
aVthat's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes.
p444
aVBut look at all the electrodes around it.
p445
aVI've got a real estate problem.
p446
aVYou're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there,
p447
aVbut our little motor's making all kinds of noise
p448
aVright next to my electrodes.
p449
aVSo we're really challenged on what we're doing there.
p450
aa(lp451
VThe future is bright.
p452
aVWe're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do.
p453
aVSo for example,
p454
aVone is to get rid of my real estate problem
p455
aVand get better signals.
p456
aVWe want to develop these little tiny capsules
p457
aVabout the size of a piece of risotto
p458
aVthat we can put into the muscles
p459
aVand telemeter out the EMG signals,
p460
aVso that it's not worrying about electrode contact.
p461
aVAnd we can have the real estate open
p462
aVto try more sensation feedback.
p463
aVWe want to build a better arm.
p464
aVThis arm \u2014 they're always made for the 50th percentile male \u2014
p465
aVwhich means they're too big for five-eighths of the world.
p466
aVSo rather than a super strong or super fast arm,

aVwe're making an arm that is \u2014
p468
aVwe're starting with,
p469
aVthe 25th percentile female \u2014
p470
aVthat will have a hand that wraps around,
p471
aVopens all the way,
p472
aVtwo degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow.
p473
aVSo it'll be the smallest and lightest
p474
aVand the smartest arm ever made.
p475
aVOnce we can do it that small,
p476
aVit's a lot easier making them bigger.
p477
aa(lp478
VSo those are just some of our goals.
p479
aVAnd we really appreciate you all being here today.
p480
aVI'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side,
p481
aVwith yesterday's theme.
p482
aVSo Amanda came jet-lagged,
p483
aVshe's using the arm,
p484
aVand everything goes wrong.
p485
aVThere was a computer spook,
p486
aVa broken wire,
p487
aVa converter that sparked.
p488
aVWe took out a whole circuit in the hotel
p489
aVand just about put on the fire alarm.
p490
aVAnd none of those problems could I have dealt with,
p491
aVbut I have a really bright research team.
p492
aVAnd thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us
p493
aVand worked really hard yesterday to fix it.
p494
aVThat's science.
p495
aVAnd fortunately, it worked today.
p496
aa(lp497
VSo thank you very much.

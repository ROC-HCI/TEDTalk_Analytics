VWhy can't we solve these problems?
p5
aVWe know what they are.
p6
aVSomething always seems to stop us.
p7
aVWhy?
p8
aVI remember March the 15th, 2000.
p9
aVThe B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.
p10
aVIn the newspaper it said
p11
aV"it was all part of a normal process."
p12
aVA little bit further on in the article
p13
aVit said "a loss that would normally take
p14
aVthe ice shelf 50-100 years to replace."
p15
aVThat same word, "normal,"
p16
aVhad two different,
p17
aValmost opposite meanings.
p18
aa(lp19
VIf we walk into the B15 iceberg
p20
aVwhen we leave here today,
p21
aVwe're going to bump into something
p22
aVa thousand feet tall,
p23
aV76 miles long,
p24
aV17 miles wide,
p25
aVand it's going to weigh two gigatons.
p26
aVI'm sorry, there's nothing normal about this.
p27
aVAnd yet I think it's this perspective of us
p28
aVas humans to look at our world
p29
aVthrough the lens of normal
p30
aVis one of the forces
p31
aVthat stops us developing real solutions.
p32
aVOnly 90 days after this,
p33
aVarguably the greatest discovery
p34
aVof the last century occurred.
p35
aVIt was the sequencing for the first time
p36
aVof the human genome.
p37
aVThis is the code that's in every single one
p38
aVof our 50 trillion cells
p39
aVthat makes us who we are and what we are.
p40
aVAnd if we just take one cell's worth
p41
aVof this code and unwind it,
p42
aVit's a meter long,
p43
aVtwo nanometers thick.
p44
aVTwo nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd I wondered,
p47
aVwhat if the answer to some of our biggest problems
p48
aVcould be found in the smallest of places,
p49
aVwhere the difference between what is
p50
aVvaluable and what is worthless
p51
aVis merely the addition or subtraction
p52
aVof a few atoms?
p53
aVAnd what
p54
aVif we could get exquisite control
p55
aVover the essence of energy,
p56
aVthe electron?
p57
aVSo I started to go around the world
p58
aVfinding the best and brightest scientists
p59
aVI could at universities
p60
aVwhose collective discoveries have the chance
p61
aVto take us there,
p62
aVand we formed a company to build
p63
aVon their extraordinary ideas.
p64
aa(lp65
VSix and a half years later,
p66
aVa hundred and eighty researchers,
p67
aVthey have some amazing developments
p68
aVin the lab,
p69
aVand I will show you three of those today,
p70
aVsuch that we can stop burning up our planet
p71
aVand instead,
p72
aVwe can generate all the energy we need
p73
aVright where we are,
p74
aVcleanly, safely, and cheaply.
p75
aVThink of the space that we spend
p76
aVmost of our time.
p77
aVA tremendous amount of energy
p78
aVis coming at us from the sun.
p79
aVWe like the light that comes into the room,
p80
aVbut in the middle of summer,
p81
aVall that heat is coming into the room
p82
aVthat we're trying to keep cool.
p83
aVIn winter, exactly the opposite is happening.
p84
aVWe're trying to heat up
p85
aVthe space that we're in,
p86
aVand all that is trying to get out through the window.
p87
aa(lp88
VWouldn't it be really great
p89
aVif the window could flick back the heat
p90
aVinto the room if we needed it
p91
aVor flick it away before it came in?
p92
aVOne of the materials that can do this
p93
aVis a remarkable material, carbon,
p94
aVthat has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction
p95
aVwhere graphite is blasted by a vapor,
p96
aVand when the vaporized carbon condenses,
p97
aVit condenses back into a different form:
p98
aVchickenwire rolled up.
p99
aVBut this chickenwire carbon,
p100
aVcalled a carbon nanotube,
p101
aVis a hundred thousand times smaller
p102
aVthan the width of one of your hairs.
p103
aVIt's a thousand times
p104
aVmore conductive than copper.
p105
aVHow is that possible?
p106
aVOne of the things about working at the nanoscale
p107
aVis things look and act very differently.
p108
aVYou think of carbon as black.
p109
aVCarbon at the nanoscale
p110
aVis actually transparent
p111
aVand flexible.
p112
aVAnd when it's in this form,
p113
aVif I combine it with a polymer
p114
aVand affix it to your window
p115
aVwhen it's in its colored state,
p116
aVit will reflect away all heat and light,
p117
aVand when it's in its bleached state
p118
aVit will let all the light and heat through
p119
aVand any combination in between.
p120
aVTo change its state, by the way,
p121
aVtakes two volts from a millisecond pulse.
p122
aVAnd once you've changed its state, it stays there
p123
aVuntil you change its state again.
p124
aa(lp125
VAs we were working on this incredible
p126
aVdiscovery at University of Florida,
p127
aVwe were told to go down the corridor
p128
aVto visit another scientist,
p129
aVand he was working
p130
aVon a pretty incredible thing.
p131
aVImagine
p132
aVif we didn't have to rely
p133
aVon artificial lighting to get around at night.
p134
aVWe'd have to see at night, right?
p135
aVThis lets you do it.
p136
aVIt's a nanomaterial, two nanomaterials,
p137
aVa detector and an imager.
p138
aVThe total width of it
p139
aVis 600 times smaller
p140
aVthan the width of a decimal place.
p141
aVAnd it takes all the infrared available at night,
p142
aVconverts it into an electron
p143
aVin the space of two small films,
p144
aVand is enabling you to play an image
p145
aVwhich you can see through.
p146
aVI'm going to show to TEDsters,
p147
aVthe first time, this operating.
p148
aVFirstly I'm going to show you
p149
aVthe transparency.
p150
aVTransparency is key.
p151
aVIt's a film that you can look through.
p152
aVAnd then I'm going to turn the lights out.
p153
aVAnd you can see, off a tiny film,
p154
aVincredible clarity.
p155
aa(lp156
VAs we were working on this, it dawned on us:
p157
aVthis is taking infrared radiation, wavelengths,
p158
aVand converting it into electrons.
p159
aVWhat if we combined it
p160
aVwith this?
p161
aVSuddenly you've converted energy
p162
aVinto an electron on a plastic surface
p163
aVthat you can stick on your window.
p164
aVBut because it's flexible,
p165
aVit can be on any surface whatsoever.
p166
aVThe power plant of tomorrow
p167
aVis no power plant.
p168
aVWe talked about generating and using.
p169
aVWe want to talk about storing energy,
p170
aVand unfortunately
p171
aVthe best thing we've got going
p172
aVis something that was developed in France
p173
aVa hundred and fifty years ago,
p174
aVthe lead acid battery.
p175
aVIn terms of dollars per what's stored,
p176
aVit's simply the best.
p177
aa(lp178
VKnowing that we're not going to put fifty of
p179
aVthese in our basements to store our power,
p180
aVwe went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas,
p181
aVand we gave them this diagram.
p182
aVIt was in actually a diner
p183
aVoutside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
p184
aVWe said, "Could you build this?"
p185
aVAnd these scientists,
p186
aVinstead of laughing at us, said, "Yeah."
p187
aVAnd what they built was eBox.
p188
aVEBox is testing new nanomaterials
p189
aVto park an electron on the outside,
p190
aVhold it until you need it,
p191
aVand then be able to release it and pass it off.
p192
aVBeing able to do that means
p193
aVthat I can generate energy
p194
aVcleanly, efficiently and cheaply
p195
aVright where I am.
p196
aVIt's my energy.
p197
aVAnd if I don't need it, I can convert it
p198
aVback up on the window
p199
aVto energy, light, and beam it,
p200
aVline of site, to your place.
p201
aVAnd for that I do not need
p202
aVan electric grid between us.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe grid of tomorrow is no grid,
p205
aVand energy, clean efficient energy,
p206
aVwill one day be free.
p207
aVIf you do this, you get the last puzzle piece,
p208
aVwhich is water.
p209
aVEach of us, every day,
p210
aVneed just eight glasses of this,
p211
aVbecause we're human.
p212
aVWhen we run out of water,
p213
aVas we are in some parts of the world
p214
aVand soon to be in other parts of the world,
p215
aVwe're going to have to get this from the sea,
p216
aVand that's going to require us to build desalination plants.
p217
aV19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend.
p218
aVThese also require tremendous amounts of energy.
p219
aVIn fact, it's going to require twice the world's
p220
aVsupply of oil to run the pumps
p221
aVto generate the water.
p222
aVWe're simply not going to do that.
p223
aVBut in a world where energy is freed
p224
aVand transmittable
p225
aVeasily and cheaply, we can take any water
p226
aVwherever we are
p227
aVand turn it into whatever we need.
p228
aa(lp229
VI'm glad to be working with
p230
aVincredibly brilliant and kind scientists,
p231
aVno kinder than
p232
aVmany of the people in the world,
p233
aVbut they have a magic look at the world.
p234
aVAnd I'm glad to see their discoveries
p235
aVcoming out of the lab and into the world.
p236
aVIt's been a long time in coming for me.
p237
aV18 years ago,
p238
aVI saw a photograph in the paper.
p239
aVIt was taken by Kevin Carter
p240
aVwho went to the Sudan
p241
aVto document their famine there.
p242
aVI've carried this photograph with me
p243
aVevery day since then.
p244
aVIt's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst.
p245
aVBy any standard this is wrong.
p246
aVIt's just wrong.
p247
aVWe can do better than this.
p248
aVWe should do better than this.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd whenever I go round
p251
aVto somebody who says,
p252
aV"You know what, you're working on something that's too difficult.
p253
aVIt'll never happen. You don't have enough money.
p254
aVYou don't have enough time.
p255
aVThere's something much more interesting around the corner,"
p256
aVI say, "Try saying that to her."
p257
aVThat's what I say in my mind. And I just say
p258
aV"thank you," and I go on to the next one.
p259
aVThis is why we have to solve our problems,
p260
aVand I know the answer as to how
p261
aVis to be able to get exquisite control
p262
aVover a building block of nature,
p263
aVthe stuff of life:
p264
aVthe simple electron.
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you.

A longtime investor, he formed Nanoholdings&nbsp; to work closely with universities and labs who are studying new forms of nano-scale energy in the four sectors of the energy economy: generation, transmission, storage and conservation. <br /><br />Nanotech as a field is still very young (the National Science Foundation says it&#39;s &quot;at a level of development similar to that of computer technology in the 1950s&quot;) and nano-energy in particular holds tremendous promise.</p><p>He says: &quot;For the first time in human history, we actually have the ability to pick up an atom and place it the way we want.

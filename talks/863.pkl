VWe're here today to announce
p5
aVthe first synthetic cell,
p6
aVa cell made by
p7
aVstarting with the digital code in the computer,
p8
aVbuilding the chromosome
p9
aVfrom four bottles of chemicals,
p10
aVassembling that chromosome in yeast,
p11
aVtransplanting it into
p12
aVa recipient bacterial cell
p13
aVand transforming that cell
p14
aVinto a new bacterial species.
p15
aVSo this is the first self-replicating species
p16
aVthat we've had on the planet
p17
aVwhose parent is a computer.
p18
aVIt also is the first species
p19
aVto have its own website
p20
aVencoded in its genetic code.
p21
aVBut we'll talk more about
p22
aVthe watermarks in a minute.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is a project that had its inception
p25
aV15 years ago
p26
aVwhen our team then \u2014
p27
aVwe called the institute TIGR \u2014
p28
aVwas involved in sequencing
p29
aVthe first two genomes in history.
p30
aVWe did Haemophilus influenzae
p31
aVand then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,
p32
aVthat of Mycoplasma genitalium.
p33
aVAnd as soon as
p34
aVwe had these two sequences
p35
aVwe thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome
p36
aVof a self-replicating species,
p37
aVcould there be even a smaller genome?
p38
aVCould we understand the basis of cellular life
p39
aVat the genetic level?
p40
aVIt's been a 15-year quest
p41
aVjust to get to the starting point now
p42
aVto be able to answer those questions,
p43
aVbecause it's very difficult to eliminate
p44
aVmultiple genes from a cell.
p45
aVYou can only do them one at a time.
p46
aVWe decided early on
p47
aVthat we had to take a synthetic route,
p48
aVeven though nobody had been there before,
p49
aVto see if we could synthesize
p50
aVa bacterial chromosome
p51
aVso we could actually vary the gene content
p52
aVto understand the essential genes for life.
p53
aVThat started our 15-year quest
p54
aVto get here.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut before we did the first experiments,
p57
aVwe actually asked
p58
aVArt Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania
p59
aVto undertake a review
p60
aVof what the risks, the challenges,
p61
aVthe ethics around creating new
p62
aVspecies in the laboratory were
p63
aVbecause it hadn't been done before.
p64
aVThey spent about two years
p65
aVreviewing that independently
p66
aVand published their results in Science in 1999.
p67
aVHam and I took two years off
p68
aVas a side project to sequence the human genome,
p69
aVbut as soon as that was done
p70
aVwe got back to the task at hand.
p71
aa(lp72
VIn 2002, we started
p73
aVa new institute,
p74
aVthe Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,
p75
aVwhere we set out two goals:
p76
aVOne, to understand
p77
aVthe impact of our technology on the environment,
p78
aVand how to understand the environment better,
p79
aVand two, to start down this process
p80
aVof making synthetic life
p81
aVto understand basic life.
p82
aVIn 2003,
p83
aVwe published our first success.
p84
aVSo Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison
p85
aVdeveloped some new methods
p86
aVfor making error-free DNA
p87
aVat a small level.
p88
aVOur first task was
p89
aVa 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,
p90
aVa virus that attacks only E. coli.
p91
aVSo that was
p92
aVthe phage phi X 174,
p93
aVwhich was chosen for historical reasons.
p94
aVIt was the first DNA phage,
p95
aVDNA virus, DNA genome
p96
aVthat was actually sequenced.
p97
aVSo once we realized
p98
aVthat we could make 5,000-base pair
p99
aVviral-sized pieces,
p100
aVwe thought, we at least have the means
p101
aVthen to try and make serially lots of these pieces
p102
aVto be able to eventually assemble them together
p103
aVto make this mega base chromosome.
p104
aVSo, substantially larger than
p105
aVwe even thought we would go initially.
p106
aa(lp107
VThere were several steps to this. There were two sides:
p108
aVWe had to solve the chemistry
p109
aVfor making large DNA molecules,
p110
aVand we had to solve the biological side
p111
aVof how, if we had this new chemical entity,
p112
aVhow would we boot it up, activate it
p113
aVin a recipient cell.
p114
aVWe had two teams working in parallel:
p115
aVone team on the chemistry,
p116
aVand the other on trying to
p117
aVbe able to transplant
p118
aVentire chromosomes
p119
aVto get new cells.
p120
aVWhen we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,
p121
aVwhich is why we chose the smallest genome.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome
p124
aVto a much larger one.
p125
aVAnd we can walk through the reasons for that,
p126
aVbut basically the small cell
p127
aVtook on the order of
p128
aVone to two months to get results from,
p129
aVwhereas the larger, faster-growing cell
p130
aVtakes only two days.
p131
aVSo there's only so many cycles we could go through
p132
aVin a year at six weeks per cycle.
p133
aVAnd you should know that basically
p134
aV99, probably 99 percent plus
p135
aVof our experiments failed.
p136
aVSo this was a debugging,
p137
aVproblem-solving scenario from the beginning
p138
aVbecause there was no recipe
p139
aVof how to get there.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo, one of the most important publications we had
p142
aVwas in 2007.
p143
aVCarole Lartigue led the effort
p144
aVto actually transplant a bacterial chromosome
p145
aVfrom one bacteria to another.
p146
aVI think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers
p147
aVthat we've ever done
p148
aVbecause it showed how dynamic life was.
p149
aVAnd we knew, once that worked,
p150
aVthat we actually had a chance
p151
aVif we could make the synthetic chromosomes
p152
aVto do the same with those.
p153
aVWe didn't know that it was going to take us
p154
aVseveral years more to get there.
p155
aa(lp156
VIn 2008,
p157
aVwe reported the complete synthesis
p158
aVof the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,
p159
aVa little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,
p160
aVbut we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.
p161
aVWe think in part, because of its slow growth
p162
aVand, in part,
p163
aVcells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms
p164
aVto keep these events from happening.
p165
aVIt turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into
p166
aVhad a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,
p167
aVand was happy to eat
p168
aVthe synthetic DNA that we gave it
p169
aVand never got transplantations.
p170
aVBut at the time, that was the largest
p171
aVmolecule of a defined structure
p172
aVthat had been made.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd so both sides were progressing,
p175
aVbut part of the synthesis
p176
aVhad to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished
p177
aVusing yeast, putting the fragments in yeast
p178
aVand yeast would assemble these for us.
p179
aVIt's an amazing step forward,
p180
aVbut we had a problem because now we had
p181
aVthe bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.
p182
aVSo in addition to doing the transplant,
p183
aVwe had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome
p184
aVout of the eukaryotic yeast
p185
aVinto a form where we could transplant it
p186
aVinto a recipient cell.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo our team developed new techniques
p189
aVfor actually growing, cloning
p190
aVentire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.
p191
aVSo we took the same mycoides genome
p192
aVthat Carole had initially transplanted,
p193
aVand we grew that in yeast
p194
aVas an artificial chromosome.
p195
aVAnd we thought this would be a great test bed
p196
aVfor learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast
p197
aVand transplant them.
p198
aVWhen we did these experiments, though,
p199
aVwe could get the chromosome out of yeast
p200
aVbut it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.
p201
aVThat little issue took the team two years to solve.
p202
aa(lp203
VIt turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell
p204
aVwas actually methylated,
p205
aVand the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,
p206
aVfrom digesting the DNA.
p207
aVSo what we found is if we took the chromosome
p208
aVout of yeast and methylated it,
p209
aVwe could then transplant it.
p210
aVFurther advances came
p211
aVwhen the team removed the restriction enzyme genes
p212
aVfrom the recipient capricolum cell.
p213
aVAnd once we had done that, now we can take
p214
aVnaked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo last fall
p217
aVwhen we published the results of that work in Science,
p218
aVwe all became overconfident
p219
aVand were sure we were only
p220
aVa few weeks away
p221
aVfrom being able to now boot up
p222
aVa chromosome out of yeast.
p223
aVBecause of the problems with
p224
aVMycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth
p225
aVabout a year and a half ago,
p226
aVwe decided to synthesize
p227
aVthe much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,
p228
aVknowing that we had the biology worked out on that
p229
aVfor transplantation.
p230
aVAnd Dan led the team for the synthesis
p231
aVof this over one-million-base pair chromosome.
p232
aVBut it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,
p233
aVand it set us back three months
p234
aVbecause we had one error
p235
aVout of over a million base pairs in that sequence.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo the team developed new debugging software,
p238
aVwhere we could test each synthetic fragment
p239
aVto see if it would grow in a background
p240
aVof wild type DNA.
p241
aVAnd we found that 10 out of the 11
p242
aV100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized
p243
aVwere completely accurate
p244
aVand compatible with
p245
aVa life-forming sequence.
p246
aVWe narrowed it down to one fragment;
p247
aVwe sequenced it
p248
aVand found just one base pair had been deleted
p249
aVin an essential gene.
p250
aVSo accuracy is essential.
p251
aVThere's parts of the genome
p252
aVwhere it cannot tolerate even a single error,
p253
aVand then there's parts of the genome
p254
aVwhere we can put in large blocks of DNA,
p255
aVas we did with the watermarks,
p256
aVand it can tolerate all kinds of errors.
p257
aVSo it took about three months to find that error
p258
aVand repair it.
p259
aVAnd then early one morning, at 6 a.m.
p260
aVwe got a text from Dan
p261
aVsaying that, now, the first blue colonies existed.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo, it's been a long route to get here:
p264
aV15 years from the beginning.
p265
aVWe felt
p266
aVone of the tenets of this field
p267
aVwas to make absolutely certain
p268
aVwe could distinguish synthetic DNA
p269
aVfrom natural DNA.
p270
aVEarly on, when you're working in a new area of science,
p271
aVyou have to think about all the pitfalls
p272
aVand things that could lead you
p273
aVto believe that you had done something when you hadn't,
p274
aVand, even worse, leading others to believe it.
p275
aVSo, we thought the worst problem would be
p276
aVa single molecule contamination
p277
aVof the native chromosome,
p278
aVleading us to believe that we actually had
p279
aVcreated a synthetic cell,
p280
aVwhen it would have been just a contaminant.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo early on, we developed the notion
p283
aVof putting in watermarks in the DNA
p284
aVto absolutely make clear
p285
aVthat the DNA was synthetic.
p286
aVAnd the first chromosome we built
p287
aVin 2008 \u2014
p288
aVthe 500,000-base pair one \u2014
p289
aVwe simply assigned
p290
aVthe names of the authors of the chromosome
p291
aVinto the genetic code,
p292
aVbut it was using just amino acid
p293
aVsingle letter translations,
p294
aVwhich leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.
p295
aVSo the team actually developed a new code
p296
aVwithin the code within the code.
p297
aVSo it's a new code
p298
aVfor interpreting and writing messages in DNA.
p299
aVNow, mathematicians have been hiding and writing
p300
aVmessages in the genetic code for a long time,
p301
aVbut it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists
p302
aVbecause, if you write long messages
p303
aVwith the code that the mathematicians developed,
p304
aVit would more than likely lead to
p305
aVnew proteins being synthesized
p306
aVwith unknown functions.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo the code that Mike Montague and the team developed
p309
aVactually puts frequent stop codons,
p310
aVso it's a different alphabet
p311
aVbut allows us to use
p312
aVthe entire English alphabet
p313
aVwith punctuation and numbers.
p314
aVSo, there are four major watermarks
p315
aVall over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.
p316
aVThe first one actually contains within it
p317
aVthis code for interpreting
p318
aVthe rest of the genetic code.
p319
aVSo in the remaining information,
p320
aVin the watermarks,
p321
aVcontain the names of, I think it's
p322
aV46 different authors
p323
aVand key contributors
p324
aVto getting the project to this stage.
p325
aVAnd we also built in
p326
aVa website address
p327
aVso that if somebody decodes the code
p328
aVwithin the code within the code,
p329
aVthey can send an email to that address.
p330
aVSo it's clearly distinguishable
p331
aVfrom any other species,
p332
aVhaving 46 names in it,
p333
aVits own web address.
p334
aVAnd we added three quotations,
p335
aVbecause with the first genome
p336
aVwe were criticized for not trying to say something more profound
p337
aVthan just signing the work.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo we won't give the rest of the code,
p340
aVbut we will give the three quotations.
p341
aVThe first is,
p342
aV"To live, to err,
p343
aVto fall, to triumph
p344
aVand to recreate life out of life."
p345
aVIt's a James Joyce quote.
p346
aVThe second quotation is, "See things not as they are,
p347
aVbut as they might be."
p348
aVIt's a quote from the "American Prometheus"
p349
aVbook on Robert Oppenheimer.
p350
aVAnd the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:
p351
aV"What I cannot build,
p352
aVI cannot understand."
p353
aVSo, because this is as much a philosophical advance
p354
aVas a technical advance in science,
p355
aVwe tried to deal with both the philosophical
p356
aVand the technical side.
p357
aa(lp358
VThe last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions
p359
aVis that the extensive work
p360
aVthat we've done \u2014
p361
aVasking for ethical review,
p362
aVpushing the envelope
p363
aVon that side as well as the technical side \u2014
p364
aVthis has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,
p365
aVin the policy community
p366
aVand at the highest levels of the federal government.
p367
aVEven with this announcement,
p368
aVas we did in 2003 \u2014
p369
aVthat work was funded by the Department of Energy,
p370
aVso the work was reviewed
p371
aVat the level of the White House,
p372
aVtrying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.
p373
aVAnd they came down on the side of open publication,
p374
aVwhich is the right approach \u2014
p375
aVwe've briefed the White House,
p376
aVwe've briefed members of Congress,
p377
aVwe've tried to take and push
p378
aVthe policy issues
p379
aVin parallel with the scientific advances.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo with that, I would like
p382
aVto open it first to the floor for questions.
p383
aVYes, in the back.
p384
aa(lp385
VReporter: Could you explain, in layman's terms,
p386
aVhow significant a breakthrough this is please?
p387
aa(lp388
VCraig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is?
p389
aVI'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.
p390
aVIt's significant to us.
p391
aVPerhaps it's a giant philosophical change
p392
aVin how we view life.
p393
aVWe actually view it as a baby step in terms of,
p394
aVit's taken us 15 years to be able
p395
aVto do the experiment
p396
aVwe wanted to do 15 years ago
p397
aVon understanding life at its basic level.
p398
aVBut we actually believe
p399
aVthis is going to be a very powerful set of tools
p400
aVand we're already starting
p401
aVin numerous avenues
p402
aVto use this tool.
p403
aa(lp404
VWe have, at the Institute,
p405
aVongoing funding now from NIH
p406
aVin a program with Novartis
p407
aVto try and use these new
p408
aVsynthetic DNA tools
p409
aVto perhaps make the flu vaccine
p410
aVthat you might get next year.
p411
aVBecause instead of taking weeks to months to make these,
p412
aVDan's team can now make these
p413
aVin less than 24 hours.
p414
aVSo when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,
p415
aVwe think we can shorten that process
p416
aVquite substantially.
p417
aVIn the vaccine area,
p418
aVSynthetic Genomics and the Institute
p419
aVare forming a new vaccine company
p420
aVbecause we think these tools can affect vaccines
p421
aVto diseases that haven't been possible to date,
p422
aVthings where the viruses rapidly evolve,
p423
aVsuch with rhinovirus.
p424
aVWouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?
p425
aVOr, more importantly, HIV,
p426
aVwhere the virus evolves so quickly
p427
aVthe vaccines that are made today
p428
aVcan't keep up
p429
aVwith those evolutionary changes.
p430
aa(lp431
VAlso, at Synthetic Genomics,
p432
aVwe've been working
p433
aVon major environmental issues.
p434
aVI think this latest oil spill in the Gulf
p435
aVis a reminder.
p436
aVWe can't see CO2 \u2014
p437
aVwe depend on scientific measurements for it
p438
aVand we see the beginning results
p439
aVof having too much of it \u2014
p440
aVbut we can see pre-CO2 now
p441
aVfloating on the waters
p442
aVand contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.
p443
aVWe need some alternatives
p444
aVfor oil.
p445
aVWe have a program with Exxon Mobile
p446
aVto try and develop new strains of algae
p447
aVthat can efficiently capture carbon dioxide
p448
aVfrom the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,
p449
aVmake new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries
p450
aVto make normal gasoline
p451
aVand diesel fuel out of CO2.
p452
aa(lp453
VThose are just a couple of the approaches
p454
aVand directions that we're taking.

VI don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out
p5
aVexactly what technology means in my life.
p6
aVI've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
p7
aVShould I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
p8
aVShould I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.
p9
aVBut at the other hand, a couple of years ago
p10
aVI gave up all of my possessions,
p11
aVsold all my technology \u2014 except for a bicycle \u2014
p12
aVand rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body,
p13
aVfuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I've since then tried to keep technology
p18
aVat arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.
p19
aVAt the same time, I run a website on cool tools,
p20
aVwhere I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.
p21
aVSo I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is
p22
aVas it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature,
p23
aVas it relates to the spiritual.
p24
aVAnd I'm not even sure we know what technology is.
p25
aVAnd one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.
p26
aVThis is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.
p27
aVIt was the suggested syllabus for dealing with
p28
aVthe Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.
p29
aa(lp30
VBefore that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.
p31
aVI like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.
p32
aVHe says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VSo it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.
p37
aVDanny Hillis actually has an update on that \u2014
p38
aVhe says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VWhich also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
p43
aVBut I was interested in another definition of technology.
p44
aVSomething, again, that went back to something more fundamental.
p45
aVSomething that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that,
p46
aVI came up with a way of framing the question
p47
aVthat seemed to work for me in my investigations.
p48
aVAnd I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
p49
aVSo this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
p50
aa(lp51
VThe question that I came up with was this question:
p52
aVwhat does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,
p53
aVdoes it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean,
p54
aVwhat are its inherent trends and biases?
p55
aVWhat are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is
p56
aVthinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.
p57
aVAnd the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,
p58
aVto look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.
p59
aVSo he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
p60
aVAnd I'm applying a similar trick to say,
p61
aVwhat if we looked at the universe in our culture
p62
aVthrough the eyes of technology? What does technology want?
p63
aVObviously, this in an incomplete question,
p64
aVjust as looking at an organism as only a gene
p65
aVis an incomplete way of looking at it.
p66
aVBut it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say,
p67
aVif we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?
p68
aVAnd I think once we ask that question
p69
aVwe have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,
p70
aVif we keep extending the origins of technology far back,
p71
aVI think we come back to life at some point.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.
p74
aVAnd like you heard from the previous speakers,
p75
aVwe don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.
p76
aVWe have really no idea.
p77
aVCraig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt
p78
aVto DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.
p79
aVBrian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try
p80
aVand actually discover all the species on Earth.
p81
aVAnd one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe
p82
aVand randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,
p83
aVjust to see what's on life. And if we did that
p84
aVwith our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,
p85
aVwe would begin to see some incredible species.
p86
aa(lp87
VThis is not on another planet. These are things
p88
aVthat are hidden away on our planet.
p89
aVThis is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.
p90
aVEach one of these organisms that we've described \u2014 that you've seen
p91
aVfrom Jamie and others, these magnificent things \u2014
p92
aVwhat they're doing, each one of them,
p93
aVis they're hacking the rules of life.
p94
aVI can't think of a single general principle of biology
p95
aVthat does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.
p96
aVEvery single thing that we can think of \u2014
p97
aVand if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits,
p98
aVyou'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,
p99
aVbecause every single one of them is hacking something about it.
p100
aVThis is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch
p101
aVthat has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.
p102
aVThis is another version of that. This is a sea dragon,
p103
aVand the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet
p104
aVswallowed the acid, has not yet taken in
p105
aVthe brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.
p106
aa(lp107
VThese are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape
p108
aVof the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,
p109
aVsix kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants,
p110
aVthe animals, the fungi, the protests \u2014 the little things \u2014 the bacteria
p111
aVand the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.
p112
aVThose are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut a more interesting way,
p115
aVthe current way to take the long view,
p116
aVis to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.
p117
aVAnd here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution
p118
aVgo over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
p119
aVSo in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart
p120
aVof all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.
p121
aVYou see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.
p122
aVBut what I like about this is it shows that
p123
aVevery living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.
p124
aVThose fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
p125
aVThey've been around just as long and gone through
p126
aVjust the same kind of trial and error to get here.
p127
aVBut we see that each one of these is actually hacking,
p128
aVand has a different way of finding out how to do life.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say,
p131
aVwhat does evolution want? There's several things that we see.
p132
aVOne of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth
p133
aVhave we ever been where we don't find life.
p134
aVWe find life at the bottom of every long-term,
p135
aVlong-distance drilling core into the center of rock
p136
aVthat we bring up \u2014 and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
p137
aVAnd wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
p138
aVMore and more of the inert matter of the globe
p139
aVis being touched and animated by life.
p140
aa(lp141
VThe second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.
p142
aVWe see the movement from a general-purpose cell
p143
aVto the more specific and specialized.
p144
aVAnd we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.
p145
aVAnd actually, we have current data that does show
p146
aVthat there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
p147
aVAnd the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
p148
aVOne of the things we see about life is that it moves
p149
aVfrom the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means
p150
aVthat there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.
p151
aVLike those chloroplast cells \u2014
p152
aVthey're completely surrounded by other life.
p153
aVThey never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.
p154
aVAnd so the general, long-term trends of evolution
p155
aVare roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization,
p156
aVcomplexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,
p157
aVOK, what are the long-term trends in technology?
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd again, my question is, what does technology want?
p160
aVAnd so, remarkably, I discovered
p161
aVthat there's also a drift toward specialization.
p162
aVThat we see there's a general hammer,
p163
aVand hammers become more and more specific over time.
p164
aVThere's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.
p165
aVThis is all the contents of a Japanese home.
p166
aVI actually had my daughter \u2014 gave her a tally counter,
p167
aVand I gave her an assignment last summer to go around
p168
aVand count the number of species of technology in our household.
p169
aVAnd it came up with 6,000 different species of products.
p170
aVI did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,
p171
aVhad only about 7,000 items in his household.
p172
aVAnd he was the King of England,
p173
aVand that was the entire wealth of England at the time.
p174
aVSo we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.
p175
aa(lp176
VThis is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out
p177
aVand he sees machines making machines. How depraved!
p178
aVWell, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.
p179
aVAnd the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.
p180
aVMost machines will only ever be in contact with other technology
p181
aVand not non-technology, or even life.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex
p184
aVis at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say,
p185
aVI was partly responsible for that cliche
p186
aVthat machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.
p187
aVSo the major trends in technology evolution actually
p188
aVare the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see
p189
aVtowards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization,
p190
aVtowards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise
p191
aVbecause if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,
p192
aVyou can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
p193
aVI suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
p194
aVThat its operations and how it works is so similar
p195
aVthat we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
p196
aVAnd so it would be sort of approximately up there,
p197
aVcoming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,
p198
aVwe would find out \u2014 we could actually approach technology in this way.
p199
aa(lp200
VThis is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould
p201
aVof the theory of punctuated equilibrium.
p202
aVBut as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.
p203
aVHe has one of the world's largest collections \u2014 about 500 of them.
p204
aVAnd he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,
p205
aVand to do a morphological analysis,
p206
aVand try to derive their genealogical history over time.
p207
aVThis is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
p208
aVBut the most interesting aspect about this
p209
aVis that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,
p210
aVthose indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet
p211
aVthat was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
p212
aVWhen something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.
p213
aVBut that does happen in technology. And it turns out
p214
aVthat that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree,
p215
aVand you can actually use it to determine
p216
aVthat this is a technological system versus a biological system.
p217
aa(lp218
VIn fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important
p219
aVthat I began to think about what happens with old technology.
p220
aVAnd it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.
p221
aVSo I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said,
p222
aV"Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?
p223
aVThey're not around anymore." Well actually, they are.
p224
aVIn fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.
p225
aVAnd this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts
p226
aVfor the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked
p227
aVis sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button \u2014
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter) \u2014
p230
aa(lp231
Vfor buying steam valves. I mean, it was just \u2014 it was really there.
p232
aVAnd so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
p233
aVMaybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog
p236
aVand I randomly went through it. And I took a page \u2014 not quite a random page \u2014
p237
aVI took a page that was actually more difficult than others
p238
aVbecause lots of the pages are filled with things
p239
aVthat are still being made. But I took this page
p240
aVand I said, how many of these things are still being made?
p241
aVAnd not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.
p242
aVAnd the answer is: all of them.
p243
aVAll of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.
p244
aVI don't know who needs a corn sheller.
p245
aVBe it corn shellers \u2014 you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills;
p246
aVall these things \u2014 and these are not, again, antiques. These are \u2014
p247
aVyou can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now,
p248
aVbrand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.
p249
aVIn fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife
p250
aVmade exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.
p251
aVIt's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact,
p252
aVwhat's important is that this information actually never died out.
p253
aVIt's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.
p254
aVAnd in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes
p255
aVuntil two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.
p256
aa(lp257
VEven when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.
p258
aVSo we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.
p259
aVWe've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.
p260
aVWe've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and
p261
aVtook what I could find, the examples in history
p262
aVwhere there have been prohibitions against technology,
p263
aVand then I tried to find out when they came back in,
p264
aVbecause they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,
p265
aVthe duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,
p266
aVis decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,
p267
aVbut you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense
p268
aVwhat culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
p269
aVThat's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.
p270
aVAnd when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing
p271
aVand add it to what the long-term trajectory \u2014 again, in life's evolution \u2014
p272
aVwe find that each case \u2014 each of the major transitions in life \u2014
p273
aVwhat they're really about is accelerating and changing
p274
aVthe way in which evolution happens.
p275
aVThey're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,
p278
aVthe evolution of evolvability.
p279
aVSo what's happening over time in life is
p280
aVthat the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,
p281
aVare increasing. And the real tricks are ways
p282
aVin which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
p283
aVAnd then what we see in the singularity,
p284
aVthat prophesized by Kurzweil and others \u2014
p285
aVhis idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
p286
aVIt's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
p287
aVSo if you have life hacking \u2014
p288
aVlife means hacking, the game of survival \u2014
p289
aVthen evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.
p290
aVAnd what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.
p291
aVThat is what we call an "infinite game."
p292
aVThat's the definition of "infinite game." A finite game is play to win,
p293
aVand an infinite game is played to keep playing.
p294
aVAnd I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.
p295
aa(lp296
VThe origins of technology was not in 1829,
p297
aVbut was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,
p298
aVand at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe
p299
aVwere compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,
p300
aVand it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.
p301
aVThat's the definition. There was no temperature.
p302
aVThere was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,
p303
aVwhat it expanded was the potential for difference.
p304
aVSo as it expands and as things expand what we have
p305
aVis the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices,
p306
aVopportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
p307
aVThose are all basically the same thing.
p308
aVAnd those are the things that technology brings us.
p309
aVThat's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.
p310
aVThat's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.
p311
aVAnd so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.
p312
aVAnd that's why we continue to grab technology \u2014
p313
aVbecause we want those things. Those things are good.
p314
aVDifferences, freedom, choices, possibilities.
p315
aVAnd each time we make a new opportunity place,
p316
aVwe're allowing a platform to make new ones.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine
p319
aVMozart before the technology of the piano was invented \u2014
p320
aVwhat a loss to society there would be.
p321
aVImagine Van Gogh being born
p322
aVbefore the technologies of cheap oil paints.
p323
aVImagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.
p324
aVSomewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born
p325
aVwhose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.
p326
aVWe have a moral obligation to invent technology
p327
aVso that every person on the globe has the potential
p328
aVto realize their true difference.
p329
aVWe want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
p330
aVThat's what technology really wants.
p331
aa(lp332
VI'm going to skip through some of the objections
p333
aVbecause I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.
p334
aVI don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be
p335
aVbad technologies. I don't have an answer to
p336
aVhow this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that
p337
aVmaybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about,
p338
aVmaybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
p339
aVMaybe in some ways
p340
aVthe fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.
p341
aVIt's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,
p342
aVbut it's a really good thing to use
p343
aVto eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.
p344
aa(lp345
VOur humanity is actually defined by technology.
p346
aVAll the things that we think that we really like about humanity
p347
aVis being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.
p348
aVThat's what we're talking about.
p349
aVYou see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
p350
aVIt's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.
p351
aVAnd it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.
p352
aVThat's what technology wants.
p353
aVAnd so when I think about what technology wants,
p354
aVI think that it has to do with the fact that every person here \u2014 and I really believe this \u2014
p355
aVevery person here has an assignment. And your assignment is
p356
aVto spend your life discovering what your assignment is.
p357
aVThat recursive nature is the infinite game.
p358
aVAnd if you play that well, you'll have other people involved,
p359
aVso even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
p360
aVThat is the infinite game. And what technology is
p361
aVis the medium in which we play that infinite game.
p362
aVAnd so I think that we should embrace technology
p363
aVbecause it is an essential part of our journey
p364
aVin finding out who we are.
p365
aa(lp366
VThank you.

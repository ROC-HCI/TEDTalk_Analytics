VSo I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo
p5
aVand Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.
p6
aVWater and electricity supply are as unpredictable
p7
aVas the weather, and growing up in these tough situations,
p8
aVat the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends
p9
aVof mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.
p10
aVThe Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.
p11
aVSo as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says,
p12
aV"Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can
p13
aVjust put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"
p14
aVAnd I sat, and I was like, "Man, I would buy that, eh?"
p15
aa(lp16
VSo I went home, and I did a little research,
p17
aVand I found some very shocking statistics.
p18
aVOver 2.5 billion people in the world today
p19
aVdo not have proper access to water and sanitation.
p20
aVFour hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa,
p21
aVand five million of them are in South Africa.
p22
aVVarious diseases thrive in this environment,
p23
aVthe most drastic of which is called trachoma.
p24
aVTrachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt
p25
aVgetting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma
p26
aVcan leave you permanently blind.
p27
aVThe disease leaves eight million people permanently blind
p28
aVeach and every year. The shocking part about it
p29
aVis that to avoid being infected with trachoma,
p30
aVall you have to do is wash your face:
p31
aVno medicine, no pills, no injections.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself,
p34
aV"Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself
p35
aVand the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least need
p36
aVto do it to try to save the world." (Laughter)
p37
aVSo with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone \u2014
p38
aVI didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much,
p39
aVexcept for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe \u2014
p40
aVI did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions,
p41
aVcreams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities \u2014
p42
aVI did high school science \u2014
p43
aVand I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper,
p44
aVand it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?
p45
aa(lp46
VSo I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.
p47
aVNow we need to get this thing into practice.
p48
aVFast forward four years later, after having written
p49
aVa 40-page business plan on the cell phone,
p50
aVhaving written my patent on the cell phone,
p51
aVI'm the youngest patent-holder in the country,
p52
aVand \u2014 ("No more bathing!") \u2014
p53
aVI can't say any more than that. (Laughter)
p54
aVI had invented DryBath, the world's first
p55
aVbath-substituting lotion.
p56
aVYou literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VSo after having tried to make it work in high school
p60
aVwith the limited resources I had, I went to university,
p61
aVmet a few people, got it into practice,
p62
aVand we have a fully functioning product that's ready
p63
aVto go to the market. It's actually available on the market.
p64
aVSo we learned a few lessons in commercializing
p65
aVand making DryBath available.
p66
aVOne of the things we learned was that poor communities
p67
aVdon't buy products in bulk.
p68
aVThey buy products on demand. A person in Alex
p69
aVdoesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette
p70
aVeach day, even though it's more expensive.
p71
aVSo we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.
p72
aVYou just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.
p73
aVAnd the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath
p74
aVfor five rand.
p75
aVAfter creating that model, we also learned a lot
p76
aVin terms of implementing the product.
p77
aVWe realized that even rich kids from the suburbs
p78
aVreally want DryBath. (Laughter)
p79
aVAt least once a week.
p80
aVAnyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters
p81
aVof water on average each time they skipped a bath,
p82
aVand also we would save two hours a day for kids
p83
aVwho are in rural areas, two hours more for school,
p84
aVtwo hours more for homework,
p85
aVtwo hours more to just be a kid.
p86
aa(lp87
VAfter seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down
p88
aVto our key value proposition,
p89
aVwhich was cleanliness and convenience.
p90
aVDryBath is a rich man's convenience
p91
aVand a poor man's lifesaver.
p92
aa(lp93
VHaving put the product into practice, we are actually now
p94
aVon the verge of selling the product
p95
aVonto a multinational to take it to the retail market,
p96
aVand one question I have for the audience today is,
p97
aVon the gravel roads of Limpopo,
p98
aVwith an allowance of 50 rand a week,
p99
aVI came up with a way for the world not to bathe.
p100
aVWhat's stopping you? (Applause)
p101
aVI'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.
p102
aVAnd another key thing that I learned a lot
p103
aVthroughout this whole process,
p104
aVlast year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.
p105
aVI'm also currently the best student entrepreneur
p106
aVin the world, the first African to get that accolade,
p107
aVand one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this
p108
aVjust because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you.
p109
aV(Applause.)

VCan I say how delighted I am to be away
p5
aVfrom the calm of Westminster and Whitehall? (Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VThis is Kim, a nine-year-old Vietnam girl,
p8
aVher back ruined by napalm,
p9
aVand she awakened the conscience of the nation of America
p10
aVto begin to end the Vietnam War.
p11
aVThis is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl
p12
aVwho launched Live Aid in the 1980s,
p13
aV15 minutes away from death when she was rescued,
p14
aVand that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world.
p15
aVThis is Tiananmen Square.
p16
aVA man before a tank became a picture
p17
aVthat became a symbol for the whole world of resistance.
p18
aVThis next is the Sudanese girl,
p19
aVa few moments from death,
p20
aVa vulture hovering in the background,
p21
aVa picture that went round the world
p22
aVand shocked people into action on poverty.
p23
aVThis is Neda, the Iranian girl
p24
aVwho was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran
p25
aVonly a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so,
p26
aVof the YouTube generation.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd what do all these pictures and events have in common?
p29
aVWhat they have in common is what we see unlocks
p30
aVwhat we cannot see.
p31
aVWhat we see unlocks the invisible ties
p32
aVand bonds of sympathy that bring us together
p33
aVto become a human community.
p34
aVWhat these pictures demonstrate is that
p35
aVwe do feel the pain of others,
p36
aVhowever distantly.
p37
aVWhat I think these pictures demonstrate
p38
aVis that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.
p39
aVWhat these pictures demonstrate is
p40
aVthat there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths,
p41
aVacross all continents \u2014 a moral sense that
p42
aVnot only do we share the pain of others,
p43
aVand believe in something bigger than ourselves
p44
aVbut we have a duty to act when we see things
p45
aVthat are wrong that need righted,
p46
aVsee injuries that need to be corrected,
p47
aVsee problems that need to be rectified.
p48
aa(lp49
VThere is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister,
p50
aVgoing to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.
p51
aVBefore he arrived Ronald Reagan said \u2014
p52
aVand he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister \u2014
p53
aV"Isn\u2019t this man a communist?"
p54
aVThe reply was, "No, Mr President, he\u2019s an anti-communist."
p55
aVAnd Ronald Reagan said, "I don\u2019t care what kind of communist he is!"
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVRonald Reagan asked Olof Palme,
p58
aVthe Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden,
p59
aV"Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?"
p60
aVHe said, "No, I want to abolish the poor."
p61
aVOur responsibility is to let everyone have the chance
p62
aVto realize their potential to the full.
p63
aa(lp64
VI believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic
p65
aVthat commands attention from people of every religion
p66
aVand every faith, and people of no faith.
p67
aVBut I think what's new is that we now have the capacity
p68
aVto communicate instantaneously across frontiers
p69
aVright across the world.
p70
aVWe now have the capacity to find common ground
p71
aVwith people who we will never meet,
p72
aVbut who we will meet through the Internet and through
p73
aVall the modern means of communication;
p74
aVthat we now have the capacity to organize
p75
aVand take collective action together
p76
aVto deal with the problem or an injustice
p77
aVthat we want to deal with;
p78
aVand I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history,
p79
aVand it is the start of what I would call
p80
aVthe creation of a truly global society.
p81
aa(lp82
VGo back 200 years when the slave trade was
p83
aVunder pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.
p84
aVThey protested across Britain.
p85
aVThey won public opinion over a long period of time.
p86
aVBut it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.
p87
aVWhat could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown
p88
aVif they were able to use the modern means of communication
p89
aVto win people\u2019s hearts and minds?
p90
aa(lp91
VOr if you take Eglantyne Jebb,
p92
aVthe woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.
p93
aVShe was so appalled by what was happening in Austria
p94
aVas a result of the First World War and what was happening to children
p95
aVwho were part of the defeated families of Austria,
p96
aVthat in Britain she wanted to take action,
p97
aVbut she had to go house to house,
p98
aVleaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally
p99
aVin the Royal Albert Hall
p100
aVthat eventually gave birth to Save the Children,
p101
aVan international organization that is now fully recognized
p102
aVas one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.
p103
aVBut what more could she have done
p104
aVif she\u2019d had the modern means of communications available to her
p105
aVto create a sense that the injustice that people saw
p106
aVhad to be acted upon immediately?
p107
aa(lp108
VNow look at what\u2019s happened in the last 10 years.
p109
aVIn Philippines in 2001, President Estrada \u2014
p110
aVa million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime,
p111
aVeventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text." (Laughter)
p112
aVThen you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.
p113
aVBecause people were able to take mobile phone photographs
p114
aVof what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible
p115
aVfor that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.
p116
aVOr take Burma and the monks that were blogging out,
p117
aVa country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs
p118
aVtold the world that there was a repression,
p119
aVmeaning that lives were being lost
p120
aVand people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi,
p121
aVwho is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world,
p122
aVhad to be listened to.
p123
aVThen take Iran itself, and what people are doing today:
p124
aVfollowing what happened to Neda,
p125
aVpeople who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people
p126
aVwho are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging,
p127
aVchanging their address to Tehran, Iran,
p128
aVand making it difficult for the security services.
p129
aa(lp130
VTake, therefore, what modern technology is capable of:
p131
aVthe power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications
p132
aVand our ability to organize internationally.
p133
aa(lp134
VThat, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community
p135
aVto fundamentally change the world.
p136
aVForeign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites;
p137
aVit\u2019s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging,
p138
aVwho are communicating with each other around the world.
p139
aV200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.
p140
aV150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours
p141
aVwas how young people, children, had the right to education.
p142
aV100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.
p143
aV50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.
p144
aVIn the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid,
p145
aVdiscrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality;
p146
aVall these have come under pressure
p147
aVbecause of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.
p148
aa(lp149
VI was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London.
p150
aVI was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday
p151
aVand for the creation of new resources for his foundation.
p152
aVI was sitting next to Nelson Mandela \u2014 I was very privileged to do so \u2014
p153
aVwhen Amy Winehouse came onto the stage. (Laughter)
p154
aVAnd Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer
p155
aVand I was explaining to him at the time who she was.
p156
aVAmy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.
p157
aVMy husband too has spent a long time in prison."
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aVNelson Mandela then went down to the stage
p160
aVand he summarized the challenge for us all.
p161
aVHe said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain
p162
aVof challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.
p163
aVHe said that there was a greater challenge ahead,
p164
aVthe challenge of poverty, of climate change \u2014 global challenges
p165
aVthat needed global solutions
p166
aVand needed the creation of a truly global society.
p167
aa(lp168
VWe are the first generation which is in a position to do this.
p169
aVCombine the power of a global ethic
p170
aVwith the power of our ability to communicate
p171
aVand organize globally, with the challenges that we now face,
p172
aVmost of which are global in their nature.
p173
aVClimate change cannot be solved in one country,
p174
aVbut has got to be solved by the world working together.
p175
aVA financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved
p176
aVby America alone or Europe alone;
p177
aVit needed the world to work together.
p178
aVTake the problems of security and terrorism and, equally,
p179
aVthe problem of human rights and development:
p180
aVthey cannot be solved by Africa alone;
p181
aVthey cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.
p182
aVWe cannot solve these problems unless we work together.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo the great project of our generation, it seems to me,
p185
aVis to build for the first time, out of a global ethic
p186
aVand our global ability to communicate
p187
aVand organize together, a truly global society,
p188
aVbuilt on that ethic but with institutions
p189
aVthat can serve that global society and make for a different future.
p190
aVWe have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.
p191
aVTake climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous
p192
aVthat we have a situation
p193
aVwhere we know that there is a climate change problem,
p194
aVwhere we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources
p195
aVto the poorest countries to deal with that,
p196
aVwhen we want to create a global carbon market,
p197
aVbut there is no global institution
p198
aVthat people have been able to agree upon
p199
aVto deal with this problem?
p200
aVOne of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months
p201
aVis an agreement that there will be
p202
aVa global environmental institution
p203
aVthat is able to deal
p204
aVwith the problems of persuading the whole of the world
p205
aVto move along a climate-change agenda.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VOne of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough
p210
aVis that we have got to persuade people around the world
p211
aVto change their behavior as well,
p212
aVso you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility
p213
aVacross the generations.
p214
aVTake the financial crisis.
p215
aVIf people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York
p216
aVor starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.
p217
aVIf people can find that that sub-prime product
p218
aVhas been transferred across nations
p219
aVmany, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland
p220
aVor the rest in Britain,
p221
aVand people's ordinary savings are affected by it,
p222
aVthen you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.
p223
aVYou need in the long run for stability, for economic growth,
p224
aVfor jobs, as well as for financial stability,
p225
aVglobal economic institutions that make sure
p226
aVthat growth to be sustained has to be shared,
p227
aVand are built on the principle
p228
aVthat the prosperity of this world is indivisible.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions
p231
aVthat reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility,
p232
aVnot the ideas that were the basis
p233
aVof the last stage of financial development over these recent years.
p234
aVThen take development and take the partnership we need between our countries
p235
aVand the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.
p236
aVWe do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future,
p237
aVand yet, out of people\u2019s desire for a global ethic
p238
aVand a global society that can be done.
p239
aa(lp240
VI have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.
p241
aVThis is a country of six and a half million people,
p242
aVbut it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses;
p243
aVit has 120 midwives.
p244
aVYou cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people
p245
aVwith such limited resources.
p246
aa(lp247
VOr take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania,
p248
aVa girl called Miriam.
p249
aVShe was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS,
p250
aVher mother and then her father.
p251
aVShe was an AIDS orphan being handed
p252
aVacross different extended families to be cared for.
p253
aVShe herself was suffering from HIV;
p254
aVshe was suffering from tuberculosis.
p255
aVI met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.
p256
aVWhen you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven
p257
aVis looking forward to the future,
p258
aVbut there was an unreachable sadness in that girl\u2019s eyes
p259
aVand if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment,
p260
aVI believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund
p261
aVwould be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.
p262
aa(lp263
VWe must then build a proper relationship between the richest and
p264
aVthe poorest countries
p265
aVbased on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves
p266
aVwith the investment that is necessary in their agriculture,
p267
aVso that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.
p268
aa(lp269
VTake the problems of human rights and
p270
aVthe problems of security in so many countries around the world.
p271
aVBurma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy,
p272
aVin Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily
p273
aVfor wars that we could prevent.
p274
aVIn the Rwanda Children's Museum,
p275
aVthere is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy
p276
aVand the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost
p277
aVin the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.
p278
aa(lp279
VThere is a photograph of a boy called David.
p280
aVBeside that photograph there is the information about his life.
p281
aVIt said "David, age 10."
p282
aVDavid: ambition to be a doctor.
p283
aVFavorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?
p284
aVMaking people laugh.
p285
aVHow did he die?
p286
aVTortured to death.
p287
aVLast words said to his mother who was also tortured to death:
p288
aV"Don't worry. The United Nations are coming."
p289
aVAnd we never did.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd that young boy believed our promises
p292
aVthat we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda,
p293
aVand we never did.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo we have got to create in this world also
p296
aVinstitutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid,
p297
aVbut also for reconstruction and security
p298
aVfor some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.
p299
aVSo my argument today is basically this.
p300
aVWe have the means by which we could create a truly global society.
p301
aVThe institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.
p302
aVThat global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary
p303
aVfor these institutions to work,
p304
aVbut we should not lose the chance in this generation,
p305
aVin this decade in particular, with President Obama in America,
p306
aVwith other people working with us around the world,
p307
aVto create global institutions for the environment,
p308
aVand for finance,
p309
aVand for security and for development,
p310
aVthat make sense of our responsibility to other peoples,
p311
aVour desire to bind the world together, and
p312
aVour need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.
p313
aa(lp314
VIt is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences,
p315
aVpeople used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech."
p316
aVBut it is said that in Ancient Greece
p317
aVwhen Demosthenes spoke to his audiences,
p318
aVpeople turned to each other and didn\u2019t say "Great speech."
p319
aVThey said, "Let's march."
p320
aVWe should be marching towards a global society.
p321
aVThank you.

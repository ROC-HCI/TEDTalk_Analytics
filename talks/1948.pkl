aV["The Long Reach of Reason"]
p7
aVCabbie: Twenty-two dollars. Steven Pinker: Okay.
p8
aVRebecca Newberger Goldstein: Reason  appears to have fallen on hard times:
p9
aVPopular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth
p10
aVand political discourse has become a race
p11
aVto the bottom.
p12
aVWe're living in an era of scientific creationism,
p13
aV9/11 conspiracy theories, psychic hotlines,
p14
aVand a resurgence of religious fundamentalism.
p15
aVPeople who think too well
p16
aVare often accused of elitism,
p17
aVand even in the academy,
p18
aVthere are attacks on logocentrism,
p19
aVthe crime of letting logic dominate our thinking.
p20
aa(lp21
VSP: But is this necessarily a bad thing?
p22
aVPerhaps reason is overrated.
p23
aVMany pundits have argued that a good heart
p24
aVand steadfast moral clarity
p25
aVare superior to triangulations of overeducated policy wonks,
p26
aVlike the best and brightest and that dragged us
p27
aVinto the quagmire of Vietnam.
p28
aVAnd wasn't it reason that gave us the means
p29
aVto despoil the planet
p30
aVand threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction?
p31
aVIn this way of thinking,  it's character and conscience,
p32
aVnot cold-hearted calculation, that will save us.
p33
aVBesides, a human being is not a brain on a stick.
p34
aVMy fellow psychologists have shown that we're led
p35
aVby our bodies and our emotions
p36
aVand use our puny powers of reason
p37
aVmerely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact.
p38
aa(lp39
VRNG: How could a reasoned argument logically entail
p40
aVthe ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments?
p41
aVLook, you're trying to persuade us of reason's impotence.
p42
aVYou're not threatening us or bribing us,
p43
aVsuggesting that we resolve the issue
p44
aVwith a show of hands or a beauty contest.
p45
aVBy the very act of trying to reason us into your position,
p46
aVyou're conceding reason's potency.
p47
aVReason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be.
p48
aVYou show up for that debate
p49
aVand you've already lost it.
p50
aa(lp51
VSP: But can reason lead us in directions
p52
aVthat are good or decent or moral?
p53
aVAfter all, you pointed out that reason
p54
aVis just a means to an end,
p55
aVand the end depends on the reasoner's passions.
p56
aVReason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony
p57
aVif the reasoner wants peace and harmony,
p58
aVbut it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife
p59
aVif the reasoner delights in conflict and strife.
p60
aVCan reason force the reasoner to want
p61
aVless cruelty and waste?
p62
aa(lp63
VRNG: All on its own, the answer is no,
p64
aVbut it doesn't take much to switch it to yes.
p65
aVYou need two conditions:
p66
aVThe first is that reasoners all care
p67
aVabout their own well-being.
p68
aVThat's one of the passions that has to be present
p69
aVin order for reason to go to work,
p70
aVand it's obviously present in all of us.
p71
aVWe all care passionately
p72
aVabout our own well-being.
p73
aVThe second condition is that reasoners
p74
aVare members of a community of reasoners
p75
aVwho can affect one another's well-being,
p76
aVcan exchange messages,
p77
aVand comprehend each other's reasoning.
p78
aVAnd that's certainly true of our gregarious
p79
aVand loquatious species,
p80
aVwell endowed with the instinct for language.
p81
aa(lp82
VSP: Well, that sounds good in theory,
p83
aVbut has it worked that way in practice?
p84
aVIn particular, can it explain
p85
aVa momentous historical development
p86
aVthat I spoke about five years ago here at TED?
p87
aVNamely, we seem to be getting more humane.
p88
aVCenturies ago, our ancestors would burn cats alive
p89
aVas a form of popular entertainment.
p90
aVKnights waged constant war on each other
p91
aVby trying to kill as many of each other's peasants as possible.
p92
aVGovernments executed people for frivolous reasons,
p93
aVlike stealing a cabbage
p94
aVor criticizing the royal garden.
p95
aVThe executions were designed to be as prolonged
p96
aVand as painful as possible, like crucifixion,
p97
aVdisembowelment, breaking on the wheel.
p98
aVRespectable people kept slaves.
p99
aVFor all our flaws, we have abandoned
p100
aVthese barbaric practices.
p101
aa(lp102
VRNG: So, do you think it's human nature that's changed?
p103
aa(lp104
VSP: Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts
p105
aVthat can erupt in violence,
p106
aVlike greed, tribalism, revenge, dominance, sadism.
p107
aVBut we also have instincts that can steer us away,
p108
aVlike self-control, empathy, a sense of fairness,
p109
aVwhat Abraham Lincoln called
p110
aVthe better angels of our nature.
p111
aa(lp112
VRNG: So if human nature didn't change,
p113
aVwhat invigorated those better angels?
p114
aa(lp115
VSP: Well, among other things,
p116
aVour circle of empathy expanded.
p117
aVYears ago, our ancestors would feel the pain
p118
aVonly of their family and people in their village.
p119
aVBut with the expansion of literacy and travel,
p120
aVpeople started to sympathize
p121
aVwith wider and wider circles,
p122
aVthe clan, the tribe, the nation, the race,
p123
aVand perhaps eventually, all of humanity.
p124
aa(lp125
VRNG: Can hard-headed scientists
p126
aVreally give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy?
p127
aa(lp128
VSP: They can and do.
p129
aVNeurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain
p130
aVthat respond to other people's actions
p131
aVthe same way they respond to our own.
p132
aVEmpathy emerges early in life,
p133
aVperhaps before the age of one.
p134
aVBooks on empathy have become bestsellers,
p135
aVlike "The Empathic Civilization"
p136
aVand "The Age of Empathy."
p137
aa(lp138
VRNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't?
p139
aVBut all on its own, it's a feeble instrument
p140
aVfor making moral progress.
p141
aVFor one thing, it's innately biased
p142
aVtoward blood relations, babies
p143
aVand warm, fuzzy animals.
p144
aVAs far as empathy is concerned,
p145
aVugly outsiders can go to hell.
p146
aVAnd even our best attempts to work up sympathy
p147
aVfor those who are unconnected with us
p148
aVfall miserably short, a sad truth about human nature
p149
aVthat was pointed out by Adam Smith.
p150
aa(lp151
VAdam Smith: Let us suppose that the great empire
p152
aVof China was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake,
p153
aVand let us consider how a  man of humanity in Europe
p154
aVwould react on receiving intelligence
p155
aVof this dreadful calamity.
p156
aVHe would, I imagine, first of all express very strongly
p157
aVhis sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people.
p158
aVHe would make many melancholy reflections
p159
aVupon the precariousness of human life,
p160
aVand when all these humane sentiments
p161
aVhad been once fairly expressed,
p162
aVhe would pursue his business or his pleasure
p163
aVwith the same ease and tranquility
p164
aVas if no such accident had happened.
p165
aVIf he was to lose his little finger tomorrow,
p166
aVhe would not sleep tonight,
p167
aVbut provided he never saw them,
p168
aVhe would snore with the most profound security
p169
aVover the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren.
p170
aa(lp171
VSP: But if empathy wasn't enough to make us more humane,
p172
aVwhat else was there?
p173
aa(lp174
VRNG: Well, you didn't mention what might be
p175
aVone of our most effective better angels: reason.
p176
aVReason has muscle.
p177
aVIt's reason that provides the push to widen
p178
aVthat circle of empathy.
p179
aVEvery one of the humanitarian developments
p180
aVthat you mentioned originated with thinkers
p181
aVwho gave reasons for why some practice
p182
aVwas indefensible.
p183
aVThey demonstrated that the way people treated
p184
aVsome particular group of others
p185
aVwas logically inconsistent
p186
aVwith the way they insisted on being treated themselves.
p187
aa(lp188
VSP: Are you saying that reason
p189
aVcan actually change people's minds?
p190
aVDon't people just stick with whatever conviction
p191
aVserves their interests
p192
aVor conforms to the culture that they grew up in?
p193
aa(lp194
VRNG: Here's a fascinating fact about us:
p195
aVContradictions bother us,
p196
aVat least when we're forced to confront them,
p197
aVwhich is just another way of saying
p198
aVthat we are susceptible to reason.
p199
aVAnd if you look at the history of moral progress,
p200
aVyou can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments
p201
aVto changes in the way that we actually feel.
p202
aVTime and again, a thinker would lay out an argument
p203
aVas to why some practice was indefensible,
p204
aVirrational, inconsistent with values already held.
p205
aVTheir essay would go viral,
p206
aVget translated into many languages,
p207
aVget debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons,
p208
aVand at dinner parties,
p209
aVand influence leaders, legislators,
p210
aVpopular opinion.
p211
aVEventually their conclusions get absorbed
p212
aVinto the common sense of decency,
p213
aVerasing the tracks of the original argument
p214
aVthat had gotten us there.
p215
aVFew of us today feel any need to put forth
p216
aVa rigorous philosophical argument
p217
aVas to why slavery is wrong
p218
aVor public hangings or beating children.
p219
aVBy now, these things just feel wrong.
p220
aVBut just those arguments had to be made,
p221
aVand they were, in centuries past.
p222
aa(lp223
VSP: Are you saying that people needed
p224
aVa step-by-step argument to grasp
p225
aVwhy something might be a wee bit wrong
p226
aVwith burning heretics at the stake?
p227
aa(lp228
VRNG: Oh, they did. Here's the French theologian
p229
aVSebastian Castellio making the case.
p230
aa(lp231
VSebastian Castellio: Calvin says that he's certain,
p232
aVand other sects say that they are.
p233
aVWho shall be judge?
p234
aVIf the matter is certain, to whom is it so? To Calvin?
p235
aVBut then, why does he write so many books about manifest truth?
p236
aVIn view of the uncertainty, we must define heretics
p237
aVsimply as one with whom we disagree.
p238
aVAnd if then we are going to kill heretics,
p239
aVthe logical outcome will be a war of extermination,
p240
aVsince each is sure of himself.
p241
aa(lp242
VSP: Or with hideous punishments
p243
aVlike breaking on the wheel?
p244
aa(lp245
VRNG: The prohibition in our constitution
p246
aVof cruel and unusual punishments
p247
aVwas a response to a pamphlet circulated in 1764
p248
aVby the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria.
p249
aa(lp250
VCesare Beccaria: As punishments become more cruel,
p251
aVthe minds of men, which like fluids
p252
aValways adjust to the level of the objects
p253
aVthat surround them, become hardened,
p254
aVand after a hundred years of cruel punishments,
p255
aVbreaking on the wheel causes no more fear
p256
aVthan imprisonment previously did.
p257
aVFor a punishment to achieve its objective,
p258
aVit is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts
p259
aVoutweighs the benefit that derives from the crime,
p260
aVand into this calculation ought to be factored
p261
aVthe certainty of punishment
p262
aVand the loss of the good
p263
aVthat the commission of the crime will produce.
p264
aVEverything beyond this is superfluous,
p265
aVand therefore tyrannical.
p266
aa(lp267
VSP: But surely antiwar movements depended
p268
aVon mass demonstrations
p269
aVand catchy tunes by folk singers
p270
aVand wrenching photographs of the human costs of war.
p271
aa(lp272
VRNG: No doubt, but modern anti-war movements
p273
aVreach back to a long chain of thinkers
p274
aVwho had argued as to why we ought to mobilize
p275
aVour emotions against war,
p276
aVsuch as the father of modernity, Erasmus.
p277
aa(lp278
VErasmus: The advantages derived from peace
p279
aVdiffuse themselves far and wide,
p280
aVand reach great numbers,
p281
aVwhile in war, if anything turns out happily,
p282
aVthe advantage redounds only to a few,
p283
aVand those unworthy of reaping it.
p284
aVOne man's safety is owing to the destruction of another.
p285
aVOne man's prize is derived from the plunder of another.
p286
aVThe cause of rejoicings made by one side
p287
aVis to the other a cause of mourning.
p288
aVWhatever is unfortunate in war,
p289
aVis severely so indeed,
p290
aVand whatever, on the contrary,
p291
aVis called good fortune,
p292
aVis a savage and a cruel good fortune,
p293
aVan ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another's woe.
p294
aa(lp295
VSP: But everyone knows that the movement
p296
aVto abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion.
p297
aVIt was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers,
p298
aVand it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel
p299
aV"Uncle Tom's Cabin" became a bestseller.
p300
aa(lp301
VRNG: But the ball got rolling a century before.
p302
aVJohn Locke bucked the tide of millennia
p303
aVthat had regarded the practice as perfectly natural.
p304
aVHe argued that it was inconsistent
p305
aVwith the principles of rational government.
p306
aa(lp307
VJohn Locke: Freedom of men under government
p308
aVis to have a standing rule to live by
p309
aVcommon to everyone of that society
p310
aVand made by the legislative power erected in it,
p311
aVa liberty to follow my own will in all things
p312
aVwhere that rule prescribes not,
p313
aVnot to be subject to the inconstant,
p314
aVuncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man,
p315
aVas freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint
p316
aVbut the law of nature.
p317
aa(lp318
VSP: Those words sound familiar.
p319
aVWhere have I read them before? Ah, yes.
p320
aa(lp321
VMary Astell: If absolute sovereignty  be not necessary
p322
aVin a state, how comes it to be so in a family?
p323
aVOr if in a family, why not in a state?
p324
aVSince no reason can be alleged for the one
p325
aVthat will not hold more strongly for the other,
p326
aVif all men are born free,
p327
aVhow is it that all women are born slaves,
p328
aVas they must be if being subjected
p329
aVto the inconstant, uncertain,
p330
aVunknown, arbitrary will of men
p331
aVbe the perfect condition of slavery?
p332
aa(lp333
VRNG: That sort of co-option
p334
aVis all in the job description of reason.
p335
aVOne movement for the expansion of rights
p336
aVinspires another because the logic is the same,
p337
aVand once that's hammered home,
p338
aVit becomes increasingly uncomfortable
p339
aVto ignore the inconsistency.
p340
aVIn the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement
p341
aVinspired the movements for women's rights,
p342
aVchildren's rights, gay rights and even animal rights.
p343
aVBut fully two centuries before,
p344
aVthe Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham
p345
aVhad exposed the indefensibility
p346
aVof customary practices such as
p347
aVthe cruelty to animals.
p348
aa(lp349
VJeremy Bentham: The question is not, can they reason,
p350
aVnor can they talk, but can they suffer?
p351
aa(lp352
VRNG: And the persecution of homosexuals.
p353
aa(lp354
VJB: As to any primary mischief,
p355
aVit's evident that it produces no pain in anyone.
p356
aVOn the contrary, it produces pleasure.
p357
aVThe partners are both willing.
p358
aVIf either of them be unwilling,
p359
aVthe act is an offense,
p360
aVtotally different in its nature of effects.
p361
aVIt's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape.
p362
aVAs to the any danger exclusive of pain,
p363
aVthe danger, if any, much consist
p364
aVin the tendency of the example.
p365
aVBut what is the tendency of this example?
p366
aVTo dispose others to engage in the same practices.
p367
aVBut this practice produces not pain of any kind
p368
aVto anyone.
p369
aa(lp370
VSP: Still, in every case, it took at least a century
p371
aVfor the arguments of these great thinkers
p372
aVto trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole.
p373
aVIt kind of makes you wonder about our own time.
p374
aVAre there practices that we engage in
p375
aVwhere the arguments against them are there for all to see
p376
aVbut nonetheless we persist in them?
p377
aa(lp378
VRNG: When our great grandchildren look back at us,
p379
aVwill they be as appalled by some of our practices
p380
aVas we are by our slave-owning, heretic-burning,
p381
aVwife-beating, gay-bashing ancestors?
p382
aa(lp383
VSP: I'm sure everyone here could think of an example.
p384
aa(lp385
VRNG: I opt for the mistreatment of animals
p386
aVin factory farms.
p387
aa(lp388
VSP: The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders
p389
aVand the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons.
p390
aa(lp391
VRNG: Scrimping on donations to life-saving charities
p392
aVin the developing world.
p393
aa(lp394
VSP: The possession of nuclear weapons.
p395
aa(lp396
VRNG: The appeal to religion to justify
p397
aVthe otherwise unjustifiable,
p398
aVsuch as the ban on contraception.
p399
aa(lp400
VSP: What about religious faith in general?
p401
aa(lp402
VRNG: Eh, I'm not holding my breath.
p403
aa(lp404
VSP: Still, I have become convinced
p405
aVthat reason is a better angel
p406
aVthat deserves the greatest credit
p407
aVfor the moral progress our species has enjoyed
p408
aVand that holds out the greatest hope
p409
aVfor continuing moral progress in the future.
p410
aa(lp411
VRNG: And if, our friends,
p412
aVyou detect a flaw in this argument,
p413
aVjust remember you'll be depending on reason
p414
aVto point it out.
p415
aa(lp416
VThank you. SP: Thank you.

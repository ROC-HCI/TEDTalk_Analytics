VWe're going to begin in 1964.
p5
aVBob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career
p6
aVis just reaching its pinnacle.
p7
aVHe's been christened the voice of a generation,
p8
aVand he's churning out classic songs
p9
aVat a seemingly impossible rate,
p10
aVbut there's a small minority of dissenters, and they claim
p11
aVthat Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.
p12
aa(lp13
V2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse,
p14
aVtakes the Beatles' "White Album,"
p15
aVcombines it with Jay-Z's "The Black Album"
p16
aVto create "The Grey Album."
p17
aV"The Grey Album" becomes an immediate sensation online,
p18
aVand the Beatles' record company sends out countless
p19
aVcease-and-desist letters for "unfair competition
p20
aVand dilution of our valuable property."
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, "The Grey Album" is a remix.
p23
aVIt is new media created from old media.
p24
aVIt was made using these three techniques:
p25
aVcopy, transform and combine.
p26
aVIt's how you remix. You take existing songs,
p27
aVyou chop them up, you transform the pieces,
p28
aVyou combine them back together again,
p29
aVand you've got a new song, but that new song
p30
aVis clearly comprised of old songs.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut I think these aren't just the components of remixing.
p33
aVI think these are the basic elements of all creativity.
p34
aVI think everything is a remix,
p35
aVand I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity.
p36
aa(lp37
VAll right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear
p38
aVwhere some of Dylan's early songs came from.
p39
aVWe'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.
p40
aa(lp41
VAll right, this first song you're going to hear
p42
aVis "Nottamun Town." It's a traditional folk tune.
p43
aVAfter that, you'll hear Dylan's "Masters of War."
p44
aa(lp45
VJean Ritchie: \u266b In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, \u266b
p46
aa(lp47
V\u266b not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down. \u266b
p48
aa(lp49
VBob Dylan: \u266b Come you masters of war, \u266b
p50
aa(lp51
V\u266b you that build the big guns, you that build the death planes, \u266b
p52
aa(lp53
V\u266b You that build all the bombs. \u266b
p54
aa(lp55
VKirby Ferguson: Okay, so that's the same basic melody
p56
aVand overall structure. This next one is "The Patriot Game,"
p57
aVby Dominic Behan. Alongside that,
p58
aVyou're going to hear "With God on Our Side," by Dylan.
p59
aa(lp60
VDominic Behan: \u266b Come all ye young rebels, \u266b
p61
aa(lp62
V\u266b and list while I sing, \u266b
p63
aa(lp64
V\u266b for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. \u266b
p65
aa(lp66
VBD: \u266b Oh my name it is nothin', \u266b
p67
aa(lp68
V\u266b my age it means less, \u266b
p69
aa(lp70
V\u266b the country I come from is called the Midwest. \u266b
p71
aa(lp72
VKF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits
p73
aVhe must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it,
p74
aVthen when the song kind of bubbled back up
p75
aVin his brain, he just thought it was his song.
p76
aa(lp77
VLast one, this is "Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons,"
p78
aVanother traditional folk tune.
p79
aVAlongside that is "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."
p80
aVThis one's more about the lyric.
p81
aa(lp82
VPaul Clayton: \u266b It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, \u266b
p83
aa(lp84
V\u266b darlin', and it ain't no use to sit and cry now. \u266b
p85
aa(lp86
VBD: \u266b It ain\u2019t no use to sit and wonder why, babe, \u266b
p87
aa(lp88
V\u266b if you don't know by now, \u266b
p89
aa(lp90
V\u266b and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, \u266b
p91
aa(lp92
V\u266b it'll never do somehow. \u266b
p93
aa(lp94
VKF: Okay, now, there's a lot of these.
p95
aVIt's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies
p96
aVDylan used in his early songs were borrowed.
p97
aVThis is pretty typical among folk singers.
p98
aVHere's the advice of Dylan's idol, Woody Guthrie.
p99
aa(lp100
V"The worlds are the important thing.
p101
aVDon't worry about tunes. Take a tune,
p102
aVsing high when they sing low,
p103
aVsing fast when they sing slow, and you've got a new tune."
p104
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p105
aVAnd that's, that's what Guthrie did right here,
p106
aVand I'm sure you all recognize the results.
p107
aV(Music)
p108
aVWe know this tune, right? We know it?
p109
aVActually you don't.
p110
aVThat is "When the World's on Fire," a very old melody,
p111
aVin this case performed by the Carter Family.
p112
aVGuthrie adapted it into "This Land Is Your Land."
p113
aVSo, Bob Dylan, like all folk singers, he copied melodies,
p114
aVhe transformed them, he combined them with new lyrics
p115
aVwhich were frequently their own concoction
p116
aVof previous stuff.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, American copyright and patent laws run counter
p119
aVto this notion that we build on the work of others.
p120
aVInstead, these laws and laws around the world
p121
aVuse the rather awkward analogy of property.
p122
aVNow, creative works may indeed be kind of like property,
p123
aVbut it's property that we're all building on,
p124
aVand creations can only take root and grow
p125
aVonce that ground has been prepared.
p126
aa(lp127
VHenry Ford once said, "I invented nothing new.
p128
aVI simply assembled the discoveries of other men
p129
aVbehind whom were centuries of work.
p130
aVProgress happens when all the factors that make for it
p131
aVare ready and then it is inevitable."
p132
aa(lp133
V2007. The iPhone makes it debut.
p134
aVApple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early,
p135
aVbut its time was approaching because its core technology
p136
aVhad been evolving for decades.
p137
aVThat's multi-touch, controlling a device
p138
aVby touching its display.
p139
aVHere is Steve Jobs introducing multi-touch
p140
aVand making a rather foreboding joke.
p141
aa(lp142
VSteve Jobs: And we have invented a new technology
p143
aVcalled multi-touch.
p144
aVYou can do multi-fingered gestures on it,
p145
aVand boy have we patented it. (Laughter)
p146
aVKF: Yes. And yet, here is multi-touch in action.
p147
aVThis is at TED, actually, about a year earlier.
p148
aVThis is Jeff Han, and, I mean, that's multi-touch.
p149
aVIt's the same animal, at least.
p150
aVLet's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this
p151
aVnewfangled technology.
p152
aVJeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything \u2014
p153
aVisn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton
p154
aVhave been playing around with it in the '80s.
p155
aVThe technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here
p156
aVright now other than probably its newfound accessibility.
p157
aVKF: So he's pretty frank about it not being new.
p158
aVSo it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented.
p159
aVIt's the small parts of it that are,
p160
aVand it's in these small details where
p161
aVwe can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent:
p162
aVto promote the progress of useful arts.
p163
aa(lp164
VHere is the first ever slide-to-unlock.
p165
aVThat is all there is to it. Apple has patented this.
p166
aVIt's a 28-page software patent, but I will summarize
p167
aVwhat it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone
p168
aVby sliding an icon with your finger. (Laughter)
p169
aVI'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, can someone own this idea?
p172
aVNow, back in the '80s, there were no software patents,
p173
aVand it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface.
p174
aVWhat if they had patented pop-up menus,
p175
aVscrollbars, the desktop with icons that look like folders
p176
aVand sheets of paper?
p177
aVWould a young and inexperienced Apple
p178
aVhave survived the legal assault from a much larger
p179
aVand more mature company like Xerox?
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, this idea that everything is a remix might sound
p182
aVlike common sense until you're the one getting remixed.
p183
aVFor example ...
p184
aVSJ: I mean, Picasso had a saying.
p185
aVHe said, "Good artists copy. Great artists steal."
p186
aVAnd we have, you know,
p187
aValways been shameless about stealing great ideas.
p188
aVKF: Okay, so that's in '96. Here's in 2010.
p189
aV"I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product."
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aV"I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this." (Laughter)
p192
aVOkay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion
p196
aVWe have a strong predisposition towards protecting
p197
aVwhat we feel is ours.
p198
aVWe have no such aversion towards copying
p199
aVwhat other people have, because we do that nonstop.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo here's the sort of equation we're looking at.
p202
aVWe've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property,
p203
aVplus massive rewards or settlements
p204
aVin infringement cases, plus huge legal fees
p205
aVto protect yourself in court,
p206
aVplus cognitive biases against perceived loss.
p207
aVAnd the sum looks like this.
p208
aVThat is the last four years of lawsuits
p209
aVin the realm of smartphones.
p210
aVIs this promoting the progress of useful arts?
p211
aa(lp212
V1983. Bob Dylan is 42 years old, and his time
p213
aVin the cultural spotlight is long since past.
p214
aVHe records a song called "Blind Willie McTell,"
p215
aVnamed after the blues singer, and the song
p216
aVis a voyage through the past, through a much darker time,
p217
aVbut a simpler one, a time when musicians like Willie McTell
p218
aVhad few illusions about what they did.
p219
aV"I jump 'em from other writers
p220
aVbut I arrange 'em my own way."
p221
aa(lp222
VI think this is mostly what we do.
p223
aVOur creativity comes from without, not from within.
p224
aVWe are not self-made. We are dependent on one another,
p225
aVand admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace
p226
aVof mediocrity and derivativeness.
p227
aVIt's a liberation from our misconceptions,
p228
aVand it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves
p229
aVand to simply begin.
p230
aa(lp231
VThank you so much. It was an honor to be here.
p232
aVThank you. (Applause)
p233
aVThank you. Thank you. (Applause)
p234
aVThank you. (Applause)

In Kirby Ferguson&#39;s view, any piece of art that contains a recognizable reference to another work--a quote from a lyric, a borrowed riff, a filmic homage. Which makes almost everything a remix, from a Led Zeppelin song to a classic film from George Lucas. His deeply researched and insanely fun four-part web series, &quot;<a href=\\"http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Everything Is a Remix</a>,&quot; dives into the question: Is remixing a form of creativity, a production of the new on the shoulders of what precedes it, or is it just copying? He comes out firmly on the side of creativity, calling for protections for people who, with good intentions, weave together bits of existing culture into something fresh and relevant.</p><p>His next web series is called &quot;<a href=\\"http://www.everythingisaremix.info/this-is-not-a-conspiracy-theory-is-on\\" target=\\"_blank\\">This Is Not a Conspiracy Theory</a>,&quot; an attempt to explore how US politics came to be the way they are.</p>", "slug": "kirby_ferguson", "whotheyare": "Kirby Ferguson explores creativity in a world where \\"everything is a remix.\\"", "whatotherssay": "It\'s interesting, well researched, and visually delightful.", "id": 1310, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/a1d073fb494edb20d30cc43f38fd1245fc815d7f_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Embrace the remix", "take_action": null, "comments": 14488, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/299866e3b1fb965838ab3b88597dc25e740f1cad_1600x1200.jpg", "description": "Nothing is original, says Kirby Ferguson, creator of Everything is a Remix.

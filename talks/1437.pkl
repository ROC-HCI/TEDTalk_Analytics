VWhat you have here
p5
aVis an electronic cigarette.
p6
aVIt's something that, since it was invented a year or two ago,
p7
aVhas given me untold happiness.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VA little bit of it, I think, is the nicotine,
p12
aVbut there's something much bigger than that;
p13
aVwhich is, ever since, in the UK, they banned smoking in public places,
p14
aVI've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd the reason, I only worked out just the other day,
p19
aVwhich is: when you go to a drinks party and you stand up
p20
aVand hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people,
p21
aVyou don't actually want to spend all the time talking.
p22
aVIt's really, really tiring.
p23
aVSometimes you just want to stand there silently, alone with your thoughts.
p24
aVSometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window.
p25
aVNow the problem is, when you can't smoke,
p26
aVif you stand and stare out of the window on your own,
p27
aVyou're an antisocial, friendless idiot.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VIf you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette,
p32
aVyou're a fucking philosopher.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
V(Applause)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo the power of reframing things
p39
aVcannot be overstated.
p40
aVWhat we have is exactly the same thing, the same activity,
p41
aVbut one of them makes you feel great
p42
aVand the other one, with just a small change of posture,
p43
aVmakes you feel terrible.
p44
aVAnd I think one of the problems with classical economics is,
p45
aVit's absolutely preoccupied with reality.
p46
aVAnd reality isn't a particularly good guide to human happiness.
p47
aVWhy, for example, are pensioners much happier
p48
aVthan the young unemployed?
p49
aVBoth of them, after all, are in exactly the same stage of life.
p50
aVYou both have too much time on your hands and not much money.
p51
aVBut pensioners are reportedly very, very happy,
p52
aVwhereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed.
p53
aVThe reason, I think, is that the pensioners believe
p54
aVthey've chosen to be pensioners,
p55
aVwhereas the young unemployed feel it's been thrust upon them.
p56
aa(lp57
VIn England, the upper-middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly,
p58
aVbecause they've re-branded unemployment.
p59
aVIf you're an upper-middle-class English person,
p60
aVyou call unemployment "a year off."
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd that's because having a son who's unemployed in Manchester
p65
aVis really quite embarrassing.
p66
aVBut having a son who's unemployed in Thailand
p67
aVis really viewed as quite an accomplishment.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VBut actually, the power to re-brand things \u2014
p72
aVto understand that our experiences, costs, things
p73
aVdon't actually much depend on what they really are,
p74
aVbut on how we view them \u2014
p75
aVI genuinely think can't be overstated.
p76
aa(lp77
VThere's an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to,
p78
aVwhere you put two dogs in a box
p79
aVand the box has an electric floor.
p80
aVEvery now and then, an electric shock is applied to the floor,
p81
aVwhich pains the dogs.
p82
aVThe only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box.
p83
aVAnd when it nuzzles the button, the electric shock stops.
p84
aVThe other dog doesn't have the button.
p85
aVIt's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box,
p86
aVbut it has no control over the circumstances.
p87
aVGenerally, the first dog can be relatively content.
p88
aVThe second dog lapses into complete depression.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness
p91
aVthan the sense of control we feel over our lives.
p92
aVIt's an interesting question.
p93
aVWe ask the question \u2014 the whole debate in the Western world
p94
aVis about the level of taxation.
p95
aVBut I think there's another debate to be asked,
p96
aVwhich is the level of control we have over our tax money,
p97
aVthat what costs us 10 pounds in one context can be a curse;
p98
aVwhat costs us 10 pounds in a different context, we may actually welcome.
p99
aVYou know, pay 20,000 pounds in tax toward health,
p100
aVand you're merely feeling a mug.
p101
aVPay 20,000 pounds to endow a hospital ward,
p102
aVand you're called a philanthropist.
p103
aVI'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VSo I'll give you one in return: how you frame things really matters.
p108
aVDo you call it "The bailout of Greece"?
p109
aVOr "The bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece"?
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VBecause they are actually the same thing.
p114
aVWhat you call them actually affects how you react to them,
p115
aVviscerally and morally.
p116
aVI think psychological value is great, to be absolutely honest.
p117
aVOne of my great friends, a professor called Nick Chater,
p118
aVwho's the Professor of Decision Sciences in London,
p119
aVbelieves we should spend far less time looking into humanity's hidden depths,
p120
aVand spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows.
p121
aVI think that's true, actually.
p122
aVI think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do.
p123
aVBut what we don't have is a really good model of human psychology \u2014
p124
aVat least pre-Kahneman, perhaps,
p125
aVwe didn't have a really good model of human psychology
p126
aVto put alongside models of engineering, of neoclassical economics.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo people who believed in psychological solutions didn't have a model.
p129
aVWe didn't have a framework.
p130
aVThis is what Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger calls
p131
aV"a latticework on which to hang your ideas."
p132
aVEngineers, economists, classical economists
p133
aVall had a very, very robust existing latticework
p134
aVon which practically every idea could be hung.
p135
aVWe merely have a collection of random individual insights
p136
aVwithout an overall model.
p137
aVAnd what that means is that, in looking at solutions,
p138
aVwe've probably given too much priority
p139
aVto what I call technical engineering solutions, Newtonian solutions,
p140
aVand not nearly enough to the psychological ones.
p141
aa(lp142
VYou know my example of the Eurostar:
p143
aVsix million pounds spent
p144
aVto reduce the journey time between Paris and London
p145
aVby about 40 minutes.
p146
aVFor 0.01 percent of this money, you could have put wi-fi on the trains,
p147
aVwhich wouldn't have reduced the duration of the journey,
p148
aVbut would have improved its enjoyment and its usefulness far more.
p149
aVFor maybe 10 percent of the money,
p150
aVyou could have paid all of the world's top male and female supermodels
p151
aVto walk up and down the train handing out free Château Pétrus
p152
aVto all the passengers.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VYou'd still have five million pounds in change,
p157
aVand people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VWhy were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically?
p162
aVI think it's because there's an imbalance,
p163
aVan asymmetry in the way we treat creative, emotionally driven psychological ideas
p164
aVversus the way we treat rational, numerical, spreadsheet-driven ideas.
p165
aVIf you're a creative person, I think, quite rightly,
p166
aVyou have to share all your ideas for approval
p167
aVwith people much more rational than you.
p168
aVYou have to go in and have a cost-benefit analysis,
p169
aVa feasibility study, an ROI study and so forth.
p170
aVAnd I think that's probably right.
p171
aVBut this does not apply the other way around.
p172
aVPeople who have an existing framework \u2014
p173
aVan economic framework, an engineering framework \u2014
p174
aVfeel that, actually, logic is its own answer.
p175
aVWhat they don't say is, "Well, the numbers all seem to add up,
p176
aVbut before I present this idea, I'll show it to some really crazy people
p177
aVto see if they can come up with something better."
p178
aVAnd so we \u2014 artificially, I think \u2014 prioritize
p179
aVwhat I'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas.
p180
aa(lp181
VAn example of a great psychological idea:
p182
aVthe single best improvement in passenger satisfaction
p183
aVon the London Underground,
p184
aVper pound spent,
p185
aVcame when they didn't add any extra trains,
p186
aVnor change the frequency of the trains;
p187
aVthey put dot matrix display boards on the platforms \u2014
p188
aVbecause the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality,
p189
aVits duration,
p190
aVbut on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait.
p191
aVWaiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock
p192
aVis less frustrating and irritating
p193
aVthan waiting four minutes, knuckle biting, going,
p194
aV"When's this train going to damn well arrive?"
p195
aa(lp196
VHere's a beautiful example of a psychological solution
p197
aVdeployed in Korea.
p198
aVRed traffic lights have a countdown delay.
p199
aVIt's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments.
p200
aVWhy?
p201
aVBecause road rage, impatience and general irritation are massively reduced
p202
aVwhen you can actually see the time you have to wait.
p203
aVIn China, not really understanding the principle behind this,
p204
aVthey applied the same principle to green traffic lights \u2014
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
Vwhich isn't a great idea.
p209
aVYou're 200 yards away, you realize you've got five seconds to go,
p210
aVyou floor it.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VThe Koreans, very assiduously, did test both.
p215
aVThe accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights;
p216
aVit goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights.
p217
aa(lp218
VThis is all I'm asking for, really, in human decision making,
p219
aVis the consideration of these three things.
p220
aVI'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other.
p221
aVI'm merely saying that when you solve problems,
p222
aVyou should look at all three of these equally,
p223
aVand you should seek as far as possible
p224
aVto find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle.
p225
aa(lp226
VIf you actually look at a great business,
p227
aVyou'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play.
p228
aVReally successful businesses \u2014
p229
aVGoogle is a great, great technological success,
p230
aVbut it's also based on a very good psychological insight:
p231
aVpeople believe something that only does one thing
p232
aVis better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else.
p233
aVIt's an innate thing called "goal dilution."
p234
aVAyelet Fishbach has written a paper about this.
p235
aa(lp236
VEverybody else at the time of Google, more or less,
p237
aVwas trying to be a portal.
p238
aVYes, there's a search function, but you also have weather,
p239
aVsports scores, bits of news.
p240
aVGoogle understood that if you're just a search engine,
p241
aVpeople assume you're a very, very good search engine.
p242
aVAll of you know this, actually, from when you go in to buy a television,
p243
aVand in the shabbier end of the row of flat-screen TVs,
p244
aVyou can see, are these rather despised things
p245
aVcalled "combined TV and DVD players."
p246
aVAnd we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things,
p247
aVbut we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go, "Uck.
p248
aVIt's probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a DVD player."
p249
aVSo we walk out of the shops with one of each.
p250
aVGoogle is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one.
p251
aa(lp252
VI propose that we can use psychology to solve problems
p253
aVthat we didn't even realize were problems at all.
p254
aVThis is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics.
p255
aVDon't give them 24 white pills;
p256
aVgive them 18 white pills and six blue ones
p257
aVand tell them to take the white pills first,
p258
aVand then take the blue ones.
p259
aVIt's called "chunking."
p260
aVThe likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater
p261
aVwhen there is a milestone somewhere in the middle.
p262
aa(lp263
VOne of the great mistakes, I think, of economics
p264
aVis it fails to understand that what something is \u2014
p265
aVwhether it's retirement, unemployment, cost \u2014
p266
aVis a function, not only of its amount, but also its meaning.
p267
aa(lp268
VThis is a toll crossing in Britain.
p269
aVQuite often queues happen at the tolls.
p270
aVSometimes you get very, very severe queues.
p271
aVYou could apply the same principle, actually,
p272
aVto the security lanes in airports.
p273
aVWhat would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money
p274
aVto cross the bridge,
p275
aVbut go through a lane that's an express lane?
p276
aVIt's not an unreasonable thing to do;
p277
aVit's an economically efficient thing to do.
p278
aVTime means more to some people than others.
p279
aVIf you're waiting trying to get to a job interview,
p280
aVyou'd patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the fast lane.
p281
aVIf you're on the way to visit your mother-in-law,
p282
aVyou'd probably prefer \u2014
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
Vyou'd probably prefer to stay on the left.
p287
aa(lp288
VThe only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution,
p289
aVpeople hate it ...
p290
aVbecause they think you're deliberately creating delays at the bridge
p291
aVin order to maximize your revenue,
p292
aVand, "Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your incompetence?"
p293
aVOn the other hand, change the frame slightly
p294
aVand create charitable yield management,
p295
aVso the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company,
p296
aVit goes to charity ...
p297
aVand the mental willingness to pay completely changes.
p298
aVYou have a relatively economically efficient solution,
p299
aVbut one that actually meets with public approval
p300
aVand even a small degree of affection,
p301
aVrather than being seen as bastardy.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo where economists make the fundamental mistake
p304
aVis they think that money is money.
p305
aVActually, my pain experienced in paying five pounds
p306
aVis not just proportionate to the amount,
p307
aVbut where I think that money is going.
p308
aVAnd I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy.
p309
aVIt could revolutionize the public services.
p310
aVIt could actually change things quite significantly.
p311
aa(lp312
V[Ludwig Von Mises is my hero.]
p313
aa(lp314
VHere's a guy you all need to study.
p315
aVHe's an Austrian School economist
p316
aVwho was first active in the first half of the 20th century in Vienna.
p317
aVWhat was interesting about the Austrian School
p318
aVis they actually grew up alongside Freud.
p319
aVAnd so they're predominantly interested in psychology.
p320
aVThey believed that there was a discipline called praxeology,
p321
aVwhich is a prior discipline to the study of economics.
p322
aVPraxeology is the study of human choice, action and decision-making.
p323
aVI think they're right.
p324
aVI think the danger we have in today's world
p325
aVis we have the study of economics
p326
aVconsiders itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology.
p327
aVBut as Charlie Munger says, "If economics isn't behavioral,
p328
aVI don't know what the hell is."
p329
aa(lp330
VVon Mises, interestingly, believes economics is just a subset of psychology.
p331
aVI think he just refers to economics
p332
aVas "the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity."
p333
aVBut Von Mises, among many other things,
p334
aVI think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation
p335
aVfor the value of marketing, the value of perceived value
p336
aVand the fact that we should treat it as being absolutely equivalent
p337
aVto any other kind of value.
p338
aa(lp339
VWe tend to, all of us, even those of us who work in marketing,
p340
aVthink of value in two ways:
p341
aVthe real value, which is when you make something in a factory
p342
aVor provide a service,
p343
aVand then there's a dubious value,
p344
aVwhich you create by changing the way people look at things.
p345
aVVon Mises completely rejected this distinction.
p346
aVAnd he used this following analogy:
p347
aVhe referred to strange economists called the French physiocrats,
p348
aVwho believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land.
p349
aVSo if you're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer,
p350
aVyou created true value.
p351
aVIf however, you bought some wool from the shepherd
p352
aVand charged a premium for converting it into a hat,
p353
aVyou weren't actually creating value,
p354
aVyou were exploiting the shepherd.
p355
aa(lp356
VNow, Von Mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake
p357
aVwith regard to advertising and marketing.
p358
aVHe says if you run a restaurant,
p359
aVthere is no healthy distinction to be made
p360
aVbetween the value you create by cooking the food
p361
aVand the value you create by sweeping the floor.
p362
aVOne of them creates, perhaps, the primary product \u2014
p363
aVthe thing we think we're paying for \u2014
p364
aVthe other one creates a context within which we can enjoy
p365
aVand appreciate that product.
p366
aVAnd the idea that one of them should have priority over the other
p367
aVis fundamentally wrong.
p368
aa(lp369
VTry this quick thought experiment:
p370
aVimagine a restaurant that serves Michelin-starred food,
p371
aVbut where the restaurant smells of sewage
p372
aVand there's human feces on the floor.
p373
aa(lp374
V(Laughter)
p375
aa(lp376
VThe best thing you can do there to create value
p377
aVis not actually to improve the food still further,
p378
aVit's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor.
p379
aVAnd it's vital we understand this.
p380
aa(lp381
VIf that seems like a sort of strange, abstruse thing \u2014
p382
aVin the UK, the post office had a 98 percent success rate
p383
aVat delivering first-class mail the next day.
p384
aVThey decided this wasn't good enough,
p385
aVand they wanted to get it up to 99.
p386
aVThe effort to do that almost broke the organization.
p387
aVIf, at the same time, you'd gone and asked people,
p388
aV"What percentage of first-class mail arrives the next day?"
p389
aVthe average answer, or the modal answer, would have been "50 to 60 percent."
p390
aVNow, if your perception is much worse than your reality,
p391
aVwhat on earth are you doing trying to change the reality?
p392
aVThat's like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks.
p393
aVWhat you need to do is, first of all, tell people
p394
aVthat 98 percent of first-class mail gets there the next day.
p395
aVThat's pretty good.
p396
aVI would argue, in Britain, there's a much better frame of reference,
p397
aVwhich is to tell people that more first-class mail arrives the next day
p398
aVin the UK than in Germany, because generally, in Britain,
p399
aVif you want to make us happy about something,
p400
aVjust tell us we do it better than the Germans.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Laughter)
p403
aa(lp404
V(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VChoose your frame of reference and the perceived value,
p407
aVand therefore, the actual value is completely transformed.
p408
aVIt has to be said of the Germans
p409
aVthat the Germans and the French are doing a brilliant job
p410
aVof creating a united Europe.
p411
aVThe only thing they didn't expect is they're uniting Europe
p412
aVthrough a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans.
p413
aVBut I'm British; that's the way we like it.
p414
aa(lp415
V(Laughter)
p416
aa(lp417
VWhat you'll also notice is that, in any case,
p418
aVour perception is leaky.
p419
aVWe can't tell the difference between the quality of the food
p420
aVand the environment in which we consume it.
p421
aVAll of you will have seen this phenomenon
p422
aVif you have your car washed or valeted.
p423
aVWhen you drive away, your car feels as if it drives better.
p424
aa(lp425
V(Laughter)
p426
aa(lp427
VAnd the reason for this \u2014
p428
aVunless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil
p429
aVand performing work which I'm not paying him for and I'm unaware of \u2014
p430
aVis because perception is, in any case, leaky.
p431
aa(lp432
VAnalgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain
p433
aVthan analgesics that are not branded.
p434
aVI don't just mean through reported pain reduction \u2014
p435
aVactual measured pain reduction.
p436
aVAnd so perception actually is leaky in any case.
p437
aVSo if you do something that's perceptually bad in one respect,
p438
aVyou can damage the other.
p439
aa(lp440
VThank you very much.

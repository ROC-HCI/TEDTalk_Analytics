VTED is 30.
p5
aVThe world wide web is celebrating this month
p6
aVits 25th anniversary.
p7
aVSo I've got a question for you.
p8
aVLet's talk about the journey, mainly about the future.
p9
aVLet's talk about the state.
p10
aVLet's talk about what sort of a web we want.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo 25 years ago, then, I was working at CERN.
p13
aVI got permission in the end after about a year
p14
aVto basically do it as a side project.
p15
aVI wrote the code.
p16
aVI was I suppose the first user.
p17
aVThere was a lot of concern
p18
aVthat people didn't want to pick it up
p19
aVbecause it would be too complicated.
p20
aVA lot of persuasion, a lot of wonderful
p21
aVcollaboration with other people,
p22
aVand bit by bit, it worked.
p23
aVIt took off. It was pretty cool.
p24
aVAnd in fact, a few years later in 2000,
p25
aVfive percent of the world population
p26
aVwere using the world wide web.
p27
aVIn 2007, seven years later, 17 percent.
p28
aVIn 2008, we formed the World Wide Web Foundation
p29
aVpartly to look at that
p30
aVand worry about that figure.
p31
aVAnd now here we are in 2014,
p32
aVand 40 percent of the world
p33
aVare using the world wide web, and counting.
p34
aVObviously it's increasing.
p35
aa(lp36
VI want you to think about both sides of that.
p37
aVOkay, obviously to anybody here at TED,
p38
aVthe first question you ask is, what can we do
p39
aVto get the other 60 percent on board
p40
aVas quickly as possible?
p41
aVLots of important things. Obviously it's going to be around mobile.
p42
aVBut also, I want you to think about the 40 percent,
p43
aVbecause if you're sitting there yourself
p44
aVsort of with a web-enabled life,
p45
aVyou don't remember things anymore,
p46
aVyou just look them up,
p47
aVthen you may feel that it's been a success
p48
aVand we can all sit back.
p49
aVBut in fact, yeah, it's been a success,
p50
aVthere's lots of things, Khan Academy
p51
aVfor crying out loud, there's Wikipedia,
p52
aVthere's a huge number of free e-books
p53
aVthat you can read online,
p54
aVlots of wonderful things for education,
p55
aVthings in many areas.
p56
aVOnline commerce has in some cases
p57
aVcompletely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether,
p58
aVmade types of commerce available
p59
aVwhich weren't available at all before.
p60
aVCommerce has been almost universally affected.
p61
aVGovernment, not universally affected,
p62
aVbut very affected, and on a good day,
p63
aVlots of open data, lots of e-government,
p64
aVso lots of things which are visible
p65
aVhappening on the web.
p66
aa(lp67
VAlso, lots of things which are less visible.
p68
aVThe healthcare, late at night when they're worried
p69
aVabout what sort of cancer
p70
aVsomebody they care about might have,
p71
aVwhen they just talk across the Internet to somebody
p72
aVwho they care about very much in another country.
p73
aVThose sorts of things are not, they're not out there,
p74
aVand in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy.
p75
aVSo we cannot assume that part of the web,
p76
aVpart of the deal with the web,
p77
aVis when I use the web,
p78
aVit's just a transparent, neutral medium.
p79
aVI can talk to you over it without worrying
p80
aVabout what we in fact now know is happening,
p81
aVwithout worrying about the fact
p82
aVthat not only will surveillance be happening
p83
aVbut it'll be done by people who may abuse the data.
p84
aVSo in fact, something we realized,
p85
aVwe can't just use the web,
p86
aVwe have to worry about
p87
aVwhat the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing,
p88
aVis it in fact of a quality that we need?
p89
aVWe revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech.
p90
aVWe can tweet, and oh, lots and lots of people
p91
aVcan see our tweets, except when they can't,
p92
aVexcept when actually Twitter is blocked from their country,
p93
aVor in some way the way we try to express ourselves
p94
aVhas put some information about the state of ourselves,
p95
aVthe state of the country we live in,
p96
aVwhich isn't available to anybody else.
p97
aVSo we must protest and make sure
p98
aVthat censorship is cut down,
p99
aVthat the web is opened up
p100
aVwhere there is censorship.
p101
aa(lp102
VWe love the fact that the web is open.
p103
aVIt allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody.
p104
aVIt doesn't matter who we are.
p105
aVAnd then we join these big
p106
aVsocial networking companies
p107
aVwhich are in fact effectively built as silos,
p108
aVso that it's much easier to talk to somebody
p109
aVin the same social network
p110
aVthan it is to talk to somebody in a different one,
p111
aVso in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves.
p112
aVAnd we also have, if you've read the book about the filter bubble,
p113
aVthe filter bubble phenomenon is that
p114
aVwe love to use machines
p115
aVwhich help us find stuff we like.
p116
aVSo we love it when we're bathed in
p117
aVwhat things we like to click on,
p118
aVand so the machine automatically feeds us
p119
aVthe stuff that we like and we end up
p120
aVwith this rose-colored spectacles view of the world
p121
aVcalled a filter bubble.
p122
aVSo here are some of the things which maybe
p123
aVthreaten the social web we have.
p124
aa(lp125
VWhat sort of web do you want?
p126
aVI want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces,
p127
aVas some countries have been suggesting
p128
aVthey should do in reaction to recent surveillance.
p129
aVI want a web which has got, for example,
p130
aVis a really good basis for democracy.
p131
aVI want a web where I can use healthcare
p132
aVwith privacy and where there's a lot
p133
aVof health data, clinical data is available
p134
aVto scientists to do research.
p135
aVI want a web where the other 60 percent
p136
aVget on board as fast as possible.
p137
aVI want a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation
p138
aVthat when something nasty happens,
p139
aVsome disaster strikes, that we can respond
p140
aVby building stuff to respond to it very quickly.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo this is just some of the things that I want,
p143
aVfrom a big list, obviously it's longer.
p144
aVYou have your list.
p145
aVI want us to use this 25th anniversary
p146
aVto think about what sort of a web we want.
p147
aVYou can go to webat25.org
p148
aVand find some links.
p149
aVThere are lots of sites where people
p150
aVhave started to put together a Magna Carta,
p151
aVa bill of rights for the web.
p152
aVHow about we do that?
p153
aVHow about we decide, these are, in a way,
p154
aVbecoming fundamental rights, the right to communicate with whom I want.
p155
aVWhat would be on your list for that Magna Carta?
p156
aVLet's crowdsource a Magna Carta
p157
aVfor the web.
p158
aVLet's do that this year.
p159
aVLet's use the energy from the 25th anniversary
p160
aVto crowdsource a Magna Carta
p161
aVto the web. (Applause)
p162
aa(lp163
VThank you. And do me a favor, will you?
p164
aVFight for it for me. Okay? Thanks.

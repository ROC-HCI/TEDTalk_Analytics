VIt would be nice to be objective in life,
p5
aVin many ways.
p6
aVThe problem is that we have these color-tinted glasses
p7
aVas we look at all kinds of situations.
p8
aVFor example, think about something as simple as beer.
p9
aVIf I gave you a few beers to taste
p10
aVand I asked you to rate them on intensity and bitterness,
p11
aVdifferent beers would occupy different space.
p12
aVBut what if we tried to be objective about it?
p13
aVIn the case of beer, it would be very simple.
p14
aVWhat if we did a blind taste?
p15
aVWell, if we did the same thing, you tasted the same beer,
p16
aVnow in the blind taste, things would look slightly different.
p17
aVMost of the beers will go into one place.
p18
aVYou will basically not be able to distinguish them,
p19
aVand the exception, of course, will be Guinness.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VSimilarly, we can think about physiology.
p23
aVWhat happens when people expect something from their physiology?
p24
aVFor example, we sold people pain medications.
p25
aVSome people, we told them the medications were expensive.
p26
aVSome people, we told them it was cheap.
p27
aVAnd the expensive pain medication worked better.
p28
aVIt relieved more pain from people,
p29
aVbecause expectations do change our physiology.
p30
aVAnd of course, we all know that in sports,
p31
aVif you are a fan of a particular team,
p32
aVyou can't help but see the game
p33
aVdevelop from the perspective of your team.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo all of those are cases in which our preconceived notions
p36
aVand our expectations color our world.
p37
aVBut what happened in more important questions?
p38
aVWhat happened with questions that had to do with social justice?
p39
aVSo we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version
p40
aVfor thinking about inequality?
p41
aVSo we started looking at inequality,
p42
aVand we did some large-scale surveys
p43
aVaround the U.S. and other countries.
p44
aVSo we asked two questions:
p45
aVDo people know what kind of level of inequality we have?
p46
aVAnd then, what level of inequality do we want to have?
p47
aVSo let's think about the first question.
p48
aVImagine I took all the people in the U.S.
p49
aVand I sorted them from the poorest on the right
p50
aVto the richest on the left,
p51
aVand then I divided them into five buckets:
p52
aVthe poorest 20 percent, the next 20 percent,
p53
aVthe next, the next, and the richest 20 percent.
p54
aVAnd then I asked you to tell me how much wealth do you think
p55
aVis concentrated in each of those buckets.
p56
aVSo to make it simpler, imagine I ask you to tell me,
p57
aVhow much wealth do you think is concentrated
p58
aVin the bottom two buckets,
p59
aVthe bottom 40 percent?
p60
aVTake a second. Think about it and have a number.
p61
aVUsually we don't think.
p62
aVThink for a second, have a real number in your mind.
p63
aVYou have it?
p64
aa(lp65
VOkay, here's what lots of Americans tell us.
p66
aVThey think that the bottom 20 percent
p67
aVhas about 2.9 percent of the wealth,
p68
aVthe next group has 6.4,
p69
aVso together it's slightly more than nine.
p70
aVThe next group, they say, has 12 percent,
p71
aV20 percent,
p72
aVand the richest 20 percent, people think has 58 percent of the wealth.
p73
aVYou can see how this relates to what you thought.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, what's reality?
p76
aVReality is slightly different.
p77
aVThe bottom 20 percent has 0.1 percent of the wealth.
p78
aVThe next 20 percent has 0.2 percent of the wealth.
p79
aVTogether, it's 0.3.
p80
aVThe next group has 3.9,
p81
aV11.3,
p82
aVand the richest group has 84-85 percent of the wealth.
p83
aVSo what we actually have and what we think we have
p84
aVare very different.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhat about what we want?
p87
aVHow do we even figure this out?
p88
aVSo to look at this,
p89
aVto look at what we really want,
p90
aVwe thought about the philosopher John Rawls.
p91
aVIf you remember John Rawls,
p92
aVhe had this notion of what's a just society.
p93
aVHe said a just society
p94
aVis a society that if you knew everything about it,
p95
aVyou would be willing to enter it in a random place.
p96
aVAnd it's a beautiful definition,
p97
aVbecause if you're wealthy, you might want the wealthy
p98
aVto have more money, the poor to have less.
p99
aVIf you're poor, you might want more equality.
p100
aVBut if you're going to go into that society
p101
aVin every possible situation, and you don't know,
p102
aVyou have to consider all the aspects.
p103
aVIt's a little bit like blind tasting in which you don't know
p104
aVwhat the outcome will be when you make a decision,
p105
aVand Rawls called this the "veil of ignorance."
p106
aa(lp107
VSo, we took another group, a large group of Americans,
p108
aVand we asked them the question in the veil of ignorance.
p109
aVWhat are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it,
p110
aVknowing that you could end randomly at any place?
p111
aVAnd here is what we got.
p112
aVWhat did people want to give to the first group,
p113
aVthe bottom 20 percent?
p114
aVThey wanted to give them about 10 percent of the wealth.
p115
aVThe next group, 14 percent of the wealth,
p116
aV21, 22 and 32.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, nobody in our sample wanted full equality.
p119
aVNobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample.
p120
aVBut what does it mean?
p121
aVIt means that we have this knowledge gap
p122
aVbetween what we have and what we think we have,
p123
aVbut we have at least as big a gap between what we think is right
p124
aVto what we think we have.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, we can ask these questions, by the way, not just about wealth.
p127
aVWe can ask it about other things as well.
p128
aVSo for example, we asked people from different parts of the world
p129
aVabout this question,
p130
aVpeople who are liberals and conservatives,
p131
aVand they gave us basically  the same answer.
p132
aVWe asked rich and poor, they gave us the same answer,
p133
aVmen and women,
p134
aVNPR listeners and Forbes readers.
p135
aVWe asked people in England, Australia, the U.S. \u2014
p136
aVvery similar answers.
p137
aVWe even asked different departments of a university.
p138
aVWe went to Harvard and we checked almost every department,
p139
aVand in fact, from Harvard Business School,
p140
aVwhere a few people wanted the wealthy to have more and the [poor] to have less,
p141
aVthe similarity was astonishing.
p142
aVI know some of you went to Harvard Business School.
p143
aa(lp144
VWe also asked this question about something else.
p145
aVWe asked, what about the ratio of CEO pay to unskilled workers?
p146
aVSo you can see what people think is the ratio,
p147
aVand then we can ask the question, what do they think should be the ratio?
p148
aVAnd then we can ask, what is reality?
p149
aVWhat is reality? And you could say, well, it's not that bad, right?
p150
aVThe red and the yellow are not that different.
p151
aVBut the fact is, it's because I didn't draw them on the same scale.
p152
aVIt's hard to see, there's yellow and blue in there.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo what about other outcomes of wealth?
p155
aVWealth is not just about wealth.
p156
aVWe asked, what about things like health?
p157
aVWhat about availability of prescription medication?
p158
aVWhat about life expectancy?
p159
aVWhat about life expectancy of infants?
p160
aVHow do we want this to be distributed?
p161
aVWhat about education for young people?
p162
aVAnd for older people?
p163
aVAnd across all of those things, what we learned was that people
p164
aVdon't like inequality of wealth,
p165
aVbut there's other things where inequality, which is an outcome of wealth,
p166
aVis even more aversive to them:
p167
aVfor example, inequality in health or education.
p168
aVWe also learned that people are particularly open
p169
aVto changes in equality when it comes to people
p170
aVwho have less agency \u2014
p171
aVbasically, young kids and babies,
p172
aVbecause we don't think of them as responsible for their situation.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo what are some lessons from this?
p175
aVWe have two gaps:
p176
aVWe have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap
p177
aVAnd the knowledge gap is something that we think about,
p178
aVhow do we educate people?
p179
aVHow do we get people to think differently about inequality
p180
aVand the consequences of inequality in terms of health, education,
p181
aVjealousy, crime rate, and so on?
p182
aa(lp183
VThen we have the desirability gap.
p184
aVHow do we get people to think differently about what we really want?
p185
aVYou see, the Rawls definition, the Rawls way of looking at the world,
p186
aVthe blind tasting approach,
p187
aVtakes our selfish motivation out of the picture.
p188
aVHow do we implement that to a higher degree
p189
aVon a more extensive scale?
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd finally, we also have an action gap.
p192
aVHow do we take these things and actually do something about it?
p193
aVI think part of the answer is to think about people
p194
aVlike young kids and babies that don't have much agency,
p195
aVbecause people seem to be more willing to do this.
p196
aa(lp197
VTo summarize, I would say, next time you go to drink beer or wine,
p198
aVfirst of all, think about, what is it in your experience that is real,
p199
aVand what is it in your experience that is a placebo effect
p200
aVcoming from expectations?
p201
aVAnd then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life,
p202
aVand hopefully also for policy questions
p203
aVthat affect all of us.
p204
aa(lp205
VThanks a lot.

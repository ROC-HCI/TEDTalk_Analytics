VI want you all to think
p5
aVabout the third word that was ever said about you \u2014
p6
aVor, if you were delivering,
p7
aVabout the person you were delivering.
p8
aVAnd you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud.
p9
aVIt was \u2014 the first two were, "It's a ..."
p10
aa(lp11
VAudience: (Mixed reply) Girl. Boy.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VWell, it shows you that \u2014
p16
aVI also deal with issues where there's not certainty
p17
aVof whether it's a girl or a boy,
p18
aVso the mixed answer was very appropriate.
p19
aa(lp20
VOf course, now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound,
p21
aVunless the prospective parents choose to be surprised,
p22
aVlike we all were.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut I want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement
p25
aVon the third word,
p26
aVbecause the third word
p27
aVis a description of your sex.
p28
aVAnd by that I mean,
p29
aVmade by a description of your genitals.
p30
aVNow, as a pediatric endocrinologist,
p31
aVI used to be very, very involved and still somewhat am, in cases
p32
aVin which there are mismatches in the externals
p33
aVor between the externals and the internals,
p34
aVand we literally have to figure out
p35
aVwhat is the description of your sex.
p36
aVBut there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth
p37
aVthat would define you.
p38
aVAnd when I talk about definition,
p39
aVI'm talking about your sexual orientation.
p40
aVWe don't say, "It's a ... gay boy!"
p41
aV"A lesbian girl!"
p42
aVThose situations don't really define themselves
p43
aVmore until the second decade of life.
p44
aVNor do they define your gender,
p45
aVwhich, as different from your anatomic sex,
p46
aVdescribes your self-concept:
p47
aa(lp48
VDo you see yourself as a male or female,
p49
aVor somewhere in the spectrum in between?
p50
aVThat sometimes shows up
p51
aVin the first decade of life,
p52
aVbut it can be very confusing for parents,
p53
aVbecause it is quite normative for children
p54
aVto act in a cross-gender play and way,
p55
aVand, in fact, there are studies that show
p56
aVthat even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion
p57
aVwill not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender
p58
aVat the time when puberty begins.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut, at the time that puberty begins \u2014
p61
aVthat means between about age 10 to 12 in girls, 12 to 14 in boys \u2014
p62
aVwith breast budding,
p63
aVor two to three times' increase in the gonads
p64
aVin the case of genetic males,
p65
aVby that particular point,
p66
aVthe child who says they are in the absolute wrong body
p67
aVis almost certain to be transgender
p68
aVand is extremely unlikely to change those feelings,
p69
aVno matter how anybody tries reparative therapy
p70
aVor any other noxious things.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, this is relatively rare,
p73
aVso I had relatively little personal experience with this.
p74
aVAnd my experience was more typical,
p75
aVonly because I had an adolescent practice.
p76
aVAnd I saw someone age 24,
p77
aVgenetically female, went through Harvard with three male roommates
p78
aVwho knew the whole story,
p79
aVa registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name,
p80
aVand came to me after graduating,
p81
aVsaying, "Help me. I know you know a lot of endocrinology."
p82
aVAnd indeed, I've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads.
p83
aVThis wasn't rocket science.
p84
aVBut I made a deal with him:
p85
aV"I'll treat you if you teach me."
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd so he did.
p88
aVAnd what an education I got
p89
aVfrom taking care of all the members of his support group.
p90
aVAnd then I got really confused,
p91
aVbecause I thought it was relatively easy at that age
p92
aVto just give people the hormones
p93
aVof the gender in which they were affirming.
p94
aVBut then my patient married,
p95
aVand he married a woman who had been born as a male,
p96
aVhad married as a male, had two children,
p97
aVthen went through a transition into female.
p98
aVAnd now this delightful female
p99
aVwas attached to my male patient \u2014 in fact, got legally married,
p100
aVbecause they showed up as a man and a woman, and who knew, right?
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd I was confused \u2014
p105
aV"Does this make so-and-so gay?
p106
aVDoes this make so-and-so straight?"
p107
aVI was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity.
p108
aVAnd my patient said to me,
p109
aV"Look, look, look.
p110
aVIf you just think of the following, you'll get it right:
p111
aVSexual orientation is who you go to bed with.
p112
aVGender identity is who you go to bed as."
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd I subsequently learned from the many adults \u2014
p117
aVI took care of about 200 adults \u2014
p118
aVI learned from them
p119
aVthat if I didn't peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room,
p120
aVI would never be able to guess better than chance,
p121
aVwhether they were gay, straight, bi or asexual
p122
aVin their affirmed gender.
p123
aVIn other words,
p124
aVone thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
p125
aVAnd the data show it.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, as I took care of the 200 adults,
p128
aVI found it extremely painful.
p129
aVThese people \u2014 many of them \u2014
p130
aVhad to give up so much of their lives.
p131
aVSometimes their parents would reject them,
p132
aVsiblings, their own children,
p133
aVand then their divorcing spouse
p134
aVwould forbid them from seeing their children.
p135
aVIt was so awful,
p136
aVbut why did they do it at 40 and 50?
p137
aVBecause they felt they had to affirm themselves
p138
aVbefore they would kill themselves.
p139
aVAnd indeed, the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people
p140
aVis among the highest in the world.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo, what to do?
p143
aVI was intrigued, in going to a conference in Holland,
p144
aVwhere they are experts in this,
p145
aVand saw the most remarkable thing.
p146
aVThey were treating young adolescents
p147
aVafter giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender,
p148
aVand they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn't want.
p149
aVBecause basically, kids look about the same,
p150
aVeach sex, until they go through puberty,
p151
aVat which point, if you feel you're in the wrong sex,
p152
aVyou feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey.
p153
aVThe fantasy that you had that your body will change
p154
aVto be who you want it to be, with puberty,
p155
aVactually is nullified by the puberty you get.
p156
aVAnd they fall apart.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo that's why putting the puberty on hold \u2014 why on hold?
p159
aVYou can't just give them the opposite hormones that young.
p160
aVThey'll end up stunted in growth,
p161
aVand you think you can have a meaningful conversation
p162
aVabout the fertility effects of such treatment
p163
aVwith a 10-year-old girl, a 12-year-old boy?
p164
aVSo this buys time in the diagnostic process
p165
aVfor four or five years,
p166
aVso that they can work it out.
p167
aVThey can have more and more testing,
p168
aVthey can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them.
p169
aVAnd then, in a program they call 12-16-18,
p170
aVaround age 12 is when they give the blocking hormones,
p171
aVand then at age 16, with retesting,
p172
aVthey re-qualify to receive \u2014
p173
aVnow remember, the blocking hormones are reversible,
p174
aVbut when you give the hormones of the opposite sex,
p175
aVyou now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice change,
p176
aVdepending on what you're using,
p177
aVand those effects are permanent,
p178
aVor require surgery to remove,
p179
aVor electrolysis,
p180
aVand you can never really affect the voice.
p181
aVSo this is serious, and this is 15-, 16-year-old stuff.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd then at 18, they're eligible for surgery.
p184
aVAnd while there's no good surgery for females to males genitally,
p185
aVthe male-to-female surgery has fooled gynecologists.
p186
aVThat's how good it can be.
p187
aVSo I looked at how the patients were doing,
p188
aVand I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else,
p189
aVexcept they were pubertally delayed.
p190
aVBut once they gave them the hormones
p191
aVconsistent with the gender they affirm,
p192
aVthey look beautiful.
p193
aVThey look normal.
p194
aVThey had normal heights.
p195
aVYou would never be able to pick them out in a crowd.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo at that point, I decided I'm going to do this.
p198
aVThis is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in,
p199
aVbecause, in fact, if you're going to deal with it in kids aged 10 to 14,
p200
aVthat's pediatric endocrinology.
p201
aVSo I brought some kids in,
p202
aVand this now became the standard of care,
p203
aVand the [Boston] Children's Hospital was behind it.
p204
aVBy my showing them the kids before and after,
p205
aVpeople who never got treated and people who wished to be treated,
p206
aVand pictures of the Dutch \u2014
p207
aVthey came to me and said,
p208
aV"You've got to do something for these kids."
p209
aVWell, where were these kids before?
p210
aVThey were out there suffering, is where they were.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo we started a program in 2007.
p213
aVIt became the first program of its kind \u2014
p214
aVbut it's really of the Dutch kind \u2014
p215
aVin North America.
p216
aVAnd since then, we have 160 patients.
p217
aVDid they come from Afghanistan? No.
p218
aV75 percent of them came from within 150 miles of Boston.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd some came from England.
p221
aVJackie had been abused in the Midlands, in England.
p222
aVShe's 12 years old there,
p223
aVshe was living as a girl,
p224
aVbut she was being beaten up.
p225
aVIt was a horror show, they had to homeschool her.
p226
aVAnd the reason the British were coming
p227
aVwas because they would not treat anybody with anything under age 16,
p228
aVwhich means they were consigning them to an adult body
p229
aVno matter what happened,
p230
aVeven if they tested them well.
p231
aVJackie, on top of it, was, by virtue of skeletal markings,
p232
aVdestined to be six feet five.
p233
aVAnd yet, she had just begun a male puberty.
p234
aa(lp235
VWell, I did something a little bit innovative,
p236
aVbecause I do know hormones,
p237
aVand that estrogen is much more potent
p238
aVin closing epiphyses, the growth plates,
p239
aVand stopping growth, than testosterone is.
p240
aVSo we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone,
p241
aVbut we added estrogen, not at 16, but at 13.
p242
aVAnd so here she is at 16, on the left.
p243
aVAnd on her 16th birthday, she went to Thailand,
p244
aVwhere they would do a genital plastic surgery.
p245
aVThey will do it at 18 now.
p246
aVAnd she ended up 5'11".
p247
aVBut more than that, she has normal breast size,
p248
aVbecause by blocking testosterone,
p249
aVevery one of our patients has normal breast size
p250
aVif they get to us at the appropriate age,
p251
aVnot too late.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd on the far right, there she is.
p254
aVShe went public \u2014 semifinalist in the Miss England competition.
p255
aVThe judges debated as to, can they do this?
p256
aVAnd one of them quipped, I'm told,
p257
aV"But she has more natural self than half the other contestants."
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd some of them have been rearranged a little bit,
p262
aVbut it's all her DNA.
p263
aVAnd she's become a remarkable spokeswoman.
p264
aVAnd she was offered contracts as a model,
p265
aVat which point she teased me, when she said,
p266
aV"You know, I might have had a better chance as a model
p267
aVif you'd made me six feet one."
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VGo figure.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo this picture, I think, says it all.
p274
aVIt really says it all.
p275
aVThese are Nicole and brother Jonas,
p276
aVidentical twin boys,
p277
aVand proven to be identical.
p278
aVNicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three.
p279
aVAt age seven, they changed her name,
p280
aVand came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty.
p281
aVNow you can imagine looking at Jonas at only 14,
p282
aVthat male puberty is early in this family,
p283
aVbecause he looks more like a 16-year-old.
p284
aVBut it makes the point all the more,
p285
aVof why you have to be conscious of where the patient is.
p286
aVNicole is on pubertal blockade in here,
p287
aVand Jonas is just going \u2014 biologic control.
p288
aVThis is what Nicole would look like
p289
aVif we weren't doing what we were doing.
p290
aVHe's got a prominent Adam's apple.
p291
aVHe's got angular bones to the face, a mustache,
p292
aVand you can see there's a height difference,
p293
aVbecause he's gone through a growth spurt that she won't get.
p294
aVNow Nicole is on estrogen.
p295
aVShe has a bit of a form to her.
p296
aa(lp297
VThis family went to the White House last spring,
p298
aVbecause of their work in overturning an anti-discrimination \u2014
p299
aVthere was a bill that would block
p300
aVthe right of transgender people in Maine to use public bathrooms,
p301
aVand it looked like the bill was going to pass,
p302
aVand that would have been a problem,
p303
aVbut Nicole went personally to every legislator in Maine
p304
aVand said, "I can do this.
p305
aVIf they see me, they'll understand
p306
aVwhy I'm no threat in the ladies' room,
p307
aVbut I can be threatened in the men's room."
p308
aVAnd then they finally got it.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo where do we go from here?
p311
aVWell, we still have a ways to go in terms of anti-discrimination.
p312
aVThere are only 17 states that have an anti-discrimination law
p313
aVagainst discrimination in housing,
p314
aVemployment, public accommodation \u2014
p315
aVonly 17 states, and five of them are in New England.
p316
aVWe need less expensive drugs.
p317
aVThey cost a fortune.
p318
aVAnd we need to get this condition out of the DSM.
p319
aVIt is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian,
p320
aVand that went out the window in 1973,
p321
aVand the whole world changed.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd this isn't going to break anybody's budget.
p324
aVThis is not that common.
p325
aVBut the risks of not doing anything for them
p326
aVnot only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide,
p327
aVbut it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society.
p328
aa(lp329
VThank you.

VI admit that I'm a little bit nervous here
p5
aVbecause I'm going to say some radical things,
p6
aVabout how we should think about cancer differently,
p7
aVto an audience that contains a lot of people
p8
aVwho know a lot more about cancer than I do.
p9
aVBut I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be
p10
aVbecause I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aVAnd that this, in fact, will be
p13
aVthe way that we treat cancer in the future.
p14
aVIn order to talk about cancer,
p15
aVI'm going to actually have to \u2014
p16
aVlet me get the big slide here.
p17
aVFirst, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics.
p18
aVI want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture
p19
aVof all the other things that are going on \u2014
p20
aVand then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics.
p21
aVHaving explained those,
p22
aVthat will set up for what I think will be a different idea
p23
aVabout how to go about treating cancer.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo let me start with genomics.
p26
aVIt is the hot topic.
p27
aVIt is the place where we're learning the most.
p28
aVThis is the great frontier.
p29
aVBut it has its limitations.
p30
aVAnd in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy
p31
aVthat the genome is like the blueprint of your body,
p32
aVand if that were only true, it would be great,
p33
aVbut it's not.
p34
aVIt's like the parts list of your body.
p35
aVIt doesn't say how things are connected,
p36
aVwhat causes what and so on.
p37
aVSo if I can make an analogy,
p38
aVlet's say that you were trying to tell the difference
p39
aVbetween a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant
p40
aVand a sick restaurant,
p41
aVand all you had was the list of ingredients
p42
aVthat they had in their larder.
p43
aVSo it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant
p44
aVand you looked through it and you found
p45
aVthey only had margarine and they didn't have butter,
p46
aVyou could say, "Ah, I see what's wrong with them.
p47
aVI can make them healthy."
p48
aVAnd there probably are special cases of that.
p49
aVYou could certainly tell the difference
p50
aVbetween a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant
p51
aVby what they had in a larder.
p52
aVSo the list of ingredients does tell you something,
p53
aVand sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.
p54
aVIf they have tons of salt,
p55
aVyou might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that.
p56
aVBut it's limited,
p57
aVbecause really to know if it's a healthy restaurant,
p58
aVyou need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen,
p59
aVyou need the product of all of those ingredients.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo if I look at a person
p62
aVand I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing.
p63
aVThe part of the genome that we can read
p64
aVis the list of ingredients.
p65
aVAnd so indeed,
p66
aVthere are times when we can find ingredients
p67
aVthat [are] bad.
p68
aVCystic fibrosis is an example of a disease
p69
aVwhere you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease,
p70
aVand we can actually make a direct correspondence
p71
aVbetween the ingredient and the disease.
p72
aVBut most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen,
p73
aVbecause, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people \u2014
p74
aVthey have the same genome.
p75
aVSo the genome really tells you much more
p76
aVabout predisposition.
p77
aVSo what you can tell
p78
aVis you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person
p79
aVby looking at their ingredients list.
p80
aVBut you really for the most part can't tell the difference
p81
aVbetween a healthy person and a sick person \u2014
p82
aVexcept in some of these special cases.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo why all the big deal
p85
aVabout genetics?
p86
aVWell first of all,
p87
aVit's because we can read it, which is fantastic.
p88
aVIt is very useful in certain circumstances.
p89
aVIt's also the great theoretical triumph
p90
aVof biology.
p91
aVIt's the one theory
p92
aVthat the biologists ever really got right.
p93
aVIt's fundamental to Darwin
p94
aVand Mendel and so on.
p95
aVAnd so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.
p96
aVSo Mendel had this idea of a gene
p97
aVas an abstract thing,
p98
aVand Darwin built a whole theory
p99
aVthat depended on them existing,
p100
aVand then Watson and Crick
p101
aVactually looked and found one.
p102
aVSo this happens in physics all the time.
p103
aVYou predict a black hole,
p104
aVand you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.
p105
aVBut it rarely happens in biology.
p106
aVSo this great triumph \u2014 it's so good,
p107
aVthere's almost a religious experience
p108
aVin biology.
p109
aVAnd Darwinian evolution
p110
aVis really the core theory.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo the other reason it's been very popular
p113
aVis because we can measure it, it's digital.
p114
aVAnd in fact,
p115
aVthanks to Kary Mullis,
p116
aVyou can basically measure your genome in your kitchen
p117
aVwith a few extra ingredients.
p118
aVSo for instance, by measuring the genome,
p119
aVwe've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals
p120
aVby the closeness of our genome,
p121
aVor how we're related to each other \u2014 the family tree,
p122
aVor the tree of life.
p123
aVThere's a huge amount of information about the genetics
p124
aVjust by comparing the genetic similarity.
p125
aVNow of course, in medical application,
p126
aVthat is very useful
p127
aVbecause it's the same kind of information
p128
aVthat the doctor gets from your family medical history \u2014
p129
aVexcept probably,
p130
aVyour genome knows much more about your medical history than you do.
p131
aVAnd so by reading the genome,
p132
aVwe can find out much more about your family than you probably know.
p133
aVAnd so we can discover things
p134
aVthat probably you could have found
p135
aVby looking at enough of your relatives,
p136
aVbut they may be surprising.
p137
aVI did the 23andMe thing
p138
aVand was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVBut sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut mostly
p143
aVwhat you need to know, to find out if you're sick,
p144
aVis not your predispositions,
p145
aVbut it's actually what's going on in your body right now.
p146
aVSo to do that, what you really need to do,
p147
aVyou need to look at the things
p148
aVthat the genes are producing
p149
aVand what's happening after the genetics,
p150
aVand that's what proteomics is about.
p151
aVJust like genome mixes the study of all the genes,
p152
aVproteomics is the study of all the proteins.
p153
aVAnd the proteins are all of the little things in your body
p154
aVthat are signaling between the cells \u2014
p155
aVactually, the machines that are operating \u2014
p156
aVthat's where the action is.
p157
aVBasically, a human body
p158
aVis a conversation going on,
p159
aVboth within the cells and between the cells,
p160
aVand they're telling each other to grow and to die,
p161
aVand when you're sick,
p162
aVsomething's gone wrong with that conversation.
p163
aVAnd so the trick is \u2014
p164
aVunfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these
p165
aVlike we can measure the genome.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo the problem is that measuring \u2014
p168
aVif you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process.
p169
aVIt requires hundreds of steps,
p170
aVand it takes a long, long time.
p171
aVAnd it matters how much of the protein it is.
p172
aVIt could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent,
p173
aVso it's not a nice digital thing like DNA.
p174
aVAnd basically our problem is somebody's in the middle
p175
aVof this very long stage,
p176
aVthey pause for just a moment,
p177
aVand they leave something in an enzyme for a second,
p178
aVand all of a sudden all the measurements from then on
p179
aVdon't work.
p180
aVAnd so then people get very inconsistent results
p181
aVwhen they do it this way.
p182
aVPeople have tried very hard to do this.
p183
aVI tried this a couple of times
p184
aVand looked at this problem and gave up on it.
p185
aa(lp186
VI kept getting this call from this oncologist
p187
aVnamed David Agus.
p188
aVAnd Applied Minds gets a lot of calls
p189
aVfrom people who want help with their problems,
p190
aVand I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back,
p191
aVso I kept on giving him to the delay list.
p192
aVAnd then one day,
p193
aVI get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman
p194
aVand Al Gore on the same day
p195
aVsaying return David Agus's phone call.
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aVSo I was like, "Okay. This guy's at least resourceful."
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVSo we started talking,
p200
aVand he said, "I really need a better way to measure proteins."
p201
aVI'm like, "Looked at that. Been there.
p202
aVNot going to be easy."
p203
aVHe's like, "No, no. I really need it.
p204
aVI mean, I see patients dying every day
p205
aVbecause we don't know what's going on inside of them.
p206
aVWe have to have a window into this."
p207
aVAnd he took me through
p208
aVspecific examples of when he really needed it.
p209
aVAnd I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference,
p210
aVif we could do it,
p211
aVand so I said, "Well, let's look at it."
p212
aa(lp213
VApplied Minds has enough play money
p214
aVthat we can go and just work on something
p215
aVwithout getting anybody's funding or permission or anything.
p216
aVSo we started playing around with this.
p217
aVAnd as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem \u2014
p218
aVthat taking the sip of coffee \u2014
p219
aVthat there were humans doing this complicated process
p220
aVand that what really needed to be done
p221
aVwas to automate this process like an assembly line
p222
aVand build robots
p223
aVthat would measure proteomics.
p224
aVAnd so we did that,
p225
aVand working with David,
p226
aVwe made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually,
p227
aVwhich makes this robotic assembly line,
p228
aVwhich, in a very consistent way, measures the protein.
p229
aVAnd I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.
p230
aa(lp231
VBasically, what we do
p232
aVis we take a drop of blood
p233
aVout of a patient,
p234
aVand we sort out the proteins
p235
aVin the drop of blood
p236
aVaccording to how much they weigh,
p237
aVhow slippery they are,
p238
aVand we arrange them in an image.
p239
aVAnd so we can look at literally
p240
aVhundreds of thousands of features at once
p241
aVout of that drop of blood.
p242
aVAnd we can take a different one tomorrow,
p243
aVand you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different \u2014
p244
aVthey'll be different after you eat or after you sleep.
p245
aVThey really tell us what's going on there.
p246
aVAnd so this picture,
p247
aVwhich looks like a big smudge to you,
p248
aVis actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this
p249
aVand made me feel like we were on the right track.
p250
aVSo if I zoom into that picture,
p251
aVI can just show you what it means.
p252
aVWe sort out the proteins \u2014 from left to right
p253
aVis the weight of the fragments that we're getting,
p254
aVand from top to bottom is how slippery they are.
p255
aVSo we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.
p256
aVAnd so each of these lines
p257
aVrepresents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.
p258
aVAnd you can see how the lines occur
p259
aVin these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.
p260
aVAnd that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that \u2014
p261
aVcarbon comes in different isotopes,
p262
aVso if it has an extra neutron on it,
p263
aVwe actually measure it as a different chemical.
p264
aVSo we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd so that gives you an idea
p267
aVof how exquisitely sensitive this is.
p268
aVSo seeing this picture
p269
aVis sort of like getting to be Galileo
p270
aVand looking at the stars
p271
aVand looking through the telescope for the first time,
p272
aVand suddenly you say, "Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was."
p273
aVBut we can see that stuff out there
p274
aVand actually see features of it.
p275
aVSo this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns.
p276
aVSo what we do with this
p277
aVis, for example, we can look at two patients,
p278
aVone that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug,
p279
aVand ask, "What's going on differently
p280
aVinside of them?"
p281
aVAnd so we can make these measurements precisely enough
p282
aVthat we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo here we have Alice in green
p285
aVand Bob in red.
p286
aVWe overlay them. This is actual data.
p287
aVAnd you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow,
p288
aVbut there's some things that just Alice has
p289
aVand some things that just Bob has.
p290
aVAnd if we find a pattern of things
p291
aVof the responders to the drug,
p292
aVwe see that in the blood,
p293
aVthey have the condition
p294
aVthat allows them to respond to this drug.
p295
aVWe might not even know what this protein is,
p296
aVbut we can see it's a marker
p297
aVfor the response to the disease.
p298
aVSo this already, I think,
p299
aVis tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.
p300
aVBut I think this is actually
p301
aVjust the beginning
p302
aVof how we're going to treat cancer.
p303
aVSo let me move to cancer.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe thing about cancer \u2014
p306
aVwhen I got into this,
p307
aVI really knew nothing about it,
p308
aVbut working with David Agus,
p309
aVI started watching how cancer was actually being treated
p310
aVand went to operations where it was being cut out.
p311
aVAnd as I looked at it,
p312
aVto me it didn't make sense
p313
aVhow we were approaching cancer,
p314
aVand in order to make sense of it,
p315
aVI had to learn where did this come from.
p316
aVWe're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease.
p317
aVWe're treating it as something that got inside of you
p318
aVthat we have to kill.
p319
aVSo this is the great paradigm.
p320
aVThis is another case
p321
aVwhere a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked \u2014
p322
aVwas the germ theory of disease.
p323
aVSo what doctors are mostly trained to do
p324
aVis diagnose \u2014
p325
aVthat is, put you into a category
p326
aVand apply a scientifically proven treatment
p327
aVfor that diagnosis \u2014
p328
aVand that works great for infectious diseases.
p329
aVSo if we put you in the category
p330
aVof you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.
p331
aVWe know that that works.
p332
aVIf you've got malaria, we give you quinine
p333
aVor some derivative of it.
p334
aVAnd so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do,
p335
aVand it's miraculous
p336
aVin the case of infectious disease \u2014
p337
aVhow well it works.
p338
aVAnd many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive
p339
aVif doctors didn't do this.
p340
aa(lp341
VBut now let's apply that
p342
aVto systems diseases like cancer.
p343
aVThe problem is that, in cancer,
p344
aVthere isn't something else
p345
aVthat's inside of you.
p346
aVIt's you; you're broken.
p347
aVThat conversation inside of you
p348
aVgot mixed up in some way.
p349
aVSo how do we diagnose that conversation?
p350
aVWell, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body \u2014
p351
aVyou know, where did it appear? \u2014
p352
aVand we put you in different categories
p353
aVaccording to the part of the body.
p354
aVAnd then we do a clinical trial
p355
aVfor a drug for lung cancer
p356
aVand one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer,
p357
aVand we treat these as if they're separate diseases
p358
aVand that this way of dividing them
p359
aVhad something to do with what actually went wrong.
p360
aVAnd of course, it really doesn't have that much to do
p361
aVwith what went wrong
p362
aVbecause cancer is a failure of the system.
p363
aVAnd in fact, I think we're even wrong
p364
aVwhen we talk about cancer as a thing.
p365
aVI think this is the big mistake.
p366
aVI think cancer should not be a noun.
p367
aVWe should talk about cancering
p368
aVas something we do, not something we have.
p369
aVAnd so those tumors,
p370
aVthose are symptoms of cancer.
p371
aVAnd so your body is probably cancering all the time,
p372
aVbut there are lots of systems in your body
p373
aVthat keep it under control.
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd so to give you an idea
p376
aVof an analogy of what I mean
p377
aVby thinking of cancering as a verb,
p378
aVimagine we didn't know anything about plumbing,
p379
aVand the way that we talked about it,
p380
aVwe'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen
p381
aVand we'd say, "Oh, my house has water."
p382
aVWe might divide it \u2014 the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?"
p383
aV"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water."
p384
aVThat's kind of the level at which it is.
p385
aV"Kitchen water,
p386
aVwell, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it.
p387
aVAnd then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen,
p388
aVthat helps.
p389
aVWhereas living room water,
p390
aVit's better to do tar on the roof."
p391
aVAnd it sounds silly,
p392
aVbut that's basically what we do.
p393
aVAnd I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer,
p394
aVbut I'm saying that's not really the problem;
p395
aVthat's the symptom of the problem.
p396
aa(lp397
VWhat we really need to get at
p398
aVis the process that's going on,
p399
aVand that's happening at the level
p400
aVof the proteonomic actions,
p401
aVhappening at the level of why is your body not healing itself
p402
aVin the way that it normally does?
p403
aVBecause normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.
p404
aVSo your house is dealing with leaks all the time,
p405
aVbut it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.
p406
aVSo what we need
p407
aVis to have a causative model
p408
aVof what's actually going on,
p409
aVand proteomics actually gives us
p410
aVthe ability to build a model like that.
p411
aa(lp412
VDavid got me invited
p413
aVto give a talk at National Cancer Institute
p414
aVand Anna Barker was there.
p415
aVAnd so I gave this talk
p416
aVand said, "Why don't you guys do this?"
p417
aVAnd Anna said,
p418
aV"Because nobody within cancer
p419
aVwould look at it this way.
p420
aVBut what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program
p421
aVfor people outside the field of cancer
p422
aVto get together with doctors
p423
aVwho really know about cancer
p424
aVand work out different programs of research."
p425
aVSo David and I applied to this program
p426
aVand created a consortium
p427
aVat USC
p428
aVwhere we've got some of the best oncologists in the world
p429
aVand some of the best biologists in the world,
p430
aVfrom Cold Spring Harbor,
p431
aVStanford, Austin \u2014
p432
aVI won't even go through and name all the places \u2014
p433
aVto have a research project
p434
aVthat will last for five years
p435
aVwhere we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this.
p436
aVWe're doing it in mice first,
p437
aVand we will kill a lot of mice
p438
aVin the process of doing this,
p439
aVbut they will die for a good cause.
p440
aVAnd we will actually try to get to the point
p441
aVwhere we have a predictive model
p442
aVwhere we can understand,
p443
aVwhen cancer happens,
p444
aVwhat's actually happening in there
p445
aVand which treatment will treat that cancer.
p446
aa(lp447
VSo let me just end with giving you a little picture
p448
aVof what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future.
p449
aVSo I think eventually,
p450
aVonce we have one of these models for people,
p451
aVwhich we'll get eventually \u2014
p452
aVI mean, our group won't get all the way there \u2014
p453
aVbut eventually we'll have a very good computer model \u2014
p454
aVsort of like a global climate model for weather.
p455
aVIt has lots of different information
p456
aVabout what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation
p457
aVon many different scales.
p458
aVAnd so we will simulate
p459
aVin that model
p460
aVfor your particular cancer \u2014
p461
aVand this also will be for ALS,
p462
aVor any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases,
p463
aVthings like that \u2014
p464
aVwe will simulate
p465
aVspecifically you,
p466
aVnot just a generic person,
p467
aVbut what's actually going on inside you.
p468
aa(lp469
VAnd in that simulation, what we could do
p470
aVis design for you specifically
p471
aVa sequence of treatments,
p472
aVand it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs.
p473
aVIt might be things like, don't eat that day,
p474
aVor give them a little chemotherapy,
p475
aVmaybe a little radiation.
p476
aVOf course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.
p477
aVBut design a program of treatments specifically for you
p478
aVand help your body
p479
aVguide back to health \u2014
p480
aVguide your body back to health.
p481
aVBecause your body will do most of the work of fixing it
p482
aVif we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.
p483
aVWe put it in the equivalent of splints.
p484
aVAnd so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms
p485
aVfor fixing cancer,
p486
aVand we just have to prop those up in the right way
p487
aVand get them to do the job.
p488
aa(lp489
VAnd so I believe that this will be the way
p490
aVthat cancer will be treated in the future.
p491
aVIt's going to require a lot of work,
p492
aVa lot of research.
p493
aVThere will be many teams like our team
p494
aVthat work on this.
p495
aVBut I think eventually,
p496
aVwe will design for everybody
p497
aVa custom treatment for cancer.
p498
aa(lp499

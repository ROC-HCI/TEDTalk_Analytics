VWhen we think about prejudice and bias,
p5
aVwe tend to think about stupid and evil people
p6
aVdoing stupid and evil things.
p7
aVAnd this idea is nicely summarized
p8
aVby the British critic William Hazlitt,
p9
aVwho wrote, "Prejudice is the child of ignorance."
p10
aVI want to try to convince you here
p11
aVthat this is mistaken.
p12
aVI want to try to convince you
p13
aVthat prejudice and bias
p14
aVare natural, they're often rational,
p15
aVand they're often even moral,
p16
aVand I think that once we understand this,
p17
aVwe're in a better position to make sense of them
p18
aVwhen they go wrong,
p19
aVwhen they have horrible consequences,
p20
aVand we're in a better position to know what to do
p21
aVwhen this happens.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, start with stereotypes. You look at me,
p24
aVyou know my name, you know certain facts about me,
p25
aVand you could make certain judgments.
p26
aVYou could make guesses about my ethnicity,
p27
aVmy political affiliation, my religious beliefs.
p28
aVAnd the thing is, these judgments tend to be accurate.
p29
aVWe're very good at this sort of thing.
p30
aVAnd we're very good at this sort of thing
p31
aVbecause our ability to stereotype people
p32
aVis not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind,
p33
aVbut rather it's a specific instance
p34
aVof a more general process,
p35
aVwhich is that we have experience
p36
aVwith things and people in the world
p37
aVthat fall into categories,
p38
aVand we can use our experience to make generalizations
p39
aVabout novel instances of these categories.
p40
aVSo everybody here has a lot of experience
p41
aVwith chairs and apples and dogs,
p42
aVand based on this, you could see
p43
aVunfamiliar examples and you could guess,
p44
aVyou could sit on the chair,
p45
aVyou could eat the apple, the dog will bark.
p46
aVNow we might be wrong.
p47
aVThe chair could collapse if you sit on it,
p48
aVthe apple might be poison, the dog might not bark,
p49
aVand in fact, this is my dog Tessie, who doesn't bark.
p50
aVBut for the most part, we're good at this.
p51
aVFor the most part, we make good guesses
p52
aVboth in the social domain and the non-social domain,
p53
aVand if we weren't able to do so,
p54
aVif we weren't able to make guesses about new instances that we encounter,
p55
aVwe wouldn't survive.
p56
aVAnd in fact, Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay
p57
aVconcedes this.
p58
aVHe writes, "Without the aid of prejudice and custom,
p59
aVI should not be able to find my way my across the room;
p60
aVnor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances,
p61
aVnor what to feel in any relation of life."
p62
aVOr take bias.
p63
aVNow sometimes, we break the world up into
p64
aVus versus them, into in-group versus out-group,
p65
aVand sometimes when we do this,
p66
aVwe know we're doing something wrong,
p67
aVand we're kind of ashamed of it.
p68
aVBut other times we're proud of it.
p69
aVWe openly acknowledge it.
p70
aVAnd my favorite example of this
p71
aVis a question that came from the audience
p72
aVin a Republican debate prior to the last election.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Video) Anderson Cooper: Gets to your question,
p75
aVthe question in the hall, on foreign aid? Yes, ma'am.
p76
aa(lp77
VWoman: The American people are suffering
p78
aVin our country right now.
p79
aVWhy do we continue to send foreign aid
p80
aVto other countries
p81
aVwhen we need all the help we can get for ourselves?
p82
aa(lp83
VAC: Governor Perry, what about that?
p84
aa(lp85
V(Applause)
p86
aVRick Perry: Absolutely, I think it's\u2014
p87
aa(lp88
VPaul Bloom: Each of the people onstage
p89
aVagreed with the premise of her question,
p90
aVwhich is as Americans, we should care more
p91
aVabout Americans than about other people.
p92
aVAnd in fact, in general, people are often swayed
p93
aVby feelings of solidarity, loyalty, pride, patriotism,
p94
aVtowards their country or towards their ethnic group.
p95
aVRegardless of your politics, many people feel proud to be American,
p96
aVand they favor Americans over other countries.
p97
aVResidents of other countries feel the same about their nation,
p98
aVand we feel the same about our ethnicities.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow some of you may reject this.
p101
aVSome of you may be so cosmopolitan
p102
aVthat you think that ethnicity and nationality
p103
aVshould hold no moral sway.
p104
aVBut even you sophisticates accept
p105
aVthat there should be some pull
p106
aVtowards the in-group in the domain of friends and family,
p107
aVof people you're close to,
p108
aVand so even you make a distinction
p109
aVbetween us versus them.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, this distinction is natural enough
p112
aVand often moral enough, but it can go awry,
p113
aVand this was part of the research
p114
aVof the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel.
p115
aVTajfel was born in Poland in 1919.
p116
aVHe left to go to university in France,
p117
aVbecause as a Jew, he couldn't go to university in Poland,
p118
aVand then he enlisted in the French military
p119
aVin World War II.
p120
aVHe was captured and ended up
p121
aVin a prisoner of war camp,
p122
aVand it was a terrifying time for him,
p123
aVbecause if it was discovered that he was a Jew,
p124
aVhe could have been moved to a concentration camp,
p125
aVwhere he most likely would not have survived.
p126
aVAnd in fact, when the war ended and he was released,
p127
aVmost of his friends and family were dead.
p128
aVHe got involved in different pursuits.
p129
aVHe helped out the war orphans.
p130
aVBut he had a long-lasting interest
p131
aVin the science of prejudice,
p132
aVand so when a prestigious British scholarship
p133
aVon stereotypes opened up, he applied for it,
p134
aVand he won it,
p135
aVand then he began this amazing career.
p136
aVAnd what started his career is an insight
p137
aVthat the way most people were thinking
p138
aVabout the Holocaust was wrong.
p139
aVMany people, most people at the time,
p140
aVviewed the Holocaust as sort of representing
p141
aVsome tragic flaw on the part of the Germans,
p142
aVsome genetic taint, some authoritarian personality.
p143
aVAnd Tajfel rejected this.
p144
aVTajfel said what we see in the Holocaust
p145
aVis just an exaggeration
p146
aVof normal psychological processes
p147
aVthat exist in every one of us.
p148
aVAnd to explore this, he did a series of classic studies
p149
aVwith British adolescents.
p150
aVAnd in one of his studies, what he did was he asked
p151
aVthe British adolescents all sorts of questions,
p152
aVand then based on their answers, he said,
p153
aV"I've looked at your answers, and based on the answers,
p154
aVI have determined that you are either" \u2014
p155
aVhe told half of them \u2014
p156
aV"a Kandinsky lover, you love the work of Kandinsky,
p157
aVor a Klee lover, you love the work of Klee."
p158
aVIt was entirely bogus.
p159
aVTheir answers had nothing to do with Kandinsky or Klee.
p160
aVThey probably hadn't heard of the artists.
p161
aVHe just arbitrarily divided them up.
p162
aVBut what he found was, these categories mattered,
p163
aVso when he later gave the subjects money,
p164
aVthey would prefer to give the money
p165
aVto members of their own group
p166
aVthan members of the other group.
p167
aVWorse, they were actually most interested
p168
aVin establishing a difference
p169
aVbetween their group and other groups,
p170
aVso they would give up money for their own group
p171
aVif by doing so they could give the other group even less.
p172
aa(lp173
VThis bias seems to show up very early.
p174
aVSo my colleague and wife, Karen Wynn, at Yale
p175
aVhas done a series of studies with babies
p176
aVwhere she exposes babies to puppets,
p177
aVand the puppets have certain food preferences.
p178
aVSo one of the puppets might like green beans.
p179
aVThe other puppet might like graham crackers.
p180
aVThey test the babies own food preferences,
p181
aVand babies typically prefer the graham crackers.
p182
aVBut the question is, does this matter to babies
p183
aVin how they treat the puppets? And it matters a lot.
p184
aVThey tend to prefer the puppet
p185
aVwho has the same food tastes that they have,
p186
aVand worse, they actually prefer puppets
p187
aVwho punish the puppet with the different food taste.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VWe see this sort of in-group, out-group psychology all the time.
p191
aVWe see it in political clashes
p192
aVwithin groups with different ideologies.
p193
aVWe see it in its extreme in cases of war,
p194
aVwhere the out-group isn't merely given less,
p195
aVbut dehumanized,
p196
aVas in the Nazi perspective of Jews
p197
aVas vermin or lice,
p198
aVor the American perspective of Japanese as rats.
p199
aa(lp200
VStereotypes can also go awry.
p201
aVSo often they're rational and useful,
p202
aVbut sometimes they're irrational,
p203
aVthey give the wrong answers,
p204
aVand other times
p205
aVthey lead to plainly immoral consequences.
p206
aVAnd the case that's been most studied
p207
aVis the case of race.
p208
aVThere was a fascinating study
p209
aVprior to the 2008 election
p210
aVwhere social psychologists looked at the extent
p211
aVto which the candidates were associated with America,
p212
aVas in an unconscious association with the American flag.
p213
aVAnd in one of their studies they compared
p214
aVObama and McCain, and they found McCain
p215
aVis thought of as more American than Obama,
p216
aVand to some extent, people aren't  that surprised by hearing that.
p217
aVMcCain is a celebrated war hero,
p218
aVand many people would explicitly say
p219
aVhe has more of an American story than Obama.
p220
aVBut they also compared Obama
p221
aVto British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
p222
aVand they found that Blair was also thought of
p223
aVas more American than Obama,
p224
aVeven though subjects explicitly understood
p225
aVthat he's not American at all.
p226
aVBut they were responding, of course,
p227
aVto the color of his skin.
p228
aa(lp229
VThese stereotypes and biases
p230
aVhave real-world consequences,
p231
aVboth subtle and very important.
p232
aVIn one recent study, researchers
p233
aVput ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards.
p234
aVSome of them were held by white hands,
p235
aVothers by black hands.
p236
aVThey were the same baseball cards.
p237
aVThe ones held by black hands
p238
aVgot substantially smaller bids
p239
aVthan the ones held by white hands.
p240
aVIn research done at Stanford,
p241
aVpsychologists explored the case of people
p242
aVsentenced for the murder of a white person.
p243
aVIt turns out, holding everything else constant,
p244
aVyou are considerably more likely to be executed
p245
aVif you look like the man on the right
p246
aVthan the man on the left,
p247
aVand this is in large part because
p248
aVthe man on the right looks more prototypically black,
p249
aVmore prototypically African-American,
p250
aVand this apparently influences people's decisions
p251
aVover what to do about him.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo now that we know about this,
p254
aVhow do we combat it?
p255
aVAnd there are different avenues.
p256
aVOne avenue is to appeal
p257
aVto people's emotional responses,
p258
aVto appeal to people's empathy,
p259
aVand we often do that through stories.
p260
aVSo if you are a liberal parent
p261
aVand you want to encourage your children
p262
aVto believe in the merits of nontraditional families,
p263
aVyou might give them a book like this. ["Heather Has Two Mommies"]
p264
aVIf you are conservative and have a different attitude,
p265
aVyou might give them a book like this.
p266
aV(Laughter) ["Help! Mom! There Are Liberals under My Bed!"]
p267
aVBut in general, stories can turn
p268
aVanonymous strangers into people who matter,
p269
aVand the idea that we care about people
p270
aVwhen we focus on them as individuals
p271
aVis an idea which has shown up across history.
p272
aVSo Stalin apocryphally said,
p273
aV"A single death is a tragedy,
p274
aVa million deaths is a statistic,"
p275
aVand Mother Teresa said,
p276
aV"If I look at the mass, I will never act.
p277
aVIf I look at the one, I will."
p278
aVPsychologists have explored this.
p279
aVFor instance, in one study,
p280
aVpeople were given a list of facts about a crisis,
p281
aVand it was seen how much they would donate
p282
aVto solve this crisis,
p283
aVand another group was given no facts at all
p284
aVbut they were told of an individual
p285
aVand given a name and given a face,
p286
aVand it turns out that they gave far more.
p287
aVNone of this I think is a secret
p288
aVto the people who are engaged in charity work.
p289
aVPeople don't tend to deluge people
p290
aVwith facts and statistics.
p291
aVRather, you show them faces,
p292
aVyou show them people.
p293
aVIt's possible that by extending our sympathies
p294
aVto an individual, they can spread
p295
aVto the group that the individual belongs to.
p296
aa(lp297
VThis is Harriet Beecher Stowe.
p298
aVThe story, perhaps apocryphal,
p299
aVis that President Lincoln invited her
p300
aVto the White House in the middle of the Civil War
p301
aVand said to her,
p302
aV"So you're the little lady who started this great war."
p303
aVAnd he was talking about "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
p304
aV"Uncle Tom's Cabin" is not a great book of philosophy
p305
aVor of theology or perhaps not even literature,
p306
aVbut it does a great job
p307
aVof getting people to put themselves in the shoes
p308
aVof people they wouldn't otherwise be in the shoes of,
p309
aVput themselves in the shoes of slaves.
p310
aVAnd that could well have been a catalyst
p311
aVfor great social change.
p312
aa(lp313
VMore recently, looking at America
p314
aVin the last several decades,
p315
aVthere's some reason to believe that shows like "The Cosby Show"
p316
aVradically changed American attitudes towards African-Americans,
p317
aVwhile shows like "Will and Grace" and "Modern Family"
p318
aVchanged American attitudes
p319
aVtowards gay men and women.
p320
aVI don't think it's an exaggeration to say
p321
aVthat the major catalyst in America for moral change
p322
aVhas been a situation comedy.
p323
aa(lp324
VBut it's not all emotions,
p325
aVand I want to end by appealing
p326
aVto the power of reason.
p327
aVAt some point in his wonderful book
p328
aV"The Better Angels of Our Nature,"
p329
aVSteven Pinker says,
p330
aVthe Old Testament says love thy neighbor,
p331
aVand the New Testament says love thy enemy,
p332
aVbut I don't love either one of them, not really,
p333
aVbut I don't want to kill them.
p334
aVI know I have obligations to them,
p335
aVbut my moral feelings to them, my moral beliefs
p336
aVabout how I should behave towards them,
p337
aVaren't grounded in love.
p338
aVWhat they're grounded in is the understanding of human rights,
p339
aVa belief that their life is as valuable to them
p340
aVas my life is to me,
p341
aVand to support this, he tells a story
p342
aVby the great philosopher Adam Smith,
p343
aVand I want to tell this story too,
p344
aVthough I'm going to modify it a little bit
p345
aVfor modern times.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine
p348
aVthe death of thousands of people,
p349
aVand imagine that the thousands of people
p350
aVare in a country you are not familiar with.
p351
aVIt could be China or India or a country in Africa.
p352
aVAnd Smith says, how would you respond?
p353
aVAnd you would say, well that's too bad,
p354
aVand you'd go on to the rest of your life.
p355
aVIf you were to open up The New York Times online or something,
p356
aVand discover this, and in fact this happens to us all the time,
p357
aVwe go about our lives.
p358
aVBut imagine instead, Smith says,
p359
aVyou were to learn that tomorrow
p360
aVyou were to have your little finger chopped off.
p361
aVSmith says, that would matter a lot.
p362
aVYou would not sleep that night
p363
aVwondering about that.
p364
aVSo this raises the question:
p365
aVWould you sacrifice thousands of lives
p366
aVto save your little finger?
p367
aVNow answer this in the privacy of your own head,
p368
aVbut Smith says, absolutely not,
p369
aVwhat a horrid thought.
p370
aVAnd so this raises the question,
p371
aVand so, as Smith puts it,
p372
aV"When our passive feelings are almost always
p373
aVso sordid and so selfish,
p374
aVhow comes it that our active principles
p375
aVshould often be so generous and so noble?"
p376
aVAnd Smith's answer is, "It is reason,
p377
aVprinciple, conscience.
p378
aV[This] calls to us,
p379
aVwith a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions,
p380
aVthat we are but one of the multitude,
p381
aVin no respect better than any other in it."
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd this last part is what is often described
p384
aVas the principle of impartiality.
p385
aVAnd this principle of impartiality manifests itself
p386
aVin all of the world's religions,
p387
aVin all of the different versions of the golden rule,
p388
aVand in all of the world's moral philosophies,
p389
aVwhich differ in many ways
p390
aVbut share the presupposition that we should judge morality
p391
aVfrom sort of an impartial point of view.
p392
aa(lp393
VThe best articulation of this view
p394
aVis actually, for me, it's not from a theologian or from a philosopher,
p395
aVbut from Humphrey Bogart
p396
aVat the end of "Casablanca."
p397
aVSo, spoiler alert, he's telling his lover
p398
aVthat they have to separate
p399
aVfor the more general good,
p400
aVand he says to her, and I won't do the accent,
p401
aVbut he says to her, "It doesn't take much to see
p402
aVthat the problems of three little people
p403
aVdon't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."
p404
aa(lp405
VOur reason could cause us to override our passions.
p406
aVOur reason could motivate us
p407
aVto extend our empathy,
p408
aVcould motivate us to write a book like "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
p409
aVor read a book like "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
p410
aVand our reason can motivate us to create
p411
aVcustoms and taboos and laws
p412
aVthat will constrain us
p413
aVfrom acting upon our impulses
p414
aVwhen, as rational beings, we feel
p415
aVwe should be constrained.
p416
aVThis is what a constitution is.
p417
aVA constitution is something which was set up in the past
p418
aVthat applies now in the present,
p419
aVand what it says is,
p420
aVno matter how much we might to reelect
p421
aVa popular president for a third term,
p422
aVno matter how much white Americans might choose
p423
aVto feel that they want to reinstate the institution of slavery, we can't.
p424
aVWe have bound ourselves.
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd we bind ourselves in other ways as well.
p427
aVWe know that when it comes to choosing somebody
p428
aVfor a job, for an award,
p429
aVwe are strongly biased by their race,
p430
aVwe are biased by their gender,
p431
aVwe are biased by how attractive they are,
p432
aVand sometimes we might say, "Well fine, that's the way it should be."
p433
aVBut other times we say, "This is wrong."
p434
aVAnd so to combat this,
p435
aVwe don't just try harder,
p436
aVbut rather what we do is we set up situations
p437
aVwhere these other sources of information can't bias us,
p438
aVwhich is why many orchestras
p439
aVaudition musicians behind screens,
p440
aVso the only information they have
p441
aVis the information they believe should matter.
p442
aVI think prejudice and bias
p443
aVillustrate a fundamental duality of human nature.
p444
aVWe have gut feelings, instincts, emotions,
p445
aVand they affect our judgments and our actions
p446
aVfor good and for evil,
p447
aVbut we are also capable of rational deliberation
p448
aVand intelligent planning,
p449
aVand we can use these to, in some cases,
p450
aVaccelerate and nourish our emotions,
p451
aVand in other cases staunch them.
p452
aVAnd it's in this way
p453
aVthat reason helps us create a better world.
p454
aa(lp455
VThank you.

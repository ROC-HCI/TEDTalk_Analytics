VIn the space that used to house one transistor,
p5
aVwe can now fit one billion.
p6
aVThat made it so that a computer the size of an entire room
p7
aVnow fits in your pocket.
p8
aVYou might say the future is small.
p9
aa(lp10
VAs an engineer,
p11
aVI'm inspired by this miniaturization revolution in computers.
p12
aVAs a physician,
p13
aVI wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost
p14
aVdue to one of the fastest-growing diseases on Earth:
p15
aVcancer.
p16
aVNow when I say that,
p17
aVwhat most people hear me say is that we're working on curing cancer.
p18
aVAnd we are.
p19
aVBut it turns out
p20
aVthat there's an incredible opportunity to save lives
p21
aVthrough the early detection and prevention of cancer.
p22
aa(lp23
VWorldwide, over two-thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable
p24
aVusing methods that we already have in hand today.
p25
aVThings like vaccination, timely screening
p26
aVand of course, stopping smoking.
p27
aVBut even with the best tools and technologies that we have today,
p28
aVsome tumors can't be detected
p29
aVuntil 10 years after they've started growing,
p30
aVwhen they are 50 million cancer cells strong.
p31
aVWhat if we had better technologies
p32
aVto detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner,
p33
aVwhen they could be removed,
p34
aVwhen they were just getting started?
p35
aa(lp36
VLet me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there.
p37
aVThis is a microscope in a typical lab
p38
aVthat a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen,
p39
aVlike a biopsy or a pap smear.
p40
aVThis $7,000 microscope
p41
aVwould be used by somebody with years of specialized training
p42
aVto spot cancer cells.
p43
aVThis is an image from a colleague of mine at Rice University,
p44
aVRebecca Richards-Kortum.
p45
aVWhat she and her team have done is miniaturize that whole microscope
p46
aVinto this $10 part,
p47
aVand it fits on the end of an optical fiber.
p48
aVNow what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient
p49
aVand sending it to the microscope,
p50
aVyou can bring the microscope to the patient.
p51
aVAnd then, instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images,
p52
aVyou can train the computer to score normal versus cancerous cells.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow this is important,
p55
aVbecause what they found working in rural communities,
p56
aVis that even when they have a mobile screening van
p57
aVthat can go out into the community and perform exams
p58
aVand collect samples
p59
aVand send them to the central hospital for analysis,
p60
aVthat days later,
p61
aVwomen get a call with an abnormal test result
p62
aVand they're asked to come in.
p63
aVFully half of them don't turn up because they can't afford the trip.
p64
aVWith the integrated microscope and computer analysis,
p65
aVRebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van
p66
aVthat has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment setup.
p67
aVAnd what that means is that they can do a diagnosis
p68
aVand perform therapy on the spot,
p69
aVso no one is lost to follow up.
p70
aa(lp71
VThat's just one example of how miniaturization can save lives.
p72
aVNow as engineers,
p73
aVwe think of this as straight-up miniaturization.
p74
aVYou took a big thing and you made it little.
p75
aVBut what I told you before about computers
p76
aVwas that they transformed our lives
p77
aVwhen they became small enough for us to take them everywhere.
p78
aVSo what is the transformational equivalent like that in medicine?
p79
aVWell, what if you had a detector
p80
aVthat was so small that it could circulate in your body,
p81
aVfind the tumor all by itself
p82
aVand send a signal to the outside world?
p83
aVIt sounds a little bit like science fiction.
p84
aVBut actually, nanotechnology allows us to do just that.
p85
aVNanotechnology allows us to shrink the parts that make up the detector
p86
aVfrom the width of a human hair,
p87
aVwhich is 100 microns,
p88
aVto a thousand times smaller,
p89
aVwhich is 100 nanometers.
p90
aVAnd that has profound implications.
p91
aa(lp92
VIt turns out that materials actually change their properties
p93
aVat the nanoscale.
p94
aVYou take a common material like gold,
p95
aVand you grind it into dust, into gold nanoparticles,
p96
aVand it changes from looking gold to looking red.
p97
aVIf you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide \u2014
p98
aVforms a big, black crystal \u2014
p99
aVif you make nanocrystals out of this material
p100
aVand you put it in a liquid,
p101
aVand you shine light on it,
p102
aVthey glow.
p103
aVAnd they glow blue, green, yellow, orange, red,
p104
aVdepending only on their size.
p105
aVIt's wild! Can you imagine an object like that in the macro world?
p106
aVIt would be like all the denim jeans in your closet are all made of cotton,
p107
aVbut they are different colors depending only on their size.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VSo as a physician,
p112
aVwhat's just as interesting to me
p113
aVis that it's not just the color of materials
p114
aVthat changes at the nanoscale;
p115
aVthe way they travel in your body also changes.
p116
aVAnd this is the kind of observation that we're going to use
p117
aVto make a better cancer detector.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo let me show you what I mean.
p120
aVThis is a blood vessel in the body.
p121
aVSurrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.
p122
aVWe're going to inject nanoparticles into the blood vessel
p123
aVand watch how they travel from the bloodstream into the tumor.
p124
aVNow it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky,
p125
aVand so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor.
p126
aVWhether they leak out depends on their size.
p127
aVSo in this image,
p128
aVthe smaller, hundred-nanometer, blue nanoparticles are leaking out,
p129
aVand the larger, 500-nanometer, red nanoparticles
p130
aVare stuck in the bloodstream.
p131
aVSo that means as an engineer,
p132
aVdepending on how big or small I make a material,
p133
aVI can change where it goes in your body.
p134
aa(lp135
VIn my lab, we recently made a cancer nanodetector
p136
aVthat is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors.
p137
aVWe designed it to listen for tumor invasion:
p138
aVthe orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread.
p139
aVFor a tumor to break out of the tissue that it's born in,
p140
aVit has to make chemicals called enzymes
p141
aVto chew through the scaffolding of tissues.
p142
aVWe designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes.
p143
aVOne enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour.
p144
aVNow in engineering, we call that one-to-a-thousand ratio
p145
aVa form of amplification,
p146
aVand it makes something ultrasensitive.
p147
aVSo we've made an ultrasensitive cancer detector.
p148
aa(lp149
VOK, but how do I get this activated signal to the outside world,
p150
aVwhere I can act on it?
p151
aVFor this, we're going to use one more piece of nanoscale biology,
p152
aVand that has to do with the kidney.
p153
aVThe kidney is a filter.
p154
aVIts job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine.
p155
aVIt turns out that what the kidney filters
p156
aVis also dependent on size.
p157
aVSo in this image, what you can see
p158
aVis that everything smaller than five nanometers
p159
aVis going from the blood, through the kidney, into the urine,
p160
aVand everything else that's bigger is retained.
p161
aVOK, so if I make a 100-nanometer cancer detector,
p162
aVI inject it in the bloodstream,
p163
aVit can leak into the tumor where it's activated by tumor enzymes
p164
aVto release a small signal
p165
aVthat is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney
p166
aVand put into the urine,
p167
aVI have a signal in the outside world that I can detect.
p168
aa(lp169
VOK, but there's one more problem.
p170
aVThis is a tiny little signal,
p171
aVso how do I detect it?
p172
aVWell, the signal is just a molecule.
p173
aVThey're molecules that we designed as engineers.
p174
aVThey're completely synthetic, and we can design them
p175
aVso they are compatible with our tool of choice.
p176
aVIf we want to use a really sensitive, fancy instrument
p177
aVcalled a mass spectrometer,
p178
aVthen we make a molecule with a unique mass.
p179
aVOr maybe we want make something that's more inexpensive and portable.
p180
aVThen we make molecules that we can trap on paper,
p181
aVlike a pregnancy test.
p182
aVIn fact, there's a whole world of paper tests
p183
aVthat are becoming available in a field called paper diagnostics.
p184
aa(lp185
VAlright, where are we going with this?
p186
aVWhat I'm going to tell you next,
p187
aVas a lifelong researcher,
p188
aVrepresents a dream of mine.
p189
aVI can't say that's it's a promise;
p190
aVit's a dream.
p191
aVBut I think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward,
p192
aVeven \u2014 and maybe especially \u2014 cancer researchers.
p193
aa(lp194
VI'm going to tell you what I hope will happen with my technology,
p195
aVthat my team and I will put our hearts and souls
p196
aVinto making a reality.
p197
aVOK, here goes.
p198
aVI dream that one day,
p199
aVinstead of going into an expensive screening facility
p200
aVto get a colonoscopy,
p201
aVor a mammogram,
p202
aVor a pap smear,
p203
aVthat you could get a shot,
p204
aVwait an hour,
p205
aVand do a urine test on a paper strip.
p206
aVI imagine that this could even happen
p207
aVwithout the need for steady electricity,
p208
aVor a medical professional in the room.
p209
aVMaybe they could be far away
p210
aVand connected only by the image on a smartphone.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow I know this sounds like a dream,
p213
aVbut in the lab we already have this working in mice,
p214
aVwhere it works better than existing methods
p215
aVfor the detection of lung, colon and ovarian cancer.
p216
aVAnd I hope that what this means
p217
aVis that one day we can detect tumors in patients
p218
aVsooner than 10 years after they've started growing,
p219
aVin all walks of life,
p220
aVall around the globe,
p221
aVand that this would lead to earlier treatments,
p222
aVand that we could save more lives than we can today,
p223
aVwith early detection.
p224
aa(lp225
VThank you.

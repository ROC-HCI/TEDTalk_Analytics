VI'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it,
p5
aVthe problems and the opportunities that we face,
p6
aVand then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic.
p7
aVAnd then I'll let you in on a secret, which is why I am an incurable optimist.
p8
aVLet me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before.
p9
aVNow, you've all seen "Inconvenient Truth." This is a little more inconvenient.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Video): Man: ... extremely dangerous questions.
p12
aVBecause, with our present knowledge, we have no idea what would happen.
p13
aVEven now, man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate
p14
aVthrough the waste products of his civilization.
p15
aVDue to our release, through factories and automobiles every year,
p16
aVof more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide \u2014
p17
aVwhich helps air absorb heat from the sun \u2014
p18
aVour atmosphere seems to be getting warmer.
p19
aVThis is bad?
p20
aVWell, it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would
p21
aVmelt the polar ice caps.
p22
aVAnd if this happens, an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley.
p23
aVTourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami
p24
aVthrough 150 feet of tropical water.
p25
aVFor, in weather, we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety
p26
aVthan even the atomic physicist encounters, but with life itself.
p27
aa(lp28
VLarry Brilliant: Should we feel good, or should we feel bad
p29
aVthat 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little?
p30
aVWell, it depends, really, on what your goals are.
p31
aVAnd I think, as my goals, I always go back to Gandhi's talisman.
p32
aVWhen Mahatma Gandhi was asked,
p33
aV"How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one
p34
aVor the wrong one?" he said, "Consider the face of the poorest,
p35
aVmost vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon,
p36
aVand ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person.
p37
aVAnd if it will be, it's the right thing to do, and if not, rethink it."
p38
aa(lp39
VFor those of us in this room, it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual,
p40
aVit's the community, it's the culture, it's the world itself.
p41
aVAnd the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society,
p42
aVwho are the poorest and the most vulnerable,
p43
aVthe trends give rise to a great case for pessimism.
p44
aVBut there's also a wonderful case for optimism.
p45
aVLet's review them both. First of all, the megatrends.
p46
aVThere's two degrees, or three degrees of climate change baked into the system.
p47
aVIt will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands.
p48
aVIt will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable,
p49
aVas will the increasing rise of population.
p50
aVEven though we've dodged Paul Ehrlich's population bomb,
p51
aVand we will not see 20 billion people in this decade, as he had forecast,
p52
aVwe eat as if we were 20 billion.
p53
aVAnd we consume so much that again, a rise of 6.5 billion to 9.5 billion
p54
aVin our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt
p55
aVthe poorest and the most vulnerable.
p56
aa(lp57
VThat's why they migrate to cities.
p58
aVThat's why in June of this year, we passed, as a species, 51 percent of us living in cities,
p59
aVand bustees, and slums, and shantytowns.
p60
aVThe rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did.
p61
aVThe green revolution never reached Africa.
p62
aVAnd with desertification, sandstorms, the Gobi Desert, the Ogaden,
p63
aVwe are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare
p64
aVto produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo humans are turning more towards animal consumption.
p67
aVIn Africa last year, Africans ate 600 million wild animals,
p68
aVand consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat.
p69
aVAnd every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses
p70
aVthat have never been charted, the genomic sequences of which we don't know.
p71
aVTheir fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of,
p72
aVbut we are ripe for zoonotic-borne, emerging communicable diseases.
p73
aa(lp74
VIncreasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.
p75
aVMost of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side
p76
aV\u2014 in bioweapons, and in technology that puts us on a collision course
p77
aVto magnify any anger, hatred or feeling of marginalization.
p78
aVAnd in fact, with increasing globalization \u2014
p79
aVfor which there are big winners and even bigger losers
p80
aV\u2014 today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history.
p81
aa(lp82
VOne percent of us own 40 percent of all the goods and services.
p83
aVWhat will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day
p84
aVrise to three billion in the next 30 years?
p85
aVThe one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world's goods
p86
aVand services. Not because they've grown richer,
p87
aVbut because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer.
p88
aVLast week, Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said,
p89
aV"This situation is unprecedented, unequal, unfair and unstable."
p90
aa(lp91
VSo there's lots of reason for pessimism.
p92
aVDarfur is, at its origin, a resource war.
p93
aVLast year, there were 85,000 riots in China,
p94
aV230 a day, that required police or military intervention.
p95
aVMost of them were about resources.
p96
aVWe are facing an unprecedented number, scale of disasters.
p97
aVSome are weather-related, human-rights related, epidemics.
p98
aVAnd the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu
p99
aVa quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world.
p100
aVAnd unlike destabilized world in the past, it will be broadcast to you on YouTube,
p101
aVyou will see it on digital television and on your cell phones.
p102
aVWhat will that lead to?
p103
aVFor some, it will lead to anger, religious and sectarian violence and terrorism.
p104
aVFor others, withdrawal, nihilism, materialism.
p105
aVFor us, where does it take us, as social activists and entrepreneurs?
p106
aVAs we look at these trends, do we become despondent, or will we become energized?
p107
aa(lp108
VLet's look at one case, the case of Bangladesh.
p109
aVFirst, even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today,
p110
aVglobal warming would continue.
p111
aVAnd even with global warming \u2014 if you can see these blue lines,
p112
aVthe dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today,
p113
aVthe next decades will see rising sea levels.
p114
aVA minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case
p115
aVthat we can hope for, and it could be 10 times that.
p116
aVWhat will that do to Bangladesh? Let's take a look.
p117
aVSo here's Bangladesh.
p118
aV70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level.
p119
aVLet's go up and take a look at the Himalayas.
p120
aVAnd we'll watch as global warming makes them melt. More water comes down,
p121
aVthe deforested areas, here in the Tarai, will be unable to absorb the effluent,
p122
aVbecause trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water.
p123
aVNow we're looking down south, through the Kali Gandaki.
p124
aVMany of you, I think, have probably trekked here.
p125
aVAnd we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh
p126
aVand see what the impact will be of twin increases in water
p127
aVcoming from the north, and in the seas rising from the south.
p128
aVLooking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh.
p129
aVAnd now let's look from the south, looking up, and let's see this in relief.
p130
aVA minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas,
p131
aVcoupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas. And take a look at this.
p132
aVAs many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate
p133
aVinto India and into China.
p134
aVThis is the difficulty that one country faces.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut if you look at the globe, all around the earth, wherever there is low-lying area,
p137
aVpopulated areas near the water,
p138
aVyou will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life.
p139
aVSub-Saharan Africa, and even our own San Francisco Bay Area.
p140
aVWe're all in this together.
p141
aVThis is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know.
p142
aVGlobal warming is something that happens to all of us, all at once.
p143
aa(lp144
VAs are these newly emerging communicable diseases,
p145
aVnames that you hadn't heard 20 years ago: ebola, lhasa fever, monkey pox.
p146
aVWith the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans,
p147
aVwe live in each other's viral environment.
p148
aVDo you remember, 20 years ago, no one had ever heard of West Nile fever?
p149
aVAnd then we watched, as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States
p150
aVand it marched every year, westwardly.
p151
aVDo you remember no one had heard of ebola
p152
aVuntil we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it?
p153
aVIt's just the beginning, unfortunately.
p154
aVThere have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases
p155
aVthat begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years.
p156
aVIt's more than enough reason for pessimism.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut now let's look at the case for optimism. (Laughter)
p159
aVEnough of the bad news. Human beings have always risen to the challenge.
p160
aVYou just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves.
p161
aVWe've been here before, paralyzed by fear, paralyzed into inaction,
p162
aVwhen some \u2014 probably one of you in this room \u2014 jumped into the breach
p163
aVand created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility,
p164
aVwhich fought against the nuclear threat,
p165
aVMedicins Sans Frontieres, that renewed our commitment to disaster relief,
p166
aVMohamed ElBaradei, and the tremendous hope and optimism that he
p167
aVbrought all of us, and our own Muhammad Yunus.
p168
aa(lp169
VWe've seen the eradication of smallpox.
p170
aVWe may see the eradication of polio this year.
p171
aVLast year, there were only 2,000 cases in the world.
p172
aVWe may see the eradication of guinea worm next year \u2014
p173
aVthere are only 35,000 cases left in the world.
p174
aV20 years ago, there were three and a half million.
p175
aVAnd we've seen a new disease, not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases.
p176
aVThis disease is called sudden wealth syndrome. (Laughter)
p177
aVIt's an amazing phenomenon.
p178
aVAll throughout the technology world, we're seeing young people bitten by this
p179
aVdisease of sudden wealth syndrome.
p180
aVBut they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did.
p181
aVThey're not waiting until they die to create foundations.
p182
aVThey're actively guiding their money, their resources, their hearts, their commitments,
p183
aVto make the world a better place.
p184
aVCertainly, nothing can give you more optimism than that.
p185
aa(lp186
VMore reasons to be optimistic:
p187
aVin the '60s, and I am a creature of the '60s, there was a movement.
p188
aVWe all felt that we were part of it, that a better world was right around the corner,
p189
aVthat we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice.
p190
aVToday, there's another kind of movement. It's a movement to save the earth.
p191
aVIt's just beginning.
p192
aVFive weeks ago, a group of activists from the business community gathered together
p193
aVto stop a Texas utility from building nine coal-fired electrical plants
p194
aVthat would have contributed to destroying the environment.
p195
aVSix months ago, a group of business activists gathered together to join with the
p196
aVRepublican governor in California to pass AB 32,
p197
aVthe most far-reaching legislation in environmental history.
p198
aa(lp199
VAl Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness.
p200
aVCan you imagine? (Laughter)
p201
aVWe're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago
p202
aVI would not have believed, as the evangelical community
p203
aVhas understood the desperate situation of global warming.
p204
aVAnd now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement.
p205
aVIt is something to be greatly optimistic about.
p206
aVThe European 20-20-20 plan is an amazing breakthrough,
p207
aVsomething that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon.
p208
aVAnd on April 14th, there will be Step Up Day, where there will be a thousand
p209
aVindividual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest
p210
aVagainst legislation \u2014 pushing for legislation to stop global warming.
p211
aVAnd on July 7th, around the world, I learned only yesterday,
p212
aVthere will be global Live Earth concerts.
p213
aVAnd you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming
p216
aVhurts the poorest and the weakest the most.
p217
aVThat means that people are beginning the first step,
p218
aVwhich is acting out of their own self-interest.
p219
aVBut I am seeing in the major funders, in CARE, Rockefeller,
p220
aVRockefeller Brothers Fund, Hewlett, Mercy Corps, you guys, Google,
p221
aVso many other organizations, a beginning of understanding that we need
p222
aVto work not just on primary prevention of global warming,
p223
aVbut on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming
p224
aVon the poorest and the most vulnerable.
p225
aa(lp226
VBut for me, I have another reason to be an incurable optimist.
p227
aVAnd you've heard so many inspiring stories here, and I heard so many last night
p228
aVthat I thought I would share a little bit of mine.
p229
aVMy background is not exactly conventional medical training.
p230
aVAnd I lived in a Himalayan monastery, and I studied with a very wise teacher,
p231
aVwho kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny \u2014
p232
aVit felt like Yoda \u2014 it is your destiny to go to work for WHO
p233
aVand to help eradicate smallpox,
p234
aVat a time when there was no smallpox program.
p235
aa(lp236
VIt should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists
p237
aVbecause it was the worst disease in history.
p238
aVIn the last century \u2014 that's the one that was seven years ago \u2014
p239
aVhalf a billion people died from smallpox:
p240
aVmore than all the wars in history,
p241
aVmore than any other infectious disease in the history of the world.
p242
aVIn the Summer of Love, in 1967, two million people, children, died of smallpox.
p243
aVIt's not ancient history.
p244
aVWhen you read the biblical plague of boils, that was smallpox.
p245
aVPharaoh Ramses the Fifth, whose picture is here, died of smallpox.
p246
aVTo eradicate smallpox, we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history.
p247
aVWe visited every house in India, searching for smallpox \u2014 120 million houses,
p248
aVonce every month, for nearly two years.
p249
aVIn a cruel reversal, after we had almost conquered smallpox \u2014
p250
aVand this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur, the realm of the final inch.
p251
aa(lp252
VWhen we had almost eradicated smallpox, it came back again,
p253
aVbecause the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers,
p254
aVwho could come there and get employment.
p255
aVAnd they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox,
p256
aVand they went home to die.
p257
aVAnd when they did, they took smallpox to 10 other countries
p258
aVand reignited the epidemic.
p259
aVAnd we had to start all over again.
p260
aVBut, in the end, we succeeded, and the last case of smallpox:
p261
aVthis little girl, Rahima Banu \u2014 Barisal, in Bangladesh \u2014
p262
aVwhen she coughed or breathed, and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs
p263
aVand fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus,
p264
aVthus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror.
p265
aa(lp266
VHow can that not make you optimistic?
p267
aVA disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India, and blinded half of
p268
aVall of those who were made blind in India, ended.
p269
aVAnd most importantly for us here in this room, a bond was created.
p270
aVDoctors, health workers, from 30 different countries,
p271
aVof every race, every religion, every color, worked together,
p272
aVfought alongside each other,
p273
aVfought against a common enemy, didn't fight against each other.
p274
aVHow can that not make you feel optimistic for the future?
p275
aVThank you very much.

Trained as a doctor, he was living in a Himalayan monastery in the early 1970s when his guru told him he should help rid the world of smallpox. He joined the World Health Organization&#39;s eradication project, directed efforts to eliminate the disease in India and eventually presided over the last case of smallpox on the planet.  </p><p>Not content with beating a single disease, he founded the nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.seva.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Seva Foundation</a>, which has cured more than two million people of blindness in 15 countries through innovative surgery, self-sufficient eye care systems and low-cost manufacturing of intraocular lenses. Outside the medical field, he found time to cofound the legendary online community The Well, and run two public tech companies. <em>Time</em> and <em>WIRED</em> magazines call him a &quot;technology visionary.&quot; </p><p> His 2006 <a href=\\"/pages/prizewinner_larry_brilliant\\">TED Prize wish</a>  drew on both sides of his career: He challenged the TED community to help him build a global early-response system to spot new diseases&nbsp;as quickly as they emerge.

So, between consulting on the WHO&#39;s polio eradication project and designing a disease-surveillance network, he harnessed Google&#39;s brains and billions in a mix of for-profit and nonprofit ventures tackling the global problems of disease, poverty and climate change. Today, Brilliant is Chair of the&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.skollglobalthreats.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Skoll Global Threats Fund</a>, where he heads a team whose mission is to confront global threats imperiling humanity:  pandemics, climate change, water security, nuclear proliferation and Middle East conflict.</p>", "slug": "larry_brilliant", "whotheyare": "TED Prize winner Larry Brilliant has spent his career solving the ills of today -- from overseeing the last smallpox cases to saving millions from blindness -- and building technologies of the future.

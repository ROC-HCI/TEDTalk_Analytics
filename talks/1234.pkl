VSo I'm a doctor, but I kind of slipped sideways into research,
p5
aVand now I'm an epidemiologist.
p6
aVAnd nobody really knows what epidemiology is.
p7
aVEpidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world
p8
aVif something is good for you or bad for you.
p9
aVAnd it's best understood through example
p10
aVas the science of those crazy, wacky newspaper headlines.
p11
aVAnd these are just some of the examples.
p12
aa(lp13
VThese are from the Daily Mail.
p14
aVEvery country in the world has a newspaper like this.
p15
aVIt has this bizarre, ongoing philosophical project
p16
aVof dividing all the inanimate objects in the world
p17
aVinto the ones that either cause or prevent cancer.
p18
aVHere are some of the things they said cause cancer:
p19
aVdivorce, Wi-Fi, toiletries and coffee.
p20
aVSome things they say prevent cancer:
p21
aVcrusts, red pepper, licorice and coffee.
p22
aVSo you can see there are contradictions.
p23
aVCoffee both causes and prevents cancer.
p24
aVAs you start to read on, you can see
p25
aVthat maybe there's some political valence behind some of this.
p26
aVFor women, housework prevents breast cancer,
p27
aVbut for men, shopping could make you impotent.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VSo we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this.
p32
aVAnd what I hope to show is that unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims
p33
aVisn't a kind of nasty, carping activity;
p34
aVit's socially useful.
p35
aVBut it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool,
p36
aVbecause real science is about critically appraising the evidence
p37
aVfor somebody else's position.
p38
aVThat's what happens in academic journals,
p39
aVit's what happens at academic conferences \u2014
p40
aVthe Q&A session after a postdoc presents data is often a bloodbath.
p41
aVAnd nobody minds that; we actively welcome it.
p42
aVIt's like a consenting intellectual S&M activity.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VSo what I'm going to show you is all of the main things,
p47
aVall of the main features of my discipline, evidence-based medicine.
p48
aVAnd I will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work,
p49
aVexclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong.
p50
aa(lp51
VWe'll start with the absolute weakest form of evidence known to man,
p52
aVand that is authority.
p53
aVIn science, we don't care how many letters you have after your name \u2014
p54
aVwe want to know what your reasons are for believing something.
p55
aVHow do you know that something is good for us or bad for us?
p56
aVBut we're also unimpressed by authority because it's so easy to contrive.
p57
aVThis is somebody called Dr. Gillian McKeith, PhD,
p58
aVor, to give her full medical title, Gillian McKeith.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VAgain, every country has somebody like this.
p63
aVShe is our TV diet guru.
p64
aVShe has five series of prime-time television,
p65
aVgiving out very lavish and exotic health advice.
p66
aVShe, it turns out, has a non-accredited correspondence course PhD
p67
aVfrom somewhere in America.
p68
aVShe also boasts that she's a certified professional member
p69
aVof the American Association of Nutritional Consultants,
p70
aVwhich sounds very glamorous; you get a certificate.
p71
aVThis one belongs to my dead cat, Hettie. She was a horrible cat.
p72
aVYou go to the website, fill out the form,
p73
aVgive them $60, it arrives in the post.
p74
aVThat's not the only reason we think this person is an idiot.
p75
aVShe also says things like eat lots of dark green leaves,
p76
aVthey contain chlorophyll and really oxygenate your blood.
p77
aVAnd anybody who's done school biology remembers
p78
aVthat chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight,
p79
aVand it's quite dark in your bowels after you've eaten spinach.
p80
aa(lp81
VNext, we need proper science, proper evidence.
p82
aVSo: "Red wine can help prevent breast cancer."
p83
aVThis is a headline from The Daily Telegraph in the UK.
p84
aV"A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer."
p85
aVSo you find this paper, and find that it is a real piece of science.
p86
aVIt's a description of the changes in the behavior of one enzyme
p87
aVwhen you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin
p88
aVonto some cancer cells
p89
aVin a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere.
p90
aVAnd that's a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper.
p91
aVBut on the question of your own personal risk of getting breast cancer
p92
aVif you drink red wine,
p93
aVit tells you absolutely bugger all.
p94
aVActually, it turns out that your risk of breast cancer
p95
aVincreases slightly with every amount of alcohol you drink.
p96
aVSo what we want are studies in real human people.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd here's another example.
p99
aVThis is from Britain's "leading" diet nutritionist in the Daily Mirror,
p100
aVour second-biggest selling newspaper.
p101
aV"An Australian study in 2001 found that olive oil,
p102
aVin combination with fruits, vegetables and pulses,
p103
aVoffers measurable protection against skin wrinklings,"
p104
aVand give the advice:
p105
aV"If you eat olive oil and vegetables, you'll have fewer wrinkles."
p106
aVThey helpfully tell you how to find the paper,
p107
aVand what you find is an observational study.
p108
aVObviously, nobody has been able to go back to 1930,
p109
aVget all the people born in one maternity unit,
p110
aVand half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil,
p111
aVhalf of them eat McDonald's,
p112
aVand then we see how many wrinkles you've got later.
p113
aa(lp114
VYou have to take a snapshot of how people are now.
p115
aVAnd what you find is, of course:
p116
aVpeople who eat veg and olive oil have fewer wrinkles.
p117
aVBut that's because people who eat fruit and veg and olive oil are freaks \u2014
p118
aVthey're not normal, they're like you; they come to events like this.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VThey're posh, they're wealthy, less likely to have outdoor jobs,
p123
aVless likely to do manual labor,
p124
aVthey have better social support, are less likely to smoke;
p125
aVfor a host of fascinating, interlocking
p126
aVsocial, political and cultural reasons,
p127
aVthey're less likely to have wrinkles.
p128
aVThat doesn't mean it's the vegetables or olive oil.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VSo ideally, what you want to do is a trial.
p133
aVPeople think they're familiar with the idea of a trial.
p134
aVTrials are old; the first one was in the Bible, Daniel 1:12.
p135
aVIt's straightforward: take a bunch of people, split them in half,
p136
aVtreat one group one way, the other group, the other way.
p137
aVA while later, you see what happened to each of them.
p138
aVI'm going to tell you about one trial,
p139
aVwhich is probably the most well-reported trial
p140
aVin the UK news media over the past decade.
p141
aVThis is the trial of fish oil pills.
p142
aVThe claim: fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior
p143
aVin mainstream children.
p144
aVThey said, "We did a trial.
p145
aVAll the previous ones were positive, this one will be too."
p146
aVThat should ring alarm bells:
p147
aVif you know the answer to your trial, you shouldn't be doing one.
p148
aVEither you've rigged it by design,
p149
aVor you've got enough data so there's no need to randomize people anymore.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo this is what they were going to do in their trial:
p152
aVThey were taking 3,000 children,
p153
aVthey were going to give them these huge fish oil pills, six of them a day,
p154
aVand then, a year later, measure their school exam performance
p155
aVand compare their performance
p156
aVagainst what they predicted their exam performance would have been
p157
aVif they hadn't had the pills.
p158
aVNow, can anybody spot a flaw in this design?
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd no professors of clinical trial methodology
p163
aVare allowed to answer this question.
p164
aVSo there's no control group.
p165
aVBut that sounds really techie, right? That's a technical term.
p166
aVThe kids got the pills, and their performance improved.
p167
aa(lp168
VWhat else could it possibly be if it wasn't the pills?
p169
aVThey got older; we all develop over time.
p170
aVAnd of course, there's the placebo effect,
p171
aVone of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine.
p172
aVIt's not just taking a pill and performance or pain improving;
p173
aVit's about our beliefs and expectations, the cultural meaning of a treatment.
p174
aVAnd this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies
p175
aVcomparing one kind of placebo against another.
p176
aVSo we know, for example,
p177
aVthat two sugar pills a day are a more effective treatment
p178
aVfor gastric ulcers
p179
aVthan one sugar pill.
p180
aVTwo sugar pills a day beats one a day.
p181
aVThat's an outrageous and ridiculous finding, but it's true.
p182
aVWe know from three different studies on three different types of pain
p183
aVthat a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment
p184
aVthan a sugar pill, a dummy pill with no medicine in it,
p185
aVnot because the injection or pills do anything physically to the body,
p186
aVbut because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention.
p187
aVSo we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated,
p188
aVwhich is why we do trials where we control against a placebo,
p189
aVwhere one half of the people get the real treatment,
p190
aVand the other half get placebo.
p191
aa(lp192
VBut that's not enough.
p193
aVWhat I've just shown you are examples
p194
aVof the very simple and straightforward ways
p195
aVthat journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths
p196
aVcan distort evidence for their own purposes.
p197
aVWhat I find really fascinating
p198
aVis that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds
p199
aVof tricks and devices,
p200
aVbut slightly more sophisticated versions of them,
p201
aVin order to distort the evidence they give to doctors and patients,
p202
aVand which we use to make vitally important decisions.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo firstly, trials against placebo:
p205
aVeverybody thinks a trial should be a comparison
p206
aVof your new drug against placebo.
p207
aVBut in a lot of situations that's wrong;
p208
aVoften, we already have a good treatment currently available.
p209
aVSo we don't want to know that your alternative new treatment
p210
aVis better than nothing,
p211
aVbut that it's better than the best available treatment we have.
p212
aVAnd yet, repeatedly, you consistently see people doing trials
p213
aVstill against placebo.
p214
aVAnd you can get licensed to bring your drug to market
p215
aVwith only data showing that it's better than nothing,
p216
aVwhich is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision.
p217
aa(lp218
VBut that's not the only way you can rig your data.
p219
aVYou can also rig your data
p220
aVby making the thing you compare your new drug against
p221
aVreally rubbish.
p222
aVYou can give the competing drug in too low a dose,
p223
aVso people aren't properly treated.
p224
aVYou can give the competing drug in too high a dose,
p225
aVso people get side effects.
p226
aVAnd this is exactly what happened
p227
aVwith antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.
p228
aVTwenty years ago, a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in;
p229
aVthe promise was they would have fewer side effects.
p230
aVSo people set about doing trials of the new drugs against the old drugs.
p231
aVBut they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses:
p232
aV20 milligrams a day of haloperidol.
p233
aVAnd it's a foregone conclusion if you give a drug at that high a dose,
p234
aVit will have more side effects, and your new drug will look better.
p235
aa(lp236
VTen years ago, history repeated itself,
p237
aVwhen risperidone, the first of the new-generation antipsychotic drugs,
p238
aVcame off copyright, so anybody could make copies.
p239
aVEverybody wanted to show their drug was better than risperidone,
p240
aVso you see trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs
p241
aVagainst risperidone at eight milligrams a day.
p242
aVAgain, not an insane dose, not an illegal dose,
p243
aVbut very much at the high end of normal.
p244
aVSo you're bound to make your new drug look better.
p245
aVAnd so it's no surprise that overall,
p246
aVindustry-funded trials are four times more likely
p247
aVto give a positive result
p248
aVthan independently sponsored trials.
p249
aa(lp250
VBut \u2014 and it's a big but \u2014
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
Vit turns out,
p255
aVwhen you look at the methods used by industry-funded trials,
p256
aVthat they're actually better than independently sponsored trials.
p257
aVAnd yet, they always manage to get the result that they want.
p258
aVSo how does this work?
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VHow can we explain this strange phenomenon?
p263
aVWell, it turns out that what happens
p264
aVis the negative data goes missing in action;
p265
aVit's withheld from doctors and patients.
p266
aVAnd this is the most important aspect of the whole story.
p267
aVIt's at the top of the pyramid of evidence.
p268
aVWe need to have all of the data on a particular treatment
p269
aVto know whether or not it really is effective.
p270
aVThere are two different ways you can spot whether some data has gone missing.
p271
aVYou can use statistics or you can use stories.
p272
aVI prefer statistics, so that's what I'll do first.
p273
aa(lp274
VThis is a funnel plot.
p275
aVA funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting
p276
aVif small negative trials have disappeared, have gone missing in action.
p277
aVThis is a graph of all of the trials done on a particular treatment.
p278
aVAs you go up towards the top of the graph,
p279
aVwhat you see is each dot is a trial.
p280
aVAs you go up, those are bigger trials, so they've got less error;
p281
aVthey're less likely to be randomly false positives or negatives.
p282
aVSo they all cluster together.
p283
aVThe big trials are closer to the true answer.
p284
aVThen as you go further down at the bottom,
p285
aVwhat you can see is, on this side, spurious false negatives,
p286
aVand over on this side, spurious false positives.
p287
aVIf there is publication bias,
p288
aVif small negative trials have gone missing in action,
p289
aVyou can see it on one of these graphs.
p290
aVSo you see here that the small negative trials
p291
aVthat should be on the bottom left have disappeared.
p292
aVThis is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias
p293
aVin studies of publication bias.
p294
aVAnd I think that's the funniest epidemiology joke you will ever hear.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VThat's how you can prove it statistically.
p299
aVBut what about stories?
p300
aVWell, they're heinous, they really are.
p301
aVThis is a drug called reboxetine.
p302
aVThis is a drug which I, myself, have prescribed to patients.
p303
aVAnd I'm a very nerdy doctor.
p304
aVI hope I go out of my way
p305
aVto try and read and understand all the literature.
p306
aVI read the trials on this.
p307
aVThey were all positive, all well-conducted.
p308
aVI found no flaw.
p309
aVUnfortunately, it turned out, that many of these trials were withheld.
p310
aVIn fact, 76 percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug
p311
aVwere withheld from doctors and patients.
p312
aVNow if you think about it,
p313
aVif I tossed a coin a hundred times,
p314
aVand I'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times,
p315
aVthen I can convince you that I have a coin with two heads.
p316
aVIf we remove half of the data,
p317
aVwe can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd this is not an isolated story.
p320
aVAround half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld,
p321
aVbut it goes way beyond that.
p322
aVThe Nordic Cochrane Group were trying to get ahold of the data on that
p323
aVto bring it all together.
p324
aVThe Cochrane Groups are an international nonprofit collaboration
p325
aVthat produce systematic reviews
p326
aVof all of the data that has ever been shown.
p327
aVAnd they need to have access to all of the trial data.
p328
aVBut the companies withheld that data from them.
p329
aVSo did the European Medicines Agency \u2014
p330
aVfor three years.
p331
aa(lp332
VThis is a problem that is currently lacking a solution.
p333
aVAnd to show how big it goes, this is a drug called Tamiflu,
p334
aVwhich governments around the world
p335
aVhave spent billions and billions of dollars on.
p336
aVAnd they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug
p337
aVwhich will reduce the rate of complications with flu.
p338
aVWe already have the data
p339
aVshowing it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours.
p340
aVBut I don't care about that, governments don't care.
p341
aVI'm sorry if you have the flu, I know it's horrible,
p342
aVbut we're not going to spend billions of dollars
p343
aVtrying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day.
p344
aVWe prescribe these drugs.
p345
aVWe stockpile them for emergencies
p346
aVon the understanding they'll reduce the number of complications,
p347
aVwhich means pneumonia and death.
p348
aVThe infectious diseases Cochrane Group, which are based in Italy,
p349
aVhas been trying to get the full data in a usable form
p350
aVout of the drug companies,
p351
aVso they can make a full decision
p352
aVabout whether this drug is effective or not,
p353
aVand they've not been able to get that information.
p354
aVThis is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem
p355
aVfacing medicine today.
p356
aVWe cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo it's a little bit difficult from there
p359
aVto spin in some kind of positive conclusion.
p360
aVBut I would say this:
p361
aVI think that sunlight
p362
aVis the best disinfectant.
p363
aVAll of these things are happening in plain sight,
p364
aVand they're all protected by a force field of tediousness.
p365
aVAnd I think, with all of the problems in science,
p366
aVone of the best things that we can do
p367
aVis to lift up the lid, finger around at the mechanics
p368
aVand peer in.
p369
aa(lp370
VThank you very much.

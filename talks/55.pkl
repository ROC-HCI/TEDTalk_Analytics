VI can't help but this wish:
p5
aVto think about when you're a little kid, and all your friends ask you,
p6
aV"If a genie could give you one wish in the world,
p7
aVwhat would it be?"
p8
aVAnd I always answered,
p9
aV"Well, I'd want the wish
p10
aVto have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for."
p11
aVWell, then you'd be screwed,
p12
aVbecause you'd know what to wish for, and you'd use up your wish,
p13
aVand now, since we only have one wish \u2014 unlike last year they had three wishes \u2014
p14
aVI'm not going to wish for that.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo let's get to what I would like, which is world peace.
p17
aVAnd I know what you're thinking:
p18
aVYou're thinking, "The poor girl up there,
p19
aVshe thinks she's at a beauty pageant.
p20
aVShe's not. She's at the TED Prize."
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVBut I really do think it makes sense.
p23
aVAnd I think that the first step to world peace
p24
aVis for people to meet each other.
p25
aVI've met a lot of different people over the years,
p26
aVand I've filmed some of them,
p27
aVfrom a dotcom executive in New York who wanted to take over the world,
p28
aVto a military press officer in Qatar,
p29
aVwho would rather not take over the world.
p30
aVIf you've seen the film "Control Room" that was sent out,
p31
aVyou'd understand a little bit why.
p32
aV(Applause)
p33
aVThank you.
p34
aVWow! Some of you watched it. That's great. That's great.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo basically what I'd like to talk about today
p37
aVis a way for people to travel,
p38
aVto meet people in a different way than \u2014
p39
aVbecause you can't travel all over the world at the same time.
p40
aVAnd a long time ago \u2014 well, about 40 years ago \u2014
p41
aVmy mom had an exchange student.
p42
aVAnd I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student.
p43
aVThis is Donna.
p44
aVThis is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.
p45
aVThis is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike.
p46
aVThis is Donna eating ice cream.
p47
aVAnd this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance.
p48
aVI really think as the world is getting smaller,
p49
aVit becomes more and more important
p50
aVthat we learn each other's dance moves,
p51
aVthat we meet each other, we get to know each other,
p52
aVwe are able to figure out a way to cross borders,
p53
aVto understand each other, to understand people's hopes and dreams,
p54
aVwhat makes them laugh and cry.
p55
aVAnd I know that we can't all do exchange programs,
p56
aVand I can't force everybody to travel;
p57
aVI've already talked about that to Chris and Amy,
p58
aVand they said that there's a problem with this:
p59
aVYou can't force people, free will.
p60
aVAnd I totally support that, so we're not forcing people to travel.
p61
aVBut I'd like to talk about another way to travel
p62
aVthat doesn't require a ship or an airplane,
p63
aVand just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen.
p64
aVAnd that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.
p65
aa(lp66
VI was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from,
p67
aVand Cameron, I don't know how you managed to get out of that one,
p68
aVbut I think that building bridges is important to me
p69
aVbecause of where I come from.
p70
aVI'm the daughter of an American mother
p71
aVand an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.
p72
aVSo I'm the living product of two cultures coming together.
p73
aVNo pun intended.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVAnd I've also been called,
p76
aVas an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American with a Persian name,
p77
aVthe "Middle East Peace Crisis."
p78
aa(lp79
VSo maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way
p80
aVto bring both sides of my family together \u2014
p81
aVa way to take the worlds with me, a way to tell stories visually.
p82
aVIt all kind of started that way,
p83
aVbut I think that I really realized the power of the image
p84
aVwhen I first went to the garbage-collecting village
p85
aVin Egypt, when I was about 16.
p86
aVMy mother took me there.
p87
aVShe's somebody who believes strongly in community service,
p88
aVand decided that this was something that I needed to do.
p89
aVAnd so I went there and I met some amazing women there.
p90
aVThere was a center there,
p91
aVwhere they were teaching people how to read and write,
p92
aVand get vaccinations against the many diseases
p93
aVyou can get from sorting through garbage.
p94
aVAnd I began teaching there.
p95
aVI taught English, and I met some incredible women there.
p96
aVI met people that live seven people to a room,
p97
aVbarely can afford their evening meal,
p98
aVyet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor
p99
aVand just incredible qualities.
p100
aa(lp101
VI got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there.
p102
aVI took pictures of weddings and older family members \u2014
p103
aVthings that they wanted memories of.
p104
aVAbout two years after I started taking these pictures,
p105
aVthe UN Conference on Population and Development
p106
aVasked me to show them at the conference.
p107
aVSo I was 18; I was very excited.
p108
aVIt was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there,
p109
aVand after about two days, they all came down except for three.
p110
aVPeople were very upset,
p111
aVvery angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo,
p112
aVand why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame?
p113
aVAnd as I sat there, I got very depressed.
p114
aVI looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs
p115
aVthat were, you know, very pretty photographs
p116
aVand I was like, "I failed at this."
p117
aVBut I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling
p118
aVthat had come out of people just seeing these photographs.
p119
aVHere I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak that nobody listened to,
p120
aVand all of a sudden, I put these photographs on the wall,
p121
aVand there were arguments, and they had to be taken down.
p122
aVAnd I saw the power of the image, and it was incredible.
p123
aVAnd I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually from people
p124
aVthat would never have gone to the garbage village themselves,
p125
aVthat would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive
p126
aVin such difficult circumstances.
p127
aVAnd I think it was at that point
p128
aVthat I decided I wanted to use photography and film
p129
aVto somehow bridge gaps, to bridge cultures,
p130
aVbring people together, cross borders.
p131
aVAnd so that's what really kind of started me off.
p132
aa(lp133
VDid a stint at MTV, made a film called "Startup.com,"
p134
aVand I've done a couple of music films.
p135
aVBut in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start,
p136
aVit was a very surreal feeling for me,
p137
aVbecause before the war started,
p138
aVthere was kind of this media war that was going on.
p139
aVAnd I was watching television in New York,
p140
aVand there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across,
p141
aVand the coverage went from the US State Department
p142
aVto embedded troops.
p143
aVAnd what was coming across on the news
p144
aVwas that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings,
p145
aVand the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators,
p146
aVand throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad.
p147
aVAnd I knew that there was a completely other story
p148
aVthat was taking place in the Middle East, where my parents were.
p149
aVI knew that there was a completely other story being told,
p150
aVand I was thinking, "How are people supposed to communicate with each other
p151
aVwhen they're getting completely different messages,
p152
aVand nobody knows what the other's being told?
p153
aVHow are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding
p154
aVor know how to move together into the future?
p155
aVSo I knew that I had to go there.
p156
aVI just wanted to be in the center.
p157
aVI had no plan. I had no funding.
p158
aVI didn't even have a camera at the time \u2014 I had somebody bring it there,
p159
aVbecause I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera,
p160
aVGeorge Bush's favorite channel,
p161
aVand a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked
p162
aVby many governments across the Arab world,
p163
aVand also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden
p164
aVby some people in the US government.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo I was thinking, this station that's hated by so many people
p167
aVhas to be doing something right.
p168
aVI've got to go see what this is all about.
p169
aVAnd I also wanted to go see Central Command,
p170
aVwhich was 10 minutes away.
p171
aVAnd that way, I could get access to how this news was being created \u2014
p172
aVon the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,
p173
aVand on the US and Western side, reaching the US.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd when I went there and sat there,
p176
aVand met these people that were in the center of it,
p177
aVand sat with these characters,
p178
aVI met some surprising, very complex people.
p179
aVAnd I'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience
p180
aVof when you sit with somebody
p181
aVand you film them, and you listen to them,
p182
aVand you allow them more than a five-second sound bite.
p183
aVThe amazing complexity of people emerges.
p184
aa(lp185
VSamir Khader: Business as usual.
p186
aVIraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.
p187
aVBut between us, if I'm offered a job with Fox, I'll take it.
p188
aVTo change the Arab nightmare into the American dream.
p189
aVI still have that dream.
p190
aVMaybe I will never be able to do it,
p191
aVbut I have plans for my children.
p192
aVWhen they finish high school,
p193
aVI will send them to America to study there.
p194
aVI will pay for their study.
p195
aVAnd they will stay there.
p196
aVJosh Rushing: The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers \u2014
p197
aVAl Jazeera showed them \u2014
p198
aVit was powerful, because America doesn't show those kinds of images.
p199
aVMost of the news in America won't show really gory images
p200
aVand this showed American soldiers in uniform, strewn about a floor,
p201
aVa cold tile floor.
p202
aVAnd it was revolting.
p203
aVIt was absolutely revolting.
p204
aVIt made me sick at my stomach.
p205
aVAnd then what hit me was, the night before,
p206
aVthere had been some kind of bombing in Basra,
p207
aVand Al Jazeera had shown images of the people.
p208
aVAnd they were equally, if not more, horrifying \u2014 the images were.
p209
aVAnd I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office,
p210
aVand thought to myself, "Wow, that's gross.
p211
aVThat's bad."
p212
aVAnd then going away, and probably eating dinner or something.
p213
aVAnd it didn't affect me as much.
p214
aVSo, the impact that had on me \u2014
p215
aVme realizing that I just saw people on the other side,
p216
aVand those people in the Al Jazeera office
p217
aVmust have felt the way I was feeling that night,
p218
aVand it upset me on a profound level
p219
aVthat I wasn't as bothered as much the night before.
p220
aVIt makes me hate war.
p221
aVBut it doesn't make me believe that we're in a world
p222
aVthat can live without war yet.
p223
aa(lp224
VJehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed by the response of the film.
p225
aVWe didn't know whether it would be able to get out there.
p226
aVWe had no funding for it.
p227
aVWe were incredibly lucky that it got picked up.
p228
aVAnd when we showed the film
p229
aVin both the United States and the Arab world,
p230
aVwe had such incredible reactions.
p231
aVIt was amazing to see how people were moved by this film.
p232
aVIn the Arab world \u2014
p233
aVand it's not really by the film, it's by the characters \u2014
p234
aVI mean, Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person
p235
aVwho was thinking about things.
p236
aVAnd when I showed the film in the Middle East,
p237
aVpeople wanted to meet Josh.
p238
aVHe kind of redefined us as an American population.
p239
aVPeople started to ask me, "Where is this guy now?"
p240
aVAl Jazeera offered him a job.
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aVAnd Samir, on the other hand,
p243
aVwas also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see,
p244
aVbecause it brought out the complexities of this love-hate relationship
p245
aVthat the Arab world has with the West.
p246
aa(lp247
VIn the United States, I was blown away by the motivations,
p248
aVthe positive motivations of the American people
p249
aVwhen they'd see this film.
p250
aVYou know, we're criticized abroad
p251
aVfor believing we're the saviors of the world in some way,
p252
aVbut the flip side of it is that, actually,
p253
aVwhen people do see what is happening abroad
p254
aVand people's reactions to some of our policy abroad,
p255
aVwe feel this power, that we need to \u2014
p256
aVwe feel like we have to get the power to change things.
p257
aVAnd I saw this with audiences.
p258
aVThis woman came up to me after the screening and said,
p259
aV"You know, I know this is crazy.
p260
aVI saw the bombs being loaded on the planes,
p261
aVI saw the military going out to war,
p262
aVbut you don't understand people's anger towards us
p263
aVuntil you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war,
p264
aVand how do we get out of this bubble?
p265
aa(lp266
VHow do we understand what the other person is thinking?"
p267
aVNow, I don't know whether a film can change the world.
p268
aVBut I know the power of it,
p269
aVI know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow, I'm not a philosopher,
p272
aVso I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this,
p273
aVbut let film speak for itself and take you to this other world.
p274
aVBecause I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders,
p275
aVI'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes
p276
aVbeing taken into another world.
p277
aVAnd these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts
p278
aVthat we're faced with today.
p279
aV[The last 48 hours of two Palestinian suicide bombers.]

aV[Paradise Now]

p283

p285
aV[If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier.]
p286
aa(lp287
V[Man: If we had airplanes, we wouldn't need martyrs, that's the difference.]
p288
aa(lp289
V[Woman: The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger.]
p290
aa(lp291
V[Man: Then let us be equal in death.]
p292
aV[We still have Paradise.]
p293
aa(lp294
V[Woman: There is no Paradise! It only exists in your head!]
p295
aa(lp296
V[Man: God forbid!]
p297
aV[May God forgive you.]
p298
aV[If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...]
p299
aV[Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell!]
p300
aV[In this life, we're dead anyway.]
p301
aa(lp302
V[One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer.]
p303
aa(lp304
V[Woman: And what about us? The ones who remain?]
p305
aV[Will we win that way?]
p306
aV[Don't you see what you're doing is destroying us?]
p307
aV[And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on?]
p308
aa(lp309
V[Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?]
p310
aa(lp311
V[Woman: Perhaps. We have to turn it into a moral war.]
p312
aa(lp313
V[Man: How, if Israel has no morals?]
p314

aV[Tzvika off-screen: We're looking for three girls.]

p359
aV[We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot, who lost children,]

aVBut I tell you, when you finish that song,
p373

p386
aa(lp387
VJehane Noujaim: I think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater,
p388
aVin a dark room, with other strangers, watching a very powerful film,
p389
aVand they felt that feeling of transformation.
p390
aVAnd what I'd like to talk about is
p391
aVhow can we use that feeling
p392
aVto actually create a movement through film?
p393
aVI've been listening to the talks in the conference,
p394
aVand Robert Wright said yesterday
p395
aVthat if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity,
p396
aVthen they will have an appreciation for ours.
p397
aVAnd that's what this is about.
p398
aVIt's about connecting people through film,
p399
aVgetting these independent voices out there.
p400
aVNow, Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military
p401
aVand taking a job with Al Jazeera.
p402
aV(Laughter)
p403
aVSo his feeling is that he's at Al Jazeera International
p404
aVbecause he feels like he can actually use media
p405
aVto bridge the gap between East and West.
p406
aVAnd that's an amazing thing.
p407
aVBut I've been trying to think about ways
p408
aVto give power to these independent voices,
p409
aVto give power to the filmmakers,
p410
aVto give power to people who are trying to use film for change.
p411
aVAnd there are incredible organizations
p412
aVthat are out there doing this already.
p413
aVThere's Witness, that you heard from earlier.
p414
aVThere's Just Vision, that are working with Palestinians and Israelis
p415
aVwho are working together for peace, and documenting that process
p416
aVand getting interviews out there and using this film
p417
aVto take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool,
p418
aVto show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack,
p419
aVand she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this.
p420
aVThere's Working Films and there's Current TV,
p421
aVwhich is an incredible platform for people around the world
p422
aVto be able to put their \u2014
p423
aV(Applause)
p424
aVYeah, it's amazing.
p425
aVI've watched it and I'm blown away by it
p426
aVand its potential to bring voices from around the world \u2014
p427
aVindependent voices from around the world \u2014
p428
aVand create a truly democratic, global television.
p429
aa(lp430
VSo what can we do to create a platform for these organizations,
p431
aVto create some momentum,
p432
aVto get everybody in the world involved in this movement?
p433
aVI'd like for us to imagine for a second.
p434
aVImagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world.
p435
aVYou have towns and villages and theaters \u2014
p436
aVall from around the world,
p437
aVgetting together, and sitting in the dark,
p438
aVand sharing a communal experience of watching a film,
p439
aVor a couple of films, together.
p440
aVWatching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live,
p441
aVor just a character that defies stereotypes,
p442
aVmakes a joke, sings a song.
p443
aVComedies, documentaries, shorts.
p444
aVThis amazing power can be used to change people
p445
aVand to bond people together; to cross borders,
p446
aVand have people feel like they're having a communal experience.
p447
aVSo if you imagine this day when all around the world,
p448
aVyou have theaters and places where we project films.
p449
aVIf you imagine projecting from Times Square
p450
aVto Tahrir Square in Cairo,
p451
aVthe same film in Ramallah, the same film in Jerusalem.
p452
aVYou know, we've been talking to a friend of mine
p453
aVabout using the side of the Great Pyramid
p454
aVand the Great Wall of China.
p455
aVIt's endless what you can imagine,
p456
aVin terms of where you can project films
p457
aVand where you can have this communal experience.
p458
aVAnd I believe that this one day, if we can create it,
p459
aVthis one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices.
p460
aVThere isn't an organization which is connecting the independent voices
p461
aVof the world to get out there,
p462
aVand yet I'm hearing throughout this conference
p463
aVthat the biggest challenge in our future
p464
aVis understanding the other,
p465
aVand having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders.
p466
aVAnd if film can do that,
p467
aVand if we can get all of these different locations in the world
p468
aVto watch these films together \u2014
p469
aVthis could be an incredible day.
p470
aa(lp471
VSo we've already made a partnership,
p472
aVset up through somebody from the TED community,
p473
aVJohn Camen, who introduced me to Steven Apkon,
p474
aVfrom the Jacob Burns Film Center.
p475
aVAnd we started calling up everybody.
p476
aVAnd in the last week,
p477
aVthere have been so many people that have responded to us,
p478
aVfrom as close as Palo Alto, to Mongolia and to India.
p479
aVThere are people that want to be a part of this global day of film;
p480
aVto be able to provide a platform for independent voices
p481
aVand independent films to get out there.
p482
aVNow, we've thought about a name for this day,
p483
aVand I'd like to share this with you.
p484
aVNow, the most amazing part of this whole process
p485
aVhas been sharing ideas and wishes,
p486
aVand so I invite you to give brainstorms onto
p487
aVhow does this day echo into the future?
p488
aVHow do we use technology to make this day echo into the future,
p489
aVso that we can build community
p490
aVand have these communities working together, through the Internet?
p491
aVThere was a time, many, many years ago,
p492
aVwhen all of the continents were stuck together.
p493
aVAnd we call that landmass Pangea.
p494
aVSo what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day.
p495
aVAnd if you just imagine
p496
aVthat all of these people in these towns would be watching,
p497
aVthen I think that we can actually really make a movement
p498
aVtowards people understanding each other better.
p499
aa(lp500
VI know that it's very intangible, touching people's hearts and souls,
p501
aVbut the only way that I know how to do it,
p502
aVthe only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul
p503
aVall across the world, is by showing them a film.
p504
aVAnd I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there
p505
aVthat can really make this happen.
p506
aVAnd that's my wish.
p507
aVI guess I'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish,
p508
aVbut we're way out of time.
p509
aa(lp510
VChris Anderson: That is an incredible wish.
p511
aVPangea Cinema: The day the world comes together.
p512
aa(lp513
VJN: It's more tangible than world peace, and it's certainly more immediate.
p514
aVBut it would be the day that the world comes together through film,
p515
aVthe power of film.
p516
aa(lp517

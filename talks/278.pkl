VLast year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion,
p5
aVwhich was this very implausible technology
p6
aVthat technically could have worked,
p7
aVbut it had this one-year political window where it could have happened.
p8
aVSo it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen.
p9
aVThis year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.
p10
aVThis was a perfect introduction.
p11
aVAnd it's a story that did work. It did happen,
p12
aVand the machines are all around us.
p13
aVAnd it was a technology that was inevitable.
p14
aVIf the people I'm going to tell you the story about,
p15
aVif they hadn't done it, somebody else would have.
p16
aVSo, it was sort of the right idea at the right time.
p17
aa(lp18
VThis is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now.
p19
aVIt's the universe in which these machines
p20
aVare now doing all these things, including changing biology.
p21
aVI'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity,
p22
aVwhich was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED:
p23
aVit brought a whole lot of very smart people together.
p24
aVAnd three of the smartest people were
p25
aVStan Ulam, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann.
p26
aVAnd it was Von Neumann who said, after the bomb,
p27
aVhe was working on something much more important than bombs:
p28
aVhe's thinking about computers.
p29
aVSo, he wasn't only thinking about them; he built one. This is the machine he built.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VHe built this machine,
p34
aVand we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works,
p35
aVwith these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back.
p36
aVThe first person to really explain that
p37
aVwas Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651,
p38
aVexplained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing,
p39
aVand if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic,
p40
aVyou can do it all with arithmetic.
p41
aVHe said you needed addition and subtraction.
p42
aVLeibniz, who came a little bit later \u2014 this is 1679 \u2014
p43
aVshowed that you didn't even need subtraction.
p44
aVYou could do the whole thing with addition.
p45
aVHere, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic
p46
aVthat drove the computer revolution.
p47
aVAnd Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine.
p48
aVHe talked about doing it with marbles,
p49
aVhaving gates and what we now call shift registers,
p50
aVwhere you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks.
p51
aVAnd that's what all these machines are doing,
p52
aVexcept, instead of doing it with marbles,
p53
aVthey're doing it with electrons.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd then we jump to Von Neumann, 1945,
p56
aVwhen he sort of reinvents the whole same thing.
p57
aVAnd 1945, after the war, the electronics existed
p58
aVto actually try and build such a machine.
p59
aVSo June 1945 \u2014 actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet \u2014
p60
aVand Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing,
p61
aVwhich also goes back to Turing,
p62
aVwho, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this
p63
aVwith a very brainless, little, finite state machine,
p64
aVjust reading a tape in and reading a tape out.
p65
aVThe other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did
p66
aVwas the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.
p67
aVLewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people,
p68
aVgiving them each a little chunk, and putting it together.
p69
aVHere, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will,
p70
aVbut capable of only two ideas.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd that's really the simplest computer.
p75
aVIt's basically why you need the qubit,
p76
aVbecause it only has two ideas.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd you put lots of those together,
p79
aVyou get the essentials of the modern computer:
p80
aVthe arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory,
p81
aVthe recording medium, the input and the output.
p82
aVBut, there's one catch. This is the fatal \u2014 you know,
p83
aVwe saw it in starting these programs up.
p84
aVThe instructions which govern this operation
p85
aVmust be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.
p86
aVSo, the programming has to be perfect, or it won't work.
p87
aa(lp88
VIf you look at the origins of this,
p89
aVthe classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.
p90
aVBut actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about,
p91
aVthe Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there,
p92
aVreally should be down there. So, I'm trying to revise history,
p93
aVand give some of these guys more credit than they've had.
p94
aVSuch a computer would open up universes,
p95
aVwhich are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.
p96
aVSo it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.
p97
aVThe guy who was supposed to build this machine
p98
aVwas the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.
p99
aVRCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions
p100
aVof all time, decided not to go into computers.
p101
aVBut the first meetings, November 1945, were at RCA's offices.
p102
aVRCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know,
p103
aVtelevisions are the future, not computers.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe essentials were all there \u2014
p106
aVall the things that make these machines run.
p107
aVVon Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army
p108
aVput this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.
p109
aVWhen RCA said no, that's when they decided to build it in Princeton,
p110
aVwhere Freeman works at the Institute.
p111
aVThat's where I grew up as a kid.
p112
aVThat's me, that's my sister Esther, who's talked to you before,
p113
aVso we both go back to the birth of this thing.
p114
aVThat's Freeman, a long time ago,
p115
aVand that was me.
p116
aVAnd this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern,
p117
aVwho wrote the "Theory of Games."
p118
aVAll these forces came together there, in Princeton.
p119
aVOppenheimer, who had built the bomb.
p120
aVThe machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations.
p121
aVAnd Julian Bigelow, who took
p122
aVZworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics,
p123
aVhow you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this,
p124
aVand women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.
p125
aVThese were the prototype geeks, the nerds.
p126
aVThey didn't fit in at the Institute.
p127
aVThis is a letter from the director, concerned about \u2014
p128
aV"especially unfair on the matter of sugar."
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VYou can read the text.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VThis is hackers getting in trouble for the first time.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter).
p139
aa(lp140
VThese were not theoretical physicists.
p141
aVThey were real soldering-gun type guys, and they actually built this thing.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd we take it for granted now, that each of these machines
p144
aVhas billions of transistors, doing billions of cycles per second without failing.
p145
aVThey were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques
p146
aVto get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.
p147
aVThey actually used 6J6, the common radio tube,
p148
aVbecause they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes.
p149
aVAnd what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way.
p150
aVReports were issued, so that this machine was cloned
p151
aVat 15 other places around the world.
p152
aVAnd it really was. It was the original microprocessor.
p153
aVAll the computers now are copies of that machine.
p154
aVThe memory was in cathode ray tubes \u2014
p155
aVa whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube \u2014
p156
aVvery, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.
p157
aVSo, there's 40 of these tubes,
p158
aVlike a V-40 engine running the memory.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VThe input and the output was by teletype tape at first.
p163
aVThis is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.
p164
aVThis is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now.
p165
aVThen they switched to a magnetic drum.
p166
aVThis is modifying IBM equipment,
p167
aVwhich is the origins of the whole data-processing industry, later at IBM.
p168
aVAnd this is the beginning of computer graphics.
p169
aVThe "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide,
p170
aVthat's the \u2014 as far as I know \u2014 the first digital bitmap display, 1954.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo, Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud,
p173
aVdoing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build
p174
aVreliable machines out of unreliable components.
p175
aVThose guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it
p176
aVwere writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all
p177
aVthese 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time.
p178
aVAnd that's what I've been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.
p179
aV"Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes."
p180
aVThis includes a large amount of human error.
p181
aVSo they are always trying to figure out, what's machine error? What's human error?
p182
aVWhat's code, what's hardware?
p183
aa(lp184
VThat's an engineer gazing at tube number 36,
p185
aVtrying to figure out why the memory's not in focus.
p186
aVHe had to focus the memory \u2014 seems OK.
p187
aVSo, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running,
p188
aVlet alone having, you know, software problems.
p189
aa(lp190
V"No use, went home." (Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
V"Impossible to follow the damn thing, where's a directory?"
p193
aa(lp194
VSo, already, they're complaining about the manuals:
p195
aV"before closing down in disgust ... "
p196
aa(lp197
V"The General Arithmetic: Operating Logs."
p198
aVBurning lots of midnight oil.
p199
aa(lp200
V"MANIAC," which became the acronym for the machine,
p201
aVMathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, "lost its memory."
p202
aa(lp203
V"MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off." "Machine or human?"
p204
aa(lp205
V"Aha!" So, they figured out it's a code problem.
p206
aa(lp207
V"Found trouble in code, I hope."
p208
aa(lp209
V"Code error, machine not guilty."
p210
aa(lp211
V"Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing."
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
V"And the dawn came." So they ran all night.
p216
aVTwenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations.
p217
aa(lp218
V"Everything up to this point is wasted time." "What's the use? Good night."
p219
aa(lp220
V"Master control off. The hell with it. Way off." (Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
V"Something's wrong with the air conditioner \u2014
p223
aVsmell of burning V-belts in the air."
p224
aa(lp225
V"A short \u2014 do not turn the machine on."
p226
aa(lp227
V"IBM machine putting a tar-like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof."
p228
aVSo they really were working under tough conditions.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VHere, "A mouse has climbed into the blower
p233
aVbehind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse."
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
V"Here lies mouse. Born: ?. Died: 4:50 a.m., May 1953."
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VThere's an inside joke someone has penciled in:
p242
aV"Here lies Marston Mouse."
p243
aVIf you're a mathematician, you get that,
p244
aVbecause Marston was a mathematician who
p245
aVobjected to the computer being there.
p246
aa(lp247
V"Picked a lightning bug off the drum." "Running at two kilocycles."
p248
aVThat's two thousand cycles per second \u2014
p249
aV"yes, I'm chicken" \u2014 so two kilocycles was slow speed.
p250
aVThe high speed was 16 kilocycles.
p251
aVI don't know if you remember a Mac that was 16 Megahertz,
p252
aVthat's slow speed.
p253
aa(lp254
V"I have now duplicated both results.
p255
aVHow will I know which is right, assuming one result is correct?
p256
aVThis now is the third different output.
p257
aVI know when I'm licked."
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
V"We've duplicated errors before."
p262
aa(lp263
V"Machine run, fine. Code isn't."
p264
aa(lp265
V"Only happens when the machine is running."
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd sometimes things are okay.
p268
aV"Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever." "Perfect running."
p269
aa(lp270
V"Parting thought: when there's bigger and better errors, we'll have them."
p271
aa(lp272
VSo, nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs.
p273
aVThey're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook,
p274
aVlate one night, finally drew a bomb.
p275
aVSo, that was the result. It was Mike,
p276
aVthe first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.
p277
aVThat was designed on that machine,
p278
aVin the woods behind the Institute.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos
p281
aVfrom all over the world to work on all these problems.
p282
aVBarricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life,
p283
aVtrying to see if, in this artificial universe \u2014
p284
aVhe was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time.
p285
aVHe's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now.
p286
aVTrying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer.
p287
aVBegan \u2014 his universe started March 3, '53.
p288
aVSo it's almost exactly \u2014 it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.
p289
aVAnd he saw everything in terms of \u2014
p290
aVhe could read the binary code straight off the machine.
p291
aVHe had a wonderful rapport.
p292
aVOther people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.
p293
aVEven errors were duplicated.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
V"Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right."
p298
aa(lp299
VSo he designed this universe, and ran it.
p300
aVWhen the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.
p301
aVHe would run that thing all night long, running these things,
p302
aVif anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram,
p303
aVwho reinvented this stuff.
p304
aVAnd he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared.
p305
aVIt was published in the literature.
p306
aV"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?"
p307
aVSo, he decided to give it a try,
p308
aVto start this artificial biology going in the machines.
p309
aVAnd he found all these, sort of \u2014
p310
aVit was like a naturalist coming in
p311
aVand looking at this tiny, 5,000-byte universe,
p312
aVand seeing all these things happening
p313
aVthat we see in the outside world, in biology.
p314
aVThis is some of the generations of his universe.
p315
aVBut they're just going to stay numbers;
p316
aVthey're not going to become organisms.
p317
aVThey have to have something.
p318
aVYou have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.
p319
aVThey have to go out and do something. And he started doing that,
p320
aVstarted giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with \u2014
p321
aVplaying chess with other machines and so on.
p322
aVAnd they did start to evolve.
p323
aVAnd he went around the country after that.
p324
aVEvery time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it,
p325
aVand saw exactly what's happening now.
p326
aVThat the programs, instead of being turned off \u2014 when you quit the program,
p327
aVyou'd keep running
p328
aVand, basically, all the sorts of things like Windows is doing,
p329
aVrunning as a multi-cellular organism on many machines,
p330
aVhe envisioned all that happening.
p331
aVAnd he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process.
p332
aVIt wasn't any sort of creator intelligence,
p333
aVbut the thing itself was a giant parallel computation
p334
aVthat would have some intelligence.
p335
aVAnd he went out of his way to say
p336
aVthat he was not saying this was lifelike,
p337
aVor a new kind of life.
p338
aVIt just was another version of the same thing happening.
p339
aVAnd there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer
p340
aVand what nature did billions of years ago.
p341
aVAnd could you do it again now?
p342
aa(lp343
VSo, when I went into these archives looking at this stuff, lo and behold,
p344
aVthe archivist came up one day, saying,
p345
aV"I think we found another box that had been thrown out."
p346
aVAnd it was his universe on punch cards.
p347
aVSo there it is, 50 years later, sitting there \u2014 sort of suspended animation.
p348
aVThat's the instructions for running \u2014
p349
aVthis is actually the source code
p350
aVfor one of those universes,
p351
aVwith a note from the engineers
p352
aVsaying they're having some problems.
p353
aV"There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet."
p354
aVAnd I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand
p355
aVhow these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity.
p356
aVWhat's the dividing line between
p357
aVwhen that is lifelike and when it really is alive?
p358
aVThese cards, now, thanks to me showing up, are being saved.
p359
aVAnd the question is, should we run them or not?
p360
aVYou know, could we get them running?
p361
aVDo you want to let it loose on the Internet?
p362
aVThese machines would think they \u2014
p363
aVthese organisms, if they came back to life now \u2014
p364
aVwhether they've died and gone to heaven, there's a universe.
p365
aVMy laptop is 10 thousand million times
p366
aVthe size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project.
p367
aa(lp368
VHe was thinking far ahead, to
p369
aVhow this would really grow into a new kind of life.
p370
aVAnd that's what's happening!
p371
aVWhen Juan Enriquez told us about
p372
aVthese 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth,
p373
aVof all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab,
p374
aVthat's what Barricelli imagined:
p375
aVthat this digital code in these machines
p376
aVis actually starting to code \u2014
p377
aVit already is coding from nucleic acids.
p378
aVWe've been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR
p379
aVand synthesizing small strings of DNA.
p380
aVAnd real soon, we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins,
p381
aVand, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world.
p382
aa(lp383
VIt's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.
p384
aVThis was published after he died: his sort of unfinished notes
p385
aVon self-reproducing machines,
p386
aVwhat it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started
p387
aVto where they begin to reproduce.
p388
aVIt took really three people:
p389
aVBarricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing;
p390
aVVon Neumann saw how you could build the machines \u2014
p391
aVthat now, last count, four million
p392
aVof these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours;
p393
aVand Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago \u2014
p394
aVthis is John Markoff's obituary for him \u2014
p395
aVhe was the important missing link,
p396
aVthe engineer who came in
p397
aVand knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.
p398
aVAnd all our computers have, inside them,
p399
aVthe copies of the architecture that he had to just design
p400
aVone day, sort of on pencil and paper.
p401
aVAnd we owe a tremendous credit to that.
p402
aVAnd he explained, in a very generous way,
p403
aVthe spirit that brought all these different people to
p404
aVthe Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project,
p405
aVand make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions,
p406
aVno intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.
p407
aa(lp408
VThat's the last entry in the logbook
p409
aVwhen the machine was shut down, July 1958.
p410
aVAnd it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight
p411
aVwhen the machine was officially turned off.
p412
aVAnd that's the end.
p413
aa(lp414
VThank you very much.

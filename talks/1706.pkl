VI want to talk a little bit today about labor and work.
p5
aa(lp6
VWhen we think about how people work,
p7
aVthe naive intuition we have
p8
aVis that people are like rats in a maze \u2014
p9
aVthat all people care about is money,
p10
aVand the moment we give them money,
p11
aVwe can direct them to work one way,
p12
aVwe can direct them to work another way.
p13
aVThis is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways.
p14
aVAnd we really have this incredibly simplistic view
p15
aVof why people work, and what the labor market looks like.
p16
aa(lp17
VAt the same time, if you think about it,
p18
aVthere's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us.
p19
aVThink about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing.
p20
aVIf you read books of people who climb mountains, difficult mountains,
p21
aVdo you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness?
p22
aVNo, they are full of misery.
p23
aVIn fact, it's all about frostbite and having difficulty walking,
p24
aVand difficulty breathing \u2014
p25
aVcold, challenging circumstances.
p26
aVAnd if people were just trying to be happy,
p27
aVthe moment they would get to the top,
p28
aVthey would say, "This was a terrible mistake.
p29
aVI'll never do it again."
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
V"Instead, let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos."
p34
aVBut instead, people go down,
p35
aVand after they recover, they go up again.
p36
aVAnd if you think about mountain climbing as an example,
p37
aVit suggests all kinds of things.
p38
aVIt suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.
p39
aVIt suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge.
p40
aVIt suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us
p41
aVto work or behave in all kinds of ways.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd for me personally, I started thinking about this
p44
aVafter a student came to visit me.
p45
aVThis was one of my students from a few years earlier,
p46
aVand he came one day back to campus.
p47
aVAnd he told me the following story:
p48
aVHe said that for more than two weeks,
p49
aVhe was working on a PowerPoint presentation.
p50
aVHe was working in a big bank,
p51
aVand this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition.
p52
aVAnd he was working very hard on this presentation \u2014
p53
aVgraphs, tables, information.
p54
aVHe stayed late at night every day.
p55
aVAnd the day before it was due,
p56
aVhe sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss,
p57
aVand his boss wrote him back and said,
p58
aV"Nice presentation, but the merger is canceled."
p59
aVAnd the guy was deeply depressed.
p60
aVNow at the moment when he was working,
p61
aVhe was actually quite happy.
p62
aVEvery night he was enjoying his work,
p63
aVhe was staying late, he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation.
p64
aVBut knowing that nobody would ever watch it made him quite depressed.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I started thinking about how do we experiment
p67
aVwith this idea of the fruits of our labor.
p68
aVAnd to start with, we created a little experiment
p69
aVin which we gave people Legos,
p70
aVand we asked them to build with Legos.
p71
aVAnd for some people, we gave them Legos and we said,
p72
aV"Hey, would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars?
p73
aVWe'll pay you three dollars for it."
p74
aVAnd people said yes, and they built with these Legos.
p75
aVAnd when they finished, we took it, we put it under the table,
p76
aVand we said, "Would you like to build another one,
p77
aVthis time for $2.70?"
p78
aVIf they said yes, we gave them another one,
p79
aVand when they finished, we asked them,
p80
aV"Do you want to build another one?" for $2.40, $2.10, and so on,
p81
aVuntil at some point people said,
p82
aV"No more. It's not worth it for me."
p83
aVThis was what we called the meaningful condition.
p84
aVPeople built one Bionicle after another.
p85
aVAfter they finished every one of them,
p86
aVwe put them under the table.
p87
aVAnd we told them that at the end of the experiment,
p88
aVwe will take all these Bionicles, we will disassemble them,
p89
aVwe will put them back in the boxes,
p90
aVand we will use it for the next participant.
p91
aa(lp92
VThere was another condition.
p93
aVThis other condition was inspired by David, my student.
p94
aVAnd this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition.
p95
aVAnd if you remember the story about Sisyphus,
p96
aVSisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill,
p97
aVand when he almost got to the end,
p98
aVthe rock would roll over, and he would have to start again.
p99
aVAnd you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work.
p100
aVYou can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills,
p101
aVat least he would have some sense of progress.
p102
aVAlso, if you look at prison movies,
p103
aVsometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners
p104
aVis to get them to dig a hole, and when the prisoner is finished,
p105
aVthey ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again.
p106
aVThere's something about this cyclical version
p107
aVof doing something over and over and over
p108
aVthat seems to be particularly demotivating.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo in the second condition of this experiment,
p111
aVthat's exactly what we did.
p112
aVWe asked people,
p113
aV"Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars?"
p114
aVAnd if they said yes, they built it.
p115
aVThen we asked them, "Do you want to build another one for $2.70?"
p116
aVAnd if they said yes, we gave them a new one,
p117
aVand as they were building it,
p118
aVwe took apart the one that they just finished.
p119
aVAnd when they finished that,
p120
aVwe said, "Would you like to build another one,
p121
aVthis time for 30 cents less?"
p122
aVAnd if they said yes,
p123
aVwe gave them the one that they built and we broke.
p124
aVSo this was an endless cycle of them building,
p125
aVand us destroying in front of their eyes.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow what happens when you compare these two conditions?
p128
aVThe first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles \u2014
p129
aVeleven in the meaningful condition,
p130
aVversus seven in the Sisyphus condition.
p131
aVAnd by the way, we should point out that this was not big meaning.
p132
aVPeople were not curing cancer or building bridges.
p133
aVPeople were building Bionicles for a few cents.
p134
aVAnd not only that, everybody knew
p135
aVthat the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon.
p136
aVSo there was not a real opportunity for big meaning.
p137
aVBut even the small meaning made a difference.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow we had another version of this experiment.
p140
aVIn this other version of the experiment,
p141
aVwe didn't put people in this situation,
p142
aVwe just described to them the situation,
p143
aVmuch as I am describing to you now,
p144
aVand we asked them to predict what the result would be.
p145
aVWhat happened?
p146
aVPeople predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude.
p147
aVPeople who were just given the description of the experiment
p148
aVsaid that in the meaningful condition,
p149
aVpeople would probably build one more Bionicle.
p150
aVSo people understand that meaning is important,
p151
aVthey just don't understand the magnitude of the importance,
p152
aVthe extent to which it's important.
p153
aa(lp154
VThere was one other piece of data we looked at.
p155
aVIf you think about it, there are some people who love Legos,
p156
aVand some people who don't.
p157
aVAnd you would speculate that the people who love Legos
p158
aVwould build more Legos, even for less money,
p159
aVbecause after all, they get more internal joy from it.
p160
aVAnd the people who love Legos less would build less Legos
p161
aVbecause the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower.
p162
aVAnd that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition.
p163
aVThere was a very nice correlation between the love of Legos
p164
aVand the amount of Legos people built.
p165
aa(lp166
VWhat happened in the Sisyphic condition?
p167
aVIn that condition, the correlation was zero \u2014
p168
aVthere was no relationship between the love of Legos,
p169
aVand how much people built,
p170
aVwhich suggests to me that with this manipulation
p171
aVof breaking things in front of people's eyes,
p172
aVwe basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity.
p173
aVWe basically eliminated it.
p174
aa(lp175
VSoon after I finished running this experiment,
p176
aVI went to talk to a big software company in Seattle.
p177
aVI can't tell you who they were, but they were a big company in Seattle.
p178
aVThis was a group within the software company
p179
aVthat was put in a different building,
p180
aVand they asked them to innovate,
p181
aVand create the next big product for this company.
p182
aVAnd the week before I showed up,
p183
aVthe CEO of this big software company went to that group, 200 engineers,
p184
aVand canceled the project.
p185
aVAnd I stood there in front of 200
p186
aVof the most depressed people I've ever talked to.
p187
aVAnd I described to them some of these Lego experiments,
p188
aVand they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment.
p189
aVAnd I asked them, I said,
p190
aV"How many of you now show up to work later than you used to?"
p191
aVAnd everybody raised their hand.
p192
aVI said, "How many of you now go home earlier than you used to?"
p193
aVEverybody raised their hand.
p194
aVI asked them, "How many of you now add
p195
aVnot-so-kosher things to your expense reports?"
p196
aVAnd they didn't raise their hands,
p197
aVbut they took me out to dinner
p198
aVand showed me what they could do with expense reports.
p199
aVAnd then I asked them, I said,
p200
aV"What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed?"
p201
aVAnd they came up with all kinds of ideas.
p202
aa(lp203
VThey said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company
p204
aVabout their journey over the last two years
p205
aVand what they decided to do.
p206
aVHe could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology
p207
aVcould fit with other parts of the organization.
p208
aVHe could have asked them to build some next-generation prototypes,
p209
aVand see how they would work.
p210
aVBut the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation.
p211
aVAnd I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning.
p212
aVIf the CEO, just like our participants,
p213
aVthought the essence of meaning is unimportant,
p214
aVthen he [wouldn't] care.
p215
aVAnd he would say, "At the moment I directed you in this way,
p216
aVand now that I'm directing you in this way,
p217
aVeverything will be okay."
p218
aVBut if you understood how important meaning is,
p219
aVthen you would figure out that it's actually important
p220
aVto spend some time, energy and effort
p221
aVin getting people to care more about what they're doing.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe next experiment was slightly different.
p224
aVWe took a sheet of paper with random letters,
p225
aVand we asked people to find pairs of letters
p226
aVthat were identical next to each other.
p227
aVThat was the task.
p228
aVPeople did the first sheet,
p229
aVthen we asked if they wanted to do another for a little less money,
p230
aVthe next sheet for a little bit less, and so on and so forth.
p231
aVAnd we had three conditions.
p232
aVIn the first condition, people wrote their name on the sheet,
p233
aVfound all the pairs of letters,
p234
aVgave it to the experimenter,
p235
aVthe experimenter would look at it,
p236
aVscan it from top to bottom,
p237
aVsay "Uh huh," and put it on the pile next to them.
p238
aVIn the second condition, people did not write their name on it.
p239
aVThe experimenter looked at it,
p240
aVtook the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it,
p241
aVand simply put it on the pile of pages.
p242
aVSo you take a piece, you just put it on the side.
p243
aVIn the third condition,
p244
aVthe experimenter got the sheet of paper,
p245
aVand put it directly into a shredder.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VWhat happened in those three conditions?
p250
aa(lp251
VIn this plot I'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped.
p252
aVSo low numbers mean that people worked harder.
p253
aVThey worked for much longer.
p254
aVIn the acknowledged condition,
p255
aVpeople worked all the way down to 15 cents.
p256
aVAt 15 cents per page,
p257
aVthey basically stopped these efforts.
p258
aVIn the shredder condition, it was twice as much \u2014 30 cents per sheet.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd this is basically the result we had before.
p261
aVYou shred people's efforts, output \u2014
p262
aVyou get them not to be as happy with what they're doing.
p263
aVBut I should point out, by the way,
p264
aVthat in the shredder condition, people could have cheated.
p265
aVThey could have done not so good work,
p266
aVbecause they realized people were just shredding it.
p267
aVSo maybe the first sheet you'd do good work,
p268
aVbut then you see nobody is really testing it,
p269
aVso you would do more and more and more.
p270
aVSo in fact, in the shredder condition,
p271
aVpeople could have submitted more work and gotten more money,
p272
aVand put less effort into it.
p273
aVBut what about the ignored condition?
p274
aVWould the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged
p275
aVor more like the shredder, or somewhere in the middle?
p276
aVIt turns out it was almost like the shredder.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow there's good news and bad news here.
p279
aVThe bad news is that ignoring the performance of people
p280
aVis almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes.
p281
aVIgnoring gets you a whole way out there.
p282
aVThe good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done,
p283
aVscanning it and saying "Uh huh,"
p284
aVthat seems to be quite sufficient
p285
aVto dramatically improve people's motivations.
p286
aVSo the good news is that adding motivation
p287
aVdoesn't seem to be so difficult.
p288
aVThe bad news is that eliminating motivations
p289
aVseems to be incredibly easy,
p290
aVand if we don't think about it carefully, we might overdo it.
p291
aVSo this is all in terms of negative motivation,
p292
aVor eliminating negative motivation.
p293
aa(lp294
VThe next part I want to show you is something about positive motivation.
p295
aVSo there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA.
p296
aVAnd IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture
p297
aVthat takes a long time to assemble.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VI don't know about you,
p302
aVbut every time I assemble one of those,
p303
aVit takes me much longer, it's much more effortful,
p304
aVit's much more confusing, I put things in the wrong way \u2014
p305
aVI can't say I enjoy those pieces.
p306
aVI can't say I enjoy the process.
p307
aVBut when I finish it,
p308
aVI seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture
p309
aVmore than I like other ones.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd there's an old story about cake mixes.
p314
aVSo when they started cake mixes in the '40s,
p315
aVthey would take this powder and they would put it in a box,
p316
aVand they would ask housewives to basically pour it in,
p317
aVstir some water in it,
p318
aVmix it, put it in the oven, and \u2014 voila \u2014 you had cake.
p319
aVBut it turns out they were very unpopular.
p320
aVPeople did not want them,
p321
aVand they thought about all kinds of reasons for that.
p322
aVMaybe the taste was not good?
p323
aVNo, the taste was great.
p324
aVWhat they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved.
p325
aVIt was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests
p326
aVand say, "Here is my cake."
p327
aVNo, it was somebody else's cake, as if you bought it in the store.
p328
aVIt didn't really feel like your own.
p329
aVSo what did they do?
p330
aVThey took the eggs and the milk out of the powder.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VNow you had to break the eggs and add them,
p335
aVyou had to measure the milk and add it, mixing it.
p336
aVNow it was your cake. Now everything was fine.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
V(Applause)
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, I think a little bit like the IKEA effect,
p343
aVby getting people to work harder,
p344
aVthey actually got them to love what they're doing
p345
aVto a higher degree.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo how do we look at this question experimentally?
p348
aVWe asked people to build some origami.
p349
aVWe gave them instructions on how to create origami,
p350
aVand we gave them a sheet of paper.
p351
aVAnd these were all novices,
p352
aVand they built something that was really quite ugly \u2014
p353
aVnothing like a frog or a crane.
p354
aVBut then we told them, "Look, this origami really belongs to us.
p355
aVYou worked for us, but I'll tell you what, we'll sell it to you.
p356
aVHow much do you want to pay for it?"
p357
aVAnd we measured how much they were willing to pay for it.
p358
aVAnd we had two types of people:
p359
aVWe had the people who built it,
p360
aVand the people who did not build it,
p361
aVand just looked at it as external observers.
p362
aVAnd what we found was that the builders thought
p363
aVthat these were beautiful pieces of origami \u2014
p364
aa(lp365
V(Laughter)
p366
aa(lp367
Vand they were willing to pay five times more for them
p368
aVthan the people who just evaluated them externally.
p369
aVNow you could say \u2014 if you were a builder,
p370
aVdo you think [you'd say], "Oh, I love this origami,
p371
aVbut I know that nobody else would love it?"
p372
aVOr "I love this origami, and everybody else will love it as well?"
p373
aVWhich one of those two is correct?
p374
aVTurns out the builders not only loved the origami more,
p375
aVthey thought that everybody would see the world in their view.
p376
aVThey thought everybody else would love it more as well.
p377
aa(lp378
VIn the next version, we tried to do the IKEA effect.
p379
aVWe tried to make it more difficult.
p380
aVSo for some people, we gave the same task.
p381
aVFor some people, we made it harder by hiding the instructions.
p382
aVAt the top of the sheet, we had little diagrams
p383
aVof how you fold origami.
p384
aVFor some people, we just eliminated that.
p385
aVSo now this was tougher.
p386
aVWhat happened?
p387
aVWell in an objective way,
p388
aVthe origami now was uglier, it was more difficult.
p389
aVNow when we looked at the easy origami, we saw the same thing \u2014
p390
aVbuilders loved it more, evaluators loved it less.
p391
aVWhen you looked at the hard instructions,
p392
aVthe effect was larger.
p393
aVWhy?
p394
aVBecause now the builders loved it even more.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Laughter)
p397
aa(lp398
VThey put all this extra effort into it.
p399
aVAnd evaluators?
p400
aVThey loved it even less.
p401
aVBecause in reality, it was even uglier than the first version.
p402
aa(lp403
V(Laughter)
p404
aa(lp405
VOf course, this tells you something about how we evaluate things.
p406
aa(lp407
VNow think about kids.
p408
aVImagine I asked you, "How much would you sell your kids for?"
p409
aVYour memories and associations and so on.
p410
aVMost people would say for a lot, a lot of money.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Laughter)
p413
aa(lp414
VOn good days.
p415
aa(lp416
V(Laughter)
p417
aa(lp418
VBut imagine this was slightly different.
p419
aVImagine if you did not have your kids.
p420
aVAnd one day you went to the park and you met some kids.
p421
aVThey were just like your kids,
p422
aVand you played with them for a few hours,
p423
aVand when you were about to leave, the parents said, "Hey, by the way,
p424
aVjust before you leave, if you're interested, they're for sale."
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VHow much would you pay for them now?
p429
aVMost people say not that much.
p430
aVAnd this is because our kids are so valuable,
p431
aVnot just because of who they are,
p432
aVbut because of us,
p433
aVbecause they are so connected to us,
p434
aVand because of the time and connection.
p435
aVBy the way, if you think IKEA instructions are not good,
p436
aVwhat about the instructions that come with kids, those are really tough.
p437
aa(lp438
V(Laughter)
p439
aa(lp440
VBy the way, these are my kids, which, of course, are wonderful and so on.
p441
aVWhich comes to tell you one more thing,
p442
aVwhich is, much like our builders,
p443
aVwhen they look at the creature of their creation,
p444
aVwe don't see that other people don't see things our way.
p445
aa(lp446
VLet me say one last comment.
p447
aVIf you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx,
p448
aVAdam Smith had a very important notion of efficiency.
p449
aVHe gave an example of a pin factory.
p450
aVHe said pins have 12 different steps,
p451
aVand if one person does all 12 steps, production is very low.
p452
aVBut if you get one person to do step one,
p453
aVand one person to do step two and step three and so on,
p454
aVproduction can increase tremendously.
p455
aVAnd indeed, this is a great example,
p456
aVand the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency.
p457
aVKarl Marx, on the other hand,
p458
aVsaid that the alienation of labor is incredibly important
p459
aVin how people think about the connection to what they are doing.
p460
aVAnd if you do all 12 steps, you care about the pin.
p461
aVBut if you do one step every time, maybe you don't care as much.
p462
aa(lp463
VI think that in the Industrial Revolution,
p464
aVAdam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx.
p465
aVBut the reality is that we've switched,
p466
aVand now we're in the knowledge economy.
p467
aVYou can ask yourself, what happens in a knowledge economy?
p468
aVIs efficiency still more important than meaning?
p469
aVI think the answer is no.
p470
aVI think that as we move to situations
p471
aVin which people have to decide on their own
p472
aVabout how much effort, attention, caring, how connected they feel to it,
p473
aVare they thinking about labor on the way to work,
p474
aVand in the shower and so on,
p475
aVall of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us.
p476
aVSo when we think about labor,
p477
aVwe usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing,
p478
aVbut the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it \u2014
p479
aVmeaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc.
p480
aa(lp481
VThe good news is that if we added all of those components
p482
aVand thought about them \u2014
p483
aVhow do we create our own meaning, pride, motivation,
p484
aVand how do we do it in our workplace,
p485
aVand for the employees \u2014
p486
aVI think we could get people to be both more productive and happier.
p487
aa(lp488
VThank you very much.

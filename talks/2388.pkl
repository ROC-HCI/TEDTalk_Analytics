VIn the past few months, I've been traveling for weeks at a time
p5
aVwith only one suitcase of clothes.
p6
aVOne day, I was invited to an important event,
p7
aVand I wanted to wear something special and new for it.
p8
aVSo I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear.
p9
aVI was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day,
p10
aVand I had access to 3D printers.
p11
aVSo I quickly designed a skirt on my computer,
p12
aVand I loaded the file on the printer.
p13
aVIt just printed the pieces overnight.
p14
aVThe next morning, I just took all the pieces,
p15
aVassembled them together in my hotel room,
p16
aVand this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Applause)
p19
aa(lp20
VSo it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes.
p21
aVFor my senior collection at fashion design school,
p22
aVI decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home.
p23
aVThe problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing,
p24
aVand I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks.
p25
aa(lp26
VI always felt most creative when I worked from home.
p27
aVI loved experimenting with new materials,
p28
aVand I always tried to develop new techniques
p29
aVto make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects.
p30
aVI loved going to old factories and weird stores
p31
aVin search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials,
p32
aVand then bring them home to experiment on.
p33
aVAs you can probably imagine,
p34
aVmy roommates didn't like that at all.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo I decided to move on to working with big machines,
p39
aVones that didn't fit in my living room.
p40
aVI love the exact and the custom work I can do
p41
aVwith all kinds of fashion technologies,
p42
aVlike knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing.
p43
aa(lp44
VOne summer break, I came here to New York for an internship
p45
aVat a fashion house in Chinatown.
p46
aVWe worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed.
p47
aVThey were amazing \u2014 like you can see here.
p48
aVBut I had a few issues with them.
p49
aVThey were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable.
p50
aVThe models couldn't sit in them,
p51
aVand they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms.
p52
aa(lp53
VWith 3D printing, the designers had so much freedom
p54
aVto make the dresses look exactly like they wanted,
p55
aVbut still, they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers
p56
aVthat were located in a lab far from their studio.
p57
aa(lp58
VLater that year, a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace,
p59
aVprinted using a home printer.
p60
aVI knew that these printers were much cheaper
p61
aVand much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship.
p62
aVSo I looked at the necklace,
p63
aVand then I thought, "If I can print a necklace from home,
p64
aVwhy not print my clothes from home, too?"
p65
aVI really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market
p66
aVand pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell \u2014
p67
aVI could just design them and print them directly from home.
p68
aa(lp69
VI found a small makerspace,
p70
aVwhere I learned everything I know about 3D printing.
p71
aVRight away, they literally gave me the key to the lab,
p72
aVso I could experiment into the night, every night.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with.
p75
aVSo what is a filament?
p76
aVFilament is the material you feed the printer with.
p77
aVAnd I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA,
p78
aVwhich is a hard and scratchy, breakable material.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex,
p81
aVwhich is a new kind of filament.
p82
aVIt's strong, yet very flexible.
p83
aVAnd with it, I was able to print the first garment,
p84
aVthe red jacket that had the word "Liberté" \u2014
p85
aV"freedom" in French \u2014
p86
aVembedded into it.
p87
aVI chose this word because I felt so empowered and free
p88
aVwhen I could just design a garment from my home
p89
aVand then print it by myself.
p90
aVAnd actually, you can easily download this jacket,
p91
aVand easily change the word to something else.
p92
aVFor example, your name or your sweetheart's name.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VSo the printer plates are small,
p97
aVso I had to piece the garment together, just like a puzzle.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd I wanted to solve another challenge.
p100
aVI wanted to print textiles
p101
aVthat I would use just like regular fabrics.
p102
aVThat's when I found an open-source file
p103
aVfrom an architect who designed a pattern that I love.
p104
aVAnd with it, I was able to print a beautiful textile
p105
aVthat I would use just like a regular fabric.
p106
aVAnd it actually even looks a little bit like lace.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo I took his file and I modified it, and changed it, played with it \u2014
p109
aVmany kinds of versions out of it.
p110
aVAnd I needed to print another 1,500 more hours
p111
aVto complete printing my collection.
p112
aVSo I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7.
p113
aVAnd this is actually a really slow process,
p114
aVbut let's remember the Internet was significantly slower 20 years ago,
p115
aVso 3D printing will also accelerate
p116
aVand in no time you'll be able to print a T-Shirt in your home
p117
aVin just a couple of hours, or even minutes.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo you guys, you want to see what it looks like?
p120
aa(lp121
VAudience: Yeah!
p122
aa(lp123
V(Applause)
p124
aa(lp125
VDanit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits.
p126
aVAlmost everything here she's wearing, I printed from my home.
p127
aVEven her shoes are printed.
p128
aa(lp129
VAudience: Wow!
p130
aa(lp131
VAudience: Cool!
p132
aa(lp133
V(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VDanit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.
p136
aV(To audience) Thank you, guys.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo I think in the future, materials will evolve,
p139
aVand they will look and feel like fabrics we know today,
p140
aVlike cotton or silk.
p141
aVImagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements.
p142
aa(lp143
VMusic was once a very physical thing.
p144
aVYou would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs,
p145
aVbut now you can just download the music \u2014
p146
aVdigital music \u2014
p147
aVdirectly to your phone.
p148
aVFashion is also a very physical thing.
p149
aVAnd I wonder what our world will look like
p150
aVwhen our clothes will be digital, just like this skirt is.
p151
aa(lp152
VThank you so much.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Applause)
p155
aa(lp156
V[Thank You]

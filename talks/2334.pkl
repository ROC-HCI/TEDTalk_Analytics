VSo I've had the great privilege
p5
aVof traveling to some incredible places,
p6
aVphotographing these distant landscapes and remote cultures
p7
aVall over the world.
p8
aVI love my job.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut people think it's this string of epiphanies
p11
aVand sunrises and rainbows,
p12
aVwhen in reality, it looks more something like this.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VThis is my office.
p17
aa(lp18
VWe can't afford the fanciest places to stay at night,
p19
aVso we tend to sleep a lot outdoors.
p20
aVAs long as we can stay dry,
p21
aVthat's a bonus.
p22
aVWe also can't afford the fanciest restaurants.
p23
aVSo we tend to eat whatever's on the local menu.
p24
aVAnd if you're in the Ecuadorian Páramo,
p25
aVyou're going to eat a large rodent called a cuy.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VBut what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different
p30
aVand a little more unique than that of the average person
p31
aVis that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind
p32
aVthat even in our darkest moments, and those times of despair,
p33
aVwe think, "Hey, there might be an image to be made here,
p34
aVthere might be a story to be told."
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd why is storytelling important?
p37
aVWell, it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage.
p38
aVAnd in the Southeast,
p39
aVthere's an alarming disconnect between the public
p40
aVand the natural areas that allow us to be here in the first place.
p41
aVWe're visual creatures,
p42
aVso we use what we see to teach us what we know.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow the majority of us aren't going to willingly go
p45
aVway down to a swamp.
p46
aVSo how can we still expect those same people to then advocate
p47
aVon behalf of their protection?
p48
aVWe can't.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo my job, then, is to use photography as a communication tool,
p51
aVto help bridge the gap between the science and the aesthetics,
p52
aVto get people talking,
p53
aVto get them thinking,
p54
aVand to hopefully, ultimately,
p55
aVget them caring.
p56
aa(lp57
VI started doing this 15 years ago right here in Gainesville,
p58
aVright here in my backyard.
p59
aVAnd I fell in love with adventure and discovery,
p60
aVgoing to explore all these different places
p61
aVthat were just minutes from my front doorstep.
p62
aVThere are a lot of beautiful places to find.
p63
aVDespite all these years that have passed,
p64
aVI still see the world through the eyes of a child
p65
aVand I try to incorporate that sense of wonderment
p66
aVand that sense of curiosity into my photography
p67
aVas often as I can.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd we're pretty lucky because here in the South,
p70
aVwe're still blessed with a relatively blank canvas
p71
aVthat we can fill with the most fanciful adventures
p72
aVand incredible experiences.
p73
aVIt's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us.
p74
aVSee, a lot of people look at this and they say,
p75
aV"Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree."
p76
aVBut I don't just see a tree \u2014
p77
aVI look at this and I see opportunity.
p78
aVI see an entire weekend.
p79
aVBecause when I was a kid, these were the types of images
p80
aVthat got me off the sofa and dared me to explore,
p81
aVdared me to go find the woods
p82
aVand put my head underwater and see what we have.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd folks, I've been photographing all over the world
p85
aVand I promise you,
p86
aVwhat we have here in the South,
p87
aVwhat we have in the Sunshine State,
p88
aVrivals anything else that I've seen.
p89
aVBut yet our tourism industry is busy promoting all the wrong things.
p90
aVBefore most kids are 12, they'll have been to Disney World
p91
aVmore times than they've been in a canoe
p92
aVor camping under a starry sky.
p93
aVAnd I have nothing against Disney or Mickey; I used to go there, too.
p94
aVBut they're missing out on those fundamental connections
p95
aVthat create a real sense of pride and ownership
p96
aVfor the place that they call home.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd this is compounded by the issue that the landscapes
p99
aVthat define our natural heritage
p100
aVand fuel our aquifer for our drinking water
p101
aVhave been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky.
p102
aVWhen our ancestors first came here,
p103
aVthey warned, "Stay out of these areas, they're haunted.
p104
aVThey're full of evil spirits and ghosts."
p105
aVI don't know where they came up with that idea.
p106
aVBut it's actually led to a very real disconnect,
p107
aVa very real negative mentality
p108
aVthat has kept the public disinterested, silent,
p109
aVand ultimately, our environment at risk.
p110
aVWe're a state that's surrounded and defined by water,
p111
aVand yet for centuries,
p112
aVswamps and wetlands have been regarded
p113
aVas these obstacles to overcome.
p114
aVAnd so we've treated them as these second-class ecosystems,
p115
aVbecause they have very little monetary value
p116
aVand of course, they're known to harbor alligators and snakes \u2014
p117
aVwhich, I'll admit, these aren't the most cuddly of ambassadors.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VSo it became assumed, then, that the only good swamp
p122
aVwas a drained swamp.
p123
aVAnd in fact,
p124
aVdraining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development
p125
aVwas considered the very essence of conservation not too long ago.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut now we're backpedaling,
p128
aVbecause the more we come to learn about these sodden landscapes,
p129
aVthe more secrets we're starting to unlock
p130
aVabout interspecies relationships
p131
aVand the connectivity of habitats, watersheds and flyways.
p132
aVTake this bird, for example:
p133
aVthis is the prothonotary warbler.
p134
aVI love this bird because it's a swamp bird,
p135
aVthrough and through, a swamp bird.
p136
aVThey nest and they mate and they breed in these old-growth swamps
p137
aVin these flooded forests.
p138
aVAnd so after the spring, after they raise their young,
p139
aVthey then fly thousand of miles over the Gulf of Mexico
p140
aVinto Central and South America.
p141
aVAnd then after the winter,
p142
aVthe spring rolls around and they come back.
p143
aVThey fly thousands of miles over the Gulf of Mexico.
p144
aVAnd where do they go? Where do they land?
p145
aVRight back in the same tree.
p146
aVThat's nuts.
p147
aVThis is a bird the size of a tennis ball \u2014
p148
aVI mean, that's crazy!
p149
aVI used a GPS to get here today,
p150
aVand this is my hometown.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VIt's crazy.
p155
aVSo what happens, then, when this bird flies over the Gulf of Mexico
p156
aVinto Central America for the winter
p157
aVand then the spring rolls around and it flies back,
p158
aVand it comes back to this:
p159
aVa freshly sodded golf course?
p160
aa(lp161
VThis is a narrative that's all too commonly unraveling
p162
aVhere in this state.
p163
aVAnd this is a natural process that's occurred for thousands of years
p164
aVand we're just now learning about it.
p165
aVSo you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes
p166
aVif we just preserve them first.
p167
aVNow despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps,
p168
aVthey still have a bad name.
p169
aa(lp170
VMany people feel uncomfortable with the idea of wading
p171
aVinto Florida's blackwater.
p172
aVI can understand that.
p173
aVBut what I loved about growing up in the Sunshine State
p174
aVis that for so many of us,
p175
aVwe live with this latent but very palpable fear
p176
aVthat when we put our toes into the water,
p177
aVthere might be something much more ancient
p178
aVand much more adapted than we are.
p179
aVKnowing that you're not top dog is a welcomed discomfort, I think.
p180
aVHow often in this modern and urban and digital age
p181
aVdo you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable,
p182
aVor consider that the world may not have been made for just us?
p183
aa(lp184
VSo for the last decade,
p185
aVI began seeking out these areas where the concrete yields to forest
p186
aVand the pines turn to cypress,
p187
aVand I viewed all these mosquitoes and reptiles,
p188
aVall these discomforts,
p189
aVas affirmations that I'd found true wilderness,
p190
aVand I embrace them wholly.
p191
aVNow as a conservation photographer obsessed with blackwater,
p192
aVit's only fitting that I'd eventually end up
p193
aVin the most famous swamp of all:
p194
aVthe Everglades.
p195
aa(lp196
VGrowing up here in North Central Florida,
p197
aVit always had these enchanted names,
p198
aVplaces like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,
p199
aVCorkscrew, Big Cypress.
p200
aVI started what turned into a five-year project
p201
aVto hopefully reintroduce the Everglades in a new light,
p202
aVin a more inspired light.
p203
aVBut I knew this would be a tall order, because here you have an area
p204
aVthat's roughly a third the size the state of Florida, it's huge.
p205
aVAnd when I say Everglades,
p206
aVmost people are like, "Oh, yeah, the national park."
p207
aVBut the Everglades is not just a park; it's an entire watershed,
p208
aVstarting with the Kissimmee chain of lakes in the north,
p209
aVand then as the rains would fall in the summer,
p210
aVthese downpours would flow into Lake Okeechobee,
p211
aVand Lake Okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks
p212
aVand spill southward, ever slowly, with the topography,
p213
aVand get into the river of grass, the Sawgrass Prairies,
p214
aVbefore meting into the cypress slews,
p215
aVuntil going further south into the mangrove swamps,
p216
aVand then finally \u2014 finally \u2014 reaching Florida Bay,
p217
aVthe emerald gem of the Everglades,
p218
aVthe great estuary,
p219
aVthe 850 square-mile estuary.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo sure, the national park is the southern end of this system,
p222
aVbut all the things that make it unique are these inputs that come in,
p223
aVthe fresh water that starts 100 miles north.
p224
aVSo no manner of these political or invisible boundaries
p225
aVprotect the park from polluted water or insufficient water.
p226
aVAnd unfortunately, that's precisely what we've done.
p227
aVOver the last 60 years,
p228
aVwe have drained, we have dammed, we have dredged the Everglades
p229
aVto where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay
p230
aVnow reaches the bay today.
p231
aVSo this story is not all sunshine and rainbows, unfortunately.
p232
aVFor better or for worse,
p233
aVthe story of the Everglades is intrinsically tied
p234
aVto the peaks and the valleys of mankind's relationship
p235
aVwith the natural world.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut I'll show you these beautiful pictures,
p238
aVbecause it gets you on board.
p239
aVAnd while I have your attention, I can tell you the real story.
p240
aVIt's that we're taking this,
p241
aVand we're trading it for this,
p242
aVat an alarming rate.
p243
aVAnd what's lost on so many people
p244
aVis the sheer scale of which we're discussing.
p245
aVBecause the Everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water
p246
aVfor 7 million Floridians;
p247
aVtoday it also provides the agricultural fields
p248
aVfor the year-round tomatoes and oranges
p249
aVfor over 300 million Americans.
p250
aVAnd it's that same seasonal pulse of water in the summer
p251
aVthat built the river of grass 6,000 years ago.
p252
aVIronically, today, it's also responsible for the over half a million acres
p253
aVof the endless river of sugarcane.
p254
aVThese are the same fields that are responsible
p255
aVfor dumping exceedingly high levels of fertilizers into the watershed,
p256
aVforever changing the system.
p257
aa(lp258
VBut in order for you to not just understand how this system works,
p259
aVbut to also get personally connected to it,
p260
aVI decided to break the story down into several different narratives.
p261
aVAnd I wanted that story to start in Lake Okeechobee,
p262
aVthe beating heart of the Everglade system.
p263
aVAnd to do that, I picked an ambassador,
p264
aVan iconic species.
p265
aVThis is the Everglade snail kite.
p266
aVIt's a great bird,
p267
aVand they used to nest in the thousands,
p268
aVthousands in the northern Everglades.
p269
aVAnd then they've gone down to about 400 nesting pairs today.
p270
aVAnd why is that?
p271
aVWell, it's because they eat one source of food, an apple snail,
p272
aVabout the size of a ping-pong ball, an aquatic gastropod.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo as we started damming up the Everglades,
p275
aVas we started diking Lake Okeechobee and draining the wetlands,
p276
aVwe lost the habitat for the snail.
p277
aVAnd thus, the population of the kites declined.
p278
aVAnd so, I wanted a photo that would not only communicate this relationship
p279
aVbetween wetland, snail and bird,
p280
aVbut I also wanted a photo that would communicate
p281
aVhow incredible this relationship was,
p282
aVand how very important it is that they've come to depend on each other,
p283
aVthis healthy wetland and this bird.
p284
aVAnd to do that, I brainstormed this idea.
p285
aVI started sketching out these plans to make a photo,
p286
aVand I sent it to the wildlife biologist down in Okeechobee \u2014
p287
aVthis is an endangered bird, so it takes special permission to do.
p288
aVSo I built this submerged platform
p289
aVthat would hold snails just right under the water.
p290
aVAnd I spent months planning this crazy idea.
p291
aVAnd I took this platform down to Lake Okeechobee
p292
aVand I spent over a week in the water,
p293
aVwading waist-deep, 9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,
p294
aVto get one image that I thought might communicate this.
p295
aVAnd here's the day that it finally worked:
p296
aa(lp297
V[Video: (Mac Stone narrating) After setting up the platform,
p298
aVI look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails.
p299
aVAnd I see him scanning and searching.
p300
aVAnd he gets right over the trap,
p301
aVand I see that he's seen it.
p302
aVAnd he beelines, he goes straight for the trap.
p303
aVAnd in that moment, all those months of planning, waiting,
p304
aVall the sunburn, mosquito bites \u2014
p305
aVsuddenly, they're all worth it.
p306
aV(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh, I can't believe it!]
p307
aa(lp308
VYou can believe how excited I was when that happened.
p309
aVBut what the idea was,
p310
aVis that for someone who's never seen this bird
p311
aVand has no reason to care about it,
p312
aVthese photos, these new perspectives,
p313
aVwill help shed a little new light on just one species
p314
aVthat makes this watershed so incredible, so valuable, so important.
p315
aVNow, I know I can't come here to Gainesville
p316
aVand talk to you about animals in the Everglades
p317
aVwithout talking about gators.
p318
aVI love gators, I grew up loving gators.
p319
aVMy parents always said I had an unhealthy relationship with gators.
p320
aVBut what I like about them is,
p321
aVthey're like the freshwater equivalent of sharks.
p322
aVThey're feared, they're hated,
p323
aVand they are tragically misunderstood.
p324
aVBecause these are a unique species, they're not just apex predators.
p325
aVIn the Everglades,
p326
aVthey are the very architects of the Everglades,
p327
aVbecause as the water drops down in the winter
p328
aVduring the dry season,
p329
aVthey start excavating these holes called gator holes.
p330
aVAnd they do this because as the water drops down,
p331
aVthey'll be able to stay wet and they'll be able to forage.
p332
aVAnd now this isn't just affecting them,
p333
aVother animals also depend on this relationship,
p334
aVso they become a keystone species as well.
p335
aVSo how do you make an apex predator, an ancient reptile,
p336
aVat once look like it dominates the system,
p337
aVbut at the same time, look vulnerable?
p338
aVWell, you wade into a pit of about 120 of them,
p339
aVthen you hope that you've made the right decision.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VI still have all my fingers, it's cool.
p344
aa(lp345
VBut I understand, I know I'm not going to rally you guys,
p346
aVI'm not going to rally the troops to "Save the Everglades for the gators!"
p347
aVIt won't happen because they're so ubiquitous,
p348
aVwe see them now,
p349
aVthey're one of the great conservation success stories of the US.
p350
aVBut there is one species in the Everglades that no matter who you are,
p351
aVyou can't help but love, too, and that's the roseate spoonbill.
p352
aVThese birds are great, but they've had a really tough time in the Everglades,
p353
aVbecause they started out with thousands of nesting pairs in Florida Bay,
p354
aVand at the turn of the 20th century,
p355
aVthey got down to two \u2014 two nesting pairs.
p356
aVAnd why?
p357
aVThat's because women thought they looked better on their hats
p358
aVthen they did flying in the sky.
p359
aVThen we banned the plume trade,
p360
aVand their numbers started rebounding.
p361
aVAnd as their numbers started rebounding,
p362
aVscientists began to pay attention,
p363
aVthey started studying these birds.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd what they found out is that
p366
aVthese birds' behavior is intrinsically tied
p367
aVto the annual draw-down cycle of water in the Everglades,
p368
aVthe thing that defines the Everglades watershed.
p369
aVWhat they found out is that
p370
aVthese birds started nesting in the winter as the water drew down,
p371
aVbecause they're tactile feeders, so they have to touch whatever they eat.
p372
aVAnd so they wait for these concentrated pools of fish
p373
aVto be able to feed enough to feed their young.
p374
aVSo these birds became the very icon of the Everglades \u2014
p375
aVan indicator species of the overall health of the system.
p376
aVAnd just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid-20th century \u2014
p377
aVshooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 \u2014
p378
aVjust as that started happening, we started draining the southern Everglades.
p379
aVAnd we stopped two-thirds of that water from moving south.
p380
aVAnd it had drastic consequences.
p381
aVAnd just as those numbers started reaching their peak,
p382
aVunfortunately, today, the real spoonbill story,
p383
aVthe real photo of what it looks like is more something like this.
p384
aVAnd we're down to less than 70 nesting pairs in Florida Bay today,
p385
aVbecause we've disrupted the system so much.
p386
aVSo all these different organizations are shouting, they're screaming,
p387
aV"The Everglades is fragile! It's fragile!"
p388
aVIt is not.
p389
aVIt is resilient.
p390
aVBecause despite all we've taken, despite all we've done and we've drained
p391
aVand we've dammed and we've dredged it,
p392
aVpieces of it are still here, waiting to be put back together.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd this is what I've loved about South Florida,
p395
aVthat in one place, you have this unstoppable force of mankind
p396
aVmeeting the immovable object of tropical nature.
p397
aVAnd it's at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal.
p398
aVWhat is wilderness worth?
p399
aVWhat is the value of biodiversity, or our drinking water?
p400
aVAnd fortunately, after decades of debate,
p401
aVwe're finally starting to act on those questions.
p402
aVWe're slowly undertaking these projects
p403
aVto bring more freshwater back to the bay.
p404
aVBut it's up to us as citizens, as residents, as stewards
p405
aVto hold our elected officials to their promises.
p406
aa(lp407
VWhat can you do to help?
p408
aVIt's so easy.
p409
aVJust get outside, get out there.
p410
aVTake your friends out, take your kids out,
p411
aVtake your family out.
p412
aVHire a fishing guide.
p413
aVShow the state that protecting wilderness
p414
aVnot only makes ecological sense, but economic sense as well.
p415
aVIt's a lot of fun, just do it \u2014 put your feet in the water.
p416
aVThe swamp will change you, I promise.
p417
aa(lp418
VOver the years, we've been so generous
p419
aVwith these other landscapes around the country,
p420
aVcloaking them with this American pride,
p421
aVplaces that we now consider to define us:
p422
aVGrand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone.
p423
aVAnd we use these parks and these natural areas
p424
aVas beacons and as cultural compasses.
p425
aVAnd sadly, the Everglades is very commonly
p426
aVleft out of that conversation.
p427
aVBut I believe it's every bit as iconic and emblematic
p428
aVof who we are as a country
p429
aVas any of these other wildernesses.
p430
aVIt's just a different kind of wild.
p431
aa(lp432
VBut I'm encouraged,
p433
aVbecause maybe we're finally starting to come around,
p434
aVbecause what was once deemed this swampy wasteland,
p435
aVtoday is a World Heritage site.
p436
aVIt's a wetland of international importance.
p437
aVAnd we've come a long way in the last 60 years.
p438
aVAnd as the world's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project,
p439
aVthe international spotlight is on us in the Sunshine State.
p440
aVBecause if we can heal this system,
p441
aVit's going to become an icon for wetland restoration
p442

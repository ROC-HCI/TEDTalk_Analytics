(lp4
VYeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60,
p5
aVand I don't like being 60.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVAnd I started grappling
p8
aVwith this existential angst
p9
aVof what little I had done with my life.
p10
aVIt wasn't the resume
p11
aVof breaking this record here,
p12
aVit was more like, who had I become?
p13
aVHow had I spent my valuable time?
p14
aVHow could this have gone by
p15
aVlike lightning?
p16
aVAnd I couldn't forgive myself
p17
aVfor the countless, countless hours
p18
aVI had lost
p19
aVin negative thought \u2014
p20
aVall the time I had spent beating myself up
p21
aVfor losing my marriage
p22
aVand not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid
p23
aVand career moves
p24
aVand this and this and this.
p25
aVJust why, why didn't I do it better? Why? Why? Why?
p26
aVAnd then my mother died at 82.
p27
aVAnd so I starting thinking,
p28
aVnot only am I not happy with the past,
p29
aVnow I'm getting choked with,
p30
aV"I've only got 22 years left."
p31
aVWhat am I going to do with this short amount of time
p32
aVthat's just fleeting?
p33
aVAnd I'm not in the present whatsoever.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd I decided the remedy to all this malaise
p36
aVwas going to be
p37
aVfor me to chase
p38
aVan elevated dream,
p39
aVan extreme dream,
p40
aVsomething that would require
p41
aVutter conviction
p42
aVand unwavering passion,
p43
aVsomething that would make me
p44
aVbe my best self
p45
aVin every aspect of my life,
p46
aVevery minute of every day,
p47
aVbecause the dream was so big
p48
aVthat I couldn't get there
p49
aVwithout that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction.
p50
aVAnd I decided,
p51
aVit was an old dream that was lingering,
p52
aVthat was from so many years ago,
p53
aVthree decades ago \u2014
p54
aVthe only sort of world class swim
p55
aVI had tried and failed at back in my 20s \u2014
p56
aVwas going from Cuba to Florida.
p57
aVIt was deep in my imagination.
p58
aa(lp59
VNo one's ever done it without a shark cage.
p60
aVIt's daunting.
p61
aVIt's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean.
p62
aVIt's probably, at my speed, at my age \u2014
p63
aVfor anybody's speed at anybody's age \u2014
p64
aVgoing to take 60, maybe 70, hours
p65
aVof continuous swimming,
p66
aVnever getting out on the boat.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd I started to train.
p69
aVI hadn't swum for 31 years, not a stroke.
p70
aVAnd I had kept in good shape, but swimming's a whole different animal.
p71
aVAs a matter of fact,
p72
aVthis picture is supposed to be me during training.
p73
aVIt's a smiling face.
p74
aVAnd when you're training for this sport, you are not smiling.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVIt's an arduous, difficult sport,
p77
aVand I don't remember smiling
p78
aVat any time during this sport.
p79
aVAs I said, I respect other sports,
p80
aVand I compare this sport sometimes
p81
aVto cycling and to mountain climbing
p82
aVand other of the expedition type events,
p83
aVbut this is a sensory deprivation,
p84
aVa physical duress.
p85
aVAnd when I started in
p86
aVwith the eight hours and the 10 hours and the 12 hours
p87
aVand the 14 hours and the 15 hours and the 24-hour swims,
p88
aVI knew I had it,
p89
aVbecause I was making it through these.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim,
p92
aVand we're coming into the dock after a long day
p93
aVand it's now night,
p94
aVand we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes
p95
aVand I can touch the dock and we're done,
p96
aVthe trainer says, "That's great.
p97
aVIt's 14 hours 58 minutes. Who cares the last two minutes?"
p98
aVI say, "No, it's got to be 15 hours,"
p99
aVand I swim another minute out and another minute back
p100
aVto make the 15 hours.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I put together an expedition.
p103
aVIt's not that I didn't have help,
p104
aVbut honestly, I sort of led, I was the team leader.
p105
aVAnd to get the government permissions,
p106
aVyou read in the paper,
p107
aVyou think it's easy to get into Cuba everyday?
p108
aVTry going in with an armada like we had
p109
aVof 50 people and five boats
p110
aVand CNN's crew, etc.
p111
aVThe navigation is difficult.
p112
aVThere's a big river called the Gulf Stream
p113
aVthat runs across
p114
aVand it's not going in the direction you are.
p115
aVIt's going to the east and you'd like to go north.
p116
aVIt's tricky.
p117
aVAnd there's dehydration.
p118
aVAnd there's hypothermia.
p119
aVAnd there are sharks.
p120
aVAnd there are all kinds of problems.
p121
aVAnd I gathered together, honestly,
p122
aVthe world's leading experts in every possible way.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd a month ago,
p125
aVthe 23rd of September,
p126
aVI stood on that shore
p127
aVand I looked across
p128
aVto that long, long faraway horizon
p129
aVand I asked myself,
p130
aVdo you have it?
p131
aVAre your shoulders ready?
p132
aVAnd they were. They were prepared.
p133
aVNo stone left unturned.
p134
aVWas the mind ready?
p135
aVYou know, you're swimming with the fogged goggles,
p136
aVyou're swimming at 60 strokes a minute,
p137
aVso you're never really focused on anything, you don't see well.
p138
aVYou've got tight bathing caps over your ears
p139
aVtrying to keep the heat of the head,
p140
aVbecause it's where the hypothermia starts,
p141
aVand so you don't hear very well.
p142
aVYou're really left alone with your own thoughts.
p143
aVAnd I had all kinds of counting systems ready there
p144
aVin English, followed by German,
p145
aVfollowed by Spanish, followed by French.
p146
aVYou save the French for last.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd I had songs, I had a playlist in my head \u2014
p149
aVnot through headphones, in my own head \u2014
p150
aVof 65 songs.
p151
aVAnd I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night,
p152
aVbecause that's when Neil Young comes out.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVAnd it's odd, isn't it?
p155
aVYou'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah"
p156
aVout in the majesty of the ocean,
p157
aVnot songs about heroin addiction in New York City.
p158
aVBut no, for some reason
p159
aVI couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night
p160
aVand be singing,
p161
aV\u266b "A heard you knocking at my cellar door \u266b
p162
aV\u266b I love you baby and I want some more \u266b
p163
aV\u266b Ooh, ooh, the damage done" \u266b
p164
aa(lp165
V(Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VThe night before I started,
p168
aVI finished Stephen Hawking's "The Grand Design."
p169
aVAnd I couldn't wait
p170
aVto trip the mind fantastic.
p171
aVAbout the 50th hour,
p172
aVI was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe.
p173
aVIs there an edge?
p174
aVIs this an envelope we're living inside of,
p175
aVor no, does it go onto infinity in both time and space?
p176
aVAnd there's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean
p177
aVthat gets you thinking about things like this.
p178
aVI couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am,
p179
aVthat nobody else in the world can do this swim.
p180
aVAnd I knew I could do it.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd when I jumped into that water,
p183
aVI yelled in my mother's French, "Courage!"
p184
aVAnd I started swimming,
p185
aVand, oh my God, it was glassy.
p186
aVAnd we knew it, all 50 people on the boat,
p187
aVwe all knew this was it,
p188
aVthis was our time.
p189
aVAnd I reminded myself a couple hours in,
p190
aVyou know, the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself.
p191
aVFirst of all, you're going to hit obstacles.
p192
aVAnd even though you're feeling great at any one moment,
p193
aVdon't take it for granted, be ready,
p194
aVbecause there's going to be pain, there's going to be suffering.
p195
aVIt's not going to feel this good all the way across.
p196
aVAnd I was thinking of the hypothermia
p197
aVand maybe some shoulder pain
p198
aVand all the other things \u2014
p199
aVthe vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater.
p200
aVYou're immersed in the liquid.
p201
aVYour body doesn't like the saltwater.
p202
aVAfter a couple of days, three days,
p203
aVyou tend to rebel
p204
aVin a lot of physical ways.
p205
aa(lp206
VBut no, two hours in,
p207
aVwham! Never in my life ...
p208
aVI knew there were Portuguese men o' war,
p209
aVall kinds of moon jellies, all kinds of things,
p210
aVbut the box jellyfish from the southern oceans
p211
aVis not supposed to be in these waters.
p212
aVAnd I was on fire \u2014
p213
aVexcruciating, excruciating pain.
p214
aVI don't know if you can still see
p215
aVthe red line here and up the arm.
p216
aVEvidently, a piece this big of tentacle
p217
aVhas a hundred-thousand little barbs on it
p218
aVand each barb is not just stinging your skin,
p219
aVit's sending a venom.
p220
aVThe most venomous animal that lives in the ocean
p221
aVis the box jellyfish.
p222
aVAnd every one of those barbs
p223
aVis sending that venom into this central nervous system.
p224
aVSo first I feel like boiling hot oil,
p225
aVI've been dipped in.
p226
aVAnd I'm yelling out, "Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
p227
aVHelp me! Somebody help me!"
p228
aVAnd the next thing is paralysis.
p229
aVI feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here,
p230
aVand I can't breathe.
p231
aVAnd now I'm not swimming with a nice long stroke,
p232
aVI'm sort of crabbing it this way.
p233
aVThen come convulsions.
p234
aa(lp235
VA young man on our boat is an EMT. He dives in to try to help me.
p236
aVHe's stung.
p237
aVThey drag him out on the boat,
p238
aVand he's \u2014 evidently, I didn't see any of this \u2014 but lying on the boat
p239
aVand giving himself epinephrine shots
p240
aVand crying out.
p241
aVHe's 29 years old,
p242
aVvery well-built, lean, he's six-foot, five,
p243
aVweighs 265 lbs.,
p244
aVand he is down.
p245
aVAnd he is crying and he's yelling to my trainer
p246
aVwho's trying to help me.
p247
aVAnd he's saying, "Bonnie, I think I'm going to die.
p248
aVMy breath is down to three breaths a minute.
p249
aVI need help, and I can't help Diana."
p250
aa(lp251
VSo that was at eight o'clock at night.
p252
aVThe doctor, medical team from University of Miami
p253
aVarrived at five in the morning.
p254
aVSo I swam through the night,
p255
aVand at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots.
p256
aVI didn't get out,
p257
aVbut was in the water taking prednisone shots, taking Xanax,
p258
aVoxygen to the face.
p259
aVIt was like an ICU unit
p260
aVin the water.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVAnd I guess the story is
p263
aVthat even Navy SEALS who are stung by the box jelly,
p264
aVthey're done.
p265
aVThey either die or they quickly get to a hospital.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd I swam through the night and I swam through the next day.
p268
aVAnd the next night at dusk,
p269
aVagain, wham!
p270
aVThe box jelly again \u2014
p271
aVall across the neck, all across here.
p272
aVAnd this time,
p273
aVI don't like it, I didn't want to give into it,
p274
aVbut there's a difference between a non-stop swim
p275
aVand a staged swim.
p276
aVAnd I gave in
p277
aVto the staged swim.
p278
aVAnd they got me out and they started again
p279
aVwith the epinephrine and the prednisone
p280
aVand with the oxygen and with everything they had on board.
p281
aVAnd I got back in.
p282
aVAnd I swam through that night and into the next day.
p283
aVAnd at 41 hours,
p284
aVthis body couldn't make it.
p285
aVThe devastation of those stings
p286
aVhad taken the respiratory system down
p287
aVso that I couldn't make the progress I wanted.
p288
aVAnd the dream was crushed.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd how odd
p291
aVis this intelligent person who put this together
p292
aVand got all these world experts together.
p293
aVAnd I knew about the jellyfish,
p294
aVbut I was sort of cavalier.
p295
aVA lot of athletes have this, you know,
p296
aVsort of invincibility.
p297
aVThey should worry about me. I don't worry about them.
p298
aVI'll just swim right through them.
p299
aVWe've got benadryl on board. If I get stung, I'll just grin and bear it.
p300
aVWell there was no grin and bearing this.
p301
aa(lp302
VAs a matter of fact, the best advice I got
p303
aVwas from an elementary school class
p304
aVin the Caribbean.
p305
aVAnd I was telling these kids, 120 of them \u2014
p306
aVthey were all in the school on the gymnasium floor \u2014
p307
aVand I was telling them about the jellyfish
p308
aVand how they're gelatinous
p309
aVand you can't see them at night especially.
p310
aVAnd they have these
p311
aVlong 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles.
p312
aVAnd they do this wrapping.
p313
aVAnd they can send the poison into the system.
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd a little kid from the back was like this.
p316
aVAnd I said, "What's your name?" "Henry."
p317
aV"Henry, what's your question?"
p318
aVHe said, "Well, I didn't have a question so much
p319
aVas I had a suggestion."
p320
aVHe said, "You know those guys
p321
aVwho really believe in what they believe in
p322
aVand so they wear bombs?"
p323
aVAnd I said, "Well it's odd that you've learned of this
p324
aVas a noble kind of pursuit, but yeah, I know those guys."
p325
aVHe said, "That's what you need.
p326
aVYou need like a school of fish
p327
aVthat would swim in front of you like this."
p328
aV(Laughter)
p329
aV"And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish,
p330
aVthey're going to be busy with them,
p331
aVand you'll just scoot around."
p332
aVI said, "Oh, it's like a suicide army."
p333
aVHe said, "That's what I'm talking about. That's what you need."
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd little did I know,
p336
aVthat you should listen to eight year-olds.
p337
aVAnd so I started that swim
p338
aVin a bathing suit like normal,
p339
aVand, no joke, this is it; it came from the shark divers.
p340
aVI finished the swim like this.
p341
aVI was swimming with this thing on.
p342
aVThat's how scared of the jellyfish I was.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo now what do I do?
p345
aVI wouldn't mind
p346
aVif every one of you came up on this stage tonight
p347
aVand told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives.
p348
aVBecause we've all had them, haven't we?
p349
aVWe've all had a heartache.
p350
aVAnd so my journey now
p351
aVis to find some sort of grace
p352
aVin the face of this defeat.
p353
aVAnd I can look at the journey,
p354
aVnot just the destination.
p355
aVI can feel proud. I can stand here in front of you tonight
p356
aVand say I was courageous.
p357
aVYeah.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Applause)
p360
aa(lp361
VThank you.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd with all sincerity, I can say,
p364
aVI am glad I lived those two years of my life that way,
p365
aVbecause my goal to not suffer regrets anymore,
p366
aVI got there with that goal.
p367
aVWhen you live that way, when you live with that kind of passion,
p368
aVthere's no time, there's no time for regrets,
p369
aVyou're just moving forward.
p370
aVAnd I want to live every day of the rest of my life that way,
p371
aVswim or no swim.
p372
aVBut the difference
p373
aVin accepting this particular defeat
p374
aVis that sometimes,
p375
aVif cancer has won,
p376
aVif there's death and we have no choice,
p377
aVthen grace and acceptance
p378
aVare necessary.
p379
aa(lp380
VBut that ocean's still there.
p381
aVThis hope is still alive.
p382
aVAnd I don't want to be the crazy woman
p383
aVwho does it for years and years and years,
p384
aVand tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails,
p385
aVbut I can swim from Cuba to Florida,
p386
aVand I will swim from Cuba to Florida.
p387
aa(lp388
VThank you.
p389
aVThank you.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Applause)
p392
aa(lp393
VThank you.
p394
aa(lp395
V(Applause)
p396
aa(lp397
VAnd so, what after that?
p398
aVAre you going to swim the Atlantic?
p399
aVNo, that's the last swim.
p400
aVIt's the only swim I'm interested in.
p401
aVBut I'm ready.
p402
aVAnd by the way, a reporter called me the other day
p403
aVand he said he looked on Wikipedia
p404
aVand he said he saw my birthday was August 22nd 1949,
p405
aVand for some odd reason in Wikipedia,
p406
aVthey had my death date too.
p407
aV(Laughter)
p408
aVHe said, "Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born, New York City,
p409
aVand it's going to be in January of '35?"
p410
aVI said, "Nope. I didn't know."
p411
aVAnd now I'm going to live to 85.
p412
aVI have three more years than I thought.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd so I ask myself,
p415
aVI'm starting to ask myself now,
p416
aVeven before this extreme dream
p417
aVgets achieved for me,
p418
aVI'm asking myself,
p419
aVand maybe I can ask you tonight too,
p420
aVto paraphrase the poet
p421
aVMary Oliver,
p422
aVshe says, "So what is it,
p423
aVwhat is it you're doing,
p424
aVwith this one wild and precious life of yours?"
p425
aa(lp426
VThank you very much.
p427
aa(lp428
V(Applause)
p429
aa(lp430
VThank you. Thank you.
p431
aVThank you. Thank you.
p432
aa(lp433
V(Applause)
p434
aVLive it large. Live it large.

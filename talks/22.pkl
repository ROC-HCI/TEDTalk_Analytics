VI'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society,
p5
aVpublisher of "Skeptic" magazine.
p6
aVWe investigate claims of the paranormal,
p7
aVpseudo-science, fringe groups and cults, and claims of all kinds between,
p8
aVscience and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science,
p9
aVvoodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science,
p10
aVand plain old non-sense.
p11
aVAnd unless you've been on Mars recently,
p12
aVyou know there's a lot of that out there.
p13
aa(lp14
VSome people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative term.
p15
aVBut let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.
p16
aVWe are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there \u2014
p17
aVwell, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
Vtrying to replace bad ideas with good ideas.
p22
aa(lp23
VI'll show you an example of a bad idea.
p24
aVI brought this with me,
p25
aVthis was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.
p26
aVIt's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia.
p27
aVIt's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VThis was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece.
p32
aVIt's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.
p33
aVYou could dowse for all sorts of things,
p34
aVbut this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana
p35
aVin students' lockers.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VSo the way it works is you go down the hallway,
p40
aVand you see if it tilts toward a particular locker,
p41
aVand then you open the locker.
p42
aVSo it looks something like this.
p43
aVI'll show you.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VWell, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.
p48
aVWell, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment.
p49
aVIt'll go this way for sure.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VSir, do you want to empty your pockets, please, sir?
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VSo the question was, can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers?
p58
aVAnd the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
V(Applause)
p63
aa(lp64
VBut in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits.
p65
aVAnd that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here:
p66
aVThis is how psychics work, astrologers, tarot card readers and so on.
p67
aVPeople remember the hits and forget the misses.
p68
aVIn science, we keep the whole database,
p69
aVand look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out
p70
aVfrom the total number you'd expect by chance.
p71
aa(lp72
VIn this case, we tested it.
p73
aa(lp74
VWe had two opaque boxes:
p75
aVone with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing.
p76
aVAnd it got it 50 percent of the time \u2014
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
Vwhich is exactly what you'd expect with a coin-flip model.
p81
aVSo that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.
p82
aa(lp83
V"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication. Each one has a particular theme.
p84
aVThis one is on the future of intelligence.
p85
aVAre people getting smarter or dumber?
p86
aVI have an opinion of this myself because of the business I'm in,
p87
aVbut in fact, people, it turns out, are getting smarter.
p88
aVThree IQ points per 10 years, going up.
p89
aVSort of an interesting thing.
p90
aa(lp91
VWith science, don't think of skepticism as a thing, or science as a thing.
p92
aVAre science and religion compatible?
p93
aVIt's like, are science and plumbing compatible?
p94
aVThey're just two different things.
p95
aVScience is not a thing. It's a verb.
p96
aVIt's a way of thinking about things.
p97
aVIt's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.
p98
aa(lp99
VI mean, what's more likely:
p100
aVthat extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings
p101
aVtravel across vast distances of interstellar space
p102
aVto leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush, Kansas
p103
aVto promote skeptic.com, our web page?
p104
aVOr is it more likely that a reader of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?
p105
aVAnd in all cases we have to ask \u2014
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VWhat's the more likely explanation?
p110
aVBefore we say something is out of this world,
p111
aVwe should first make sure that it's not in this world.
p112
aVWhat's more likely:
p113
aVthat Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship,
p114
aVor that the "World Weekly News" makes stuff up?
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VThe same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.
p119
aVFor those of you in the back, it says here: "Then a miracle occurs.
p120
aVI think you need to be more explicit here in step two."
p121
aVThis single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments.
p122
aVThere's nothing more to it than that.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Applause)
p125
aa(lp126
VYou can say a miracle occurs,
p127
aVit's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything.
p128
aVThere's nothing to test.
p129
aVIt's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd it's true, scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers \u2014
p132
aVdark energy or dark matter, something like that \u2014
p133
aVuntil we figure out what it is, we'll call it this.
p134
aVIt's the beginning of the causal chain for science.
p135
aVFor intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain.
p136
aVSo again, we can ask this: what's more likely?
p137
aVAre UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?
p138
aa(lp139
VThis is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California,
p140
aVlooking down over Pasadena.
p141
aVAnd if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is.
p142
aVYou don't even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment,
p143
aVyou don't need computers.
p144
aVThis was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera.
p145
aVYou just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go.
p146
aVCamera's ready \u2014 that's it.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VSo, although it's possible that most of these things are fake
p151
aVor illusions or so on, and that some of them are real,
p152
aVit's more likely that all of them are fake, like the crop circles.
p153
aa(lp154
VOn a more serious note, in all of science we're looking for a balance
p155
aVbetween data and theory.
p156
aVIn the case of Galileo, he had two problems
p157
aVwhen he turned his telescope to Saturn.
p158
aVFirst of all, there was no theory of planetary rings.
p159
aVSecond of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy,
p160
aVand he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at.
p161
aVSo he wrote that he had seen \u2014
p162
aV"I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies."
p163
aVAnd this is what he ended up concluding that he saw.
p164
aVSo without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data,
p165
aVyou can't have a good theory.
p166
aVIt wasn't solved until 1655.
p167
aa(lp168
VThis is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes
p169
aVpeople made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.
p170
aVIt wasn't till Huygens had two things:
p171
aVHe had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated,
p172
aVand he had better telescopic, more fine-grain data
p173
aVin which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster \u2014
p174
aVaccording to Kepler's Laws \u2014 than Saturn, then we catch up with it.
p175
aVAnd we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there.
p176
aVAnd that, in fact, turns out to be true.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases.
p179
aVSo one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things
p180
aVis that we have things, on a simple level,
p181
aVand then I'll go to more serious ones.
p182
aVLike, we have a tendency to see faces.
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is the face on Mars.
p185
aVIn 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area
p186
aVbecause people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians.
p187
aVHere's the close-up of it from 2001.
p188
aVIf you squint, you can still see the face.
p189
aVAnd when you're squinting,
p190
aVyou're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain,
p191
aVso you're reducing the quality of your data.
p192
aVAnd if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face,
p193
aVbecause we're programmed by evolution to see faces.
p194
aa(lp195
VFaces are important for us socially.
p196
aVAnd of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see.
p197
aVYou see the happy face on Mars, there.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VIf astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.
p202
aVDo you see him there? Little froggy legs.
p203
aVOr if geologists were elephants?
p204
aa(lp205
VReligious iconography.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VDiscovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.
p210
aVHe charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun
p211
aVtill he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer.
p212
aVHere's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street,
p213
aVor is it up the street from here?
p214
aVTree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy,
p215
aVblack-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking \u2014
p216
aVhumans are pattern-seeking animals.
p217
aa(lp218
VHere's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.
p219
aVHere's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich \u2014
p220
aVwhich I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino \u2014
p221
aVof course, this being America.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VThis casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VBut who does it really look like? The Virgin Mary?
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VIt has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look.
p234
aa(lp235
VVirgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.
p236
aVI actually went to see this one.
p237
aVThere was a lot of people there.
p238
aVThe faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on.
p239
aVWe went down and investigated.
p240
aVJust to give you a size, that's Dawkins, me and The Amazing Randi,
p241
aVnext to this two, two and a half story-sized image.
p242
aVAll these candles, thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this.
p243
aVSo we walked around the backside, to see what was going on.
p244
aVIt turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree,
p245
aVyou get the effect.
p246
aVHere's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.
p247
aVI guess you can only have one miracle per building.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VSo is it really a miracle of Mary, or is it a miracle of Marge?
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VAnd now I'm going to finish up with another example of this,
p256
aVwith auditory illusions.
p257
aVThere's this film, "White Noise," with Michael Keaton,
p258
aVabout the dead talking back to us.
p259
aVBy the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal.
p260
aVAnybody can do it, turns out.
p261
aVIt's getting the dead to talk back that's the really hard part.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VIn this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena.
p266
aVThere's a ReverseSpeech.com web page where I downloaded this stuff.
p267
aVThis is the most famous one of all of these.
p268
aVHere's the forward version of the very famous song.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Music with lyrics)
p271
aa(lp272
VIf there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now.
p273
aVIt's just a spring clean for the May Queen.
p274
aVYes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run,
p275
aVThere's still time to change the road you're on.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Music ends)
p278
aa(lp279
VCouldn't you just listen to that all day?
p280
aa(lp281
VAll right, here it is backwards,
p282
aVand see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Music with unintelligible lyrics)
p285
aa(lp286
V(Lyrics) Satan!
p287
aa(lp288
V(Unintelligible lyrics continue)
p289
aa(lp290
VWhat did you get? Audience: Satan!
p291
aa(lp292
VSatan. OK, at least we got "Satan".
p293
aVNow, I'll prime the auditory part of your brain
p294
aVto tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Music with lyrics)
p297
aa(lp298
V(Music ends)
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VYou can't miss it when I tell you what's there.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VI'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story.
p309
aVThe Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization.
p310
aVWe're always looking for little good things that people do.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd in England, there's a pop singer.
p313
aVOne of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.
p314
aVAnd she wrote a beautiful song.
p315
aVIt was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."
p316
aVIt's a love story \u2014 she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK \u2014
p317
aVabout how she much loves her guy,
p318
aVand compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth.
p319
aVAnd she has this one passage here.
p320
aa(lp321
V(Music)
p322
aa(lp323
V(Lyrics) We are 12 billion light-years from the edge
p324
aa(lp325
VThat's a guess,
p326
aa(lp327
VNo one can ever say it's true,
p328
aa(lp329
VBut I know that I will always be with you.
p330
aa(lp331
VMichael Shermer: Well, that's nice. At least she got it close.
p332
aVIn America it'd be, "We're 6,000 light years from the edge."
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VBut my friend, Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator,
p337
aVwho wrote the book "The Big Bang," and so on,
p338
aVuses every chance he gets to promote good science.
p339
aVAnd so he wrote an op-ed piece in "The Guardian" about Katie's song,
p340
aVin which he said, well, we know exactly how far from the edge.
p341
aVYou know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess.
p342
aVWe know within precise error bars how close it is.
p343
aVSo we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true.
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd, to his credit, Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out, and said,
p346
aV"I'm so embarrassed. I was in the astronomy club.
p347
aVI should've known better."
p348
aVAnd she re-cut the song.
p349
aVSo I will end with the new version.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Music with lyrics)
p352
aa(lp353
VWe are 13.7 billion light years
p354
aVfrom the edge of the observable universe.
p355
aVThat's a good estimate with well-defined error bars.
p356
aVAnd with the available information,
p357
aVI predict that I will always be with you.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Laughter)
p360
aa(lp361
VHow cool is that?
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)

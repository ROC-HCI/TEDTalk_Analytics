VHave you ever wondered what animals think and feel?
p5
aVLet's start with a question:
p6
aVDoes my dog really love me, or does she just want a treat?
p7
aVWell, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us,
p8
aVeasy to see, right,
p9
aVwhat's going on in that fuzzy little head.
p10
aVWhat is going on?
p11
aVSomething's going on.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut why is the question always do they love us?
p14
aVWhy is it always about us?
p15
aVWhy are we such narcissists?
p16
aVI found a different question to ask animals.
p17
aVWho are you?
p18
aa(lp19
VThere are capacities of the human mind
p20
aVthat we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind.
p21
aVBut is that true?
p22
aVWhat are other beings doing with those brains?
p23
aVWhat are they thinking and feeling?
p24
aVIs there a way to know?
p25
aVI think there is a way in.
p26
aVI think there are several ways in.
p27
aVWe can look at evolution, we can look at their brains
p28
aVand we can watch what they do.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe first thing to remember is: our brain is inherited.
p31
aVThe first neurons came from jellyfish.
p32
aVJellyfish gave rise to the first chordates.
p33
aVThe first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates.
p34
aVThe vertebrates came out of the sea,
p35
aVand here we are.
p36
aVBut it's still true that a neuron, a nerve cell, looks the same
p37
aVin a crayfish, a bird or you.
p38
aVWhat does that say about the minds of crayfish?
p39
aVCan we tell anything about that?
p40
aVWell, it turns out that if you give a crayfish
p41
aVa lot of little tiny electric shocks
p42
aVevery time it tries to come out of its burrow,
p43
aVit will develop anxiety.
p44
aVIf you give the crayfish the same drug
p45
aVused to treat anxiety disorder in humans,
p46
aVit relaxes and comes out and explores.
p47
aVHow do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety?
p48
aVMostly, we boil them.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VOctopuses use tools, as well as do most apes
p53
aVand they recognize human faces.
p54
aVHow do we celebrate the ape-like intelligence of this invertebrate?
p55
aVMostly boiled.
p56
aVIf a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral,
p57
aVit will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping
p58
aVand it will signal to the moray, "Follow me,"
p59
aVand the moray will understand that signal.
p60
aVThe moray may go into the crevice and get the fish,
p61
aVbut the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it.
p62
aVThis is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about.
p63
aVHow do we celebrate that ancient partnership?
p64
aVMostly fried.
p65
aVA pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us
p66
aVthan it does about them.
p67
aa(lp68
VSea otters use tools
p69
aVand they take time away from what they're doing
p70
aVto show their babies what to do, which is called teaching.
p71
aVChimpanzees don't teach.
p72
aVKiller whales teach and killer whales share food.
p73
aa(lp74
VWhen evolution makes something new,
p75
aVit uses the parts it has in stock, off the shelf,
p76
aVbefore it fabricates a new twist.
p77
aVAnd our brain has come to us
p78
aVthrough the enormity of the deep sweep of time.
p79
aVIf you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain,
p80
aVwhat you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain.
p81
aVIt's a good thing ours is bigger, because we're also really insecure.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VBut, uh oh, there's a dolphin,
p86
aVa bigger brain with more convolutions.
p87
aVOK, maybe you're saying, all right, well, we see brains,
p88
aVbut what does that have to say about minds?
p89
aVWell, we can see the working of the mind
p90
aVin the logic of behaviors.
p91
aVSo these elephants, you can see,
p92
aVobviously, they are resting.
p93
aVThey have found a patch of shade under the palm trees
p94
aVunder which to let their babies sleep,
p95
aVwhile they doze but remain vigilant.
p96
aVWe make perfect sense of that image
p97
aVjust as they make perfect sense of what they're doing
p98
aVbecause under the arc of the same sun on the same plains,
p99
aVlistening to the howls of the same dangers,
p100
aVthey became who they are and we became who we are.
p101
aa(lp102
VWe've been neighbors for a very long time.
p103
aVNo one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed.
p104
aVThey're obviously very concerned about something.
p105
aVWhat are they concerned about?
p106
aVIt turns out that if you record the voices of tourists
p107
aVand you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes,
p108
aVelephants will ignore it, because tourists never bother elephants.
p109
aVBut if you record the voices of herders
p110
aVwho carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes,
p111
aVthe elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker.
p112
aVNot only do elephants know that there are humans,
p113
aVthey know that there are different kinds of humans,
p114
aVand that some are OK and some are dangerous.
p115
aa(lp116
VThey have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them.
p117
aVThey know us better than we know them.
p118
aVWe have the same imperatives:
p119
aVtake care of our babies, find food, try to stay alive.
p120
aVWhether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa
p121
aVor outfitted for diving under the sea, we are basically the same.
p122
aVWe are kin under the skin.
p123
aVThe elephant has the same skeleton,
p124
aVthe killer whale has the same skeleton,
p125
aVas do we.
p126
aVWe see helping where help is needed.
p127
aVWe see curiosity in the young.
p128
aVWe see the bonds of family connections.
p129
aVWe recognize affection.
p130
aVCourtship is courtship.
p131
aVAnd then we ask, "Are they conscious?"
p132
aa(lp133
VWhen you get general anesthesia, it makes you unconscious,
p134
aVwhich means you have no sensation of anything.
p135
aVConsciousness is simply the thing that feels like something.
p136
aVIf you see, if you hear, if you feel, if you're aware of anything,
p137
aVyou are conscious, and they are conscious.
p138
aa(lp139
VSome people say
p140
aVwell, there are certain things that make humans humans,
p141
aVand one of those things is empathy.
p142
aVEmpathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions.
p143
aVIt's a very useful thing.
p144
aVIf your companions start to move quickly,
p145
aVyou have to feel like you need to hurry up.
p146
aVWe're all in a hurry now.
p147
aVThe oldest form of empathy is contagious fear.
p148
aVIf your companions suddenly startle and fly away,
p149
aVit does not work very well for you to say,
p150
aV"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left."
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VEmpathy is old, but empathy, like everything else in life,
p155
aVcomes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration.
p156
aVSo there's basic empathy: you feel sad, it makes me sad.
p157
aVI see you happy, it makes me happy.
p158
aa(lp159
VThen there's something that I call sympathy,
p160
aVa little more removed:
p161
aV"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away.
p162
aVI don't feel that same grief, but I get it; I know what you feel
p163
aVand it concerns me."
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd then if we're motivated to act on sympathy,
p166
aVI call that compassion.
p167
aa(lp168
VFar from being the thing that makes us human,
p169
aVhuman empathy is far from perfect.
p170
aVWe round up empathic creatures, we kill them and we eat them.
p171
aVNow, maybe you say OK, well, those are different species.
p172
aVThat's just predation, and humans are predators.
p173
aVBut we don't treat our own kind too well either.
p174
aVPeople who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior
p175
aVknow that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions
p176
aVto other species.
p177
aVWell, I think that's silly,
p178
aVbecause attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species
p179
aVis the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling,
p180
aVbecause their brains are basically the same as ours.
p181
aVThey have the same structures.
p182
aVThe same hormones that create mood and motivation in us
p183
aVare in those brains as well.
p184
aVIt is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they're hunting
p185
aVand they're tired when their tongues are hanging out,
p186
aVand then say when they're playing with their children
p187
aVand acting joyful and happy,
p188
aVwe have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything.
p189
aVThat is not scientific.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo OK, so a reporter said to me,
p192
aV"Maybe, but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel?"
p193
aVAnd I started to rifle through all the hundreds
p194
aVof scientific references that I put in my book
p195
aVand I realized that the answer was right in the room with me.
p196
aVWhen my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me \u2014
p197
aVnot to the couch, to me \u2014
p198
aVand she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly,
p199
aVshe has had the thought, "I would like my belly rubbed.
p200
aVI know that I can go over to Carl,
p201
aVhe will understand what I'm asking.
p202
aVI know I can trust him because we're family.
p203
aVHe'll get the job done, and it will feel good."
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VShe has thought and she has felt,
p208
aVand it's really not more complicated than that.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut we see other animals and we say, "Oh look, killer whales,
p211
aVwolves, elephants:
p212
aVthat's not how they see it."
p213
aa(lp214
VThat tall-finned male is L41.
p215
aVHe's 38 years old.
p216
aVThe female right on his left side is L22.
p217
aVShe's 44.
p218
aVThey've known each other for decades.
p219
aVThey know exactly who they are.
p220
aVThey know who their friends are.
p221
aVThey know who their rivals are.
p222
aVTheir life follows the arc of a career.
p223
aVThey know where they are all the time.
p224
aa(lp225
VThis is an elephant named Philo.
p226
aVHe was a young male.
p227
aVThis is him four days later.
p228
aVHumans not only can feel grief, we create an awful lot of it.
p229
aVWe want to carve their teeth.
p230
aVWhy can't we wait for them to die?
p231
aVElephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea
p232
aVall the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.
p233
aVIn 1980, there were vast strongholds of elephant range
p234
aVin Central and Eastern Africa.
p235
aVAnd now their range is shattered into little shards.
p236
aVThis is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction,
p237
aVa fellow being, the most magnificent creature on land.
p238
aa(lp239
VOf course, we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States.
p240
aVIn Yellowstone National Park, we killed every single wolf.
p241
aVWe killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border, actually.
p242
aVBut in the park, park rangers did that in the 1920s,
p243
aVand then 60 years later they had to bring them back,
p244
aVbecause the elk numbers had gotten out of control.
p245
aVAnd then people came.
p246
aVPeople came by the thousands to see the wolves,
p247
aVthe most accessibly visible wolves in the world.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves.
p250
aVA pack is a family.
p251
aVIt has some breeding adults and the young of several generations.
p252
aVAnd I watched the most famous, most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park.
p253
aVAnd then, when they wandered just outside the border,
p254
aVtwo of their adults were killed,
p255
aVincluding the mother,
p256
aVwhich we sometimes call the alpha female.
p257
aVThe rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry.
p258
aVSisters kicked out other sisters.
p259
aVThat one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family.
p260
aVThey wouldn't let her because they were jealous of her.
p261
aVShe was getting too much attention from two new males,
p262
aVand she was the precocious one.
p263
aVThat was too much for them.
p264
aVShe wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot.
p265
aVThe alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family.
p266
aVAs winter was coming in,
p267
aVhe lost his territory, his hunting support,
p268
aVthe members of his family and his mate.
p269
aa(lp270
VWe cause so much pain to them.
p271
aVThe mystery is, why don't they hurt us more than they do?
p272
aVThis whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale
p273
aVwith his companions who had killed that whale.
p274
aVThose people in the boat had nothing at all to fear.
p275
aVThis whale is T20.
p276
aVHe had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions.
p277
aVThe seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat.
p278
aVThey had nothing to fear.
p279
aVThey eat seals.
p280
aVWhy don't they eat us?
p281
aVWhy can we trust them around our toddlers?
p282
aVWhy is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog
p283
aVand led them miles until the fog parted
p284
aVand the researchers' home was right there on the shoreline?
p285
aVAnd that's happened more than one time.
p286
aa(lp287
VIn the Bahamas, there's a woman named Denise Herzing,
p288
aVand she studies spotted dolphins and they know her.
p289
aVShe knows them very well. She knows who they all are.
p290
aVThey know her. They recognize the research boat.
p291
aVWhen she shows up, it's a big happy reunion.
p292
aVExcept, one time showed up and they didn't want to come near the boat,
p293
aVand that was really strange.
p294
aVAnd they couldn't figure out what was going on
p295
aVuntil somebody came out on deck
p296
aVand announced that one of the people onboard had died
p297
aVduring a nap in his bunk.
p298
aVHow could dolphins know that one of the human hearts
p299
aVhad just stopped?
p300
aVWhy would they care?
p301
aVAnd why would it spook them?
p302
aVThese mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on
p303
aVin the minds that are with us on Earth
p304
aVthat we almost never think about at all.
p305
aa(lp306
VAt an aquarium in South Africa
p307
aVwas a little baby bottle-nosed dolphin named Dolly.
p308
aVShe was nursing, and one day a keeper took a cigarette break
p309
aVand he was looking into the window into their pool, smoking.
p310
aVDolly came over and looked at him,
p311
aVwent back to her mother, nursed for a minute or two,
p312
aVcame back to the window
p313
aVand released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke.
p314
aVSomehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin
p315
aVgot the idea of using milk to represent smoke.
p316
aVWhen human beings use one thing to represent another,
p317
aVwe call that art.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VThe things that make us human
p322
aVare not the things that we think make us human.
p323
aVWhat makes us human is that,
p324
aVof all these things that our minds and their minds have,
p325
aVwe are the most extreme.
p326
aVWe are the most compassionate,
p327
aVmost violent, most creative
p328
aVand most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet,
p329
aVand we are all of those things all jumbled up together.
p330
aVBut love is not the thing that makes us human.
p331
aVIt's not special to us.
p332
aVWe are not the only ones who care about our mates.
p333
aVWe are not the only ones who care about our children.
p334
aa(lp335
VAlbatrosses frequently fly six, sometimes ten thousand miles
p336
aVover several weeks to deliver one meal, one big meal,
p337
aVto their chick who is waiting for them.
p338
aVThey nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world,
p339
aVand this is what it looks like.
p340
aVPassing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being.
p341
aVIf that stops, it all goes away.
p342
aVIf anything is sacred, that is, and into that sacred relationship
p343
aVcomes our plastic trash.
p344
aVAll of these birds have plastic in them now.
p345
aVThis is an albatross six months old, ready to fledge \u2014
p346
aVdied, packed with red cigarette lighters.
p347
aa(lp348
VThis is not the relationship we are supposed to have
p349
aVwith the rest of the world.
p350
aVBut we, who have named ourselves after our brains,
p351
aVnever think about the consequences.
p352
aVWhen we welcome new human life into the world,
p353
aVwe welcome our babies into the company of other creatures.
p354
aVWe paint animals on the walls.
p355
aVWe don't paint cell phones.
p356
aVWe don't paint work cubicles.
p357
aVWe paint animals to show them that we are not alone.
p358
aVWe have company.
p359
aVAnd every one of those animals in every painting of Noah's ark,
p360
aVdeemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now,
p361
aVand their flood is us.
p362
aa(lp363
VSo we started with a question:
p364
aVDo they love us?
p365
aVWe're going to ask another question.
p366
aVAre we capable of using what we have
p367
aVto care enough to simply let them continue?
p368
aa(lp369
VThank you very much.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Applause)

VMy name is Harry Baker. Harry Baker is my name.
p5
aVIf your name was Harry Baker, then our names would be the same.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VIt's a short introductory part.
p9
aa(lp10
VYeah, I'm Harry.
p11
aVI study maths. I write poetry.
p12
aVSo I thought I'd start with a love poem about prime numbers.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VThis is called "59."
p16
aVI was going to call it "Prime Time Loving."
p17
aVThat reaction is why I didn't.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, "59."
p21
aa(lp22
V59 wakes up on the wrong  side of the bed.
p23
aa(lp24
VRealizes all his hair is  on one side of his head.
p25
aa(lp26
VTakes just under a minute to work out that it\u2019s because of the way that he slept.
p27
aa(lp28
VHe finds some clothes and gets dressed.
p29
aa(lp30
VHe can\u2019t help but look in the mirror and be subtly impressed
p31
aa(lp32
VHow he looks rough around the edges and yet casually messed.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd as he glances out the window, he sees the sight that he gets blessed with
p35
aVof 60 from across the street.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow 60 was beautiful.
p38
aa(lp39
VWith perfectly trimmed cuticles, dressed in something suitable.
p40
aa(lp41
VNever rude or crude at all.
p42
aa(lp43
VUnimprovable, right on time as usual, more on cue than a snooker ball
p44
aVbut liked to play it super cool.
p45
aa(lp46
V59 wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower.
p47
aa(lp48
VHe thought of her every second, every minute, every hour.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut he knew it wouldn\u2019t work, he\u2019d never get the girl.
p51
aa(lp52
VBecause although she lived  across the street
p53
aVthey came from different worlds.
p54
aa(lp55
VWhile 59 admired 60\u2019s perfectly round figure,
p56
aV60 thought 59 was odd. (Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VOne of his favorite films was "101 Dalmatians."
p59
aa(lp60
VShe preferred the sequel.
p61
aa(lp62
VHe romanticized the idea they were star-crossed lovers.
p63
aa(lp64
VThey could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other.
p65
aa(lp66
VWhile she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother
p67
aa(lp68
VThat separate could not be equal.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd though at the time he felt stupid and dumb
p71
aa(lp72
VFor trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid mum,
p73
aa(lp74
VHe should have been comforted by the simple sum.
p75
aa(lp76
VTake 59 away from 60, and you\u2019re left with the one.
p77
aa(lp78
VSure enough after two months of moping around,
p79
aa(lp80
V61 days later, 61 was who he found,
p81
aa(lp82
VHe had lost his keys  and his parents were out.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo one day after school  he went into a house
p85
aa(lp86
VAs he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door,
p87
aa(lp88
VHe wondered why he\u2019d never introduced himself before,
p89
aa(lp90
VAs she let him in, his jaw  dropped in awe.
p91
aa(lp92
V61 was like 60, but a little bit more. (Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VShe had prettier eyes, and an approachable smile,
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd like him, rough around the edges, casual style,
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd like him, everything was in disorganized piles,
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd like him, her mum didn\u2019t mind if friends stayed a while.
p101
aa(lp102
VBecause she was like him,  and he liked her.
p103
aa(lp104
VHe reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her,
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd it was different this time. I mean, this girl was wicked,
p107
aa(lp108
VSo he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits.
p109
aa(lp110
VShe said, "I'm 61." He grinned, said, "I'm 59."
p111
aa(lp112
VToday I\u2019ve had a really nice time,
p113
aa(lp114
VSo tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine?
p115
aa(lp116
VShe said, "Sure."
p117
aa(lp118
VShe loved talking to someone  just as quirky,
p119
aa(lp120
VShe agreed to this unofficial first date.
p121
aa(lp122
VIn the end he was only ready one minute early,
p123
aa(lp124
VBut it didn\u2019t matter because she arrived one minute late.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd from that moment on there was nonstop chatter,
p127
aa(lp128
VHow they loved "X Factor," how they had two factors,
p129
aa(lp130
VHow that did not matter, distinctiveness made them better,
p131
aa(lp132
VBy the end of the night they knew they were meant together.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd one day she was talking about stuck-up 60,
p135
aa(lp136
VShe noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty.
p137
aa(lp138
VHe blushed, told her of his crush:
p139
aa(lp140
V\u201cThe best thing that never happened because it led to us.\u201d
p141
aa(lp142
V61 was clever, see, not prone to jealousy,
p143
aa(lp144
VShe looked him in the eyes and told him quite tenderly,
p145
aa(lp146
V"You\u2019re 59, I\u2019m 61, together we combine to become twice what 60 could ever be."
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VAt this point 59 had tears in his eyes,
p150
aa(lp151
VWas so glad to have this one-of-a-kind girl in his life.
p152
aa(lp153
VHe told her the very definition of being prime
p154
aa(lp155
VWas that with only one and himself could his heart divide,
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd she was the one he wanted to give his heart to,
p158
aa(lp159
VShe said she felt the same and now she knew the films were half true.
p160
aa(lp161
VBecause that wasn't real love, that love was just a sample,
p162
aa(lp163
VWhen it came to real love, they were a prime example.
p164
aa(lp165
VCheers.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VThat was the first poem that I wrote
p170
aVand it was for a prime number-themed  poetry night \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p171
aVwhich turned out to be a prime number-themed poetry competition.
p172
aVAnd I became a prime number-themed poetry competition winner,
p173
aVor as I like to call it, a prime minister. (Laughter)
p174
aVAnd this is how I discovered these things called poetry slams,
p175
aVand if you don't know what  a poetry slam is,
p176
aVit was a format come up with in America 30 years ago
p177
aVas a way of tricking people into going to poetry events
p178
aVby putting an exciting word like "slam" on the end.
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd each performer got three minutes to perform
p182
aVand then random audience members would hold up scorecards,
p183
aVand they would end up with a numerical score,
p184
aVand what this meant is,
p185
aVit kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience
p186
aVand encouraged the kind of connection with the listener.
p187
aVAnd what it also means is you can win.
p188
aVAnd if you win a poetry slam, you can call yourself a slam champion
p189
aVand pretend you're a wrestler,
p190
aVand if you lose a poetry slam you can say, "Oh, what? Poetry's a subjective art form,
p191
aVyou can't put numbers on such things."
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VBut I loved it, and I got involved in these slams,
p195
aVand I became the U.K. slam champion
p196
aVand got invited to the Poetry World Cup in Paris,
p197
aVwhich was unbelievable.
p198
aVIt was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages
p199
aVto be judged by five French strangers.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVAnd somehow, I won, which was great,
p202
aVand I've been able to travel the world since doing it,
p203
aVbut it also means that this next piece
p204
aVis technically the best poem in the world.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVSo...
p207
aV(Applause)
p208
aVAccording to five French strangers.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo this is "Paper People."
p211
aa(lp212
VI like people.
p213
aa(lp214
VI'd like some paper people.
p215
aa(lp216
VThey\u2019d be purple paper people. Maybe pop-up purple paper people.
p217
aa(lp218
VProper pop-up purple paper people.
p219
aa(lp220
V"How do you prop up pop-up purple paper people?"
p221
aa(lp222
VI hear you cry. Well I ...
p223
aa(lp224
VI\u2019d probably prop up proper pop-up purple paper people
p225
aa(lp226
Vwith a proper pop-up purple people paperclip,
p227
aa(lp228
Vbut I\u2019d pre-prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives,
p229
aa(lp230
Va cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the paper slipped.
p231
aa(lp232
VBecause I could build a pop-up metropolis.
p233
aa(lp234
Vbut I wouldn\u2019t wanna deal with all the paper people politics.
p235
aa(lp236
Vpaper politicians with their paper-thin policies,
p237
aa(lp238
Vbroken promises without appropriate apologies.
p239
aa(lp240
VThere\u2019d be a little paper me. And a little paper you.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd we could watch paper TV and it would all be pay-per-view.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VWe\u2019d see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package
p246
aa(lp247
Vor watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the A4.
p248
aV(Laughter) Paper.
p249
aa(lp250
VThere\u2019d be a paper princess Kate but we\u2019d all stare at paper Pippa,
p251
aa(lp252
Vand then we\u2019d all live in fear of killer Jack the Paper-Ripper,
p253
aa(lp254
Vbecause the paper propaganda propagates the people's prejudices,
p255
aa(lp256
Vpapers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists.
p257
aa(lp258
VA little paper me. And a little paper you.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd in a pop-up population people\u2019s problems pop up too.
p261
aa(lp262
VThere\u2019d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch,
p263
aa(lp264
Vand who ignored the people's protests about all the paper cuts,
p265
aa(lp266
Vthen the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces,
p267
aa(lp268
Vby the confetti cannons manned by pre-emptive police.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd yes there\u2019d still be paper money, so there\u2019d still be paper greed,
p271
aa(lp272
Vand the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need,
p273
aa(lp274
Vpurchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties,
p275
aa(lp276
Vothers live in poverty and ain\u2019t acknowledged properly.
p277
aa(lp278
VA proper poor economy where so many are proper poor,
p279
aa(lp280
Vbut while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars.
p281
aa(lp282
VOrigami armies unfold plans for paper planes
p283
aa(lp284
Vand we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains,
p285
aa(lp286
Vbut the greater shame is that it always seems to stay the same,
p287
aa(lp288
Vwhat changes is who\u2019s in power choosing how to lay the blame,
p289
aa(lp290
Vthey\u2019re naming names, forgetting these are names of people,
p291
aa(lp292
Vbecause in the end it all comes down to people.
p293
aa(lp294
VI like people.
p295
aa(lp296
V'Cause even when the situation\u2019s dire,
p297
aa(lp298
Vit is only ever people who are able to inspire,
p299
aa(lp300
Vand on paper, it\u2019s hard to see how we all cope.
p301
aa(lp302
VBut in the bottom of Pandora\u2019s box there\u2019s still hope,
p303
aa(lp304
Vand I still hope 'cause I believe in people.
p305
aa(lp306
VPeople like my grandparents.
p307
aa(lp308
VWho every single day since I was born,
p309
aVhave taken time out of their morning to pray for me.
p310
aa(lp311
VThat\u2019s 7892 days straight of someone checking I\u2019m okay,
p312
aVand that\u2019s amazing.
p313
aa(lp314
VPeople like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners.
p315
aa(lp316
VPeople who are capable of genuine forgiveness.
p317
aa(lp318
VPeople like the persecuted Palestinians.
p319
aa(lp320
VPeople who go out of their way to make your life better,
p321
aVand expect nothing in return.
p322
aa(lp323
VYou see, people have potential to be powerful.
p324
aa(lp325
VJust because the people in power tend to pretend to be victims
p326
aa(lp327
Vwe don\u2019t need to succumb to that system.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd a paper population is no different.
p330
aa(lp331
VThere\u2019s a little paper me. And a little paper you.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd in a pop-up population people's problems pop up too,
p334
aa(lp335
Vbut even if the whole world fell apart then we\u2019d still make it through.
p336
aa(lp337
VBecause we\u2019re people.
p338
aa(lp339
VThank you.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Applause)
p342
aa(lp343
VThank you very much. I've just got time for one more.
p344
aa(lp345
VFor me, poetry has been the ultimate way of ideas without frontiers.
p346
aVWhen I first started,
p347
aVthe people who inspired me were the ones with the amazing stories,
p348
aVand I thought, as an 18-year-old with a happy life, it was too normal,
p349
aVbut I could create these worlds where I could talk about my experiences
p350
aVand dreams and beliefs.
p351
aVSo it's amazing to be here in front of you today.
p352
aVThank you for being here.
p353
aVIf you weren't here,
p354
aVit would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aVAnd this is more fun.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo this last one is called "The Sunshine Kid."
p359
aa(lp360
VThank you very much for listening.
p361
aa(lp362
VOld man sunshine was proud of his sun,
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd it brightened his day to see his little boy run,
p365
aa(lp366
VNot because of what he\u2019d done, nor the problems overcome,
p367
aa(lp368
VBut that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one.
p369
aa(lp370
VIt hadn\u2019t always been like this.
p371
aa(lp372
VThere\u2019d been times when he\u2019d tried to hide his brightness,
p373
aa(lp374
VYou see, every star hits periods of hardship,
p375
aa(lp376
VIt takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness.
p377
aa(lp378
VIf we go back to when he was born in a nebula,
p379
aa(lp380
VWe know that he never was thought of as regular,
p381
aa(lp382
VBecause he had a flair about him,
p383
aa(lp384
VTo say the Midas touch is wrong
p385
aa(lp386
VBut all he went near seemed to turn a little bronze,
p387
aa(lp388
VYes this sun was loved by some more than others,
p389
aa(lp390
VIt was a case of Joseph and his dreamcoat and his brothers
p391
aa(lp392
VBecause standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons,
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd jealousy created enemies in those he outshone
p395
aa(lp396
VSuch as the Shadow People.
p397
aa(lp398
VNow the Shadow People didn\u2019t like the Sunshine Kid,
p399
aa(lp400
VBecause he showed up the dark things the Shadow People did,
p401
aa(lp402
VAnd when he shone he showed the places where the Shadow People hid,
p403
aa(lp404
VSo the Shadow People had an evil plan to get rid of him,
p405
aa(lp406
VFirst up \u2014 they made fun of his sunspots,
p407
aa(lp408
VShooting his dreams from the sky, their words were gunshots,
p409
aa(lp410
VDesigned to remind him he wasn\u2019t very cool
p411
aa(lp412
VAnd he didn\u2019t fit in with any popular kids at school.
p413
aa(lp414
VThey said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to Earth,
p415
aa(lp416
VEssentially he came from nothing and that is what he was worth,
p417
aa(lp418
VHe\u2019d never get to go to university to learn,
p419
aa(lp420
VOnly degrees he\u2019d ever show would be the first degree burns
p421
aa(lp422
VFrom those that came too close,
p423
aVthey told him he was too bright,
p424
aa(lp425
VThat\u2019s why no one ever looked him in the eyes,
p426
aa(lp427
VHis judgment became clouded
p428
aa(lp429
VSo did the sky, With evaporated tears
p430
aa(lp431
Vas the sun started to cry.
p432
aa(lp433
VBecause the sunshine kid was bright, with a warm personality,
p434
aa(lp435
VAnd inside he burned savagely
p436
aa(lp437
VHurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folk
p438
aa(lp439
Vwho spoke holes in his soul and left cavities,
p440
aa(lp441
VAnd as his heart hardened, his spark darkened,
p442
aa(lp443
VEvery time they called him names it cooled his flames,
p444
aa(lp445
VHe thought they might like him if he kept his light dim
p446
aa(lp447
VBut they were busy telling lightning she had terrible aim,
p448
aa(lp449
VHe couldn\u2019t quite get to grips with what they said,
p450
aa(lp451
VSo he let his light be eclipsed by what they said,
p452
aa(lp453
VHe fell into a Lone Star State like Texas,
p454
aa(lp455
VAnd felt like he\u2019d been punched in his solar plexus.
p456
aa(lp457
VBut that\u2019s when Little Miss Sunshine came along
p458
aa(lp459
VSinging her favorite song about how we\u2019re made to be strong,
p460
aa(lp461
VAnd you don\u2019t have to be wrong to belong, Just be true to who you are,
p462
aa(lp463
Vbecause we are all stars at heart.
p464
aa(lp465
VLittle Miss Sunshine was hot stuff,
p466
aa(lp467
VThe kind of girl when you looked at her
p468
aa(lp469
Vyou forgot stuff,
p470
aa(lp471
VBut for him, there was no forgetting her,
p472
aa(lp473
VThe minute he saw her her image burned in his retina,
p474
aa(lp475
VShe was out of this world, and she accepted him,
p476
aa(lp477
VSomething about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him,
p478
aa(lp479
VThings weren\u2019t as dark as they seemed, and he dared to dream,
p480
aa(lp481
VShadows were nowhere to be seen; when she was there he beamed,
p482
aa(lp483
VHis eyes would light up in ways that can\u2019t be faked,
p484
aa(lp485
VWhen she grinned her rays erased the razor-tipped words of hate,
p486
aa(lp487
VThey gave each other nicknames, they were "cool star" and "fun sun,"
p488
aa(lp489
VAnd gradually the shadowy damage became undone,
p490
aa(lp491
VShe was one in a septillion, and she was brilliant,
p492
aa(lp493
VCould turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion,
p494
aa(lp495
VLoved by billions, from Chileans to Brazilians,
p496
aa(lp497
VAnd taught the Sunshine Kid the meaning of resilience.
p498
aa(lp499
VShe said: \u201cAll the darkness in the world
p500
aa(lp501
Vcannot put out the light from a single candle
p502
aa(lp503
VSo how the hell can they handle your light?
p504
aa(lp505
VOnly you can choose to dim it, and the sky is the limit,
p506
aVso silence the critics by burning.\u201d
p507
aa(lp508
VAnd if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtains
p509
aa(lp510
VAnd let the sun shine through the hurting.
p511
aa(lp512
VIn a universe of adversity these stars stuck together,
p513
aa(lp514
VAnd though days became nights the memories would last forever,
p515
aa(lp516
VWhether the weatherman said it or not, it would be fine,
p517
aa(lp518
V'Cause even behind the clouds the kid could still shine.
p519
aa(lp520
VYes, the Sunshine Kid was bright, with a warm personality,
p521
aa(lp522
VAnd inside he burned savagely,
p523
aa(lp524
VFueled by the fire inspired across galaxies
p525
aa(lp526
VBy the girl who showed him belief.
p527
aa(lp528
VThank you very much.
p529
aa(lp530
V(Applause)

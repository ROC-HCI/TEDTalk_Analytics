VYou know, one of the intense pleasures of travel
p5
aVand one of the delights of ethnographic research
p6
aVis the opportunity to live amongst those
p7
aVwho have not forgotten the old ways,
p8
aVwho still feel their past in the wind,
p9
aVtouch it in stones polished by rain,
p10
aVtaste it in the bitter leaves of plants.
p11
aVJust to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,
p12
aVor the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,
p13
aVor that in the Himalaya,
p14
aVthe Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,
p15
aVis to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,
p16
aVand that is the idea that the world in which we live
p17
aVdoes not exist in some absolute sense,
p18
aVbut is just one model of reality,
p19
aVthe consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices
p20
aVthat our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.
p23
aVWe're all born. We all bring our children into the world.
p24
aVWe go through initiation rites.
p25
aVWe have to deal with the inexorable separation of death,
p26
aVso it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance,
p27
aVwe all have art.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song,
p30
aVthe rhythm of the dance in every culture.
p31
aVAnd whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo,
p32
aVor the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti,
p33
aVor the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya,
p34
aVthe Curandero in the mountains of the Andes,
p35
aVor a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara \u2014
p36
aVthis is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with
p37
aVa month ago \u2014
p38
aVor indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma,
p39
aVEverest, the goddess mother of the world.
p40
aa(lp41
VAll of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being,
p42
aVother ways of thinking,
p43
aVother ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.
p44
aVAnd this is an idea, if you think about it,
p45
aVcan only fill you with hope.
p46
aVNow, together the myriad cultures of the world
p47
aVmake up a web of spiritual life and cultural life
p48
aVthat envelops the planet,
p49
aVand is as important to the well-being of the planet
p50
aVas indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.
p51
aVAnd you might think of this cultural web of life
p52
aVas being an ethnosphere,
p53
aVand you might define the ethnosphere
p54
aVas being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,
p55
aVideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being
p56
aVby the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.
p57
aVThe ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.
p58
aVIt's the symbol of all that we are
p59
aVand all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,
p62
aVso too is the ethnosphere
p63
aV\u2014 and, if anything, at a far greater rate.
p64
aVNo biologists, for example, would dare suggest
p65
aVthat 50 percent of all species or more have been or are
p66
aVon the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,
p67
aVand yet that \u2014 the most apocalyptic scenario
p68
aVin the realm of biological diversity \u2014
p69
aVscarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario
p70
aVin the realm of cultural diversity.
p71
aVAnd the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.
p72
aa(lp73
VWhen each of you in this room were born,
p74
aVthere were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.
p75
aVNow, a language is not just a body of vocabulary
p76
aVor a set of grammatical rules.
p77
aVA language is a flash of the human spirit.
p78
aVIt's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture
p79
aVcomes into the material world.
p80
aVEvery language is an old-growth forest of the mind,
p81
aVa watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey,
p84
aVfully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.
p85
aVThey're no longer being taught to babies,
p86
aVwhich means, effectively, unless something changes,
p87
aVthey're already dead.
p88
aVWhat could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence,
p89
aVto be the last of your people to speak your language,
p90
aVto have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors
p91
aVor anticipate the promise of the children?
p92
aVAnd yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody
p93
aVsomewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks,
p94
aVbecause every two weeks, some elder dies
p95
aVand carries with him into the grave the last syllables
p96
aVof an ancient tongue.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better,
p99
aVwouldn't the world be a better place
p100
aVif we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great,
p101
aVlet's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese.
p102
aVLet's make it Kogi."
p103
aVAnd you'll suddenly discover what it would be like
p104
aVto be unable to speak your own language.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd so, what I'd like to do with you today
p107
aVis sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere,
p108
aVa brief journey through the ethnosphere,
p109
aVto try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.
p110
aVNow, there are many of us who sort of forget
p111
aVthat when I say "different ways of being,"
p112
aVI really do mean different ways of being.
p113
aa(lp114
VTake, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon,
p115
aVthe people of the anaconda
p116
aVwho believe that mythologically they came up the milk river
p117
aVfrom the east in the belly of sacred snakes.
p118
aVNow, this is a people who cognitively
p119
aVdo not distinguish the color blue from the color green
p120
aVbecause the canopy of the heavens
p121
aVis equated to the canopy of the forest
p122
aVupon which the people depend.
p123
aVThey have a curious language and marriage rule
p124
aVwhich is called "linguistic exogamy:"
p125
aVyou must marry someone who speaks a different language.
p126
aVAnd this is all rooted in the mythological past,
p127
aVyet the curious thing is in these long houses,
p128
aVwhere there are six or seven languages spoken
p129
aVbecause of intermarriage,
p130
aVyou never hear anyone practicing a language.
p131
aVThey simply listen and then begin to speak.
p132
aa(lp133
VOr, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with,
p134
aVthe Waorani of northeastern Ecuador,
p135
aVan astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.
p136
aVIn 1957, five missionaries attempted contact
p137
aVand made a critical mistake.
p138
aVThey dropped from the air
p139
aV8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves
p140
aVin what we would say to be friendly gestures,
p141
aVforgetting that these people of the rainforest
p142
aVhad never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.
p143
aVThey picked up these photographs from the forest floor,
p144
aVtried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure,
p145
aVfound nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards
p146
aVfrom the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.
p147
aVBut the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.
p148
aVThey speared each other.
p149
aV54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.
p150
aVWe traced genealogies back eight generations,
p151
aVand we found two instances of natural death
p152
aVand when we pressured the people a little bit about it,
p153
aVthey admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old
p154
aVthat he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter)
p155
aVBut at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge
p156
aVof the forest that was astonishing.
p157
aVTheir hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces
p158
aVand tell you what species left it behind.
p159
aa(lp160
VIn the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment
p161
aVwhen I was asked by my professor at Harvard
p162
aVif I was interested in going down to Haiti,
p163
aVinfiltrating the secret societies
p164
aVwhich were the foundation of Duvalier's strength
p165
aVand Tonton Macoutes,
p166
aVand securing the poison used to make zombies.
p167
aVIn order to make sense out of sensation, of course,
p168
aVI had to understand something about this remarkable faith
p169
aVof Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.
p170
aVOn the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.
p171
aVIt's interesting.
p172
aVIf I asked you to name the great religions of the world,
p173
aVwhat would you say?
p174
aVChristianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.
p175
aa(lp176
VThere's always one continent left out,
p177
aVthe assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa
p178
aVhad no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did
p179
aVand Voodoo is simply the distillation
p180
aVof these very profound religious ideas
p181
aVthat came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.
p182
aVBut, what makes Voodoo so interesting
p183
aVis that it's this living relationship
p184
aVbetween the living and the dead.
p185
aVSo, the living give birth to the spirits.
p186
aVThe spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,
p187
aVresponding to the rhythm of the dance
p188
aVto momentarily displace the soul of the living,
p189
aVso that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.
p190
aVThat's why the Voodooists like to say
p191
aVthat "You white people go to church and speak about God.
p192
aVWe dance in the temple and become God."
p193
aVAnd because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit \u2014
p194
aVhow can you be harmed?
p195
aVSo you see these astonishing demonstrations:
p196
aVVoodoo acolytes in a state of trance
p197
aVhandling burning embers with impunity,
p198
aVa rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind
p199
aVto affect the body that bears it
p200
aVwhen catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.
p201
aa(lp202
VNow, of all the peoples that I've ever been with,
p203
aVthe most extraordinary are the Kogi
p204
aVof the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.
p205
aVDescendants of the ancient Tairona civilization
p206
aVwhich once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,
p207
aVin the wake of the conquest,
p208
aVthese people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif
p209
aVthat soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.
p210
aVIn a bloodstained continent,
p211
aVthese people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.
p212
aVTo this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood
p213
aVbut the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.
p214
aVThe young acolytes are taken away from their families
p215
aVat the age of three and four,
p216
aVsequestered in a shadowy world of darkness
p217
aVin stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:
p218
aVtwo nine-year periods
p219
aVdeliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation
p220
aVthey spend in their natural mother's womb;
p221
aVnow they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.
p222
aVAnd for this entire time,
p223
aVthey are inculturated into the values of their society,
p224
aVvalues that maintain the proposition that their prayers
p225
aVand their prayers alone maintain the cosmic \u2014
p226
aVor we might say the ecological \u2014 balance.
p227
aVAnd at the end of this amazing initiation,
p228
aVone day they're suddenly taken out
p229
aVand for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,
p230
aVthey see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness
p231
aVof first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes
p232
aVof the stunningly beautiful landscape,
p233
aVsuddenly everything they have learned in the abstract
p234
aVis affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back
p235
aVand says, "You see? It's really as I've told you.
p236
aVIt is that beautiful. It is yours to protect."
p237
aVThey call themselves the "elder brothers"
p238
aVand they say we, who are the younger brothers,
p239
aVare the ones responsible for destroying the world.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, this level of intuition becomes very important.
p242
aVWhenever we think of indigenous people and landscape,
p243
aVwe either invoke Rousseau
p244
aVand the old canard of the "noble savage,"
p245
aVwhich is an idea racist in its simplicity,
p246
aVor alternatively, we invoke Thoreau
p247
aVand say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.
p248
aVWell, indigenous people are neither sentimental
p249
aVnor weakened by nostalgia.
p250
aVThere's not a lot of room for either
p251
aVin the malarial swamps of the Asmat
p252
aVor in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,
p253
aVthrough time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth
p254
aVthat is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,
p255
aVbut on a far subtler intuition:
p256
aVthe idea that the Earth itself can only exist
p257
aVbecause it is breathed into being by human consciousness.
p258
aa(lp259
VNow, what does that mean?
p260
aVIt means that a young kid from the Andes
p261
aVwho's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit
p262
aVthat will direct his or her destiny
p263
aVwill be a profoundly different human being
p264
aVand have a different relationship to that resource
p265
aVor that place than a young kid from Montana
p266
aVraised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock
p267
aVready to be mined.
p268
aVWhether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.
p269
aVWhat's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship
p270
aVbetween the individual and the natural world.
p271
aVI was raised in the forests of British Columbia
p272
aVto believe those forests existed to be cut.
p273
aVThat made me a different human being
p274
aVthan my friends amongst the Kwagiulth
p275
aVwho believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw
p276
aVand the Crooked Beak of Heaven
p277
aVand the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world,
p278
aVspirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.
p279
aa(lp280
VNow, if you begin to look at the idea
p281
aVthat these cultures could create different realities,
p282
aVyou could begin to understand
p283
aVsome of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.
p284
aVIt's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.
p285
aVThis is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,
p286
aVthe most powerful psychoactive preparation
p287
aVof the shaman's repertoire.
p288
aVWhat makes ayahuasca fascinating
p289
aVis not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,
p290
aVbut the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:
p291
aVon the one hand, this woody liana
p292
aVwhich has in it a series of beta-carbolines,
p293
aVharmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic \u2014
p294
aVto take the vine alone
p295
aVis rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke
p296
aVdrift across your consciousness \u2014
p297
aVbut it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family
p298
aVcalled Psychotria viridis.
p299
aVThis plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,
p300
aVvery close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,
p301
aV5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.
p302
aVIf you've ever seen the Yanomami
p303
aVblowing that snuff up their noses,
p304
aVthat substance they make from a different set of species
p305
aValso contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
p306
aVTo have that powder blown up your nose
p307
aVis rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel
p308
aVlined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter)
p309
aVIt doesn't create the distortion of reality;
p310
aVit creates the dissolution of reality.
p311
aa(lp312
VIn fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes \u2014
p313
aVwho is a man who sparked the psychedelic era
p314
aVwith his discovery of the magic mushrooms
p315
aVin Mexico in the 1930s \u2014
p316
aVI used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines
p317
aVas hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects
p318
aVthere's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VBut the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally
p321
aVbecause they're denatured by an enzyme
p322
aVfound naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.
p323
aVThey can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction
p324
aVwith some other chemical that denatures the MAO.
p325
aVNow, the fascinating things
p326
aVare that the beta-carbolines found within that liana
p327
aVare MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary
p328
aVto potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.
p329
aVHow, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,
p330
aVdo these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants
p331
aVthat when combined in this way,
p332
aVcreated a kind of biochemical version
p333
aVof the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?
p334
aa(lp335
VWell, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error,"
p336
aVwhich is exposed to be meaningless.
p337
aVBut you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us."
p338
aa(lp339
VWell, what does that mean?
p340
aVThis tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,
p341
aVall of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,
p342
aVall of which are referable to our eye as one species.
p343
aVAnd then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy
p344
aVand they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.
p345
aVI mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No."
p346
aVWell, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties
p347
aVin the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.
p348
aVNow, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,
p349
aVbut it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
VNow \u2014
p352
aV(Applause) \u2014
p353
aVthe problem \u2014 the problem is that even those of us
p354
aVsympathetic with the plight of indigenous people
p355
aVview them as quaint and colorful
p356
aVbut somehow reduced to the margins of history
p357
aVas the real world, meaning our world, moves on.
p358
aVWell, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,
p359
aVis not going to be remembered for its wars
p360
aVor its technological innovations,
p361
aVbut rather as the era in which we stood by
p362
aVand either actively endorsed or passively accepted
p363
aVthe massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity
p364
aVon the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.
p365
aVAll cultures through all time
p366
aVhave constantly been engaged in a dance
p367
aVwith new possibilities of life.
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd the problem is not technology itself.
p370
aVThe Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux
p371
aVwhen they gave up the bow and arrow
p372
aVany more than an American stopped being an American
p373
aVwhen he gave up the horse and buggy.
p374
aVIt's not change or technology
p375
aVthat threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,
p376
aVthe crude face of domination.
p377
aVWherever you look around the world,
p378
aVyou discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;
p379
aVthese are dynamic living peoples
p380
aVbeing driven out of existence by identifiable forces
p381
aVthat are beyond their capacity to adapt to:
p382
aVwhether it's the egregious deforestation
p383
aVin the homeland of the Penan \u2014
p384
aVa nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak \u2014
p385
aVa people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,
p386
aVand now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution
p387
aVon the banks of the rivers,
p388
aVwhere you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt
p389
aVthat seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
p390
aVto the South China Sea,
p391
aVwhere the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon
p392
aVready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest \u2014
p393
aVor, in the case of the Yanomami,
p394
aVit's the disease entities that have come in,
p395
aVin the wake of the discovery of gold.
p396
aa(lp397
VOr if we go into the mountains of Tibet,
p398
aVwhere I'm doing a lot of research recently,
p399
aVyou'll see it's a crude face of political domination.
p400
aVYou know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people
p401
aVis universally condemned, but ethnocide,
p402
aVthe destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,
p403
aVit's universally, in many quarters, celebrated
p404
aVas part of a development strategy.
p405
aVAnd you cannot understand the pain of Tibet
p406
aVuntil you move through it at the ground level.
p407
aVI once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China
p408
aVoverland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa
p409
aVwith a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa
p410
aVthat I understood the face behind the statistics
p411
aVyou hear about:
p412
aV6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,
p413
aV1.2 million people killed by the cadres
p414
aVduring the Cultural Revolution.
p415
aVThis young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.
p416
aVThat meant he was instantly killed
p417
aVat the time of the Chinese invasion.
p418
aVHis uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora
p419
aVthat took the people to Nepal.
p420
aVHis mother was incarcerated
p421
aVfor the crime of being wealthy.
p422
aVHe was smuggled into the jail at the age of two
p423
aVto hide beneath her skirt tails
p424
aVbecause she couldn't bear to be without him.
p425
aVThe sister who had done that brave deed
p426
aVwas put into an education camp.
p427
aVOne day she inadvertently stepped on an armband
p428
aVof Mao, and for that transgression,
p429
aVshe was given seven years of hard labor.
p430
aVThe pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,
p431
aVbut the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.

aa(lp433
VAnd in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice:
p434
aVdo we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony
p435
aVor do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?
p436
aVMargaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,
p437
aVthat her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards
p438
aVthis blandly amorphous generic world view
p439
aVnot only would we see the entire range of the human imagination
p440
aVreduced to a more narrow modality of thought,
p441
aVbut that we would wake from a dream one day
p442
aVhaving forgotten there were even other possibilities.
p443
aa(lp444
VAnd it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps,
p445
aVbeen around for [150,000] years.
p446
aVThe Neolithic Revolution \u2014 which gave us agriculture,
p447
aVat which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed;
p448
aVthe poetry of the shaman was displaced
p449
aVby the prose of the priesthood;
p450
aVwe created hierarchy specialization surplus \u2014
p451
aVis only 10,000 years ago.
p452
aVThe modern industrial world as we know it
p453
aVis barely 300 years old.
p454
aVNow, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me
p455
aVthat we have all the answers for all of the challenges
p456
aVthat will confront us in the ensuing millennia.
p457
aVWhen these myriad cultures of the world
p458
aVare asked the meaning of being human,
p459
aVthey respond with 10,000 different voices.
p460
aa(lp461
VAnd it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility
p462
aVof being what we are: a fully conscious species,
p463
aVfully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens
p464
aVfind a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.
p465
aa(lp466
VThis is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island
p467
aVwhen I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people,
p468
aVand this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.
p469
aVThe Canadian government has not always been kind
p470
aVto the Inuit people, and during the 1950s,
p471
aVto establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.
p472
aVThis old man's grandfather refused to go.
p473
aVThe family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons,
p474
aVall of his tools.
p475
aVNow, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold;
p476
aVthey took advantage of it.
p477
aVThe runners of their sleds were originally made of fish
p478
aVwrapped in caribou hide.
p479
aVSo, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night
p480
aVor the blizzard that was blowing.
p481
aVHe simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers
p482
aVand defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,
p483
aVhe shaped it into the form of a blade.
p484
aVHe put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife
p485
aVand as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.
p486
aVHe skinned the dog and improvised a harness,
p487
aVtook the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,
p488
aVharnessed up an adjacent dog,
p489
aVand disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.
p490
aVTalk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter)
p491
aa(lp492
VAnd this, in many ways \u2014
p493
aV(Applause) \u2014
p494
aVis a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people
p495
aVand of all indigenous people around the world.
p496
aVThe Canadian government in April of 1999
p497
aVgave back to total control of the Inuit
p498
aVan area of land larger than California and Texas put together.
p499
aVIt's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.
p500
aVIt's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.
p501
aVAn amazing example of how a nation-state
p502
aVcan seek restitution with its people.
p503
aa(lp504
VAnd finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious
p505
aVat least to all of all us who've traveled
p506
aVin these remote reaches of the planet,
p507
aVto realize that they're not remote at all.
p508
aVThey're homelands of somebody.
p509
aVThey represent branches of the human imagination
p510
aVthat go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us,
p511
aVthe dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children,
p512
aVbecome part of the naked geography of hope.
p513
aa(lp514
VSo, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally,
p515
aVis, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.
p516
aVWe think that polemics \u2014
p517
aV(Applause) \u2014
p518
aVwe think that polemics are not persuasive,
p519
aVbut we think that storytelling can change the world,
p520
aVand so we are probably the best storytelling institution
p521
aVin the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.
p522
aV156 nations carry our television channel.
p523
aVOur magazines are read by millions.
p524
aVAnd what we're doing is a series of journeys
p525
aVto the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience
p526
aVto places of such cultural wonder
p527
aVthat they cannot help but come away dazzled
p528
aVby what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,
p529
aVembrace gradually, one by one,
p530
aVthe central revelation of anthropology:
p531
aVthat this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,
p532
aVthat we can find a way to live
p533
aVin a truly multicultural, pluralistic world
p534
aVwhere all of the wisdom of all peoples
p535
aVcan contribute to our collective well-being.
p536
aa(lp537
VThank you very much.
p538
aV(Applause)

A National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, he has been described as &ldquo;a rare combination of scientist, scholar, poet and passionate defender of all of life&rsquo;s diversity.&rdquo; Trained in anthropology and botany at Harvard, he travels the globe to live alongside indigenous people, and document their cultural practices in books, photographs, and film. His stunning photographs and evocative stories capture the viewer&#39;s imagination. As a speaker, he parlays that sense of wonder into passionate concern over the rate at which cultures and languages are disappearing -- 50 percent of the world&#39;s 7,000 languages, he says, are no longer taught to children. He argues, in the most beautiful terms, that language is much more than vocabulary and grammatical rules. Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind. &nbsp;</p><p>Indigenous cultures are not failed attempts at modernity, let alone failed attempts to be us. They are unique expressions of the human imagination and heart, unique answers to a fundamental question: What does it mean to be human and alive? When asked this question, the peoples of the world respond in 7,000 different voices, and these collectively comprise our human repertoire for dealing with all the challenges that will confront us as a species over the coming centuries.</p><p>Davis is the author of 15 books including&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/serpentandrainbow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Serpent and the Rainbow</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/oneriver\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>One River</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/wayfinders\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Wayfinders</em></a>. His many film credits include <em>Light at the Edge of the World</em>, an eight-hour documentary series produced for the National Geographic. In 2009 he received the Gold Medal from the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for his contributions to anthropology and conservation, and he is the 2011 recipient of the Explorers Medal, the highest award of the Explorers&rsquo; Club, and the 2012 recipient of the Fairchild Medal for Plant Exploration.

articulate and influential western advocate for the world&#39;s indigenous cultures. A National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, he has been described as &ldquo;a rare combination of scientist, scholar, poet and passionate defender of all of life&rsquo;s diversity.&rdquo; Trained in anthropology and botany at Harvard, he travels the globe to live alongside indigenous people, and document their cultural practices in books, photographs, and film. His stunning photographs and evocative stories capture the viewer&#39;s imagination. As a speaker, he parlays that sense of wonder into passionate concern over the rate at which cultures and languages are disappearing -- 50 percent of the world&#39;s 7,000 languages, he says, are no longer taught to children. He argues, in the most beautiful terms, that language is much more than vocabulary and grammatical rules. Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind. &nbsp;</p><p>Indigenous cultures are not failed attempts at modernity, let alone failed attempts to be us. They are unique expressions of the human imagination and heart, unique answers to a fundamental question: What does it mean to be human and alive? When asked this question, the peoples of the world respond in 7,000 different voices, and these collectively comprise our human repertoire for dealing with all the challenges that will confront us as a species over the coming centuries.</p><p>Davis is the author of 15 books including&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/serpentandrainbow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Serpent and the Rainbow</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/oneriver\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>One River</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/wayfinders\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Wayfinders</em></a>. His many film credits include <em>Light at the Edge of the World</em>, an eight-hour documentary series produced for the National Geographic. In 2009 he received the Gold Medal from the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for his contributions to anthropology and conservation, and he is the 2011 recipient of the Explorers Medal, the highest award of the Explorers&rsquo; Club, and the 2012 recipient of the Fairchild Medal for Plant Exploration. His latest books are&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/intothesilence\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory and the Conquest of Everest</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/sacredheadwaters\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Sacred Headwaters: the Fight to Save the Stikine, Skeena and the Nass</em></a><em>.</em></p>", "slug": "wade_davis", "whotheyare": "A National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, Wade Davis has been described as \\u201ca rare combination of scientist, scholar, poet and passionate defender of all of life\\u2019s diversity.\\u201d", "whatotherssay": "His work with indigenous cultures has given him a truly unique view of the world.

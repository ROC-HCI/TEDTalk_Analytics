VWhat does a working mother look like?
p5
aVIf you ask the Internet, this is what you'll be told.
p6
aVNever mind that this is what you'll actually produce
p7
aVif you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VBut no, this isn't a working mother.
p12
aVYou'll notice a theme in these photos. We'll look at a lot of them.
p13
aVThat theme is amazing natural lighting,
p14
aVwhich, as we all know,
p15
aVis the hallmark of every American workplace.
p16
aa(lp17
VThere are thousands of images like these.
p18
aVJust put the term "working mother" into any Google image search engine,
p19
aVstock photo site.
p20
aVThey're all over the Internet,
p21
aVthey're topping blog posts and news pieces,
p22
aVand I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us
p23
aVand the comfort that they give us,
p24
aVthat when it comes to new working motherhood in America,
p25
aVeverything's fine.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut it's not fine.
p28
aVAs a country, we are sending millions of women back to work
p29
aVevery year, incredibly and kind of horrifically soon
p30
aVafter they give birth.
p31
aVThat's a moral problem
p32
aVbut today I'm also going to tell you why it's an economic problem.
p33
aa(lp34
VI got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images,
p35
aVwhich look nothing like my life,
p36
aVthat I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos
p37
aVthat I hoped the world would start to use
p38
aVjust showing the really awkward reality of going back to work
p39
aVwhen your baby's food source is attached to your body.
p40
aVI'm just going to show you two of them.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VNothing says "Give that girl a promotion" like leaking breast milk
p45
aVthrough your dress during a presentation.
p46
aVYou'll notice that there's no baby in this photo,
p47
aVbecause that's not how this works,
p48
aVnot for most working mothers.
p49
aa(lp50
VDid you know, and this will ruin your day,
p51
aVthat every time a toilet is flushed, its contents are aerosolized
p52
aVand they'll stay airborne for hours?
p53
aVAnd yet, for many new working mothers,
p54
aVthis is the only place during the day that they can find to make food
p55
aVfor their newborn babies.
p56
aa(lp57
VI put these things, a whole dozen of them, into the world.
p58
aVI wanted to make a point.
p59
aVI didn't know what I was also doing was opening a door,
p60
aVbecause now, total strangers from all walks of life
p61
aVwrite to me all the time
p62
aVjust to tell me what it's like for them to go back to work
p63
aVwithin days or weeks of having a baby.
p64
aVI'm going to share 10 of their stories with you today.
p65
aVThey are totally real, some of them are very raw,
p66
aVand not one of them looks anything like this.
p67
aa(lp68
VHere's the first.
p69
aV"I was an active duty service member at a federal prison.
p70
aVI returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my C-section.
p71
aVA male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on 'vacation,'
p72
aVso he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk
p73
aVand stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway."
p74
aa(lp75
VMost of the stories that these women, total strangers, send to me now,
p76
aVare not actually even about breastfeeding.
p77
aa(lp78
VA woman wrote to me to say,
p79
aV"I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks.
p80
aVEmotionally, I was a wreck.
p81
aVPhysically, I had a severe hemorrhage during labor, and major tearing,
p82
aVso I could barely get up, sit or walk.
p83
aVMy employer told me I wasn't allowed to use my available vacation days
p84
aVbecause it was budget season."
p85
aa(lp86
VI've come to believe that we can't look situations like these in the eye
p87
aVbecause then we'd be horrified,
p88
aVand if we get horrified then we have to do something about it.
p89
aVSo we choose to look at, and believe, this image.
p90
aVI don't really know what's going on in this picture,
p91
aVbecause I find it weird and slightly creepy.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VLike, what is she doing?
p96
aVBut I know what it tells us.
p97
aVIt tells us that everything's fine.
p98
aVThis working mother, all working mothers and all of their babies, are fine.
p99
aVThere's nothing to see here.
p100
aVAnd anyway, women have made a choice,
p101
aVso none of it's even our problem.
p102
aa(lp103
VI want to break this choice thing down into two parts.
p104
aVThe first choice says that women have chosen to work.
p105
aVSo, that's not true.
p106
aVToday in America, women make up 47 percent of the workforce,
p107
aVand in 40 percent of American households
p108
aVa woman is the sole or primary breadwinner.
p109
aVOur paid work is a part, a huge part, of the engine of this economy,
p110
aVand it is essential for the engines of our families.
p111
aVOn a national level, our paid work is not optional.
p112
aa(lp113
VChoice number two says that women are choosing to have babies,
p114
aVso women alone should bear the consequences of those choices.
p115
aVYou know, that's one of those things
p116
aVthat when you hear it in passing, can sound correct.
p117
aVI didn't make you have a baby.
p118
aVI certainly wasn't there when that happened.
p119
aVBut that stance ignores a fundamental truth,
p120
aVwhich is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional.
p121
aVThe babies that women, many of them working women, are having today,
p122
aVwill one day fill our workforce, protect our shores,
p123
aVmake up our tax base.
p124
aVOur procreation on a national scale is not optional.
p125
aVThese aren't choices.
p126
aVWe need women to work. We need working women to have babies.
p127
aVSo we should make doing those things at the same time
p128
aVat least palatable, right?
p129
aa(lp130
VOK, this is pop quiz time:
p131
aVwhat percentage of working women in America do you think
p132
aVhave no access to paid maternity leave?
p133
aV88 percent.
p134
aV88 percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave
p135
aVafter they have a baby.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo now you're thinking about unpaid leave.
p138
aVIt exists in America. It's called FMLA. It does not work.
p139
aVBecause of the way it's structured, all kinds of exceptions,
p140
aVhalf of new mothers are ineligible for it.
p141
aa(lp142
VHere's what that looks like.
p143
aV"We adopted our son.
p144
aVWhen I got the call, the day he was born, I had to take off work.
p145
aVI had not been there long enough to qualify for FMLA,
p146
aVso I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave.
p147
aVWhen I took time off to meet my newborn son,
p148
aVI lost my job."
p149
aa(lp150
VThese corporate stock photos hide another reality, another layer.
p151
aVOf those who do have access to just that unpaid leave,
p152
aVmost women can't afford to take much of it at all.
p153
aVA nurse told me, "I didn't qualify for short-term disability
p154
aVbecause my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition.
p155
aVWe used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings
p156
aVduring my six unpaid weeks.
p157
aVWe just couldn't manage any longer.
p158
aVPhysically it was hard, but emotionally it was worse.
p159
aVI struggled for months being away from my son."
p160
aa(lp161
VSo this decision to go back to work so early,
p162
aVit's a rational economic decision driven by family finances,
p163
aVbut it's often physically horrific
p164
aVbecause putting a human into the world is messy.
p165
aa(lp166
VA waitress told me,
p167
aV"With my first baby, I was back at work five weeks postpartum.
p168
aVWith my second, I had to have major surgery after giving birth,
p169
aVso I waited until six weeks to go back.
p170
aVI had third degree tears."
p171
aa(lp172
V23 percent of new working mothers in America
p173
aVwill be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth.
p174
aa(lp175
V"I worked as a bartender and cook, average of 75 hours a week while pregnant.
p176
aVI had to return to work before my baby was a month old,
p177
aVworking 60 hours a week.
p178
aVOne of my coworkers was only able to afford 10 days off with her baby."
p179
aa(lp180
VOf course, this isn't just a scenario with economic and physical implications.
p181
aVChildbirth is, and always will be, an enormous psychological event.
p182
aa(lp183
VA teacher told me,
p184
aV"I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born.
p185
aVI already suffer from anxiety,
p186
aVbut the panic attacks I had prior to returning to work were unbearable."
p187
aa(lp188
VStatistically speaking,
p189
aVthe shorter a woman's leave after having a baby,
p190
aVthe more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders
p191
aVlike depression and anxiety,
p192
aVand among many potential consequences of those disorders,
p193
aVsuicide is the second most common cause of death
p194
aVin a woman's first year postpartum.
p195
aa(lp196
VHeads up that this next story \u2014
p197
aVI've never met this woman, but I find it hard to get through.
p198
aa(lp199
V"I feel tremendous grief and rage that I lost an essential,
p200
aVirreplaceable and formative time with my son.
p201
aVLabor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken.
p202
aVFor months, all I remember is the screaming: colic, they said.
p203
aVOn the inside, I was drowning.
p204
aVEvery morning, I asked myself how much longer I could do it.
p205
aVI was allowed to bring my baby to work.
p206
aVI closed my office door while I rocked and shushed
p207
aVand begged him to stop screaming so I wouldn't get in trouble.
p208
aVI hid behind that office door every damn day
p209
aVand cried while he screamed.
p210
aVI cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment.
p211
aVEvery day, I cried all the way to work and all the way home again.
p212
aVI promised my boss that the work I didn't get done during the day,
p213
aVI'd make up at night from home.
p214
aVI thought, there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this."
p215
aa(lp216
VSo those are the mothers.
p217
aVWhat of the babies?
p218
aVAs a country, do we care about the millions of babies
p219
aVborn every year to working mothers?
p220
aVI say we don't,
p221
aVnot until they're of working and tax-paying and military-serving age.
p222
aVWe tell them we'll see them in 18 years,
p223
aVand getting there is kind of on them.
p224
aVOne of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers
p225
aVhave 12 or more weeks at home with them
p226
aVare more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year,
p227
aVso those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases.
p228
aVBut those things are hidden behind images like this.
p229
aa(lp230
VAmerica has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies.
p231
aVWhatever time you get together, you should be grateful for it,
p232
aVand you're an inconvenience
p233
aVto the economy and to your employers.
p234
aVThat narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories I hear.
p235
aa(lp236
VA woman told me,
p237
aV"I went back at eight weeks after my C-section
p238
aVbecause my husband was out of work.
p239
aVWithout me, my daughter had failure to thrive.
p240
aVShe wouldn't take a bottle.
p241
aVShe started losing weight.
p242
aVThankfully, my manager was very understanding.
p243
aVHe let my mom bring my baby,
p244
aVwho was on oxygen and a monitor,
p245
aVfour times a shift so I could nurse her."
p246
aa(lp247
VThere's a little club of countries in the world
p248
aVthat offer no national paid leave to new mothers.
p249
aVCare to guess who they are?
p250
aVThe first eight make up eight million in total population.
p251
aVThey are Papua New Guinea, Suriname and the tiny island nations
p252
aVof Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga.
p253
aVNumber nine is the United States of America,
p254
aVwith 320 million people.
p255
aVOh, that's it.
p256
aVThat's the end of the list.
p257
aVEvery other economy on the planet
p258
aVhas found a way to make some level of national paid leave work
p259
aVfor the people doing the work of the future of those countries,
p260
aVbut we say, "We couldn't possibly do that."
p261
aVWe say that the market will solve this problem,
p262
aVand then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women
p263
aVwho are already the highest-educated and highest-paid among us.
p264
aVRemember that 88 percent?
p265
aVThose middle- and low-income women are not going to participate in that.
p266
aVWe know that there are staggering economic, financial, physical
p267
aVand emotional costs to this approach.
p268
aVWe have decided \u2014 decided, not an accident,
p269
aVto pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies.
p270
aVWe know the price tag is higher for low-income women,
p271
aVtherefore disproportionately for women of color.
p272
aVWe pass them on anyway.
p273
aa(lp274
VAll of this is to America's shame.
p275
aVBut it's also to America's risk.
p276
aVBecause what would happen
p277
aVif all of these individual so-called choices to have babies
p278
aVstarted to turn into individual choices not to have babies.
p279
aa(lp280
VOne woman told me,
p281
aV"New motherhood is hard. It shouldn't be traumatic.
p282
aVWhen we talk about expanding our family now,
p283
aVwe focus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new baby.
p284
aVIf we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first,
p285
aVwe might stick with one kid."
p286
aa(lp287
VThe birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable
p288
aVis 2.1 live births per woman.
p289
aVIn America today, we are at 1.86.
p290
aVWe need women to have babies,
p291
aVand we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that.
p292
aVWhat would happen to work force, to innovation, to GDP,
p293
aVif one by one, the working mothers of this country were to decide
p294
aVthat they can't bear to do this thing more than once?
p295
aa(lp296
VI'm here today with only one idea worth spreading,
p297
aVand you've guessed what it is.
p298
aVIt is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth
p299
aVto offer national paid leave
p300
aVto the people doing the work of the future of this country
p301
aVand to the babies who represent that future.
p302
aVChildbirth is a public good.
p303
aVThis leave should be state-subsidized.
p304
aVIt should have no exceptions for small businesses,
p305
aVlength of employment or entrepreneurs.
p306
aVIt should be able to be shared between partners.
p307
aVI've talked today a lot about mothers,
p308
aVbut co-parents matter on so many levels.
p309
aa(lp310
VNot one more woman should have to go back to work
p311
aVwhile she is hobbling and bleeding.
p312
aVNot one more family should have to drain their savings account
p313
aVto buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding.
p314
aVNot one more fragile infant
p315
aVshould have to go directly from the incubator to day care
p316
aVbecause his parents have used up all of their meager time
p317
aVsitting in the NICU.
p318
aVNot one more working family should be told that the collision
p319
aVof their work, their needed work and their needed parenthood,
p320
aVis their problem alone.
p321
aa(lp322
VThe catch is that when this is happening to a new family, it is consuming,
p323
aVand a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable
p324
aVthan they've ever been before,
p325
aVso that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf.
p326
aVBut all of us have voices.
p327
aVI am done, done having babies,
p328
aVand you might be pre-baby,
p329
aVyou might be post-baby,
p330
aVyou might be no baby.
p331
aVIt should not matter.
p332
aVWe have to stop framing this as a mother's issue,
p333
aVor even a women's issue.
p334
aVThis is an American issue.
p335
aa(lp336
VWe need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us.
p337
aVWe need to stop being comforted by them.
p338
aVWe need to question why we're told that this can't work
p339
aVwhen we see it work everywhere all over the world.
p340
aVWe need to recognize that this American reality
p341
aVis to our dishonor and to our peril.
p342
aVBecause this is not,
p343
aVthis is not,
p344
aVand this is not what a working mother looks like.

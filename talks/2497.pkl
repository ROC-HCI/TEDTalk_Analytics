VWhen I think about dreams,
p5
aVlike many of you,
p6
aVI think about this picture.
p7
aVI was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong
p8
aVstep off the Lunar Module onto the surface of the Moon.
p9
aVI had never seen anything like it before,
p10
aVand I've never seen anything like it since.
p11
aa(lp12
VWe got to the Moon for one simple reason:
p13
aVJohn Kennedy committed us to a deadline.
p14
aVAnd in the absence of that deadline,
p15
aVwe would still be dreaming about it.
p16
aVLeonard Bernstein said two things are necessary for great achievement:
p17
aVa plan and not quite enough time.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VDeadlines and commitments
p22
aVare the great and fading lessons of Apollo.
p23
aVAnd they are what give the word "moonshot" its meaning.
p24
aVAnd our world is in desperate need of political leaders
p25
aVwilling to set bold deadlines
p26
aVfor the achievement of daring dreams on the scale of Apollo again.
p27
aa(lp28
VWhen I think about dreams,
p29
aVI think about the drag queens of LA and Stonewall
p30
aVand millions of other people risking everything
p31
aVto come out when that was really dangerous,
p32
aVand of this picture of the White House lit up in rainbow colors,
p33
aVyes \u2014
p34
aa(lp35
V(Applause) \u2014
p36
aa(lp37
Vcelebrating America's gay and lesbian citizens' right to marry.
p38
aVIt is a picture that in my wildest dreams I could never have imagined
p39
aVwhen I was 18
p40
aVand figuring out that I was gay
p41
aVand feeling estranged from my country
p42
aVand my dreams because of it.
p43
aa(lp44
VI think about this picture of my family
p45
aVthat I never dreamed I could ever have \u2014
p46
aa(lp47
V(Applause) \u2014
p48
aa(lp49
Vand of our children holding this headline
p50
aVI never dreamed could ever be printed about the Supreme Court ruling.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe need more of the courage of drag queens and astronauts.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VBut I want to talk about the need for us to dream
p59
aVin more than one dimension,
p60
aVbecause there was something about Apollo that I didn't know when I was 8,
p61
aVand something about organizing that the rainbow colors over.
p62
aVOf the 30 astronauts in the original Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,
p63
aVonly seven marriages survived.
p64
aVThose iconic images of the astronauts bouncing on the Moon
p65
aVobscure the alcoholism and depression on Earth.
p66
aa(lp67
VThomas Merton, the Trappist monk,
p68
aVasked during the time of Apollo,
p69
aV"What can we gain by sailing to the moon
p70
aVif we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves?"
p71
aVAnd what can we gain by the right to marry
p72
aVif we are not able to cross the acrimony
p73
aVand emotional distance that so often separates us from our love?
p74
aVAnd not just in marriage.
p75
aVI have seen the most hurtful, destructive,
p76
aVtragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS
p77
aVand breast cancer and non-profit activism,
p78
aVall in the name of love.
p79
aa(lp80
VThomas Merton also wrote about wars among saints
p81
aVand that "there is a pervasive form of contemporary violence
p82
aVto which the idealist most easily succumbs:
p83
aVactivism and overwork.
p84
aVThe frenzy of our activism neutralizes our work for peace.
p85
aVIt destroys our own inner capacity for peace."
p86
aVToo often our dreams become these compartmentalized fixations
p87
aVon some future
p88
aVthat destroy our ability to be present for our lives right now.
p89
aVOur dreams of a better life for some future humanity
p90
aVor some other humanity in another country
p91
aValienate us from the beautiful human beings sitting next to us
p92
aVat this very moment.
p93
aa(lp94
VWell, that's just the price of progress, we say.
p95
aVYou can go to the Moon
p96
aVor you can have stability in your family life.
p97
aVAnd we can't conceive of dreaming in both dimensions at the same time.
p98
aVAnd we don't set the bar much higher than stability
p99
aVwhen it comes to our emotional life.
p100
aVWhich is why our technology for talking to one another
p101
aVhas gone vertical,
p102
aVour ability to listen and understand one another
p103
aVhas gone nowhere.
p104
aVOur access to information is through the roof,
p105
aVour access to joy, grounded.
p106
aVBut this idea, that our present and our future are mutually exclusive,
p107
aVthat to fulfill our potential for doing we have to surrender
p108
aVour profound potential for being,
p109
aVthat the number of transistors on a circuit can be doubled and doubled,
p110
aVbut our capacity for compassion and humanity and serenity and love
p111
aVis somehow limited
p112
aVis a false and suffocating choice.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, I'm not suggesting
p115
aVsimply the uninspiring idea of more work-life balance.
p116
aVWhat good is it for me to spend more time with my kids at home
p117
aVif my mind is always somewhere else while I'm doing it?
p118
aVI'm not even talking about mindfulness.
p119
aVMindfulness is all of a sudden becoming a tool for improving productivity.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VRight?
p124
aa(lp125
VI'm talking about dreaming
p126
aVas boldly in the dimension of our being
p127
aVas we do about industry and technology.
p128
aVI'm talking about an audacious authenticity
p129
aVthat allows us to cry with one another,
p130
aVa heroic humility that allows us to remove our masks and be real.
p131
aVIt is our inability to be with one another,
p132
aVour fear of crying with one another, that gives rise to so many
p133
aVof the problems we are frantically trying to solve in the first place,
p134
aVfrom Congressional gridlock to economic inhumanity.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Applause)
p137
aa(lp138
VI'm talking about what Jonas Salk called an Epoch B,
p139
aVa new epoch in which we become as excited about and curious about
p140
aVand scientific about the development of our humanity
p141
aVas we are about the development of our technology.
p142
aa(lp143
VWe should not shrink from this opportunity
p144
aVsimply because we don't really understand it.
p145
aVThere was a time when we didn't understand space.
p146
aVOr because we're more used to technology and activism.
p147
aVThat is the very definition of being stuck in a comfort zone.
p148
aVWe are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement.
p149
aVIn 2016, it is the dimension of our being itself
p150
aVthat cries out for its fair share of our imagination.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, we're all here to dream,
p153
aVbut maybe if we're honest about it,
p154
aVeach of us chasing our own dream.
p155
aVYou know, looking at the name tags to see who can help me with my dream,
p156
aVsometimes looking right through one another's humanity.
p157
aVI can't be bothered with you right now. I have an idea for saving the world.
p158
aVRight?
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VYears ago, once upon a time, I had this beautiful company
p163
aVthat created these long journeys for heroic civic engagement.
p164
aVAnd we had this mantra:
p165
aV"Human. Kind. Be Both."
p166
aVAnd we encouraged people to experiment outrageously with kindness.
p167
aVLike, "Go help everybody set up their tents."
p168
aVAnd there were a lot of tents.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
V"Go buy everybody Popsicles."
p173
aV"Go help people fix their flat tires
p174
aVeven though you know the dinner line is going to get longer."
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd people really took us up on this,
p177
aVso much so that if you got a flat tire on the AIDS ride,
p178
aVyou had trouble fixing it, because there were so many people there asking you
p179
aVif you needed help.
p180
aa(lp181
VFor a few days, for tens of thousands of people,
p182
aVwe created these worlds
p183
aVthat everybody said were the way they wish the world could always be.
p184
aVWhat if we experimented with creating that kind of world
p185
aVthese next few days?
p186
aVAnd instead of going up to someone and asking them, "What do you do?"
p187
aVask them, "So what are your dreams?"
p188
aVor "What are your broken dreams?"
p189
aVYou know, "TED." Tend to Each other's Dreams.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VMaybe it's "I want to stay sober"
p194
aVor "I want to build a tree house with my kid."
p195
aVYou know, instead of going up to the person everybody wants to meet,
p196
aVgo up to the person who is all alone
p197
aVand ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee.
p198
aa(lp199
VI think what we fear most
p200
aVis that we will be denied the opportunity to fulfill our true potential,
p201
aVthat we are born to dream
p202
aVand we might die without ever having the chance.
p203
aa(lp204
VImagine living in a world
p205
aVwhere we simply recognize that deep, existential fear in one another
p206
aVand love one another boldly because we know
p207
aVthat to be human is to live with that fear.
p208
aVIt's time for us to dream in multiple dimensions simultaneously,
p209
aVand somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things
p210
aVwe can and will and must do
p211
aVlies the domain of all the unbelievable things we could be.
p212
aa(lp213
VIt's time we set foot into that dimension
p214
aVand came out about the fact that we have dreams there, too.
p215
aVIf the Moon could dream,
p216
aVI think that would be its dream for us.
p217
aVIt's an honor to be with you.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you very much.

VFor emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert.
p5
aVSo, first, a small housekeeping announcement:
p6
aVplease switch off your
p7
aVproper English check programs
p8
aVinstalled in your brain.
p9
aV(Applause)
p10
aa(lp11
VSo, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.
p12
aVIt receives the least rainfall in the country,
p13
aVlowest rainfall.
p14
aVIf you are well-versed with inches, nine inches,
p15
aVcentimeters, 16 [centimeters].
p16
aVThe groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.
p17
aVAnd in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.
p18
aVSo, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells,
p19
aVthough there is no electricity in most of the villages.
p20
aVBut suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps \u2014
p21
aVthey are of no use in this area.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, welcome to the Golden Desert.
p24
aVClouds seldom visit this area.
p25
aVBut we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.
p26
aVThere are a number of techniques to harvest rain.
p27
aVThis is a new work, it's a new program.
p28
aVBut for the desert society
p29
aVthis is no program; this is their life.
p30
aVAnd they harvest rain in many ways.
p31
aVSo, this is the first device they use
p32
aVin harvesting rain.
p33
aVIt's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd you can notice they have created
p36
aVa kind of false catchment.
p37
aVThe desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.
p38
aVAnd this is all big raised platform.
p39
aVYou can notice the small holes
p40
aVthe water will fall on this catchment,
p41
aVand there is a slope.
p42
aVSometimes our engineers and architects
p43
aVdo not care about slopes in bathrooms,
p44
aVbut here they will care properly.
p45
aVAnd the water will go where it should go.
p46
aVAnd then it is 40 feet deep.
p47
aVThe waterproofing is done perfectly,
p48
aVbetter than our city contractors,
p49
aVbecause not a single drop should go waste in this.
p50
aa(lp51
VThey collect 100 thousand liters in one season.
p52
aVAnd this is pure drinking water.
p53
aVBelow the surface there is hard saline water.
p54
aVBut now you can have this for year round.
p55
aVIt's two houses.
p56
aVWe often use a term called bylaws.
p57
aVBecause we are used to get written things.
p58
aVBut here it is unwritten by law.
p59
aVAnd people made their house,
p60
aVand the water storage tanks.
p61
aVThese raised up platforms just like this stage.
p62
aVIn fact they go 15 feet deep,
p63
aVand collect rain water from roof,
p64
aVthere is a small pipe, and from their courtyard.
p65
aVIt can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnother big one,
p68
aVthis is of course out of the hardcore desert area.
p69
aVThis is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort.
p70
aVAnd it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.
p71
aVThe age is 400 years.
p72
aVSo, since 400 years it has been giving you
p73
aValmost six million gallons of water per season.
p74
aVYou can calculate the price of that water.
p75
aVIt draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.
p76
aa(lp77
VYou can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.
p78
aVIt can break sometimes.
p79
aVBut this 400 year old canal, which draws water,
p80
aVit is maintained for so many generations.
p81
aVOf course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.
p82
aVBut they can be opened for TED people.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd we request them.
p85
aVYou can see person coming up with
p86
aVtwo canisters of water.
p87
aVAnd the water level \u2014 these are not empty canisters \u2014
p88
aVwater level is right up to this.
p89
aVIt can envy many municipalities,
p90
aVthe color, the taste, the purity of this water.
p91
aVAnd this is what they call Zero B type of water,
p92
aVbecause it comes from the clouds,
p93
aVpure distilled water.
p94
aa(lp95
VWe stop for a quick commercial break,
p96
aVand then we come back to the traditional systems.
p97
aVThe government thought that this is a very
p98
aVbackward area and we should bring
p99
aVa multi-million dollar project
p100
aVto bring water from the Himalayas.
p101
aVThat's why I said that this is a commercial break.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVBut we will come back, once again,
p104
aVto the traditional thing.
p105
aVSo, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,
p106
aVsoon it become like this.
p107
aVIn many portions, water hyacinth
p108
aVcovered these big canals like anything.
p109
aa(lp110
VOf course there are some areas where water is reaching,
p111
aVI'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.
p112
aVBut the tail end, the Jaisalmer area,
p113
aVyou will notice in Bikaner things like this:
p114
aVwhere the water hyacinth couldn't grow,
p115
aVthe sand is flowing in these canals.
p116
aVThe bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VWe had full-page advertisements,
p120
aVsome 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.
p121
aVThey said that throw away your traditional systems,
p122
aVthese new cement tanks will supply you piped water.
p123
aVIt's a dream. And it became a dream also.
p124
aVBecause soon the water was not able to reach these areas.
p125
aVAnd people started renovating their own structures.
p126
aa(lp127
VThese are all traditional water structures,
p128
aVwhich we won't be able to explain in such a short time.
p129
aVBut you can see that no woman is standing on those.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVAnd they are plaiting hair.
p132
aV(Applause)
p133
aVJaisalmer. This is heart of desert.
p134
aVThis town was established 800 years ago.
p135
aVI'm not sure by that time
p136
aVBombay was there, or Delhi was there,
p137
aVor Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo, this was the terminal point for silk route.
p140
aVWell connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.
p141
aVNone of us were able to go to Europe,
p142
aVbut Jaisalmer was well connected to it.
p143
aVAnd this is the 16 centimeter area.
p144
aVSuch a limited rainfall,
p145
aVand highest colorful life flourished in these areas.
p146
aVYou won't find water in this slide.
p147
aVBut it is invisible.
p148
aVSomewhere a stream or a rivulet
p149
aVis running through here.
p150
aVOr, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout
p151
aVbecause every roof which you see in this picture
p152
aVcollects rainwater drops
p153
aVand deposit in the rooms.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut apart from this system,
p156
aVthey designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.
p157
aVAnd what we call private public partnership
p158
aVyou can add estate also.
p159
aVSo, estate, public and private entrepreneurs
p160
aVwork together to build this beautiful water body.
p161
aVAnd it's a kind of water body for all seasons.
p162
aVYou will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year.
p163
aVWhether water level goes up or down,
p164
aVthe beauty is there throughout.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnother water body, dried up, of course,
p167
aVduring the summer period,
p168
aVbut you can see how the traditional society
p169
aVcombines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.
p170
aVThese statues, marvelous statues,
p171
aVgives you an idea of water table.
p172
aVWhen this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank,
p173
aVit will submerge these beautiful statues
p174
aVin what we call in English today "mass communication."
p175
aVThis was for mass communication.
p176
aVEverybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned,
p177
aVso water will be there for seven months or nine months,
p178
aVor 12 months.
p179
aVAnd then they will come and worship this pond,
p180
aVpay respect, their gratitude.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnother small water body, called the [unclear].
p183
aVIt is difficult to translate in English,
p184
aVespecially in my English.
p185
aVBut the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.
p186
aVThe reputation in desert of this small water body is
p187
aVthat it never dries up.
p188
aVIn severe drought periods
p189
aVnobody has seen this water body
p190
aVgetting dried up.
p191
aVAnd perhaps they knew the future also.
p192
aVIt was designed some 150 years ago.
p193
aVBut perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009,
p194
aVthere will be a TED green and blue session,
p195
aVso they painted it like this.
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aV(Applause)
p198
aa(lp199
VDry water body. Children are standing on
p200
aVa very difficult device to explain.
p201
aVThis is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water.
p202
aVBut this is not ground water.
p203
aVYou can draw ground water from any well.
p204
aVBut this is no ordinary well.
p205
aVIt squeeze the moisture
p206
aVhidden in the sand.
p207
aVAnd they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear].
p208
aVAnd there is a gypsum belt running below it.
p209
aVAnd it was deposited by the great mother Earth,
p210
aVsome three million years ago.
p211
aVAnd where we have this gypsum strip
p212
aVthey can harvest this water.
p213
aa(lp214
VThis is the same dry water body.
p215
aVNow, you don't find any kund;
p216
aVthey are all submerged.
p217
aVBut when the water goes down they will be able
p218
aVto draw water from those structures throughout the year.
p219
aVThis year they have received only six centimeters.
p220
aVSix centimeter of rainfall,
p221
aVand they can telephone you
p222
aVthat if you find any water problem in your city,
p223
aVDelhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore,
p224
aVplease come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VHow they maintain them?
p228
aVThere are three things: concept, planning,
p229
aVmaking the actual thing, and also maintaining them.
p230
aVIt is a structure for maintain,
p231
aVfor centuries, by generations, without any department,
p232
aVwithout any funding,
p233
aVSo the secret is "[unclear]," respect.
p234
aVYour own thing, not personal property,
p235
aVmy property, every time.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo, these stone pillars
p238
aVwill remind you that you are entering into a water body area.
p239
aVDon't spit, don't do anything wrong,
p240
aVso that the clean water can be collected.
p241
aVAnother pillar, stone pillar on your right side.
p242
aVIf you climb these three, six steps
p243
aVyou will find something very nice.
p244
aVThis was done in 11th century.
p245
aVAnd you have to go further down.
p246
aVThey say that a picture is worth a thousand words,
p247
aVso we can say a thousand words right now,
p248
aVan another thousand words.
p249
aVIf the water table goes down,
p250
aVyou will find new stairs.
p251
aVIf it comes up, some of them will be submerged.
p252
aVSo, throughout the year
p253
aVthis beautiful system will give you some pleasure.
p254
aVThree sides, such steps, on the fourth side
p255
aVthere is a four-story building
p256
aVwhere you can organize such TED conferences anytime.
p257
aV(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
VExcuse me, who built these structures?
p260
aVThey are in front of you.
p261
aVThe best civil engineers we had, the best planners,
p262
aVthe best architects.
p263
aVWe can say that because of them,
p264
aVbecause of their forefathers,
p265
aVIndia could get the first engineering college
p266
aVin 1847.
p267
aVThere were no English medium schools at that time,
p268
aVeven no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.
p269
aVBut such people, compelled to the East India Company,
p270
aVwhich came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aVbut not to create the engineering colleges.
p273
aVBut because of them, first engineering college was created
p274
aVin a small village, not in the town.
p275
aa(lp276
VThe last point, we all know in our primary schools that
p277
aVthat camel is a ship of desert.
p278
aVSo, you can find through your Jeep,
p279
aVa camel, and a cart.
p280
aVThis tire comes from the airplane.
p281
aVSo, look at the beauty from the desert society
p282
aVwho can harvest rainwater,
p283
aVand also create something
p284
aVthrough a tire from a jet plane,
p285
aVand used in a camel cart.
p286
aa(lp287
VLast picture, it's a tattoo,
p288
aV2,000-years-old tattoo.
p289
aVThey were using it on their body.
p290
aVTattoo was, at one time,
p291
aVa kind of a blacklisted
p292
aVor con thing, but now it is in thing.
p293
aV(Laughter)
p294
aV(Applause)
p295
aVYou can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.
p296
aV(Laughter)
p297
aVThe center of life is water.
p298
aVThese are the beautiful waves.
p299
aVThese are the beautiful stairs
p300
aVwhich we just saw in one of the slides.
p301
aVThese are the trees.
p302
aVAnd these are the flowers which
p303
aVadd fragrance to our lives.
p304
aVSo, this is the message of desert.
p305
aVThank you very much.
p306
aV(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VChris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.
p309
aV(Applause)
p310
aVThese artifacts and designs are inspiring.
p311
aVDo you believe that they can be used elsewhere,
p312
aVthat the world can learn from this?
p313
aVOr is this just right for this place?
p314
aa(lp315
VAnupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to
p316
aVutilize water that falls on our area.
p317
aVSo, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere,
p318
aVright from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.
p319
aVAnd these [unclear], which stored water,
p320
aVthere are two type of things.
p321
aVOne recharge, and one stores.
p322
aVSo, it depends on the terrain.
p323
aVBut kund, which uses the gypsum belt,
p324
aVfor that you have to go back to your calendar,
p325
aVthree million years ago.
p326
aVIf it is there it can be done right now.
p327
aVOtherwise, it can't be done.
p328
aV(Laughter)
p329
aV(Applause)
p330
aa(lp331
VCA: Thank you so much.

VI've learned some of my most important life lessons
p5
aVfrom drug dealers
p6
aVand gang members
p7
aVand prostitutes,
p8
aVand I've had some of my most profound theological conversations
p9
aVnot in the hallowed halls of a seminary
p10
aVbut on a street corner
p11
aVon a Friday night, at 1 a.m.
p12
aa(lp13
VThat's a little unusual, since I am a Baptist minister, seminary-trained,
p14
aVand pastored a church for over 20 years,
p15
aVbut it's true.
p16
aVIt came as a part of my participation
p17
aVin a public safety crime reduction strategy
p18
aVthat saw a 79 percent reduction in violent crime
p19
aVover an eight-year period in a major city.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut I didn't start out wanting to be
p22
aVa part of somebody's crime reduction strategy.
p23
aVI was 25, had my first church.
p24
aVIf you would have asked me what my ambition was,
p25
aVI would have told you I wanted to be a megachurch pastor.
p26
aVI wanted a 15-, 20,000-member church.
p27
aVI wanted my own television ministry.
p28
aVI wanted my own clothing line.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVI wanted to be your long distance carrier.
p31
aVYou know, the whole nine yards.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VAfter about a year of pastoring,
p35
aVmy membership went up about 20 members.
p36
aVSo megachurchdom was way down the road.
p37
aVBut seriously, if you'd have said, "What is your ambition?"
p38
aVI would have said just to be a good pastor,
p39
aVto be able to be with people through all the passages of life,
p40
aVto preach messages that would have an everyday meaning for folks,
p41
aVand in the African-American tradition,
p42
aVto be able to represent the community that I serve.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut there was something else that was happening in my city
p45
aVand in the entire metro area,
p46
aVand in most metro areas in the United States,
p47
aVand that was the homicide rate started to rise precipitously.
p48
aVAnd there were young people who were killing each other
p49
aVfor reasons that I thought were very trivial,
p50
aVlike bumping into someone in a high school hallway,
p51
aVand then after school, shooting the person.
p52
aVSomeone with the wrong color shirt on,
p53
aVon the wrong street corner at the wrong time.
p54
aVAnd something needed to be done about that.
p55
aVIt got to the point where it started to change the character of the city.
p56
aVYou could go to any housing project,
p57
aVfor example, like the one that was down the street from my church,
p58
aVand you would walk in, and it would be like a ghost town,
p59
aVbecause the parents wouldn't allow their kids to come out and play,
p60
aVeven in the summertime, because of the violence.
p61
aVYou would listen in the neighborhoods on any given night,
p62
aVand to the untrained ear, it sounded like fireworks,
p63
aVbut it was gunfire.
p64
aVYou'd hear it almost every night, when you were cooking dinner,
p65
aVtelling your child a bedtime story, or just watching TV.
p66
aVAnd you can go to any emergency room at any hospital,
p67
aVand you would see lying on gurneys
p68
aVyoung black and Latino men shot and dying.
p69
aVAnd I was doing funerals,
p70
aVbut not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs who'd lived a long life
p71
aVand there's a lot to say.
p72
aVI was doing funerals of 18-year-olds,
p73
aV17-year-olds,
p74
aVand 16-year-olds,
p75
aVand I was standing in a church or at a funeral home
p76
aVstruggling to say something
p77
aVthat would make some meaningful impact.
p78
aVAnd so while my colleagues were building these cathedrals great and tall
p79
aVand buying property outside of the city
p80
aVand moving their congregations out
p81
aVso that they could create or recreate their cities of God,
p82
aVthe social structures in the inner cities
p83
aVwere sagging under the weight of all of this violence.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd so I stayed, because somebody needed to do something,
p86
aVand so I had looked at what I had and moved on that.
p87
aVI started to preach decrying the violence in the community.
p88
aVAnd I started to look at the programming in my church,
p89
aVand I started to build programs that would catch the at-risk youth,
p90
aVthose who were on the fence to the violence.
p91
aVI even tried to be innovative in my preaching.
p92
aVYou all have heard of rap music, right?
p93
aVRap music?
p94
aVI even tried to rap sermon one time.
p95
aVIt didn't work, but at least I tried it.
p96
aVI'll never forget the young person who came to me after that sermon.
p97
aVHe waited until everybody was gone,
p98
aVand he said, "Rev, rap sermon, huh?" And I was like, "Yeah, what do you think?"
p99
aVAnd he said, "Don't do that again, Rev."
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VBut I preached and I built these programs,
p103
aVand I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same
p104
aVthat it would make a difference.
p105
aVBut the violence just careened out of control,
p106
aVand people who were not involved in the violence were getting shot and killed:
p107
aVsomebody going to buy a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store,
p108
aVor someone who was sitting at a bus stop just waiting for a bus,
p109
aVor kids who were playing in the park,
p110
aVoblivious to the violence on the other side of the park,
p111
aVbut it coming and visiting them.
p112
aVThings were out of control,
p113
aVand I didn't know what to do,
p114
aVand then something happened that changed everything for me.
p115
aVIt was a kid by the name of Jesse McKie,
p116
aVwalking home with his friend Rigoberto Carrion
p117
aVto the housing project down the street from my church.
p118
aVThey met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dorchester,
p119
aVand they were killed.
p120
aVBut as Jesse was running from the scene mortally wounded,
p121
aVhe was running in the direction of my church,
p122
aVand he died some 100, 150 yards away.
p123
aVIf he would have gotten to the church, it wouldn't have made a difference,
p124
aVbecause the lights were out; nobody was home.
p125
aVAnd I took that as a sign.
p126
aVWhen they caught some of the youth that had done this deed,
p127
aVto my surprise, they were around my age,
p128
aVbut the gulf that was between us was vast.
p129
aVIt was like we were in two completely different worlds.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd so as I contemplated all of this
p132
aVand looked at what was happening,
p133
aVI suddenly realized that there was a paradox that was emerging inside of me,
p134
aVand the paradox was this: in all of those sermons
p135
aVthat I preached decrying the violence,
p136
aVI was also talking about building community,
p137
aVbut I suddenly realized
p138
aVthat there was a certain segment of the population
p139
aVthat I was not including in my definition of community.
p140
aVAnd so the paradox was this:
p141
aVIf I really wanted the community that I was preaching for,
p142
aVI needed to reach out
p143
aVand embrace this group that I had cut out of my definition.
p144
aVWhich meant not about building programs
p145
aVto catch those who were on the fences of violence,
p146
aVbut to reach out and to embrace those who were committing the acts of violence,
p147
aVthe gang bangers, the drug dealers.
p148
aa(lp149
VAs soon as I came to that realization, a quick question came to my mind.
p150
aVWhy me?
p151
aVI mean, isn't this a law enforcement issue?
p152
aVThis is why we have the police, right?
p153
aVAs soon as the question, "Why me?" came, the answer came just as quickly:
p154
aVWhy me? Because I'm the one who can't sleep at night thinking about it.
p155
aVBecause I'm the one looking around saying somebody needs to do something about this,
p156
aVand I'm starting to realize that that someone is me.
p157
aVI mean, isn't that how movements start anyway?
p158
aVThey don't start with a grand convention and people coming together
p159
aVand then walking in lockstep with a statement.
p160
aVBut it starts with just a few, or maybe just one.
p161
aa(lp162
VIt started with me that way,
p163
aVand so I decided to figure out the culture of violence
p164
aVin which these young people who were committing them existed,
p165
aVand I started to volunteer at the high school.
p166
aVAfter about two weeks of volunteering at the high school,
p167
aVI realized that the youth that I was trying to reach,
p168
aVthey weren't going to high school.
p169
aVI started to walk in the community,
p170
aVand it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't out
p171
aVduring the day.
p172
aVSo I started to walk the streets at night, late at night,
p173
aVgoing into the parks where they were,
p174
aVbuilding the relationship that was necessary.
p175
aa(lp176
VA tragedy happened in Boston that brought a number of clergy together,
p177
aVand there was a small cadre of us who came to the realization
p178
aVthat we had to come out of the four walls of our sanctuary
p179
aVand meet the youth where they were,
p180
aVand not try to figure out how to bring them in.
p181
aVAnd so we decided to walk together,
p182
aVand we would get together
p183
aVin one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city
p184
aVon a Friday night and on a Saturday night
p185
aVat 10 p.m.,
p186
aVand we would walk until 2 or 3 in the morning.
p187
aVI imagine we were quite the anomaly when we first started walking.
p188
aVI mean, we weren't drug dealers.
p189
aVWe weren't drug customers.
p190
aVWe weren't the police. Some of us would have collars on.
p191
aVIt was probably a really odd thing.
p192
aVBut they started speaking to us after a while,
p193
aVand what we found out is that
p194
aVwhile we were walking, they were watching us,
p195
aVand they wanted to make sure of a couple of things:
p196
aVthat number one, we were going to be consistent in our behavior,
p197
aVthat we would keep coming out there;
p198
aVand then secondly, they had wanted to make sure
p199
aVthat we weren't out there to exploit them.
p200
aVBecause there was always somebody who would say,
p201
aV"We're going to take back the streets,"
p202
aVbut they would always seem to have a television camera with them,
p203
aVor a reporter,
p204
aVand they would enhance their own reputation
p205
aVto the detriment of those on the streets.
p206
aVSo when they saw that we had none of that,
p207
aVthey decided to talk to us.
p208
aVAnd then we did an amazing thing for preachers.
p209
aVWe decided to listen and not preach.
p210
aVCome on, give it up for me.
p211
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p212
aVAll right, come on, you're cutting into my time now, okay? (Laughter)
p213
aVBut it was amazing.
p214
aVWe said to them, "We don't know our own communities after 9 p.m. at night,
p215
aVbetween 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.,
p216
aVbut you do.
p217
aVYou are the subject matter experts, if you will, of that period of time.
p218
aVSo talk to us. Teach us.
p219
aVHelp us to see what we're not seeing.
p220
aVHelp us to understand what we're not understanding."
p221
aVAnd they were all too happy to do that,
p222
aVand we got an idea of what life on the streets was all about,
p223
aVvery different than what you see on the 11 o'clock news,
p224
aVvery different than what is portrayed in popular media and even social media.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd as we were talking with them,
p227
aVa number of myths were dispelled about them with us.
p228
aVAnd one of the biggest myths was that these kids were cold and heartless
p229
aVand uncharacteristically bold in their violence.
p230
aVWhat we found out was the exact opposite.
p231
aVMost of the young people who were out there on the streets
p232
aVare just trying to make it on the streets.
p233
aVAnd we also found out
p234
aVthat some of the most intelligent and creative
p235
aVand magnificent and wise
p236
aVpeople that we've ever met
p237
aVwere on the street, engaged in a struggle.
p238
aVAnd I know some of them call it survival, but I call them overcomers,
p239
aVbecause when you're in the conditions that they're in,
p240
aVto be able to live every day is an accomplishment of overcoming.
p241
aVAnd as a result of that, we said to them,
p242
aV"How do you see this church, how do you see this institution
p243
aVhelping this situation?"
p244
aVAnd we developed a plan in conversation with these youths.
p245
aVWe stopped looking at them as the problem to be solved,
p246
aVand we started looking at them as partners, as assets,
p247
aVas co-laborers in the struggle to reduce violence in the community.
p248
aVImagine developing a plan,
p249
aVyou have one minister at one table and a heroin dealer at the other table,
p250
aVcoming up with a way in which the church can help the entire community.
p251
aa(lp252
VThe Boston Miracle was about bringing people together.
p253
aVWe had other partners.
p254
aVWe had law enforcement partners.
p255
aVWe had police officers.
p256
aVIt wasn't the entire force,
p257
aVbecause there were still some who still had that lock-'em-up mentality,
p258
aVbut there were other cops
p259
aVwho saw the honor in partnering with the community,
p260
aVwho saw the responsibility from themselves
p261
aVto be able to work as partners with community leaders and faith leaders
p262
aVin order to reduce violence in the community.
p263
aVSame with probation officers,
p264
aVsame with judges,
p265
aVsame with folks who were up that law enforcement chain,
p266
aVbecause they realized, like we did,
p267
aVthat we'll never arrest ourselves out of this situation,
p268
aVthat there will not be enough prosecutions made,
p269
aVand you cannot fill these jails up enough
p270
aVin order to alleviate the problem.
p271
aVI helped to start an organization
p272
aV20 years ago, a faith-based organization, to deal with this issue.
p273
aVI left it about four years ago
p274
aVand started working in cities across the United States,
p275
aV19 in total,
p276
aVand what I found out was that in those cities,
p277
aVthere was always this component of community leaders
p278
aVwho put their heads down and their nose to the grindstone,
p279
aVwho checked their egos at the door
p280
aVand saw the whole as greater than the sum of its parts,
p281
aVand came together and found ways to work with youth out on the streets,
p282
aVthat the solution is not more cops,
p283
aVbut the solution is mining the assets that are there in the community,
p284
aVto have a strong community component
p285
aVin the collaboration around violence reduction.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, there is a movement in the United States
p288
aVof young people who I am very proud of who are dealing with the structural issues
p289
aVthat need to change if we're going to be a better society.
p290
aVBut there is this political ploy to try to pit police brutality
p291
aVand police misconduct against black-on-black violence.
p292
aVBut it's a fiction.
p293
aVIt's all connected.
p294
aVWhen you think about decades of failed housing policies
p295
aVand poor educational structures,
p296
aVwhen you think about persistent unemployment
p297
aVand underemployment in a community,
p298
aVwhen you think about poor healthcare,
p299
aVand then you throw drugs into the mix
p300
aVand duffel bags full of guns,
p301
aVlittle wonder that you would see this culture of violence emerge.
p302
aVAnd then the response that comes from the state is more cops
p303
aVand more suppression of hot spots.
p304
aVIt's all connected,
p305
aVand one of the wonderful things that we've been able to do
p306
aVis to be able to show the value of partnering together \u2014
p307
aVcommunity, law enforcement, private sector, the city \u2014
p308
aVin order to reduce violence.
p309
aVYou have to value that community component.
p310
aa(lp311
VI believe that we can end the era of violence in our cities.
p312
aVI believe that it is possible and that people are doing it even now.
p313
aVBut I need your help.
p314
aVIt can't just come from folks who are burning themselves out
p315
aVin the community.
p316
aVThey need support. They need help.
p317
aVGo back to your city.
p318
aVFind those people.
p319
aV"You need some help? I'll help you out."
p320
aVFind those people. They're there.
p321
aVBring them together with law enforcement, the private sector, and the city,
p322
aVwith the one aim of reducing violence,
p323
aVbut make sure that that community component is strong.
p324
aVBecause the old adage that comes from Burundi is right:
p325
aVthat you do for me, without me, you do to me.
p326
aa(lp327
VGod bless you. Thank you.

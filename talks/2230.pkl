VI'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft.
p5
aVTo escort and land the probe on a comet,
p6
aVthis has been my passion for the past two years.
p7
aVIn order to do that,
p8
aVI need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system.
p9
aa(lp10
VWhen we go back four and a half billion years,
p11
aVthere was a cloud of gas and dust.
p12
aVIn the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited.
p13
aVAlong with that, what we now know as planets, comets and asteroids formed.
p14
aVWhat then happened, according to theory,
p15
aVis that when the Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation,
p16
aVcomets massively impacted the Earth and delivered water to Earth.
p17
aVThey probably also delivered complex organic material to Earth,
p18
aVand that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life.
p19
aVYou can compare this to having to solve a 250-piece puzzle
p20
aVand not a 2,000-piece puzzle.
p21
aa(lp22
VAfterwards, the big planets like Jupiter and Saturn,
p23
aVthey were not in their place where they are now,
p24
aVand they interacted gravitationally,
p25
aVand they swept the whole interior of the solar system clean,
p26
aVand what we now know as comets
p27
aVended up in something called the Kuiper Belt,
p28
aVwhich is a belt of objects beyond the orbit of Neptune.
p29
aVAnd sometimes these objects run into each other,
p30
aVand they gravitationally deflect,
p31
aVand then the gravity of Jupiter pulls them back into the solar system.
p32
aVAnd they then become the comets as we see them in the sky.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe important thing here to note is that in the meantime,
p35
aVthe four and a half billion years,
p36
aVthese comets have been sitting on the outside of the solar system,
p37
aVand haven't changed \u2014
p38
aVdeep, frozen versions of our solar system.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn the sky, they look like this.
p41
aVWe know them for their tails.
p42
aVThere are actually two tails.
p43
aVOne is a dust tail, which is blown away by the solar wind.
p44
aVThe other one is an ion tail, which is charged particles,
p45
aVand they follow the magnetic field in the solar system.
p46
aVThere's the coma,
p47
aVand then there is the nucleus, which here is too small to see,
p48
aVand you have to remember that in the case of Rosetta,
p49
aVthe spacecraft is in that center pixel.
p50
aVWe are only 20, 30, 40 kilometers away from the comet.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo what's important to remember?
p53
aVComets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed,
p54
aVso they're ideal to study the components
p55
aVthat were present at the time  when Earth, and life, started.
p56
aVComets are also suspected
p57
aVof having brought the elements which may have bootstrapped life.
p58
aVIn 1983, ESA set up its long-term Horizon 2000 program,
p59
aVwhich contained one cornerstone, which would be a mission to a comet.
p60
aVIn parallel, a small mission to a comet, what you see here, Giotto, was launched,
p61
aVand in 1986, flew by the comet of Halley with an armada of other spacecraft.
p62
aVFrom the results of that mission, it became immediately clear
p63
aVthat comets were ideal bodies to study to understand our solar system.
p64
aVAnd thus, the Rosetta mission was approved in 1993,
p65
aVand originally it was supposed to be launched in 2003,
p66
aVbut a problem arose with an Ariane rocket.
p67
aVHowever, our P.R. department, in its enthusiasm,
p68
aVhad already made 1,000 Delft Blue plates
p69
aVwith the name of the wrong comets.
p70
aVSo I've never had to buy any china since. That's the positive part.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VOnce the whole problem was solved,
p74
aVwe left Earth in 2004
p75
aVto the newly selected comet, Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
p76
aVThis comet had to be specially selected
p77
aVbecause A, you have to be able to get to it,
p78
aVand B, it shouldn't have been in the solar system too long.
p79
aVThis particular comet has been  in the solar system since 1959.
p80
aVThat's the first time when it was deflected by Jupiter,
p81
aVand it got close enough to the sun to start changing.
p82
aVSo it's a very fresh comet.
p83
aa(lp84
VRosetta made a few historic firsts.
p85
aVIt's the first satellite to orbit a comet,
p86
aVand to escort it throughout its whole tour through the solar system \u2014
p87
aVclosest approach to the sun, as we will see in August,
p88
aVand then away again to the exterior.
p89
aVIt's the first ever landing on a comet.
p90
aVWe actually orbit the comet using something which is not
p91
aVnormally done with spacecraft.
p92
aVNormally, you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are.
p93
aVIn this case, that's not enough.
p94
aVWe navigated by looking at landmarks on the comet.
p95
aVWe recognized features \u2014 boulders, craters \u2014
p96
aVand that's how we know where we are respective to the comet.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd, of course, it's the first satellite to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter
p99
aVon solar cells.
p100
aVNow, this sounds more heroic than it actually is,
p101
aVbecause the technology to use radio isotope thermal generators
p102
aVwasn't available in Europe at that time, so there was no choice.
p103
aVBut these solar arrays are big.
p104
aVThis is one wing, and these are not specially selected small people.
p105
aVThey're just like you and me.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVWe have two of these wings, 65 square meters.
p108
aVNow later on, of course, when we got to the comet,
p109
aVyou find out that 65 square meters of sail
p110
aVclose to a body which is outgassing is not always a very handy choice.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, how did we get to the comet?
p113
aVBecause we had to go there for the Rosetta scientific objectives
p114
aVvery far away \u2014 four times the distance of the Earth to the sun \u2014
p115
aVand also at a much higher velocity than we could achieve with fuel,
p116
aVbecause we'd have to take six times as much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed.
p117
aVSo what do you do?
p118
aVYou use gravitational flybys, slingshots,
p119
aVwhere you pass by a planet at very low altitude,
p120
aVa few thousand kilometers,
p121
aVand then you get the velocity of that planet around the sun for free.
p122
aVWe did that a few times.
p123
aVWe did Earth, we did Mars, we did twice Earth again,
p124
aVand we also flew by two asteroids, Lutetia and Steins.
p125
aVThen in 2011, we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble,
p126
aVwe couldn't actually save the spacecraft anymore,
p127
aVso we went into hibernation.
p128
aVEverything was switched off except for one clock.
p129
aVHere you see in white the trajectory, and the way this works.
p130
aVYou see that from the circle where we started,
p131
aVthe white line, actually you get more and more and more elliptical,
p132
aVand then finally we approached the comet
p133
aVin May 2014, and we had to start doing the rendezvous maneuvers.
p134
aa(lp135
VOn the way there, we flew by Earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras.
p136
aVThis is the moon rising over Earth,
p137
aVand this is what we now call a selfie,
p138
aVwhich at that time, by the way, that word didn't exist. (Laughter)
p139
aVIt's at Mars. It was taken by the CIVA camera.
p140
aVThat's one of the cameras on the lander,
p141
aVand it just looks under the solar arrays,
p142
aVand you see the planet Mars and the solar array in the distance.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow, when we got out of hibernation in January 2014,
p145
aVwe started arriving at a distance
p146
aVof two million kilometers from the comet in May.
p147
aVHowever, the velocity the spacecraft had was much too fast.
p148
aVWe were going 2,800 kilometers an hour faster than the comet, so we had to brake.
p149
aVWe had to do eight maneuvers,
p150
aVand you see here, some of them were really big.
p151
aVWe had to brake the first one by a few hundred kilometers per hour,
p152
aVand actually, the duration of that was seven hours,
p153
aVand it used 218 kilos of fuel,
p154
aVand those were seven nerve-wracking  hours, because in 2007,
p155
aVthere was a leak in the system of the propulsion of Rosetta,
p156
aVand we had to close off a branch,
p157
aVso the system was actually operating at a pressure
p158
aVwhich it was never designed or qualified for.
p159
aa(lp160
VThen we got in the vicinity of the comet, and these were the first pictures we saw.
p161
aVThe true comet rotation period is 12 and a half hours,
p162
aVso this is accelerated,
p163
aVbut you will understand that our flight dynamics engineers thought,
p164
aVthis is not going to be an easy thing to land on.
p165
aVWe had hoped for some kind of spud-like thing
p166
aVwhere you could easily land.
p167
aVBut we had one hope: maybe it was smooth.
p168
aVNo. That didn't work either. (Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VSo at that point in time, it was clearly unavoidable:
p171
aVwe had to map this body in all the detail you could get,
p172
aVbecause we had to find an area which is 500 meters in diameter and flat.
p173
aVWhy 500 meters? That's the error we have on landing the probe.
p174
aVSo we went through this process, and we mapped the comet.
p175
aVWe used a technique called photoclinometry.
p176
aVYou use shadows thrown by the sun.
p177
aVWhat you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the comet,
p178
aVand the sun shines from above.
p179
aVFrom the shadow, we, with our brain,
p180
aVcan immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is.
p181
aVYou can program that in a computer,
p182
aVyou then cover the whole comet, and you can map the comet.
p183
aVFor that, we flew special trajectories starting in August.
p184
aVFirst, a triangle of 100 kilometers on a side
p185
aVat 100 kilometers' distance,
p186
aVand we repeated the whole  thing at 50 kilometers.
p187
aVAt that time, we had seen the comet at all kinds of angles,
p188
aVand we could use this technique to map the whole thing.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, this led to a selection of landing sites.
p191
aVThis whole process we had to do, to go from the mapping of the comet
p192
aVto actually finding the final landing site, was 60 days.
p193
aVWe didn't have more.
p194
aVTo give you an idea, the average Mars mission
p195
aVtakes hundreds of scientists for years to meet
p196
aVabout where shall we go?
p197
aVWe had 60 days, and that was it.
p198
aa(lp199
VWe finally selected the final landing site
p200
aVand the commands were prepared for Rosetta to launch Philae.
p201
aVThe way this works is that Rosetta has to be at the right point in space,
p202
aVand aiming towards the comet, because the lander is passive.
p203
aVThe lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet.
p204
aVRosetta had to turn around
p205
aVto get its cameras to actually look at Philae while it was departing
p206
aVand to be able to communicate with it.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow, the landing duration of the whole trajectory was seven hours.
p209
aVNow do a simple calculation:
p210
aVif the velocity of Rosetta is off by one centimeter per second,
p211
aVseven hours is 25,000 seconds.
p212
aVThat means 252 meters wrong on the comet.
p213
aVSo we had to know the velocity of Rosetta
p214
aVmuch better than one centimeter per second,
p215
aVand its location in space better than 100 meters
p216
aVat 500 million kilometers from Earth.
p217
aVThat's no mean feat.
p218
aa(lp219
VLet me quickly take you through some of the science and the instruments.
p220
aVI won't bore you with all the details of all the instruments,
p221
aVbut it's got everything.
p222
aVWe can sniff gas, we can measure dust particles,
p223
aVthe shape of them, the composition,
p224
aVthere are magnetometers, everything.
p225
aVThis is one of the results from an instrument which measures gas density
p226
aVat the position of Rosetta,
p227
aVso it's gas which has left the comet.
p228
aVThe bottom graph is September of last year.
p229
aVThere is a long-term variation, which in itself is not surprising,
p230
aVbut you see the sharp peaks.
p231
aVThis is a comet day.
p232
aVYou can see the effect of the sun on the evaporation of gas
p233
aVand the fact that the comet is rotating.
p234
aVSo there is one spot, apparently,
p235
aVwhere there is a lot of stuff coming from,
p236
aVit gets heated in the Sun, and then cools down on the back side.
p237
aVAnd we can see the density variations of this.
p238
aa(lp239
VThese are the gases and the organic compounds
p240
aVthat we already have measured.
p241
aVYou will see it's an impressive list,
p242
aVand there is much, much, much more to come,
p243
aVbecause there are more measurements.
p244
aVActually, there is a conference going on in Houston at the moment
p245
aVwhere many of these results are presented.
p246
aa(lp247
VAlso, we measured dust particles.
p248
aVNow, for you, this will not look very impressive,
p249
aVbut the scientists were thrilled when they saw this.
p250
aVTwo dust particles:
p251
aVthe right one they call Boris, and they shot it with tantalum
p252
aVin order to be able to analyze it.
p253
aVNow, we found sodium and magnesium.
p254
aVWhat this tells you is this is the concentration of these two materials
p255
aVat the time the solar system was formed,
p256
aVso we learned things about which materials were there
p257
aVwhen the planet was made.
p258
aa(lp259
VOf course, one of the important elements is the imaging.
p260
aVThis is one of the cameras of Rosetta, the OSIRIS camera,
p261
aVand this actually was the cover of Science magazine
p262
aVon January 23 of this year.
p263
aVNobody had expected this body to look like this.
p264
aVBoulders, rocks \u2014 if anything, it looks more like the Half Dome in Yosemite
p265
aVthan anything else.
p266
aVWe also saw things like this:
p267
aVdunes, and what look to be, on the righthand side, wind-blown shadows.
p268
aVNow we know these from Mars, but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere,
p269
aVso it's a bit difficult to create a wind-blown shadow.
p270
aVIt may be local outgassing,
p271
aVstuff which goes up and comes back.
p272
aVWe don't know, so there is a lot to investigate.
p273
aVHere, you see the same image twice.
p274
aVOn the left-hand side, you see in the middle a pit.
p275
aVOn the right-hand side, if you carefully look,
p276
aVthere are three jets coming out of the bottom of that pit.
p277
aVSo this is the activity of the comet.
p278
aVApparently, at the bottom of these pits is where the active regions are,
p279
aVand where the material evaporates into space.
p280
aVThere is a very intriguing crack in the neck of the comet.
p281
aVYou see it on the right-hand side.
p282
aVIt's a kilometer long, and it's two and a half meters wide.
p283
aVSome people suggest that actually,
p284
aVwhen we get close to the sun,
p285
aVthe comet may split in two,
p286
aVand then we'll have to choose,
p287
aVwhich comet do we go for?
p288
aVThe lander \u2014 again, lots of instruments,
p289
aVmostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill, etc.
p290
aVBut much the same as Rosetta, and that is because you want to compare
p291
aVwhat you find in space with what you find on the comet.
p292
aVThese are called ground truth measurements.
p293
aa(lp294
VThese are the landing descent images
p295
aVthat were taken by the OSIRIS camera.
p296
aVYou see the lander getting further and further away from Rosetta.
p297
aVOn the top right, you see an image taken at 60 meters by the lander,
p298
aV60 meters above the surface of the comet.
p299
aVThe boulder there is some 10 meters.
p300
aVSo this is one of the last images we took before we landed on the comet.
p301
aVHere, you see the whole sequence again, but from a different perspective,
p302
aVand you see three blown-ups from the bottom-left to the middle
p303
aVof the lander traveling over the surface of the comet.
p304
aVThen, at the top, there is a before and an after image of the landing.
p305
aVThe only problem with the after image is, there is no lander.
p306
aVBut if you carefully look at the right-hand side of this image,
p307
aVwe saw the lander still there,  but it had bounced.
p308
aVIt had departed again.
p309
aa(lp310
VNow, on a bit of a comical note here
p311
aVis that originally Rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce.
p312
aVThat was discarded because it was way too expensive.
p313
aVNow, we forgot, but the lander knew.
p314
aV(Laughter)
p315
aVDuring the first bounce, in the magnetometers,
p316
aVyou see here the data from them, from the three axes, x, y and z.
p317
aVHalfway through, you see a red line.
p318
aVAt that red line, there is a change.
p319
aVWhat happened, apparently, is during the first bounce,
p320
aVsomewhere, we hit the edge of a crater with one of the legs of the lander,
p321
aVand the rotation velocity of the lander changed.
p322
aVSo we've been rather lucky
p323
aVthat we are where we are.
p324
aa(lp325
VThis is one of the iconic images of Rosetta.
p326
aVIt's a man-made object, a leg of the lander,
p327
aVstanding on a comet.
p328
aVThis, for me, is one of the very best images of space science I have ever seen.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VOne of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander.
p333
aVThe blue area here is where we know it must be.
p334
aVWe haven't been able to find it yet, but the search is continuing,
p335
aVas are our efforts to start getting the lander to work again.
p336
aVWe listen every day,
p337
aVand we hope that between now and somewhere in April,
p338
aVthe lander will wake up again.
p339
aa(lp340
VThe findings of what we found on the comet:
p341
aVThis thing would float in water.
p342
aVIt's half the density of water.
p343
aVSo it looks like a very big rock, but it's not.
p344
aVThe activity increase we saw in June, July, August last year
p345
aVwas a four-fold activity increase.
p346
aVBy the time we will be at the sun,
p347
aVthere will be 100 kilos a second leaving this comet:
p348
aVgas, dust, whatever.
p349
aVThat's 100 million kilos a day.
p350
aa(lp351
VThen, finally, the landing day.
p352
aVI will never forget \u2014 absolute madness, 250 TV crews in Germany.
p353
aVThe BBC was interviewing me,
p354
aVand another TV crew who was following me all day
p355
aVwere filming me being interviewed,
p356
aVand it went on like that for the whole day.
p357
aVThe Discovery Channel crew
p358
aVactually caught me when leaving the control room,
p359
aVand they asked the right question,
p360
aVand man, I got into tears, and I still feel this.
p361
aVFor a month and a half,
p362
aVI couldn't think about landing day without crying,
p363
aVand I still have the emotion in me.
p364
aa(lp365
VWith this image of the comet, I would like to leave you.
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you.

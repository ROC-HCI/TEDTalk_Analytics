VDo we live in a borderless world?
p5
aVBefore you answer that, have a look at this map.
p6
aVContemporary political map shows
p7
aVthat we have over 200 countries in the world today.
p8
aVThat's probably more than at any time in centuries.
p9
aVNow, many of you will object.
p10
aVFor you this would be a more appropriate map.
p11
aVYou could call it TEDistan.
p12
aVIn TEDistan, there are no borders,
p13
aVjust connected spaces and unconnected spaces.
p14
aVMost of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots
p15
aVon this screen, of the many more
p16
aVthat represent 90 percent of the world economy.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population
p19
aVthat will never leave the place in which they were born.
p20
aVFor them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,
p21
aVand often violently.
p22
aVNow here at TED, we're solving some of the great
p23
aVriddles of science and mysteries of the universe.
p24
aVWell here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:
p25
aVour basic political geography.
p26
aVHow do we distribute ourselves around the world?
p27
aa(lp28
VNow this is important, because border conflicts
p29
aVjustify so much of the world's military-industrial complex.
p30
aVBorder conflicts can derail
p31
aVso much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.
p32
aVSo I think we need a deeper understanding
p33
aVof how people, money, power,
p34
aVreligion, culture, technology
p35
aVinteract to change the map of the world.
p36
aVAnd we can try to anticipate those changes,
p37
aVand shape them in a more constructive direction.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo we're going to look at some maps of the past,
p40
aVthe present and some maps you haven't seen
p41
aVin order to get a sense of where things are going.
p42
aVLet's start with the world of 1945.
p43
aV1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.
p44
aVAfter World War II, Europe was devastated,
p45
aVbut still held large overseas colonies:
p46
aVFrench West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.
p47
aVThen over the late '40s,
p48
aV'50s, '60s, '70s and '80s,
p49
aVwaves of decolonization took place.
p50
aVOver 50 new countries were born.
p51
aVYou can see that Africa has been fragmented.
p52
aVIndia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created.
p53
aVThen came the end of the Cold War.
p54
aVThe end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
p55
aVYou had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe,
p56
aVthe former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans,
p57
aVand the 'stans of central Asia.
p58
aa(lp59
VToday we have 200 countries in the world.
p60
aVThe entire planet is covered
p61
aVby sovereign, independent nation-states.
p62
aVDoes that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss?
p63
aVLet's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world,
p64
aVEastern Eurasia.
p65
aVAs you can see on this map,
p66
aVRussia is still the largest country in the world.
p67
aVAnd as you know, China is the most populous.
p68
aVAnd they share a lengthy land border.
p69
aa(lp70
VWhat you don't see on this map
p71
aVis that most of Russia's 150 million people
p72
aVare concentrated in its western provinces
p73
aVand areas that are close to Europe.
p74
aVAnd only 30 million people are in its eastern areas.
p75
aVIn fact, the World Bank predicts
p76
aVthat Russia's population is declining
p77
aVtowards about 120 million people
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd there is another thing that you don't see on this map.
p80
aVStalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders
p81
aVforced Russians out to the far east
p82
aVto be in gulags, labor camps,
p83
aVnuclear cities, whatever the case was.
p84
aVBut as oil prices rose,
p85
aVRussian governments have invested in infrastructure
p86
aVto unite the country, east and west.
p87
aVBut nothing has more perversely impacted
p88
aVRussia's demographic distribution,
p89
aVbecause the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,
p90
aVhave gotten on those trains and roads
p91
aVand gone back to the west.
p92
aVAs a result, in the Russian far east today,
p93
aVwhich is twice the size of India,
p94
aVyou have exactly six million Russians.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.
p97
aVWe can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.
p98
aVWhy do they call it that?
p99
aVBecause in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate
p100
aVand own most of the mines \u2014 copper, zinc, gold \u2014
p101
aVand they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.
p102
aVChina isn't conquering Mongolia.
p103
aVIt's buying it.
p104
aVColonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo let's apply this principle to Siberia.
p107
aVSiberia most of you probably think of
p108
aVas a cold, desolate, unlivable place.
p109
aVBut in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,
p110
aVall of a sudden you have vast wheat fields
p111
aVand agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.
p112
aVBut who is it going to feed?
p113
aVWell, just on the other side of the Amo River,
p114
aVin the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,
p115
aVyou have over 100 million people.
p116
aVThat's larger than the entire population of Russia.
p117
aa(lp118
VEvery single year, for at least a decade or more,
p119
aV[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,
p120
aVcrossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.
p121
aVThey set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.
p122
aVThey've taken over the timber industry
p123
aVand been shipping the lumber east, back into China.
p124
aVAgain, like Mongolia,
p125
aVChina isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.
p126
aVThat's what I call globalization Chinese style.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow maybe this is what the map of the region
p129
aVmight look like in 10 to 20 years.
p130
aVBut hold on. This map is 700 years old.
p131
aVThis is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,
p132
aVled by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.
p133
aVSo history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,
p134
aVbut it does rhyme.
p135
aa(lp136
VThis is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.
p137
aVAgain, globalization Chinese style.
p138
aVBecause globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to
p139
aVundermine and change the way we think about political geography.
p140
aVSo, the history of East Asia in fact,
p141
aVpeople don't think about nations and borders.
p142
aVThey think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,
p143
aVusually Chinese or Japanese.
p144
aa(lp145
VWell it's China's turn again.
p146
aVSo let's look at how China is re-establishing
p147
aVthat hierarchy in the far East.
p148
aVIt starts with the global hubs.
p149
aVRemember the 40 dots on the nighttime map
p150
aVthat show the hubs of the global economy?
p151
aVEast Asia today has more of those global hubs
p152
aVthan any other region in the world.
p153
aVTokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,
p154
aVHong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.
p155
aVThese are the filters and funnels of global capital.
p156
aVTrillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,
p157
aVso much of it being invested into China.
p158
aa(lp159
VThen there is trade.
p160
aVThese vectors and arrows represent ever stronger
p161
aVtrade relationships that China has
p162
aVwith every country in the region.
p163
aVSpecifically, it targets Japan
p164
aVand Korea and Australia,
p165
aVcountries that are strong allies of the United States.
p166
aVAustralia, for example, is heavily dependent
p167
aVon exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.
p168
aVFor poorer countries, China reduces tariffs
p169
aVso that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply
p170
aVand become dependent on exporting to China as well.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd now many of you have been reading in the news
p173
aVhow people are looking to China
p174
aVto lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.
p175
aVThe Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging
p176
aVnow has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.
p177
aVSo China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnother pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.
p180
aVChina has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.
p181
aVIt has become the hub of diplomatic institutions
p182
aVsuch as the East Asian Community.
p183
aVSome of these organizations don't even have
p184
aVthe United States as a member.
p185
aVThere is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,
p186
aVsuch that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,
p187
aVmost countries vow to just sit it out,
p188
aVincluding American allies like Korea and Australia.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnother pillar of the strategy,
p191
aVlike Russia, is demographic.
p192
aVChina exports business people, nannies, students,
p193
aVteachers to teach Chinese around the region,
p194
aVto intermarry and to occupy ever greater
p195
aVcommanding heights of the economies.
p196
aVAlready ethnic Chinese people
p197
aVin Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia
p198
aVare the real key factors and drivers
p199
aVin the economies there.
p200
aVChinese pride is resurgent in the region
p201
aVas a result.
p202
aVSingapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.
p203
aVNow it encourages it.
p204
aa(lp205
VIf you add it all up what do you get?
p206
aVWell, if you remember before World War II,
p207
aVJapan had a vision
p208
aVfor a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.
p209
aVWhat's emerging today is what you might call
p210
aVa greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.
p211
aVSo no matter what the lines on the map tell you
p212
aVin terms of nations and borders,
p213
aVwhat you really have emerging in the far east
p214
aVare national cultures,
p215
aVbut in a much more fluid, imperial zone.
p216
aVAll of this is happening without firing a shot.
p217
aa(lp218
VThat's most certainly not the case in the Middle East
p219
aVwhere countries are still very uncomfortable
p220
aVin the borders left behind by European colonialists.
p221
aVSo what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?
p222
aVWhat lines on the map should we focus on?
p223
aVWhat I want to present to you is what I call
p224
aVstate building, day by day.
p225
aa(lp226
VLet's start with Iraq.
p227
aVSix years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,
p228
aVthe country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.
p229
aVOil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;
p230
aVnow it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.
p231
aVThe reason is Kurdistan.
p232
aVThe Kurds for 3,000 years
p233
aVhave been waging a struggle for independence,
p234
aVand now is their chance to finally have it.
p235
aVThese are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,
p236
aVwhich is an oil-rich region.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd today, if you go to Kurdistan,
p239
aVyou'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas
p240
aVare squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.
p241
aVBut what are they guarding?
p242
aVIs it really a border on the map?
p243
aVNo. It's the pipelines.
p244
aVIf the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms
p245
aVof their own statehood.
p246
aVNow should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?
p247
aVI don't believe we should.
p248
aVIraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,
p249
aVbehind Saudi Arabia.
p250
aVAnd we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.
p251
aVNow remember Kurdistan is landlocked.
p252
aVIt has no choice but to behave.
p253
aVIn order to profit from its oil
p254
aVit has to export it through Turkey or Syria,
p255
aVand other countries, and Iraq itself.
p256
aVAnd therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.
p257
aa(lp258
VNow lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.
p259
aVThat is, of course, in Palestine.
p260
aVPalestine is something of a cartographic anomaly
p261
aVbecause it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.
p262
aV30 years of rose garden diplomacy
p263
aVhave not delivered us peace in this conflict.
p264
aVWhat might? I believe that what might
p265
aVsolve the problem is infrastructure.
p266
aVToday donors are spending billions of dollars on this.
p267
aVThese two arrows are an arc,
p268
aVan arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure
p269
aVthat link the West Bank and Gaza.
p270
aa(lp271
VIf Gaza can have a functioning port
p272
aVand be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,
p273
aVPalestinian economy.
p274
aVThat, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.
p275
aVThe lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine
p276
aVis that independence alone, without infrastructure,
p277
aVis futile.
p278
aa(lp279
VNow what might this entire region look like
p280
aVif in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,
p281
aVwhen the insecurities might abate?
p282
aVThe last time that was the case was actually
p283
aVa century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.
p284
aVThis is the Hejaz Railway.
p285
aVThe Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.
p286
aVIt even had an offshoot running to Haifa
p287
aVin what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.
p288
aVBut today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.
p289
aVIf we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,
p290
aVinfrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,
p291
aVI believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow let's look at another part of the world,
p294
aVthe former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.
p295
aVThese countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.
p296
aVHe purposely did not want these countries to make sense.
p297
aVHe wanted ethnicities to mingle
p298
aVin ways that would allow him to divide and rule.
p299
aVFortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources
p300
aVwere discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.
p301
aa(lp302
VNow I know some of you may be thinking, "Oil, oil, oil.
p303
aVWhy is it all he's talking about is oil?"
p304
aVWell, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil
p305
aVand the way we're talking about it now.
p306
aVBefore it was, how do we control their oil?
p307
aVNow it's their oil for their own purposes.
p308
aVAnd I assure you it's every bit as important to them
p309
aVas it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.
p310
aVHere are just some of the pipeline projections
p311
aVand possibilities and scenarios
p312
aVand routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.
p313
aVA great deal of them.
p314
aa(lp315
VFor a number of countries in this part of the world,
p316
aVhaving pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy
p317
aVand for having some meaning
p318
aVbesides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.
p319
aVJust take Azerbaijan.
p320
aVAzerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,
p321
aVbut now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,
p322
aVit has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.
p323
aa(lp324
VThen there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of
p325
aVas a frozen basket case.
p326
aVBut now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea
p327
aVto provide for Europe,
p328
aVand even a potentially Turkmen-
p329
aVAfghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.
p330
aa(lp331
VThen there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.
p332
aVIt was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.
p333
aVToday most people recognize Kazakhstan
p334
aVas an emerging geopolitical player. Why?
p335
aVBecause it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,
p336
aVnorth through Russia, and even east to China.
p337
aVMore pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.
p338
aVThe Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.
p339
aVSilk road connotes independence and mutual trust.
p340
aVThe more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,
p341
aVand the less of a dominant Great Game competition
p342
aVwe'll have in the 21st century.
p343
aa(lp344
VNow let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,
p345
aVand how that has enhanced its strength.
p346
aVAnd that is, of course, Europe.
p347
aVThe European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,
p348
aVand their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany
p349
aVto happen in a peaceful way.
p350
aVBut then eventually it grew into 12 countries,
p351
aVand those are the 12 stars on the European flag.
p352
aVThe E.U. also became a currency block,
p353
aVand is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.
p354
aVOn average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year
p355
aVsince the end of the Cold War.
p356
aVIn fact most of that happened on just one day.
p357
aVIn 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.
p358
aVand now you have what most people consider
p359
aVa zone of peace spanning 27 countries
p360
aVand 450 million people.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo what is next? What is the future of the European Union?
p363
aVWell in light blue, you see the zones
p364
aVor the regions that are at least two-thirds
p365
aVor more dependent on the European Union
p366
aVfor trade and investment.
p367
aVWhat does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us
p368
aVthat Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.
p369
aVEven if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,
p370
aVthey are becoming part of its sphere of influence.
p371
aVJust take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia
p372
aVBosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.
p373
aVBut you can get on a German ICE train
p374
aVand make it almost to Albania.
p375
aVIn Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,
p376
aVand that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa.
p379
aVOn average, every year or two,
p380
aVa new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,
p381
aVconnecting North Africa to Europe.
p382
aVThat not only helps Europe diminish its reliance
p383
aVon Russia for energy,
p384
aVbut if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying
p385
aVthat they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.
p386
aVSo in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France
p387
aVis right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.
p388
aa(lp389
VNow let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.
p390
aVI mentioned Azerbaijan before.
p391
aVThat corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus
p392
aVhas become the conduit for 20 percent
p393
aVof Europe's energy supply.
p394
aVSo does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?
p395
aVI don't think it does. I think it's already part of
p396
aVa Euro-Turkish superpower.
p397
aa(lp398
VSo what's next? Where are we going to see borders change
p399
aVand new countries born?
p400
aVWell, South Central Asia, South West Asia
p401
aVis a very good place to start.
p402
aVEight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan
p403
aVthere is still a tremendous amount of instability.
p404
aVPakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile
p405
aVthat neither of them have dealt constructively
p406
aVwith the problem of Pashtun nationalism.
p407
aVThis is the flag that flies in the minds
p408
aVof 20 million Pashtuns
p409
aVwho live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.
p410
aa(lp411
VLet's not neglect the insurgency just to the south,
p412
aVBalochistan. Two weeks ago,
p413
aVBalochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,
p414
aVand this was the flag that they raised over it.
p415
aVThe post-colonial entropy
p416
aVthat is happening around the world is accelerating,
p417
aVand I expect more such changes to occur in the map
p418
aVas the states fragment.
p419
aa(lp420
VOf course, we can't forget Africa.
p421
aV53 countries, and by far the most number
p422
aVof suspiciously straight lines on the map.
p423
aVIf we were to look at all of Africa
p424
aVwe could most certainly acknowledge far more,
p425
aVtribal divisions and so forth.
p426
aVBut let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.
p427
aVIt has three ongoing civil wars,
p428
aVthe genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,
p429
aVthe civil war in the east of the country,
p430
aVand south Sudan.
p431
aVSouth Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011
p432
aVin which it is very likely to vote itself independence.
p433
aa(lp434
VNow let's go up to the Arctic Circle.
p435
aVThere is a great race on for energy resources
p436
aVunder the Arctic seabed.
p437
aVWho will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?
p438
aVActually Greenland.
p439
aVSeveral weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people
p440
aVvoted themselves self-governance rights
p441
aVfrom Denmark.
p442
aVSo Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.
p443
aa(lp444
VWhat is the lesson from all of this?
p445
aVGeopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.
p446
aVIt's constantly morphing and changing the world,
p447
aVlike climate change.
p448
aVAnd like our relationship with the ecosystem
p449
aVwe're always searching for equilibrium
p450
aVin how we divide ourselves across the planet.
p451
aVNow we fear changes on the map.
p452
aVWe fear civil wars, death tolls,
p453
aVhaving to learn the names of new countries.
p454
aVBut I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today
p455
aVis far worse and far more violent.
p456
aa(lp457
VThe question is how do we change those borders,
p458
aVand what lines do we focus on?
p459
aVI believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,
p460
aVthe infrastructure lines.
p461
aVThen we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.
p462
aVThank you.

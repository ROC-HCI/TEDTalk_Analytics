VI'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute.
p5
aa(lp6
VBefore I tell that story, we should ask ourselves the question:
p7
aVWhy does poverty exist?
p8
aVI mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs.
p9
aVWe all live in the same planet,
p10
aVbut there's still a great deal of poverty in the world.
p11
aVAnd I think \u2014 so I want to throw a perspective that I have,
p12
aVso that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter,
p13
aVto see whether it's contributing or \u2014
p14
aVcontributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.
p15
aa(lp16
VRich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.
p17
aVAnd by and large, this has failed.
p18
aVAnd you can see this book,
p19
aVwritten by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years,
p20
aVand he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive.
p21
aVBy and large, it did not work.
p22
aVSo the question is, why is that?
p23
aa(lp24
VIn my mind, there is something to learn from the history of Europe.
p25
aVI mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street,
p26
aVand they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago,
p27
aVright across the street from here.
p28
aVSo my point is, there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe,
p29
aVwhere citizens were empowered by technologies.
p30
aVAnd they demanded authorities from \u2014
p31
aVto come down from their high horses.
p32
aVAnd in the end, there's better bargaining
p33
aVbetween the authorities and citizens,
p34
aVand democracies, capitalism \u2014 everything else flourished.
p35
aVAnd so you can see, the real process of \u2014
p36
aVand this is backed up by this 500-page book \u2014
p37
aVthat the authorities came down and citizens got up.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut if you look, if you have that perspective,
p40
aVthen you can see what happened in the last 60 years.
p41
aVAid actually did the opposite.
p42
aVIt empowered authorities,
p43
aVand, as a result, marginalized citizens.
p44
aVThe authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen
p45
aVso that they could tax people
p46
aVand make more money for to run their business.
p47
aVBecause they were getting it from abroad.
p48
aVAnd in fact, if you see oil-rich countries,
p49
aVwhere citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes \u2014
p50
aVNigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries.
p51
aVBecause the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way.
p52
aVIt empowers authorities, without activating the citizens \u2014
p53
aVtheir hands, legs, brains, what have you.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries
p56
aVis to recognize that economic development is of the people,
p57
aVby the people, for the people.
p58
aVAnd that is the real network effect.
p59
aVIf citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive,
p60
aVso that their voices are heard,
p61
aVso then things would improve.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world,
p64
aVthe World Bank, is an organization of the government,
p65
aVby the government, for the governments.
p66
aVJust see the contrast.
p67
aVAnd that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.
p68
aa(lp69
VOf course, how would you empower citizens?
p70
aVThere could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones.
p71
aVRecently "The Economist" recognized this,
p72
aVbut I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago,
p73
aVand that's what I've been working on.
p74
aVSo 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.
p75
aa(lp76
VWe had \u2014 quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network.
p77
aVAnd we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks;
p78
aVwe could update each other more often.
p79
aVBut one time it broke down.
p80
aVAnd it reminded me of a day in 1971.
p81
aVThere was a war going on in my country.
p82
aVAnd my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live,
p83
aVto a remote rural area where it was safer.
p84
aVAnd one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.
p85
aVAnd I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.
p86
aVAnd he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.
p87
aVSo I had another unproductive day.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo while I was sitting in a tall building in New York,
p90
aVI put those two experiences together side by side,
p91
aVand basically concluded that connectivity is productivity \u2014
p92
aVwhether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.
p93
aVSo naturally, I \u2014 the implication of that is
p94
aVthat the telephone is a weapon against poverty.
p95
aVAnd if that's the case, then the question is
p96
aVhow many telephones did we have at that time?
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladesh
p99
aVfor every 500 people.
p100
aVAnd all those phones were in the few urban places.
p101
aVThe vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived,
p102
aVthere were no telephones.
p103
aVSo just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted,
p104
aVjust like I wasted a day.
p105
aVIf you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month,
p106
aVwhatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.
p107
aVAnd after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal,
p108
aVis their days are the same length: 24 hours.
p109
aVSo if you lose that precious resource,
p110
aVwhere you are somewhat equal to the richer countries,
p111
aVthat's a huge waste.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo I started looking for any evidence that \u2014
p114
aVdoes connectivity really increase productivity?
p115
aVAnd I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU,
p116
aVwhich is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva.
p117
aVThey show an interesting thing.
p118
aVThat you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country.
p119
aVSo the United States or the UK would be here, outside.
p120
aVAnd so the impact of one new telephone,
p121
aVwhich is on the vertical axis, is very little.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is,
p124
aVlet's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars,
p125
aVthen the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.
p126
aVThe question was,
p127
aVhow much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?
p128
aVIt turns out: 2,000 dollars.
p129
aVSo if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years,
p130
aVand if 5,000 dollars every year \u2014 so that's 50,000 dollars.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo obviously this was a gadget to have.
p133
aVAnd of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down,
p134
aVbecause there's a digital revolution going on,
p135
aVthen it would be even more dramatic.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd I knew a little economics by then \u2014
p138
aVit says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity.
p139
aVBut how would you specialize?
p140
aVLet's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer.
p141
aVAnd Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.
p142
aVSo the point is that we could only \u2014 the only way we could depend on each other,
p143
aVis if we can connect with each other.
p144
aVAnd if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.
p145
aa(lp146
VBut then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area.
p147
aVBut in order to expand that, you need a river,
p148
aVor you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.
p149
aVBut in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.
p150
aVAnd that leads to specialization.
p151
aVThat leads to productivity.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo the question was, I started looking at this issue,
p154
aVand going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.
p155
aVThere were a lot of reasons people told me
p156
aVwhy we don't have enough telephones.
p157
aVAnd one of them is the lacking buying power.
p158
aVPoor people apparently don't have the power to buy.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?
p161
aVI mean, in America, people buy cars,
p162
aVand they put very little money down.
p163
aVThey get a car, and they go to work.
p164
aVThe work pays them a salary;
p165
aVthe salary allows them to pay for the car over time.
p166
aVThe car pays for itself.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo if the telephone is a production tool,
p169
aVthen we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power.
p170
aVAnd of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?
p171
aVSo then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?
p172
aVIn the United States, we have \u2014 everybody needs a banking service,
p173
aVbut very few of us are trying to buy a bank.
p174
aVSo it's \u2014 a bank tends to serve a whole community.
p175
aVSo we could do that for telephones.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet:
p178
aVfood, clothing, shelter, whatever.
p179
aVBut again, it's very paternalistic.
p180
aVYou should be raising income
p181
aVand let people decide what they want to do with their money.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.
p184
aVSee, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.
p185
aVFor instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S.
p186
aVbecause there were \u2014 there were people who had computers.
p187
aVThey had modems.
p188
aVThey had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea, like the Internet.
p189
aVBut that's what's lacking in a poor country.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks,
p192
aVfew banks to collect bills, etc.
p193
aVBut that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people,
p194
aVand had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.
p195
aVAnd they had these branches.
p196
aVI thought I could put cell towers and create a network.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd anyway, to cut the time short \u2014 so I started \u2014
p199
aVI first went to them and said,
p200
aV"You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient."
p201
aVBut you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones,
p202
aVso they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons,
p203
aVbut this was one of the reasons \u2014 they had to be.
p204
aVAnd so they were not that interested to connect all their branches,
p205
aVand then to be \u2014 and rock the boat.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo I started focusing. What is it that they really do?
p208
aVSo what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank.
p209
aVShe typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk.
p210
aVAnd she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan.
p211
aVAnd this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow.
p214
aVBecause some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank,
p215
aVget a phone and have the phone for everybody.
p216
aVAnd it's a business for her.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo I wrote to the bank, and they thought for a while, and they said,
p219
aV"It's a little crazy, but logical.
p220
aVIf you think it can be done, come and make it happen."
p221
aVSo I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh.
p222
aVI created a company in America called Gonofone,
p223
aVwhich in Bengali means "people's phone."
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd angel investors in America put in money into that.
p226
aVI flew around the world.
p227
aVAfter about a million \u2014 I mean, I got rejected from lots of places,
p228
aVbecause I was not only trying to go to a poor country,
p229
aVI was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.
p230
aa(lp231
VAfter about a million miles, and a meaningful \u2014
p232
aVa substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and \u2014
p233
aVwhich involved the Norwegian telephone company,
p234
aVwhich provided the know-how,
p235
aVand the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.
p236
aa(lp237
VTo make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.
p238
aVYou can see it's pretty much covered.
p239
aVEven in Bangladesh, there are some empty places.
p240
aVBut we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year
p241
aVto extend that coverage.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow, about that cow model I talked about.
p244
aVThere are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services
p245
aVin their neighborhoods.
p246
aVAnd it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd these phones are generating
p249
aVabout 100 million dollars for the company.
p250
aVAnd two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways.
p253
aVIt increases income, improves welfare, etc.
p254
aVAnd the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company,
p255
aVwith 3.5 million subscribers,
p256
aV115,000 of these phones I talked about \u2014
p257
aVthat produces about a third of the traffic in the network.
p258
aVAnd 2004, the net profit, after taxes \u2014
p259
aVvery serious taxes \u2014 was 120 million dollars.
p260
aVAnd the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd again, here are some of the lessons.
p263
aV"The government needs to provide economically viable services."
p264
aVActually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that.
p265
aV"Governments need to subsidize private companies."
p266
aVThis is what some people think.
p267
aVAnd actually, private companies help governments with taxes.
p268
aV"Poor people are recipients."
p269
aVPoor people are a resource.
p270
aV"Services cost too much for the poor."
p271
aVTheir involvement reduces the cost.
p272
aV"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."
p273
aVThey are very eager learners and very capable survivors.
p274
aVI've been very surprised.
p275
aVMost of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.
p276
aV"Poor countries need aid."
p277
aVBusinesses \u2014 this one company has raised the \u2014
p278
aVif the ideal figures are even five percent true, this one company
p279
aVis raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives.
p280
aVAnd as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned,
p281
aVaid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen, the famous inventor in America.
p284
aVHe has produced some power generators,
p285
aVwhich we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh,
p286
aVin two villages where cow manure is producing biogas,
p287
aVwhich is running these generators.
p288
aVAnd each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each.
p289
aVIt's just an experiment.
p290
aVWe don't know how far it will go,
p291
aVbut it's going on.
p292
aa(lp293
VThank you.

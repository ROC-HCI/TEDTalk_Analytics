VI moved to Boston 10 years ago from Chicago,
p5
aVwith an interest in cancer and in chemistry.
p6
aVYou might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules
p7
aVor, to my taste,
p8
aVnew drugs for cancer.
p9
aVAnd you might also know that, for science and medicine,
p10
aVBoston is a bit of a candy store.
p11
aVYou can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge without hitting a graduate student.
p12
aVThe bar is called the Miracle of Science.
p13
aVThe billboards say "Lab Space Available."
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd it's fair to say that in these 10 years,
p16
aVwe've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution \u2014
p17
aVthat of genome medicine.
p18
aVWe know more about the patients that enter our clinic now
p19
aVthan ever before.
p20
aVAnd we're able, finally, to answer the question
p21
aVthat's been so pressing for so many years:
p22
aVWhy do I have cancer?
p23
aVThis information is also pretty staggering.
p24
aVYou might know that, so far, in just the dawn of this revolution,
p25
aVwe know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations
p26
aVaffecting more than 10,000 genes,
p27
aVand that there are 500 of these genes that are bona-fide drivers,
p28
aVcauses of cancer.
p29
aa(lp30
VYet comparatively,
p31
aVwe have about a dozen targeted medications.
p32
aVAnd this inadequacy of cancer medicine
p33
aVreally hit home when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
p34
aVWe didn't fly him to Boston.
p35
aVWe didn't sequence his genome.
p36
aVIt's been known for decades what causes this malignancy.
p37
aVIt's three proteins: ras, myc, p53.
p38
aVThis is old information we've known since about the 80s,
p39
aVyet there's no medicine I can prescribe
p40
aVto a patient with this or any of the numerous solid tumors
p41
aVcaused by these three ...
p42
aVHorsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer.
p43
aVThere's no ras, no myc, no p53 drug.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd you might fairly ask: Why is that?
p46
aVAnd the very unsatisfying yet scientific answer is:
p47
aVit's too hard.
p48
aVThat for whatever reason,
p49
aVthese three proteins have entered a space, in the language of our field,
p50
aVthat's called the undruggable genome \u2014
p51
aVwhich is like calling a computer unsurfable
p52
aVor the Moon unwalkable.
p53
aVIt's a horrible term of trade.
p54
aVBut what it means
p55
aVis that we've failed to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins,
p56
aVinto which we, like molecular locksmiths,
p57
aVcan fashion an active, small, organic molecule or drug substance.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, as I was training in clinical medicine
p60
aVand hematology and oncology and stem-cell transplantation,
p61
aVwhat we had instead,
p62
aVcascading through the regulatory network at the FDA,
p63
aVwere these substances:
p64
aVarsenic,
p65
aVthalidomide,
p66
aVand this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard gas.
p67
aVAnd this is the 21st century.
p68
aVAnd so, I guess you'd say,
p69
aVdissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines,
p70
aVI went back to school, in chemistry,
p71
aVwith the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry
p72
aVand approaching it in the context of this brave new world
p73
aVof the open source,
p74
aVthe crowd source,
p75
aVthe collaborative network that we have access to within academia,
p76
aVthat we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies
p77
aVto our patients.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd so, please consider this a work in progress,
p80
aVbut I'd like to tell you today a story
p81
aVabout a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma,
p82
aVabout the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer,
p83
aVcalled BRD4,
p84
aVand about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
p85
aVcalled JQ1,
p86
aVwhich we affectionately named for Jun Qi,
p87
aVthe chemist that made this molecule.
p88
aVNow, BRD4 is an interesting protein.
p89
aa(lp90
VYou might ask: with all the things cancer's trying to do to kill our patient,
p91
aVhow does it remember it's cancer?
p92
aVWhen it winds up its genome,
p93
aVdivides into two cells and unwinds again,
p94
aVwhy does it not turn into an eye, into a liver,
p95
aVas it has all the genes necessary to do this?
p96
aVIt remembers that it's cancer.
p97
aVAnd the reason is that cancer, like every cell in the body,
p98
aVplaces little molecular bookmarks,
p99
aVlittle Post-it notes,
p100
aVthat remind the cell, "I'm cancer; I should keep growing."
p101
aVAnd those Post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class \u2014
p102
aVso-called bromodomains.
p103
aVSo we developed an idea, a rationale,
p104
aVthat perhaps if we made a molecule
p105
aVthat prevented the Post-it note from sticking
p106
aVby entering into the little pocket
p107
aVat the base of this spinning protein,
p108
aVthen maybe we could convince cancer cells,
p109
aVcertainly those addicted to this BRD4 protein,
p110
aVthat they're not cancer.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd so we started to work on this problem.
p113
aVWe developed libraries of compounds
p114
aVand eventually arrived at this and similar substances
p115
aVcalled JQ1.
p116
aVNow, not being a drug company,
p117
aVwe could do certain things, we had certain flexibilities,
p118
aVthat I respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn't have.
p119
aVWe just started mailing it to our friends.
p120
aVI have a small lab.
p121
aVWe thought we'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves.
p122
aVWe sent it to Oxford, England,
p123
aVwhere a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture,
p124
aVwhich helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent
p125
aVfor this protein target.
p126
aVIt's what we call a perfect fit of shape complementarity,
p127
aVor hand in glove.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, this is a very rare cancer,
p130
aVthis BRD4-addicted cancer.
p131
aVAnd so we worked with samples of material
p132
aVthat were collected by young pathologists at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
p133
aVAnd as we treated these cells with this molecule,
p134
aVwe observed something really striking.
p135
aVThe cancer cells \u2014
p136
aVsmall, round and rapidly dividing,
p137
aVgrew these arms and extensions.
p138
aVThey were changing shape.
p139
aVIn effect,
p140
aVthe cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer
p141
aVand becoming a normal cell.
p142
aa(lp143
VThis got us very excited.
p144
aVThe next step would be to put this molecule into mice.
p145
aVThe only problem was there's no mouse model of this rare cancer.
p146
aVAnd so at the time we were doing this research,
p147
aVI was caring for a 29-year-old firefighter from Connecticut
p148
aVwho was very much at the end of life
p149
aVwith this incurable cancer.
p150
aVThis BRD4-addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung.
p151
aVAnd he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris.
p152
aVAnd every nursing shift, we would throw this material out.
p153
aVAnd so we approached this patient
p154
aVand asked if he would collaborate with us.
p155
aVCould we take this precious and rare cancerous material
p156
aVfrom this chest tube
p157
aVand drive it across town and put it into mice
p158
aVand try to do a clinical trial at a stage that with a prototype drug,
p159
aVwell, that would be, of course, impossible
p160
aVand, rightly, illegal to do in humans.
p161
aVAnd he obliged us.
p162
aVAt the Lurie Family Center for Animal Imaging,
p163
aVour colleague, Andrew Kung, grew this cancer successfully in mice
p164
aVwithout ever touching plastic.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd you can see this PET scan of a mouse \u2014 what we call a pet PET.
p167
aVThe cancer is growing
p168
aVas this red, huge mass in the hind limb of this animal.
p169
aVAnd as we treat it with our compound,
p170
aVthis addiction to sugar,
p171
aVthis rapid growth, faded.
p172
aVAnd on the animal on the right,
p173
aVyou see that the cancer was responding.
p174
aVWe've completed, now, clinical trials
p175
aVin four mouse models of this disease.
p176
aVAnd every time, we see the same thing.
p177
aVThe mice with this cancer that get the drug live,
p178
aVand the ones that don't rapidly perish.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo we started to wonder,
p181
aVwhat would a drug company do at this point?
p182
aVWell, they probably would keep this a secret
p183
aVuntil they turn the prototype drug
p184
aVinto an active pharmaceutical substance.
p185
aVSo we did just the opposite.
p186
aVWe published a paper that described this finding
p187
aVat the earliest prototype stage.
p188
aVWe gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule,
p189
aVtypically a secret in our discipline.
p190
aVWe told people exactly how to make it.
p191
aVWe gave them our email address,
p192
aVsuggesting that if they write us,
p193
aVwe'll send them a free molecule.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VWe basically tried to create the most competitive environment
p198
aVfor our lab as possible.
p199
aVAnd this was, unfortunately, successful.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VBecause now, we've shared this molecule,
p204
aVjust since December of last year,
p205
aVwith 40 laboratories in the United States
p206
aVand 30 more in Europe \u2014
p207
aVmany of them pharmaceutical companies,
p208
aVseeking now to enter this space,
p209
aVto target this rare cancer that, thankfully right now,
p210
aVis quite desirable to study in that industry.
p211
aVBut the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories
p212
aVabout the use of this molecule
p213
aVhas provided us insights we might not have had on our own.
p214
aVLeukemia cells treated with this compound
p215
aVturn into normal white blood cells.
p216
aVMice with multiple myeloma,
p217
aVan incurable malignancy of the bone marrow,
p218
aVrespond dramatically
p219
aVto the treatment with this drug.
p220
aVYou might know that fat has memory.
p221
aVI'll nicely demonstrate that for you.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VIn fact, this molecule
p226
aVprevents this adipocyte, this fat stem cell,
p227
aVfrom remembering how to make fat,
p228
aVsuch that mice on a high-fat diet,
p229
aVlike the folks in my hometown of Chicago \u2014
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
Vfail to develop fatty liver,
p234
aVwhich is a major medical problem.
p235
aa(lp236
VWhat this research taught us \u2014
p237
aVnot just my lab, but our institute,
p238
aVand Harvard Medical School more generally \u2014
p239
aVis that we have unique resources in academia
p240
aVfor drug discovery;
p241
aVthat our center, which has tested perhaps more cancer molecules
p242
aVin a scientific way
p243
aVthan any other,
p244
aVnever made one of its own.
p245
aVFor all the reasons you see listed here,
p246
aVwe think there's a great opportunity for academic centers
p247
aVto participate in this earliest, conceptually tricky
p248
aVand creative discipline
p249
aVof prototype drug discovery.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo what next?
p252
aVWe have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet.
p253
aVIt's not orally bioavailable.
p254
aVWe need to fix it so we can deliver it to our patients.
p255
aVAnd everyone in the lab,
p256
aVespecially following the interaction with these patients,
p257
aVfeels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance
p258
aVbased on this molecule.
p259
aVIt's here where I'd say
p260
aVthat we could use your help and your insights,
p261
aVyour collaborative participation.
p262
aVUnlike a drug company, we don't have a pipeline
p263
aVthat we can deposit these molecules into.
p264
aVWe don't have a team of salespeople and marketeers
p265
aVto tell us how to position this drug against the other.
p266
aVWhat we do have is the flexibility of an academic center
p267
aVto work with competent, motivated,
p268
aVenthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people
p269
aVto carry these molecules forward into the clinic
p270
aVwhile preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide.
p271
aa(lp272
VThis molecule will soon leave our benches
p273
aVand go into a small start-up company called Tensha Therapeutics.
p274
aVAnd, really, this is the fourth of these molecules
p275
aVto kind of "graduate" from our little pipeline
p276
aVof drug discovery,
p277
aVtwo of which \u2014 a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin
p278
aVand an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma \u2014
p279
aVwill actually come to the bedside for the first clinical trial
p280
aVin July of this year \u2014 for us, a major and exciting milestone.
p281
aVI want to leave you with just two ideas.
p282
aVThe first is: if anything is unique about this research,
p283
aVit's less the science than the strategy.
p284
aVThis, for us, was a social experiment \u2014
p285
aVan experiment in "What would happen if we were as open and honest
p286
aVat the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research
p287
aVas we could be?"
p288
aa(lp289
VThis string of letters and numbers
p290
aVand symbols and parentheses
p291
aVthat can be texted, I suppose,
p292
aVor Twittered worldwide,
p293
aVis the chemical identity of our pro compound.
p294
aVIt's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies,
p295
aVthe information on how these early prototype drugs might work.
p296
aVYet this information is largely a secret.
p297
aVAnd so we seek, really, to download
p298
aVfrom the amazing successes of the computer-science industry,
p299
aVtwo principles \u2014 that of open source and that of crowdsourcing \u2014
p300
aVto quickly, responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics
p301
aVto patients with cancer.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow, the business model involves all of you.
p304
aVThis research is funded by the public.
p305
aVIt's funded by foundations.
p306
aVAnd one thing I've learned in Boston
p307
aVis that you people will do anything for cancer, and I love that.
p308
aVYou bike across the state, you walk up and down the river.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VI've never seen, really, anywhere,
p313
aVthis unique support for cancer research.
p314
aVAnd so I want to thank you
p315
aVfor your participation, your collaboration
p316
aVand most of all,
p317
aVfor your confidence in our ideas.

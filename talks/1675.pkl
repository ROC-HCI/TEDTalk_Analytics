VSo here's the good news about families.
p5
aVThe last 50 years have seen a revolution
p6
aVin what it means to be a family.
p7
aVWe have blended families, adopted families,
p8
aVwe have nuclear families living in separate houses
p9
aVand divorced families living in the same house.
p10
aVBut through it all, the family has grown stronger.
p11
aVEight in 10 say the family they have today
p12
aVis as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, here's the bad news.
p15
aVNearly everyone is completely overwhelmed
p16
aVby the chaos of family life.
p17
aVEvery parent I know, myself included,
p18
aVfeels like we're constantly playing defense.
p19
aVJust when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.
p20
aVJust when they stop needing our help taking a bath,
p21
aVthey need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd here's the worst news of all.
p24
aVOur children sense we're out of control.
p25
aVEllen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute
p26
aVasked 1,000 children, "If you were granted
p27
aVone wish about your parents, what would it be?"
p28
aVThe parents predicted the kids would say,
p29
aVspending more time with them.
p30
aVThey were wrong. The kids' number one wish?
p31
aVThat their parents be less tired and less stressed.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo how can we change this dynamic?
p34
aVAre there concrete things we can do to reduce stress,
p35
aVdraw our family closer,
p36
aVand generally prepare our children to enter the world?
p37
aa(lp38
VI spent the last few years trying to answer that question,
p39
aVtraveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars,
p40
aVexperts ranging from elite peace negotiators
p41
aVto Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.
p42
aVI was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right
p43
aVand what can I learn from them to make my family happier?
p44
aa(lp45
VI want to tell you about one family that I met,
p46
aVand why I think they offer clues.
p47
aVAt 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho,
p48
aVwhere the six members of the Starr family are sitting down
p49
aVto the highlight of their week: the family meeting.
p50
aVThe Starrs are a regular American family
p51
aVwith their share of regular American family problems.
p52
aVDavid is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care
p53
aVof their four children, ages 10 to 15.
p54
aVOne of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.
p55
aVOne has lacrosse on the near side of town.
p56
aVOne has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.
p57
aa(lp58
V"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said.
p59
aa(lp60
VWhat the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.
p61
aVInstead of turning to friends or relatives,
p62
aVthey looked to David's workplace.
p63
aVThey turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development
p64
aVthat was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan
p65
aVto startups in Silicon Valley.
p66
aVIn agile, workers are organized into small groups
p67
aVand do things in very short spans of time.
p68
aVSo instead of having executives issue grand proclamations,
p69
aVthe team in effect manages itself.
p70
aVYou have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.
p71
aVYou have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.
p72
aVDavid said when they brought this system into their home,
p73
aVthe family meetings in particular increased communication,
p74
aVdecreased stress, and made everybody
p75
aVhappier to be part of the family team.
p76
aVWhen my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques
p77
aVinto the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters,
p78
aVit was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.
p79
aVAnd these meetings had this effect
p80
aVwhile taking under 20 minutes.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo what is Agile, and why can it help
p83
aVwith something that seems so different, like families?
p84
aVIn 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist
p85
aVat a financial firm in New England.
p86
aVHe was very frustrated with how software got designed.
p87
aVCompanies followed the waterfall method, right,
p88
aVin which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down
p89
aVto programmers below,
p90
aVand no one had ever consulted the programmers.
p91
aVEighty-three percent of projects failed.
p92
aVThey were too bloated or too out of date
p93
aVby the time they were done.
p94
aVSutherland wanted to create a system where
p95
aVideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom
p96
aVand be adjusted in real time.
p97
aVHe read 30 years of Harvard Business Review
p98
aVbefore stumbling upon an article in 1986
p99
aVcalled "The New New Product Development Game."
p100
aVIt said that the pace of business was quickening \u2014
p101
aVand by the way, this was in 1986 \u2014
p102
aVand the most successful companies were flexible.
p103
aVIt highlighted Toyota and Canon
p104
aVand likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.
p105
aVAs Sutherland told me, we got to that article,
p106
aVand said, "That's it."
p107
aVIn Sutherland's system, companies don't use
p108
aVlarge, massive projects that take two years.
p109
aVThey do things in small chunks.
p110
aVNothing takes longer than two weeks.
p111
aVSo instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker
p112
aVand come back with a cell phone or a social network,"
p113
aVyou say, "You go off and come up with one element,
p114
aVthen bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."
p115
aVYou succeed or fail quickly.
p116
aVToday, agile is used in a hundred countries,
p117
aVand it's sweeping into management suites.
p118
aVInevitably, people began taking some of these techniques
p119
aVand applying it to their families.
p120
aVYou had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.
p121
aVEven the Sutherlands told me that they had
p122
aVan Agile Thanksgiving,
p123
aVwhere you had one group of people working on the food,
p124
aVone setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.
p125
aVSutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo let's take one problem that families face,
p128
aVcrazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.
p129
aVA key plank is accountability,
p130
aVso teams use information radiators,
p131
aVthese large boards in which everybody is accountable.
p132
aVSo the Starrs, in adapting this to their home,
p133
aVcreated a morning checklist
p134
aVin which each child is expected to tick off chores.
p135
aVSo on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs,
p136
aVpoured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair,
p137
aVand she sat there,
p138
aVkind of amiably talking to each of her children
p139
aVas one after the other they came downstairs,
p140
aVchecked the list, made themselves breakfast,
p141
aVchecked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher,
p142
aVrechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had,
p143
aVchecked the list once more, gathered their belongings,
p144
aVand made their way to the bus.
p145
aVIt was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house,
p148
aa(lp149
Vour kids needed way too much monitoring,
p150
aa(lp151
VEleanor looked at me.
p152
aa(lp153
V"That's what I thought," she said.
p154
aV"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.'
p155
aVBut I was wrong."
p156
aa(lp157
VSo I turned to David: "So why does it work?"
p158
aa(lp159
VHe said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."
p160
aVAnd he made a checkmark.
p161
aVHe said, "In the workplace, adults love it.
p162
aVWith kids, it's heaven."
p163
aa(lp164
VThe week we introduced a morning checklist into our house,
p165
aVit cut parental screaming in half. (Laughter)
p166
aVBut the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.
p167
aVSo following the agile model, we ask three questions:
p168
aVWhat worked well in our family this week,
p169
aVwhat didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?
p170
aVEveryone throws out suggestions
p171
aVand then we pick two to focus on.
p172
aVAnd suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.
p173
aVWhat worked well this week?
p174
aVGetting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.
p175
aVWhat didn't work well? Our math sheets,
p176
aVor greeting visitors at the door.
p177
aVLike a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.
p178
aVLike, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out,
p179
aVI mean at least not that are revealing.
p180
aVThis gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.
p181
aVBut the most surprising part was when we turned to,
p182
aVwhat are we going to work on in the week ahead?
p183
aVYou know, the key idea of agile is that
p184
aVteams essentially manage themselves,
p185
aVand it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.
p186
aVOur kids love this process.
p187
aVSo they would come up with all these ideas.
p188
aVYou know, greet five visitors at the door this week,
p189
aVget an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.
p190
aVKick someone, lose desserts for a month.
p191
aVIt turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.
p192
aVWe constantly have to kind of dial them back.
p193
aVNow look, naturally there's a gap between
p194
aVtheir kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week,
p195
aVbut the truth is it didn't really bother us.
p196
aVIt felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables
p197
aVthat wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.
p198
aa(lp199
VThree years later \u2014 our girls are almost eight now \u2014
p200
aVWe're still holding these meetings.
p201
aVMy wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo what did we learn?
p204
aVThe word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001
p205
aVwhen Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers
p206
aVmet in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.
p207
aVI think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.
p208
aVI've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.
p209
aVI'm proposing three planks.
p210
aa(lp211
VPlank number one: Adapt all the time.
p212
aa(lp213
VWhen I became a parent, I figured, you know what?
p214
aVWe'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.
p215
aVThat assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.
p216
aVWe can't. What's great about the agile system
p217
aVis you build in a system of change
p218
aVso that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.
p219
aVIt's like they say in the Internet world:
p220
aVif you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago,
p221
aVyou're doing the wrong thing.
p222
aVParents can learn a lot from that.
p223
aVBut to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.
p224
aVWe have to break parents out of this straitjacket
p225
aVthat the only ideas we can try at home
p226
aVare ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus
p227
aVor other family experts.
p228
aVThe truth is, their ideas are stale,
p229
aVwhereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas
p230
aVto make groups and teams work effectively.
p231
aa(lp232
VLet's just take a few examples.
p233
aVLet's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.
p234
aVEverybody knows that having family dinner
p235
aVwith your children is good for the kids.
p236
aVBut for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.
p237
aVI met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said,
p238
aV"No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.
p239
aVI'm not home, can't make family dinner?
p240
aVWe'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack.
p241
aVWe'll make Sunday meals more important."
p242
aVAnd the truth is, recent research backs him up.
p243
aVIt turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time
p244
aVin any family meal.
p245
aVThe rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup."
p246
aVYou can take that 10 minutes and move it
p247
aVto any part of the day and have the same benefit.
p248
aVSo time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability.
p249
aa(lp250
VAn environmental psychologist told me,
p251
aV"If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface,
p252
aVyou'll be more rigid.
p253
aVIf you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."
p254
aVShe told me, "When you're discipling your children,
p255
aVsit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.
p256
aVThe conversation will go better."
p257
aVMy wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations
p258
aVbecause I was sitting above in the power position.
p259
aVSo move where you sit. That's adaptability.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe point is there are all these new ideas out there.
p262
aVWe've got to hook them up with parents.
p263
aVSo plank number one: Adapt all the time.
p264
aVBe flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.
p265
aa(lp266
VPlank number two: Empower your children.
p267
aVOur instinct as parents is to order our kids around.
p268
aVIt's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.
p269
aVThere's a reason that few systems have been more
p270
aVwaterfall over time than the family.
p271
aVBut the single biggest lesson we learned
p272
aVis to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.
p273
aVEnlist the children in their own upbringing.
p274
aVJust yesterday, we were having our family meeting,
p275
aVand we had voted to work on overreacting.
p276
aVSo we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?"
p277
aVSo one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.
p278
aVSo we kind of liked that.
p279
aVBut then her sister started working the system.
p280
aVShe said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction
p281
aVor can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"
p282
aVI loved that. Spend the time however you want.
p283
aVNow give us a punishment. Okay.
p284
aVIf we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.
p285
aVEvery minute above that, we have to do one pushup.
p286
aVSo you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax.
p287
aVThere's plenty of parental authority going on.
p288
aVBut we're giving them practice becoming independent,
p289
aVwhich of course is our ultimate goal.
p290
aVJust as I was leaving to come here tonight,
p291
aVone of my daughters started screaming.
p292
aVThe other one said, "Overreaction! Overreaction!"
p293
aVand started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.
p294
aVTo me that is a certified agile miracle.
p295
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p296
aVAnd by the way, research backs this up too.
p297
aVChildren who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules,
p298
aVevaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex
p299
aVand take more control over their lives.
p300
aVThe point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms,
p301
aVand yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.
p302
aVI was talking to Warren Buffett's banker,
p303
aVand he was chiding me for not letting my children
p304
aVmake mistakes with their allowance.
p305
aVAnd I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"
p306
aVHe said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch
p307
aVwith a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary
p308
aVor a $6 million inheritance."
p309
aVSo the bottom line is, empower your children.
p310
aa(lp311
VPlank number three: Tell your story.
p312
aVAdaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.
p313
aVJim Collins, the author of "Good To Great,"
p314
aVtold me that successful human organizations of any kind
p315
aVhave two things in common:
p316
aVthey preserve the core, they stimulate progress.
p317
aVSo agile is great for stimulating progress,
p318
aVbut I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.
p319
aVSo how do you do that?
p320
aVCollins coached us on doing something
p321
aVthat businesses do, which is define your mission
p322
aVand identify your core values.
p323
aVSo he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.
p324
aVWe did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.
p325
aVWe had a pajama party.
p326
aVI made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two.
p327
aVMy wife bought a flip chart.
p328
aVAnd we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?
p329
aVWhat values do we most uphold?
p330
aVAnd we ended up with 10 statements.
p331
aVWe are travelers, not tourists.
p332
aVWe don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.
p333
aVAgain, research shows that parents should spend less time
p334
aVworrying about what they do wrong
p335
aVand more time focusing on what they do right,
p336
aVworry less about the bad times and build up the good times.
p337
aVThis family mission statement is a great way to identify
p338
aVwhat it is that you do right.
p339
aa(lp340
VA few weeks later, we got a call from the school.
p341
aVOne of our daughters had gotten into a spat.
p342
aVAnd suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?
p343
aVAnd we didn't really know what to do,
p344
aVso we called her into my office.
p345
aVThe family mission statement was on the wall,
p346
aVand my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?"
p347
aVAnd she kind of looked down the list, and she said,
p348
aV"Bring people together?"
p349
aVSuddenly we had a way into the conversation.
p350
aa(lp351
VAnother great way to tell your story
p352
aVis to tell your children where they came from.
p353
aVResearchers at Emory gave children a simple
p354
aV"what do you know" test.
p355
aVDo you know where your grandparents were born?
p356
aVDo you know where your parents went to high school?
p357
aVDo you know anybody in your family
p358
aVwho had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?
p359
aVThe children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale
p360
aVhad the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.
p361
aVThe "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor
p362
aVof emotional health and happiness.
p363
aVAs the author of the study told me,
p364
aVchildren who have a sense of \u2014 they're part of a larger narrative
p365
aVhave greater self-confidence.
p366
aVSo my final plank is, tell your story.
p367
aVSpend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments
p368
aVand how you overcame the negative ones.
p369
aVIf you give children this happy narrative,
p370
aVyou give them the tools to make themselves happier.
p371
aa(lp372
VI was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina"
p373
aVand its famous opening sentence,
p374
aV"All happy families are alike.
p375
aVEach unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."
p376
aVWhen I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.
p377
aVOf course all happy families aren't alike."
p378
aVBut as I began working on this project,
p379
aVI began changing my mind.
p380
aVRecent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time,
p381
aVto identify the building blocks
p382
aVthat successful families have.
p383
aVI've mentioned just three here today:
p384
aVAdapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.
p385
aVIs it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?
p386
aVThe answer, I believe, is yes.
p387
aVWhen Leo Tolstoy was five years old,
p388
aVhis brother Nikolay came to him
p389
aVand said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness
p390
aVon a little green stick, which he had hidden
p391
aVin a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.
p392
aVIf the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.
p393
aVTolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.
p394
aVIn fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.
p395
aVHe still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.
p396
aVThat story perfectly captures for me
p397
aVthe final lesson that I learned:
p398
aVHappiness is not something we find,
p399
aVit's something we make.
p400
aVAlmost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations
p401
aVhas come to pretty much the same conclusion.
p402
aVGreatness is not a matter of circumstance.
p403
aVIt's a matter of choice.
p404
aVYou don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall.
p405
aVYou just need to take small steps,
p406
aVaccumulate small wins,
p407
aVkeep reaching for that green stick.
p408
aVIn the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.
p409
aVWhat's the secret to a happy family? Try.

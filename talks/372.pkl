VI dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design;
p5
aVI happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.
p6
aVBut what we're going to talk about today
p7
aVis really design. Really good designers are like sponges:
p8
aVthey really are curious
p9
aVand absorb every kind of information that comes their way,
p10
aVand transform it so that it can be used by people like us.
p11
aVAnd so that gives me an opportunity,
p12
aVbecause every design show that I curate
p13
aVkind of looks at a different world. And it's great,
p14
aVbecause it seems like every time I change jobs.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview
p17
aVof the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called
p18
aV"Design and the Elastic Mind."
p19
aVThe world that I decided to focus on this particular time
p20
aVis the world of science and the world of technology.
p21
aVTechnology always comes into play when design is involved,
p22
aVbut science does a little less.
p23
aVBut designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen
p24
aVand transforming them so that we can use them.
p25
aVAnd this is what this exhibition looks at.
p26
aa(lp27
VIf you think about your life today,
p28
aVyou go every day through many different scales,
p29
aVmany different changes of rhythm and pace.
p30
aVYou work over different time zones, you talk to very different people,
p31
aVyou multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.
p32
aVSome of the minds in this audience are super elastic,
p33
aVothers are a little slower,
p34
aVothers have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless
p35
aVthis is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint.
p36
aVOther people are not as elastic.
p37
aVI can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.
p38
aVHe doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home.
p39
aVAnd that's because there's some little bit of fear,
p40
aVlittle bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms.
p41
aVSo designers work on this particular malaise that we have,
p42
aVthese kinds of discomforts that we have,
p43
aVand try to make life easier for us.
p44
aVElasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know,
p45
aVwe really need, we really cherish and we really work on.
p46
aVAnd this exhibition is about the work of designers
p47
aVthat help us be more elastic,
p48
aVand also of designers that really work on this elasticity
p49
aVas an opportunity. And one last thing is that
p50
aVit's not only designers, but it's also scientists.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd before I launch into the display of some of the slides
p53
aVand into the preview, I would like to point out
p54
aVthis beautiful detail about scientists and design.
p55
aVYou can say that the relationship between science and design
p56
aVgoes back centuries. You can of course talk about
p57
aVLeonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women \u2014
p58
aVand there's a gigantic history behind it.
p59
aVBut according to a really great science historian you might know,
p60
aVPeter Galison \u2014 he teaches at Harvard \u2014
p61
aVwhat nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics
p62
aVhave brought to designers is this renewed interest,
p63
aVthis real passion for design.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up,
p66
aVatom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers.
p67
aVAnd all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers,
p68
aVjust like designers are seeking scientists.
p69
aVIt's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate
p70
aVat MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine \u2014
p71
aVthat's now a multimedia company, you might know it \u2014
p72
aVwe founded about a year ago a monthly salon
p73
aVfor designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful.
p74
aVAnd Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others.
p75
aVAnd it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest \u2014
p76
aVyou know, scientists would tell designers,
p77
aVyou know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.
p78
aVAnd designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation,
p79
aVI don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden
p80
aVthey really started talking each others' language,
p81
aVand now we're already at the point that they collaborate.
p82
aa(lp83
VPaul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York,
p84
aVand Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation
p85
aVin London at the Serpentine.
p86
aVAnd it's really interesting to see how this happens.
p87
aVThe exhibition will talk about the work
p88
aVof both designers and scientists,
p89
aVand show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us.
p90
aVI'm showing to you
p91
aVdifferent sections of the show right now,
p92
aVjust to give you a taste of it.
p93
aVNanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance,
p94
aVhave really opened the designer's mind.
p95
aVIn this case I'm showing more the designers' work,
p96
aVbecause they're the ones that have really been stimulated.
p97
aVA lot of the objects in the show are concepts,
p98
aVnot objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here
p99
aVis the work of some scientists from UCLA.
p100
aVThis kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins \u2014
p101
aVnot only by color but literally by alphabet letters.
p102
aVSo they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms
p103
aa(lp104
Vat the nanoscale. This is the work of design students
p105
aVfrom the Royal College of Arts in London
p106
aVthat have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne,
p107
aVand with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain
p108
aVon the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future.
p109
aVNew sensing elements on the body \u2014
p110
aVyou can grow hairs on your nails,
p111
aVand therefore grab some of the particles from another person.
p112
aVThey seem very, very obsessed
p113
aVwith finding out more about the ideal mate.
p114
aVSo they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell \u2014
p115
aVeverything they can, in order to find the perfect mate.
p116
aa(lp117
VVery interesting. This is a typeface designer
p118
aVfrom Israel who has designed \u2014 he calls them "typosperma."
p119
aVHe's thinking \u2014 of course it's all a concept \u2014
p120
aVof injecting typefaces into spermatozoa,
p121
aVI don't know how to say it in English \u2014 spermatazoi \u2014
p122
aVin order to make them become \u2014 to almost have a song
p123
aVor a whole poem written with every ejaculation. (Laughter)
p124
aVI tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo, tissue design.
p127
aVIn this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers.
p128
aVThis here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts.
p129
aVThe RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.
p130
aVOne of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat.
p131
aVYou know that already you can grow meat in vitro.
p132
aVIn Australia they did it \u2014 this research company, called SymbioticA.
p133
aVBut the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.
p134
aVAnd so, the assignment to the students was,
p135
aVhow should the steak of tomorrow be?
p136
aVWhen you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape,
p137
aVwhat should it be like?
p138
aVSo this particular student, James King,
p139
aVwent around the beautiful English countryside,
p140
aVpicked the best, best cow that he could see,
p141
aVand then put her in the MRI machine.
p142
aVThen, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat \u2014
p143
aVof course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker,
p144
aVbut you know, in the future it could be made better \u2014
p145
aVwhich reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find.
p146
aa(lp147
VInstead, this element here is much more banal.
p148
aVSomething that you know can be done already
p149
aVis to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring
p150
aVout of the bone tissue of your loved one \u2014 literally.
p151
aVSo, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.
p152
aa(lp153
VThis is SymbioticA, and they've been working \u2014
p154
aVthey were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat \u2014
p155
aVand now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat.
p156
aVIt's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one.
p157
aVSo, we'll be able to really not have any excuse
p158
aVto be wearing everything leather in the future.
p159
aa(lp160
VOne of the most important topics of the show \u2014 you know,
p161
aVas anything in our life today,
p162
aVwe can look at it from many, many different viewpoints,
p163
aVand at different levels.
p164
aVOne of the most interesting and most important concepts
p165
aVis the idea of scale. We change scale very often:
p166
aVwe change resolution of screens, and
p167
aVwe're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.
p168
aVSo you go, even in the exhibition,
p169
aVfrom the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale
p170
aVto the manipulation of really great amounts of data \u2014
p171
aVthe mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world.
p172
aVIn this particular case a section will be devoted
p173
aVto information design.
p174
aVYou see here the work of Ben Fry. This is "Human vs. Chimps" \u2014
p175
aVthe few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps.
p176
aVIt was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.
p177
aVAnd here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized
p178
aVwith all the go-to, go-back-to,
p179
aValso made into a beautiful choreography.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd then also graphs by scientists,
p182
aVthis beautiful diagraph of protein homology.
p183
aVScientists are starting to also consider aesthetics.
p184
aVWe were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning
p185
aVthe fact that many scientists
p186
aVtend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations,
p187
aVotherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes.
p188
aVSo they pick the worst background
p189
aVfrom any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface.
p190
aVIt's only recently that this kind of marriage
p191
aVbetween design and science is producing some of the first "pretty" \u2014
p192
aVif we can say so \u2014 scientific presentations.
p193
aVAnother aspect of contemporary design
p194
aVthat I think is mind-opening, promising
p195
aVand will really be the future of design,
p196
aVis the idea of collective design.
p197
aVYou know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child,
p198
aVis based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking.
p199
aVSo, the more the merrier.
p200
aVThe more computers, the stronger the signal,
p201
aVand children work on the interface so that it's all based
p202
aVon doing things together, tasks together.
p203
aVSo the idea of collective design
p204
aVis something that will become even bigger in the future,
p205
aVand this is chosen as an example.
p206
aa(lp207
VRelated to the idea of collective design and to the new balance
p208
aVbetween the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity
p209
aVis the idea of existence maximum.
p210
aVThat's a term that I coined a few years ago
p211
aVwhile I was thinking of how pressed we are together,
p212
aVand at the same time how these small objects,
p213
aVlike the Walkman first and then the iPod,
p214
aVcreate bubbles of space around us that enable us
p215
aVto have a metaphysical space
p216
aVthat is much bigger than our physical space.
p217
aVYou can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated
p218
aVand have your own room in your iPod.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd this is the work of several designers
p221
aVthat really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion
p222
aVby means of various techniques.
p223
aVThis is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult
p224
aVto have a private conversation anywhere
p225
aVthat you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial,
p226
aVmaybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool
p227
aVwith this perfect temperature, and you can have
p228
aVthis isolation tank phone conversation
p229
aVwith whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.
p230
aVAnd same thing here, Social Tele-presence.
p231
aVIt's actually already used by the military a little bit,
p232
aVbut it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else
p233
aVwith your senses while you're removed from it physically.
p234
aVAnd this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear],
p235
aVso if you're too shy to be really at the date,
p236
aVyou can stay at a distance with your flowers
p237
aVand somebody else reenacts the date for you.
p238
aa(lp239
VRapid manufacturing is another big area
p240
aVin which technology and design are, I think,
p241
aVbound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times.
p242
aVRapid manufacturing is a computer file
p243
aVsent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine.
p244
aVIt used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling.
p245
aVIt started out in the '80s, but at the beginning
p246
aVit was machines carving out of a foam block
p247
aVa model that was very, very fragile,
p248
aVand could not have any real use.
p249
aVSlowly but surely, the materials became better \u2014 better resins.
p250
aVTechniques became better \u2014 not only carving
p251
aVbut also stereolithography and laser \u2014 solidifying all kinds of resins,
p252
aVwhether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger,
p253
aVto the point that now we can have actual chairs
p254
aVmade by rapid manufacturing.
p255
aVIt takes seven days today to manufacture a chair,
p256
aVbut you know what? One day it will take seven hours.
p257
aVAnd then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home,
p258
aVcustomize your chair. You know, companies and designers
p259
aVwill be designing the matrix or the margins
p260
aVthat respect both solidity and brand, and design identity.
p261
aVAnd then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner
p262
aa(lp263
Vand go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous,
p264
aVnot only regarding the participation of the final buyer
p265
aVin the design process, but also no tracking,
p266
aVno warehousing, no wasted materials.
p267
aVAlso, I can imagine many design manufacturers
p268
aVwill have to retool their own business plans
p269
aVand maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change.
p270
aVAnd here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine \u2014
p271
aVyou know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much \u2014
p272
aVthat shows you can have your desktop 3D printer
p273
aVand print your own basketball.
p274
aVBut here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles,
p275
aVwhich is very interesting.
p276
aVThis is just a really nice touch \u2014 it's called slow prototyping.
p277
aVIt's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase.
p278
aVThey had a particular shape that they had to stay in.
p279
aa(lp280
VMapping and tagging.
p281
aVAs the capacity of computers becomes really, really big,
p282
aVand the capacity of our mind not that much bigger,
p283
aVwe find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do
p284
aVin order to then retrace our path.
p285
aVAlso, we do it in order to share with other people.
p286
aVAgain, this communal sense of experience
p287
aVthat seems to be so important today.
p288
aVSo, various ways to map and tag
p289
aVare also the work of many designers nowadays.
p290
aVAlso, the senses \u2014 designers and scientists all work on trying to expand
p291
aVour senses capabilities so that we can achieve more.
p292
aVAnd also animal senses in a way.
p293
aa(lp294
VThis particular object that many people love so much
p295
aVis actually based on kind of a scientific experiment \u2014
p296
aVthe fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense,
p297
aVand so \u2014 much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer \u2014
p298
aVbees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex
p299
aVto detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy.
p300
aVAnd so this student at the RCA
p301
aVdesigned this beautiful blown-glass object
p302
aVwhere the bees move from one chamber to the other
p303
aVif they detect that particular smell
p304
aVthat signifies, in this case, pregnancy.
p305
aVAnother shape is made for cancer.
p306
aa(lp307
VDesign for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor
p308
aVthat designers have really shaped for themselves.
p309
aVSome designers don't design objects, products,
p310
aVthings that we're going to actually use,
p311
aVbut rather, they design scenarios that are object-based.
p312
aVThey're still very useful.
p313
aVThey help companies and other designers think better about the future.
p314
aVAnd usually they are accompanied by videos.
p315
aVThis is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby, "All the Robots."
p316
aVThose are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of.
p317
aVWe always think that robots will take care of us,
p318
aVand instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy.
p319
aVYou need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes
p320
aVfor about five minutes before it does something.
p321
aVAnother one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room,
p322
aVand starts shaking, so you have to calm it down.
p323
aVSo it's really a way to make us think more
p324
aVabout what robots mean to us.
p325
aVNoam Toran and "Accessories for Lonely Men":
p326
aVthe idea is that when you lose your loved one
p327
aVor you go through a bad breakup,
p328
aVwhat you miss the most are those annoying things
p329
aVthat you used to hate when you were with the other person.
p330
aVSo he designed all these series of accessories.
p331
aVThis one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night.
p332
aVThen there's another one that breathes on your neck.
p333
aVThere's another one that throws plates and breaks them.
p334
aVSo it's just this idea of what we really miss in life.
p335
aa(lp336
VElio Caccavale: he took the idea
p337
aVof those dolls that explain leukemia.
p338
aVHe's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation,
p339
aVand also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago.
p340
aVHe's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls
p341
aVthat explain to children where babies come from today.
p342
aVBecause it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees,
p343
aVand then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads,
p344
aVin-vitro \u2014 there's the whole idea
p345
aVof how babies can be made today that has changed.
p346
aVSo it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now.
p347
aa(lp348
VOne of the most beautiful things
p349
aVis that designers really work on life,
p350
aVeven though they take technology into account.
p351
aVAnd many designers have been working recently
p352
aVon the idea of death and mourning,
p353
aVand what we can do about it today with new technologies.
p354
aVOr how we should behave about it with new technologies.
p355
aVThese three objects over there are hard drives
p356
aVwith a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality
p357
aVvery, very beautiful sculpted artifacts
p358
aVthat contain the whole desktop and computer memory
p359
aVof somebody who passed away.
p360
aVSo instead of having only the pictures,
p361
aVyou will be able to put this object next to the computer
p362
aVand all of a sudden have, you know,
p363
aVGertrude's whole life and all of her files
p364
aVand her address book come alive.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, "AfterLife."
p367
aVIt's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife.
p368
aVSo to give them something tangible that shows that
p369
aVthere is something after death, they take the gastric juices
p370
aVof people who passed away and concentrate them,
p371
aVand put them into a battery that can actually be used
p372
aVto power flashlights. They also go \u2014 you know, sex toys, whatever.
p373
aVIt's quite amazing how these things can make you smile,
p374
aVcan make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes.
p375
aVBut I'm hoping that this particular exhibition
p376
aVwill be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going \u2014
p377
aVwhich is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance
p378
aVof where the world is going.
p379
aVThank you very much.

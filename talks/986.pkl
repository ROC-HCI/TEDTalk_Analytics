VI'm a visual artist,
p5
aVand I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
p6
aVI've been working with plastic bags,
p7
aVwhich I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork
p8
aVfor the last 20 years.
p9
aVI turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces
p10
aVand sculptures and installations.
p11
aVUpon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,
p12
aVsome of my work started to fissure
p13
aVand break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
p14
aVAnd I thought, "Great.
p15
aVIt's ephemeral just like us."
p16
aa(lp17
VUpon educating myself a little further about plastics,
p18
aVI actually realized this was a bad thing.
p19
aVIt's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits,
p20
aVbecause it's always still plastic.
p21
aVAnd what we're finding
p22
aVis that a lot of it is in the marine environment.
p23
aVI then, in the last few years,
p24
aVlearned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.
p25
aVAnd my initial reaction \u2014
p26
aVand I think this is a lot of people's first reaction
p27
aVto learning about it \u2014
p28
aVis, "Oh my God!
p29
aVWe've got to go out there and clean this thing up."
p30
aVSo I actually developed a proposal
p31
aVto go out with a cargo ship
p32
aVand two decommissioned fishing trawlers,
p33
aVa crane, a chipping machine
p34
aVand a cold-molding machine.
p35
aVAnd my intention was to go out to the gyre,
p36
aVraise awareness about this issue
p37
aVand begin to pick up the plastic,
p38
aVchip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks
p39
aVthat could potentially be used as building materials
p40
aVin underdeveloped communities.
p41
aa(lp42
VI began talking with people
p43
aVwho actually had been out to the gyre
p44
aVand were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment
p45
aVand upon doing so,
p46
aVI realized actually that cleaning it up
p47
aVwould be a very small drop in the bucket
p48
aVrelative to how much is being generated
p49
aVevery day around the world,
p50
aVand that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.
p51
aVAnd the bigger picture is:
p52
aVwe need to find a way to turn off the faucet.
p53
aVWe need to cut the spigot
p54
aVof single-use and disposable plastics,
p55
aVwhich are entering the marine environment every day
p56
aVon a global scale.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.
p59
aVI wasn't just concerned about plastic
p60
aVthat you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean \u2014
p61
aVof which I have learned there are now
p62
aV11 gyres, potentially, of plastic
p63
aVin five major oceans in the world.
p64
aVIt's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about \u2014
p65
aVit's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.
p66
aVI'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.
p67
aVAll of my beverages are packaged in plastic,
p68
aVeven at the health food market.
p69
aVI'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,
p70
aVand I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic
p71
aVinto us and into our bodies.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo I came together with a group of other people
p74
aVwho were all looking at this issue,
p75
aVand we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
p76
aVWe have many initiatives that we're working on,
p77
aVbut some of them are very basic.
p78
aVOne is: if 80 to 90 percent
p79
aVof what we're finding in the ocean \u2014
p80
aVof the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean \u2014 is plastic,
p81
aVthen why don't we call it what it is.
p82
aVIt's plastic pollution.
p83
aVRecycling \u2014 everybody kind of ends their books
p84
aVabout being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.
p85
aVYou put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.
p86
aVWhat is the reality of that?
p87
aVIn the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.
p88
aVAnd if you really look into it,
p89
aVparticularly when it comes to plastic bottles,
p90
aVmost of it is only down-cycled,
p91
aVor incinerated, or shipped to China.
p92
aVIt is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,
p93
aVwhile a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again
p94
aVor can be used again \u2014
p95
aVa plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo this is a big issue for us.
p98
aVAnother thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about
p99
aVis we've added a fourth R
p100
aVonto the front
p101
aVof the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's,
p102
aVand that is refuse.
p103
aVWhenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.
p104
aVAlternatives exist;
p105
aVsome of them are very old-school.
p106
aVI myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers
p107
aVand using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers
p108
aVto store food in.
p109
aVAnd I know that I am doing a service
p110
aVto myself and my family.
p111
aVIt's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle
p112
aVor a glass bottle,
p113
aVif you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle
p114
aVand fill that up with water or filtered water,
p115
aVversus purchasing plastic bottled water.
p116
aa(lp117
VI guess what I want to say to everybody here \u2014
p118
aVand I know that you guys know a lot about this issue \u2014
p119
aVis that this is a huge problem in the oceans,
p120
aVbut this is a problem that we've created as consumers
p121
aVand we can solve.
p122
aVWe can solve this by raising awareness of the issue
p123
aVand teaching people to choose alternatives.
p124
aVSo whenever possible, to choose alternatives
p125
aVto single-use plastics.
p126
aVWe can cut the stem \u2014 tide the stem of this
p127
aVinto our oceans
p128
aVand in doing so,
p129
aVsave our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.
p130
aa(lp131
VThank you. (Applause)

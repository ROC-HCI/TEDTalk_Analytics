VI'd like to talk today
p5
aVabout a powerful and fundamental aspect
p6
aVof who we are: our voice.
p7
aVEach one of us has a unique voiceprint
p8
aVthat reflects our age, our size,
p9
aVeven our lifestyle and personality.
p10
aVIn the words of the poet Longfellow,
p11
aV"the human voice is the organ of the soul."
p12
aVAs a speech scientist, I'm fascinated
p13
aVby how the voice is produced,
p14
aVand I have an idea for how it can be engineered.
p15
aVThat's what I'd like to share with you.
p16
aa(lp17
VI'm going to start by playing you a sample
p18
aVof a voice that you may recognize.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Recording) Stephen Hawking: "I would have thought
p21
aVit was fairly obvious what I meant."
p22
aa(lp23
VRupal Patel: That was the voice
p24
aVof Professor Stephen Hawking.
p25
aVWhat you may not know is that same voice
p26
aVmay also be used by this little girl
p27
aVwho is unable to speak
p28
aVbecause of a neurological condition.
p29
aVIn fact, all of these individuals
p30
aVmay be using the same voice,
p31
aVand that's because there's only a few options available.
p32
aVIn the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans
p33
aVwho are unable to speak,
p34
aVand many of whom use computerized devices
p35
aVto communicate.
p36
aVNow that's millions of people worldwide
p37
aVwho are using generic voices,
p38
aVincluding Professor Hawking,
p39
aVwho uses an American-accented voice.
p40
aVThis lack of individuation of the synthetic voice
p41
aVreally hit home
p42
aVwhen I was at an assistive technology conference
p43
aVa few years ago,
p44
aVand I recall walking into an exhibit hall
p45
aVand seeing a little girl and a grown man
p46
aVhaving a conversation using their devices,
p47
aVdifferent devices, but the same voice.
p48
aVAnd I looked around and I saw this happening
p49
aVall around me, literally hundreds of individuals
p50
aVusing a handful of voices,
p51
aVvoices that didn't fit their bodies
p52
aVor their personalities.
p53
aVWe wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl
p54
aVwith the prosthetic limb of a grown man.
p55
aVSo why then the same prosthetic voice?
p56
aVIt really struck me,
p57
aVand I wanted to do something about this.
p58
aa(lp59
VI'm going to play you now a sample
p60
aVof someone who has, two people actually,
p61
aVwho have severe speech disorders.
p62
aVI want you to take a listen to how they sound.
p63
aVThey're saying the same utterance.
p64
aa(lp65
V(First voice)
p66
aa(lp67
V(Second voice)
p68
aVYou probably didn't understand what they said,
p69
aVbut I hope that you heard
p70
aVtheir unique vocal identities.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo what I wanted to do next is,
p73
aVI wanted to find out how we could harness
p74
aVthese residual vocal abilities
p75
aVand build a technology
p76
aVthat could be customized for them,
p77
aVvoices that could be customized for them.
p78
aVSo I reached out to my collaborator, Tim Bunnell.
p79
aVDr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis,
p80
aVand what he'd been doing is building
p81
aVpersonalized voices for people
p82
aVby putting together
p83
aVpre-recorded samples of their voice
p84
aVand reconstructing a voice for them.
p85
aVThese are people who had lost their voice
p86
aVlater in life.
p87
aVWe didn't have the luxury
p88
aVof pre-recorded samples of speech
p89
aVfor those born with speech disorder.
p90
aVBut I thought, there had to be a way
p91
aVto reverse engineer a voice
p92
aVfrom whatever little is left over.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo we decided to do exactly that.
p95
aVWe set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation,
p96
aVto create custom-crafted voices that captured
p97
aVtheir unique vocal identities.
p98
aVWe call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D.,
p99
aVfor vocal identity.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow before I get into the details of how
p102
aVthe voice is made and let you listen to it,
p103
aVI need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay?
p104
aVSo first, we know that the voice is changing
p105
aVdramatically over the course of development.
p106
aVChildren sound different from teens
p107
aVwho sound different from adults.
p108
aVWe've all experienced this.
p109
aVFact number two is that speech
p110
aVis a combination of the source,
p111
aVwhich is the vibrations generated by your voice box,
p112
aVwhich are then pushed through
p113
aVthe rest of the vocal tract.
p114
aVThese are the chambers of your head and neck
p115
aVthat vibrate,
p116
aVand they actually filter that source sound
p117
aVto produce consonants and vowels.
p118
aVSo the combination of source and filter
p119
aVis how we produce speech.
p120
aVAnd that happens in one individual.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow I told you earlier that I'd spent
p123
aVa good part of my career
p124
aVunderstanding and studying
p125
aVthe source characteristics of people
p126
aVwith severe speech disorder,
p127
aVand what I've found
p128
aVis that even though their filters were impaired,
p129
aVthey were able to modulate their source:
p130
aVthe pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice.
p131
aVThese are called prosody, and I've been documenting for years
p132
aVthat the prosodic abilities of these individuals
p133
aVare preserved.
p134
aVSo when I realized that those same cues
p135
aVare also important for speaker identity,
p136
aVI had this idea.
p137
aVWhy don't we take the source
p138
aVfrom the person we want the voice to sound like,
p139
aVbecause it's preserved,
p140
aVand borrow the filter
p141
aVfrom someone about the same age and size,
p142
aVbecause they can articulate speech,
p143
aVand then mix them?
p144
aVBecause when we mix them,
p145
aVwe can get a voice that's as clear
p146
aVas our surrogate talker \u2014
p147
aVthat's the person we borrowed the filter from\u2014
p148
aVand is similar in identity to our target talker.
p149
aVIt's that simple.
p150
aVThat's the science behind what we're doing.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo once you have that in mind,
p153
aVhow do you go about building this voice?
p154
aVWell, you have to find someone
p155
aVwho is willing to be a surrogate.
p156
aVIt's not such an ominous thing.
p157
aVBeing a surrogate donor
p158
aVonly requires you to say a few hundred
p159
aVto a few thousand utterances.
p160
aVThe process goes something like this.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Video) Voice: Things happen in pairs.
p163
aa(lp164
VI love to sleep.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe sky is blue without clouds.
p167
aa(lp168
VRP: Now she's going to go on like this
p169
aVfor about three to four hours,
p170
aVand the idea is not for her to say everything
p171
aVthat the target is going to want to say,
p172
aVbut the idea is to cover all the different combinations
p173
aVof the sounds that occur in the language.
p174
aVThe more speech you have,
p175
aVthe better sounding voice you're going to have.
p176
aVOnce you have those recordings,
p177
aVwhat we need to do
p178
aVis we have to parse these recordings
p179
aVinto little snippets of speech,
p180
aVone- or two-sound combinations,
p181
aVsometimes even whole words
p182
aVthat start populating a dataset or a database.
p183
aVWe're going to call this database a voice bank.
p184
aVNow the power of the voice bank
p185
aVis that from this voice bank,
p186
aVwe can now say any new utterance,
p187
aVlike, "I love chocolate" \u2014
p188
aVeveryone needs to be able to say that\u2014
p189
aVfish through that database
p190
aVand find all the segments necessary
p191
aVto say that utterance.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Video) Voice: I love chocolate.
p194
aa(lp195
VRP: So that's speech synthesis.
p196
aVIt's called concatenative synthesis, and that's what we're using.
p197
aVThat's not the novel part.
p198
aVWhat's novel is how we make it sound
p199
aVlike this young woman.
p200
aa(lp201
VThis is Samantha.
p202
aVI met her when she was nine,
p203
aVand since then, my team and I
p204
aVhave been trying to build her a personalized voice.
p205
aVWe first had to find a surrogate donor,
p206
aVand then we had to have Samantha
p207
aVproduce some utterances.
p208
aVWhat she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds,
p209
aVbut that's enough for us to extract
p210
aVher source characteristics.
p211
aVWhat happens next is best described
p212
aVby my daughter's analogy. She's six.
p213
aVShe calls it mixing colors to paint voices.
p214
aVIt's beautiful. It's exactly that.
p215
aVSamantha's voice is like a concentrated sample
p216
aVof red food dye which we can infuse
p217
aVinto the recordings of her surrogate
p218
aVto get a pink voice just like this.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Video) Samantha: Aaaaaah.
p221
aa(lp222
VRP: So now, Samantha can say this.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Video) Samantha: This voice is only for me.
p225
aVI can't wait to use my new voice with my friends.
p226
aa(lp227
VRP: Thank you. (Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VI'll never forget the gentle smile
p230
aVthat spread across her face
p231
aVwhen she heard that voice for the first time.
p232
aVNow there's millions of people
p233
aVaround the world like Samantha, millions,
p234
aVand we've only begun to scratch the surface.
p235
aVWhat we've done so far is we have
p236
aVa few surrogate talkers from around the U.S.
p237
aVwho have donated their voices,
p238
aVand we have been using those
p239
aVto build our first few personalized voices.
p240
aVBut there's so much more work to be done.
p241
aVFor Samantha, her surrogate
p242
aVcame from somewhere in the Midwest, a stranger
p243
aVwho gave her the gift of voice.
p244
aVAnd as a scientist, I'm so excited
p245
aVto take this work out of the laboratory
p246
aVand finally into the real world
p247
aVso it can have real-world impact.
p248
aVWhat I want to share with you next
p249
aVis how I envision taking this work
p250
aVto that next level.
p251
aVI imagine a whole world of surrogate donors
p252
aVfrom all walks of life, different sizes, different ages,
p253
aVcoming together in this voice drive
p254
aVto give people voices
p255
aVthat are as colorful as their personalities.
p256
aVTo do that as a first step,
p257
aVwe've put together this website, VocaliD.org,
p258
aVas a way to bring together those
p259
aVwho want to join us as voice donors,
p260
aVas expertise donors,
p261
aVin whatever way to make this vision a reality.
p262
aa(lp263
VThey say that giving blood can save lives.
p264
aVWell, giving your voice can change lives.
p265
aVAll we need is a few hours of speech
p266
aVfrom our surrogate talker,
p267
aVand as little as a vowel from our target talker,
p268
aVto create a unique vocal identity.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo that's the science behind what we're doing.
p271
aVI want to end by circling back to the human side
p272
aVthat is really the inspiration for this work.
p273
aVAbout five years ago, we built our very first voice
p274
aVfor a little boy named William.
p275
aVWhen his mom first heard this voice,
p276
aVshe said, "This is what William
p277
aVwould have sounded like
p278
aVhad he been able to speak."
p279
aVAnd then I saw William typing a message
p280
aVon his device.
p281
aVI wondered, what was he thinking?
p282
aVImagine carrying around someone else's voice
p283
aVfor nine years
p284
aVand finally finding your own voice.
p285
aVImagine that.
p286
aa(lp287
VThis is what William said:
p288
aV"Never heard me before."
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you.
p291

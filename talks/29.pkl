VYou'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy,
p5
aVbut other people's tragedy.
p6
aVIt's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy
p7
aVthan your own,
p8
aVand I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo, if you believe the media accounts,
p11
aVbeing a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic
p12
aVwas a very glamorous life, in the words of Virginia Postrel.
p13
aVThere was money, there was drugs, guns, women,
p14
aVyou know, you name it \u2014 jewelry, bling-bling \u2014 it had it all.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhat I'm going to tell you today is that, in fact, based on 10 years of research,
p17
aVa unique opportunity to go inside a gang \u2014
p18
aVto see the actual books, the financial records of the gang \u2014
p19
aVthat the answer turns out not to be
p20
aVthat being in the gang was a glamorous life.
p21
aVBut I think, more realistically, that being in a gang \u2014
p22
aVselling drugs for a gang \u2014 is perhaps the worst job in all of America.
p23
aVAnd that's what I'd like to convince you of today.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo there are three things I want to do.
p26
aVFirst, I want to explain how and why crack cocaine
p27
aVhad such a profound influence on inner-city gangs.
p28
aVSecondly, I want to tell you
p29
aVhow somebody like me came to be able to see
p30
aVthe inner workings of a gang \u2014 an interesting story, I think.
p31
aVAnd then third, I want to tell you, in a very superficial way,
p32
aVabout some of the things we found
p33
aVwhen we actually got to look at the financial records,
p34
aVthe books, of the gang.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo before I do that, just one warning,
p37
aVwhich is that this presentation has been rated 'R'
p38
aVby the Motion Picture Association of America.
p39
aVIt contains adult themes, adult language.
p40
aVGiven who is up on the stage, you'll be delighted to know
p41
aVthat, in fact, there'll be no nudity \u2014
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VUnexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo let me start by talking about crack cocaine,
p50
aVand how it transformed the gang.
p51
aVTo do that, you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine,
p52
aVin the early '80s, and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader.
p53
aVBeing a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s \u2014
p54
aVthe early '80s, let me say.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, you had a lot of power, and you got to beat people up \u2014
p57
aVyou got a lot of prestige, a lot of respect.
p58
aVBut the thing is, there was no money in it.
p59
aVThe gang had no way to make money.
p60
aVYou couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang,
p61
aVbecause the people in the gang didn't have any money.
p62
aVYou couldn't really make any money selling marijuana \u2014
p63
aVmarijuana's too cheap, it turns out.
p64
aVYou can't get rich selling marijuana.
p65
aVYou couldn't sell cocaine;
p66
aVcocaine's a great product \u2014 powdered cocaine \u2014
p67
aVbut you've got to know rich white people.
p68
aVAnd most of the inner-city gang members didn't know any rich white people,
p69
aVso couldn't sell to that market.
p70
aVYou couldn't really do petty crime, either.
p71
aVTurns out, petty crime's a terrible way to make a living.
p72
aa(lp73
VAs a result, as a gang leader, you had, you know, power \u2014
p74
aVit's a pretty good life \u2014 but the thing was, in the end,
p75
aVyou were living at home with your mother.
p76
aVAnd so it wasn't really a career.
p77
aVThere were limits to how powerful and important you could be
p78
aVif you had to live at home with your mother.
p79
aa(lp80
VThen along comes crack cocaine.
p81
aVAnd in the words of Malcolm Gladwell,
p82
aVcrack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce
p83
aVfor the inner city.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VBecause crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation.
p88
aVI don't have time to talk about it today, but if you think about it,
p89
aVI would say that in the last 25 years,
p90
aVof every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country,
p91
aVthe biggest one in terms of impact
p92
aVon the well-being of people who live in the inner city,
p93
aVwas crack cocaine.
p94
aVAnd for the worse \u2014 not for the better, but for the worse.
p95
aVIt had a huge impact on life.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo what was it about crack cocaine?
p98
aVIt was a brilliant way of getting the brain high.
p99
aVBecause you could smoke crack cocaine \u2014 you can't smoke powdered cocaine \u2014
p100
aVand smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high
p101
aVthan snorting it.
p102
aVAnd it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine,
p103
aVbut when it came, it really did.
p104
aVAnd it was a perfect drug;
p105
aVyou could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar,
p106
aVsell it for five dollars.
p107
aVHighly addictive \u2014 the high was very short.
p108
aVSo for fifteen minutes, you get this great high,
p109
aVand then when you come down,
p110
aVall you want to do is get high again.
p111
aa(lp112
VIt created a wonderful market.
p113
aVAnd for the people who were there running the gang,
p114
aVit was a great way, seemingly, to make a lot of money.
p115
aVAt least for the people on the top.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo this is where we enter the picture.
p118
aVNot really me \u2014 I'm really a bit player in all this.
p119
aVMy co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh, is the main character.
p120
aVHe was a math major in college who had a good heart,
p121
aVand decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD,
p122
aVcame to the University of Chicago.
p123
aVNow, the three months before he came to Chicago,
p124
aVhe had spent following the Grateful Dead.
p125
aVAnd in his own words, he "looked like a freak."
p126
aVHe's a South Asian \u2014 very dark-skinned South Asian.
p127
aVBig man, and he had hair, in his words, "down to his ass."
p128
aVDefied all kinds of boundaries:
p129
aVWas he black or white? Was he man or woman?
p130
aVHe was really a curious sight to be seen.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo he showed up at the University of Chicago,
p133
aVand the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson
p134
aVwas doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago.
p135
aVHe took one look at Sudhir, who was going to go do some surveys for him,
p136
aVand decided he knew exactly the place to send him,
p137
aVwhich was to one of the toughest, most notorious housing projects
p138
aVnot just in Chicago, but in the entire United States.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo Sudhir, the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city,
p141
aVdutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project,
p142
aVgets to the first building.
p143
aVThe first building? Well, there's nobody there.
p144
aVBut he hears some voices up in the stairwell,
p145
aVso he climbs up the stairwell, comes around the corner,
p146
aVand finds a group of young African-American men playing dice.
p147
aa(lp148
VThis is about 1990, peak of the crack epidemic.
p149
aVThis is a very dangerous job, being in a gang.
p150
aVYou don't like to be surprised.
p151
aVYou don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner.
p152
aVAnd the mantra was: shoot first; ask questions later.
p153
aVNow, Sudhir was lucky \u2014 he was such a freak,
p154
aVand that clipboard probably saved his life,
p155
aVbecause they figured no other rival gang member
p156
aVwould be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VSo his greeting was not particularly warm, but they did say,
p161
aVwell, OK \u2014 let's hear your questions on your survey.
p162
aVSo \u2014 I kid you not \u2014
p163
aVthe first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was:
p164
aV"How do you feel about being poor and Black in America?"
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VMakes you wonder about academics.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VSo the choice of answers were:
p173
aa(lp174
V[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad]
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VWhat Sudhir found out is, in fact, that the real answer was the following:
p179
aV[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad E) Fuck you]
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VThe survey was not, in the end, going to be what got Sudhir off the hook.
p184
aVHe was held hostage overnight in the stairwell.
p185
aVThere was a lot of gunfire,
p186
aVthere were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members.
p187
aVBy morning, the gang leader arrived,
p188
aVchecked out Sudhir, decided he was no threat,
p189
aVand they let him go home.
p190
aVSo Sudhir went home, took a shower, took a nap.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd you and I, probably, faced with the situation, would think,
p193
aV"I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead,
p194
aVI've been following them for the last three months."
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VSudhir, on the other hand,
p199
aVgot right back, walked down to the housing project,
p200
aVwent up to the second floor,
p201
aVand said: "Hey, guys, I had so much fun hanging out with you last night,
p202
aVI wonder if I could do it again tonight."
p203
aVAnd that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship
p204
aVthat involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for 10 years,
p205
aVhanging out in crack houses, going to jail with the gang members,
p206
aVhaving the windows shot out of his car,
p207
aVhaving the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks \u2014
p208
aVyou name it.
p209
aVBut ultimately, the story has a happy ending for Sudhir,
p210
aVwho became one of the most respected sociologists in the country.
p211
aVAnd especially for me,
p212
aVas I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open,
p213
aVwaiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data
p214
aVthat he would get from the gang.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VIt was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever \u2014
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VBut I was glad to be the beneficiary of it.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo what did we find?
p225
aVWhat did we find in the gang?
p226
aVWell, let me say one thing:
p227
aVWe really got access to everybody in the gang.
p228
aVWe got an inside look at the gang, from the very bottom up to the very top.
p229
aVThey trusted Sudhir, in ways that really no academic has ever \u2014
p230
aVor really anybody, any outsider \u2014 has ever earned the trust of these gangs,
p231
aVto the point where they actually opened up
p232
aVwhat was most interesting for me \u2014 their books,
p233
aVthe financial records they kept.
p234
aVThey made them available to us, and we not only could study them,
p235
aVbut we could ask them questions about what was in them.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have
p238
aVwhat the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is,
p239
aVit's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang
p240
aVand any other organization,
p241
aVit would be that the gang is just like McDonald's,
p242
aVin a lot of different respects \u2014 the restaurant McDonald's.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo first, in one way,
p245
aVwhich isn't maybe the most interesting way, but it's a good way to start \u2014
p246
aVis in the way it's organized, the hierarchy of the gang,
p247
aVthe way it looks.
p248
aVSo here's what the org chart of the gang looks like.
p249
aVI don't know if you know much about org charts,
p250
aVbut if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart,
p251
aVthis is exactly what it would look like.
p252
aVIt's amazing, but the top level of the gang,
p253
aVthey actually call themselves the "Board of Directors."
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd Sudhir says
p258
aVit's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view
p259
aVof what happened in American corporate life,
p260
aVbut they had seen movies like "Wall Street,"
p261
aVand they had learned a little bit about what it was like
p262
aVto be in the real world.
p263
aVNow, below that board of directors,
p264
aVyou've got essentially what are regional VPs \u2014
p265
aVpeople who control, say, the South Side of Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.
p266
aa(lp267
VSudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment
p268
aVof trying to take the Iowa franchise,
p269
aVwhich, it turned out, for this black gang,
p270
aVwas not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VBut the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees.
p275
aVThe guys who are running the local gangs \u2014
p276
aVthe four-square-block by four-square-block areas \u2014
p277
aVthey're just like the guys, in some sense, who are running the McDonald's.
p278
aVThey are the entrepreneurs.
p279
aVThey get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling.
p280
aVThey get the name of the gang behind them, for merchandising and marketing.
p281
aVAnd they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit,
p282
aVdepending on how good they are at running the business.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, the group I really want you to think about, though,
p285
aVare the ones at the bottom \u2014 the foot soldiers.
p286
aVThese are the teenagers, typically,
p287
aVwho'd be standing out on the street corner, selling the drugs.
p288
aVExtremely dangerous work.
p289
aVAnd important to note is that almost all of the weight, all of the people
p290
aVin this organization are at the bottom \u2014 just like McDonald's.
p291
aVSo in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people
p292
aVwho are taking your order at McDonald's,
p293
aVand it's not just by chance that they're like them.
p294
aVIn fact, in these neighborhoods, they'd be the same people.
p295
aVSo the same kids who are working in the gang were actually,
p296
aVat the very same time, typically working part-time
p297
aVat a place like McDonald's.
p298
aVWhich already foreshadows the main result that I've talked about,
p299
aVabout what a crappy job it was, being in the gang.
p300
aVBecause obviously, if being in the gang were such a wonderful, lucrative job,
p301
aVwhy in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's?
p302
aa(lp303
VSo what do the wages look like? You might be surprised.
p304
aVBut based on being able to talk to them and to see their records,
p305
aVthis is what it looks like in terms of the wages.
p306
aVThe hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 an hour.
p307
aVIt was below the minimum wage. And this is well-documented.
p308
aVIt's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have.
p309
aVIt really is not fiction \u2014 it's fact.
p310
aVThere was very little money in the gang, especially at the bottom.
p311
aa(lp312
VNow if you managed to rise up, say, and be that local leader,
p313
aVthe guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee,
p314
aVyou'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.
p315
aVAnd that, in some ways, was the best job you could hope to get
p316
aVif you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male.
p317
aVIf you managed to rise to the very top,
p318
aV200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year is what you'd hope to make.
p319
aVTruly, you would be a great success story.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd one of the sad parts of this is that, indeed,
p322
aVamong the many other ramifications of crack cocaine
p323
aVis that the most talented individuals in these communities \u2014
p324
aVthis is what they were striving for.
p325
aVThey weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways,
p326
aVbecause there were no legitimate channels out.
p327
aVThis was the best way out.
p328
aVAnd it actually was the right choice, probably,
p329
aVto try to make it out this way.
p330
aa(lp331
VYou look at this,
p332
aVthe relationship to McDonald's breaks down here.
p333
aVThe money looks about the same.
p334
aVWhy is it such a bad job?
p335
aVWell, the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you
p336
aVa lot of the time.
p337
aVSo, with shooting at you, what are the death rates?
p338
aVWe found, in our gang \u2014
p339
aVand admittedly, this was not really a standard situation;
p340
aVthis was a time of intense violence, of a lot of gang wars,
p341
aVas this gang actually became quite successful.
p342
aVBut there were costs.
p343
aVAnd so the death rate \u2014
p344
aVnot to mention the rate of being arrested, sent to prison, being wounded \u2014
p345
aVthe death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year.
p346
aVYou're in the gang for four years,
p347
aVyou expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood.
p348
aVThat is about as high as you can get.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo for comparison's purposes,
p351
aVlet's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky.
p352
aVLet's say that you were a murderer
p353
aVand you were convicted of murder, and you're sent to death row.
p354
aVIt turns out, the death rates on death row from all causes, including execution:
p355
aVtwo percent a year.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VSo it's a lot safer being on death row
p360
aVthan it is selling drugs out on the street.
p361
aa(lp362
VThat gives you some pause, for those of you who believe
p363
aVthat a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime.
p364
aVTo give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack \u2014
p365
aVand I'm not really focusing on the negatives,
p366
aVbut really, there's another story to tell you there \u2014
p367
aVif you look at the death rates just of random, young black males
p368
aVgrowing up in the inner city in the United States,
p369
aVthe death rates during crack were about one percent.
p370
aVThat's extremely high.
p371
aVAnd this is violent death \u2014 it's unbelievable, in some sense.
p372
aa(lp373
VTo put it into perspective: if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq,
p374
aVfor instance, right now fighting the war: 0.5 percent.
p375
aVSo in some very literal way,
p376
aVthe young black men who were growing up in this country
p377
aVwere living in a war zone,
p378
aVvery much in the sense that the soldiers over in Iraq are fighting in a war.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo why in the world, you might ask,
p381
aVwould anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner
p382
aVselling drugs for $3.50 an hour,
p383
aVwith a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years?
p384
aVWhy would they do that?
p385
aVAnd I think there are a couple answers.
p386
aa(lp387
VI think the first one is that they got fooled by history.
p388
aVIt used to be the gang was a rite of passage;
p389
aVthat the young people controlled the gang;
p390
aVthat as you got older, you dropped out of the gang.
p391
aVSo what happened was,
p392
aVthe people who happened to be in the right place at the right time \u2014
p393
aVthe people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid-to-late-'80s \u2014
p394
aVbecame very, very wealthy.
p395
aVAnd so the logical thing to think
p396
aVwas that they are going to age out of the gang
p397
aVlike everybody else has,
p398
aVand the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth.
p399
aa(lp400
VThere are striking similarities, I think, to the Internet boom.
p401
aVThe first set of people in Silicon Valley got very, very rich.
p402
aVAnd then all of my friends said, "Maybe I should go do that, too."
p403
aVAnd they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came.
p404
aVIn some sense, that's what happened, exactly,
p405
aVto the set of people we were looking at.
p406
aVThey were willing to start at the bottom,
p407
aVjust like, say, a first-year lawyer at a law firm
p408
aVis willing to start at the bottom,
p409
aVwork 80-hour weeks for not that much money,
p410
aVbecause they think they're going to make partner.
p411
aVBut the rules changed, and they never got to make partner.
p412
aa(lp413
VIndeed, the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s
p414
aVare still running the major gangs in Chicago today.
p415
aVThey never passed on any of the wealth,
p416
aVSo everybody got stuck at that $3.50-an-hour job,
p417
aVand it turned out to be a disaster.
p418
aa(lp419
VThe other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery.
p420
aVAnd so for instance, one thing the gang would do is \u2014
p421
aVthe gang leaders would have big entourages,
p422
aVand they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry.
p423
aVSo what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more,
p424
aVis that, really, they didn't own those cars \u2014 they just leased them,
p425
aVbecause they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars.
p426
aVAnd they didn't really have gold jewelry, they had gold-plated jewelry.
p427
aVIt goes back to, you know, the real-real versus the fake-real.
p428
aa(lp429
VAnd really, they did all sorts of things to trick the young people
p430
aVinto thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be.
p431
aVSo for instance, they would give a 14-year-old kid
p432
aVa whole roll of bills to hold.
p433
aVThat 14-year-old kid would say to his friends,
p434
aV"Hey, look at all the money I got in the gang."
p435
aVIt wasn't his money \u2014 until he spent it,
p436
aVand then he was in debt to the gang,
p437
aVand was sort of an indentured servant for a while.
p438
aVSo I have a couple minutes.
p439
aa(lp440
VLet me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do,
p441
aVwhich is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics,
p442
aVfrom the study of the gang.
p443
aa(lp444
VSo, economists tend to talk in technical words.
p445
aVOften, our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data,
p446
aVbut what's kind of interesting is that in this setting,
p447
aVit turned out that some of the economic theories
p448
aVthat worked not so well in the real economy
p449
aVworked very well in the drug economy,
p450
aVin some sense, because it's unfettered capitalism.
p451
aVHere's an economic principle.
p452
aVThis is one of the basic ideas in labor economics,
p453
aVcalled a "compensating differential."
p454
aVIt's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires
p455
aVto leave him indifferent between performing two tasks,
p456
aVone which is more unpleasant than the other.
p457
aVCompensating differential \u2014 it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more
p458
aVthan people who work in parks.
p459
aa(lp460
VThe words of one of the members of the gang, I think, make this clear.
p461
aVSo it turns out \u2014 I'm sort of getting ahead of myself \u2014
p462
aVit turns out, in the gang, when there's a war going on,
p463
aVthey actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money.
p464
aVIt's exactly this concept.
p465
aVBecause they're not willing to be at risk.
p466
aVAnd the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely, he says:
p467
aV"Would you stand around here when all this shit ..." \u2014 the shooting \u2014
p468
aV"... if all this shit's going on? No, right?
p469
aVSo if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line, then front me the cash, man."
p470
aVI think the gang member says it much more articulately
p471
aVthan the economist, about what's going on.
p472
aa(lp473
V(Laughter)
p474
aa(lp475
VHere's another one.
p476
aVEconomists talk about game theory,
p477
aVthat every two-person game has a Nash equilibrium.
p478
aVHere's the translation you get from the gang member.
p479
aVThey're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot \u2014
p480
aVOne thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang:
p481
aVif you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang's territory \u2014
p482
aVpeople are afraid to go buy drugs there,
p483
aVthey're going to come into your neighborhood.
p484
aa(lp485
VHere's what he says about why they don't do that:
p486
aV"If we start shooting around there, the other gang's territory,
p487
aVnobody, I mean, you dig it, nobody gonna step on their turf.
p488
aVBut we gotta be careful,
p489
aV'cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked."
p490
aa(lp491
V(Laughter)
p492
aa(lp493
VSo that's the same concept.
p494
aVThen again, sometimes economists get it wrong.
p495
aVOne thing we observed in the data is that it looked like \u2014
p496
aVthe gang leader always got paid.
p497
aVNo matter how bad it was economically, he always got himself paid.
p498
aa(lp499
VWe had some theories related to cash flow,
p500
aVand lack of access to capital markets, and things like that.
p501
aVThen we asked the gang member,
p502
aV"Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid?"
p503
aVHis response is,
p504
aV"You got all these niggers below you who want your job, you dig?
p505
aVIf you start taking losses, they see you as weak and shit."
p506
aVAnd I thought about it and said,
p507
aV"CEOs often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses,
p508
aVeven when companies are losing a lot of money.
p509
aVAnd it never would really occur to an economist
p510
aVthat this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important."
p511
aa(lp512
V(Laughter)
p513
aa(lp514
VMaybe "weak and shit" is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis.
p515
aa(lp516
VThank you very much.
p517

V(Applause)

VI want you to imagine
p5
aVwhat a breakthrough this was
p6
aVfor women who were victims of violence
p7
aVin the 1980s.
p8
aVThey would come into the emergency room
p9
aVwith what the police would call "a lovers' quarrel,"
p10
aVand I would see a woman who was beaten,
p11
aVI would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist
p12
aVand swollen eyes.
p13
aVAnd as activists, we would take our Polaroid camera,
p14
aVwe would take her picture,
p15
aVwe would wait 90 seconds,
p16
aVand we would give her the photograph.
p17
aVAnd she would then have
p18
aVthe evidence she needed to go to court.
p19
aVWe were making what was invisible visible.
p20
aa(lp21
VI've been doing this for 30 years.
p22
aVI've been part of a social movement
p23
aVthat has been working on ending
p24
aVviolence against women and children.
p25
aVAnd for all those years,
p26
aVI've had an absolutely passionate
p27
aVand sometimes not popular belief
p28
aVthat this violence is not inevitable,
p29
aVthat it is learned, and if it's learned,
p30
aVit can be un-learned, and it can be prevented.
p31
aV(Applause)
p32
aa(lp33
VWhy do I believe this?
p34
aVBecause it's true.
p35
aVIt is absolutely true.
p36
aVBetween 1993 and 2010,
p37
aVdomestic violence among adult women
p38
aVin the United States
p39
aVhas gone down by 64 percent,
p40
aVand that is great news.
p41
aV(Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
VSixty-four percent. Now, how did we get there?
p44
aVOur eyes were wide open.
p45
aVThirty years ago, women were beaten,
p46
aVthey were stalked, they were raped,
p47
aVand no one talked about it.
p48
aVThere was no justice.
p49
aVAnd as an activist, that was not good enough.
p50
aVAnd so step one on this journey
p51
aVis we organized,
p52
aVand we created this extraordinary
p53
aVunderground network of amazing women
p54
aVwho opened shelters,
p55
aVand if they didn't open a shelter,
p56
aVthey opened their home
p57
aVso that women and children could be safe.
p58
aVAnd you know what else we did?
p59
aVWe had bake sales, we had car washes,
p60
aVand we did everything we could do to fundraise,
p61
aVand then at one point we said,
p62
aVyou know, it's time that we went
p63
aVto the federal government
p64
aVand asked them to pay for these
p65
aVextraordinary services that are saving people's lives.
p66
aVRight? (Applause)
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd so, step number two,
p69
aVwe knew we needed to change the laws.
p70
aVAnd so we went to Washington,
p71
aVand we lobbied for the first piece of legislation.
p72
aVAnd I remember walking through the halls
p73
aVof the U.S. Capitol,
p74
aVand I was in my 30s, and my life had purpose,
p75
aVand I couldn't imagine
p76
aVthat anybody would ever challenge
p77
aVthis important piece of legislation.
p78
aVI was probably 30 and naive.
p79
aVBut I heard about a congressman
p80
aVwho had a very, very different point of view.
p81
aVDo you know what he called
p82
aVthis important piece of legislation?
p83
aVHe called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.
p84
aVThe Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.
p85
aVLadies and gentlemen, that was in 1984
p86
aVin the United States, and I wish I had Twitter.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VTen years later, after lots of hard work,
p90
aVwe finally passed the Violence Against Women Act,
p91
aVwhich is a life-changing act
p92
aVthat has saved so many lives. (Applause)
p93
aVThank you.
p94
aVI was proud to be part of that work,
p95
aVand it changed the laws
p96
aVand it put millions of dollars into local communities.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd you know what else it did? It collected data.
p99
aVAnd I have to tell you, I'm passionate about data.
p100
aVIn fact, I am a data nerd.
p101
aVI'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here.
p102
aVI am a data nerd,
p103
aVand the reason for that is I want to make sure
p104
aVthat if we spend a dollar, that the program works,
p105
aVand if it doesn't work, we should change the plan.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd I also want to say one other thing:
p108
aVWe are not going to solve this problem
p109
aVby building more jails
p110
aVor by even building more shelters.
p111
aVIt is about economic empowerment for women,
p112
aVit is about healing kids who are hurt,
p113
aVand it is about prevention with a capital P.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd so, step number three on this journey:
p116
aVWe know, if we're going to keep making this progress,
p117
aVwe're going to have to turn up the volume,
p118
aVwe're going to have to increase the visibility,
p119
aVand we're going to have to engage the public.
p120
aVAnd so knowing that, we went to the Advertising Council,
p121
aVand we asked them to help us
p122
aVbuild a public education campaign.
p123
aVAnd we looked around the world to Canada
p124
aVand Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa,
p125
aVand we took this knowledge
p126
aVand we built the first national
p127
aVpublic education campaign
p128
aVcalled There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence.
p129
aVTake a look at one of our spots.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Video) Man: Where's dinner?
p132
aa(lp133
VWoman: Well, I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago, and I put everything away, so\u2014
p134
aa(lp135
VMan: What is this? Pizza. Woman: If you had just called me, I would have known\u2014
p136
aa(lp137
VMan: Dinner? Dinner ready is a pizza? Woman: Honey, please don't be so loud.
p138
aVPlease don't\u2014Let go of me!
p139
aa(lp140
VMan: Get in the kitchen! Woman: No! Help!
p141
aa(lp142
VMan: You want to see what hurts? (Slaps woman)
p143
aa(lp144
VThat's what hurts! That's what hurts! (Breaking glass)
p145
aa(lp146
VWoman: Help me!
p147
aa(lp148
V["Children have to sit by and watch. What's your excuse?"]
p149
aa(lp150
VEsta Soler: As we were in the process
p151
aVof releasing this campaign,
p152
aVO.J. Simpson was arrested
p153
aVfor the murder of his wife and her friend.
p154
aVWe learned that he had a long history
p155
aVof domestic violence.
p156
aVThe media became fixated.
p157
aVThe story of domestic violence
p158
aVwent from the back page,
p159
aVbut actually from the no-page, to the front page.
p160
aVOur ads blanketed the airwaves,
p161
aVand women, for the first time,
p162
aVstarted to tell their stories.
p163
aVMovements are about moments,
p164
aVand we seized this moment.
p165
aVAnd let me just put this in context.
p166
aVBefore 1980, do you have any idea
p167
aVhow many articles were in The New York Times
p168
aVon domestic violence?
p169
aVI'll tell you: 158.
p170
aVAnd in the 2000s, over 7,000.
p171
aVWe were obviously making a difference.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut we were still missing a critical element.
p174
aVSo, step four: We needed to engage men.
p175
aVWe couldn't solve this problem
p176
aVwith 50 percent of the population on the sidelines.
p177
aVAnd I already told you I'm a data nerd.
p178
aVNational polling told us that men felt indicted
p179
aVand not invited into this conversation.
p180
aVSo we wondered, how can we include men?
p181
aVHow can we get men to talk about
p182
aVviolence against women and girls?
p183
aVAnd a male friend of mine pulled me aside
p184
aVand he said, "You want men to talk about violence
p185
aVagainst women and girls. Men don't talk."
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVI apologize to the men in the audience.
p188
aVI know you do.
p189
aVBut he said, "Do you know what they do do?
p190
aVThey do talk to their kids.
p191
aVThey talk to their kids as parents, as coaches."
p192
aVAnd that's what we did.
p193
aVWe met men where they were at
p194
aVand we built a program.
p195
aVAnd then we had this one event
p196
aVthat stays in my heart forever
p197
aVwhere a basketball coach
p198
aVwas talking to a room filled with male athletes
p199
aVand men from all walks of life.
p200
aVAnd he was talking about the importance
p201
aVof coaching boys into men
p202
aVand changing the culture of the locker room
p203
aVand giving men the tools to have healthy relationships.
p204
aVAnd all of a sudden, he looked at the back of the room,
p205
aVand he saw his daughter,
p206
aVand he called out his daughter's name, Michaela,
p207
aVand he said, "Michaela, come up here."
p208
aVAnd she's nine years old, and she was kind of shy,
p209
aVand she got up there,
p210
aVand he said, "Sit down next to me."
p211
aVShe sat right down next to him.
p212
aVHe gave her this big hug, and he said,
p213
aV"People ask me why I do this work.
p214
aVI do this work because I'm her dad,
p215
aVand I don't want anyone ever to hurt her."
p216
aVAnd as a parent, I get it.
p217
aVI get it,
p218
aVknowing that there are so many sexual assaults
p219
aVon college campuses
p220
aVthat are so widespread and so under-reported.
p221
aVWe've done a lot for adult women.
p222
aVWe've got to do a better job for our kids.
p223
aVWe just do. We have to. (Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VWe've come a long way
p226
aVsince the days of the Polaroid.
p227
aVTechnology has been our friend.
p228
aVThe mobile phone is a global game changer
p229
aVfor the empowerment of women,
p230
aVand Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube
p231
aVand all the social media helps us organize
p232
aVand tell our story in a powerful way.
p233
aVAnd so those of you in this audience
p234
aVwho have helped build those applications
p235
aVand those platforms, as an organizer,
p236
aVI say, thank you very much.
p237
aVReally. I clap for you.
p238
aV(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VI'm the daughter of a man
p241
aVwho joined one club in his life,
p242
aVthe Optimist Club.
p243
aVYou can't make that one up.
p244
aVAnd it is his spirit and his optimism
p245
aVthat is in my DNA.
p246
aVI have been doing this work
p247
aVfor over 30 years,
p248
aVand I am convinced, now more than ever,
p249
aVin the capacity of human beings to change.
p250
aVI believe we can bend the arc of human history
p251
aVtoward compassion and equality,
p252
aVand I also fundamentally believe
p253
aVand passionately believe
p254
aVthat this violence does not have to be part
p255
aVof the human condition.
p256
aVAnd I ask you, stand with us
p257
aVas we create futures without violence
p258
aVfor women and girls and men and boys everywhere.
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you very much.

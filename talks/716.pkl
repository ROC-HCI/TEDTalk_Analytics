VMetaphor lives a secret life all around us.
p5
aVWe utter about six metaphors a minute.
p6
aVMetaphorical thinking is essential
p7
aVto how we understand ourselves and others,
p8
aVhow we communicate, learn, discover
p9
aVand invent.
p10
aVBut metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow, to assist me in explaining this,
p13
aVI've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers,
p14
aVthe reigning king of the metaphorians,
p15
aVa man whose contributions to the field
p16
aVare so great that he himself
p17
aVhas become a metaphor.
p18
aVI am, of course, referring to none other
p19
aVthan Elvis Presley.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, "All Shook Up" is a great love song.
p23
aVIt's also a great example of how
p24
aVwhenever we deal with anything abstract \u2014
p25
aVideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts \u2014
p26
aVwe inevitably resort to metaphor.
p27
aVIn "All Shook Up," a touch is not a touch, but a chill.
p28
aVLips are not lips, but volcanoes.
p29
aVShe is not she, but a buttercup.
p30
aVAnd love is not love, but being all shook up.
p31
aa(lp32
VIn this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor
p33
aVas the process of giving the thing
p34
aVa name that belongs to something else.
p35
aVThis is the mathematics of metaphor.
p36
aVAnd fortunately it's very simple.
p37
aVX equals Y.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVThis formula works wherever metaphor is present.
p40
aa(lp41
VElvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare
p42
aVin this famous line from "Romeo and Juliet:"
p43
aVJuliet is the sun.
p44
aVNow, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet,
p45
aVa name that belongs to something else, the sun.
p46
aVBut whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else,
p47
aVwe give it a whole network of analogies too.
p48
aVWe mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source,
p49
aVin this case the sun,
p50
aVwith what we know about its target, Juliet.
p51
aVAnd metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet
p52
aVthan if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo, how do we make and understand metaphors?
p55
aVThis might look familiar.
p56
aVThe first step is pattern recognition.
p57
aVLook at this image. What do you see?
p58
aVThree wayward Pac-Men,
p59
aVand three pointy brackets are actually present.
p60
aVWhat we see, however,
p61
aVare two overlapping triangles.
p62
aVMetaphor is not just the detection of patterns;
p63
aVit is the creation of patterns.
p64
aVSecond step, conceptual synesthesia.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ
p67
aVin another sense organ as well,
p68
aVsuch as colored hearing.
p69
aVPeople with colored hearing
p70
aVactually see colors when they hear the sounds
p71
aVof words or letters.
p72
aVWe all have synesthetic abilities.
p73
aVThis is the Bouba/Kiki test.
p74
aVWhat you have to do is identify which of these shapes
p75
aVis called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VIf you are like 98 percent of other people,
p79
aVyou will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,
p80
aVand the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.
p81
aVCan we do a quick show of hands?
p82
aVDoes that correspond?
p83
aVOkay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.
p84
aVWhy do we do that?
p85
aVBecause we instinctively find, or create,
p86
aVa pattern between the round shape
p87
aVand the round sound of Bouba,
p88
aVand the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.
p91
aVSilence is sweet.
p92
aVNeckties are loud.
p93
aVSexually attractive people are hot.
p94
aVSexually unattractive people leave us cold.
p95
aVMetaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,
p96
aVin which we understand one concept
p97
aVin the context of another.
p98
aa(lp99
VThird step is cognitive dissonance.
p100
aVThis is the Stroop test.
p101
aVWhat you need to do here is identify
p102
aVas quickly as possible
p103
aVthe color of the ink in which these words are printed.
p104
aVYou can take the test now.
p105
aVIf you're like most people, you will experience
p106
aVa moment of cognitive dissonance
p107
aVwhen the name of the color
p108
aVis printed in a differently colored ink.
p109
aVThe test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words
p110
aVeven when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.
p111
aa(lp112
VStroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.
p113
aVThe participants had to identify, as quickly as possible,
p114
aVthe literally false sentences.
p115
aVThey took longer to reject metaphors as false
p116
aVthan they did to reject literally false sentences.
p117
aVWhy? Because we cannot ignore
p118
aVthe metaphorical meaning of words either.
p119
aa(lp120
VOne of the sentences was, "Some jobs are jails."
p121
aVNow, unless you're a prison guard,
p122
aVthe sentence "Some jobs are jails" is literally false.
p123
aVSadly, it's metaphorically true.
p124
aVAnd the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability
p125
aVto identify it as literally false.
p126
aVMetaphor matters because
p127
aVit's around us every day, all the time.
p128
aVMetaphor matters because it creates expectations.
p129
aa(lp130
VPay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.
p131
aVAgent metaphors describe price movements
p132
aVas the deliberate action of a living thing,
p133
aVas in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher."
p134
aVObject metaphors describe price movements
p135
aVas non-living things,
p136
aVas in, "The Dow fell like a brick."
p137
aa(lp138
VResearchers asked a group of people
p139
aVto read a clutch of market commentaries,
p140
aVand then predict the next day's price trend.
p141
aVThose exposed to agent metaphors
p142
aVhad higher expectations that price trends would continue.
p143
aVAnd they had those expectations because
p144
aVagent metaphors imply the deliberate action
p145
aVof a living thing pursuing a goal.
p146
aVIf, for example, house prices
p147
aVare routinely described as climbing and climbing,
p148
aVhigher and higher, people might naturally assume
p149
aVthat that rise is unstoppable.
p150
aVThey may feel confident, say,
p151
aVin taking out mortgages they really can't afford.
p152
aVThat's a hypothetical example of course.
p153
aVBut this is how metaphor misleads.
p154
aa(lp155
VMetaphor also matters because it influences decisions
p156
aVby activating analogies.
p157
aVA group of students was told that a small democratic country
p158
aVhad been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.
p159
aVAnd they had to make a decision.
p160
aVWhat should they do?
p161
aVIntervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?
p162
aVThey were each then given one of three
p163
aVdescriptions of this hypothetical crisis.
p164
aVEach of which was designed to trigger
p165
aVa different historical analogy:
p166
aVWorld War II, Vietnam,
p167
aVand the third was historically neutral.
p168
aa(lp169
VThose exposed to the World War II scenario
p170
aVmade more interventionist recommendations
p171
aVthan the others.
p172
aVJust as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,
p173
aVwe cannot ignore the analogies
p174
aVthat are triggered by metaphor.
p175
aVMetaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.
p176
aVWhenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery,
p177
aVwe compare what we know with what we don't know.
p178
aVAnd the only way to find out about the latter
p179
aVis to investigate the ways it might be like the former.
p180
aa(lp181
VEinstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.
p182
aVHe famously used thought experiments,
p183
aVwhich are essentially elaborate analogies,
p184
aVto come up with some of his greatest discoveries.
p185
aVBy bringing together what we know
p186
aVand what we don't know through analogy,
p187
aVmetaphorical thinking strikes the spark
p188
aVthat ignites discovery.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.
p191
aVBut you just have to look at the words around you
p192
aVand you'll find it.
p193
aVRalph Waldo Emerson described language
p194
aVas "fossil poetry."
p195
aVBut before it was fossil poetry
p196
aVlanguage was fossil metaphor.
p197
aVAnd these fossils still breathe.
p198
aa(lp199
VTake the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy:
p200
aV"Cogito ergo sum."
p201
aVThat's routinely translated as, "I think, therefore I am."
p202
aVBut there is a better translation.
p203
aVThe Latin word "cogito"
p204
aVis derived from the prefix "co," meaning "together,"
p205
aVand the verb "agitare," meaning "to shake."
p206
aVSo, the original meaning of "cogito"
p207
aVis to shake together.
p208
aVAnd the proper translation of "cogito ergo sum"
p209
aVis "I shake things up, therefore I am."
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VMetaphor shakes things up,
p213
aVgiving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.
p214
aVThe mind is a plastic snow dome,
p215
aVthe most beautiful, most interesting,
p216
aVand most itself, when, as Elvis put it,
p217
aVit's all shook up.
p218
aVAnd metaphor keeps the mind shaking,
p219
aVrattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.
p220
aVThank you very much.
p221
aV(Applause)

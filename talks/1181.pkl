VIt's an amazing thing
p5
aVthat we're here to talk about the year of patients rising.
p6
aVYou heard stories earlier today
p7
aVabout patients who are taking control of their cases,
p8
aVpatients who are saying,
p9
aV"You know what, I know what the odds are,
p10
aVbut I'm going to look for more information.
p11
aVI'm going to define what the terms of my success are."
p12
aVI'm going to be sharing with you how, four years ago, I almost died \u2014
p13
aVfound out I was, in fact, already almost dead \u2014
p14
aVand what I then found out
p15
aVabout what's called the e-Patient movement.
p16
aVI'll explain what that term means.
p17
aVI had been blogging under the name "Patient Dave,"
p18
aVand when I discovered this,
p19
aVI just renamed myself e-Patient Dave.
p20
aa(lp21
VRegarding the word "patient":
p22
aVWhen I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care
p23
aVand attending meetings as just a casual observer,
p24
aVI noticed that people would talk about patients
p25
aVas if it was somebody who's not in the room here \u2014
p26
aVsomebody out there.
p27
aVSome of our talks today, we still act like that.
p28
aVBut I'm here to tell you:
p29
aV"patient" is not a third-person word.
p30
aVAll right?
p31
aVYou yourself will find yourself in a hospital bed \u2014
p32
aVor your mother, your child \u2014
p33
aVthere are heads nodding, people who say,
p34
aV"Yes, I know exactly what you mean."
p35
aa(lp36
VSo when you hear what I'm going to talk about here today,
p37
aVfirst of all, I want to say that I am here
p38
aVon behalf of all the patients that I have ever met,
p39
aVall the ones I haven't met.
p40
aVThis is about letting patients play a more active role
p41
aVin helping health care, in fixing health care.
p42
aVOne of the senior doctors at my hospital,
p43
aVCharlie Safran, and his colleague, Warner Slack,
p44
aVhave been saying for decades
p45
aVthat the most underutilized resource in all of health care
p46
aVis the patient.
p47
aVThey have been saying that since the 1970s.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, I'm going to step back in history.
p50
aVThis is from July, 1969.
p51
aVI was a freshman in college,
p52
aVand this was when we first landed on the Moon.
p53
aVAnd it was the first time
p54
aVwe had ever seen from another surface \u2014
p55
aVthat's the place where you and I are right now,
p56
aVwhere we live.
p57
aVThe world was changing.
p58
aVIt was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee.
p59
aVA few weeks later, Woodstock happened.
p60
aVThree days of fun and music.
p61
aVHere, just for historical authenticity,
p62
aVis a picture of me in that year.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VYeah, the wavy hair, the blue eyes \u2014
p67
aVit was really something.
p68
aa(lp69
VThat fall of 1969,
p70
aVthe Whole Earth Catalog came out.
p71
aVIt was a hippie journal of self-sufficiency.
p72
aVWe think of hippies of being just hedonists,
p73
aVbut there's a very strong component \u2014 I was in that movement \u2014
p74
aVa very strong component of being responsible for yourself.
p75
aVThis book's title's subtitle is "Access to Tools."
p76
aVIt talked about how to build your own house,
p77
aVhow to grow your own food, all kinds of things.
p78
aVIn the 1980s,
p79
aVthis young doctor, Tom Ferguson,
p80
aVwas the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog.
p81
aVHe saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care
p82
aVis taking care of ourselves.
p83
aVIn fact, he said it was 70 to 80 percent
p84
aVof how we actually take care of our bodies.
p85
aVWell, he also saw that when health care turns to medical care
p86
aVbecause of a more serious disease,
p87
aVthe key thing that holds us back is access to information.
p88
aVAnd when the Web came along, that changed everything,
p89
aVbecause not only could we find information,
p90
aVwe could find other people like ourselves
p91
aVwho could gather, who could bring us information.
p92
aVAnd he coined this term "e-Patients" \u2014
p93
aVequipped, engaged, empowered, enabled.
p94
aVObviously, at this stage of life
p95
aVhe was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term.
p98
aVIn 2006, I went to my doctor for a regular physical,
p99
aVand I had said, "I have a sore shoulder."
p100
aVWell, I got an X-ray,
p101
aVand the next morning \u2014
p102
aVyou may have noticed, those of you who have been through a medical crisis
p103
aVwill understand this.
p104
aVThis morning, some of the speakers named the date when they found out
p105
aVabout their condition.
p106
aVFor me, it was 9am
p107
aVon January 3, 2007.
p108
aVI was at the office; my desk was clean.
p109
aVI had the blue partition carpet on the walls.
p110
aVThe phone rang and it was my doctor.
p111
aVHe said, "Dave, I pulled up the X-ray image
p112
aVon the screen on the computer at home."
p113
aVHe said, "Your shoulder is going to be fine,
p114
aVbut Dave, there's something in your lung."
p115
aVAnd if you look in that red oval,
p116
aVthat shadow was not supposed to be there.
p117
aVTo make a long story short,
p118
aVI said, "So you need me to get back in there?"
p119
aVHe said, "Yeah, we're going to need to do a CT scan of your chest."
p120
aVIn parting, I said, "Is there anything I should do?"
p121
aVHe said \u2014 think about this one,
p122
aVthis is the advice your doctor gives you:
p123
aV"Just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife."
p124
aa(lp125
VI went in for the CAT scan.
p126
aVIt turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs.
p127
aVSo at that point we knew that it was cancer.
p128
aVWe knew it wasn't lung cancer.
p129
aVThat meant it was metastasized from somewhere.
p130
aVThe question was, where from?
p131
aVSo I went in for an ultrasound.
p132
aVI got to do what many women have \u2014
p133
aVthe jelly on the belly and the, "Bzzzz!"
p134
aVMy wife came with me.
p135
aVShe's a veterinarian,
p136
aVso she's seen lots of ultrasounds.
p137
aVI mean, she knows I'm not a dog.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VThis is an MRI image.
p142
aVThis is much sharper than an ultrasound would be.
p143
aVWhat we saw in that kidney
p144
aVwas that big blob there.
p145
aVThere were actually two of these: one was growing out the front
p146
aVand had already erupted and latched onto the bowel.
p147
aVOne was growing out the back and it attached to the psoas muscle,
p148
aVwhich is a big muscle in the back that I'd never heard of,
p149
aVbut all of a sudden I cared about it.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VI went home.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, I've been Googling \u2014
p156
aVI've been online since 1989, on CompuServe.
p157
aVI went home, and I know you can't read the details here;
p158
aVthat's not important.
p159
aVMy point is, I went to a respected medical website, WebMD,
p160
aVbecause I know how to filter out junk.
p161
aVI also found my wife online.
p162
aVBefore I met her,
p163
aVI went through some suboptimal search results.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VSo I looked for quality information.
p168
aVThere's so much about trust \u2014
p169
aVwhat sources of information can we trust?
p170
aVWhere does my body end and an invader start?
p171
aVA cancer, a tumor, is something you grow out of your own tissue.
p172
aVHow does that happen?
p173
aVWhere does medical ability end and start?
p174
aVWell, so what I read on WebMD:
p175
aV"The prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer.
p176
aVAlmost all patients are incurable."
p177
aVI've been online long enough to know if I don't like the first results I get,
p178
aVI go look for more.
p179
aVAnd what I found on other websites was,
p180
aVeven by the third page of Google results:
p181
aV"Outlook is bleak."
p182
aV"Prognosis is grim."
p183
aVAnd I'm thinking, "What the heck?"
p184
aVI didn't feel sick at all.
p185
aVI mean, I'd been getting tired in the evening,
p186
aVbut I was 56 years old, you know?
p187
aVI was slowly losing weight,
p188
aVbut for me, that was what the doctor told me to do.
p189
aVIt was really something.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd this is the diagram of stage 4 kidney cancer
p192
aVfrom the drug I eventually got.
p193
aVTotally by coincidence, there's that thing in my lung.
p194
aVIn the left femur, the left thigh bone, there's another one.
p195
aVI had one. My leg eventually snapped.
p196
aVI fainted and landed on it, and it broke.
p197
aVThere's one in the skull,
p198
aVand then for good measure, I had these other tumors,
p199
aVincluding, by the time my treatment started,
p200
aVone was growing out of my tongue.
p201
aVI had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue.
p202
aVAnd what I read
p203
aVwas that my median survival was 24 weeks.
p204
aVThis was bad.
p205
aVI was facing the grave.
p206
aVI thought, "What's my mother's face going to look like
p207
aVon the day of my funeral?"
p208
aVI had to sit down with my daughter and say, "Here's the situation."
p209
aVHer boyfriend was with her.
p210
aVI said, "I don't want you guys to get married prematurely,
p211
aVjust so you can do it while Dad's still alive."
p212
aVIt's really serious.
p213
aVIf you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help,
p214
aVthink about this.
p215
aa(lp216
VWell, my doctor prescribed a patient community, ACOR.org,
p217
aVa network of cancer patients, of all amazing things.
p218
aVVery quickly they told me,
p219
aV"Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease.
p220
aVGet yourself to a specialist center.
p221
aVThere is no cure, but there's something that sometimes works \u2014
p222
aVit usually doesn't \u2014
p223
aVcalled high-dosage interleukin.
p224
aVMost hospitals don't offer it,
p225
aVso they won't even tell you it exists.
p226
aVDon't let them give you anything else first.
p227
aVAnd by the way, here are four doctors in your part of the United States
p228
aVwho offer it, and their phone numbers."
p229
aVHow amazing is that?
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VHere's the thing:
p234
aVHere we are, four years later \u2014
p235
aVyou can't find a website that gives patients that information.
p236
aVGovernment-approved, American Cancer Society,
p237
aVbut patients know what patients want to know.
p238
aVIt's the power of patient networks.
p239
aVThis amazing substance \u2014 again, I mentioned:
p240
aVWhere does my body end?
p241
aVMy oncologist and I talk a lot these days
p242
aVbecause I try to keep my talks technically accurate.
p243
aVAnd he said, "You know, the immune system is good at detecting invaders,
p244
aVbacteria coming from outside,
p245
aVbut when it's your own tissue that you've grown,
p246
aVit's a whole different thing."
p247
aVAnd I went through a mental exercise, actually,
p248
aVbecause I started a patient support community of my own on a website,
p249
aVand one of my friends \u2014 one of my relatives, actually \u2014 said,
p250
aV"Look, Dave, who grew this thing?
p251
aVAre you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself?"
p252
aVSo we went into it.
p253
aVThe story of how all that happened is in the book.
p254
aa(lp255
VAnyway, this is the way the numbers unfolded.
p256
aVMe being me, I put the numbers from my hospital's website,
p257
aVfor my tumor sizes,
p258
aVinto a spreadsheet.
p259
aVDon't worry about the numbers.
p260
aVYou see, that's the immune system.
p261
aVAmazing thing, those two yellow lines
p262
aVare where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart.
p263
aVAnd look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between.
p264
aVJust incredible.
p265
aVWho knows what we'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it?
p266
aa(lp267
VThe punch line is that a year and a half later,
p268
aVI was there when this magnificent young woman, my daughter,
p269
aVgot married.
p270
aVAnd when she came down those steps,
p271
aVand it was just her and me for that moment,
p272
aVI was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother,
p273
aV"I wish Dad could have been here."
p274
aVAnd this is what we're doing when we make health care better.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow, I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients
p277
aVwho are doing everything in their power to improve health care.
p278
aVThis is Regina Holliday,
p279
aVa painter in Washington DC, whose husband died of kidney cancer
p280
aVa year after my disease.
p281
aVShe's painting, here, a mural
p282
aVof his horrible final weeks in the hospital.
p283
aVOne of the things that she discovered
p284
aVwas that her husband's medical record in this paper folder
p285
aVwas just disorganized.
p286
aVAnd she thought, "You know, if I have a nutrition facts label
p287
aVon the side of a cereal box,
p288
aVwhy can't there be something that simple
p289
aVtelling every new nurse who comes on duty,
p290
aVevery new doctor,
p291
aVthe basics about my husband's condition?"
p292
aVSo she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label,
p293
aVsomething like that,
p294
aVin a diagram of him.
p295
aVShe then, last year, painted this diagram.
p296
aa(lp297
VShe studied health care like me.
p298
aVShe came to realize there were a lot of people
p299
aVwho'd written patient-advocate books
p300
aVthat you just don't hear about at medical conferences.
p301
aVPatients are such an underutilized resource.
p302
aVWell, as it said in my introduction,
p303
aVI've gotten somewhat known for saying
p304
aVthat patients should have access to their data.
p305
aVI actually said at one conference a couple of years ago,
p306
aV"Give me my damn data,
p307
aVbecause you people can't be trusted to keep it clean."
p308
aVAnd here, she has our "damned" data \u2014
p309
aVit's a pun \u2014
p310
aVwhich is starting to break out, starting to break through \u2014
p311
aVthe water symbolizes our data.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd in fact,
p314
aVI want to do a little something improvisational for you.
p315
aVThere's a guy on Twitter that I know, a health IT guy outside Boston,
p316
aVand he wrote the e-Patient rap.
p317
aVAnd it goes like this.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
V(Beatboxing)
p322
aa(lp323
V(Rapping) Gimme my damn data
p324
aVI wanna be an e-Patient just like Dave
p325
aVGimme my damn data, 'cause it's my life to save
p326
aV(Normal voice) Now, I'm not going to go any further \u2014
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause) (Cheering)
p329
aa(lp330
VWell, thank you. That shot the timing.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VThink about the possibility.
p335
aVWhy is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster
p336
aVthan the health tools that are available to you
p337
aVto help take care of your family?
p338
aVHere's a website, VisibleBody.com, that I stumbled across.
p339
aVAnd I thought, "You know, I wonder what my psoas muscle is?"
p340
aVSo you can click on things and remove it.
p341
aVAnd I saw, "Aha! That's the kidney and the psoas muscle."
p342
aVI was rotating it in 3D and saying, "I understand now."
p343
aVAnd then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth,
p344
aVwhere you can fly to any address.
p345
aVAnd I thought, "Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data
p346
aVand have Google Earth for my body?"
p347
aVWhat did Google come out with this year?
p348
aVNow there's Google Body browser.
p349
aVBut you see, it's still generic.
p350
aVIt's not my data.
p351
aVBut if we can get that data out from behind the dam
p352
aVso software innovators can pounce on it
p353
aVthe way software innovators like to do,
p354
aVwho knows what we'll be able to come up with.
p355
aa(lp356
VOne final story.
p357
aVThis is Kelly Young, a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida.
p358
aVThis is a live story, unfolding just in the last few weeks.
p359
aVRA patients, as they call themselves \u2014 her blog is "RA Warrior" \u2014
p360
aVhave a big problem,
p361
aVbecause 40 percent of them have no visible symptoms.
p362
aVAnd that makes it really hard to tell how the disease is going,
p363
aVand some doctors think, "Yeah right, you're really in pain."
p364
aVWell, she found, through her online research,
p365
aVa nuclear bone scan that's usually used for cancer,
p366
aVbut it can also reveal inflammation.
p367
aVAnd she saw that if there is no inflammation,
p368
aVthen the scan is a uniform gray.
p369
aVSo she took it.
p370
aVAnd the radiologist's report said, "No cancer found."
p371
aVWell, that's not what he was supposed to do with it.
p372
aVSo she wanted to have it read again,
p373
aVand her doctor fired her.
p374
aVShe pulled up the CD.
p375
aVHe said, "If you don't want to follow my instructions, go away."
p376
aVSo she pulled up the CD of the scan images,
p377
aVand look at all those hot spots.
p378
aVAnd she's now actively engaged on her blog
p379
aVin looking for assistance in getting better care.
p380
aVSee, that is an empowered patient \u2014 no medical training.
p381
aa(lp382
VWe are, you are,
p383
aVthe most underused resource in health care.
p384
aVWhat she was able to do
p385
aVwas because she had access to the raw data.
p386
aVHow big a deal was this?
p387
aVWell at TED2009,
p388
aVTim Berners-Lee himself, inventor of the Web,
p389
aVgave a talk where he said the next big thing
p390
aVis not to have your browser find other people's articles about the data,
p391
aVbut the raw data.
p392
aVAnd he got them chanting by the end of the talk,
p393
aV"Raw data now! Raw data now!"
p394
aVAnd I ask you,
p395
aVthree words, please, to improve health care:
p396
aVLet patients help!
p397
aVLet patients help!
p398
aVLet patients help!
p399
aVLet patients help!
p400
aa(lp401
VThank you.
p402
aa(lp403
V(Applause)
p404
aa(lp405
VFor all the patients around the world watching this on the Webcast,
p406
aVGod bless you, everyone. Let patients help.
p407
aa(lp408
VHost: And bless yourself. Thank you very much.

VSometimes I go browsing
p5
aV[through] a very old magazine.
p6
aVI found this observation test
p7
aVabout the story of the ark.
p8
aVAnd the artist that drew this observation test
p9
aVdid some errors, had some mistakes \u2014
p10
aVthere are more or less 12 mistakes.
p11
aVSome of them are very easy.
p12
aVThere is a funnel, an aerial part,
p13
aVa lamp and clockwork key on the ark.
p14
aVSome of them are about the animals, the number.
p15
aVBut there is a much more fundamental mistake
p16
aVin the overall story of the ark
p17
aVthat's not reported here.
p18
aVAnd this problem is: where are the plants?
p19
aVSo now we have God
p20
aVthat is going to submerge Earth permanently
p21
aVor at least for a very long period,
p22
aVand no one is taking care of plants.
p23
aVNoah needed to take two of every kind of bird,
p24
aVof every kind of animal,
p25
aVof every kind of creature that moves,
p26
aVbut no mention about plants.
p27
aVWhy?
p28
aVIn another part of the same story,
p29
aVall the living creatures
p30
aVare just the living creatures
p31
aVthat came out from the ark,
p32
aVso birds, livestock and wild animals.
p33
aVPlants are not living creatures \u2014
p34
aVthis is the point.
p35
aVThat is a point that is not
p36
aVcoming out from the Bible,
p37
aVbut it's something that
p38
aVreally accompanied humanity.
p39
aa(lp40
VLet's have a look at this nice code
p41
aVthat is coming from a Renaissance book.
p42
aVHere we have the description
p43
aVof the order of nature.
p44
aVIt's a nice description because it's starting from left \u2014
p45
aVyou have the stones \u2014
p46
aVimmediately after the stones, the plants
p47
aVthat are just able to live.
p48
aVWe have the animals that are able to live and to sense,
p49
aVand on the top of the pyramid,
p50
aVthere is the man.
p51
aVThis is not the common man.
p52
aVThe "Homo studiosus" \u2014 the studying man.
p53
aVThis is quite comforting
p54
aVfor people like me \u2014 I'm a professor \u2014
p55
aVthis to be over there on the top of creation.
p56
aVBut it's something completely wrong.
p57
aVYou know very well about professors.
p58
aVBut it's also wrong about plants,
p59
aVbecause plants are not just able to live;
p60
aVthey are able to sense.
p61
aVThey are much more sophisticated
p62
aVin sensing than animals.
p63
aVJust to give you an example,
p64
aVevery single root apex
p65
aVis able to detect and to monitor
p66
aVconcurrently and continuously
p67
aVat least 15 different chemical
p68
aVand physical parameters.
p69
aVAnd they also are able to show and to exhibit
p70
aVsuch a wonderful and complex behavior
p71
aVthat can be described just with the term of intelligence.
p72
aVWell, but this is something \u2014
p73
aVthis underestimation of plants is something
p74
aVthat is always with us.
p75
aa(lp76
VLet's have a look at this short movie now.
p77
aVWe have David Attenborough.
p78
aVNow David Attenborough is really a plant lover;
p79
aVhe did some of the most beautiful movies
p80
aVabout plant behavior.
p81
aVNow, when he speaks about plants,
p82
aVeverything is correct.
p83
aVWhen he speaks about animals,
p84
aV[he] tends to remove the fact
p85
aVthat plants exist.
p86
aVThe blue whale,
p87
aVthe biggest creature that exists on the planet \u2014
p88
aVthat is wrong, completely wrong.
p89
aVThe blue whale, it's a dwarf
p90
aVif compared with the real biggest creature
p91
aVthat exists on the planet \u2014
p92
aVthat is, this wonderful,
p93
aVmagnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum.
p94
aV(Applause)
p95
aVAnd this is a living organism
p96
aVthat has a mass of at least 2,000 tons.
p97
aVNow, the story
p98
aVthat plants are some low-level organisms
p99
aVhas been formalized
p100
aVmany times ago by Aristotle,
p101
aVthat in "De Anima" \u2014
p102
aVthat is a very influential book for the Western civilization \u2014
p103
aVwrote that the plants are on the edge
p104
aVbetween living and not living.
p105
aVThey have just a kind of very low-level soul.
p106
aVIt's called the vegetative soul,
p107
aVbecause they lack movement,
p108
aVand so they don't need to sense.
p109
aVLet's see.
p110
aa(lp111
VOkay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known.
p112
aVThis is a very fast movement.
p113
aVThis is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap
p114
aVhunting snails \u2014
p115
aVsorry for the snail.
p116
aVThis has been something that has been refused for centuries,
p117
aVdespite the evidence.
p118
aVNo one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal,
p119
aVbecause it was against the order of nature.
p120
aVBut plants are also able
p121
aVto show a lot of movement.
p122
aVSome of them are very well known, like the flowering.
p123
aVIt's just a question to use some techniques
p124
aVlike the time lapse.
p125
aVSome of them are much more sophisticated.
p126
aVLook at this young bean
p127
aVthat is moving to catch the light every time.
p128
aVAnd it's really so graceful;
p129
aVit's like a dancing angel.
p130
aVThey are also able to play \u2014
p131
aVthey are really playing.
p132
aVThese are young sunflowers,
p133
aVand what they are doing
p134
aVcannot be described
p135
aVwith any other terms than playing.
p136
aVThey are training themselves,
p137
aVas many young animals do,
p138
aVto the adult life
p139
aVwhere they will be called to track the sun
p140
aVall the day.
p141
aVThey are able to respond to gravity, of course,
p142
aVso the shoots are growing
p143
aVagainst the vector of gravity
p144
aVand the roots toward the vector of gravity.
p145
aVBut they are also able to sleep.
p146
aVThis is one, Mimosa pudica.
p147
aVSo during the night,
p148
aVthey curl the leaves
p149
aVand reduce the movement,
p150
aVand during the day, you have the opening of the leaves \u2014
p151
aVthere is much more movement.
p152
aVThis is interesting
p153
aVbecause this sleeping machinery,
p154
aVit's perfectly conserved.
p155
aVIt's the same in plants, in insects
p156
aVand in animals.
p157
aVAnd so if you need to study this sleeping problem,
p158
aVit's easy to study on plants, for example,
p159
aVthan in animals
p160
aVand it's much more easy even ethically.
p161
aVIt's a kind of vegetarian
p162
aVexperimentation.
p163
aa(lp164
VPlants are even able to communicate \u2014
p165
aVthey are extraordinary communicators.
p166
aVThey communicate with other plants.
p167
aVThey are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.
p168
aVThey communicate
p169
aVwith plants of other species
p170
aVand they communicate with animals
p171
aVby producing chemical volatiles,
p172
aVfor example, during the pollination.
p173
aVNow with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants,
p174
aVbecause they move the pollen from one flower to the other,
p175
aVyet they cannot move from one flower to the other.
p176
aVSo they need a vector \u2014
p177
aVand this vector,
p178
aVit's normally an animal.
p179
aVMany insects
p180
aVhave been used by plants as vectors
p181
aVfor the transport of the pollination,
p182
aVbut not just insects; even birds, reptiles,
p183
aVand mammals like bats rats
p184
aVare normally used for the transportation of the pollen.
p185
aVThis is a serious business.
p186
aVWe have the plants that are giving to the animals
p187
aVa kind of sweet substance \u2014
p188
aVvery energizing \u2014
p189
aVhaving in change this transportation of the pollen.
p190
aVBut some plants are manipulating animals,
p191
aVlike in the case of orchids
p192
aVthat promise sex and nectar
p193
aVand give in change nothing
p194
aVfor the transportation of the pollen.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, there is a big problem
p197
aVbehind all this behavior that we have seen.
p198
aVHow is it possible to do this without a brain?
p199
aVWe need to wait until 1880,
p200
aVwhen this big man,
p201
aVCharles Darwin,
p202
aVpublishes a wonderful, astonishing book
p203
aVthat starts a revolution.
p204
aVThe title is "The Power of Movement in Plants."
p205
aVNo one was allowed to speak about movement in plants
p206
aVbefore Charles Darwin.
p207
aVIn his book,
p208
aVassisted by his son, Francis \u2014
p209
aVwho was the first professor of plant physiology in the world, in Cambridge \u2014
p210
aVthey took into consideration every single movement
p211
aVfor 500 pages.
p212
aVAnd in the last paragraph of the book,
p213
aVit's a kind of stylistic mark,
p214
aVbecause normally Charles Darwin stored,
p215
aVin the last paragraph of a book,
p216
aVthe most important message.
p217
aVHe wrote that,
p218
aV"It's hardly an exaggeration
p219
aVto say that the tip of the radical
p220
aVacts like the brain
p221
aVof one of the lower animals."
p222
aVThis is not a metaphor.
p223
aVHe wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends
p224
aVwho was J.D. Hooker, or at that time, president of the Royal Society,
p225
aVso the maximum scientific authority in Britain
p226
aVspeaking about the brain in the plants.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, this is a root apex
p229
aVgrowing against a slope.
p230
aVSo you can recognize this kind of movement,
p231
aVthe same movement that worms, snakes
p232
aVand every animal
p233
aVthat are moving on the ground without legs
p234
aVis able to display.
p235
aVAnd it's not an easy movement
p236
aVbecause, to have this kind of movement,
p237
aVyou need to move different regions of the root
p238
aVand to synchronize these different regions
p239
aVwithout having a brain.
p240
aVSo we studied the root apex
p241
aVand we found that there is a specific region
p242
aVthat is here, depicted in blue \u2014
p243
aVthat is called the "transition zone."
p244
aVAnd this region, it's a very small region \u2014
p245
aVit's less than one millimeter.
p246
aVAnd in this small region
p247
aVyou have the highest consumption
p248
aVof oxygen in the plants
p249
aVand more important,
p250
aVyou have these kinds of signals here.
p251
aVThe signals that you are seeing here are action potential,
p252
aVare the same signals
p253
aVthat the neurons of my brain, of our brain,
p254
aVuse to exchange information.
p255
aVNow we know that a root apex
p256
aVhas just a few hundred cells
p257
aVthat show this kind of feature,
p258
aVbut we know how big
p259
aVthe root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye.
p260
aVWe have almost
p261
aV14 million roots.
p262
aVWe have 11 and a half million
p263
aVroot apex
p264
aVand a total length of 600 or more kilometers
p265
aVand a very high surface area.
p266
aa(lp267
VNow let's imagine
p268
aVthat each single root apex
p269
aVis working in network with all the others.
p270
aVHere were have on the left, the Internet
p271
aVand on the right, the root apparatus.
p272
aVThey work in the same way.
p273
aVThey are a network
p274
aVof small computing machines,
p275
aVworking in networks.
p276
aVAnd why are they so similar?
p277
aVBecause they evolved
p278
aVfor the same reason:
p279
aVto survive predation.
p280
aVThey work in the same way.
p281
aVSo you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus
p282
aVand the plants [continue] to work.
p283
aVYou can remove 90 percent of the Internet
p284
aVand it is [continuing] to work.
p285
aVSo, a suggestion
p286
aVfor the people working with networks:
p287
aVplants are able
p288
aVto give you good suggestions
p289
aVabout how to evolve networks.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd another possibility
p292
aVis a technological possibility.
p293
aVLet's imagine
p294
aVthat we can build robots
p295
aVand robots that are inspired by plants.
p296
aVUntil now,
p297
aVthe man was inspired
p298
aVjust by man or the animals
p299
aVin producing a robot.
p300
aVWe have the animaloid \u2014
p301
aVand the normal robots inspired by animals,
p302
aVinsectoid, so on.
p303
aVWe have the androids
p304
aVthat are inspired by man.
p305
aVBut why have we not any plantoid?
p306
aVWell, if you want to fly,
p307
aVit's good that you look at birds \u2014
p308
aVto be inspired by birds.
p309
aVBut if you want to explore soils,
p310
aVor if you want to colonize
p311
aVnew territory,
p312
aVto best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants
p313
aVthat are masters in doing this.
p314
aVWe have another possibility
p315
aVwe are working [on] in our lab,
p316
aV[which] is to build hybrids.
p317
aVIt's much more easy to build hybrids.
p318
aVHybrid means it's something
p319
aVthat's half living and half machine.
p320
aVIt's much more easy to work with plants
p321
aVthan with animals.
p322
aVThey have computing power,
p323
aVthey have electrical signals.
p324
aVThe connection with the machine is much more easy,
p325
aVmuch more even ethically possible.
p326
aVAnd these are three possibilities
p327
aVthat we are working on
p328
aVto build hybrids,
p329
aVdriven by algae
p330
aVor by the leaves at the end,
p331
aVby the most, most powerful parts of the plants,
p332
aVby the roots.
p333
aa(lp334
VWell, thank you for your attention.
p335
aVAnd before I finish,
p336
aVI would like to reassure that no snails were harmed
p337
aVin making this presentation.
p338
aVThank you.

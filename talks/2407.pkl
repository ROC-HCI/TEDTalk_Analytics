VWelcome to Bayeku,
p5
aVa riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos \u2014
p6
aVa vivid representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria,
p7
aVcommunities whose waterways have been infested
p8
aVby an invasive aquatic weed;
p9
aVcommunities where economic livelihoods have been hampered:
p10
aVfishing, marine transportation
p11
aVand trading;
p12
aVcommunities where fish yields have diminished;
p13
aVcommunities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school
p14
aVfor days, sometimes weeks, on end.
p15
aVWho would have thought that this plant
p16
aVwith round leaves, inflated stems, and showy, lavender flowers
p17
aVwould cause such havoc in these communities.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe plant is known as water hyacinth
p20
aVand its botanical name, Eichhornia crassipes.
p21
aVInterestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names,
p22
aVnames associated with historical events,
p23
aVas well as myths.
p24
aVIn some places, the plant is called Babangida.
p25
aVWhen you hear Babangida, you remember the military and military coups.
p26
aVAnd you think: fear, restraint.
p27
aVIn parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta, the plant is also known as Abiola.
p28
aVWhen you hear Abiola, you remember annulled elections
p29
aVand you think: dashed hopes.
p30
aVIn the southwestern part of Nigeria,
p31
aVthe plant is known as Gbe'borun.
p32
aVGbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase
p33
aVwhich translates to "gossip," or "talebearer."
p34
aVWhen you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction.
p35
aVAnd in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria,
p36
aVthe plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma,
p37
aVAnd when you hear that, you think of death.
p38
aVIt literally translates to "death to mother and child."
p39
aa(lp40
VI personally had my encounter with this plant in the year 2009.
p41
aVIt was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria.
p42
aVI'd quit my job in corporate America
p43
aVand decided to take this big leap of faith,
p44
aVa leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction
p45
aVthat there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria
p46
aVin the area of sustainable development.
p47
aVAnd so here I was in the year 2009,
p48
aVactually, at the end of 2009,
p49
aVin Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image.
p52
aVIt was an image of fishing boats
p53
aVthat had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth.
p54
aVAnd I was really pained by what I saw
p55
aVbecause I thought to myself,
p56
aV"These poor fisherfolk,
p57
aVhow are they going to go about their daily activities
p58
aVwith these restrictions."
p59
aVAnd then I thought, "There's got to be a better way."
p60
aVA win-win solution whereby the environment is taken care of
p61
aVby the weeds being cleared out of the way
p62
aVand then this being turned into an economic benefit
p63
aVfor the communities whose lives are impacted the most
p64
aVby the infestation of the weed.
p65
aVThat, I would say, was my spark moment.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd so I did further research to find out more
p68
aVabout the beneficial uses of this weed.
p69
aVOut of the several, one struck me the most.
p70
aVIt was the use of the plant for handicrafts.
p71
aVAnd I thought, "What a great idea."
p72
aVPersonally, I love handicrafts,
p73
aVespecially handicrafts that are woven around a story.
p74
aVAnd so I thought, "This could be easily deployed within the communities
p75
aVwithout the requirement of technical skills."
p76
aVAnd I thought to myself, "Three simple steps to a mega solution."
p77
aa(lp78
VFirst step: Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth.
p79
aVThat way, you create access.
p80
aa(lp81
VSecondly, you dry the water hyacinth stems.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd thirdly, you weave the water hyacinth into products.
p84
aa(lp85
VThe third step was a challenge.
p86
aVSee, I'm a computer scientist by background
p87
aVand not someone in the creative arts.
p88
aVAnd so I began my quest
p89
aVto find out how I can learn how to weave.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd this quest took me to a community in Ibadan, where I lived,
p92
aVcalled Sabo.
p93
aVSabo translates to "strangers' quarters."
p94
aVAnd the community is predominantly made up of people
p95
aVfrom the northern part of the country.
p96
aVSo I literally took my dried weeds in hand,
p97
aVthere were several more of them,
p98
aVand went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me
p99
aVhow to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes.
p100
aVAnd I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya.
p101
aVThe problem, though, is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English
p102
aVand neither did I speak Hausa.
p103
aVBut some little kids came to the rescue
p104
aVand helped translate.
p105
aVAnd that began my journey of learning how to weave
p106
aVand transform these dried water hyacinth stems
p107
aVinto long ropes.
p108
aa(lp109
VWith my long ropes in hand,
p110
aVI was now equipped to make products.
p111
aVAnd that was the beginning of partnerships.
p112
aVWorking with rattan basket makers to come up with products.
p113
aVSo with this in hand, I felt confident
p114
aVthat I would be able to take this knowledge
p115
aVback into the riverine communities
p116
aVand help them to transform their adversity into prosperity.
p117
aVSo taking these weeds and actually weaving them
p118
aVinto products that can be sold.
p119
aVSo we have pens, we have tableware,
p120
aVwe have purses, we have tissue boxes.
p121
aVThereby, helping the communities
p122
aVto see water hyacinth in a different light.
p123
aVSeeing water hyacinth as being valuable,
p124
aVbeing aesthetic, being durable, tough, resilient.
p125
aVChanging names, changing livelihoods.
p126
aa(lp127
VFrom Gbe'borun, gossip,
p128
aVto Olusotan, storyteller.
p129
aVAnd from A Kp'iye Kp'oma, which is "killer of mother and child,"
p130
aVto Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma,
p131
aV"provider of food for mother and child."
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis.
p134
aVHe said, "If you want to learn about a culture, listen to the stories.
p135
aVAnd if you want to change a culture, change the stories."
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd so, from Makoko community, to Abobiri, to Ewoi,
p138
aVto Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba,
p139
aVwe have changed the story.
p140
aa(lp141
VThank you for listening.

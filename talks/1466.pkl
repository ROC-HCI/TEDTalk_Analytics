VSo I thought I'd talk about identity.
p5
aVThat's sort of an interesting enough topic to me.
p6
aVAnd the reason was, because when I was asked to do this,
p7
aVI'd just read, in one of the papers, I can't remember,
p8
aVsomething from someone at Facebook saying, well,
p9
aV"we need to make everybody use their real names."
p10
aVand then that's basically all the problems solved.
p11
aVAnd that's so wrong,
p12
aVthat's such a fundamentally, reactionary view of identity,
p13
aVand it's going to get us into all sorts of trouble.
p14
aVAnd so what I thought I'd do
p15
aVis I'll explain four sort of problems about it,
p16
aVand then I'll suggest a solution,
p17
aVwhich hopefully you might find interesting.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo just to frame the problem,
p20
aVwhat does authenticity mean?
p21
aVThat's me, that's a camera phone picture of me
p22
aVlooking at a painting.
p23
aV[What's the Problem?]
p24
aVThat's a painting that was painted
p25
aVby a very famous forger,
p26
aVand because I'm not very good at presentations,
p27
aVI already can't remember the name that I wrote on my card.
p28
aVAnd he was incarcerated in, I think, Wakefield Prison
p29
aVfor forging masterpieces by, I think, French Impressionists.
p30
aVAnd he's so good at it, that when he was in prison,
p31
aVeverybody in prison, the governor and whatever,
p32
aVwanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls,
p33
aVbecause they were so good.
p34
aVAnd so that's a masterpiece,
p35
aVwhich is a fake of a masterpiece,
p36
aVand bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake,
p37
aVif you see what I mean.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVSo when we're talking about authenticity,
p40
aVit's a little more fractal than it appears and that's a good example to show it.
p41
aVI tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo the first problem, I thought,
p44
aVChip and PIN, right?
p45
aV[Banks and legacies bringing down the system from within]
p46
aV[Offline solutions do not work online]
p47
aVI'm guessing everyone's got a chip and PIN card, right?
p48
aVSo why is that a good example?
p49
aVThat's the example of how legacy thinking about identity
p50
aVsubverts the security of a well-constructed system.
p51
aVThat chip and PIN card that's in your pocket
p52
aVhas a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop,
p53
aVis extremely secure,
p54
aVyou can put scanning electron microscopes on it,
p55
aVyou can try and grind it down, blah blah blah.
p56
aVThose chips have never been broken, whatever you read in the paper.
p57
aVAnd for a joke, we take that super-secure chip
p58
aVand we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe
p59
aVand for very lazy criminals, we still emboss the card.
p60
aVSo if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card,
p61
aVyou can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it
p62
aVjust to sort of speed things up.
p63
aVAnd even more amusingly, and on my debit card too,
p64
aVwe print the name and the SALT code and everything else on the front too.
p65
aVWhy?
p66
aVThere is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip and PIN card.
p67
aVAnd if you think about it,
p68
aVit's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first.
p69
aVBecause the only people that benefit
p70
aVfrom having the name on the card are criminals.
p71
aVYou know what your name is, right?
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVAnd when you go into a shop and buy something,
p74
aVit's a PIN, he doesn't care what the name is.
p75
aVThe only place where you ever have to write your name on the back
p76
aVis in America at the moment.
p77
aVAnd whenever I go to America,
p78
aVand I have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card,
p79
aVI always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway,
p80
aVjust as a security mechanism,
p81
aVbecause if a transaction ever gets disputed,
p82
aVand it comes back and it says Dave Birch,
p83
aVI know it must have been a criminal,
p84
aVbecause I would never sign it Dave Birch.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVSo if you drop your card in the street,
p87
aVit means a criminal can pick it up and read it.
p88
aVThey know the name,
p89
aVfrom the name they can find the address,
p90
aVand then they can go off and buy stuff online.
p91
aVWhy do we put the name on the card?
p92
aVBecause we think identity is something to do with names,
p93
aVand because we're rooted in the idea of the identity card,
p94
aVwhich obsesses us.
p95
aVAnd I know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago,
p96
aVbut if you're someone in politics or the home office or whatever,
p97
aVand you think about identity,
p98
aVyou can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on them.
p99
aVAnd that's very subversive in a modern world.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo the second example I thought I'd use
p102
aVis chatrooms.
p103
aV[Chatrooms and Children]
p104
aVI'm very proud of that picture, that's my son
p105
aVplaying in his band with his friends for the first-ever gig,
p106
aVI believe you call it, where he got paid.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVAnd I love that picture.
p109
aVI like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better,
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aVI like that picture for the moment.
p112
aVWhy do I use that picture?
p113
aVBecause that was very interesting, watching that experience as an old person.
p114
aVSo him and his friends,
p115
aVthey get together, they booked a room, like a church hall,
p116
aVand they got all their friends who had bands,
p117
aVand they got them together,
p118
aVand they do it all on Facebook,
p119
aVand then they sell tickets, and the first band on the -
p120
aVI was going to say "menu,"
p121
aVthat's probably the wrong word for it, isn't it?
p122
aVThe first band on the list of bands
p123
aVthat appears at some public music performance of some kind
p124
aVgets the sales from the first 20 tickets,
p125
aVthen the next band gets the next 20,
p126
aVand so on.
p127
aVThey were at the bottom of the menu,
p128
aVthey were like fifth, I thought they had no chance.
p129
aVHe actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right?
p130
aVBut my point is, that all worked perfectly,
p131
aVexcept on the web.
p132
aVSo they're sitting on Facebook,
p133
aVand they're sending these messages and arranging things
p134
aVand they don't know who anybody is, right?
p135
aVThat's the big problem we're trying to solve.
p136
aVIf only they were using the real names,
p137
aVThen you wouldn't be worried about them on the Internet.
p138
aVAnd so when he says to me,
p139
aV"Oh, I want to go to a chatroom to talk about guitars" or something,
p140
aVI'm like, "oh, well, I don't want you to go into a chatroom
p141
aVto talk about guitars, because they might not all be your friends,
p142
aVand some of the people that are in the chatroom
p143
aVmight be perverts and teachers and vicars."
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVI mean, they generally are, when you look in the paper, right?
p146
aVSo I want to know who all the people in the chatroom are.
p147
aVSo okay, you can go in the chatroom,
p148
aVbut only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names,
p149
aVand they submit full copies of their police report.
p150
aVBut of course, if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name,
p151
aVI'd say no. You can't give them your real name.
p152
aVBecause what happens if they turn out to be perverts,
p153
aVand teachers and whatever.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo you have this odd sort of paradox
p156
aVwhere I'm happy for him to go into this space
p157
aVif I know who everybody else is,
p158
aVbut I don't want anybody else to know who he is.
p159
aVAnd so you get this sort of logjam around identity
p160
aVwhere you want full disclosure from everybody else,
p161
aVbut not from yourself.
p162
aVAnd there's no progress, we get stuck.
p163
aVAnd so the chatroom thing doesn't work properly,
p164
aVand it's a very bad way of thinking about identity.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo on my RSS feed, I saw this thing about -
p167
aVI just said something bad about my RSS feed, didn't I?
p168
aVI should stop saying it like that.
p169
aVFor some random reason, I can't imagine,
p170
aVsomething about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox.
p171
aVAnd I read this story about cheerleaders,
p172
aVand it's a fascinating story.
p173
aVThis happened a couple of years ago in the U.S.
p174
aVThere were some cheerleaders in a team at a high school
p175
aVin the U.S., and they said mean things
p176
aVabout their cheerleading coach,
p177
aVas I'm sure kids do about all of their teachers
p178
aVall of the time,
p179
aVand somehow the cheerleading coach found out about this.
p180
aVShe was very upset.
p181
aVAnd so she went to one of the girls, and said,
p182
aV"you have to give me your Facebook password."
p183
aVI read this all the time, where even at some universities
p184
aVand places of education,
p185
aVkids are forced to hand over their Facebook passwords.
p186
aVSo you've got to give them your Facebook password.
p187
aVShe was a kid!
p188
aVWhat she should have said
p189
aVis, "my lawyer will be calling you
p190
aVfirst thing in the morning.
p191
aVIt's an outrageous imposition
p192
aVon my 4th Amendment right to privacy,
p193
aVand you're going to be sued
p194
aVfor all the money you've got."
p195
aVThat's what she should have said.
p196
aVBut she's a kid,
p197
aVso she hands over the password.
p198
aVThe teacher can't log into Facebook,
p199
aVbecause the school has blocked access to Facebook.
p200
aVSo the teacher can't log into Facebook until she gets home.
p201
aVSo the girl tells her friends,
p202
aVguess what happened?
p203
aVThe teacher logged in, she knows.
p204
aVSo the girls just all logged into Facebook on their phones,
p205
aVand deleted their profiles.
p206
aVAnd so when the teacher logged in, there was nothing there.
p207
aVMy point is, those identities, they don't think about them the same way.
p208
aa(lp209
VIdentity is, especially when you're a teenager, a fluid thing.
p210
aVYou have lots of identities.
p211
aVAnd you can have an identity, you don't like it,
p212
aVbecause it's subverted in some way, or it's insecure, or it's inappropriate,
p213
aVyou just delete it and get another one.
p214
aVThe idea that you have an identity that's given to you by someone,
p215
aVthe government or whatever,
p216
aVand you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places,
p217
aVthat's absolutely wrong.
p218
aVWhy would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook,
p219
aVunless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way?
p220
aVAnd it just doesn't work properly.
p221
aVAnd my fourth example is there are some cases
p222
aVwhere you really want to be -
p223
aVIn case you're wondering, that's me at the G20 protest.
p224
aVI wasn't actually at the G20 protest, but I had a meeting at a bank
p225
aVon the day of the G20 protest, and I got an email from the bank
p226
aVsaying please don't wear a suit, because it'll inflame the protesters.
p227
aVI look pretty good in a suit, frankly,
p228
aVso you can see why it would drive them
p229
aVinto an anti-capitalist frenzy.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aVSo I thought, well, look.
p232
aVIf I don't want to inflame the protesters,
p233
aVthe obvious thing to do
p234
aVis go dressed as a protester.
p235
aVSo I went dressed completely in black,
p236
aVyou know, with a black balaclava,
p237
aVI had black gloves on,
p238
aVbut I've taken them off to sign the visitor's book.
p239
aV(Laughter)
p240
aVI'm wearing black trousers, black boots,
p241
aVI'm dressed completely in black.
p242
aVI go into the bank at 10 o'clock,
p243
aVgo, "Hi, I'm Dave Birch,
p244
aVI've got a 3 o'clock with so and so there."
p245
aVSure. They sign me in.
p246
aVThere's my visitor's badge.
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VSo this nonsense
p250
aVabout you've got to have real names on Facebook and whatever,
p251
aVthat gets you that kind of security.
p252
aVThat gets you security theater, where there's no actual security,
p253
aVbut people are sort of playing parts in a play about security.
p254
aVAnd as long as everybody learns their lines,
p255
aVeveryone's happy.
p256
aVBut it's not real security.
p257
aVEspecially because I hate banks more than the G20 protesters do,
p258
aVbecause I work for them.
p259
aVI know that things are actually worse than these guys think.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVBut suppose I worked next to somebody in a bank
p262
aVwho was doing something.
p263
aVSuppose I was sitting next to a rogue trader,
p264
aVand I want to report it to the boss of the bank.
p265
aVSo I log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing.
p266
aVI send a message, this guy's a rogue trader.
p267
aVThat message is meaningless
p268
aVif you don't know that I'm a trader at the bank.
p269
aVIf that message just comes from anybody,
p270
aVit has zero information value.
p271
aVThere's no point in sending that message.
p272
aVBut if I have to prove who I am,
p273
aVI'll never send that message.
p274
aVIt's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon.
p275
aVThat message will only happen if I'm anonymous.
p276
aVSo the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there,
p277
aVotherwise we don't get where we want to get to.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo four issues. So what are we going to do about it?
p280
aVWell, what we tend to do about it
p281
aVis we think about Orwell space.
p282
aVAnd we try to make electronic versions
p283
aVof the identity card that we got rid of in 1953.
p284
aVSo we think if we had a card,
p285
aVcall it a Facebook login,
p286
aVwhich proves who you are,
p287
aVand I make you carry it all the time,
p288
aVthat solves the problem.
p289
aVAnd of course, for all those reasons I've just outlined,
p290
aVit doesn't, and it might, actually,
p291
aVmake some problems worse.
p292
aVThe more times you're forced to use your real identity,
p293
aVcertainly in transactional terms,
p294
aVthe more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted.
p295
aVThe goal is to stop people from using identity
p296
aVin transactions which don't need identity,
p297
aVwhich is actually almost all transactions.
p298
aVAlmost all of the transactions you do
p299
aVare not, who are you?
p300
aVThey're, are you allowed to drive the car,
p301
aVare you allowed in the building,
p302
aVare you over 18,
p303
aVetcetera, etcetera.
p304
aVSo my suggestion-I, like James,
p305
aVthink that there should be a resurgence of interest in R & D.
p306
aa(lp307
VI think this is a solvable problem.
p308
aVIt's something we can do about.
p309
aVNaturally, in these circumstances,
p310
aVI turn to Doctor Who.
p311
aVBecause in this,
p312
aVas in so many other walks of life,
p313
aVDoctor Who has already shown us the answer.
p314
aVSo I should say,
p315
aVfor some of our foreign visitors,
p316
aVDoctor Who is the greatest living scientist in England,
p317
aV(Laughter)
p318
aVand a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us.
p319
aVAnd this is Doctor Who with his psychic paper.
p320
aVCome on, you guys must have seen Doctor Who's psychic paper.
p321
aVYou're not nerds if you say yes.
p322
aVWho's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper?
p323
aVOh right, you were in the library the whole time studying I guess.
p324
aVIs that what you're going to tell us?
p325
aVDoctor Who's psychic paper
p326
aVis when you hold up the psychic paper,
p327
aVthe person, in their brain,
p328
aVsees the thing that they need to see.
p329
aVSo I want to show you a British passport,
p330
aVI hold up the psychic paper,
p331
aVyou see a British passport.
p332
aVI want to get into a party,
p333
aVI hold up the psychic paper,
p334
aVI show you a party invitation.
p335
aVYou see what you want to see.
p336
aVSo what I'm saying is we need to make an electronic version of that,
p337
aVbut with one tiny, tiny change,
p338
aVwhich is that it'll only show you the British passport
p339
aVif I've actually got one.
p340
aVIt'll only show you the party invitation
p341
aVif I actually have one.
p342
aVIt will only show you that I'm over 18 if I actually am over 18.
p343
aVBut nothing else.
p344
aVSo you're the bouncer at the pub, you need to know that I'm over 18,
p345
aVinstead of showing you my driving license,
p346
aVwhich shows you I know how to drive,
p347
aVwhat my name is, my address, all these kind of things,
p348
aVI show you my psychic paper,
p349
aVand all it tells you is am I over 18 or not.
p350
aVRight.
p351
aa(lp352
VIs that just a pipe dream?
p353
aVOf course not, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to you.
p354
aVSo in order to build that and make it work,
p355
aVI'm only going to name these things, I'll not go into them,
p356
aVwe need a plan,
p357
aVwhich is we're going to build this
p358
aVas an infrastructure for everybody to use,
p359
aVto solve all of these problems.
p360
aVWe're going to make a utility,
p361
aVthe utility has to be universal,
p362
aVyou can use it everywhere,
p363
aVI'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along.
p364
aVThat's a Japanese ATM,
p365
aVthe fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone.
p366
aVSo when you want to draw money out,
p367
aVyou put the mobile phone on the ATM,
p368
aVand touch your finger,
p369
aVyour fingerprint goes through to the phone,
p370
aVthe phone says yes, that's whoever,
p371
aVand the ATM then gives you some money.
p372
aVIt has to be a utility that you can use everywhere.
p373
aVIt has to be absolutely convenient,
p374
aVthat's me going into the pub.
p375
aVAll the device on the door of the pub is allowed is,
p376
aVis this person over 18 and not barred from the pub?
p377
aVAnd so the idea is, you touch your ID card to the door,
p378
aVand if I am allowed in, it shows my picture,
p379
aVif I'm not allowed in, it shows a red cross.
p380
aVIt doesn't disclose any other information.
p381
aVIt has to have no special gadgets.
p382
aVThat can only mean one thing,
p383
aVfollowing on from Ross's statement,
p384
aVwhich I agree with completely.
p385
aVIf it means no special gadgets,
p386
aVit has to run on a mobile phone.
p387
aVThat's the only choice we have,
p388
aVwe have to make it work on mobile phones.
p389
aVThere are 6.6 billion
p390
aVmobile phone subscriptions.
p391
aVMy favorite statistic of all time,
p392
aVonly 4 billion toothbrushes in the world.
p393
aVThat means something,
p394
aVI don't know what.
p395
aV(Laughter)
p396
aVI rely on our futurologists to tell me.
p397
aVIt has to be a utility which is extensible.
p398
aVSo it has to be something
p399
aVthat anybody could build on.
p400
aVAnybody should be able to use this infrastructure,
p401
aVyou don't need permissions, licenses, whatever,
p402
aVanyone should be able to write some code to do this.
p403
aa(lp404
VYou know what symmetry is,
p405
aVso you don't need a picture of it.
p406
aVThis is how we're going to do it.
p407
aVWe're going to do it using phones,
p408
aVand we're going to do it
p409
aVusing mobile proximity.
p410
aVI'm going to suggest to you
p411
aVthe technology to implement
p412
aVDoctor Who's psychic paper
p413
aVis already here, and if any of you
p414
aVhave got one of the new Barclay's debit cards
p415
aVwith the contactless interface on it,
p416
aVyou've already got that technology.
p417
aVIf you've ever been up to the big city,
p418
aVand used an Oyster card at all,
p419
aVdoes that ring any bells to anybody?
p420
aVThe technology already exists.
p421
aVThe first phones
p422
aVthat have the technology built in,
p423
aVthe Google Nexus, the S2,
p424
aVthe Samsung Wifi 7.9,
p425
aVthe first phones that have
p426
aVthe technology built into them
p427
aVare already in the shops.
p428
aVSo the idea that the gas man
p429
aVcan turn up at my mom's door
p430
aVand he can show my mom his phone,
p431
aVand she can tap it with her phone,
p432
aVand it will come up with green if he really is from British Gas
p433
aVand allowed in,
p434
aVand it'll come up with red if he isn't,

p436
aa(lp437
VWe have the technology to do that.
p438
aVAnd what's more,
p439
aValthough some of those things sounded a bit counter-intuitive,
p440
aVlike proving I'm over 18 without proving who I am,
p441
aVthe cryptography to do that not only exists,
p442
aVit's extremely well-known and well-understood.
p443
aVDigital signatures, the blinding of public key certificates,
p444
aVthese technologies have been around for a while,
p445
aVwe've just had no way of packaging them up.
p446
aVSo the technology already exists.
p447
aVWe know it works,
p448
aVThere are a few examples of the technology being used
p449
aVin experimental places.
p450
aVThat's London Fashion Week,
p451
aVwhere we built a system with O2,
p452
aVthat's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park,
p453
aVyou can see the persons
p454
aVwalking in with their VIP band,
p455
aVit's just being checked
p456
aVby the Nokia phone that's reading the band.
p457
aVI'm only putting those up to show you
p458
aVthese things are prosaic,
p459
aVthis stuff works in these environments.
p460
aVThey don't need to be special.
p461
aa(lp462
VSo finally, I know that you can do this,
p463
aVbecause if you saw the episode of Doctor Who,
p464
aVthe Easter special of Doctor Who,
p465
aVwhere he went to Mars in a bus,
p466
aVI should say again for our foreign students,
p467
aVthat doesn't happen every episode.
p468
aVThis was a very special case.
p469
aVSo in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus,
p470
aVI can't show you the clip,
p471
aVdue to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne-style copyright
p472
aVby the BBC,
p473
aVbut in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus,
p474
aVDoctor Who is clearly shown getting on to the bus
p475
aVwith the Oyster card reader
p476
aVusing his psychic paper.
p477
aVWhich proves that psychic paper
p478
aVhas an MSE interface.
p479
aVThank you very much.

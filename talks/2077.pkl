VToday I want to tell you
p5
aVabout a project being carried out
p6
aVby scientists all over the world
p7
aVto paint a neural portrait of the human mind.
p8
aVAnd the central idea of this work
p9
aVis that the human mind and brain
p10
aVis not a single, general-purpose processor,
p11
aVbut a collection of highly specialized components,
p12
aVeach solving a different specific problem,
p13
aVand yet collectively making up
p14
aVwho we are as human beings and thinkers.
p15
aVTo give you a feel for this idea,
p16
aa(lp17
Vimagine the following scenario:
p18
aVYou walk into your child's day care center.
p19
aVAs usual, there's a dozen kids there
p20
aVwaiting to get picked up,
p21
aVbut this time,
p22
aVthe children's faces look weirdly similar,
p23
aVand you can't figure out which child is yours.
p24
aVDo you need new glasses?
p25
aVAre you losing your mind?
p26
aVYou run through a quick mental checklist.
p27
aVNo, you seem to be thinking clearly,
p28
aVand your vision is perfectly sharp.
p29
aVAnd everything looks normal
p30
aVexcept the children's faces.
p31
aVYou can see the faces,
p32
aVbut they don't look distinctive,
p33
aVand none of them looks familiar,
p34
aVand it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon
p35
aVthat you find your daughter.
p36
aa(lp37
VThis sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces
p38
aVactually happens to people.
p39
aVIt's called prosopagnosia,
p40
aVand it results from damage
p41
aVto a particular part of the brain.
p42
aVThe striking thing about it
p43
aVis that only face recognition is impaired;
p44
aVeverything else is just fine.
p45
aa(lp46
VProsopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific
p47
aVmental deficits that can happen after brain damage.
p48
aVThese syndromes collectively
p49
aVhave suggested for a long time
p50
aVthat the mind is divvied up into distinct components,
p51
aVbut the effort to discover those components
p52
aVhas jumped to warp speed
p53
aVwith the invention of brain imaging technology,
p54
aVespecially MRI.
p55
aVSo MRI enables you to see internal anatomy
p56
aVat high resolution,
p57
aVso I'm going to show you in a second
p58
aVa set of MRI cross-sectional images
p59
aVthrough a familiar object,
p60
aVand we're going to fly through them
p61
aVand you're going to try to figure out what the object is.
p62
aVHere we go.
p63
aa(lp64
VIt's not that easy. It's an artichoke.
p65
aa(lp66
VOkay, let's try another one,
p67
aVstarting from the bottom and going through the top.
p68
aVBroccoli! It's a head of broccoli.
p69
aVIsn't it beautiful? I love that.
p70
aa(lp71
VOkay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course.
p72
aVIn fact, it's my brain.
p73
aVWe're going through slices through my head like that.
p74
aVThat's my nose over on the right, and now
p75
aVwe're going over here, right there.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo this picture's nice, if I do say so myself,
p78
aVbut it shows only anatomy.
p79
aVThe really cool advance with functional imaging
p80
aVhappened when scientists figured out how to make
p81
aVpictures that show not just anatomy but activity,
p82
aVthat is, where neurons are firing.
p83
aVSo here's how this works.
p84
aVBrains are like muscles.
p85
aVWhen they get active,
p86
aVthey need increased blood flow to supply that activity,
p87
aVand lucky for us, blood flow control to the brain is local,
p88
aVso if a bunch of neurons, say, right there
p89
aVget active and start firing,
p90
aVthen blood flow increases just right there.
p91
aVSo functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase,
p92
aVproducing a higher MRI response
p93
aVwhere neural activity goes up.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo to give you a concrete feel
p96
aVfor how a functional MRI experiment goes
p97
aVand what you can learn from it
p98
aVand what you can't,
p99
aVlet me describe one of the first studies I ever did.
p100
aVWe wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces,
p101
aVand there was already reason to think there might be such a thing
p102
aVbased on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia
p103
aVthat I described a moment ago,
p104
aVbut nobody had ever seen that part of the brain
p105
aVin a normal person,
p106
aVso we set out to look for it.
p107
aVSo I was the first subject.
p108
aVI went into the scanner, I lay on my back,
p109
aVI held my head as still as I could
p110
aVwhile staring at pictures of faces like these
p111
aVand objects like these
p112
aVand faces and objects for hours.
p113
aVSo as somebody who has pretty close to the world record
p114
aVof total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner,
p115
aVI can tell you that one of the skills
p116
aVthat's really important for MRI research
p117
aVis bladder control.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VWhen I got out of the scanner,
p121
aVI did a quick analysis of the data,
p122
aVlooking for any parts of my brain
p123
aVthat produced a higher response when I was looking at faces
p124
aVthan when I was looking at objects,
p125
aVand here's what I saw.
p126
aVNow this image looks just awful by today's standards,
p127
aVbut at the time I thought it was beautiful.
p128
aVWhat it shows is that region right there,
p129
aVthat little blob,
p130
aVit's about the size of an olive
p131
aVand it's on the bottom surface of my brain
p132
aVabout an inch straight in from right there.
p133
aVAnd what that part of my brain is doing
p134
aVis producing a higher MRI response,
p135
aVthat is, higher neural activity,
p136
aVwhen I was looking at faces
p137
aVthan when I was looking at objects.
p138
aVSo that's pretty cool,
p139
aVbut how do we know this isn't a fluke?
p140
aVWell, the easiest way
p141
aVis to just do the experiment again.
p142
aVSo I got back in the scanner,
p143
aVI looked at more faces and I looked at more objects
p144
aVand I got a similar blob,
p145
aVand then I did it again
p146
aVand I did it again
p147
aVand again and again,
p148
aVand around about then
p149
aVI decided to believe it was for real.
p150
aVBut still, maybe this is something weird about my brain
p151
aVand no one else has one of these things in there,
p152
aVso to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people
p153
aVand found that pretty much everyone
p154
aVhas that little face-processing region
p155
aVin a similar neighborhood of the brain.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo the next question was,
p158
aVwhat does this thing really do?
p159
aVIs it really specialized just for face recognition?
p160
aVWell, maybe not, right?
p161
aVMaybe it responds not only to faces
p162
aVbut to any body part.
p163
aVMaybe it responds to anything human
p164
aVor anything alive
p165
aVor anything round.
p166
aVThe only way to be really sure that that region
p167
aVis specialized for face recognition
p168
aVis to rule out all of those hypotheses.
p169
aVSo we spent much of the next couple of years
p170
aVscanning subjects while they looked at lots
p171
aVof different kinds of images,
p172
aVand we showed that that part of the brain
p173
aVresponds strongly when you look at
p174
aVany images that are faces of any kind,
p175
aVand it responds much less strongly
p176
aVto any image you show that isn't a face,
p177
aVlike some of these.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo have we finally nailed the case
p180
aVthat this region is necessary for face recognition?
p181
aVNo, we haven't.
p182
aVBrain imaging can never tell you
p183
aVif a region is necessary for anything.
p184
aVAll you can do with brain imaging
p185
aVis watch regions turn on and off
p186
aVas people think different thoughts.
p187
aVTo tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function,
p188
aVyou need to mess with it and see what happens,
p189
aVand normally we don't get to do that.
p190
aVBut an amazing opportunity came about
p191
aVvery recently when a couple of colleagues of mine
p192
aVtested this man who has epilepsy
p193
aVand who is shown here in his hospital bed
p194
aVwhere he's just had electrodes placed
p195
aVon the surface of his brain
p196
aVto identify the source of his seizures.
p197
aVSo it turned out by total chance
p198
aVthat two of the electrodes
p199
aVhappened to be right on top of his face area.
p200
aVSo with the patient's consent,
p201
aVthe doctors asked him what happened
p202
aVwhen they electrically stimulated that part of his brain.
p203
aVNow, the patient doesn't know
p204
aVwhere those electrodes are,
p205
aVand he's never heard of the face area.
p206
aVSo let's watch what happens.
p207
aVIt's going to start with a control condition
p208
aVthat will say "Sham" nearly invisibly
p209
aVin red in the lower left,
p210
aVwhen no current is delivered,
p211
aVand you'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first. So let's watch.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Video) Neurologist: Okay, just look at my face
p214
aVand tell me what happens when I do this.
p215
aVAll right?
p216
aa(lp217
VPatient: Okay.
p218
aa(lp219
VNeurologist: One, two, three.
p220
aa(lp221
VPatient: Nothing. Neurologist: Nothing? Okay.
p222
aVI'm going to do it one more time.
p223
aVLook at my face.
p224
aVOne, two, three.
p225
aa(lp226
VPatient: You just turned into somebody else.
p227
aVYour face metamorphosed.
p228
aVYour nose got saggy, it went to the left.
p229
aVYou almost looked like somebody I'd seen before,
p230
aVbut somebody different.
p231
aVThat was a trip.
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VNancy Kanwisher: So this experiment \u2014
p235
aV(Applause) \u2014
p236
aVthis experiment finally nails the case
p237
aVthat this region of the brain is not only
p238
aVselectively responsive to faces
p239
aVbut causally involved in face perception.
p240
aVSo I went through all of these details
p241
aVabout the face region to show you what it takes
p242
aVto really establish that a part of the brain
p243
aVis selectively involved in a specific mental process.
p244
aVNext, I'll go through much more quickly
p245
aVsome of the other specialized regions of the brain
p246
aVthat we and others have found.
p247
aVSo to do this, I've spent a lot of time
p248
aVin the scanner over the last month
p249
aVso I can show you these things in my brain.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere.
p252
aVSo we're oriented like that. You're looking at my head this way.
p253
aVImagine taking the skull off
p254
aVand looking at the surface of the brain like that.
p255
aVOkay, now as you can see,
p256
aVthe surface of the brain is all folded up.
p257
aVSo that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.
p258
aVWe want to see the whole thing,
p259
aVso let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing.
p260
aVNext, let's find that face area I've been talking about
p261
aVthat responds to images like these.
p262
aVTo see that, let's turn the brain around
p263
aVand look on the inside surface on the bottom,
p264
aVand there it is, that's my face area.
p265
aVJust to the right of that is another region
p266
aVthat is shown in purple
p267
aVthat responds when you process color information,
p268
aVand near those regions are other regions
p269
aVthat are involved in perceiving places,
p270
aVlike right now, I'm seeing this layout of space around me
p271
aVand these regions in green right there
p272
aVare really active.
p273
aVThere's another one out on the outside surface again
p274
aVwhere there's a couple more face regions as well.
p275
aVAlso in this vicinity
p276
aVis a region that's selectively involved
p277
aVin processing visual motion,
p278
aVlike these moving dots here,
p279
aVand that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain,
p280
aVand near that is a region that responds
p281
aVwhen you look at images of bodies and body parts
p282
aVlike these, and that region is shown in lime green
p283
aVat the bottom of the brain.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow all these regions I've shown you so far
p286
aVare involved in specific aspects of visual perception.
p287
aVDo we also have specialized brain regions
p288
aVfor other senses, like hearing?
p289
aVYes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit,
p290
aVhere's a region in dark blue
p291
aVthat we reported just a couple of months ago,
p292
aVand this region responds strongly
p293
aVwhen you hear sounds with pitch, like these.
p294
aV(Sirens)
p295
aV(Cello music)
p296
aV(Doorbell)
p297
aVIn contrast, that same region does not respond strongly
p298
aVwhen you hear perfectly familiar sounds
p299
aVthat don't have a clear pitch, like these.
p300
aV(Chomping)
p301
aV(Drum roll)
p302
aV(Toilet flushing)
p303
aa(lp304
VOkay. Next to the pitch region
p305
aVis another set of regions that are selectively responsive
p306
aVwhen you hear the sounds of speech.
p307
aa(lp308
VOkay, now let's look at these same regions.
p309
aVIn my left hemisphere, there's a similar arrangement \u2014
p310
aVnot identical, but similar \u2014
p311
aVand most of the same regions are in here,
p312
aValbeit sometimes different in size.
p313
aa(lp314
VNow, everything I've shown you so far
p315
aVare regions that are involved in different aspects of perception,
p316
aVvision and hearing.
p317
aVDo we also have specialized brain regions
p318
aVfor really fancy, complicated mental processes?
p319
aVYes, we do.
p320
aVSo here in pink are my language regions.
p321
aVSo it's been known for a very long time
p322
aVthat that general vicinity of the brain
p323
aVis involved in processing language,
p324
aVbut we showed very recently
p325
aVthat these pink regions
p326
aVrespond extremely selectively.
p327
aVThey respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence,
p328
aVbut not when you do other complex mental things,
p329
aVlike mental arithmetic
p330
aVor holding information in memory
p331
aVor appreciating the complex structure
p332
aVin a piece of music.
p333
aa(lp334
VThe most amazing region that's been found yet
p335
aVis this one right here in turquoise.
p336
aVThis region responds
p337
aVwhen you think about what another person is thinking.
p338
aVSo that may seem crazy,
p339
aVbut actually, we humans do this all the time.
p340
aVYou're doing this when you realize
p341
aVthat your partner is going to be worried
p342
aVif you don't call home to say you're running late.
p343
aVI'm doing this with that region of my brain right now
p344
aVwhen I realize that you guys
p345
aVare probably now wondering about
p346
aVall that gray, uncharted territory in the brain,
p347
aVand what's up with that?
p348
aa(lp349
VWell, I'm wondering about that too,
p350
aVand we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now
p351
aVto try to find a number of other
p352
aVpossible specializations in the brain
p353
aVfor other very specific mental functions.
p354
aVBut importantly, I don't think we have
p355
aVspecializations in the brain
p356
aVfor every important mental function,
p357
aVeven mental functions that may be critical for survival.
p358
aVIn fact, a few years ago,
p359
aVthere was a scientist in my lab
p360
aVwho became quite convinced
p361
aVthat he'd found a brain region
p362
aVfor detecting food,
p363
aVand it responded really strongly in the scanner
p364
aVwhen people looked at images like this.
p365
aVAnd further, he found a similar response
p366
aVin more or less the same location
p367
aVin 10 out of 12 subjects.
p368
aVSo he was pretty stoked,
p369
aVand he was running around the lab
p370
aVtelling everyone that he was going to go on "Oprah"
p371
aVwith his big discovery.
p372
aVBut then he devised the critical test:
p373
aVHe showed subjects images of food like this
p374
aVand compared them to images with very similar
p375
aVcolor and shape, but that weren't food, like these.
p376
aVAnd his region responded the same
p377
aVto both sets of images.
p378
aVSo it wasn't a food area,
p379
aVit was just a region that liked colors and shapes.
p380
aVSo much for "Oprah."
p381
aa(lp382
VBut then the question, of course, is,
p383
aVhow do we process all this other stuff
p384
aVthat we don't have specialized brain regions for?
p385
aVWell, I think the answer is that in addition
p386
aVto these highly specialized components that I've been describing,
p387
aVwe also have a lot of very general- purpose machinery in our heads
p388
aVthat enables us to tackle
p389
aVwhatever problem comes along.
p390
aVIn fact, we've shown recently that
p391
aVthese regions here in white
p392
aVrespond whenever you do any difficult mental task
p393
aVat all \u2014
p394
aVwell, of the seven that we've tested.
p395
aVSo each of the brain regions that I've described
p396
aVto you today
p397
aVis present in approximately the same location
p398
aVin every normal subject.
p399
aVI could take any of you,
p400
aVpop you in the scanner,
p401
aVand find each of those regions in your brain,
p402
aVand it would look a lot like my brain,
p403
aValthough the regions would be slightly different
p404
aVin their exact location and in their size.
p405
aa(lp406
VWhat's important to me about this work
p407
aVis not the particular locations of these brain regions,
p408
aVbut the simple fact that we have
p409
aVselective, specific components of mind and brain
p410
aVin the first place.
p411
aVI mean, it could have been otherwise.
p412
aVThe brain could have been a single,
p413
aVgeneral-purpose processor,
p414
aVmore like a kitchen knife
p415
aVthan a Swiss Army knife.
p416
aVInstead, what brain imaging has delivered
p417
aVis this rich and interesting picture of the human mind.
p418
aVSo we have this picture of very general-purpose
p419
aVmachinery in our heads
p420
aVin addition to this surprising array
p421
aVof very specialized components.
p422
aa(lp423
VIt's early days in this enterprise.
p424
aVWe've painted only the first brushstrokes
p425
aVin our neural portrait of the human mind.
p426
aVThe most fundamental questions remain unanswered.
p427
aVSo for example, what does each of these regions do exactly?
p428
aVWhy do we need three face areas
p429
aVand three place areas,
p430
aVand what's the division of labor between them?
p431
aVSecond, how are all these things
p432
aVconnected in the brain?
p433
aVWith diffusion imaging,
p434
aVyou can trace bundles of neurons
p435
aVthat connect to different parts of the brain,
p436
aVand with this method shown here,
p437
aVyou can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain,
p438
aVpotentially someday giving us a wiring diagram
p439
aVof the entire human brain.
p440
aVThird, how does all of this
p441
aVvery systematic structure get built,
p442
aVboth over development in childhood
p443
aVand over the evolution of our species?
p444
aVTo address questions like that,
p445
aVscientists are now scanning
p446
aVother species of animals,
p447
aVand they're also scanning human infants.
p448
aa(lp449
VMany people justify the high cost of neuroscience research
p450
aVby pointing out that it may help us someday
p451
aVto treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism.
p452
aVThat's a hugely important goal,
p453
aVand I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it,
p454
aVbut fixing things that are broken in the world
p455
aVis not the only thing that's worth doing.
p456
aVThe effort to understand the human mind and brain
p457
aVis worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment
p458
aVof a single disease.
p459
aVWhat could be more thrilling
p460
aVthan to understand the fundamental mechanisms
p461
aVthat underlie human experience,
p462
aVto understand, in essence, who we are?
p463
aVThis is, I think, the greatest scientific quest
p464
aVof all time.

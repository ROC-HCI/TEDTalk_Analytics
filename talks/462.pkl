VIn his inaugural address,
p5
aVBarack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best
p6
aVas we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.
p7
aVBut what did he appeal to?
p8
aVHe did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,
p9
aVand tell us to just go shopping.
p10
aVNor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.
p11
aVInvest, invest, invest."
p12
aVInstead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.
p13
aVAnd he appealed to virtue.
p14
aVVirtue is an old-fashioned word.
p15
aVIt seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.
p16
aVAnd besides, some of you might be wondering,
p17
aVwhat the hell does it mean?
p18
aa(lp19
VLet me begin with an example.
p20
aVThis is the job description of a hospital janitor
p21
aVthat is scrolling up on the screen.
p22
aVAnd all of the items on it are unremarkable.
p23
aVThey're the things you would expect:
p24
aVmop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.
p25
aVIt may be a little surprising how many things there are,
p26
aVbut it's not surprising what they are.
p27
aVBut the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:
p28
aVeven though this is a very long list,
p29
aVthere isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.
p30
aVNot one.
p31
aVThe janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors
p34
aVto get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,
p35
aVthey encountered Mike,
p36
aVwho told them about how he stopped mopping the floor
p37
aVbecause Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,
p38
aVtrying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.
p39
aVAnd Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition
p40
aVand didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge
p41
aVbecause there were some family members who were there all day, every day
p42
aVwho, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.
p43
aVAnd then there was Luke,
p44
aVwho washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice
p45
aVbecause the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,
p46
aVdidn't see Luke do it the first time,
p47
aVand his father was angry.
p48
aVAnd behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses
p49
aVand, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,
p50
aVdoesn't just make people feel a little better,
p51
aVit actually improves the quality of patient care
p52
aVand enables hospitals to run well.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, not all janitors are like this, of course.
p55
aVBut the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions
p56
aVinvolving kindness, care and empathy
p57
aVare an essential part of the job.
p58
aVAnd yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.
p59
aVThese janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.
p60
aVAnd beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.
p61
aa(lp62
V"Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us,
p63
aV"is the combination of moral will and moral skill."
p64
aVA wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,
p65
aVas the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.
p66
aVA wise person knows how to improvise,
p67
aVas Luke did when he re-washed the floor.
p68
aVReal-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined
p69
aVand the context is always changing.
p70
aVA wise person is like a jazz musician \u2014
p71
aVusing the notes on the page, but dancing around them,
p72
aVinventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.
p73
aVA wise person knows how to use these moral skills
p74
aVin the service of the right aims.
p75
aVTo serve other people, not to manipulate other people.
p76
aVAnd finally, perhaps most important,
p77
aVa wise person is made, not born.
p78
aVWisdom depends on experience,
p79
aVand not just any experience.
p80
aVYou need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.
p81
aVYou need permission to be allowed to improvise,
p82
aVtry new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.
p83
aVAnd you need to be mentored by wise teachers.
p84
aa(lp85
VWhen you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described
p86
aVhow hard it is to learn to do their job,
p87
aVthey tell you that it takes lots of experience.
p88
aVAnd they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.
p89
aVIt takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.
p90
aVAt TED, brilliance is rampant.
p91
aVIt's scary.
p92
aVThe good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.
p93
aVThe bad news is that without wisdom,
p94
aVbrilliance isn't enough.
p95
aVIt's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.
p96
aV(Applause)
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, I hope that we all know this.
p99
aVThere's a sense in which it's obvious,
p100
aVand yet, let me tell you a little story.
p101
aVIt's a story about lemonade.
p102
aVA dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.
p103
aVHis son asked him for some lemonade
p104
aVand Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.
p105
aVAll they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,
p106
aVwhich was five percent alcohol.
p107
aVDad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.
p108
aVSo he brought it back.
p109
aVAnd the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,
p110
aVand called the police, who called an ambulance
p111
aVthat rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.
p112
aVThe emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.
p113
aVAnd they were ready to let the kid go.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut not so fast.
p116
aVThe Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.
p117
aVAnd the child was sent to a foster home for three days.
p118
aVAt that point, can the child go home?
p119
aVWell, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.
p120
aVAfter two weeks, I'm happy to report,
p121
aVthe family was reunited.
p122
aVBut the welfare workers and the ambulance people
p123
aVand the judge all said the same thing:
p124
aV"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."
p125
aa(lp126
VHow do things like this happen?
p127
aVScott Simon, who told this story on NPR,
p128
aVsaid, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,
p129
aVbut they spare you from thinking."
p130
aVAnd, to be fair, rules are often imposed
p131
aVbecause previous officials have been lax
p132
aVand they let a child go back to an abusive household.
p133
aVFair enough.
p134
aVWhen things go wrong, as of course they do,
p135
aVwe reach for two tools to try to fix them.
p136
aa(lp137
VOne tool we reach for is rules.
p138
aVBetter ones, more of them.
p139
aVThe second tool we reach for is incentives.
p140
aVBetter ones, more of them.
p141
aVWhat else, after all, is there?
p142
aVWe can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.
p143
aVRegulate, regulate, regulate.
p144
aVFix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...
p145
aVThe truth is that neither rules nor incentives
p146
aVare enough to do the job.
p147
aVHow could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?
p148
aVAnd would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?
p149
aVIt's preposterous on its face.
p150
aVAnd what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,
p151
aVrules and incentives may make things better in the short run,
p152
aVbut they create a downward spiral
p153
aVthat makes them worse in the long run.
p154
aVMoral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules
p155
aVthat deprives us of the opportunity
p156
aVto improvise and learn from our improvisations.
p157
aVAnd moral will is undermined
p158
aVby an incessant appeal to incentives
p159
aVthat destroy our desire to do the right thing.
p160
aVAnd without intending it,
p161
aVby appealing to rules and incentives,
p162
aVwe are engaging in a war on wisdom.
p163
aa(lp164
VLet me just give you a few examples,
p165
aVfirst of rules and the war on moral skill.
p166
aVThe lemonade story is one.
p167
aVSecond, no doubt more familiar to you,
p168
aVis the nature of modern American education:
p169
aVscripted, lock-step curricula.
p170
aVHere's an example from Chicago kindergarten.
p171
aVReading and enjoying literature
p172
aVand words that begin with 'B.'
p173
aV"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug
p174
aVand give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.
p175
aVSay 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.
p176
aVAll over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,
p177
aVevery teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.
p178
aVWe know why these scripts are there.
p179
aVWe don't trust the judgment of teachers enough
p180
aVto let them loose on their own.
p181
aVScripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.
p182
aVAnd they prevent disaster.
p183
aVBut what they assure in its place is mediocrity.
p184
aV(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VDon't get me wrong. We need rules!
p187
aVJazz musicians need some notes \u2014
p188
aVmost of them need some notes on the page.
p189
aVWe need more rules for the bankers, God knows.
p190
aVBut too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians
p191
aVfrom improvising.
p192
aVAnd as a result, they lose their gifts,
p193
aVor worse, they stop playing altogether.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, how about incentives?
p196
aVThey seem cleverer.
p197
aVIf you have one reason for doing something
p198
aVand I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,
p199
aVit seems only logical that two reasons are better than one
p200
aVand you're more likely to do it.
p201
aVRight?
p202
aVWell, not always.
p203
aVSometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another
p204
aVinstead of complimenting,
p205
aVand they make people less likely to do it.
p206
aa(lp207
VI'll just give you one example because time is racing.
p208
aVIn Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,
p209
aVthey were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.
p210
aVThere was going to be a national referendum.
p211
aVSome psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.
p212
aVAnd they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"
p213
aVAstonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.
p214
aVThey knew it was dangerous.
p215
aVThey thought it would reduce their property values.
p216
aVBut it had to go somewhere
p217
aVand they had responsibilities as citizens.
p218
aVThe psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.
p219
aVThey said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every year
p220
aVwould you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"
p221
aVTwo reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.
p222
aVInstead of 50 percent saying yes,
p223
aV25 percent said yes.
p224
aVWhat happens is that
p225
aVthe second this introduction of incentive gets us
p226
aVso that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"
p227
aVall we ask is, "What serves my interests?"
p228
aVWhen incentives don't work,
p229
aVwhen CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies
p230
aVin pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,
p231
aVthe response is always the same.
p232
aVGet smarter incentives.
p233
aa(lp234
VThe truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise
p235
aVthat are ever going to be smart enough.
p236
aVAny incentive system can be subverted by bad will.
p237
aVWe need incentives. People have to make a living.
p238
aVBut excessive reliance on incentives
p239
aVdemoralizes professional activity
p240
aVin two senses of that word.
p241
aVIt causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale
p242
aVand it causes the activity itself to lose morality.
p243
aa(lp244
VBarack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,
p245
aV"We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'"
p246
aVAnd when professions are demoralized,
p247
aVeveryone in them becomes dependent on \u2014 addicted to \u2014 incentives
p248
aVand they stop asking "Is it right?"
p249
aVWe see this in medicine.
p250
aV("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit.")
p251
aVAnd we certainly see it in the world of business.
p252
aV("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.")
p253
aV("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.")
p254
aVIt is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo what can we do?
p257
aVA few sources of hope:
p258
aVwe ought to try to re-moralize work.
p259
aVOne way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.
p260
aV(Applause)
p261
aVThere is no better way to show people that you're not serious
p262
aVthan to tie up everything you have to say about ethics
p263
aVinto a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.
p264
aa(lp265
VWhat to do instead?
p266
aVOne: Celebrate moral exemplars.
p267
aVAcknowledge, when you go to law school,
p268
aVthat a little voice is whispering in your ear
p269
aVabout Atticus Finch.
p270
aVNo 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.
p271
aVPeople are inspired by moral heroes.
p272
aVBut we learn that with sophistication
p273
aVcomes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.
p274
aVWell, acknowledge them.
p275
aVBe proud that you have them.
p276
aVCelebrate them.
p277
aVAnd demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.
p278
aVThat's one thing we can do.
p279
aa(lp280
VI don't know how many of you remember this:
p281
aVanother moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,
p282
aVwho was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts \u2014
p283
aVthey made Polartec \u2014
p284
aVThe factory burned down.
p285
aV3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.
p286
aVWhy? Because it would have been a disaster for them
p287
aVand for the community if he had let them go.
p288
aV"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,
p289
aVbut I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."
p290
aa(lp291
VJust at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.
p292
aVTwo were particularly inspiring to me.
p293
aVOne was Ray Anderson, who turned \u2014
p294
aV(Applause)
p295
aV\u2014 turned, you know, a part of the evil empire
p296
aVinto a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.
p297
aVWhy? Because it was the right thing to do.
p298
aVAnd a bonus he's discovering is
p299
aVhe's actually going to make even more money.
p300
aVHis employees are inspired by the effort.
p301
aVWhy? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.
p302
aVYesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.
p303
aV(Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
VIn many ways this is the perfect example.
p306
aVBecause it took the will to do the right thing.
p307
aVGod knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.
p308
aVI'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know
p309
aVin order to plot this out.
p310
aVBut most important to make it work \u2014
p311
aVand he emphasized this \u2014
p312
aVis that it took knowing the people in the communities.
p313
aVUnless the people you're working with are behind you,
p314
aVthis will fail.
p315
aVAnd there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,
p316
aVbecause different people in different communities
p317
aVorganize their lives in different ways.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.
p320
aVAnd you don't have to be a mega-hero.
p321
aVThere are ordinary heroes.
p322
aVOrdinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.
p323
aVAs practitioners each and every one of us should strive
p324
aVto be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.
p325
aVAs heads of organizations,
p326
aVwe should strive to create environments
p327
aVthat encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.
p328
aVEven the wisest and most well-meaning people
p329
aVwill give up if they have to swim against the current
p330
aVin the organizations in which they work.
p331
aa(lp332
VIf you run an organization, you should be sure
p333
aVthat none of the jobs \u2014 none of the jobs \u2014
p334
aVhave job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.
p335
aVBecause the truth is that
p336
aVany work that you do that involves interaction with other people
p337
aVis moral work.
p338
aVAnd any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd, perhaps most important,
p341
aVas teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,
p342
aVthe moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.
p343
aVAnd there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.
p344
aVOne is that we are always teaching.
p345
aVSomeone is always watching.
p346
aVThe camera is always on.
p347
aVBill Gates talked about the importance of education
p348
aVand, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:
p349
aV"Knowledge is power."
p350
aVAnd he talked about a lot of the wonderful things
p351
aVthat KIPP is doing
p352
aVto take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.
p353
aa(lp354
VI want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing
p355
aVthat Bill didn't mention.
p356
aVThat is that they have come to the realization
p357
aVthat the single most important thing kids need to learn
p358
aVis character.
p359
aVThey need to learn to respect themselves.
p360
aVThey need to learn to respect their schoolmates.
p361
aVThey need to learn to respect their teachers.
p362
aVAnd, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.
p363
aVThat's the principle objective.
p364
aVIf you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.
p365
aVAnd the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids
p366
aVis by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.
p367
aa(lp368
VObama appealed to virtue.
p369
aVAnd I think he was right.
p370
aVAnd the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,
p371
aVbecause it's what allows other virtues \u2014 honesty, kindness, courage and so on \u2014
p372
aVto be displayed at the right time and in the right way.
p373
aVHe also appealed to hope.
p374
aVRight again.
p375
aVI think there is reason for hope.
p376
aVI think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.
p377
aa(lp378
VIn many ways, it's what TED is all about.
p379
aVWanting to do the right thing
p380
aVin the right way
p381
aVfor the right reasons.
p382
aVThis kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us
p383
aVif only we start paying attention.
p384
aVPaying attention to what we do,
p385
aVto how we do it,
p386
aVand, perhaps most importantly,
p387
aVto the structure of the organizations within which we work,
p388
aVso as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom
p389
aVrather than having it suppressed.
p390
aa(lp391
VThank you very much.
p392
aVThank you.
p393
aV(Applause)
p394
aa(lp395
VChris Anderson: You have to go and stand out here a sec.
p396
aa(lp397

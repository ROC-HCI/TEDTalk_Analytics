VHans Rosling: I'm going to ask you
p5
aVthree multiple choice questions.
p6
aVUse this device. Use this device to answer.
p7
aVThe first question is, how did the number
p8
aVof deaths per year
p9
aVfrom natural disaster,
p10
aVhow did that change during the last century?
p11
aVDid it more than double,
p12
aVdid it remain about the same in the world as a whole,
p13
aVor did it decrease to less than half?
p14
aVPlease answer A, B or C.
p15
aVI see lots of answers. This is much faster than I do it at universities.
p16
aVThey are so slow. They keep thinking, thinking, thinking.
p17
aVOh, very, very good.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd we go to the next question.
p20
aVSo how long did women 30 years old
p21
aVin the world go to school:
p22
aVseven years, five years or three years?
p23
aVA, B or C? Please answer.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd we go to the next question.
p26
aVIn the last 20 years, how did the percentage
p27
aVof people in the world
p28
aVwho live in extreme poverty change?
p29
aVExtreme poverty \u2014 not having  enough food for the day.
p30
aVDid it almost double,
p31
aVdid it remain more or less the same,
p32
aVor did it halve?
p33
aVA, B or C?
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, answers.
p36
aVYou see,
p37
aVdeaths from natural disasters in the world,
p38
aVyou can see it from this graph here,
p39
aVfrom 1900 to 2000.
p40
aVIn 1900, there was about half a million people
p41
aVwho died every year from natural disasters:
p42
aVfloods, earthquakes, volcanic  eruption, whatever, droughts.
p43
aVAnd then, how did that change?
p44
aa(lp45
VGapminder asked the public in Sweden.
p46
aVThis is how they answered.
p47
aVThe Swedish public answered like this:
p48
aVFifty percent thought it had doubled,
p49
aV38 percent said it's more or less the same,
p50
aV12 said it had halved.
p51
aVThis is the best data from the disaster researchers,
p52
aVand it goes up and down,
p53
aVand it goes to the Second World War,
p54
aVand after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling
p55
aVand it's down to much less than half.
p56
aVThe world has been much, much more capable
p57
aVas the decades go by
p58
aVto protect people from this, you know.
p59
aVSo only 12 percent of the Swedes know this.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps.
p62
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p63
aVThe chimps don't watch the evening news,
p64
aVso the chimps,
p65
aVthey choose by random, so the Swedes answer worse than random.
p66
aVNow how did you do?
p67
aVThat's you.
p68
aVYou were beaten by the chimps.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVBut it was close.
p71
aVYou were three times better than the Swedes,
p72
aVbut that's not enough.
p73
aVYou shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.
p74
aVYou must have higher ambitions in the world.
p75
aa(lp76
VLet's look at the next answer here: women in school.
p77
aVHere, you can see men went eight years.
p78
aVHow long did women go to school?
p79
aVWell, we asked the Swedes like this,
p80
aVand that gives you a hint, doesn't it?
p81
aVThe right answer is probably the one
p82
aVthe fewest Swedes picked, isn't it?
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVLet's see, let's see. Here we come.
p85
aVYes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up.
p86
aVThis is the U.S. public.
p87
aVAnd this is you. Here you come.
p88
aVOoh.
p89
aVWell, congratulations, you're twice as good as the Swedes,
p90
aVbut you don't need me \u2014
p91
aa(lp92
VSo how come? I think it's like this,
p93
aVthat everyone is aware that there are countries
p94
aVand there are areas
p95
aVwhere girls have great difficulties.
p96
aVThey are stopped when they go to school,
p97
aVand it's disgusting.
p98
aVBut in the majority of the world,
p99
aVwhere most people in the world live,
p100
aVmost countries, girls today go to school
p101
aVas long as boys, more or less.
p102
aVThat doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved,
p103
aVnot at all.
p104
aVThey still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations,
p105
aVbut schooling is there in the world today.
p106
aVNow, we miss the majority.
p107
aVWhen you answer, you answer according to the worst places,
p108
aVand there you are right, but you miss the majority.
p109
aa(lp110
VWhat about poverty?
p111
aVWell, it's very clear that poverty here
p112
aVwas almost halved,
p113
aVand in U.S., when we asked the public,
p114
aVonly five percent got it right.
p115
aVAnd you?
p116
aVAh, you almost made it to the chimps.
p117
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p118
aVThat little, just a few of you!
p119
aVThere must be preconceived ideas, you know.
p120
aVAnd many in the rich countries,
p121
aVthey think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.
p122
aVOf course they think so,
p123
aVbecause they don't even know what has happened.
p124
aVThe first thing to think about the future
p125
aVis to know about the present.
p126
aa(lp127
VThese questions were a few of the first ones
p128
aVin the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project
p129
aVin Gapminder Foundation that we run,
p130
aVand it was started, this project, last year
p131
aVby my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter)
p132
aVHe's cofounder and director,
p133
aVand he wanted, Ola told me
p134
aVwe have to be more systematic
p135
aVwhen we fight devastating ignorance.
p136
aVSo already the pilots reveal this,
p137
aVthat so many in the public score worse than random,
p138
aVso we have to think about preconceived ideas,
p139
aVand one of the main preconceived ideas
p140
aVis about world income distribution.
p141
aa(lp142
VLook here. This is how it was in 1975.
p143
aVIt's the number of people on each income,
p144
aVfrom one dollar a day \u2014
p145
aV(Applause)
p146
aVSee, there was one hump here,
p147
aVaround one dollar a day,
p148
aVand then there was one hump here
p149
aVsomewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.
p150
aVThe world was two groups.
p151
aVIt was a camel world, like a camel with two humps,
p152
aVthe poor ones and the rich ones,
p153
aVand there were fewer in between.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut look how this has changed:
p156
aVAs I go forward, what has changed,
p157
aVthe world population has grown,
p158
aVand the humps start to merge.
p159
aVThe lower humps merged with the upper hump,
p160
aVand the camel dies and we have a dromedary world
p161
aVwith one hump only.
p162
aVThe percent in poverty has decreased.
p163
aVStill it's appalling
p164
aVthat so many remain in extreme poverty.
p165
aVWe still have this group, almost a billion, over there,
p166
aVbut that can be ended now.
p167
aa(lp168
VThe challenge we have now
p169
aVis to get away from that, understand where the majority is,
p170
aVand that is very clearly shown in this question.
p171
aVWe asked, what is the percentage of the world's
p172
aVone-year-old children who have got those
p173
aVbasic vaccines against measles and other things
p174
aVthat we have had for many years:
p175
aV20, 50 or 80 percent?
p176
aVNow, this is what the U.S. public and the Swedish answered.
p177
aVLook at the Swedish result:
p178
aVyou know what the right answer is.
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aVWho the heck is a professor of global health in that country?
p181
aVWell, it's me. It's me.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVIt's very difficult, this. It's very difficult.
p184
aV(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VHowever, Ola's approach
p187
aVto really measure what we know made headlines,
p188
aVand CNN published these results on their web
p189
aVand they had the questions there, millions answered,
p190
aVand I think there were about 2,000 comments,
p191
aVand this was one of the comments.
p192
aV"I bet no member of the media passed the test," he said.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo Ola told me, "Take these devices.
p195
aVYou are invited to media conferences.
p196
aVGive it to them and measure what the media know."
p197
aVAnd ladies and gentlemen,
p198
aVfor the first time, the informal results
p199
aVfrom a conference with U.S. media.
p200
aVAnd then, lately, from the European Union media.
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aVYou see, the problem is not that people
p203
aVdon't read and listen to the media.
p204
aVThe problem is that the media doesn't know themselves.
p205
aa(lp206
VWhat shall we do about this, Ola?
p207
aVDo we have any ideas?
p208
aV(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VOla Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first,
p211
aVI'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps.
p212
aVFortunately, I will be able to comfort you
p213
aVby showing why it was not your fault, actually.
p214
aVThen, I will equip you with some tricks
p215
aVfor beating the chimps in the future.
p216
aVThat's basically what I will do.
p217
aa(lp218
VBut first, let's look at why are we so ignorant,
p219
aVand it all starts in this place.
p220
aVIt's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.
p221
aVIt's a neighborhood where I grew up,
p222
aVand it's a neighborhood with a large problem.
p223
aVActually, it has exactly the same problem
p224
aVwhich existed in all the neighborhoods
p225
aVwhere you grew up as well.
p226
aVIt was not representative. Okay?
p227
aVIt gave me a very biased view
p228
aVof how life is on this planet.
p229
aVSo this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.
p230
aVWe have a personal bias.
p231
aa(lp232
VWe have all different experiences
p233
aVfrom communities and people we meet,
p234
aVand on top of this, we start school,
p235
aVand we add the next problem.
p236
aVWell, I like schools,
p237
aVbut teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,
p238
aVbecause they learned something when they went to school,
p239
aVand now they describe this world to the students
p240
aVwithout any bad intentions,
p241
aVand those books, of course, that are printed
p242
aVare outdated in a world that changes.
p243
aVAnd there is really no practice
p244
aVto keep the teaching material up to date.
p245
aVSo that's what we are focusing on.
p246
aVSo we have these outdated facts
p247
aVadded on top of our personal bias.
p248
aa(lp249
VWhat happens next is news, okay?
p250
aVAn excellent journalist knows how to pick
p251
aVthe story that will make headlines,
p252
aVand people will read it because it's sensational.
p253
aVUnusual events are more interesting, no?
p254
aVAnd they are exaggerated,
p255
aVand especially things we're afraid of.
p256
aVA shark attack on a Swedish person
p257
aVwill get headlines for weeks in Sweden.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo these three skewed sources of information
p260
aVwere really hard to get away from.
p261
aVThey kind of bombard us
p262
aVand equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas,
p263
aVand on top of it we put the very thing
p264
aVthat makes us humans, our human intuition.
p265
aVIt was good in evolution.
p266
aVIt helped us generalize
p267
aVand jump to conclusions very, very fast.
p268
aVIt helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of,
p269
aVand we seek causality where there is none,
p270
aVand we then get an illusion of confidence
p271
aVwhere we believe that we are the best car drivers,
p272
aVabove the average.
p273
aVEverybody answered that question,
p274
aV"Yeah, I drive cars better."
p275
aa(lp276
VOkay, this was good evolutionarily,
p277
aVbut now when it comes to the worldview,
p278
aVit is the exact reason why it's upside down.
p279
aVThe trends that are increasing are instead falling,
p280
aVand the other way around,
p281
aVand in this case, the chimps use our intuition against us,
p282
aVand it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.
p283
aVIt was supposed to be our strength, wasn't it?
p284
aa(lp285
VSo how do we solve such problems?
p286
aVFirst, we need to measure it,
p287
aVand then we need to cure it.
p288
aVSo by measuring it we can understand
p289
aVwhat is the pattern of ignorance.
p290
aVWe started the pilot last year,
p291
aVand now we're pretty sure that we will encounter
p292
aVa lot of ignorance across the whole world,
p293
aVand the idea is really to
p294
aVscale it up to all domains
p295
aVor dimensions of global development,
p296
aVsuch as climate, endangered species, human rights,
p297
aVgender equality, energy, finance.
p298
aVAll different sectors have facts,
p299
aVand there are organizations trying to spread
p300
aVawareness about these facts.
p301
aVSo I've started actually contacting some of them,
p302
aVlike WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,
p303
aVand asking them, what are your favorite facts
p304
aVwhich you think the public doesn't know?
p305
aa(lp306
VOkay, I gather those facts.
p307
aVImagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.
p308
aVAnd then we poll the public
p309
aVand see where they score worst.
p310
aVSo we get a shorter list
p311
aVwith the terrible results,
p312
aVlike some few examples from Hans,
p313
aVand we have no problem finding these kinds
p314
aVof terrible results.
p315
aVOkay, this little shortlist, what are we going to do with it?
p316
aVWell, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,
p317
aVa global knowledge certificate,
p318
aVwhich you can use, if you're a large organization,
p319
aVa school, a university, or maybe a news agency,
p320
aVto certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.
p321
aVBasically meaning, we don't hire people
p322
aVwho score like chimpanzees.
p323
aVOf course you shouldn't.
p324
aVSo maybe 10 years from now,
p325
aVif this project succeeds,
p326
aVyou will be sitting in an interview
p327
aVhaving to fill out this crazy global knowledge.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo now we come to the practical tricks.
p330
aVHow are you going to succeed?
p331
aVThere is, of course, one way,
p332
aVwhich is to sit down late nights
p333
aVand learn all the facts by heart
p334
aVby reading all these reports.
p335
aVThat will never happen, actually.
p336
aVNot even Hans thinks that's going to happen.
p337
aVPeople don't have that time.
p338
aVPeople like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.
p339
aVWe need to turn our intuition into strength again.
p340
aVWe need to be able to generalize.
p341
aVSo now I'm going to show you some tricks
p342
aVwhere the misconceptions are turned around
p343
aVinto rules of thumb.
p344
aa(lp345
VLet's start with the first misconception.
p346
aVThis is very widespread.
p347
aVEverything is getting worse.
p348
aVYou heard it. You thought it yourself.
p349
aVThe other way to think is, most things improve.
p350
aVSo you're sitting with a question in front of you
p351
aVand you're unsure. You should guess "improve."
p352
aVOkay? Don't go for the worse.
p353
aVThat will help you score better on our tests.
p354
aV(Applause)
p355
aVThat was the first one.
p356
aa(lp357
VThere are rich and poor
p358
aVand the gap is increasing.
p359
aVIt's a terrible inequality.
p360
aVYeah, it's an unequal world,
p361
aVbut when you look at the data, it's one hump.
p362
aVOkay? If you feel unsure,
p363
aVgo for "the most people are in the middle."
p364
aVThat's going to help you get the answer right.
p365
aa(lp366
VNow, the next preconceived idea is
p367
aVfirst countries and people need to be very, very rich
p368
aVto get the social development
p369
aVlike girls in school and be ready for natural disasters.
p370
aVNo, no, no. That's wrong.
p371
aVLook: that huge hump in the middle
p372
aValready have girls in school.
p373
aVSo if you are unsure, go for the
p374
aV"the majority already have this,"
p375
aVlike electricity and girls in school, these kinds of things.
p376
aVThey're only rules of thumb,
p377
aVso of course they don't apply to everything,
p378
aVbut this is how you can generalize.
p379
aa(lp380
VLet's look at the last one.
p381
aVIf something, yes, this is a good one,
p382
aVsharks are dangerous.
p383
aVNo \u2014 well, yes, but they are not so important
p384
aVin the global statistics, that is what I'm saying.
p385
aVI actually, I'm very afraid of sharks.
p386
aVSo as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of,
p387
aVwhich might be earthquakes, other religions,
p388
aVmaybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks,
p389
aVanything that makes me feel,
p390
aVassume you're going to exaggerate the problem.
p391
aVThat's a rule of thumb.
p392
aVOf course there are dangerous  things that are also great.
p393
aVSharks kill very, very few. That's how you should think.
p394
aa(lp395
VWith these four rules of thumb,
p396
aVyou could probably answer better than the chimps,
p397
aVbecause the chimps cannot do this.
p398
aVThey cannot generalize these kinds of rules.
p399
aVAnd hopefully we can turn your world around
p400
aVand we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?
p401
aV(Applause)
p402
aVThat's a systematic approach.
p403
aa(lp404
VNow the question, is this important?
p405
aVYeah, it's important to understand poverty,
p406
aVextreme poverty and how to fight it,
p407
aVand how to bring girls in school.
p408
aVWhen we realize that actually it's succeeding, we can understand it.
p409
aVBut is it important for everyone else
p410
aVwho cares about the rich end of this scale?
p411
aVI would say yes, extremely important,
p412
aVfor the same reason.
p413
aVIf you have a fact-based worldview of today,
p414
aVyou might have a chance to understand
p415
aVwhat's coming next in the future.
p416
aa(lp417
VWe're going back to these two humps in 1975.
p418
aVThat's when I was born,
p419
aVand I selected the West.
p420
aVThat's the current EU countries and North America.
p421
aVLet's now see how the rest and the West compares
p422
aVin terms of how rich you are.
p423
aVThese are the people who can afford
p424
aVto fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.
p425
aVIn 1975, only 30 percent of them lived
p426
aVoutside EU and North America.
p427
aVBut this has changed, okay?
p428
aVSo first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.
p429
aVToday it's 50/50.
p430
aVThe Western domination is over, as of today.
p431
aVThat's nice. So what's going to happen next?
p432
aVDo you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?
p433
aVI did a little experiment. I went to the IMF, International Monetary Fund, website.
p434
aVThey have a forecast for the next  five years of GDP per capita.
p435
aVSo I can use that to go five years into the future,
p436
aVassuming the income inequality  of each country is the same.
p437
aVI did that, but I went even further.
p438
aVI used those five years for the next 20 years
p439
aVwith the same speed, just as an  experiment what might actually happen.
p440
aVLet's move into the future.
p441
aVIn 2020, it's 57 percent in the rest.
p442
aVIn 2025, 63 percent.
p443
aV2030, 68. And in 2035, the West is  outnumbered in the rich consumer market.
p444
aVThese are just projections of  GDP per capita into the future.
p445
aVSeventy-three percent of the rich consumers
p446
aVare going to live outside North America and Europe.
p447
aVSo yes, I think it's a good idea for  a company to use this certificate
p448
aVto make sure to make fact- based decisions in the future.
p449
aa(lp450
VThank you very much.
p451

A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />As if all this weren&#39;t enough, the irrepressible Rosling is also an accomplished sword-swallower &mdash; a skill he demonstrated at TED2007.<br /><br /><br /> </p>", "slug": "hans_rosling", "whotheyare": "In Hans Rosling\\u2019s hands, data sings.

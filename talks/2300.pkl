VAlec Soth: So about 10 years ago, I got a call from a woman in Texas,
p5
aVStacey Baker,
p6
aVand she'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition
p7
aVand was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents.
p8
aVNow, at the time I hadn't met Stacey, and I thought this was some sort of
p9
aVwealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich,
p10
aVbut it was only later that I found out
p11
aVshe'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen.
p12
aa(lp13
VI took the picture of her parents,
p14
aVbut I was actually more excited about photographing Stacey.
p15
aVThe picture I made that day
p16
aVended up becoming one of my best-known portraits.
p17
aVAt the time I made this picture, Stacey was working as an attorney
p18
aVfor the State of Texas.
p19
aVNot long after, she left her job to study photography in Maine,
p20
aVand while she was there, she ended up meeting
p21
aVthe director of photography at the New York Times Magazine
p22
aVand was actually offered a job.
p23
aVStacey Baker: In the years since, Alec and I have done
p24
aVa number of magazine projects together,
p25
aVand we've become friends.
p26
aa(lp27
VA few months ago, I started talking to Alec about a fascination of mine.
p28
aVI've always been obsessed with how couples meet.
p29
aVI asked Alec how he and his wife Rachel met,
p30
aVand he told me the story of a high school football game
p31
aVwhere she was 16 and he was 15,
p32
aVand he asked her out.
p33
aVHe liked her purple hair.
p34
aVShe said yes, and that was it.
p35
aVI then asked Alec if he'd be interested in doing a photography project
p36
aVexploring this question.
p37
aa(lp38
VAS: And I was interested in the question, but I was actually much more interested
p39
aVin Stacey's motivation for asking it,
p40
aVparticularly since I'd never known Stacey to have a boyfriend.
p41
aVSo as part of this project, I thought it'd be interesting
p42
aVif she tried to meet someone.
p43
aVSo my idea was to have Stacey here go speed dating
p44
aVin Las Vegas on Valentine's Day.
p45
aV(Laughter) (Applause) (Music)
p46
aa(lp47
VSB: We ended up at what was advertised as the world's largest speed dating event.
p48
aVI had 19 dates
p49
aVand each date lasted three minutes.
p50
aVParticipants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling,
p51
aVthings like, "If you could be any kind of animal, what would you be?"
p52
aVThat sort of thing.
p53
aa(lp54
VMy first date was Colin.
p55
aVHe's from England,
p56
aVand he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn.
p57
aVAlec and I saw him at the end of the evening,
p58
aVand he said he'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands.
p59
aa(lp60
VZack and Chris came to the date-a-thon together.
p61
aa(lp62
VThis is Carl.
p63
aVI asked Carl, "What's the first thing you notice about a woman?"
p64
aVHe said, "Tits."
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VMatthew is attracted to women with muscular calves.
p68
aVWe talked about running. He does triathlons, I run half-marathons.
p69
aVAlec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was attracted to him, but I wasn't,
p70
aVand I don't think he was attracted to me either.
p71
aa(lp72
VAustin and Mike came together.
p73
aVMike asked me a hypothetical question.
p74
aVHe said, "You're in an elevator running late for a meeting.
p75
aVSomeone makes a dash for the elevator.
p76
aVDo you hold it open for them?"
p77
aVAnd I said I would not.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VCliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth,
p81
aVand we complimented each other's teeth.
p82
aVBecause he's an open mouth sleeper,
p83
aVhe says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease,
p84
aVand so I asked him how often he flosses,
p85
aVand he said, "Every other day."
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVNow, as someone who flosses twice a day,
p88
aVI wasn't really sure that that was flossing more
p89
aVbut I don't think I said that out loud.
p90
aa(lp91
VBill is an auditor,
p92
aVand we talked the entire three minutes about auditing. (Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VThe first thing Spencer notices about a woman is her complexion.
p95
aVHe feels a lot of women wear too much makeup,
p96
aVand that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have.
p97
aVI told him I didn't wear any makeup at all
p98
aVand he seemed to think that that was a good thing.
p99
aVCraig told me he didn't think I was willing to be vulnerable.
p100
aVHe was also frustrated when I couldn't remember my most embarrassing moment.
p101
aVHe thought I was lying, but I wasn't.
p102
aVI didn't think he liked me at all, but at the end of the night,
p103
aVhe came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates.
p104
aa(lp105
VWilliam was really difficult to talk to.
p106
aVI think he was drunk.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VActor Chris McKenna was the MC of the event.
p110
aVHe used to be on "The Young and the Restless."
p111
aVI didn't actually go on a date with him.
p112
aVAlec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him.
p113
aa(lp114
VNeedless to say, I didn't fall in love.
p115
aVI didn't feel a particular connection with any of the men that I went on dates with,
p116
aVand I didn't feel like they felt a particular connection with me either.
p117
aa(lp118
VAS: Now, the most beautiful thing to me \u2014
p119
aV(Laughter) \u2014 as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability.
p120
aVThe physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse
p121
aVat a more fragile interior.
p122
aVAt this date-a-thon event, I saw so many examples of that,
p123
aVbut as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about them,
p124
aVI realized how different photographic love is from real love.
p125
aa(lp126
VWhat is real love? How does it work?
p127
aVIn order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes
p128
aVfrom meeting on a date to having a life together,
p129
aVStacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin,
p130
aVwhich is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas.
p131
aVOur contact there was George, who runs the community's photography club.
p132
aVHe arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio.
p133
aVSB: After 45 years of marriage, Anastasia's husband died two years ago,
p134
aa(lp135
Vso we asked if she had an old wedding picture.
p136
aVShe met her husband when she was a 15-year-old waitress
p137
aVat a small barbecue place in Michigan.
p138
aVHe was 30.
p139
aVShe'd lied about her age.
p140
aVHe was the first person she'd dated.
p141
aa(lp142
VDean had been named photographer of the year in Las Vegas two years in a row,
p143
aVand this caught Alec's attention,
p144
aVas did the fact  that he met his wife, Judy,
p145
aVat the same age when Alec met Rachel.
p146
aVDean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women,
p147
aVbut he's never questioned his decision to marry Judy.
p148
aa(lp149
VAS: George met Josephine at a parish dance.
p150
aVHe was 18, she was 15.
p151
aVLike a lot of the couples we met, they weren't especially philosophical
p152
aVabout their early choices.
p153
aVGeorge said something that really stuck with me.
p154
aVHe said, "When you get that feeling, you just go with it."
p155
aa(lp156
VBob and Trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school.
p157
aVThey said they weren't particularly attracted to each other
p158
aVwhen the first met.
p159
aVNevertheless, they were married soon after.
p160
aa(lp161
VSB: The story that stayed with me the most
p162
aVwas that of George, the photography club president, and his wife, Mary.
p163
aVThis was George and Mary's second marriage.
p164
aVThey met at a country-western club in Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara.
p165
aVHe was there alone drinking and she was with friends.
p166
aVWhen they started dating, he owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes,
p167
aVand she offered to help him get out of debt,
p168
aVso for the next year, he turned his paychecks over to Mary,
p169
aVand she got him out of debt.
p170
aVGeorge was actually an alcoholic when they married, and Mary knew it.
p171
aVAt some point in their marriage, he says he consumed
p172
aV54 beers in one day.
p173
aVAnother time, when he was drunk, he threatened to kill Mary
p174
aVand her two kids,
p175
aVbut they escaped and a SWAT team was called to the house.
p176
aVAmazingly, Mary took him back,
p177
aVand eventually things got better.
p178
aVGeorge has been involved in Alcoholics Anonymous
p179
aVand hasn't had a drink in 36 years.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Music)
p182
aa(lp183
VAt the end of the day, after we left Sun City,
p184
aVI told Alec that I didn't actually think
p185
aVthat the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting.
p186
aVWhat was more interesting
p187
aVwas how they managed to stay together.
p188
aa(lp189
VAS: They all had this beautiful quality of endurance,
p190
aVbut that was true of the singles, too.
p191
aVThe world is hard, and the singles were out there
p192
aVtrying to connect with other people,
p193
aVand the couples were holding onto each other
p194
aVafter all these decades.
p195
aa(lp196
VMy favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne.
p197
aVNow, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne,
p198
aVwe'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph.
p199
aVIn their case, they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets
p200
aVthe exact same photograph.
p201
aVWhat's more beautiful, I thought to myself,
p202
aVthis image of a young couple who has just fallen in love
p203
aVor the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades?
p204
aa(lp205
VThank you.

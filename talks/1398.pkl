VI'm here to give you
p5
aVyour recommended dietary allowance
p6
aVof poetry.
p7
aVAnd the way I'm going to do that
p8
aVis present to you
p9
aVfive animations
p10
aVof five of my poems.
p11
aVAnd let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about.
p12
aVBecause the mixing of those two media
p13
aVis a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut when I was United States Poet Laureate \u2014
p16
aVand I love saying that.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVIt's a great way to start sentences.
p19
aVWhen I was him back then,
p20
aVI was approached by J. Walter Thompson, the ad company,
p21
aVand they were hired
p22
aVsort of by the Sundance Channel.
p23
aVAnd the idea was to have me record some of my poems
p24
aVand then they would find animators
p25
aVto animate them.
p26
aVAnd I was initially resistant,
p27
aVbecause I always think
p28
aVpoetry can stand alone by itself.
p29
aVAttempts to put my poems to music
p30
aVhave had disastrous results,
p31
aVin all cases.
p32
aVAnd the poem, if it's written with the ear,
p33
aValready has been set to its own verbal music
p34
aVas it was composed.
p35
aVAnd surely, if you're reading a poem
p36
aVthat mentions a cow,
p37
aVyou don't need on the facing page
p38
aVa drawing of a cow.
p39
aVI mean, let's let the reader do a little work.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut I relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility,
p42
aVand also I'm like a total cartoon junkie
p43
aVsince childhood.
p44
aVI think more influential
p45
aVthan Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth
p46
aVon my imagination
p47
aVwere Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodies
p48
aVand Loony Tunes cartoons.
p49
aVBugs Bunny is my muse.
p50
aVAnd this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places.
p51
aVAnd I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places \u2014
p52
aVpoetry on buses, poetry on subways,
p53
aVon billboards, on cereal boxes.
p54
aVWhen I was Poet Laureate, there I go again \u2014
p55
aVI can't help it, it's true \u2014
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVI created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines
p58
aVthat lasted for a couple of years.
p59
aVSo you could tune into poetry as you were flying.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd my sense is,
p62
aVit's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves
p63
aVand more into public life.
p64
aVStart a meeting with a poem. That would be an idea you might take with you.
p65
aVWhen you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio
p66
aVor on a cereal box or whatever,
p67
aVit happens to you so suddenly
p68
aVthat you don't have time
p69
aVto deploy your anti-poetry deflector shields
p70
aVthat were installed in high school.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo let us start with the first one.
p73
aVIt's a little poem called "Budapest,"
p74
aVand in it I reveal,
p75
aVor pretend to reveal,
p76
aVthe secrets of the creative process.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Video) Narration: "Budapest."
p79
aVMy pen moves along the page
p80
aVlike the snout of a strange animal
p81
aVshaped like a human arm
p82
aVand dressed in the sleeve
p83
aVof a loose green sweater.
p84
aVI watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly,
p85
aVintent as any forager
p86
aVthat has nothing on its mind
p87
aVbut the grubs and insects
p88
aVthat will allow it to live another day.
p89
aVIt wants only to be here tomorrow,
p90
aVdressed perhaps
p91
aVin the sleeve of a plaid shirt,
p92
aVnose pressed against the page,
p93
aVwriting a few more dutiful lines
p94
aVwhile I gaze out the window
p95
aVand imagine Budapest
p96
aVor some other city
p97
aVwhere I have never been.
p98
aa(lp99
VBC: So that makes it seem a little easier.
p100
aV(Applause)
p101
aVWriting is not actually as easy as that for me.
p102
aVBut I like to pretend that it comes with ease.
p103
aVOne of my students came up after class, an introductory class,
p104
aVand she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing,"
p105
aVwhich I found both erroneous and profound.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVSo I like to at least pretend it just flows out.
p108
aVA friend of mine has a slogan; he's another poet.
p109
aVHe says that, "If at first you don't succeed,
p110
aVhide all evidence you ever tried."
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VThe next poem is also rather short.
p115
aVPoetry just says a few things in different ways.
p116
aVAnd I think you could boil this poem down to saying,
p117
aV"Some days you eat the bear, other days the bear eats you."
p118
aVAnd it uses the imagery
p119
aVof dollhouse furniture.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Video) Narration: "Some Days."
p122
aVSome days
p123
aVI put the people in their places at the table,
p124
aVbend their legs at the knees,
p125
aVif they come with that feature,
p126
aVand fix them into the tiny wooden chairs.
p127
aVAll afternoon they face one another,
p128
aVthe man in the brown suit,
p129
aVthe woman in the blue dress \u2014
p130
aVperfectly motionless, perfectly behaved.
p131
aVBut other days I am the one
p132
aVwho is lifted up by the ribs
p133
aVthen lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse
p134
aVto sit with the others at the long table.
p135
aVVery funny.
p136
aVBut how would you like it
p137
aVif you never knew from one day to the next
p138
aVif you were going to spend it
p139
aVstriding around like a vivid god,
p140
aVyour shoulders in the clouds,
p141
aVor sitting down there
p142
aVamidst the wallpaper
p143
aVstaring straight ahead
p144
aVwith your little plastic face?
p145
aa(lp146
V(Applause)
p147
aa(lp148
VBC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.
p149
aVThe next poem is called forgetfulness,
p150
aVand it's really just a kind of poetic essay
p151
aVon the subject of mental slippage.
p152
aVAnd the poem begins
p153
aVwith a certain species of forgetfulness
p154
aVthat someone called
p155
aVliterary amnesia,
p156
aVin other words, forgetting the things that you have read.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Video) Narration: "Forgetfulness."
p159
aVThe name of the author is the first to go,
p160
aVfollowed obediently
p161
aVby the title, the plot,
p162
aVthe heartbreaking conclusion,
p163
aVthe entire novel,
p164
aVwhich suddenly becomes one you have never read,
p165
aVnever even heard of.
p166
aVIt is as if, one by one,
p167
aVthe memories you used to harbor
p168
aVdecided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain
p169
aVto a little fishing village
p170
aVwhere there are no phones.
p171
aVLong ago,
p172
aVyou kissed the names of the nine muses good-bye
p173
aVand you watched the quadratic equation
p174
aVpack its bag.
p175
aVAnd even now,
p176
aVas you memorize the order of the planets,
p177
aVsomething else is slipping away,
p178
aVa state flower perhaps,
p179
aVthe address of an uncle,
p180
aVthe capital of Paraguay.
p181
aVWhatever it is
p182
aVyou are struggling to remember,
p183
aVit is not poised on the tip of your tongue,
p184
aVnot even lurking
p185
aVin some obscure corner
p186
aVof your spleen.
p187
aVIt has floated away
p188
aVdown a dark mythological river
p189
aVwhose name begins with an L
p190
aVas far as you can recall,
p191
aVwell on your own way to oblivion
p192
aVwhere you will join those
p193
aVwho have forgotten even how to swim
p194
aVand how to ride a bicycle.
p195
aVNo wonder you rise in the middle of the night
p196
aVto look up the date of a famous battle
p197
aVin a book on war.
p198
aVNo wonder the Moon in the window
p199
aVseems to have drifted out of a love poem
p200
aVthat you used to know by heart.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VBC: The next poem is called "The Country"
p205
aVand it's based on,
p206
aVwhen I was in college
p207
aVI met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine.
p208
aVHe lived, and still does, in rural Vermont.
p209
aVI lived in New York City.
p210
aVAnd we would visit each other.
p211
aVAnd when I would go up to the country,
p212
aVhe would teach me things like deer hunting,
p213
aVwhich meant getting lost with a gun basically \u2014
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aVand trout fishing and stuff like that.
p216
aVAnd then he'd come down to New York City
p217
aVand I'd teach him what I knew,
p218
aVwhich was largely smoking and drinking.
p219
aV(Laughter)
p220
aVAnd in that way we traded lore with each other.
p221
aVThe poem that's coming up
p222
aVis based on him trying to tell me a little something
p223
aVabout a domestic point of etiquette
p224
aVin country living
p225
aVthat I had a very hard time, at first, processing.
p226
aVIt's called "The Country."
p227
aa(lp228
V(Video) Narration: "The Country."
p229
aVI wondered about you
p230
aVwhen you told me never to leave
p231
aVa box of wooden strike-anywhere matches
p232
aVjust lying around the house,
p233
aVbecause the mice might get into them
p234
aVand start a fire.
p235
aVBut your face was absolutely straight
p236
aVwhen you twisted the lid down
p237
aVon the round tin
p238
aVwhere the matches, you said, are always stowed.
p239
aVWho could sleep that night?
p240
aVWho could whisk away the thought
p241
aVof the one unlikely mouse
p242
aVpadding along a cold water pipe
p243
aVbehind the floral wallpaper,
p244
aVgripping a single wooden match
p245
aVbetween the needles of his teeth?
p246
aVWho could not see him rounding a corner,
p247
aVthe blue tip scratching against rough-hewn beam,
p248
aVthe sudden flare
p249
aVand the creature, for one bright, shining moment,
p250
aVsuddenly thrust ahead of his time \u2014
p251
aVnow a fire-starter,
p252
aVnow a torch-bearer
p253
aVin a forgotten ritual,
p254
aVlittle brown druid
p255
aVilluminating some ancient night?
p256
aVAnd who could fail to notice,
p257
aVlit up in the blazing insulation,
p258
aVthe tiny looks of wonderment
p259
aVon the faces of his fellow mice \u2014
p260
aVone-time inhabitants
p261
aVof what once was your house in the country?
p262
aa(lp263
V(Applause)
p264
aa(lp265
VBC: Thank you.
p266
aV(Applause)
p267
aVThank you. And the last poem is called "The Dead."
p268
aVI wrote this after a friend's funeral,
p269
aVbut not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying,
p270
aVas all eulogists tend to do,
p271
aVwhich is how happy the deceased would be
p272
aVto look down and see all of us assembled.
p273
aVAnd that to me was a bad start to the afterlife,
p274
aVhaving to witness your own funeral and feel gratified.
p275
aVSo the little poem is called "The Dead."
p276
aa(lp277
V(Video) Narration: "The Dead."
p278
aVThe dead are always looking down on us,
p279
aVthey say.
p280
aVWhile we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich,
p281
aVthey are looking down
p282
aVthrough the glass-bottom boats of heaven
p283
aVas they row themselves slowly
p284
aVthrough eternity.
p285
aVThey watch the tops of our heads
p286
aVmoving below on Earth.
p287
aVAnd when we lie down
p288
aVin a field or on a couch,
p289
aVdrugged perhaps
p290
aVby the hum of a warm afternoon,
p291
aVthey think we are looking back at them,
p292
aVwhich makes them lift their oars
p293
aVand fall silent
p294
aVand wait like parents
p295
aVfor us to close our eyes.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Applause)
p298
aa(lp299
VBC: I'm not sure if other poems will be animated.
p300
aVIt took a long time \u2014
p301
aVI mean, it's rather uncommon to have this marriage \u2014
p302
aVa long time to put those two together.
p303
aVBut then again, it took us a long time
p304
aVto put the wheel and the suitcase together.
p305
aV(Laughter)
p306
aVI mean, we had the wheel for some time.
p307
aVAnd schlepping is an ancient and honorable art.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VI just have time
p312
aVto read a more recent poem to you.
p313
aVIf it has a subject,
p314
aVthe subject is adolescence.
p315
aVAnd it's addressed to a certain person.
p316
aVIt's called "To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl."
p317
aa(lp318
V"Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon
p319
aVon the day you were born,
p320
aVyou would be all done in only one more year?
p321
aVOf course, you couldn't have done that all alone.
p322
aVSo never mind;
p323
aVyou're fine just being yourself.
p324
aVYou're loved for just being you.
p325
aVBut did you know that at your age
p326
aVJudy Garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture,
p327
aVJoan of Arc was leading the French army to victory
p328
aVand Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room \u2014
p329
aVno wait, I mean he had invented the calculator?
p330
aVOf course, there will be time for all that
p331
aVlater in your life,
p332
aVafter you come out of your room
p333
aVand begin to blossom,
p334
aVor at least pick up all your socks.
p335
aVFor some reason I keep remembering
p336
aVthat Lady Jane Grey was queen of England
p337
aVwhen she was only 15.
p338
aVBut then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model.
p339
aV(Laughter)
p340
aVA few centuries later,
p341
aVwhen he was your age,
p342
aVFranz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family,
p343
aVbut that did not keep him
p344
aVfrom composing two symphonies, four operas
p345
aVand two complete masses as a youngster.
p346
aV(Laughter)
p347
aVBut of course, that was in Austria
p348
aVat the height of Romantic lyricism,
p349
aVnot here in the suburbs of Cleveland.
p350
aV(Laughter)
p351
aVFrankly, who cares
p352
aVif Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15
p353
aVor if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17?
p354
aVWe think you're special just being you \u2014
p355
aVplaying with your food and staring into space.
p356
aV(Laughter)
p357
aVBy the way,
p358
aVI lied about Schubert doing the dishes,
p359
aVbut that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house."
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)
p364
aa(lp365
VThank you. Thank you.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Applause)
p368
aa(lp369
VThanks.

VEveryone's familiar with cancer,
p5
aVbut we don't normally think of cancer
p6
aVas being a contagious disease.
p7
aVThe Tasmanian devil has shown us
p8
aVthat, not only can cancer be a contagious disease,
p9
aVbut it can also threaten
p10
aVan entire species with extinction.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?
p13
aVMany of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character,
p14
aVthe one that spins around and around and around.
p15
aVBut not many people know
p16
aVthat there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil,
p17
aVand it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.
p18
aVA marsupial is a mammal with a pouch
p19
aVlike a kangaroo.
p20
aVThe Tasmanian devil got its name
p21
aVfrom the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Screaming)
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VThe Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger,
p28
aVand it uses its powerful jaws
p29
aVand its sharp teeth
p30
aVto chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.
p31
aV[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania,
p32
aVwhich is that small island
p33
aVjust to the south of the mainland of Australia.
p34
aVAnd despite their ferocious appearance,
p35
aVTasmanian devils are actually
p36
aVquite adorable little animals.
p37
aVIn fact, growing up in Tasmania,
p38
aVit always was incredibly exciting
p39
aVwhen we got a chance to see
p40
aVa Tasmanian devil in the wild.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut the Tasmanian devil population
p43
aVhas been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.
p44
aVAnd in fact, there's concern
p45
aVthat the species could go extinct in the wild
p46
aVwithin 20 to 30 years.
p47
aVAnd the reason for that
p48
aVis the emergence of a new disease,
p49
aVa contagious cancer.
p50
aa(lp51
VThe story begins in 1996
p52
aVwhen a wildlife photographer took this photograph here
p53
aVof a Tasmanian devil
p54
aVwith a large tumor on its face.
p55
aVAt the time, this was thought to be a one-off.
p56
aVAnimals, just like humans,
p57
aVsometimes get strange tumors.
p58
aVHowever, we now believe
p59
aVthat this is the first sighting of a new disease,
p60
aVwhich is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania.
p61
aVThe disease was first sighted
p62
aVin the northeast of Tasmania in 1996
p63
aVand has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.
p64
aVNow there's only a small part of the population,
p65
aVwhich remains unaffected.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis disease appears first as tumors,
p68
aVusually on the face or inside the mouth
p69
aVof affected Tasmanian devils.
p70
aVThese tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors,
p71
aVsuch as these ones here.
p72
aVAnd the next image I'm going to show
p73
aVis quite gruesome.
p74
aVBut inevitably, these tumors progress
p75
aVtowards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here.
p76
aa(lp77
VThis one in particular sticks in my mind,
p78
aVbecause this is the first case of this disease
p79
aVthat I saw myself.
p80
aVAnd I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil
p81
aVwith this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumor
p82
aVinside her mouth
p83
aVthat had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw.
p84
aVShe hadn't eaten for days.
p85
aVHer guts were swimming with parasitic worms.
p86
aVHer body was riddled with secondary tumors.
p87
aVAnd yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils
p88
aVin her pouch.
p89
aVOf course, they died along with the mother.
p90
aVThey were too young to survive without their mother.
p91
aVIn fact, in the area where she comes from,
p92
aVmore than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population
p93
aVhas already died of this disease.
p94
aa(lp95
VScientists around the world
p96
aVwere intrigued by this cancer,
p97
aVthis infectious cancer,
p98
aVthat was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population.
p99
aVAnd our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women,
p100
aVwhich is spread by a virus,
p101
aVand to the AIDS epidemic,
p102
aVwhich is associated with a number of different types of cancer.
p103
aVAll the evidence suggested that this devil cancer
p104
aVwas spread by a virus.
p105
aVHowever, we now know \u2014 and I'll tell you right now \u2014
p106
aVthat we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus.
p107
aVIn fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer
p108
aVis something altogether more sinister,
p109
aVand something that we hadn't really thought of before.
p110
aVBut in order for me to explain what that is,
p111
aVI need to spend just a couple of minutes
p112
aVtalking more about cancer itself.
p113
aa(lp114
VCancer is a disease
p115
aVthat affects millions of people around the world every year.
p116
aVOne in three people in this room
p117
aVwill develop cancer at some stage in their lives.
p118
aVI myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine
p119
aVwhen I was only 14.
p120
aVCancer occurs
p121
aVwhen a single cell in your body
p122
aVacquires a set of random mutations in important genes
p123
aVthat cause that cell to start to produce
p124
aVmore and more and more copies of itself.
p125
aVParadoxically, once established,
p126
aVnatural selection actually favors
p127
aVthe continued growth of cancer.
p128
aVNatural selection is survival of the fittest.
p129
aVAnd when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells,
p130
aVif one of them acquires new mutations,
p131
aVwhich allow them to grow more quickly,
p132
aVacquire nutrients more successfully,
p133
aVinvade the body,
p134
aVthey'll be selected for by evolution.
p135
aa(lp136
VThat's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.
p137
aVIt evolves.
p138
aVThrow a drug at it,
p139
aVand resistant cells will grow back.
p140
aVAn amazing fact is that,
p141
aVgiven the right environment and the right nutrients,
p142
aVa cancer cell has the potential
p143
aVto go on growing forever.
p144
aVHowever cancer is constrained
p145
aVby living inside our bodies,
p146
aVand its continued growth,
p147
aVits spreading through our bodies
p148
aVand eating away at our tissues,
p149
aVleads to the death of the cancer patient
p150
aVand also to the death of the cancer itself.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo cancer could be thought of
p153
aVas a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form \u2014
p154
aVan evolutionary dead end.
p155
aVBut that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer
p156
aVhas acquired an absolutely amazing
p157
aVevolutionary adaptation.
p158
aVAnd the answer came from studying
p159
aVthe Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA.
p160
aVThis was work from many people,
p161
aVbut I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment
p162
aVthat I did a few years ago.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe next slide is going to be gruesome.
p165
aVThis is Jonas.
p166
aVHe's a Tasmanian devil that we found
p167
aVwith a large tumor on his face.
p168
aVAnd being a geneticist,
p169
aVI'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations.
p170
aVSo I took this opportunity
p171
aVto collect some samples from Jonas' tumor
p172
aVand also some samples from other parts of his body.
p173
aVI took these back to the lab.
p174
aVI extracted DNA from them.
p175
aVAnd when I looked at the sequence of the DNA,
p176
aVand compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor
p177
aVto that of the rest of his body,
p178
aVI discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile.
p179
aVIn fact, Jonas and his tumor
p180
aVwere as different from each other
p181
aVas you and the person sitting next to you.
p182
aVWhat this told us was that Jonas' tumor
p183
aVdid not arise from cells of his own body.
p184
aVIn fact, more genetic profiling
p185
aVtold us that this tumor in Jonas
p186
aVactually probably first arose
p187
aVfrom the cells of a female Tasmanian devil \u2014
p188
aVand Jonas was clearly a male.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo how come
p191
aVa tumor that arose from the cells of another individual
p192
aVis growing on Jonas' face?
p193
aVWell the next breakthrough
p194
aVcame from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers
p195
aVfrom all around Tasmania.
p196
aVWe found that all of these cancers
p197
aVshared the same DNA.
p198
aVThink about that for a minute.
p199
aVThat means that all of these cancers
p200
aVactually are the same cancer
p201
aVthat arose once from one individual devil,
p202
aVthat have broken free of that first devil's body
p203
aVand spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population.
p204
aa(lp205
VBut how can a cancer spread in a population?
p206
aVWell the final piece of the puzzle came
p207
aVwhen we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.
p208
aVThey tend to bite each other,
p209
aVoften quite ferociously and usually on the face.
p210
aVWe think that cancer cells
p211
aVactually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.
p212
aVWhen the devil bites another devil,
p213
aVit actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil,
p214
aVso the tumor continues to grow.
p215
aVSo this Tasmanian devil cancer
p216
aVis perhaps the ultimate cancer.
p217
aVIt's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.
p218
aVIt spreads through the population,
p219
aVhas mutations that allow it to evade the immune system,
p220
aVand it's the only cancer that we know of
p221
aVthat's threatening an entire species with extinction.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut if this can happen in Tasmanian devils,
p224
aVwhy hasn't it happened in other animals
p225
aVor even humans?
p226
aVWell the answer is, it has.
p227
aVThis is Kimbo.
p228
aVHe's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.
p229
aVLast year, his owner noticed some blood
p230
aVtrickling from his genital region.
p231
aVShe took him to the vet
p232
aVand the vet discovered something quite disgusting.
p233
aVAnd if you're squeamish, please look away now.
p234
aVHe discovered this,
p235
aVa huge bleeding tumor
p236
aVat the base of Kimbo's penis.
p237
aVThe vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor,
p238
aVa sexually transmitted cancer
p239
aVthat affects dogs.
p240
aVAnd just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious
p241
aVthrough the spread of living cancer cells,
p242
aVso is this dog cancer.
p243
aa(lp244
VBut this dog cancer is quite remarkable,
p245
aVbecause it spread all around the world.
p246
aVAnd in fact, these same cells
p247
aVthat are affecting Kimbo here
p248
aVare also found affecting dogs
p249
aVin New York City,
p250
aVin mountain villages in the Himalayas
p251
aVand in Outback Australia.
p252
aVWe also believe this cancer might be very old.
p253
aVIn fact, genetic profiling tells
p254
aVthat it may be tens of thousands of years old,
p255
aVwhich means that this cancer
p256
aVmay have first arisen
p257
aVfrom the cells of a wolf
p258
aVthat lived alongside the Neanderthals.
p259
aVThis cancer is remarkable.
p260
aVIt's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.
p261
aVIt's a living relic
p262
aVof the distant past.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo we've seen that this can happen in animals.
p265
aVCould cancers be contagious between people?
p266
aVWell this is a question
p267
aVwhich fascinated Chester Southam,
p268
aVa cancer doctor in the 1950s.
p269
aVAd he decided to put this to the test
p270
aVby actually deliberately inoculating people
p271
aVwith cancer from somebody else.
p272
aVAnd this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957
p273
aVinjecting cancer into a volunteer,
p274
aVwho in this case was an inmate
p275
aVin Ohio State Penitentiary.
p276
aVMost of the people that Dr. Southam injected
p277
aVdid not go on to develop cancer
p278
aVfrom the injected cells.
p279
aVBut a small number of them did,
p280
aVand they were mostly people who were otherwise ill \u2014
p281
aVwhose immune systems were probably compromised.
p282
aa(lp283
VWhat this tells us,
p284
aVethical issues aside,
p285
aVis that ...
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVit's probably extremely rare
p288
aVfor cancers to be transferred between people.
p289
aVHowever, under some circumstances,
p290
aVit can happen.
p291
aVAnd I think that this is something
p292
aVthat oncologists and epidemiologists
p293
aVshould be aware of in the future.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo just finally,
p296
aVcancer is an inevitable outcome
p297
aVof the ability of our cells
p298
aVto divide
p299
aVand to adapt to their environments.
p300
aVBut that does not mean that we should give up hope
p301
aVin the fight against cancer.
p302
aVIn fact, I believe, given more knowledge
p303
aVof the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth,
p304
aVwe can defeat cancer.
p305
aVMy personal aim
p306
aVis to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer.
p307
aVLet's prevent the Tasmanian devil
p308
aVfrom being the first animal
p309
aVto go extinct from cancer.
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you.

In the mid-&#39;90s, the devils were beset with a terrible new disease -- a contagious facial cancer, spread by biting, that killed the animals just as they reached breeding age. By 2008, half the devil population of Australia had contracted the cancer and died. And as Murchison says: &quot;I didn&rsquo;t want to sit back and let the devils disappear.&rdquo; </p><p>Leading an international team at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, she worked to understand why this cancer was so virulent -- with the goal of saving the Taz, as it is called, but also of understanding how a contagious cancer works. Analyzing gene and microRNA activity in 25 different facial tumors and in healthy tissue, the team found that cancers from animals across Tasmania were identical, and that the cancer stems from Schwann cells, which normally insulate nerve fibers. <br /><br />Now a Research Fellow in Medical Sciences at King&#39;s College, Cambridge, Murchison is using high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies to investigate the genetics and evolution of this disease, one of only three known cancers that spread contagiously.</p><p>She says: &quot;This is why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat: It evolves.&quot;</p>", "slug": "elizabeth_murchison", "whotheyare": "Elizabeth Murchison studies a mysterious (and contagious) cancer that threatens to wipe out Tasmanian devils.", "whatotherssay": "The devils will eventually need a vaccine, and there is hope that this research may help scientists develop one.", "id": 1037, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/6fd0381e5dd1ad3661a6ddfec823a12e4f741db1_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Fighting a contagious cancer", "take_action": null, "comments": 7001, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/5d63c106befe8b4c09b275c680cb8721e8569438_800x600.jpg", "description": "What is killing the Tasmanian devil?

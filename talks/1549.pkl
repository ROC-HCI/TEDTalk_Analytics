VI've got a great idea that's going to change the world.
p5
aVIt's fantastic, it's going to blow your mind.
p6
aVIt's my beautiful baby.
p7
aVHere's the thing: everybody loves a beautiful baby.
p8
aVI mean, I was a beautiful baby.
p9
aVHere's me and my dad a couple days after I was born.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo in the world of product design,
p12
aVthe beautiful baby's like the concept car.
p13
aVIt's the knockout.
p14
aVYou see it and you go, "Oh, my God. I'd buy that in a second!"
p15
aVSo why is it that this year's new cars
p16
aVlook pretty much exactly like last year's new cars?
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VWhat went wrong between the design studio and the factory?
p21
aVToday, I don't want to talk about beautiful babies,
p22
aVI want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design \u2014
p23
aVthose sort of dorky teenage years
p24
aVwhere you're trying to figure out how the world works.
p25
aa(lp26
VI'm going to start with an example
p27
aVfrom some work that we did on newborn health.
p28
aVSo here's a problem:
p29
aVfour million babies around the world, mostly in developing countries,
p30
aVdie every year before their first birthday,
p31
aVeven before their first month of life.
p32
aVIt turns out half of those kids,
p33
aVor about 1.8 million newborns around the world,
p34
aVwould make it if you could just keep them warm
p35
aVfor the first three days, maybe the first week.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo this is a newborn intensive care unit in Kathmandu, Nepal.
p38
aVAll of these kids in blankets belong in incubators \u2014
p39
aVsomething like this.
p40
aVThis is a donated Japanese Atom incubator
p41
aVthat we found in a NICU in Kathmandu.
p42
aVThis is what we want.
p43
aVProbably what happened is a hospital in Japan upgraded their equipment
p44
aVand donated their old stuff to Nepal.
p45
aVThe problem is, without technicians, without spare parts,
p46
aVdonations like this very quickly turn into junk.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo this seemed like a problem that we could do something about.
p49
aVKeeping a baby warm for a week \u2014 that's not rocket science.
p50
aVSo we got started.
p51
aVWe partnered with a leading medical research institution here in Boston.
p52
aVWe conducted months of user research overseas,
p53
aVtrying to think like designers, human-centered design \u2014
p54
aV"Let's figure out what people want."
p55
aVWe killed thousands of Post-it notes.
p56
aVWe made dozens of prototypes to get to this.
p57
aVSo this is the NeoNurture infant incubator,
p58
aVand this has a lot of smarts built into it, and we felt great.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo the idea here is, unlike the concept car,
p61
aVwe want to marry something beautiful
p62
aVwith something that actually works.
p63
aVAnd our idea is that this design
p64
aVwould inspire manufacturers and other people of influence
p65
aVto take this model and run with it.
p66
aa(lp67
VHere's the bad news:
p68
aVthe only baby ever actually put inside the NeoNurture incubator
p69
aVwas this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot.
p70
aVSo recognition is fantastic.
p71
aVWe want design to get out for people to see it.
p72
aVIt won lots of awards.
p73
aVBut it felt like a booby prize.
p74
aVWe wanted to make beautiful things
p75
aVthat are going to make the world a better place,
p76
aVand I don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo it turns out that design  for inspiration doesn't really ...
p79
aVI guess what I would say is, for us, for what I want to do,
p80
aVit's either too slow or it just doesn't work, it's ineffective.
p81
aVSo, really, I want to design for outcomes.
p82
aVI don't want to make beautiful stuff; I want to make the world a better place.
p83
aVSo when we were designing NeoNurture,
p84
aVwe paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing,
p85
aVfor example, poor families, rural doctors,
p86
aVoverloaded nurses, even repair technicians.
p87
aVWe thought we had all our bases covered, we'd done everything right.
p88
aa(lp89
VWell, it turns out there's this whole constellation of people
p90
aVwho have to be involved in a product for it to be successful:
p91
aVmanufacturing, financing, distribution, regulation.
p92
aVMichael Free at PATH says you have to figure out
p93
aVwho will "choose, use and pay the dues"
p94
aVfor a product like this.
p95
aVAnd I have to ask the question that VCs always ask:
p96
aV"Sir, what is your business, and who is your customer?"
p97
aa(lp98
VWho is our customer?
p99
aVWell, here's an example.
p100
aVThis is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility.
p101
aVIt turns out he doesn't buy any of his equipment.
p102
aVThose decisions are made by the Ministry of Health
p103
aVor by foreign donors,
p104
aVand it just kind of shows up.
p105
aVSimilarly, here's a multinational medical-device manufacturer.
p106
aVIt turns out they've got to fish where the fish are.
p107
aVSo it turns out that in emerging markets \u2014 where the fish are \u2014
p108
aVare the emerging middle class of these countries \u2014
p109
aVdiseases of affluence: heart disease, infertility.
p110
aVSo it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect
p111
aVreally means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution.
p112
aVOK, that was an important lesson.
p113
aa(lp114
VSecond, we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project.
p115
aVSo we started by finding a manufacturer,
p116
aVan organization called MTTS in Vietnam,
p117
aVthat manufactures newborn-care technologies for Southeast Asia.
p118
aVOur other partner is East Meets West,
p119
aVan American foundation that distributes that technology
p120
aVto poor hospitals around that region.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo we started with them, saying, "Well, what do you want?
p123
aVWhat's a problem you want to solve?"
p124
aVAnd they said, "Let's work on newborn jaundice."
p125
aVSo this is another one of these mind-boggling global problems.
p126
aVJaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world.
p127
aVOf those newborns, one in 10 roughly,
p128
aVif it's not treated, the jaundice gets so severe
p129
aVthat it leads to either a life-long disability,
p130
aVor the kids could even die.
p131
aVThere's one way to treat jaundice,
p132
aVand that's what's called an exchange transfusion.
p133
aVSo as you can imagine, that's expensive and a little bit dangerous.
p134
aa(lp135
VThere is another cure.
p136
aVIt's very technological, it's very complex, a little daunting.
p137
aVYou've got to shine blue light on the kid.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VBright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover.
p142
aVHow is this a hard problem?
p143
aVI went to MIT. OK, we'll figure that out.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VSo here's an example.
p148
aVThis is an overhead phototherapy device that's designed for American hospitals,
p149
aVand here's how it's supposed to be used.
p150
aVIt's over the baby, illuminating a single patient.
p151
aVTake it out of an American hospital,
p152
aVsend it overseas to a crowded facility in Asia,
p153
aVhere's how it's actually used.
p154
aVThe effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity.
p155
aVThese dark blue squares show you where it's effective phototherapy.
p156
aVHere's what it looks like under actual use.
p157
aVSo those kids on the edges aren't actually receiving effective phototherapy.
p158
aVBut without training, without some kind of light meter,
p159
aVhow would you know?
p160
aa(lp161
VWe see other examples of problems like this.
p162
aVHere's a neonatal intensive care unit,
p163
aVwhere moms come in to visit their babies.
p164
aVAnd keep in mind that Mom maybe just had a C-section,
p165
aVso that's already kind of a bummer.
p166
aVMom's visiting her kid.
p167
aVShe sees her baby naked, lying under some blue lights,
p168
aVlooking kind of vulnerable.
p169
aVIt's not uncommon for Mom to put a blanket over the baby.
p170
aVFrom a phototherapy standpoint, maybe not the best behavior.
p171
aVIn fact, that sounds kind of dumb.
p172
aVExcept, what we've learned is that there's no such thing as a dumb user \u2014
p173
aVthere are only dumb products.
p174
aa(lp175
VWe have to think like existentialists:
p176
aVit's not the painting we would have painted,
p177
aVit's the painting that we actually painted.
p178
aVIt's the use \u2014 designed for actual use.
p179
aVHow are people actually going to use this?
p180
aa(lp181
VSo, similarly, when we think about our partner MTTS,
p182
aVthey've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses.
p183
aVSo here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP.
p184
aVThey're inexpensive, really rugged.
p185
aVThey've treated 50,000 kids in Vietnam with this technology.
p186
aVBut here's the problem:
p187
aVEvery doctor in the world, every hospital administrator,
p188
aVhas seen TV \u2014 curse those "ER" reruns!
p189
aVTurns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like.
p190
aVThey want Buck Rogers, they don't want effective.
p191
aVIt sounds crazy, it sounds dumb,
p192
aVbut there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment
p193
aVthan something that looks cheap and crummy.
p194
aVSo again, if we want people to trust a device,
p195
aVit has to look trustworthy.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo thinking about outcomes,
p198
aVit turns out appearances matter.
p199
aVWe took all that information together.
p200
aVWe tried, this time, to get it right.
p201
aVAnd here's what we developed.
p202
aVThis is the Firefly phototherapy device,
p203
aVexcept this time, we didn't stop at the concept car.
p204
aVFrom the very beginning, we started by talking to manufacturers.
p205
aVOur goal is to make a state-of-the-art product
p206
aVthat our partner MTTS can actually manufacture.
p207
aVOur goal is to study how they work, the resources they have access to,
p208
aVso that they can make this product.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo that's the design for manufacture question.
p211
aVWhen we think about actual use,
p212
aVyou'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet.
p213
aVIt only fits a single baby,
p214
aVand the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device.
p215
aVIf you try to put more than one kid in,
p216
aVyou're stacking them on top of each other.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VSo the idea here is you want to make it hard to use wrong.
p221
aVIn other words, you want to make the right way to use it
p222
aVthe easiest way to use it.
p223
aVAnother example \u2014 again, silly Mom.
p224
aVSilly Mom thinks her baby looks cold, wants to put a blanket over the baby.
p225
aVThat's why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly,
p226
aVso if Mom does put a blanket over the baby,
p227
aVit's still receiving effective phototherapy from below.
p228
aa(lp229
VLast story here:
p230
aVI've got a friend in India who told me
p231
aVthat you haven't really tested a piece of electronic technology
p232
aVfor distribution in Asia,
p233
aVuntil you've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee
p234
aVon every single little component on the inside.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VYou think it's funny.
p239
aVI had a laptop in the Peace Corps,
p240
aVand the screen had all these dead pixels on it.
p241
aVAnd one day I looked in \u2014 they were all dead ants
p242
aVthat had gotten into my laptop and perished.
p243
aVThose poor ants.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VSo with Firefly, what we did is \u2014 the problem is electronics get hot,
p248
aVand you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool \u2014
p249
aVin most products.
p250
aVWe decided we can't put a "Do not enter" sign next to the vent.
p251
aVWe actually got rid of all that stuff.
p252
aVSo Firefly's totally sealed.
p253
aa(lp254
VThese are the kinds of lessons \u2014
p255
aVas awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager,
p256
aVmuch worse to be a frustrated designer.
p257
aVSo I was thinking, "What I really want to do is change the world.
p258
aVI have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution.
p259
aVI have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device.
p260
aVI actually have to pay attention. There's no excuse for failure.
p261
aa(lp262
VI have to think like an existentialist.
p263
aVI have to accept that there are no dumb users, only dumb products."
p264
aVWe have to ask ourselves hard questions.
p265
aVAre we designing for the world that we want?
p266
aVAre we designing for the world that we have?
p267
aVAre we designing for the world that's coming,
p268
aVwhether we're ready or not?
p269
aa(lp270
VI got into this business designing products.
p271
aVI've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world,
p272
aVyou have to design outcomes.
p273
aVAnd that's design that matters.
p274
aa(lp275
VThank you.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Applause)

CEO of Design that Matters, a nonprofit that collaborates  with social entrepreneurs and volunteers to design products for the poor in developing countries.

He is a Martin Fellow at the MIT  Laboratory for Energy and the Environment, a Draper Richards Kaplan  Fellow, and was named an Ashoka Affiliate in 2004. His awards include  the 2007 Social Venture Network Innovation Award, and the 2009 World  Technology Award. This year, Design That Matters was  named the winner of the National Design Award in Corporate and  Institutional Achievement.</p><p>Tim and his team made a splash when they created the NeoNurture Infant Incubator, named one of TIME Magazine&#39;s  &quot;50 Best Inventions of 2010.&quot; However, the product wasn&#39;t a hit with manufacturers or with hospitals in developing countries and forever remained a prototype. Design That Matters learned an important lesson from the experience -- that good design must keep in mind who will procure equipment, who will be using it, as well as the myriad ways it could be used incorrectly.

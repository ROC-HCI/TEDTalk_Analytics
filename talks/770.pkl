VI want to talk about my investigations
p5
aVinto what technology means in our lives \u2014
p6
aVnot just our immediate life, but in the cosmic sense,
p7
aVin the kind of long history of the world
p8
aVand our place in the world.
p9
aVWhat is this stuff?
p10
aVWhat is the significance?
p11
aVAnd so, I want to kind of go through my little story
p12
aVof what I found out.
p13
aa(lp14
VOne of the first things I started to investigate
p15
aVwas the history of the name of technology.
p16
aVIn the United States, there is a State of the Union address
p17
aVgiven by every president since 1790.
p18
aVAnd each one of those is kind of summing up the most important things
p19
aVfor the United States at that time.
p20
aVIf you search for the word "technology," it was not used until 1952.
p21
aVSo, technology was sort of absent from everybody's thinking until 1952,
p22
aVwhich happened to be the year of my birth.
p23
aVAnd obviously, technology had existed before then,
p24
aVbut we weren't aware of it.
p25
aVAnd so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life.
p26
aa(lp27
VI actually did research to find out the first use of the word "technology."
p28
aVIt was in 1829,
p29
aVand it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum \u2014
p30
aVa course, bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts, and industry \u2014
p31
aVand he called it "Technology."
p32
aVAnd that's the very first use of the word.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo what is this stuff
p35
aVthat we're all consumed by and bothered by?
p36
aVAlan Kay calls it, "Technology is anything that was invented
p37
aVafter you were born."
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VWhich is sort of the idea we normally have about what technology is:
p42
aVit's all that new stuff.
p43
aVIt's not roads, or penicillin,
p44
aVor factory tires; it's the new stuff.
p45
aVMy friend Danny Hillis says kind of a similar one,
p46
aVhe says, "Technology is anything that doesn't work yet."
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VWhich is, again, a sense that it's all new.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut we know that it's just not new.
p53
aVIt actually goes way back,
p54
aVand what I want to suggest is, it goes a long way back.
p55
aVSo, another way to think about technology, what it means,
p56
aVis to imagine a world without technology.
p57
aVIf we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today \u2014
p58
aVand I mean everything, from blades to scrapers to cloth \u2014
p59
aVwe, as a species, would not live very long.
p60
aVWe would die by the billions, and very quickly:
p61
aVthe wolves would get us, we would be defenseless,
p62
aVwe would be unable to grow enough food or find enough food.
p63
aa(lp64
VEven the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools.
p65
aVSo, they had minimal technology,
p66
aVbut they had some technology.
p67
aVAnd if we study those hunter-gatherer tribes
p68
aVand the Neanderthal, which are very similar to early man,
p69
aVwe find out a very curious thing about this world without technology,
p70
aVand this is a kind of a curve of their average age.
p71
aa(lp72
VThere are no Neanderthal fossils that are older than 40 years old
p73
aVthat we've ever found,
p74
aVand the average age of most of these hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30.
p75
aVThere are very few young infants, because they die \u2014 high mortality rate \u2014
p76
aVand there's very few old people.
p77
aVSo the profile is sort of for your average San Francisco neighborhood:
p78
aVa lot of young people.
p79
aVAnd if you go there, you say, "Hey, everybody's really healthy."
p80
aVWell, that's because they're all young.
p81
aa(lp82
VSame thing with the hunter-gatherer tribes and early man:
p83
aVyou didn't live beyond the age of 30.
p84
aVSo it was a world without grandparents.
p85
aVAnd grandparents are very important,
p86
aVbecause they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information.
p87
aVImagine a world where basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old.
p88
aVHow much learning can you do?
p89
aVYou can't do very much learning in your own life,
p90
aVit's so short,
p91
aVand there's nobody to pass on what you do learn.
p92
aVSo that's one aspect.
p93
aa(lp94
VIt was a very short life.
p95
aVBut at the same time, anthropologists know
p96
aVthat most hunter-gatherer tribes of the world,
p97
aVwith that very little technology,
p98
aVactually did not spend a very long time gathering the food they needed:
p99
aVthree to six hours a day.
p100
aVSome anthropologists call that the original affluent society,
p101
aVbecause they had bankers' hours, basically.
p102
aVSo it was possible to get enough food.
p103
aVBut when the scarcity came,
p104
aVwhen the highs and lows and the droughts came,
p105
aVthen people went into starvation.
p106
aVAnd that's why they didn't live very long.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo what technology brought,
p109
aVthrough the very simple tools like these stone tools here \u2014
p110
aVeven something as small as this \u2014
p111
aVthe early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction
p112
aVabout 250 megafauna animals in North America
p113
aVwhen they first arrived 10,000 years ago.
p114
aVSo, long before the industrial age,
p115
aVwe've been affecting the planet on a global scale
p116
aVwith just a small amount of technology.
p117
aa(lp118
VThe other thing that the early man invented was fire.
p119
aVAnd fire was used to clear out, and again,
p120
aVaffected the ecology of grass and whole continents,
p121
aVand was used in cooking.
p122
aVIt enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things.
p123
aVIt was, in a certain sense, in a McLuhan sense,
p124
aVan external stomach,
p125
aVin the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise.
p126
aVAnd if we didn't have fire, we actually could not live.
p127
aVOur bodies have adapted to these new diets.
p128
aVOur bodies have changed in the last 10,000 years.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, with that little bit of technology,
p131
aVhumans went from a small band of 10,000 or so \u2014
p132
aVthe same number as Neanderthals everywhere \u2014
p133
aVand we suddenly exploded.
p134
aVWith the invention of language around 50,000 years ago,
p135
aVthe number of humans exploded,
p136
aVand very quickly became the dominant species on the planet.
p137
aVAnd they migrated into the rest of the world
p138
aVat two kilometers per year
p139
aVuntil, within several tens of thousands of years,
p140
aVwe occupied every single watershed on the planet
p141
aVand became the most dominant species,
p142
aVwith a very small amount of technology.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd even at that time, with the introduction of agriculture,
p145
aV8,000, 10,000 years ago,
p146
aVwe started to see climate change.
p147
aVSo climate change is not a new thing; what's new is just the degree of it.
p148
aVEven during the agricultural age, there was climate change.
p149
aVSo already, small amounts of technology were transforming the world.
p150
aVAnd what this means, and where I'm going,
p151
aVis that technology has become the most powerful force in the world.
p152
aVAll the things we see today that are changing our lives,
p153
aVwe can always trace back
p154
aVto the introduction of some new technology.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo it's a force,
p157
aVthat is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet,
p158
aVand in such a degree,
p159
aVthat I think it's become who we are.
p160
aVIn fact, our humanity and everything that we think about ourselves,
p161
aVis something we've invented.
p162
aVSo we've invented ourselves.
p163
aVOf all the animals that we've domesticated,
p164
aVthe most important animal has been us.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo humanity is our greatest invention,
p167
aVbut of course, we're not done yet.
p168
aVWe're still inventing,
p169
aVand this is what technology is allowing us to do;
p170
aVit's continually to reinvent ourselves.
p171
aVIt's a very, very strong force.
p172
aVI call this entire thing \u2014 us humans as our technology,
p173
aVeverything that we've made, gadgets in our lives \u2014
p174
aVwe call that the technium.
p175
aVThat's this world.
p176
aVMy working definition of technology is:
p177
aVanything useful that a human mind makes.
p178
aVIt's not just hammers and gadgets, like laptops.
p179
aVBut it's also law.
p180
aVAnd, of course, cities are ways to make things more useful to us.
p181
aVWhile this is something that comes from our mind,
p182
aVit also has its roots deeply into the cosmos.
p183
aa(lp184
VIt goes back.
p185
aVThe origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang,
p186
aVin this way, in that they are part of this self-organizing thread
p187
aVthat starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars,
p188
aVinto life, into us.
p189
aVAnd the three major phases of the early universe
p190
aVwas energy, when the dominant force was energy;
p191
aVthen the dominant force, as it cooled, became matter;
p192
aVand then, with the invention of life four billion years ago,
p193
aVthe dominant force in our neighborhood became information.
p194
aVThat's what life is:
p195
aVan information process that was restructuring
p196
aVand making new order.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo, energy and matter, Einstein showed were equivalent,
p199
aVand now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information
p200
aVand matter and energy
p201
aVare all interrelated.
p202
aVSo it's one long continuum.
p203
aVYou put energy into the right kind of system,
p204
aVand out comes wasted heat, entropy,
p205
aVand extropy, which is order.
p206
aVIt's the increased order.
p207
aa(lp208
VWhere does this order come from?
p209
aVIts roots go way back.
p210
aVWe actually don't know.
p211
aVBut we do know
p212
aVthat the self-organization trend throughout the universe is long,
p213
aVand it began with things like galaxies;
p214
aVthey maintained their order for billions of years.
p215
aVStars are basically nuclear fission machines
p216
aVthat self-organize and self-sustain themselves for billions of years:
p217
aVorder against the extropy of the world.
p218
aVAnd flowers and plants are the same thing, extended,
p219
aVand technology is basically an extension of life.
p220
aa(lp221
VOne trend that we notice in all those things
p222
aVis that the amount of energy per gram per second
p223
aVthat flows through this
p224
aVis actually increasing.
p225
aVThe amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence.
p226
aVAnd the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life
p227
aVis actually greater than a star \u2014
p228
aVbecause of the star's long lifespan,
p229
aVthe energy density in life is actually higher than a star.
p230
aVAnd the energy density that we see in the greatest amount
p231
aVanywhere in the universe
p232
aVis actually in a PC chip.
p233
aVThere is more energy flowing through, per gram per second,
p234
aVthan anything that we have any other experience with.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd so, what I would suggest
p237
aVis that if you want to see where technology is going,
p238
aVwe continue that trajectory,
p239
aVand we say, "Well, it's going to become more energy-dense,
p240
aVthat's where it's going."
p241
aVAnd so what I've done is, I've taken the same kinds of things
p242
aVand looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say,
p243
aV"What are the general trends in evolutionary life?"
p244
aVAnd there are things moving towards greater complexity,
p245
aVmoving towards greater diversity, moving towards greater specialization,
p246
aVsentience, ubiquity, and most important, evolvability.
p247
aVThose very same things are also present in technology.
p248
aVThat's where technology is going.
p249
aa(lp250
VIn fact, technology is accelerating all the aspects of life.
p251
aVAnd we can see that happening;
p252
aVjust as there's diversity in life, there's more diversity in things we make.
p253
aVThings in life start off being general cells,
p254
aVand they become specialized:
p255
aVyou have tissue cells, muscle, brain cells.
p256
aVThe same thing happens with, say, a hammer,
p257
aVwhich is general at first and becomes more specific.
p258
aVSo I would like to say that while there are six kingdoms of life,
p259
aVwe can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life.
p260
aVIt's a branching off from the human form.
p261
aa(lp262
VBut technology has its own agenda, like anything, like life itself.
p263
aVFor instance, right now, three-quarters of the energy that we use
p264
aVis actually used to feed the technium itself.
p265
aVIn transportation, it's not to move us;
p266
aVit's to move the stuff we make or buy.
p267
aVI use the word "want." Technology wants.
p268
aVThis is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power.
p269
aVYour cat wants more food.
p270
aVA bacterium, which has no consciousness at all,
p271
aVwants to move towards light.
p272
aVIt has an urge, and technology has an urge.
p273
aa(lp274
VAt the same time, it wants to give us things,
p275
aVand what it gives us is basically progress.
p276
aVYou can take all kinds of curves, and they're all pointing up.
p277
aVThere's really no dispute about progress,
p278
aVif we discount the cost of that.
p279
aVAnd that's the thing that bothers most people,
p280
aVis that progress is really real, but we wonder and question:
p281
aVWhat are the environmental costs of it?
p282
aa(lp283
VI did a survey of the number of species of artifacts in my house,
p284
aVand there's 6,000.
p285
aVOther people have come up with 10,000.
p286
aVWhen King Henry of England died,
p287
aVhe had 18,000 things in his house,
p288
aVbut that was the entire wealth of England, so ...
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd with that entire wealth of England,
p293
aVKing Henry could not buy any antibiotics,
p294
aVhe could not buy refrigeration,
p295
aVhe could not buy a trip of a thousand miles,
p296
aVwhereas this rickshaw wallah in India could save up and buy antibiotics
p297
aVand he could buy refrigeration.
p298
aVHe could buy things that King Henry, in all his wealth, could never buy.
p299
aVThat's what progress is about.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo, technology is selfish; technology is generous.
p302
aVThat conflict, that tension, will be with us forever:
p303
aVsometimes it wants to do what it wants to do,
p304
aVand sometimes it's going to do things for us.
p305
aVWe have confusion about what we should think
p306
aVabout a new technology.
p307
aVRight now the default position when a new technology comes along,
p308
aVis people talk about the precautionary principle,
p309
aVwhich is very common in Europe,
p310
aVwhich says, basically, "Don't do anything.
p311
aVWhen you meet a new technology, stop,
p312
aVuntil it can be proven that it does no harm."
p313
aVI think that really leads nowhere.
p314
aa(lp315
VBut a better way is what I call the proactionary principle,
p316
aVwhich is, you engage with technology.
p317
aVYou try it out.
p318
aVYou obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests,
p319
aVyou try to anticipate it,
p320
aVbut after anticipating it,
p321
aVyou constantly asses it,
p322
aVnot just once, but eternally.
p323
aVAnd when it diverts from what you want,
p324
aVwe prioritize risk, we evaluate not just the new stuff,
p325
aVbut the old stuff.
p326
aVWe fix it; but most importantly,
p327
aVwe relocate it.
p328
aVAnd what I mean by that is,
p329
aVwe find a new job for it.
p330
aa(lp331
VNuclear energy, fission, is a really bad idea for bombs.
p332
aVBut it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy
p333
aVfor electricity, instead of burning coal.
p334
aVWhen we have a bad idea,
p335
aVthe response to a bad idea
p336
aVis not no ideas, it's not to stop thinking.
p337
aVThe response to a bad idea \u2014
p338
aVlike, say, a tungsten lightbulb \u2014
p339
aVis a better idea.
p340
aVSo, better ideas is really always the response
p341
aVto technology we don't like;
p342
aVit's basically better technology.
p343
aVAnd actually, in a certain sense, technology is a kind of a method
p344
aVfor generating better ideas,
p345
aVif you can think about it that way.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo, maybe spraying DDT on crops is a really bad idea.
p348
aVBut DDT sprayed on local homes \u2014
p349
aVthere's nothing better to eliminate malaria,
p350
aVbesides insect DDT-impregnated mosquito nets.
p351
aVBut that's a really good idea; that's a good job for technology.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo our job as humans is to parent our mind children,
p354
aVto find them good friends,
p355
aVto find them a good job.
p356
aVAnd so, every technology is sort of a creative force
p357
aVlooking for the right job.
p358
aVThat's actually my son, right here.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
VThere are no bad technologies,
p363
aVjust as there are no bad children.
p364
aVWe don't say children are neutral; children are positive.
p365
aVWe just have to find them the right place.
p366
aa(lp367
VAnd so, what technology gives us over the long term \u2014
p368
aVover this sort of extended evolution from the beginning of time,
p369
aVthrough the invention of the plants and animals,
p370
aVand the evolution of life, the evolution of brains \u2014
p371
aVwhat that is constantly giving us is increasing differences:
p372
aVIt's increasing diversity, it's increasing options,
p373
aVit's increasing choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
p374
aVThat's what we get from technology all the time.
p375
aVThat's why people leave villages and go into cities \u2014
p376
aVbecause they are always gravitating towards increased choices
p377
aVand possibilities.
p378
aVAnd we are aware of the price;
p379
aVwe pay a price for that, but we're aware of it,
p380
aVand generally, we will pay the price for increased freedoms,
p381
aVchoices and opportunities.
p382
aa(lp383
VEven technology wants clean water.
p384
aVIs technology diametrically opposed to nature?
p385
aVBecause technology is an extension of life,
p386
aVit's in parallel and aligned with the same things
p387
aVthat life wants.
p388
aVSo that I think technology loves biology,
p389
aVif we allow it to.
p390
aVGreat movement starting billions of years ago
p391
aVis moving through us and it continues to go,
p392
aVand our choice, so to speak, in technology,
p393
aVis really to align ourselves with this force
p394
aVmuch greater than ourselves.
p395
aa(lp396
VSo, technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket;
p397
aVit's more than just gadgets,
p398
aVit's more than just things that people invent.
p399
aVIt's actually part of a very long story \u2014 a great story \u2014
p400
aVthat began billions of years ago.
p401
aVIt's moving through us, this self-organization,
p402
aVand we're extending and accelerating it,
p403
aVand we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it.
p404
aVAnd I really appreciate your attention today.
p405
aa(lp406
VThank you.

VIt's Monday morning.
p5
aVIn Washington,
p6
aVthe president of the United States
p7
aVis sitting in the Oval Office,
p8
aVassessing whether or not
p9
aVto strike Al Qaeda
p10
aVin Yemen.
p11
aVAt Number 10 Downing Street,
p12
aVDavid Cameron is trying to work out
p13
aVwhether to cut more public sector jobs
p14
aVin order to stave off a double-dip recession.
p15
aVIn Madrid, Maria Gonzalez
p16
aVis standing at the door,
p17
aVlistening to her baby crying and crying,
p18
aVtrying to work out whether she should let it cry
p19
aVuntil it falls asleep
p20
aVor pick it up and hold it.
p21
aVAnd I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital,
p22
aVtrying to work out
p23
aVwhether I should let him drink
p24
aVthe one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water
p25
aVthat his doctors just came in and said,
p26
aV"You must make him drink today," \u2014
p27
aVmy father's been nil by mouth for a week \u2014
p28
aVor whether, by giving him this bottle,
p29
aVI might actually kill him.
p30
aa(lp31
VWe face momentous decisions
p32
aVwith important consequences
p33
aVthroughout our lives,
p34
aVand we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.
p35
aVWe talk things over with our friends,
p36
aVwe scour the Internet,
p37
aVwe search through books.
p38
aVBut still,
p39
aVeven in this age
p40
aVof Google and TripAdvisor
p41
aVand Amazon Recommends,
p42
aVit's still experts
p43
aVthat we rely upon most \u2014
p44
aVespecially when the stakes are high
p45
aVand the decision really matters.
p46
aVBecause in a world of data deluge
p47
aVand extreme complexity,
p48
aVwe believe that experts
p49
aVare more able to process information than we can \u2014
p50
aVthat they are able to come to better conclusions
p51
aVthan we could come to on our own.
p52
aVAnd in an age
p53
aVthat is sometimes nowadays frightening
p54
aVor confusing,
p55
aVwe feel reassured
p56
aVby the almost parental-like authority
p57
aVof experts
p58
aVwho tell us so clearly what it is
p59
aVwe can and cannot do.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut I believe
p62
aVthat this is a big problem,
p63
aVa problem with potentially dangerous consequences
p64
aVfor us as a society,
p65
aVas a culture
p66
aVand as individuals.
p67
aVIt's not that experts
p68
aVhave not massively contributed to the world \u2014
p69
aVof course they have.
p70
aVThe problem lies with us:
p71
aVwe've become addicted to experts.
p72
aVWe've become addicted to their certainty,
p73
aVtheir assuredness,
p74
aVtheir definitiveness,
p75
aVand in the process,
p76
aVwe have ceded our responsibility,
p77
aVsubstituting our intellect
p78
aVand our intelligence
p79
aVfor their supposed words of wisdom.
p80
aVWe've surrendered our power,
p81
aVtrading off our discomfort
p82
aVwith uncertainty
p83
aVfor the illusion of certainty
p84
aVthat they provide.
p85
aVThis is no exaggeration.
p86
aVIn a recent experiment,
p87
aVa group of adults
p88
aVhad their brains scanned in an MRI machine
p89
aVas they were listening to experts speak.
p90
aVThe results were quite extraordinary.
p91
aVAs they listened to the experts' voices,
p92
aVthe independent decision-making parts of their brains
p93
aVswitched off.
p94
aVIt literally flat-lined.
p95
aVAnd they listened to whatever the experts said
p96
aVand took their advice, however right or wrong.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut experts do get things wrong.
p99
aVDid you know that studies show
p100
aVthat doctors misdiagnose
p101
aVfour times out of 10?
p102
aVDid you know
p103
aVthat if you file your tax returns yourself,
p104
aVyou're statistically more likely
p105
aVto be filing them correctly
p106
aVthan if you get a tax adviser
p107
aVto do it for you?
p108
aVAnd then there's, of course, the example
p109
aVthat we're all too aware of:
p110
aVfinancial experts
p111
aVgetting it so wrong
p112
aVthat we're living through the worst recession
p113
aVsince the 1930s.
p114
aVFor the sake of our health,
p115
aVour wealth
p116
aVand our collective security,
p117
aVit's imperative that we keep
p118
aVthe independent decision-making parts of our brains
p119
aVswitched on.
p120
aVAnd I'm saying this as an economist
p121
aVwho, over the past few years,
p122
aVhas focused my research
p123
aVon what it is we think
p124
aVand who it is we trust and why,
p125
aVbut also \u2014
p126
aVand I'm aware of the irony here \u2014
p127
aVas an expert myself,
p128
aVas a professor,
p129
aVas somebody who advises prime ministers,
p130
aVheads of big companies,
p131
aVinternational organizations,
p132
aVbut an expert who believes
p133
aVthat the role of experts needs to change,
p134
aVthat we need to become more open-minded,
p135
aVmore democratic
p136
aVand be more open
p137
aVto people rebelling against
p138
aVour points of view.
p139
aVSo in order to help you understand
p140
aVwhere I'm coming from,
p141
aVlet me bring you into my world,
p142
aVthe world of experts.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow there are, of course, exceptions,
p145
aVwonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.
p146
aVBut what my research has shown me
p147
aVis that experts tend on the whole
p148
aVto form very rigid camps,
p149
aVthat within these camps,
p150
aVa dominant perspective emerges
p151
aVthat often silences opposition,
p152
aVthat experts move with the prevailing winds,
p153
aVoften hero-worshipping
p154
aVtheir own gurus.
p155
aVAlan Greenspan's proclamations
p156
aVthat the years of economic growth
p157
aVwould go on and on,
p158
aVnot challenged by his peers,
p159
aVuntil after the crisis, of course.
p160
aVYou see,
p161
aVwe also learn
p162
aVthat experts are located,
p163
aVare governed,
p164
aVby the social and cultural norms
p165
aVof their times \u2014
p166
aVwhether it be the doctors
p167
aVin Victorian England, say,
p168
aVwho sent women to asylums
p169
aVfor expressing sexual desire,
p170
aVor the psychiatrists in the United States
p171
aVwho, up until 1973,
p172
aVwere still categorizing homosexuality
p173
aVas a mental illness.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd what all this means
p176
aVis that paradigms
p177
aVtake far too long to shift,
p178
aVthat complexity and nuance are ignored
p179
aVand also that money talks \u2014
p180
aVbecause we've all seen the evidence
p181
aVof pharmaceutical companies
p182
aVfunding studies of drugs
p183
aVthat conveniently leave out
p184
aVtheir worst side effects,
p185
aVor studies funded by food companies
p186
aVof their new products,
p187
aVmassively exaggerating the health benefits
p188
aVof the products they're about to bring by market.
p189
aVThe study showed that food companies exaggerated
p190
aVtypically seven times more
p191
aVthan an independent study.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd we've also got to be aware
p194
aVthat experts, of course,
p195
aValso make mistakes.
p196
aVThey make mistakes every single day \u2014
p197
aVmistakes born out of carelessness.
p198
aVA recent study in the Archives of Surgery
p199
aVreported surgeons
p200
aVremoving healthy ovaries,
p201
aVoperating on the wrong side of the brain,
p202
aVcarrying out procedures on the wrong hand,
p203
aVelbow, eye, foot,
p204
aVand also mistakes born out of thinking errors.
p205
aVA common thinking error
p206
aVof radiologists, for example \u2014
p207
aVwhen they look at CT scans \u2014
p208
aVis that they're overly influenced
p209
aVby whatever it is
p210
aVthat the referring physician has said
p211
aVthat he suspects
p212
aVthe patient's problem to be.
p213
aVSo if a radiologist
p214
aVis looking at the scan
p215
aVof a patient with suspected pneumonia, say,
p216
aVwhat happens is that,
p217
aVif they see evidence
p218
aVof pneumonia on the scan,
p219
aVthey literally stop looking at it \u2014
p220
aVthereby missing the tumor
p221
aVsitting three inches below
p222
aVon the patient's lungs.
p223
aa(lp224
VI've shared with you so far
p225
aVsome insights into the world of experts.
p226
aVThese are, of course,
p227
aVnot the only insights I could share,
p228
aVbut I hope they give you a clear sense at least
p229
aVof why we need to stop kowtowing to them,
p230
aVwhy we need to rebel
p231
aVand why we need to switch
p232
aVour independent decision-making capabilities on.
p233
aVBut how can we do this?
p234
aVWell for the sake of time,
p235
aVI want to focus on just three strategies.
p236
aVFirst, we've got to be ready and willing
p237
aVto take experts on
p238
aVand dispense with this notion of them
p239
aVas modern-day apostles.
p240
aVThis doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.
p241
aVin every single subject,
p242
aVyou'll be relieved to hear.
p243
aVBut it does mean persisting
p244
aVin the face of their inevitable annoyance
p245
aVwhen, for example,
p246
aVwe want them to explain things to us
p247
aVin language that we can actually understand.
p248
aVWhy was it that, when I had an operation,
p249
aVmy doctor said to me,
p250
aV"Beware, Ms. Hertz,
p251
aVof hyperpyrexia,"
p252
aVwhen he could have just as easily said,
p253
aV"Watch out for a high fever."
p254
aVYou see, being ready to take experts on
p255
aVis about also being willing
p256
aVto dig behind their graphs,
p257
aVtheir equations, their forecasts,
p258
aVtheir prophecies,
p259
aVand being armed with the questions to do that \u2014
p260
aVquestions like:
p261
aVWhat are the assumptions that underpin this?
p262
aVWhat is the evidence upon which this is based?
p263
aVWhat has your investigation focused on?
p264
aVAnd what has it ignored?
p265
aa(lp266
VIt recently came out
p267
aVthat experts trialing drugs
p268
aVbefore they come to market
p269
aVtypically trial drugs
p270
aVfirst, primarily on male animals
p271
aVand then, primarily on men.
p272
aVIt seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact
p273
aVthat over half the world's population are women.
p274
aVAnd women have drawn the short medical straw
p275
aVbecause it now turns out that many of these drugs
p276
aVdon't work nearly as well on women
p277
aVas they do on men \u2014
p278
aVand the drugs that do work well work so well
p279
aVthat they're actively harmful for women to take.
p280
aVBeing a rebel is about recognizing
p281
aVthat experts' assumptions
p282
aVand their methodologies
p283
aVcan easily be flawed.
p284
aa(lp285
VSecond,
p286
aVwe need to create the space
p287
aVfor what I call "managed dissent."
p288
aVIf we are to shift paradigms,
p289
aVif we are to make breakthroughs,
p290
aVif we are to destroy myths,
p291
aVwe need to create an environment
p292
aVin which expert ideas are battling it out,
p293
aVin which we're bringing in
p294
aVnew, diverse, discordant, heretical views
p295
aVinto the discussion,
p296
aVfearlessly,
p297
aVin the knowledge that progress comes about,
p298
aVnot only from the creation of ideas,
p299
aVbut also from their destruction \u2014
p300
aVand also from the knowledge
p301
aVthat, by surrounding ourselves
p302
aVby divergent, discordant,
p303
aVheretical views.
p304
aVAll the research now shows us
p305
aVthat this actually makes us smarter.
p306
aVEncouraging dissent is a rebellious notion
p307
aVbecause it goes against our very instincts,
p308
aVwhich are to surround ourselves
p309
aVwith opinions and advice
p310
aVthat we already believe
p311
aVor want to be true.
p312
aVAnd that's why I talk about the need
p313
aVto actively manage dissent.
p314
aa(lp315
VGoogle CEO Eric Schmidt
p316
aVis a practical practitioner
p317
aVof this philosophy.
p318
aVIn meetings, he looks out for the person in the room \u2014
p319
aVarms crossed, looking a bit bemused \u2014
p320
aVand draws them into the discussion,
p321
aVtrying to see if they indeed are
p322
aVthe person with a different opinion,
p323
aVso that they have dissent within the room.
p324
aVManaging dissent
p325
aVis about recognizing the value
p326
aVof disagreement, discord
p327
aVand difference.
p328
aVBut we need to go even further.
p329
aVWe need to fundamentally redefine
p330
aVwho it is that experts are.
p331
aVThe conventional notion
p332
aVis that experts are people
p333
aVwith advanced degrees,
p334
aVfancy titles, diplomas,
p335
aVbest-selling books \u2014
p336
aVhigh-status individuals.
p337
aVBut just imagine
p338
aVif we were to junk
p339
aVthis notion of expertise
p340
aVas some sort of elite cadre
p341
aVand instead embrace the notion
p342
aVof democratized expertise \u2014
p343
aVwhereby expertise was not just the preserve
p344
aVof surgeons and CEO's,
p345
aVbut also shop-girls \u2014 yeah.
p346
aa(lp347
VBest Buy,
p348
aVthe consumer electronics company,
p349
aVgets all its employees \u2014
p350
aVthe cleaners, the shop assistants,
p351
aVthe people in the back office,
p352
aVnot just its forecasting team \u2014
p353
aVto place bets, yes bets,
p354
aVon things like whether or not
p355
aVa product is going to sell well before Christmas,
p356
aVon whether customers' new ideas
p357
aVare going to be or should be taken on by the company,
p358
aVon whether a project
p359
aVwill come in on time.
p360
aVBy leveraging
p361
aVand by embracing
p362
aVthe expertise within the company,
p363
aVBest Buy was able to discover, for example,
p364
aVthat the store that it was going to open in China \u2014
p365
aVits big, grand store \u2014
p366
aVwas not going to open on time.
p367
aVBecause when it asked its staff,
p368
aVall its staff, to place their bets
p369
aVon whether they thought the store would open on time or not,
p370
aVa group from the finance department
p371
aVplaced all their chips
p372
aVon that not happening.
p373
aVIt turned out that they were aware,
p374
aVas no one else within the company was,
p375
aVof a technological blip
p376
aVthat neither the forecasting experts,
p377
aVnor the experts on the ground in China,
p378
aVwere even aware of.
p379
aa(lp380
VThe strategies
p381
aVthat I have discussed this evening \u2014
p382
aVembracing dissent,
p383
aVtaking experts on,
p384
aVdemocratizing expertise,
p385
aVrebellious strategies \u2014
p386
aVare strategies that I think
p387
aVwould serve us all well to embrace
p388
aVas we try to deal with the challenges
p389
aVof these very confusing, complex,
p390
aVdifficult times.
p391
aVFor if we keep
p392
aVour independent decision-making part
p393
aVof our brains switched on,
p394
aVif we challenge experts, if we're skeptical,
p395
aVif we devolve authority,
p396
aVif we are rebellious,
p397
aVbut also
p398
aVif we become much more comfortable
p399
aVwith nuance,
p400
aVuncertainty and doubt,
p401
aVand if we allow our experts
p402
aVto express themselves
p403
aVusing those terms too,
p404
aVwe will set ourselves up
p405
aVmuch better
p406
aVfor the challenges of the 21st century.
p407
aVFor now, more than ever,
p408
aVis not the time
p409
aVto be blindly following,
p410
aVblindly accepting,
p411
aVblindly trusting.
p412
aVNow is the time to face the world
p413
aVwith eyes wide open \u2014
p414
aVyes, using experts
p415
aVto help us figure things out, for sure \u2014
p416
aVI don't want to completely do myself out of a job here \u2014
p417
aVbut being aware
p418
aVof their limitations
p419
aVand, of course, also our own.
p420

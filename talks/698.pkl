VIt's a bit funny to be
p5
aVat a conference dedicated to things not seen,
p6
aVand present my proposal to build
p7
aVa 6,000-kilometer-long wall
p8
aVacross the entire African continent.
p9
aVAbout the size of the Great Wall of China,
p10
aVthis would hardly be an invisible structure.
p11
aVAnd yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye:
p12
aVbacteria and grains of sand.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, as architects we're trained to solve problems.
p15
aVBut I don't really believe in architectural problems;
p16
aVI only believe in opportunities.
p17
aVWhich is why I'll show you a threat,
p18
aVand an architectural response.
p19
aVThe threat is desertification.
p20
aVMy response is a sandstone wall
p21
aVmade from bacteria and solidified sand,
p22
aVstretching across the desert.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, sand is a magical material
p25
aVof beautiful contradictions.
p26
aVIt is simple and complex.
p27
aVIt is peaceful and violent.
p28
aVIt is always the same, never the same,
p29
aVendlessly fascinating.
p30
aVOne billion grains of sand
p31
aVcome into existence in the world each second.
p32
aVThat's a cyclical process.
p33
aVAs rocks and mountains die,
p34
aVgrains of sand are born.
p35
aVSome of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.
p36
aVAnd as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free.
p37
aVSome of those grains may then accumulate
p38
aVon a massive scale,
p39
aVinto a sand dune.
p40
aa(lp41
VIn a way, the static, stone mountain
p42
aVbecomes a moving mountain of sand.
p43
aVBut, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why.
p44
aVDry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces.
p45
aVSome are already deserts;
p46
aVothers are being seriously degraded by the sand.
p47
aVJust south of the Sahara we find the Sahel.
p48
aVThe name means "edge of the desert."
p49
aVAnd this is the region most closely associated with desertification.
p50
aVIt was here in the late '60s and early '70s
p51
aVthat major droughts brought three million people
p52
aVto become dependent upon emergency food aid,
p53
aVwith about up to 250,000 dying.
p54
aa(lp55
VThis is a catastrophe waiting to happen again.
p56
aVAnd it's one that gets very little attention.
p57
aVIn our accelerated media culture,
p58
aVdesertification is simply too slow
p59
aVto reach the headlines.
p60
aVIt's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina:
p61
aVtoo few crying children and smashed up houses.
p62
aVAnd yet desertification
p63
aVis a major threat on all continents,
p64
aVaffecting some 110 countries
p65
aVand about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.
p66
aa(lp67
VIt seriously threatens the livelihoods
p68
aVof millions of people,
p69
aVand especially in Africa and China.
p70
aVAnd it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves
p71
aVthrough unsustainable use of scarce resources.
p72
aVSo, we get climate change.
p73
aVWe get droughts,
p74
aVincreased desertification,
p75
aVcrashing food systems, water scarcity,
p76
aVfamine, forced migration,
p77
aVpolitical instability, warfare, crisis.
p78
aVThat's a potential scenario
p79
aVif we fail to take this seriously.
p80
aVBut, how far away is it?
p81
aa(lp82
VI went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria
p83
aVto try and find out how far away it is.
p84
aVThe dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.
p85
aVThat's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,
p86
aVphysically pushing people away from their homes.
p87
aVHere I am \u2014 I'm the second person on the left \u2014
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVwith the elders in Gidan-Kara,
p90
aVa tiny village outside of Sokoto.
p91
aa(lp92
VThey had to move this village in 1987
p93
aVas a huge dune threatened to swallow it.
p94
aVSo, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.
p95
aVThis is where the village used to be.
p96
aVIt took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,
p97
aVwhich goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.
p98
aVThat's the kind of forced migration
p99
aVthat desertification can lead to.
p100
aVIf you happen to live close to the desert border,
p101
aVyou can pretty much calculate how long it will be
p102
aVbefore you have to carry your kids away,
p103
aVand abandon your home and your life as you know it.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.
p106
aVAnd still, those extreme environments are very good places
p107
aVif we want to stop the shifting sands.
p108
aVFour years ago, 23 African countries
p109
aVcame together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara.
p110
aVA fantastic project, the initial plan
p111
aVcalled for a shelter belt of trees to be planted
p112
aVright across the African continent,
p113
aVfrom Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east.
p114
aVIf you want to stop a sand dune from moving,
p115
aVwhat you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains
p116
aVfrom avalanching over its crest.
p117
aVAnd a good way of doing that, the most efficient way,
p118
aVis to use some kind of sand catcher.
p119
aVTrees or cacti are good for this.
p120
aVBut, one of the problems with planting trees is that
p121
aVthe people in these regions are so poor
p122
aVthat they chop them down for firewood.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow there is an alternative to just planting trees
p125
aVand hoping that they won't get chopped down.
p126
aVThis sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.
p127
aVIt adds roughness to the dune's surface,
p128
aVto the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.
p129
aVIt provides a physical support structure for the trees,
p130
aVand it creates physical spaces,
p131
aVhabitable spaces inside of the sand dunes.
p132
aVIf people live inside of the green barrier
p133
aVthey can help support the trees, protect them from humans,
p134
aVand from some of the forces of nature.
p135
aVInside of the dunes we find shade.
p136
aVWe can start harvesting condensation,
p137
aVand start greening the desert from within.
p138
aa(lp139
VSand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way.
p140
aVAll we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid,
p141
aVand then excavate the sand,
p142
aVand we have our architecture.
p143
aVWe can either excavate it by hand
p144
aVor we can have the wind excavate it for us.
p145
aVSo, the wind carries the sand onto the site
p146
aVand then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut, by now, you're probably asking,
p149
aVhow am I planning to solidify a sand dune?
p150
aVHow do we glue those grains of sand together?
p151
aVAnd the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys,
p152
aVBacillus pasteurii,
p153
aVa micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands
p154
aVand marshes, and does precisely that.
p155
aVIt takes a pile of loose sand
p156
aVand it creates sandstone out of it.
p157
aVThese images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process.
p158
aa(lp159
VWhat happens is, you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand,
p160
aVand it starts filling up the voids in between the grains.
p161
aVA chemical process produces calcite,
p162
aVwhich is a kind of natural cement
p163
aVthat binds the grains together.
p164
aVThe whole cementation process takes about 24 hours.
p165
aVI learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.
p166
aVHe managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.
p167
aVHere I am, playing the part of the mad scientist,
p168
aVworking with the bugs at UCL in London,
p169
aVtrying to solidify them.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo, how much would this cost?
p172
aVI'm not an economist, very much not,
p173
aVbut I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation \u2014
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aV\u2014 and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete
p176
aVwe would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.
p177
aVAnd, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,
p178
aVwhich you'll never have to pay again,
p179
aVone cubic meter of bacterial sand
p180
aVwould be about 11 dollars.
p181
aa(lp182
VHow do we construct something like this?
p183
aVWell, I'll quickly show you two options.
p184
aVThe first is to create a kind of balloon structure,
p185
aVfill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,
p186
aVpop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.
p187
aVThen, a few years afterwards,
p188
aVusing permacultural strategies,
p189
aVwe green that part of the desert.
p190
aa(lp191
VThe second alternative would be to use injection piles.
p192
aVSo, we pushed the piles down through the dune,
p193
aVand we create an initial bacterial surface.
p194
aVWe then pull the piles up through the dune
p195
aVand we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand
p196
aVwith the sand acting as a mold as we go up.
p197
aVSo, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,
p198
aVand then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.
p199
aa(lp200
VBut, what should they look like?
p201
aVWell, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,
p202
aVwhich look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.
p203
aVThese are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.
p204
aVAnd I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me
p205
aVwith good spatial qualities,
p206
aVfor ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.
p207
aVNow, part of the formal control over this structure
p208
aVwould be lost to nature, obviously,
p209
aVas the bacteria do their work.
p210
aVAnd I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.
p211
aVI think there is really something in that articulation
p212
aVthat is quite nice.
p213
aVWe see the result, the traces, if you like,
p214
aVof the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert
p215
aVinto these habitable environments.
p216
aa(lp217
VSome people believe that
p218
aVthis would spread uncontrollably,
p219
aVand that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.
p220
aVThat's not true at all.
p221
aVIt's a natural process. It goes on in nature today,
p222
aVand the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.
p223
aVSo, there it is \u2014
p224
aVarchitectural anti-desertification structures
p225
aVmade from the desert itself.
p226
aVSand-stopping devices, made from sand.
p227
aVThe world is likely to lose one third of its arable land
p228
aVby the end of the century.
p229
aVIn a period of unprecedented population growth
p230
aVand increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.
p231
aVAnd quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.
p232
aa(lp233
VIf nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion.
p234
aVBut, if I had something like a TED wish,
p235
aVit would be to actually get it built,
p236
aVto start building this habitable wall,
p237
aVthis very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert,
p238
aVbuilt into the dunescape itself.
p239
aVIt's not only something that supports trees,
p240
aVbut something that connects people and countries together.
p241
aVI would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure,
p242
aVand leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.
p243
aa(lp244
VBorges said that "nothing is built on stone,
p245
aVeverything is built on sand,
p246
aVbut we must build as if the sand were stone."
p247
aa(lp248
VNow, there are many details left to explore in this scheme \u2014
p249
aVpolitical, practical, ethical, financial.
p250
aVMy design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,
p251
aVis fraught with many challenges
p252
aVand difficulties in the real world.
p253
aVBut, it's a beginning, it's a vision.
p254
aVAs Borges would have it, it's the sand.
p255
aVAnd I think now is really the time
p256
aVto turn it into stone. Thank you.
p257
aV(Applause)

VTwo twin domes,
p5
aVtwo radically opposed design cultures.
p6
aVOne is made of thousands of steel parts,
p7
aVthe other of a single silk thread.
p8
aVOne is synthetic, the other organic.
p9
aVOne is imposed on the environment,
p10
aVthe other creates it.
p11
aVOne is designed for nature, the other is designed by her.
p12
aa(lp13
VMichelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble,
p14
aVhe saw a figure struggling to be free.
p15
aVThe chisel was Michelangelo's only tool.
p16
aVBut living things are not chiseled.
p17
aVThey grow.
p18
aVAnd in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information
p19
aVthat's required for every other cell to function and to replicate.
p20
aa(lp21
VTools also have consequences.
p22
aVAt least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated
p23
aVby the rigors of manufacturing and mass production.
p24
aVAssembly lines have dictated a world made of parts,
p25
aVframing the imagination of designers and architects
p26
aVwho have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies
p27
aVof discrete parts with distinct functions.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut you don't find homogenous material assemblies in nature.
p30
aVTake human skin, for example.
p31
aVOur facial skins are thin with large pores.
p32
aVOur back skins are thicker, with small pores.
p33
aVOne acts mainly as filter,
p34
aVthe other mainly as barrier,
p35
aVand yet it's the same skin: no parts, no assemblies.
p36
aVIt's a system that gradually varies its functionality
p37
aVby varying elasticity.
p38
aVSo here this is a split screen to represent my split world view,
p39
aVthe split personality of every designer and architect operating today
p40
aVbetween the chisel and the gene,
p41
aVbetween machine and organism, between assembly and growth,
p42
aVbetween Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
p43
aVThese two worldviews, my left brain and right brain,
p44
aVanalysis and synthesis, will play out on the two screens behind me.
p45
aVMy work, at its simplest level,
p46
aVis about uniting these two worldviews,
p47
aVmoving away from assembly
p48
aVand closer into growth.
p49
aa(lp50
VYou're probably asking yourselves:
p51
aVWhy now?
p52
aVWhy was this not possible 10 or even five years ago?
p53
aVWe live in a very special time in history,
p54
aVa rare time,
p55
aVa time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools
p56
aVwe've never had access to before.
p57
aVThese fields are computational design,
p58
aVallowing us to design complex forms with simple code;
p59
aVadditive manufacturing, letting us produce parts
p60
aVby adding material rather than carving it out;
p61
aVmaterials engineering, which lets us design the behavior of materials
p62
aVin high resolution;
p63
aVand synthetic biology,
p64
aVenabling us to design new biological functionality by editing DNA.
p65
aVAnd at the intersection of these four fields,
p66
aVmy team and I create.
p67
aVPlease meet the minds and hands
p68
aVof my students.
p69
aa(lp70
VWe design objects and products and structures and tools across scales,
p71
aVfrom the large-scale,
p72
aVlike this robotic arm with an 80-foot diameter reach
p73
aVwith a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings,
p74
aVto nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms
p75
aVthat glow in the dark.
p76
aVHere we've reimagined the mashrabiya,
p77
aVan archetype of ancient Arabic architecture,
p78
aVand created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized
p79
aVto shape the form of light and heat moving through it.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn our next project,
p82
aVwe explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt \u2014
p83
aVthis was for a Paris fashion show with Iris van Herpen \u2014
p84
aVlike a second skin that are made of a single part,
p85
aVstiff at the contours, flexible around the waist.
p86
aVTogether with my long-term 3D printing collaborator Stratasys,
p87
aVwe 3D-printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells,
p88
aVand I'll show more objects like it.
p89
aVThis helmet combines stiff and soft materials
p90
aVin 20-micron resolution.
p91
aVThis is the resolution of a human hair.
p92
aVIt's also the resolution of a CT scanner.
p93
aVThat designers have access
p94
aVto such high-resolution analytic and synthetic tools,
p95
aVenables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies,
p96
aVbut also the physiological makeup of our tissues.
p97
aVNext, we designed an acoustic chair,
p98
aVa chair that would be at once structural, comfortable
p99
aVand would also absorb sound.
p100
aVProfessor Carter, my collaborator, and I turned to nature for inspiration,
p101
aVand by designing this irregular surface pattern,
p102
aVit becomes sound-absorbent.
p103
aVWe printed its surface out of 44 different properties,
p104
aVvarying in rigidity, opacity and color,
p105
aVcorresponding to pressure points on the human body.
p106
aVIts surface, as in nature, varies its functionality
p107
aVnot by adding another material or another assembly,
p108
aVbut by continuously and delicately varying material property.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut is nature ideal?
p111
aVAre there no parts in nature?
p112
aVI wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home,
p113
aVbut when I was young,
p114
aVmy grandmother used to tell me stories from the Hebrew Bible,
p115
aVand one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about.
p116
aVAs she recounts:
p117
aV"On the third day of Creation, God commands the Earth
p118
aVto grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree."
p119
aVFor this first fruit tree, there was to be no differentiation
p120
aVbetween trunk, branches, leaves and fruit.
p121
aVThe whole tree was a fruit.
p122
aVInstead, the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers.
p123
aVThe land created a world made of parts.
p124
aVI often ask myself,
p125
aV"What would design be like if objects were made of a single part?
p126
aVWould we return to a better state of creation?"
p127
aa(lp128
VSo we looked for that biblical material,
p129
aVthat fruit-bearing fruit tree kind of material, and we found it.
p130
aVThe second-most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin,
p131
aVand some 100 million tons of it are produced every year
p132
aVby organisms such as shrimps, crabs, scorpions and butterflies.
p133
aVWe thought if we could tune its properties,
p134
aVwe could generate structures that are multifunctional
p135
aVout of a single part.
p136
aVSo that's what we did.
p137
aVWe called Legal Seafood \u2014
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
Vwe ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,
p142
aVwe grinded them and we produced chitosan paste.
p143
aVBy varying chemical concentrations,
p144
aVwe were able to achieve a wide array of properties \u2014
p145
aVfrom dark, stiff and opaque,
p146
aVto light, soft and transparent.
p147
aVIn order to print the structures in large scale,
p148
aVwe built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles.
p149
aVThe robot would vary material properties on the fly
p150
aVand create these 12-foot-long structures made of a single material,
p151
aV100 percent recyclable.
p152
aVWhen the parts are ready, they're left to dry
p153
aVand find a form naturally upon contact with air.
p154
aVSo why are we still designing with plastics?
p155
aVThe air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process
p156
aVwere used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms
p157
aVthat first appeared on our planet 3.5 billion year ago,
p158
aVas we learned yesterday.
p159
aVTogether with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT,
p160
aVwe embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered
p161
aVto rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere
p162
aVand convert it into sugar.
p163
aVFor the first time,
p164
aVwe were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition
p165
aVfrom beam to mesh,
p166
aVand if scaled even larger, to windows.
p167
aVA fruit-bearing fruit tree.
p168
aVWorking with an ancient material,
p169
aVone of the first lifeforms on the planet,
p170
aVplenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology,
p171
aVwe were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells
p172
aVinto an architecture that behaves like a tree.
p173
aVAnd here's the best part:
p174
aVfor objects designed to biodegrade,
p175
aVput them in the sea, and they will nourish marine life;
p176
aVplace them in soil, and they will help grow a tree.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe setting for our next exploration using the same design principles
p179
aVwas the solar system.
p180
aVWe looked for the possibility of creating life-sustaining clothing
p181
aVfor interplanetary voyages.
p182
aVTo do that, we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow.
p183
aVSo like the periodic table, we came up with our own table of the elements:
p184
aVnew lifeforms that were computationally grown,
p185
aVadditively manufactured
p186
aVand biologically augmented.
p187
aVI like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy,
p188
aVonly instead of transmuting precious metals,
p189
aVyou're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels.
p190
aVIt's called microfluidics.
p191
aVWe 3D-printed our own channels in order to control the flow
p192
aVof these liquid bacterial cultures.
p193
aVIn our first piece of clothing, we combined two microorganisms.
p194
aVThe first is cyanobacteria.
p195
aVIt lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds.
p196
aVAnd the second, E. coli, the bacterium that inhabits the human gut.
p197
aVOne converts light into sugar, the other consumes that sugar
p198
aVand produces biofuels useful for the built environment.
p199
aVNow, these two microorganisms never interact in nature.
p200
aVIn fact, they never met each other.
p201
aVThey've been here, engineered for the first time,
p202
aVto have a relationship inside a piece of clothing.
p203
aVThink of it as evolution not by natural selection,
p204
aVbut evolution by design.
p205
aVIn order to contain these relationships,
p206
aVwe've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract,
p207
aVthat will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way.
p208
aVWe then started growing these channels on the human body,
p209
aVvarying material properties according to the desired functionality.
p210
aVWhere we wanted more photosynthesis, we would design more transparent channels.
p211
aVThis wearable digestive system, when it's stretched end to end,
p212
aVspans 60 meters.
p213
aVThis is half the length of a football field,
p214
aVand 10 times as long as our small intestines.
p215
aVAnd here it is for the first time unveiled at TED \u2014
p216
aVour first photosynthetic wearable,
p217
aVliquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VThank you.
p222
aa(lp223
VMary Shelley said, "We are unfashioned creatures, but only half made up."
p224
aVWhat if design could provide that other half?
p225
aVWhat if we could create structures that would augment living matter?
p226
aVWhat if we could create personal microbiomes
p227
aVthat would scan our skins, repair damaged tissue
p228
aVand sustain our bodies?
p229
aVThink of this as a form of edited biology.
p230
aVThis entire collection, Wanderers, that was named after planets,
p231
aVwas not to me really about fashion per se,
p232
aVbut it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future
p233
aVof our race on our planet and beyond,
p234
aVto combine scientific insight with lots of mystery
p235
aVand to move away from the age of the machine
p236
aVto a new age of symbiosis between our bodies,
p237
aVthe microorganisms that we inhabit,
p238
aVour products and even our buildings.
p239
aVI call this material ecology.
p240
aa(lp241
VTo do this, we always need to return back to nature.
p242
aVBy now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
p243
aVYou also know that nature doesn't.
p244
aVIt grows. It adds with sophistication.
p245
aVThis silkworm cocoon, for example,
p246
aVcreates a highly sophisticated architecture,
p247
aVa home inside which to metamorphisize.
p248
aVNo additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication.
p249
aVIt does so by combining not two materials,
p250
aVbut two proteins in different concentrations.
p251
aVOne acts as the structure, the other is the glue, or the matrix,
p252
aVholding those fibers together.
p253
aVAnd this happens across scales.
p254
aVThe silkworm first attaches itself to the environment \u2014
p255
aVit creates a tensile structure \u2014
p256
aVand it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon.
p257
aVTension and compression, the two forces of life,
p258
aVmanifested in a single material.
p259
aa(lp260
VIn order to better understand how this complex process works,
p261
aVwe glued a tiny earth magnet
p262
aVto the head of a silkworm, to the spinneret.
p263
aVWe placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors,
p264
aVand that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud
p265
aVand visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon.
p266
aVHowever, when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch,
p267
aVnot inside a box,
p268
aVwe realized it would spin a flat cocoon
p269
aVand it would still healthily metamorphisize.
p270
aVSo we started designing different environments, different scaffolds,
p271
aVand we discovered that the shape, the composition,
p272
aVthe structure of the cocoon, was directly informed by the environment.
p273
aa(lp274
VSilkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons,
p275
aVtheir silk unraveled and used in the textile industry.
p276
aVWe realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk
p277
aVwithout boiling a single cocoon.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Applause)
p280
aa(lp281
VThey would healthily metamorphisize,
p282
aVand we would be able to create these things.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo we scaled this process up to architectural scale.
p285
aVWe had a robot spin the template out of silk,
p286
aVand we placed it on our site.
p287
aVWe knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas,
p288
aVso we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution
p289
aVof light and heat on our structure.
p290
aVWe then created holes, or apertures,
p291
aVthat would lock in the rays of light and heat,
p292
aVdistributing those silkworms on the structure.
p293
aa(lp294
VWe were ready to receive the caterpillars.
p295
aVWe ordered 6,500 silkworms from an online silk farm.
p296
aVAnd after four weeks of feeding, they were ready to spin with us.
p297
aVWe placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold,
p298
aVand as they spin they pupate, they mate, they lay eggs,
p299
aVand life begins all over again \u2014 just like us but much, much shorter.
p300
aa(lp301
VBucky Fuller said that tension is the great integrity,
p302
aVand he was right.
p303
aVAs they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk,
p304
aVthey give this entire pavilion its integrity.
p305
aVAnd over two to three weeks,
p306
aV6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers.
p307
aVIn a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the Silk Road.
p308
aVThe moths, after they hatch, produce 1.5 million eggs.
p309
aVThis could be used for 250 additional pavilions for the future.
p310
aa(lp311
VSo here they are, the two worldviews.
p312
aVOne spins silk out of a robotic arm,
p313
aVthe other fills in the gaps.
p314
aa(lp315
VIf the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products
p316
aVand the buildings around us,
p317
aVto form a two-material ecology,
p318
aVthen designers must unite these two worldviews.
p319
aVWhich brings us back, of course, to the beginning.
p320
aVHere's to a new age of design, a new age of creation,
p321
aVthat takes us from a nature-inspired design
p322
aVto a design-inspired nature,
p323
aVand that demands of us for the first time
p324
aVthat we mother nature.
p325
aa(lp326
VThank you.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
VThank you very much. Thank you.

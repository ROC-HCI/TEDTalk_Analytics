VThis is my first trip,
p5
aVmy first foreign trip as a first lady.
p6
aVCan you believe that?
p7
aV(Applause)
p8
aVAnd while this is not my first visit to the U.K.,
p9
aVI have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit.
p10
aVThe special relationship between the United States and the U.K.
p11
aVis based not only on the relationship between governments,
p12
aVbut the common language and the values that we share,
p13
aVand I'm reminded of that by watching you all today.
p14
aVDuring my visit I've been especially honored
p15
aVto meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women \u2014
p16
aVwomen who are paving the way for all of you.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd I'm honored to meet you,
p19
aVthe future leaders of Great Britain and this world.
p20
aVAnd although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant,
p21
aVwith me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America,
p22
aVand you, just getting through school,
p23
aVI want you to know that we have very much in common.
p24
aVFor nothing in my life's path
p25
aVwould have predicted that I'd be standing here
p26
aVas the first African-American First Lady
p27
aVof the United States of America.
p28
aVThere is nothing in my story that would land me here.
p29
aVI wasn't raised with wealth or resources
p30
aVor any social standing to speak of.
p31
aVI was raised on the South Side of Chicago.
p32
aVThat's the real part of Chicago.
p33
aVAnd I was the product of a working-class community.
p34
aVMy father was a city worker all of his life,
p35
aVand my mother was a stay-at-home mom.
p36
aVAnd she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.
p37
aVNeither of them attended university.
p38
aVMy dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
p39
aVin the prime of his life.
p40
aVBut even as it got harder for him to walk
p41
aVand get dressed in the morning \u2014
p42
aVI saw him struggle more and more \u2014
p43
aVmy father never complained about his struggle.
p44
aVHe was grateful for what he had.
p45
aVHe just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.
p46
aVAnd my brother and I were raised with all that you really need:
p47
aVlove, strong values
p48
aVand a belief that with a good education
p49
aVand a whole lot of hard work,
p50
aVthat there was nothing that we could not do.
p51
aa(lp52
VI am an example of what's possible
p53
aVwhen girls from the very beginning of their lives
p54
aVare loved and nurtured by the people around them.
p55
aVI was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life:
p56
aVgrandmothers, teachers, aunts, cousins, neighbors,
p57
aVwho taught me about quiet strength and dignity.
p58
aVAnd my mother, the most important role model in my life,
p59
aVwho lives with us at the White House
p60
aVand helps to care for our two little daughters,
p61
aVMalia and Sasha.
p62
aVShe's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine,
p63
aVand is instilling in them
p64
aVthe same values that she taught me and my brother:
p65
aVthings like compassion, and integrity,
p66
aVand confidence, and perseverance \u2014
p67
aVall of that wrapped up in an unconditional love
p68
aVthat only a grandmother can give.
p69
aa(lp70
VI was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged
p71
aVby some strong male role models as well,
p72
aVincluding my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers.
p73
aVThe men in my life taught me some important things, as well.
p74
aVThey taught me about what a respectful relationship
p75
aVshould look like between men and women.
p76
aVThey taught me about what a strong marriage feels like:
p77
aVthat it's built on faith and commitment
p78
aVand an admiration for each other's unique gifts.
p79
aVThey taught me about what it means
p80
aVto be a father
p81
aVand to raise a family.
p82
aVAnd not only to invest in your own home
p83
aVbut to reach out and help raise kids
p84
aVin the broader community.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd these were the same qualities
p87
aVthat I looked for in my own husband,
p88
aVBarack Obama.
p89
aVAnd when we first met,
p90
aVone of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date.
p91
aVAnd his date was to go with him to a community meeting.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVI know, how romantic.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aVBut when we met, Barack was a community organizer.
p96
aVHe worked, helping people to find jobs
p97
aVand to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.
p98
aVAs he talked to the residents in that community center,
p99
aVhe talked about two concepts.
p100
aVHe talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be."
p101
aVAnd I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.
p102
aVWhat he said, that all too often,
p103
aVis that we accept the distance between those two ideas.
p104
aVAnd sometimes we settle for the world as it is,
p105
aVeven when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.
p106
aVBut Barack reminded us on that day,
p107
aVall of us in that room, that we all know
p108
aVwhat our world should look like.
p109
aVWe know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.
p110
aVWe all know.
p111
aVAnd he urged the people in that meeting,
p112
aVin that community,
p113
aVto devote themselves to closing the gap
p114
aVbetween those two ideas,
p115
aVto work together to try to make the world as it is
p116
aVand the world as it should be, one and the same.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd I think about that today because I am
p119
aVreminded and convinced that all of you in this school
p120
aVare very important parts of closing that gap.
p121
aVYou are the women who will build the world as it should be.
p122
aVYou're going to write the next chapter in history.
p123
aVNot just for yourselves, but for your generation
p124
aVand generations to come.
p125
aVAnd that's why getting a good education
p126
aVis so important.
p127
aVThat's why all of this that you're going through \u2014
p128
aVthe ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't \u2014
p129
aVwhy it's so important.
p130
aVBecause communities and countries and ultimately the world
p131
aVare only as strong as the health of their women.
p132
aVAnd that's important to keep in mind.
p133
aa(lp134
VPart of that health includes an outstanding education.
p135
aVThe difference between a struggling family and a healthy one
p136
aVis often the presence of an empowered woman
p137
aVor women at the center of that family.
p138
aVThe difference between a broken community and a thriving one
p139
aVis often the healthy respect between men and women
p140
aVwho appreciate the contributions each other makes to society.
p141
aVThe difference between a languishing nation
p142
aVand one that will flourish
p143
aVis the recognition that we need equal access to education
p144
aVfor both boys and girls.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd this school, named after the U.K.'s first female doctor,
p147
aVand the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,
p148
aVMary Seacole,
p149
aVthe Jamaican nurse known as the "black Florence Nightingale,"
p150
aVand the English author, Emily Bronte,
p151
aVhonor women who fought sexism, racism and ignorance,
p152
aVto pursue their passions to feed their own souls.
p153
aVThey allowed for no obstacles.
p154
aVAs the sign said back there, "without limitations."
p155
aVThey knew no other way to live
p156
aVthan to follow their dreams.
p157
aVAnd having done so, these women
p158
aVmoved many obstacles.
p159
aVAnd they opened many new doors
p160
aVfor millions of female doctors and nurses
p161
aVand artists and authors,
p162
aVall of whom have followed them.
p163
aVAnd by getting a good education,
p164
aVyou too can control your own destiny.
p165
aa(lp166
VPlease remember that.
p167
aVIf you want to know the reason why I'm standing here,
p168
aVit's because of education.
p169
aVI never cut class. Sorry, I don't know if anybody is cutting class.
p170
aVI never did it.
p171
aVI loved getting As.
p172
aVI liked being smart.
p173
aVI liked being on time. I liked getting my work done.
p174
aVI thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world.
p175
aVAnd you too, with these same values,
p176
aVcan control your own destiny.
p177
aVYou too can pave the way.
p178
aVYou too can realize your dreams,
p179
aVand then your job is to reach back
p180
aVand to help someone just like you do the same thing.
p181
aVHistory proves that it doesn't matter
p182
aVwhether you come from a council estate
p183
aVor a country estate.
p184
aa(lp185
VYour success will be determined
p186
aVby your own fortitude,
p187
aVyour own confidence, your own individual hard work.
p188
aVThat is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in.
p189
aVYou now have control over your own destiny.
p190
aVAnd it won't be easy \u2014 that's for sure.
p191
aVBut you have everything you need.
p192
aVEverything you need to succeed,
p193
aVyou already have, right here.
p194
aa(lp195
VMy husband works in this big office.
p196
aVThey call it the Oval Office.
p197
aVIn the White House, there's the desk that he sits at \u2014
p198
aVit's called the Resolute desk.
p199
aVIt was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute
p200
aVand given by Queen Victoria.
p201
aVIt's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.
p202
aVAnd its name, Resolute,
p203
aVis a reminder of the strength of character that's required
p204
aVnot only to lead a country,
p205
aVbut to live a life of purpose, as well.
p206
aVAnd I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute,
p207
aVthat you go forward without limits,
p208
aVand that you use your talents \u2014 because there are many; we've seen them;
p209
aVit's there \u2014
p210
aVthat you use them to create the world as it should be.
p211
aVBecause we are counting on you.
p212
aVWe are counting on every single one of you
p213
aVto be the very best that you can be.
p214
aVBecause the world is big.
p215
aVAnd it's full of challenges.
p216
aVAnd we need strong, smart, confident young women
p217
aVto stand up and take the reins.
p218
aa(lp219
VWe know you can do it. We love you. Thank you so much.

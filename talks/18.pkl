VIt is a thrill to be here at a conference
p5
aVthat's devoted to "Inspired by Nature" \u2014 you can imagine.
p6
aVAnd I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section.
p7
aVDid you notice this section is foreplay?
p8
aVBecause I get to talk about one of my favorite critters,
p9
aVwhich is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived
p10
aVuntil you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.
p11
aVI was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park,
p12
aVwhich is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it,
p13
aVand my partner and I have a rowing shell.
p14
aVAnd so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along.
p15
aVAnd what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together,
p16
aVthe two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater.
p17
aVThey paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast
p18
aVthat they literally lift up out of the water,
p19
aVand they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water.
p20
aVAnd one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing.
p21
aVAnd so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.
p22
aVAnd this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect,
p23
aVand started to run along the water next to us,
p24
aVin a courtship dance \u2014 for miles.
p25
aVIt would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.
p26
aVNow that is foreplay.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VI came this close to changing species at that moment.
p30
aVObviously, life can teach us something
p31
aVin the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us.
p32
aVBut what I'd like to talk about today
p33
aVis what life might teach us in technology and in design.
p34
aVWhat's happened since the book came out \u2014
p35
aVthe book was mainly about research in biomimicry \u2014
p36
aVand what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers \u2014
p37
aVpeople who make our world \u2014 have started to call and say,
p38
aVwe want a biologist to sit at the design table
p39
aVto help us, in real time, become inspired.
p40
aVOr \u2014 and this is the fun part for me \u2014 we want you to take us out
p41
aVinto the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge
p42
aVand we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took
p45
aVwith some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.
p46
aVAnd some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there.
p47
aVWhat they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry.
p48
aVWe use bacteria to clean our water. And we said,
p49
aVwell, that's not exactly being inspired by nature.
p50
aVThat's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology:
p51
aVusing an organism to do your wastewater treatment
p52
aVis an old, old technology called "domestication."
p53
aVThis is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it.
p54
aVAnd so they still weren't getting it.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo we went for a walk on the beach and I said,
p57
aVwell, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge,
p58
aVsustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable.
p59
aVAnd they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.
p60
aVAnd they said, you know what happens is, mineral \u2014
p61
aVjust like at your house \u2014 mineral builds up.
p62
aVAnd then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins,
p63
aVor we have to dig them up.
p64
aVSo if we had some way to stop this scaling \u2014
p65
aVand so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them,
p66
aVwhat is scaling? What's inside your pipes?
p67
aVAnd they said, calcium carbonate.
p68
aVAnd I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd they didn't know that.
p71
aVThey didn't know that what a seashell is,
p72
aVit's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater
p73
aVcrystallize in place to create a shell.
p74
aVSo the same sort of a process, without the proteins,
p75
aVis happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know.
p76
aVThis is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.
p77
aVYou know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know
p78
aVthat the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it
p79
aVand said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization
p80
aVthat happens automatically out of seawater \u2014 self-assembly \u2014
p81
aVthen why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling?
p82
aVWhy don't they just keep on going?
p83
aVAnd I said, well, in the same way
p84
aVthat they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization \u2014
p85
aVand then they all sort of leaned in \u2014
p86
aVthey let go of a protein that stops the crystallization.
p87
aVIt literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal.
p88
aVAnd, in fact, there is a product called TPA
p89
aVthat's mimicked that protein \u2014 that stop-protein \u2014
p90
aVand it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes.
p91
aa(lp92
VThat changed everything. From then on,
p93
aVyou could not get these engineers back in the boat.
p94
aVThe first day they would take a hike,
p95
aVand it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat.
p96
aVWe're done. You know, I've seen that island.
p97
aVAfter this,
p98
aVthey were crawling all over. They would snorkel
p99
aVfor as long as we would let them snorkel.
p100
aVWhat had happened was that they realized that there were organisms
p101
aVout there that had already solved the problems
p102
aVthat they had spent their careers trying to solve.
p103
aa(lp104
VLearning about the natural world is one thing;
p105
aVlearning from the natural world \u2014 that's the switch.
p106
aVThat's the profound switch.
p107
aVWhat they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere;
p108
aVthey just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.
p109
aV3.8 billion years of field-testing.
p110
aV10 to 30 \u2014 Craig Venter will probably tell you;
p111
aVI think there's a lot more than 30 million \u2014 well-adapted solutions.
p112
aVThe important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context.
p113
aVAnd the context is the Earth \u2014
p114
aVthe same context that we're trying to solve our problems in.
p115
aVSo it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.
p116
aVIt's not slavishly mimicking \u2014
p117
aValthough Al is trying to get the hairdo going \u2014
p118
aVit's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles,
p119
aVthe genius of the natural world, and learning something from it.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what
p122
aVI'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field
p123
aVis one that has learned an enormous amount from living things,
p124
aVon the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves,
p125
aVlike an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation
p126
aVand biological development. And we're learning from neural nets,
p127
aVgenetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.
p128
aVThat's on the software side. But what's interesting to me
p129
aVis that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines
p130
aVare really not very high tech in my estimation
p131
aVin the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens
p132
aVin the water in Silicon Valley.
p133
aVSo the hardware
p134
aVis not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success.
p135
aVSo what can we learn about making \u2014 not just computers, but everything?
p136
aVThe plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on.
p137
aVHow do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world?
p138
aVMore importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?
p139
aVAnd there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.
p140
aa(lp141
VWhat's the syllabus?
p142
aVThree questions, for me, are key.
p143
aVHow does life make things?
p144
aVThis is the opposite; this is how we make things.
p145
aVIt's called heat, beat and treat \u2014
p146
aVthat's what material scientists call it.
p147
aVAnd it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over
p148
aVand only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures;
p149
aVyou use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat.
p150
aa(lp151
VLife can't afford to do that. How does life make things?
p152
aVHow does life make the most of things?
p153
aVThat's a geranium pollen.
p154
aVAnd its shape is what gives it the function of being able
p155
aVto tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape.
p156
aVLife adds information to matter.
p157
aVIn other words: structure.
p158
aVIt gives it information. By adding information to matter,
p159
aVit gives it a function that's different than without that structure.
p160
aVAnd thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems?
p161
aVBecause life doesn't really deal in things;
p162
aVthere are no things in the natural world divorced
p163
aVfrom their systems.
p164
aVReally quick syllabus.
p165
aVAs I'm reading more and more now, and following the story,
p166
aVthere are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences.
p167
aVAnd at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses
p168
aVand finding what their sort of grand challenges are.
p169
aVThe two groups are not talking to each other.
p170
aVAt all.
p171
aa(lp172
VWhat in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture,
p173
aVto get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in?
p174
aVI'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.
p175
aa(lp176
VOne that's exciting to me is self-assembly.
p177
aVNow, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology.
p178
aVBack to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material.
p179
aVOn the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl
p180
aVforming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral
p181
aVand then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.
p182
aVIt's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics.
p183
aVBut what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns,
p184
aVit happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body.
p185
aVThis is Sandia National Labs.
p186
aVA guy named Jeff Brinker
p187
aVhas found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.
p188
aVImagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature
p189
aVby simply dipping something into a liquid,
p190
aVlifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation
p191
aVforce the molecules in the liquid together,
p192
aVso that they jigsaw together
p193
aVin the same way as this crystallization works.
p194
aVImagine making all of our hard materials that way.
p195
aVImagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell,
p196
aVonto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light.
p197
aa(lp198
VHere's an interesting one for the IT world:
p199
aVbio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates.
p200
aVAnd so silicon, which we make right now \u2014
p201
aVit's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips \u2014
p202
aVthis is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked.
p203
aVThis is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms.
p204
aVThis is from Ernst Haeckel's work.
p205
aVImagine being able to \u2014 and, again, it's a templated process,
p206
aVand it solidifies out of a liquid process \u2014 imagine being able to have that
p207
aVsort of structure coming out at room temperature.
p208
aVImagine being able to make perfect lenses.
p209
aVOn the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses
p210
aVthat the people at Lucent Technologies have found
p211
aVhave no distortion whatsoever.
p212
aVIt's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of.
p213
aVAnd there's many of them, all over its entire body.
p214
aVWhat's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles.
p215
aVA woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent,
p216
aVis now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create
p217
aVthese sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics.
p218
aVThat's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic.
p219
aVDown at the very base of it, there's fiber optics
p220
aVthat work better than ours, actually, to move light,
p221
aVbut you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.
p222
aa(lp223
VHere's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock.
p224
aVA guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself,
p225
aVyou know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time.
p226
aVWe see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains
p227
aVof starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way \u2014
p228
aVhe's found a catalyst \u2014 and he's found a way to take CO2
p229
aVand make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics
p230
aVout of CO2 \u2014 how plant-like.
p231
aa(lp232
VSolar transformations: the most exciting one.
p233
aVThere are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device
p234
aVinside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting,
p235
aVlately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen
p236
aVthat there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve
p237
aVhydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up \u2014
p238
aVbasically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell
p239
aVand in a reversible fuel cell.
p240
aVIn our fuel cells, we do it with platinum;
p241
aVlife does it with a very, very common iron.
p242
aVAnd a team has now just been able to mimic
p243
aVthat hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase.
p244
aVThat's very exciting for fuel cells \u2014
p245
aVto be able to do that without platinum.
p246
aa(lp247
VPower of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale
p248
aVhave tubercles on them. And those little bumps
p249
aVactually increase efficiency in, for instance,
p250
aVthe edge of an airplane \u2014 increase efficiency by about 32 percent.
p251
aVWhich is an amazing fossil fuel savings,
p252
aVif we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.
p253
aVColor without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape.
p254
aVLight comes through, it bounces back off the layers;
p255
aVit's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able
p256
aVto self-assemble products with the last few layers
p257
aVplaying with light to create color.
p258
aVImagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface,
p259
aVso that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does.
p260
aVSee that up-close picture?
p261
aVThat's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles.
p262
aVAnd that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.
p263
aVThere's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics \u2014
p264
aVwhen the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps
p265
aVin a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building.
p266
aa(lp267
VWater is going to be our big, grand challenge:
p268
aVquenching thirst.
p269
aVHere are two organisms that pull water.
p270
aVThe one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.
p271
aVThe one on the right is a pill bug \u2014 pulls water out of air,
p272
aVdoes not drink fresh water.
p273
aVPulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta,
p274
aVbefore it gets into a building, are key technologies.
p275
aa(lp276
VSeparation technologies are going to be extremely important.
p277
aVWhat if we were to say, no more hard rock mining?
p278
aVWhat if we were to separate out metals from waste streams,
p279
aVsmall amounts of metals in water? That's what microbes do;
p280
aVthey chelate metals out of water.
p281
aVThere's a company here in San Francisco called MR3
p282
aVthat is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters
p283
aVto mine waste streams.
p284
aVGreen chemistry is chemistry in water.
p285
aVWe do chemistry in organic solvents.
p286
aVThis is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider
p287
aVand the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful?
p288
aVGreen chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book.
p289
aVIt's not easy, because life uses
p290
aVonly a subset of the elements in the periodic table.
p291
aVAnd we use all of them, even the toxic ones.
p292
aVTo figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset
p293
aVof the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell,
p294
aVis the task of green chemistry.
p295
aa(lp296
VTimed degradation: packaging that is good
p297
aVuntil you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue.
p298
aVThat's a mussel you can find in the waters out here,
p299
aVand the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years,
p300
aVthey begin to dissolve.
p301
aa(lp302
VHealing: this is a good one.
p303
aVThat little guy over there is a tardigrade.
p304
aVThere is a problem with vaccines around the world
p305
aVnot getting to patients. And the reason is
p306
aVthat the refrigeration somehow gets broken;
p307
aVwhat's called the "cold chain" gets broken.
p308
aVA guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade \u2014
p309
aVwhich dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months
p310
aVand months and months, and is able to regenerate itself.
p311
aVAnd he found a way to dry out vaccines \u2014
p312
aVencase them in the same sort of sugar capsules
p313
aVas the tardigrade has within its cells \u2014
p314
aVmeaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated.
p315
aVThey can be put in a glove compartment, OK.
p316
aVLearning from organisms. This is a session about water \u2014
p317
aVlearning about organisms that can do without water,
p318
aVin order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration.
p319
aa(lp320
VI'm not going to get to 12.
p321
aVBut what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing,
p322
aVbesides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms
p323
aVhave figured out a way to do the amazing things they do
p324
aVwhile taking care of the place
p325
aVthat's going to take care of their offspring.
p326
aVWhen they're involved in foreplay,
p327
aVthey're thinking about something very, very important \u2014
p328
aVand that's having their genetic material
p329
aVremain, 10,000 generations from now.
p330
aVAnd that means finding a way to do what they do
p331
aVwithout destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring.
p332
aVThat's the biggest design challenge.
p333
aVLuckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses
p334
aVwilling to gift us with their best ideas.
p335
aVGood luck having a conversation with them.
p336
aa(lp337
VThank you.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Applause)
p340
aa(lp341
VChris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I \u2014 we need to get to 12, but really quickly.
p342
aa(lp343
VJanine Benyus: Oh really?
p344
aVCA: Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version
p345
aVof 10, 11 and 12. Because we just \u2014 your slides are so gorgeous,
p346
aVand the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down
p347
aVwithout seeing 10, 11 and 12.
p348
aa(lp349
VJB: OK, put this \u2014 OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great.
p350
aVOK, so that's the healing one.
p351
aVSensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing.
p352
aVThis is a locust. There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer,
p353
aVand yet they don't collide with one another.
p354
aVAnd yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aVRight. There's a person at Newcastle
p357
aVwho has figured out that it's a very large neuron.
p358
aVAnd she's actually figuring out how to make
p359
aVa collision-avoidance circuitry
p360
aVbased on this very large neuron in the locust.
p361
aa(lp362
VThis is a huge and important one, number 11.
p363
aVAnd that's the growing fertility.
p364
aVThat means, you know, net fertility farming.
p365
aVWe should be growing fertility. And, oh yes \u2014 we get food, too.
p366
aVBecause we have to grow the capacity of this planet
p367
aVto create more and more opportunities for life.
p368
aVAnd really, that's what other organisms do as well.
p369
aVIn ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do:
p370
aVthey create more and more opportunities for life.
p371
aVOur farming has done the opposite.
p372
aVSo, farming based on how a prairie builds soil,
p373
aVranching based on how a native ungulate herd
p374
aVactually increases the health of the range,
p375
aVeven wastewater treatment based on how a marsh
p376
aVnot only cleans the water,
p377
aVbut creates incredibly sparkling productivity.
p378
aa(lp379
VThis is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple
p380
aVbecause the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out.
p381
aVThat is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out
p382
aVhow to enhance or sweeten their places,
p383
aVare not around to tell us about it.
p384
aVThat's the twelfth one.
p385
aVLife \u2014 and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick \u2014
p386
aVlife creates conditions conducive to life.
p387
aVIt builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water;
p388
aVit mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live.
p389
aVAnd it does that in the middle of having great foreplay
p390
aVand meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive.
p391
aVWe have to find a way to meet our needs,
p392
aVwhile making of this place an Eden.

VSo I understand that this meeting was planned,
p5
aVand the slogan was From Was to Still.
p6
aVAnd I am illustrating Still.
p7
aVWhich, of course, I am not agreeing with because,
p8
aValthough I am 94, I am not still working.
p9
aVAnd anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?"
p10
aVI don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.
p11
aVI still have \u2014 or did I use the word still? I didn't mean that.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VI have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans.
p16
aVI have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did.
p17
aVSo this takes care of my age.
p18
aVI want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.
p19
aVThis was about 1925.
p20
aVAll of these things were made during the last 75 years.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
V(Applause)
p25
aa(lp26
VBut, of course, I'm working since 25,
p27
aVdoing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China.
p28
aVThis was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.
p29
aVThis is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.
p30
aVThis is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.
p31
aVThis is a portrait of my daughter and myself.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Applause)
p34
aa(lp35
VThese were just some of the things I've made.
p36
aVI made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.
p37
aVI call myself a maker of things.
p38
aVI don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.
p39
aVIndustrial designers want to make novel things.
p40
aVNovelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.
p41
aVThe industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation."
p42
aVInnovation is not part of the aim of my work.
p43
aVWell, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant,
p44
aVmore comfortable than just the craftsmen do.
p45
aVI have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say.
p46
aVWell, to describe our profession otherwise,
p47
aVwe are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.
p48
aVThat means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man.
p49
aVSarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote,
p50
aV"The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity \u2014
p51
aVthat all useful qualities and all material qualities
p52
aVwere developed from the playful search for beauty."
p53
aVThese are tiles. The word, "playful" is a necessary aspect of our work
p54
aVbecause, actually, one of our problems is that we have to make,
p55
aVproduce, lovely things throughout all of life, and this for me is now 75 years.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo how can you, without drying up,
p58
aVmake things with the same pleasure, as a gift to others, for so long?
p59
aVThe playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer.
p60
aVLet me tell you some about my life.
p61
aVAs I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.
p62
aVMy first exhibition in the United States
p63
aVwas at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 \u2014
p64
aVthat the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.
p65
aVMy work actually took me through many countries,
p66
aVand showed me a great part of the world.
p67
aVThis is not that they took me \u2014 the work didn't take me \u2014
p68
aVI made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.
p69
aVI was incredibly curious to see the world, and I made all these things,
p70
aVwhich then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.
p71
aVI started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman,
p72
aVand this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe guild system: that means when I was an apprentice,
p75
aVI had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.
p76
aVIn my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy
p77
aVof master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice,
p78
aVand I worked as the apprentice.
p79
aVThe work as an apprentice was very primitive.
p80
aVThat means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.
p81
aVWe mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
p82
aVAfter that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.
p83
aVAnd then finally it was prepared for the throwing.
p84
aVAnd there I really worked as an apprentice.
p85
aVMy master took me to set ovens
p86
aVbecause this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time.
p87
aVAnd finally, I had received a document
p88
aVthat I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully,
p89
aVthat I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me
p90
aVby the Guild of Roof-Coverers, Rail-Diggers, Oven-Setters,
p91
aVChimney Sweeps and Potters.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VI also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights
p96
aVand my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.
p97
aVFirst I set up a shop in my own garden,
p98
aVand made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.
p99
aVAnd there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend \u2014
p100
aVI didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today \u2014
p101
aVbut my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.
p102
aVMy mother thought that this was not very proper,
p103
aVso she sat with us to add propriety to this activity.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VHowever, after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest,
p108
aVa pottery factory, a large one.
p109
aVAnd I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.
p110
aVThen the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?
p111
aVI said, I also have a pottery.
p112
aVSo he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did,
p113
aVand explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism,
p114
aVthat the industrial revolution had broken out,
p115
aVand that I rather should join the factory.
p116
aVThere he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.
p117
aVHowever, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.
p118
aVThe director there said there were several women casting
p119
aVand producing my designs now in molds, and this was sold also to America.
p120
aa(lp121
VI remember that it was quite successful.
p122
aVHowever, the director, the chemist, model maker \u2014 everybody \u2014
p123
aVconcerned himself much more with the art department \u2014
p124
aVthat means, with my work \u2014 than making toilets,
p125
aVso finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory,
p126
aVsaying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end.
p127
aVSo this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman,
p128
aVand journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world.
p129
aVSo as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied,
p130
aVthat I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman
p131
aVand I was looking for a job as a journeyman.
p132
aVAnd I got several answers, and I accepted the one
p133
aVwhich was farthest from home and practically, I thought, halfway to America.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd that was in Hamburg.
p136
aVThen I first took this job in Hamburg, at an art pottery
p137
aVwhere everything was done on the wheel,
p138
aVand so I worked in a shop where there were several potters.
p139
aVAnd the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable \u2014
p140
aVthere were three or four turntables \u2014 and one of them, behind where I was sitting,
p141
aVwas a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.
p142
aVSo I doused him in cologne every day, which he thought was very nice,
p143
aVand therefore he brought bread and butter every day,
p144
aVwhich I had to eat out of courtesy.
p145
aVThe first day I came to work in this shop
p146
aVthere was on my wheel a surprise for me.
p147
aVMy colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work
p148
aVa very nicely modeled natural man's organs.
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVAfter I brushed them off with a hand motion, they were very \u2014
p151
aVI finally was now accepted, and worked there for some six months.
p152
aVThis was my first job.
p153
aVIf I go on like this, you will be here till midnight.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
VSo I will try speed it up a little
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VModerator: Eva, we have about five minutes.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VEva Zeisel: Are you sure?
p168
aa(lp169
VModerator: Yes, I am sure.
p170
aa(lp171
VEZ: Well, if you are sure,
p172
aVI have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.
p173
aVAnd actually, my work took me to many countries
p174
aVbecause I used my work to fill my curiosity.
p175
aVAnd among other things, other countries I worked, was in the Soviet Union,
p176
aVwhere I worked from '32 to '37 \u2014 actually, to '36.
p177
aVI was finally there, although I had nothing to do \u2014 I was a foreign expert.
p178
aVI became art director of the china and glass industry,
p179
aVand eventually under Stalin's purges \u2014 at the beginning of Stalin's purges,
p180
aVI didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.
p181
aVSo I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges,
p182
aVand spent 16 months in a Russian prison.
p183
aVThe accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.
p184
aVThis was a very dangerous accusation.
p185
aVAnd if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that
p186
aVI actually did survive, which was a surprise.
p187
aVBut since I survived and I'm here,
p188
aVand since this is the end of the five minutes, I will \u2014
p189
aa(lp190
VModerator: Tell me when your last trip to Russia was.
p191
aVWeren't you there recently?
p192
aa(lp193
VEZ: Oh, this summer, in fact,
p194
aVthe Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me.
p195
aVThey found out that I had worked in '33 at this factory,
p196
aVand they came to my studio in Rockland County,
p197
aVand brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here.
p198
aVAnd they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer,
p199
aVin July, to make some dishes, design some dishes.
p200
aVAnd since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter,
p201
aVson-in-law and granddaughter,
p202
aVso we had a lovely trip to see Russia today,
p203
aVwhich is not a very pleasant and happy view.
p204
aVHere I am now, if this is the end? Thank you.

Her long and legendary career in ceramics helped her do both. Born in Budapest in 1906, she apprenticed to a guild of potters as a teenager, then worked in Germany and later Russia (where she was imprisoned by Stalin for 16 months) and Vienna. Landing in New York in 1938 with her husband Hans, Zeisel began her second design career.</p><p>In the American postwar period, Zeisel&#39;s work simply defined the era. Organic shapes, toned colors, a sense of fun and play -- her Town and Country line for Red Wing in particular evokes an urbane early-1950s kitchen where you&#39;d be likely to get an excellent cup of coffee and some good conversation.</p><p>Zeisel took a break from design in the 1960s and 1970s, returning to the scene in the 1980s as interest in her older work revived.

"whylisten": "<p>Young Eva Zeisel was driven by two desires: to make beautiful things, and to see the world. Her long and legendary career in ceramics helped her do both. Born in Budapest in 1906, she apprenticed to a guild of potters as a teenager, then worked in Germany and later Russia (where she was imprisoned by Stalin for 16 months) and Vienna. Landing in New York in 1938 with her husband Hans, Zeisel began her second design career.</p><p>In the American postwar period, Zeisel&#39;s work simply defined the era. Organic shapes, toned colors, a sense of fun and play -- her Town and Country line for Red Wing in particular evokes an urbane early-1950s kitchen where you&#39;d be likely to get an excellent cup of coffee and some good conversation.</p><p>Zeisel took a break from design in the 1960s and 1970s, returning to the scene in the 1980s as interest in her older work revived. But as she collected lifetime achievement awards and saw centenary exhibitions open and close, she didn&#39;t simply rehash her older work for the repro crowd -- instead branching out into <a href=\\"http://evazeiseloriginals.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">glassware and furniture</a>.

VGood afternoon, I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow.
p5
aVI'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon
p6
aVwhich can, and actually is changing the world,
p7
aVand whose name is people power.
p8
aVI'll start with an anecdote,
p9
aVor for those of you who are Monty Python lovers,
p10
aVa Monty Python type of sketch.
p11
aVHere it is.
p12
aa(lp13
VIt is December 15, 2010.
p14
aVSomebody gives you a bet: you will look at a crystal ball,
p15
aVand you will see the future; the future will be accurate.
p16
aVBut you need to share it with the world.
p17
aVOK, curiosity killed the cat, you take the bet,
p18
aVyou look at the crystal ball.
p19
aVOne hour later, you're sitting in a building of the national TV,
p20
aVin a top show, and you tell the story.
p21
aVBefore the end of 2011,
p22
aVBen Ali, and Mubarak, and Gaddafi would be down,
p23
aVand prosecuted.
p24
aVSaleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria
p25
aVwould be either challenged, or already on their knees.
p26
aVOsama bin Laden would be dead,
p27
aVand Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face.
p30
aVAnd then, on top of it you add:
p31
aV"And thousands of young people from Athens, Madrid and New York
p32
aVwill demonstrate for social justice, claiming they are inspired by Arabs."
p33
aa(lp34
VNext thing you know, two guys in white appear,
p35
aVthey give you the strange t-shirt,
p36
aVtake you to the nearest mental institution.
p37
aVSo I would like to speak a little bit
p38
aVabout the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be
p39
aVa very bad year for bad guys.
p40
aVAnd this phenomenon is called people power.
p41
aa(lp42
VWell, people power has been there for a while.
p43
aVIt helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India,
p44
aVit helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle.
p45
aVIt helped a local, Lech Walesa,
p46
aVto kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland,
p47
aVand in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo what's new in it?
p50
aVWhat seems to be very new,
p51
aVwhich is the idea I would like to share with you today,
p52
aVis that there is a set of rules and skills
p53
aVwhich can be learned and taught
p54
aVin order to perform successful nonviolent struggle.
p55
aVIf this is true, we can help these movements.
p56
aa(lp57
VWell, the first one - analytic skills.
p58
aVI'll try where it all started in the Middle East.
p59
aVAnd for so many years,
p60
aVwe were living with a completely wrong perception of the Middle East.
p61
aVIt was looking like the frozen region.
p62
aVLiterally a refrigerator.
p63
aVAnd there were only two types of meal there.
p64
aVSteak, which stands for a Mubarak-Ben Ali type of military police dictatorship,
p65
aVor a potato, which stands for a Tehran type of theocracies.
p66
aVAnd everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened,
p67
aVand millions of young, mainly secular people
p68
aVstepped out to do the change.
p69
aVGuess what - they didn't watch the demographics.
p70
aVWhat is the average age of an Egyptian? 24.
p71
aVHow long was Mubarak in power? 31.
p72
aVSo, this system was just obsolete, they expired.
p73
aVAnd young people of the Arab world have awakened one morning,
p74
aVand understood that power lies in their hands.
p75
aVThe rest is the year in front of us.
p76
aVAnd guess what? The same Generation Y,
p77
aVwith their rules, with their tools, with their games,
p78
aVand with their language, which sounds a little bit strange to me.
p79
aVI'm 38 now.
p80
aVAnd can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe?
p81
aVIt seems that Generation Y is coming.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, let me set another example.
p84
aVI'm meeting different people throughout the world,
p85
aVand they are, you know, academics, and professors, and doctors,
p86
aVand they will always talk conditions.
p87
aVThey will say: "People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive."
p88
aVThey will say: "People power will work,
p89
aVif the annual income of the country is between X and Z."
p90
aVThey will say: "People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure."
p91
aVThey will say: "People power will work only if there is no oil."
p92
aVAnd, I mean, there is a set of conditions.
p93
aVWell, the news here is that your skills during the conflict
p94
aVseem to be more important than the conditions.
p95
aVNamely, the skills of unity, planning, and maintaining nonviolent discipline.
p96
aa(lp97
VLet me give you an example.
p98
aVI come from a country called Serbia.
p99
aVIt took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders,
p100
aVwith their big egos, behind one single candidate
p101
aVagainst the Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic.
p102
aVGuess what? That was the day of his defeat.
p103
aVYou look at the Egyptians, they fight on Tahrir Square,
p104
aVthey get rid of their individual symbols,
p105
aVthey appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt.
p106
aVI will give you a counter-example.
p107
aVYou see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko,
p108
aVyou all know the outcome.
p109
aVSo unity is a big thing.
p110
aVAnd this can be achieved.
p111
aVSame with planning.
p112
aVSomebody has lied to you
p113
aVabout the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution.
p114
aVThat thing doesn't exist in the world.
p115
aVWhenever you see young people in front of the row
p116
aVtrying to fraternize with the police or military,
p117
aVsomebody was thinking about it before.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, at the end, nonviolent discipline.
p120
aVAnd this is probably the game-changer.
p121
aVIf you maintain nonviolent discipline,
p122
aVyou'll exclusively win.
p123
aVYou have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march,
p124
aVone idiot or agent-provocateur throwing a stone.
p125
aVGuess what takes all the cameras.
p126
aVThat one guy.
p127
aVOne single act of violence can literally destroy your movement.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, let me move to another place.
p130
aVIt's the selection of strategies and tactics.
p131
aVThere are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow.
p132
aVFirst, you start small.
p133
aVSecond, you pick the battles you can win.
p134
aVIt's only 200 of us in this room.
p135
aVWe won't call for the march of a million.
p136
aVBut what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night,
p137
aVall over Krakow.
p138
aVThe city will know.
p139
aVSo, we pick tactics accommodated to the event,
p140
aVespecially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion.
p141
aVThey're very useful in violent oppression.
p142
aVWe are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used.
p143
aVIt was on Tahrir square,
p144
aVwhere the international community was constantly frightened
p145
aVthat, you know, the Islamists will overtake the revolution.
p146
aVWhat they organized \u2014
p147
aVChristians protecting Muslims where they are praying,
p148
aVa Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims,
p149
aVthe world has just changed the picture,
p150
aVbut somebody was thinking about this previously.
p151
aVSo there are so many things you can do
p152
aVinstead of getting into one place,
p153
aVshouting, and you know, showing off in front of the security forces.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, there is also another very important dynamic.
p156
aVAnd this is a dynamic that analysts normally don't see.
p157
aVThis is the dynamic between fear and apathy on the one side,
p158
aVand enthusiasm and humor on another side.
p159
aVSo, it works like in a video game.
p160
aVYou have the fear high, you have status quo.
p161
aVYou have the enthusiasm higher,
p162
aVyou see the fear is starting to melt.
p163
aVDay two, you see people running towards the police
p164
aVinstead of from the police, in Egypt.
p165
aVYou can tell that something is happening there.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd then, it's about the humor.
p168
aVHumor is such a powerful game-changer,
p169
aVand of course, it was very big in Poland.
p170
aVYou know, we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia
p171
aVwhen we made this big skit.
p172
aVWe put the big petrol barrel
p173
aVwith a portrait of Mr. President on it, in the middle of the Main Street.
p174
aVThere was a hole in the top.
p175
aVSo you could literally come, put a coin in,
p176
aVget a baseball bat, and hit his face.
p177
aVSounds loud.
p178
aVAnd within minutes,
p179
aVwe were sitting in a nearby café having coffee,
p180
aVand there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing.
p181
aVWell, that's just the beginning of the show.
p182
aVThe real show starts when the police appears.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
V"What will they do?"
p187
aVArrest us? We were nowhere to be seen.
p188
aVWe were like three blocks away, observing it from our espresso bar.
p189
aVArrest the shoppers, with kids?
p190
aVDoesn't make sense.
p191
aVOf course, you could bet, they did the most stupid thing.
p192
aVThey arrested the barrel.
p193
aVAnd now, the picture of the smashed face on the barrel,
p194
aVwith the policemen dragging it to the police car,
p195
aVthat was the best day for newspaper photographers
p196
aVthat they will ever have.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo, I mean, these are the things you can do.
p199
aVAnd you can always use humor.
p200
aVThere is also one big thing about humor,
p201
aVit really hurts.
p202
aVBecause these guys really are taking themselves too seriously.
p203
aVWhen you start to mock them, it hurts.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow, everybody is talking about His Majesty, the Internet,
p206
aVand it is also a very useful skill.
p207
aVBut don't rush to label things like "a Facebook Revolution,"
p208
aV"Twitter Revolution."
p209
aVDon't mix the tools with the substance.
p210
aVIt is true that the Internet and the new media are very useful
p211
aVin making things faster and cheaper.
p212
aVThey also make it a bit safer for the participants,
p213
aVbecause they give partial anonymity.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe're watching the great example of something else the Internet can do.
p216
aVIt can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence
p217
aVover a nonviolent protester.
p218
aVThis is the famous group "We are all Khaled Said,"
p219
aVmade by Wael Ghonim in Egypt, and his friend.
p220
aVThis is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police.
p221
aVThis is how he became known to the public,
p222
aVand this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel's back.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut here is also the bad news.
p225
aVThe nonviolent struggle is won in the real world, in the streets.
p226
aVYou will never change your society towards democracy,
p227
aVor, you know, the economy, if you sit down and click.
p228
aVThere are risks to be taken,
p229
aVand there are living people who are winning the struggle.
p230
aa(lp231
VWell, the million-dollar question.
p232
aVWhat will happen in the Arab world?
p233
aVAnd though young people from the Arab world
p234
aVwere pretty successful in bringing down three dictators,
p235
aVshaking the region,
p236
aVkind of persuading the clever kings from Jordan and Morocco
p237
aVto do substantial reforms,
p238
aVit is yet to be seen what will be the outcome.
p239
aVWhether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition,
p240
aVor this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflicts,
p241
aVwhether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline,
p242
aVfaced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already,
p243
aVor they will slip into violent struggle
p244
aVand make ugly civil war.
p245
aVWill these revolutions be pushed through the transitions and democracy
p246
aVor be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds?
p247
aVWe cannot tell.
p248
aVThe same works for the Western sector,
p249
aVwhere you can see all these excited young people
p250
aVprotesting around the world, occupying this, occupying that.
p251
aVAre they going to become the world wave?
p252
aVAre they going to find their skills, their enthusiasm, and their strategy
p253
aVto find what they really want and push for the reform,
p254
aVor will they just stay complaining about the endless list
p255
aVof the things they hate?
p256
aVThis is the difference between the two paths.
p257
aa(lp258
VNow, what do the statistics have?
p259
aVMy friend Maria Stephan's book
p260
aVtalks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle,
p261
aVand there are some shocking data.
p262
aVIf you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions,
p263
aVfrom dictatorship to democracy,
p264
aVyou will see that, out of 67 different cases,
p265
aVin 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle
p266
aVwhich was the key power.
p267
aVThis is one more reason to look at this phenomenon,
p268
aVthis is one more reason to look at Generation Y.
p269
aVEnough for me to give them credit,
p270
aVand hope that they will find their skills and their courage
p271
aVto use nonviolent struggle
p272
aVand thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world.
p273
aa(lp274
VThank you.

Otpor!&rsquo;s campaign to unseat  Serbian president Slobodan Milosovic found  success in October 2000 when  hundreds of thousands of protestors converged  upon and took over the  Serbian Parliament, effectively ending Milosevic&rsquo;s  rule. After the  revolution, Popovic served a term as a member of the  Serbian National  Assembly 2000-2003.</p> <p>In 2003, Popovic and other ex-Otpor!  activists started the  nonprofit educational institution the Centre  for Applied Nonviolent  Action and Strategies (CANVAS) (<a href=\\"http://www.canvasopedia.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">www.canvasopedia.org</a>).   CANVAS has worked with people from 37 countries, including   Zimbabwe, Burma, Iran and Venezuela, spreading knowledge on  nonviolent  strategies and tactics that was used by the Serbian  pro-democracy movement  to other non-democratic countries. CANVAS has  worked with the activists  responsible for successful movements such as  the Georgian &ldquo;Rose Revolution&rdquo;  of 2003 and the Ukrainian &ldquo;Orange  Revolution&rdquo; of 2004-2005. It also  transferred knowledge to Lebanese  activists in 2004 to address the crisis  after the assassination of  Prime Minister Harriri, and assisted participants  in the Maldives&rsquo;  revolution in 2008.

founders  and key organizers of the  Serbian nonviolent resistance group Otpor!  Otpor!&rsquo;s campaign to unseat  Serbian president Slobodan Milosovic found  success in October 2000 when  hundreds of thousands of protestors converged  upon and took over the  Serbian Parliament, effectively ending Milosevic&rsquo;s  rule. After the  revolution, Popovic served a term as a member of the  Serbian National  Assembly 2000-2003.</p> <p>In 2003, Popovic and other ex-Otpor!  activists started the  nonprofit educational institution the Centre  for Applied Nonviolent  Action and Strategies (CANVAS) (<a href=\\"http://www.canvasopedia.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">www.canvasopedia.org</a>).   CANVAS has worked with people from 37 countries, including   Zimbabwe, Burma, Iran and Venezuela, spreading knowledge on  nonviolent  strategies and tactics that was used by the Serbian  pro-democracy movement  to other non-democratic countries. CANVAS has  worked with the activists  responsible for successful movements such as  the Georgian &ldquo;Rose Revolution&rdquo;  of 2003 and the Ukrainian &ldquo;Orange  Revolution&rdquo; of 2004-2005. It also  transferred knowledge to Lebanese  activists in 2004 to address the crisis  after the assassination of  Prime Minister Harriri, and assisted participants  in the Maldives&rsquo;  revolution in 2008. Recently CANVAS has worked with  April 6th, a key  group in the Egyptian nonviolent uprising, as well  as other groups from  the Middle East.</p> <p>CANVAS&rsquo; teachings are available in  a documentary, &quot;Bringing Down a  Dictator,&quot; featuring Otpor  strategies to topple Milosevic. Its manual  &quot;Nonviolent Struggle:  50 Crucial Points&quot; was translated into 16  languages, including  Farsi and Arabic, and was downloaded 17,000 times  from Iran during that  country&#39;s 2009 protests.</p> ", "slug": "srdja_popovic", "whotheyare": "Srdja Popovic was a founder and leader of the student movement that brought down the Milosovic regime.

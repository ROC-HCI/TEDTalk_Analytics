VWhen I was nine years old,
p5
aVmy mom asked me what I would want my house to look like,
p6
aVand I drew this fairy mushroom.
p7
aVAnd then she actually built it.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VI don't think I realized this was so unusual at the time,
p11
aVand maybe I still haven't,
p12
aVbecause I'm still designing houses.
p13
aVThis is a six-story bespoke home on the island of Bali.
p14
aVIt's built almost entirely from bamboo.
p15
aVThe living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor.
p16
aVYou enter the house by a bridge.
p17
aVIt can get hot in the tropics,
p18
aVso we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes.
p19
aVBut some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in
p20
aVand the bugs out.
p21
aVThis room we left open.
p22
aVWe made an air-conditioned, tented bed.
p23
aVAnd one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room.
p24
aVBoxing off an area with tall walls just didn't feel right,
p25
aVso instead, we made this giant woven pod.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, we do have all the necessary luxuries, like bathrooms.
p28
aVThis one is a basket in the corner of the living room,
p29
aVand I've got tell you, some people actually hesitate to use it.
p30
aVWe have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVSo there are lots of things that we're still working on,
p33
aVbut one thing I have learned
p34
aVis that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right.
p35
aa(lp36
VIt's actually a wild grass.
p37
aVIt grows on otherwise unproductive land \u2014
p38
aVdeep ravines, mountainsides.
p39
aVIt lives off of rainwater, spring water, sunlight,
p40
aVand of the 1,450 species of bamboo that grow across the world,
p41
aVwe use just seven of them.
p42
aa(lp43
VThat's my dad.
p44
aVHe's the one who got me building with bamboo,
p45
aVand he is standing in a clump
p46
aVof Dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago.
p47
aVEach year, it sends up a new generation of shoots.
p48
aVThat shoot, we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week,
p49
aVso we're talking about sustainable timber in three years.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, we harvest from hundreds of family-owned clumps.
p52
aVBetung, as we call it, it's really long,
p53
aVup to 18 meters of usable length.
p54
aVTry getting that truck down the mountain.
p55
aVAnd it's strong: it has the tensile strength of steel,
p56
aVthe compressive strength of concrete.
p57
aVSlam four tons straight down on a pole,
p58
aVand it can take it.
p59
aVBecause it's hollow, it's lightweight,
p60
aVlight enough to be lifted by just a few men,
p61
aVor, apparently, one woman.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd when my father built Green School in Bali,
p66
aVhe chose bamboo for all of the buildings on campus,
p67
aVbecause he saw it as a promise.
p68
aVIt's a promise to the kids.
p69
aVIt's one sustainable material that they will not run out of.
p70
aVAnd when I first saw these structures under construction about six years ago,
p71
aVI just thought, this makes perfect sense.
p72
aVIt is growing all around us.
p73
aVIt's strong. It's elegant.
p74
aVIt's earthquake-resistant.
p75
aVWhy hasn't this happened sooner, and what can we do with it next?
p76
aa(lp77
VSo along with some of the original builders of Green School,
p78
aVI founded Ibuku.
p79
aVIbu means "mother," and ku means "mine," so it represents my Mother Earth,
p80
aVand at Ibuku, we are a team of artisans, architects and designers,
p81
aVand what we're doing together is creating a new way of building.
p82
aVOver the past five years together,
p83
aVwe have built over 50 unique structures, most of them in Bali.
p84
aVNine of them are at Green Village \u2014
p85
aVyou've just seen inside some of these homes \u2014
p86
aVand we fill them with bespoke furniture,
p87
aVwe surround them with veggie gardens,
p88
aVwe would love to invite you all to come visit someday.
p89
aVAnd while you're there, you can also see Green School \u2014
p90
aVwe keep building classrooms there each year \u2014
p91
aVas well as an updated fairy mushroom house.
p92
aa(lp93
VWe're also working on a little house for export.
p94
aVThis is a traditional Sumbanese home that we replicated,
p95
aVright down to the details and textiles.
p96
aVA restaurant with an open-air kitchen.
p97
aVIt looks a lot like a kitchen, right?
p98
aVAnd a bridge that spans 22 meters across a river.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, what we're doing, it's not entirely new.
p101
aVFrom little huts to elaborate bridges like this one in Java,
p102
aVbamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world
p103
aVfor literally tens of thousands of years.
p104
aVThere are islands and even continents that were first reached by bamboo rafts.
p105
aVBut until recently,
p106
aVit was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects,
p107
aVand so, just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone.
p108
aVUnprotected bamboo weathers.
p109
aVUntreated bamboo gets eaten to dust.
p110
aVAnd so that's why most people, especially in Asia,
p111
aVthink that you couldn't be poor enough or rural enough to actually want
p112
aVto live in a bamboo house.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so we thought,
p115
aVwhat will it take to change their minds,
p116
aVto convince people that bamboo is worth building with,
p117
aVmuch less worth aspiring to?
p118
aa(lp119
VFirst, we needed safe treatment solutions.
p120
aVBorax is a natural salt.
p121
aVIt turns bamboo into a viable building material.
p122
aVTreat it properly, design it carefully,
p123
aVand a bamboo structure can last a lifetime.
p124
aa(lp125
VSecond, build something extraordinary out of it.
p126
aVInspire people.
p127
aVFortunately,
p128
aVBalinese culture fosters craftsmanship.
p129
aVIt values the artisan.
p130
aVSo combine those with the adventurous outliers
p131
aVfrom new generations of locally trained architects
p132
aVand designers and engineers,
p133
aVand always remember that you are designing
p134
aVfor curving, tapering, hollow poles.
p135
aVNo two poles alike, no straight lines,
p136
aVno two-by-fours here.
p137
aVThe tried-and-true, well-crafted formulas and vocabulary of architecture
p138
aVdo not apply here.
p139
aVWe have had to invent our own rules.
p140
aVWe ask the bamboo what it's good at, what it wants to become,
p141
aVand what it says is: respect it, design for its strengths,
p142
aVprotect it from water, and to make the most of its curves.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo we design in real 3D,
p145
aVmaking scale structural models
p146
aVout of the same material that we'll later use to build the house.
p147
aVAnd bamboo model-making, it's an art,
p148
aVas well as some hardcore engineering.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo that's the blueprint of the house.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd we bring it to site,
p155
aVand with tiny rulers, we measure each pole,
p156
aVand consider each curve, and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile
p157
aVto replicate that house on site.
p158
aa(lp159
VWhen it comes down to the details, we consider everything.
p160
aVWhy are doors so often rectangular?
p161
aVWhy not round?
p162
aVHow could you make a door better?
p163
aVWell, its hinges battle with gravity,
p164
aVand gravity will always win in the end,
p165
aVso why not have it pivot on the center
p166
aVwhere it can stay balanced?
p167
aVAnd while you're at it, why not doors shaped like teardrops?
p168
aa(lp169
VTo reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints
p170
aVof this material,
p171
aVwe have really had to push ourselves,
p172
aVand within that constraint, we have found space for something new.
p173
aVIt's a challenge: how do you make a ceiling
p174
aVif you don't have any flat boards to work with?
p175
aVLet me tell you, sometimes I dream of sheet rock and plywood.
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVBut if what you've got is skilled craftsmen
p178
aVand itsy bitsy little splits,
p179
aVweave that ceiling together,
p180
aVstretch a canvas over it, lacquer it.
p181
aVHow do you design durable kitchen countertops
p182
aVthat do justice to this curving structure you've just built?
p183
aVSlice up a boulder like a loaf of bread,
p184
aVhand-carve each to fit the other,
p185
aVleave the crusts on,
p186
aVand what we're doing, it is almost entirely handmade.
p187
aVThe structural connections of our buildings
p188
aVare reinforced by steel joints, but we use a lot of hand-whittled bamboo pins.
p189
aVThere are thousands of pins in each floor.
p190
aVThis floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin.
p191
aVYou can feel the texture under bare feet.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd the floor that you walk on,
p194
aVcan it affect the way that you walk?
p195
aVCan it change the footprint that you'll ultimately leave on the world?
p196
aVI remember being nine years old
p197
aVand feeling wonder,
p198
aVand possibility,
p199
aVand a little bit of idealism.
p200
aVAnd we've got a really long way to go,
p201
aVthere's a lot left to learn,
p202
aVbut one thing I know is that with creativity and commitment,
p203
aVyou can create beauty and comfort
p204
aVand safety and even luxury
p205
aVout of a material that will grow back.
p206
aa(lp207
VThank you.

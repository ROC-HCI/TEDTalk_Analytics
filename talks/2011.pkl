VPeople say things about religion all the time.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVThe late, great Christopher Hitchens
p7
aVwrote a book called "God Is Not Great"
p8
aVwhose subtitle was, "Religion Poisons Everything."
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVBut last month, in Time magazine,
p11
aVRabbi David Wolpe, who I gather is referred to as America's rabbi,
p12
aVsaid, to balance that against that negative characterization,
p13
aVthat no important form of social change
p14
aVcan be brought about except through organized religion.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, remarks of this sort on the negative
p17
aVand the positive side are very old.
p18
aVI have one in my pocket here
p19
aVfrom the first century BCE by Lucretius,
p20
aVthe author of "On the Nature of Things," who said,
p21
aV"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum" \u2014
p22
aVI should have been able to learn that by heart \u2014
p23
aVwhich is, that's how much religion
p24
aVis able to persuade people to do evil,
p25
aVand he was talking about the fact
p26
aVof Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter
p27
aVIphigenia on an altar of sacrifice
p28
aVin order to preserve the prospects of his army.
p29
aVSo there have been these long debates
p30
aVover the centuries, in that case, actually,
p31
aVwe can say over the millennia, about religion.
p32
aVPeople have talked about it a lot,
p33
aVand they've said good and bad
p34
aVand indifferent things about it.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhat I want to persuade you of today
p37
aVis of a very simple claim,
p38
aVwhich is that these debates are
p39
aVin a certain sense preposterous,
p40
aVbecause there is no such thing as religion
p41
aVabout which to make these claims.
p42
aVThere isn't a thing called religion,
p43
aVand so it can't be good or bad.
p44
aVIt can't even be indifferent.
p45
aVAnd if you think about claims
p46
aVabout the nonexistence of things,
p47
aVone obvious way to try and establish
p48
aVthe nonexistence of a purported thing
p49
aVwould be to offer a definition of that thing
p50
aVand then to see whether anything satisfied it.
p51
aVI'm going to start out on that little route
p52
aVto begin with.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo if you look in the dictionaries
p55
aVand if you think about it,
p56
aVone very natural definition of religion
p57
aVis that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings.
p58
aVAs I say, this is in many dictionaries,
p59
aVbut you'll also find it actually
p60
aVin the work of Sir Edward Tylor,
p61
aVwho was the first professor of anthropology at Oxford,
p62
aVone of the first modern anthropologists.
p63
aVIn his book on primitive culture,
p64
aVhe says the heart of religion is what he called animism,
p65
aVthat is, the belief in spiritual agency,
p66
aVbelief in spirits.
p67
aVThe first problem for that definition
p68
aVis from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called "Tuff."
p69
aVThere's a guy talking to a rabbi.
p70
aVThe rabbi says he doesn't believe in God.
p71
aVThe guy says, "You're a rabbi, how can you not believe in God?"
p72
aVAnd the reply is, "It's what's so great about being Jewish.
p73
aVYou don't have to believe in a God per se,
p74
aVjust in being Jewish." (Laughter)
p75
aVSo if this guy is a rabbi, and a Jewish rabbi,
p76
aVand if you have to believe in God in order to be religious,
p77
aVthen we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion
p78
aVthat since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi
p79
aVwithout believing in God,
p80
aVJudaism isn't a religion.
p81
aVThat seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought.
p82
aa(lp83
VHere's another argument against this view.
p84
aVA friend of mine, an Indian friend of mine,
p85
aVwent to his grandfather when he was very young,
p86
aVa child, and said to him,
p87
aV"I want to talk to you about religion,"
p88
aVand his grandfather said, "You're too young.
p89
aVCome back when you're a teenager."
p90
aVSo he came back when he was a teenager,
p91
aVand he said to his grandfather,
p92
aV"It may be a bit late now
p93
aVbecause I've discovered that I don't believe in the gods."
p94
aVAnd his grandfather, who was a wise man, said,
p95
aV"Oh, so you belong to the atheist branch
p96
aVof the Hindu tradition." (Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd finally, there's this guy,
p99
aVwho famously doesn't believe in God.
p100
aVHis name is the Dalai Lama.
p101
aVHe often jokes that he's one of the world's leading atheists.
p102
aVBut it's true, because the Dalai Lama's religion
p103
aVdoes not involve belief in God.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow you might think this just shows
p106
aVthat I've given you the wrong definition
p107
aVand that I should come up with some other definition
p108
aVand test it against these cases
p109
aVand try and find something that captures
p110
aVatheistic Judaism, atheistic Hinduism,
p111
aVand atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity,
p112
aVbut I actually think that that's a bad idea,
p113
aVand the reason I think it's a bad idea
p114
aVis that I don't think that's how
p115
aVour concept of religion works.
p116
aVI think the way our concept of religion works
p117
aVis that we actually have, we have a list
p118
aVof paradigm religions
p119
aVand their sub-parts, right,
p120
aVand if something new comes along
p121
aVthat purports to be a religion,
p122
aVwhat we ask is, "Well, is it like one of these?"
p123
aVRight?
p124
aVAnd I think that's not only how we think about religion,
p125
aVand that's, as it were,
p126
aVso from our point of view,
p127
aVanything on that list had better be a religion,
p128
aVwhich is why I don't think an account of religion
p129
aVthat excludes Buddhism and Judaism
p130
aVhas a chance of being a good starter,
p131
aVbecause they're on our list.
p132
aVBut why do we have such a list?
p133
aVWhat's going on? How did it come about
p134
aVthat we have this list?
p135
aa(lp136
VI think the answer is a pretty simple one
p137
aVand therefore crude and contentious.
p138
aVI'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it,
p139
aVbut here's my story,
p140
aVand true or not, it's a story that I think
p141
aVgives you a good sense of how
p142
aVthe list might have come about,
p143
aVand therefore helps you to think about
p144
aVwhat use the list might be.
p145
aVI think the answer is, European travelers,
p146
aVstarting roughly about the time of Columbus,
p147
aVstarted going around the world.
p148
aVThey came from a Christian culture,
p149
aVand when they arrived in a new place,
p150
aVthey noticed that some people didn't have Christianity,
p151
aVand so they asked themselves the following question:
p152
aVwhat have they got instead of Christianity?
p153
aVAnd that list was essentially constructed.
p154
aVIt consists of the things that other people had
p155
aVinstead of Christianity.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way,
p158
aVwhich is that Christianity is extremely,
p159
aVeven on that list, it's an extremely specific tradition.
p160
aVIt has all kinds of things in it
p161
aVthat are very, very particular
p162
aVthat are the results of the specifics
p163
aVof Christian history,
p164
aVand one thing that's at the heart of it,
p165
aVone thing that's at the heart of most understandings of Christianity,
p166
aVwhich is the result of the specific history of Christianity,
p167
aVis that it's an extremely creedal religion.
p168
aVIt's a religion in which people are really concerned
p169
aVabout whether you believe the right things.
p170
aVThe history of Christianity, the internal history of Christianity,
p171
aVis largely the history of people killing each other
p172
aVbecause they believed the wrong thing,
p173
aVand it's also involved in
p174
aVstruggles with other religions,
p175
aVobviously starting in the Middle Ages,
p176
aVa struggle with Islam,
p177
aVin which, again, it was the infidelity,
p178
aVthe fact that they didn't believe the right things,
p179
aVthat seemed so offensive to the Christian world.
p180
aVNow that's a very specific and particular history
p181
aVthat Christianity has,
p182
aVand not everywhere is everything
p183
aVthat has ever been put on this sort of list like it.
p184
aVHere's another problem, I think.
p185
aVA very specific thing happened.
p186
aVIt was actually adverted to earlier,
p187
aVbut a very specific thing happened
p188
aVin the history of the kind of Christianity
p189
aVthat we see around us
p190
aVmostly in the United States today,
p191
aVand it happened in the late 19th century,
p192
aVand that specific thing that happened
p193
aVin the late 19th century
p194
aVwas a kind of deal that was cut
p195
aVbetween science,
p196
aVthis new way of organizing intellectual authority,
p197
aVand religion.
p198
aVIf you think about the 18th century, say,
p199
aVif you think about intellectual life
p200
aVbefore the late 19th century,
p201
aVanything you did, anything you thought about,
p202
aVwhether it was the physical world,
p203
aVthe human world,
p204
aVthe natural world apart from the human world,
p205
aVor morality, anything you did
p206
aVwould have been framed against the background
p207
aVof a set of assumptions that were religious,
p208
aVChristian assumptions.
p209
aVYou couldn't give an account
p210
aVof the natural world
p211
aVthat didn't say something about its relationship,
p212
aVfor example, to the creation story
p213
aVin the Abrahamic tradition,
p214
aVthe creation story in the first book of the Torah.
p215
aVSo everything was framed in that way.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut this changes in the late 19th century,
p218
aVand for the first time, it's possible for people
p219
aVto develop serious intellectual careers
p220
aVas natural historians like Darwin.
p221
aVDarwin worried about the relationship between
p222
aVwhat he said and the truths of religion,
p223
aVbut he could proceed, he could write books
p224
aVabout his subject
p225
aVwithout having to say what the relationship was
p226
aVto the religious claims,
p227
aVand similarly, geologists increasingly could talk about it.
p228
aVIn the early 19th century, if you were a geologist
p229
aVand made a claim about the age of the Earth,
p230
aVyou had to explain whether that was consistent
p231
aVor how it was or wasn't consistent
p232
aVwith the age of the Earth implied
p233
aVby the account in Genesis.
p234
aVBy the end of the 19th century,
p235
aVyou can just write a geology textbook
p236
aVin which you make arguments about how old the Earth is.
p237
aVSo there's a big change, and that division,
p238
aVthat intellectual division of labor occurs as I say, I think,
p239
aVand it sort of solidifies so that by the end
p240
aVof the 19th century in Europe,
p241
aVthere's a real intellectual division of labor,
p242
aVand you can do all sorts of serious things,
p243
aVincluding, increasingly, even philosophy,
p244
aVwithout being constrained by the thought,
p245
aV"Well, what I have to say has to be consistent
p246
aVwith the deep truths that are given to me
p247
aVby our religious tradition."
p248
aa(lp249
VSo imagine someone who's coming out
p250
aVof that world, that late-19th-century world,
p251
aVcoming into the country that I grew up in, Ghana,
p252
aVthe society that I grew up in, Asante,
p253
aVcoming into that world
p254
aVat the turn of the 20th century
p255
aVwith this question that made the list:
p256
aVwhat have they got instead of Christianity?
p257
aa(lp258
VWell, here's one thing he would have noticed,
p259
aVand by the way, there was a  person who actually did this.
p260
aVHis name was Captain Rattray,
p261
aVhe was sent as the British government anthropologist,
p262
aVand he wrote a book about Asante religion.
p263
aa(lp264
VThis is a soul disc.
p265
aVThere are many of them in the British Museum.
p266
aVI could give you an interesting, different history
p267
aVof how it comes about that many of the things
p268
aVfrom my society ended up in the British Museum,
p269
aVbut we don't have time for that.
p270
aVSo this object is a soul disc.
p271
aVWhat is a soul disc?
p272
aVIt was worn around the necks
p273
aVof the soul-washers of the Asante king.
p274
aVWhat was their job? To wash the king's soul.
p275
aVIt would take a long while
p276
aVto explain how a soul could be the kind of thing
p277
aVthat could be washed,
p278
aVbut Rattray knew that this was religion
p279
aVbecause souls were in play.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd similarly,
p282
aVthere were many other things, many other practices.
p283
aVFor example, every time anybody had a drink, more or less,
p284
aVthey poured a little bit on the ground
p285
aVin what's called the libation,
p286
aVand they gave some to the ancestors.
p287
aVMy father did this. Every time he opened a bottle of whiskey,
p288
aVwhich I'm glad to say was very often,
p289
aVhe would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground,
p290
aVand he would talk to,
p291
aVhe would say to Akroma-Ampim, the founder of our line,
p292
aVor Yao Antony, my great uncle,
p293
aVhe would talk to them,
p294
aVoffer them a little bit of this.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd finally, there were these huge public ceremonials.
p297
aVThis is an early-19th-century drawing
p298
aVby another British military officer
p299
aVof such a ceremonial,
p300
aVwhere the king was involved,
p301
aVand the king's job,
p302
aVone of the large parts of his job,
p303
aVapart from organizing warfare and things like that,
p304
aVwas to look after the tombs of his ancestors,
p305
aVand when a king died,
p306
aVthe stool that he sat on was blackened
p307
aVand put in the royal ancestral temple,
p308
aVand every 40 days,
p309
aVthe King of Asante has to go and do cult
p310
aVfor his ancestors.
p311
aVThat's a large part of his job,
p312
aVand people think that if he doesn't do it,
p313
aVthings will fall apart.
p314
aVSo he's a religious figure,
p315
aVas Rattray would have said,
p316
aVas well as a political figure.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo all this would count as religion for Rattray,
p319
aVbut my point is that when you look
p320
aVinto the lives of those people,
p321
aVyou also find that every time they do anything,
p322
aVthey're conscious of the ancestors.
p323
aVEvery morning at breakfast,
p324
aVyou can go outside the front of the house
p325
aVand make an offering to the god tree, the nyame dua
p326
aVoutside your house,
p327
aVand again, you'll talk to the gods
p328
aVand the high gods and the low gods
p329
aVand the ancestors and so on.
p330
aVThis is not a world
p331
aVin which the separation between religion and science
p332
aVhas occurred.
p333
aVReligion has not being separated
p334
aVfrom any other areas of life,
p335
aVand in particular,
p336
aVwhat's crucial to understand about this world
p337
aVis that it's a world in which the job
p338
aVthat science does for us
p339
aVis done by what Rattray is going to call religion,
p340
aVbecause if they want an explanation of something,
p341
aVif they want to know why the crop just failed,
p342
aVif they want to know why it's raining
p343
aVor not raining, if they need rain,
p344
aVif they want to know why
p345
aVtheir grandfather has died,
p346
aVthey are going to appeal to the very same entities,
p347
aVthe very same language,
p348
aVtalk to the very same gods about that.
p349
aVThis great separation, in other words,
p350
aVbetween religion and science hasn't happened.
p351
aa(lp352
VNow, this would be a mere historical curiosity,
p353
aVexcept that in large parts of the world,
p354
aVthis is still the truth.
p355
aVI had the privilege of going to a wedding
p356
aVthe other day in northern Namibia,
p357
aV20 miles or so south of the Angolan border
p358
aVin a village of 200 people.
p359
aVThese were modern people.
p360
aVWe had with us Oona Chaplin,
p361
aVwho some of you may have heard of,
p362
aVand one of the people from this village came up to her,
p363
aVand said, "I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'"
p364
aVSo these were not people who were isolated from our world,
p365
aVbut nevertheless, for them,
p366
aVthe gods and the spirits are still very much there,
p367
aVand when we were on the bus going back and forth
p368
aVto the various parts of the [ceremony],
p369
aVthey prayed not just in a generic way
p370
aVbut for the safety of the journey,
p371
aVand they meant it,
p372
aVand when they said to me that my mother,
p373
aVthe bridegroom's [grandmother],
p374
aVwas with us, they didn't mean it figuratively.
p375
aVThey meant, even though she was a dead person,
p376
aVthey meant that she was still around.
p377
aVSo in large parts of the world today,
p378
aVthat separation between science and religion
p379
aVhasn't occurred in large parts of the world today,
p380
aVand as I say, these are not \u2014
p381
aVThis guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank.
p382
aVThese are fellow citizens of the world with you,
p383
aVbut they come from a place in which religion
p384
aVis occupying a very different role.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo what I want you to think about next time somebody wants
p387
aVto make some vast generalization about religion
p388
aVis that maybe there isn't such a thing
p389
aVas a religion, such a thing as religion,
p390
aVand that therefore what they say
p391
aVcannot possibly be true.

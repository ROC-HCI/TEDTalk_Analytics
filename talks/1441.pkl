VI love my food.
p5
aVAnd I love information.
p6
aVMy children usually tell me
p7
aVthat one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VBut what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so
p11
aVis to take you through how those passions developed,
p12
aVthe point in my life when the two passions merged,
p13
aVthe journey of learning that took place from that point.
p14
aVAnd one idea I want to leave you with today
p15
aVis what would would happen differently in your life
p16
aVif you saw information the way you saw food?
p17
aa(lp18
VI was born in Calcutta \u2014
p19
aVa family where my father and his father before him
p20
aVwere journalists,
p21
aVand they wrote magazines in the English language.
p22
aVThat was the family business.
p23
aVAnd as a result of that,
p24
aVI grew up with books everywhere around the house.
p25
aVAnd I mean books everywhere around the house.
p26
aVAnd that's actually a shop in Calcutta,
p27
aVbut it's a place where we like our books.
p28
aVIn fact, I've got 38,000 of them now
p29
aVand no Kindle in sight.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut growing up as a child with the books around everywhere,
p32
aVwith people to talk to about those books,
p33
aVthis wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing.
p34
aa(lp35
VBy the time I was 18, I had a deep passion for books.
p36
aVIt wasn't the only passion I had.
p37
aVI was a South Indian
p38
aVbrought up in Bengal.
p39
aVAnd two of the things about Bengal:
p40
aVthey like their savory dishes
p41
aVand they like their sweets.
p42
aVSo by the time I grew up,
p43
aVagain, I had a well-established passion for food.
p44
aVNow I was growing up in the late '60s and early '70s,
p45
aVand there were a number of other passions I was also interested in,
p46
aVbut these two were the ones that differentiated me.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd then life was fine, dandy.
p50
aVEverything was okay,
p51
aVuntil I got to about the age of 26,
p52
aVand I went to a movie called "Short Circuit."
p53
aVOh, some of you have seen it.
p54
aVAnd apparently it's being remade right now
p55
aVand it's going to be coming out next year.
p56
aVIt's the story of this experimental robot
p57
aVwhich got electrocuted and found a life.
p58
aVAnd as it ran, this thing was saying, "Give me input. Give me input."
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd I suddenly realized that for a robot
p61
aVboth information as well as food
p62
aVwere the same thing.
p63
aVEnergy came to it in some form or shape,
p64
aVdata came to it in some form or shape.
p65
aVAnd I began to think,
p66
aVI wonder what it would be like
p67
aVto start imagining myself
p68
aVas if energy and information were the two things I had as input \u2014
p69
aVas if food and information were similar in some form or shape.
p70
aa(lp71
VI started doing some research then, and this was the 25-year journey,
p72
aVand started finding out
p73
aVthat actually human beings as primates
p74
aVhave far smaller stomachs
p75
aVthan should be the size for our body weight
p76
aVand far larger brains.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd as I went to research that even further,
p79
aVI got to a point where I discovered something
p80
aVcalled the expensive tissue hypothesis.
p81
aVThat actually for a given body mass of a primate
p82
aVthe metabolic rate was static.
p83
aVWhat changed was the balance of the tissues available.
p84
aVAnd two of the most expensive tissues in our human body
p85
aVare nervous tissue and digestive tissue.
p86
aVAnd what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis
p87
aVthat was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995.
p88
aVIt's a lady named Leslie Aiello.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other.
p91
aVIf you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large,
p92
aVyou had to live with a smaller gut.
p93
aa(lp94
VThat then set me off completely
p95
aVto say, Okay, these two are connected.
p96
aVSo I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food
p97
aVand said, So we were hunter-gathers of information.
p98
aVWe moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information.
p99
aa(lp100
VDoes that really explain what we're seeing
p101
aVwith the intellectual property battles nowadays?
p102
aVBecause those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin
p103
aVwanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted,
p104
aVand those that were in the business of farming information
p105
aVwanted to build fences around it,
p106
aVcreate ownership and wealth and structure and settlement.
p107
aVSo there was always going to be a tension within that.
p108
aVAnd everything I saw in the cultivation
p109
aVsaid there were huge fights amongst the foodies
p110
aVbetween the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers.
p111
aVAnd this is happening here.
p112
aa(lp113
VWhen I moved to preparation, this same thing was true,
p114
aVexpect that there were two schools.
p115
aVOne group of people said you can distill your information,
p116
aVyou can extract value, separate it and serve it up,
p117
aVwhile another group turned around
p118
aVand said no, no you can ferment it.
p119
aVYou bring it all together and mash it up
p120
aVand the value emerges that way.
p121
aVThe same is again true with information.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable.
p124
aVBecause what I began to see then
p125
aVwas there were so many different ways people would consume this.
p126
aVThey'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients.
p127
aVDo you cook it? Do you have it served to you?
p128
aVDo you go to a restaurant?
p129
aVThe same is true every time as I started thinking about information.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe analogies were getting crazy \u2014
p132
aVthat information had sell-by dates,
p133
aVthat people had misused information that wasn't dated properly
p134
aVand could really make an effect on the stock market,
p135
aVon corporate values, etc.
p136
aVAnd by this time I was hooked.
p137
aVAnd this is about 23 years into this process.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd I began to start thinking of myself
p140
aVas we start having mash-ups of fact and fiction,
p141
aVdocu-dramas, mockumentaries, whatever you call it.
p142
aVAre we going to reach the stage
p143
aVwhere information has a percentage for fact associated with it?
p144
aVWe start labeling information for the fact percentage?
p145
aVAre we going to start looking at what happens
p146
aVwhen your information source is turned off, as a famine?
p147
aa(lp148
VWhich brings me to the final element of this.
p149
aVClay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload,
p150
aVthere is only filter failure.
p151
aVI put it to you that information,
p152
aVif viewed from the point of food,
p153
aVis never a production issue; you never speak of food overload.
p154
aVFundamentally it's a consumption issue.
p155
aVAnd we have to start thinking
p156
aVabout how we create diets within ourselves, exercise within ourselves,
p157
aVto have the faculties to be able to deal with information,
p158
aVto have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly.
p159
aVIn fact, when I saw "Supersize Me," I starting thinking of saying,
p160
aVWhat would happen
p161
aVif an individual had 31 days nonstop Fox News?
p162
aV(Laughter)
p163
aVWould there be time to be able to work with it?
p164
aa(lp165
VSo you start really understanding
p166
aVthat you can have diseases, toxins, a need to balance your diet,
p167
aVand once you start looking, and from that point on,
p168
aVeverything I have done in terms of the consumption of information,
p169
aVthe production of information, the preparation of information,
p170
aVI've looked at from the viewpoint of food.
p171
aVIt has probably not helped my waistline any
p172
aVbecause I like practicing on both sides.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut I'd like to leave you with just that question:
p175
aVIf you began to think of all the information that you consume
p176
aVthe way you think of food,
p177
aVwhat would you do differently?
p178
aa(lp179
VThank you very much for your time.

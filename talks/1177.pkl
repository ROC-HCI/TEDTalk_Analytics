VSpace,
p5
aVwe all know what it looks like.
p6
aVWe've been surrounded by images of space
p7
aVour whole lives,
p8
aVfrom the speculative images
p9
aVof science fiction
p10
aVto the inspirational visions of artists
p11
aVto the increasingly beautiful pictures
p12
aVmade possible by complex technologies.
p13
aVBut whilst we have
p14
aVan overwhelmingly vivid
p15
aVvisual understanding of space,
p16
aVwe have no sense of what space sounds like.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd indeed, most people associate space with silence.
p19
aVBut the story of how
p20
aVwe came to understand the universe
p21
aVis just as much a story of listening
p22
aVas it is by looking.
p23
aVAnd yet despite this,
p24
aVhardly any of us have ever heard space.
p25
aVHow many of you here
p26
aVcould describe the sound
p27
aVof a single planet or star?
p28
aVWell in case you've ever wondered,
p29
aVthis is what the Sun sounds like.

V(Static)
p32
aV(Crackling)
p33
aV(Static)
p34
aV(Crackling)
p35
aa(lp36

p37
aa(lp38
V(Soft crackling)
p39

VAnd this is the space probe Cassini
p41
aVpirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Crackling)
p44
aa(lp45
VThis is a a highly condensed clump
p46
aVof neutral matter,
p47
aVspinning in the distant universe.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Tapping)
p50
aa(lp51
VSo my artistic practice
p52
aVis all about listening
p53
aVto the weird and wonderful noises
p54
aVemitted by the magnificent celestial objects
p55
aVthat make up our universe.
p56
aVAnd you may wonder,
p57
aVhow do we know what these sounds are?
p58
aVHow can we tell the difference
p59
aVbetween the sound of the Sun
p60
aVand the sound of a pulsar?
p61
aVWell the answer
p62
aVis the science of radio astronomy.
p63
aVRadio astronomers
p64
aVstudy radio waves from space
p65
aVusing sensitive antennas and receivers,
p66
aVwhich give them precise information
p67
aVabout what an astronomical object is
p68
aVand where it is in our night sky.
p69
aVAnd just like the signals
p70
aVthat we send and receive here on Earth,
p71
aVwe can convert these transmissions into sound
p72
aVusing simple analog techniques.
p73
aVAnd therefore, it's through listening
p74
aVthat we've come to uncover
p75
aVsome of the universe's most important secrets \u2014
p76
aVits scale, what it's made of
p77
aVand even how old it is.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo today, I'm going to tell you a short story
p80
aVof the history of the universe through listening.
p81
aVIt's punctuated
p82
aVby three quick anecdotes,
p83
aVwhich show how accidental encounters
p84
aVwith strange noises
p85
aVgave us some of the most important information
p86
aVwe have about space.
p87
aVNow this story doesn't start
p88
aVwith vast telescopes
p89
aVor futuristic spacecraft,
p90
aVbut a rather more humble technology \u2014
p91
aVand in fact, the very medium
p92
aVwhich gave us the telecommunications revolution
p93
aVthat we're all part of today:
p94
aVthe telephone.
p95
aa(lp96
VIt's 1876, it's in Boston,
p97
aVand this is Alexander Graham Bell
p98
aVwho was working with Thomas Watson
p99
aVon the invention of the telephone.
p100
aVA key part of their technical set up
p101
aVwas a half-mile long length of wire,
p102
aVwhich was thrown across the rooftops
p103
aVof several houses in Boston.
p104
aVThe line carried the telephone signals
p105
aVthat would later make Bell a household name.
p106
aVBut like any long length of charged wire,
p107
aVit also inadvertently became
p108
aVan antenna.
p109
aVThomas Watson
p110
aVspent hours listening
p111
aVto the strange crackles and hisses
p112
aVand chirps and whistles
p113
aVthat his accidental antenna detected.
p114
aVNow you have to remember,
p115
aVthis is 10 years before
p116
aVHeinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves \u2014
p117
aV15 years before Nikola Tesla's four-tuned circuit \u2014
p118
aVnearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast.
p119
aVSo Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.
p120
aVWe didn't have the technology
p121
aVto transmit.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo what were these strange noises?
p124
aVWatson was in fact listening
p125
aVto very low-frequency radio emissions
p126
aVcaused by nature.
p127
aVSome of the crackles and pops were lightning,
p128
aVbut the eerie whistles
p129
aVand curiously melodious chirps
p130
aVhad a rather more exotic origin.
p131
aVUsing the very first telephone,
p132
aVWatson was in fact
p133
aVdialed into the heavens.
p134
aVAs he correctly guessed,
p135
aVsome of these sounds were caused
p136
aVby activity on the surface of the Sun.
p137
aVIt was a solar wind
p138
aVinteracting with our ionosphere
p139
aVthat he was listening to \u2014
p140
aVa phenomena which we can see
p141
aVat the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet
p142
aVas the aurora.
p143
aVSo whilst inventing the technology
p144
aVthat would usher in the telecommunications revolution,
p145
aVWatson had discovered
p146
aVthat the star at the center of our solar system
p147
aVemitted powerful radio waves.
p148
aVHe had accidentally been the first person
p149
aVto tune in to them.
p150
aa(lp151
VFast-forward 50 years,
p152
aVand Bell and Watson's technology
p153
aVhas completely transformed
p154
aVglobal communications.
p155
aVBut going from slinging some wire
p156
aVacross rooftops in Boston
p157
aVto laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable
p158
aVon the Atlantic Ocean seabed
p159
aVis no easy matter.
p160
aVAnd so before long,
p161
aVBell were looking to new technologies
p162
aVto optimize their revolution.
p163
aVRadio could carry sound without wires.
p164
aVBut the medium is lossy \u2014
p165
aVit's subject to a lot of noise and interference.
p166
aVSo Bell employed an engineer
p167
aVto study those noises,
p168
aVto try and find out where they came from,
p169
aVwith a view towards building
p170
aVthe perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them
p171
aVso they could think about using radio
p172
aVfor the purposes of telephony.
p173
aa(lp174
VMost of the noises
p175
aVthat the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigated
p176
aVwere fairly prosaic in origin.
p177
aVThey turned out to be lightning
p178
aVor sources of electrical power.
p179
aVBut there was one persistent noise
p180
aVthat Jansky couldn't identify,
p181
aVand it seemed to appear
p182
aVin his radio headset
p183
aVfour minutes earlier each day.
p184
aVNow any astronomer will tell you,
p185
aVthis is the telltale sign
p186
aVof something that doesn't originate from Earth.
p187
aVJansky had made a historic discovery,
p188
aVthat celestial objects could emit radio waves
p189
aVas well as light waves.
p190
aVFifty years on
p191
aVfrom Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun,
p192
aVJansky's careful listening
p193
aVushered in a new age of space exploration:
p194
aVthe radio astronomy age.
p195
aVOver the next few years,
p196
aVastronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers
p197
aVand learned about our radio sky,
p198
aVabout Jupiter and the Sun,
p199
aVby listening.
p200
aa(lp201
VLet's jump ahead again.
p202
aVIt's 1964,
p203
aVand we're back at Bell Labs.
p204
aVAnd once again,
p205
aVtwo scientists have got a problem with noise.
p206
aVArno Penzias and Robert Wilson
p207
aVwere using the horn antenna
p208
aVat Bell's Holmdel laboratory
p209
aVto study the Milky Way
p210
aVwith extraordinary precision.
p211
aVThey were really listening
p212
aVto the galaxy in high fidelity.
p213
aVThere was a glitch in their soundtrack.
p214
aVA mysterious persistent noise
p215
aVwas disrupting their research.
p216
aVIt was in the microwave range,
p217
aVand it appeared to be coming
p218
aVfrom all directions simultaneously.
p219
aVNow this didn't make any sense,
p220
aVand like any reasonable engineer or scientist,
p221
aVthey assumed that the problem must be the technology itself,
p222
aVit must be the dish.
p223
aVThere were pigeons roosting in the dish.
p224
aVAnd so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings,
p225
aVget the disk kind of operational again,
p226
aVnormal operations would resume.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut the noise didn't disappear.
p229
aVThe mysterious noise
p230
aVthat Penzias and Wilson were listening to
p231
aVturned out to be the oldest and most significant sound
p232
aVthat anyone had ever heard.
p233
aVIt was cosmic radiation
p234
aVleft over from the very birth of the universe.
p235
aVThis was the first experimental evidence
p236
aVthat the Big Bang existed
p237
aVand the universe was born at a precise moment
p238
aVsome 14.7 billion years ago.
p239
aVSo our story ends
p240
aVat the beginning \u2014
p241
aVthe beginning of all things, the Big Bang.
p242
aVThis is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard \u2014
p243
aVthe oldest sound that you're ever going to hear,
p244
aVthe cosmic microwave background radiation
p245
aVleft over from the Big Bang.
p246

Sound waves can not propagate in the vacuum of space. However,  it is possible for radio waves emitted from celestial bodies, such as  Jupiter and the Sun, to be heard by using radio technology.  In our  galaxy, the Sun is the strongest source of radio waves - so it&#39;s the  most powerful transmitter in the radio sky. Jupiter also sends us strong  radio signals.</p> <p>What we hear is very curiously linked with our experience of radio  here on earth -- the sounds are a bit like the sound of static between  the stations.</p><p>Photo: <a href=\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/matlocktest/81500148/in/photostream/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Matt Locke / Flickr CC</a> <br /></p>", "slug": "honor_harger", "whotheyare": "Honor Harger explores the sounds of the sky, using art to connect her audience to the universe.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 1069, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/b183fa176624bcf91a8da170491845ab41d52f58_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "A history of the universe in sound", "take_action": null, "comments": 4905, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/f45abccb79f68f69f7d4b06c29a7f5be8f25b32b_800x600.jpg", "description": "Artist-technologist Honor Harger listens to the weird and wonderful noises of stars and planets and pulsars.

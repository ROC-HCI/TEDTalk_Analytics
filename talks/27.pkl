VMy name is Lovegrove.
p5
aVI only know nine Lovegroves, two of which are my parents.
p6
aVThey are first cousins, and you know what happens when, you know \u2014
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VSo there's a terribly weird freaky side to me,
p11
aVwhich I'm fighting with all the time.
p12
aVSo to try and get through today,
p13
aVI've kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk.
p14
aVI was hanging on to have a pee.
p15
aVI thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough,
p16
aVthat would guide me through the 18 minutes.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VOK. I am known as Captain Organic
p21
aVand that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position.
p22
aVBut today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form
p23
aVand how form can touch people's soul and emotion.
p24
aVNot very long ago, not many thousands of years ago,
p25
aVwe actually lived in caves,
p26
aVand I don't think we've lost that coding system.
p27
aVWe respond so well to form.
p28
aVBut I'm interested in creating intelligent form.
p29
aVI'm not interested at all in blobism
p30
aVor any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design.
p31
aVThis artificially induced consumerism \u2014 I think it's atrocious.
p32
aa(lp33
VMy world is the world of people like Amory Lovins,
p34
aVJanine Benyus, James Watson.
p35
aVI'm in that world, but I work purely instinctively.
p36
aVI'm not a scientist. I could have been, perhaps,
p37
aVbut I work in this world where I trust my instincts.
p38
aVSo I am a 21st-century translator of technology
p39
aVinto products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with.
p40
aVAnd we should be developing things \u2014 we should be developing packaging
p41
aVfor ideas which elevate people's perceptions
p42
aVand respect for the things that we dig out of the earth
p43
aVand translate into products for everyday use.
p44
aVSo, the water bottle.
p45
aa(lp46
VI'll begin with this concept of what I call DNA.
p47
aVDNA: Design, Nature, Art.
p48
aVThese are the three things that condition my world.
p49
aVHere is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, 500 years ago, before photography.
p50
aVIt shows how observation, curiosity and instinct
p51
aVwork to create amazing art.
p52
aVIndustrial design is the art form of the 21st century.
p53
aVPeople like Leonardo \u2014 there have not been many \u2014
p54
aVhad this amazingly instinctive curiosity.
p55
aVI work from a similar position.
p56
aVI don't want to sound pretentious saying that,
p57
aVbut this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago \u2014
p58
aVwell into the 21st century, 500 years later.
p59
aVIt's my impression of water.
p60
aVImpressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it:
p61
aV100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.
p62
aa(lp63
VI use, now, a whole new process.
p64
aVA few years ago I reinvented my process
p65
aVto keep up with people like Greg Lynn, Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas \u2014
p66
aVall these people that I think are persevering and pioneering
p67
aVwith fantastic new ideas of how to create form.
p68
aVThis is all created digitally.
p69
aVHere you see the machining, the milling of a block of acrylic.
p70
aVThis is what I show to the client to say, "That's what I want to do."
p71
aVAt that point, I don't know if that's possible at all.
p72
aVIt's a seductor, but I just feel in my bones that that's possible.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo we go, we look at the tooling.
p75
aVWe look at how that is produced.
p76
aVThese are the invisible things that you never see in your life.
p77
aVThis is the background noise of industrial design.
p78
aVThat is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra.
p79
aVIt is more valuable than the product in my eyes.
p80
aVI don't have one.
p81
aVWhen I do make some money, I'll have one machined for myself.
p82
aVThis is the final product.
p83
aVWhen they sent it to me, I thought I'd failed.
p84
aVIt felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing.
p85
aVIt was when I put the water in
p86
aVthat I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself.
p87
aVIt's an icon of water itself,
p88
aVand it elevates people's perception of contemporary design.
p89
aVEach bottle is different,
p90
aVmeaning the water level will give you a different shape.
p91
aVIt's mass individualism from a single product.
p92
aVIt fits the hand.
p93
aVIt fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands.
p94
aVIt makes the product strong, the tessellation.
p95
aVIt's a millefiori of ideas.
p96
aVIn the future, they will look like that,
p97
aVbecause we need to move away from those type of polymers
p98
aVand use that for medical equipment
p99
aVand more important things, perhaps, in life.
p100
aVBiopolymers, these new ideas for materials,
p101
aVwill come into play in probably a decade.
p102
aVIt doesn't look as cool, does it?
p103
aVBut I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that.
p104
aVI design for that condition, biopolymers. It's the future.
p105
aa(lp106
VI took this video in Cape Town last year.
p107
aVThis is the freaky side coming out.
p108
aVI have this special interest in things like this, which blow my mind.
p109
aVI don't know whether to, you know, drop to my knees, cry;
p110
aVI don't know what I think.
p111
aVBut I just know that nature \u2014
p112
aVnature improves with ever-greater purpose
p113
aVthat which once existed,
p114
aVand that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking.
p115
aVWhen I look at these things, they look pretty normal to me.
p116
aVBut these things evolved over many years, and what we're trying to do \u2014
p117
aVI get three weeks to design a telephone. How the hell do I do that,
p118
aVwhen you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve?
p119
aVHow do you condense that?
p120
aa(lp121
VIt comes back to instinct.
p122
aVI'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that
p123
aVand I'm not looking at designing architecture like that.
p124
aVI'm just interested in natural growth patterns
p125
aVand the beautiful forms that only nature really creates.
p126
aVHow that flows through me and how that comes out
p127
aVis what I'm trying to understand.
p128
aa(lp129
VThis is a scan through the human forearm.
p130
aVIt's then blown up through rapid prototyping
p131
aVto reveal its cellular structure.
p132
aVI have these in my office.
p133
aVMy office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum
p134
aVand a NASA space lab.
p135
aVIt's a weird, kind of freaky place.
p136
aVThis is one of my specimens.
p137
aa(lp138
VThis is made \u2014
p139
aVbone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers.
p140
aVI studied cooking in school for four years, and in that experience,
p141
aVwhich was called "domestic science,"
p142
aVit was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VActually, I put marijuana in everything I cooked \u2014
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous.
p151
aVAll the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand.
p152
aVAnyway \u2014 this is a meringue.
p153
aVThis is another sample I have.
p154
aVA meringue is made exactly the same way, in my estimation, as a bone.
p155
aVIt's made from polysaccharides and proteins.
p156
aVIf you pour water on that, it dissolves.
p157
aVCould we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future?
p158
aVNot a bad idea. I don't know.
p159
aVI need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that,
p160
aVbut I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something,
p161
aVa car \u2014 I don't know.
p162
aa(lp163
VI'm also interested in growth patterns:
p164
aVthe unbridled way that nature grows things
p165
aVso you're not restricted by form at all.
p166
aVThese interrelated forms, they do inspire everything I do,
p167
aValthough I might end up making something incredibly simple.
p168
aVThis is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium.
p169
aVIt shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of, kind of, engineering
p170
aVand biological thinking,
p171
aVshown pretty much as a bone structure.
p172
aVAny one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall
p173
aVas some kind of art object.
p174
aa(lp175
VIt's the world's first chair made in magnesium.
p176
aVIt cost 1.7 million dollars to develop.
p177
aVIt's called "Go," by Bernhardt, USA.
p178
aVIt went into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century.
p179
aVBoy. For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village, that's enough.
p180
aVIt shows how you make one holistic form, like the car industry,
p181
aVand then you break up what you need.
p182
aVThis is an absolutely beautiful way of working.
p183
aVIt's a godly way of working.
p184
aVIt's organic and it's essential.
p185
aVIt's an absolutely fat-free design,
p186
aVand when you look at it, you see human beings.
p187
aa(lp188
VWhen that moves into polymers,
p189
aVyou can change the elasticity, the fluidity of the form.
p190
aVThis is an idea for a gas-injected, one-piece polymer chair.
p191
aVWhat nature does is it drills holes in things.
p192
aVIt liberates form.
p193
aVIt takes away anything extraneous.
p194
aVThat's what I do.
p195
aVI make organic things which are essential.
p196
aVAnd they look funky, too \u2014 but I don't set out to make funky things
p197
aVbecause I think that's an absolute disgrace.
p198
aa(lp199
VI set out to look at natural forms.
p200
aVIf you took the idea of fractal technology further, take a membrane,
p201
aVshrinking it down constantly like nature does \u2014
p202
aVthat could be a seat for a chair.
p203
aVIt could be a sole for a sports shoe.
p204
aVIt could be a car blending into seats.
p205
aVWow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff.
p206
aVThis is what exists in nature.
p207
aVObservation now allows us to bring that natural process
p208
aVinto the design process every day.
p209
aVThat's what I do.
p210
aa(lp211
VThis is a show that's currently on in Tokyo.
p212
aVIt's called "Superliquidity." It's my sculptural investigation.
p213
aVIt's like 21st-century Henry Moore.
p214
aVWhen you see a Henry Moore, still, your hair stands up.
p215
aVThere's some amazing spiritual connect.
p216
aVIf he was a car designer, phew, we'd all be driving one.
p217
aVIn his day, he was the highest taxpayer in Britain.
p218
aa(lp219
VThat is the power of organic design.
p220
aVIt contributes immensely to our \u2014
p221
aVsense of being,
p222
aVour sense of relationships with things,
p223
aVour sensuality and, you know, the sort of \u2014
p224
aVeven the sort of socio-erotic side, which is very important.
p225
aVThis is my artwork. This is all my process.
p226
aVThese actually are sold as artwork. They're very big prints.
p227
aVBut this is how I get to that object.
p228
aa(lp229
VIronically, that object was made by the Killarney process,
p230
aVwhich is a brand-new process here for the 21st century,
p231
aVand I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that.
p232
aVI'll tell you about that later.
p233
aa(lp234
VWhen I look into these data images,
p235
aVI see new things.
p236
aVIt's self-inspired.
p237
aVDiatomic structures, radiolaria,
p238
aVthe things that we couldn't see but we can do now \u2014
p239
aVthese, again, are cored out.
p240
aVThey're made virtually from nothing. They're made from silica.
p241
aVWhy not structures from cars like that?
p242
aVCoral, all these natural forces,
p243
aVtake away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty.
p244
aVWe need to be in that realm.
p245
aVI want to do stuff like that.
p246
aa(lp247
VThis is a new chair which should come on the market in September.
p248
aVIt's for a company called Moroso in Italy. It's a gas-injected polymer chair.
p249
aVThose holes you see there are very filtered-down,
p250
aVwatered-down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures.
p251
aVIt goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see \u2014
p252
aVthere's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing.
p253
aVIt's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming.
p254
aVIf you see the shadows that come through that,
p255
aVthey're actually probably more important than the product,
p256
aVbut it's the minimum it takes.
p257
aVThe coring out of the back lets you breathe.
p258
aVIt takes away any material you don't need
p259
aVand it actually garners flexure too.
p260
aa(lp261
VI was going to break into a dance then.
p262
aa(lp263
VThis is some current work I'm doing.
p264
aVI'm looking at single-surface structures
p265
aVand how they stretch and flow.
p266
aVIt's based on furniture typologies, but that's not the end motivation.
p267
aVIt's made from aluminum ...
p268
aVas opposed to aluminium, and it's grown.
p269
aVIt's grown in my mind,
p270
aVand then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through.
p271
aa(lp272
VThis is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry, who build parts for Bentleys and so on.
p273
aVIt's being built as we speak
p274
aVand it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York.
p275
aVI have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers.
p276
aVWhen I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away.
p277
aVThis is what goes on in my studio everyday.
p278
aVI walk \u2014 I'm traveling. I come back.
p279
aVSome guy's got that on a computer \u2014 there's this like, oh my goodness.
p280
aVSo I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio.
p281
aVThis kind of effervescent \u2014
p282
aVfully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas.
p283
aa(lp284
VSingle-surface products.
p285
aVFurniture's a good one.
p286
aVHow you grow legs out of a surface.
p287
aVI would love to build this one day
p288
aVand perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour, sugar,
p289
aVpolymer, wood chips \u2014 I don't know, human hair.
p290
aVI don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time.
p291
aVThat's the weird side coming out again. A lot of companies don't understand that.
p292
aa(lp293
VThree weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo.
p294
aVThey said, "Give us the dream. What is our dream? How do we beat Apple?"
p295
aVI said, "You don't copy Apple, that's for sure.
p296
aVYou get into biopolymers."
p297
aVThey looked straight through me.
p298
aVWhat a waste. Anyway.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VNo, it's true. Fuck them. You know, I mean \u2014
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VI'm delivering; they're not taking.
p307
aVI've had this image 20 years.
p308
aVI've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.
p309
aVThat is an image of a car for me.
p310
aVThat's the car of the future. It's a water droplet.
p311
aVI've been banging on about this like I can't believe.
p312
aVCars are all wrong.
p313
aa(lp314
VI'm going to show you something a bit weird now.
p315
aVThey laughed everywhere over the world I showed this.
p316
aVThe only place that didn't laugh was Moscow.
p317
aVCars are made from 30,000 components.
p318
aVHow ridiculous is that? Couldn't you make that from 300?
p319
aVIt's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan.
p320
aVEverything's holistically integrated. It opens and closes like a bread bin.
p321
aVThere is no engine. There's a solar panel on the back
p322
aVand there are batteries in the wheels; they're fitted like Formula 1.
p323
aVYou take them off your wall, you plug them in. Off you go.
p324
aVA three-wheeled car: slow, feminine,
p325
aVtransparent, so you can see the people in there.
p326
aVYou drive different.
p327
aVYou see that thing. You do. You do.
p328
aVAnd not anesthetized, separated from life.
p329
aVThere's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that.
p330
aVIt's a city car. You drive along. You get out.
p331
aVYou drive on to a proboscis. You get out.
p332
aVIt lifts you up.
p333
aVIt presents the solar panel to the sun, and at night, it's a street lamp.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Applause)
p336
aa(lp337
VThat's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first,
p338
aVand do the car second.
p339
aVI can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages,
p340
aVfloating around on the ground, driven by AI.
p341
aVWhen I showed this in South Africa,
p342
aVeverybody afterwards was going, "Hey, car on a stick. Like this."
p343
aVCan you imagine? A car on a stick.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VIf you put it next to contemporary architecture,
p348
aVit feels totally natural to me.
p349
aVAnd that's what I do with my furniture.
p350
aVI'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore.
p351
aVI'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture.
p352
aVI'm trying to build transportation systems.
p353
aVI work on aircraft for Airbus,
p354
aVI do all this sort of stuff
p355
aVtrying to force these natural, inspired-by-nature dreams home.
p356
aa(lp357
VI'm going to finish on two things.
p358
aVThis is the stereolithography of a staircase.
p359
aVIt's a little bit of a dedication to James, James Watson.
p360
aVI built this thing for my studio.
p361
aVIt cost me 250,000 dollars to build this.
p362
aVMost people go and buy the Aston Martin.
p363
aVI built this.
p364
aVThis is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex.
p365
aVTook about two years, because I'm looking for fat-free design.
p366
aVLean, efficient things. Healthy products.
p367
aVThis is built by composites.
p368
aVIt's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element,
p369
aVand this is a carbon-fiber handrail which is only supported in two places.
p370
aVModern materials allow us to do modern things.
p371
aa(lp372
VThis is a shot in the studio.
p373
aVThis is how it looks pretty much every day.
p374
aVYou wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it.
p375
aVThere is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VWho cares?
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength.
p384
aVIt's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean.
p385
aVIt's in Notting Hill, next to all the crap \u2014
p386
aVthe prostitutes and all that stuff.
p387
aVIt's next to David Hockney's original studio.
p388
aVIt has a lighting system that changes throughout the day.
p389
aVMy guys go out for lunch. The door's open. They come back in,
p390
aVbecause it's normally raining and they prefer to stay in.
p391
aa(lp392
VThis is my studio.
p393
aVElephant skull from Oxford University, 1988.
p394
aVI bought that last year. They're very difficult to find.
p395
aVIf anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me,
p396
aVI'll put it in the studio.
p397
aa(lp398
VSo I'm just going to interject a little bit
p399
aVwith some of the things that you'll see in the video.
p400
aVIt's a homemade video, made it myself at three o'clock in the morning
p401
aVjust to show you how my real world is.
p402
aVYou never see that.
p403
aVYou never see architects or designers showing you their real world.
p404
aa(lp405
VThis is called a "Plasnet."
p406
aVIt's a new bio-polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy.
p407
aa(lp408
VWorld's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars.
p409
aVWe should all be riding one of these.
p410
aVAs China buys all these crappy cars, we should be riding things like this.
p411
aVCounterbalance.
p412
aa(lp413
VLike I say, it's a cross
p414
aVbetween Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory.
p415
aVIt's full of prototypes and objects.
p416
aVIt's self-inspirational, again.
p417
aVI mean, the rare times when I'm there,
p418
aVI do enjoy it.
p419
aVAnd I get lots and lots of kids coming.
p420
aVI'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers \u2014 wankers.
p421
aVSorry.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Laughter)
p424
aa(lp425
VThat's a solar seed. It's a concept for new architecture.
p426
aVThat thing on the top is the world's first solar-powered garden lamp \u2014
p427
aVthe first produced.
p428
aVGiles Revell should be talking here today \u2014

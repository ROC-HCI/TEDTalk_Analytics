VSo I'd like you to come back with me
p5
aVjust for a few minutes
p6
aVto a dark night in China,
p7
aVthe night I met my husband.
p8
aVIt was a city so long ago that it was still called
p9
aVPeking.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo I went to a party.
p12
aVI sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man
p13
aVwith owl glasses and a bow tie,
p14
aVand he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar,
p15
aVthere in China specifically to study
p16
aVSino-Soviet relations.
p17
aVWhat a gift it was to the eager,
p18
aVyoung foreign correspondent that I was then.
p19
aVI'd pump him for information,
p20
aVI'm mentally scribbling notes
p21
aVfor the stories I plan to write.
p22
aVI talk to him for hours.
p23
aa(lp24
VOnly months later,
p25
aVI discover who he really was.
p26
aVHe was the China representative
p27
aVfor the American Soybean Association.
p28
aa(lp29
V"I don't understand. Soybeans?
p30
aVYou told me you were a Fulbright scholar."
p31
aa(lp32
V"Well, how long would you have talked to me
p33
aVif I told you we're in soybeans?"
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VI said, "You jerk."
p38
aVOnly jerk wasn't the word I used.
p39
aVI said, "You could've gotten me fired."
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd he said, "Let's get married."
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aV"Travel the world and have lots of kids."
p44
aVSo we did.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
V(Applause)
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley
p51
aVturned out to be.
p52
aVHe was a Chinese scholar
p53
aVwho later, in his 60s,
p54
aVgot a Ph.D. in Chinese history.
p55
aVHe spoke six languages,
p56
aVhe played 15 musical instruments,
p57
aVhe was a licensed pilot,
p58
aVhe had once been a San Francisco cable car operator,
p59
aVhe was an expert in swine nutrition,
p60
aVdairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir,
p61
aVand we did travel the country, and the world,
p62
aVand we did have a lot of kids.
p63
aVWe followed my job, and it seemed like
p64
aVthere was nothing that we couldn't do.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo when we found the cancer,
p67
aVit doesn't seem strange to us at all
p68
aVthat without saying a word to each other,
p69
aVwe believed that,
p70
aVif we were smart enough
p71
aVand strong enough and brave enough,
p72
aVand we worked hard enough,
p73
aVwe could keep him from dying ever.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.
p76
aVThe surgeon emerged from the surgery.
p77
aVWhat'd he say? He said what surgeons always say:
p78
aV"We got it all."
p79
aVThen there was a setback when the pathologists
p80
aVlooked at the kidney cancer closely.
p81
aVIt turned out to be a rare,
p82
aVexceedingly aggressive type,
p83
aVwith a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal
p84
aVin several weeks at most.
p85
aVAnd yet, he did not die.
p86
aVMysteriously, he lived on.
p87
aVHe coached Little League for our son.
p88
aVHe built a playhouse for our daughter.
p89
aVAnd meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet
p90
aVlooking for specialists.
p91
aVI'm looking for a cure.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo a year goes by
p94
aVbefore the cancer, as cancers do,
p95
aVreappears,
p96
aVand with it comes another death sentence,
p97
aVthis time nine months.
p98
aVSo we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.
p99
aVIt makes him so sick, he has to quit it,
p100
aVyet still he lives on.
p101
aVThen another year goes by.
p102
aVTwo years go by.
p103
aVMore specialists.
p104
aVWe take the kids to Italy.
p105
aVWe take the kids to Australia.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd then more years pass,
p108
aVand the cancer begins to grow.
p109
aVThis time, there's new treatments on the horizon.
p110
aVThey're exotic. They're experimental.
p111
aVThey're going to attack the cancer in new ways.
p112
aVSo he enters a clinical trial, and it works.
p113
aVThe cancer begins to shrink,
p114
aVand for the third time,
p115
aVwe've dodged death.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo now I ask you,
p118
aVhow do I feel
p119
aVwhen the time finally comes
p120
aVand there's another dark night,
p121
aVsometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?
p122
aVThis time it's on the intensive care ward
p123
aVwhen a twentysomething resident
p124
aVthat I've never met before
p125
aVtells me that Terence is dying,
p126
aVperhaps tonight.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo what do I say when he says,
p129
aV"What do you want me to do?"
p130
aa(lp131
VThere's another drug out there.
p132
aVIt's newer. It's more powerful.
p133
aVHe started it just two weeks ago.
p134
aVPerhaps there's still hope ahead.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo what do I say?
p137
aa(lp138
VI say, "Keep him alive if you can."
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd Terence died six days later.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.
p143
aVIt was an exhilarating fight,
p144
aVand I'd repeat the fight today
p145
aVwithout a moment's hesitation.
p146
aVWe fought together, we lived together.
p147
aVIt turned what could have been
p148
aVseven of the grimmest years of our life
p149
aVinto seven of the most glorious.
p150
aVIt was also an expensive fight.
p151
aVIt was the kind of fight and the kind of choices
p152
aVthat everyone here agrees
p153
aVpump up the cost of end-of-life care,
p154
aVand of healthcare for all of us.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd for me, for us,
p157
aVwe pushed the fight right over the edge,
p158
aVand I never got the chance to say to him
p159
aVwhat I say to him now almost every day:
p160
aV"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."
p161
aVWe never got the chance to say goodbye.
p162
aVWe never thought it was the end.
p163
aVWe always had hope.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo what do we make of all of this?
p166
aa(lp167
VBeing a journalist, after Terence died,
p168
aVI wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."
p169
aVI wrote it because I wanted to know
p170
aVwhy I did what I did,
p171
aVwhy he did what he did,
p172
aVwhy everyone around us did what they did.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd what did I discover?
p175
aVWell, one of the things I discovered is that
p176
aVexperts think that one answer to
p177
aVwhat I did at the end was a piece of paper,
p178
aVthe advance directive,
p179
aVto help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.
p180
aVYet I had that piece of paper.
p181
aVWe both did.
p182
aVAnd they were readily available.
p183
aVI had them right at hand.
p184
aVBoth of them said the same thing:
p185
aVDo nothing if there is no further hope.
p186
aVI knew Terence's wishes
p187
aVas clearly and as surely as I knew my own.
p188
aa(lp189
VYet we never got to no further hope.
p190
aVEven with that clear-cut paper in our hands,
p191
aVwe just kept redefining hope.
p192
aVI believed I could keep him from dying,
p193
aVand I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen
p194
aVso many people and have talked to so many people
p195
aVwho have felt exactly the same way.
p196
aVRight up until days before his death,
p197
aVI felt strongly
p198
aVand powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,
p199
aVthat I could keep him from dying ever.
p200
aa(lp201
VNow, what do the experts call this?
p202
aVThey say it's denial.
p203
aVIt's a strong word, isn't it?
p204
aVYet I will tell you that denial
p205
aVisn't even close to a strong enough word
p206
aVto describe what those of us
p207
aVfacing the death of our loved ones go through.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd I hear the medical professionals say,
p210
aV"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,
p211
aVbut the family's in denial.
p212
aVThe family won't listen to reason.
p213
aVThey're in denial.
p214
aVHow can they insist on this treatment at the end?
p215
aVIt's so clear, yet they're in denial."
p216
aa(lp217
VNow, I think this maybe isn't
p218
aVa very useful way of thinking.
p219
aVIt's not just families either.
p220
aVThe medical professionals too,
p221
aVyou out there, you're in denial too.
p222
aVYou want to help. You want to fix.
p223
aVYou want to do.
p224
aVYou've succeeded in everything you've done,
p225
aVand having a patient die,
p226
aVwell, that must feel like failure.
p227
aa(lp228
VI saw it firsthand.
p229
aVJust days before Terence died,
p230
aVhis oncologist said,
p231
aV"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."
p232
aVDays before he died.
p233
aa(lp234
VYet Ira Byock,
p235
aVthe director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth
p236
aVsaid, "You know, the best doctor in the world
p237
aVhas never succeeded in making anyone immortal."
p238
aa(lp239
VSo what the experts call "denial," I call "hope,"
p240
aVand I'd like to borrow a phrase
p241
aVfrom my friends in software design.
p242
aVYou just redefine denial and hope,
p243
aVand it becomes a feature of being human.
p244
aVIt's not a bug.
p245
aVIt's a feature.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VSo we need to think more constructively
p250
aVabout this very common, very profound
p251
aVand very powerful human emotion.
p252
aVIt's part of the human condition,
p253
aVand yet our system and our thinking
p254
aVisn't built to accommodate it.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,
p257
aVand I believed it.
p258
aVMaybe I wanted to believe it.
p259
aVAnd during Terence's illness, I, we,
p260
aVwe wanted to believe the story
p261
aVof our fight together too.
p262
aVGiving up the fight \u2014 for that's how it felt,
p263
aVit felt like giving up \u2014
p264
aVmeant giving up not only his life
p265
aVbut also our story,
p266
aVour story of us as fighters,
p267
aVthe story of us as invincible,
p268
aVand for the doctors, the story of themselves
p269
aVas healers.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo what do we need?
p272
aa(lp273
VMaybe we don't need a new piece of paper.
p274
aVMaybe we need a new story,
p275
aVnot a story about giving up the fight
p276
aVor of hopelessness,
p277
aVbut rather a story of victory and triumph,
p278
aVof a valiant battle and, eventually,
p279
aVa graceful retreat,
p280
aVa story that acknowledges
p281
aVthat not even the greatest general defeats every foe,
p282
aVthat no doctor has ever succeeded
p283
aVin making anyone immortal,
p284
aVand that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,
p285
aVhas ever stopped even the bravest,
p286
aVwittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband
p287
aVfrom dying when it was his time to go.
p288
aa(lp289
VPeople did mention hospice,
p290
aVbut I wouldn't listen.
p291
aVHospice was for people who were dying,
p292
aVand Terence wasn't dying.
p293
aVAs a result, he spent just four days in hospice,
p294
aVwhich I'm sure, as you all know,
p295
aVis a pretty typical outcome,
p296
aVand we never said goodbye
p297
aVbecause we were unprepared for the end.
p298
aa(lp299
VWe have a noble path to curing the disease,
p300
aVpatients and doctors alike,
p301
aVbut there doesn't seem to be
p302
aVa noble path to dying.
p303
aVDying is seen as failing,
p304
aVand we had a heroic narrative
p305
aVfor fighting together,
p306
aVbut we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo maybe we need a narrative
p309
aVfor acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,
p310
aVand maybe our new story will be
p311
aVabout a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.
p312
aVTerence loved poetry,
p313
aVand the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy
p314
aVis one of my favorite poets.
p315
aVSo I'll give you a couple lines from him.
p316
aVThis is a poem about Mark Antony.
p317
aVYou know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,
p318
aVCleopatra's guy?
p319
aVActually, one of Cleopatra's guys.
p320
aVAnd he's been a pretty good general.
p321
aVHe's won all the fights,
p322
aVhe's eluded all the people that are out to get him,
p323
aVand yet this time, finally,
p324
aVhe's come to the city of Alexandria
p325
aVand realized he's lost.
p326
aVThe people are leaving. They're playing instruments.
p327
aVThey're singing.
p328
aVAnd suddenly he knows he's been defeated.
p329
aVAnd he suddenly knows
p330
aVhe's been deserted by the gods,
p331
aVand it's time to let go.
p332
aVAnd the poet tells him what to do.
p333
aVHe tells him how to say a noble goodbye,
p334
aVa goodbye that's fit for a hero.
p335
aa(lp336
V"As if long-prepared,
p337
aVas if courageous,
p338
aVas it becomes you
p339
aVwho were worthy of such a city,
p340
aVapproach the window with a firm step,
p341
aVand with emotion,
p342
aVbut not with the entreaties
p343
aVor the complaints of a coward,
p344
aVas a last enjoyment,
p345
aVlisten to the sounds,
p346
aVthe exquisite instruments of the musical troops,
p347
aVand bid her farewell,
p348
aVthe Alexandria you are losing."
p349
aa(lp350
VThat's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,
p351
aVa goodbye for a man
p352
aVfor whom anything,
p353
aVwell, almost anything,
p354
aVwas possible,
p355
aVa goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd isn't that what we're missing?
p358
aVHow can we learn that people's decisions
p359
aVabout their loved ones
p360
aVare often based strongly, powerfully,
p361
aVmany times irrationally,
p362
aVon the slimmest of hopes?
p363
aVThe overwhelming presence of hope
p364
aVisn't denial.
p365
aVIt's part of our DNA as humans,
p366
aVand maybe it's time our healthcare system \u2014
p367
aVdoctors, patients, insurance companies, us,
p368
aVstarted accounting for the power of that hope.
p369
aVHope isn't a bug.
p370
aVIt's a feature.
p371
aa(lp372
VThank you.
p373

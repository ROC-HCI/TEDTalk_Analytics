VI do want to test this question we're all interested in:
p5
aVDoes extinction have to be forever?
p6
aa(lp7
VI'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about.
p8
aVOne is the Thylacine Project.
p9
aVThe other one is the Lazarus Project,
p10
aVand that's focused on the gastric-brooding frog.
p11
aVAnd it would be a fair question to ask,
p12
aVwhy have we focused on these two animals?
p13
aVWell, point number one, each of them represents a unique family of its own.
p14
aVWe've lost a whole family.
p15
aVThat's a big chunk of the global genome gone.
p16
aVI'd like it back.
p17
aVThe second reason is that we killed these things.
p18
aVIn the case of the thylacine, regrettably, we shot every one that we saw.
p19
aVWe slaughtered them.
p20
aVIn the case of the gastric-brooding frog, we may have "fungicided" it to death.
p21
aVThere's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world
p22
aVthat's called the chytrid fungus,
p23
aVand it's nailing frogs all over the world.
p24
aVWe think that's probably what got this frog,
p25
aVand humans are spreading this fungus.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd this introduces a very important ethical point,
p28
aVand I think you will have heard this many times
p29
aVwhen this topic comes up.
p30
aVWhat I think is important
p31
aVis that, if it's clear that we exterminated these species,
p32
aVthen I think we not only have a moral obligation
p33
aVto see what we can do about it,
p34
aVbut I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something, if we can.
p35
aa(lp36
VOK. Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project.
p37
aVIt's a frog. And you think, frog.
p38
aVYeah, but this was not just any frog.
p39
aVUnlike a normal frog, which lays its eggs in the water
p40
aVand goes away and wishes its froglets well,
p41
aVthis frog swallowed its fertilized eggs,
p42
aVswallowed them into the stomach, where it should be having food,
p43
aVdidn't digest the eggs, and turned its stomach into a uterus.
p44
aVIn the stomach, the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles,
p45
aVand in the stomach, the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs,
p46
aVand they grew in the stomach
p47
aVuntil eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart.
p48
aVIt has a little cough and a hiccup, and out comes sprays of little frogs.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, when biologists saw this, they were agog.
p51
aVThey thought, this is incredible.
p52
aVNo animal, let alone a frog, has been known to do this,
p53
aVto change one organ in the body into another.
p54
aVAnd you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well.
p55
aVIf we could understand
p56
aVhow that frog is managing the way its tummy works,
p57
aVis there information here that we need to understand
p58
aVor could usefully use to help ourselves?
p59
aVNow, I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach,
p60
aVbut I am suggesting it's possible
p61
aVwe might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut.
p62
aVAnd just as everybody got excited about it, bang!
p63
aVIt was extinct.
p64
aa(lp65
VI called up my friend,
p66
aVProfessor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide.
p67
aVHe was the last person who had this frog, a colony of these things, in his lab.
p68
aVAnd I said, "Mike, by any chance \u2014" This was 30 or 40 years ago.
p69
aV"By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog?"
p70
aVAnd he thought about it,
p71
aVand he went to his deep freezer, minus 20 degrees centigrade,
p72
aVand he poured through everything in the freezer,
p73
aVand there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs.
p74
aa(lp75
VThis was very exciting,
p76
aVbut there was no reason why we should expect that this would work,
p77
aVbecause this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it,
p78
aVcryoprotectants, to look after it when it was frozen.
p79
aVAnd normally, when water freezes, as you know, it expands,
p80
aVand the same thing happens in a cell.
p81
aVIf you freeze tissues, the water expands, damages or bursts the cell walls.
p82
aVWell, we looked at the tissue under the microscope.
p83
aVIt actually didn't look bad. The cell walls looked intact.
p84
aVSo we thought, let's give it a go.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhat we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation.
p87
aVWe took the eggs of a related species, a living frog,
p88
aVand we inactivated the nucleus of the egg.
p89
aVWe used ultraviolet radiation to do that.
p90
aVAnd then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog
p91
aVand we inserted those nuclei into that egg.
p92
aVNow, by rights, this is kind of like a cloning project,
p93
aVlike what produced Dolly,
p94
aVbut it's actually very different,
p95
aVbecause Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells.
p96
aVThat was a miracle, but it was workable.
p97
aVWhat we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species
p98
aVand put it into a completely different species and expect that to work.
p99
aVWell, we had no real reason to expect it would,
p100
aVand we tried hundreds and hundreds of these.
p101
aVAnd just last February, the last time we did these trials,
p102
aa(lp103
VI saw a miracle starting to happen.
p104
aVWhat we found was most of these eggs didn't work,
p105
aVbut then suddenly, one of them began to divide.
p106
aVThat was so exciting.
p107
aVAnd then the egg divided again. And then again.
p108
aVAnd pretty soon, we had early-stage embryos
p109
aVwith hundreds of cells forming those.
p110
aVWe even DNA-tested some of these cells,
p111
aVand the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells.
p112
aVSo we're very excited. This is not a tadpole. It's not a frog.
p113
aVBut it's a long way along the journey
p114
aVto producing, or bringing back, an extinct species.
p115
aVAnd this is news.
p116
aVWe haven't announced this publicly before.
p117
aVWe're excited.
p118
aVWe've got to get past this point.
p119
aVWe now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate,
p120
aVto turn in so that it will produce the other tissues.
p121
aVIt'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog.
p122
aVWatch this space.
p123
aVI think we're going to have this frog hopping
p124
aVglad to be back in the world again.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VThank you.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VWe haven't done it yet, but keep the applause ready.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project.
p135
aVThe thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog,
p136
aVor maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes.
p137
aVBut it's not related to any of those. It's a marsupial.
p138
aVIt raised its young in a pouch, like a koala or a kangaroo would do,
p139
aVand it has a long history, a long, fascinating history,
p140
aVthat goes back 25 million years.
p141
aVBut it's also a tragic history.
p142
aa(lp143
VThe first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia
p144
aVabout 25 million years ago,
p145
aVand the National Geographic Society
p146
aVis helping us to explore these fossil deposits.
p147
aVThis is Riversleigh.
p148
aVIn those fossil rocks are some amazing animals.
p149
aVWe found marsupial lions.
p150
aVWe found carnivorous kangaroos.
p151
aVIt's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo,
p152
aVbut these are meat-eating kangaroos.
p153
aVWe found the biggest bird in the world,
p154
aVbigger than that thing that was in Madagascar,
p155
aVand it too was a flesh eater.
p156
aVIt was a giant, weird duck.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd crocodiles were not behaving at that time either.
p159
aVYou think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing,
p160
aVsitting in a pool of water.
p161
aVThese crocodiles were actually out on the land
p162
aVand they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground.
p163
aVWe had, in Australia, drop crocs. They really do exist.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VBut what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals
p168
aVbut also thylacines.
p169
aVThere were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests,
p170
aVand they ranged from great big ones to middle-sized ones
p171
aVto one that was about the size of a chihuahua.
p172
aVParis Hilton would have been able
p173
aVto carry one of these things around in a little handbag,
p174
aVuntil a drop croc landed on her.
p175
aa(lp176
VAt any rate, it was a fascinating place,
p177
aVbut unfortunately, Australia didn't stay this way.
p178
aVClimate change has affected the world for a long period of time,
p179
aVand gradually, the forests disappeared, the country began to dry out,
p180
aVand the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline,
p181
aVuntil by five million years ago,
p182
aVonly one left.
p183
aVBy 10,000 years ago, they had disappeared from New Guinea,
p184
aVand unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago, somebodies, we don't know who this was,
p185
aVintroduced dingoes \u2014 this is a very archaic kind of a dog \u2014
p186
aVinto Australia.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd as you can see,
p189
aVdingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines.
p190
aVThat similarity meant they probably competed.
p191
aVThey were eating the same kinds of foods.
p192
aVIt's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets,
p193
aVand therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival.
p194
aVAll we know is, soon after the dingoes were brought in,
p195
aVthylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland,
p196
aVand after that they only survived in Tasmania.
p197
aa(lp198
VThen, unfortunately,
p199
aVthe next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in 1788,
p200
aVand they brought with them the things they valued,
p201
aVand that included sheep.
p202
aVThey took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania,
p203
aVand they thought, hang on, this is not going to work.
p204
aVThat guy is going to eat all our sheep.
p205
aVThat was not what happened, actually.
p206
aVWild dogs did eat a few of the sheep, but the thylacine got a bad rap.
p207
aVBut immediately, the government said, that's it, let's get rid of them,
p208
aVand they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw.
p209
aVBy the early 1930s,
p210
aV3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered.
p211
aVIt was a disaster, and they were about to hit the wall.
p212
aa(lp213
VHave a look at this bit of film footage.
p214
aVIt makes me very sad because, while it's a fascinating animal,
p215
aVand it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it
p216
aVbefore it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction,
p217
aVwe didn't, unfortunately, at this same time,
p218
aVhave a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species.
p219
aVThese are photos of the last surviving thylacine, Benjamin,
p220
aVwho was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart.
p221
aVTo add insult to injury,
p222
aVhaving swept this species nearly off the table,
p223
aVthis animal, when it died of neglect \u2014
p224
aVThe keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.
p225
aVIt died of exposure, and in the morning, when they found the body of Benjamin,
p226
aVthey still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump.
p227
aa(lp228
VDoes it have to stay this way?
p229
aVIn 1990, I was in the Australian Museum.
p230
aVI was fascinated by thylacines.
p231
aVI've always been obsessed with these animals.
p232
aVAnd I was studying skulls,
p233
aVtrying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals,
p234
aVand I saw this jar,
p235
aVand here, in the jar, was a little girl thylacine pup,
p236
aVperhaps six months old.
p237
aVThe guy who had found it and killed the mother
p238
aVhad pickled the pup, and they pickled it in alcohol.
p239
aVI'm a paleontologist, but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut this was 1990, and I asked my geneticist friends,
p242
aVcouldn't we think about going into this pup
p243
aVand extracting DNA, if it's there,
p244
aVand then somewhere down the line in the future,
p245
aVwe'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back?
p246
aVThe geneticists laughed. But this was six years before Dolly.
p247
aVCloning was science fiction.
p248
aVIt had not happened.
p249
aVBut then suddenly cloning did happen.
p250
aVAnd I thought, when I became director of the Australian Museum,
p251
aVI'm going to give this a go.
p252
aa(lp253
VI put a team together.
p254
aVWe went into that pup to see what was in it,
p255
aVand we did find thylacine DNA.
p256
aVIt was a eureka moment. We were very excited.
p257
aVUnfortunately, we also found a lot of human DNA.
p258
aVEvery old curator who'd been in that museum
p259
aVhad seen this wonderful specimen,
p260
aVput their hand in the jar, pulled it out and thought,
p261
aV"Wow, look at that," plop, dropped it back in the jar,
p262
aVcontaminating this specimen.
p263
aVAnd that was a worry.
p264
aVIf the goal here was to get the DNA out
p265
aVand use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back,
p266
aVwhat we didn't want happening
p267
aVwhen the information was shoved into the machine
p268
aVand the wheel turned around and the lights flashed,
p269
aVwas to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine.
p270
aVIt would've kept the curator very happy, but it wasn't going to keep us happy.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo we went back to these specimens and we started digging around,
p273
aVand particularly, we looked into the teeth of skulls,
p274
aVhard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers,
p275
aVand we found much better quality DNA.
p276
aVWe found nuclear mitochondrial genes.
p277
aVIt's there. So we got it.
p278
aa(lp279
VOK. What could we do with this stuff?
p280
aVWell, George Church, in his book, "Regenesis,"
p281
aVhas mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing
p282
aVto work with fragmented DNA.
p283
aVWe would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form,
p284
aVand then, much like we've done with the Lazarus Project,
p285
aVget that stuff into an egg of a host species.
p286
aVIt has to be a different species. What could it be?
p287
aVWhy couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?
p288
aVThey're related, distantly, to thylacines.
p289
aVAnd then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end.
p290
aa(lp291
VCritics of this project say, hang on.
p292
aVThylacine, Tasmanian devil? That's going to hurt.
p293
aVNo, it's not. These are marsupials.
p294
aVThey give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean.
p295
aVThat Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth.
p296
aVIt is, shortly, going to think
p297
aVit's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world,
p298
aVso maybe it'll need some help to keep it going.
p299
aa(lp300
VAndrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated
p301
aVthis might not be a waste of time.
p302
aVAnd it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet,
p303
aVbut it's the kind of thing we want to think about.
p304
aVThey took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA
p305
aVand they spliced it into a mouse genome,
p306
aVbut they put a tag on it
p307
aVso that anything that this thylacine DNA produced
p308
aVwould appear blue-green in the mouse baby.
p309
aVIn other words, if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA,
p310
aVit would be able to be recognized.
p311
aVWhen the baby popped up, it was filled with blue-green tissues.
p312
aVAnd that tells us if we can get that genome back together,
p313
aVget it into a live cell,
p314
aVit's going to produce thylacine stuff.
p315
aa(lp316
VIs this a risk?
p317
aVYou've taken the bits of one animal
p318
aVand you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal.
p319
aVAre we going to get a Frankenstein? Some kind of weird hybrid chimera?
p320
aVAnd the answer is no.
p321
aVIf the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA,
p322
aVthat's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil.
p323
aa(lp324
VOK, if we can do this, could we put it back?
p325
aVThis is a key question for everybody.
p326
aVDoes it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?
p327
aVCould we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania,
p328
aVrestore that ecosystem?
p329
aVOr has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible?
p330
aVI've been to Tasmania.
p331
aVI've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common.
p332
aVI've even spoken to people, like Peter Carter here,
p333
aVwho when I spoke to him, was 90 years old,
p334
aVbut in 1926, this man and his father and his brother
p335
aVcaught thylacines.
p336
aVThey trapped them.
p337
aVAnd when I spoke to this man, I was looking in his eyes and thinking,
p338
aV"Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like,
p339
aVwhat they smelled like, what they sounded like."
p340
aVHe led them around on a rope.
p341
aVHe has personal experiences
p342
aVthat I would give my left leg to have in my head.
p343
aVWe'd all love to have this sort of thing happen.
p344
aVAnyway, I asked Peter, by any chance,
p345
aVcould he take us back to where he caught those thylacines.
p346
aVMy interest was in whether the environment had changed.
p347
aVHe thought hard. It was nearly 80 years before this that he'd been at this hut.
p348
aa(lp349
VAt any rate, he led us down this bush track,
p350
aVand there, right where he remembered,
p351
aVwas the hut,
p352
aVand tears came into his eyes.
p353
aVHe looked at the hut. We went inside.
p354
aVThere were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut
p355
aVwhere he and his father and his brother had slept at night.
p356
aVAnd he told me, as it all was flooding back in memories.
p357
aVHe said, "I remember the thylacines going around the hut
p358
aVwondering what was inside,"
p359
aVand he said they made sounds like "Yip! Yip! Yip!"
p360
aVAll of these are parts of his life and what he remembers.
p361
aVAnd the key question for me was to ask Peter, has it changed?
p362
aVAnd he said no.
p363
aVThe southern beech forests surrounded his hut
p364
aVjust like it was when he was there in 1926.
p365
aVThe grasslands were sweeping away.
p366
aVThat's classic thylacine habitat.
p367
aVAnd the animals in those areas were the same that were there
p368
aVwhen the thylacine was around.
p369
aVSo could we put it back? Yes.
p370
aa(lp371
VIs that all we would do? And this is an interesting question.
p372
aVSometimes you might be able to put it back,
p373
aVbut is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again?
p374
aVAnd I don't think so.
p375
aVI think gradually, as we see species all around the world,
p376
aVit's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild.
p377
aVWe'd love to think it is, but we know it isn't.
p378
aVWe need other parallel strategies coming online.
p379
aVAnd this one interests me.
p380
aVSome of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos,
p381
aVsanctuaries, even at the museums,
p382
aVhad collar marks on the neck.
p383
aVThey were being kept as pets,
p384
aVand we know a lot of bush tales and memories
p385
aVof people who had them as pets,
p386
aVand they say they were wonderful, friendly.
p387
aVThis particular one
p388
aVcame in out of the forest to lick this boy
p389
aVand curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep.
p390
aVA wild animal.
p391
aa(lp392
VAnd I'd like to ask the question. We need to think about this.
p393
aVIf it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then,
p394
aVwould the thylacine be extinct now?
p395
aVAnd I'm positive it wouldn't.
p396
aVWe need to think about this in today's world.
p397
aVCould it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them,
p398
aVmaybe they won't go extinct?
p399
aVAnd this is such a critical issue for us
p400
aVbecause if we don't do that,
p401
aVwe're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice.
p402
aa(lp403
VAs far as I'm concerned,
p404
aVthis is why we're trying to do these kinds of de-extinction projects.
p405
aVWe are trying to restore that balance of nature
p406
aVthat we have upset.
p407
aa(lp408
VThank you.

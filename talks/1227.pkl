VErez Lieberman Aiden: Everyone knows
p5
aVthat a picture is worth a thousand words.
p6
aVBut we at Harvard
p7
aVwere wondering if this was really true.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVSo we assembled a team of experts,
p10
aVspanning Harvard, MIT,
p11
aVThe American Heritage Dictionary, The Encyclopedia Britannica
p12
aVand even our proud sponsors,
p13
aVthe Google.
p14
aVAnd we cogitated about this
p15
aVfor about four years.
p16
aVAnd we came to a startling conclusion.
p17
aVLadies and gentlemen, a picture is not worth a thousand words.
p18
aVIn fact, we found some pictures
p19
aVthat are worth 500 billion words.
p20
aa(lp21
VJean-Baptiste Michel: So how did we get to this conclusion?
p22
aVSo Erez and I were thinking about ways
p23
aVto get a big picture of human culture
p24
aVand human history: change over time.
p25
aVSo many books actually have been written over the years.
p26
aVSo we were thinking, well the best way to learn from them
p27
aVis to read all of these millions of books.
p28
aVNow of course, if there's a scale for how awesome that is,
p29
aVthat has to rank extremely, extremely high.
p30
aVNow the problem is there's an X-axis for that,
p31
aVwhich is the practical axis.
p32
aVThis is very, very low.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Applause)
p35
aa(lp36
VNow people tend to use an alternative approach,
p37
aVwhich is to take a few sources and read them very carefully.
p38
aVThis is extremely practical, but not so awesome.
p39
aVWhat you really want to do
p40
aVis to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space.
p41
aVSo it turns out there was a company across the river called Google
p42
aVwho had started a digitization project a few years back
p43
aVthat might just enable this approach.
p44
aVThey have digitized millions of books.
p45
aVSo what that means is, one could use computational methods
p46
aVto read all of the books in a click of a button.
p47
aVThat's very practical and extremely awesome.
p48
aa(lp49
VELA: Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from.
p50
aVSince time immemorial, there have been authors.
p51
aVThese authors have been striving to write books.
p52
aVAnd this became considerably easier
p53
aVwith the development of the printing press some centuries ago.
p54
aVSince then, the authors have won
p55
aVon 129 million distinct occasions,
p56
aVpublishing books.
p57
aVNow if those books are not lost to history,
p58
aVthen they are somewhere in a library,
p59
aVand many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries
p60
aVand digitized by Google,
p61
aVwhich has scanned 15 million books to date.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow when Google digitizes a book, they put it into a really nice format.
p64
aVNow we've got the data, plus we have metadata.
p65
aVWe have information about things like where was it published,
p66
aVwho was the author, when was it published.
p67
aVAnd what we do is go through all of those records
p68
aVand exclude everything that's not the highest quality data.
p69
aVWhat we're left with
p70
aVis a collection of five million books,
p71
aV500 billion words,
p72
aVa string of characters a thousand times longer
p73
aVthan the human genome \u2014
p74
aVa text which, when written out,
p75
aVwould stretch from here to the Moon and back
p76
aV10 times over \u2014
p77
aVa veritable shard of our cultural genome.
p78
aVOf course what we did
p79
aVwhen faced with such outrageous hyperbole ...
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVwas what any self-respecting researchers
p82
aVwould have done.
p83
aVWe took a page out of XKCD,
p84
aVand we said, "Stand back.
p85
aVWe're going to try science."
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VJM: Now of course, we were thinking,
p90
aVwell let's just first put the data out there
p91
aVfor people to do science to it.
p92
aVNow we're thinking, what data can we release?
p93
aVWell of course, you want to take the books
p94
aVand release the full text of these five million books.
p95
aVNow Google, and Jon Orwant in particular,
p96
aVtold us a little equation that we should learn.
p97
aVSo you have five million, that is, five million authors
p98
aVand five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit.
p99
aVSo, although that would be really, really awesome,
p100
aVagain, that's extremely, extremely impractical.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VNow again, we kind of caved in,
p104
aVand we did the very practical approach, which was a bit less awesome.
p105
aVWe said, well instead of releasing the full text,
p106
aVwe're going to release statistics about the books.
p107
aVSo take for instance "A gleam of happiness."
p108
aVIt's four words; we call that a four-gram.
p109
aVWe're going to tell you how many times a particular four-gram
p110
aVappeared in books in 1801, 1802, 1803,
p111
aVall the way up to 2008.
p112
aVThat gives us a time series
p113
aVof how frequently this particular sentence was used over time.
p114
aVWe do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books,
p115
aVand that gives us a big table of two billion lines
p116
aVthat tell us about the way culture has been changing.
p117
aa(lp118
VELA: So those two billion lines,
p119
aVwe call them two billion n-grams.
p120
aVWhat do they tell us?
p121
aVWell the individual n-grams measure cultural trends.
p122
aVLet me give you an example.
p123
aVLet's suppose that I am thriving,
p124
aVthen tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did.
p125
aVAnd so I might say, "Yesterday, I throve."
p126
aVAlternatively, I could say, "Yesterday, I thrived."
p127
aVWell which one should I use?
p128
aVHow to know?
p129
aa(lp130
VAs of about six months ago,
p131
aVthe state of the art in this field
p132
aVis that you would, for instance,
p133
aVgo up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair,
p134
aVand you'd say,
p135
aV"Steve, you're an expert on the irregular verbs.
p136
aVWhat should I do?"
p137
aVAnd he'd tell you, "Well most people say thrived,
p138
aVbut some people say throve."
p139
aVAnd you also knew, more or less,
p140
aVthat if you were to go back in time 200 years
p141
aVand ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair,
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aV"Tom, what should I say?"
p144
aVHe'd say, "Well, in my day, most people throve,
p145
aVbut some thrived."
p146
aVSo now what I'm just going to show you is raw data.
p147
aVTwo rows from this table of two billion entries.
p148
aVWhat you're seeing is year by year frequency
p149
aVof "thrived" and "throve" over time.
p150
aVNow this is just two
p151
aVout of two billion rows.
p152
aVSo the entire data set
p153
aVis a billion times more awesome than this slide.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
VJM: Now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words.
p160
aVFor instance, this one.
p161
aVIf you just take influenza,
p162
aVyou will see peaks at the time where you knew
p163
aVbig flu epidemics were killing people around the globe.
p164
aa(lp165
VELA: If you were not yet convinced,
p166
aVsea levels are rising,
p167
aVso is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature.
p168
aa(lp169
VJM: You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram,
p170
aVand that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead,
p171
aValthough you might agree that he might need a better publicist.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VELA: You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing.
p176
aVFor instance, let me tell you the history
p177
aVof the year 1950.
p178
aVPretty much for the vast majority of history,
p179
aVno one gave a damn about 1950.
p180
aVIn 1700, in 1800, in 1900,
p181
aVno one cared.
p182
aVThrough the 30s and 40s,
p183
aVno one cared.
p184
aVSuddenly, in the mid-40s,
p185
aVthere started to be a buzz.
p186
aVPeople realized that 1950 was going to happen,
p187
aVand it could be big.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVBut nothing got people interested in 1950
p190
aVlike the year 1950.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVPeople were walking around obsessed.
p193
aVThey couldn't stop talking
p194
aVabout all the things they did in 1950,
p195
aVall the things they were planning to do in 1950,
p196
aVall the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950.
p197
aVIn fact, 1950 was so fascinating
p198
aVthat for years thereafter,
p199
aVpeople just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened,
p200
aVin '51, '52, '53.
p201
aVFinally in 1954,
p202
aVsomeone woke up and realized
p203
aVthat 1950 had gotten somewhat passé.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVAnd just like that, the bubble burst.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd the story of 1950
p210
aVis the story of every year that we have on record,
p211
aVwith a little twist, because now we've got these nice charts.
p212
aVAnd because we have these nice charts, we can measure things.
p213
aVWe can say, "Well how fast does the bubble burst?"
p214
aVAnd it turns out that we can measure that very precisely.
p215
aVEquations were derived, graphs were produced,
p216
aVand the net result
p217
aVis that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster
p218
aVwith each passing year.
p219
aVWe are losing interest in the past more rapidly.
p220
aa(lp221
VJM: Now a little piece of career advice.
p222
aVSo for those of you who seek to be famous,
p223
aVwe can learn from the 25 most famous political figures,
p224
aVauthors, actors and so on.
p225
aVSo if you want to become famous early on, you should be an actor,
p226
aVbecause then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s \u2014
p227
aVyou're still young, it's really great.
p228
aVNow if you can wait a little bit, you should be an author,
p229
aVbecause then you rise to very great heights,
p230
aVlike Mark Twain, for instance: extremely famous.
p231
aVBut if you want to reach the very top,
p232
aVyou should delay gratification
p233
aVand, of course, become a politician.
p234
aVSo here you will become famous by the end of your 50s,
p235
aVand become very, very famous afterward.
p236
aVSo scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older.
p237
aVLike for instance, biologists and physics
p238
aVtend to be almost as famous as actors.
p239
aVOne mistake you should not do is become a mathematician.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVIf you do that,
p242
aVyou might think, "Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s."
p243
aVBut guess what, nobody will really care.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VELA: There are more sobering notes
p248
aVamong the n-grams.
p249
aVFor instance, here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall,
p250
aVan artist born in 1887.
p251
aVAnd this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person.
p252
aVHe gets more and more and more famous,
p253
aVexcept if you look in German.
p254
aVIf you look in German, you see something completely bizarre,
p255
aVsomething you pretty much never see,
p256
aVwhich is he becomes extremely famous
p257
aVand then all of a sudden plummets,
p258
aVgoing through a nadir between 1933 and 1945,
p259
aVbefore rebounding afterward.
p260
aVAnd of course, what we're seeing
p261
aVis the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist
p262
aVin Nazi Germany.
p263
aa(lp264
VNow these signals
p265
aVare actually so strong
p266
aVthat we don't need to know that someone was censored.
p267
aVWe can actually figure it out
p268
aVusing really basic signal processing.
p269
aVHere's a simple way to do it.
p270
aVWell, a reasonable expectation
p271
aVis that somebody's fame in a given period of time
p272
aVshould be roughly the average of their fame before
p273
aVand their fame after.
p274
aVSo that's sort of what we expect.
p275
aVAnd we compare that to the fame that we observe.
p276
aVAnd we just divide one by the other
p277
aVto produce something we call a suppression index.
p278
aVIf the suppression index is very, very, very small,
p279
aVthen you very well might be being suppressed.
p280
aVIf it's very large, maybe you're benefiting from propaganda.
p281
aa(lp282
VJM: Now you can actually look at
p283
aVthe distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations.
p284
aVSo for instance, here \u2014
p285
aVthis suppression index is for 5,000 people
p286
aVpicked in English books where there's no known suppression \u2014
p287
aVit would be like this, basically tightly centered on one.
p288
aVWhat you expect is basically what you observe.
p289
aVThis is distribution as seen in Germany \u2014
p290
aVvery different, it's shifted to the left.
p291
aVPeople talked about it twice less as it should have been.
p292
aVBut much more importantly, the distribution is much wider.
p293
aVThere are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution
p294
aVwho are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been.
p295
aVBut then also many people on the far right
p296
aVwho seem to benefit from propaganda.
p297
aVThis picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record.
p298
aa(lp299
VELA: So culturomics
p300
aVis what we call this method.
p301
aVIt's kind of like genomics.
p302
aVExcept genomics is a lens on biology
p303
aVthrough the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome.
p304
aVCulturomics is similar.
p305
aVIt's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis
p306
aVto the study of human culture.
p307
aVHere, instead of through the lens of a genome,
p308
aVthrough the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record.
p309
aVThe great thing about culturomics
p310
aVis that everyone can do it.
p311
aVWhy can everyone do it?
p312
aVEveryone can do it because three guys,
p313
aVJon Orwant, Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google,
p314
aVsaw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer,
p315
aVand they said, "This is so fun.
p316
aVWe have to make this available for people."
p317
aVSo in two weeks flat \u2014 the two weeks before our paper came out \u2014
p318
aVthey coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public.
p319
aVAnd so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in
p320
aVand see its n-gram immediately \u2014
p321
aValso browse examples of all the various books
p322
aVin which your n-gram appears.
p323
aa(lp324
VJM: Now this was used over a million times on the first day,
p325
aVand this is really the best of all the queries.
p326
aVSo people want to be their best, put their best foot forward.
p327
aVBut it turns out in the 18th century, people didn't really care about that at all.
p328
aVThey didn't want to be their best, they wanted to be their beft.
p329
aVSo what happened is, of course, this is just a mistake.
p330
aVIt's not that strove for mediocrity,
p331
aVit's just that the S used to be written differently, kind of like an F.
p332
aVNow of course, Google didn't pick this up at the time,
p333
aVso we reported this in the science article that we wrote.
p334
aVBut it turns out this is just a reminder
p335
aVthat, although this is a lot of fun,
p336
aVwhen you interpret these graphs, you have to be very careful,
p337
aVand you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences.
p338
aa(lp339
VELA: People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes.
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aVActually, we're not going to have to talk,
p342
aVwe're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent.
p343
aVThis person was interested in the history of frustration.
p344
aVThere's various types of frustration.
p345
aVIf you stub your toe, that's a one A "argh."
p346
aVIf the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons
p347
aVto make room for an interstellar bypass,
p348
aVthat's an eight A "aaaaaaaargh."
p349
aVThis person studies all the "arghs,"
p350
aVfrom one through eight A's.
p351
aVAnd it turns out
p352
aVthat the less-frequent "arghs"
p353
aVare, of course, the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating \u2014
p354
aVexcept, oddly, in the early 80s.
p355
aVWe think that might have something to do with Reagan.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VJM: There are many usages of this data,
p360
aVbut the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized.
p361
aVGoogle has started to digitize 15 million books.
p362
aVThat's 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published.
p363
aVIt's a sizable chunk of human culture.
p364
aVThere's much more in culture: there's manuscripts, there newspapers,
p365
aVthere's things that are not text, like art and paintings.
p366
aVThese all happen to be on our computers,
p367
aVon computers across the world.
p368
aVAnd when that happens, that will transform the way we have
p369
aVto understand our past, our present and human culture.
p370
aa(lp371
VThank you very much.

His research focusses on using large volumes of data as tools that help better understand the world around us -- from the way diseases progress in patients over years, to the way cultures change in human societies over centuries. With his colleague Erez Lieberman Aiden, Jean-Baptiste is a Founding Director of Harvard&#39;s Cultural Observatory, where their research team pioneers the use of quantitative methods for the study of human culture, language and history.

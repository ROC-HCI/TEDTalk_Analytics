VTen years ago,
p5
aVI got a phone call that changed my life.
p6
aVAt the time, I was  cardiologist at UCLA,
p7
aVspecializing in cardiac  imaging techniques.
p8
aVThe call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo.
p9
aVAn elderly female chimpanzee
p10
aVhad woken up with a facial droop
p11
aVand the veterinarians were worried that she'd had a stroke.
p12
aVThey asked if I'd  come to the zoo
p13
aVand image the animal's heart
p14
aVto look for a possible cardiac cause.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, to be clear, North American zoos are staffed
p17
aVby highly qualified,  board-certified veterinarians
p18
aVwho take outstanding  care of their animal patients.
p19
aVBut occasionally, they do reach into  the human medical community,
p20
aVparticularly for some  speciality consultation,
p21
aVand I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help.
p22
aVI had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee
p23
aVand make sure that this gorilla  didn't have a torn aorta,
p24
aVevaluate this macaw for a heart murmur,
p25
aVmake sure that this California sea lion's paricardium wasn't inflamed,
p26
aVand in this picture, I'm listening to the heart of a lion
p27
aVafter a lifesaving,  collaborative procedure
p28
aVwith veterinarians and physicians
p29
aVwhere we drained 700 cc's of  fluid from the sac
p30
aVin which this lion's  heart was contained.
p31
aVAnd this procedure, which I have done on many human patients,
p32
aVwas identical, with the exception of that paw and that tail.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow most of the time, I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians,
p35
aVdiscussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments
p36
aVfor my human patients,
p37
aVbut some of the time, I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo
p38
aVwith veterinarians, discussing  symptoms and diagnoses and treatments
p39
aVfor their animal patients.
p40
aVAnd occasionally, on  the very same day,
p41
aVI went on rounds at  UCLA Medical Center
p42
aVand at the Los Angeles Zoo.
p43
aVAnd here's what started coming into very clear focus for me.
p44
aVPhysicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care
p45
aVof the same disorders in their  animal and human patients:
p46
aVcongestive heart failure, brain tumors,
p47
aVleukemia, diabetes,  arthritis, ALS, breast cancer,
p48
aVeven psychiatric syndromes like depression, anxiety,
p49
aVcompulsions, eating disorders and self-injury.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, I've got a confession to make.
p52
aVEven though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology
p53
aVas an undergrad \u2014
p54
aVI had even written my senior  thesis on Darwinian theory \u2014
p55
aVlearning about the  significant overlap
p56
aVbetween the disorders of  animals and humans,
p57
aVit came as a much needed  wake-up call for me.
p58
aVSo I started wondering, with all of these overlaps,
p59
aVhow was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian,
p60
aVor consult the veterinary literature,
p61
aVfor insights into one  of my human patients?
p62
aVWhy had I never, nor had any of my  physician friends and colleagues
p63
aVwhom I asked, ever attended  a veterinary conference?
p64
aVFor that matter, why was  any of this a surprise?
p65
aVI mean, look, every single physician accepts some biological connection
p66
aVbetween animals and humans.
p67
aVEvery medication that we prescribe or that we've taken ourselves
p68
aVor we've given to our families
p69
aVhas first been tested on an animal.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut there's something very different
p72
aVabout giving an animal a  medication or a human disease
p73
aVand the animal developing  congestive heart failure
p74
aVor diabetes or breast cancer  on their own.
p75
aVNow, maybe some of the surprise
p76
aVcomes from the increasing separation in our world
p77
aVbetween the urban and the nonurban.
p78
aVYou know, we hear about these city kids
p79
aVwho think that wool grows on trees
p80
aVor that cheese comes from a plant.
p81
aVWell, today's human hospitals,
p82
aVincreasingly, are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology.
p83
aVAnd this creates a psychological distance between the human patients
p84
aVwho are being treated there
p85
aVand animal patients who are living in oceans
p86
aVand farms and jungles.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut I think there's an  even deeper reason.
p89
aVPhysicians and scientists, we accept intellectually that our species,
p90
aVHomo sapiens, is merely  one species,
p91
aVno more unique or special than any other.
p92
aVBut in our hearts, we don't  completely believe that.
p93
aVI feel it myself when I'm  listening to Mozart
p94
aVor looking at pictures of the  Mars Rover on my MacBook.
p95
aVI feel that tug of  human exceptionalism,
p96
aVeven as I recognize the  scientifically isolating cost
p97
aVof seeing ourselves as a superior species, apart.
p98
aVWell, I'm trying these days.
p99
aVWhen I see a human patient now, I always ask,
p100
aVwhat do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don't know?
p101
aVAnd, might I be taking better  care of my human patient
p102
aVif I saw them as a human animal patient?
p103
aa(lp104
VHere are a few examples of the  kind of exciting connections
p105
aVthat this kind of  thinking has led me to.
p106
aVFear-induced heart failure.
p107
aVAround the year 2000,
p108
aVhuman cardiologists "discovered" emotionally induced heart failure.
p109
aVIt was described in a gambling father  who had lost his life's savings
p110
aVwith a roll of the dice,
p111
aVin a bride who'd been left at the alter.
p112
aVBut it turns out, this  "new" human diagnosis
p113
aVwas neither new, nor was it uniquely human.
p114
aVVeterinarians had been diagnosing,  treating and even preventing
p115
aVemotionally induced symptoms in animals
p116
aVranging from monkeys to flamingos, from to deer to rabbits,
p117
aVsince the 1970s.
p118
aVHow many human lives  might have been saved
p119
aVif this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands
p120
aVof E.R. docs and cardiologists?
p121
aa(lp122
VSelf-injury.
p123
aVSome human patients  harm themselves.
p124
aVSome pluck out patches of hair,
p125
aVothers actually cut themselves.
p126
aVSome animal patients  also harm themselves.
p127
aVThere are birds that  pluck out feathers.
p128
aVThere are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed.
p129
aVBut veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways
p130
aVof treating and even preventing self-injury
p131
aVin their self-injuring animals.
p132
aVShouldn't this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands
p133
aVof psychotherapists and  parents and patients
p134
aVstruggling with self-injury?
p135
aa(lp136
VPostpartum depression and  postpartum psychosis.
p137
aVSometimes, soon after giving birth,
p138
aVsome women become depressed,
p139
aVand sometimes they become seriously  depressed and even psychotic.
p140
aVThey may neglect their newborn,
p141
aVand in some extreme cases,
p142
aVeven harm the child.
p143
aVEquine veterinarians also know that occasionally,
p144
aVa mare, soon after giving birth,
p145
aVwill neglect the foal, refusing to nurse,
p146
aVand in some instances, kick the foal, even to death.
p147
aVBut veterinarians have devised
p148
aVan intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome
p149
aVthat involves increasing  oxytocin in the mare.
p150
aVOxytocin is the bonding hormone,
p151
aVand this leads to renewed interest,
p152
aVon the part of the mare, in her foal.
p153
aVShouldn't this information
p154
aVbe put into the hands of ob/gyn's
p155
aVand family doctors and patients
p156
aVwho are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis?
p157
aa(lp158
VWell, despite all of this promise,
p159
aVunfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large.
p160
aVTo explain it, I'm afraid I'm going  to have to air some dirty laundry.
p161
aVSome physicians can be real snobs
p162
aVabout doctors who are not M.D.'s.
p163
aVI'm talking about dentists and  optometrists and psychologists,
p164
aVbut maybe especially animal doctors.
p165
aVOf course, most physicians don't realize that it is harder
p166
aVto get into vet school these days than medical school,
p167
aVand that when we go  to medical school,
p168
aVwe learn everything  there is to know
p169
aVabout one species, Homo sapiens,
p170
aVbut veterinarians need to learn about health and disease
p171
aVin mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish and birds.
p172
aVSo I don't blame the vets for feeling annoyed
p173
aVby my profession's condescension and ignorance.
p174
aVBut here's one from the vets:
p175
aVWhat do you call a veterinarian
p176
aVwho can only take  care of one species?
p177
aVA physician. (Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VClosing the gap has become  a passion for me,
p180
aVand I'm doing this  through programs
p181
aVlike Darwin on Rounds at UCLA,
p182
aVwhere we're bringing animal experts  and evolutionary biologists
p183
aVand embedding them on our medical teams
p184
aVwith our interns and our residents.
p185
aVAnd through Zoobiquity conferences,
p186
aVwhere we bring medical schools  together with veterinary schools
p187
aVfor collabortive discussions
p188
aVof the shared diseases and disorders
p189
aVof animal and human patients.
p190
aVAt Zoobiquity conferences,
p191
aVparticipants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger
p192
aVcan help us better treat breast cancer
p193
aVin a kindergarten teacher;
p194
aVhow understanding polycystic overies in a Holstein cow
p195
aVcan help us better take care
p196
aVof a dance instructor  with painful periods;
p197
aVand how better understanding the  treatment of separation anxiety
p198
aVin a high-strung Sheltie
p199
aVcan help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school.
p200
aa(lp201
VIn the United States and now  internationally, at Zoobiquity conferences
p202
aVphysicians and veterinarians check  their attitudes and their preconceptions
p203
aVat the door and come  together as colleagues,
p204
aVas peers, as doctors.
p205
aVAfter all, we humans  are animals, too,
p206
aVand it's time for us physicians to embrace
p207
aVour patients' and our own animal natures
p208
aVand join veterinarians
p209
aVin a species-spanning approach to health.
p210
aa(lp211
VBecause it turns out,
p212
aVsome of the best and  most humanistic medicine
p213
aVis being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human.
p214
aVAnd one of the best ways  we can take care
p215
aVof the human patient is by  paying close attention
p216
aVto how all the other  patients on the planet
p217
aVlive, grow, get sick and heal.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Applause).

Natterson-Horowitz is a cardiologist whose patients include gorillas, lions, wallabies and humans.

In 2012, she co-authored the book <a href=\\"http://geni.us/zoobiquity\\"><em>Zoobiquity: The Astonishing Connection Between Human and Animal Health</em></a>, advocating a &ldquo;One Health&rdquo; approach to medicine.

VI'm a storyteller.
p5
aVThat's what I do in life \u2014 telling stories,
p6
aVwriting novels \u2014
p7
aVand today I would like to tell you a few stories
p8
aVabout the art of storytelling
p9
aVand also some supernatural creatures
p10
aVcalled the djinni.
p11
aVBut before I go there, please allow me to share with you
p12
aVglimpses of my personal story.
p13
aVI will do so with the help of words, of course,
p14
aVbut also a geometrical shape, the circle,
p15
aVso throughout my talk,
p16
aVyou will come across several circles.
p17
aa(lp18
VI was born in Strasbourg, France
p19
aVto Turkish parents.
p20
aVShortly after, my parents got separated,
p21
aVand I came to Turkey with my mom.
p22
aVFrom then on, I was raised
p23
aVas a single child by a single mother.
p24
aVNow in the early 1970s, in Ankara,
p25
aVthat was a bit unusual.
p26
aVOur neighborhood was full of large families,
p27
aVwhere fathers were the heads of households,
p28
aVso I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee
p29
aVin a patriarchal environment.
p30
aVIn fact, I grew up observing
p31
aVtwo different kinds of womanhood.
p32
aVOn the one hand was my mother,
p33
aVa well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman.
p34
aVOn the other hand was my grandmother,
p35
aVwho also took care of me
p36
aVand was more spiritual, less educated
p37
aVand definitely less rational.
p38
aVThis was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future
p39
aVand melted lead into mysterious shapes
p40
aVto fend off the evil eye.
p41
aa(lp42
VMany people visited my grandmother,
p43
aVpeople with severe acne on their faces
p44
aVor warts on their hands.
p45
aVEach time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic,
p46
aVtake a red apple and stab it
p47
aVwith as many rose thorns
p48
aVas the number of warts she wanted to remove.
p49
aVThen one by one, she would
p50
aVencircle these thorns with dark ink.
p51
aVA week later, the patient would come back
p52
aVfor a follow-up examination.
p53
aVNow, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things
p54
aVin front of an audience of scholars and scientists,
p55
aVbut the truth is, of all the people
p56
aVwho visited my grandmother for their skin conditions,
p57
aVI did not see anyone go back
p58
aVunhappy or unhealed.
p59
aVI asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying?
p60
aVIn response she said, "Yes, praying is effective,
p61
aVbut also beware of the power of circles."
p62
aa(lp63
VFrom her, I learned, amongst many other things,
p64
aVone very precious lesson \u2014
p65
aVthat if you want to destroy something in this life,
p66
aVbe it an acne, a blemish
p67
aVor the human soul,
p68
aVall you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.
p69
aVIt will dry up inside.
p70
aVNow we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.
p71
aVWe all do.
p72
aVWe're born into a certain family, nation, class.
p73
aVBut if we have no connection whatsoever
p74
aVwith the worlds beyond the one we take for granted,
p75
aVthen we too run the risk
p76
aVof drying up inside.
p77
aVOur imagination might shrink;
p78
aVour hearts might dwindle,
p79
aVand our humanness might wither
p80
aVif we stay for too long
p81
aVinside our cultural cocoons.
p82
aVOur friends, neighbors, colleagues, family \u2014
p83
aVif all the people in our inner circle resemble us,
p84
aVit means we are surrounded
p85
aVwith our mirror image.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey
p88
aVis to cover mirrors with velvet
p89
aVor to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out.
p90
aVIt's an old Eastern tradition
p91
aVbased on the knowledge that it's not healthy
p92
aVfor a human being to spend too much time
p93
aVstaring at his own reflection.
p94
aVIronically, [living in] communities of the like-minded
p95
aVis one of the greatest dangers
p96
aVof today's globalized world.
p97
aVAnd it's happening everywhere,
p98
aVamong liberals and conservatives,
p99
aVagnostics and believers, the rich and the poor,
p100
aVEast and West alike.
p101
aVWe tend to form clusters
p102
aVbased on similarity,
p103
aVand then we produce stereotypes
p104
aVabout other clusters of people.
p105
aVIn my opinion, one way of transcending
p106
aVthese cultural ghettos
p107
aVis through the art of storytelling.
p108
aVStories cannot demolish frontiers,
p109
aVbut they can punch holes in our mental walls.
p110
aVAnd through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other,
p111
aVand sometimes even like what we see.
p112
aa(lp113
VI started writing fiction at the age of eight.
p114
aVMy mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook
p115
aVand asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal.
p116
aVIn retrospect, I think she was slightly worried
p117
aVabout my sanity.
p118
aVI was constantly telling stories at home, which was good,
p119
aVexcept I told this to imaginary friends around me,
p120
aVwhich was not so good.
p121
aVI was an introverted child,
p122
aVto the point of communicating with colored crayons
p123
aVand apologizing to objects
p124
aVwhen I bumped into them,
p125
aVso my mother thought it might do me good
p126
aVto write down my day-to-day experiences
p127
aVand emotions.
p128
aVWhat she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring,
p129
aVand the last thing I wanted to do
p130
aVwas to write about myself.
p131
aVInstead, I began to write about people other than me
p132
aVand things that never really happened.
p133
aVAnd thus began my life-long passion
p134
aVfor writing fiction.
p135
aVSo from the very beginning, fiction for me
p136
aVwas less of an autobiographical manifestation
p137
aVthan a transcendental journey
p138
aVinto other lives, other possibilities.
p139
aVAnd please bear with me:
p140
aVI'll draw a circle and come back to this point.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow one other thing happened around this same time.
p143
aVMy mother became a diplomat.
p144
aVSo from this small, superstitious,
p145
aVmiddle-class neighborhood of my grandmother,
p146
aVI was zoomed into this
p147
aVposh, international school [in Madrid],
p148
aVwhere I was the only Turk.
p149
aVIt was here that I had my first encounter
p150
aVwith what I call the "representative foreigner."
p151
aVIn our classroom, there were children from all nationalities,
p152
aVyet this diversity did not necessarily lead
p153
aVto a cosmopolitan, egalitarian
p154
aVclassroom democracy.
p155
aVInstead, it generated an atmosphere
p156
aVin which each child was seen \u2014
p157
aVnot as an individual on his own,
p158
aVbut as the representative of something larger.
p159
aVWe were like a miniature United Nations, which was fun,
p160
aVexcept whenever something negative,
p161
aVwith regards to a nation
p162
aVor a religion, took place.
p163
aVThe child who represented it was mocked,
p164
aVridiculed and bullied endlessly.
p165
aVAnd I should know, because during the time I attended that school,
p166
aVa military takeover happened in my country,
p167
aVa gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope,
p168
aVand Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VI skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor
p172
aVduring those days.
p173
aVI also had my first taste
p174
aVof cultural stereotypes there.
p175
aVThe other children asked me about the movie
p176
aV"Midnight Express," which I had not seen;
p177
aVthey inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked,
p178
aVbecause they thought all Turks were heavy smokers,
p179
aVand they wondered at what age
p180
aVI would start covering my hair.
p181
aVI came to learn that these were
p182
aVthe three main stereotypes about my country:
p183
aVpolitics, cigarettes
p184
aVand the veil.
p185
aVAfter Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany
p186
aVand Ankara again.
p187
aVEverywhere I went, I felt like
p188
aVmy imagination was the only suitcase
p189
aVI could take with me.
p190
aVStories gave me a sense of center,
p191
aVcontinuity and coherence,
p192
aVthe three big Cs that I otherwise lacked.
p193
aa(lp194
VIn my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul,
p195
aVthe city I adore.
p196
aVI lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood
p197
aVwhere I wrote several of my novels.
p198
aVI was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit
p199
aVin 1999.
p200
aVWhen I ran out of the building at three in the morning,
p201
aVI saw something that stopped me in my tracks.
p202
aVThere was the local grocer there \u2014
p203
aVa grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol
p204
aVand didn't speak to marginals.
p205
aVHe was sitting next to a transvestite
p206
aVwith a long black wig
p207
aVand mascara running down her cheeks.
p208
aVI watched the man open a pack of cigarettes
p209
aVwith trembling hands
p210
aVand offer one to her,
p211
aVand that is the image of the night of the earthquake
p212
aVin my mind today \u2014
p213
aVa conservative grocer and a crying transvestite
p214
aVsmoking together on the sidewalk.
p215
aVIn the face of death and destruction,
p216
aVour mundane differences evaporated,
p217
aVand we all became one
p218
aVeven if for a few hours.
p219
aVBut I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us.
p220
aVI'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake,
p221
aVbut when we are reading a good novel,
p222
aVwe leave our small, cozy apartments behind,
p223
aVgo out into the night alone
p224
aVand start getting to know people we had never met before
p225
aVand perhaps had even been biased against.
p226
aa(lp227
VShortly after, I went
p228
aVto a women's college in Boston, then Michigan.
p229
aVI experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift,
p230
aVas a linguistic one.
p231
aVI started writing fiction in English.
p232
aVI'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile \u2014
p233
aVthey ask me why I do this \u2014
p234
aVbut the commute between languages
p235
aVgives me the chance to recreate myself.
p236
aVI love writing in Turkish,
p237
aVwhich to me is very poetic and very emotional,
p238
aVand I love writing in English, which to me
p239
aVis very mathematical and cerebral.
p240
aVSo I feel connected to each language in a different way.
p241
aVFor me, like millions of other people
p242
aVaround the world today,
p243
aVEnglish is an acquired language.
p244
aVWhen you're a latecomer to a language,
p245
aVwhat happens is you live there
p246
aVwith a continuous
p247
aVand perpetual frustration.
p248
aVAs latecomers, we always want to say more, you know,
p249
aVcrack better jokes, say better things,
p250
aVbut we end up saying less
p251
aVbecause there's a gap between the mind and the tongue.
p252
aVAnd that gap is very intimidating.
p253
aVBut if we manage not to be frightened by it,
p254
aVit's also stimulating.
p255
aVAnd this is what I discovered in Boston \u2014
p256
aVthat frustration was very stimulating.
p257
aa(lp258
VAt this stage, my grandmother,
p259
aVwho had been watching the course of my life
p260
aVwith increasing anxiety,
p261
aVstarted to include in her daily prayers
p262
aVthat I urgently get married
p263
aVso that I could settle down once and for all.
p264
aVAnd because God loves her, I did get married.
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aVBut instead of settling down,
p267
aVI went to Arizona.
p268
aVAnd since my husband is in Istanbul,
p269
aVI started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul \u2014
p270
aVthe two places on the surface of earth
p271
aVthat couldn't be more different.
p272
aVI guess one part of me has always been a nomad,
p273
aVphysically and spiritually.
p274
aVStories accompany me,
p275
aVkeeping my pieces and memories together,
p276
aVlike an existential glue.
p277
aa(lp278
VYet as much as I love stories,
p279
aVrecently, I've also begun to think
p280
aVthat they lose their magic
p281
aVif and when a story is seen as more than a story.
p282
aVAnd this is a subject that I would love
p283
aVto think about together.
p284
aVWhen my first novel written in English came out in America,
p285
aVI heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.
p286
aV"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently."
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVI asked him what he meant by that.
p289
aVHe said, "Well, look at it. There's so many
p290
aVSpanish, American, Hispanic characters in it,
p291
aVbut there's only one Turkish character and it's a man."
p292
aVNow the novel took place on a university campus in Boston,
p293
aVso to me, it was normal
p294
aVthat there be more international characters in it
p295
aVthan Turkish characters,
p296
aVbut I understood what my critic was looking for.
p297
aVAnd I also understood that I
p298
aVwould keep disappointing him.
p299
aVHe wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.
p300
aVHe was looking for a Turkish woman in the book
p301
aVbecause I happened to be one.
p302
aa(lp303
VWe often talk about how stories change the world,
p304
aVbut we should also see how the world of identity politics
p305
aVaffects the way stories
p306
aVare being circulated,
p307
aVread and reviewed.
p308
aVMany authors feel this pressure,
p309
aVbut non-Western authors feel it more heavily.
p310
aVIf you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me,
p311
aVthen you are expected to write
p312
aVthe stories of Muslim women
p313
aVand, preferably, the unhappy stories
p314
aVof unhappy Muslim women.
p315
aVYou're expected to write
p316
aVinformative, poignant and characteristic stories
p317
aVand leave the experimental and avant-garde
p318
aVto your Western colleagues.
p319
aVWhat I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid
p320
aVis happening in the literary world today.
p321
aVWriters are not seen
p322
aVas creative individuals on their own,
p323
aVbut as the representatives
p324
aVof their respective cultures:
p325
aVa few authors from China, a few from Turkey,
p326
aVa few from Nigeria.
p327
aVWe're all thought to have something very distinctive,
p328
aVif not peculiar.
p329
aa(lp330
VThe writer and commuter James Baldwin
p331
aVgave an interview in 1984
p332
aVin which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.
p333
aVWhen the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him
p334
aVas a gay writer,
p335
aVBaldwin stopped and said,
p336
aV"But don't you see? There's nothing in me
p337
aVthat is not in everybody else,
p338
aVand nothing in everybody else
p339
aVthat is not in me."
p340
aVWhen identity politics tries to put labels on us,
p341
aVit is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.
p342
aVThere's a fuzzy category called
p343
aVmulticultural literature
p344
aVin which all authors from outside the Western world
p345
aVare lumped together.
p346
aVI never forget my first multicultural reading,
p347
aVin Harvard Square about 10 years ago.
p348
aVWe were three writers, one from the Philippines,
p349
aVone Turkish and one Indonesian \u2014
p350
aVlike a joke, you know.
p351
aV(Laughter)
p352
aVAnd the reason why we were brought together
p353
aVwas not because we shared an artistic style
p354
aVor a literary taste.
p355
aVIt was only because of our passports.
p356
aVMulticultural writers are expected to tell real stories,
p357
aVnot so much the imaginary.
p358
aVA function is attributed to fiction.
p359
aVIn this way, not only the writers themselves,
p360
aVbut also their fictional characters
p361
aVbecome the representatives of something larger.
p362
aa(lp363
VBut I must quickly add
p364
aVthat this tendency to see a story
p365
aVas more than a story
p366
aVdoes not solely come from the West.
p367
aVIt comes from everywhere.
p368
aVAnd I experienced this firsthand
p369
aVwhen I was put on trial in 2005
p370
aVfor the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.
p371
aVI had intended to write
p372
aVa constructive, multi-layered novel
p373
aVabout an Armenian and a Turkish family
p374
aVthrough the eyes of women.
p375
aVMy micro story became a macro issue
p376
aVwhen I was prosecuted.
p377
aVSome people criticized, others praised me
p378
aVfor writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict.
p379
aVBut there were times when I wanted to remind both sides
p380
aVthat this was fiction.
p381
aVIt was just a story.
p382
aVAnd when I say, "just a story,"
p383
aVI'm not trying to belittle my work.
p384
aVI want to love and celebrate fiction
p385
aVfor what it is,
p386
aVnot as a means to an end.
p387
aa(lp388
VWriters are entitled to their political opinions,
p389
aVand there are good political novels out there,
p390
aVbut the language of fiction
p391
aVis not the language of daily politics.
p392
aVChekhov said,
p393
aV"The solution to a problem
p394
aVand the correct way of posing the question
p395
aVare two completely separate things.
p396
aVAnd only the latter is an artist's responsibility."
p397
aVIdentity politics divides us. Fiction connects.
p398
aVOne is interested in sweeping generalizations.
p399
aVThe other, in nuances.
p400
aVOne draws boundaries.
p401
aVThe other recognizes no frontiers.
p402
aVIdentity politics is made of solid bricks.
p403
aVFiction is flowing water.
p404
aa(lp405
VIn the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "meddah."
p406
aVThey would go to coffee houses,
p407
aVwhere they would tell a story in front of an audience,
p408
aVoften improvising.
p409
aVWith each new person in the story,
p410
aVthe meddah would change his voice,
p411
aVimpersonating that character.
p412
aVEverybody could go and listen, you know \u2014
p413
aVordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims.
p414
aVStories cut across all boundaries,
p415
aVlike "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja,"
p416
aVwhich were very popular throughout the Middle East,
p417
aVNorth Africa, the Balkans and Asia.
p418
aVToday, stories continue
p419
aVto transcend borders.
p420
aVWhen Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk,
p421
aVthey usually don't listen to each other,
p422
aVbut a Palestinian reader
p423
aVstill reads a novel by a Jewish author,
p424
aVand vice versa, connecting and empathizing
p425
aVwith the narrator.
p426
aVLiterature has to take us beyond.
p427
aVIf it cannot take us there,
p428
aVit is not good literature.
p429
aa(lp430
VBooks have saved the introverted,
p431
aVtimid child that I was \u2014 that I once was.
p432
aVBut I'm also aware of the danger
p433
aVof fetishizing them.
p434
aVWhen the poet and mystic, Rumi,
p435
aVmet his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz,
p436
aVone of the first things the latter did
p437
aVwas to toss Rumi's books into water
p438
aVand watch the letters dissolve.
p439
aVThe Sufis say, "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself
p440
aVis far worse than ignorance."
p441
aVThe problem with today's cultural ghettos
p442
aVis not lack of knowledge \u2014
p443
aVwe know a lot about each other, or so we think \u2014
p444
aVbut knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves:
p445
aVit makes us elitist,
p446
aVdistant and disconnected.
p447
aVThere's a metaphor which I love:
p448
aVliving like a drawing compass.
p449
aVAs you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place.
p450
aVMeanwhile, the other leg
p451
aVdraws a wide circle, constantly moving.
p452
aVLike that, my fiction as well.
p453
aVOne part of it is rooted in Istanbul,
p454
aVwith strong Turkish roots,
p455
aVbut the other part travels the world,
p456
aVconnecting to different cultures.
p457
aVIn that sense, I like to think of my fiction
p458
aVas both local and universal,
p459
aVboth from here and everywhere.
p460
aa(lp461
VNow those of you who have been to Istanbul
p462
aVhave probably seen Topkapi Palace,
p463
aVwhich was the residence of Ottoman sultans
p464
aVfor more than 400 years.
p465
aVIn the palace, just outside the quarters
p466
aVof the favorite concubines,
p467
aVthere's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.
p468
aVIt's between buildings.
p469
aVI'm intrigued by this concept.
p470
aVWe usually distrust those areas
p471
aVthat fall in between things.
p472
aVWe see them as the domain
p473
aVof supernatural creatures like the djinn,
p474
aVwho are made of smokeless fire
p475
aVand are the symbol of elusiveness.
p476
aVBut my point is perhaps
p477
aVthat elusive space
p478
aVis what writers and artists need most.
p479
aVWhen I write fiction
p480
aVI cherish elusiveness and changeability.
p481
aVI like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later.
p482
aVI like it when my characters surprise me.
p483
aVI might write about
p484
aVa Muslim woman in one novel,
p485
aVand perhaps it will be a very happy story,
p486
aVand in my next book, I might write
p487
aVabout a handsome, gay professor in Norway.
p488
aVAs long as it comes from our hearts,
p489
aVwe can write about anything and everything.
p490
aa(lp491
VAudre Lorde once said,
p492
aV"The white fathers taught us to say,
p493
aV'I think, therefore I am.'"
p494
aVShe suggested, "I feel, therefore I am free."
p495
aVI think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.
p496
aVAnd yet, why is it that,
p497
aVin creative writing courses today,
p498
aVthe very first thing we teach students is
p499
aV"write what you know"?
p500
aVPerhaps that's not the right way to start at all.
p501
aVImaginative literature is not necessarily about
p502
aVwriting who we are or what we know
p503
aVor what our identity is about.
p504
aVWe should teach young people and ourselves
p505
aVto expand our hearts
p506
aVand write what we can feel.
p507
aVWe should get out of our cultural ghetto
p508
aVand go visit the next one and the next.
p509
aa(lp510
VIn the end, stories move like whirling dervishes,
p511
aVdrawing circles beyond circles.
p512
aVThey connect all humanity,
p513
aVregardless of identity politics,
p514
aVand that is the good news.
p515
aVAnd I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem:
p516
aV"Come, let us be friends for once;
p517
aVlet us make life easy on us;
p518
aVlet us be lovers and loved ones;
p519
aVthe earth shall be left to no one."
p520
aa(lp521
VThank you.

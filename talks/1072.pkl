VI'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.
p5
aVThese are spinneret glands
p6
aVon the abdomen of a spider.
p7
aVThey produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,
p8
aVtougher than any fiber humans have ever made.
p9
aVThe nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.
p10
aVAnd to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,
p11
aVextremes of pressure and loads of pollution.
p12
aVAnd yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure
p13
aVwith raw materials of dead flies and water.
p14
aVIt does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.
p15
aVThis beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.
p16
aVThat's roughly 10,000 times the range
p17
aVof man-made fire detectors.
p18
aVAnd what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire
p19
aVconnected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver.
p22
aVIf we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,
p23
aVwe could achieve factor 10, factor 100,
p24
aVmaybe even factor 1,000 savings
p25
aVin resource and energy use.
p26
aVAnd if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution,
p27
aVI believe there are three really big changes
p28
aVwe need to bring about.
p29
aVFirstly, radical increases in resource efficiency.
p30
aVSecondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,
p31
aVpolluting way of using resources
p32
aVto a closed-loop model.
p33
aVAnd thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy
p34
aVto a solar economy.
p35
aVAnd for all three of these, I believe,
p36
aVbiomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.
p37
aa(lp38
VYou could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,
p39
aVand all of those have benefited
p40
aVfrom a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.
p41
aVAnd given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.
p42
aVSo I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.
p43
aVAnd let's start with radical increases
p44
aVin resource efficiency.
p45
aVWhen we were working on the Eden Project,
p46
aVwe had to create a very large greenhouse
p47
aVin a site that was not only irregular,
p48
aVbut it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.
p49
aVIt was a hell of a challenge,
p50
aVand it was actually examples from biology
p51
aVthat provided a lot of the clues.
p52
aVSo for instance,
p53
aVit was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form
p54
aVthat would work regardless of the final ground levels.
p55
aVStudying pollen grains
p56
aVand radiolaria and carbon molecules
p57
aVhelped us devise the most efficient structural solution
p58
aVusing hexagons and pentagons.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe next move was that we wanted
p61
aVto try and maximize the size of those hexagons.
p62
aVAnd to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,
p63
aVwhich is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.
p64
aVAnd in nature there are lots of examples
p65
aVof very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.
p66
aVSo we started exploring this material called ETFE.
p67
aVIt's a high-strength polymer.
p68
aVAnd what you do is you put it together in three layers,
p69
aVyou weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.
p70
aVAnd the great thing about this stuff
p71
aVis you can make it in units
p72
aVof roughly seven times the size of glass,
p73
aVand it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.
p74
aVSo that was a factor-100 saving.
p75
aVAnd what we found is that we got into a positive cycle
p76
aVin which one breakthrough facilitated another.
p77
aVSo with such large, lightweight pillows,
p78
aVwe had much less steel.
p79
aVWith less steel we were getting more sunlight in,
p80
aVwhich meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter.
p81
aVAnd with less overall weight in the superstructure,
p82
aVthere were big savings in the foundations.
p83
aVAnd at the end of the project we worked out
p84
aVthat the weight of that superstructure
p85
aVwas actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example
p88
aVof how ideas from biology
p89
aVcan lead to radical increases in resource efficiency \u2014
p90
aVdelivering the same function,
p91
aVbut with a fraction of the resource input.
p92
aVAnd actually there are loads of examples in nature
p93
aVthat you could turn to for similar solutions.
p94
aVSo for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures
p95
aVbased on giant Amazon water lilies,
p96
aVwhole buildings inspired by abalone shells,
p97
aVsuper-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.
p98
aVThere's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here
p99
aVusing nature as a design tool.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea.
p102
aVThe way we tend to use resources
p103
aVis we extract them,
p104
aVwe turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them.
p105
aVNature works very differently.
p106
aVIn ecosystems, the waste from one organism
p107
aVbecomes the nutrient for something else in that system.
p108
aVAnd there are some examples of projects
p109
aVthat have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems.
p110
aVAnd one of my favorites
p111
aVis called the Cardboard to Caviar Project
p112
aVby Graham Wiles.
p113
aVAnd in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants
p114
aVthat were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.
p115
aVIt was ending up in landfills.
p116
aVNow the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.
p117
aVAnd I'm just going to talk through this animation.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.
p120
aVThey then shredded the cardboard
p121
aVand sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.
p122
aVWhen that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.
p123
aVThey put it into worm recomposting systems,
p124
aVwhich produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,
p125
aVwhich produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.
p126
aVSo it transformed a linear process
p127
aVinto a closed-loop model,
p128
aVand it created more value in the process.
p129
aVGraham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,
p130
aVturning waste streams into schemes that create value.
p131
aVAnd just as natural systems
p132
aVtend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,
p133
aVthere's a real sense with this project
p134
aVthat the number of possibilities
p135
aVjust continue increasing.
p136
aVAnd I know it's a quirky example,
p137
aVbut I think the implications of this are quite radical,
p138
aVbecause it suggests that we could actually
p139
aVtransform a big problem \u2014 waste \u2014 into a massive opportunity.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd particularly in cities \u2014
p142
aVwe could look at the whole metabolism of cities,
p143
aVand look at those as opportunities.
p144
aVAnd that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about,
p145
aVthe Mobius Project,
p146
aVwhere we're trying to bring together a number of activities,
p147
aVall within one building,
p148
aVso that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another.
p149
aVAnd the kind of elements I'm talking about
p150
aVare, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,
p151
aVa bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.
p152
aVThen we would have an anaerobic digester,
p153
aVwhich could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,
p154
aVturn that into heat for the greenhouse
p155
aVand electricity to feed back into the grid.
p156
aVWe'd have a water treatment system
p157
aVtreating wastewater, turning that into fresh water
p158
aVand generating energy from the solids
p159
aVusing just plants and micro-organisms.
p160
aVWe'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen
p161
aVand worms from the compost
p162
aVand supplying fish back to the restaurant.
p163
aVAnd we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that
p164
aVcould be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo you can see that we're bringing together
p167
aVcycles of food, energy and water and waste
p168
aVall within one building.
p169
aVAnd just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London,
p170
aVwhich at the moment is a complete eyesore.
p171
aVSome of you may recognize this.
p172
aVAnd with just a little bit of planning,
p173
aVwe could transform a space dominated by traffic
p174
aVinto one that provides open space for people,
p175
aVreconnects people with food
p176
aVand transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo the final project I want to talk about
p179
aVis the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment.
p180
aVIt may come as a surprise to some of you
p181
aVto hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert
p182
aVwere actually forested a fairly short time ago.
p183
aVSo for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,
p184
aVhuge areas of North Africa
p185
aVwere covered in cedar and cypress forests.
p186
aVAnd during the evolution of life on the Earth,
p187
aVit was the colonization
p188
aVof the land by plants
p189
aVthat helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy.
p190
aVThe converse is also true.
p191
aVThe more vegetation we lose,
p192
aVthe more that's likely to exacerbate climate change
p193
aVand lead to further desertification.
p194
aVAnd this animation,
p195
aVthis shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,
p196
aVand what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts
p197
aVshift quite a lot,
p198
aVand that raises the question
p199
aVof whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions
p200
aVto halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd if you look at some of the organisms
p203
aVthat have evolved to live in deserts,
p204
aVthere are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.
p205
aVThis is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,
p206
aVand it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.
p207
aVThe way it does this is it comes out at night,
p208
aVcrawls to the top of a sand dune,
p209
aVand because it's got a matte black shell,
p210
aVis able to radiate heat out to the night sky
p211
aVand become slightly cooler than its surroundings.
p212
aVSo when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,
p213
aVyou get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell.
p214
aVJust before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,
p215
aVhas a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day.
p216
aVAnd the ingenuity, if you could call it that,
p217
aVgoes even further.
p218
aVBecause if you look closely at the beetle's shell,
p219
aVthere are lots of little bumps on that shell.
p220
aVAnd those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.
p221
aVBetween them there's a waxy finish which repels water.
p222
aVAnd the effect of this is that
p223
aVas the droplets start to form on the bumps,
p224
aVthey stay in tight, spherical beads,
p225
aVwhich means they're much more mobile
p226
aVthan they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.
p227
aVSo even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air,
p228
aVit's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.
p229
aVSo amazing example of an adaptation
p230
aVto a very resource-constrained environment \u2014
p231
aVand in that sense, very relevant
p232
aVto the kind of challenges we're going to be facing
p233
aVover the next few years, next few decades.
p234
aa(lp235
VWe're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.
p236
aVThis is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,
p237
aVand the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,
p238
aVand you trickle seawater over that
p239
aVso that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture
p240
aVand is cooled in the process.
p241
aVSo inside it's cool and humid,
p242
aVwhich means the plants need less water to grow.
p243
aVAnd then at the back of the greenhouse,
p244
aVit condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater
p245
aVin a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.
p246
aVAnd what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built
p247
aVwas it was producing slightly more freshwater
p248
aVthan it needed for the plants inside.
p249
aVSo they just started spreading this on the land around,
p250
aVand the combination of that and the elevated humidity
p251
aVhad quite a dramatic effect on the local area.
p252
aVThis photograph was taken on completion day,
p253
aVand just one year later, it looked like that.
p254
aVSo it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building
p255
aVturning barren land back into biologically productive land \u2014
p256
aVand in that sense, going beyond sustainable design
p257
aVto achieve restorative design.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo we were keen to scale this up
p260
aVand apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.
p261
aVAnd when you think about nature,
p262
aVoften you think about it as being all about competition.
p263
aVBut actually in mature ecosystems,
p264
aVyou're just as likely to find examples
p265
aVof symbiotic relationships.
p266
aVSo an important biomimicry principle
p267
aVis to find ways of bringing technologies together
p268
aVin symbiotic clusters.
p269
aVAnd the technology that we settled on
p270
aVas an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse
p271
aVis concentrated solar power,
p272
aVwhich uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat
p273
aVto create electricity.
p274
aVAnd just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,
p275
aVconsider that we receive
p276
aV10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year
p277
aVas we use in energy from all forms \u2014
p278
aV10,000 times.
p279
aVSo our energy problems are not intractable.
p280
aVIt's a challenge to our ingenuity.
p281
aVAnd the kind of synergies I'm talking about
p282
aVare, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts.
p283
aVCSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.
p284
aVThat's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.
p285
aVCSP produces a lot of waste heat.
p286
aVWe'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater
p287
aVand enhance the restorative benefits.
p288
aVAnd finally, in the shade under the mirrors,
p289
aVit's possible to grow all sorts of crops
p290
aVthat would not grow in direct sunlight.
p291
aVSo this is how this scheme would look.
p292
aVThe idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind.
p293
aVWe'd have concentrated solar power plants
p294
aVat intervals along the way.
p295
aa(lp296
VSome of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts.
p297
aVAnd with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource,
p298
aVyou don't think, "How am I going to dispose of this?"
p299
aVYou think, "What can I add to the system to create more value?"
p300
aVAnd it turns out
p301
aVthat different things crystallize out at different stages.
p302
aVWhen you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out
p303
aVis calcium carbonate.
p304
aVAnd that builds up on the evaporators \u2014
p305
aVand that's what that image on the left is \u2014
p306
aVgradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.
p307
aVSo after a while, we could take that out,
p308
aVuse it as a lightweight building block.
p309
aVAnd if you think about the carbon in that,
p310
aVthat would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea
p311
aVand then locked away in a building product.
p312
aa(lp313
VThe next thing is sodium chloride.
p314
aVYou can also compress that into a building block,
p315
aVas they did here.
p316
aVThis is a hotel in Bolivia.
p317
aVAnd then after that, there are all sorts
p318
aVof compounds and elements that we can extract,
p319
aVlike phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.
p320
aVAnd there's just about every element of the periodic table
p321
aVin seawater.
p322
aVSo it should be possible to extract valuable elements
p323
aVlike lithium for high-performance batteries.
p324
aVAnd in parts of the Arabian Gulf,
p325
aVthe seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily
p326
aVdue to the discharge of waste brine
p327
aVfrom desalination plants.
p328
aVAnd it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.
p329
aVNow we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.
p330
aVWe could evaporate it
p331
aVto enhance the restorative benefits
p332
aVand capture the salts,
p333
aVtransforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.
p334
aVReally the Sahara Forest Project is a model
p335
aVfor how we could create zero-carbon food,
p336
aVabundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet
p337
aVas well as reversing desertification in certain areas.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:
p340
aVradical increases in resource efficiency,
p341
aVclosing loops and a solar economy.
p342
aVThey're not just possible; they're critical.
p343
aVAnd I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems
p344
aVwill provide a lot of the solutions.
p345
aVBut perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides
p346
aVis a really positive way of talking about sustainable design.
p347
aVFar too much of the talk about the environment
p348
aVuses very negative language.
p349
aVBut here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing.
p350
aVAnd this is an important point.
p351
aa(lp352
VAntoine de Saint-Exupery once said,
p353
aV"If you want to build a flotilla of ships,
p354
aVyou don't sit around talking about carpentry.
p355
aVNo, you need to set people's souls ablaze
p356
aVwith visions of exploring distant shores."
p357
aVAnd that's what we need to do, so let's be positive,
p358
aVand let's make progress with what could be
p359
aVthe most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen.
p360
aa(lp361
VThank you.

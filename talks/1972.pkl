VPat Mitchell: That day,
p5
aVJanuary 8, 2011, began like all others.
p6
aVYou were both doing the work that you love.
p7
aVYou were meeting with constituents,
p8
aVwhich is something that you loved doing
p9
aVas a congresswoman,
p10
aVand Mark, you were happily preparing
p11
aVfor your next space shuttle.
p12
aVAnd suddenly, everything  that you had planned
p13
aVor expected in your lives
p14
aVwas irrevocably changed forever.
p15
aa(lp16
VMark Kelly: Yeah, it's amazing,
p17
aVit's amazing how  everything can change
p18
aVfor any of us in an instant.
p19
aVPeople don't realize that.
p20
aVI certainly didn't.
p21
aVGabby Giffords: Yes.
p22
aVMK: And on that Saturday morning,
p23
aVI got this horrible phone call
p24
aVfrom Gabby's chief of staff.
p25
aVShe didn't have much other information.
p26
aVShe just said, "Gabby was shot."
p27
aVA few minutes later, I called her back
p28
aVand I actually thought for a second,
p29
aVwell, maybe I just imagined  getting this phone call.
p30
aVI called her back, and  that's when she told me
p31
aVthat Gabby had been shot in the head.
p32
aVAnd from that point on,
p33
aVI knew that our lives were  going to be a lot different.
p34
aa(lp35
VPM: And when you arrived at the hospital,
p36
aVwhat was the prognosis that they gave you
p37
aVabout Gabby's condition  and what recovery, if any,
p38
aVyou could expect?
p39
aa(lp40
VMK: Well, for a gunshot wound to the head
p41
aVand a traumatic brain injury,
p42
aVthey typically can't tell you much.
p43
aVEvery injury is different. It's not predictable
p44
aVlike often a stroke might be predictable,
p45
aVwhich is another TBI kind of injury.
p46
aVSo they didn't know how long Gabby would be in a coma,
p47
aVdidn't know when that would change
p48
aVand what the prognosis would be.
p49
aa(lp50
VPM: Gabby, has your recovery
p51
aVbeen an effort to create  a new Gabby Giffords
p52
aVor reclaim the old Gabby Giffords?
p53
aa(lp54
VGG: The new one \u2014 better, stronger, tougher.
p55
aV(Applause)
p56
aa(lp57
VMK: That to say,
p58
aVwhen you look at the picture behind us,
p59
aVto come back from that kind of injury
p60
aVand come back strong  and stronger than ever
p61
aVis a really tough thing to do.
p62
aVI don't know anybody
p63
aVthat's as tough as my  wonderful wife right here.
p64
aV(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VPM: And what were the first signs
p67
aVthat recovery was not  only going to be possible
p68
aVbut you were going to have some semblance
p69
aVof the life that you and Gabby had planned?
p70
aa(lp71
VMK: Well, the first thing, for me, was
p72
aVGabby was still kind of almost unconscious,
p73
aVbut she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed
p74
aVthat she used to do when we might
p75
aVbe out to dinner at a restaurant,
p76
aVin that she pulled my ring off
p77
aVand she flipped it from one finger to the next,
p78
aVand at that point I knew
p79
aVthat she was still in there.
p80
aVPM: And there were certain words, too.
p81
aVDidn't she surprise you with  words in the beginning?
p82
aa(lp83
VMK: Well, it was tough in the beginning. GG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken.
p84
aa(lp85
VMK: Yeah, that was it.
p86
aVFor the first month, that was the extent
p87
aVof Gabby's vocabulary.
p88
aVFor some reason, she has aphasia,
p89
aVwhich is difficulty with communication.
p90
aVShe latched on to the word "chicken,"
p91
aVwhich isn't the best but  certainly is not the worst.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVAnd we were actually worried
p94
aVit could have been a lot worse than that.
p95
aVPM: Gabby, what's been  the toughest challenge
p96
aVfor you during this recovery?
p97
aa(lp98
VGG: Talking. Really hard. Really.
p99
aa(lp100
VMK: Yeah, with aphasia, Gabby knows what she wants to say,
p101
aVshe just can't get it out.
p102
aVShe understands everything,
p103
aVbut the communication is just very difficult
p104
aVbecause when you look at the picture,
p105
aVthe part of your brain where those communication centers are
p106
aVare on the left side of your head,
p107
aVwhich is where the bullet passed through.
p108
aa(lp109
VPM: So you have to do  a very dangerous thing:
p110
aVspeak for your wife.
p111
aa(lp112
VMK: I do.
p113
aVIt might be some of the most dangerous things I've ever done.
p114
aa(lp115
VPM: Gabby, are you optimistic
p116
aVabout your continuing recovery \u2014
p117
aVwalking, talking,
p118
aVbeing able to move your arm and leg?
p119
aa(lp120
VGG: I'm optimistic. It will be a long, hard haul,
p121
aVbut I'm optimistic.
p122
aa(lp123
VPM: That seems to be the number one  characteristic of Gabby Giffords,
p124
aVwouldn't you say? (Applause)
p125
aa(lp126
VMK: Gabby's always been really optimistic.
p127
aVShe works incredibly hard every day.
p128
aa(lp129
VGG: On the treadmill,  walked on my treadmill,
p130
aVSpanish lessons, French horn.
p131
aa(lp132
VMK: It's only my wife who could be \u2014
p133
aVand if you knew her before she was injured,
p134
aVyou would kind of understand this \u2014
p135
aVsomebody who could be injured
p136
aVand have such a hard time communicating
p137
aVand meets with a speech therapist,
p138
aVand then about a month ago, she says,
p139
aV"I want to learn Spanish again."
p140
aa(lp141
VPM: Well, let's take a little closer look
p142
aVat the wife, and this was even before
p143
aVyou met Gabby Giffords.
p144
aVAnd she's on a motor scooter there,
p145
aVbut it's my understanding that's a very tame image
p146
aVof what Gabby Giffords was like growing up.
p147
aa(lp148
VMK: Yeah, Gabby, she  used to race motorcycles.
p149
aVSo that's a scooter, but she had \u2014
p150
aVwell, she still has a BMW motorcycle.
p151
aa(lp152
VPM: Does she ride it? MK: Well, that's a challenge
p153
aVwith not being able to move her right arm,
p154
aVbut I think with something I know about, Velcro,
p155
aVwe might be able to get her back on the bike,
p156
aVVelcro her right hand up onto the handlebar.
p157
aa(lp158
VPM: I have a feeling we might  see that picture next,
p159
aVGabby.
p160
aVBut you meet, you're already decided
p161
aVthat you're going to dedicate  your life to service.
p162
aVYou're going into the military
p163
aVand eventually to become an astronaut.
p164
aVSo you meet.
p165
aVWhat attracts you to Gabby?
p166
aa(lp167
VMK: Well, when we met, oddly enough,
p168
aVit was the last time we were in Vancouver,
p169
aVabout 10 years ago. We met in Vancouver,
p170
aVat the airport, on a trip  that we were both taking
p171
aVto China,
p172
aVthat I would actually, from my background,
p173
aVI would call it a boondoggle.
p174
aVGabby would \u2014 GG: Fact-finding mission.
p175
aa(lp176
VMK: She would call it an important fact-finding mission.
p177
aVShe was a state senator at the time,
p178
aVand we met here, at the airport,
p179
aVbefore a trip to China.
p180
aa(lp181
VPM: Would you describe it  as a whirlwind romance?
p182
aa(lp183
VGG: No, no, no.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVA good friend.
p186
aa(lp187
VMK: Yeah, we were friends for a long time.
p188
aa(lp189
VGG: Yes. (Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VMK: And then she invited me on, about a year or so later,
p192
aVshe invited me on a date.
p193
aVWhere'd we go, Gabby?
p194
aa(lp195
VGG: Death row.
p196
aa(lp197
VMK: Yes. Our first date was to death row
p198
aVat the Florence state prison in Arizona,
p199
aVwhich was just outside  Gabby's state senate district.
p200
aVThey were working on some legislation
p201
aVthat had to do with crime and punishment
p202
aVand capital punishment  in the state of Arizona.
p203
aVSo she couldn't get anybody  else to go with her,
p204
aVand I'm like, "Of course I  want to go to death row."
p205
aVSo that was our first date.
p206
aVWe've been together ever since. GG: Yes.
p207
aa(lp208
VPM: Well, that might have contributed to the reason
p209
aVthat Gabby decided to marry you.
p210
aVYou were willing to go to death row, after all.
p211
aa(lp212
VMK: I guess.
p213
aa(lp214
VPM: Gabby, what did make you want to marry Mark?
p215
aa(lp216
VGG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends.
p217
aa(lp218
VMK: I thought we always
p219
aVhad a very special relationship.
p220
aVWe've gone through some tough times
p221
aVand it's only made it stronger. GG: Stronger.
p222
aa(lp223
VPM: After you got married, however,
p224
aVyou continued very independent lives.
p225
aVActually, you didn't even live together.
p226
aa(lp227
VMK: We had one of those commuter marriages.
p228
aVIn our case, it was Washington, D.C., Houston,
p229
aVTucson.
p230
aVSometimes we'd go clockwise,
p231
aVsometimes counterclockwise,
p232
aVto all those different places,
p233
aVand we didn't really live together
p234
aVuntil that Saturday morning.
p235
aVWithin an hour of Gabby being shot,
p236
aVI was on an airplane to Tucson,
p237
aVand that was the moment
p238
aVwhere that had changed things.
p239
aa(lp240
VPM: And also, Gabby, you had run for Congress
p241
aVafter being a state senator
p242
aVand served in Congress for six years.
p243
aVWhat did you like best
p244
aVabout being in Congress?
p245
aa(lp246
VGG: Fast pace. Fast pace.
p247
aa(lp248
VPM: Well it was the way you did it. GG: Yes, yes. Fast pace.
p249
aa(lp250
VPM: I'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VMK: Yeah, you know, legislation is often
p254
aVat a colossally slow pace,
p255
aVbut my wife, and I have to admit,
p256
aVa lot of other members of Congress that I know,
p257
aVwork incredibly hard.
p258
aVI mean, Gabby would run  around like a crazy person,
p259
aVnever take a day off,
p260
aVmaybe a half a day off a month,
p261
aVand whenever she was awake she was working,
p262
aVand she really, really thrived on that,
p263
aVand still does today. GG: Yes. Yes.
p264
aa(lp265
VPM: Installing solar panels on the top of her house,
p266
aVI have to say.
p267
aVSo after the tragic incident, Mark,
p268
aVyou decided to resign
p269
aVyour position as an astronaut,
p270
aVeven though you were supposed to take
p271
aVthe next space mission.
p272
aVEverybody, including Gabby,
p273
aVtalked you into going back,
p274
aVand you did end up taking.
p275
aa(lp276
VMK: Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured,
p277
aVI called my boss, the chief astronaut,
p278
aVDr. Peggy Whitson, and I said,
p279
aV"Peggy, I know I'm launching in space
p280
aVin three months from now.
p281
aVGabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson.
p282
aVYou've got to find a replacement for me."
p283
aVSo I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut,
p284
aVbut I gave up my job and they found a replacement.
p285
aVMonths later, maybe about two months later,
p286
aVI started about getting my job back,
p287
aVwhich is something,
p288
aVwhen you become this primary caregiver person,
p289
aVwhich some people in the audience here
p290
aVhave certainly been in that position,
p291
aVit's a challenging role but at some point
p292
aVyou've got to figure out when you're going to get your life back,
p293
aVand at the time, I couldn't ask Gabby
p294
aVif she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again.
p295
aVBut I knew she was\u2014 GG: Yes. Yes. Yes.
p296
aa(lp297
VMK: She was the biggest  supporter of my career,
p298
aVand I knew it was the right thing to do.
p299
aa(lp300
VPM: And yet I'm trying to imagine, Mark,
p301
aVwhat that was like, going off onto a mission,
p302
aVone presumes safely,  but it's never a guarantee,
p303
aVand knowing that Gabby is \u2014
p304
aa(lp305
VMK: Well not only was  she still in the hospital,
p306
aVon the third day of that flight,
p307
aVliterally while I was
p308
aVrendezvousing with the space station,
p309
aVand you've got two vehicles moving at 17,500 miles an hour,
p310
aVI'm actually flying it, looking out the window,
p311
aVa bunch of computers,
p312
aVGabby was in brain surgery,
p313
aVliterally at that time having the final surgery
p314
aVto replace the piece of skull
p315
aVthat they took out on the day she was injured
p316
aVwith a prosthetic, yeah, which is the whole side of her head.
p317
aVNow if any of you guys would ever come
p318
aVto our house in Tucson for the first time,
p319
aVGabby would usually go up to the freezer
p320
aVand pull out the piece of Tupperware
p321
aVthat has the real skull. (Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VGG: The real skull. MK: Which freaks people out, sometimes.
p324
aa(lp325
VPM: Is that for appetizer or dessert, Mark?
p326
aa(lp327
VMK: Well, it just gets the conversation going.
p328
aa(lp329
VPM: But there was a lot  of conversation about
p330
aVsomething you did, Gabby, after Mark's flight.
p331
aVYou had to make another  step of courage too,
p332
aVbecause here was  Congress deadlocked again,
p333
aVand you got out of the rehabilitation center,
p334
aVgot yourself to Washington
p335
aVso that you could walk  on the floor of the House \u2014
p336
aVI can barely talk about this without getting emotional \u2014
p337
aVand cast a vote which could have been
p338
aVthe deciding vote.
p339
aa(lp340
VGG: The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling.
p341
aa(lp342
VMK: Yeah, we had that vote,
p343
aVI guess about five months after Gabby was injured,
p344
aVand she made this bold decision to go back.
p345
aVA very controversial vote,
p346
aVbut she wanted to be there
p347
aVto have her voice heard one more time.
p348
aa(lp349
VPM: And after that, resigned
p350
aVand began what has been a very slow
p351
aVand challenging recovery.
p352
aVWhat's life like, day to day?
p353
aa(lp354
VMK: Well, that's Gabby's service dog Nelson.
p355
aa(lp356
VGG: Nelson.
p357
aa(lp358
VMK: New member of our family. GG: Yes, yes.
p359
aa(lp360
VMK: And we got him from a\u2014
p361
aa(lp362
VGG: Prison. Murder. MK: We have a lot of connections
p363
aVwith prisons, apparently. (Laughter)
p364
aVNelson came from a prison,
p365
aVraised by a murderer in Massachusetts.
p366
aVBut she did a great job with this dog.
p367
aVHe's a fabulous service dog.
p368
aa(lp369
VPM: So Gabby, what have you learned
p370
aVfrom your experiences the past few years?
p371
aa(lp372
VMK: Yeah, what have you learned? GG: Deeper. Deeper.
p373
aa(lp374
VPM: Your relationship is deeper.
p375
aVIt has to be. You're together all the time now.
p376
aa(lp377
VMK: I imagine being grateful, too, right?
p378
aa(lp379
VGG: Grateful.
p380
aa(lp381
VPM: This is a picture of  family and friends gathering,
p382
aVbut I love these pictures because they show
p383
aVthe Gabby and Mark relationship now.
p384
aVAnd you describe it, Gabby, over and over,
p385
aVas deeper on so many levels. Yes?
p386
aa(lp387
VMK: I think when something tragic happens
p388
aVin a family, it can pull people together.
p389
aVHere's us watching the space shuttle
p390
aVfly over Tucson,
p391
aVthe Space Shuttle Endeavour,
p392
aVthe one that I was the  commander on its last flight,
p393
aVon its final flight on top of an airplane
p394
aVon a 747 on its way to L.A.,
p395
aVNASA was kind enough  to have it fly over Tucson.
p396
aa(lp397
VPM: And of course, the two of you
p398
aVgo through these challenges
p399
aVof a slow and difficult recovery,
p400
aVand yet, Gabby, how do you maintain
p401
aVyour optimism and positive outlook?
p402
aa(lp403
VGG: I want to make the world a better place.
p404
aV(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VPM: And you're doing that
p407
aVeven though your recovery has to remain
p408
aVfront and center for both of you.
p409
aVYou are people who have done service
p410
aVto your country and you  are continuing to do that
p411
aVwith a new initiative, a new purpose.
p412
aVAnd Gabby, what's on the agenda now?
p413
aa(lp414
VGG: Americans for Responsible Solutions.
p415
aa(lp416
VMK: That's our political action committee,
p417
aVwhere we are trying to  get members of Congress
p418
aVto take a more serious look at gun violence in this country,
p419
aVand to try to
p420
aVpass some reasonable legislation.
p421
aa(lp422
VGG: Yes. Yes. (Applause)
p423
aa(lp424
VMK: You know, this affected  us very personally,
p425
aVbut it wasn't what happened to Gabby that got us involved.
p426
aVIt was really the 20 murdered first graders
p427
aVand kindergartners in Newtown, Connecticut,
p428
aVand the response that we saw afterwards
p429
aVwhere \u2014 well, look what's happened so far.
p430
aVSo far the national response has been
p431
aVpretty much to do nothing.
p432
aVWe're trying to change that.
p433
aa(lp434
VPM: There have been 11 mass shootings
p435
aVsince Newtown,
p436
aVa school a week in the first  two months of last year.
p437
aVWhat are you doing that's different
p438
aVthan other efforts to balance
p439
aVrights for gun ownership and responsibilities?
p440
aa(lp441
VMK: We're gun owners,  we support gun rights.
p442
aVAt the same time, we've  got to do everything we can
p443
aVto keep guns out of the hands of criminals
p444
aVand the dangerously mentally ill.
p445
aVIt's not too difficult to do that.
p446
aVThis issue, like many others,
p447
aVhas become very polarizing and political,
p448
aVand we're trying to bring some balance
p449
aVto the debate in Washington.
p450
aa(lp451
VPM: Thank you both for that effort.
p452
aVAnd not surprisingly for  this woman of courage
p453
aVand of a sense of adventure,
p454
aVyou just keep challenging yourself,
p455
aVand the sky seems to be the limit.
p456
aVI have to share this video
p457
aVof your most recent adventure.
p458
aVTake a look at Gabby.
p459
aa(lp460
VMK: This is a couple months ago.
p461
aa(lp462
V(Video) MK: You okay? You did great. GG: Yes, it's gorgeous. Thank you.
p463
aVGood stuff. Gorgeous. Oh, thank you.
p464
aVMountains. Gorgeous mountains.
p465
aV(Applause)
p466
aa(lp467
VMK: Let me just say
p468
aVone of the guys that Gabby jumped with
p469
aVthat day was a Navy SEAL
p470
aVwho she met in Afghanistan
p471
aVwho was injured in combat,
p472
aVhad a really rough time.
p473
aVGabby visited him
p474
aVwhen he was at Bethesda
p475
aVand went through a really tough period.
p476
aVHe started doing better.
p477
aVMonths later, Gabby was shot in the head,
p478
aVand then he supported her
p479
aVwhile she was in the hospital in Houston.
p480
aVSo they have a very, very nice connection.
p481
aa(lp482
VGG: Yes.
p483
aa(lp484
VPM: What a wonderful moment.
p485
aVBecause this is the TED stage,
p486
aVGabby, I know you worked very hard
p487
aVto think of the ideas that you wanted to leave
p488
aVwith this audience.
p489
aa(lp490
VGG: Thank you.
p491
aVHello, everyone.
p492
aVThank you for inviting us here today.
p493
aVIt's been a long, hard haul,
p494
aVbut I'm getting better.
p495
aVI'm working hard,
p496

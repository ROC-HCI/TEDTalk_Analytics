VBeverly Joubert: We are truly passionate
p5
aVabout the African wilderness
p6
aVand protecting the African wilderness,
p7
aVand so what we've done
p8
aVis we've focused on iconic cats.
p9
aVAnd I know,
p10
aVin the light of human suffering and poverty
p11
aVand even climate change,
p12
aVone would wonder,
p13
aVwhy worry about a few cats?
p14
aVWell today we're here
p15
aVto share with you a message that we have learned
p16
aVfrom a very important and special character \u2014
p17
aVthis leopard.
p18
aa(lp19
VDereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been
p20
aVlike a super long episode of "CSI" \u2014
p21
aVsomething like 28 years.
p22
aVIn essence, what we've done
p23
aVis we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,
p24
aVwe've seen over 2,000 kills
p25
aVby these amazing animals.
p26
aVBut one of the things that science really lets us down on
p27
aVis that personality,
p28
aVthat individual personality that these animals have.
p29
aVAnd here's a prime example.
p30
aVWe found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old
p31
aVbaobab tree in Africa,
p32
aVthe same tree that we found her mother in
p33
aVand her grandmother.
p34
aVAnd she took us on a journey
p35
aVand revealed something very special to us \u2014
p36
aVher own daughter, eight days old.
p37
aVAnd the minute we found this leopard,
p38
aVwe realized that we needed to move in,
p39
aVand so we basically stayed with this leopard
p40
aVfor the next four-and-a-half years \u2014
p41
aVfollowing her every day,
p42
aVgetting to know her,
p43
aVthat individual personality of hers,
p44
aVand really coming to know her.
p45
aVNow I'm destined
p46
aVto spend a lot of time
p47
aVwith some unique,
p48
aVvery, very special,
p49
aVindividualistic
p50
aVand often seductive female characters.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVBeverly's clearly one of them,
p53
aVand this little leopard, Legadema, is another,
p54
aVand she changed our lives.
p55
aa(lp56
VBJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her \u2014
p57
aVin fact, more time than even her mother did.
p58
aVWhen her mother would go off hunting,
p59
aVwe would stay and film.
p60
aVAnd early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree
p61
aV20 paces away from us.
p62
aVIt was frightening,
p63
aVand it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.
p64
aVAnd of course, we were stunned for a while,
p65
aVbut when we managed to get our wits about us,
p66
aVwe looked at it and said, "My gosh,
p67
aVwhat's going to happen with that little cub?
p68
aVShe's probably going to forever associate
p69
aVthat deafening crash with us."
p70
aVWell, we needn't have worried.
p71
aVShe came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,
p72
aVsat next to us, shivering,
p73
aVwith her back towards Dereck, and looking out.
p74
aVAnd actually from that day on,
p75
aVshe's been comfortable with us.
p76
aVSo we felt that that day
p77
aVwas the day that she really earned her name.
p78
aVWe called her Legadema,
p79
aVwhich means, "light from the sky."
p80
aa(lp81
VDJ: Now we've found these individualisms
p82
aVin all sorts of animals,
p83
aVin particular in the cats.
p84
aVThis particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,
p85
aV"he who greets with fire,"
p86
aVand you can just see that about him, you know \u2014 that's his character.
p87
aVBut only by getting up close to these animals
p88
aVand spending time with them
p89
aVcan we actually even reach out
p90
aVand dig out these personal characters that they have.
p91
aa(lp92
VBJ: But through our investigation,
p93
aVwe have to seek the wildest places in Africa.
p94
aVAnd right now this is in the Okavango Delta
p95
aVin Botswana.
p96
aVYes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,
p97
aVbut I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.
p98
aVBut also, our hearts are in our throats
p99
aVa huge amount of the time,
p100
aVbecause we're driving through water,
p101
aVand it's an unknown territory.
p102
aVBut we're really there
p103
aVseeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.
p104
aa(lp105
VDJ: Now one of the big things, of course,
p106
aVeverybody knows that cats hate water,
p107
aVand so this was a real revelation for us.
p108
aVAnd we could only find this by pushing ourselves,
p109
aVby going where no sane person should go \u2014
p110
aVnot without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly \u2014
p111
aVand just pushing the envelope,
p112
aVgoing out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.
p113
aVBut we've managed to find that these lions
p114
aVare 15 percent bigger than any others,
p115
aVand they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.
p116
aa(lp117
VBJ: And then of course, the challenge
p118
aVis knowing when to turn around.
p119
aVWe don't always get that right,
p120
aVand on this particular day,
p121
aVwe seriously underestimated the depth.
p122
aVWe got deeper and deeper,
p123
aVuntil it was at Dereck's chest-height.
p124
aVWell then we hit a deep depression,
p125
aVand we seriously submerged the vehicle.
p126
aVWe actually managed to drown
p127
aVtwo million dollars' worth of camera gear.
p128
aVWe drowned our pride, I must tell you,
p129
aVwhich was really serious,
p130
aVand we seized the engine.
p131
aa(lp132
VDJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle
p133
aVis that he who drowns the vehicle
p134
aVgets to swim with the crocodiles.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVYou will notice also that all of these images here
p137
aVare taken from the top angle by Beverly \u2014
p138
aVthe dry top angle, by the way.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVBut all the places we get stuck in really have great views.
p141
aVAnd it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,
p142
aVand Beverly was able to get a great photograph.
p143
aa(lp144
VBJ: But we truly do
p145
aVspend day and night
p146
aVtrying to capture unique footage.
p147
aVAnd 20 years ago,
p148
aVwe did a film called "Eternal Enemies"
p149
aVwhere we managed to capture
p150
aVthis unusual disturbing behavior across two species \u2014
p151
aVlions and hyenas.
p152
aVAnd surprisingly, it became a cult film.
p153
aVAnd we can only work that out
p154
aVas people were seeing parallels
p155
aVbetween the thuggish side of nature
p156
aVand gang warfare.
p157
aa(lp158
VDJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion
p159
aVis doing exactly what his name,
p160
aVEetwidomayloh, represents.
p161
aVHe's focused on this hyena,
p162
aVand he is going to get it.
p163
aV(Animal sounds)
p164
aVBut that's, I think, what this is all about,
p165
aVis that these individuals have these personalities and characters.
p166
aVBut for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,
p167
aVbut we live by certain rules of engagement,
p168
aVwhich mean we can't interfere.
p169
aVThis sort of behavior has been going on
p170
aVfor three, four, five million years,
p171
aVand we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right."
p172
aVBut that's not always easy for us.
p173
aa(lp174
VBJ: So, as Dereck says,
p175
aVwe have to work through extremes \u2014
p176
aVextreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.
p177
aVSleep deprivation is extreme.
p178
aVWe're on the edge
p179
aVthrough a large part of the time.
p180
aVBut, for 10 years, we tried to capture
p181
aVlions and elephants together \u2014
p182
aVand never ever managed
p183
aVuntil this particular night.
p184
aVAnd I have to tell you
p185
aVthat it was a disturbing night for me.
p186
aVI had tears rolling down my cheeks.
p187
aVI was shaking with anxiety,
p188
aVbut I knew that [I had] to capture something
p189
aVthat had never been seen before, had never been documented.
p190
aVAnd I do believe you should stay with us.
p191
aa(lp192
VDJ: The amazing thing about these moments \u2014
p193
aVand this is probably a highlight of our career \u2014
p194
aVis that you never know how it's going to end.
p195
aVMany people believe, in fact,
p196
aVthat death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,
p197
aVnot in the lungs,
p198
aVand that's when people give up hope,
p199
aVor when any life form gives up hope.
p200
aVAnd you can see the start of it here.
p201
aVThis elephant, against overwhelming odds,
p202
aVsimply gives up hope.
p203
aVBut by the same token,
p204
aVyou can get your hope back again.
p205
aVSo just when you think it's all over, something else happens,
p206
aVsome spark gets into you,
p207
aVsome sort of will to fight \u2014
p208
aVthat iron will that we all have,
p209
aVthat this elephant has,
p210
aVthat conservation has, that big cats have.
p211
aVEverything has that will to survive,
p212
aVto fight, to push through that mental barrier
p213
aVand to keep going.
p214
aVAnd for us, in many ways,
p215
aVthis elephant has become
p216
aVa symbol of inspiration for us,
p217
aVa symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VNow back to the leopard.
p222
aVWe were spending so much time with this leopard
p223
aVand getting to understand her individualism,
p224
aVher personal character,
p225
aVthat maybe we were taking it a little bit far.
p226
aVWe were perhaps taking her for granted,
p227
aVand maybe she didn't like that that much.
p228
aVThis is about couples working together,
p229
aVand so I do need to say that within the vehicle
p230
aVwe have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.
p231
aVBeverly sits on the one side
p232
aVwhere all her camera gear is,
p233
aVand I'm on the other side where my space is.
p234
aVThese are precious to us, these divides.
p235
aa(lp236
VBJ: But when this little cub saw
p237
aVthat I had vacated my seat
p238
aVand climbed to the back to get some camera gear,
p239
aVshe came in like a curious cat
p240
aVto come and investigate.
p241
aVIt was phenomenal, and we felt grateful
p242
aVthat she trusted us to that extent.
p243
aVBut at the same time, we were concerned
p244
aVthat if she created this as a habit
p245
aVand jumped into somebody else's car,
p246
aVit might not turn out the same way \u2014
p247
aVshe might get shot for that.
p248
aVSo we knew we had to react quickly.
p249
aVAnd the only way we thought we could
p250
aVwithout scaring her
p251
aVis to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make \u2014
p252
aVa hiss and a sound.
p253
aVSo Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car \u2014
p254
aVvery innovative.
p255
aa(lp256
VDJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,
p257
aVbecause Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVBut really and truly, this was how
p260
aVthis little leopard was displaying
p261
aVher individual personality.
p262
aVBut nothing prepared us
p263
aVfor what happened next in our relationship with her,
p264
aVwhen she started hunting.
p265
aa(lp266
VBJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.
p267
aVIt was like watching a graduation ceremony.
p268
aVWe felt like we were surrogate parents.
p269
aVAnd of course, we knew now
p270
aVthat she was going to survive.
p271
aVBut only when we saw the tiny baby baboon
p272
aVclinging to the mother's fur
p273
aVdid we realize that something very unique
p274
aVwas taking place here with Legadema.
p275
aVAnd of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,
p276
aVit didn't turn and run.
p277
aVSo what we watched
p278
aVover the next couple of hours
p279
aVwas very unique.
p280
aVIt was absolutely amazing
p281
aVwhen she picked it up to safety,
p282
aVprotecting it from the hyena.
p283
aVAnd over the next five hours,
p284
aVshe took care of it.
p285
aVWe realized that we actually don't know everything,
p286
aVand that nature is so unpredictable,
p287
aVwe have to be open at all times.
p288
aa(lp289
VDJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aVBut in fact,
p292
aVwhat we were seeing here was interesting.
p293
aVBecause she is a cub wanting to play,
p294
aVbut she was also a predator needing to kill,
p295
aVand yet conflicted in some way,
p296
aVbecause she was also an emerging mother.
p297
aVShe had this maternal instinct,
p298
aVmuch like a young girl on her way to womanhood,
p299
aVand so this really took us to this new level
p300
aVof understanding that personality.
p301
aa(lp302
VBJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.
p303
aVThey ended up sleeping for hours.
p304
aVBut I have to tell you \u2014
p305
aVeverybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?"
p306
aVIt did die,
p307
aVand we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.
p308
aa(lp309
VDJ: So at this stage, I guess,
p310
aVwe had very, very firm ideas
p311
aVon what conservation meant.
p312
aVWe had to deal with these individual personalities.
p313
aVWe had to deal with them with respect
p314
aVand celebrate them.
p315
aVAnd so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative
p316
aVto march forward into conservation,
p317
aVtaking care of the big cats that we loved \u2014
p318
aVand then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years
p319
aVto see how well we had all collectively been doing.
p320
aVSo when Beverly and I were born,
p321
aVthere were 450,000 lions,
p322
aVand today there are 20,000.
p323
aVTigers haven't fared any better \u2014
p324
aV45,000
p325
aVdown to maybe 3,000.
p326
aa(lp327
VBJ: And then cheetahs have crashed
p328
aVall the way down to 12,000.
p329
aVLeopards have plummeted
p330
aVfrom 700,000
p331
aVdown to a mere 50,000.
p332
aVNow in the extraordinary time
p333
aVthat we have worked with Legadema \u2014
p334
aVwhich is really over a five-year period \u2014
p335
aV10,000 leopards were legally shot
p336
aVby safari hunters.
p337
aVAnd that's not the only leopards
p338
aVthat were being killed through that period.
p339
aVThere's an immense amount of poaching as well,
p340
aVand so possibly the same amount.
p341
aVIt's simply not sustainable.
p342
aVWe admire them,
p343
aVand we fear them,
p344
aVand yet, as man, we want to steal their power.
p345
aVIt used to be the time
p346
aVwhere only kings wore a leopard skin,
p347
aVbut now throughout rituals and ceremonies,
p348
aVtraditional healers and ministers.
p349
aVAnd of course, looking at this lion paw
p350
aVthat has been skinned,
p351
aVit eerily reminds me
p352
aVof a human hand,
p353
aVand that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.
p354
aa(lp355
VDJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.
p356
aVSouth Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.
p357
aVLion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,
p358
aVand so in a stroke, the lion bone industry
p359
aVis going to wipe out all the tigers.
p360
aVSo we have a real problem here,
p361
aVno more so than the lions do, the male lions.
p362
aVSo the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw
p363
aVis actually a red herring,
p364
aVbecause there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,
p365
aVand they all are actually
p366
aVinfected with the same disease.
p367
aVI call it complacency \u2014
p368
aVour complacency.
p369
aVBecause there's a sport, there's an activity going on
p370
aVthat we're all aware of, that we condone.
p371
aVAnd that's probably because we haven't seen it
p372
aVlike we are today.
p373
aa(lp374
VBJ: And you have to know
p375
aVthat, when a male lion is killed,
p376
aVit completely disrupts the whole pride.
p377
aVA new male comes into the area
p378
aVand takes over the pride,
p379
aVand, of course, first of all kills all the cubs
p380
aVand possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.
p381
aVSo we've estimated
p382
aVthat between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed
p383
aVwhen one lion is hanging on a wall
p384
aVsomewhere in a far-off place.
p385
aa(lp386
VDJ: So what our investigations have shown
p387
aVis that these lions are essential.
p388
aVThey're essential to the habitat.
p389
aVIf they disappear,
p390
aVwhole ecosystems in Africa disappear.
p391
aVThere's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year
p392
aVecotourism revenue stream into Africa.
p393
aVSo this is not just a concern about lions;
p394
aVit's a concern about communities in Africa as well.
p395
aVIf they disappear, all of that goes away.
p396
aVBut what I'm more concerned about in many ways
p397
aVis that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,
p398
aVas we de-link ourselves spiritually
p399
aVfrom these animals,
p400
aVwe lose hope,
p401
aVwe lose that spiritual connection,
p402
aVour dignity, that thing within us
p403
aVthat keeps us connected to the planet.
p404
aa(lp405
VBJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes
p406
aVof lions and leopards right now,
p407
aVit is all about critical awareness.
p408
aVAnd so what we are doing,
p409
aVin February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion,"
p410
aVand "The Last Lion" is exactly
p411
aVwhat is happening right now.
p412
aVThat is the situation we're in \u2014
p413
aVthe last lions.
p414
aVThat is, if we don't take action and do something,
p415
aVthese plains will be completely devoid
p416
aVof big cats,
p417
aVand then, in turn, everything else will disappear.
p418
aVAnd simply, if we can't protect them,
p419
aVwe're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.
p420
aa(lp421
VDJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about
p422
aVand designed our lives by \u2014
p423
aVthat conservation was all about respect
p424
aVand celebration \u2014
p425
aVis probably true. That's really what it needs.
p426
aVWe need it. We respect and celebrate each other
p427
aVas a man and a woman, as a community
p428
aVand as part of this planet,
p429
aVand we need to continue that.
p430
aa(lp431
VAnd Legadema?
p432
aVWell we can report, in fact,
p433
aVthat we're grandparents.
p434
aa(lp435

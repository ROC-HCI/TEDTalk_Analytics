VMark Twain summed up what I take to be
p5
aVone of the fundamental problems of cognitive science
p6
aVwith a single witticism.
p7
aVHe said, "There's something fascinating about science.
p8
aVOne gets such wholesale returns of conjecture
p9
aVout of such a trifling investment in fact."
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VTwain meant it as a joke, of course, but he's right:
p13
aVThere's something fascinating about science.
p14
aVFrom a few bones, we infer the existence of dinosuars.
p15
aVFrom spectral lines, the composition of nebulae.
p16
aVFrom fruit flies,
p17
aVthe mechanisms of heredity,
p18
aVand from reconstructed images of blood flowing through the brain,
p19
aVor in my case, from the behavior of very young children,
p20
aVwe try to say something about the fundamental mechanisms
p21
aVof human cognition.
p22
aVIn particular, in my lab in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT,
p23
aVI have spent the past decade trying to understand the mystery
p24
aVof how children learn so much from so little so quickly.
p25
aVBecause, it turns out that the fascinating thing about science
p26
aVis also a fascinating thing about children,
p27
aVwhich, to put a gentler spin on Mark Twain,
p28
aVis precisely their ability to draw rich, abstract inferences
p29
aVrapidly and accurately from sparse, noisy data.
p30
aVI'm going to give you just two examples today.
p31
aVOne is about a problem of generalization,
p32
aVand the other is about a problem of causal reasoning.
p33
aVAnd although I'm going to talk about work in my lab,
p34
aVthis work is inspired by and indebted to a field.
p35
aVI'm grateful to mentors, colleagues, and collaborators around the world.
p36
aa(lp37
VLet me start with the problem of generalization.
p38
aVGeneralizing from small samples of data is the bread and butter of science.
p39
aVWe poll a tiny fraction of the electorate
p40
aVand we predict the outcome of national elections.
p41
aVWe see how a handful of patients responds to treatment in a clinical trial,
p42
aVand we bring drugs to a national market.
p43
aVBut this only works if our sample is randomly drawn from the population.
p44
aVIf our sample is cherry-picked in some way \u2014
p45
aVsay, we poll only urban voters,
p46
aVor say, in our clinical trials for treatments for heart disease,
p47
aVwe include only men \u2014
p48
aVthe results may not generalize to the broader population.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo scientists care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not,
p51
aVbut what does that have to do with babies?
p52
aVWell, babies have to generalize from small samples of data all the time.
p53
aVThey see a few rubber ducks and learn that they float,
p54
aVor a few balls and learn that they bounce.
p55
aVAnd they develop expectations about ducks and balls
p56
aVthat they're going to extend to rubber ducks and balls
p57
aVfor the rest of their lives.
p58
aVAnd the kinds of generalizations babies have to make about ducks and balls
p59
aVthey have to make about almost everything:
p60
aVshoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo do babies care whether the tiny bit of evidence they see
p63
aVis plausibly representative of a larger population?
p64
aVLet's find out.
p65
aVI'm going to show you two movies,
p66
aVone from each of two conditions of an experiment,
p67
aVand because you're going to see just two movies,
p68
aVyou're going to see just two babies,
p69
aVand any two babies differ from each other in innumerable ways.
p70
aVBut these babies, of course, here stand in for groups of babies,
p71
aVand the differences you're going to see
p72
aVrepresent average group differences in babies' behavior across conditions.
p73
aVIn each movie, you're going to see a baby doing maybe
p74
aVjust exactly what you might expect a baby to do,
p75
aVand we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are.
p76
aVBut to my mind the magical thing,
p77
aVand what I want you to pay attention to,
p78
aVis the contrast between these two conditions,
p79
aVbecause the only thing that differs between these two movies
p80
aVis the statistical evidence the babies are going to observe.
p81
aVWe're going to show babies a box of blue and yellow balls,
p82
aVand my then-graduate student, now colleague at Stanford, Hyowon Gweon,
p83
aVis going to pull three blue balls in a row out of this box,
p84
aVand when she pulls those balls out, she's going to squeeze them,
p85
aVand the balls are going to squeak.
p86
aVAnd if you're a baby, that's like a TED Talk.
p87
aVIt doesn't get better than that.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVBut the important point is it's really easy to pull three blue balls in a row
p90
aVout of a box of mostly blue balls.
p91
aVYou could do that with your eyes closed.
p92
aVIt's plausibly a random sample from this population.
p93
aVAnd if you can reach into a box at random and pull out things that squeak,
p94
aVthen maybe everything in the box squeaks.
p95
aVSo maybe babies should expect those yellow balls to squeak as well.
p96
aVNow, those yellow balls have funny sticks on the end,
p97
aVso babies could do other things with them if they wanted to.
p98
aVThey could pound them or whack them.
p99
aVBut let's see what the baby does.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Video) Hyowon Gweon: See this? (Ball squeaks)
p102
aVDid you see that? (Ball squeaks)
p103
aVCool.
p104
aVSee this one?
p105
aV(Ball squeaks)
p106
aVWow.
p107
aa(lp108
VLaura Schulz: Told you. (Laughs)
p109
aa(lp110
V(Video) HG: See this one? (Ball squeaks)
p111
aVHey Clara, this one's for you. You can go ahead and play.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VLS: I don't even have to talk, right?
p115
aVAll right, it's nice that babies will generalize properties
p116
aVof blue balls to yellow balls,
p117
aVand it's impressive that babies can learn from imitating us,
p118
aVbut we've known those things about babies for a very long time.
p119
aVThe really interesting question
p120
aVis what happens when we show babies exactly the same thing,
p121
aVand we can ensure it's exactly the same because we have a secret compartment
p122
aVand we actually pull the balls from there,
p123
aVbut this time, all we change is the apparent population
p124
aVfrom which that evidence was drawn.
p125
aVThis time, we're going to show babies three blue balls
p126
aVpulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls,
p127
aVand guess what?
p128
aVYou [probably won't] randomly draw three blue balls in a row
p129
aVout of a box of mostly yellow balls.
p130
aVThat is not plausibly randomly sampled evidence.
p131
aVThat evidence suggests that maybe Hyowon was deliberately sampling the blue balls.
p132
aVMaybe there's something special about the blue balls.
p133
aVMaybe only the blue balls squeak.
p134
aVLet's see what the baby does.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Video) HG: See this? (Ball squeaks)
p137
aVSee this toy? (Ball squeaks)
p138
aVOh, that was cool. See? (Ball squeaks)
p139
aVNow this one's for you to play. You can go ahead and play.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Fussing) (Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VLS: So you just saw two 15-month-old babies
p144
aVdo entirely different things
p145
aVbased only on the probability of the sample they observed.
p146
aVLet me show you the experimental results.
p147
aVOn the vertical axis, you'll see the percentage of babies
p148
aVwho squeezed the ball in each condition,
p149
aVand as you'll see, babies are much more likely to generalize the evidence
p150
aVwhen it's plausibly representative of the population
p151
aVthan when the evidence is clearly cherry-picked.
p152
aVAnd this leads to a fun prediction:
p153
aVSuppose you pulled just one blue ball out of the mostly yellow box.
p154
aVYou [probably won't] pull three blue balls in a row at random out of a yellow box,
p155
aVbut you could randomly sample just one blue ball.
p156
aVThat's not an improbable sample.
p157
aVAnd if you could reach into a box at random
p158
aVand pull out something that squeaks, maybe everything in the box squeaks.
p159
aVSo even though babies are going to see much less evidence for squeaking,
p160
aVand have many fewer actions to imitate
p161
aVin this one ball condition than in the condition you just saw,
p162
aVwe predicted that babies themselves would squeeze more,
p163
aVand that's exactly what we found.
p164
aVSo 15-month-old babies, in this respect, like scientists,
p165
aVcare whether evidence is randomly sampled or not,
p166
aVand they use this to develop expectations about the world:
p167
aVwhat squeaks and what doesn't,
p168
aVwhat to explore and what to ignore.
p169
aa(lp170
VLet me show you another example now,
p171
aVthis time about a problem of causal reasoning.
p172
aVAnd it starts with a problem of confounded evidence
p173
aVthat all of us have,
p174
aVwhich is that we are part of the world.
p175
aVAnd this might not seem like a problem to you, but like most problems,
p176
aVit's only a problem when things go wrong.
p177
aVTake this baby, for instance.
p178
aVThings are going wrong for him.
p179
aVHe would like to make this toy go, and he can't.
p180
aVI'll show you a few-second clip.
p181
aVAnd there's two possibilities, broadly:
p182
aVMaybe he's doing something wrong,
p183
aVor maybe there's something wrong with the toy.
p184
aVSo in this next experiment,
p185
aVwe're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data
p186
aVsupporting one hypothesis over the other,
p187
aVand we're going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions
p188
aVabout what to do.
p189
aa(lp190
VHere's the setup.
p191
aVHyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed.
p192
aVI am then going to try twice and fail both times,
p193
aVand then Hyowon is going to try again and succeed,
p194
aVand this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students
p195
aVin technology across the board.
p196
aVBut the important point here is it provides a little bit of evidence
p197
aVthat the problem isn't with the toy, it's with the person.
p198
aVSome people can make this toy go,
p199
aVand some can't.
p200
aVNow, when the baby gets the toy, he's going to have a choice.
p201
aVHis mom is right there,
p202
aVso he can go ahead and hand off the toy and change the person,
p203
aVbut there's also going to be another toy at the end of that cloth,
p204
aVand he can pull the cloth towards him and change the toy.
p205
aVSo let's see what the baby does.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Video) HG: Two, three. Go! (Music)
p208
aVLS: One, two, three, go!
p209
aVArthur, I'm going to try again. One, two, three, go!
p210
aVYG: Arthur, let me try again, okay?
p211
aVOne, two, three, go! (Music)
p212
aVLook at that. Remember these toys?
p213
aVSee these toys? Yeah, I'm going to put this one over here,
p214
aVand I'm going to give this one to you.
p215
aVYou can go ahead and play.
p216
aVLS: Okay, Laura, but of course, babies love their mommies.
p217
aVOf course babies give toys to their mommies
p218
aVwhen they can't make them work.
p219
aVSo again, the really important question is what happens when we change
p220
aVthe statistical data ever so slightly.
p221
aVThis time, babies are going to see the toy work and fail in exactly the same order,
p222
aVbut we're changing the distribution of evidence.
p223
aVThis time, Hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once, and so am I.
p224
aVAnd this suggests it doesn't matter who tries this toy, the toy is broken.
p225
aVIt doesn't work all the time.
p226
aVAgain, the baby's going to have a choice.
p227
aVHer mom is right next to her, so she can change the person,
p228
aVand there's going to be another toy at the end of the cloth.
p229
aVLet's watch what she does.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Video) HG: Two, three, go! (Music)
p232
aVLet me try one more time. One, two, three, go!
p233
aVHmm.
p234
aa(lp235
VLS: Let me try, Clara.
p236
aVOne, two, three, go!
p237
aVHmm, let me try again.
p238
aVOne, two, three, go! (Music)
p239
aVHG: I'm going to put this one over here,
p240
aVand I'm going to give this one to you.
p241
aVYou can go ahead and play.
p242
aV(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VLS: Let me show you the experimental results.
p245
aVOn the vertical axis, you'll see the distribution
p246
aVof children's choices in each condition,
p247
aVand you'll see that the distribution of the choices children make
p248
aVdepends on the evidence they observe.
p249
aVSo in the second year of life,
p250
aVbabies can use a tiny bit of statistical data
p251
aVto decide between two fundamentally different strategies
p252
aVfor acting in the world:
p253
aVasking for help and exploring.
p254
aVI've just shown you two laboratory experiments
p255
aVout of literally hundreds in the field that make similar points,
p256
aVbecause the really critical point
p257
aVis that children's ability to make rich inferences from sparse data
p258
aVunderlies all the species-specific cultural learning that we do.
p259
aVChildren learn about new tools from just a few examples.
p260
aVThey learn new causal relationships from just a few examples.
p261
aVThey even learn new words, in this case in American Sign Language.
p262
aa(lp263
VI want to close with just two points.
p264
aVIf you've been following my world, the field of brain and cognitive sciences,
p265
aVfor the past few years,
p266
aVthree big ideas will have come to your attention.
p267
aVThe first is that this is the era of the brain.
p268
aVAnd indeed, there have been staggering discoveries in neuroscience:
p269
aVlocalizing functionally specialized regions of cortex,
p270
aVturning mouse brains transparent,
p271
aVactivating neurons with light.
p272
aVA second big idea
p273
aVis that this is the era of big data and machine learning,
p274
aVand machine learning promises to revolutionize our understanding
p275
aVof everything from social networks to epidemiology.
p276
aVAnd maybe, as it tackles problems of scene understanding
p277
aVand natural language processing,
p278
aVto tell us something about human cognition.
p279
aVAnd the final big idea you'll have heard
p280
aVis that maybe it's a good idea we're going to know so much about brains
p281
aVand have so much access to big data,
p282
aVbecause left to our own devices,
p283
aVhumans are fallible, we take shortcuts,
p284
aVwe err, we make mistakes,
p285
aVwe're biased, and in innumerable ways,
p286
aVwe get the world wrong.
p287
aVI think these are all important stories,
p288
aVand they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be human,
p289
aVbut I want you to note that today I told you a very different story.
p290
aVIt's a story about minds and not brains,
p291
aVand in particular, it's a story about the kinds of computations
p292
aVthat uniquely human minds can perform,
p293
aVwhich involve rich, structured knowledge and the ability to learn
p294
aVfrom small amounts of data, the evidence of just a few examples.
p295
aVAnd fundamentally, it's a story about how starting as very small children
p296
aVand continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments
p297
aVof our culture,
p298
aVwe get the world right.
p299
aa(lp300
VFolks, human minds do not only learn from small amounts of data.
p301
aVHuman minds think of altogether new ideas.
p302
aVHuman minds generate research and discovery,
p303
aVand human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater,
p304
aVand human minds take care of other humans:
p305
aVour old, our young, our sick.
p306
aVWe even heal them.
p307
aVIn the years to come, we're going to see technological innovations
p308
aVbeyond anything I can even envision,
p309
aVbut we are very unlikely
p310
aVto see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child
p311
aVin my lifetime or in yours.
p312
aVIf we invest in these most powerful learners and their development,
p313
aVin babies and children
p314
aVand mothers and fathers
p315
aVand caregivers and teachers
p316
aVthe ways we invest in our other most powerful and elegant forms
p317
aVof technology, engineering and design,
p318
aVwe will not just be dreaming of a better future,
p319
aVwe will be planning for one.
p320
aa(lp321
VThank you very much.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Applause)
p324
aa(lp325
VChris Anderson: Laura, thank you. I do actually have a question for you.
p326
aVFirst of all, the research is insane.
p327
aVI mean, who would design an experiment like that? (Laughter)
p328
aVI've seen that a couple of times,
p329
aVand I still don't honestly believe that that can truly be happening,
p330
aVbut other people have done similar experiments; it checks out.
p331
aVThe babies really are that genius.
p332
aa(lp333
VLS: You know, they look really impressive in our experiments,
p334
aVbut think about what they look like in real life, right?
p335
aVIt starts out as a baby.
p336
aVEighteen months later, it's talking to you,
p337
aVand babies' first words aren't just things like balls and ducks,
p338
aVthey're things like "all gone," which refer to disappearance,
p339
aVor "uh-oh," which refer to unintentional actions.
p340
aVIt has to be that powerful.
p341
aVIt has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you.
p342
aVThey're figuring out the entire world.
p343
aVA four-year-old can talk to you about almost anything.
p344
aV(Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VCA: And if I understand you right, the other key point you're making is,
p347
aVwe've been through these years where there's all this talk
p348
aVof how quirky and buggy our minds are,
p349
aVthat behavioral economics and the whole theories behind that
p350
aVthat we're not rational agents.
p351
aVYou're really saying that the bigger story is how extraordinary,
p352
aVand there really is genius there that is underappreciated.
p353
aa(lp354
VLS: One of my favorite quotes in psychology
p355
aVcomes from the social psychologist Solomon Asch,
p356
aVand he said the fundamental task of psychology is to remove
p357
aVthe veil of self-evidence from things.
p358
aVThere are orders of magnitude more decisions you make every day
p359
aVthat get the world right.
p360
aVYou know about objects and their properties.
p361
aVYou know them when they're occluded. You know them in the dark.
p362
aVYou can walk through rooms.
p363
aVYou can figure out what other people are thinking. You can talk to them.
p364
aVYou can navigate space. You know about numbers.
p365
aVYou know causal relationships. You know about moral reasoning.
p366
aVYou do this effortlessly, so we don't see it,
p367
aVbut that is how we get the world right, and it's a remarkable
p368
aVand very difficult-to-understand accomplishment.
p369
aa(lp370
VCA: I suspect there are people in the audience who have
p371
aVthis view of accelerating technological power
p372
aVwho might dispute your statement that never in our lifetimes
p373
aVwill a computer do what a three-year-old child can do,
p374
aVbut what's clear is that in any scenario,
p375
aVour machines have so much to learn from our toddlers.
p376
aVLS: I think so. You'll have some machine learning folks up here.
p377
aVI mean, you should never bet against babies or chimpanzees
p378
aVor technology as a matter of practice,
p379
aVbut it's not just a difference in quantity,
p380
aVit's a difference in kind.
p381
aVWe have incredibly powerful computers,
p382
aVand they do do amazingly sophisticated things,
p383
aVoften with very big amounts of data.
p384
aVHuman minds do, I think, something quite different,
p385
aVand I think it's the structured, hierarchical nature of human knowledge
p386
aVthat remains a real challenge.
p387
aa(lp388
VCA: Laura Schulz, wonderful food for thought. Thank you so much.
p389
aa(lp390

VWhen I'm starting talks like this,
p5
aVI usually do a whole spiel about sustainability
p6
aVbecause a lot of people out there don't know what that is.
p7
aVThis is a crowd that does know what it is,
p8
aVso I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?
p9
aVSo just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?
p10
aVFill in the blanks.
p11
aVSo, you know, sustainability, small planet.
p12
aVRight? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.
p13
aVYou know, about a million years ago,
p14
aVa bunch of monkeys fell out of trees,
p15
aVgot a little clever, harnessed fire,
p16
aVinvented the printing press,
p17
aVmade, you know, luggage with wheels on it.
p18
aVAnd, you know, built the society that we now live in.
p19
aVUnfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt,
p20
aVthe most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created,
p21
aVit's got some major, major flaws.
p22
aa(lp23
VOne of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.
p24
aVIt has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.
p25
aVHow much stuff goes through your life,
p26
aVhow much waste is left behind you.
p27
aVAnd we, at the moment, in our society,
p28
aVhave a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.
p29
aVWe're using up about five planets.
p30
aVIf everybody on the planet lived the way we did,
p31
aVwe'd need between five, six, seven,
p32
aVsome people even say 10 planets to make it.
p33
aVClearly we don't have 10 planets.
p34
aVAgain, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet,
p35
aV10 planets, one planet. Right?
p36
aVWe don't have that. So that's one problem.
p37
aa(lp38
VThe second problem is that the planet that we have
p39
aVis being used in wildly unfair ways. Right?
p40
aVNorth Americans, such as myself, you know,
p41
aVwe're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs,
p42
aVand we're eating all sorts of stuff.
p43
aVAnd, you know, then you get all the way down
p44
aVto people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa.
p45
aVAnd people simply do not have enough to survive.
p46
aVThis is producing all sorts of tensions,
p47
aVall sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.
p48
aVAnd there's more and more people on the way. Right?
p49
aVSo, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years.
p50
aVIt's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet.
p53
aVA third of the people on this planet are kids.
p54
aVAnd those kids are growing up in a completely different way
p55
aVthan their parents did, no matter where they live.
p56
aVThey've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity.
p57
aVAnd they may not want to live exactly like us.
p58
aVThey may not want to be Americans, or Brits,
p59
aVor Germans, or South Africans,
p60
aVbut they want their own version
p61
aVof a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic,
p62
aVand more, you know, enjoyable.
p63
aVAnd all of these things combine to create
p64
aVan enormous amount of torque on the planet.
p65
aVAnd if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque,
p66
aVwe are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly
p67
aVfacing situations which are simply unthinkable.
p68
aa(lp69
VEverybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios.
p70
aVI don't need to go into that.
p71
aVBut I will ask the question, what's the alternative?
p72
aVAnd I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.
p73
aVYou know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable;
p74
aVon the other hand we have the unimaginable.
p75
aVWe don't know yet how to build a society
p76
aVwhich is environmentally sustainable,
p77
aVwhich is shareable with everybody on the planet,
p78
aVwhich promotes stability and democracy and human rights,
p79
aVand which is achievable in the time-frame necessary
p80
aVto make it through the challenges we face.
p81
aVWe don't know how to do this yet.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo what's Worldchanging?
p84
aVWell, Worldchanging you might think of
p85
aVas being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.
p86
aVYou know, what we're out there doing is looking
p87
aVfor examples of tools, models and ideas,
p88
aVwhich, if widely adopted, would change the game.
p89
aVA lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things
p90
aVthat everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of,
p91
aVbut most people haven't.
p92
aVSo I thought today I'd do something a little different,
p93
aVand talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know,
p94
aVrather than giving you tried-and-true examples.
p95
aVTalk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.
p96
aVGive you a little peek into our editorial notebook.
p97
aVAnd given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick.
p98
aVSo, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?
p99
aa(lp100
VSo, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city.
p101
aVOne of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world
p102
aVfor changing the impact that we have on the planet
p103
aVis changing the way that we live in cities.
p104
aVWe're already an urban planet;
p105
aVthat's especially true in the developed world.
p106
aVAnd people who live in cities in the developed world
p107
aVtend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff.
p108
aVIf we can change the dynamic,
p109
aVby first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...
p110
aVHere, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there,
p111
aVyou ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city.
p112
aVAnd they are doing density, new density,
p113
aVbetter than probably anybody else on the planet right now.
p114
aVThey're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars,
p115
aVwhich is a pretty great thing.
p116
aVSo you have density. You also have growth management.
p117
aVYou leave aside what is natural to be natural.
p118
aa(lp119
VThis is in Portland. That is an actual development.
p120
aVThat land there will remain pasture in perpetuity.
p121
aVThey've bounded the city with a line.
p122
aVNature, city. Nothing changes.
p123
aVOnce you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.
p124
aVYou can start doing things like, you know,
p125
aVtransit systems that actually work to transport people,
p126
aVin effective and reasonably comfortable manners.
p127
aVYou can also start to change what you build.
p128
aVThis is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London,
p129
aVwhich is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place.
p130
aVWe're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity,
p131
aVthat recycle much of their water,
p132
aVthat are much more comfortable than standard buildings,
p133
aVuse all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less.
p134
aVGreen roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut once you also have people living
p137
aVin close proximity to each other,
p138
aVone of the things you can do is \u2014
p139
aVas information technologies develop \u2014
p140
aVyou can start to have smart places.
p141
aVYou can start to know where things are.
p142
aVWhen you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.
p143
aVWhen you share them, you end up using less.
p144
aVSo one great example is car-share clubs,
p145
aVwhich are really starting to take off in the U.S.,
p146
aVhave already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example.
p147
aVIf you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week,
p148
aVdo you really need your own car?
p149
aa(lp150
VAnother thing that information technology lets us do
p151
aVis start figuring out how to use less stuff
p152
aVby knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using.
p153
aVSo, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use,
p154
aVwhich I think is a pretty cool concept,
p155
aValthough I think it ought to work the other way around,
p156
aVthat it gets brighter the more you don't use.
p157
aVBut, you know, there may even be a simpler approach.
p158
aVWe could just re-label things.
p159
aVThis light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods,
p160
aVand on the other hand, off.
p161
aVHow we build things can change as well.
p162
aVThis is a bio-morphic building.
p163
aVIt takes its inspiration in form from life.
p164
aVMany of these buildings are incredibly beautiful,
p165
aVand also much more effective.
p166
aVThis is an example of bio-mimicry,
p167
aVwhich is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.
p168
aVIn this case, you have a shell design
p169
aVwhich was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective.
p170
aVThere's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable.
p171
aVI encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.
p172
aVWe're starting to cover this more and more.
p173
aVThere's also neo-biological design,
p174
aVwhere more and more we're actually using life itself
p175
aVand the processes of life to become part of our industry.
p176
aVSo this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae.
p177
aVSo we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for
p178
aVof how to take the cities most of us live in,
p179
aVand turn them into Bright Green cities.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in.
p182
aVThey live in the emerging megacities of the developing world.
p183
aVAnd there's a statistic I often like to use,
p184
aVwhich is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days,
p185
aVa city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.
p186
aVI was giving a talk about two months ago,
p187
aVand this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me
p188
aVand was really flustered, and he said, look,
p189
aVyou've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong.
p190
aVIt's every seven days.
p191
aVSo, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days,
p192
aVand most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in.
p193
aVMost of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.
p194
aVThey don't have existing infrastructure;
p195
aVthey have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty,
p196
aVand enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out
p197
aVhow to do things in new ways.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo what do we need in order to make developing nation
p200
aVmegacities into Bright Green megacities?
p201
aVWell, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.
p202
aVAnd this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.
p203
aVThe idea behind leapfrogging is that
p204
aVif you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation
p205
aVwhere you don't have the tools and technologies that you need,
p206
aVthere's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right?
p207
aVThat you're much better off, almost universally,
p208
aVlooking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology.
p209
aVOne place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right?
p210
aVAll throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones,
p211
aVskipping the whole landline stage.
p212
aVIf there are landlines in many developing world cities,
p213
aVthey're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot
p214
aVand cost enormous amounts of money.
p215
aVSo I rather like this picture here.
p216
aVI particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone.
p217
aVSo what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society.
p218
aVWe've heard all about this here this week,
p219
aVso I won't say too much more than that, other than to say
p220
aVwhat is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe second thing is tools for collaboration,
p223
aVbe they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems
p224
aVwhich encourage collaboration. Right?
p225
aVWhen you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate,
p226
aVyou get different kinds of solutions.
p227
aVAnd those solutions are accessible in a different way
p228
aVto people who don't have capital. Right?
p229
aVSo, you know, we have open source software,
p230
aVwe have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.
p231
aVAnd those things lead to things like this.
p232
aVThis is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.
p233
aVThis is a pretty remarkable program
p234
aVusing free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines,
p235
aVand basically sort of abandoned buildings \u2014
p236
aVhas put together a bunch of community centers
p237
aVwhere people can come in, get high-speed internet access,
p238
aVlearn computer programming skills for free.
p239
aVAnd a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.
p240
aVAnd those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.
p241
aVI particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VSo one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion.
p244
aVAnd one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging
p245
aVis the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself,
p246
aVand re-categorizing itself in ways
p247
aVthat have less and less to do with most of us in this room.
p248
aVSo it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right?
p249
aVYou know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.
p250
aVIt's doing something new. There's new things happening.
p251
aVThere's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things.
p252
aVLike, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie "City of God?"
p253
aVYeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.
p254
aVAnd it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.
p255
aa(lp256
VYou have other radical examples
p257
aVwhere the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.
p258
aVThese are people who have just been visited by
p259
aVthe Internet bookmobile in Uganda.
p260
aVAnd who are waving their first books in the air,
p261
aVwhich, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know?
p262
aVSo you also have the ability for people to start coming together
p263
aVand acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways,
p264
aVin ways that haven't happened before.
p265
aVAnd as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week,
p266
aVare absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions,
p267
aVis we've got to craft new political realities.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities,
p270
aVnot only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan,
p271
aVwhat have you, but here at home as well.
p272
aVAnother world is possible.
p273
aVAnd sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right?
p274
aVWe tweak that a lot.
p275
aVWe talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here.
p276
aVThat it's not just that we have to sort of imagine
p277
aVthere being a different, vague possibility out there,
p278
aVbut we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.
p279
aVWe need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil.
p280
aVHow many people knew of Lula before today?
p281
aVOK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.
p282
aVSo Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions,
p283
aVbut one of the things that he's doing is,
p284
aVhe is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that
p285
aVcompletely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue
p286
aVinto a whole new way of global collaboration.
p287
aVI would keep your eye on this fellow.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnother example of this sort of second superpower thing
p290
aVis the rise of these games that are what we call "serious play."
p291
aVWe're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere.
p292
aVThis is from "A Force More Powerful." It's a little screenshot.
p293
aV"A Force More Powerful" is a video game that,
p294
aVwhile you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage
p295
aVin non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter)
p296
aVHere's another one. This is from a game called "Food Force,"
p297
aVwhich is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.
p298
aVThese things are all contributing in a very dynamic way
p299
aVto a huge rise in, especially in the developing world,
p300
aVin people's interest in and passion for democracy.
p301
aVWe get so little news about the developing world
p302
aVthat we often forget that there are literally
p303
aVmillions of people out there struggling to change things
p304
aVto be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt.
p305
aVAnd, you know, we don't hear those stories enough.
p306
aVBut it's happening all over the place,
p307
aVand these tools are part of what's making it possible.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow when you add all those things together,
p310
aVwhen you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools,
p311
aVyou know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get?
p312
aVWell, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world.
p313
aVYou get, for example, green power spread throughout the world.
p314
aVYou get \u2014 this is a building in Hyderabad, India.
p315
aVIt's the greenest building in the world.
p316
aVYou get grassroots solutions, things that work
p317
aVfor people who have no capital or limited access.
p318
aVYou get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.
p319
aVYou get access to distance medicine.
p320
aVThese are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs
p321
aVto access databases that have information
p322
aVthat they don't have access to at home in a distant manner.
p323
aVYou get new tools for people in the developing world.
p324
aVThese are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there,
p325
aVfor whom nightfall means darkness,
p326
aVto have a new means of operating.
p327
aVThese are refrigerators that require no electricity;
p328
aVthey're pot within a pot design.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems.
p331
aVHere's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap
p332
aVand available to people in the developing world.
p333
aVHere's a design for distilling water using sunlight.
p334
aVHere's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area,
p335
aVwill distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.
p336
aVHere's a way of transporting water.
p337
aVI just love this, you know \u2014 I mean carrying water is such a drag,
p338
aVand somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?
p339
aVI mean, that's a great design.
p340
aVThis is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.
p341
aVBasically you can suck any water through this
p342
aVand it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.
p343
aVSo, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this.
p344
aVThis is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.
p345
aVThis is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout,
p346
aVwhich pumps water as kids play. You know?
p347
aVSeriously \u2014 give that one a hand, it's pretty great.
p348
aVAnd the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?
p349
aa(lp350
VWe're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020
p351
aVbecause of climate change and political instability.
p352
aVHow do we help people like that?
p353
aVWell, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs
p354
aVthat are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet.
p355
aVSome of those designs include models for acting,
p356
aVsuch as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.
p357
aVNew models for pedagogy for the displaced.
p358
aVAnd we have new tools.
p359
aVThis is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere.
p360
aVDoes anyone know what this is?
p361
aa(lp362
VAudience: It detects landmines.
p363
aa(lp364
VAlex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower.
p365
aVIf you are living in one of the places
p366
aVwhere the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered,
p367
aVyou can fling these seeds out into the field.
p368
aVAnd as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines,
p369
aVtheir roots will detect the chemicals in them,
p370
aVand where the flowers turn red you don't step.
p371
aVYeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know?
p372
aa(lp373
V(Applause)
p374
aa(lp375
VI also love it because it seems to me
p376
aVthat the example, the tools we use to change the world,
p377
aVought to be beautiful in themselves.
p378
aVYou know, that it's not just enough to survive.
p379
aVWe've got to make something better than what we've got.
p380
aVAnd I think that we will.
p381
aVJust to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells,
p382
aVI think that better things are on the way.
p383
aVI think that, in fact, that "all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning.
p384
aVAll that the human mind has accomplished
p385
aVis but the dream before the awakening."
p386
aVI hope that that turns out to be true.
p387
aVThe people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.
p388
aa(lp389
VThank you very much.

VI'm really excited to be here today.
p5
aVI'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab,
p6
aVliterally, and I'm really glad that you guys
p7
aVare going to be among the first to see it in person,
p8
aVbecause I really think this is going to really change
p9
aVthe way we interact with machines from this point on.
p10
aa(lp11
VNow, this is a rear-projected drafting table.
p12
aVIt's about 36 inches wide
p13
aVand it's equipped with a multi-touch sensor.
p14
aVNormal touch sensors that you see,
p15
aVlike on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards,
p16
aVcan only register one point of contact at a time.
p17
aVThis thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time.
p18
aVThey can use both my hands; I can use chording actions;
p19
aVI can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if I wanted to.
p20
aVYou know, like that.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, multi-touch sensing isn't completely new.
p23
aVPeople like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s.
p24
aVHowever, the approach I built here is actually high-resolution,
p25
aVlow-cost, and probably most importantly, very scalable.
p26
aVSo, the technology, you know,
p27
aVisn't the most exciting thing here right now,
p28
aVother than probably its newfound accessibility.
p29
aVWhat's really interesting here is what you can do with it
p30
aVand the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it.
p31
aVSo let's see.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo, for instance, we have a lava lamp application here.
p34
aVNow, you can see,
p35
aVI can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together.
p36
aVI can inject heat into the system here,
p37
aVor I can pull it apart with two of my fingers.
p38
aVIt's completely intuitive; there's no instruction manual.
p39
aVThe interface just kind of disappears.
p40
aVThis started out as a screensaver app
p41
aVthat one of the Ph.D. students in our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made.
p42
aVBut I think its true identity comes out here.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know,
p45
aVI could be doing this with as many fingers here,
p46
aVbut of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user.
p47
aVChris could be interacting with another part of Lava,
p48
aVwhile I play around with it here.
p49
aVYou can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool,
p50
aVwhere I'm kind of warming something up, making it malleable,
p51
aVand then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state.
p52
aVGoogle should have something like this in their lobby.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VI'll show you a little more of a concrete example here,
p57
aVas this thing loads.
p58
aVThis is a photographer's light-box application.
p59
aVAgain, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around.
p60
aVBut what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers,
p61
aVI can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily.
p62
aVI can pan, zoom and rotate it effortlessly.
p63
aVI can do that grossly with both of my hands,
p64
aVor I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together.
p65
aVIf I grab the canvas, I can do the same thing \u2014 stretch it out.
p66
aVI can do it simultaneously, holding this down,
p67
aVand gripping on another one, stretching this out.
p68
aa(lp69
VAgain, the interface just disappears here.
p70
aVThere's no manual.
p71
aVThis is exactly what you expect,
p72
aVespecially if you haven't interacted with a computer before.
p73
aVNow, when you have initiatives like the $100 laptop,
p74
aVI kind of cringe at the idea
p75
aVof introducing a whole new generation to computing
p76
aVwith this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface.
p77
aVThis is something that I think is really the way
p78
aVwe should be interacting with machines from now on.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause)
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aVAnd I can bring that around, put that up there.
p86
aVObviously, this is a standard keyboard,
p87
aVbut of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands.
p88
aVThat's really important, because there's no reason in this day and age
p89
aVthat we should be conforming to a physical device.
p90
aVThat leads to bad things, like RSI.
p91
aVWe have so much technology nowadays
p92
aVthat these interfaces should start conforming to us.
p93
aVThere's so little applied now to actually improving
p94
aVthe way we interact with interfaces from this point on.
p95
aVThis keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go.
p96
aVYou can imagine, in the future, as we develop this kind of technology,
p97
aVa keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away,
p98
aVand really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke.
p99
aVSo \u2014 again, isn't this great?
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VAudience: Where's your lab?
p104
aa(lp105
VJeff Han: I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York.
p106
aa(lp107
VHere's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls.
p108
aVIt'll remember the strokes I'm making.
p109
aVOf course I can do it with all my hands.
p110
aVIt's pressure-sensitive.
p111
aVWhat's neat about that is,
p112
aVI showed that two-finger gesture that zooms in really quickly.
p113
aVBecause you don't have to switch to a hand tool
p114
aVor the magnifying glass tool,
p115
aVyou can just continuously make things
p116
aVin real multiple scales, all at the same time.
p117
aVI can create big things out here,
p118
aVbut I can go back and really quickly go back
p119
aVto where I started, and make even smaller things here.
p120
aa(lp121
VThis is going to be really important
p122
aVas we start getting to things like data visualization.
p123
aVFor instance, I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk,
p124
aVand he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time:
p125
aVWe have all this great data,
p126
aVbut for some reason, it's just sitting there.
p127
aVWe're not accessing it.
p128
aVAnd one of the reasons why I think that is
p129
aVwill be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools,
p130
aVbut I also think a big part of it
p131
aVis going to be having better interfaces,
p132
aVto be able to drill down into this kind of data,
p133
aVwhile still thinking about the big picture here.
p134
aa(lp135
VLet me show you another app here. This is called WorldWind.
p136
aVIt's done by NASA.
p137
aVWe've all seen Google Earth;
p138
aVthis is an open-source version of that.
p139
aVThere are plug-ins to be able to load in different data sets
p140
aVthat NASA's collected over the years.
p141
aVAs you can see, I can use the same two-fingered gestures
p142
aVto go down and go in really seamlessly.
p143
aVThere's no interface, again.
p144
aVIt really allows anybody to kind of go in \u2014
p145
aVand it just does what you'd expect, you know?
p146
aVAgain, there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears.
p147
aVI can switch to different data views.
p148
aVThat's what's neat about this app here.
p149
aVNASA's really cool.
p150
aVThese hyper-spectral images are false-colored so you can \u2014
p151
aVit's really good for determining vegetative use.
p152
aVWell, let's go back to this.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe great thing about mapping applications \u2014
p155
aVit's not really 2D, it's 3D.
p156
aVSo, again, with a multi-point interface, you can do a gesture like this \u2014
p157
aVso you can be able to tilt around like that \u2014
p158
aa(lp159
V(Surprised laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VIt's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion.
p162
aVThis gesture is just putting two fingers down \u2014
p163
aVit's defining an axis of tilt \u2014 and I can tilt up and down that way.
p164
aVWe just came up with that on the spot,
p165
aVit's probably not the right thing to do,
p166
aVbut there's such interesting things you can do with this interface.
p167
aVIt's just so much fun playing around with it, too.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd so the last thing I want to show you is \u2014
p172
aVI'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps
p173
aVthat you can do with this thing.
p174
aVI'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this.
p175
aVNow, here's a simple application here \u2014 I can draw out a curve.
p176
aVAnd when I close it, it becomes a character.
p177
aVBut the neat thing about it is I can add control points.
p178
aVAnd then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time.
p179
aVAnd you notice what it does.
p180
aVIt's kind of a puppeteering thing,
p181
aVwhere I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make \u2014
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, there's a lot of actual math going on under here
p184
aVfor this to control this mesh and do the right thing.
p185
aVThis technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here, with multiple control points,
p186
aVis actually state of the art.
p187
aVIt was released at SIGGRAPH last year.
p188
aVIt's a great example of the kind of research I really love:
p189
aVall this compute power to make things do the right things,
p190
aVintuitive things, to do exactly what you expect.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo, multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI.
p193
aVI'm not the only one doing it, a lot of other people are getting into it.
p194
aVThis kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it,
p195
aVI'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days
p196
aVand seeing how it can apply to your respective fields.
p197
aa(lp198
VThank you.

intuitive &quot;interface-free&quot; computer displays -- controlled by the touch of fingertips -- will change forever the way you think about computers. At TED 2006, <strong>the audience whistled, clapped and gasped audibly as Han demoed (for the first time publicly) his prototype drafting table-cum-touch display</strong>, developed at <a href=\\"http://www.cims.nyu.edu/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">NYU&#39;s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>. The demo included a virtual lightbox, where he moved photos by fingertip -- as if they were paper on a desk -- flicking them across the screen and zooming in and out by pinching two fingers together, as well as a Google Earth-like map that he tilted and flew over with simple moves. </p><p>When the demo hit the web, bloggers and YouTubers made him a bit of a megastar. (His video has been watched more than 600,000 times on YouTube alone; &quot;Amazing,&quot; &quot;Incredible&quot; and &quot;Freaking awesome&quot; are the typical responses there. Also: <strong>&quot;When can I buy one?&quot;</strong>) After this legendary demo, Han launched a startup called <a href=\\"http://www.perceptivepixel.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Perceptive Pixel</a>  -- and when he came back to TED2007, he and his team brought an entire interactive wall, where TEDsters lined up to play virtual guitars.

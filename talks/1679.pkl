VWell, I was introduced as
p5
aVthe former Governor of Michigan,
p6
aVbut actually I'm a scientist.
p7
aVAll right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count,
p8
aVbut my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy
p9
aVthat is Michigan, and, like any good scientist,
p10
aVI was experimenting with policy
p11
aVabout what would achieve the greatest good
p12
aVfor the greatest number.
p13
aVBut there were three problems, three enigmas
p14
aVthat I could not solve,
p15
aVand I want to share with you those problems,
p16
aVbut most importantly,
p17
aVI think I figured out a proposal for a solution.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe first problem
p20
aVthat not just Michigan, but every state, faces is,
p21
aVhow do you create good jobs in America
p22
aVin a global economy?
p23
aa(lp24
VSo let me share with you some empirical data from my lab.
p25
aVI was elected in 2002 and, at the end of my first year in office in 2003,
p26
aVI got a call from one of my staff members, who said,
p27
aV"Gov, we have a big problem.
p28
aVWe have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan,
p29
aVpopulation 8,000,
p30
aVand they are about to lose their major employer,
p31
aVwhich is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux."
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?"
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd he said, "3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville."
p36
aa(lp37
VSo it is a one-company town.
p38
aVAnd Electrolux was going to go to Mexico.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I said, "Forget that. I'm the new Governor.
p41
aVWe can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville
p42
aVwith my whole cabinet and we will just
p43
aVmake Electrolux an offer they can't refuse."
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I brought my whole cabinet,
p46
aVand we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little Greenville \u2014
p47
aVthe mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college \u2014
p48
aVand we basically emptied our pockets
p49
aVand put all of our chips on the table,
p50
aVincentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay,
p51
aVand as we made our pile of chips,
p52
aVwe slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux.
p53
aVAnd in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years,
p54
aVor that we'd help to build a new factory for the company,
p55
aVwe'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers,
p56
aVsaid they would offer unprecedented concessions,
p57
aVsacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo the management of Electrolux took our pile,
p60
aVour list of incentives, and they went outside the room
p61
aVfor 17 minutes,
p62
aVand they came back in and they said,
p63
aV"Wow, this is the most generous
p64
aVany community has ever been to try to keep jobs here.
p65
aVBut there's nothing you can do
p66
aVto compensate for the fact that we can pay $1.57 an hour
p67
aVin Juarez, Mexico. So we're leaving."
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd they did. And when they did, it was like
p70
aVa nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville.
p71
aVIn fact, they did implode the factory.
p72
aVThat's a guy that is walking on his last day of work.
p73
aVAnd on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line,
p74
aVthe employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan,
p75
aVhad a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper.
p76
aVIt was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion,
p77
aVand I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor
p78
aVthat I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs,
p79
aVand I wanted to grieve with them,
p80
aVand as I went into the room\u2014 there's thousands of people there.
p81
aVIt was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches
p82
aVon roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music,
p83
aVor a band playing sad music, probably both. (Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd this guy comes up to me,
p86
aVand he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on,
p87
aVand he had his two daughters with him,
p88
aVand he said, "Gov, these are my two daughters."
p89
aVHe said, "I'm 48 years old,
p90
aVand I have worked at this factory for 30 years.
p91
aVI went from high school to factory.
p92
aVMy father worked at this factory," he said.
p93
aV"My grandfather worked at this factory.
p94
aVAll I know is how to make refrigerators."
p95
aVAnd he looked at his daughters,
p96
aVand he puts his hand on his chest,
p97
aVand he says, "So, Gov, tell me,
p98
aVwho is ever going to hire me?
p99
aVWho is ever going to hire me?"
p100
aVAnd that was asked not just by that guy
p101
aVbut by everyone in the pavilion,
p102
aVand frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories
p103
aVthat closed in the first decade of this century.
p104
aVEnigma number one: How do you create jobs
p105
aVin America in a global economy?
p106
aa(lp107
VNumber two, very quickly:
p108
aVHow do you solve global climate change
p109
aVwhen we don't even have a national energy policy in this country
p110
aVand when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?
p111
aVIn fact, there was a poll that was done recently
p112
aVand the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings
p113
aVto a number of other unpleasant things,
p114
aVand it was found, in fact, that Congress's approval rating
p115
aVis worse than cockroaches,
p116
aVlice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump. (Laughter)
p117
aVBut wait, the good news is it's at least better
p118
aVthan meth labs and gonorrhea. (Laughter)
p119
aVWe got a problem, folks.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo it got me thinking, what is it?
p122
aVWhat in the laboratory that I see out there,
p123
aVthe laboratories of democracy, what has happened?
p124
aVWhat policy prescriptions have happened
p125
aVthat actually cause changes to occur
p126
aVand that have been accepted in a bipartisan way?
p127
aVSo if I asked you, for example,
p128
aVwhat was the Obama Administration policy
p129
aVthat caused massive changes across the country,
p130
aVwhat would you say?
p131
aVYou might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes.
p132
aVAs we know, only half the states have opted in.
p133
aVWe might say the Recovery Act, but those didn't require policy changes.
p134
aVThe thing that caused massive policy changes to occur
p135
aVwas Race to the Top for education.
p136
aVWhy? The government put a $4.5 billion pot
p137
aVand said to the governors across the country, compete for it.
p138
aVForty-eight governors competed,
p139
aVconvincing 48 state legislatures to essentially
p140
aVraise standards for high schoolers
p141
aVso that they all take a college prep curriculum.
p142
aVForty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo I thought, well, why can't we do something like that
p145
aVand create a clean energy jobs race to the top?
p146
aVBecause after all, if you look at the context,
p147
aV1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years
p148
aVfrom the private sector globally,
p149
aVand every dollar represents a job,
p150
aVand where are those jobs going?
p151
aVWell, they're going to places that have policy, like China.
p152
aVIn fact, I was in China to see what they were doing,
p153
aVand they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that I was with,
p154
aVand I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations
p155
aVand standing next to one of the Chinese officials,
p156
aVand we were watching, and he says,
p157
aV"So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy?"
p158
aVAnd I said, "Oh my God \u2014 Congress, gridlock, who knows?"
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd this is what he did, he goes, he says,
p161
aV"Take your time."
p162
aVBecause they see our passivity as their opportunity.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo what if we decided to create
p165
aVa challenge to the governors of the country,
p166
aVand the price to entry into this competition
p167
aVused the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress
p168
aVfor the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion,
p169
aVwhich sounds like a lot, but actually it's less than
p170
aVone tenth of one percent of federal spending.
p171
aVIt's a rounding error on the federal side.
p172
aVBut price to entry into that competition would be,
p173
aVyou could just, say, use the President's goal.
p174
aVHe wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard
p175
aVof 80 percent by 2030,
p176
aVin other words, that you'd have to get 80 percent
p177
aVof your energy from clean sources by the year 2030.
p178
aVWhy not ask all of the states to do that instead?
p179
aVAnd imagine what might happen,
p180
aVbecause every region has something to offer.
p181
aVYou might take states like Iowa and Ohio \u2014
p182
aVtwo very important political states, by the way \u2014
p183
aVthose two governors, and they would say,
p184
aVwe're going to lead the nation in producing
p185
aVthe wind turbines and the wind energy.
p186
aVYou might say the solar states, the sun belt,
p187
aVwe're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country,
p188
aVand maybe Jerry Brown says, "Well, I'm going to create
p189
aVan industry cluster in California
p190
aVto be able to produce the solar panels
p191
aVso that we're not buying them from China
p192
aVbut we're buying them from the U.S."
p193
aVIn fact, every region of the country could do this.
p194
aVYou see, you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation.
p195
aVIn fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states
p196
aVin the West, they could do geothermal,
p197
aVor you could look at Texas and say,
p198
aVwe could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid.
p199
aVIn the middle eastern states which have access to forests
p200
aVand to agricultural waste, they might say,
p201
aVwe're going to lead the nation in biofuels.
p202
aVIn the upper northeast, we're going to lead the nation
p203
aVin energy efficiency solutions.
p204
aVAlong the eastern seaboard, we're going to lead the nation
p205
aVin offshore wind.
p206
aVYou might look at Michigan and say, we're going to lead the nation
p207
aVin producing the guts for the electric vehicle, like the lithium ion battery.
p208
aVEvery region has something to offer,
p209
aVand if you created a competition,
p210
aVit respects the states and it respects federalism.
p211
aVIt's opt-in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina,
p212
aVwho didn't opt into the education Race to the Top,
p213
aVyou might even get them to opt in. Why?
p214
aVBecause Republican and Democratic governors
p215
aVlove to cut ribbons.
p216
aVWe want to bring jobs. I'm just saying.
p217
aVAnd it fosters innovation at the state level
p218
aVin these laboratories of democracy.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately
p221
aVmight say, "Okay, great idea, but really?
p222
aVCongress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table?
p223
aVThey can't agree to anything."
p224
aVSo you could wait and go through Congress,
p225
aValthough you should be very impatient.
p226
aVOr, you renegades, we could go around Congress.
p227
aVGo around Congress.
p228
aVWhat if we created a private sector challenge to the governors?
p229
aVWhat if several of the high-net worth companies
p230
aVand individuals who are here at TED decided
p231
aVthat they would create, band together, just a couple of them,
p232
aVand create a national competition to the governors
p233
aVto have a race to the top
p234
aVand see how the governors respond?
p235
aVWhat if it all started here at TED?
p236
aVWhat if you were here
p237
aVwhen we figured out how to crack the code
p238
aVto create good paying jobs in America \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p239
aVand get national energy policy
p240
aVand we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up?
p241
aa(lp242
VBecause, dear TEDsters,
p243
aVif you are impatient like I am,
p244
aVyou know that our economic competitors,
p245
aVour other nations, are in the game
p246
aVand are eating us for lunch.
p247
aVAnd we can get in the game or not.
p248
aVWe can be at the table or we can be on the table.
p249
aVAnd I don't know about you,
p250
aVbut I prefer to dine.
p251
aa(lp252
VThank you all so much. (Applause)

Granholm was elected governor of Michigan in 2002, and in 2006, she was re-elected with the largest number of votes ever cast for governor in Michigan. As governor, Granholm led the state through a brutal economic downturn that resulted from a meltdown in the automotive and manufacturing sectors. She worked relentlessly to diversify the state&rsquo;s economy, strengthen its auto industry, preserve the advancedmanufacturing sector, and add new, emerging sectors, such as clean energy, to Michigan&rsquo;s economic portfolio.&nbsp;</p><p>During her tenure, she pioneered clean energy policies, working with business and labor, Republicans and Democrats to create new economic opportunities in Michigan. In 2005, the Granholm economic development team put together an aggressive strategy to make Michigan the hub of clean-energy development in North America by developing entire supply chains in Michigan, fostering critical partnerships between industry, government and researchers and by creating economic incentives that made Michigan the place to locate. Granholm&rsquo;s plan included specific clustering strategies targeted at battery manufacturing, bio-energy, solar and wind power. Her leadership attracted to Michigan more than 89,000clean energy jobs and $9.4 billion in investments in that sector. &nbsp;By the time she left office at the start of 2011, Michigan&rsquo;s economy was rebounding and Gallup listed Michigan as state with the most improved jobs climate.&nbsp;</p><p>Her book&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/3ZRq\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>A Governor&rsquo;s Story: The Fight for Jobs and America&rsquo;s Economic Future</em></a>&nbsp;tells how Michigan pioneered ways out of an economic storm and offers&nbsp; advice for a nation desperate to create jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "jennifer_granholm", "whotheyare": "A former two-term governor of Michigan, Jennifer M.

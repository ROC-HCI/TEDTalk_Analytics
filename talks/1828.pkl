VWe are going to take a quick voyage
p5
aVover the cognitive history of the 20th century,
p6
aVbecause during that century,
p7
aVour minds have altered dramatically.
p8
aVAs you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900
p9
aVhave altered because the roads are better
p10
aVand because of technology.
p11
aVAnd our minds have altered, too.
p12
aVWe've gone from people who confronted a concrete world
p13
aVand analyzed that world primarily in terms
p14
aVof how much it would benefit them
p15
aVto people who confront a very complex world,
p16
aVand it's a world where we've had to develop
p17
aVnew mental habits, new habits of mind.
p18
aVAnd these include things like
p19
aVclothing that concrete world with classification,
p20
aVintroducing abstractions that we try to make
p21
aVlogically consistent,
p22
aVand also taking the hypothetical seriously,
p23
aVthat is, wondering about what might have been
p24
aVrather than what is.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention
p27
aVthrough massive I.Q. gains over time,
p28
aVand these have been truly massive.
p29
aVThat is, we don't just get a few more questions right
p30
aVon I.Q. tests.
p31
aVWe get far more questions right on I.Q. tests
p32
aVthan each succeeding generation
p33
aVback to the time that they were invented.
p34
aVIndeed, if you score the people a century ago
p35
aVagainst modern norms,
p36
aVthey would have an average I.Q. of 70.
p37
aVIf you score us against their norms,
p38
aVwe would have an average I.Q. of 130.
p39
aVNow this has raised all sorts of questions.
p40
aVWere our immediate ancestors
p41
aVon the verge of mental retardation?
p42
aVBecause 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.
p43
aVOr are we on the verge of all being gifted?
p44
aVBecause 130 is the cutting line for giftedness.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative
p47
aVthat's much more illuminating than either of those,
p48
aVand to put this into perspective,
p49
aVlet's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth
p50
aVand found a ruined civilization.
p51
aVAnd this Martian was an archaeologist,
p52
aVand they found scores, target scores,
p53
aVthat people had used for shooting.
p54
aVAnd first they looked at 1865,
p55
aVand they found that in a minute,
p56
aVpeople had only put one bullet in the bullseye.
p57
aVAnd then they found, in 1898,
p58
aVthat they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.
p59
aVAnd then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.
p60
aVAnd initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.
p61
aVThey would say, look, these tests were designed
p62
aVto find out how much people were steady of hand,
p63
aVhow keen their eyesight was,
p64
aVwhether they had control of their weapon.
p65
aVHow could these performances have escalated
p66
aVto this enormous degree?
p67
aVWell we now know, of course, the answer.
p68
aVIf that Martian looked at battlefields,
p69
aVthey would find that people had only muskets
p70
aVat the time of the Civil War
p71
aVand that they had repeating rifles
p72
aVat the time of the Spanish-American War,
p73
aVand then they had machine guns
p74
aVby the time of World War I.
p75
aVAnd, in other words, it was the equipment
p76
aVthat was in the hands of the average soldier
p77
aVthat was responsible, not greater keenness of eye
p78
aVor steadiness of hand.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow what we have to imagine is the mental artillery
p81
aVthat we have picked up over those hundred years,
p82
aVand I think again that another thinker will help us here,
p83
aVand that's Luria.
p84
aVLuria looked at people
p85
aVjust before they entered the scientific age,
p86
aVand he found that these people
p87
aVwere resistant to classifying the concrete world.
p88
aVThey wanted to break it up
p89
aVinto little bits that they could use.
p90
aVHe found that they were resistant
p91
aVto deducing the hypothetical,
p92
aVto speculating about what might be,
p93
aVand he found finally that they didn't deal well
p94
aVwith abstractions or using logic on those abstractions.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.
p97
aVHe talked to the head man of a person
p98
aVin rural Russia.
p99
aVThey'd only had, as people had in 1900,
p100
aVabout four years of schooling.
p101
aVAnd he asked that particular person,
p102
aVwhat do crows and fish have in common?
p103
aVAnd the fellow said, "Absolutely nothing.
p104
aVYou know, I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow.
p105
aVA crow can peck at a fish.
p106
aVA fish can't do anything to a crow."
p107
aVAnd Luria said, "But aren't they both animals?"
p108
aVAnd he said, "Of course not.
p109
aVOne's a fish.
p110
aVThe other is a bird."
p111
aVAnd he was interested, effectively,
p112
aVin what he could do with those concrete objects.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd then Luria went to another person,
p115
aVand he said to them,
p116
aV"There are no camels in Germany.
p117
aVHamburg is a city in Germany.
p118
aVAre there camels in Hamburg?"
p119
aVAnd the fellow said,
p120
aV"Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."
p121
aVAnd Luria said, "But what do my words imply?"
p122
aVAnd he said, "Well, maybe it's a small village,
p123
aVand there's no room for camels."
p124
aVIn other words, he was unwilling to treat this
p125
aVas anything but a concrete problem,
p126
aVand he was used to camels being in villages,
p127
aVand he was quite unable to use the hypothetical,
p128
aVto ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany.
p129
aa(lp130
VA third interview was conducted
p131
aVwith someone about the North Pole.
p132
aVAnd Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow.
p133
aVWherever there is always snow, the bears are white.
p134
aVWhat color are the bears at the North Pole?"
p135
aVAnd the response was, "Such a thing
p136
aVis to be settled by testimony.
p137
aVIf a wise person came from the North Pole
p138
aVand told me the bears were white,
p139
aVI might believe him,
p140
aVbut every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."
p141
aVNow you see again, this person has rejected
p142
aVgoing beyond the concrete world
p143
aVand analyzing it through everyday experience,
p144
aVand it was important to that person
p145
aVwhat color bears were \u2014
p146
aVthat is, they had to hunt bears.
p147
aVThey weren't willing to engage in this.
p148
aVOne of them said to Luria,
p149
aV"How can we solve things that aren't real problems?
p150
aVNone of these problems are real.
p151
aVHow can we address them?"
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, these three categories \u2014
p154
aVclassification,
p155
aVusing logic on abstractions,
p156
aVtaking the hypothetical seriously \u2014
p157
aVhow much difference do they make in the real world
p158
aVbeyond the testing room?
p159
aVAnd let me give you a few illustrations.
p160
aa(lp161
VFirst, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.
p162
aVThat is, we've gone from four to eight years of education
p163
aVto 12 years of formal education,
p164
aVand 52 percent of Americans
p165
aVhave actually experienced some type of tertiary education.
p166
aVNow, not only do we have much more education,
p167
aVand much of that education is scientific,
p168
aVand you can't do science without classifying the world.
p169
aVYou can't do science without proposing hypotheses.
p170
aVYou can't do science without making it logically consistent.
p171
aVAnd even down in grade school, things have changed.
p172
aVIn 1910, they looked at the examinations
p173
aVthat the state of Ohio gave to 14-year-olds,
p174
aVand they found that they were all
p175
aVfor socially valued concrete information.
p176
aVThey were things like,
p177
aVwhat are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states
p178
aVthat existed at that time?
p179
aVWhen they looked at the exams
p180
aVthat the state of Ohio gave in 1990,
p181
aVthey were all about abstractions.
p182
aVThey were things like,
p183
aVwhy is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?
p184
aVAnd you were supposed to think, well,
p185
aVthe state legislature was rural-controlled,
p186
aVand they hated the big city,
p187
aVso rather than putting the capital in a big city,
p188
aVthey put it in a county seat.
p189
aVThey put it in Albany rather than New York.
p190
aVThey put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia.
p191
aVAnd so forth.
p192
aVSo the tenor of education has changed.
p193
aVWe are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously,
p194
aVto use abstractions, and to link them logically.
p195
aa(lp196
VWhat about employment?
p197
aVWell, in 1900, three percent of Americans
p198
aVpracticed professions that were cognitively demanding.
p199
aVOnly three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.
p200
aVToday, 35 percent of Americans
p201
aVpractice cognitively demanding professions,
p202
aVnot only to the professions proper like lawyer
p203
aVor doctor or scientist or lecturer,
p204
aVbut many, many sub-professions
p205
aVhaving to do with being a technician,
p206
aVa computer programmer.
p207
aVA whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.
p208
aVAnd we can only meet the terms of employment
p209
aVin the modern world by being cognitively
p210
aVfar more flexible.
p211
aVAnd it's not just that we have many more people
p212
aVin cognitively demanding professions.
p213
aVThe professions have been upgraded.
p214
aVCompare the doctor in 1900,
p215
aVwho really had only a few tricks up his sleeve,
p216
aVwith the modern general practitioner or specialist,
p217
aVwith years of scientific training.
p218
aVCompare the banker in 1900,
p219
aVwho really just needed a good accountant
p220
aVand to know who was trustworthy in the local community
p221
aVfor paying back their mortgage.
p222
aVWell, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees
p223
aVmay have been morally remiss,
p224
aVbut they were cognitively very agile.
p225
aVThey went far beyond that 1900 banker.
p226
aVThey had to look at computer projections
p227
aVfor the housing market.
p228
aVThey had to get complicated CDO-squared
p229
aVin order to bundle debt together
p230
aVand make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset.
p231
aVThey had to prepare a case to get rating agencies
p232
aVto give it a AAA,
p233
aVthough in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.
p234
aVAnd they also, of course, had to get people
p235
aVto accept these so-called assets
p236
aVand pay money for them
p237
aVeven though they were highly vulnerable.
p238
aVOr take a farmer today.
p239
aVI take the farm manager of today as very different
p240
aVfrom the farmer of 1900.
p241
aVSo it hasn't just been the spread
p242
aVof cognitively demanding professions.
p243
aVIt's also been the upgrading of tasks
p244
aVlike lawyer and doctor and what have you
p245
aVthat have made demands on our cognitive faculties.
p246
aa(lp247
VBut I've talked about education and employment.
p248
aVSome of the habits of mind that we have developed
p249
aVover the 20th century
p250
aVhave paid off in unexpected areas.
p251
aVI'm primarily a moral philosopher.
p252
aVI merely have a holiday in psychology,
p253
aVand what interests me in general is moral debate.
p254
aVNow over the last century,
p255
aVin developed nations like America,
p256
aVmoral debate has escalated
p257
aVbecause we take the hypothetical seriously,
p258
aVand we also take universals seriously
p259
aVand look for logical connections.
p260
aVWhen I came home in 1955 from university
p261
aVat the time of Martin Luther King,
p262
aVa lot of people came home at that time
p263
aVand started having arguments with their parents and grandparents.
p264
aVMy father was born in 1885,
p265
aVand he was mildly racially biased.
p266
aVAs an Irishman, he hated the English so much
p267
aVhe didn't have much emotion for anyone else.
p268
aV(Laughter)
p269
aVBut he did have a sense that black people were inferior.
p270
aVAnd when we said to our parents and grandparents,
p271
aV"How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black?"
p272
aVthey said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.
p273
aVWho have you ever known who woke up in the morning \u2014
p274
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p275
aVthat turned black?
p276
aa(lp277
VIn other words, they were fixed in the concrete
p278
aVmores and attitudes they had inherited.
p279
aVThey would not take the hypothetical seriously,
p280
aVand without the hypothetical,
p281
aVit's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.
p282
aVYou have to say, imagine you were
p283
aVin Iran, and imagine that your relatives
p284
aVall suffered from collateral damage
p285
aVeven though they had done no wrong.
p286
aVHow would you feel about that?
p287
aVAnd if someone of the older generation says,
p288
aVwell, our government takes care of us,
p289
aVand it's up to their government to take care of them,
p290
aVthey're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.
p291
aVOr take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped,
p292
aVand he feels he's honor-bound to kill her.
p293
aVWell, he's treating his mores
p294
aVas if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited,
p295
aVand they're unmovable in any way by logic.
p296
aVThey're just inherited mores.
p297
aVToday we would say something like,
p298
aVwell, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.
p299
aVWould you deserve to be killed?
p300
aVAnd he would say, well that's not in the Koran.
p301
aVThat's not one of the principles I've got.
p302
aVWell you, today, universalize your principles.
p303
aVYou state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.
p304
aVIf you have a principle such as,
p305
aVpeople shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something,
p306
aVthen to exclude black people
p307
aVyou've got to make exceptions, don't you?
p308
aVYou have to say, well, blackness of skin,
p309
aVyou couldn't suffer just for that.
p310
aVIt must be that blacks are somehow tainted.
p311
aVAnd then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, can't we,
p312
aVand say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted
p313
aVwhen St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black.
p314
aVAnd you can get moral argument off the ground, then,
p315
aVbecause you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.
p316
aVYou're treating them as universals,
p317
aVto be rendered consistent by logic.
p318
aa(lp319
VNow how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests?
p320
aVThat's what initially got me going on cognitive history.
p321
aVIf you look at the I.Q. test,
p322
aVyou find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.
p323
aVThe similarities subtest of the Wechsler
p324
aVis about classification,
p325
aVand we have made enormous gains
p326
aVon that classification subtest.
p327
aVThere are other parts of the I.Q. test battery
p328
aVthat are about using logic on abstractions.
p329
aVSome of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices,
p330
aVand it's all about analogies.
p331
aVAnd in 1900, people could do simple analogies.
p332
aVThat is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.
p333
aVWhat are dogs like?
p334
aVThey would say wolves.
p335
aVBut by 1960, people could attack Raven's
p336
aVon a much more sophisticated level.
p337
aVIf you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle,
p338
aVwhat follows two circles?
p339
aVThey could say a semicircle.
p340
aVJust as a triangle is half of a square,
p341
aVa semicircle is half of a circle.
p342
aVBy 2010, college graduates, if you said
p343
aVtwo circles followed by a semicircle,
p344
aVtwo sixteens followed by what,
p345
aVthey would say eight, because eight is half of 16.
p346
aVThat is, they had moved so far from the concrete world
p347
aVthat they could even ignore
p348
aVthe appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question.
p349
aa(lp350
VNow, I should say one thing that's very disheartening.
p351
aVWe haven't made progress on all fronts.
p352
aVOne of the ways in which we would like to deal
p353
aVwith the sophistication of the modern world
p354
aVis through politics,
p355
aVand sadly you can have humane moral principles,
p356
aVyou can classify, you can use logic on abstractions,
p357
aVand if you're ignorant of history and of other countries,
p358
aVyou can't do politics.
p359
aVWe've noticed, in a trend among young Americans,
p360
aVthat they read less history and less literature
p361
aVand less material about foreign lands,
p362
aVand they're essentially ahistorical.
p363
aVThey live in the bubble of the present.
p364
aVThey don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.
p365
aVThey don't know who was an ally of America in World War II.
p366
aVThink how different America would be
p367
aVif every American knew that this is the fifth time
p368
aVWestern armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order,
p369
aVand if they had some idea of exactly what had happened
p370
aVon those four previous occasions.
p371
aV(Laughter)
p372
aVAnd that is, they had barely left,
p373
aVand there wasn't a trace in the sand.
p374
aVOr imagine how different things would be
p375
aVif most Americans knew that we had been lied
p376
aVinto four of our last six wars.
p377
aVYou know, the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine,
p378
aVthe Lusitania was not an innocent vessel
p379
aVbut was loaded with munitions,
p380
aVthe North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet,
p381
aVand, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda
p382
aVand had nothing to do with it,
p383
aVand yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people
p384
aVthat they were brothers in arms,
p385
aVwhen he would hang one from the nearest lamppost.
p386
aa(lp387
VBut I don't want to end on a pessimistic note.
p388
aVThe 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves
p389
aVin ordinary people that we have now realized,
p390
aVand the aristocracy was convinced
p391
aVthat the average person couldn't make it,
p392
aVthat they could never share their mindset
p393
aVor their cognitive abilities.
p394
aVLord Curzon once said
p395
aVhe saw people bathing in the North Sea,
p396
aVand he said, "Why did no one tell me
p397
aVwhat white bodies the lower orders have?"
p398
aVAs if they were a reptile.
p399
aVWell, Dickens was right and he was wrong. [Correction: Rudyard Kipling]
p400
aV[Kipling] said, "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady
p401
aVare sisters underneath the skin."

VI'd like to apologize, first of all, to all of you
p5
aVbecause I have no form
p6
aVof PowerPoint presentation.
p7
aVSo what I'm going to do
p8
aVis, every now and again, I will make this gesture,
p9
aVand in a moment of PowerPoint democracy,
p10
aVyou can imagine what you'd like to see.
p11
aa(lp12
VI do a radio show.
p13
aVThe radio show is called "The Infinite Monkey Cage."
p14
aVIt's about science, it's about rationalism.
p15
aVSo therefore, we get a lot of complaints
p16
aVevery single week \u2014
p17
aVcomplaints including one we get very often,
p18
aVwhich is to say the very title, "Infinite Monkey Cage,"
p19
aVcelebrates the idea of vivisection.
p20
aVWe have made it quite clear to these people
p21
aVthat an infinite monkey cage is roomy.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VWe also had someone else who said,
p26
aV"'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous.
p27
aVAn infinite number of monkeys
p28
aVcould never write the works of Shakespeare.
p29
aVWe know this because they did an experiment."
p30
aVYes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week,
p31
aVand after a week, they only used it as a bathroom.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo the main element though, the main complaint we get \u2014
p36
aVand one that I find most worrying \u2014
p37
aVis that people say, "Oh, why do you insist
p38
aVon ruining the magic?
p39
aVYou bring in science, and it ruins the magic."
p40
aVNow I'm an arts graduate;
p41
aVI love myth and magic
p42
aVand existentialism and self-loathing.
p43
aVThat's what I do.
p44
aVBut I also don't understand
p45
aVhow it does ruin the magic.
p46
aVAll of the magic, I think,
p47
aVthat may well be taken away by science
p48
aVis then replaced by something as wonderful.
p49
aa(lp50
VAstrology, for instance:
p51
aVlike many rationalists, I'm a Pisces.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVNow astrology \u2014
p54
aVwe remove the banal idea
p55
aVthat your life could be predicted;
p56
aVthat you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky man
p57
aVwho's wearing a hat.
p58
aVThat is gone.
p59
aVBut if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can.
p60
aVWe can see predictions of galaxies forming,
p61
aVof galaxies colliding into each other, of new solar systems.
p62
aVThis is a wonderful thing.
p63
aVIf the Sun could one day \u2014 and indeed the Earth, in fact \u2014
p64
aVif the Earth could read its own astrological, astronomical chart,
p65
aVone day it would say,
p66
aV"Not a good day for making plans.
p67
aVYou'll been engulfed by a red giant."
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd that to me as well,
p70
aVthat if you think I'm worried about losing worlds,
p71
aVwell Many Worlds theory \u2014
p72
aVone of the most beautiful, fascinating,
p73
aVsometimes terrifying ideas
p74
aVfrom the quantum interpretation \u2014
p75
aVis a wonderful thing.
p76
aVThat every person here, every decision that you've made today,
p77
aVevery decision you've made in your life,
p78
aVyou've not really made that decision,
p79
aVbut in fact, every single permutation of those decisions
p80
aVis made, each one going off into a new universe.
p81
aVThat is a wonderful idea.
p82
aVIf you ever think that your life is rubbish,
p83
aValways remember
p84
aVthere's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVIf you ever think, "Ah, I want to end it all,"
p87
aVdon't end it all.
p88
aVRemember that in the majority of universes,
p89
aVyou don't even exist in the first place.
p90
aVThis to me, in its own strange way,
p91
aVis very, very comforting.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow reincarnation, that's another thing gone \u2014 the afterlife.
p94
aVBut it's not gone.
p95
aVScience actually says
p96
aVwe will live forever.
p97
aVWell, there is one proviso.
p98
aVWe won't actually live forever. You won't live forever.
p99
aVYour consciousness, the you-ness of you, the me-ness of me \u2014
p100
aVthat gets this one go.
p101
aVBut every single thing that makes us,
p102
aVevery atom in us,
p103
aVhas already created a myriad of different things
p104
aVand will go on to create a myriad of new things.
p105
aVWe have been mountains
p106
aVand apples and pulsars
p107
aVand other people's knees.
p108
aVWho knows, maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee.
p109
aVThat is a good thing.
p110
aVUnlike the occupants of the universe,
p111
aVthe universe itself is not wasteful.
p112
aVWe are all totally recyclable.
p113
aVAnd when we die,
p114
aVwe don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs.
p115
aVThis is a wonderful thing.
p116
aa(lp117
VUnderstanding, to me,
p118
aVdoes not remove the wonder and the joy.
p119
aVFor instance, my wife could turn to me and she may say,
p120
aV"Why do you love me?"
p121
aVAnd I can with all honesty
p122
aVlook her in the eye and say,
p123
aV"Because our pheromones
p124
aVmatched our olfactory receptors."
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aVThough I'll probably also say something
p127
aVabout her hair and personality as well.
p128
aVAnd that is a wonderful thing there.
p129
aVLove does not die because of that thing.
p130
aa(lp131
VPain doesn't go away either.
p132
aVThis is a terrible thing, even though I understand pain.
p133
aVIf someone punches me \u2014
p134
aVand because of my personality,
p135
aVthis is recently a regular occurrence \u2014
p136
aVI understand where the pain comes from.
p137
aVIt is basically momentum to energy
p138
aVwhere the four-vector is constant \u2014 that's what it is.
p139
aVBut at no point can I react and go,
p140
aV"Ha! Is that the best momentum-to-energy fourth vector constant you've got?"
p141
aVNo, I just spit out a tooth.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd that is all of these different things \u2014 the love for my child.
p146
aVI have a son. His name is Archie.
p147
aVI'm very lucky,
p148
aVbecause he's better than all the other children.
p149
aVNow I know you don't think that.
p150
aVYou may well have your own children
p151
aVand think, "Oh no, my child's best."
p152
aVThat's the wonderful thing about evolution \u2014
p153
aVthe predilection to believe
p154
aVthat our child is best.
p155
aVNow in many ways, that's just a survival thing.
p156
aVThe fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes,
p157
aVand therefore we love it.
p158
aVBut we don't notice that bit; we just unconditionally love.
p159
aVThat is a wonderful thing.
p160
aVThough I should say that my son is best
p161
aVand is better than your children.
p162
aVI've done some tests.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd all of these things to me
p165
aVgive such joy and excitement and wonder.
p166
aVEven quantum mechanics can give you an excuse
p167
aVfor bad housework, for instance.
p168
aVPerhaps you've been at home for a week on your own.
p169
aVYou house is in a terrible state.
p170
aVYour partner is about to return.
p171
aVYou think, what should I do?
p172
aVDo nothing.
p173
aVAll you have to do
p174
aVis, when she walks in, using a quantum interpretation,
p175
aVsay, "I'm so sorry.
p176
aVI stopped observing the house for a moment,
p177
aVand when I started observing again,
p178
aVeverything had happened."
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aVThat's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.
p181
aa(lp182
VFor me, it's a very, very important thing.
p183
aVEven on my journey up here \u2014
p184
aVthe joy that I have on my journey up here every single time.
p185
aVIf you actually think, you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful.
p186
aVI'm sitting on a train.
p187
aVEvery time I breathe in,
p188
aVI'm breathing in a million-billion-billion
p189
aVatoms of oxygen.
p190
aVI'm sitting on a chair.
p191
aVEven though I know the chair is made of atoms
p192
aVand therefore actually in many ways empty space,
p193
aVI find it comfortable.
p194
aVI look out the window, and I realize
p195
aVthat every single time we stop and I look out that window,
p196
aVframed in that window,
p197
aVwherever we are,
p198
aVI am observing more life
p199
aVthan there is in the rest of the known universe
p200
aVbeyond the planet Earth.
p201
aVIf you go to the safari parks
p202
aVon Saturn or Jupiter,
p203
aVyou will be disappointed.
p204
aVAnd I realize I'm observing this
p205
aVwith the brain, the human brain,
p206
aVthe most complex thing in the known universe.
p207
aVThat, to me, is an incredible thing.
p208
aVAnd do you know what, that might be enough.
p209
aa(lp210
VSteven Weinberg, the Nobel laureate, once said,
p211
aV"The more the universe seems comprehensible,
p212
aVthe more it seems pointless."
p213
aVNow for some people,
p214
aVthat seems to lead to an idea of nihilism.
p215
aVBut for me, it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing.
p216
aVI'm glad the universe is pointless.
p217
aVIt means if I get to the end of my life,
p218
aVthe universe can't turn to me and go, "What have you been doing, you idiot?
p219
aVThat's not the point."
p220
aVI can make my own purpose.
p221
aVYou can make your own purpose.
p222
aVWe have the individual power
p223
aVto go, "This is what I want to do."
p224
aVAnd in a pointless universe, that, to me, is a wonderful thing.
p225
aVI have chosen to make silly jokes
p226
aVabout quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation.
p227
aVYou, I imagine, can do much better things with your time.
p228
aa(lp229
VThank you very much. Goodbye.

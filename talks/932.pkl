VWhen I saw a piece of technology called Kinect \u2014
p5
aVit was called Natal \u2014 I was inspired,
p6
aVand I thought for a moment,
p7
aVmaybe it's possible
p8
aVto address that one problem of storytelling,
p9
aVto create a character
p10
aVwhich seemed alive,
p11
aVwhich noticed me,
p12
aVthat could look me in the eyes
p13
aVand feel real,
p14
aVand sculpt a story about our relationship.
p15
aVAnd so a year ago,
p16
aVI showed this off
p17
aVat a computer show called E3.
p18
aVAnd this was a piece of technology
p19
aVwith someone called Claire interacting with this boy.
p20
aVAnd there was a huge row online
p21
aVabout, "Hey, this can't be real."
p22
aVAnd so I waited till now
p23
aVto have an actual demo
p24
aVof the real tech.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, this tech incorporates
p27
aVthree big elements.
p28
aVThe first is a Kinect camera,
p29
aVwhich will be out in November,
p30
aVsome incredible AI
p31
aVthat was hidden in the dusty vaults,
p32
aVcollecting dust
p33
aVin Microsoft,
p34
aVplus our quite crude
p35
aVattempts at AI
p36
aVat a company called Lionhead,
p37
aVmixing all those things together
p38
aVjust to get to this one simple idea:
p39
aVto create a real, living
p40
aVbeing in a computer.
p41
aVNow, I'll be honest with you
p42
aVand say that most of it
p43
aVis just a trick,
p44
aVbut it's a trick that actually works.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo why don't we go over and have
p47
aVa look at the demo now.
p48
aVThis is Dimitri.
p49
aVDimitri, just waggle your arm around.
p50
aVNow, you notice he's sitting.
p51
aVThere are no controllers,
p52
aVno keyboards,
p53
aVor mice,
p54
aVor joysticks, or joypads.
p55
aVHe is just going to use
p56
aVhis hand, his body and his voice,
p57
aVjust like humans interact with their hands, body and voice.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo let's move forward.
p60
aVYou're going to meet Milo for the first time.
p61
aVWe had to give him a problem
p62
aVbecause when we first created Milo,
p63
aVwe realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat,
p64
aVto be honest with you.
p65
aVHe was quite a know-it-all,
p66
aVand he wanted to kind of make you laugh.
p67
aVSo the problem we introduced to him was this:
p68
aVhe's just moved house.
p69
aVHe's moved from London
p70
aVto New England, over in America.
p71
aVHis parents are too busy
p72
aVto listen to his problems,
p73
aVand that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.
p74
aVSo here he is
p75
aVwalking through the grass.
p76
aVAnd you're able to interact with his world.
p77
aVThe cool thing is, what we're doing
p78
aVis we're changing the mind
p79
aVof Milo constantly.
p80
aVThat means no two people's Milos
p81
aVcan be the same.
p82
aVYou're actually sculpting a human being here.
p83
aVSo, he's discovering the garden.
p84
aVYou're helping him discover the garden
p85
aVby just pointing out these snails.
p86
aVVery simple at the start.
p87
aVBy the way, if you are a boy, it's snails;
p88
aVif you're a girl, it's butterflies
p89
aVbecause what we found was that girls hate snails.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VSo remember, this is the first time you've met him,
p94
aVand we really want to draw you in and make you more curious.
p95
aVHis face, by the way,
p96
aVis fully AI-driven.
p97
aVWe have complete control over his blush responses,
p98
aVthe diameter of his nostrils
p99
aVto denote stress.
p100
aVWe actually do something called body matching.
p101
aVIf you're leaning forward,
p102
aVhe will try and slightly change
p103
aVthe neuro-linguistic nature of his face,
p104
aVbecause we went out with this strong idea:
p105
aVhow can we make you believe that something's real?
p106
aVNow we've used the hand.
p107
aVThe other thing to use is your body.
p108
aVWhy not just, instead of pushing left and right
p109
aVwith a mouse or with a joypad,
p110
aVwhy not use your body just to lean on the chair \u2014
p111
aVagain, relaxed?
p112
aVYou can lean back,
p113
aVbut the camera will change its perspective
p114
aVdepending on which way you're looking.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo Dimitri's now going to use \u2014
p117
aVhe's used his hand; he's used his body.
p118
aVHe's now going to use the other thing which is essential,
p119
aVand that's his voice.
p120
aVNow, the thing about voice is,
p121
aVour experience with voice recognition
p122
aVis pretty awful, isn't it?
p123
aVIt never works.
p124
aVYou order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.
p125
aVSo we've tackled that problem,
p126
aVand we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second.
p127
aa(lp128
VMilo: I could just squish it.
p129
aa(lp130
VPeter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri?
p131
aa(lp132
VFemale Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important,
p133
aVbut remember, even this choice
p134
aVwill affect how Milo develops.
p135
aVDo you want Milo to squash it?
p136
aVWhen you see the microphone,
p137
aVsay ... (PM: Squash.) ... yes to decide.
p138
aa(lp139
VDimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it.
p140
aa(lp141
VPM: No. That's the wrong thing to do.
p142
aVNow look at his response.
p143
aVHe said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it."
p144
aVWhat we're using there is,
p145
aVwe're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme.
p146
aVIt's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.
p147
aVWe've got a database of words which we recognize.
p148
aVWe pick those words out.
p149
aVWe also reference that
p150
aVwith the tonation database
p151
aVthat we build up of Dimitri's voice,
p152
aVor the user's voice.
p153
aVNow we need to have a bit more engagement,
p154
aVand again, what we can do
p155
aVis we can look at the body.
p156
aVAnd we'll do that in a second.
p157
aa(lp158
VMilo: I wonder how deep it is.
p159
aVDeep.
p160
aa(lp161
VPM: Okay. So what we're going to do now
p162
aVis teach Milo to skim stones.
p163
aVWe're actually teaching him.
p164
aVIt's very, very interesting
p165
aVthat men, more than women,
p166
aVtend to be more competitive here.
p167
aVThey're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws,
p168
aVbut then they want to beat Milo,
p169
aVwhere women,
p170
aVthey're more nurturing about this.
p171
aVOkay, this is skimming stones.
p172
aVHow do you skim stones?
p173
aVYou stand up,
p174
aVand you skim the stone.
p175
aVIt's that simple.
p176
aVJust recognizing your body,
p177
aVrecognizing the body's motions, the tech,
p178
aVunderstanding that you've gone
p179
aVfrom sitting down to standing up.
p180
aVAgain, all of this is done
p181
aVin the way us humans do things,
p182
aVand that's crucially important
p183
aVif we want Milo to appear real.
p184
aa(lp185
VFemale Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.
p186
aVTry hitting the boat.
p187
aa(lp188
VMilo: Ahhh. So close.
p189
aa(lp190
VPM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.
p191
aVNow beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done.
p192
aa(lp193
VMilo: Okay.
p194
aa(lp195
VPM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents,
p196
aVgiving us time to be alone
p197
aVand to help him out.
p198
aVBasically \u2014 the bit that we missed at the start \u2014
p199
aVhis parents had asked him to clean up his room.
p200
aVAnd we're going to help him with this now.
p201
aVBut this is going to be an introduction,
p202
aVand this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.
p203
aVWe're trying to introduce you
p204
aVto what I believe is the most wonderful part,
p205
aVyou being able to talk
p206
aVin your natural voice to Milo.
p207
aVNow, to do that, we needed a set up,
p208
aVlike a magician's trick.
p209
aVAnd what we did was,
p210
aVwe needed to give Milo this big problem.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo as Dimitri
p213
aVstarts tidying up,
p214
aVyou can overhear a conversation
p215
aVthat Milo's having with his parents.
p216
aa(lp217
VMilo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!)
p218
aa(lp219
VMilo's Mom: That carpet is brand new.
p220
aa(lp221
VPM: So he's just spilled
p222
aVa plate of sausages on the floor,
p223
aVon the brand-new carpet.
p224
aVWe've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children.
p225
aVNow's a chance for Dimitri
p226
aVto kind of reassure and calm Milo down.
p227
aVIt's all been too much for him.
p228
aVHe's just moved house. He's got no friends.
p229
aVNow is the time
p230
aVwhen we open that portal
p231
aVand allow you to talk to Milo.
p232
aa(lp233
VFemale Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging
p234
aVto cheer Milo up.
p235
aa(lp236
VDimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like.
p237
aVThey're always getting stressed.
p238
aa(lp239
VMilo: What do they want to come here for anyway?
p240
aVWe don't know anyone.
p241
aa(lp242
VDimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.
p243
aVYou're going to meet loads of cool, new friends.
p244
aVMilo: I just really miss my old house, that's all.
p245
aa(lp246
VDimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo.
p247
aVYou've got a cool garden to play in and a pond.
p248
aa(lp249
VMilo: It was good skimming stones.
p250
aVThis looks nice.
p251
aVYou cleaned up my room.
p252
aVThanks.
p253
aa(lp254
VPM: So after three-quarters of an hour,
p255
aVhe recognizes you.
p256
aVAnd I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen,
p257
aVthat is a truly wonderful moment.
p258
aVAnd we're ready now
p259
aVto tell a story about his childhood and his life,
p260
aVand it goes on,
p261
aVand he has, you know, many adventures.
p262
aVSome of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side.
p263
aVSome of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging \u2014
p264
aVhe's got to go to school.
p265
aa(lp266
VThe cool thing is
p267
aVthat we're doing as well:
p268
aVas you interact with him,
p269
aVyou're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.
p270
aVHis mind is based in a cloud.
p271
aVThat means Milo's mind,
p272
aVas millions of people use it,
p273
aVwill get smarter and cleverer.
p274
aVHe'll recognize more objects
p275
aVand thus understand more words.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut for me,
p278
aVthis is a wonderful opportunity
p279
aVwhere technology, at last, can be connected with,
p280
aVwhere I am no longer restrained
p281
aVby the finger I hold in my hand \u2014
p282
aVas far as a computer game's concerned \u2014
p283
aVor by the blandness of not being noticed
p284
aVif you're watching a film or a book.
p285
aVAnd I love those revolutions,
p286
aVand I love the future that Milo brings.
p287
aa(lp288
VThank you very much indeed.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Applause)

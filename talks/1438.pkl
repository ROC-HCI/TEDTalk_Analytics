VFour years ago today, exactly, actually,
p5
aVI started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.
p6
aVLast September of 2011, I started an online magazine
p7
aVfor teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.
p8
aVMy name's Tavi Gevinson, and
p9
aVthe title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out,"
p10
aVand the MS Paint quality of my slides
p11
aVwas a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme,
p12
aVand has nothing to do with my inability
p13
aVto use PowerPoint. (Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.
p16
aVI am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about
p17
aVwhat makes a strong female character,
p18
aVand, you know, movies and TV shows,
p19
aVthese things have influence. My own website.
p20
aVSo I think the question of what makes a strong female
p21
aVcharacter often goes misinterpreted,
p22
aVand instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen
p23
aVwho maybe have one quality that's played up a lot,
p24
aVlike a Catwoman type,
p25
aVor she plays her sexuality up a lot,
p26
aVand it's seen as power.
p27
aVBut they're not strong characters who happen to be female.
p28
aVThey're completely flat,
p29
aVand they're basically cardboard characters.
p30
aVThe problem with this is that then
p31
aVpeople expect women to be that easy to understand,
p32
aVand women are mad at themselves
p33
aVfor not being that simple,
p34
aVwhen, in actuality, women are complicated,
p35
aVwomen are multifaceted \u2014 not because women are crazy,
p36
aVbut because people are crazy,
p37
aVand women happen to be people. (Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VSo the flaws are the key.
p40
aVI'm not the first person to say this.
p41
aVWhat makes a strong female character
p42
aVis a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws,
p43
aVwho is maybe not immediately likable,
p44
aVbut eventually relatable.
p45
aa(lp46
VI don't like to acknowledge a problem
p47
aVwithout also acknowledging those who work to fix it,
p48
aVso just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men,"
p49
aVmovies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters
p50
aVor protagonists are complex, multifaceted.
p51
aVLena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO
p52
aVthat premiers next month, "Girls,"
p53
aVshe said she wanted to start it because she felt that
p54
aVevery woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions,
p55
aVand that feels accurate for all people,
p56
aVbut you don't see women represented like that as much.
p57
aVCongrats, guys. (Laughs)
p58
aa(lp59
VBut I don't feel that \u2014 I still feel that there are some types
p60
aVof women who are not represented that way,
p61
aVand one group that we'll focus on today are teens,
p62
aVbecause I think teenagers are especially contradictory
p63
aVand still figuring it out,
p64
aVand in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks"
p65
aVand "My So-Called Life," and their characters,
p66
aVLindsay Weir and Angela Chase,
p67
aVI mean, the whole premise of the shows
p68
aVwere just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,
p69
aVbut those shows only lasted a season each,
p70
aVand I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo this is a scientific diagram of my brain \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p73
aVaround the time when I was,
p74
aVwhen I started watching those TV shows.
p75
aVI was ending middle school, starting high school \u2014
p76
aVI'm a sophomore now \u2014
p77
aVand I was trying to reconcile
p78
aVall of these differences that you're told you can't be
p79
aVwhen you're growing up as a girl.
p80
aVYou can't be smart and pretty.
p81
aVYou can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.
p82
aVYou can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake
p83
aVof what other people, usually men, will think of you.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo I was trying to figure all that out,
p86
aVand I felt a little confused,
p87
aVand I said so on my blog,
p88
aVand I said that I wanted to start
p89
aVa website for teenage girls
p90
aVthat was not this kind of one-dimensional
p91
aVstrong character empowerment thing
p92
aVbecause I think one thing that can be very alienating
p93
aVabout a misconception of feminism is that
p94
aVgirls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to
p95
aVbeing perfectly consistent in your beliefs,
p96
aVnever being insecure, never having doubts,
p97
aVhaving all of the answers. And this is not true,
p98
aVand, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling
p99
aVbecame easier once I understood that feminism
p100
aVwas not a rulebook but a discussion,
p101
aVa conversation, a process,
p102
aVand this is a spread from a zine that I made last year
p103
aVwhen I \u2014 I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit
p104
aVon the illustration front since.
p105
aVBut, yeah.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication
p108
aVfor teenage girls and ask people to submit
p109
aVtheir writing, their photography, whatever,
p110
aVto be a member of our staff.
p111
aVI got about 3,000 emails.
p112
aVMy editorial director and I went through them and
p113
aVput together a staff of people,
p114
aVand we launched last September.
p115
aVAnd this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter,
p116
aVwhere I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers,
p117
aVwe're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to
p118
aVgive girls the answers, and not even give them permission
p119
aVto find the answers themselves,
p120
aVbut hopefully inspire them to understand that
p121
aVthey can give themselves that permission,
p122
aVthey can ask their own questions, find their own answers,
p123
aVall of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it
p124
aVa nice place for all of that to be figured out.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo I'm not saying, "Be like us,"
p127
aVand "We're perfect role models," because we're not,
p128
aVbut we just want to help represent girls
p129
aVin a way that shows those different dimensions.
p130
aVI mean, we have articles called
p131
aV"On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"
p132
aVbut we also have articles like,
p133
aVoops \u2014 I'm figuring it out!
p134
aVHa ha. (Laughter)
p135
aVIf you use that, you can get away with anything.
p136
aVWe also have articles called
p137
aV"How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."
p138
aa(lp139
VSo all of that being said, I still really appreciate
p140
aVthose characters in movies and
p141
aVarticles like that on our site,
p142
aVthat aren't just about being totally powerful,
p143
aVmaybe finding your acceptance with yourself
p144
aVand self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo what I you to take away from my talk,
p147
aVthe lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.
p148
aVLike, that's all you have to do. (Laughter)
p149
aVBecause my favorite thing about her,
p150
aVother than, like, everything, is that
p151
aVshe is very \u2014 has always been
p152
aVunapologetically present on stage,
p153
aVand unapologetic about her flaws
p154
aVand about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings
p155
aVand she makes you listen to them and think about them,
p156
aVand yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.
p157
aVThank you. (Applause)

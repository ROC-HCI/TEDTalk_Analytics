VI want to talk to you about something
p5
aVkind of big.
p6
aVWe'll start here.
p7
aVSixty-five million years ago \u2014
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
Vthe dinosaurs had a bad day.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VA chunk of rock six miles across,
p16
aVmoving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet,
p17
aVslammed into the Earth.
p18
aVIt released its energy all at once,
p19
aVand it was an explosion that was mind-numbing.
p20
aVIf you took every nuclear weapon ever built
p21
aVat the height of the Cold War,
p22
aVlumped them together,
p23
aVand blew them up at the same time,
p24
aVthat would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment.
p25
aVThe dinosaurs had a really bad day.
p26
aVOK?
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.
p29
aVWe all live here in Boulder.
p30
aVIf you look out your window and see Longs Peak \u2014
p31
aVyou're probably familiar with it \u2014
p32
aVnow, scoop up Longs Peak and put it out in space.
p33
aVTake ... Meeker, Mt. Meeker.
p34
aVLump that in there, and put that in space as well.
p35
aVAnd Mt. Everest. And K2.
p36
aVAnd the Indian peaks.
p37
aVThen you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about, OK?
p38
aVWe know it was that big
p39
aVbecause of the impact it had and the crater it left.
p40
aVIt hit in what we now know as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.
p41
aVYou can see here, there's the Yucatan Peninsula,
p42
aVif you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there.
p43
aVHere is how big of a crater was left.
p44
aVIt was huge.
p45
aa(lp46
VTo give you a sense of the scale ... there you go.
p47
aVThe scale here is 50 miles on top, a hundred kilometers on the bottom.
p48
aVThis thing was 300 kilometers across \u2014 200 miles \u2014
p49
aVan enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth
p50
aVthat splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet,
p51
aVthrew up enough dust to block out the sun.
p52
aVIt wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth.
p53
aVNow, not all asteroids are that big.
p54
aa(lp55
VSome of them are smaller.
p56
aVHere is one that came in
p57
aVover the United States in October of 1992.
p58
aVIt came in on a Friday night.
p59
aVWhy is that important?
p60
aVBecause back then, video cameras were just starting to become popular,
p61
aVand parents would bring them to their kids' football games
p62
aVto film their kids playing football.
p63
aVAnd since this came in on a Friday,
p64
aVthey were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up
p65
aVas it came in over West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey
p66
aVuntil it did that
p67
aVto a car in New York.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,
p72
aVbut then again, you can see the rock, which is sitting right here,
p73
aVabout the size of a football,
p74
aVthat hit that car and did that damage.
p75
aVNow, this thing was probably about the size of a school bus
p76
aVwhen it first came in.
p77
aVIt broke up through atmospheric pressure,
p78
aVit crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart
p79
aVand did some damage.
p80
aVNow, you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head,
p81
aVbecause it would do that to it.
p82
aVThat would be bad.
p83
aVBut it won't wipe out, you know, all life on Earth, so that's fine.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut it turns out, you don't need something six miles across
p86
aVto do a lot of damage.
p87
aVThere is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock,
p88
aVand in fact, if any of you have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,
p89
aVthere is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic
p90
aVthat it is actually called "Meteor Crater."
p91
aVTo give you a sense of scale, this is about a mile wide.
p92
aVIf you look up at the top, that's a parking lot,
p93
aVand those are recreational vehicles right there.
p94
aVSo it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep.
p95
aVThe object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across,
p96
aVso roughly the size of Macky Auditorium here.
p97
aVIt came in at speeds that were tremendous,
p98
aVslammed into the ground, blew up,
p99
aVand exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb \u2014
p100
aVa very hefty bomb.
p101
aVThis was 50,000 years ago,
p102
aVso it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope,
p103
aVor something like that out in the desert,
p104
aVbut it probably would not have caused global devastation.
p105
aa(lp106
VIt turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground
p107
aVto do a lot of damage.
p108
aVNow, in 1908, over Siberia, near the Tunguska region \u2014
p109
aVfor those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw "Ghostbusters,"
p110
aVwhen he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift
p111
aVsince the Siberia blast of 1909,
p112
aVwhere he got the date wrong, but that's OK.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VIt was 1908. That's fine. I can live with that.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VAnother rock came into the Earth's atmosphere
p121
aVand this one blew up above the ground,
p122
aVseveral miles up above the surface of the Earth.
p123
aVThe heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it,
p124
aVand then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees
p125
aVfor hundreds of square miles.
p126
aVThis did a huge amount of damage.
p127
aVAnd again, this was a rock probably roughly the size
p128
aVof this auditorium that we're sitting in.
p129
aVIn Meteor Crater, it was made of metal,
p130
aVand metal is much tougher, so it made it to the ground.
p131
aVThe one over Tunguska was probably made of rock,
p132
aVand that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air.
p133
aa(lp134
VEither way, these are tremendous explosions \u2014 20 megatons.
p135
aVNow, when these things blow up,
p136
aVthey're not going to do global ecological damage.
p137
aVThey're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did.
p138
aVThey're just not big enough.
p139
aVBut they will do global economic damage,
p140
aVbecause they don't have to hit, necessarily,
p141
aVto do this kind of damage.
p142
aVThey don't have to do global devastation.
p143
aVIf one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere,
p144
aVit would cause a panic.
p145
aVBut if it came over a city, an important city \u2014
p146
aVnot that any city is more important than others,
p147
aVbut some of them we depend on more on the global economic basis \u2014
p148
aVthat could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization.
p149
aVSo, now that I've scared the crap out of you \u2014
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
Vwhat can we do about this?
p154
aVThis is a potential threat.
p155
aVLet me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer
p156
aVfor 65 million years.
p157
aVThey're very rare.
p158
aVThe smaller ones happen more often,
p159
aVbut probably on the order of a millennium,
p160
aVevery few centuries or every few thousand years.
p161
aVBut it's still something to be aware of.
p162
aVWell, what do we do about them?
p163
aVThe first thing we have to do is find them.
p164
aVThis is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009.
p165
aVIt's right here.
p166
aVBut you can see that it's extremely faint.
p167
aVI don't know if you can see that in the back row.
p168
aVThese are just stars.
p169
aa(lp170
VThis is a rock that was about 30 yards across,
p171
aVso roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska
p172
aVand hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.
p173
aVThese things are faint.
p174
aVThey're hard to see, and the sky is really big.
p175
aVWe have to find these things first.
p176
aVWell, the good news is, we're looking for them.
p177
aVNASA has devoted money to this;
p178
aVthe National Science Foundation and other countries
p179
aVare interested in doing this.
p180
aVWe're building telescopes that are looking for the threat.
p181
aa(lp182
VThat's a great first step. But what's the second step?
p183
aVThe second step is if we see one heading toward us, we have to stop it.
p184
aVWhat do we do?
p185
aVYou've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis.
p186
aVIf you haven't yet, you will.
p187
aVIf you've heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse,
p188
aVyou're going to hear about Apophis,
p189
aVbecause you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks, anyway.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VApophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004.
p194
aVIt's roughly 250 [meters] across, so it's pretty big \u2014
p195
aVbigger than a football stadium.
p196
aVAnd it's going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029.
p197
aVAnd it's going to pass us so close
p198
aVthat it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites.
p199
aVThe Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much
p200
aVthat if it's just right,
p201
aVif it passes through this region of space,
p202
aVthis kidney-bean-shaped region called the keyhole,
p203
aVthe Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later,
p204
aVon April 13 \u2014 which is a Friday, I'll note \u2014 in the year 2036 \u2014
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
Vyou can't plan that kind of stuff \u2014
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VApophis is going to hit us.
p213
aVAnd it's 250 meters across, so it would do unbelievable damage.
p214
aVThe good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole
p215
aVand hitting us next go-around are one in a million, roughly \u2014
p216
aVvery, very low odds.
p217
aVSo I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all.
p218
aVI don't think Apophis is a problem.
p219
aVIn fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise,
p220
aVbecause it woke us up to the dangers of these things.
p221
aVThis thing was discovered just a few years ago
p222
aVand could hit us a few years from now.
p223
aVIt won't, but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids.
p224
aa(lp225
VWe didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes, and now we do,
p226
aVand it turns out that's really important,
p227
aVbecause how do you stop an asteroid like this?
p228
aVWell, let me ask you:
p229
aVWhat happens if you're standing in the road and a car's headed for you?
p230
aVWhat do you do?
p231
aVYou do this. Right? Move, and the car goes past you.
p232
aVBut we can't move the Earth, at least not easily,
p233
aVbut we can move a small asteroid.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd it turns out, we've even done it.
p236
aVIn the year 2005, NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact,
p237
aVwhich slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.
p238
aVComets are very much like asteroids.
p239
aVThe purpose wasn't to push it out of the way;
p240
aVthe purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material
p241
aVand see what was underneath the surface of this comet,
p242
aVwhich we learned quite a bit about.
p243
aVWe did move the comet a little tiny bit \u2014
p244
aVnot very much, but that wasn't the point.
p245
aVHowever, think about this:
p246
aVThis thing is orbiting the Sun at 10, 20 miles per second.
p247
aVWe shot a space probe at it and hit it, OK?
p248
aVImagine how hard that must be, and we did it.
p249
aVThat means we can do it again.
p250
aVIf we see an asteroid that's coming toward us, headed right for us,
p251
aVand we have two years to go?
p252
aVBoom! We hit it.
p253
aVYou know, if you watch the movies \u2014
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
Vyou might think:
p258
aVWhy don't we use a nuclear weapon?
p259
aVWell, you can try that, but the problem is timing.
p260
aVShoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,
p261
aVyou have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance,
p262
aVor else you'll miss it.
p263
aVAnd there are a lot of other problems with that; it's very hard to do.
p264
aVBut just hitting something? That's pretty easy.
p265
aVI think even NASA can do that, and proved that they can.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VThe problem is, if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit,
p270
aVyou measure the orbit,
p271
aVthen you find out, oh yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole,
p272
aVand now it's going to hit us in three years.
p273
aVWell, my opinion is: fine!
p274
aVIt's not hitting us in six months \u2014
p275
aVthat's good.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow we have three years to do something else.
p278
aVAnd you can hit it again.
p279
aVThat's kind of ham-fisted;
p280
aVyou might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever,
p281
aVso you don't do that.
p282
aVAnd this is the part \u2014
p283
aVit's the part I just love.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VAfter the big macho "Grr ... bam! We're gonna hit this thing in the face,"
p288
aVthen we bring in the velvet gloves.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VThere's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts,
p293
aVand they call themselves The B612 Foundation.
p294
aVFor those of you who've read "The Little Prince,"
p295
aVyou understand that reference, I hope \u2014
p296
aVthe little prince lived on an asteroid called B612.
p297
aVThese are smart guys \u2014 men and women \u2014 astronauts, like I said, engineers.
p298
aVRusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this.
p299
aVDan Durda, my friend who made this image,
p300
aVworks here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, on Walnut Street.
p301
aVHe created this image for this.
p302
aVHe's actually one of the astronomers who works for them.
p303
aVIf we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth
p304
aVand we have enough time,
p305
aVwe can hit it to move it into a better orbit.
p306
aa(lp307
VBut then what we do is launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two.
p308
aVIt doesn't have to be huge \u2014 a couple of tons, not that big \u2014
p309
aVand you park it near the asteroid.
p310
aVYou don't land on it, because these things are tumbling end over end.
p311
aVIt's very hard to land on them.
p312
aVInstead you get near it.
p313
aVThe gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe,
p314
aVand the probe has a couple of tons of mass.
p315
aVIt has a little tiny bit of gravity,
p316
aVbut it's enough that it can pull the asteroid,
p317
aVand you have your rocket set up \u2014
p318
aVyou can barely see it here, but there's rocket plumes \u2014
p319
aVand these guys are connected by their own gravity,
p320
aVand if you move the probe very slowly \u2014 very, very gently,
p321
aVyou can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit.
p322
aVYou can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it,
p323
aValthough that's a whole other thing; I won't go into that.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VBut we'd be rich!
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VSo think about this, right?
p332
aVThere are these giant rocks flying out there, and they're hitting us,
p333
aVand they're doing damage to us.
p334
aVBut we've figured out how to do this,
p335
aVand all the pieces are in place to do this.
p336
aVWe have astronomers with telescopes, looking for them.
p337
aVWe have very, very smart people,
p338
aVwho are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem,
p339
aVand we have the technology to do this.
p340
aVThis probe actually can't use chemical rockets.
p341
aVChemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push.
p342
aVThe probe would just shoot away.
p343
aa(lp344
VWe invented something called an ion drive,
p345
aVwhich is a very, very, very low-thrust engine.
p346
aVIt generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand \u2014
p347
aVincredibly light, but it can run for months and years,
p348
aVproviding that very gentle push.
p349
aVIf anybody here is a fan of the original "Star Trek,"
p350
aVthey ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive,
p351
aVand Spock said, "They're very technically sophisticated.
p352
aVThey're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive."
p353
aVYeah, we have an ion drive now.
p354
aVWe don't have the Enterprise, but we've got an ion drive now.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
V(Applause)
p359
aa(lp360
VSpock.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aVSo ...
p364
aVThat's the difference \u2014
p365
aVthat's the difference between us and the dinosaurs.
p366
aVThis happened to them.
p367
aVIt doesn't have to happen to us.
p368
aVThe difference between the dinosaurs and us
p369
aVis that we have a space program
p370
aVand we can vote,
p371
aVand so we can change our future.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VWe have the ability to change our future.
p376
aVSixty-five million years from now,
p377
aVwe don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum.
p378
aVThank you very much.

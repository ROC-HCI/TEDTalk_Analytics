VOf the five senses, vision is the one that I appreciate the most,
p5
aVand it's the one that I can least take for granted.
p6
aVI think this is partially due to my father, who was blind.
p7
aVIt was a fact that he didn't make much of a fuss about, usually.
p8
aVOne time in Nova Scotia, when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun \u2014
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VYeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song,
p13
aVwhich may or may not refer to James Taylor, Warren Beatty
p14
aVor Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.
p15
aVThey handed out these dark plastic viewers
p16
aVthat allowed us to look directly at the sun
p17
aVwithout damaging our eyes.
p18
aVBut Dad got really scared; he didn't want us doing that.
p19
aVHe wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers,
p20
aVso that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged.
p21
aVI thought this was a little strange at the time.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhat I didn't know at the time
p24
aVwas that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight.
p25
aVWhen he and his sister Martha were just very little,
p26
aVtheir mom took them out to see a total eclipse \u2014
p27
aVor actually, a solar eclipse \u2014
p28
aVand not long after that, both of them started losing their eyesight.
p29
aVDecades later, it turned out that the source of their blindness
p30
aVwas most likely some sort of bacterial infection.
p31
aVAs near as we can tell, it had nothing whatsoever to do
p32
aVwith that solar eclipse,
p33
aVbut by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave
p34
aVthinking it was her fault.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946,
p37
aVmarried my mom,
p38
aVand bought a house in Lexington, Massachusetts,
p39
aVwhere the first shots were fired against the British in 1775,
p40
aValthough we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord.
p41
aVHe got a job working for Raytheon designing guidance systems,
p42
aVwhich was part of the Route 128 high-tech axis in those days \u2014
p43
aVso, the equivalent of Silicon Valley in the '70s.
p44
aVDad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy;
p45
aVhe just felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II
p46
aVon account of his handicap,
p47
aValthough they did let him get through
p48
aVthe several-hour-long army physical exam
p49
aVbefore they got to the very last test, which was for vision.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VSo Dad started racking up all of these patents
p54
aVand gaining a reputation as a blind genius, rocket scientist, inventor.
p55
aVBut to us he was just Dad, and our home life was pretty normal.
p56
aVAs a kid, I watched a lot of television
p57
aVand had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology
p58
aVand the space program and a little bit of politics.
p59
aVI played a lot of chess.
p60
aVBut at the age of 14, a friend got me interested in comic books,
p61
aVand I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo, here's my dad:
p64
aVhe's a scientist, he's an engineer and he's a military contractor.
p65
aVSo, he has four kids, right?
p66
aVOne grows up to become a computer scientist,
p67
aVone grows up to join the Navy,
p68
aVone grows up to become an engineer ...
p69
aVAnd then there's me: the comic book artist.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VWhich, incidentally, makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen,
p74
aVbecause I'm a comic book artist, son of an inventor,
p75
aVand he's an inventor, son of a comic book artist.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VRight? It's true.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VThe funny thing is, Dad had a lot of faith in me.
p84
aVHe had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist,
p85
aVeven though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever;
p86
aVeverything he saw was just a blur.
p87
aVNow, this gives a real meaning to the term "blind faith,"
p88
aVwhich doesn't have the same negative connotation for me
p89
aVthat it does for other people.
p90
aVNow, faith in things which cannot be seen, which cannot be proved,
p91
aVis not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much.
p92
aVI tend to like science,
p93
aVwhere what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut there's a middle ground, too \u2014
p96
aVa middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage
p97
aVand his steam-driven computers that were never built.
p98
aVNobody really understood what it was that he had in mind
p99
aVexcept for Ada Lovelace,
p100
aVand he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream.
p101
aVVannevar Bush with his memex \u2014
p102
aVthis idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips \u2014
p103
aVhe had this vision.
p104
aVAnd I think a lot of people in his day
p105
aVprobably thought he was a bit of a kook.
p106
aVAnd, yeah, we can look back in retrospect and say,
p107
aV"Yeah, ha-ha, it's all microfilm \u2014
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VBut that's not the point; he understood the shape of the future.
p112
aVSo did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction.
p113
aVSame thing: he understood the shape of the future,
p114
aVeven though it was something that would only be implemented
p115
aVby people much later.
p116
aVOr Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching.
p117
aVHardly anybody listened to him in his day.
p118
aVOr even the people who actually pulled it off,
p119
aVthe people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston,
p120
aVwho just would sketch out these structures
p121
aVof what would eventually become a worldwide network,
p122
aVand sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers
p123
aVand arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's \u2014
p124
aVon Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts,
p125
aVjust two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred
p126
aVand listening to Gladys Knight & The Pips
p127
aVsinging "Midnight Train to Georgia" \u2014
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
Vin my dad's big easy chair, you know?
p132
aa(lp133
VSo, three types of vision, right?
p134
aVVision based on what one cannot see,
p135
aVthe vision of that unseen and unknowable.
p136
aVThe vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained.
p137
aVAnd this third kind, a vision of something which can be, which may be,
p138
aVbased on knowledge but is, as yet, unproven.
p139
aVNow, we've seen a lot of examples of people
p140
aVwho are pursuing that sort of vision in science,
p141
aVbut I think it's also true in the arts, it's true in politics,
p142
aVit's even true in personal endeavors.
p143
aa(lp144
VWhat it comes down to, really, is four basic principles:
p145
aVlearn from everyone;
p146
aVfollow no one;
p147
aVwatch for patterns;
p148
aVand work like hell.
p149
aVI think these are the four principles that go into this.
p150
aVAnd it's that third one, especially,
p151
aVwhere visions of the future begin to manifest themselves.
p152
aVWhat's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world,
p153
aVis, I think, only one of four different ways
p154
aVthat manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor.
p155
aVIn comics, I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude
p156
aVtowards trying to understand how it works.
p157
aVThen there's another, more classical attitude
p158
aVwhich embraces beauty and craft;
p159
aVanother one which believes in the pure transparency of content;
p160
aVand then another, which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience
p161
aVand honesty and rawness.
p162
aa(lp163
VThese are four very different ways of looking at the world.
p164
aVI even gave them names:
p165
aVthe classicist, the animist, the formalist and iconoclast.
p166
aVInterestingly, they seem to correspond more or less
p167
aVto Jung's four subdivisions of human thought.
p168
aVAnd they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight
p169
aVon left and the right;
p170
aVtradition and revolution on the top and the bottom.
p171
aVAnd if you go on the diagonal, you get content and form,
p172
aVand then beauty and truth.
p173
aVAnd it probably applies just as much to music and movies and fine art,
p174
aVwhich has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all,
p175
aVor, for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme
p176
aVof "Inspired by Nature,"
p177
aVexcept to the extent of the fable of the frog
p178
aVwho gives a ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river
p179
aVbecause the scorpion promises not to sting him,
p180
aVbut the scorpion stings him anyway and they both die,
p181
aVbut not before the frog asks him why, and the scorpion says,
p182
aV"Because it's my nature."
p183
aVIn that sense, yes.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VSo this was my nature.
p188
aVThe thing was, I saw that the route I took
p189
aVto discovering this focus in my work
p190
aVand who I was \u2014
p191
aVI saw it as just this road to discovery.
p192
aVActually, it was just me embracing my nature,
p193
aVwhich means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree, after all.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo what does a "scientific mind" do in the arts?
p196
aVI started making comics, but I also started trying to understand them,
p197
aValmost immediately.
p198
aVOne of the most important things about comics that I discovered
p199
aVwas that comics are a visual medium,
p200
aVbut they try to embrace all of the senses within it.
p201
aVSo, the different elements of comics, like pictures and words,
p202
aVand the different symbols and everything in between
p203
aVthat comics presents,
p204
aVare all funneled through the single conduit, a vision.
p205
aVSo we have things like resemblance,
p206
aVwhere something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted
p207
aVin a couple of different directions:
p208
aVabstracted from resemblance, but still retaining the complete meaning,
p209
aVor abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning
p210
aVtowards the picture plane.
p211
aa(lp212
VPut all these three together, and you have a nice little map
p213
aVof the entire boundary of visual iconography,
p214
aVwhich comics can embrace.
p215
aVAnd if you move to the right you also get language,
p216
aVbecause that's abstracting even further from resemblance,
p217
aVbut still maintaining meaning.
p218
aVVision is called upon to represent sound
p219
aVand to understand the common properties of those two
p220
aVand their common heritage as well;
p221
aValso, to try to represent the texture of sound
p222
aVto capture its essential character through visuals.
p223
aVThere's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics.
p224
aVComics is a kind of call and response,
p225
aVin which the artist gives you something to see within the panels,
p226
aVand then gives you something to imagine between the panels.
p227
aa(lp228
VAlso, another sense which comics' vision represents,
p229
aVand that's time.
p230
aVSequence is a very important aspect of comics.
p231
aVComics presents a kind of temporal map.
p232
aVAnd this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics,
p233
aVbut I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes
p234
aVother sorts of forms,
p235
aVand I found some in history.
p236
aVYou can see this same principle operating
p237
aVin these ancient versions of the same idea.
p238
aVWhat's happening is,
p239
aVan art form is colliding with a given technology,
p240
aVwhether it's paint on stone,
p241
aVlike the Tomb of Menna the Scribe in ancient Egypt,
p242
aVor a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column,
p243
aVor a 200-foot-long embroidery,
p244
aVor painted deerskin and tree bark
p245
aVrunning across 88 accordion-folded pages.
p246
aa(lp247
VWhat's interesting is, once you hit "print" \u2014
p248
aVand this is from 1450, by the way \u2014
p249
aVall of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves:
p250
aVrectilinear panel arrangements,
p251
aVsimple line drawings without tone,
p252
aVand a left-to-right reading sequence.
p253
aVAnd within 100 years, you already start to see word balloons and captions,
p254
aVand it's really just a hop, skip and a jump from here to here.
p255
aVSo I wrote a book about this in '93, but as I was finishing the book,
p256
aVI had to do a little bit of typesetting,
p257
aVand I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it,
p258
aVso I bought a computer.
p259
aVAnd it was just a little thing \u2014
p260
aVit wasn't good for much except text entry \u2014
p261
aVbut my father had told me about Moore's law back in the '70s,
p262
aVand I knew what was coming.
p263
aVAnd so, I kept my eyes peeled
p264
aVto see if the sort of changes that happened
p265
aVwhen we went from pre-print comics to print comics
p266
aVwould happen when we went beyond, to post-print comics.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, one of the first things proposed
p269
aVwas that we could mix the visuals of comics
p270
aVwith the sound, motion and interactivity of the CD-ROMs
p271
aVbeing made in those days.
p272
aVThis was even before the Web.
p273
aVAnd one of the first things they did was,
p274
aVthey tried to take the comics page as is
p275
aVand transplant it to monitors,
p276
aVwhich was a classic McLuhanesque mistake
p277
aVof appropriating the shape of the previous technology
p278
aVas the content of the new technology.
p279
aVAnd so, what they would do is have these comic pages
p280
aVthat resemble print comics pages,
p281
aVand they would introduce all this sound and motion.
p282
aVThe problem was that if you go with this basic idea
p283
aVthat space equals time in comics,
p284
aVwhat happens is that when you introduce sound and motion,
p285
aVwhich are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time,
p286
aVthey break with that continuity of presentation.
p287
aa(lp288
VInteractivity was another thing.
p289
aVThere were hypertext comics, but the thing about hypertext
p290
aVis that everything in hypertext is either here, not here,
p291
aVor connected to here;
p292
aVit's profoundly nonspatial.
p293
aVThe distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny
p294
aVto Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to "Plan 9" to nine lives:
p295
aVit's all the same.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VBut in comics,
p300
aVevery aspect of the work, every element of the work,
p301
aVhas a spatial relationship to every other element at all times.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo the question was:
p304
aVWas there any way to preserve that spatial relationship
p305
aVwhile still taking advantage of all of the things
p306
aVthat digital had to offer us?
p307
aVAnd I found my personal answer for this
p308
aVin those ancient comics that I was showing you.
p309
aVEach of them has a single unbroken reading line,
p310
aVwhether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column
p311
aVor just straight left to right,
p312
aVor even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages,
p313
aVthe same thing is happening;
p314
aVthat is, that the basic idea that as you move through space
p315
aVyou move through time,
p316
aVis being carried out without any compromise,
p317
aVbut there were compromises when print hit.
p318
aVAdjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments,
p319
aVso the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again
p320
aVand again and again.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd I thought, OK, well, if that's true,
p323
aVis there any way, when we go beyond today's print,
p324
aVto somehow bring that back?
p325
aVNow, the monitor is just as limited as the page, technically, right?
p326
aVIt's a different shape, but other than that,
p327
aVit's the same basic limitation.
p328
aVBut that's only if you look at the monitor as a page,
p329
aVbut not if you look at the monitor as a window.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd that's what I propose,
p332
aVthat perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas,
p333
aValong the X axis and the Y axis
p334
aVand staircases.
p335
aVWe could do circular narratives that were literally circular.
p336
aVWe could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn.
p337
aVParallel narratives could be literally parallel.
p338
aVX, Y and also Z.
p339
aVSo I had all these notions.
p340
aVThis was back in the late '90s,
p341
aVand other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy,
p342
aVbut a lot of people then went on and actually did it.
p343
aVI'm going to show you a couple now.
p344
aa(lp345
VThis was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jasen Lex.
p346
aVAnd notice what's going on here.
p347
aVWhat I'm searching for is a durable mutation \u2014
p348
aVthat's what all of us are searching for.
p349
aVAs media head into this new era,
p350
aVwe are looking for mutations that are durable,
p351
aVthat have some sort of staying power.
p352
aVNow, we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium,
p353
aVand we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end.
p354
aVThat's that entire comic you just saw, up on the screen right now.
p355
aVBut even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time,
p356
aVthat's just where the technology is right now.
p357
aVAs the technology evolves,
p358
aVas you get full immersive displays and whatnot,
p359
aVthis sort of thing will only grow; it will adapt.
p360
aVIt will adapt to its environment; it's a durable mutation.
p361
aa(lp362
VHere's another one.
p363
aVThis is by Drew Weing; this is called
p364
aV"'Pup' Ponders the Heat Death of the Universe."
p365
aVSee what's going on here
p366
aVas we draw these stories on an infinite canvas
p367
aVis you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.
p368
aVWe'll go by this a little quickly. You get the idea.
p369
aVI just want to get to the last panel.
p370
aa(lp371
V[Cat 1: Pup! Earth to Pup! Cat 2: Come play baseball with us!]
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
V[Pup: Did either of you realize
p376
aVthat eventually the universe will be nothing but a thin, cold gas
p377
aVspread across infinite, lonely space?]
p378
aa(lp379
V[Cat 1: Oh ... Cat 2: We'd better hurry, then!]
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VJust one more.
p384
aVTalk about your infinite canvas.
p385
aVIt's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey, in Britain.
p386
aa(lp387
VWhy is this important?
p388
aVI think this is important because media \u2014
p389
aVall media \u2014
p390
aVprovide us a window back into our world.
p391
aVNow, it could be that motion pictures and eventually, virtual reality,
p392
aVor something equivalent to it, some sort of immersive display,
p393
aVis going to provide us with our most efficient escape
p394
aVfrom the world that we're in.
p395
aVThat's why most people turn to storytelling, to escape.
p396
aVBut media provides us with a window back into the world we live in.
p397
aVAnd when media evolve
p398
aVso that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique \u2014
p399
aVbecause what you're looking at is comics cubed,
p400
aVyou're looking at comics that are more comics-like
p401
aVthan they've ever been before \u2014
p402
aVwhen that happens, you provide people with multiple ways
p403
aVof reentering the world through different windows.
p404
aVAnd when you do that, it allows them to triangulate the world they live in
p405
aVand see its shape.
p406
aVThat's why I think this is important.
p407
aVOne of many reasons, but I've got to go now.
p408
aVThank you for having me.

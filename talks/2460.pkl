VIn 1962 at Rice University,
p5
aVJFK told the country about a dream he had,
p6
aVa dream to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade.
p7
aVThe eponymous moonshot.
p8
aa(lp9
VNo one knew if it was possible to do
p10
aVbut he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible.
p11
aVThat's how great dreams are.
p12
aVGreat dreams aren't just visions,
p13
aVthey're visions coupled to strategies for making them real.
p14
aa(lp15
VI have the incredible good fortune to work at a moonshot factory.
p16
aVAt X \u2014 formerly called Google X \u2014
p17
aVyou'll find an aerospace engineer working alongside a fashion designer
p18
aVand former military ops commanders brainstorming with laser experts.
p19
aVThese inventors, engineers and makers are dreaming up technologies
p20
aVthat we hope can make the world a wonderful place.
p21
aa(lp22
VWe use the word "moonshots" to remind us to keep our visions big \u2014
p23
aVto keep dreaming.
p24
aVAnd we use the word "factory" to remind ourselves
p25
aVthat we want to have concrete visions \u2014
p26
aVconcrete plans to make them real.
p27
aa(lp28
VHere's our moonshot blueprint.
p29
aVNumber one:
p30
aVwe want to find a huge problem in the world
p31
aVthat affects many millions of people.
p32
aVNumber two:
p33
aVwe want to find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem.
p34
aVAnd then number three:
p35
aVthere has to be some reason to believe
p36
aVthat the technology for such a radical solution
p37
aVcould actually be built.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut I have a secret for you.
p40
aVThe moonshot factory is a messy place.
p41
aVBut rather than avoid the mess,
p42
aVpretend it's not there,
p43
aVwe've tried to make that our strength.
p44
aVWe spend most of our time breaking things
p45
aVand trying to prove that we're wrong.
p46
aVThat's it, that's the secret.
p47
aVRun at all the hardest parts of the problem first.
p48
aVGet excited and cheer,
p49
aV"Hey! How are we going to kill our project today?"
p50
aa(lp51
VWe've got this interesting balance going
p52
aVwhere we allow our unchecked optimism to fuel our visions.
p53
aVBut then we also harness enthusiastic skepticism
p54
aVto breathe life, breathe reality into those visions.
p55
aa(lp56
VI want to show you a few of the projects
p57
aVthat we've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor,
p58
aVand also a few of the gems
p59
aVthat at least so far, have not only survived that process,
p60
aVbut have been accelerated by it.
p61
aa(lp62
VLast year we killed a project in automated vertical farming.
p63
aVThis is some of the lettuce that we grew.
p64
aVOne in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment.
p65
aVSo this is a moonshot that needs to happen.
p66
aVVertical farming uses 10 times less water
p67
aVand a hundred times less land than conventional farming.
p68
aVAnd because you can grow the food close to where it's consumed,
p69
aVyou don't have to transport it large distances.
p70
aVWe made progress in a lot of the areas
p71
aVlike automated harvesting and efficient lighting.
p72
aVBut unfortunately,
p73
aVwe couldn't get staple crops like grains and rice to grow this way.
p74
aVSo we killed the project.
p75
aa(lp76
VHere's another huge problem.
p77
aVWe pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage
p78
aVto ship goods worldwide.
p79
aVEconomic development of landlocked countries
p80
aVis limited by lack of shipping infrastructure.
p81
aVThe radical solution?
p82
aVA lighter-than-air, variable-buoyancy cargo ship.
p83
aVThis has the potential to lower,
p84
aVat least overall,
p85
aVthe cost, time and carbon footprint of shipping
p86
aVwithout needing runways.
p87
aVWe came up with this clever set of technical breakthroughs
p88
aVthat together might make it possible for us to lower the cost enough
p89
aVthat we could actually make these ships \u2014
p90
aVinexpensively enough in volume.
p91
aVBut however cheap they would have been to make in volume
p92
aVit turned out that it was going to cost close to 200 million dollars
p93
aVto design and build the first one.
p94
aa(lp95
V200 million dollars is just way too expensive.
p96
aVBecause X is structured with these tight feedback loops
p97
aVof making mistakes and learning and new designs,
p98
aVwe can't spend 200 million dollars
p99
aVto get the first data point
p100
aVabout whether we're on the right track or not.
p101
aVIf there's an Achilles' heel in one our projects,
p102
aVwe want to know it now, up front, not way down the road.
p103
aVSo we killed this project, too.
p104
aa(lp105
VDiscovering a major flaw in a project
p106
aVdoesn't always mean that it ends the project.
p107
aVSometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis is our fully self-driving vehicle prototype,
p110
aVwhich we built without a steering wheel or break pedal.
p111
aVBut that wasn't actually our goal when we started.
p112
aa(lp113
VWith 1.2 million people dying on the roads globally every year,
p114
aVbuilding a car that drives itself was a natural moonshot to take.
p115
aVThree and a half years ago,
p116
aVwhen we had these Lexus, retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing,
p117
aVthey were doing so well, we gave them out to other Googlers
p118
aVto find out what they thought of the experience.
p119
aVAnd what we discovered
p120
aVwas that our plan to have the cars do almost all the driving
p121
aVand just hand over to the users in case of emergency
p122
aVwas a really bad plan.
p123
aVIt wasn't safe
p124
aVbecause the users didn't do their job.
p125
aVThey didn't stay alert
p126
aVin case the car needed to hand control back to them.
p127
aa(lp128
VThis was a major crisis for the team.
p129
aVIt sent them back to the drawing board.
p130
aVAnd they came up with a beautiful, new perspective.
p131
aVAim for a car where you're truly a passenger.
p132
aVYou tell the car where you want to go,
p133
aVyou push a button
p134
aVand it takes you from point A to point B by itself.
p135
aa(lp136
VWe're really grateful
p137
aVthat we had this insight as early on in the project as we did.
p138
aVAnd it's shaped everything we've done since then.
p139
aVAnd now our cars have self-driven more than 1.4 million miles,
p140
aVand they're out everyday
p141
aVon the streets of Mountain View, California and Austin, Texas.
p142
aa(lp143
VThe cars team shifted their perspective.
p144
aVThis is one of X's mantras.
p145
aVSometimes shifting your perspective is more powerful than being smart.
p146
aa(lp147
VTake wind energy.
p148
aVIt's one of my favorite examples of perspective shifting.
p149
aVThere's no way that we're going to build
p150
aVa better standard wind turbine than the experts in that industry.
p151
aVBut we found a way to get up higher into the sky,
p152
aVand so get access to faster, more consistent winds,
p153
aVand so more energy without needing hundreds of tons of steel to get there.
p154
aa(lp155
VOur Makani energy kite rises up from its perch
p156
aVby spinning up those propellers along its wing.
p157
aVAnd it pulls out a tether as it rises,
p158
aVpulling energy up through the tether.
p159
aVOnce the tether's all the way out,
p160
aVit goes into crosswind circles in the sky.
p161
aVAnd now those propellers that lifted it up have become flying turbines.
p162
aVAnd that sends energy back down the tether.
p163
aa(lp164
VWe haven't yet found a way to kill this project.
p165
aVAnd the longer it survives that pressure, the more excited we get
p166
aVthat this could become a cheaper and more deployable form
p167
aVof wind energy for the world.
p168
aa(lp169
VProbably the craziest sounding project we have is Project Loon.
p170
aVWe're trying to make balloon-powered Internet.
p171
aVA network of balloons in the stratosphere
p172
aVthat beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world.
p173
aVThis could bring online as many as four billion more people,
p174
aVwho today have little or no internet connection.
p175
aa(lp176
VBut you can't just take a cell tower,
p177
aVstrap it to a balloon and stick it in the sky.
p178
aVThe winds are too strong, it would be blown away.
p179
aVAnd the balloons are too high up to tie it to the ground.
p180
aa(lp181
VHere comes the crazy moment.
p182
aVWhat if, instead,
p183
aVwe let the balloons drift
p184
aVand we taught them how to sail the winds to go where the needed to go?
p185
aVIt turns out the stratosphere has winds
p186
aVthat are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata.
p187
aVSo we hoped that using smart algorithms and wind data from around the world,
p188
aVwe could maneuver the balloons a bit,
p189
aVgetting them to go up and down just a tiny bit in the stratosphere
p190
aVto grab those winds going in those different directions and speeds.
p191
aVThe idea is to have enough balloons
p192
aVso as one balloon floats out of your area,
p193
aVthere's another balloon ready to float into place,
p194
aVhanding off the internet connection,
p195
aVjust like your phone hands off between cell towers
p196
aVas you drive down the freeway.
p197
aa(lp198
VWe get how crazy that vision sounds \u2014
p199
aVthere's the name of the project to remind us of that.
p200
aVSo since 2012,
p201
aVthe Loon team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult
p202
aVand so the most likely to kill their project.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe first thing that they did
p205
aVwas try to get a Wi-Fi connection from a balloon in the stratosphere
p206
aVdown to an antenna on the ground.
p207
aVIt worked.
p208
aVAnd I promise you there were bets that it wasn't going to.
p209
aVSo we kept going.
p210
aa(lp211
VCould we get the balloon to talk directly to handsets,
p212
aVso that we didn't need the antenna as an intermediary receiver?
p213
aVYeah.
p214
aa(lp215
VCould we get the balloon bandwidth high enough
p216
aVso it was a real Internet connection?
p217
aVSo that people could have something more than just SMS?
p218
aVThe early tests weren't even a megabit per second,
p219
aVbut now we can do up to 15 megabits per second.
p220
aVEnough to watch a TED Talk.
p221
aa(lp222
VCould we get the balloons to talk to each other through the sky
p223
aVso that we could reach our signal deeper into rural areas?
p224
aVCheck.
p225
aa(lp226
VCould we get balloons the size of a house to stay up for more than 100 days,
p227
aVwhile costing less than five percent
p228
aVof what traditional, long-life balloons have cost to make?
p229
aVYes. In the end.
p230
aVBut I promise you, you name it, we had to try it to get there.
p231
aVWe made round, silvery balloons.
p232
aVWe made giant pillow-shaped balloons.
p233
aVWe made balloons the size of a blue whale.
p234
aVWe busted a lot of balloons.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VSince one of the things that was most likely to kill the Loon project
p239
aVwas whether we could guide the balloons through the sky,
p240
aVone of our most important experiments was putting a balloon inside a balloon.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo there are two compartments here, one with air and then one with helium.
p243
aVThe balloon pumps air in to make itself heavier,
p244
aVor lets air out to make it lighter.
p245
aVAnd these weight changes allow it to rise or fall,
p246
aVand that simple movement of the balloon is its steering mechanism.
p247
aVIt floats up or down,
p248
aVhoping to grab winds going in the speed and direction that it wants.
p249
aa(lp250
VBut is that good enough for it to navigate through the world?
p251
aVBarely at first,
p252
aVbut better all the time.
p253
aa(lp254
VThis particular balloon, our latest balloon,
p255
aVcan navigate a two-mile vertical stretch of sky
p256
aVand can sail itself to within 500 meters of where it wants to go
p257
aVfrom 20,000 kilometers away.
p258
aa(lp259
VWe have lots more to do
p260
aVin terms of fine-tuning the system and reducing costs.
p261
aVBut last year, a balloon built inexpensively
p262
aVwent around the world 19 times over 187 days.
p263
aVSo we're going to keep going.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VOur balloons today
p268
aVare doing pretty much everything a complete system needs to do.
p269
aVWe're in discussions with telcos around the world,
p270
aVand we're going to fly over places like Indonesia
p271
aVfor real service testing this year.
p272
aa(lp273
VThis probably all sounds too good to be true,
p274
aVand you're right.
p275
aVBeing audacious
p276
aVand working on big, risky things
p277
aVmakes people inherently uncomfortable.
p278
aa(lp279
VYou cannot yell at people and force them to fail fast.
p280
aVPeople resist. They worry.
p281
aV"What will happen to me if I fail?
p282
aVWill people laugh at me?
p283
aVWill I be fired?"
p284
aa(lp285
VI started with our secret.
p286
aVI'm going to leave you with how we actually make it happen.
p287
aVThe only way to get people to work on big, risky things \u2014
p288
aVaudacious ideas \u2014
p289
aVand have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first,
p290
aVis if you make that the path of least resistance for them.
p291
aa(lp292
VWe work hard at X to make it safe to fail.
p293
aVTeams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table
p294
aVbecause they're rewarded for it.
p295
aVThey get applause from their peers.
p296
aVHugs and high fives from their manager, me in particular.
p297
aVThey get promoted for it.
p298
aVWe have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects,
p299
aVfrom teams as small as two to teams of more than 30.
p300
aa(lp301
VWe believe in dreams at the moonshot factory.
p302
aVBut enthusiastic skepticism
p303
aVis not the enemy of boundless optimism.
p304
aVIt's optimism's perfect partner.
p305
aVIt unlocks the potential in every idea.
p306
aVWe can create the future that's in our dreams.
p307
aa(lp308
VThank you very much.
p309
aa(lp310

VHi. I'm going to talk  to you today about laughter,
p5
aVand I just want to start  by thinking about the first time
p6
aVI can ever remember noticing laughter.
p7
aVThis is when I was a little girl. I would've been about six.
p8
aVAnd I came across my parents doing something unusual,
p9
aVwhere they were laughing.
p10
aVThey were laughing very, very hard.
p11
aVThey were lying on the floor laughing.
p12
aVThey were screaming with laughter.
p13
aVI did not know what they were  laughing at, but I wanted in.
p14
aVI wanted to be part of that,
p15
aVand I kind of sat around at the edge going, "Hoo hoo!" (Laughter)
p16
aVNow, incidentally, what they were laughing at
p17
aVwas a song which people used to sing,
p18
aVwhich was based around signs in toilets on trains
p19
aVtelling you what you could and could not do
p20
aVin toilets on trains.
p21
aVAnd the thing you have to remember about the English is, of course,
p22
aVwe do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VAt the time, though, I didn't understand anything of that.
p26
aVI just cared about the laughter,
p27
aVand actually, as a neuroscientist, I've come to care about it again.
p28
aVAnd it is a really weird thing to do.
p29
aVWhat I'm going to do now is just play some examples
p30
aVof real human beings laughing,
p31
aVand I want you think about the sound people make and how odd that can be,
p32
aVand in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound.
p33
aVIt's much more like an animal call than it is like speech.
p34
aVSo here we've got some laughter for you. The first one is pretty joyful.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Audio: Laughing)
p37
aa(lp38
VNow this next guy, I need him to breathe.
p39
aVThere's a point in there where I'm just, like,
p40
aVyou've got to get some air in there, mate,
p41
aVbecause he just sounds like he's breathing out.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Audio: Laughing)
p44
aa(lp45
VThis hasn't been edited; this is him.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Audio: Laughing) (Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd finally we have \u2014  this is a human female laughing.
p50
aVAnd laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises.
p51
aV(Audio: Laughing)
p52
aVShe actually says, "Oh my God, what is that?" in French.
p53
aVWe're all kind of with her. I have no idea.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow, to understand laughter, you have to look at a part of the body
p56
aVthat psychologists and neuroscientists don't normally spend much time looking at,
p57
aVwhich is the ribcage,
p58
aVand it doesn't seem terribly exciting,
p59
aVbut actually you're all using  your ribcage all the time.
p60
aVWhat you're all doing  at the moment with your ribcage,
p61
aVand don't stop doing it, is breathing.
p62
aVSo you use the intercostal muscles, the muscles between your ribs,
p63
aVto bring air in and out of your lungs
p64
aVjust by expanding and contracting your ribcage,
p65
aVand if I was to put a strap  around the outside of your chest
p66
aVcalled a breath belt, and just look  at that movement,
p67
aVyou see a rather gentle sinusoidal movement, so that's breathing.
p68
aVYou're all doing it. Don't stop.
p69
aVAs soon as you start talking,
p70
aVyou start using your breathing completely differently.
p71
aVSo what I'm doing now is you see something much more like this.
p72
aVIn talking, you use very fine movements of the ribcage
p73
aVto squeeze the air out \u2014
p74
aVand in fact, we're the only animals that can do this.
p75
aVIt's why we can talk at all.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy,
p78
aVand that enemy is laughter,
p79
aVbecause what happens when you laugh
p80
aVis those same muscles start to contract very regularly,
p81
aVand you get this very marked sort of zig-zagging,
p82
aVand that's just squeezing the air out of you.
p83
aVIt literally is that basic a way of making a sound.
p84
aVYou could be stamping on somebody, it's having the same effect.
p85
aVYou're just squeezing air out,
p86
aVand each of those contractions \u2014 Ha! \u2014 gives you a sound.
p87
aVAnd as the contractions run together, you can get these spasms,
p88
aVand that's when you start getting these \u2014 (Wheezing) \u2014 things happening.
p89
aVI'm brilliant at this. (Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, in terms of the science of laughter, there isn't very much,
p92
aVbut it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know
p93
aVabout laughter is wrong.
p94
aVSo it's not at all unusual, for example, to hear people to say
p95
aVhumans are the only animals that laugh.
p96
aVNietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh.
p97
aVIn fact, you find laughter throughout the mammals.
p98
aVIt's been well-described and well-observed in primates,
p99
aVbut you also see it in rats,
p100
aVand wherever you find it \u2014
p101
aVhumans, primates, rats \u2014
p102
aVyou find it associated with things like tickling.
p103
aVThat's the same for humans.
p104
aVYou find it associated with play, and all mammals play.
p105
aVAnd wherever you find it, it's associated with interactions.
p106
aVSo Robert Provine, who has done a lot of work on this,
p107
aVhas pointed out that you are 30 times  more likely to laugh
p108
aVif you are with somebody else than if you're on your own,
p109
aVand where you find most laughter
p110
aVis in social interactions like conversation.
p111
aVSo if you ask human beings, "When do you laugh?"
p112
aVthey'll talk about comedy and they'll talk about humor and they'll talk about jokes.
p113
aVIf you look at when they laugh, they're laughing with their friends.
p114
aVAnd when we laugh with people, we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes.
p115
aVYou are laughing to show people that you understand them,
p116
aVthat you agree with them, that you're part of the same group as them.
p117
aVYou're laughing to show that you like them.
p118
aVYou might even love them.
p119
aVYou're doing all that at the same time as talking to them,
p120
aVand the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you.
p121
aVSomething that Robert Provine has pointed out, as you can see here,
p122
aVand the reason why we were laughing
p123
aVwhen we heard those funny laughs at the start,
p124
aVand why I was laughing when I found my parents laughing,
p125
aVis that it's an enormously behaviorally contagious effect.
p126
aVYou can catch laughter from somebody else,
p127
aVand you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them.
p128
aVSo it's still modulated by this social context.
p129
aVYou have to put humor to one side
p130
aVand think about the social  meaning of laughter
p131
aVbecause that's where its origins lie.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, something I've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter,
p134
aVand we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize
p135
aVthat suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have.
p136
aVSo it seems possible that the neurobiology for helpless, involuntary laughter,
p137
aVlike my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song,
p138
aVmight have a different basis to it than some of that more polite
p139
aVsocial laughter that you encounter, which isn't horrible laughter,
p140
aVbut it's behavior somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you,
p141
aVpart of their interaction with you; they are choosing to do this.
p142
aVIn our evolution, we have developed two different ways of vocalizing.
p143
aVInvoluntary vocalizations are part of an older system
p144
aVthan the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech I'm doing now.
p145
aVSo we might imagine that laughter might actually have two different roots.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo I've been looking at this in more detail.
p148
aVTo do this, we've had to make recordings of people laughing,
p149
aVand we've had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh,
p150
aVand we got those same people to produce more posed, social laughter.
p151
aVSo imagine your friend told a joke,
p152
aVand you're laughing because you like your friend,
p153
aVbut not really because the joke's all that.
p154
aVSo I'm going to play you  a couple of those.
p155
aVI want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter,
p156
aVor if you think it's posed.
p157
aVSo is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter?
p158
aa(lp159
V(Audio: Laughing)
p160
aa(lp161
VWhat does that sound like to you?
p162
aVAudience: Posed. Sophie Scott: Posed? Posed.
p163
aVHow about this one?
p164
aa(lp165
V(Audio: Laughing)
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VI'm the best.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VNot really.
p174
aVNo, that was helpless laughter,
p175
aVand in fact, to record that, all they had to do was record me
p176
aVwatching one of my friends listening to something I knew she wanted to laugh at,
p177
aVand I just started doing this.
p178
aa(lp179
VWhat you find is that people are good at telling the difference
p180
aVbetween real and posed laughter.
p181
aVThey seem to be different things to us.
p182
aVInterestingly, you see something quite similar with chimpanzees.
p183
aVChimpanzees laugh differently if they're being tickled
p184
aVthan if they're playing with each other,
p185
aVand we might be seeing something like that here,
p186
aVinvoluntary laughter, tickling laughter, being different from social laughter.
p187
aVThey're acoustically very different.
p188
aVThe real laughs are longer. They're higher in pitch.
p189
aVWhen you start laughing hard,
p190
aVyou start squeezing air out from your lungs
p191
aVunder much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily.
p192
aVFor example, I could never pitch my voice that high to sing.
p193
aVAlso, you start to get these sort of contractions and weird whistling sounds,
p194
aVall of which mean that real laughter is extremely easy,
p195
aVor feels extremely easy to spot.
p196
aa(lp197
VIn contrast, posed laughter, we might think it sounds a bit fake.
p198
aVActually, it's not, it's actually an important social cue.
p199
aVWe use it a lot, we're choosing to laugh in a lot of situations,
p200
aVand it seems to be its own thing.
p201
aVSo, for example, you find nasality in posed laughter,
p202
aVthat kind of "ha ha ha ha ha" sound
p203
aVthat you never get, you could not do, if you were laughing involuntarily.
p204
aVSo they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things.
p205
aa(lp206
VWe took it into the scanner to see how brains respond
p207
aVwhen you hear laughter.
p208
aVAnd when you do this, this is a really boring experiment.
p209
aVWe just played people real and posed laughs.
p210
aVWe didn't tell them it was a study on laughter.
p211
aVWe put other sounds in there  to distract them,
p212
aVand all they're doing is lying listening to sounds.
p213
aVWe don't tell them to do anything.
p214
aVNonetheless, when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter,
p215
aVthe brains are responding completely differently,
p216
aVsignificantly differently.
p217
aVWhat you see in the regions in blue, which lies in auditory cortex,
p218
aVare the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs,
p219
aVand what seems to be the case,
p220
aVwhen you hear somebody laughing involuntarily,
p221
aVyou hear sounds you would never hear in any other context.
p222
aVIt's very unambiguous,
p223
aVand it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing
p224
aVof these novel sounds.
p225
aVIn contrast, when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way,
p226
aVwhat you see are these regions in pink,
p227
aVwhich are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing,
p228
aVthinking about what somebody else is thinking.
p229
aVAnd I think what that means is,
p230
aVeven if you're having your brain scanned, which is completely boring
p231
aVand not very interesting,
p232
aVwhen you hear somebody going, "A ha ha ha ha ha,"
p233
aVyou're trying to work out why they're laughing.
p234
aVLaughter is always meaningful.
p235
aVYou are always trying to understand it in context,
p236
aVeven if, as far as you are concerned, at that point in time,
p237
aVit has not necessarily anything to do with you,
p238
aVyou still want to know why those people are laughing.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, we've had the opportunity to look  at how people hear real and posed laughter
p241
aVacross the age range.
p242
aVSo this is an online experiment we ran with the Royal Society,
p243
aVand here we just asked people two questions.
p244
aVFirst of all, they heard some laughs,
p245
aVand they had to say, how real  or posed do these laughs sound?
p246
aVThe real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown in blue.
p247
aVWhat you see is there is a rapid onset.
p248
aVAs you get older, you get better and better at spotting real laughter.
p249
aVSo six-year-olds are at chance, they can't really hear the difference.
p250
aVBy the time you are older, you get better,
p251
aVbut interestingly, you do not hit peak performance in this dataset
p252
aVuntil you are in your late 30s and early 40s.
p253
aVYou don't understand laughter fully by the time you hit puberty.
p254
aVYou don't understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured
p255
aVat the end of your teens.
p256
aVYou're learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life.
p257
aa(lp258
VIf we turn the question around and now say not, what does the laughter sound like
p259
aVin terms of being real or posed, but we say,
p260
aVhow much does this laughter make you want to laugh,
p261
aVhow contagious is this laughter to you, we see a different profile.
p262
aVAnd here, the younger you are,
p263
aVthe more you want to join in when you hear laughter.
p264
aVRemember me laughing with my parents when I had no idea what was going on.
p265
aVYou really can see this.
p266
aVNow everybody, young and old,
p267
aVfinds the real laughs more contagious than the posed laughs,
p268
aVbut as you get older, it all becomes  less contagious to you.
p269
aVNow, either we're all just becoming really grumpy as we get older,
p270
aVor it may mean that as you understand laughter better,
p271
aVand you are getting better at doing that,
p272
aVyou need more than just hearing people laugh to want to laugh.
p273
aVYou need the social stuff there.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo we've got a very interesting behavior
p276
aVabout which a lot of our lay assumptions are incorrect,
p277
aVbut I'm coming to see that actually there's even more to laughter
p278
aVthan it's an important social emotion we should look at,
p279
aVbecause it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced
p280
aVin terms of how we use laughter.
p281
aVThere's a really lovely set of studies coming out
p282
aVfrom Robert Levenson's lab in California,
p283
aVwhere he's doing a longitudinal study with couples.
p284
aVHe gets married couples, men and women, into the lab,
p285
aVand he gives them stressful conversations to have
p286
aVwhile he wires them up to a polygraph so he can see them becoming stressed.
p287
aVSo you've got the two of them in there, and he'll say to the husband,
p288
aV"Tell me something that your wife does that irritates you."
p289
aVAnd what you see is immediately \u2014
p290
aVjust run that one through your head briefly, you and your partner \u2014
p291
aVyou can imagine everybody gets a bit more stressed as soon as that starts.
p292
aVYou can see physically, people become more stressed.
p293
aVWhat he finds is that the couples who manage that feeling of stress
p294
aVwith laughter, positive emotions like laughter,
p295
aVnot only immediately become less stressed,
p296
aVthey can see them physically feeling better,
p297
aVthey're dealing with this unpleasant situation better together,
p298
aVthey are also the couples that report
p299
aVhigh levels of satisfaction in their relationship
p300
aVand they stay together for longer.
p301
aVSo in fact, when you look at close relationships,
p302
aVlaughter is a phenomenally useful index
p303
aVof how people are regulating their emotions together.
p304
aVWe're not just emitting it at each other to show that we like each other,
p305
aVwe're making ourselves feel better together.
p306
aa(lp307
VNow, I don't think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships.
p308
aVI think this is probably going to be a characteristic
p309
aVof close emotional relationships such as you might have with friends,
p310
aVwhich explains my next clip,
p311
aVwhich is of a YouTube video of some young men in the former East Germany
p312
aVon making a video to promote their heavy metal band,
p313
aVand it's extremely macho, and the mood is very serious,
p314
aVand I want you to notice what happens in terms of laughter
p315
aVwhen things go wrong
p316
aVand how quickly that happens, and how that changes the mood.
p317
aa(lp318
VHe's cold. He's about to get wet. He's got swimming trunks on,
p319
aVgot a towel.
p320
aVIce.
p321
aVWhat might possibly happen?
p322
aVVideo starts.
p323
aVSerious mood.
p324
aVAnd his friends are already laughing. They are already laughing, hard.
p325
aVHe's not laughing yet.
p326
aV(Laughter)
p327
aVHe's starting to go now.
p328
aVAnd now they're all off.
p329
aV(Laughter)
p330
aVThey're on the floor.
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VThe thing I really like about that is it's all very serious
p334
aVuntil he jumps onto the ice, and as soon as he doesn't go through the ice,
p335
aVbut also there isn't blood and bone everywhere,
p336
aVhis friends start laughing.
p337
aVAnd imagine if that had played him out with him standing there going,
p338
aV"No seriously, Heinrich, I think this is broken,"
p339
aVwe wouldn't enjoy watching that. That would be stressful.
p340
aVOr if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing,
p341
aVand his friends are going, "Heinrich, I think we need to go to the hospital now,"
p342
aVthat also wouldn't be funny.
p343
aVThe fact that the laughter works,
p344
aVit gets him from a painful, embarrassing, difficult situation,
p345
aVinto a funny situation, into what we're  actually enjoying there,
p346
aVand I think that's  a really interesting use,
p347
aVand it's actually happening all the time.
p348
aa(lp349
VFor example, I can remember something like this happening
p350
aVat my father's funeral.
p351
aVWe weren't jumping around on the ice in our underpants.
p352
aVWe're not Canadian.
p353
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p354
aVThese events are always difficult, I had a relative who was being a bit difficult,
p355
aVmy mum was not in a good place,
p356
aVand I can remember finding myself just before the whole thing started
p357
aVtelling this story about something that happened in a 1970s sitcom,
p358
aVand I just thought at the time, I don't know why I'm doing this,
p359
aVand what I realized I was doing
p360
aVwas I was coming up with something from somewhere
p361
aVI could use to make her laugh together with me.
p362
aVIt was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this.
p363
aVWe can laugh together. We're going to get through this.
p364
aVWe're going to be okay.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd in fact, all of us are doing this all the time.
p367
aVYou do it so often, you don't even notice it.
p368
aVEverybody underestimates how often they laugh,
p369
aVand you're doing something, when you laugh with people,
p370
aVthat's actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system
p371
aVthat mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds,
p372
aVand clearly to regulate emotions, to make ourselves feel better.
p373
aVIt's not something specific to humans \u2014 it's a really ancient behavior
p374
aVwhich really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better.
p375
aa(lp376
VIn other words, when it comes to laughter,
p377
aVyou and me, baby, ain't nothing  but mammals. (Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VThank you.
p380
aa(lp381
VThank you. (Applause)

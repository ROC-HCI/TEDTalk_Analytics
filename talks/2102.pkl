VThis is my niece, Stella.
p5
aVShe's just turned one and started to walk.
p6
aVAnd she's walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do,
p7
aVa kind of teetering, my-body's-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.
p8
aVIt is absolutely gorgeous.
p9
aVAnd one of her favorite  things to do at the moment
p10
aVis to stare at herself in the mirror.
p11
aVShe absolutely loves her reflection.
p12
aVShe giggles and squeals, and gives herself these big, wet kisses.
p13
aVIt is beautiful.
p14
aVApparently, all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this,
p15
aVand it got me thinking:
p16
aVWhen did I stop doing this?
p17
aVWhen is it suddenly not okay to love  the way that we look?
p18
aVBecause apparently we don't.
p19
aa(lp20
VTen thousand people every month google,
p21
aV"Am I ugly?"
p22
aVThis is Faye. Faye is 13 and she  lives in Denver.
p23
aVAnd like any teenager, she just wants to  be liked and to fit in.
p24
aVIt's Sunday night.
p25
aVShe's getting ready for the week ahead at school.
p26
aVAnd she's slightly dreading it, and  she's a bit confused because
p27
aVdespite her mom telling her all the time
p28
aVthat she's beautiful,
p29
aVevery day at school, someone tells her  that she's ugly.
p30
aVBecause of the difference between what her mom  tells her and what her friends
p31
aVat school, or her peers at school are telling her,
p32
aVshe doesn't know who to believe.
p33
aVSo, she takes a video of herself.  She posts it to YouTube
p34
aVand she asks people to please leave  a comment:
p35
aV"Am I pretty or am I ugly?"
p36
aVWell, so far, Faye has received  over 13,000 comments.
p37
aVSome of them are so nasty, they don't  bear thinking about.
p38
aVThis is an average, healthy-looking  teenage girl receiving this feedback
p39
aVat one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life.
p40
aVThousands of people are posting videos like this,
p41
aVmostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.
p42
aVBut what's leading them to do this?
p43
aa(lp44
VWell, today's teenagers are rarely alone.
p45
aVThey're under pressure to be online and available at all times,
p46
aVtalking, messaging, liking, commenting,  sharing, posting \u2014
p47
aVit never ends.
p48
aVNever before have we been so connected,
p49
aVso continuously, so instantaneously, so young.
p50
aVAnd as one mom told me, it's like there's a party in their bedroom every night.
p51
aVThere's simply no privacy.
p52
aVAnd the social pressures that go along  with that are relentless.
p53
aVThis always-on environment is training our kids to value themselves
p54
aVbased on the number of likes they get
p55
aVand the types of comments that they receive.
p56
aVThere's no separation between online and offline life.
p57
aVWhat's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference between.
p58
aVAnd it's also really hard to tell the difference  between what's authentic
p59
aVand what's digitally manipulated.
p60
aVWhat's a highlight in someone's life versus what's normal in the context of everyday.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd where are they looking to for inspiration?
p63
aVWell, you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds
p64
aVof girls today.
p65
aVSize zero models still dominate our catwalks.
p66
aVAirbrushing is now routine.
p67
aVAnd trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap,
p68
aV#bikinibridge and #proana.
p69
aVFor those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.
p70
aVThese trends are teamed with the  stereotyping and flagrant objectification
p71
aVof women in today's popular culture.
p72
aVIt is not hard to see what girls are benchmarking themselves against.
p73
aVBut boys are not immune to this either.
p74
aVAspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of superhero-like sports stars
p75
aVand playboy music artists.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut, what's the problem with all of this?
p78
aVWell, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy,  well balanced individuals.
p79
aVBut in an image-obsessed culture, we are training our kids
p80
aVto spend more time and mental effort on  their appearance
p81
aVat the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities.
p82
aVSo, things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities,
p83
aVand their studies and so on begin to suffer.
p84
aVSix out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do  something because they don't
p85
aVthink they look good enough.
p86
aVThese are not trivial activities.
p87
aVThese are fundamental activities to their development as humans
p88
aVand as contributors to society and to  the workforce.
p89
aVThirty-one percent, nearly one in  three teenagers, are withdrawing
p90
aVfrom classroom debate. They're failing
p91
aVto engage in classroom debate because
p92
aVthey don't want to draw attention to the  way that they look.
p93
aVOne in five are not showing up to class at all
p94
aVon days when they don't feel good about it.
p95
aVAnd when it comes to exams,
p96
aVif you don't think you look good enough,
p97
aVspecifically if you don't think you are thin enough,
p98
aVyou will score a lower grade point average
p99
aVthan your peers who are not concerned with this.
p100
aVAnd this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.
p101
aVand China, and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh.
p102
aVSo to be super clear, we're talking about the
p103
aVway you think you look, not how you actually look.
p104
aVLow body confidence is undermining  academic achievement.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut it's also damaging health.
p107
aVTeenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity,
p108
aVeat less fruits and vegetables,
p109
aVpartake in more unhealthy weight control practices
p110
aVthat can lead to eating disorders.
p111
aVThey have lower self-esteem.
p112
aVThey're more easily influenced by people around them
p113
aVand they're at greater risk of depression.
p114
aVAnd we think it's for all of these reasons that they take more risks
p115
aVwith things like alcohol and drug use;
p116
aVcrash dieting; cosmetic surgery;  unprotected, earlier sex;
p117
aVand self-harm.
p118
aVThe pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems
p119
aVand costing our governments billions of  dollars every year.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd we don't grow out of it.
p122
aVWomen who think they're overweight \u2014 again,
p123
aVregardless of whether they are or are not \u2014
p124
aVhave higher rates of absenteeism.
p125
aVSeventeen percent of women would
p126
aVnot show up to a job interview on
p127
aVa day when they weren't feeling confident about the way that they look.
p128
aa(lp129
VHave a think about what this is doing
p130
aVto our economy.
p131
aVIf we could overcome this, what that
p132
aVopportunity looks like.
p133
aVUnlocking this potential is in the interest
p134
aVof every single one of us.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut how do we do that?
p137
aVWell, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.
p138
aVIt's not enough by itself.
p139
aVIf you actually want to make a difference,
p140
aVyou have to do something.
p141
aVAnd we've learned there are three key ways:
p142
aVThe first is we have to educate for body confidence.
p143
aVWe have to help our teenagers develop
p144
aVstrategies to overcome image-related pressures
p145
aVand build their self-esteem.
p146
aVNow, the good news is that there are
p147
aVmany programs out there available to do this.
p148
aVThe bad news is that most of them don't work.
p149
aVI was shocked to learn that many well-meaning
p150
aVprograms are inadvertently actually
p151
aVmaking the situation worse.
p152
aVSo we need to make damn sure that
p153
aVthe programs that our kids are receiving
p154
aVare not only having a positive impact,
p155
aVbut having a lasting impact as well.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd the research shows  that the best programs
p158
aVaddress six key areas:
p159
aVThe first is the influence of family,  friends and relationships.
p160
aVThe second is media and celebrity culture,
p161
aVthen how to handle teasing and bullying,
p162
aVthe way we compete and compare with one another
p163
aVbased on looks,
p164
aVtalking about appearance \u2014 some people
p165
aVcall this "body talk" or "fat talk" \u2014
p166
aVand finally, the foundations of respecting
p167
aVand looking after yourself.
p168
aVThese six things are crucial starting points
p169
aVfor anyone serious about delivering
p170
aVbody-confidence education that works.
p171
aVAn education is critical,
p172
aVbut tackling this problem is going
p173
aVto require each and everyone of us
p174
aVto step up and be better role models
p175
aVfor the women and girls in our own lives.
p176
aVChallenging the status quo of how
p177
aVwomen are seen and talked about in our own circles.
p178
aa(lp179
VIt is not okay that we judge the contribution
p180
aVof our politicians by their haircuts
p181
aVor the size of their breasts,
p182
aVor to infer that the determination or the success
p183
aVof an Olympian is down  to her not being a looker.
p184
aVWe need to start judging people by what they do,
p185
aVnot what they look like.
p186
aa(lp187
VWe can all start by taking responsibility  for the types of pictures
p188
aVand comments that we post
p189
aVon our own social networks.
p190
aVWe can compliment people based on  their effort
p191
aVand their actions
p192
aVand not on their appearance.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd let me ask you,
p195
aVwhen was the last time that you
p196
aVkissed a mirror?
p197
aVUltimately, we need to work together
p198
aVas communities, as governments
p199
aVand as businesses to really change this culture of ours
p200
aVso that our kids grow up valuing their  whole selves,
p201
aVvaluing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
p202
aVWe need to put the people that are making a real difference
p203
aVon our pedestals, making a difference
p204
aVin the real world.
p205
aVGiving them the airtime, because only then
p206
aVwill we create a different world.
p207
aVA world where our kids are free to become
p208
aVthe best versions of themselves,
p209
aVwhere the way they think they look
p210
aVnever holds them back from being who they are
p211
aVor achieving what they want in life.
p212
aa(lp213
VThink about what this might mean  for someone in your life.
p214
aVWho have you got in mind?
p215
aVIs it your wife?
p216
aVYour sister?
p217
aVYour daughter?
p218
aVYour niece?
p219
aVYour friend? It could just be the woman  a couple of seats away
p220
aVfrom you today.
p221
aVWhat would it mean for her
p222
aVif she were freed from that voice
p223
aVof her inner critic, nagging her to have
p224
aVlonger legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach,
p225
aVshorter feet?
p226
aVWhat could it mean for her if we overcame this
p227
aVand unlocked her potential in that way?
p228
aa(lp229
VRight now, our culture's obsession
p230
aVwith image is holding us all back.
p231
aVBut let's show our kids the truth.
p232
aVLet's show them that the way you look
p233
aVis just one part of your identity
p234
aVand that the truth is we love them
p235
aVfor who they are
p236
aVand what they do
p237
aVand how they make us feel.
p238
aVLet's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.
p239
aVLet's each and every one of us change the way
p240
aVwe talk and compare ourselves to other people.
p241
aVAnd let's work together as communities,
p242
aVfrom grassroots to governments,
p243
aVso that the happy little one-year-olds
p244
aVof today become the confident
p245
aVchangemakers of tomorrow.
p246
aVLet's do this.

VGood morning.
p5
aVHappy to see so many fine folks out here
p6
aVand so many smiling faces.
p7
aVI have a very peculiar
p8
aVbackground, attitude and approach
p9
aVto the real world
p10
aVbecause I am a conjurer.
p11
aVNow, I prefer that term over magician,
p12
aVbecause if I were a magician, that would mean
p13
aVthat I use spells and incantations
p14
aVand weird gestures
p15
aVin order to accomplish real magic.
p16
aVNo, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer,
p17
aVwho is someone who pretends to be
p18
aVa real magician. (Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, how do we go about that sort of thing?
p21
aVWe depend on the fact
p22
aVthat audiences, such as yourselves,
p23
aVwill make assumptions.
p24
aVFor example, when I walked up here
p25
aVand I took the microphone from the stand
p26
aVand switched it on,
p27
aVyou assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVAs a matter of fact, this is something
p30
aVthat about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.
p31
aVIt's a beard trimmer, you see?
p32
aVAnd it makes a very bad microphone;
p33
aVI've tried it many times. (Laughter)
p34
aVThe other assumption that you made \u2014
p35
aVand this little lesson is to show you
p36
aVthat you will make assumptions.
p37
aVNot only that you can, but that you will
p38
aVwhen they are properly suggested to you.
p39
aVYou believe I'm looking at you.
p40
aVWrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.
p41
aVI know you're out there, they told me backstage, it's a full house and such.
p42
aVI know you're there because I can hear you,
p43
aVbut I can't see you because I normally wear glasses.
p44
aVThese are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter)
p45
aVQuite empty frames.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow why would a grown man appear before you
p48
aVwearing empty frames on his face?
p49
aVTo fool you, ladies and gentlemen,
p50
aVto deceive you, to show that you, too,
p51
aVcan make assumptions.
p52
aVDon't you ever forget that.
p53
aVNow, I have to do something \u2014 first of all, switch to real glasses
p54
aVso I can actually see you,
p55
aVwhich would probably be a convenience. I don't know.
p56
aVI haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VI have to do something now, which seems
p61
aVa little bit strange for a magician.
p62
aVBut I'm going to take some medication.
p63
aVThis is a full bottle of
p64
aVCalms Forte.
p65
aVI'll explain that in just a moment.
p66
aVIgnore the instructions,
p67
aVthat's what the government has to put in there
p68
aVto confuse you, I'm sure.
p69
aVI will take enough of these. Mm.
p70
aVIndeed, the whole container.
p71
aVThirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow that I've done that \u2014 I'll explain it in a moment \u2014
p74
aVI must tell you that
p75
aVI am an actor.
p76
aVI'm an actor who plays a specific part.
p77
aVI play the part of a magician,
p78
aVa wizard, if you will, a real wizard.
p79
aVIf someone were to appear on this stage in front of me
p80
aVand actually claim to be
p81
aVan ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,
p82
aVyou would be insulted
p83
aVand rightly so.
p84
aVWhy would a man assume that you would believe
p85
aVsomething bizarre like this?
p86
aVBut there exists out there
p87
aVa very large population
p88
aVof people who will tell you
p89
aVthat they have psychic, magical powers
p90
aVthat they can predict the future,
p91
aVthat they can make contact with the deceased.
p92
aVOh, they also say
p93
aVthey will sell you astrology
p94
aVor other fortunetelling methods.
p95
aVOh, they gladly sell you that, yes.
p96
aVAnd they also say
p97
aVthat they can give you perpetual motion machines
p98
aVand free energy systems.
p99
aVThey claim to be psychics,
p100
aVor sensitives, whatever they can.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut the one thing that has made a big comeback
p103
aVjust recently
p104
aVis this business of
p105
aVspeaking with the dead.
p106
aVNow, to my innocent mind,
p107
aVdead implies
p108
aVincapable of communicating. (Laughter)
p109
aVYou might agree with me on that.
p110
aVBut these people, they tend to tell you that
p111
aVnot only can they communicate with the dead \u2014
p112
aV"Hi, there" \u2014
p113
aVbut they can hear the dead as well,
p114
aVand they can relay this information back to the living.
p115
aVI wonder if that's true.
p116
aVI don't think so, because
p117
aVthis subculture of people
p118
aVuse exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,
p119
aVexactly the same \u2014
p120
aVthe same physical methods, the same psychological methods \u2014
p121
aVand they effectively and profoundly
p122
aVdeceive millions of people around the earth,
p123
aVto their detriment.
p124
aVThey deceive these people,
p125
aVcosts them a lot of money,
p126
aVcost them a lot of emotional anguish.
p127
aVBillions of dollars are spent
p128
aVevery year, all over the globe,
p129
aVon these charlatans.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, I have two questions
p132
aVI would like to ask these people
p133
aVif I had the opportunity to do so.
p134
aVFirst question: If I want to ask them to call up \u2014
p135
aVbecause they do hear them through the ear.
p136
aVThey listen to the spirits like this \u2014
p137
aVI'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother
p138
aVbecause, when she died, she had the family will,
p139
aVand she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is,
p140
aVso we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?"
p141
aVWhat does Granny say? She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.
p142
aVI'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,
p143
aVand my family
p144
aVand all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.
p145
aVAnd I love you, and I'll always be with you.
p146
aVGood bye."
p147
aVAnd she didn't answer the damn question!
p148
aVWhere is the will?
p149
aVNow, she could easily have said,
p150
aV"Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,"
p151
aVbut she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.
p152
aVShe doesn't bring any useful information to us.
p153
aVWe paid a lot of money for that information,
p154
aVbe we didn't get it.
p155
aa(lp156
VThe second question that I'd like to ask, rather simple:
p157
aVSuppose I ask them to contact
p158
aVthe spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.
p159
aVWhy do they insist on saying \u2014
p160
aVremember, they speak into this ear \u2014
p161
aVwhy do they say, "My name starts with J or M?"
p162
aVIs this a hunting game?
p163
aVHunting and fishing? What is it?
p164
aVIs it 20 questions? No, it's more like 120 questions.
p165
aVBut it is a cruel, vicious,
p166
aVabsolutely conscienceless \u2014
p167
aVI'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) \u2014
p168
aVgame that these people play.
p169
aVAnd they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,
p170
aVthe grieving, the needy people out there.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, this is a process
p173
aVthat is called cold reading.
p174
aVThere's one fellow out there,
p175
aVVan Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.
p176
aVHe's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.
p177
aVJohn Edward, Sylvia Browne
p178
aVand Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.
p179
aVThere are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,
p180
aVJames Van Praagh is very big.
p181
aVAnd what does he do? He likes to tell you
p182
aVhow the deceased got deceased,
p183
aVthe people he's talking to through his ear, you see?
p184
aVSo what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,
p185
aV"He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,
p186
aVthat he had trouble breathing."
p187
aVFolks, that's what dying is all about!
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVYou stop breathing, and then you're dead.
p190
aVIt's that simple.
p191
aVAnd that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you?
p192
aVI don't think so.
p193
aVNow, these people will make guesses, they'll say things like,
p194
aV"Why am I getting electricity?
p195
aVHe's saying to me, 'Electricity.'
p196
aVWas he an electrician?" "No."
p197
aV"Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No."
p198
aVIt was a game of hunting questions like this.
p199
aVThis is what they go through.
p200
aa(lp201
VNow, folks often ask us
p202
aVat the James Randi Educational Foundation,
p203
aVthey call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?
p204
aVIsn't it just a lot of fun?"
p205
aVNo, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.
p206
aVNow, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,
p207
aVbut that comfort lasts
p208
aVonly about 20 minutes or so.
p209
aVAnd then the people look in the mirror, and they say,
p210
aVI just paid a lot of money for that reading.
p211
aVAnd what did she say to me? 'I love you!'"
p212
aVThey always say that.
p213
aVThey don't get any information,
p214
aVthey don't get any value for what they spend.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.
p217
aVWe call her "The Talons."
p218
aVSylvia Browne \u2014 thank you \u2014
p219
aVSylvia Browne is the big operator
p220
aVin this field at this very moment.
p221
aVNow, Sylvia Browne \u2014 just to show you \u2014
p222
aVshe actually gets 700 dollars
p223
aVfor a 20 minute reading over the telephone,
p224
aVshe doesn't even go there in person,
p225
aVand you have to wait up to two years because
p226
aVshe's booked ahead that amount of time.
p227
aVYou pay by credit card or whatever,
p228
aVand then she will call you
p229
aVsometime in the next two years.
p230
aVYou can tell it's her. "Hello, this is Sylvia Browne."
p231
aVThat's her, you can tell right away.
p232
aVNow, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.
p233
aVWe all know who he is on television.
p234
aVHe's well educated, he's smart,
p235
aVhe knows what Sylvia Browne is doing
p236
aVbut he doesn't give a damn.
p237
aVHe just doesn't care.
p238
aVBecause, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it,
p239
aVand he will expose her
p240
aVto television publicity all the time.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow, what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars?
p243
aVShe gives you the names of your guardian angels, that's first.
p244
aVNow, without that, how could we possibly function? (Laughter)
p245
aVShe gives you the names of previous lives,
p246
aVwho you were in previous lives.
p247
aVDuh.
p248
aVIt turns out that the women
p249
aVthat she gives readings for
p250
aVwere all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.
p251
aVAnd the men were all Grecian warriors
p252
aVfighting with Agamemnon.
p253
aVNothing is ever said about
p254
aVa 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London
p255
aVwho died of consumption.
p256
aVHe isn't worth bringing back, obviously.
p257
aVAnd the strange thing \u2014 folks, you may have noticed this too.
p258
aVYou see these folks on television \u2014
p259
aVthey never call anybody back from hell. (Laughter)
p260
aVEveryone comes back from heaven, but never from hell.
p261
aVIf they call back any of my friends,
p262
aVthey're not going to... Well, you see the story.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VNow, Sylvia Browne is an exception,
p267
aVan exception in one way,
p268
aVbecause the James Randi Educational Foundation, my foundation,
p269
aVoffers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.
p270
aVVery simply won.
p271
aVAll you have to do is prove any paranormal, occult
p272
aVor supernatural event or power of any kind
p273
aVunder proper observing conditions.
p274
aVIt's very easy, win the million dollars.
p275
aVSylvia Browne is an exception in that
p276
aVshe's the only professional psychic
p277
aVin the whole world
p278
aVthat has accepted our challenge.
p279
aVShe did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN
p280
aVsix and a half years ago.
p281
aVAnd we haven't heard from her since. Strange.
p282
aVShe said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.
p283
aVDuh.
p284
aVA professional psychic who speaks to dead people,
p285
aVshe can't reach me?
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVI'm alive, you may have noticed.
p288
aVWell, pretty well anyway.
p289
aVShe couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me
p290
aVbecause I'm a godless person.
p291
aVAll the more reason to take the million dollars,
p292
aVwouldn't you think, Sylvia?
p293
aa(lp294
VNow these people need to be stopped, seriously now.
p295
aVThey need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.
p296
aVWe get people coming to the foundation all the time.
p297
aVThey're ruined financially and emotionally
p298
aVbecause they've given their money and their faith
p299
aVto these people.
p300
aa(lp301
VNow, I popped some pills earlier.
p302
aVI have to explain that to you.
p303
aVHomeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.
p304
aVHmm. You've heard of it.
p305
aVIt's an alternative form of healing, right?
p306
aVHomeopathy actually consists \u2014 and that's what this is.
p307
aVThis is Calms Forte,
p308
aV32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.
p309
aVI just ingested
p310
aVsix and a half days worth of sleeping pills.
p311
aV(Laughter)
p312
aVSix and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.
p313
aVIt says right on the back here,
p314
aV"In case of overdose,
p315
aVcontact your poison control center immediately,"
p316
aVand it gives an 800 number.
p317
aVKeep your seats \u2014 it's going to be okay.
p318
aVI don't really need it
p319
aVbecause I've been doing this stunt
p320
aVfor audiences all over the world
p321
aVfor the last eight or 10 years,
p322
aVtaking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills.
p323
aa(lp324
VWhy don't they affect me?
p325
aV(Laughter)
p326
aV(Applause)
p327
aVThe answer may surprise you.
p328
aVWhat is homeopathy?
p329
aVIt's taking a medicine that really works
p330
aVand diluting it down
p331
aVwell beyond Avogadro's limit.
p332
aVDiluting it down to the point
p333
aVwhere there's none of it left. (Laughter)
p334
aVNow folks, this is not
p335
aVjust a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.
p336
aVIt's exactly equivalent to taking
p337
aVone 325 milligram aspirin tablet,
p338
aVthrowing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,
p339
aVand then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,
p340
aVand waiting two years or so
p341
aVuntil the solution is homogeneous.
p342
aVThen, when you get a headache,
p343
aVyou take a sip of this water, and \u2014 voila! \u2014 it is gone.
p344
aV(Laughter)
p345
aVNow that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd another claim that they make \u2014 you'll love this one \u2014
p348
aVthe more dilute the medicine is, they say,
p349
aVthe more powerful it is.
p350
aVNow wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.
p351
aVThe poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.
p352
aVHe died of an overdose.
p353
aVHe forgot to take his pill.
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aVWork on it. Work on it.
p356
aVIt's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous.
p357
aVI don't know what we're doing,
p358
aVbelieving in all this nonsense over all these years.
p359
aa(lp360
VNow, let me tell you,
p361
aVThe James Randi Educational Foundation
p362
aVis waving this very big carrot,
p363
aVbut I must say, the fact that nobody
p364
aVhas taken us up on this offer
p365
aVdoesn't mean that the powers don't exist.
p366
aVThey might, some place out there.
p367
aVMaybe these people are just independently wealthy.
p368
aVWell, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.
p369
aVYou know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading
p370
aVover the telephone \u2014
p371
aVthat's more than lawyers make!
p372
aVI mean that's a fabulous amount of money.
p373
aVThese people don't need the million dollars perhaps,
p374
aVbut wouldn't you think they'd like to take it
p375
aVjust to make me look silly?
p376
aVJust to get rid of this godless person out there
p377
aVthat Sylvia Browne talks about all the time?
p378
aa(lp379
VI think that something needs to be done about this.
p380
aVWe really would love to have suggestions from you folks
p381
aVon how to contact federal, state
p382
aVand local authorities
p383
aVto get them to do something.
p384
aVIf you find out \u2014 now I understand.
p385
aVWe've seen people, even today, speaking to us
p386
aVabout AIDS epidemics
p387
aVand starving kids around the world
p388
aVand impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.
p389
aVThose are very important,
p390
aVcritically important to us.
p391
aVAnd we must do something about those problems.
p392
aVBut at the same time,
p393
aVas Arthur C. Clarke said,
p394
aVThe rotting of the human mind,
p395
aVthe business of believing in the paranormal and the occult
p396
aVand the supernatural \u2014
p397
aVall of this total nonsense,
p398
aVthis medieval thinking \u2014
p399
aVI think something should be done about that,
p400
aVand it all lies in education.
p401
aVLargely, it's the media
p402
aVwho are to blame for this sort of thing.
p403
aVThey shamelessly promote
p404
aVall kinds of nonsense of this sort
p405
aVbecause it pleases the sponsors.
p406
aVIt's the bottom line, the dollar line.
p407
aVThat's what they're looking at.
p408
aa(lp409
VWe really must do something about this.
p410
aVI'm willing to take your suggestions,
p411
aVand I'm willing to have you
p412
aVtune in to our webpage.
p413
aVIt's www.randi.org.
p414
aVGo in there and look at the archives,
p415
aVand you will begin to understand much more
p416
aVof what I've been talking about today.
p417
aVYou will see the records that we have.
p418
aVThere's nothing like sitting in that library
p419
aVand having a family appear there
p420
aVand say that Mum gave away all the family fortune.
p421
aVShe cashed in the CDs,
p422
aVshe gave away the stocks and the certificates.
p423
aVThat's really sad to hear,
p424
aVand it hasn't helped them one bit,
p425
aVhasn't solved any of their problems.
p426
aVYes, there could be a rotting of the American mind,
p427
aVand of the minds all the way around the earth,
p428
aVif we don't start to think sensibly about these things.
p429
aa(lp430
VNow, we've offered this carrot,
p431
aVas I say, we've dangled the carrot.
p432
aVWe're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.
p433
aVOh, we get lots of them,
p434
aVhundreds of them every year come by.
p435
aVThese are dowsers and people
p436
aVwho think that they can talk to the dead as well,
p437
aVbut they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate
p438
aVtheir own so-called powers.
p439
aVThe professionals never come near us,
p440
aVexcept in that case of Sylvia Browne
p441
aVthat I told you about a moment ago.
p442
aVShe did accept and then backed away.
p443
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p444
aVI'm James Randi,
p445
aVand I'm waiting.
p446
aa(lp447
VThank you.

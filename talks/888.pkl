V[Sanskrit]
p7
aVThis is an ode to the mother goddess,
p8
aVthat most of us in India learn when we are children.
p9
aVI learned it when I was four
p10
aVat my mother's knee.
p11
aVThat year she introduced me to dance,
p12
aVand thus began
p13
aVmy tryst with classical dance.
p14
aVSince then \u2014 it's been four decades now \u2014
p15
aVI've trained with the best in the field,
p16
aVperformed across the globe,
p17
aVtaught young and old alike,
p18
aVcreated, collaborated,
p19
aVchoreographed,
p20
aVand wove a rich tapestry
p21
aVof artistry, achievement and awards.
p22
aVThe crowning glory was in 2007,
p23
aVwhen I received this country's
p24
aVfourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri,
p25
aVfor my contribution to art.
p26
aa(lp27

p28
aa(lp29
VBut nothing, nothing prepared me
p30
aVfor what I was to hear
p31
aVon the first of July 2008.
p32
aVI heard the word "carcinoma."
p33
aVYes, breast cancer.
p34
aVAs I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office,
p35
aVI heard other words:
p36
aV"cancer," "stage," "grade."
p37
aVUntil then, Cancer was the zodiac
p38
aVsign of my friend,
p39
aVstage was what I performed on,
p40
aVand grades were what I got in school.
p41
aVThat day, I realized
p42
aVI had an unwelcome, uninvited,
p43
aVnew life partner.
p44
aVAs a dancer,
p45
aVI know the nine rasas or the navarasas:
p46
aVanger, valor,
p47
aVdisgust, humor
p48
aVand fear.
p49
aVI thought I knew what fear was.
p50
aVThat day, I learned what fear was.
p51
aa(lp52
VOvercome with the enormity of it all
p53
aVand the complete feeling of loss of control,
p54
aVI shed copious tears
p55
aVand asked my dear husband, Jayant.
p56
aVI said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?
p57
aVIs this the end of my dance?"
p58
aVAnd he, the positive soul that he is,
p59
aVsaid, "No, this is just a hiatus,
p60
aVa hiatus during the treatment,
p61
aVand you'll get back to doing what you do best."
p62
aa(lp63
VI realized then
p64
aVthat I, who thought I had complete control of my life,
p65
aVhad control of only three things:
p66
aVMy thought, my mind \u2014
p67
aVthe images that these thoughts created \u2014
p68
aVand the action that derived from it.
p69
aVSo here I was wallowing
p70
aVin a vortex of emotions
p71
aVand depression and what have you,
p72
aVwith the enormity of the situation,
p73
aVwanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
p74
aVI wanted to go from where I was
p75
aVto where I wanted to be,
p76
aVfor which I needed something.
p77
aVI needed something that would pull me out of all this.
p78
aVSo I dried my tears,
p79
aVand I declared to the world at large ...
p80
aVI said, "Cancer's only one page in my life,
p81
aVand I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
p82
aa(lp83
VI also declared to the world at large
p84
aVthat I would ride it out,
p85
aVand I would not allow cancer to ride me.
p86
aVBut to go from where I was
p87
aVto where I wanted to be,
p88
aVI needed something.
p89
aVI needed an anchor, an image,
p90
aVa peg
p91
aVto peg this process on,
p92
aVso that I could go from there.
p93
aVAnd I found that in my dance,
p94
aVmy dance, my strength, my energy, my passion,
p95
aVmy very life breath.
p96
aVBut it wasn't easy.
p97
aVBelieve me, it definitely wasn't easy.
p98
aVHow do you keep cheer
p99
aVwhen you go from beautiful
p100
aVto bald in three days?
p101
aVHow do you not despair
p102
aVwhen, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy,
p103
aVclimbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture,
p104
aVthat to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
p105
aVHow do you not get overwhelmed
p106
aVby the despair and the misery of it all?
p107
aVAll I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
p108
aVBut I kept telling myself fear and tears
p109
aVare options I did not have.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I would drag myself into my dance studio \u2014
p112
aVbody, mind and spirit \u2014 every day into my dance studio,
p113
aVand learn everything I learned
p114
aVwhen I was four, all over again,
p115
aVreworked, relearned, regrouped.
p116
aVIt was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
p117
aVDifficult.
p118
aVI focused on my mudras,
p119
aVon the imagery of my dance,
p120
aVon the poetry and the metaphor
p121
aVand the philosophy of the dance itself.
p122
aVAnd slowly, I moved out
p123
aVof that miserable state of mind.
p124
aa(lp125
VBut I needed something else.
p126
aVI needed something to go that extra mile,
p127
aVand I found it in that metaphor
p128
aVwhich I had learned from my mother when I was four.
p129
aVThe metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini,
p130
aVof Durga.
p131
aVDurga, the mother goddess, the fearless one,
p132
aVcreated by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
p133
aVDurga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful,
p134
aVher 18 arms
p135
aVready for warfare,
p136
aVas she rode astride her lion
p137
aVinto the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
p138
aVDurga, the epitome
p139
aVof creative feminine energy,
p140
aVor shakti.
p141
aVDurga, the fearless one.
p142
aVI made that image of Durga
p143
aVand her every attribute, her every nuance,
p144
aVmy very own.
p145
aa(lp146
VPowered by the symbology of a myth
p147
aVand the passion of my training,
p148
aVI brought laser-sharp focus into my dance,
p149
aVlaser-sharp focus to such an extent
p150
aVthat I danced a few weeks after surgery.
p151
aVI danced through chemo and radiation cycles,
p152
aVmuch to the dismay of my oncologist.
p153
aVI danced between chemo and radiation cycles
p154
aVand badgered him to fit it
p155
aVto my performing dance schedule.
p156
aVWhat I had done
p157
aVis I had tuned out of cancer
p158
aVand tuned into my dance.
p159
aVYes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
p160
aa(lp161
VMy story
p162
aVis a story of overcoming setbacks,
p163
aVobstacles and challenges
p164
aVthat life throws at you.
p165
aVMy story is the power of thought.
p166
aVMy story is the power of choice.
p167
aVIt's the power of focus.
p168
aVIt's the power of bringing ourselves
p169
aVto the attention of something that so animates you,
p170
aVso moves you,
p171
aVthat something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
p172
aVMy story is the power of a metaphor.
p173
aVIt's the power of an image.
p174
aVMine was that of Durga,
p175
aVDurga the fearless one.
p176
aVShe was also called Simhanandini,
p177
aVthe one who rode the lion.
p178
aa(lp179
VAs I ride out,
p180
aVas I ride my own inner strength,
p181
aVmy own inner resilience,
p182
aVarmed as I am with what medication can provide
p183
aVand continue treatment,
p184
aVas I ride out into the battlefield of cancer,
p185
aVasking my rogue cells to behave,
p186
aVI want to be known not as a cancer survivor,
p187
aVbut as a cancer conqueror.
p188
aa(lp189
VI present to you an excerpt of that work
p190
aV"Simhanandini."

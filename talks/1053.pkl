VSo I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys,
p5
aVand it's a serious problem with boys.
p6
aVTheir culture isn't working in schools,
p7
aVand I'm going to share with you ways
p8
aVthat we can think about overcoming that problem.
p9
aVFirst, I want to start by saying, this is a boy,
p10
aVand this is a girl,
p11
aVand this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl.
p12
aVIf I essentialize gender for you today, then you can dismiss what I have to say.
p13
aVSo I'm not going to do that, I'm not interested in doing that.
p14
aVThis is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl.
p15
aVSo the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries
p16
aVof what we think of as boys and girls,
p17
aVand not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries
p18
aVof what we think of as girls.
p19
aVBut, in fact, most boys tend to be a certain way,
p20
aVand most girls tend to be a certain way.
p21
aVAnd the point is that, for boys,
p22
aVthe way that they exist and the culture that they embrace
p23
aVisn't working well in schools now.
p24
aa(lp25
VHow do we know that?
p26
aVThe 100 girls project tells us some really nice statistics.
p27
aVFor example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school,
p28
aVthere are 250 boys that are suspended from school.
p29
aVFor every 100 girls who are expelled from school,
p30
aVthere are 335 boys who are expelled from school.
p31
aVFor every 100 girls in special education,
p32
aVthere are 217 boys.
p33
aVFor every 100 girls with a learning disability,
p34
aVthere are 276 boys.
p35
aVFor every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed,
p36
aVwe have 324 boys.
p37
aVAnd by the way, all of these numbers are significantly higher
p38
aVif you happen to be black,
p39
aVif you happen to be poor,
p40
aVif you happen to exist in an overcrowded school.
p41
aVAnd if you are a boy,
p42
aVyou're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD \u2014
p43
aVAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow there is another side to this.
p46
aVAnd it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school,
p47
aVthat salaries are still significantly lower,
p48
aVeven when controlled for job types,
p49
aVand that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years.
p50
aVThat's all true.
p51
aVNothing about that prevents us
p52
aVfrom paying attention to the literacy needs
p53
aVof our boys between ages three and 13.
p54
aVAnd so we should.
p55
aVIn fact, what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook,
p56
aVbecause the initiatives and programs that have been set in place
p57
aVfor women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic.
p58
aVThey've done a lot of good for girls in these situations,
p59
aVand we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too
p60
aVin their younger years.
p61
aa(lp62
VEven in their older years,
p63
aVwhat we find is that there's still a problem.
p64
aVWhen we look at the universities,
p65
aV60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now,
p66
aVwhich is a significant shift.
p67
aVAnd in fact, university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea
p68
aVthat we may be getting close to 70 percent female population in universities.
p69
aVThis makes university administrators very nervous,
p70
aVbecause girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys.
p71
aVAnd so we're starting to see
p72
aVthe establishment of men centers and men studies
p73
aVto think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university.
p74
aVIf you talk to faculty, they may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well,
p75
aVthey're playing video games,
p76
aVand they're gambling online all night long,
p77
aVand they're playing World of Warcraft,
p78
aVand that's affecting their academic achievement."
p79
aVGuess what?
p80
aVVideo games are not the cause.
p81
aVVideo games are a symptom.
p82
aVThey were turned off a long time before they got here.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo let's talk about why they got turned off
p85
aVwhen they were between the ages of three and 13.
p86
aVThere are three reasons that I believe
p87
aVthat boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today.
p88
aVThe first is zero tolerance.
p89
aVA kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her,
p90
aVand when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns.
p91
aVYou can't have plastic knives and swords and axes
p92
aVand all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom.
p93
aVWhat is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun?
p94
aVI mean, really.
p95
aVBut here he stands as testament
p96
aVto the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today.
p97
aVNow I'm not advocating for bullies.
p98
aVI'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives in the school.
p99
aVBut when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom
p100
aVwho has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it,
p101
aVhas to be suspended from school,
p102
aVI think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnother way that zero tolerance lives itself out
p105
aVis in the writing of boys.
p106
aVIn a lot of classrooms today,
p107
aVyou're not allowed to write about anything that's violent.
p108
aVYou're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games.
p109
aVThese topics are banned.
p110
aVBoy comes home from school, and he says,
p111
aV"I hate writing."
p112
aV"Why do you hate writing, son? What's wrong with writing?"
p113
aV"Now I have to write what she tells me to write."
p114
aV"OK, what is she telling you to write?"
p115
aV"Poems. I have to write poems.
p116
aVAnd little moments in my life.
p117
aVI don't want to write that stuff."
p118
aV"Well, what do you want to write?
p119
aVWhat do you want to write about?"
p120
aV"I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling-up.
p121
aVI want to write about this really interesting world.
p122
aVI want to write about a tornado that comes into our house
p123
aVand blows all the windows out,
p124
aVand ruins all the furniture and kills everybody."
p125
aV"All right. OK."
p126
aVYou tell a teacher that, and they'll ask you, in all seriousness,
p127
aV"Should we send this child to the psychologist?"
p128
aVAnd the answer is no, he's just a boy.
p129
aVHe's just a little boy.
p130
aVIt's not OK to write these kinds of things in classrooms today.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo that's the first reason:
p133
aVZero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out.
p134
aVThe next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures:
p135
aVthere are fewer male teachers.
p136
aVAnybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means,
p137
aVbecause in the last 10 years,
p138
aVthe number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half.
p139
aVWe went from 14 percent to seven percent.
p140
aVThat means that 93 percent of the teachers
p141
aVthat our young men get in elementary classrooms are women.
p142
aVNow what's the problem with this?
p143
aVWomen are great, yep, absolutely.
p144
aVBut male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart \u2014
p145
aVthey've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders,
p146
aVbut ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week
p147
aVthey're spending in a classroom,
p148
aVand most of those classrooms are not places where men exist.
p149
aVAnd so they say, I guess this really isn't a place for boys.
p150
aVThis is a place for girls.
p151
aVAnd I'm not very good at this,
p152
aVso I guess I'd better go play video games
p153
aVor get into sports, or something like that,
p154
aVbecause I obviously don't belong here.
p155
aVMen don't belong here, that's pretty obvious.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo that may be a very direct way that we see it happen.
p158
aVBut less directly, the lack of male presence in the culture \u2014
p159
aVyou've got a teachers' lounge, and they're having a conversation
p160
aVabout Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground.
p161
aV"What are we going to do with these boys?"
p162
aVThe answer to that question changes
p163
aVdepending on who's sitting around that table.
p164
aVAre there men around that table?
p165
aVAre there moms who've raised boys around that table?
p166
aVYou'll see, the conversation changes
p167
aVdepending upon who's sitting around the table.
p168
aa(lp169
VThird reason that boys are out of sync with school today:
p170
aVKindergarten is the old second grade, folks.
p171
aVWe have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there.
p172
aVWhen you're three, you better be able to write your name legibly,
p173
aVor else we'll consider it a developmental delay.
p174
aVBy the time you're in first grade,
p175
aVyou should be able to read paragraphs of text
p176
aVwith maybe a picture, maybe not, in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.
p177
aVIf you don't,
p178
aVwe're probably going to be putting you into a Title I special reading program.
p179
aVAnd if you ask Title I teachers, they'll tell you
p180
aVthey've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program,
p181
aVin the elementary grades.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe reason that this is a problem
p184
aVis because the message that boys are getting
p185
aVis, "You need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time."
p186
aVThe teacher's salary depends on "No Child Left Behind"
p187
aVand "Race to the Top" and accountability and testing
p188
aVand all of this.
p189
aVSo she has to figure out a way to get all these boys
p190
aVthrough this curriculum \u2014 and girls.
p191
aVThis compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids.
p192
aVAnd what happens is,
p193
aVshe says, "Please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told,
p194
aVfollow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl."
p195
aVThat's what she tells them.
p196
aVIndirectly, that's what she tells them.
p197
aVAnd so this is a very serious problem.
p198
aVWhere is it coming from? It's coming from us.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VWe want our babies to read when they are six months old.
p203
aVHave you seen the ads?
p204
aVWe want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average ...
p205
aVbut what this does to our children is really not healthy.
p206
aVIt's not developmentally appropriate,
p207
aVand it's particularly bad for boys.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo what do we do?
p210
aVWe need to meet them where they are.
p211
aVWe need to put ourselves into boy culture.
p212
aVWe need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys
p213
aVin elementary schools.
p214
aVMore specifically, we can do some very specific things.
p215
aVWe can design better games.
p216
aVMost of the educational games that are out there today
p217
aVare really flashcards.
p218
aVThey're glorified drill and practice.
p219
aVThey don't have the depth, the rich narrative
p220
aVthat really engaging video games have,
p221
aVthat the boys are really interested in.
p222
aVSo we need to design better games.
p223
aVWe need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians.
p224
aVWe need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom.
p225
aVWe need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies.
p226
aVDo they make sense?
p227
aVWe need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can,
p228
aVtrying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them.
p229
aVAll of those conversations need to be happening.
p230
aa(lp231
VThere are some great examples out there of schools \u2014
p232
aVthe New York Times just talked about a school recently.
p233
aVA game designer from the New School
p234
aVput together a wonderful video gaming school.
p235
aVBut it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable.
p236
aVWe have to change the culture and the feelings
p237
aVthat politicians and school board members and parents have
p238
aVabout the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today.
p239
aVWe need to find more money for game design.
p240
aVBecause good games, really good games, cost money,
p241
aVand World of Warcraft has quite a budget.
p242
aVMost of the educational games do not.
p243
aa(lp244
VWhere we started:
p245
aVmy colleagues Mike Petner, Shawn Vashaw, myself,
p246
aVwe started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes
p247
aVand find out how do they really feel about gaming,
p248
aVwhat do they say about it.
p249
aVAnd we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school,
p250
aVwho talk about gaming, in pretty demeaning ways.
p251
aVThey say, "Oh, yeah. They're always talking about that stuff.
p252
aVThey're talking about their little action figures
p253
aVand their little achievements or merit badges,
p254
aVor whatever it is that they get.
p255
aVAnd they're always talking about this stuff."
p256
aVAnd they say these things as if it's OK.
p257
aVBut if it were your culture, think of how that might feel.
p258
aVIt's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end
p259
aVof that kind of language.
p260
aVThey're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence
p261
aVbecause of the zero tolerance policies.
p262
aVThey are sure that parents and administrators
p263
aVwill never accept anything.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes
p266
aVand finding ways to change the attitudes,
p267
aVso that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures
p268
aVin their classrooms.
p269
aVBecause, ultimately, if we don't,
p270
aVthen we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying,
p271
aV"Well I guess that was just a place for girls, it wasn't for me.
p272
aVSo I've got to do gaming, or I've got to do sports."
p273
aVIf we change these things, if we pay attention to these things,
p274
aVand we reengage boys in their learning,
p275
aVthey will leave the elementary schools saying, "I'm smart."
p276
aa(lp277
VThank you.

VSo imagine, you're in the supermarket,
p5
aVyou're buying some groceries,
p6
aVand you get given the option
p7
aVfor a plastic or a paper shopping bag.
p8
aVWhich one do you choose if you want to do
p9
aVthe right thing by the environment?
p10
aa(lp11
VMost people do pick the paper.
p12
aVOkay, let's think of why.
p13
aVIt's brown to start with.
p14
aVTherefore, it must be good for the environment.
p15
aVIt's biodegradable. It's reusable.
p16
aVIn some cases, it's recyclable.
p17
aVSo when people are looking at the plastic bag,
p18
aVit's likely they're thinking of something like this,
p19
aVwhich we all know is absolutely terrible,
p20
aVand we should be avoiding at all expenses
p21
aVthese kinds of environmental damages.
p22
aVBut people are often not thinking
p23
aVof something like this,
p24
aVwhich is the other end of the spectrum.
p25
aVWhen we produce materials,
p26
aVwe need to extract them from the environment,
p27
aVand we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts.
p28
aa(lp29
VYou see, what happens is, when we need
p30
aVto make complex choices,
p31
aVus humans like really simple solutions,
p32
aVand so we often ask for simple solutions.
p33
aVAnd I work in design.
p34
aVI advise designers
p35
aVand innovators around sustainability,
p36
aVand everyone always says to me, "Oh Leyla,
p37
aVI just want the eco-materials."
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd I say, "Well, that's very complex,
p40
aVand we'll have to spend four hours talking about
p41
aVwhat exactly an eco-material means,
p42
aVbecause everything at some point
p43
aVcomes from nature,
p44
aVand it's how you use the material
p45
aVthat dictates the environmental impact.
p46
aVSo what happens is, we have to rely
p47
aVon some sort of intuitive framework
p48
aVwhen we make decisions.
p49
aVSo I like to call that intuitive framework
p50
aVour environmental folklore.
p51
aVIt's either the little voice at the back of your head,
p52
aVor it's that gut feeling you get
p53
aVwhen you've done the right thing,
p54
aVso when you've picked the paper bag
p55
aVor when you've bought a fuel-efficient car.
p56
aVAnd environmental folklore is a really important thing
p57
aVbecause we're trying to do the right thing.
p58
aVBut how do we know if we're actually
p59
aVreducing the net environmental impacts
p60
aVthat our actions as individuals and as professionals
p61
aVand as a society are actually having
p62
aVon the natural environment?
p63
aa(lp64
VSo the thing about environmental folklore is
p65
aVit tends to be based on our experiences,
p66
aVthe things we've heard from other people.
p67
aVIt doesn't tend to be based on any scientific framework.
p68
aVAnd this is really hard, because we live
p69
aVin incredibly complex systems.
p70
aVWe have the human systems
p71
aVof how we communicate and interrelate
p72
aVand have our whole constructed society,
p73
aVWe have the industrial systems, which is essentially the entire economy,
p74
aVand then all of that has to operate
p75
aVwithin the biggest system,
p76
aVand, I would argue, the most important,
p77
aVthe ecosystem.
p78
aVAnd you see, the choices that we make
p79
aVas an individual,
p80
aVbut the choices that we make
p81
aVin every single job that we have,
p82
aVno matter how high or low you are in the pecking order,
p83
aVhas an impact on all of these systems.
p84
aVAnd the thing is that we have to find ways
p85
aVif we're actually going to address sustainability
p86
aVof interlocking those complex systems
p87
aVand making better choices that result
p88
aVin net environmental gains.
p89
aVWhat we need to do is we need to learn
p90
aVto do more with less.
p91
aVWe have an increasing population,
p92
aVand everybody likes their mobile phones,
p93
aVespecially in this situation here.
p94
aVSo we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd that's where this process called life cycle thinking comes in.
p97
aVSo essentially, everything that is created
p98
aVgoes through a series of life cycle stages,
p99
aVand we use this scientific process
p100
aVcalled life cycle assessment,
p101
aVor in America, you guys say life cycle analysis,
p102
aVin order to have a clearer picture of how
p103
aVeverything that we do in the technical part of those systems
p104
aVaffects the natural environment.
p105
aVSo we go all the way back
p106
aVto the extraction of raw materials,
p107
aVand then we look at manufacturing,
p108
aVwe look at packaging and transportation,
p109
aVuse, and end of life,
p110
aVand at every single one of these stages,
p111
aVthe things that we do
p112
aVhave an interaction with the natural environment,
p113
aVand we can monitor how that interaction
p114
aVis actually affecting the systems and services
p115
aVthat make life on Earth possible.
p116
aVAnd through doing this,
p117
aVwe've learned some absolutely fascinating things.
p118
aVAnd we've busted a bunch of myths.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.
p121
aVIt's used a lot in marketing,
p122
aVand it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation
p123
aVwhen we're talking about sustainability,
p124
aVand that's the word biodegradability.
p125
aVNow biodegradability is a material property;
p126
aVit is not a definition of environmental benefits.
p127
aVAllow me to explain.
p128
aVWhen something natural,
p129
aVsomething that's made from a cellulose fiber
p130
aVlike a piece of bread, even, or any food waste,
p131
aVor even a piece of paper,
p132
aVwhen something natural ends up
p133
aVin the natural environment, it degrades normally.
p134
aVIts little carbon molecules that it stored up
p135
aVas it was growing are naturally released
p136
aVback into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,
p137
aVbut this is a net situation.
p138
aVMost natural things
p139
aVdon't actually end up in nature.
p140
aVMost of the things, the waste that  we produce, end up in landfill.
p141
aVLandfill is a different environment.
p142
aVIn landfill, those same carbon molecules
p143
aVdegrade in a different way,
p144
aVbecause a landfill is anaerobic.
p145
aVIt's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot.
p146
aVThose same molecules, they become methane,
p147
aVand methane is a 25 times more potent
p148
aVgreenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
p149
aVSo our old lettuces and products
p150
aVthat we have thrown out that are made
p151
aVout of biodegradable materials,
p152
aVif they end up in landfill,
p153
aVcontribute to climate change.
p154
aVYou see, there are facilities now
p155
aVthat can actually capture that methane
p156
aVand generate power,
p157
aVdisplacing the need for fossil fuel power,
p158
aVbut we need to be smart about this.
p159
aVWe need to identify how we can start to leverage
p160
aVthese types of things that are already happening
p161
aVand start to design systems and services
p162
aVthat alleviate these problems.
p163
aVBecause right now, what people do is they turn around and they say,
p164
aV"Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper
p165
aVbecause that is better for the environment."
p166
aVBut if you're throwing it in the bin,
p167
aVand your local landfill facility
p168
aVis just a normal one,
p169
aVthen we're having what's called a double negative.
p170
aa(lp171
VI'm a product designer by trade.
p172
aVI then did social science.
p173
aVAnd so I'm absolutely fascinated
p174
aVby consumer goods and how the consumer goods
p175
aVthat we have kind of become immune to
p176
aVthat fill our lives
p177
aVhave an impact on the natural environment.
p178
aVAnd these guys are, like, serial offenders,
p179
aVand I'm pretty sure everyone in this room
p180
aVhas a refrigerator.
p181
aVNow America has this amazing ability
p182
aVto keep growing refrigerators.
p183
aVIn the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot
p184
aVon average, the standard size
p185
aVof a refrigerator.
p186
aVAnd the problem is, they're so big now,
p187
aVit's easier for us to buy more food
p188
aVthat we can't eat or find.
p189
aVI mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator
p190
aVthat have been there for years, all right?
p191
aVAnd so what happens is, we waste more food.
p192
aVAnd as I was just explaining, food waste is a problem.
p193
aVIn fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent
p194
aVof food purchased for the home is wasted.
p195
aVHalf of the world's produced food is wasted.
p196
aVThat's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food.
p197
aVIt's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.
p198
aVAnd I blame it on the refrigerator,
p199
aVwell, especially in Western cultures,
p200
aVbecause it makes it easier.
p201
aVI mean, there's a lot of complex systems going on here.
p202
aVI don't want to make it so simplistic.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this,
p205
aVand one of the features of it
p206
aVis the crisper drawer.
p207
aVYou all got crisper drawers?
p208
aVThe drawer that you put your lettuces in?
p209
aVLettuces have a habit of going soggy
p210
aVin the crisper drawers, don't they?
p211
aVYeah? Soggy lettuces?
p212
aVIn the U.K., this is such a problem
p213
aVthat there was a government report a few years ago
p214
aVthat actually said the second biggest offender
p215
aVof wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce.
p216
aVIt was called the Soggy Lettuce Report.
p217
aVOkay? So this is a problem, people.
p218
aVThese poor little lettuces are getting thrown out
p219
aVleft, right and center because the crisper drawers
p220
aVare not designed to actually keep things crisp.
p221
aVOkay. You need a tight environment.
p222
aVYou need, like, an airless environment
p223
aVto prevent the degrading that would happen naturally.
p224
aVBut the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer
p225
aVwith a slightly better seal.
p226
aVAnyway, I'm clearly obsessed.
p227
aVDon't ever invite me over because I'll just start going through your refrigerator
p228
aVand looking at all sorts of things like that.
p229
aVBut essentially, this is a big problem.
p230
aVBecause when we lose something like the lettuce from the system,
p231
aVnot only do we have that impact  I just explained at the end of life,
p232
aVbut we actually have had to grow that lettuce.
p233
aVThe life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical.
p234
aVWe've had to clear land.
p235
aVWe've had to plant seeds, phosphorus,
p236
aVfertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight.
p237
aVAll of the embodied impacts in that lettuce
p238
aVget lost from the system,
p239
aVwhich makes it a far bigger environmental impact
p240
aVthan the loss of the energy from the fridge.
p241
aVSo we need to design things like this far better
p242
aVif we're going to start addressing serious environmental problems.
p243
aVWe could start with the crisper drawer and the size.
p244
aVFor those of you in the room who do design fridges,
p245
aVthat would be great.
p246
aa(lp247
VThe problem is, imagine if we
p248
aVactually started to reconsider  how we designed things.
p249
aVSo I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity,
p250
aVbut we actually haven't really changed the design
p251
aVof them that much since the 1950s.
p252
aVA little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes,
p253
aVcold boxes that we store stuff in.
p254
aVSo imagine if we actually really started
p255
aVto identify these problems and use that
p256
aVas the foundation for finding innovative and elegant
p257
aVdesign solutions that will solve those problems.
p258
aVThis is design-led system change,
p259
aVdesign dictating the way in which the system
p260
aVcan be far more sustainable.
p261
aVForty percent food waste is a major problem.
p262
aVImagine if we designed fridges that halved that.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnother item that I find fascinating
p265
aVis the electric tea kettle,
p266
aVwhich I found out that
p267
aVyou don't do tea kettles in this country, really, do you?
p268
aVBut that's really big in the U.K.
p269
aVNinety-seven percent of households
p270
aVin the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle.
p271
aVSo they're very popular.
p272
aVAnd, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm
p273
aVor a designer, and they were designing one of these,
p274
aVand they wanted to do it eco,
p275
aVthey'd usually ask me two things.
p276
aVThey'd say, "Leyla, how do I make it technically efficient?"
p277
aVBecause obviously energy's a problem with this product.
p278
aVOr, "How do I make it green materials?
p279
aVHow do I make the materials green
p280
aVin the manufacturing?"
p281
aVWould you ask me those questions?
p282
aVThey seem logical, right? Yeah.
p283
aVWell I'd say, "You're looking at the wrong problems."
p284
aVBecause the problem is with use.
p285
aVIt's with how people use the product.
p286
aVSixty-five percent of Brits
p287
aVadmit to over-filling their kettle
p288
aVwhen they only need one cup of tea.
p289
aVAll of this extra water that's being boiled
p290
aVrequires energy, and it's been calculated
p291
aVthat in one day of extra energy use
p292
aVfrom boiling kettles
p293
aVis enough to light all of the streetlights
p294
aVin England for a night.
p295
aa(lp296
VBut this is the thing.
p297
aVThis is what I call a product-person failure.
p298
aVBut we've got a product-system failure going on with these little guys,
p299
aVand they're so ubiquitous, you  don't even notice they're there.
p300
aVAnd this guy over here, though, he does. He's named Simon.
p301
aVSimon works for the national electricity company in the U.K.
p302
aVHe has a very important job of monitoring
p303
aVall of the electricity coming into the system
p304
aVto make sure there is enough
p305
aVso it powers everybody's homes.
p306
aVHe's also watching television.
p307
aVThe reason is because there's a unique
p308
aVphenomenon that happens in the U.K.
p309
aVthe moment that very popular TV shows end.
p310
aVThe minute the ad break comes on,
p311
aVthis man has to rush
p312
aVto buy nuclear power from France,
p313
aVbecause everybody turns their kettles on
p314
aVat the same time.
p315
aV(Laughter)
p316
aV1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.
p317
aVSo imagine if you designed kettles,
p318
aVyou actually found a way to solve these system failures,
p319
aVbecause this is a huge amount of pressure
p320
aVon the system,
p321
aVjust because the product hasn't thought about the problem
p322
aVthat it's going to have when it exists in the world.
p323
aVNow, I looked at a number of kettles available on the market,
p324
aVand found the minimum fill lines,
p325
aVso the little piece of information that tells you
p326
aVhow much you need to put in there,
p327
aVwas between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water
p328
aVjust to make one cup of tea.
p329
aVSo this kettle here is an example of one where
p330
aVit actually has two reservoirs.
p331
aVOne's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder.
p332
aVThe user actually has to push that button
p333
aVto get their hot water boiled,
p334
aVwhich means, because we're all lazy,
p335
aVyou only fill exactly what you need.
p336
aVAnd this is what I call behavior-changing products:
p337
aVproducts, systems or services
p338
aVthat intervene and solve these problems up front.
p339
aa(lp340
VNow, this is a technology arena,
p341
aVso obviously these things are quite popular,
p342
aVbut I think if we're going to keep
p343
aVdesigning, buying and using and throwing out
p344
aVthese kinds of products at the rate we currently do,
p345
aVwhich is astronomically high,
p346
aVthere are seven billion people
p347
aVwho live in the world right now.
p348
aVThere are six billion mobile phone subscriptions
p349
aVas of last year.
p350
aVEvery single year, 1.5 billion mobile phones
p351
aVroll off production lines,
p352
aVand some companies report their production rate
p353
aVas being greater than the human birth rate.
p354
aVOne hundred fifty-two million phones  were thrown out in the U.S. last year;
p355
aVonly 11 percent were recycled.
p356
aVI'm from Australia. We have a population of 22 million \u2014 don't laugh \u2014
p357
aVand it's been reported that 22 million phones
p358
aVare in people's drawers.
p359
aVWe need to find ways of solving the problems around this,
p360
aVbecause these things are so complicated.
p361
aVThey have so much locked up inside them.
p362
aVGold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now
p363
aVto get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones
p364
aVthan it is out of a ton of gold ore?
p365
aVThere's a number of highly complex and valuable
p366
aVmaterials embodied inside these things,
p367
aVso we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly,
p368
aVbecause this is otherwise what happens.
p369
aVThis is a community in Ghana,
p370
aVand e-waste is reported, or electronic waste
p371
aVis reported by the U.N.
p372
aVas being up to 50 million tons trafficked.
p373
aVThis is how they get the gold
p374
aVand the other valuable materials out.
p375
aVThey burn the electronic waste
p376
aVin open spaces.
p377
aVThese are communities, and this is happening all over the world.
p378
aVAnd because we don't see the ramifications
p379
aVof the choices that we make as designers,
p380
aVas businesspeople, as consumers,
p381
aVthen these kinds of externalities happen,
p382
aVand these are people's lives.
p383
aVSo we need to find smarter, more systems-based,
p384
aVinnovative solutions to these problems,
p385
aVif we're going to start to live sustainably within this world.
p386
aa(lp387
VSo imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone,
p388
aVyour new one because you replaced your old one \u2014
p389
aVafter 15 to 18 months is the average time
p390
aVthat people replace their phones, by the way \u2014
p391
aVso if we're going to keep this kind of expedient
p392
aVmobile phone replacing, then we should
p393
aVbe looking at closing the loop on these systems.
p394
aVThe people who produce these phones,
p395
aVand some of which I'm sure are in the room right now,
p396
aVcould potentially look at doing what we call closed-loop systems,
p397
aVor product system services,
p398
aVso identifying that there is a market demand
p399
aVand that market demand's not going to go anywhere,
p400
aVso you design the product to solve the problem.
p401
aVDesign for disassembly, design for light-weighting.
p402
aVWe heard some of those kinds of strategies
p403
aVbeing used in the Tesla Motors car today.
p404
aVThese kinds of approaches are not hard,
p405
aVbut understanding the system
p406
aVand then looking for viable, market-driven
p407
aVconsumer demand alternatives
p408
aVis how we can start radically altering
p409
aVthe sustainability agenda,
p410
aVbecause I hate to break it to you all:
p411
aVConsumption is the biggest problem.
p412
aVBut design is one of the best solutions.
p413
aa(lp414
VThese kinds of products are everywhere.
p415
aVBy identifying alternative ways of doing things,
p416
aVwe can actually start to innovate,
p417
aVand I say actually start to innovate.
p418
aVI'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative.
p419
aVBut in the regards to using sustainability
p420
aVas a parameter, as a criteria
p421
aVfor fueling systems-based solutions,
p422
aVbecause as I've just demonstrated with these simple products,
p423
aVthey're participating in these major problems.
p424
aVSo we need to look across the entire life
p425
aVof the things that we do.
p426
aa(lp427
VIf you just had paper or plastic \u2014
p428
aVobviously reusable is far more beneficial \u2014
p429
aVthen the paper is worse,
p430
aVand the paper is worse because it weighs
p431
aVfour to 10 times more than the plastic,
p432
aVand when we actually compare, from a life cycle perspective,
p433
aVa kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper,
p434
aVthe paper is far better,
p435
aVbut the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag
p436
aVto carry your groceries home is not  done with a kilo of each material.
p437
aVIt's done with a very small amount of plastic
p438
aVand quite a lot more paper.
p439
aVBecause functionality defines environmental impact,
p440
aVand I said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco-materials.
p441
aVI say, there's only a few materials that you should completely avoid.
p442
aVThe rest of them, it's all about application,
p443
aVand at the end of the day, everything we design and produce in the economy
p444
aVor buy as consumers is done so for function.
p445
aVWe want something, therefore we buy it.
p446
aVSo breaking things back down and delivering
p447
aVsmartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions
p448
aVthat take into consideration the entire system
p449
aVand the entire life of the thing, everything,
p450
aVall the way back to the extraction through to the end of life,
p451
aVwe can start to actually find really innovative solutions.
p452
aa(lp453
VAnd I'll just leave you with one very quick thing
p454
aVthat a designer said to me recently  who I work with, a senior designer.
p455

VSo let's start with some good news,
p5
aVand the good news has to do with what do we know
p6
aVbased on biomedical research
p7
aVthat actually has changed the outcomes
p8
aVfor many very serious diseases?
p9
aa(lp10
VLet's start with leukemia,
p11
aVacute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL,
p12
aVthe most common cancer of children.
p13
aVWhen I was a student,
p14
aVthe mortality rate was about 95 percent.
p15
aVToday, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about
p16
aVa mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent.
p17
aVSix thousand children each year
p18
aVwho would have previously died of this disease are cured.
p19
aVIf you want the really big numbers,
p20
aVlook at these numbers for heart disease.
p21
aVHeart disease used to be the biggest killer,
p22
aVparticularly for men in their 40s.
p23
aVToday, we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality
p24
aVfrom heart disease \u2014
p25
aVremarkably, 1.1 million deaths averted every year.
p26
aVAIDS, incredibly, has just been named,
p27
aVin the past month, a chronic disease,
p28
aVmeaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV
p29
aVis expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years,
p30
aVas we said only a decade ago,
p31
aVbut is thought to live decades,
p32
aVprobably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether.
p33
aVThese are just remarkable, remarkable changes
p34
aVin the outlook for some of the biggest killers.
p35
aVAnd one in particular
p36
aVthat you probably wouldn't know about, stroke,
p37
aVwhich has been, along with heart disease,
p38
aVone of the biggest killers in this country,
p39
aVis a disease in which now we know
p40
aVthat if you can get people into the emergency room
p41
aVwithin three hours of the onset,
p42
aVsome 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital
p43
aVwithout any disability whatsoever.
p44
aa(lp45
VRemarkable stories,
p46
aVgood-news stories,
p47
aVall of which boil down to understanding
p48
aVsomething about the diseases that has allowed us
p49
aVto detect early and intervene early.
p50
aVEarly detection, early intervention,
p51
aVthat's the story for these successes.
p52
aa(lp53
VUnfortunately, the news is not all good.
p54
aVLet's talk about one other story
p55
aVwhich has to do with suicide.
p56
aVNow this is, of course, not a disease, per se.
p57
aVIt's a condition, or it's a situation
p58
aVthat leads to mortality.
p59
aVWhat you may not realize is just how prevalent it is.
p60
aVThere are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States.
p61
aVThat means one about every 15 minutes.
p62
aVThird most common cause of death amongst people
p63
aVbetween the ages of 15 and 25.
p64
aVIt's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize
p65
aVthat this is twice as common as homicide
p66
aVand actually more common as a source of death
p67
aVthan traffic fatalities in this country.
p68
aVNow, when we talk about suicide,
p69
aVthere is also a medical contribution here,
p70
aVbecause 90 percent of suicides
p71
aVare related to a mental illness:
p72
aVdepression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
p73
aVanorexia, borderline personality. There's a long list
p74
aVof disorders that contribute,
p75
aVand as I mentioned before, often early in life.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut it's not just the mortality from these disorders.
p78
aVIt's also morbidity.
p79
aVIf you look at disability,
p80
aVas measured by the World Health Organization
p81
aVwith something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years,
p82
aVit's kind of a metric that nobody would think of
p83
aVexcept an economist,
p84
aVexcept it's one way of trying to capture what is lost
p85
aVin terms of disability from medical causes,
p86
aVand as you can see, virtually 30 percent
p87
aVof all disability from all medical causes
p88
aVcan be attributed to mental disorders,
p89
aVneuropsychiatric syndromes.
p90
aa(lp91
VYou're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense.
p92
aVI mean, cancer seems far more serious.
p93
aVHeart disease seems far more serious.
p94
aVBut you can see actually they are further down this list,
p95
aVand that's because we're talking here about disability.
p96
aVWhat drives the disability for these disorders
p97
aVlike schizophrenia and bipolar and depression?
p98
aVWhy are they number one here?
p99
aa(lp100
VWell, there are probably three reasons.
p101
aVOne is that they're highly prevalent.
p102
aVAbout one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders
p103
aVin the course of their lifetime.
p104
aVA second, of course, is that, for some people,
p105
aVthese become truly disabling,
p106
aVand it's about four to five percent, perhaps one in 20.
p107
aVBut what really drives these numbers, this high morbidity,
p108
aVand to some extent the high mortality,
p109
aVis the fact that these start very early in life.
p110
aVFifty percent will have onset by age 14,
p111
aV75 percent by age 24,
p112
aVa picture that is very different than what one would see
p113
aVif you're talking about cancer or heart disease,
p114
aVdiabetes, hypertension \u2014 most of the major illnesses
p115
aVthat we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality.
p116
aVThese are, indeed, the chronic disorders of young people.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories.
p119
aVThis is obviously not one of them.
p120
aVThis is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult,
p121
aVand in a sense this is a kind of confession for me.
p122
aVMy job is to actually make sure that we make progress
p123
aVon all of these disorders.
p124
aVI work for the federal government.
p125
aVActually, I work for you. You pay my salary.
p126
aVAnd maybe at this point, when you know what I do,
p127
aVor maybe what I've failed to do,
p128
aVyou'll think that I probably ought to be fired,
p129
aVand I could certainly understand that.
p130
aVBut what I want to suggest, and the reason I'm here
p131
aVis to tell you that I think we're about to be
p132
aVin a very different world as we think about these illnesses.
p133
aa(lp134
VWhat I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders,
p135
aVdiseases of the mind.
p136
aVThat's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days,
p137
aVand people feel that, for whatever reason,
p138
aVit's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders
p139
aVand to talk about these as disorders of behavior.
p140
aVFair enough. They are disorders of behavior,
p141
aVand they are disorders of the mind.
p142
aVBut what I want to suggest to you
p143
aVis that both of those terms,
p144
aVwhich have been in play for a century or more,
p145
aVare actually now impediments to progress,
p146
aVthat what we need conceptually to make progress here
p147
aVis to rethink these disorders as brain disorders.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, for some of you, you're going to say,
p150
aV"Oh my goodness, here we go again.
p151
aVWe're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance
p152
aVor we're going to hear about drugs
p153
aVor we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion
p154
aVthat will take our subjective experience
p155
aVand turn it into molecules, or maybe into some sort of
p156
aVvery flat, unidimensional understanding
p157
aVof what it is to have depression or schizophrenia.
p158
aa(lp159
VWhen we talk about the brain, it is anything but
p160
aVunidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic.
p161
aVIt depends, of course, on what scale
p162
aVor what scope you want to think about,
p163
aVbut this is an organ of surreal complexity,
p164
aVand we are just beginning to understand
p165
aVhow to even study it, whether you're thinking about
p166
aVthe 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex
p167
aVor the 100 trillion synapses
p168
aVthat make up all the connections.
p169
aVWe have just begun to try to figure out
p170
aVhow do we take this very complex machine
p171
aVthat does extraordinary kinds of information processing
p172
aVand use our own minds to understand
p173
aVthis very complex brain that supports our own minds.
p174
aVIt's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution
p175
aVthat we simply don't have a brain
p176
aVthat seems to be wired well enough to understand itself.
p177
aVIn a sense, it actually makes you feel that
p178
aVwhen you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition,
p179
aVsomething you can observe,
p180
aVthat in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic
p181
aVthan trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ
p182
aVthat we're beginning to try to understand.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, already in the case of the brain disorders
p185
aVthat I've been talking to you about,
p186
aVdepression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
p187
aVpost-traumatic stress disorder,
p188
aVwhile we don't have an in-depth understanding
p189
aVof how they are abnormally processed
p190
aVor what the brain is doing in these illnesses,
p191
aVwe have been able to already identify
p192
aVsome of the connectional differences, or some of the ways
p193
aVin which the circuitry is different
p194
aVfor people who have these disorders.
p195
aVWe call this the human connectome,
p196
aVand you can think about the connectome
p197
aVsort of as the wiring diagram of the brain.
p198
aVYou'll hear more about this in a few minutes.
p199
aVThe important piece here is that as you begin to look
p200
aVat people who have these disorders, the one in five of us
p201
aVwho struggle in some way,
p202
aVyou find that there's a lot of variation
p203
aVin the way that the brain is wired,
p204
aVbut there are some predictable patterns, and those patterns
p205
aVare risk factors for developing one of these disorders.
p206
aVIt's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders
p207
aVlike Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease
p208
aVwhere you have a bombed-out part of your cortex.
p209
aVHere we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours,
p210
aVor sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected
p211
aVand the way that the brain functions.
p212
aVYou could, if you want, compare this to,
p213
aVon the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack,
p214
aVwhere you have dead tissue in the heart,
p215
aVversus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning
p216
aVbecause of the communication problems within it.
p217
aVEither one would kill you; in only one of them
p218
aVwill you find a major lesion.
p219
aa(lp220
VAs we think about this, probably it's better to actually go
p221
aVa little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia,
p222
aVbecause I think that's a good case
p223
aVfor helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters.
p224
aVThese are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues
p225
aVat the National Institute of Mental Health
p226
aVin which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia,
p227
aVand you can see already in the top
p228
aVthere's areas that are red or orange, yellow,
p229
aVare places where there's less gray matter,
p230
aVand as they followed them over five years,
p231
aVcomparing them to age match controls,
p232
aVyou can see that, particularly in areas like
p233
aVthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
p234
aVor the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter.
p235
aVAnd it's important, if you try to model this,
p236
aVyou can think about normal development
p237
aVas a loss of cortical mass, loss of cortical gray matter,
p238
aVand what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark,
p239
aVand at some point, when you overshoot,
p240
aVyou cross a threshold, and it's that threshold
p241
aVwhere we say, this is a person who has this disease,
p242
aVbecause they have the behavioral symptoms
p243
aVof hallucinations and delusions.
p244
aVThat's something we can observe.
p245
aVBut look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold.
p246
aVThey've crossed a brain threshold much earlier,
p247
aVthat perhaps not at age 22 or 20,
p248
aVbut even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see
p249
aVthe trajectory for development is quite different
p250
aVat the level of the brain, not at the level of behavior.
p251
aa(lp252
VWhy does this matter? Well first because,
p253
aVfor brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change.
p254
aVWe know that for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for Huntington's.
p255
aVThere are changes in the brain a decade or more
p256
aVbefore you see the first signs of a behavioral change.
p257
aVThe tools that we have now allow us to detect
p258
aVthese brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge.
p259
aVBut most important, go back to where we started.
p260
aVThe good-news stories in medicine
p261
aVare early detection, early intervention.
p262
aVIf we waited until the heart attack,
p263
aVwe would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives
p264
aVevery year in this country to heart disease.
p265
aVThat is precisely what we do today
p266
aVwhen we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders,
p267
aVbrain circuit disorders, has a behavioral disorder.
p268
aVWe wait until the behavior becomes manifest.
p269
aVThat's not early detection. That's not early intervention.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow to be clear, we're not quite ready to do this.
p272
aVWe don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know
p273
aVwhat the tools will be,
p274
aVnor what to precisely look for in every case to be able
p275
aVto get there before the behavior emerges as different.
p276
aVBut this tells us how we need to think about it,
p277
aVand where we need to go.
p278
aa(lp279
VAre we going to be there soon?
p280
aVI think that this is something that will happen
p281
aVover the course of the next few years, but I'd like to finish
p282
aVwith a quote about trying to predict how this will happen
p283
aVby somebody who's thought a lot about changes
p284
aVin concepts and changes in technology.
p285
aa(lp286
V"We always overestimate the change that will occur
p287
aVin the next two years and underestimate
p288
aVthe change that will occur in the next 10." \u2014 Bill Gates.
p289
aa(lp290
VThanks very much.

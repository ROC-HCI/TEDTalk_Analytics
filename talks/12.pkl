VThank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here
p5
aVspending my last day as a teenager.
p6
aVToday I want to talk to you about the future, but
p7
aVfirst I'm going to tell you a bit about the past.
p8
aVMy story starts way before I was born.
p9
aVMy grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.
p10
aVAnd she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.
p11
aVAnd somehow \u2014 we don't really know exactly the whole story \u2014 but
p12
aVthe train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp.
p13
aVMy grandmother survived and married my grandfather.
p14
aVThey were living in Hungary, and my mother was born.
p15
aVAnd when my mother was two years old,
p16
aVthe Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary.
p17
aVThey got on a boat, and yet another divergence \u2014
p18
aVthe boat was either going to Canada or to Australia.
p19
aVThey got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada.
p20
aVSo, to make a long story short, they came to Canada.
p21
aVMy grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto,
p22
aVand at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother,
p23
aVbut I carry on her name \u2014 her exact name, Eva Vertes \u2014
p24
aVand I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.
p25
aa(lp26
VI found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.
p27
aVMy family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.
p28
aVAnd I had never been a reader when I was young \u2014
p29
aVmy dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew;
p30
aVI tried all that \u2014 and I just didn't like reading books.
p31
aVAnd my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon
p32
aVcalled "The Hot Zone." It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus.
p33
aVAnd something about it just kind of drew me towards it.
p34
aVThere was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover,
p35
aVand I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book,
p36
aVand as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon
p37
aVto Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey,
p38
aVI read that book, and from when I was reading that book,
p39
aVI knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine.
p40
aVI wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book,
p41
aVwho went into the jungles of Africa,
p42
aVwent into the research labs and just tried to figure out
p43
aVwhat this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book
p44
aVI could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much.
p45
aVI was a passive observer of the medical world.
p46
aa(lp47
VIt wasn't until I entered high school that I thought,
p48
aV"Maybe now, you know \u2014 being a big high school kid \u2014
p49
aVI can maybe become an active part of this big medical world."
p50
aVI was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university
p51
aVto see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded.
p52
aVBut I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?
p53
aVAnd I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs,
p54
aVwho accepted me into the lab.
p55
aVAt that time, I was really interested in neuroscience
p56
aVand wanted to do a research project in neurology \u2014
p57
aVspecifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system.
p58
aVSo I started that, and worked in his lab for a year,
p59
aVand found the results that I guess you'd expect to find
p60
aVwhen you feed fruit flies heavy metals \u2014 that it really, really impaired the nervous system.
p61
aVThe spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way.
p62
aVAnd from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's
p65
aVand tried to familiarize myself with the research,
p66
aVand at the same time when I was in the \u2014
p67
aVI was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article
p68
aVabout something called "purine derivatives."
p69
aVAnd they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties.
p70
aVAnd being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought,
p71
aV"Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's
p72
aVwhich is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound \u2014
p73
aVpurine derivatives \u2014 that are promoting cell growth."
p74
aVAnd so I thought, "Maybe if it can promote cell growth,
p75
aVit can inhibit cell death, too."
p76
aVAnd so that's the project that I pursued for that year,
p77
aVand it's continuing now as well,
p78
aVand found that a specific purine derivative called "guanidine"
p79
aVhad inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent.
p80
aVSo I presented those results at the International Science Fair,
p81
aVwhich was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.
p82
aVAnd there I was awarded "Best in the World in Medicine,"
p83
aVwhich allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world,
p86
aVI wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.
p87
aVAnd I stumbled across something called "cancer stem cells."
p88
aVAnd this is really what I want to talk to you about today \u2014 about cancer.
p89
aVAt first when I heard of cancer stem cells,
p90
aVI didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells,
p91
aVand I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future \u2014
p92
aVthe therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps.
p93
aVBut I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time,
p94
aVso how did the good and bad go together?
p95
aVLast summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.
p96
aVAnd while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature,
p97
aVtrying to \u2014 again \u2014 familiarize myself with this new medical field.
p98
aVAnd it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell.
p99
aVThis fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently
p100
aVand almost became less fearful of it.
p101
aa(lp102
VIt seems that cancer is a direct result to injury.
p103
aVIf you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.
p104
aVIf you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.
p105
aVAnd it was really interesting \u2014 there were articles correlating
p106
aVif you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.
p107
aVBecause what stem cells are \u2014 they're these
p108
aVphenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate
p109
aVinto any type of tissue.
p110
aVSo, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ
p111
aVand then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.
p112
aVAnd the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged,
p113
aVwe need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung
p114
aVtrying to repair \u2014 because you have this excessive proliferation
p115
aVof these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.
p116
aVBut it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response,
p117
aVbut can't quite control it.
p118
aVIt hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.
p119
aVSo this really, really fascinated me.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd I really think that we can't think about cancer \u2014
p122
aVlet alone any disease \u2014 in such black-and-white terms.
p123
aVIf we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation,
p124
aVwe're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.
p125
aVIt's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.
p126
aVWe're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage
p127
aVthat the body has tried to fix.
p128
aVShouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination?
p129
aVIf somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate \u2014
p130
aVto become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue,
p131
aVwhatever that cancer has been put there to do \u2014
p132
aVit would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer.
p133
aVSo, this really changed my view of looking at cancer.
p134
aVAnd while I was reading all these articles about cancer,
p135
aVit seemed that the articles \u2014 a lot of them \u2014 focused on, you know,
p136
aVthe genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis
p137
aVand the progression of breast cancer \u2014
p138
aVtracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart,
p141
aVor cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.
p142
aVAnd skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body,
p143
aVor over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought,
p144
aV"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation
p145
aVwhy skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer \u2014 at least not that I know of."
p146
aVSo, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could,
p147
aVand it was amazing \u2014 because it turned out that it was very rare.
p148
aVSome articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue
p149
aVis resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer,
p150
aVbut of metastases going to skeletal muscle.
p151
aVAnd what metastases are is when the tumor \u2014
p152
aVwhen a piece \u2014 breaks off and travels through the blood stream
p153
aVand goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.
p154
aVIt's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.
p155
aVIf cancer was localized, we could likely remove it,
p156
aVor somehow \u2014 you know, it's contained. It's very contained.
p157
aVBut once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.
p158
aVSo the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles,
p159
aVbut cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle \u2014
p160
aVthere seemed to be something here.
p161
aVSo these articles were saying, you know, "Skeletal \u2014
p162
aVmetastasis to skeletal muscle \u2014 is very rare."
p163
aVBut it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo I decided to ask why. At first \u2014 the first thing I did
p166
aVwas I emailed some professors who
p167
aVspecialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said,
p168
aV"Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle.
p169
aVIs there a reason for this?" And a lot of the replies I got were that
p170
aVmuscle is terminally differentiated tissue.
p171
aVMeaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing,
p172
aVso it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.
p173
aVBut then again, this fact that the metastases
p174
aVdidn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.
p175
aVAnd furthermore, that nervous tissue \u2014 brain \u2014 gets cancer,
p176
aVand brain cells are also terminally differentiated.
p177
aVSo I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses
p178
aVthat I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.
p179
aVAnd I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.
p180
aVBut I know that in science, once you get the answers,
p181
aVinevitably you're going to have more questions.
p182
aVSo I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.
p183
aa(lp184
VSome of my hypotheses are that
p185
aVwhen you first think about skeletal muscle,
p186
aVthere's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.
p187
aVAnd the first thing that makes me think is that
p188
aVblood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.
p189
aVTumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.
p190
aVAnd you think, the more highways there are in a tissue,
p191
aVthe more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.
p192
aVSo first of all I thought, you know, "Wouldn't it be favorable
p193
aVto cancer getting to skeletal muscle?" And as well,
p194
aVcancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis,
p195
aVwhich is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself
p196
aVto supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.
p197
aVWithout angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.
p198
aVSo angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd one article that really stood out to me
p201
aVwhen I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal
p202
aVmuscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases
p203
aVto skeletal muscle upon autopsy.
p204
aV16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle,
p205
aVbut only .16 percent of actual metastases \u2014
p206
aVsuggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis,
p207
aVis able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.
p208
aVWe use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body \u2014
p209
aVour heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.
p210
aVIs it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows
p211
aVthat it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting,
p212
aVso therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.
p213
aVTherefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue,
p214
aVit can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor
p217
aVin skeletal muscle \u2014 or perhaps even more,
p218
aVan angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow \u2014
p219
aVthis could be a potential future therapy for cancer.
p220
aVAnd another thing that's really interesting is that
p221
aVthere's this whole \u2014 the way tumors move throughout the body,
p222
aVit's a very complex system \u2014 and there's something called the chemokine network.
p223
aVAnd chemokines are essentially chemical attractants,
p224
aVand they're the stop and go signals for cancer.
p225
aVSo a tumor expresses chemokine receptors,
p226
aVand another organ \u2014 a distant organ somewhere in the body \u2014
p227
aVwill have the corresponding chemokines,
p228
aVand the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it.
p229
aVIs it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?
p230
aVAnd the other really interesting thing is that
p231
aVwhen skeletal muscle \u2014 there's been several reports that when skeletal
p232
aVmuscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd, furthermore, when skeletal muscle is injured,
p235
aVthat's what causes chemokines \u2014 these signals saying,
p236
aV"Cancer, you can come to me," the "go signs" for the tumors \u2014
p237
aVit causes them to highly express these chemokines.
p238
aVSo, there's so much interplay here.
p239
aVI mean, there are so many possibilities
p240
aVfor why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.
p241
aVBut it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer,
p242
aVby searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something \u2014
p243
aVthere's got to be something \u2014 that's making this tissue resistant to tumors.
p244
aVAnd can we utilize \u2014 can we take this property,
p245
aVthis compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these
p246
aVanti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general?
p247
aVNow, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer \u2014
p248
aVto the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body \u2014
p249
aVis that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called "MyoD."
p250
aVAnd what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate
p251
aVinto muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD,
p252
aVhas been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to
p253
aVactually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.
p254
aVSo, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue,
p255
aVbut once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue,
p256
aVMyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them
p257
aVto become skeletal muscle cells?
p258
aVMaybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells,
p259
aVand this is why it seems as if it is so rare.
p260
aa(lp261
VIt's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle.
p262
aVMuscle is constantly being used \u2014 constantly being damaged.
p263
aVIf every time we tore a muscle
p264
aVor every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way,
p265
aVcancer occurred \u2014 I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.
p266
aVAnd I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell,
p267
aVpossibly because of all its use, has adapted
p268
aVfaster than other body tissues to respond to injury,
p269
aVto fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process
p270
aVwhich the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very,
p271
aVvery smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.
p272
aa(lp273
VIt's different when a bacteria comes into the body \u2014
p274
aVthat's a foreign object \u2014 we want that out.
p275
aVBut when the body is actually initiating a process
p276
aVand we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is
p277
aVthe right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched,
p278
aVthat in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.
p279
aVIf those diseases where tissues are deteriorating \u2014
p280
aVfor example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die
p281
aVand we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells \u2014
p282
aVwhat if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor \u2014
p283
aVput it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?
p284
aa(lp285
VThat's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible.
p286
aVThese cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile \u2014
p287
aVwe just have to manipulate them in the right way.
p288
aVAnd again, some of these may be far-fetched, but
p289
aVI figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so
p290
aVthank you very much.

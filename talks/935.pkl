VI was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.
p5
aVThe other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed,
p6
aVwho is an Egyptian-American, who actually had the idea
p7
aVto go to the Middle East and try it out before we went out as a tour.
p8
aVHe went out solo and did it first.
p9
aVThen there was Aron Kader, who was the Palestinian-American.
p10
aVAnd then there was me, the Iranian-American of the group.
p11
aVNow, being Iranian-American presents its own set of problems,
p12
aVas you know.
p13
aVThose two countries aren't getting along these days.
p14
aVSo it causes a lot of inner conflict, you know,
p15
aVlike part of me likes me, part of me hates me.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VPart of me thinks I should have a nuclear program,
p20
aVthe other part thinks I can't be trusted with one.
p21
aVThese are dilemmas I have every day.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut I was born in Iran; I'm now an American citizen,
p24
aVwhich means I have the American passport,
p25
aVwhich means I can travel.
p26
aVBecause if you only have the Iranian passport,
p27
aVyou're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms,
p28
aVyou know \u2014 Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VSo, anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you,
p33
aVwhen you get it, it still says what country you were born in.
p34
aVSo I remember getting my American passport.
p35
aVI was like, "Woo-hoo! I'm going to travel."
p36
aVAnd I opened it up, it said, "Born in Iran." I'm like, "Oh, come on, man!"
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
V"I'm trying to go places."
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VBut what's interesting is,
p45
aVI've never had trouble in any Western countries with my American passport,
p46
aVeven though it says, "Born in Iran" \u2014 no problems.
p47
aVWhere I've had problems is in some of the Arab countries.
p48
aVI guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either.
p49
aVSo I was in Kuwait recently, doing a comedy show
p50
aVwith some other American comedians.
p51
aVThey all went through.
p52
aVThen the border patrol saw my American passport: "Ah-ha! American, great."
p53
aVThen he opened it up. "Born in Iran? Wait."
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd he started asking me questions.
p58
aVHe said, "What is your father's name?"
p59
aVI said, "Well, he's passed away, but his name was Khosro."
p60
aVHe goes, "What is your grandfather's name?"
p61
aVI said, "He passed away a long time ago.
p62
aVHis name was Jabbar."
p63
aVHe says, "You wait. I'll be back," and he walked away.
p64
aVAnd I started freaking out,
p65
aVbecause I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VThought the guy was going to come back and be like,
p70
aV"We've been looking for you for 200 years."
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
V"Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue.
p75
aVYou owe us two billion dollars."
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VBut as you can see, when I talk, I speak with an American accent,
p80
aVwhich you would think, as an Iranian-American actor,
p81
aVI should be able to play any part, good, bad, what have you.
p82
aVBut a lot of times in Hollywood,
p83
aVwhen casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent,
p84
aVthey go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great!
p85
aVCan you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah?'"
p86
aVI go, "I could say that, but what if I were to say,
p87
aV'Hello. I'm your doctor'?"
p88
aVThey go, "Great! And then you hijack the hospital."
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VLike, I think you're missing the point here.
p93
aVDon't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.
p94
aVI want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank.
p95
aVI want to rob a bank in a film,
p96
aVbut do it with a gun, not with a bomb strapped around me, right?
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VBecause I imagine the director: "Maz, I think your character
p101
aVwould rob the bank with a bomb around him."
p102
aV"Why would I do that?
p103
aVIf I want the money, why would I kill myself?"
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VRight?
p108
aa(lp109
V(Applause)
p110
aV"Gimme all your money, or I'll blow myself up!"
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
V"Well, then blow yourself up.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VJust do it outside, please."
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VBut the fact is, there's good people everywhere.
p123
aVThat's what I try and show in my stand-up, good people everywhere.
p124
aVAll it takes in one person to mess it up.
p125
aVLike a couple months ago in Times Square in New York,
p126
aVthere was a Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb.
p127
aVNow, I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show.
p128
aVAnd a few months before that, there was a white American guy in Austin, Texas
p129
aVwho flew his airplane into the IRS building,
p130
aVand I happened to be in Austin that day doing a stand-up comedy show.
p131
aVNow I'll tell you, as a Middle-Eastern male,
p132
aVwhen you show up around a lot of these activities,
p133
aVyou start feeling guilty at one point.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VI was watching the news. I'm like, "Am I involved in this crap?"
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
V"I didn't get the memo. What's going on?"
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VBut what was interesting was,
p146
aVthe Pakistani Muslim guy \u2014 see, he gives a bad name to Muslims
p147
aVand Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world.
p148
aVAnd one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban
p149
aVtook credit for that failed car bombing.
p150
aVMy question is: Why would you take credit for a failed car bombing?
p151
aV"We just want to say:
p152
aVwe tried."
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
V"And furthermore ...
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
Vit is the thought that counts."
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
V(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
V"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VBut what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building,
p171
aVI know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States
p172
aVwere watching TV, going,
p173
aV"Please, don't be Middle Eastern. Don't be Hassan or Hussein."
p174
aVAnd the name came out: Jack. I'm like, "Woooo! That's not one of us!"
p175
aVBut I kept watching the news in case they came back,
p176
aVand were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam."
p177
aV"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?"
p178
aa(lp179
VBut the fact is, I've been lucky
p180
aVto get a chance to perform all over the world,
p181
aVand I did a lot of shows in the Middle East.
p182
aVI just did a seven-country solo tour.
p183
aVI was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.
p184
aVI was in Dubai.
p185
aVAnd it's great, there's good people everywhere.
p186
aVAnd you learn great things about these places.
p187
aVI encourage people always to go visit these places.
p188
aVFor example, Dubai \u2014 cool place.
p189
aVThey're obsessed with having the biggest, tallest, longest, as we all know.
p190
aVThey have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.
p191
aVIt is so big, they have taxis in the mall.
p192
aVI was walking. I heard, "Beep! Beep!" I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
p193
aVHe goes, "I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away.
p194
aVOut of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way."
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd what's crazy \u2014 there's a recession going on, even in Dubai,
p199
aVbut you wouldn't know by the prices.
p200
aVLike in the Dubai Mall, they sell frozen yogurt by the gram.
p201
aVIt's like a drug deal.
p202
aVI was walking by. The guy goes, "Psst! Habibi, my friend."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
V"You want some frozen yogurt?
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VCome here. Come here. Come here.
p211
aVI have one gram, five gram, 10 gram. How many gram do you want?"
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VI bought five grams. 10 dollars. 10 dollars! I said, "What's in this?"
p216
aVHe's like, "Good stuff, man. Colombian. Top of the line."
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VThe other thing you learn when you travel in these countries,
p221
aVin the Middle East, Latin American, South American countries,
p222
aVa lot of times when they build stuff, there's no rules and regulations.
p223
aVFor example, I took my two-year-old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall.
p224
aVAnd I've taken him to playgrounds all over the United States.
p225
aVAnd when you put your two-year-old on a slide in the United States,
p226
aVthey put something on the slide
p227
aVto slow the kid down as he comes down the slide.
p228
aVNot in the Middle East.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VI put my two-year-old on the slide, he went whoosh! He took off!
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VI went down and, "Where's my son?" "On the third floor, sir. Third floor."
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
V"You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left."
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
V"Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive."
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VBut one thing I try to do with my stand-up is break stereotypes.
p249
aVAnd I've been guilty of stereotyping as well.
p250
aVI was in Dubai. And there's a lot of Indians who work in Dubai.
p251
aVAnd they don't get paid that well.
p252
aVAnd I got it in my head that all the Indians must be workers.
p253
aVI forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai too.
p254
aVI was doing a show, and they said, "We'll send a driver to pick you up."
p255
aVI went down to the lobby, and saw this Indian guy.
p256
aVI go, "He must be my driver,"
p257
aVsince he's standing there in a cheap suit, thin mustache, staring at me.
p258
aVI say, "Excuse me, are you my driver?"
p259
aVHe goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel."
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VI go, "I'm sorry! Why were you staring at me?"
p264
aVHe goes, "I thought you were my driver."
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
V(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VI'll leave you with this: I try, with my stand-up, to break stereotypes,
p273
aVpresent Middle Easterners and Muslims in a positive light.
p274
aVI hope that in the coming years,
p275
aVmore film and television programs come out of Hollywood,
p276
aVpresenting us in a positive light.
p277
aVWho knows? Maybe one day, we'll even have our own James Bond. Right?
p278
aV"My name is Bond.
p279
aVJamal Bond."
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VTil then, I'll keep telling jokes. Hope you keep laughing.
p284
aVHave a good day. Thank you.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Applause)

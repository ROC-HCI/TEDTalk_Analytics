VWhen I was a young man, I spent six years
p5
aVof wild adventure in the tropics
p6
aVworking as an investigative journalist
p7
aVin some of the most bewitching parts of the world.
p8
aVI was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be.
p9
aVThis is why wars get fought.
p10
aVBut I also felt more alive than I've ever done since.
p11
aVAnd when I came home, I found the scope of my existence
p12
aVgradually diminishing
p13
aVuntil loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge.
p14
aVAnd I found myself sort of
p15
aVscratching at the walls of life,
p16
aVas if I was trying to find a way out
p17
aVinto a wider space beyond.
p18
aVI was, I believe, ecologically bored.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, we evolved in rather more challenging times than these,
p21
aVin a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws.
p22
aVAnd we still possess the fear and the courage
p23
aVand the aggression required to navigate those times.
p24
aVBut in our comfortable, safe, crowded lands,
p25
aVwe have few opportunities to exercise them
p26
aVwithout harming other people.
p27
aVAnd this was the sort of constraint that I found myself
p28
aVbumping up against.
p29
aVTo conquer uncertainty,
p30
aVto know what comes next,
p31
aVthat's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies,
p32
aVand having got there, or almost got there,
p33
aVwe have just encountered a new set of unmet needs.
p34
aVWe've privileged safety over experience
p35
aVand we've gained a lot in doing so,
p36
aVbut I think we've lost something too.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, I don't romanticize evolutionary time.
p39
aVI'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers,
p40
aVand the outcome of a mortal combat between me
p41
aVmyopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear
p42
aVand an enraged giant aurochs
p43
aVisn't very hard to predict.
p44
aVNor was it authenticity that I was looking for.
p45
aVI don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept.
p46
aVI just wanted a richer and rawer life
p47
aVthan I've been able to lead in Britain, or, indeed,
p48
aVthat we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word
p51
aVthat I began to understand what I was looking for.
p52
aVAnd as soon as I found that word,
p53
aVI realized that I wanted to devote
p54
aVmuch of the rest of my life to it.
p55
aa(lp56
VThe word is "rewilding,"
p57
aVand even though rewilding is a young word,
p58
aVit already has several definitions.
p59
aVBut there are two in particular that fascinate me.
p60
aVThe first one is the mass restoration
p61
aVof ecosystems.
p62
aa(lp63
VOne of the most exciting scientific findings
p64
aVof the past half century
p65
aVhas been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades.
p66
aVA trophic cascade is an ecological process
p67
aVwhich starts at the top of the food chain
p68
aVand tumbles all the way down to the bottom,
p69
aVand the classic example is what happened
p70
aVin the Yellowstone National Park in the United States
p71
aVwhen wolves were reintroduced in 1995.
p72
aVNow, we all know that wolves kill various species of animals,
p73
aVbut perhaps we're slightly less aware
p74
aVthat they give life to many others.
p75
aVIt sounds strange, but just follow me for a while.
p76
aVBefore the wolves turned up,
p77
aVthey'd been absent for 70 years.
p78
aVThe numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them,
p79
aVhad built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park,
p80
aVand despite efforts by humans to control them,
p81
aVthey'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there
p82
aVto almost nothing, they'd just grazed it away.
p83
aVBut as soon as the wolves arrived,
p84
aVeven though they were few in number,
p85
aVthey started to have the most remarkable effects.
p86
aVFirst, of course, they killed some of the deer,
p87
aVbut that wasn't the major thing.
p88
aVMuch more significantly,
p89
aVthey radically changed the behavior of the deer.
p90
aVThe deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,
p91
aVthe places where they could be trapped most easily,
p92
aVparticularly the valleys and the gorges,
p93
aVand immediately those places started to regenerate.
p94
aVIn some areas, the height of the trees
p95
aVquintupled in just six years.
p96
aVBare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen
p97
aVand willow and cottonwood.
p98
aVAnd as soon as that happened,
p99
aVthe birds started moving in.
p100
aVThe number of songbirds, of migratory birds,
p101
aVstarted to increase greatly.
p102
aVThe number of beavers started to increase,
p103
aVbecause beavers like to eat the trees.
p104
aVAnd beavers, like wolves, are ecosystem engineers.
p105
aVThey create niches for other species.
p106
aVAnd the dams they built in the rivers
p107
aVprovided habitats for otters and muskrats
p108
aVand ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians.
p109
aVThe wolves killed coyotes, and as a result of that,
p110
aVthe number of rabbits and mice began to rise,
p111
aVwhich meant more hawks, more weasels,
p112
aVmore foxes, more badgers.
p113
aVRavens and bald eagles came down to feed
p114
aVon the carrion that the wolves had left.
p115
aVBears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well,
p116
aVpartly also because there were more berries
p117
aVgrowing on the regenerating shrubs,
p118
aVand the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves
p119
aVby killing some of the calves of the deer.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut here's where it gets really interesting.
p122
aVThe wolves changed the behavior of the rivers.
p123
aVThey began to meander less.
p124
aVThere was less erosion. The channels narrowed.
p125
aVMore pools formed, more riffle sections,
p126
aVall of which were great for wildlife habitats.
p127
aVThe rivers changed
p128
aVin response to the wolves,
p129
aVand the reason was that the regenerating forests
p130
aVstabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often,
p131
aVso that the rivers became more fixed in their course.
p132
aVSimilarly, by driving the deer out of some places
p133
aVand the vegetation recovering on the valley sides,
p134
aVthere was less soil erosion,
p135
aVbecause the vegetation stabilized that as well.
p136
aVSo the wolves, small in number,
p137
aVtransformed not just the ecosystem
p138
aVof the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area of land,
p139
aVbut also its physical geography.
p140
aa(lp141
VWhales in the southern oceans
p142
aVhave similarly wide-ranging effects.
p143
aVOne of the many post-rational excuses
p144
aVmade by the Japanese government for killing whales
p145
aVis that they said, "Well, the number of fish and krill will rise
p146
aVand then there'll be more for people to eat."
p147
aVWell, it's a stupid excuse, but it sort of
p148
aVkind of makes sense, doesn't it,
p149
aVbecause you'd think that whales eat huge amounts
p150
aVof fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away,
p151
aVthere'll be more fish and krill.
p152
aVBut the opposite happened.
p153
aVYou take the whales away,
p154
aVand the number of krill collapses.
p155
aVWhy would that possibly have happened?
p156
aVWell, it now turns out that the whales are crucial
p157
aVto sustaining that entire ecosystem,
p158
aVand one of the reasons for this
p159
aVis that they often feed at depth
p160
aVand then they come up to the surface and produce
p161
aVwhat biologists politely call large fecal plumes,
p162
aVhuge explosions of poop right across the surface waters,
p163
aVup in the photic zone, where there's enough light
p164
aVto allow photosynthesis to take place,
p165
aVand those great plumes of fertilizer
p166
aVstimulate the growth of phytoplankton,
p167
aVthe plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain,
p168
aVwhich stimulate the growth of zooplankton,
p169
aVwhich feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.
p170
aVThe other thing that whales do is that,
p171
aVas they're plunging up and down through the water column,
p172
aVthey're kicking the phytoplankton
p173
aVback up towards the surface
p174
aVwhere it can continue to survive and reproduce.
p175
aVAnd interestingly, well, we know
p176
aVthat plant plankton in the oceans
p177
aVabsorb carbon from the atmosphere \u2014
p178
aVthe more plant plankton there are,
p179
aVthe more carbon they absorb \u2014
p180
aVand eventually they filter down into the abyss
p181
aVand remove that carbon from the atmospheric system.
p182
aVWell, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations,
p183
aVthey were probably responsible for sequestering
p184
aVsome tens of millions of tons of carbon
p185
aVevery year from the atmosphere.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd when you look at it like that, you think,
p188
aVwait a minute, here are the wolves
p189
aVchanging the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park.
p190
aVHere are the whales changing
p191
aVthe composition of the atmosphere.
p192
aVYou begin to see that possibly,
p193
aVthe evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis,
p194
aVwhich conceives of the world as a coherent,
p195
aVself-regulating organism,
p196
aVis beginning, at the ecosystem level, to accumulate.
p197
aa(lp198
VTrophic cascades
p199
aVtell us that the natural world
p200
aVis even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was.
p201
aVThey tell us that when you take away the large animals,
p202
aVyou are left with a radically different ecosystem
p203
aVto one which retains its large animals.
p204
aVAnd they make, in my view, a powerful case
p205
aVfor the reintroduction of missing species.
p206
aVRewilding, to me,
p207
aVmeans bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.
p208
aVIt means taking down the fences,
p209
aVit means blocking the drainage ditches,
p210
aVit means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea,
p211
aVbut otherwise stepping back.
p212
aVIt has no view as to what a right ecosystem
p213
aVor a right assemblage of species looks like.
p214
aVIt doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow
p215
aVor a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.
p216
aVIt lets nature decide,
p217
aVand nature, by and large, is pretty good at deciding.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, I mentioned that there are two definitions
p220
aVof rewilding that interest me.
p221
aVThe other one
p222
aVis the rewilding of human life.
p223
aVAnd I don't see this as an alternative
p224
aVto civilization.
p225
aVI believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology,
p226
aVas we're doing now, but at the same time, if we choose,
p227
aVhave access to a richer and wilder life of adventure
p228
aVwhen we want to because
p229
aVthere would be wonderful, rewilded habitats.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd the opportunities for this
p232
aVare developing more rapidly than you might think possible.
p233
aVThere's one estimate which suggests that in the United States,
p234
aVtwo thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared
p235
aVhas become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated,
p236
aVparticularly from the eastern half of the country.
p237
aVThere's another one which suggests
p238
aVthat 30 million hectares of land in Europe,
p239
aVan area the size of Poland,
p240
aVwill be vacated by farmers
p241
aVbetween 2000 and 2030.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow, faced with opportunities like that,
p244
aVdoes it not seem a little unambitious
p245
aVto be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx,
p246
aVbears, beavers, bison, boar, moose,
p247
aVand all the other species which are already beginning
p248
aVto move quite rapidly across Europe?
p249
aVPerhaps we should also start thinking
p250
aVabout the return of some of our lost megafauna.
p251
aa(lp252
VWhat megafauna, you say?
p253
aVWell, every continent had one,
p254
aVapart from Antarctica.
p255
aVWhen Trafalgar Square in London was excavated,
p256
aVthe river gravels there were found
p257
aVto be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus,
p258
aVrhinos, elephants, hyenas, lions.
p259
aVYes, ladies and gentlemen,
p260
aVthere were lions in Trafalgar Square
p261
aVlong before Nelson's Column was built.
p262
aVAll these species lived here
p263
aVin the last interglacial period,
p264
aVwhen temperatures were pretty similar to our own.
p265
aVIt's not climate, largely,
p266
aVwhich has got rid of the world's megafaunas.
p267
aVIt's pressure from the human population
p268
aVhunting and destroying their habitats
p269
aVwhich has done so.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd even so, you can still see the shadows
p272
aVof these great beasts in our current ecosystems.
p273
aVWhy is it that so many deciduous trees
p274
aVare able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken?
p275
aVWhy is it that they can withstand the loss
p276
aVof so much of their bark?
p277
aVWhy do understory trees,
p278
aVwhich are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind
p279
aVand have to carry less weight
p280
aVthan the big canopy trees,
p281
aVwhy are they so much tougher and harder to break
p282
aVthan the canopy trees are?
p283
aVElephants.
p284
aVThey are elephant-adapted.
p285
aVIn Europe, for example,
p286
aVthey evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant,
p287
aVelephas antiquus, which was a great beast.
p288
aVIt was related to the Asian elephant,
p289
aVbut it was a temperate animal, a temperate forest creature.
p290
aVIt was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant.
p291
aVBut why is it that some of our common shrubs
p292
aVhave spines which seem to be over-engineered
p293
aVto resist browsing by deer?
p294
aVPerhaps because they evolved
p295
aVto resist browsing by rhinoceros.
p296
aa(lp297
VIsn't it an amazing thought
p298
aVthat every time you wander into a park
p299
aVor down an avenue or through a leafy street,
p300
aVyou can see the shadows of these great beasts?
p301
aVPaleoecology, the study of past ecosystems,
p302
aVcrucial to an understanding of our own,
p303
aVfeels like a portal through which you may pass
p304
aVinto an enchanted kingdom.
p305
aVAnd if we really are looking at areas of land
p306
aVof the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available,
p307
aVwhy not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna,
p308
aVor at least species closely related to those
p309
aVwhich have become extinct everywhere?
p310
aVWhy shouldn't all of us
p311
aVhave a Serengeti on our doorsteps?
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd perhaps this is the most important thing
p314
aVthat rewilding offers us,
p315
aVthe most important thing that's missing from our lives:
p316
aVhope.
p317
aVIn motivating people to love and defend the natural world,
p318
aVan ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair.
p319
aVThe story rewilding tells us
p320
aVis that ecological change need not always proceed
p321
aVin one direction.
p322
aVIt offers us the hope
p323
aVthat our silent spring
p324
aVcould be replaced by a raucous summer.
p325
aa(lp326
VThank you.

the Sea and Human Life</em></a>. Part personal journal, part essay on natural science and wildlife (and on our own wild side), the book follows Monbiot&#39;s efforts to re-engage with nature. He shows how, by restoring and rewilding our damaged ecosystems on land and at sea, we can bring wonder back into our lives, and lays out a new, positive environmental vision, in which nature is allowed to find its own way.&nbsp;</p>   <p>After studying zoology at Oxford, Monbiot worked for the BBC&rsquo;s natural history unit, making investigative environmental programs, one of which won a Sony Award. He left the BBC to spend six wild years in the tropics. Investigating the Indonesian transmigration program, he walked and canoed across West Papua, becoming lost in the forest, eating insects and rats to stay alive and being stung almost to death by hornets. Investigating evictions in Brazil, he was beaten up by gunmen and nearly shot by military police. The radio program he made about his encounter with a police torturer in Maranh&atilde;o was used for several years on the BBC&rsquo;s health and safety training course - as an example of what not to do. Back in Britain, he founded the landrights campaign <a href=\\"http://www.tlio.org.uk/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Land Is Ours</a>  and started writing columns for the <em>Guardian</em>.

But when, in 1995, the wolves began to come back (thanks to an aggressive management program), something interesting happened: the rest of the park began to find a new, more healthful balance.

VI have a tough job to do.
p5
aVYou know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,
p6
aVwith their connotations and design, in all its forms,
p7
aVand with so much and so many people working
p8
aVon collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,
p9
aVI wanted to build an argument for primary education
p10
aVin a very specific context.
p11
aVIn order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas \u2014
p12
aVit's like four pieces of a puzzle.
p13
aVAnd if I succeed in doing that,
p14
aVmaybe you would go back with the thought
p15
aVthat you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe first piece of the puzzle is remoteness
p18
aVand the quality of education.
p19
aVNow, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.
p20
aVOf course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means
p21
aVthat as you go further and further away
p22
aVfrom an urban center, you get to remoter areas.
p23
aVWhat happens to education?
p24
aVThe second, or a different kind of remoteness
p25
aVis that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,
p26
aVyou have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,
p27
aVwhich are socially and economically remote
p28
aVfrom the rest of the city, so it's us and them.
p29
aVWhat happens to education in that context?
p30
aVSo keep both of those ideas of remoteness.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas
p33
aVdo not have good enough teachers.
p34
aVIf they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.
p35
aVThey do not have good enough infrastructure.
p36
aVAnd if they had some infrastructure,
p37
aVthey have difficulty maintaining it.
p38
aVBut I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was
p39
aVwe hired a car, looked up on Google,
p40
aVfound a route into northern India from New Delhi
p41
aVwhich, you know, which did not cross any big cities
p42
aVor any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,
p43
aVand wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,
p44
aVand then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
p45
aVThe graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.
p46
aVI mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.
p47
aVBut it was quite obvious, quite clear,
p48
aVthat for this particular route that I had taken,
p49
aVthe remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.
p50
aVThat seemed a little damning,
p51
aVand I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,
p52
aVor with the availability of electricity, and things like that.
p53
aa(lp54
VTo my surprise, it did not correlate.
p55
aVIt did not correlate with the size of classrooms.
p56
aVIt did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.
p57
aVIt did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.
p58
aVBut what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire
p59
aVto each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers \u2014 which was,
p60
aV"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" \u2014
p61
aV69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,
p62
aVthey say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,
p63
aVand they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi \u2014
p64
aVbecause, you know, those are relatively better off areas \u2014
p65
aVand then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.
p66
aVI would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class
p67
aVevery day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,
p68
aVprobably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.
p69
aVSo it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration
p70
aVwas a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,
p71
aVas opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,
p72
aVand whether they are packed tightly into classrooms
p73
aVand that sort of thing. It appears that way.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhen you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that,
p76
aVyou know, things like websites, collaborative environments \u2014
p77
aVyou've been listening to all that in the morning \u2014
p78
aVit's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,
p79
aVand, according to me, biases the result.
p80
aVThe literature \u2014 one part of it, the scientific literature \u2014
p81
aVconsistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.
p82
aVThe teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.
p83
aVBecause it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,
p84
aVlet's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.
p85
aVYou put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.
p86
aVSo the principal looks at it and says,
p87
aV3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
p88
aVIf you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,
p89
aVwhere the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent \u2014
p90
aVthat will be a completely different thing.
p91
aVSo the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,
p92
aVwould be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,
p93
aVbut we seem to be doing it the other way about.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo I came to this conclusion that ET should reach
p96
aVthe underprivileged first, not the other way about.
p97
aVAnd finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?
p98
aVWhenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,
p99
aVthe teacher's first reaction is,
p100
aVyou cannot replace a teacher with a machine \u2014 it's impossible.
p101
aVI don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,
p102
aVif you did assume that it's impossible \u2014 I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,
p103
aVthe science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,
p104
aVand he said something which completely solves this problem.
p105
aVHe said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.
p106
aVSo, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.
p107
aVAnyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,
p108
aVwhatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,
p109
aVwhere schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available
p110
aVor where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.
p111
aVIf you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,
p112
aVthen you don't need an alternative education.
p113
aVSo far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area,
p114
aVbut somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,
p115
aVbecause we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.
p116
aVThere are such areas, but \u2014 anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.
p117
aa(lp118
VI'm going to talk about children and self-organization,
p119
aVand a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea
p120
aVof what might an alternative education be like.
p121
aVThey're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.
p122
aVI'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.
p123
aVThe first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.
p124
aVAnd what we did over there was pretty much simple.
p125
aVI had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,
p126
aVso there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.
p127
aVThey cut a hole inside that wall \u2014
p128
aVwhich is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall \u2014
p129
aVand put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall
p130
aVso that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,
p131
aVa touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,
p132
aVput it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,
p133
aVput it on Altavista.com \u2014 in those days \u2014 and just left it there.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd this is what we saw.
p136
aVSo that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.
p137
aVAbout eight hours later, we found this kid.
p138
aVTo the right is this eight-year-old child who \u2014
p139
aVand to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.
p140
aVAnd what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.
p141
aVSo it sort of raised more questions than it answered.
p142
aVIs this real? Does the language matter,
p143
aVbecause he's not supposed to know English?
p144
aVWill the computer last, or will they break it and steal it
p145
aV\u2014 and did anyone teach them?
p146
aVThe last question is what everybody said, but you know,
p147
aVI mean, they must have poked their head over the wall
p148
aVand asked the people in your office,
p149
aVcan you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it,
p152
aVthis time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,
p153
aVwhere I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVSo it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall
p156
aVwas on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;
p157
aVhe later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.
p158
aVHe came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.
p159
aVVery quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad
p160
aVsomething moves on the screen \u2014
p161
aVand later on he told me, "I have never seen a television
p162
aVwhere you can do something."
p163
aVSo he figured that out. It took him over two minutes
p164
aVto figure out that he was doing things to the television.
p165
aVAnd then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click
p166
aVby hitting the touchpad \u2014 you'll see him do that.
p167
aVHe did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.
p168
aVEight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,
p169
aVand he was browsing: he was going back and forth.
p170
aVWhen that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,
p171
aVlike, children would come and see what's happening over here.
p172
aVAnd by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.
p173
aVSo eight minutes and an embedded computer
p174
aVseemed to be all that we needed there.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo we thought that this is what was happening:
p177
aVthat children in groups can self-instruct themselves
p178
aVto use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?
p179
aVAt this time there was a \u2014 the main question was about English.
p180
aVPeople said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.
p181
aVSo I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet
p182
aVinto some Indian language? That's not possible.
p183
aVSo, it has to be the other way about.
p184
aVBut let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?
p185
aVI took the experiment out to northeastern India,
p186
aVto a village called Madantusi,
p187
aVwhere, for some reason, there was no English teacher,
p188
aVso the children had not learned English at all.
p189
aVAnd I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.
p190
aVOne big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums:
p191
aVthere were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.
p192
aVIn the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.
p193
aVI left the computer there with lots of CDs \u2014 I didn't have any Internet \u2014
p194
aVand came back three months later.
p195
aVSo when I came back there, I found these two kids,
p196
aVeight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.
p197
aVAnd as soon as they saw me they said,
p198
aV"We need a faster processor and a better mouse."
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVI was real surprised.
p201
aVYou know, how on earth did they know all this?
p202
aVAnd they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."
p203
aVSo I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"
p204
aVSo they said, "Well, you've left this machine
p205
aVwhich talks only in English, so we had to learn English."
p206
aVSo then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other
p207
aV\u2014 mispronounced, but correct usage \u2014
p208
aVwords like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,
p209
aVnot only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.
p210
aVSo, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;
p211
aVin fact they may be able to teach themselves the language
p212
aVif they really wanted to.
p213
aa(lp214
VFinally, I got some funding to try this experiment out
p215
aVto see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.
p216
aVIndia is a good place to do such an experiment in,
p217
aVbecause we have all the ethnic diversities, all the \u2014 you know,
p218
aVthe genetic diversity, all the racial diversities,
p219
aVand also all the socio-economic diversities.
p220
aVSo, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section
p221
aVthat would cover practically the whole world.
p222
aVSo I did this for almost five years, and this experiment
p223
aVreally took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.
p224
aVThis is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.
p225
aVI also had to check or invent an engineering design
p226
aVwhich would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,
p227
aVso I needed different climates, for which India is also great,
p228
aVbecause we have very cold, very hot, and so on.
p229
aVThis is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.
p230
aVAnd you see here a little clip of \u2014 one of these villages \u2014
p231
aVthe first thing that these children did was to find a website
p232
aVto teach themselves the English alphabet.
p233
aa(lp234
VThen to central India \u2014 very warm, moist, fishing villages,
p235
aVwhere humidity is a very big killer of electronics.
p236
aVSo we had to solve all the problems we had
p237
aVwithout air conditioning and with very poor power,
p238
aVso most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air
p239
aVput at the right places to keep the machines running.
p240
aVI want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.
p241
aVThis sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,
p242
aVtelling his eldest sister what to do.
p243
aVAnd this happens very often with these computers,
p244
aVthat the younger children are found teaching the older ones.
p245
aa(lp246
VWhat did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct
p247
aVin a connected environment,
p248
aVirrespective of anything that we could measure.
p249
aVSo if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.
p250
aVI couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.
p251
aVAnd that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,
p252
aVbecause all of you are talking about groups.
p253
aVSo here was the power of what a group of children can do,
p254
aVif you lift the adult intervention.
p255
aa(lp256
VJust a quick idea of the measurements.
p257
aVWe took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.
p258
aVBut we got a clean learning curve,
p259
aValmost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.
p260
aVI'll leave it at that,
p261
aVbecause, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?
p262
aVWhat could they learn to do?
p263
aVBasic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email,
p264
aVgames and educational material, music downloads, playing video.
p265
aVIn short, what all of us do.
p266
aVAnd over 300 children will become computer literate
p267
aVand be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo, how do they do that?
p270
aVIf you calculated the actual time of access,
p271
aVit would work out to minutes per day,
p272
aVso that's not how it's happening.
p273
aVWhat you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.
p274
aVAnd surrounding him are usually three other children,
p275
aVwho are advising him on what they should do.
p276
aVIf you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.
p277
aVAround these four are usually a group of about 16 children,
p278
aVwho are also advising, usually wrongly,
p279
aVabout everything that's going on on the computer.
p280
aVAnd all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.
p281
aVSo they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.
p282
aVIt seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,
p283
aVbut remember, eight-year-olds live in a society
p284
aVwhere most of the time they are told, don't do this,
p285
aVyou know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.
p286
aVSo what does the eight-year-old do?
p287
aVHe observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.
p288
aVAnd if you tested him,
p289
aVhe would answer every question correctly on that topic.
p290
aVSo, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo what was the conclusion over the six years of work?
p293
aVIt was that primary education can happen on its own,
p294
aVor parts of it can happen on its own.
p295
aVIt does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.
p296
aVIt could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was
p297
aVthe second bit that I wanted to tell you,
p298
aVthat children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly,
p301
aVI conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,
p302
aVand asked them \u2014 I gave them about 68 different
p303
aVvalues-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.
p304
aVWe got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.
p305
aVI simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes \u2014
p306
aVso I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.
p307
aVThese were areas where the children were clearly confused,
p308
aVbecause half said yes and half said no.
p309
aVA typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."
p310
aVThey don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;
p311
aVperhaps none of us do.
p312
aVSo I leave you with this third question.
p313
aVCan technology alter the acquisition of values?
p314
aVFinally, self-organizing systems,
p315
aVabout which, again, I won't say too much
p316
aVbecause you've been hearing all about it.
p317
aVNatural systems are all self-organizing:
p318
aVgalaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies \u2014
p319
aVexcept for the debate about an intelligent designer.
p320
aVBut at this point in time, as far as science goes,
p321
aVit's self-organization.
p322
aVBut other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society
p323
aVand disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.
p324
aVAnd you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo here are my four sentences then.
p327
aVRemoteness affects the quality of education.
p328
aVEducational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,
p329
aVand other areas later.
p330
aVValues are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed \u2014
p331
aVthe two opposing mechanisms.
p332
aVAnd learning is most likely a self-organizing system.
p333
aVIf you put all the four together, then it gives \u2014 according to me \u2014
p334
aVit gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.
p335
aVAn educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,
p336
aVfault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.
p337
aVAs educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.
p338
aVPowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,
p339
aVbut it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.
p340
aVWe borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.
p341
aVI think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,
p342
aVand I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.
p343
aVAnd such a set of specs should produce the technology
p344
aVto address remoteness, values and violence.
p345
aVSo I thought I'd give it a name \u2014 why don't we call it "outdoctrination."
p346
aVAnd could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?
p347
aVSo I want to leave that as a thought with you.
p348
aa(lp349
VThank you.

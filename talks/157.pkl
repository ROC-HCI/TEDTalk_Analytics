(lp4
VI really am honored to be here, and as Chris said,
p5
aVit's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.
p6
aVMy first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.
p7
aVI had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead,
p8
aVgiven away most everything that I owned,
p9
aVand arrived with all the essentials \u2014
p10
aVsome poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar \u2014
p11
aVbecause I was going to save the world,
p12
aVand I thought I would just start with the African continent.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms,
p15
aVby a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving,
p16
aVthank you very much, least of all not by me.
p17
aVI was too young, unmarried, I had no children,
p18
aVdidn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.
p19
aVAnd so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life,
p20
aVand yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.
p21
aa(lp22
VI think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well,
p23
aVso I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda,
p24
aVand I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986,
p25
aVto move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.
p26
aVAnd I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere,
p27
aVmeaning "to go forward with enthusiasm." And while we were doing it,
p28
aVI realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable
p29
aVand started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.
p30
aVAnd so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery
p31
aVthat was run by 20 prostitutes.
p32
aVAnd, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group,
p33
aVand what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language,
p36
aVand how what we call people so often distances us from them,
p37
aVand makes them little.
p38
aVI also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business,
p39
aVthat, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person,
p40
aVwho essentially spent 600 dollars a month
p41
aVto keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods,
p42
aVand living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.
p43
aVSo, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side,
p44
aVand we run this as a business and I'll help you."
p45
aVThey nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,
p46
aVthings are always harder than you think they're going to be.
p47
aa(lp48
VFirst of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team,
p49
aVand we clearly aren't the A-Team here,
p50
aVso let's \u2014 I did all this training.
p51
aVAnd the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets
p52
aVof Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,
p53
aVand I sold all these little doughnuts to people,
p54
aVand I came back, and I was like, "You see?"
p55
aVAnd the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy
p56
aVdoughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like \u2014
p57
aV(Laughter) \u2014 it's a good point.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo then I went the whole American way,
p60
aVwith competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,
p61
aVbut over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.
p62
aVAnd they started listening to the marketplace,
p63
aVand they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,
p64
aVand sorghum bread, and before you knew it,
p65
aVwe had cornered the Kigali market,
p66
aVand the women were earning three to four times the national average.
p67
aVAnd with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery,
p68
aVso let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea."
p69
aVAnd I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said,
p70
aV"Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.
p71
aVYou choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country \u2014 not mine."
p72
aVBut they wouldn't give me an answer.
p73
aVSo, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,
p74
aVand finally I said, "Well, how about blue?"
p75
aVAnd they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue."
p76
aVSo, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,
p77
aVand we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,
p78
aVand on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,
p79
aVand the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,
p80
aVlike a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying
p81
aVas painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo, blue, blue, everything became blue.
p84
aVThe walls were blue, the windows were blue,
p85
aVthe sidewalk out front was painted blue.
p86
aVAnd Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"
p87
aVthe women's hips were swaying
p88
aVand little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.
p89
aVAnd at the end of it, we stood across the street
p90
aVand we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful."
p91
aVAnd the women said, "It really is."
p92
aVAnd I said, "And I think the color is perfect,"
p93
aVand they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,
p94
aVand I said, "What?"
p95
aVAnd she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?"
p96
aVAnd she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And \u2014
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
V\u2014 I learned then that listening isn't just about patience,
p100
aVbut that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,
p101
aVit's really hard to say what you mean.
p102
aVAnd, mostly because people never really ask you,
p103
aVand when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.
p104
aVAnd so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,
p105
aVbut it's also learning how better to ask questions.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things,
p108
aVand it was an extraordinary time in my life.
p109
aVAnd it taught me three lessons
p110
aVthat I think are so important for us today,
p111
aVand certainly in the work that I do.
p112
aVThe first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
p113
aVAs Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,
p114
aVand that is fundamental to dignity.
p115
aVBut as human beings, we also want to see each other,
p116
aVand we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.
p117
aVThe second is that traditional charity and aid
p118
aVare never going to solve the problems of poverty.
p119
aa(lp120
VI think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point,
p121
aVwhich is that markets alone also
p122
aVare not going to solve the problems of poverty.
p123
aVYes, we ran this as a business,
p124
aVbut someone needed to pay the philanthropic support
p125
aVthat came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice
p126
aVand, maybe most important of all,
p127
aVthe access to new contacts, networks and new markets.
p128
aVAnd so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination
p129
aVof investment and philanthropy.
p130
aVAnd on a macro level \u2014 some of the speakers have inferred that
p131
aVeven health should be privatized.
p132
aVBut, having had a father with heart disease,
p133
aVand realizing that what our family could afford
p134
aVwas not what he should have gotten,
p135
aVand having a good friend step in to help,
p136
aVI really believe that all people deserve access to health
p137
aVat prices they can afford.
p138
aVI think the market can help us figure that out,
p139
aVbut there's got to be a charitable component,
p140
aVor I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to
p143
aVbuild Acumen Fund about six years ago.
p144
aVIt's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,
p145
aVa few oxymorons in one sentence.
p146
aVIt essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,
p147
aVand then we turn around and we invest equity and loans
p148
aVin both for-profit and nonprofit entities
p149
aVthat deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water
p150
aVto low income people in South Asia and Africa,
p151
aVso that they can make their own choices.
p152
aVWe've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,
p153
aVand have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,
p154
aVand delivered tens of millions of services to people
p155
aVwho otherwise would not be able to afford them.
p156
aa(lp157
VI want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.
p158
aVBoth of them are about investing in entrepreneurs
p159
aVwho are committed to service, and who really know the markets.
p160
aVBoth of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,
p161
aVand both of them, because they're manufacturers,
p162
aVcreate jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,
p163
aVbecause they're in the malaria sector,
p164
aVand Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.
p165
aVAnd so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.
p166
aa(lp167
VThe first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.
p168
aVIt's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago
p169
aVby an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.
p170
aVThese are old-hand farmers
p171
aVwho've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs
p172
aVin Kenya over the last 30 years.
p173
aVNow, this plant is an Artemisia plant;
p174
aVit's the basic component for artemisinin,
p175
aVwhich is the best-known treatment for malaria.
p176
aVIt's indigenous to China and the Far East,
p177
aVbut given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,
p178
aVPatrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here,
p179
aVbecause it's a high value-add product."
p180
aVThe farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd so, using patient capital \u2014 money that they could raise early on,
p183
aVthat actually got below market returns
p184
aVand was willing to go the long haul and be combined
p185
aVwith management assistance, strategic assistance \u2014
p186
aVthey've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.
p187
aVSo that's about 50,000 people affected.
p188
aVAnd I think some of you may have visited \u2014
p189
aVthese farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,
p190
aVwho help them become more self-sufficient.
p191
aVThey buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,
p192
aVwhich was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,
p193
aVwho has a real interest in getting the powder
p194
aVso that they can make Coartem.
p195
aVAcumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,
p196
aVboth on looking at a new business plan,
p197
aVand what does expansion look like, helping with management support
p198
aVand helping to do term sheets and raise capital.
p199
aVAnd I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally
p200
aVin the last month or so. Because the company was literally
p201
aV10 days away from proving that the product they produced
p202
aVwas at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,
p203
aVwhen they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd we called all of the social investors we know.
p206
aVNow, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa
p207
aVand understand the importance of agriculture,
p208
aVand they even helped the farmers.
p209
aVAnd even when we explained that if ABE goes away,
p210
aVall those 7,500 jobs go away too,
p211
aVwe sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.
p212
aVAnd it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.
p213
aVSo Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,
p214
aVand the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now
p215
aVin the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,
p216
aVand I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.
p217
aa(lp218
VThis is Samuel. He's a farmer.
p219
aVHe was actually living in the Kibera slums
p220
aVwhen his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.
p221
aVSo he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,
p222
aVthey now have seven acres under cultivation.
p223
aVSamuel's kids are in private school,
p224
aVand he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production \u2014
p225
aVdignity being more important than wealth.
p226
aa(lp227
VThe next one, many of you know.
p228
aVI talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,
p229
aVand some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,
p230
aVwhich is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.
p231
aVIt's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.
p232
aVAnd this is really a story about a public-private solution
p233
aVthat has really worked.
p234
aVIt started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology
p235
aVessentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,
p236
aVso you could create a bed net,
p237
aVa malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.
p238
aa(lp239
VIt could alter the vector, but like Artemisia,
p240
aVit had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,
p241
aVSumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment
p242
aVwith whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"
p243
aVUNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets,
p244
aVand then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's
p245
aVand the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free."
p246
aVAcumen came in with the patient capital,
p247
aVand we also helped to identify the entrepreneur
p248
aVthat we would all partner with here in Africa,
p249
aVand Exxon provided the initial resin.
p250
aa(lp251
VWell, in looking around for entrepreneurs,
p252
aVthere was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,
p253
aVin A to Z manufacturing company.
p254
aVIt's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.
p255
aVIt's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,
p256
aVand continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.
p257
aVAnd so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa
p258
aVto produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment
p259
aVto work with malaria.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd, long story short, again, they've been so successful.
p262
aVIn our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.
p263
aVWe thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.
p264
aVThis year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,
p265
aVand they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.
p266
aVThey're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.
p267
aVAnd so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,
p268
aVand from a public health perspective, these are real successes.
p269
aa(lp270
VBut it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty,
p271
aVbecause it's not long-term sustainable.
p272
aVIt's a company with one big customer.
p273
aVAnd if avian flu hits, or for any other reason
p274
aVthe world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.
p275
aVAnd so, Anuj and Acumen
p276
aVhave been talking about testing the private sector,
p277
aVbecause the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,
p278
aVlook, in a country like Tanzania,
p279
aV80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.
p280
aVIt costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,
p281
aVand it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,
p282
aVso the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.
p283
aVMost people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.
p284
aVAnd we said, "Well, there's another option.
p285
aVLet's use the market as the best listening device we have, and
p286
aVunderstand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.
p287
aVWe can start building local distribution,
p288
aVand actually, it can cost the public sector much less."
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z,
p291
aVa loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing
p292
aVand listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.
p293
aVOne, that people will pay different prices,
p294
aVbut the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net
p295
aVand make a decision to buy it.
p296
aVAnd when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say
p297
aVabout what they like and what they don't like.
p298
aVAnd that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.
p299
aVBut because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed
p300
aVbecause of the patient capital,
p301
aVwe've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector
p302
aVto distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.
p303
aVSo then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,
p304
aVwe have a choice.
p305
aVWe can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,
p306
aVor we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,
p307
aVcosting the public sector another six dollars a net,
p308
aVgive the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system
p309
aVthat might, over time, start sustaining itself.
p310
aa(lp311
VWe've got to start having conversations like this,
p312
aVand I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,
p313
aVbut also to bring other people to the table around it.
p314
aVWhenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.
p315
aVShe was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.
p316
aVShe grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,
p317
aVdidn't have very much education.
p318
aVShe moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather,
p319
aVwho was a cement hauler,
p320
aVand they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.
p321
aVMy grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop,
p322
aVmaking shirts for about 10 cents an hour.
p323
aVShe, like so many of the women I see at A to Z,
p324
aVworked hard every day, understood what suffering was,
p325
aVhad a deep faith in God, loved her children
p326
aVand would never have accepted a handout.
p327
aVBut because she had the opportunity of the marketplace,
p328
aVand she lived in a society that provided the safety
p329
aVof having access to affordable health and education,
p330
aVher children and their children were able to live
p331
aVlives of real purpose and follow real dreams.
p332
aa(lp333
VI look around at my siblings and my cousins \u2014 and as I said,
p334
aVthere are a lot of us \u2014
p335
aVand I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.
p336
aVOne sister who makes other people's wishes come true.
p337
aVAnd my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers,
p338
aVand I think about all the people across this continent
p339
aVwho are working hard every day,
p340
aVis that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility,
p341
aVand that they also can believe and get access to services,
p342
aVso that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.
p343
aVIt shouldn't be that difficult.
p344
aVBut what it takes is a commitment from all of us
p345
aVto essentially refuse trite assumptions,
p346
aVget out of our ideological boxes.
p347
aVIt takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed
p348
aVto service as well as to success.
p349
aVIt takes opening your arms, both, wide,
p350
aVand expecting very little love in return,
p351
aVbut demanding accountability,
p352
aVand bringing the accountability to the table as well.
p353
aVAnd most of all, most of all,
p354
aVit requires that all of us have the courage and the patience,
p355
aVwhether we are rich or poor, African or non-African,
p356
aVlocal or diaspora, left or right,
p357
aVto really start listening to each other.
p358
aVThank you.

So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>", "slug": "jacqueline_novogratz", "whotheyare": "Jacqueline Novogratz works to enable human flourishing.

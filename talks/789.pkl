VI only have three minutes
p5
aVso I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will
p6
aVuse up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.
p7
aVSo, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket
p8
aVthat got me thinking.
p9
aVI've had some time to think it over.
p10
aVAnd energy efficiency is more than just
p11
aVabout the vehicle \u2014
p12
aVit's also about the road.
p13
aa(lp14
VRoad design makes a difference, particularly intersections,
p15
aVof which there are two types: signalized
p16
aVand unsignalized, which means stop signs.
p17
aVFifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.
p18
aVRoundabouts are much better.
p19
aVA study of 24 intersections
p20
aVhas found crashes drop 40 percent
p21
aVfrom when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.
p22
aVInjury crashes have dropped 76 percent,
p23
aVfatal crashes down 90 percent.
p24
aVBut that's just safety.
p25
aVWhat about time and gas?
p26
aVSo, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking,
p27
aVwhich means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution,
p28
aVless time wasted,
p29
aVand that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency
p30
aVthan we have in the United States.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo, unsignalized intersections,
p33
aVmeaning stop signs, they save many lives,
p34
aVbut there's an excessive proliferation of them.
p35
aVSmall roundabouts are starting to appear.
p36
aVThis is one in my neighborhood. And they are
p37
aVmuch better \u2014 better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.
p38
aVThey're expensive to install,
p39
aVbut they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut they are not applicable in all situations.
p42
aVSo, take, for example, the three-way intersection.
p43
aVSo, it's logical that you'd have one there,
p44
aVon the minor road entering the major.
p45
aVBut the other two are somewhat questionable.
p46
aVSo, here's one. There's another one which I studied.
p47
aVCars rarely appear on that third road.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd so, the question is, what does that cost us?
p50
aVThat intersection I looked at had about 3,000
p51
aVcars per day in each direction,
p52
aVand so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.
p53
aVThat's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,
p54
aVthat's $51,000 per year.
p55
aVThat's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,
p56
aVwear on the car, and time.
p57
aVWhat's that time worth?
p58
aVWell, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,
p59
aVthat's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.
p60
aVis $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.
p61
aVAdd that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,
p62
aVjust for that sign in each direction.
p63
aa(lp64
VDiscount that back to the present, at five percent:
p65
aVover two million dollars
p66
aVfor a stop sign, in each direction.
p67
aVNow, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,
p68
aVyou could actually buy the property,
p69
aVcut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,
p70
aVand then sell it off again.
p71
aVAnd you'd still come out ahead.
p72
aVSo, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"
p73
aVI mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?
p74
aVBecause it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?
p75
aa(lp76
VThe answer is to enable cars
p77
aVto come in from that side road safely.
p78
aVBecause there are a lot of people who might live up there
p79
aVand if they're waiting forever a long queue could form
p80
aVbecause the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.
p81
aVCan that be accomplished with existing signs?
p82
aVSo, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.
p83
aVStop signs were invented in 1915,
p84
aVyield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo, why not use a yield sign?
p87
aVWell the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.
p88
aVThat means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait
p89
aVtill they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion
p90
aVof alternating, or taking turns,
p91
aVand it's always on the minor road,
p92
aVallowing the major one to have primacy.
p93
aVSo, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.
p94
aVYou couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember
p95
aVwhat you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different."
p96
aVThat would not work.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo, what the world needs now
p99
aVis a new type of sign.
p100
aV(Applause)
p101
aVSo, you'd have a little instruction below it,
p102
aVyou know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.
p103
aVAnd it merges the stop sign and yield signs.
p104
aVIt's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.
p105
aVAnd uncertainty results in caution.
p106
aVWhen people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with
p107
aVthey slow down.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo, now that you are all "Road Scholars" ...
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aVdon't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.
p112
aVBut you all are members of communities,
p113
aVand you can exercise your community influence
p114
aVto create more sensible traffic flows.
p115
aVAnd you can have more impact on the environment
p116
aVjust getting your neighborhood to change these things
p117
aVthan by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.

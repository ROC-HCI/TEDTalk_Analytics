VWhen I was about 16 years old
p5
aVI can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation,
p6
aVlooking for a movie to watch on HBO \u2014
p7
aVand how many of you remember "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"?
p8
aVOh yeah, great movie, right? \u2014 Well, I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen, and so I thought,
p9
aV"Sweet! Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this!"
p10
aVIt wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick,
p11
aVI know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller, but that's how I remember you; you're Ferris.
p12
aVBut you weren't doing Ferris-y things at the time; you were doing gay things at the time.
p13
aa(lp14
VHe was in a movie called "Torch Song Trilogy."
p15
aVAnd "Torch Song Trilogy" was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love.
p16
aVLove and respect \u2014 that's what the whole film was about.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd as I'm watching it, I'm realizing that they're talking about me.
p19
aVNot the drag queen part \u2014 I am not shaving my hair for anyone \u2014 but the gay part.
p20
aVThe finding love and respect, the part about trying to find your place in the world.
p21
aVSo as I'm watching this, I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears,
p22
aVand it stuck with me for the past 25 years.
p23
aVAnd there's this quote that the main character, Arnold, tells his mother
p24
aVas they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.
p25
aa(lp26
V"There's one thing more \u2014 there's just one more thing you better understand.
p27
aVI've taught myself to sew, cook, fix plumbing, build furniture,
p28
aVI can even pat myself on the back when necessary,
p29
aVall so I don't have to ask anyone for anything.
p30
aVThere's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect,
p31
aVand anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life."
p32
aa(lp33
VI remember that scene like it was yesterday; I was 16, I was in tears, I was in the closet,
p34
aVand I'm looking at these two people, Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before,
p35
aVfighting for love.
p36
aVWhen I finally got to a place in my life
p37
aVwhere I came out and accepted who I was, and was really quite happy, to tell you the truth,
p38
aVI was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too.
p39
aVI realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was \u2014
p40
aVgay being happy, not gay being attracted to the same sex.
p41
aVIn fact, I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger
p42
aVand a lot of frustration and a lot of fear
p43
aVabout who I was and the gay lifestyle.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, I'm sitting here trying to figure out "the gay lifestyle," "the gay lifestyle,"
p46
aVand I keep hearing this word over and over and over again: lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.
p47
aVI've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat
p48
aVto civilization than terrorism.
p49
aVThat's when I got scared.
p50
aVBecause I'm thinking, if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization,
p51
aVI need to figure out what this stuff is, and I need to stop doing it right now.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VSo, I took a look at my life, a hard look at my life,
p55
aVand I saw some things very disturbing.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVAnd I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you,
p58
aVstarting with my mornings.
p59
aVI drink coffee.
p60
aVNot only do I drink coffee, I know other gay people who drink coffee.
p61
aVI get stuck in traffic \u2014
p62
aVevil, evil traffic.
p63
aVSometimes I get stuck in lines at airports.
p64
aa(lp65
VI look around, and I go, "My God, look at all these gay people!
p66
aVWe're all trapped in these lines! These long lines trying to get on an airplane!
p67
aVMy God, this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil!"
p68
aa(lp69
VI clean up. This is not an actual photograph of my son's room; his is messier.
p70
aVAnd because I have a 15-year-old, all I do is cook and cook and cook.
p71
aVAny parents out there of teenagers? All we do is cook for these people \u2014
p72
aVthey eat two, three, four dinners a night \u2014 it's ridiculous!
p73
aVThis is the gay lifestyle.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic,
p76
aVmy partner and I, we get together
p77
aVand we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVWe're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on "American Idol."
p80
aVWe have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on
p81
aVbecause we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on.
p82
aVThis is the super duper evil gay lifestyle.
p83
aVRun for your heterosexual lives, people.
p84
aV(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VWhen my partner, Steve, and I first started dating,
p87
aVhe told me this story about penguins.
p88
aVAnd I didn't know where he was going with it at first.
p89
aVHe was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me, but he told me that
p90
aVwhen a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with,
p91
aVthey present them with a pebble \u2014 the perfect pebble.
p92
aVAnd then he reaches into his pocket, and he brings this out to me.
p93
aVAnd I looked at it, and I was like, this is really cool.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd he says, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you."
p96
aa(lp97
VSo I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous,
p98
aVlike, I don't know, a TEDx talk.
p99
aVI wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time.
p100
aVAnd sometimes I just wear it just because.
p101
aa(lp102
VHow many people out there are in love? Anyone in love out there?
p103
aVYou might be gay.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVBecause I, too, am in love, and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about.
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aVYou may want to tell your spouse. Who, if they're in love, might be gay as well.
p108
aVHow many of you are single? Any single people out there?
p109
aVYou too might be gay! Because I know some gay people who are also single.
p110
aVIt's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it!
p111
aVIt goes and goes and engulfs!
p112
aa(lp113
VIt's really quite silly, isn't it?
p114
aVThat's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say
p115
aV(Applause)
p116
aVthat he supports \u2014
p117
aV(Applause)
p118
aVthat he supports marriage equality.
p119
aVIt's a wonderful day in our country's history; it's a wonderful day in the globe's history
p120
aVto be able to have an actual sitting president say, enough of this \u2014
p121
aVfirst to himself, and then to the rest of the world.
p122
aVIt's wonderful.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut there's something that's been disturbing me since he
p125
aVmade that remark just a short time ago.
p126
aVAnd that is, apparently, this is just another move by the gay activists
p127
aVthat's on the gay agenda.
p128
aVAnd I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time.
p129
aVI've been to all of the functions, I've been to fundraisers,
p130
aVI've written about the topic, and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVI've paid my dues on time,
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVI've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine,
p135
aVand I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda.
p136
aVIt's very, very frustrating, and I was feeling left out, like I wasn't quite gay enough.
p137
aa(lp138
VBut then something wonderful happened: I was out shopping, as I tend to do,
p139
aVand I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd I said to myself, "LZ, for so long, you have been denied this.
p142
aVWhen you get in front of this crowd, you're gonna share the news.
p143
aVYou're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder,
p144
aVwhat exactly is in the gay agenda?
p145
aVWhat are these gays up to?
p146
aVWhat do they want?"
p147
aa(lp148
VSo, without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen \u2014
p149
aVnow be careful, 'cause it's evil \u2014 a copy,
p150
aVthe official copy, of the gay agenda.
p151
aV(Music)
p152
aVThe gay agenda, people!
p153
aV(Applause)
p154
aVThere it is!
p155
aVDid you soak it all in? The gay agenda.
p156
aa(lp157
VSome of you may be calling it, what,
p158
aVthe Constitution of the United States, is that what you call it too?
p159
aVThe U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda.
p160
aVThese gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens
p161
aVand it's all written down in plain sight.
p162
aVI was blown away when I saw it. I was like, wait, this is the gay agenda?
p163
aVWhy didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about?
p164
aVI wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset.
p165
aVBut there it is. The gay agenda.
p166
aVRun for your heterosexual lives.
p167
aa(lp168
VDid you know that in all the states where there is no shading that
p169
aVpeople who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered
p170
aVcan be kicked out of their apartments
p171
aVfor being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?
p172
aVThat's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed,
p173
aVbecause there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people.
p174
aVDid you know in the states where there's no shading that
p175
aVyou can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?
p176
aVNot based upon the quality of your work,
p177
aVhow long you've been there, if you stink,
p178
aVjust if you're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered.
p179
aVAll of which flies in the face of the gay agenda,
p180
aValso known as the U.S. Constitution.
p181
aVSpecifically, this little amendment right here:
p182
aa(lp183
V"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities
p184
aVof citizens of the United States."
p185
aa(lp186
VI'm looking at you, North Carolina.
p187
aVBut you're not looking at the U.S. Constitution.
p188
aVThis is the gay agenda: equality. Not special rights,
p189
aVbut the rights that were already written by these people \u2014
p190
aVthese elitists, if you will.
p191
aVEducated, well-dressed,
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aVsome would dare say questionably dressed.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVNonetheless, our forefathers, right?
p196
aVThe people that, we say, knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution \u2014
p197
aVthe gay agenda, if you will.
p198
aVAll of that flies in the face of what they did.
p199
aa(lp200
VThat is the reason why I felt it was imperative that
p201
aVI presented you with this copy of the gay agenda.
p202
aVBecause I figured if I made it funny, you wouldn't be as threatened.
p203
aVI figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious.
p204
aVBut when you see the map, and you see our state of Michigan \u2014
p205
aVit's legal to fire someone
p206
aVfor being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,
p207
aVthat it's legal to remove someone from their home
p208
aVbecause they're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,
p209
aVthen you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality
p210
aVis not about stripping someone's rights away,
p211
aVit's about granting them the rights that [have] already been stated.
p212
aVAnd we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated,
p213
aVthat we've already agreed upon.
p214
aVThere are people living in fear
p215
aVof losing their jobs
p216
aVso they don't show anyone who they really are
p217
aVright here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina;
p218
aVall those states that were clear, it's legal.
p219
aa(lp220
VIf I could brag for a second,
p221
aVI have a 15-year-old son from my marriage.
p222
aVHe has a 4.0.
p223
aVHe is starting a new club at school, Policy Debate.
p224
aVHe's a budding track star;
p225
aVhe has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in.
p226
aVHe volunteers.
p227
aVHe prays before he eats.
p228
aVI would like to think, as his father \u2014 and he lives with me primarily \u2014
p229
aVthat I had a little something to do with all of that.
p230
aVI would like to think that he's a good boy,
p231
aVa respectful young man. I would like to think that
p232
aVI've proven to be a capable father.
p233
aVBut if I were to go to the state of Michigan today,
p234
aVand try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage,
p235
aVI would be disqualified for only one reason:
p236
aVbecause I'm gay.
p237
aVIt doesn't matter what I've already proven, what I can do with my heart.
p238
aVIt's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am
p239
aVthat I am disqualified for any sort of adoption.
p240
aVAnd that's not just about me,
p241
aVthat's about so many other Michiganders, U.S. citizens,
p242
aVwho don't understand why what they are
p243
aVis so much more significant than who they are.
p244
aa(lp245
VThis story just keeps playing over and over
p246
aVand over again in our country's history.
p247
aVThere was a time in which, I don't know,
p248
aVpeople who were black couldn't have the same rights.
p249
aVPeople who happened to be women didn't have the same rights, couldn't vote.
p250
aVThere was a point in our history in which, if you were considered disabled,
p251
aVthat an employer could just fire you, before the Americans with Disabilities Act.
p252
aVWe keep doing this over and over again.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd so here we are, 2012,
p255
aVgay agenda,
p256
aVgay lifestyle, and I'm not a good dad
p257
aVand people don't deserve to be able to protect their families
p258
aVbecause of what they are, not who they are.
p259
aVSo when you hear the words "gay lifestyle" and "gay agenda" in the future,
p260
aVI encourage you to do two things:
p261
aVOne, remember the U.S. Constitution, and then two,
p262
aVif you wouldn't mind looking to your left, please.
p263
aVLook to your right.
p264
aVThat person next to you is a brother, is a sister.
p265
aVAnd they should be treated with love and respect.
p266
aVThank you.

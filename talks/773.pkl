VI think I'll start out and just talk a little bit
p5
aVabout what exactly autism is.
p6
aVAutism is a very big continuum
p7
aVthat goes from very severe \u2014 the child remains nonverbal \u2014
p8
aVall the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers.
p9
aVAnd I actually feel at home here,
p10
aVbecause there's a lot of autism genetics here.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VYou wouldn't have any \u2014
p15
aa(lp16
V(Applause)
p17
aa(lp18
VIt's a continuum of traits.
p19
aVWhen does a nerd turn into Asperger, which is just mild autism?
p20
aVI mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed
p21
aVas autistic spectrum today.
p22
aVAnd one of the things that is really going to concern me
p23
aVis getting these kids to be the ones
p24
aVthat are going to invent the next energy things
p25
aVthat Bill Gates talked about this morning.
p26
aa(lp27
VOK, now, if you want to understand autism: animals.
p28
aVI want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking.
p29
aVYou have to get away from verbal language.
p30
aVI think in pictures. I don't think in language.
p31
aVNow, the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details.
p32
aVThis is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters
p33
aVor the little letters,
p34
aVand the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details.
p37
aVWell, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important
p38
aVbecause it'll fall down if you ignore the details.
p39
aVAnd one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today
p40
aVis things are getting too abstract.
p41
aVPeople are getting away from doing hands-on stuff.
p42
aVI'm really concerned that a lot of the schools
p43
aVhave taken out the hands-on classes, because art, and classes like that \u2014
p44
aVthose are the classes where I excelled.
p45
aa(lp46
VIn my work with cattle,
p47
aVI noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice
p48
aVwould make the cattle balk.
p49
aVFor example, this flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility.
p50
aVThis feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility;
p51
aVall they needed to do was move the flag.
p52
aVRapid movement, contrast.
p53
aVIn the early '70s when I started, I got right down in the chutes
p54
aVto see what cattle were seeing.
p55
aVPeople thought that was crazy.
p56
aVA coat on a fence would make them balk, shadows would make them balk,
p57
aVa hose on the floor \u2014 people weren't noticing these things.
p58
aVA chain hanging down ...
p59
aVAnd that's shown very, very nicely in the movie.
p60
aa(lp61
VIn fact, I loved the movie, how they duplicated all my projects.
p62
aVThat's the geek side.
p63
aVMy drawings got to star in the movie, too.
p64
aVAnd, actually, it's called "Temple Grandin,"
p65
aVnot "Thinking in Pictures."
p66
aa(lp67
VSo what is thinking in pictures?
p68
aVIt's literally movies in your head.
p69
aVMy mind works like Google for images.
p70
aVWhen I was a young kid, I didn't know my thinking was different.
p71
aVI thought everybody thought in pictures.
p72
aVThen when I did my book, "Thinking in Pictures,"
p73
aVI started interviewing people about how they think.
p74
aVAnd I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different.
p75
aVLike if I say, "Think about a church steeple,"
p76
aVmost people get this sort of generalized generic one.
p77
aVNow, maybe that's not true in this room,
p78
aVbut it's going to be true in a lot of different places.
p79
aVI see only specific pictures.
p80
aVThey flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures.
p81
aVAnd in the movie, they've got a great scene in there,
p82
aVwhere the word "shoe" is said, and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes
p83
aVpop into my imagination.
p84
aa(lp85
VOK, there's my childhood church; that's specific.
p86
aVThere's some more, Fort Collins.
p87
aVOK, how about famous ones?
p88
aVAnd they just kind of come up, kind of like this.
p89
aVJust really quickly, like Google for pictures.
p90
aVAnd they come up one at a time,
p91
aVand then I think, "OK, well, maybe we can have it snow,
p92
aVor we can have a thunderstorm,"
p93
aVand I can hold it there and turn them into videos.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, visual thinking was a tremendous asset
p96
aVin my work designing cattle-handling facilities.
p97
aVAnd I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated
p98
aVat the slaughter plant.
p99
aVI'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides.
p100
aVI've got that stuff up on YouTube, if you want to look at it.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VBut one of the things that I was able to do in my design work
p105
aVis I could test-run a piece of equipment in my mind,
p106
aVjust like a virtual reality computer system.
p107
aVAnd this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects
p108
aVthat was used in the movie.
p109
aVThat was like just so super cool.
p110
aVAnd there were a lot of, kind of, Asperger types and autism types
p111
aVworking out there on the movie set, too.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VBut one of the things that really worries me is:
p116
aVWhere's the younger version of those kids going today?
p117
aVThey're not ending up in Silicon Valley,
p118
aVwhere they belong.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
V(Applause)
p123
aa(lp124
VOne of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social,
p125
aVis I had to sell my work, and not myself.
p126
aVAnd the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings,
p127
aVI showed off pictures of things.
p128
aVAnother thing that helped me as a little kid
p129
aVis, boy, in the '50s, you were taught manners.
p130
aVYou were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves
p131
aVin the store and throw it around.
p132
aa(lp133
VWhen kids get to be in third or fourth grade,
p134
aVyou might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker,
p135
aVdrawing in perspective.
p136
aVNow, I want to emphasize
p137
aVthat not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker.
p138
aVNow, I had this brain scan done several years ago,
p139
aVand I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line
p140
aVgoing deep into my visual cortex.
p141
aVThis is tensor imaging.
p142
aVAnd my great big Internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's.
p143
aVThe red lines there are me,
p144
aVand the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control.
p145
aVAnd there I got a gigantic one,
p146
aVand the control over there, the blue one, has got a really small one.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd some of the research now is showing
p149
aVthat people on the spectrum actually think with the primary visual cortex.
p150
aVNow, the thing is, the visual thinker is just one kind of mind.
p151
aVYou see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind \u2014
p152
aVgood at one thing, bad at something else.
p153
aVAnd where I was bad was algebra.
p154
aVAnd I was never allowed to take geometry or trig.
p155
aVGigantic mistake.
p156
aVI'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra,
p157
aVgo right to geometry and trig.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker.
p160
aVMore abstract.
p161
aVThese are your engineers, your computer programmers.
p162
aVThis is pattern thinking.
p163
aVThat praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper \u2014
p164
aVno scotch tape, no cuts.
p165
aVAnd there in the background is the pattern for folding it.
p166
aVHere are the types of thinking:
p167
aVphoto-realistic visual thinkers, like me;
p168
aVpattern thinkers, music and math minds.
p169
aVSome of these oftentimes have problems with reading.
p170
aVYou also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic.
p171
aVYou'll see these different kinds of minds.
p172
aVAnd then there's a verbal mind, they know every fact about everything.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, another thing is the sensory issues.
p175
aVI was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.
p176
aVAnd I came in half an hour beforehand
p177
aVso I could have it put on and kind of get used to it,
p178
aVand they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin.
p179
aVBut sensory is an issue.
p180
aVSome kids are bothered by fluorescent lights;
p181
aVothers have problems with sound sensitivity.
p182
aVYou know, it's going to be variable.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight
p185
aVinto the animal mind.
p186
aVBecause think about it: an animal is a sensory-based thinker,
p187
aVnot verbal \u2014 thinks in pictures, thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.
p188
aVThink about how much information there is on the local fire hydrant.
p189
aVHe knows who's been there \u2014
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VWhen they were there.
p194
aVAre they friend or foe? Is there anybody he can go mate with?
p195
aVThere's a ton of information on that fire hydrant.
p196
aVIt's all very detailed information.
p197
aVAnd looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, the animal mind, and also my mind,
p200
aVputs sensory-based information into categories.
p201
aVMan on a horse,
p202
aVand a man on the ground \u2014
p203
aVthat is viewed as two totally different things.
p204
aVYou could have a horse that's been abused by a rider.
p205
aVThey'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian
p206
aVand with the horseshoer, but you can't ride him.
p207
aVYou have another horse, where maybe the horseshoer beat him up,
p208
aVand he'll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian,
p209
aVbut a person can ride him.
p210
aVCattle are the same way.
p211
aVMan on a horse, a man on foot \u2014 they're two different things.
p212
aVYou see, it's a different picture.
p213
aVSee, I want you to think about just how specific this is.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, this ability to put information into categories,
p216
aVI find a lot of people are not very good at this.
p217
aVWhen I'm out troubleshooting equipment
p218
aVor problems with something in a plant,
p219
aVthey don't seem to be able to figure out:
p220
aV"Do I have a training-people issue?
p221
aVOr do I have something wrong with the equipment?"
p222
aVIn other words, categorize equipment problem from a people problem.
p223
aVI find a lot of people have difficulty doing that.
p224
aVNow, let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem.
p225
aVIs it a minor problem, with something simple I can fix?
p226
aVOr is the whole design of the system wrong?
p227
aVPeople have a hard time figuring that out.
p228
aa(lp229
VLet's just look at something like, you know,
p230
aVsolving problems with making airlines safer.
p231
aVYeah, I'm a million-mile flier.
p232
aVI do lots and lots of flying,
p233
aVand if I was at the FAA,
p234
aVwhat would I be doing a lot of direct observation of?
p235
aVIt would be their airplane tails.
p236
aVYou know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years,
p237
aVthe tail either came off,
p238
aVor steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way.
p239
aVIt's tails, pure and simple.
p240
aVAnd when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what?
p241
aVThey can't see that stuff inside the tail.
p242
aVNow as I think about that,
p243
aVI'm pulling up all of that specific information.
p244
aVIt's specific.
p245
aVSee, my thinking's bottom-up.
p246
aVI take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle.
p247
aa(lp248
VNow, here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats.
p249
aVHe'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat.
p250
aVWhite cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine.
p251
aVNow, the thing is, the world is going to need
p252
aVall of the different kinds of minds to work together.
p253
aVWe've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds.
p254
aVAnd one of the things that is driving me really crazy
p255
aVas I travel around and I do autism meetings,
p256
aVis I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids,
p257
aVand they just aren't very social,
p258
aVand nobody's working on developing their interest
p259
aVin something like science.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher.
p262
aVMy science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie.
p263
aVI was a goofball student when I was in high school.
p264
aVI just didn't care at all about studying,
p265
aVuntil I had Mr. Carlock's science class.
p266
aVHe was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.
p267
aVAnd he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room.
p268
aVThis brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids
p269
aVinteresting stuff.
p270
aVYou know, one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do
p271
aVis tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED,
p272
aVand there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet
p273
aVto get these kids turned on.
p274
aVBecause I'm seeing a lot of these geeky, nerdy kids,
p275
aVand the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country
p276
aVwhen you get away from these tech areas,
p277
aVthey don't know what to do with these kids.
p278
aVAnd they're not going down the right path.
p279
aa(lp280
VThe thing is, you can make a mind
p281
aVto be more of a thinking and cognitive mind,
p282
aVor your mind can be wired to be more social.
p283
aVAnd what some of the research now has shown in autism
p284
aVis there may by extra wiring back here in the really brilliant mind,
p285
aVand we lose a few social circuits here.
p286
aVIt's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social.
p287
aVAnd then you can get to the point where it's so severe,
p288
aVyou're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal.
p289
aVIn the normal human mind,
p290
aVlanguage covers up the visual thinking we share with animals.
p291
aa(lp292
VThis is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.
p293
aVHe studied Alzheimer's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia.
p294
aVAnd the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain.
p295
aVAnd then this artwork came out of somebody
p296
aVwho used to install stereos in cars.
p297
aVNow, Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics,
p298
aVbut I think it's very interesting that there was some work done
p299
aVto show that this eddy pattern in this painting
p300
aVfollowed a statistical model of turbulence,
p301
aVwhich brings up the whole interesting idea
p302
aVof maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head.
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd the Wolfram stuff \u2014
p305
aVI was taking notes and writing down all the search words I could use,
p306
aVbecause I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures.
p307
aVWe've got to show these kids interesting stuff.
p308
aVAnd they've taken out the auto-shop class
p309
aVand the drafting class and the art class.
p310
aVI mean, art was my best subject in school.
p311
aa(lp312
VWe've got to think about all these different kinds of minds,
p313
aVand we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds,
p314
aVbecause we absolutely are going to need
p315
aVthese kinds of people in the future.
p316
aVAnd let's talk about jobs.
p317
aVOK, my science teacher got me studying,
p318
aVbecause I was a goofball that didn't want to study.
p319
aVBut you know what? I was getting work experience.
p320
aVI'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things,
p321
aVlike how to be on time \u2014 I was taught that when I was eight years old.
p322
aVHow to have table manners at granny's Sunday party.
p323
aVI was taught that when I was very, very young.
p324
aVAnd when I was 13, I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.
p325
aVI did internships in college,
p326
aVI was building things,
p327
aVand I also had to learn how to do assignments.
p328
aa(lp329
VYou know, all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little.
p330
aVMy mother said, "Well let's do a picture of something else."
p331
aVThey've got to learn how to do something else.
p332
aVLet's say the kid is fixated on Legos.
p333
aVLet's get him working on building different things.
p334
aVThe thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated.
p335
aVLike if the kid loves race cars, let's use race cars for math.
p336
aVLet's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance.
p337
aVIn other words, use that fixation
p338
aVin order to motivate that kid, that's one of the things we need to do.
p339
aVI really get fed up when the teachers,
p340
aVespecially when you get away from this part of the country,
p341
aVthey don't know what to do with these smart kids.
p342
aVIt just drives me crazy.
p343
aa(lp344
VWhat can visual thinkers do when they grow up?
p345
aVThey can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers,
p346
aVphotography, industrial design.
p347
aVThe pattern thinkers \u2014 they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians,
p348
aVyour software engineers, your computer programmers,
p349
aVall of those kinds of jobs.
p350
aVAnd then you've got the word minds; they make great journalists,
p351
aVand they also make really, really good stage actors.
p352
aVBecause the thing about being autistic is,
p353
aVI had to learn social skills like being in a play.
p354
aVYou just kind of ... you just have to learn it.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd we need to be working with these students.
p357
aVAnd this brings up mentors.
p358
aVYou know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher.
p359
aVHe was a NASA space scientist.
p360
aVSome states now are getting it to where, if you have a degree in biology
p361
aVor in chemistry,
p362
aVyou can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry.
p363
aVWe need to be doing that.
p364
aVBecause what I'm observing is,
p365
aVthe good teachers, for a lot of these kids,
p366
aVare out in the community colleges.
p367
aVBut we need to be getting some of these good teachers
p368
aVinto the high schools.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnother thing that can be very, very, very successful is:
p371
aVthere's a lot of people that may have retired
p372
aVfrom working in the software industry,
p373
aVand they can teach your kid.
p374
aVAnd it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old,
p375
aVbecause what you're doing is you're lighting the spark.
p376
aVYou're getting that kid turned on.
p377
aVAnd you get him turned on, then you'll learn all the new stuff.
p378
aVMentors are just essential.
p379
aVI cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me.
p380
aVAnd we've got to mentor them, hire them.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd if you bring them in for internships in your companies,
p383
aVthe thing about the autism, Asperger-y kind of mind,
p384
aVyou've got to give them a specific task.
p385
aVDon't just say, "Design new software."
p386
aVYou've got to tell them something more specific:
p387
aV"We're designing software for a phone
p388
aVand it has to do some specific thing,
p389
aVand it can only use so much memory."
p390
aVThat's the kind of specificity you need.
p391
aa(lp392
VWell, that's the end of my talk.
p393
aVAnd I just want to thank everybody for coming.
p394
aVIt was great to be here.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Applause)
p397
aV(Applause ends)
p398
aa(lp399
VOh \u2014 you have a question for me? OK.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Applause)
p402
aa(lp403
VChris Anderson: Thank you so much for that.
p404
aVYou know, you once wrote \u2014 I like this quote:
p405
aV"If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth,
p406
aVthen men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire
p407
aVat the entrance to a cave."
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VTemple Grandin: Because who do you think made the first stone spear?
p412
aVIt was the Asperger guy,
p413
aVand if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics,
p414
aVthere'd be no more Silicon Valley, and the energy crisis would not be solved.
p415
aa(lp416
V(Applause)
p417
aa(lp418
VCA: I want to ask you a couple other questions,
p419
aVand if any of these feel inappropriate, it's OK just to say, "Next question."
p420
aVBut if there is someone here who has an autistic child,
p421
aVor knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them,
p422
aVwhat advice would you give them?
p423
aa(lp424
VTG: Well, first of all, we've got to look at age.
p425
aVIf you have a two, three or four-year-old, no speech, no social interaction,
p426
aVI can't emphasize enough: Don't wait.
p427
aVYou need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching.
p428
aVThe thing is, autism comes in different degrees.
p429
aVAbout half of the people on the spectrum are not going to learn to talk,
p430
aVand they won't be working in Silicon Valley.
p431
aVThat would not be a reasonable thing for them to do.
p432
aa(lp433
VBut then you get these smart, geeky kids with a touch of autism,
p434
aVand that's where you've got to get them turned on
p435
aVwith doing interesting things.
p436
aVI got social interaction through shared interests \u2014
p437
aVI rode horses with other kids, I made model rockets with other kids,
p438
aVdid electronics lab with other kids.
p439
aVAnd in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker
p440
aVto make a light show.
p441
aVThat was, like, we considered that super cool.
p442
aa(lp443
V(Laughter)
p444
aa(lp445
VCA: Is it unrealistic for them
p446
aVto hope or think that that child loves them, as some might, as most, wish?
p447
aa(lp448
VTG: Well, I tell you, that child will be loyal,
p449
aVand if your house is burning down, they're going to get you out of it.
p450
aa(lp451
VCA: Wow. So most people, if you ask them what they're most passionate about,
p452
aVthey'd say things like, "My kids" or "My lover."
p453
aVWhat are you most passionate about?
p454
aa(lp455
VTG: I'm passionate about that the things I do
p456
aVare going to make the world a better place.
p457
aVWhen I have a mother of an autistic child say,
p458
aV"My kid went to college because of your book
p459
aVor one of your lectures,"
p460
aVthat makes me happy.
p461
aa(lp462
VYou know, the slaughter plants I worked with in the '80s;
p463
aVthey were absolutely awful.
p464
aVI developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants,
p465
aVwhere you just measure outcomes:
p466
aVHow many cattle fell down?
p467
aVHow many got poked with the prodder?
p468
aVHow many cattle are mooing their heads off?
p469
aVAnd it's very, very simple.
p470
aVYou directly observe a few simple things.
p471
aVIt's worked really well.
p472
aVI get satisfaction out of seeing stuff
p473
aVthat makes real change in the real world.
p474
aVWe need a lot more of that, and a lot less abstract stuff.
p475
aa(lp476
VCA: Totally.
p477
aa(lp478
V(Applause)
p479
aa(lp480
VCA: When we were talking on the phone, one of the things you said
p481
aVthat really astonished me
p482
aVwas that one thing you were passionate about was server farms.
p483
aVTell me about that.
p484
aa(lp485
VTG: Well, the reason why I got really excited when I read about that,
p486
aVit contains knowledge.
p487
aVIt's libraries.
p488
aVAnd to me, knowledge is something that is extremely valuable.
p489
aVSo, maybe over 10 years ago now, our library got flooded.
p490
aVThis is before the Internet got really big.
p491
aVAnd I was really upset about all the books being wrecked,
p492
aVbecause it was knowledge being destroyed.
p493
aVAnd server farms, or data centers, are great libraries of knowledge.
p494
aa(lp495
VCA: Temple, can I just say,
p496
aVit's an absolute delight to have you at TED.
p497
aVThank you so much.
p498
aa(lp499
VTG: Well, thank you so much. Thank you.

VAlmost two years ago,
p5
aVI was driving in my car in Germany,
p6
aVand I turned on the radio.
p7
aVEurope at the time was in the middle
p8
aVof the Euro crisis,
p9
aVand all the headlines were about European countries
p10
aVgetting downgraded by rating agencies
p11
aVin the United States.
p12
aVI listened and thought to myself,
p13
aV"What are these rating agencies,
p14
aVand why is everybody so upset about their work?"
p15
aa(lp16
VWell, if you were sitting
p17
aVnext to me in the car that day
p18
aVand would have told me that I would devote
p19
aVthe next years to trying to reform them,
p20
aVobviously I would have called you crazy.
p21
aVBut guess what's really crazy:
p22
aVthe way these rating agencies are run.
p23
aVAnd I would like to explain to you
p24
aVnot only why it's time to change this,
p25
aVbut also how we can do it.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo let me tell you a little bit
p28
aVabout what rating agencies really do.
p29
aVAs you would read a car magazine
p30
aVbefore purchasing a new car
p31
aVor taking a look at a product review
p32
aVbefore deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get,
p33
aVinvestors are reading ratings
p34
aVbefore they decide in which kind of product
p35
aVthey are investing their money.
p36
aVA rating can range from a so-called AAA,
p37
aVwhich means it's a top-performing product,
p38
aVand it can go down to the level
p39
aVof the so-called BBB-,
p40
aVwhich means it's a fairly risky investment.
p41
aVRating agencies are rating companies.
p42
aVThey are rating banks.
p43
aVThey are rating even financial products
p44
aVlike the infamous mortgage-backed securities.
p45
aVBut they can also rate countries,
p46
aVand these ratings are called sovereign ratings,
p47
aVand I would like to focus in particular
p48
aVon these sovereign ratings.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd I can tell, as you're listening to me right now,
p51
aVyou're thinking,
p52
aVso why should I really care about this, right?
p53
aVBe honest.
p54
aVWell, ratings affect you.
p55
aVThey affect all of us.
p56
aVIf a rating agency rates a country,
p57
aVit basically assesses and evaluates
p58
aVa country's debt
p59
aVand the ability and willingness of a country
p60
aVto repay its debt.
p61
aVSo if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,
p62
aVthe country has to pay more
p63
aVin order to borrow money
p64
aVon the international markets.
p65
aVSo it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,
p66
aVbecause you and your fellow countrymen
p67
aVhave to pony up more in order to borrow.
p68
aVBut what if a country can't afford to pay more
p69
aVbecause it's maybe too expensive?
p70
aVWell, then the country has less available
p71
aVfor other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.
p72
aVAnd this is the reason why you should care,
p73
aVbecause sovereign ratings affect everyone.
p74
aVAnd that is the reason why I believe
p75
aVthey should be defined as public goods.
p76
aVThey should be transparent, accessible,
p77
aVand available to everyone at no cost.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut here's the situation:
p80
aVthe rating agency market is dominated
p81
aVby three players and three players only \u2014
p82
aVStandard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch \u2014
p83
aVand we know whenever there is a market concentration,
p84
aVthere is really no competition.
p85
aVThere is no incentive to improve
p86
aVthe quality of your product.
p87
aVAnd let's face it, the credit rating  agencies have contributed,
p88
aVputting the global economy on the brink,
p89
aVand yet they have to change the way they operate.
p90
aa(lp91
VThe second point,
p92
aVwould you really buy a car
p93
aVjust based on the advice of the dealer?
p94
aVObviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.
p95
aVBut that's actually what's going on
p96
aVin the rating agency sector every single day.
p97
aVThe customers of these rating agencies,
p98
aVlike countries or companies,
p99
aVthey are paying for their own ratings,
p100
aVand obviously this is creating
p101
aVa conflict of interest.
p102
aa(lp103
VThe third point is,
p104
aVthe rating agencies are not really telling us
p105
aVhow they are coming up with their ratings,
p106
aVbut in this day and age,
p107
aVyou can't even sell a candy bar
p108
aVwithout listing everything that's inside.
p109
aVBut for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,
p110
aVwe really do not know
p111
aVwhat all the different ingredients are.
p112
aVWe are allowing the rating agencies
p113
aVto be intransparent about their work,
p114
aVand we need to change this.
p115
aa(lp116
VI think there is no doubt that the sector
p117
aVneeds a complete overhaul,
p118
aVnot just a trimming at the margins.
p119
aVI think it's time for a bold move.
p120
aVI think it's time to upgrade the system.
p121
aVAnd this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation
p122
aVhave invested a lot of time and effort
p123
aVthinking about an alternative for the sector.
p124
aVAnd we have developed the first model
p125
aVfor a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,
p126
aVand we call it by its acronym, INCRA.
p127
aa(lp128
VINCRA would make a difference
p129
aVto the current system
p130
aVby adding another nonprofit player to the mix.
p131
aVIt would be based on a nonprofit model
p132
aVthat would be based on a sustainable endowment.
p133
aVThe endowment would create income
p134
aVthat would allow us to run the operation,
p135
aVto run the rating agency,
p136
aVand it would also allow us
p137
aVto make our ratings publicly available.
p138
aVBut this is not enough to make a difference, right?
p139
aVINCRA would also be based on
p140
aVa very, very clear governance structure
p141
aVthat would avoid any conflict of interest,
p142
aVand it would include many stakeholders from society.
p143
aVINCRA would not only be a European
p144
aVor an American rating agency,
p145
aVit would be a truly international one,
p146
aVin which, in particular, the emerging economies
p147
aVwould have an equal interest,  voice and representation.
p148
aa(lp149
VThe second big difference that INCRA would make is
p150
aVthat would it base its sovereign risk assessment
p151
aVon a broader set of indicators.
p152
aVThink about it that way.
p153
aVIf we conduct a sovereign rating,
p154
aVwe basically take a look at
p155
aVthe economic soil of a country,
p156
aVits macroeconomic fundamentals.
p157
aVBut we also have to ask the question,
p158
aVwho is cultivating the economic soil
p159
aVof a country, right?
p160
aVWell, a country has many gardeners,
p161
aVand one of them is the government,
p162
aVso we have to ask the question,
p163
aVhow is a country governed?
p164
aVHow is it managed?
p165
aVAnd this is the reason why we have developed
p166
aVwhat we call forward-looking indicators.
p167
aVThese are indicators that give you
p168
aVa much better read about
p169
aVthe socioeconomic development of a country.
p170
aVI hope you would agree it's important for you to know
p171
aVif your government is willing to invest  in renewable energy and education.
p172
aVIt's important for you to know
p173
aVif the government of your country
p174
aVis able to manage a crisis,
p175
aVif the government is finally able to implement
p176
aVthe reforms that it's promised.
p177
aVFor example, if INCRA would rate
p178
aVSouth Africa right now,
p179
aVof course we would take a very, very close look
p180
aVat the youth unemployment of the country,
p181
aVthe highest in the world.
p182
aVIf over 70 percent of a country's population
p183
aVunder the age of 35 is unemployed,
p184
aVof course this has a huge impact on the economy
p185
aVtoday and even more so in the future.
p186
aVWell, our friends at Moody's,
p187
aVStandard & Poor's, and Fitch will tell us
p188
aVwe would take this into account as well.
p189
aVBut guess what? We do not know
p190
aVexactly how they will take this into account.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd this leads me to the third big difference
p193
aVthat INCRA would make.
p194
aVINCRA would not only release its ratings
p195
aVbut it would also release its indicators
p196
aVand methodology.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo in contrast to the current system,
p199
aVINCRA would be fully transparent.
p200
aVSo in a nutshell,
p201
aVINCRA would offer an alternative
p202
aVto the current system of the big three rating agencies
p203
aVby adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix
p204
aVthat would increase the competition,
p205
aVit would increase the transparency of the sector,
p206
aVand it would also increase the quality.
p207
aa(lp208
VI can tell that sovereign ratings
p209
aVmay still look to you like this very small piece
p210
aVof this very complex global financial world,
p211
aVbut I tell you it's a very important one,
p212
aVand a very important one to fix,
p213
aVbecause sovereign ratings affect all of us,
p214
aVand they should be addressed and should be defined
p215
aVas public goods.
p216
aVAnd this is why we are testing our model right now,
p217
aVand why we are trying to find out if it can
p218
aVbring together a group of able and willing actors
p219
aVto bring INCRA to life.
p220
aVI truly believe building up INCRA
p221
aVis in everyone's interest,
p222
aVand that we have the unique opportunity right now
p223
aVto turn INCRA into a cornerstone
p224
aVof a new, more inclusive financial system.
p225
aVBecause for way too long,
p226
aVwe have left the big financial players on their own.
p227
aVIt's time to give them some company.
p228
aa(lp229
VThank you.

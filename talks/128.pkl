VI'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it.
p5
aVProbably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk.
p6
aVShortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner
p7
aVwith the family. The conversation turned to global warming,
p8
aVand everybody agreed, there's a real problem.
p9
aVWe've got a climate crisis.
p10
aVSo, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.
p11
aVThe conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.
p12
aVShe said, "I agree with everything that's been said.
p13
aVI'm scared and I'm angry." And then she turned to me and said,
p14
aV"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it." Wow.
p15
aVAll the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVI didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is,
p18
aV"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response."
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVAnd we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate
p21
aVthis problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences,
p22
aVwe must act, and we must act decisively.
p23
aVI've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more,
p26
aVto try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes.
p27
aVWe went to Brazil. We went to China and to India,
p28
aVto Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento.
p29
aVAnd so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you
p30
aVabout what we've learned in those journeys.
p31
aVBecause the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.
p32
aVYou know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers,
p33
aVand so when we see a big problem or an opportunity
p34
aVlike avian flu or personalized medicine,
p35
aVwe just get together the smartest people we know.
p36
aVFor this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really,
p37
aVof superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs
p38
aVand business leaders. Fifty or so of them.
p39
aVAnd so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that
p40
aVand four lessons I've learned in the last year.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe first lesson is that companies are really powerful,
p43
aVand that matters a lot. This is a story about
p44
aVhow Wal-Mart went green, and what that means.
p45
aVTwo years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is
p46
aVthe next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority.
p47
aVThey committed that they're going to take their existing stores
p48
aVand reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent,
p49
aVand their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.
p50
aVThe three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating
p51
aVand air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration.
p52
aVSo, look what they did.
p53
aVThey painted the roofs of all their stores white.
p54
aVThey put smart skylights through their stores
p55
aVso they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.
p56
aVAnd, third, they put the refrigerated goods
p57
aVbehind closed doors with LED lighting.
p58
aVI mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store?
p59
aVThese are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.
p60
aa(lp61
VWhy does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive.
p62
aVThey're the largest private employer in America.
p63
aVThey're the largest private user of electricity.
p64
aVThey have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road.
p65
aVAnd they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains,
p66
aV60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country,
p67
aVit would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.
p68
aVAnd maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.
p69
aa(lp70
VWhen Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable,
p71
aVit has a powerful impact on other great institutions.
p72
aVSo, let me tell you this:
p73
aVwhen Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions,
p74
aVthat's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough.
p75
aVWe need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe second thing that we learned is that individuals matter,
p78
aVand they matter enormously.
p79
aVI've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK?
p80
aVWal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers.
p81
aVThat's a third of the U.S. population.
p82
aV65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year.
p83
aVAnd Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell
p84
aVanother 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy.
p85
aVConsumers don't really like these light bulbs.
p86
aVThe light's kind of funny, they won't dim,
p87
aVtakes a while for them to start up.
p88
aVBut the pay-off is really enormous.
p89
aV100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means
p90
aVthat we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills,
p91
aVand 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out.
p92
aVIt does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.
p93
aVIt is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic
p94
aVto haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall.
p95
aVIt's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles
p96
aVin Fiji and ship it here.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VIt's hard to change consumer behavior
p100
aVbecause consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know?
p101
aVDo you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here?
p102
aVI don't know, and I should.
p103
aVThose of us who care about all this would act better
p104
aVif we knew what the real costs were.
p105
aVBut as long as we pretend that CO2 is free,
p106
aVas long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?
p107
aVI'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes
p108
aVwe can reasonably expect from individuals
p109
aVare going to be clearly not enough.
p110
aa(lp111
VThe third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters.
p112
aVIn fact, policy is paramount.
p113
aVI've got a behind-the-scenes story for you
p114
aVabout that green tech network I described.
p115
aVAt the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about
p116
aVwhat the action items would be, how we'd follow up.
p117
aVAnd Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up.
p118
aVYou know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.
p119
aVWell, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now
p120
aVis to make it clear in Sacramento, California
p121
aVthat we need a market-based system of mandates
p122
aVthat's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.
p123
aVIt's necessary and, just as important,
p124
aVit's good for the California economy.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met
p127
aVwith the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.
p128
aVYou know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill,
p129
aVso it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.
p130
aV(Applause)
p131
aVPlease. Thank you.
p132
aVI think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why?
p133
aVBecause California was the first state in this country
p134
aVto mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.
p135
aVAnd the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs,
p136
aVfour billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions
p137
aVby 174 million tons a year.
p138
aVCalifornia emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions.
p139
aVIt's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start,
p140
aVbut I've got to tell you \u2014 where I started \u2014 I'm really afraid.
p141
aVIn fact, I'm certain California's not enough.
p142
aa(lp143
VHere's a story about national policy that we could all learn from.
p144
aVYou know Tom Friedman says, "If you don't go, you don't know"?
p145
aVWell, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg.
p146
aVHe's the father of the ethanol revolution.
p147
aVHe told us that Brazil's government mandated
p148
aVthat every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.
p149
aVAnd they mandated that their new vehicles
p150
aVwould be flex-fuel compatible, right?
p151
aVThey'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline.
p152
aVAnd so, here's what's happened in Brazil.
p153
aVThey now have 29,000 ethanol pumps \u2014
p154
aVthis versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California \u2014
p155
aVand in three years their new car fleet
p156
aVhas gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel.
p157
aVCompare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel.
p158
aVAnd you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it.
p159
aVSo, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced
p160
aV40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol.
p161
aVThat's 59 billion dollars since 1975
p162
aVthat they didn't ship to the Middle East.
p163
aVIt's created a million jobs inside that country,
p164
aVand it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.
p165
aVThat's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.
p166
aVBut Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission.
p167
aVSo, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough.
p168
aVIn fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have
p169
aVare not going to be enough.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe fourth and final lesson we've learned
p172
aVis about the potential of radical innovation.
p173
aVSo, I want to tell you about a tragic problem
p174
aVand a breakthrough technology.
p175
aVEvery year a million and a half people die of
p176
aVa completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day.
p177
aVAll for want of two dollars' worth of medications
p178
aVthat we can buy at the corner drugstore.
p179
aVWell, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.
p180
aVSo, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars
p181
aVfrom the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way
p182
aVto make the key ingredient, called artemisinin,
p183
aVand they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.
p184
aVAnd in doing so, they'll save a million lives \u2014
p185
aVat least a million lives a year. A million lives.
p186
aVTheir breakthrough technology is synthetic biology.
p187
aVThis leverages millions of years of evolution
p188
aVby redesigning bugs to make really useful products.
p189
aVNow, what you do is, you get inside the microbe,
p190
aVyou change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow, you may ask,
p193
aVJohn, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis?
p194
aVWell, I'll tell you \u2014 a lot.
p195
aVWe've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology
p196
aVthat they're using can be used to make better biofuels.
p197
aVDon't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.
p198
aVThat means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain
p199
aVand optimize them along the way.
p200
aVSo, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats
p201
aVthat are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.
p202
aVI guess that's better living through bugs.
p203
aVAlan Kay is famous for saying
p204
aVthe best way to predict the future is to invent it.
p205
aVAnd, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say
p206
aVthe second best way is to finance it.
p207
aVAnd that's why we're investing 200 million dollars
p208
aVin a wide range of really disruptive new technologies
p209
aVfor innovation in green technologies.
p210
aVAnd we're encouraging others to do it as well.
p211
aVWe're talking a lot about this.
p212
aa(lp213
VIn 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies
p214
aVof the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.
p215
aVBut I'm really afraid we need much, much more.
p216
aVFor reference, fact one:
p217
aVExxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day.
p218
aVDo you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D?
p219
aVSecond fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy
p220
aVis barely a billion dollars in total.
p221
aVLess than one day of Exxon's revenues.
p222
aVThird fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy
p223
aVin hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs
p224
aVfor the next thousand years. And the federal budget
p225
aVcalls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&D in geothermal energy.
p226
aVIt is almost criminal that we are not investing more
p227
aVin energy research in this country.
p228
aVAnd I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.
p231
aVWho would have thought that a mass retailer
p232
aVcould make money by going green? Who would have thought that
p233
aVa database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation?
p234
aVWho would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle
p235
aVwould come from a developing country in South America?
p236
aVAnd who would have thought that scientists
p237
aVtrying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels?
p238
aVAnd who would have thought that all that is not enough?
p239
aVNot enough to stabilize the climate.
p240
aVNot enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.
p241
aVThe scientists tell us \u2014 and they're only guessing \u2014
p242
aVthat we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half,
p243
aVand do it as fast as possible.
p244
aVNow, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.,
p245
aVbut I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere,
p246
aVand so somehow we're going to have to find the political will
p247
aVto do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China.
p248
aa(lp249
VTo size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons;
p250
aVthe U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means
p251
aVwe'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.
p252
aVThat's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.
p253
aVAnd if it's business as usual, we're going out of business.
p254
aVWhen I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed
p255
aVabout their CO2 strategy, and he said the following,
p256
aV"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese."
p257
aVThen he asked, "Why should China sacrifice our growth
p258
aVso that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?"
p259
aVDoes anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.
p260
aVWe've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations
p261
aVmake the right outcome, the profitable outcome,
p262
aVand therefore the likely outcome.
p263
aVEnergy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.
p264
aVIt is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?
p265
aa(lp266
VWell, I'll tell you what. Green technologies \u2014 going green \u2014
p267
aVis bigger than the Internet.
p268
aVIt could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.
p269
aVMoreover, if we succeed, it's going to be
p270
aVthe most important transformation for life on the planet since,
p271
aVas Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere.
p272
aVNow, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's
p273
aVcompanies and individuals and policies and innovation
p274
aVis not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know.
p275
aVEveryone here cares about changing the world
p276
aVand has made a difference in that one way or another.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo, our call to action \u2014 my call to you \u2014
p279
aVis for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig.
p280
aVWhat can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral.
p281
aVGo to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com
p282
aVand buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating,
p283
aVlobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions.
p284
aVThere's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd the most important thing you can do, I think,
p287
aVis to use your personal power and your Rolodex
p288
aVto lead your business, your institution, in going green.
p289
aVDo it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green
p290
aVfor its customers and its suppliers and for itself.
p291
aVReally think outside the box.
p292
aVCan you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google
p293
aVor Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen?
p294
aVIt could be bigger than Wal-Mart.
p295
aVI can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis.
p296
aVAnd I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy,
p297
aVall of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem.
p298
aVBecause if we do, I can look forward
p299
aVto the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.

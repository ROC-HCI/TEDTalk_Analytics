VHi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.
p5
aVAnd usually when I tell people I'm an artist,
p6
aVthey just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"
p7
aVor "What kind of medium do you work in?"
p8
aVWell most of my work that I work with
p9
aVis really a little bit about methodologies of working
p10
aVrather than actually a specific discipline
p11
aVor a specific technique.
p12
aVSo what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.
p13
aVAnd I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.
p14
aVSo let me show you a little of that.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo it started over here.
p17
aVAnd this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.
p18
aVI was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.
p19
aVAnd as I was coming back,
p20
aVwell I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent,
p21
aVand went into a little room
p22
aVand he asked me all sorts of questions \u2014
p23
aV"Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?
p24
aVWhy were you there? Who pays for your trips?" \u2014
p25
aVall these little details.
p26
aVAnd then literally just out of nowhere,
p27
aVthe guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?"
p28
aVAnd when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?"
p29
aVor any date for that fact,
p30
aVit's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."
p31
aa(lp32
VSo I pulled out my little PDA,
p33
aVand I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."
p34
aVI had September 12th \u2014 from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.
p35
aVFrom 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.
p36
aVFrom 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class,
p37
aV3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.
p38
aV"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?"
p39
aV"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?"
p40
aV"Where were you October 5th?"
p41
aVWe read about six months of my calendar.
p42
aVAnd I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records
p43
aVof what I did.
p44
aVBut good thing I did,
p45
aVbecause I don't look good in orange.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo he asked me \u2014
p50
aV(Applause)
p51
aV"So this storage unit that you paid the rent on,
p52
aVwhat did you have in it?"
p53
aVThis was in Tampa, Florida,
p54
aVso I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.
p55
aVFurniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.
p56
aVJust assorted garage sale junk,
p57
aVbecause I'm a pack rat."
p58
aVAnd he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?"
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aVI was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.
p61
aVAnd if there were, I would have remembered that one."
p62
aVAnd he's still a little confused,
p63
aVbut I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes
p64
aVrealizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat.
p65
aVAnd so we're sitting there,
p66
aVand eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth,
p67
aVhe says, "Okay, I have enough information here.
p68
aVI'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.
p69
aVThey'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it."
p70
aVI was like, "Great."
p71
aa(lp72
VSo I got home and the phone rings,
p73
aVand a man introduced himself.
p74
aVBasically this is the FBI offices in Tampa
p75
aVwhere I spent six months of my life \u2014
p76
aVback and forth, not six months continuously.
p77
aVBy the way, you folks know that in the United States,
p78
aVyou can't take photographs of federal buildings,
p79
aVbut Google can do it for you.
p80
aVSo to the folks from Google, thank you.
p81
aV(Applause)
p82
aVSo I spent a lot of time in this building.
p83
aVQuestions like:
p84
aV"Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act
p85
aVthat may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?"
p86
aVAnd you also have to consider the state of mind you're in
p87
aVwhen you're doing this.
p88
aVYou're basically face-to-face with someone
p89
aVthat essentially decides life or death.
p90
aVOr questions such as \u2014 actually, during the polygraph,
p91
aVwhich was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them \u2014
p92
aa(lp93
Vone of the polygraph questions was ...
p94
aVwell the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes."
p95
aV"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."
p96
aVBecause you have to base it on a yes or no.
p97
aVThen, of course, the next question is:
p98
aV"Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"
p99
aVI work at a university.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVSo I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."
p102
aVBut they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed,
p103
aVdo you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"
p104
aVI was like, "No."
p105
aa(lp106
VSo at the end of six months of this
p107
aVand nine consecutive polygraphs,
p108
aVthey said, "Hey, everything's fine."
p109
aVI was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.
p110
aVI know everything's fine."
p111
aVSo they're looking at me really odd.
p112
aVAnd it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot."
p113
aVThis is with the FBI.
p114
aVAnd I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo,
p115
aVand here we go all over again."
p116
aVAnd there was a sincere concern there.
p117
aVAnd he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble,
p118
aVgive us a call \u2014 we'll take care of it."
p119
aa(lp120
VSo ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.
p121
aVI would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.
p122
aVNorthwest flight seven coming into Seattle
p123
aVon March 12th" or whatever.
p124
aVA couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.
p125
aVIt wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.
p126
aVJust wanted to say, "Hey guys.
p127
aVDon't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves."
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aV"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.
p130
aVJust letting you know. Heads up."
p131
aVAnd so I just kept doing this over and over and over.
p132
aVAnd then the phone calls turned into emails,
p133
aVand the emails got longer and longer and longer ...
p134
aVwith pictures,
p135
aVwith travel tips.
p136
aVThen I'd make websites.
p137
aVAnd then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo I actually designed this back in 2003.
p140
aVSo this kind of tracks me at any given moment.
p141
aVI wrote some code for my mobile phone.
p142
aVBasically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.
p143
aVBut I'll watch myself. It's okay.
p144
aVYou don't have to waste your energy or your resources.
p145
aVAnd I'll help you out.
p146
aVSo in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?
p147
aVWell they probably have all my flight records,
p148
aVso I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.
p149
aVSo you can see, Delta 1252
p150
aVgoing from Kansas City to Atlanta.
p151
aVAnd then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.
p152
aVThis was on Delta 719
p153
aVgoing from JFK to San Francisco.
p154
aVSee that? They won't let me on a plane with that,
p155
aVbut they'll give it to me on the plane.
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVThese are the airports that I hang out in,
p158
aVbecause I like airports.
p159
aVThat's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.
p160
aVThis is in Warsaw.
p161
aVSingapore. You can see, they're kind of empty.
p162
aa(lp163
VThese images are shot really anonymously
p164
aVto the point where it could be anyone.
p165
aVBut if you can cross-reference this with the other data,
p166
aVthen you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent
p167
aVand putting it all together.
p168
aVAnd when you're in a situation
p169
aVwhere you have to justify every moment of your existence,
p170
aVyou're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.
p171
aVAt the time that this was going on,
p172
aVthe last thing on my mind was "art project."
p173
aVI was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.
p174
aVBut after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?
p175
aVAnd after piecing together this, this and this,
p176
aVthis way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself
p177
aVeventually evolved into this,
p178
aVand it actually became this project.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo these are the stores that I shop in \u2014 some of them \u2014
p181
aVbecause they need to know.
p182
aVThis is me buying some duck flavored paste
p183
aVat the Ranch 99 in Daly City
p184
aVon Sunday, November 15th.
p185
aVAt Coreana Supermarket
p186
aVbuying my kimchi because I like kimchi.
p187
aVAnd I bought some crabs too right around there,
p188
aVand some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.
p189
aVAnd laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland \u2014
p190
aVEast Oakland, sorry.
p191
aVAnd then my pickled jellyfish
p192
aVat the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.
p193
aVNow if you go to my bank records,
p194
aVit'll actually show something from there,
p195
aVso you know that, on May 9th,
p196
aVthat I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo not only that I'm giving this information here and there,
p199
aVbut now there's a third party,
p200
aVan independent third party, my bank,
p201
aVthat's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.
p202
aVSo there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.
p203
aVAnd there's a verification taking place.
p204
aVSometimes they're really small purchases.
p205
aVSo 34 cents foreign transaction fee.
p206
aVAll of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts,
p207
aVand everything pops up right away.
p208
aa(lp209
VSometimes there's a lot of information.
p210
aVThis is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.
p211
aVAnd then sometimes you get this.
p212
aVSometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City,
p213
aVJanuary 22nd.
p214
aVAnd I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was,
p215
aVbecause this is what I had to do with the FBI.
p216
aVI had to tell them every little detail of everything.
p217
aVI spend a lot of time on the road.
p218
aVThis is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada
p219
aVoff of Route 80
p220
aVat 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.
p221
aVI spend a lot of time in gas stations too \u2014 empty train stations.
p222
aVSo there's multiple databases.
p223
aVAnd there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.
p224
aVThere's actually 46,000 images right now on my site,
p225
aVand the FBI has seen all of them \u2014
p226
aVat least I trust they've seen all of them.
p227
aVAnd then sometimes you don't get much information at all,
p228
aVyou just get this empty bed.
p229
aVAnd sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.
p230
aVSo you get something like this.
p231
aVThis, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California \u2014
p232
aVVietnamese sandwich.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo there's different categorizations
p235
aVof meals eaten outside
p236
aVempty train stations, empty gas stations.
p237
aVThese are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.
p238
aVSo how do you know these are meals eaten at home?
p239
aVWell the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.
p240
aVSo again, you have to do some detective work here.
p241
aVSo sometimes the databases get so specific.
p242
aVThese are all tacos eaten in Mexico City
p243
aVnear a train station
p244
aVon July fifth to July sixth.
p245
aVAt 11:39 a.m. was this one.
p246
aVAt 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.
p247
aVSo I time-stamp my life every few moments.
p248
aVEvery few moments I shoot the image.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow it's all done on my iPhone,
p251
aVand it all goes straight up to my server,
p252
aVand my server does all the backend work
p253
aVand categorizes things and puts everything together.
p254
aVThey need to know where I'm doing my business,
p255
aVbecause they want to know about my business.
p256
aVSo on December 4th, I went here.
p257
aVAnd on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 \u2014
p258
aVthis was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon
p259
aVin Skowhegan, Maine \u2014 this was my apartment there.
p260
aVSo what you're basically seeing here
p261
aVis all bits and pieces and all this information.
p262
aa(lp263
VIf you go to my site, there's tons of things.
p264
aVAnd really, it's not the most user-friendly interface.
p265
aVIt's actually quite user-unfriendly.
p266
aVAnd one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness,
p267
aVis that everything is there,
p268
aVbut you have to really work through it.
p269
aVSo by me putting all this information out there,
p270
aVwhat I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.
p271
aVBut in this barrage of noise
p272
aVthat I'm putting out,
p273
aVI actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.
p274
aVAnd you know very little about me actually.
p275
aVAnd really so I've come to the conclusion
p276
aVthat the way you protect your privacy,
p277
aVparticularly in an era where everything is cataloged
p278
aVand everything is archived and everything is recorded,
p279
aVthere's no need to delete information anymore.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo what do you do when everything is out there?
p282
aVWell you have to take control over it.
p283
aVAnd if I give you this information directly,
p284
aVit's a very different type of identity
p285
aVthan if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.
p286
aVThe other thing that's also interesting that's going on here
p287
aVis the fact that intelligence agencies \u2014
p288
aVand it doesn't matter who they are \u2014
p289
aVthey all operate in an industry
p290
aVwhere their commodity is information,
p291
aVor restricted access to information.
p292
aVAnd the reason their information has any value
p293
aVis, well, because no one else has access to it.
p294
aVAnd by me cutting out the middle man
p295
aVand giving it straight to you,
p296
aVthe information that the FBI has has no value,
p297
aVso thus devaluing their currency.
p298
aVAnd I understand that, on an individual level,
p299
aVit's purely symbolic.
p300
aVBut if 300 million people in the U.S.
p301
aVstarted doing this,
p302
aVwe would have to redesign the entire intelligence system
p303
aVfrom the ground up.
p304
aVBecause it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.
p305
aVAnd we're getting to that.
p306
aa(lp307
VWhen I first started this project,
p308
aVpeople were looking at me and saying,
p309
aV"Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?
p310
aVWhy are you posting these photos?"
p311
aVThis was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere
p312
aVand 750 million people
p313
aVwere posting status messages
p314
aVor poking people.
p315
aVSo in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.
p316
aVI'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete,
p317
aVbecause you're all doing it.
p318
aVThis is something that we all are doing on a daily basis,
p319
aVwhether we're aware of it or not.
p320
aVSo we're creating our own archives and so on.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd you know, some of my friends have always said,
p323
aV"Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?
p324
aVBecause no one's really watching.
p325
aVNo one's really going to bother you."
p326
aVSo one of the things that I do
p327
aVis I actually look through my server logs very carefully.
p328
aVBecause it's about surveillance.
p329
aVI'm watching who's watching me.
p330
aVAnd I came up with these.
p331
aVSo these are some of my sample logs.
p332
aVAnd just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.
p333
aVAnd I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.
p334
aVSo you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by \u2014
p335
aVDepartment of Homeland Security.
p336
aVYou can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.
p337
aVI actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.
p338
aVCentral Intelligence Agency.
p339
aVExecutive Office of the President.
p340
aVNot really sure why they show up, but they do.
p341
aVI think they kind of like to look at art.
p342
aVAnd I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo thank you very much. I appreciate it.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Applause)
p347
aa(lp348
VBruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious.
p349
aVYou said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone,"
p350
aVbut actually you do take the pictures and put on information.
p351
aVSo how many hours of the day does that take?
p352
aa(lp353
VHE: Almost none.
p354
aVIt's no different
p355
aVthan sending a text.
p356
aVIt's no different than checking an email.
p357
aVIt's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.
p358
aVSo it's just become another day.
p359
aVI mean, when we update a status message,
p360
aVwe don't really think about how long that's going to take.
p361
aVSo it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks,
p362
aVsend, and then it's done.
p363
aVAnd everything's automated at the other end.
p364
aa(lp365
VBG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy?
p366
aa(lp367
VHE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.
p368
aVSo it holds onto the very last point.
p369
aVSo if I'm on a 12-hour flight,
p370
aVyou'll see the last airport that I departed from.
p371
aa(lp372
VBG: Hasan, thank you very much. (HE: Thank you.)

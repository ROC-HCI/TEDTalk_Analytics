p2
(lp3
(lp4
V18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,
p5
aVso I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point
p6
aVwhere I get this thing to work.
p7
aVHere we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.
p8
aVI'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.
p9
aVI'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,
p10
aVand actually talk about this a bit more than we do.
p11
aVI'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.
p12
aVI'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic
p13
aVabout doing anything about aging.
p14
aVAnd then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk
p15
aVtalking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,
p16
aVnamely, by actually doing something about it.
p17
aa(lp18
VI'm going to do that in two steps.
p19
aVThe first one I'm going to talk about is
p20
aVhow to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension \u2014
p21
aVwhich I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people
p22
aVwho are already in middle-age when you start \u2014
p23
aVto a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.
p24
aVNamely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between
p25
aVhow old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year \u2014
p26
aVor indeed, to get sick in the first place.
p27
aVAnd of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about
p28
aVis how to reach that intermediate step,
p29
aVthat point of maybe 30 years life extension.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo I'm going to start with why we should.
p32
aVNow, I want to ask a question.
p33
aVHands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?
p34
aVThat was easy. OK.
p35
aVOK. Hands up: anyone in the audience
p36
aVwho's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?
p37
aVOK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.
p38
aVThat's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
p39
aVNow the thing is, I would like to put it to you
p40
aVthat the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing
p41
aVis because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
p42
aVAnd here is that characteristic.
p43
aVThe only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, I like in an audience, in Britain especially,
p46
aVto talk about the comparison with foxhunting,
p47
aVwhich is something that was banned after a long struggle,
p48
aVby the government not very many months ago.
p49
aVI mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here,
p50
aVbut, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.
p51
aVAnd this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.
p52
aVYou know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know,
p53
aVcity boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.
p54
aVIt's a traditional part of the way of life,
p55
aVand we should be allowed to carry on doing it.
p56
aVIt's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."
p57
aVBut ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,
p58
aVbecause the majority of the British public,
p59
aVand certainly the majority of members of Parliament,
p60
aVcame to the conclusion that it was really something
p61
aVthat should not be tolerated in a civilized society.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd I think that human aging shares
p64
aVall of these characteristics in spades.
p65
aVWhat part of this do people not understand?
p66
aVIt's not just about life, of course \u2014
p67
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p68
aVit's about healthy life, you know \u2014
p69
aVgetting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,
p70
aVwhether or not dying may be fun.
p71
aVSo really, this is how I would like to describe it.
p72
aVIt's a global trance.
p73
aVThese are the sorts of unbelievable excuses
p74
aVthat people give for aging.
p75
aVAnd, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying
p76
aVthat these excuses are completely valueless.
p77
aVThere are some good points to be made here,
p78
aVthings that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning
p79
aVso that nothing goes too \u2014 well, so that we minimize
p80
aVthe turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut these are completely crazy, when you actually
p83
aVremember your sense of proportion.
p84
aVYou know, these are arguments; these are things that
p85
aVwould be legitimate to be concerned about.
p86
aVBut the question is, are they so dangerous \u2014
p87
aVthese risks of doing something about aging \u2014
p88
aVthat they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,
p89
aVnamely, leaving aging as it is?
p90
aVAre these so bad that they outweigh
p91
aVcondemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?
p92
aVYou know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,
p93
aVthen just don't waste my time, is what I say.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, there is one argument
p97
aVthat some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.
p98
aVPeople worry about overpopulation; they say,
p99
aV"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of,
p100
aVor at least the death toll is going to be much lower,
p101
aVonly from crossing St. Giles carelessly.
p102
aVAnd therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids,
p103
aVand kids are really important to most people."
p104
aVAnd that's true.
p105
aVAnd you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,
p106
aVand give answers like this.
p107
aVI don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.
p108
aVI think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.
p109
aVWe will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,
p110
aVor a high death rate.
p111
aVA high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,
p112
aVin favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd, I say that that's fine \u2014
p115
aVthe future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.
p116
aVWhat's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.
p117
aVIf we vacillate, hesitate,
p118
aVand do not actually develop these therapies,
p119
aVthen we are condemning a whole cohort of people \u2014
p120
aVwho would have been young enough and healthy enough
p121
aVto benefit from those therapies, but will not be,
p122
aVbecause we haven't developed them as quickly as we could \u2014
p123
aVwe'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,
p124
aVand I consider that that is immoral.
p125
aVThat's my answer to the overpopulation question.
p126
aa(lp127
VRight. So the next thing is,
p128
aVnow why should we get a little bit more active on this?
p129
aVAnd the fundamental answer is that
p130
aVthe pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
p131
aVIt's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
p132
aVAging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,
p133
aVwe've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,
p134
aVand it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.
p135
aVLike, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons
p136
aVwhy aging is actually a good thing after all.
p137
aVBut of course, that only works when we have both of these components.
p138
aVAnd as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear \u2014
p139
aVand we might be in range of doing something about aging \u2014
p140
aVthis becomes part of the problem.
p141
aVThis pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.
p142
aVAnd that's why we have to really talk about this a lot \u2014
p143
aVevangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot \u2014
p144
aVin order to get people's attention, and make people realize
p145
aVthat they are in a trance in this regard.
p146
aVSo that's all I'm going to say about that.
p147
aa(lp148
VI'm now going to talk about feasibility.
p149
aVAnd the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable
p150
aVis summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.
p151
aVA very simple definition.
p152
aVAging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,
p153
aVwhich is to say, metabolism.
p154
aVThis is not a completely tautological statement;
p155
aVit's a reasonable statement.
p156
aVAging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,
p157
aVand it also happens to us,
p158
aVdespite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,
p159
aVbecause those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo basically, metabolism, which is defined as
p162
aVbasically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,
p163
aVhas side effects.
p164
aVThose side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.
p165
aVThat's a fine definition. So we can put it this way:
p166
aVwe can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.
p167
aVAnd there are really two games in town,
p168
aVaccording to most people, with regard to postponing aging.
p169
aVThey're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."
p170
aVThe geriatrician will intervene late in the day,
p171
aVwhen pathology is becoming evident,
p172
aVand the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,
p173
aVand stop the accumulation of side effects
p174
aVfrom causing the pathology quite so soon.
p175
aVOf course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle,
p176
aVbecause the things that are causing the pathology
p177
aVare becoming more abundant as time goes on.
p178
aa(lp179
VThe gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface,
p180
aVbecause, you know, prevention is better than cure.
p181
aVBut unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.
p182
aVIn fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work \u2014
p183
aVeven cells we're not really too good on yet.
p184
aVWe've discovered things like, for example,
p185
aVRNA interference only a few years ago,
p186
aVand this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.
p187
aVBasically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,
p188
aVbut it is not an approach whose time has come
p189
aVwhen we're talking about intervention.
p190
aVSo then, what do we do about that?
p191
aVI mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,
p192
aVpretty ironclad, doesn't it?
p193
aa(lp194
VBut it isn't.
p195
aVBefore I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit
p196
aVinto what I'm calling step two.
p197
aVJust suppose, as I said, that we do acquire \u2014
p198
aVlet's say we do it today for the sake of argument \u2014
p199
aVthe ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life
p200
aVon people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.
p201
aVI'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.
p202
aVWhat would that actually mean
p203
aVfor how long people of various ages today \u2014
p204
aVor equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive \u2014
p205
aVwould actually live?
p206
aVIn order to answer that question \u2014 you might think it's simple,
p207
aVbut it's not simple.
p208
aVWe can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies,
p209
aVthen they'll live 30 years longer."
p210
aVThat's the wrong answer.
p211
aVAnd the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.
p212
aa(lp213
VThere are two sorts of technological progress really,
p214
aVfor this purpose.
p215
aVThere are fundamental, major breakthroughs,
p216
aVand there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.
p217
aVNow, they differ a great deal
p218
aVin terms of the predictability of time frames.
p219
aVFundamental breakthroughs:
p220
aVvery hard to predict how long it's going to take
p221
aVto make a fundamental breakthrough.
p222
aVIt was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,
p223
aVand it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.
p224
aVBut after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.
p225
aVI think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened
p226
aVin the progression of the technology of powered flight.
p227
aVWe can think, really, that each one is sort of
p228
aVbeyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.
p229
aVThe incremental advances have added up to something
p230
aVwhich is not incremental anymore.
p231
aa(lp232
VThis is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.
p233
aVAnd you see it in all sorts of technologies.
p234
aVComputers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,
p235
aVhappening of course a bit later.
p236
aVYou can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics \u2014
p237
aVyou know, the same sort of time frame.
p238
aVSo I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,
p239
aVisn't a step at all.
p240
aVThat in fact, the people who are young enough
p241
aVto benefit from these first therapies
p242
aVthat give this moderate amount of life extension,
p243
aVeven though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,
p244
aVwill be at some sort of cusp.
p245
aVThey will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments
p246
aVthat will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.
p247
aVIn other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
p248
aVThe therapies will be improving faster than
p249
aVthe remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.
p250
aa(lp251
VThis is a very important point for me to get across.
p252
aVBecause, you know, most people, when they hear
p253
aVthat I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,
p254
aVthey think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades
p255
aVthat are so thoroughly eliminating aging
p256
aVthat those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.
p257
aVI'm not saying that at all.
p258
aVI'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies
p259
aVwill be enough.
p260
aVThey'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things
p261
aVthat 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.
p262
aVAnd the same for 300 and 400 and so on.
p263
aVI decided to give this a little name,
p264
aVwhich is "longevity escape velocity."
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aVWell, it seems to get the point across.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live,
p269
aVin terms of remaining life expectancy,
p270
aVas measured by their health,
p271
aVfor given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.
p272
aVIf you're already 100, or even if you're 80 \u2014
p273
aVand an average 80-year-old,
p274
aVwe probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,
p275
aVbecause you're too close to death's door
p276
aVfor the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.
p277
aVYou won't be able to withstand them.
p278
aVBut if you're only 50, then there's a chance
p279
aVthat you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know \u2014
p280
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p281
aVeventually get through this
p282
aVand start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,
p283
aVin terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,
p284
aVand in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.
p285
aVAnd of course, if you're a bit younger than that,
p286
aVthen you're never really even going
p287
aVto get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old \u2014
p290
aVwe don't know how old that person is today,
p291
aVbecause we don't know how long it's going to take
p292
aVto get these first-generation therapies.
p293
aVBut irrespective of that age,
p294
aVI'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 \u2014
p295
aVsubject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes \u2014
p296
aVis actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.
p297
aVAnd that's quite a thought.
p298
aa(lp299
VAlright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk,
p300
aVmy last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;
p301
aVnamely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension
p302
aVthat will allow us to get to escape velocity?
p303
aVAnd in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.
p304
aVI have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.
p305
aVI'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.
p306
aVAnd this is what it is.
p307
aVI say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,
p308
aVwhich basically means mice that live about three years on average.
p309
aVWe do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.
p310
aVAnd then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,
p311
aVand with those therapies, we get them to live,
p312
aVon average, to their fifth birthday.
p313
aVSo, in other words, we add two years \u2014
p314
aVwe treble their remaining lifespan,
p315
aVstarting from the point that we started the therapies.
p316
aa(lp317
VThe question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame
p318
aVuntil we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?
p319
aVWhich we can now, as I've explained,
p320
aVequivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.
p321
aVSecondly, what does it mean for the public's perception
p322
aVof how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,
p323
aVstarting from the time we get the mice?
p324
aVAnd thirdly, the question is, what will it do
p325
aVto actually how much people want it?
p326
aVAnd it seems to me that the first question
p327
aVis entirely a biology question,
p328
aVand it's extremely hard to answer.
p329
aVOne has to be very speculative,
p330
aVand many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,
p331
aVthat we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.
p332
aa(lp333
VI say that's nonsense.
p334
aVI say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.
p335
aVWe need to give our best guess as to the time frame,
p336
aVin order to give people a sense of proportion
p337
aVso that they can assess their priorities.
p338
aVSo, I say that we have a 50/50 chance
p339
aVof reaching this RHR milestone,
p340
aVrobust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point
p341
aVthat we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.
p342
aV15 years from the robust mouse.
p343
aVThe public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.
p344
aVThe public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.
p345
aVSo they'll probably think it's five years away.
p346
aVThey'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.
p347
aVAnd finally, of course, I think it's fair to say
p348
aVthat a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now
p349
aVis the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.
p350
aVThat will be history at this point,
p351
aVbecause it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,
p352
aVsince it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.
p353
aVSo we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,
p354
aVand of course that has enormous implications.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice,
p357
aVI'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.
p358
aVI'm going to use this word "damage"
p359
aVto denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism
p360
aVand that eventually cause pathology.
p361
aVBecause the critical thing about this
p362
aVis that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,
p363
aVthe damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.
p364
aVBut it is not part of metabolism itself.
p365
aVAnd this turns out to be useful.
p366
aVBecause we can re-draw our original diagram this way.
p367
aVWe can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics
p368
aVis that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate
p369
aVat which metabolism lays down this damage.
p370
aVAnd I'm going to explain exactly what damage is
p371
aVin concrete biological terms in a moment.
p372
aVAnd geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time
p373
aVby stopping the damage converting into pathology.
p374
aVAnd the reason it's a losing battle
p375
aVis because the damage is continuing to accumulate.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.
p378
aVWe can call it the "engineering approach,"
p379
aVand I claim that the engineering approach is within range.
p380
aVThe engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.
p381
aVIt does not intervene in this process or this one.
p382
aVAnd that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle,
p383
aVand it's something that we are within range of being able to do,
p384
aVbecause it doesn't involve improving on evolution.
p385
aVThe engineering approach simply says,
p386
aV"Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage \u2014
p387
aVnot necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,
p388
aVso that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold
p389
aVthat must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."
p390
aVWe know that this threshold exists,
p391
aVbecause we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age,
p392
aVeven though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.
p393
aa(lp394
VWhy do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.
p395
aVThe point about this slide is actually the bottom.
p396
aVIf we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,
p397
aVwe will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism
p398
aVis important for aging in one way or another.
p399
aVThis list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.
p400
aVThe list on the right is also incomplete.
p401
aVIt's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,
p402
aVand it's just an incomplete list.
p403
aVBut I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete \u2014
p404
aVthis is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,
p405
aVside effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,
p406
aVor that might cause pathology.
p407
aVAnd there are only seven of them.
p408
aVThey're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.
p409
aVCell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.
p410
aa(lp411
VFirst of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.
p412
aVOf course one can make a biological argument.
p413
aVOne can say, "OK, what are we made of?"
p414
aVWe're made of cells and stuff between cells.
p415
aVWhat can damage accumulate in?
p416
aVThe answer is: long-lived molecules,
p417
aVbecause if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed \u2014
p418
aVlike by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis \u2014 then the damage is gone, too.
p419
aVIt's got to be long-lived molecules.
p420
aVSo, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago
p421
aVand that is pretty good news, because it means that,
p422
aVyou know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years,
p423
aVso the fact that we haven't extended this list
p424
aVis a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.
p425
aVHowever, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,
p426
aVin mice, in principle \u2014 and what I mean by in principle is,
p427
aVwe probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.
p428
aVSome of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.
p429
aa(lp430
VI haven't got time to go through them at all, but
p431
aVmy conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,
p432
aVthen we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,
p433
aVbut we do need to get serious about it.
p434
aVWe do need to really start trying.
p435
aVSo of course, there are some biologists in the audience,
p436
aVand I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.
p437
aVYou may have been dissatisfied with this talk,
p438
aVbut fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.
p439
aVI've published a great deal on this;
p440
aVI cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,
p441
aVand there's quite a lot of detail there.
p442
aVThe detail is what makes me confident
p443
aVof my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.
p444
aVSo if you think that I'm wrong,
p445
aVyou'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.
p446
aa(lp447
VAnd of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people
p448
aVwho call themselves gerontologists because,
p449
aVas with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,
p450
aVyou know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant
p451
aVand not really to take it seriously.
p452
aVSo, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,
p453
aVin order to understand whether this is true.
p454
aa(lp455
VAnd we'll just end with a few things.
p456
aVOne thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session
p457
aVwho said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,
p458
aVand everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."
p459
aVAnd you know what happened.
p460
aVSo, you know, this does happen.
p461
aVWe have various strategies \u2014 there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize,
p462
aVwhich is basically an incentive to innovate,
p463
aVand to do what you think is going to work,
p464
aVand you get money for it if you win.
p465
aVThere's a proposal to actually put together an institute.
p466
aVThis is what's going to take a bit of money.
p467
aVBut, I mean, look \u2014 how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?
p468
aVNot very long. OK.
p469
aV(Laughter)
p470
aVIt's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech,
p471
aVbut it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.
p472
aVAnd I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.
p473
aVThank you.
p474
aV(Applause)
p475
aa(lp476
VChris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions
p477
aVbut I thought I would give people the chance.
p478
aVAudience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it,
p479
aVwhy is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?
p480
aV(Laughter)
p481
aa(lp482
VAG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.
p483
aV(Laughter)
p484
aV(Applause)
p485
aa(lp486
VAudience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems
p487
aVto fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.
p488
aVHowever, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die,
p489
aVso when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.
p490
aVSo, why does \u2014 evolution has \u2014 seems to have selected against immortality,
p491
aVwhen it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?
p492
aa(lp493
VAG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question
p494
aVthat I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.
p495
aVI'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question,
p496
aVwhich I happen to agree with,
p497
aVwhich is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution;
p498
aV[aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.
p499
aVIn other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging;
p500
aVyou need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes
p501
aVin order to age more slowly,
p502
aVand that carries on being true the longer you push it out.
p503
aVSo, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter,
p504
aVdoesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals,
p505
aVliving a long time or by procreation,
p506
aVthere's a certain amount of modulation of that,
p507
aVwhich is why different species have different lifespans,
p508
aVbut that's why there are no immortal species.
p509
aa(lp510
VCA: The genes don't care but we do?
p511
aa(lp512
VAG: That's right.
p513
aa(lp514
VAudience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years,
p515
aVthe average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.
p516
aVIf I project that, that would make me think
p517
aVthat I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.
p518
aVThat means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?
p519
aa(lp520
VAG: If you lose a bit of weight.
p521
aV(Laughter)
p522
aVYour numbers are a bit out.
p523
aVThe standard numbers are that lifespans
p524
aVhave been growing at between one and two years per decade.
p525
aVSo, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.
p526
aVBut I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.
p527
aa(lp528
VAudience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults
p529
aVare actually in the human embryo,
p530
aVand that the brain cells last 80 years or so.
p531
aVIf that is indeed true,
p532
aVbiologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?
p533
aVIf there are cells in my body that live all 80 years,
p534
aVas opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?
p535
aa(lp536
VAG: There are technical implications certainly.
p537
aVBasically what we need to do is replace cells
p538
aVin those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate,
p539
aVespecially neurons, but we don't want to replace them
p540
aVany faster than that \u2014 or not much faster anyway,
p541
aVbecause replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.
p542
aVWhat I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on
p543
aVwas a little bit of an oversimplification.
p544
aVThere are species that have no aging \u2014 Hydra for example \u2014
p545
aVbut they do it by not having a nervous system \u2014
p546
aVand not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function
p547
aVon very long-lived cells.

He argues instead that aging is a disease -- one that can be cured if it&#39;s approached as &quot;an engineering problem.&quot;  His plan calls for <strong>identifying all the components that cause human tissue to age, and designing remedies for each</strong> of them &mdash; forestalling disease and eventually pushing back death. He calls the approach <a href=\\"http://www.sens.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS)</a>.</p><p> With his astonishingly long beard, wiry frame and penchant for bold and cutting proclamations, <strong>de Grey is a magnet for controversy</strong>. A computer scientist, self-taught biogerontologist and researcher, he has co-authored journal articles with some of the most respected scientists in the field.</p><p>But <strong>the scientific community doesn&#39;t know what to make of him</strong>. In July 2005, the <em>MIT Technology Review</em> challenged scientists to disprove de Grey&#39;s claims, offering a $20,000 prize (half the prize money was put up by de Grey&#39;s <a href=\\"http://www.methuselahfoundation.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Methuselah Foundation</a>) to any molecular biologist who could demonstrate that &quot;SENS is so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate.&quot; <a href=\\"http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/index.aspx\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The challenge remains open</a>; the judging panel includes TEDsters Craig Venter and Nathan Myhrvold. It seems that &quot;SENS exists in a middle ground of yet-to-be-tested ideas that some people may find intriguing but which others are free to doubt,&quot; MIT&#39;s judges wrote.

de Grey challenges the most basic assumption underlying the human condition -- that aging is inevitable. He argues instead that aging is a disease -- one that can be cured if it&#39;s approached as &quot;an engineering problem.&quot;  His plan calls for <strong>identifying all the components that cause human tissue to age, and designing remedies for each</strong> of them &mdash; forestalling disease and eventually pushing back death. He calls the approach <a href=\\"http://www.sens.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS)</a>.</p><p> With his astonishingly long beard, wiry frame and penchant for bold and cutting proclamations, <strong>de Grey is a magnet for controversy</strong>. A computer scientist, self-taught biogerontologist and researcher, he has co-authored journal articles with some of the most respected scientists in the field.</p><p>But <strong>the scientific community doesn&#39;t know what to make of him</strong>. In July 2005, the <em>MIT Technology Review</em> challenged scientists to disprove de Grey&#39;s claims, offering a $20,000 prize (half the prize money was put up by de Grey&#39;s <a href=\\"http://www.methuselahfoundation.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Methuselah Foundation</a>) to any molecular biologist who could demonstrate that &quot;SENS is so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate.&quot; <a href=\\"http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/index.aspx\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The challenge remains open</a>; the judging panel includes TEDsters Craig Venter and Nathan Myhrvold. It seems that &quot;SENS exists in a middle ground of yet-to-be-tested ideas that some people may find intriguing but which others are free to doubt,&quot; MIT&#39;s judges wrote. And while they &quot;don&#39;t compel the assent of many knowledgeable scientists,&quot; they&#39;re also &quot;not demonstrably wrong.&quot;</p>", "slug": "aubrey_de_grey", "whotheyare": "Aubrey de Grey, British researcher on aging, claims he has drawn a roadmap to defeat biological aging.

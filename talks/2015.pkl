VLet me tell you a story.
p5
aVIt goes back 200 million years.
p6
aVIt's a story of the neocortex,
p7
aVwhich means "new rind."
p8
aVSo in these early mammals,
p9
aVbecause only mammals have a neocortex,
p10
aVrodent-like creatures.
p11
aVIt was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin,
p12
aVand was a thin covering around
p13
aVtheir walnut-sized brain,
p14
aVbut it was capable of a new type of thinking.
p15
aVRather than the fixed behaviors
p16
aVthat non-mammalian animals have,
p17
aVit could invent new behaviors.
p18
aVSo a mouse is escaping a predator,
p19
aVits path is blocked,
p20
aVit'll try to invent a new solution.
p21
aVThat may work, it may not,
p22
aVbut if it does, it will remember that
p23
aVand have a new behavior,
p24
aVand that can actually spread virally
p25
aVthrough the rest of the community.
p26
aVAnother mouse watching this could say,
p27
aV"Hey, that was pretty clever, going around that rock,"
p28
aVand it could adopt a new behavior as well.
p29
aa(lp30
VNon-mammalian animals
p31
aVcouldn't do any of those things.
p32
aVThey had fixed behaviors.
p33
aVNow they could learn a new behavior
p34
aVbut not in the course of one lifetime.
p35
aVIn the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes,
p36
aVit could evolve a new fixed behavior.
p37
aVThat was perfectly okay 200 million years ago.
p38
aVThe environment changed very slowly.
p39
aVIt could take 10,000 years for there to be
p40
aVa significant environmental change,
p41
aVand during that period of time
p42
aVit would evolve a new behavior.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow that went along fine,
p45
aVbut then something happened.
p46
aVSixty-five million years ago,
p47
aVthere was a sudden, violent change to the environment.
p48
aVWe call it the Cretaceous extinction event.
p49
aVThat's when the dinosaurs went extinct,
p50
aVthat's when 75 percent of the
p51
aVanimal and plant species went extinct,
p52
aVand that's when mammals
p53
aVovertook their ecological niche,
p54
aVand to anthropomorphize, biological evolution said,
p55
aV"Hmm, this neocortex is pretty good stuff,"
p56
aVand it began to grow it.
p57
aVAnd mammals got bigger,
p58
aVtheir brains got bigger at an even faster pace,
p59
aVand the neocortex got bigger even faster than that
p60
aVand developed these distinctive ridges and folds
p61
aVbasically to increase its surface area.
p62
aVIf you took the human neocortex
p63
aVand stretched it out,
p64
aVit's about the size of a table napkin,
p65
aVand it's still a thin structure.
p66
aVIt's about the thickness of a table napkin.
p67
aVBut it has so many convolutions and ridges
p68
aVit's now 80 percent of our brain,
p69
aVand that's where we do our thinking,
p70
aVand it's the great sublimator.
p71
aVWe still have that old brain
p72
aVthat provides our basic drives and motivations,
p73
aVbut I may have a drive for conquest,
p74
aVand that'll be sublimated by the neocortex
p75
aVinto writing a poem or inventing an app
p76
aVor giving a TED Talk,
p77
aVand it's really the neocortex that's where
p78
aVthe action is.
p79
aa(lp80
VFifty years ago, I wrote a paper
p81
aVdescribing how I thought the brain worked,
p82
aVand I described it as a series of modules.
p83
aVEach module could do things with a pattern.
p84
aVIt could learn a pattern. It could remember a pattern.
p85
aVIt could implement a pattern.
p86
aVAnd these modules were organized in hierarchies,
p87
aVand we created that hierarchy with our own thinking.
p88
aVAnd there was actually very little to go on
p89
aV50 years ago.
p90
aVIt led me to meet President Johnson.
p91
aVI've been thinking about this for 50 years,
p92
aVand a year and a half ago I came out with the book
p93
aV"How To Create A Mind,"
p94
aVwhich has the same thesis,
p95
aVbut now there's a plethora of evidence.
p96
aVThe amount of data we're getting about the brain
p97
aVfrom neuroscience is doubling every year.
p98
aVSpatial resolution of brainscanning of all types
p99
aVis doubling every year.
p100
aVWe can now see inside a living brain
p101
aVand see individual interneural connections
p102
aVconnecting in real time, firing in real time.
p103
aVWe can see your brain create your thoughts.
p104
aVWe can see your thoughts create your brain,
p105
aVwhich is really key to how it works.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo let me describe briefly how it works.
p108
aVI've actually counted these modules.
p109
aVWe have about 300 million of them,
p110
aVand we create them in these hierarchies.
p111
aVI'll give you a simple example.
p112
aVI've got a bunch of modules
p113
aVthat can recognize the crossbar to a capital A,
p114
aVand that's all they care about.
p115
aVA beautiful song can play,
p116
aVa pretty girl could walk by,
p117
aVthey don't care, but they see a crossbar to a capital A,
p118
aVthey get very excited and they say "crossbar,"
p119
aVand they put out a high probability
p120
aVon their output axon.
p121
aVThat goes to the next level,
p122
aVand these layers are organized in conceptual levels.
p123
aVEach is more abstract than the next one,
p124
aVso the next one might say "capital A."
p125
aVThat goes up to a higher level that might say "Apple."
p126
aVInformation flows down also.
p127
aVIf the apple recognizer has seen A-P-P-L,
p128
aVit'll think to itself, "Hmm, I think an E is probably likely,"
p129
aVand it'll send a signal down to all the E recognizers
p130
aVsaying, "Be on the lookout for an E,
p131
aVI think one might be coming."
p132
aVThe E recognizers will lower their threshold
p133
aVand they see some sloppy thing, could be an E.
p134
aVOrdinarily you wouldn't think so,
p135
aVbut we're expecting an E, it's good enough,
p136
aVand yeah, I've seen an E, and then apple says,
p137
aV"Yeah, I've seen an Apple."
p138
aa(lp139
VGo up another five levels,
p140
aVand you're now at a pretty high level
p141
aVof this hierarchy,
p142
aVand stretch down into the different senses,
p143
aVand you may have a module that sees a certain fabric,
p144
aVhears a certain voice quality, smells a certain perfume,
p145
aVand will say, "My wife has entered the room."
p146
aa(lp147
VGo up another 10 levels, and now you're at
p148
aVa very high level.
p149
aVYou're probably in the frontal cortex,
p150
aVand you'll have modules that say, "That was ironic.
p151
aVThat's funny. She's pretty."
p152
aa(lp153
VYou might think that those are more sophisticated,
p154
aVbut actually what's more complicated
p155
aVis the hierarchy beneath them.
p156
aVThere was a 16-year-old girl, she had brain surgery,
p157
aVand she was conscious because the surgeons
p158
aVwanted to talk to her.
p159
aVYou can do that because there's no pain receptors
p160
aVin the brain.
p161
aVAnd whenever they stimulated particular,
p162
aVvery small points on her neocortex,
p163
aVshown here in red, she would laugh.
p164
aVSo at first they thought they were triggering
p165
aVsome kind of laugh reflex,
p166
aVbut no, they quickly realized they had found
p167
aVthe points in her neocortex that detect humor,
p168
aVand she just found everything hilarious
p169
aVwhenever they stimulated these points.
p170
aV"You guys are so funny just standing around,"
p171
aVwas the typical comment,
p172
aVand they weren't funny,
p173
aVnot while doing surgery.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo how are we doing today?
p176
aVWell, computers are actually beginning to master
p177
aVhuman language with techniques
p178
aVthat are similar to the neocortex.
p179
aVI actually described the algorithm,
p180
aVwhich is similar to something called
p181
aVa hierarchical hidden Markov model,
p182
aVsomething I've worked on since the '90s.
p183
aV"Jeopardy" is a very broad natural language game,
p184
aVand Watson got a higher score
p185
aVthan the best two players combined.
p186
aVIt got this query correct:
p187
aV"A long, tiresome speech
p188
aVdelivered by a frothy pie topping,"
p189
aVand it quickly responded, "What is a meringue harangue?"
p190
aVAnd Jennings and the other guy didn't get that.
p191
aVIt's a pretty sophisticated example of
p192
aVcomputers actually understanding human language,
p193
aVand it actually got its knowledge by reading
p194
aVWikipedia and several other encyclopedias.
p195
aa(lp196
VFive to 10 years from now,
p197
aVsearch engines will actually be based on
p198
aVnot just looking for combinations of words and links
p199
aVbut actually understanding,
p200
aVreading for understanding the billions of pages
p201
aVon the web and in books.
p202
aVSo you'll be walking along, and Google will pop up
p203
aVand say, "You know, Mary, you expressed concern
p204
aVto me a month ago that your glutathione supplement
p205
aVwasn't getting past the blood-brain barrier.
p206
aVWell, new research just came out 13 seconds ago
p207
aVthat shows a whole new approach to that
p208
aVand a new way to take glutathione.
p209
aVLet me summarize it for you."
p210
aa(lp211
VTwenty years from now, we'll have nanobots,
p212
aVbecause another exponential trend
p213
aVis the shrinking of technology.
p214
aVThey'll go into our brain
p215
aVthrough the capillaries
p216
aVand basically connect our neocortex
p217
aVto a synthetic neocortex in the cloud
p218
aVproviding an extension of our neocortex.
p219
aVNow today, I mean,
p220
aVyou have a computer in your phone,
p221
aVbut if you need 10,000 computers for a few seconds
p222
aVto do a complex search,
p223
aVyou can access that for a second or two in the cloud.
p224
aVIn the 2030s, if you need some extra neocortex,
p225
aVyou'll be able to connect to that in the cloud
p226
aVdirectly from your brain.
p227
aVSo I'm walking along and I say,
p228
aV"Oh, there's Chris Anderson.
p229
aVHe's coming my way.
p230
aVI'd better think of something clever to say.
p231
aVI've got three seconds.
p232
aVMy 300 million modules in my neocortex
p233
aVisn't going to cut it.
p234
aVI need a billion more."
p235
aVI'll be able to access that in the cloud.
p236
aVAnd our thinking, then, will be a hybrid
p237
aVof biological and non-biological thinking,
p238
aVbut the non-biological portion
p239
aVis subject to my law of accelerating returns.
p240
aVIt will grow exponentially.
p241
aVAnd remember what happens
p242
aVthe last time we expanded our neocortex?
p243
aVThat was two million years ago
p244
aVwhen we became humanoids
p245
aVand developed these large foreheads.
p246
aVOther primates have a slanted brow.
p247
aVThey don't have the frontal cortex.
p248
aVBut the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different.
p249
aVIt's a quantitative expansion of neocortex,
p250
aVbut that additional quantity of thinking
p251
aVwas the enabling factor for us to take
p252
aVa qualitative leap and invent language
p253
aVand art and science and technology
p254
aVand TED conferences.
p255
aVNo other species has done that.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd so, over the next few decades,
p258
aVwe're going to do it again.
p259
aVWe're going to again expand our neocortex,
p260
aVonly this time we won't be limited
p261
aVby a fixed architecture of enclosure.
p262
aVIt'll be expanded without limit.
p263
aVThat additional quantity will again
p264
aVbe the enabling factor for another qualitative leap
p265
aVin culture and technology.
p266
aa(lp267
VThank you very much.

VThis is where I live. I live in Kenya,
p5
aVat the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.
p6
aVThose are my dad's cows at the back,
p7
aVand behind the cows,
p8
aVthat's the Nairobi National Park.
p9
aVNairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,
p10
aVwhich means wild animals like zebras
p11
aVmigrate out of the park freely.
p12
aVSo predators like lions follow them,
p13
aVand this is what they do.
p14
aVThey kill our livestock.
p15
aVThis is one of the cows which was killed at night,
p16
aVand I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,
p17
aVand I felt so bad,
p18
aVbecause it was the only bull we had.
p19
aa(lp20
VMy community, the Maasai, we believe that
p21
aVwe came from heaven with all our animals and all the land
p22
aVfor herding them, and that's why we value them so much.
p23
aVSo I grew up hating lions so much.
p24
aVThe morans are the warriors
p25
aVwho protect our community and the livestock,
p26
aVand they're also upset about this problem.
p27
aVSo they kill the lions.
p28
aVIt's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi.
p29
aVAnd I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community
p32
aVis responsible for his dad's cows,
p33
aVand that's the same thing which happened to me.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo I had to find a way of solving this problem.
p36
aVAnd the first idea I got was to use fire,
p37
aVbecause I thought lions were scared of fire.
p38
aVBut I came to realize that that didn't really help,
p39
aVbecause it was even helping the lions
p40
aVto see through the cowshed.
p41
aVSo I didn't give up. I continued.
p42
aVAnd a second idea I got was
p43
aVto use a scarecrow.
p44
aVI was trying to trick the lions
p45
aV[into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed.
p46
aVBut lions are very clever. (Laughter)
p47
aVThey will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,
p48
aVbut the second day, they'll come and they say,
p49
aVthis thing is not moving here, it's always here. (Laughter)
p50
aVSo he jumps in and kills the animals.
p51
aVSo one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,
p52
aVand that day, the lions didn't come.
p53
aVAnd I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.
p54
aVSo I had an idea.
p55
aVSince I was a small boy,
p56
aVI used to work in my room for the whole day,
p57
aVand I even took apart my mom's new radio,
p58
aVand that day she almost killed me,
p59
aVbut I learned a lot about electronics. (Laughter)
p60
aVSo I got an old car battery,
p61
aVan indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle,
p62
aVand it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks.
p63
aVAnd I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.
p64
aVAnd that's a small torch from a broken flashlight.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I set up everything.
p67
aVAs you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,
p68
aVand the battery supplies the power
p69
aVto the small indicator box. I call it a transformer.
p70
aVAnd the indicator box makes the lights flash.
p71
aVAs you can see, the bulbs face outside,
p72
aVbecause that's where the lions come from.
p73
aVAnd that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.
p74
aVThe lights flash and trick
p75
aVthe lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,
p76
aVbut I was sleeping in my bed.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aV(Applause)
p80
aVThanks.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo I set it up in my home two years ago,
p83
aVand since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions.
p84
aVAnd my neighboring homes heard about this idea.
p85
aVOne of them was this grandmother.
p86
aVShe had a lot of her animals being killed by lions,
p87
aVand she asked me if I could put the lights for her.
p88
aVAnd I said, "Yes."
p89
aVSo I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights.
p90
aVSince now, I've set up seven homes around my community,
p91
aVand they're really working.
p92
aVAnd my idea is also being used now all over Kenya
p93
aVfor scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards,
p94
aVand it's also being used
p95
aVto scare elephants away from people's farms.
p96
aa(lp97
VBecause of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship
p98
aVin one of the best schools in Kenya,
p99
aVBrookhouse International School,
p100
aVand I'm really excited about this.
p101
aVMy new school now is coming in and helping
p102
aVby fundraising and creating an awareness.
p103
aVI even took my friends back to my community,
p104
aVand we're installing the lights to the homes
p105
aVwhich don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland
p108
aVherding my father's cows,
p109
aVand I used to see planes flying over,
p110
aVand I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside.
p111
aVAnd here I am today.
p112
aVI got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED.
p113
aVSo my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.
p114
aa(lp115
VI used to hate lions, but now because my invention
p116
aVis saving my father's cows and the lions,
p117
aVwe are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.
p118
aVAshê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Applause)
p121
aa(lp122
VChris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is
p123
aVto hear a story like yours.
p124
aVSo you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep.
p125
aa(lp126
VCA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
p127
aVWhat's the next one on your list?
p128
aa(lp129
VRT: My next invention is,
p130
aVI want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence?
p131
aVRT: But I know electric fences are already invented,
p132
aVbut I want to make mine.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VCA: You already tried it once, right, and you \u2014RT: I tried it before,
p136
aVbut I stopped because it gave me a shock. (Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VCA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else.
p139
aVWe're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend.
p140
aVThank you so much.RT: Thank you. (Applause)

After dismantling the few household appliances, Richard taught himself how to fix them, and then he started inventing. He fit his parents&#39; home with fans made from car parts and other junkyard components harvested from junkyards, then built other inventions for his neighbors. </p><p>Now 13, he is renowned for inventing &quot;lion lights,&quot; a fence made of basic pieces (solar charging cells, flashlight parts), which quickly and effectively scares lions away from his father&#39;s cattle.

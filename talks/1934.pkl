VI work with children with autism.
p5
aVSpecifically, I make technologies
p6
aVto help them communicate.
p7
aa(lp8
VNow, many of the problems that children
p9
aVwith autism face, they have a common source,
p10
aVand that source is that they find it difficult
p11
aVto understand abstraction, symbolism.
p12
aVAnd because of this, they have  a lot of difficulty with language.
p13
aa(lp14
VLet me tell you a little bit about why this is.
p15
aVYou see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup.
p16
aVAll of us can see it. All of us understand this.
p17
aVThese are two other pictures of soup,
p18
aVbut you can see that these are more abstract
p19
aVThese are not quite as concrete.
p20
aVAnd when you get to language,
p21
aVyou see that it becomes a word
p22
aVwhose look, the way it looks and the way it sounds,
p23
aVhas absolutely nothing to do  with what it started with,
p24
aVor what it represents, which is the bowl of soup.
p25
aVSo it's essentially a completely abstract,
p26
aVa completely arbitrary representation of something
p27
aVwhich is in the real world,
p28
aVand this is something that children with autism
p29
aVhave an incredible amount of difficulty with.
p30
aVNow that's why most of the people  that work with children with autism \u2014
p31
aVspeech therapists, educators \u2014
p32
aVwhat they do is, they try to help children with autism
p33
aVcommunicate not with words, but with pictures.
p34
aVSo if a child with autism wanted to say,
p35
aV"I want soup," that child would pick
p36
aVthree different pictures, "I," "want," and "soup,"
p37
aVand they would put these together,
p38
aVand then the therapist or the parent would
p39
aVunderstand that this is what the kid wants to say.
p40
aVAnd this has been incredibly effective;
p41
aVfor the last 30, 40 years
p42
aVpeople have been doing this.
p43
aVIn fact, a few years back,
p44
aVI developed an app for the iPad
p45
aVwhich does exactly this. It's called Avaz,
p46
aVand the way it works is that kids select
p47
aVdifferent pictures.
p48
aVThese pictures are sequenced together to form sentences,
p49
aVand these sentences are spoken out.
p50
aVSo Avaz is essentially converting pictures,
p51
aVit's a translator, it converts pictures into speech.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, this was very effective.
p54
aVThere are thousands of children using this,
p55
aVyou know, all over the world,
p56
aVand I started thinking about
p57
aVwhat it does and what it doesn't do.
p58
aVAnd I realized something interesting:
p59
aVAvaz helps children with autism learn words.
p60
aVWhat it doesn't help them do is to learn
p61
aVword patterns.
p62
aVLet me explain this in a little more detail.
p63
aVTake this sentence: "I want soup tonight."
p64
aVNow it's not just the words here that convey the meaning.
p65
aVIt's also the way in which these words are arranged,
p66
aVthe way these words are modified and arranged.
p67
aVAnd that's why a sentence like "I want soup tonight"
p68
aVis different from a sentence like
p69
aV"Soup want I tonight," which  is completely meaningless.
p70
aVSo there is another hidden abstraction here
p71
aVwhich children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with,
p72
aVand that's the fact that you can modify words
p73
aVand you can arrange them to have
p74
aVdifferent meanings, to convey different ideas.
p75
aVNow, this is what we call grammar.
p76
aVAnd grammar is incredibly powerful,
p77
aVbecause grammar is this one component of language
p78
aVwhich takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have
p79
aVand allows us to convey an infinite amount of information,
p80
aVan infinite amount of ideas.
p81
aVIt's the way in which you can put things together
p82
aVin order to convey anything you want to.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd so after I developed Avaz,
p85
aVI worried for a very long time
p86
aVabout how I could give grammar  to children with autism.
p87
aVThe solution came to me from a very interesting perspective.
p88
aVI happened to chance upon a child with autism
p89
aVconversing with her mom,
p90
aVand this is what happened.
p91
aVCompletely out of the blue, very spontaneously,
p92
aVthe child got up and said, "Eat."
p93
aVNow what was interesting was
p94
aVthe way in which the mom was trying to tease out
p95
aVthe meaning of what the child wanted to say
p96
aVby talking to her in questions.
p97
aVSo she asked, "Eat what? Do  you want to eat ice cream?
p98
aVYou want to eat? Somebody else wants to eat?
p99
aVYou want to eat cream now? You want to eat ice cream in the evening?"
p100
aVAnd then it struck me that
p101
aVwhat the mother had done was something incredible.
p102
aVShe had been able to get that child to communicate
p103
aVan idea to her without grammar.
p104
aVAnd it struck me that maybe this is what
p105
aVI was looking for.
p106
aVInstead of arranging words in an order, in sequence,
p107
aVas a sentence, you arrange them
p108
aVin this map, where they're all linked together
p109
aVnot by placing them one after the other
p110
aVbut in questions, in question-answer pairs.
p111
aVAnd so if you do this, then what you're conveying
p112
aVis not a sentence in English,
p113
aVbut what you're conveying is really a meaning,
p114
aVthe meaning of a sentence in English.
p115
aVNow, meaning is really the underbelly, in some sense, of language.
p116
aVIt's what comes after thought but before language.
p117
aVAnd the idea was that this particular representation
p118
aVmight convey meaning in its raw form.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo I was very excited by this, you know,
p121
aVhopping around all over the place,
p122
aVtrying to figure out if I can convert
p123
aVall possible sentences that I hear into this.
p124
aVAnd I found that this is not enough.
p125
aVWhy is this not enough?
p126
aVThis is not enough because if you wanted to convey
p127
aVsomething like negation,
p128
aVyou want to say, "I don't want soup,"
p129
aVthen you can't do that by asking a question.
p130
aVYou do that by changing the word "want."
p131
aVAgain, if you wanted to say,
p132
aV"I wanted soup yesterday,"
p133
aVyou do that by converting the word "want" into "wanted."
p134
aVIt's a past tense.
p135
aVSo this is a flourish which I added
p136
aVto make the system complete.
p137
aVThis is a map of words joined together
p138
aVas questions and answers,
p139
aVand with these filters applied on top of them
p140
aVin order to modify them to represent
p141
aVcertain nuances.
p142
aVLet me show you this with a different example.
p143
aa(lp144
VLet's take this sentence:
p145
aV"I told the carpenter I could not pay him."
p146
aVIt's a fairly complicated sentence.
p147
aVThe way that this particular system works,
p148
aVyou can start with any part of this sentence.
p149
aVI'm going to start with the word "tell."
p150
aVSo this is the word "tell."
p151
aVNow this happened in the past,
p152
aVso I'm going to make that "told."
p153
aVNow, what I'm going to do is,
p154
aVI'm going to ask questions.
p155
aVSo, who told? I told.
p156
aVI told whom? I told the carpenter.
p157
aVNow we start with a different part of the sentence.
p158
aVWe start with the word "pay,"
p159
aVand we add the ability filter to it to make it "can pay."
p160
aVThen we make it "can't pay,"
p161
aVand we can make it "couldn't pay"
p162
aVby making it the past tense.
p163
aVSo who couldn't pay? I couldn't pay.
p164
aVCouldn't pay whom? I couldn't pay the carpenter.
p165
aVAnd then you join these two together
p166
aVby asking this question:
p167
aVWhat did I tell the carpenter?
p168
aVI told the carpenter I could not pay him.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow think about this. This is
p171
aV\u2014(Applause)\u2014
p172
aVthis is a representation of this sentence
p173
aVwithout language.
p174
aVAnd there are two or three interesting things about this.
p175
aVFirst of all, I could have started anywhere.
p176
aVI didn't have to start with the word "tell."
p177
aVI could have started anywhere in the sentence,
p178
aVand I could have made this entire thing.
p179
aVThe second thing is, if I wasn't an English speaker,
p180
aVif I was speaking in some other language,
p181
aVthis map would actually hold true in any language.
p182
aVSo long as the questions are standardized,
p183
aVthe map is actually independent of language.
p184
aVSo I call this FreeSpeech,
p185
aVand I was playing with this for many, many months.
p186
aVI was trying out so many different combinations of this.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech.
p189
aVI was trying to convert language,
p190
aVconvert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech,
p191
aVand vice versa, and back and forth.
p192
aVAnd I realized that this particular configuration,
p193
aVthis particular way of representing language,
p194
aVit allowed me to actually create very concise rules
p195
aVthat go between FreeSpeech on one side
p196
aVand English on the other.
p197
aVSo I could actually write this set of rules
p198
aVthat translates from this particular representation into English.
p199
aVAnd so I developed this thing.
p200
aVI developed this thing called  the FreeSpeech Engine
p201
aVwhich takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input
p202
aVand gives out perfectly grammatical English text.
p203
aVAnd by putting these two pieces together,
p204
aVthe representation and the engine,
p205
aVI was able to create an app, a technology for children with autism,
p206
aVthat not only gives them words
p207
aVbut also gives them grammar.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo I tried this out with kids with autism,
p210
aVand I found that there was an  incredible amount of identification.
p211
aVThey were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech
p212
aVwhich were much more complicated but much more effective
p213
aVthan equivalent sentences in English,
p214
aVand I started thinking about
p215
aVwhy that might be the case.
p216
aVAnd I had an idea, and I want to  talk to you about this idea next.
p217
aVIn about 1997, about 15 years back,
p218
aVthere were a group of scientists that were trying
p219
aVto understand how the brain processes language,
p220
aVand they found something very interesting.
p221
aVThey found that when you learn a language
p222
aVas a child, as a two-year-old,
p223
aVyou learn it with a certain part of your brain,
p224
aVand when you learn a language as an adult \u2014
p225
aVfor example, if I wanted to learn Japanese right now \u2014
p226
aVa completely different part of my brain is used.
p227
aVNow I don't know why that's the case,
p228
aVbut my guess is that that's because
p229
aVwhen you learn a language as an adult,
p230
aVyou almost invariably learn it
p231
aVthrough your native language, or through your first language.
p232
aVSo what's interesting about FreeSpeech
p233
aVis that when you create a sentence
p234
aVor when you create language,
p235
aVa child with autism creates language with FreeSpeech,
p236
aVthey're not using this support language,
p237
aVthey're not using this bridge language.
p238
aVThey're directly constructing the sentence.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd so this gave me this idea.
p241
aVIs it possible to use FreeSpeech
p242
aVnot for children with autism
p243
aVbut to teach language to people without disabilities?
p244
aVAnd so I tried a number of experiments.
p245
aVThe first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle
p246
aVin which these questions and answers
p247
aVare coded in the form of shapes,
p248
aVin the form of colors,
p249
aVand you have people putting these together
p250
aVand trying to understand how this works.
p251
aVAnd I built an app out of it, a game out of it,
p252
aVin which children can play with words
p253
aVand with a reinforcement,
p254
aVa sound reinforcement of visual structures,
p255
aVthey're able to learn language.
p256
aVAnd this, this has a lot of potential, a lot of promise,
p257
aVand the government of India recently
p258
aVlicensed this technology from us,
p259
aVand they're going to try it out with millions of different children
p260
aVtrying to teach them English.
p261
aVAnd the dream, the hope, the vision, really,
p262
aVis that when they learn English this way,
p263
aVthey learn it with the same proficiency
p264
aVas their mother tongue.
p265
aa(lp266
VAll right, let's talk about something else.
p267
aVLet's talk about speech.
p268
aVThis is speech.
p269
aVSo speech is the primary mode of communication
p270
aVdelivered between all of us.
p271
aVNow what's interesting about speech is that
p272
aVspeech is one-dimensional.
p273
aVWhy is it one-dimensional?
p274
aVIt's one-dimensional because it's sound.
p275
aVIt's also one-dimensional because
p276
aVour mouths are built that way.
p277
aVOur mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound.
p278
aVBut if you think about the brain,
p279
aVthe thoughts that we have in our heads
p280
aVare not one-dimensional.
p281
aVI mean, we have these rich,
p282
aVcomplicated, multi-dimensional ideas.
p283
aVNow, it seems to me that language
p284
aVis really the brain's invention
p285
aVto convert this rich, multi-dimensional thought
p286
aVon one hand
p287
aVinto speech on the other hand.
p288
aVNow what's interesting is that
p289
aVwe do a lot of work in information nowadays,
p290
aVand almost all of that is done in the language domain.
p291
aVTake Google, for example.
p292
aVGoogle trawls all these countless billions of websites,
p293
aVall of which are in English, and when you want to use Google,
p294
aVyou go into Google search, and you type in English,
p295
aVand it matches the English with the English.
p296
aVWhat if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead?
p297
aVI have a suspicion that if we did this,
p298
aVwe'd find that algorithms like searching,
p299
aVlike retrieval, all of these things,
p300
aVare much simpler and also more effective,
p301
aVbecause they don't process the data structure of speech.
p302
aVInstead they're processing the data structure of thought.
p303
aVThe data structure of thought.
p304
aVThat's a provocative idea.
p305
aa(lp306
VBut let's look at this in a little more detail.
p307
aVSo this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem.
p308
aVWe have the Free Speech representation on one side,
p309
aVand we have the FreeSpeech  Engine, which generates English.
p310
aVNow if you think about it,
p311
aVFreeSpeech, I told you, is completely  language-independent.
p312
aVIt doesn't have any specific information in it
p313
aVwhich is about English.
p314
aVSo everything that this system knows about English
p315
aVis actually encoded into the engine.
p316
aVThat's a pretty interesting concept in itself.
p317
aVYou've encoded an entire human language
p318
aVinto a software program.
p319
aVBut if you look at what's inside the engine,
p320
aVit's actually not very complicated.
p321
aVIt's not very complicated code.
p322
aVAnd what's more interesting is the fact that
p323
aVthe vast majority of the code in that engine
p324
aVis not really English-specific.
p325
aVAnd that gives this interesting idea.
p326
aVIt might be very easy for us to actually
p327
aVcreate these engines in many, many different languages,
p328
aVin Hindi, in French, in German, in Swahili.
p329
aVAnd that gives another interesting idea.
p330
aVFor example, supposing I was a writer,
p331
aVsay, for a newspaper or for a magazine.
p332
aVI could create content in one language, FreeSpeech,
p333
aVand the person who's consuming that content,
p334
aVthe person who's reading that particular information
p335
aVcould choose any engine,
p336
aVand they could read it in their own mother tongue,
p337
aVin their native language.
p338
aVI mean, this is an incredibly attractive idea,
p339
aVespecially for India.
p340
aVWe have so many different languages.
p341
aVThere's a song about India, and there's a description
p342
aVof the country as, it says,
p343
aV(in Sanskrit).
p344
aVThat means "ever-smiling speaker
p345
aVof beautiful languages."
p346
aa(lp347
VLanguage is beautiful.
p348
aVI think it's the most beautiful of human creations.
p349
aVI think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented.
p350
aVIt entertains, it educates, it enlightens,
p351
aVbut what I like the most about language
p352
aVis that it empowers.
p353
aa(lp354
VI want to leave you with this.
p355
aVThis is a photograph of my collaborators,
p356
aVmy earliest collaborators
p357
aVwhen I started working on language
p358
aVand autism and various other things.
p359
aVThe girl's name is Pavna,
p360
aVand that's her mother, Kalpana.
p361
aVAnd Pavna's an entrepreneur,
p362
aVbut her story is much more remarkable than mine,
p363
aVbecause Pavna is about 23.
p364
aVShe has quadriplegic cerebral palsy,
p365
aVso ever since she was born,
p366
aVshe could neither move nor talk.
p367
aVAnd everything that she's accomplished so far,
p368
aVfinishing school, going to college,
p369
aVstarting a company,
p370
aVcollaborating with me to develop Avaz,
p371
aVall of these things she's done
p372
aVwith nothing more than moving her eyes.
p373
aa(lp374
VDaniel Webster said this:
p375
aVHe said, "If all of my possessions were taken
p376
aVfrom me with one exception,
p377
aVI would choose to keep the power of communication,
p378
aVfor with it, I would regain all the rest."
p379
aVAnd that's why, of all of these incredible  applications of FreeSpeech,
p380
aVthe one that's closest to my heart
p381
aVstill remains the ability for this
p382
aVto empower children with disabilities
p383
aVto be able to communicate,
p384
aVthe power of communication,
p385
aVto get back all the rest.
p386
aa(lp387
VThank you.
p388
aV(Applause)
p389
aVThank you. (Applause)
p390
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

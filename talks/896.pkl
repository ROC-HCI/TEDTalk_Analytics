VThe story starts in Kenya
p5
aVin December of 2007,
p6
aVwhen there was a disputed presidential election,
p7
aVand in the immediate aftermath of that election,
p8
aVthere was an outbreak of ethnic violence.
p9
aVAnd there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh \u2014
p10
aVwho some of you may know from her TEDTalk \u2014
p11
aVwho began blogging about it on her site,
p12
aVKenyan Pundit.
p13
aVAnd shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence,
p14
aVthe government suddenly imposed
p15
aVa significant media blackout.
p16
aVAnd so weblogs went from being
p17
aVcommentary as part of the media landscape
p18
aVto being a critical part of the media landscape
p19
aVin trying to understand where the violence was.
p20
aVAnd Okolloh solicited
p21
aVfrom her commenters
p22
aVmore information about what was going on.
p23
aVThe comments began pouring in,
p24
aVand Okolloh would collate them. She would post them.
p25
aVAnd she quickly said, "It's too much.
p26
aVI could do this all day every day
p27
aVand I can't keep up.
p28
aVThere is more information
p29
aVabout what's going on in Kenya right now
p30
aVthan any one person can manage.
p31
aVIf only there was a way to automate this."
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd two programmers who read her blog
p34
aVheld their hands up and said, "We could do that,"
p35
aVand in 72 hours, they launched Ushahidi.
p36
aVUshahidi \u2014 the name means "witness"
p37
aVor "testimony" in Swahili \u2014
p38
aVis a very simple way of taking reports from the field,
p39
aVwhether it's from the web or, critically,
p40
aVvia mobile phones and SMS,
p41
aVaggregating it and putting it on a map.
p42
aVThat's all it is, but that's all that's needed
p43
aVbecause what it does is it takes the tacit information
p44
aVavailable to the whole population \u2014
p45
aVeverybody knows where the violence is,
p46
aVbut no one person knows what everyone knows \u2014
p47
aVand it takes that tacit information
p48
aVand it aggregates it,
p49
aVand it maps it and it makes it public.
p50
aVAnd that, that maneuver
p51
aVcalled "crisis mapping,"
p52
aVwas kicked off in Kenya
p53
aVin January of 2008.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough
p56
aVthat the programmers who created Ushahidi
p57
aVdecided they were going to make it open source
p58
aVand turn it into a platform.
p59
aVIt's since been deployed in Mexico
p60
aVto track electoral fraud.
p61
aVIt's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup.
p62
aVAnd it's been used most famously in Haiti
p63
aVin the aftermath of the earthquake.
p64
aVAnd when you look at the map
p65
aVnow posted on the Ushahidi front page,
p66
aVyou can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi
p67
aVhas gone worldwide, all right?
p68
aVThis went from a single idea
p69
aVand a single implementation
p70
aVin East Africa in the beginning of 2008
p71
aVto a global deployment
p72
aVin less than three years.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow what Okolloh did
p75
aVwould not have been possible
p76
aVwithout digital technology.
p77
aVWhat Okolloh did would not have been possible
p78
aVwithout human generosity.
p79
aVAnd the interesting moment now,
p80
aVthe number of environments
p81
aVwhere the social design challenge
p82
aVrelies on both of those things being true.
p83
aVThat is the resource that I'm talking about.
p84
aVI call it cognitive surplus.
p85
aVAnd it represents the ability
p86
aVof the world's population
p87
aVto volunteer and to contribute and collaborate
p88
aVon large, sometimes global, projects.
p89
aVCognitive surplus is made up of two things.
p90
aVThe first, obviously, is the world's free time and talents.
p91
aVThe world has over
p92
aVa trillion hours a year
p93
aVof free time
p94
aVto commit to shared projects.
p95
aVNow, that free time existed in the 20th century,
p96
aVbut we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century.
p97
aa(lp98
VThat's the second half of cognitive surplus.
p99
aVThe media landscape in the 20th century
p100
aVwas very good at helping people consume,
p101
aVand we got, as a result,
p102
aVvery good at consuming.
p103
aVBut now that we've been given media tools \u2014
p104
aVthe Internet, mobile phones \u2014 that let us do more than consume,
p105
aVwhat we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes
p106
aVbecause we liked to be.
p107
aVWe were couch potatoes because that was
p108
aVthe only opportunity given to us.
p109
aVWe still like to consume, of course.
p110
aVBut it turns out we also like to create,
p111
aVand we like to share.
p112
aVAnd it's those two things together \u2014
p113
aVancient human motivation
p114
aVand the modern tools to allow that motivation
p115
aVto be joined up in large-scale efforts \u2014
p116
aVthat are the new design resource.
p117
aVAnd using cognitive surplus,
p118
aVwe're starting to see truly incredible experiments
p119
aVin scientific, literary,
p120
aVartistic, political efforts.
p121
aVDesigning.
p122
aa(lp123
VWe're also getting, of course, a lot of LOLcats.
p124
aVLOLcats are cute pictures of cats
p125
aVmade cuter with the addition of cute captions.
p126
aVAnd they are also
p127
aVpart of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.
p128
aVThis is one of the participatory \u2014
p129
aVone of the participatory models
p130
aVwe see coming out of that, along with Ushahidi.
p131
aVNow I want to stipulate, as the lawyers say,
p132
aVthat LOLcats are the stupidest possible
p133
aVcreative act.
p134
aVThere are other candidates of course,
p135
aVbut LOLcats will do as a general case.
p136
aVBut here's the thing:
p137
aVThe stupidest possible creative act
p138
aVis still a creative act.
p139
aVSomeone who has done something like this,
p140
aVhowever mediocre and throwaway,
p141
aVhas tried something, has put something forward in public.
p142
aVAnd once they've done it, they can do it again,
p143
aVand they could work on getting it better.
p144
aa(lp145
VThere is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work,
p146
aVand as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows,
p147
aVit's a spectrum you're constantly
p148
aVstruggling to get on top of.
p149
aVThe gap is between
p150
aVdoing anything and doing nothing.
p151
aVAnd someone who makes a LOLcat
p152
aVhas already crossed over that gap.
p153
aVNow it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis
p154
aVwithout the LOLcats, right,
p155
aVto get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff.
p156
aVBut media abundance never works that way.
p157
aVFreedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything.
p158
aVEven with the sacred printing press,
p159
aVwe got erotic novels 150 years
p160
aVbefore we got scientific journals.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo before I talk about
p163
aVwhat is, I think, the critical difference
p164
aVbetween LOLcats and Ushahidi,
p165
aVI want to talk about
p166
aVtheir shared source.
p167
aVAnd that source is design for generosity.
p168
aVIt is one of the curiosities of our historical era
p169
aVthat even as cognitive surplus
p170
aVis becoming a resource we can design around,
p171
aVsocial sciences are also starting to explain
p172
aVhow important
p173
aVour intrinsic motivations are to us,
p174
aVhow much we do things because we like to do them
p175
aVrather than because our boss told us to do them,
p176
aVor because we're being paid to do them.
p177
aa(lp178
VThis is a graph from a paper
p179
aVby Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini,
p180
aVwho set out to test, at the beginning of this decade,
p181
aVwhat they called "deterrence theory."
p182
aVAnd deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior:
p183
aVIf you want somebody to do less of something,
p184
aVadd a punishment and they'll do less of it.
p185
aVSimple, straightforward, commonsensical \u2014
p186
aValso, largely untested.
p187
aVAnd so they went and studied
p188
aV10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.
p189
aVThey studied those daycare centers
p190
aVat the time of highest tension,
p191
aVwhich is pick-up time.
p192
aVAt pick-up time the teachers,
p193
aVwho have been with your children all day,
p194
aVwould like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back.
p195
aVMeanwhile, the parents \u2014 perhaps a little busy at work, running late, running errands \u2014
p196
aVwant a little slack to pick the kids up late.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo Gneezy and Rustichini said,
p199
aV"How many instances of late pick-ups
p200
aVare there at these 10 daycare centers?"
p201
aVNow they saw \u2014 and this is what the graph is,
p202
aVthese are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals \u2014
p203
aVthat there were between six and 10
p204
aVinstances of late pick-ups
p205
aVon average in these 10 daycare centers.
p206
aVSo they divided the daycare centers into two groups.
p207
aVThe white group there
p208
aVis the control group; they change nothing.
p209
aVBut the group of daycare centers represented by the black line,
p210
aVthey said, "We are changing this bargain
p211
aVas of right now.
p212
aVIf you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late,
p213
aVwe're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill.
p214
aVBoom. No ifs, ands or buts."
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd the minute they did that,
p217
aVthe behavior in those daycare centers changed.
p218
aVLate pick-ups went up
p219
aVevery week for the next four weeks
p220
aVuntil they topped out at triple the pre-fine average,
p221
aVand then they fluctuated
p222
aVat between double and triple the pre-fine average
p223
aVfor the life of the fine.
p224
aVAnd you can see immediately what happened, right?
p225
aVThe fine broke the culture
p226
aVof the daycare center.
p227
aVBy adding a fine,
p228
aVwhat they did was communicate to the parents
p229
aVthat their entire debt to the teachers
p230
aVhad been discharged
p231
aVwith the payment of 10 shekels,
p232
aVand that there was no residue of guilt or social concern
p233
aVthat the parents owed the teachers.
p234
aVAnd so the parents, quite sensibly, said,
p235
aV"10 shekels to pick my kid up late?
p236
aVWhat could be bad?"
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VThe explanation of human behavior
p240
aVthat we inherited in the 20th century
p241
aVwas that we are all rational, self-maximizing actors,
p242
aVand in that explanation \u2014
p243
aVthe daycare center had no contract \u2014
p244
aVshould have been operating without any constraints.
p245
aVBut that's not right.
p246
aVThey were operating with social constraints
p247
aVrather than contractual ones.
p248
aVAnd critically, the social constraints
p249
aVcreated a culture that was more generous
p250
aVthan the contractual constraints did.
p251
aVSo Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks \u2014
p252
aVrun the fine for a dozen weeks \u2014
p253
aVand then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine."
p254
aVAnd then a really interesting thing happens:
p255
aVNothing changes.
p256
aVThe culture that got broken by the fine
p257
aVstayed broken when the fine was removed.
p258
aVNot only are economic motivations
p259
aVand intrinsic motivations
p260
aVincompatible,
p261
aVthat incompatibility
p262
aVcan persist over long periods.
p263
aVSo the trick
p264
aVin designing these kinds of situations
p265
aVis to understand where you're relying on
p266
aVthe economic part of the bargain \u2014 as with the parents paying the teachers \u2014
p267
aVand when you're relying on the social part of the bargain,
p268
aVwhen you're really designing for generosity.
p269
aa(lp270
VThis brings me back to the LOLcats
p271
aVand to Ushahidi.
p272
aVThis is, I think, the range that matters.
p273
aVBoth of these rely on cognitive surplus.
p274
aVBoth of these design for the assumption
p275
aVthat people like to create and we want to share.
p276
aVHere is the critical difference between these:
p277
aVLOLcats is communal value.
p278
aVIt's value created by the participants
p279
aVfor each other.
p280
aVCommunal value on the networks we have
p281
aVis everywhere \u2014
p282
aVevery time you see a large aggregate
p283
aVof shared, publicly available data,
p284
aVwhether it's photos on Flickr
p285
aVor videos on Youtube or whatever.
p286
aVThis is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy,
p287
aVmaybe a little more even,
p288
aVbut this is also
p289
aVa largely solved problem.
p290
aVI have a hard time envisioning a future
p291
aVin which someone is saying,
p292
aV"Where, oh where, can I find a picture
p293
aVof a cute cat?"
p294
aa(lp295
VUshahidi, by contrast,
p296
aVis civic value.
p297
aVIt's value created by the participants
p298
aVbut enjoyed by society as a whole.
p299
aVThe goals set out by Ushahidi
p300
aVare not just to make life better
p301
aVfor the participants,
p302
aVbut to make life better for everyone in the society
p303
aVin which Ushahidi is operating.
p304
aVAnd that kind of civic value
p305
aVis not just a side effect
p306
aVof opening up to human motivation.
p307
aVIt really is going to be a side effect
p308
aVof what we, collectively,
p309
aVmake of these kinds of efforts.
p310
aVThere are a trillion
p311
aVhours a year
p312
aVof participatory value
p313
aVup for grabs.
p314
aVThat will be true year-in and year-out.
p315
aVThe number of people who are going to be able
p316
aVto participate in these kinds of projects
p317
aVis going to grow,
p318
aVand we can see that organizations
p319
aVdesigned around a culture of generosity
p320
aVcan achieve incredible effects
p321
aVwithout an enormous amount of contractual overhead \u2014
p322
aVa very different model
p323
aVthan our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century.
p324
aa(lp325
VWhat's going to make the difference here
p326
aVis what Dean Kamen said,
p327
aVthe inventor and entrepreneur.
p328
aVKamen said, "Free cultures get what they celebrate."
p329
aVWe've got a choice before us.
p330
aVWe've got this trillion hours a year.
p331
aVWe can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that.
p332
aVThat, we get for free.
p333
aVBut we can also celebrate
p334
aVand support and reward the people
p335
aVtrying to use cognitive surplus
p336
aVto create civic value.
p337
aVAnd to the degree we're going to do that, to the degree we're able to do that,
p338
aVwe'll be able to change society.
p339
aa(lp340

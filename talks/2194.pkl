VIn the mid-'90s,
p5
aVthe CDC and Kaiser Permanente
p6
aVdiscovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk
p7
aVfor seven out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the United States.
p8
aVIn high doses, it affects brain development,
p9
aVthe immune system, hormonal systems,
p10
aVand even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.
p11
aVFolks who are exposed in very high doses
p12
aVhave triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer
p13
aVand a 20-year difference in life expectancy.
p14
aVAnd yet, doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment.
p15
aVNow, the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical.
p16
aVIt's childhood trauma.
p17
aa(lp18
VOkay. What kind of trauma am I talking about here?
p19
aVI'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game.
p20
aVI am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive
p21
aVthat they literally get under our skin and change our physiology:
p22
aVthings like abuse or neglect,
p23
aVor growing up with a parent  who struggles with mental illness
p24
aVor substance dependence.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, for a long time,
p27
aVI viewed these things in the way  I was trained to view them,
p28
aVeither as a social problem \u2014 refer to social services \u2014
p29
aVor as a mental health problem \u2014 refer to mental health services.
p30
aVAnd then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach.
p31
aVWhen I finished my residency,
p32
aVI wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed,
p33
aVsomeplace where I could make a difference.
p34
aVSo I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center,
p35
aVone of the best private hospitals in Northern California,
p36
aVand together, we opened a clinic in Bayview-Hunters Point,
p37
aVone of the poorest, most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco.
p38
aVNow, prior to that point,
p39
aVthere had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview
p40
aVto serve more than 10,000 children,
p41
aVso we hung a shingle, and we were able to provide top-quality care
p42
aVregardless of ability to pay.
p43
aVIt was so cool. We targeted the typical health disparities:
p44
aVaccess to care, immunization rates, asthma hospitalization rates,
p45
aVand we hit all of our numbers.
p46
aVWe felt very proud of ourselves.
p47
aa(lp48
VBut then I started noticing a disturbing trend.
p49
aVA lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD,
p50
aVor Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,
p51
aVbut when I actually did a thorough history and physical,
p52
aVwhat I found was that for most of my patients,
p53
aVI couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD.
p54
aVMost of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma
p55
aVthat it felt like something else was going on.
p56
aVSomehow I was missing something important.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, before I did my residency, I did a master's degree in public health,
p59
aVand one of the things that they teach you in public health school
p60
aVis that if you're a doctor
p61
aVand you see 100 kids that all drink from the same well,
p62
aVand 98 of them develop diarrhea,
p63
aVyou can go ahead and write that prescription
p64
aVfor dose after dose after dose of antibiotics,
p65
aVor you can walk over and say, "What the hell is in this well?"
p66
aVSo I began reading everything that I could get my hands on
p67
aVabout how exposure to adversity
p68
aVaffects the developing brains and bodies of children.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd then one day, my colleague walked into my office,
p71
aVand he said, "Dr. Burke, have you seen this?"
p72
aVIn his hand was a copy of a research study
p73
aVcalled the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study.
p74
aVThat day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career.
p75
aa(lp76
VThe Adverse Childhood Experiences Study
p77
aVis something that everybody needs to know about.
p78
aVIt was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC,
p79
aVand together, they asked 17,500 adults about their history of exposure
p80
aVto what they called "adverse  childhood experiences," or ACEs.
p81
aVThose include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse;
p82
aVphysical or emotional neglect;
p83
aVparental mental illness, substance dependence, incarceration;
p84
aVparental separation or divorce;
p85
aVor domestic violence.
p86
aVFor every yes, you would get a point on your ACE score.
p87
aVAnd then what they did
p88
aVwas they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes.
p89
aVWhat they found was striking.
p90
aVTwo things:
p91
aVNumber one, ACEs are incredibly common.
p92
aVSixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ACE,
p93
aVand 12.6 percent, one in eight, had four or more ACEs.
p94
aVThe second thing that they found
p95
aVwas that there was a dose-response relationship
p96
aVbetween ACEs and health outcomes:
p97
aVthe higher your ACE score, the worse your health outcomes.
p98
aVFor a person with an ACE score of four or more,
p99
aVtheir relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
p100
aVwas two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero.
p101
aVFor hepatitis, it was also two and a half times.
p102
aVFor depression, it was four and a half times.
p103
aVFor suicidality, it was 12 times.
p104
aVA person with an ACE score of seven or more
p105
aVhad triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer
p106
aVand three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease,
p107
aVthe number one killer in the United States of America.
p108
aa(lp109
VWell, of course this makes sense.
p110
aVSome people looked at this data and they said, "Come on.
p111
aVYou have a rough childhood, you're more likely to drink and smoke
p112
aVand do all these things that are going to ruin your health.
p113
aVThis isn't science. This is just bad behavior."
p114
aa(lp115
VIt turns out this is exactly where the science comes in.
p116
aVWe now understand better than we ever have before
p117
aVhow exposure to early adversity
p118
aVaffects the developing brains and bodies of children.
p119
aVIt affects areas like the nucleus accumbens,
p120
aVthe pleasure and reward center of the brain
p121
aVthat is implicated in substance dependence.
p122
aVIt inhibits the prefrontal cortex,
p123
aVwhich is necessary for impulse control and executive function,
p124
aVa critical area for learning.
p125
aVAnd on MRI scans,
p126
aVwe see measurable differences in the amygdala,
p127
aVthe brain's fear response center.
p128
aVSo there are real neurologic reasons
p129
aVwhy folks exposed to high doses of adversity
p130
aVare more likely to engage in high-risk behavior,
p131
aVand that's important to know.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior,
p134
aVyou're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer.
p135
aVThe reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis,
p136
aVthe brain's and body's stress response system
p137
aVthat governs our fight-or-flight response.
p138
aVHow does it work?
p139
aVWell, imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear.
p140
aVImmediately, your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary,
p141
aVwhich sends a signal  to your adrenal gland that says,
p142
aV"Release stress hormones! Adrenaline! Cortisol!"
p143
aVAnd so your heart starts to pound,
p144
aVYour pupils dilate, your airways open up,
p145
aVand you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear.
p146
aVAnd that is wonderful
p147
aVif you're in a forest and there's a bear.
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aVBut the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night,
p150
aVand this system is activated over and over and over again,
p151
aVand it goes from being adaptive, or life-saving,
p152
aVto maladaptive, or health-damaging.
p153
aVChildren are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation,
p154
aVbecause their brains and bodies are just developing.
p155
aVHigh doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function,
p156
aVthey affect the developing immune system,
p157
aVdeveloping hormonal systems,
p158
aVand even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo for me, this information threw my old training out the window,
p161
aVbecause when we understand the mechanism of a disease,
p162
aVwhen we know not only which pathways are disrupted, but how,
p163
aVthen as doctors, it is our job to use this science
p164
aVfor prevention and treatment.
p165
aVThat's what we do.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo in San Francisco, we created the Center for Youth Wellness
p168
aVto prevent, screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress.
p169
aVWe started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids
p170
aVat their regular physical,
p171
aVbecause I know that if my patient  has an ACE score of 4,
p172
aVshe's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD,
p173
aVshe's four and half times as likely to become depressed,
p174
aVand she's 12 times as likely to attempt to take her own life
p175
aVas my patient with zero ACEs.
p176
aVI know that when she's in my exam room.
p177
aVFor our patients who do screen positive,
p178
aVwe have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity
p179
aVand treat symptoms using best practices, including home visits, care coordination,
p180
aVmental health care, nutrition,
p181
aVholistic interventions, and yes, medication when necessary.
p182
aVBut we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress
p183
aVthe same way you would for covering electrical outlets, or lead poisoning,
p184
aVand we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics
p185
aVin a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment,
p186
aVgiven the changes to their hormonal and immune systems.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo the other thing that happens when you understand this science
p189
aVis that you want to shout it from the rooftops,
p190
aVbecause this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview.
p191
aVI figured the minute that everybody else heard about this,
p192
aVit would be routine screening, multi-disciplinary treatment teams,
p193
aVand it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols.
p194
aVYeah. That did not happen.
p195
aVAnd that was a huge learning for me.
p196
aVWhat I had thought of as simply best clinical practice
p197
aVI now understand to be a movement.
p198
aVIn the words of Dr. Robert Block,
p199
aVthe former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics,
p200
aV"Adverse childhood experiences
p201
aVare the single greatest unaddressed public health threat
p202
aVfacing our nation today."
p203
aVAnd for a lot of people, that's a terrifying prospect.
p204
aVThe scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming
p205
aVto think about how we might approach it.
p206
aVBut for me, that's actually where the hopes lies,
p207
aVbecause when we have the right framework,
p208
aVwhen we recognize this to be a public health crisis,
p209
aVthen we can begin to use the right  tool kit to come up with solutions.
p210
aVFrom tobacco to lead poisoning  to HIV/AIDS,
p211
aVthe United States actually has quite a strong track record
p212
aVwith addressing public health problems,
p213
aVbut replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress
p214
aVis going to take determination and commitment,
p215
aVand when I look at what our nation's response has been so far,
p216
aVI wonder,
p217
aVwhy haven't we taken this more seriously?
p218
aa(lp219
VYou know, at first I thought that we marginalized the issue
p220
aVbecause it doesn't apply to us.
p221
aVThat's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods.
p222
aVWhich is weird, because the data doesn't bear that out.
p223
aVThe original ACEs study was done in a population
p224
aVthat was 70 percent Caucasian,
p225
aV70 percent college-educated.
p226
aVBut then, the more I talked to folks,
p227
aVI'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards.
p228
aVIf I were to ask how many people in this room
p229
aVgrew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness,
p230
aVI bet a few hands would go up.
p231
aVAnd then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much,
p232
aVor who really believed that if you spare the rod, you spoil the child,
p233
aVI bet a few more hands would go up.
p234
aVEven in this room, this is an issue that touches many of us,
p235
aVand I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue
p236
aVbecause it does apply to us.
p237
aVMaybe it's easier to see in other zip codes
p238
aVbecause we don't want to look at it.
p239
aVWe'd rather be sick.
p240
aa(lp241
VFortunately, scientific advances and, frankly, economic realities
p242
aVmake that option less viable every day.
p243
aVThe science is clear:
p244
aVEarly adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime.
p245
aVToday, we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression
p246
aVfrom early adversity to disease and early death,
p247
aVand 30 years from now,
p248
aVthe child who has a high ACE score
p249
aVand whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized,
p250
aVwhose asthma management is not connected,
p251
aVand who goes on to develop high blood pressure
p252
aVand early heart disease or cancer
p253
aVwill be just as anomalous as a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS.
p254
aVPeople will look at that situation and say, "What the heck happened there?"
p255
aVThis is treatable.
p256
aVThis is beatable.
p257
aVThe single most important thing that we need today
p258
aVis the courage to look this problem in the face
p259
aVand say, this is real and this is all of us.
p260
aVI believe that we are the movement.
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you.

VI'd like to start by asking you all to go to your happy place, please.
p5
aVYes, your happy place,
p6
aVI know you've got one even if it's fake.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VOK, so, comfortable?
p11
aVGood.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow I'd like to you to mentally answer the following questions.
p14
aVIs there any strip lighting in your happy place?
p15
aVAny plastic tables?
p16
aVPolyester flooring?
p17
aVMobile phones?
p18
aVNo?
p19
aVI think we all know that our happy place
p20
aVis meant to be somewhere natural, outdoors \u2014
p21
aVon a beach, fireside.
p22
aVWe'll be reading or eating or knitting.
p23
aVAnd we're surrounded by natural light and organic elements.
p24
aVNatural things make us happy.
p25
aVAnd happiness is a great motivator; we strive for happiness.
p26
aVPerhaps that's why we're always redesigning everything,
p27
aVin the hopes that our solutions might feel more natural.
p28
aVSo let's start there \u2014
p29
aVwith the idea that good design should feel natural.
p30
aa(lp31
VYour phone is not very natural.
p32
aVAnd you probably think you're addicted to your phone,
p33
aVbut you're really not.
p34
aVWe're not addicted to devices,
p35
aVwe're addicted to the information that flows through them.
p36
aVI wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place
p37
aVwithout any information from the outside world.
p38
aVI'm interested in how we access that information,
p39
aVhow we experience it.
p40
aVWe're moving from a time of static information,
p41
aVheld in books and libraries and bus stops,
p42
aVthrough a period of digital information,
p43
aVtowards a period of fluid information,
p44
aVwhere your children will expect to be able to access anything, anywhere at any time,
p45
aVfrom quantum physics to medieval viticulture,
p46
aVfrom gender theory to tomorrow's weather,
p47
aVjust like switching on a lightbulb \u2014
p48
aVImagine that.
p49
aa(lp50
VHumans also like simple tools.
p51
aVYour phone is not a very simple tool.
p52
aVA fork is a simple tool.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd we don't like them made of plastic,
p57
aVin the same way I don't really like my phone very much \u2014
p58
aVit's not how I want to experience information.
p59
aa(lp60
VI think there are better solutions than a world mediated by screens.
p61
aVI don't hate screens, but I don't feel \u2014
p62
aVand I don't think any of us feel that good
p63
aVabout how much time we spend slouched over them.
p64
aVFortunately,
p65
aVthe big tech companies seem to agree.
p66
aVThey're actually heavily invested in touch and speech and gesture,
p67
aVand also in senses \u2014
p68
aVthings that can turn dumb objects, like cups,
p69
aVand imbue them with the magic of the Internet,
p70
aVpotentially turning this digital cloud
p71
aVinto something we might touch and move.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe parents in crisis over screen time
p74
aVneed physical digital toys teaching their kids to read,
p75
aVas well as family-safe app stores.
p76
aVAnd I think, actually, that's already really happening.
p77
aa(lp78
VReality is richer than screens.
p79
aVFor example, I love books.
p80
aVFor me they are time machines \u2014 atoms and molecules bound in space,
p81
aVfrom the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience.
p82
aVBut frankly,
p83
aVthe content's identical on my phone.
p84
aVSo what makes this a richer experience than a screen?
p85
aVI mean, scientifically.
p86
aVWe need screens, of course.
p87
aVI'm going to show film, I need the enormous screen.
p88
aVBut there's more than you can do with these magic boxes.
p89
aVYour phone is not the Internet's door bitch.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VWe can build things \u2014 physical things,
p94
aVusing physics and pixels,
p95
aVthat can integrate the Internet into the world around us.
p96
aVAnd I'm going to show you a few examples of those.
p97
aa(lp98
VA while ago, I got to work with a design agency, Berg,
p99
aVon an exploration of what the Internet without screens might actually look like.
p100
aVAnd they showed us a range ways
p101
aVthat light can work with simple senses and physical objects
p102
aVto really bring the Internet to life, to make it tangible.
p103
aVLike this wonderfully mechanical YouTube player.
p104
aVAnd this was an inspiration to me.
p105
aa(lp106
VNext I worked with the Japanese agency, AQ,
p107
aVon a research project into mental health.
p108
aVWe wanted to create an object
p109
aVthat could capture the subjective data around mood swings
p110
aVthat's so essential to diagnosis.
p111
aVThis object captures your touch,
p112
aVso you might press it very hard if you're angry,
p113
aVor stroke it if you're calm.
p114
aVIt's like a digital emoji stick.
p115
aVAnd then you might revisit those moments later,
p116
aVand add context to them online.
p117
aVMost of all,
p118
aVwe wanted to create an intimate, beautiful thing
p119
aVthat could live in your pocket
p120
aVand be loved.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe binoculars are actually a birthday present
p123
aVfor the Sydney Opera House's 40th anniversary.
p124
aVOur friends at Tellart in Boston brought over a pair of street binoculars,
p125
aVthe kind you might find on the Empire State Building,
p126
aVand they fitted them with 360-degree views
p127
aVof other iconic world heritage sights \u2014
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
Vusing Street View.
p132
aVAnd then we stuck them under the steps.
p133
aVSo, they became this very physical, simple reappropriation,
p134
aVor like a portal to these other icons.
p135
aVSo you might see Versailles or Shackleton's Hut.
p136
aVBasically, it's virtual reality circa 1955.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VIn our office we use hacky sacks to exchange URLs.
p141
aVThis is incredibly simple, it's like your Opal card.
p142
aVYou basically put a website on the little chip in here,
p143
aVand then you do this and ... bosh! \u2014
p144
aVthe website appears on your phone.
p145
aVIt's about 10 cents.
p146
aa(lp147
VTreehugger is a project that we're working on
p148
aVwith Grumpy Sailor and Finch, here in Sydney.
p149
aVAnd I'm very excited about what might happen
p150
aVwhen you pull the phones apart and you put the bits into trees,
p151
aVand that my children might have an opportunity
p152
aVto visit an enchanted forest guided by a magic wand,
p153
aVwhere they could talk to digital fairies and ask them questions,
p154
aVand be asked questions in return.
p155
aVAs you can see,
p156
aVwe're at the cardboard stage with this one.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VBut I'm very excited
p161
aVby the possibility of getting kids back outside without screens,
p162
aVbut with all the powerful magic of the Internet at their fingertips.
p163
aVAnd we hope to have something like this working by the end of the year.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo let's recap.
p166
aVHumans like natural solutions.
p167
aVHumans love information.
p168
aVHumans need simple tools.
p169
aVThese principles should underpin how we design for the future,
p170
aVnot just for the Internet.
p171
aVYou may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we're moving into.
p172
aVYou may feel challenged, rather than simply excited.
p173
aVGuess what? Me too.
p174
aVIt's a really extraordinary period of human history.
p175
aa(lp176
VWe are the people that actually build our world,
p177
aVthere are no artificial intelligences...
p178
aVyet.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VIt's us \u2014 designers, architects, artists, engineers.
p183
aVAnd if we challenge ourselves,
p184
aVI think that actually we can have a happy place
p185
aVfilled with the information we love
p186
aVthat feels as natural and as simple as switching on lightbulb.
p187
aVAnd although it may seem inevitable,
p188
aVthat what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets,
p189
aVmaybe we could give a bit of thought to cork and light and hacky sacks.
p190
aa(lp191
VThank you very much.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)

She works with cultural organizations and practitioners to enable artists, writers and performers to look at new ways in which we can use digital technology to augment traditional art, theatre and music. Uglow believes that by experimenting with digital tools at the creative core of culture we can transform existing cultural practice without losing the tradition, values and intangible qualities that make the arts so valuable.</p><p>Previous projects include&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://editionsatplay.withgoogle.com/#/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Editions at Play</a>&nbsp;(books), Hangouts in History (education), Dream40 (theatre, with the RSC),&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.buildwithchrome.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Build with Chrome</a>&nbsp;(with LEGO),&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.chromeweblab.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Web Lab</a>&nbsp;(with London&#39;s Science Museum),&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/user/lifeinaday\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Life in a Day</a>&nbsp;(YouTube film with Ridley Scott) and the&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/user/symphony\\" target=\\"_blank\\">YouTube Symphony Orchestra</a>&nbsp;(with the LSO).

She spent six years in art&nbsp;publishing and design management for charities as well as in various digital start-ups before joining Google in 2006. Prior to Google, Uglow worked for the Royal Academy of Arts, the Wellcome Trust, Random House and Christian Aid.

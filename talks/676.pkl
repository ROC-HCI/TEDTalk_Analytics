VI'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view,
p5
aVand perhaps my faith is not very well thought of
p6
aVas being one that is grounded in compassion.
p7
aVThe truth of the matter is otherwise.
p8
aa(lp9
VOur holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters,
p10
aVand each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,
p11
aVthe saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,"
p12
aVor, as Sir Richard Burton \u2014
p13
aVnot the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor,
p14
aVbut the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that
p15
aVand who was a worldwide traveler
p16
aVand translator of many works of literature \u2014
p17
aVtranslates it. "In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate."
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity,
p20
aVGod says to his prophet Muhammad \u2014
p21
aVwhom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets,
p22
aVbeginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham,
p23
aVincluding Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad \u2014
p24
aVthat, "We have not sent you, O Muhammad,
p25
aVexcept as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity."
p26
aa(lp27
VFor us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims,
p28
aVwhose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet
p29
aVis to make ourselves as much like the prophet.
p30
aVAnd the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,
p31
aV"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God."
p32
aVAnd because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion \u2014
p33
aVin fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion,"
p34
aVor, "reigned himself in by compassion" \u2014
p35
aVtherefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,
p36
aVactivators of compassion, actors of compassion
p37
aVand speakers of compassion and doers of compassion.
p38
aa(lp39
VThat is all well and good,
p40
aVbut where do we go wrong,
p41
aVand what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?
p42
aVFor the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path.
p43
aVIn every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path,
p44
aVor the exoteric path and the esoteric path.
p45
aVThe esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or "tasawwuf" in Arabic.
p46
aVAnd these doctors or these masters,
p47
aVthese spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition,
p48
aVrefer to teachings and examples of our prophet
p49
aVthat teach us where the source of our problems lies.
p50
aa(lp51
VIn one of the battles that the prophet waged,
p52
aVhe told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war
p53
aVto the greater war, to the greater battle."
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd they said, "Messenger of God, we are battle-weary.
p56
aVHow can we go to a greater battle?"
p57
aa(lp58
VHe said, "That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego."
p59
aVThe sources of human problems have to do with egotism, "I."
p60
aa(lp61
VThe famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you,
p62
aVhas a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend,
p63
aVand he knocks on the door,
p64
aVand a voice answers, "Who's there?"
p65
aa(lp66
V"It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I,"
p67
aVas we might say in English.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe voice says, "Go away."
p70
aa(lp71
VAfter many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle,
p72
aVhe comes back.
p73
aVWith much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe voice asks, "Who is there?"
p76
aa(lp77
VHe said, "It is you, O heartbreaker."
p78
aa(lp79
VThe door swings open, and the voice says,
p80
aV"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,"
p81
aV\u2014 two capital I's, not these eyes \u2014 "for two egos."
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.
p84
aVIn the presence of God, there is no room for more than one "I,"
p85
aVand that is the "I" of divinity.
p86
aVIn a teaching \u2014 called a "hadith qudsi" in our tradition \u2014
p87
aVGod says that, "My servant," or "My creature, my human creature,
p88
aVdoes not approach me by anything that is dearer to me
p89
aVthan what I have asked them to do."
p90
aVAnd those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.
p91
aVYou want your employees to do what you ask them to do,
p92
aVand if they've done that, then they can do extra.
p93
aVBut don't ignore what you've asked them to do.
p94
aa(lp95
V"And," God says, "my servant continues to get nearer to me,
p96
aVby doing more of what I've asked them to do" \u2014
p97
aVextra credit, we might call it \u2014
p98
aV"until I love him or love her.
p99
aVAnd when I love my servant," God says,
p100
aV"I become the eyes by which he or she sees,
p101
aVthe ears by which he or she listens,
p102
aVthe hand by which he or she grasps,
p103
aVand the foot by which he or she walks,
p104
aVand the heart by which he or she understands."
p105
aVIt is this merging of our self with divinity
p106
aVthat is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.
p107
aa(lp108
VMuslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism,
p109
aVthe greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.
p110
aVWhen he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way,"
p111
aVand when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God,"
p112
aVit is because they became so much an instrument of God,
p113
aVthey became part of God's team \u2014
p114
aVso that God's will was manifest through them,
p115
aVand they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.
p116
aVCompassion on earth is given, it is in us.
p117
aVAll we have to do is to get our egos out of the way,
p118
aVget our egotism out of the way.
p119
aa(lp120
VI'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you,
p121
aVhave had what you might call a spiritual experience,
p122
aVa moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps,
p123
aVthe boundaries of your ego dissolved.
p124
aVAnd at that minute, you felt at one with the universe \u2014
p125
aVone with that jug of water, one with every human being,
p126
aVone with the Creator \u2014
p127
aVand you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe,
p128
aVof the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy
p129
aVthat you have ever experienced in your lives.
p130
aa(lp131
VThat is a moment which is a gift of God to us \u2014
p132
aVa gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary
p133
aVwhich makes us insist on "I, I, I, me, me, me,"
p134
aVand instead, like the person in Rumi's story,
p135
aVwe say, "Oh, this is all you.
p136
aVThis is all you. And this is all us.
p137
aVAnd us, and I, and us are all part of you.
p138
aVO, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being
p139
aVand the end of our journey,
p140
aVyou are also the breaker of our hearts.
p141
aVYou are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live,
p142
aVand for whose purpose we shall die,
p143
aVand for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again
p144
aVto account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings."
p145
aa(lp146
VOur message today, and our purpose today,
p147
aVand those of you who are here today,
p148
aVand the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.
p149
aVFor the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other,
p150
aVbecause the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
p151
aa(lp152
VWe know it all.
p153
aVWe have access to it all.
p154
aVJung may have called it "the subconscious."
p155
aVThrough our subconscious, in your dreams \u2014
p156
aVthe Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death,"
p157
aV"the temporary death" \u2014
p158
aVin our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions,
p159
aVwe travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us,
p160
aVand we see wonderful things.
p161
aVWe travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it,
p162
aVand beyond the limitations of time as we know it.
p163
aVBut all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator
p164
aVwhose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.
p165
aa(lp166
VGod, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om,
p167
aVwhatever the name might be through which you name
p168
aVor access the presence of divinity,
p169
aVit is the locus of absolute being,
p170
aVabsolute love and mercy and compassion,
p171
aVand absolute knowledge and wisdom,
p172
aVwhat Hindus call "satchidananda."
p173
aVThe language differs,
p174
aVbut the objective is the same.
p175
aa(lp176
VRumi has another story
p177
aVabout three men, a Turk, an Arab and \u2014
p178
aVand I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.
p179
aVOne is asking for angur \u2014 one is, say, an Englishman \u2014
p180
aVone is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.
p181
aVAnd they have a fight and an argument because
p182
aV\u2014 "I want grapes." "I want eneb. "I want angur." \u2014
p183
aVnot knowing that the word that they're using
p184
aVrefers to the same reality in different languages.
p185
aa(lp186
VThere's only one absolute reality by definition,
p187
aVone absolute being by definition,
p188
aVbecause absolute is, by definition, single,
p189
aVand absolute and singular.
p190
aVThere's this absolute concentration of being,
p191
aVthe absolute concentration of consciousness,
p192
aVawareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love
p193
aVthat defines the primary attributes of divinity.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd these should also be
p196
aVthe primary attributes of what it means to be human.
p197
aVFor what defines humanity, perhaps biologically,
p198
aVis our physiology,
p199
aVbut God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says,
p202
aV"When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay,
p203
aVand breathed into him of my spirit,
p204
aVthen, fall in prostration to him."
p205
aVThe angels prostrate, not before the human body,
p206
aVbut before the human soul.
p207
aVWhy? Because the soul, the human soul,
p208
aVembodies a piece of the divine breath,
p209
aVa piece of the divine soul.
p210
aa(lp211
VThis is also expressed in biblical vocabulary
p212
aVwhen we are taught that we were created in the divine image.
p213
aVWhat is the imagery of God?
p214
aVThe imagery of God is absolute being,
p215
aVabsolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom
p216
aVand absolute compassion and love.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd therefore, for us to be human \u2014
p219
aVin the greatest sense of what it means to be human,
p220
aVin the most joyful sense of what it means to be human \u2014
p221
aVmeans that we too have to be proper stewards
p222
aVof the breath of divinity within us,
p223
aVand seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being,
p224
aVof being alive, of beingness;
p225
aVthe attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness;
p226
aVand the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings.
p227
aa(lp228
VThis is what I understand from my faith tradition,
p229
aVand this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions,
p230
aVand this is the common platform on which we must all stand,
p231
aVand when we stand on this platform as such,
p232
aVI am convinced that we can make a wonderful world.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd I believe, personally, that we're on the verge
p235
aVand that, with the presence and help of people like you here,
p236
aVwe can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.
p237
aVFor he foretold of a period
p238
aVwhen people shall transform their swords into plowshares
p239
aVand will not learn war or make war anymore.
p240
aa(lp241
VWe have reached a stage in human history that we have no option:
p242
aVwe must, we must lower our egos,
p243
aVcontrol our egos \u2014 whether it is individual ego, personal ego,
p244
aVfamily ego, national ego \u2014
p245
aVand let all be for the glorification of the one.
p246
aa(lp247
VThank you, and God bless you.
p248
aV(Applause)

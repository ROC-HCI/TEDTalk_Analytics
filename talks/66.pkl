(lp3
(lp4
VGood morning. How are you?
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VIt's been great, hasn't it?
p9
aVI've been blown away by the whole thing.
p10
aVIn fact, I'm leaving.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VThere have been three themes running through the conference
p15
aVwhich are relevant to what I want to talk about.
p16
aVOne is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity
p17
aVin all of the presentations that we've had
p18
aVand in all of the people here.
p19
aVJust the variety of it and the range of it.
p20
aVThe second is that it's put us in a place
p21
aVwhere we have no idea what's going to happen,
p22
aVin terms of the future.
p23
aVNo idea how this may play out.
p24
aa(lp25
VI have an interest in education.
p26
aVActually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education.
p27
aVDon't you?
p28
aVI find this very interesting.
p29
aVIf you're at a dinner party,
p30
aVand you say you work in education \u2014
p31
aVActually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VIf you work in education, you're not asked.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me.
p40
aVBut if you are, and you say to somebody,
p41
aVyou know, they say, "What do you do?"
p42
aVand you say you work in education,
p43
aVyou can see the blood run from their face.
p44
aVThey're like, "Oh my God," you know, "Why me?"
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
V"My one night out all week."
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VBut if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall.
p53
aVBecause it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right?
p54
aVLike religion, and money and other things.
p55
aVSo I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.
p56
aVWe have a huge vested interest in it,
p57
aVpartly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future
p58
aVthat we can't grasp.
p59
aVIf you think of it, children starting school this year
p60
aVwill be retiring in 2065.
p61
aVNobody has a clue,
p62
aVdespite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days,
p63
aVwhat the world will look like in five years' time.
p64
aVAnd yet we're meant to be educating them for it.
p65
aVSo the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd the third part of this
p68
aVis that we've all agreed, nonetheless,
p69
aVon the really extraordinary capacities that children have \u2014
p70
aVtheir capacities for innovation.
p71
aVI mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she?
p72
aVJust seeing what she could do.
p73
aVAnd she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak,
p74
aVexceptional in the whole of childhood.
p75
aVWhat you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication
p76
aVwho found a talent.
p77
aVAnd my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents.
p78
aVAnd we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo I want to talk about education
p81
aVand I want to talk about creativity.
p82
aVMy contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy,
p83
aVand we should treat it with the same status.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Applause) Thank you.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Applause)
p88
aa(lp89
VThat was it, by the way.
p90
aVThank you very much.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VSo, 15 minutes left.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VWell, I was born... no.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VI heard a great story recently \u2014 I love telling it \u2014
p103
aVof a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.
p104
aVShe was six, and she was at the back, drawing,
p105
aVand the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention,
p106
aVand in this drawing lesson, she did.
p107
aVThe teacher was fascinated.
p108
aVShe went over to her, and she said, "What are you drawing?"
p109
aVAnd the girl said, "I'm drawing a picture of God."
p110
aVAnd the teacher said, "But nobody knows what God looks like."
p111
aVAnd the girl said, "They will, in a minute."
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VWhen my son was four in England \u2014
p116
aVActually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VIf we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.
p121
aVHe was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VNo, it was big, it was a big story.
p126
aVMel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
V"Nativity II."
p131
aVBut James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about.
p132
aVWe considered this to be one of the lead parts.
p133
aVWe had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts:
p134
aV"James Robinson IS Joseph!" (Laughter)
p135
aVHe didn't have to speak,
p136
aVbut you know the bit where the three kings come in?
p137
aVThey come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh.
p138
aVThis really happened.
p139
aVWe were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence,
p140
aVbecause we talked to the little boy afterward and we said,
p141
aV"You OK with that?" And he said, "Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"
p142
aVThey just switched.
p143
aVThe three boys came in,
p144
aVfour-year-olds with tea towels on their heads,
p145
aVand they put these boxes down,
p146
aVand the first boy said, "I bring you gold."
p147
aVAnd the second boy said, "I bring you myrrh."
p148
aVAnd the third boy said, "Frank sent this."
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VWhat these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.
p153
aVIf they don't know, they'll have a go.
p154
aVAm I right? They're not frightened of being wrong.
p155
aVI don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.
p156
aVWhat we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong,
p157
aVyou'll never come up with anything original \u2014
p158
aVif you're not prepared to be wrong.
p159
aVAnd by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity.
p160
aVThey have become frightened of being wrong.
p161
aVAnd we run our companies like this.
p162
aVWe stigmatize mistakes.
p163
aVAnd we're now running national education systems
p164
aVwhere mistakes are the worst thing you can make.
p165
aVAnd the result is that we are educating people
p166
aVout of their creative capacities.
p167
aa(lp168
VPicasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.
p169
aVThe problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.
p170
aVI believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity,
p171
aVwe grow out of it.
p172
aVOr rather, we get educated out of it.
p173
aVSo why is this?
p174
aa(lp175
VI lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.
p176
aVIn fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.
p177
aVSo you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VActually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield,
p182
aVjust outside Stratford,
p183
aVwhich is where Shakespeare's father was born.
p184
aVAre you struck by a new thought? I was.
p185
aVYou don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?
p186
aVDo you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?
p187
aVShakespeare being seven?
p188
aVI never thought of it.
p189
aVI mean, he was seven at some point.
p190
aVHe was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VHow annoying would that be?
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
V"Must try harder."
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VBeing sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!
p203
aVAnd put the pencil down."
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
V"And stop speaking like that."
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
V"It's confusing everybody."
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VAnyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles,
p216
aVand I just want to say a word about the transition.
p217
aVMy son didn't want to come.
p218
aVI've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.
p219
aVHe didn't want to come to Los Angeles.
p220
aVHe loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England.
p221
aVThis was the love of his life, Sarah.
p222
aVHe'd known her for a month.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VMind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary,
p227
aVbecause it's a long time when you're 16.
p228
aVHe was really upset on the plane,
p229
aVhe said, "I'll never find another girl like Sarah."
p230
aVAnd we were rather pleased about that, frankly \u2014
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VBecause she was the main reason we were leaving the country.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VBut something strikes you when you move to America
p239
aVand travel around the world:
p240
aVEvery education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.
p241
aVEvery one. Doesn't matter where you go.
p242
aVYou'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't.
p243
aVAt the top are mathematics and languages,
p244
aVthen the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts.
p245
aVEverywhere on Earth.
p246
aVAnd in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts.
p247
aVArt and music are normally given a higher status in schools
p248
aVthan drama and dance.
p249
aVThere isn't an education system on the planet
p250
aVthat teaches dance everyday to children
p251
aVthe way we teach them mathematics. Why?
p252
aVWhy not? I think this is rather important.
p253
aVI think math is very important, but so is dance.
p254
aVChildren dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do.
p255
aVWe all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting?
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VTruthfully, what happens is, as children grow up,
p260
aVwe start to educate them progressively from the waist up.
p261
aVAnd then we focus on their heads.
p262
aVAnd slightly to one side.
p263
aa(lp264
VIf you were to visit education, as an alien,
p265
aVand say "What's it for, public education?"
p266
aVI think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output,
p267
aVwho really succeeds by this,
p268
aVwho does everything that they should,
p269
aVwho gets all the brownie points, who are the winners \u2014
p270
aVI think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education
p271
aVthroughout the world
p272
aVis to produce university professors.
p273
aVIsn't it?
p274
aVThey're the people who come out the top.
p275
aVAnd I used to be one, so there.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd I like university professors, but you know,
p280
aVwe shouldn't hold them up
p281
aVas the high-water mark of all human achievement.
p282
aVThey're just a form of life,
p283
aVanother form of life.
p284
aVBut they're rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them.
p285
aVThere's something curious about professors in my experience \u2014
p286
aVnot all of them, but typically, they live in their heads.
p287
aVThey live up there, and slightly to one side.
p288
aVThey're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.
p289
aVThey look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VDon't they?
p294
aVIt's a way of getting their head to meetings.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VIf you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences,
p299
aVget yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics,
p300
aVand pop into the discotheque on the final night.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd there, you will see it.
p305
aVGrown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VWaiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VOur education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability.
p314
aVAnd there's a reason.
p315
aVAround the world, there were no public systems of education,
p316
aVreally, before the 19th century.
p317
aVThey all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism.
p318
aVSo the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.
p319
aa(lp320
VNumber one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top.
p321
aVSo you were probably steered benignly away
p322
aVfrom things at school when you were a kid, things you liked,
p323
aVon the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right?
p324
aVDon't do music, you're not going to be a musician;
p325
aVdon't do art, you won't be an artist.
p326
aVBenign advice \u2014 now, profoundly mistaken.
p327
aVThe whole world is engulfed in a revolution.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd the second is academic ability,
p330
aVwhich has really come to dominate our view of intelligence,
p331
aVbecause the universities designed the system in their image.
p332
aVIf you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world
p333
aVis a protracted process of university entrance.
p334
aVAnd the consequence is that many highly-talented,
p335
aVbrilliant, creative people think they're not,
p336
aVbecause the thing they were good at at school
p337
aVwasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized.
p338
aVAnd I think we can't afford to go on that way.
p339
aa(lp340
VIn the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,
p341
aVmore people worldwide will be graduating
p342
aVthrough education than since the beginning of history.
p343
aVMore people, and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about \u2014
p344
aVtechnology and its transformation effect on work, and demography
p345
aVand the huge explosion in population.
p346
aa(lp347
VSuddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.
p348
aVIsn't that true?
p349
aVWhen I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job.
p350
aVIf you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one.
p351
aVAnd I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter)
p352
aVBut now kids with degrees
p353
aVare often heading home to carry on playing video games,
p354
aVbecause you need an MA where the previous job required a BA,
p355
aVand now you need a PhD for the other.
p356
aVIt's a process of academic inflation.
p357
aVAnd it indicates the whole structure of education
p358
aVis shifting beneath our feet.
p359
aVWe need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.
p360
aa(lp361
VWe know three things about intelligence.
p362
aVOne, it's diverse.
p363
aVWe think about the world in all the ways that we experience it.
p364
aVWe think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically.
p365
aVWe think in abstract terms, we think in movement.
p366
aVSecondly, intelligence is dynamic.
p367
aVIf you look at the interactions of a human brain,
p368
aVas we heard yesterday from a number of presentations,
p369
aVintelligence is wonderfully interactive.
p370
aVThe brain isn't divided into compartments.
p371
aVIn fact, creativity \u2014 which I define as the process
p372
aVof having original ideas that have value \u2014
p373
aVmore often than not comes about through the interaction
p374
aVof different disciplinary ways of seeing things.
p375
aa(lp376
VBy the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain
p377
aVcalled the corpus callosum.
p378
aVIt's thicker in women.
p379
aVFollowing off from Helen yesterday,
p380
aVthis is probably why women are better at multi-tasking.
p381
aVBecause you are, aren't you?
p382
aVThere's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life.
p383
aVIf my wife is cooking a meal at home \u2014 which is not often, thankfully.
p384
aa(lp385
V(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
VNo, she's good at some things, but if she's cooking,
p388
aVshe's dealing with people on the phone,
p389
aVshe's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling,
p390
aVshe's doing open-heart surgery over here.
p391
aVIf I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out,
p392
aVthe phone's on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed.
p393
aVI say, "Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here."
p394
aa(lp395
V(Laughter)
p396
aa(lp397
V"Give me a break."
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
VActually, do you know that old philosophical thing,
p402
aVif a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen?
p403
aVRemember that old chestnut?
p404
aVI saw a great t-shirt recently, which said,
p405
aV"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him,
p406
aVis he still wrong?"
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VAnd the third thing about intelligence is,
p411
aVit's distinct.
p412
aVI'm doing a new book at the moment called "Epiphany,"
p413
aVwhich is based on a series of interviews with people
p414
aVabout how they discovered their talent.
p415
aVI'm fascinated by how people got to be there.
p416
aVIt's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman
p417
aVwho maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.
p418
aVHave you heard of her? Some have.
p419
aVShe's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work.
p420
aVShe did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."
p421
aVShe's wonderful.
p422
aVI used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet,
p423
aVas you can see.
p424
aVAnyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said,
p425
aV"How did you get to be a dancer?"
p426
aVIt was interesting.
p427
aVWhen she was at school, she was really hopeless.
p428
aVAnd the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said,
p429
aV"We think Gillian has a learning disorder."
p430
aVShe couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting.
p431
aVI think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you?
p432
aVBut this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point.
p433
aVIt wasn't an available condition.
p434
aa(lp435
V(Laughter)
p436
aa(lp437
VPeople weren't aware they could have that.
p438
aa(lp439
V(Laughter)
p440
aa(lp441
VAnyway, she went to see this specialist.
p442
aVSo, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother,
p443
aVand she was led and sat on this chair at the end,
p444
aVand she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother
p445
aVabout the problems Gillian was having at school.
p446
aVBecause she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on,
p447
aVlittle kid of eight.
p448
aVIn the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said,
p449
aV"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me,
p450
aVI need to speak to her privately.
p451
aVWait here. We'll be back; we won't be very long,"
p452
aVand they went and left her.
p453
aa(lp454
VBut as they went out of the room,
p455
aVhe turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk.
p456
aVAnd when they got out, he said to her mother, "Just stand and watch her."
p457
aVAnd the minute they left the room,
p458
aVshe was on her feet, moving to the music.
p459
aVAnd they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said,
p460
aV"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer.
p461
aVTake her to a dance school."
p462
aa(lp463
VI said, "What happened?"
p464
aVShe said, "She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was.
p465
aVWe walked in this room and it was full of people like me.
p466
aVPeople who couldn't sit still.
p467
aVPeople who had to move to think." Who had to move to think.
p468
aVThey did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary.
p469
aVShe was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School;
p470
aVshe became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.
p471
aVShe eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School,
p472
aVfounded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,
p473

aVShe's been responsible for
p475
aVsome of the most successful musical theater productions in history,
p476
aVshe's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multi-millionaire.

aVSomebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.

VWhat I think it comes to is this:
p482
aVAl Gore spoke the other night
p483
aVabout ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson.
p484
aVI believe our only hope for the future
p485
aVis to adopt a new conception of human ecology,
p486
aVone in which we start to reconstitute our conception
p487
aVof the richness of human capacity.
p488
aVOur education system has mined our minds
p489
aVin the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity.
p490
aVAnd for the future, it won't serve us.
p491
aVWe have to rethink the fundamental principles
p492
aVon which we're educating our children.
p493
aa(lp494
VThere was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said,
p495
aV"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth,
p496
aVwithin 50 years all life on Earth would end.
p497
aVIf all human beings disappeared from the Earth,
p498
aVwithin 50 years all forms of life would flourish."
p499
aVAnd he's right.
p500
aa(lp501
VWhat TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination.
p502
aVWe have to be careful now
p503
aVthat we use this gift wisely
p504
aVand that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about.
p505
aVAnd the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities
p506
aVfor the richness they are
p507
aVand seeing our children for the hope that they are.
p508
aVAnd our task is to educate their whole being,
p509
aVso they can face this future.
p510
aVBy the way \u2014 we may not see this future,
p511
aVbut they will.
p512
aVAnd our job is to help them make something of it.

Sir Ken Robinson argues that it&#39;s because we&#39;ve been educated to become good workers, rather than creative thinkers. Students with restless minds and bodies -- far from being cultivated for their energy and curiosity -- are ignored or even stigmatized, with terrible consequences. <strong>&quot;We are educating people out of their creativity,&quot; Robinson says.</strong> It&#39;s a message with deep resonance. Robinson&#39;s TED Talk has been distributed widely around the Web since its release in June 2006. The most popular words framing blog posts on his talk? &quot;Everyone should watch this.&quot; </p><p>A visionary cultural leader, Sir Ken led the British government&#39;s 1998 advisory committee on creative and cultural education, <strong>a massive inquiry into the significance of creativity in the educational system and the economy</strong>, and was knighted in 2003 for his achievements. His 2009 book, <em><a href=\\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=15\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything</a></em>, is a&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 21 languages. A 10th anniversary edition of his classic work on creativity and innovation,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=15\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Out of Our Minds: Learning to be Creative</em></a>, was published in 2011. His 2013 book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=420\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Finding Your Element: How to Discover Your Talents and Passions and Transform Your Life</em></a>, is a practical guide that answers questions about finding your personal Element. In his latest book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/creative-schools-the-grassroots-revolution-thats-transforming-education/\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Creative Schools: The Grassroots Revolution That&rsquo;s Transforming Education</em></a>,&nbsp;he argues for an end to our outmoded industrial educational system and proposes a highly personalized, organic approach that draws on today&rsquo;s unprecedented technological and professional resources to engage all students.</p>", "slug": "sir_ken_robinson", "whotheyare": "Creativity expert Sir Ken Robinson challenges the way we\'re educating our children.

the best out of people? Sir Ken Robinson argues that it&#39;s because we&#39;ve been educated to become good workers, rather than creative thinkers. Students with restless minds and bodies -- far from being cultivated for their energy and curiosity -- are ignored or even stigmatized, with terrible consequences. <strong>&quot;We are educating people out of their creativity,&quot; Robinson says.</strong> It&#39;s a message with deep resonance. Robinson&#39;s TED Talk has been distributed widely around the Web since its release in June 2006. The most popular words framing blog posts on his talk? &quot;Everyone should watch this.&quot; </p><p>A visionary cultural leader, Sir Ken led the British government&#39;s 1998 advisory committee on creative and cultural education, <strong>a massive inquiry into the significance of creativity in the educational system and the economy</strong>, and was knighted in 2003 for his achievements. His 2009 book, <em><a href=\\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=15\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything</a></em>, is a&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 21 languages. A 10th anniversary edition of his classic work on creativity and innovation,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=15\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Out of Our Minds: Learning to be Creative</em></a>, was published in 2011. His 2013 book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=420\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Finding Your Element: How to Discover Your Talents and Passions and Transform Your Life</em></a>, is a practical guide that answers questions about finding your personal Element.

VI am an engineering professor,
p5
aVand for the past 14 years
p6
aVI've been teaching crap.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVNot that I'm a bad teacher,
p9
aVbut I've been studying and teaching
p10
aVabout human waste
p11
aVand how waste is conveyed
p12
aVthrough these wastewater treatment plants,
p13
aVand how we engineer and design
p14
aVthese treatment plants so that we can protect
p15
aVsurface water like rivers.
p16
aa(lp17
VI've based my scientific career
p18
aVon using leading-edge molecular techniques,
p19
aVDNA- and RNA-based methods
p20
aVto look at microbial populations in biological reactors,
p21
aVand again to optimize these systems.
p22
aVAnd over the years,
p23
aVI have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets,
p24
aVand I've been known to sneak into toilets
p25
aVand take my camera phone
p26
aVall over the world.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut along the way, I've learned
p29
aVthat it's not just the technical side,
p30
aVbut there's also this thing called the culture of crap.
p31
aVSo for example,
p32
aVhow many of you are washers
p33
aVand how many of you are wipers?
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVIf, well, I guess you know what I mean.
p36
aVIf you're a washer, then you use water
p37
aVfor anal cleansing. That's the technical term.
p38
aVAnd if you're a wiper,
p39
aVthen you use toilet paper
p40
aVor, in some regions of the world
p41
aVwhere it's not available, newspaper
p42
aVor rags or corncobs.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd this is not just a piece of trivia,
p45
aVbut it's really important to understand
p46
aVand solve the sanitation problem.
p47
aVAnd it is a big problem:
p48
aVThere are 2.5 billion people in the world
p49
aVwho don't have access to adequate sanitation.
p50
aVFor them, there's no modern toilet.
p51
aVAnd there are 1.1 billion people
p52
aVwhose toilets are the streets
p53
aVor river banks or open spaces,
p54
aVand again, the technical term for that is
p55
aVopen defecation,
p56
aVbut that is really simply
p57
aVshitting in the open.
p58
aVAnd if you're living in fecal material
p59
aVand it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.
p60
aVIt's going to get into your drinking water,
p61
aVinto your food, into your immediate surroundings.
p62
aVSo the United Nations estimates
p63
aVthat every year, there are  1.5 million child deaths
p64
aVbecause of inadequate sanitation.
p65
aVThat's one preventable death every 20 seconds,
p66
aV171 every hour,
p67
aV4,100 every day.
p68
aVAnd so, to avoid open defecation,
p69
aVmunicipalities and cities
p70
aVbuild infrastructure, for example, like pit latrines,
p71
aVin peri-urban and rural areas.
p72
aVFor example, in KwaZulu-Natal  province in South Africa,
p73
aVthey've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines.
p74
aVBut there's a problem when you scale up
p75
aVto tens of thousands, and the problem is,
p76
aVwhat happens when the pits are full?
p77
aVThis is what happens.
p78
aVPeople defecate around the toilet.
p79
aVIn schools, children defecate on the floors
p80
aVand then leave a trail outside the building
p81
aVand start defecating around the building,
p82
aVand these pits have to be cleaned
p83
aVand manually emptied.
p84
aVAnd who does the emptying?
p85
aVYou've got these workers
p86
aVwho have to sometimes go down into the pits
p87
aVand manually remove the contents.
p88
aVIt's a dirty and dangerous business.
p89
aVAs you can see, there's no protective equipment,
p90
aVno protective clothing.
p91
aVThere's one worker down there.
p92
aVI hope you can see him.
p93
aVHe's got a face mask on, but no shirt.
p94
aVAnd in some countries, like India,
p95
aVthe lower castes are condemned
p96
aVto empty the pits,
p97
aVand they're further condemned by society.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo you ask yourself, how can we solve this
p100
aVand why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets
p101
aVfor these two and a half billion?
p102
aVAnd the answer is, it's just not possible.
p103
aVIn some of these areas, there's not enough water,
p104
aVthere's no energy,
p105
aVit's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars
p106
aVto lay out the sewer lines
p107
aVand to build the facilities
p108
aVand to operate and maintain these systems,
p109
aVand if you don't build it right,
p110
aVyou're going to have flush toilets
p111
aVthat basically go straight into the river,
p112
aVjust like what's happening in many cities
p113
aVin the developing world.
p114
aVAnd is this really the solution?
p115
aVBecause essentially, what you're doing is
p116
aVyou're using clean water
p117
aVand you're using it to flush your toilet,
p118
aVconvey it to a wastewater treatment plant
p119
aVwhich then discharges to a river,
p120
aVand that river, again, is a drinking water source.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo we've got to rethink sanitation,
p123
aVand we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure,
p124
aVand I'm going to argue that to do this,
p125
aVyou have to employ systems thinking.
p126
aVWe have to look at the whole sanitation chain.
p127
aVWe start with a human interface,
p128
aVand then we have to think about how feces
p129
aVare collected and stored,
p130
aVtransported, treated and reused \u2014
p131
aVand not just disposal but reuse.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo let's start with the human user interface.
p134
aVI say, it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper,
p135
aVa sitter or a squatter,
p136
aVthe human user interface should be clean
p137
aVand easy to use, because after all,
p138
aVtaking a dump should be pleasurable.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVAnd when we open the possibilities
p141
aVto understanding this sanitation chain,
p142
aVthen the back-end technology,
p143
aVthe collection to the reuse, should not really matter,
p144
aVand then we can apply
p145
aVlocally adoptable and context-sensitive solutions.
p146
aVSo we can open ourselves to possibilities like,
p147
aVfor example, this urine-diverting toilet,
p148
aVand there's two holes in this toilet.
p149
aVThere's the front and the back,
p150
aVand the front collects the urine,
p151
aVand the back collects the fecal material.
p152
aVAnd so what you're doing is you're separating the urine,
p153
aVwhich has 80 percent of the nitrogen
p154
aVand 50 percent of the phosphorus,
p155
aVand then that can then be treated
p156
aVand precipitated to form things like struvite,
p157
aVwhich is a high-value fertilizer,
p158
aVand then the fecal material can then be disinfected
p159
aVand again converted to high-value end products.
p160
aVOr, for example, in some of our research,
p161
aVyou can reuse the water by treating it
p162
aVin on-site sanitation systems
p163
aVlike planter boxes or constructed wetlands.
p164
aVSo we can open up all these possibilities
p165
aVif we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets
p166
aVand treatment plants.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo you might be asking, who's going to pay?
p169
aVWell, I'm going to argue that governments
p170
aVshould fund sanitation infrastructure.
p171
aVNGOs and donor organizations,
p172
aVthey can do their best, but it's not going to be enough.
p173
aVGovernments should fund sanitation
p174
aVthe same way they fund roads
p175
aVand schools and hospitals
p176
aVand other infrastructure like bridges,
p177
aVbecause we know, and the WHO has done this study,
p178
aVthat for every dollar that we invest
p179
aVin sanitation infrastructure,
p180
aVwe get something like three to 34 dollars back.
p181
aa(lp182
VLet's go back to the problem of pit emptying.
p183
aVSo at North Carolina State University,
p184
aVwe challenged our students to come up with a simple solution,
p185
aVand this is what they came up with:
p186
aVa simple, modified screw auger
p187
aVthat can move the waste up
p188
aVfrom the pit and into a collecting drum,
p189
aVand now the pit worker
p190
aVdoesn't have to go down into the pit.
p191
aVWe tested it in South Africa, and it works.
p192
aVWe need to make it more robust,
p193
aVand we're going to do more testing
p194
aVin Malawi and South Africa this coming year.
p195
aVAnd our idea is to make this
p196
aVa professionalized pit-emptying service
p197
aVso that we can create a small business out of it,
p198
aVcreate profits and jobs,
p199
aVand the hope is that,
p200
aVas we are rethinking sanitation,
p201
aVwe are extending the life of these pits
p202
aVso that we don't have to resort
p203
aVto quick solutions
p204
aVthat don't really make sense.
p205
aa(lp206
VI believe that access to adequate sanitation
p207
aVis a basic human right.
p208
aVWe need to stop the practice
p209
aVof lower castes and lower-status people
p210
aVgoing down and being condemned to empty pits.
p211
aVIt is our moral, it is our social
p212
aVand our environmental obligation.
p213
aa(lp214
VThank you.

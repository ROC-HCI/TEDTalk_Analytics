VThose of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.
p5
aVAnd in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.
p6
aVI think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud
p7
aVwhere I can just lie down with my belly down,
p8
aVlike I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.
p9
aVAnd I can basically look everywhere I want,
p10
aVsee every movie I've always wanted to see.
p11
aVAnd in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes
p12
aVin the subway in New York when you're reading,
p13
aVthere's something really soothing and easy.
p14
aa(lp15
VWell, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,
p16
aVbecause I discovered ...
p17
aVit took me a while to understand it,
p18
aVbut when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable
p19
aVwith objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.
p20
aVAnd I basically live my life in sort of a trance,
p21
aVand I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.
p22
aa(lp23
VJust to give you an example:
p24
aVthis is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.
p25
aVWe were in Queens,
p26
aVwe were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown,
p27
aVso we were in the small, small, small boondocks.
p28
aVThat was one of the funnest moments of my career.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut it's not only that.
p31
aVThe typeface \u2014 the typeface is Helvetica;
p32
aVit's its 50th anniversary this year.
p33
aVAnd so I start thinking \u2014 Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together,
p34
aVtrying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface \u2014
p35
aVand the movie starts playing in my head already.
p36
aVAnd of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces
p37
aVit was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.
p38
aVAnd I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition
p39
aVis going to have the same effect on you.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...
p42
aVyou know when they do homeworks at home?
p43
aVInstead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go
p44
aVinto the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag
p45
aVand do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces,
p48
aVand at MoMA we put out some books
p49
aVjust for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.
p50
aVAnd when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions,
p51
aVand instead it was all \u2014 almost \u2014 all good suggestions.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd a lot of nationalism came in.
p54
aVFor instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop,
p55
aVbut they were very proud
p56
aVso every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.
p57
aVAnd I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good \u2014
p58
aVthey had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd I keep it going, and I just got,
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aValso, this suggestion from Milan:
p63
aVit's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted;
p64
aVit's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan
p65
aVto define all the lanes of traffic.
p66
aVSo, think of your own,
p67
aVsend them on if you want to \u2014 they're always welcome.
p68
aa(lp69
VBut an exhibition like that made me understand even more
p70
aVwhat I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.
p71
aVI'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.
p72
aVDifferent parts of the world have a knack for different things.
p73
aVI was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay,
p74
aVand the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism
p75
aVthat you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn Italy, in Milan especially,
p78
aVcontemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.
p79
aVBut design \u2014 oh, my God.
p80
aVWhat you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store,
p81
aVis the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that
p82
aVwe are all so sophisticated.
p83
aVIt's just what you find at the store.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.
p86
aVI'm always amazed \u2014 three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is
p87
aVand take you to the galleries.
p88
aVBut design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.
p89
aVIt's really interesting:
p90
aVwhat many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of
p91
aVthis kind of overdesigned \u2014 in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but \u2014
p92
aVdecoration, interior decoration.
p93
aVThey think of somebody choosing fabrics.
p94
aa(lp95
VDesign can be that, of course, but it can also be this.
p96
aVIt can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way
p97
aVto design gas masks for people,
p98
aVbecause, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.
p99
aVSo, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline,
p100
aVso that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.
p101
aa(lp102
VThey tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler
p103
aVcan be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.
p104
aVAnd then they make a little tent for the baby.
p105
aVHowever cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design,
p106
aVand it is miles away from the fancy furniture,
p107
aVbut still, it's part of my same field of passion.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhat I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to
p110
aVharness the power of MoMA
p111
aVbecause it's great to work there. You really have power
p112
aVin that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,
p113
aVand that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.
p114
aVI'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse,
p115
aVand then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA
p118
aVin my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929,
p119
aVwhich is to try and see what's going on in the world
p120
aVand try to use that authority in order to make things better.
p121
aVThere have been many episodes,
p122
aVand actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience,
p123
aVbut in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather \u2014
p124
aVI'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly \u2014
p125
aVCharles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time
p126
aVwere involved in two competitions:
p127
aVone in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948
p128
aVwas low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war
p129
aVthat then sparked a whole line of furniture.
p130
aVAnd then there was good design for very low price.
p131
aVThere were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about
p132
aVpointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called
p135
aVMutant Materials in Contemporary Design.
p136
aVIt was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design
p137
aVin that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.
p138
aVAnd that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels
p139
aVfrom the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California;
p140
aVat that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.
p141
aVAnd at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these
p142
aVbeautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.
p143
aVSo you see, the range is really quite diverse.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd then, for instance, this other exhibition
p146
aVthat was entitled Workspheres in 2001,
p147
aVwhere I asked different designers to come up with ideas for
p148
aVthe new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.
p149
aVAnd you see IDEO there.
p150
aVIt was beautiful \u2014 it was called Personal Skies.
p151
aVThe idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top
p152
aVof your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" \u2014 a sky in a room \u2014
p153
aVit's a very famous Italian song.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go,
p156
aVand Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.
p157
aVAnd this lets me introduce a very important idea about design:
p158
aVdesigners are the biggest synthesizers in the world.
p159
aVWhat they do best is make a synthesis of human needs,
p160
aVcurrent conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,
p161
aVand then what they do at the end \u2014 if they are good \u2014
p162
aVis much more than the sum of its parts.
p163
aa(lp164
VHella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis
p165
aVthat is really quite amazing
p166
aVand also quite hilarious.
p167
aVThe idea behind her work was that
p168
aVat that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.
p169
aVInstead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."
p170
aVYeah, that's particularly gorgeous \u2014 it's the TV dinner of 2001.
p171
aa(lp172
VThere have been many other exhibitions in the meantime,
p173
aVbut I don't want to focus on my shows.
p174
aVI would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.
p175
aVI've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."
p176
aVI came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day
p177
aVI have to ask, "What does that mean?"
p178
aVSo, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that
p179
aVthere was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.
p180
aVTherefore, he was not following everybody's lead,
p181
aVand therefore, he was a maverick.
p182
aVSo, designers do need to be mavericks,
p183
aVbecause the best way to design a successful object \u2014
p184
aVand also an object that we were missing before \u2014
p185
aVis to pretend that either it never existed
p186
aVor that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA
p189
aVand it ended at the beginning of last year.
p190
aVIt was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.
p191
aVIt's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.
p192
aVAnd then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition
p193
aVuntil, slowly but surely, it came back \u2014
p194
aVas a half-full glass instead of half-empty \u2014
p195
aVand it was about protection and safety.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to
p198
aVthese kind of water-sterilizing straws,
p199
aVso it was really wide-ranging.
p200
aVIt also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together,
p201
aVand some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.
p202
aVBut what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore;
p203
aVdesign uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.
p204
aVIt's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.
p207
aVIt's a suit for civil disobedience.
p208
aVThe idea is that when you have a riot or a protest
p209
aVand the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing \u2014
p210
aVit's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart
p211
aVso your heartbeat is amplified \u2014
p212
aVand the police is reminded;
p213
aVit's like having a flower in front of the rifle.
p214
aVAnd also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit
p215
aVwill have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately
p218
aVfunctional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.
p219
aVTony Dunne and Fiona Raby
p220
aVdid this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia,
p221
aVlike this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor
p222
aVso it disappears completely and you can hide away;
p223
aVor even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article
p224
aVon the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States \u2014
p225
aVI don't think it ever happened before at MoMA;
p226
aVor this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that
p229
aVthe ultimate shelter is your sense of self,
p230
aVand there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.
p231
aVThis is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer
p232
aVthat's done this series of Capsters.
p233
aVThey are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis,
p234
aVdo whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd sometimes by doing this kind of research,
p237
aVyou encounter such beautiful ideas of design.
p238
aVTwan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with
p239
aVsome psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial
p240
aVstimulation for children that have psychological impairments.
p241
aVThey're quite beautiful.
p242
aVThey range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you \u2014
p243
aVbecause autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside \u2014
p244
aVall the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself
p245
aVin the mirror and regain a sense of self.
p246
aa(lp247
VDesign really looks upon the whole world
p248
aVand it considers the world in all of its different ranges.
p249
aVI was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.
p250
aVAnd it was really interesting because I was the last speaker
p251
aVand before me there were people that were really talking about luxury,
p252
aVand I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time
p253
aVI felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.
p254
aa(lp255
VAnd the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury,
p256
aVand there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.
p257
aVI want to make this point by showing you two examples of
p258
aVdesign coming from a sense of economy \u2014 very, very clear limits.
p259
aVThis is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell,
p260
aVand this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.
p261
aVSo they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because
p262
aVthey're so smart and economical.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo,
p265
aVFernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and
p266
aVsmartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are
p267
aVselling for an enormous amount of money.
p268
aVBut that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo really, design takes everything into account,
p271
aVand the interesting thing is that as the technology advances,
p272
aVas we become more and more wireless and impalpable,
p273
aVdesigners, instead, want us to be hands-on.
p274
aVSometimes hammer-on.
p275
aVThis is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.
p276
aVEven this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes
p277
aVyour imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects
p278
aVthat are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.
p279
aVFrom this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples
p280
aVto these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.
p281
aV(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VIt's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.
p284
aVMany years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti,
p285
aVexplain how the innovation in the military industry \u2014
p286
aVtherefore, secret innovation \u2014 and the innovation in the
p287
aVcivilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.
p288
aVAnd that makes sense.
p289
aVIn moments of war there's great technological innovation,
p290
aVand in the world you have to do without \u2014
p291
aVwell, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel,
p292
aVyou had to do without aluminum.
p293
aVAnd then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden
p294
aVavailable for the civilian market.
p295
aVMany of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair
p296
aVby Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance:
p297
aVfiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.
p298
aa(lp299
VI think that this is a strange moment.
p300
aVThe rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously,
p301
aVjust like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years,
p302
aVso I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.
p303
aVBut it surely is a very important moment for design,
p304
aVbecause not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing
p305
aVtechnology making open-source possible also in the world of design,
p306
aVbut also the idea of sustainability \u2014
p307
aVwhich is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint,
p308
aVbut also sustainability of human interrelationships \u2014
p309
aVis very much part of the work of so many designers.
p310
aVAnd that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors
p311
aVrather than on objects.
p312
aVEspecially the good ones, not all of them.
p313
aa(lp314
VI wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur,
p315
aVwhich is quite fantastic.
p316
aVHe's another young designer from France who's working \u2014
p317
aVand at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies \u2014
p318
aVon new ways to engage patients, especially children,
p319
aVin taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.
p320
aa(lp321
VFor instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine
p322
aVthat kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine,
p323
aVso the child has to go \u2014 pffff! \u2014 to release and relieve the container itself.
p324
aVAnd this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,
p325
aVso intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved
p326
aVin this particular kind of delivery.
p327
aVSimilarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve
p328
aVyou in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth
p329
aVso that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.
p330
aa(lp331
VThe next show that I'm going to work on \u2014
p332
aVand I've been bugging a lot of you about this here \u2014
p333
aVis about the relationship between design and science.
p334
aVI'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common \u2014
p335
aVthe common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations \u2014
p336
aVand I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design
p337
aVas an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.
p340
aVI've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
p341
aVBut design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales,
p342
aVand therefore, really work at the scale of the very small
p343
aVto make it very big and very meaningful.
p344
aVThank you. (Applause)

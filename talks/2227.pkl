VWe're at a tipping point in human history,
p5
aVa species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home.
p6
aa(lp7
VEven in just the past few years, we've greatly expanded
p8
aVour knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe.
p9
aVNASA's Kepler mission has discovered
p10
aVthousands of potential planets around other stars,
p11
aVindicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy.
p12
aVKepler is a space telescope
p13
aVthat measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them,
p14
aVblocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us.
p15
aVKepler's data reveals planets' sizes
p16
aVas well as their distance from their parent star.
p17
aVTogether, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky,
p18
aVlike the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System,
p19
aVand also how much light they receive from their parent sun.
p20
aVIn turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover
p21
aVmight be habitable or not.
p22
aa(lp23
VUnfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove
p24
aVof potentially habitable worlds,
p25
aVour own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.
p26
aV2014 was the hottest year on record.
p27
aVGlaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia
p28
aVare now disappearing in a matter of decades.
p29
aVThese planetary-scale environmental  changes that we have set in motion
p30
aVare rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut I'm not a climate scientist, I'm an astronomer.
p33
aVI study planetary habitability as influenced by stars
p34
aVwith the hopes of finding the places in the universe
p35
aVwhere we might discover life beyond our own planet.
p36
aVYou could say that I look for choice alien real estate.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe,
p39
aVI can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth,
p40
aVthe more you appreciate our own planet itself.
p41
aVEach one of these new worlds invites a comparison
p42
aVbetween the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best:
p43
aVthose of our own Solar System.
p44
aa(lp45
VConsider our neighbor, Mars.
p46
aVMars is small and rocky, and though it's a bit far from the Sun,
p47
aVit might be considered a potentially habitable world
p48
aVif found by a mission like Kepler.
p49
aVIndeed, it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past,
p50
aVand in part, this is why we study Mars so much.
p51
aVOur rovers, like Curiosity, crawl across its surface,
p52
aVscratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it.
p53
aVOrbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere,
p54
aVtrying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability.
p55
aVPrivate spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space
p56
aVbut the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut though these Martian vistas
p59
aVresemble the deserts of our own home world,
p60
aVplaces that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers,
p61
aVcompared to Earth
p62
aVMars is a pretty terrible place to live.
p63
aVConsider the extent to which we have not colonized
p64
aVthe deserts of our own planet,
p65
aVplaces that are lush by comparison with Mars.
p66
aVEven in the driest, highest places on Earth,
p67
aVthe air is sweet and thick with oxygen
p68
aVexhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests.
p69
aa(lp70
VI worry \u2014 I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets
p71
aVcarries with it a long, dark shadow:
p72
aVthe implication and belief by some
p73
aVthat Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction
p74
aVof the only truly habitable planet we know of, the Earth.
p75
aVAs much as I love interplanetary exploration,
p76
aVI deeply disagree with this idea.
p77
aVThere are many excellent reasons to go to Mars,
p78
aVbut for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity
p79
aVis like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party
p80
aVis happening later on the lifeboats.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aV(Applause)
p83
aa(lp84
VThank you.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation
p87
aVare not opposed to one another.
p88
aVNo, they're in fact two sides of the same goal:
p89
aVto understand, preserve and improve life into the future.
p90
aVThe extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas.
p91
aVThey're just closer to home.
p92
aVIf we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces
p93
aVout of hostile, inhospitable spaces here on Earth,
p94
aVperhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment
p95
aVand moving beyond it.
p96
aa(lp97
VI leave you with a final thought experiment:
p98
aVFermi's paradox.
p99
aVMany years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that, given the fact
p100
aVthat our universe has been around for a very long time
p101
aVand we expect that there are many planets within it,
p102
aVwe should have found evidence for alien life by now.
p103
aVSo where are they?
p104
aVWell, one possible solution to Fermi's paradox
p105
aVis that, as civilizations become technologically advanced enough
p106
aVto consider living amongst the stars,
p107
aVthey lose sight of how important it is
p108
aVto safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with.
p109
aVIt is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone
p110
aVwill save us from ourselves,
p111
aVbut planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration
p112
aVcan work together.
p113
aa(lp114
VIf we truly believe in our ability
p115
aVto bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation,
p116
aVthen we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving
p117
aVthe habitability of the Earth.
p118
aa(lp119
VThank you.
p120

Astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. She studies stellar magnetic activity and how stars influence a planet&#39;s suitability as a host for alien life. She is also an artist and works in a variety of media, from oil paint to sound. She got her taste for astronomy as an undergrad at Johns Hopkins, testing detectors for the Hubble Space Telescope&rsquo;s new camera (installed in 2002). She also learned to love the dark stellar denizens of our galaxy, the red dwarfs, which became the topic of her PhD dissertation at University of Washington. Nowadays, she works on NASA&rsquo;s Kepler mission, studying starspots and the tempestuous tantrums of stellar flares to understand stellar magnetic fields. She is particularly interested in how the high energy radiation from stars influences the habitability of planets around alien suns. Lucianne is also a leader in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, a new  project that will scan the sky every night for 10 years to create a huge cosmic movie of our Universe.</p>", "slug": "lucianne_walkowicz", "whotheyare": "Lucianne Walkowicz works on NASA\'s Kepler mission, studying starspots and \\"the tempestuous tantrums of stellar flares.\\"", "whatotherssay": "Walkowicz\'s project is also working to understand the nature of dark energy (\\"We\'re going to find things we don\'t understand\\") ...", "id": 1083, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/49e3d47d20fba9d0f4dd4253a189ae0bc5e9348a_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Let\'s not use Mars as a backup planet", "take_action": null, "comments": 26847, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/5ff382a9ad5bd01b1ec2e8e9856b3eac24f37f45_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Stellar astronomer and TED Senior Fellow Lucianne Walkowicz works on NASA\'s Kepler mission, searching for places in the universe that could support life.

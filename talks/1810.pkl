VWhat I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects,
p5
aVand that is the neuroscience of sleep.
p6
aa(lp7
VNow, there is a sound \u2014
p8
aa(lp9
V(Alarm clock)
p10
aa(lp11
VAh, it worked!
p12
aVA sound that is desperately familiar to most of us,
p13
aVand of course it's the sound of the alarm clock.
p14
aVAnd what that truly ghastly, awful sound does
p15
aVis stop the single most important behavioral experience
p16
aVthat we have, and that's sleep.
p17
aVIf you're an average sort of person,
p18
aV36 percent of your life will be spent asleep,
p19
aVwhich means that if you live to 90,
p20
aVthen 32 years will have been spent entirely asleep.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow what that 32 years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important.
p23
aVAnd yet, for most of us, we don't give sleep a second thought.
p24
aVWe throw it away.
p25
aVWe really just don't think about sleep.
p26
aVAnd so what I'd like to do today is change your views,
p27
aVchange your ideas and your thoughts about sleep.
p28
aVAnd the journey that I want to take you on,
p29
aVwe need to start by going back in time.
p30
aa(lp31
V"Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber."
p32
aVAny ideas who said that?
p33
aVShakespeare's Julius Caesar.
p34
aVYes, let me give you a few more quotes.
p35
aV"O sleep, O gentle sleep, nature's soft nurse,
p36
aVhow have I frighted thee?"
p37
aVShakespeare again, from \u2014 I won't say it \u2014
p38
aVthe Scottish play.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VFrom the same time:
p43
aV"Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together."
p44
aVExtremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker, another Elizabethan dramatist.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut if we jump forward 400 years,
p47
aVthe tone about sleep changes somewhat.
p48
aVThis is from Thomas Edison, from the beginning of the 20th century:
p49
aV"Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days."
p50
aVBang!
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd if we also jump into the 1980s, some of you may remember
p55
aVthat Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said,
p56
aV"Sleep is for wimps."
p57
aVAnd of course the infamous \u2014 what was his name? \u2014
p58
aVthe infamous Gordon Gekko from "Wall Street" said,
p59
aV"Money never sleeps."
p60
aa(lp61
VWhat do we do in the 20th century about sleep?
p62
aVWell, of course, we use Thomas Edison's light bulb
p63
aVto invade the night, and we occupied the dark,
p64
aVand in the process of this occupation,
p65
aVwe've treated sleep as an illness, almost.
p66
aVWe've treated it as an enemy.
p67
aVAt most now, I suppose, we tolerate the need for sleep,
p68
aVand at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep
p69
aVas an illness that needs some sort of a cure.
p70
aVAnd our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound.
p71
aVWhy is it? Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts?
p72
aVWell, it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep, it seems.
p73
aVYou don't eat. You don't drink.
p74
aVAnd you don't have sex.
p75
aVWell, most of us anyway.
p76
aVAnd so, therefore it's \u2014
p77
aVSorry.
p78
aVIt's a complete waste of time, right?
p79
aVWrong.
p80
aVActually, sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology,
p81
aVand neuroscientists are beginning to explain
p82
aVwhy it's so very important.
p83
aVSo let's move to the brain.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, here we have a brain.
p86
aVThis is donated by a social scientist,
p87
aVand they said they didn't know what it was or indeed, how to use it, so \u2014
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VSorry.
p92
aVSo I borrowed it.
p93
aVI don't think they noticed. OK.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VThe point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep,
p98
aVthis thing doesn't shut down.
p99
aVIn fact, some areas of the brain are actually more active
p100
aVduring the sleep state than during the wake state.
p101
aVThe other thing that's really important about sleep
p102
aVis that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain,
p103
aVbut is to some extent a network property.
p104
aVIf we flip the brain on its back \u2014
p105
aVI love this little bit of spinal cord here \u2014
p106
aVthis bit here is the hypothalamus,
p107
aVand right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures,
p108
aVnot least the biological clock.
p109
aVThe biological clock tells us when it's good to be up,
p110
aVwhen it's good to be asleep,
p111
aVand what that structure does is interact
p112
aVwith a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus,
p113
aVthe lateral hypothalamus, the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei.
p114
aVAll of those combine,
p115
aVand they send projections down to the brain stem here.
p116
aVThe brain stem then projects forward
p117
aVand bathes the cortex, this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here,
p118
aVwith neurotransmitters that keep us awake
p119
aVand essentially provide us with our consciousness.
p120
aVSo sleep arises from a whole raft
p121
aVof different interactions within the brain,
p122
aVand essentially, sleep is turned on and off
p123
aVas a result of a range of interactions in here.
p124
aa(lp125
VOK. So where have we got to?
p126
aVWe've said that sleep is complicated
p127
aVand it takes 32 years of our life.
p128
aVBut what I haven't explained is what sleep is about.
p129
aVSo why do we sleep?
p130
aVAnd it won't surprise any of you that, of course,
p131
aVas scientists, we don't have a consensus.
p132
aVThere are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep,
p133
aVand I'm going to outline three of those.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe first is sort of the restoration idea,
p136
aVand it's somewhat intuitive.
p137
aVEssentially, all the stuff we've burned up during the day,
p138
aVwe restore, we replace, we rebuild during the night.
p139
aVAnd indeed, as an explanation, it goes back to Aristotle,
p140
aVso that's what \u2014 2,300 years ago.
p141
aVIt's gone in and out of fashion.
p142
aVIt's fashionable at the moment
p143
aVbecause what's been shown is that within the brain,
p144
aVa whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep,
p145
aVand those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways.
p146
aVSo there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhat about energy conservation?
p149
aVAgain, perhaps intuitive.
p150
aVYou essentially sleep to save calories.
p151
aVNow, when you do the sums, though, it doesn't really pan out.
p152
aVIf you compare an individual who has slept at night,
p153
aVor stayed awake and hasn't moved very much,
p154
aVthe energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night.
p155
aVNow, that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun.
p156
aVNow, I would say that a hot dog bun
p157
aVis kind of a meager return
p158
aVfor such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep.
p159
aVSo I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut the third idea I'm quite attracted to,
p162
aVwhich is brain processing and memory consolidation.
p163
aVWhat we know is that, if after you've tried to learn a task,
p164
aVand you sleep-deprive individuals,
p165
aVthe ability to learn that task is smashed.
p166
aVIt's really hugely attenuated.
p167
aVSo sleep and memory consolidation is also very important.
p168
aVHowever, it's not just the laying down of memory
p169
aVand recalling it.
p170
aVWhat's turned out to be really exciting
p171
aVis that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems
p172
aVis hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.
p173
aVIn fact, it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage.
p174
aVSleeping at night enhances our creativity.
p175
aVAnd what seems to be going on is that, in the brain,
p176
aVthose neural connections that are important,
p177
aVthose synaptic connections that are important,
p178
aVare linked and strengthened,
p179
aVwhile those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important.
p180
aa(lp181
VOK.
p182
aVSo we've had three explanations for why we might sleep,
p183
aVand I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary,
p184
aVand it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons.
p185
aVBut sleep is not an indulgence.
p186
aVIt's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually.
p187
aVI think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade
p188
aVfrom economy to business class, you know, the equivalent of.
p189
aVIt's not even an upgrade from economy to first class.
p190
aVThe critical thing to realize is that if you don't sleep,
p191
aVyou don't fly.
p192
aVEssentially, you never get there.
p193
aVAnd what's extraordinary about much of our society these days
p194
aVis that we are desperately sleep-deprived.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo let's now look at sleep deprivation.
p197
aVHuge sectors of society are sleep-deprived,
p198
aVand let's look at our sleep-o-meter.
p199
aVSo in the 1950s, good data suggests that most of us
p200
aVwere getting around eight hours of sleep a night.
p201
aVNowadays, we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night,
p202
aVso we're in the six-and-a-half-hours every-night league.
p203
aVFor teenagers, it's worse, much worse.
p204
aVThey need nine hours for full brain performance,
p205
aVand many of them, on a school night, are only getting five hours of sleep.
p206
aVIt's simply not enough.
p207
aVIf we think about other sectors of society \u2014 the aged;
p208
aVif you are aged, then your ability to sleep in a single block
p209
aVis somewhat disrupted, and many sleep, again,
p210
aVless than five hours a night.
p211
aa(lp212
VShift work.
p213
aVShift work is extraordinary,
p214
aVperhaps 20 percent of the working population,
p215
aVand the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night.
p216
aVIt's locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us.
p217
aVSo when the poor old shift worker is going home
p218
aVto try and sleep during the day, desperately tired,
p219
aVthe body clock is saying, "Wake up. This is the time to be awake."
p220
aVSo the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker
p221
aVis usually very poor, again in that sort of five-hour region.
p222
aVAnd then, of course, tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag.
p223
aVSo who here has jet lag?
p224
aVWell, my goodness gracious.
p225
aVWell, thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep,
p226
aVbecause that's what your brain is craving.
p227
aa(lp228
VOne of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro-sleeps,
p229
aVthis involuntary falling asleep,
p230
aVand you have essentially no control over it.
p231
aVNow, micro-sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing,
p232
aVbut they can also be deadly.
p233
aVIt's been estimated that 31 percent of drivers
p234
aVwill fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life,
p235
aVand in the US, the statistics are pretty good:
p236
aV100,000 accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness,
p237
aVloss of vigilance, and falling asleep \u2014 a hundred thousand a year.
p238
aVIt's extraordinary.
p239
aVAt another level of terror,
p240
aVwe dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl
p241
aVand indeed the space shuttle Challenger,
p242
aVwhich was so tragically lost.
p243
aVAnd in the investigations that followed those disasters,
p244
aVpoor judgment as a result of extended shift work
p245
aVand loss of vigilance and tiredness
p246
aVwas attributed to a big chunk of those disasters.
p247
aVWhen you're tired and you lack sleep,
p248
aVyou have poor memory, you have poor creativity,
p249
aVyou have increased impulsiveness,
p250
aVand you have overall poor judgment.
p251
aVBut my friends, it's so much worse than that.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VIf you are a tired brain,
p256
aVthe brain is craving things to wake it up.
p257
aVSo drugs, stimulants.
p258
aVCaffeine represents the stimulant of choice
p259
aVacross much of the Western world.
p260
aVMuch of the day is fueled by caffeine,
p261
aVand if you're a really naughty tired brain, nicotine.
p262
aVOf course, you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants,
p263
aVand then, of course, it gets to 11 o'clock at night,
p264
aVand the brain says to itself,
p265
aV"Actually, I need to be asleep fairly shortly.
p266
aVWhat do we do about that when I'm feeling completely wired?"
p267
aVWell, of course, you then resort to alcohol.
p268
aVNow alcohol, short-term, you know, once or twice,
p269
aVto use to mildly sedate you, can be very useful.
p270
aVIt can actually ease the sleep transition.
p271
aVBut what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep.
p272
aVA biological mimic for sleep,
p273
aVit sedates you.
p274
aVSo it actually harms some of the neural processing
p275
aVthat's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall.
p276
aVSo it's a short-term acute measure,
p277
aVbut for goodness sake,
p278
aVdon't become addicted to alcohol
p279
aVas a way of getting to sleep every night.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnother connection between loss of sleep is weight gain.
p282
aVIf you sleep around about five hours or less every night,
p283
aVthen you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese.
p284
aVWhat's the connection here?
p285
aVWell, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin,
p286
aVthe hunger hormone.
p287
aVGhrelin is released.
p288
aVIt gets to the brain.
p289
aVThe brain says, "I need carbohydrates,"
p290
aVand what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars.
p291
aVSo there's a link between tiredness
p292
aVand the metabolic predisposition for weight gain: stress.
p293
aVTired people are massively stressed.
p294
aVAnd one of the things of stress, of course, is loss of memory,
p295
aVwhich is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of.
p296
aVBut stress is so much more.
p297
aVSo, if you're acutely stressed, not a great problem,
p298
aVbut it's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that's the problem.
p299
aVSustained stress leads to suppressed immunity.
p300
aVAnd so, tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection,
p301
aVand there's some very good studies
p302
aVshowing that shift workers, for example, have higher rates of cancer.
p303
aVIncreased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation.
p304
aVGlucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature
p305
aVand essentially you become glucose intolerant.
p306
aVTherefore, diabetes 2.
p307
aVStress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure.
p308
aVSo there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss
p309
aVthat are more than just a mildly impaired brain,
p310
aVwhich is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo at this point in the talk, this is a nice time to think,
p313
aV"Well, do you think on the whole I'm getting enough sleep?"
p314
aVSo a quick show of hands.
p315
aVWho feels that they're getting enough sleep here?
p316
aVOh. Well, that's pretty impressive.
p317
aVGood. We'll talk more about that later, about what are your tips.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo most of us, of course, ask the question,
p320
aV"How do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep?"
p321
aVWell, it's not rocket science.
p322
aVIf you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning,
p323
aVif you are taking a long time to get up,
p324
aVif you need lots of stimulants,
p325
aVif you're grumpy, if you're irritable,
p326
aVif you're told by your work colleagues that you're looking tired and irritable,
p327
aVchances are you are sleep-deprived.
p328
aVListen to them. Listen to yourself.
p329
aa(lp330
VWhat do you do?
p331
aVWell \u2014 and this is slightly offensive \u2014
p332
aVsleep for dummies.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VMake your bedroom a haven for sleep.
p337
aVThe first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can,
p338
aVand also make it slightly cool.
p339
aVVery important.
p340
aVActually, reduce your amount of light exposure
p341
aVat least half an hour before you go to bed.
p342
aVLight increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep.
p343
aVWhat's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed?
p344
aVWe stand in a massively lit bathroom,
p345
aVlooking into the mirror cleaning our teeth.
p346
aVIt's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep.
p347
aVTurn off those mobile phones. Turn off those computers.
p348
aVTurn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain.
p349
aVTry not to drink caffeine too late in the day,
p350
aVideally not after lunch.
p351
aa(lp352
VNow, we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed,
p353
aVbut light exposure in the morning
p354
aVis very good at setting the biological clock to the light-dark cycle.
p355
aVSo seek out morning light.
p356
aVBasically, listen to yourself.
p357
aVWind down.
p358
aVDo those sorts of things
p359
aVthat you know are going to ease you off
p360
aVinto the honey-heavy dew of slumber.
p361
aa(lp362
VOK.
p363
aVThat's some facts. What about some myths?
p364
aa(lp365
VTeenagers are lazy.
p366
aVNo. Poor things.
p367
aVThey have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late,
p368
aVso give them a break.
p369
aa(lp370
VWe need eight hours of sleep a night.
p371
aVThat's an average.
p372
aVSome people need more. Some people need less.
p373
aVAnd what you need to do is listen to your body.
p374
aVDo you need that much or do you need more?
p375
aVSimple as that.
p376
aa(lp377
VOld people need less sleep.
p378
aVNot true.
p379
aVThe sleep demands of the aged do not go down.
p380
aVEssentially, sleep fragments and becomes less robust,
p381
aVbut sleep requirements do not go down.
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd the fourth myth is early to bed, early to rise
p384
aVmakes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
p385
aVWell, that's wrong at so many different levels.
p386
aa(lp387
V(Laughter)
p388
aa(lp389
VThere is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early
p390
aVgives you more wealth at all.
p391
aVThere's no difference in socioeconomic status.
p392
aVIn my experience,
p393
aVthe only difference between morning people and evening people
p394
aVis that those people that get up in the morning early
p395
aVare just horribly smug.
p396
aa(lp397
V(Laughter)
p398
aa(lp399
V(Applause)
p400
aa(lp401
VOK.
p402
aVSo for the last few minutes,
p403
aVwhat I want to do is change gears
p404
aVand talk about some really new, breaking areas of neuroscience,
p405
aVwhich is the association between mental health,
p406
aVmental illness and sleep disruption.
p407
aVWe've known for 130 years that in severe mental illness,
p408
aVthere is always, always sleep disruption,
p409
aVbut it's been largely ignored.
p410
aVIn the 1970s, when people started to think about this again,
p411
aVthey said, "Yes, well, of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia,
p412
aVbecause they're on antipsychotics.
p413
aVIt's the antipsychotics causing the sleep problems,"
p414
aVignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously,
p415
aVsleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo what's going on?
p418
aVSeveral groups are studying
p419
aVconditions like depression, schizophrenia and bipolar
p420
aVand what's going on in terms of sleep disruption.
p421
aVWe have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia,
p422
aVand the data were quite extraordinary.
p423
aVIn those individuals with schizophrenia,
p424
aVmuch of the time, they were awake during the night phase
p425
aVand then they were asleep during the day.
p426
aVOther groups showed no 24-hour patterns whatsoever \u2014
p427
aVtheir sleep was absolutely smashed.
p428
aVAnd some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light-dark cycle.
p429
aVThey were getting up later and later and later and later each night.
p430
aVIt was smashed.
p431
aa(lp432
VSo what's going on?
p433
aVAnd the really exciting news
p434
aVis that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated,
p435
aVbut they are physically linked within the brain.
p436
aVThe neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep,
p437
aVgive you normal sleep,
p438
aVand those that give you normal mental health, are overlapping.
p439
aVAnd what's the evidence for that?
p440
aVWell, genes that have been shown
p441
aVto be very important in the generation of normal sleep,
p442
aVwhen mutated, when changed,
p443
aValso predispose individuals to mental health problems.
p444
aVAnd last year, we published a study
p445
aVwhich showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia,
p446
aVwhen mutated, also smashes the sleep.
p447
aVSo we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap
p448
aVbetween these two important systems.
p449
aa(lp450
VOther work flowed from these studies.
p451
aVThe first was that sleep disruption
p452
aVactually precedes certain types of mental illness,
p453
aVand we've shown that in those young individuals
p454
aVwho are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder,
p455
aVthey already have a sleep abnormality
p456
aVprior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar.
p457
aVThe other bit of data was that sleep disruption
p458
aVmay actually exacerbate, make worse, the mental illness state.
p459
aVMy colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents
p460
aVwhich have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia
p461
aVin those individuals by 50 percent.
p462
aa(lp463
VSo what have we got?
p464
aVWe've got, in these connections, some really exciting things.
p465
aVIn terms of the neuroscience,
p466
aVby understanding these two systems,
p467
aVwe're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness
p468
aVare generated and regulated within the brain.
p469
aVThe second area is that if we can use sleep
p470
aVand sleep disruption as an early warning signal,
p471
aVthen we have the chance of going in.
p472
aVIf we know these individuals are vulnerable,
p473
aVearly intervention then becomes possible.
p474
aVAnd the third, which I think is the most exciting,
p475
aVis that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain
p476
aVas a new therapeutic target.
p477
aVStabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable,
p478
aVwe can certainly make them healthier,
p479
aVbut also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness.
p480
aa(lp481
VSo let me just finish.
p482
aVWhat I started by saying is: Take sleep seriously.
p483
aVOur attitudes toward sleep are so very different
p484
aVfrom a pre-industrial age,
p485
aVwhen we were almost wrapped in a duvet.
p486
aVWe used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep.
p487
aVAnd this isn't some sort of crystal-waving nonsense.
p488
aVThis is a pragmatic response to good health.
p489
aVIf you have good sleep, it increases your concentration,
p490
aVattention, decision-making, creativity, social skills, health.
p491
aVIf you get sleep, it reduces your mood changes, your stress,
p492
aVyour levels of anger, your impulsivity,
p493
aVand your tendency to drink and take drugs.
p494
aVAnd we finished by saying
p495
aVthat an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep
p496
aVis really informing the way we think
p497
aVabout some of the causes of mental illness,
p498
aVand indeed is providing us new ways
p499
aVto treat these incredibly debilitating conditions.
p500
aa(lp501
VJim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said,
p502
aV"Sleep is God. Go worship."
p503
aVAnd I can only recommend that you do the same.
p504
aa(lp505
VThank you for your attention.

The more we learn about how our eyes and bodies create our sleep cycles, the more seriously we can begin to take sleep as a therapy.</p>", "slug": "russell_foster", "whotheyare": "Russell Foster studies sleep and its role in our lives, examining how our perception of light influences our sleep-wake rhythms.", "whatotherssay": "Even in animals and people in whom the rods and cones used for vision have been completely destroyed and who are otherwise totally visually blind, the pRGCs can still detect light to shift the circadian clock.", "id": 1623, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/5c79fa81c2e442be97389985794af68f8d25a404_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Why do we sleep?", "take_action": [], "comments": 21836, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "What\\u2019s the connection between sleep and mental health?", "link_url": "http://blog.ted.com/2013/08/14/the-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health-a-qa-with-circadian-neuroscientist-russell-foster/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "", "type": "from_the_blog", "blurb": "Science writer Brooke Borel explores Russell Foster\'s research in an exclusive Q&A with the circadian neuroscientist."}, {"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "Oxford Online Programme in Sleep Medicine ", "link_url": "https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/study/continuing-professional-development/the-oxford-online-programme-in-sleep-medicine", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "ndcn.ox.ac.uk", "type": "external_website", "blurb": "Learn more about the online programme, led by Russell Foster, which brings together world-leading expertise in basic and human sleep and circadian research in the evaluation and management of sleep disorders."}], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/44c8a0d9e5982eab342c4151d702004b491e48e7_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Russell Foster is a circadian neuroscientist: He studies the sleep cycles of the brain.

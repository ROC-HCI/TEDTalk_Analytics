VI have been teaching for a long time,
p5
aVand in doing so
p6
aVhave acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning
p7
aVthat I really wish more people would understand
p8
aVabout the potential of students.
p9
aVIn 1931, my grandmother \u2014
p10
aVbottom left for you guys over here \u2014
p11
aVgraduated from the eighth grade.
p12
aVShe went to school to get the information
p13
aVbecause that's where the information lived.
p14
aVIt was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;
p15
aVand she needed to go there to get the information,
p16
aVbecause that's how you learned.
p17
aVFast-forward a generation:
p18
aVthis is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,
p19
aVwhere my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.
p20
aVAnd he again had to travel to the school
p21
aVto get the information from the teacher,
p22
aVstored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,
p23
aVand take it with him,
p24
aVbecause that is how information was being transported
p25
aVfrom teacher to student and then used in the world.
p26
aVWhen I was a kid,
p27
aVwe had a set of encyclopedias at my house.
p28
aVIt was purchased the year I was born,
p29
aVand it was extraordinary,
p30
aVbecause I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
p31
aVThe information was inside my house
p32
aVand it was awesome.
p33
aVThis was different
p34
aVthan either generation had experienced before,
p35
aVand it changed the way I interacted with information
p36
aVeven at just a small level.
p37
aVBut the information was closer to me.
p38
aVI could get access to it.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn the time that passes
p41
aVbetween when I was a kid in high school
p42
aVand when I started teaching,
p43
aVwe really see the advent of the Internet.
p44
aVRight about the time that the Internet gets going
p45
aVas an educational tool,
p46
aVI take off from Wisconsin
p47
aVand move to Kansas, small town Kansas,
p48
aVwhere I had an opportunity to teach
p49
aVin a lovely, small-town,
p50
aVrural Kansas school district,
p51
aVwhere I was teaching my favorite subject,
p52
aVAmerican government.
p53
aVMy first year \u2014 super gung-ho \u2014 going to teach American government,
p54
aVloved the political system.
p55
aVKids in the 12th grade:
p56
aVnot exactly all that enthusiastic
p57
aVabout the American government system.
p58
aVYear two: learned a few things \u2014 had to change my tactic.
p59
aVAnd I put in front of them an authentic experience
p60
aVthat allowed them to learn for themselves.
p61
aVI didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.
p62
aVI posed a problem in front of them,
p63
aVwhich was to put on an election forum for their own community.
p64
aa(lp65
VThey produced flyers. They called offices.
p66
aVThey checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.
p67
aVThey produced an election forum booklet
p68
aVfor the entire town to learn more about their candidates.
p69
aVThey invited everyone into the school
p70
aVfor an evening of conversation
p71
aVabout government and politics
p72
aVand whether or not the streets were done well,
p73
aVand really had this robust experiential learning.
p74
aVThe older teachers \u2014 more experienced \u2014
p75
aVlooked at me and went,
p76
aV"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aV"She doesn't know what she's in for."
p79
aVBut I knew that the kids would show up,
p80
aVand I believed it,
p81
aVand I told them every week what I expected out of them.
p82
aVAnd that night, all 90 kids \u2014
p83
aVdressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.
p84
aVI had to just sit and watch.
p85
aVIt was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.
p86
aVIt meant something to them.
p87
aVAnd they will step up.
p88
aa(lp89
VFrom Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,
p90
aVwhere I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,
p91
aVthis time with middle school students.
p92
aVLuckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.
p93
aVCould teach them the more exciting topic of geography.
p94
aVAgain, "thrilled" to learn.
p95
aVBut what was interesting
p96
aVabout this position I found myself in in Arizona,
p97
aVwas I had this really
p98
aVextraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with
p99
aVin a truly public school,
p100
aVand we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
p101
aVAnd one opportunity
p102
aVwas we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,
p103
aVwhich is the gentleman
p104
aVthat the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
p105
aVAnd he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.
p106
aVWe could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
p107
aVThere was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.
p108
aa(lp109
VThe problem then becomes
p110
aVhow do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide
p111
aVand deal with the subject in a way
p112
aVthat is responsible and respectful,
p113
aVand they know what to do with it.
p114
aVAnd so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina
p115
aVas an example of a gentleman
p116
aVwho singularly used his life to do something positive.
p117
aVI then challenged the kids to identify
p118
aVsomeone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,
p119
aVthat they could identify that had done a similar thing.
p120
aVI asked them to produce a little movie about it.
p121
aVIt's the first time we'd done this.
p122
aVNobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,
p123
aVbut they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
p124
aVIt was the most awesome moment of revelation
p125
aVthat when you ask kids to use their own voice
p126
aVand ask them to speak for themselves,
p127
aVwhat they're willing to share.
p128
aVThe last question of the assignment is:
p129
aVhow do you plan to use your life
p130
aVto positively impact other people?
p131
aVThe things that kids will say
p132
aVwhen you ask them and take the time to listen
p133
aVis extraordinary.
p134
aa(lp135
VFast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.
p136
aVI teach at the Science Leadership Academy,
p137
aVwhich is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute
p138
aVand the school district of Philadelphia.
p139
aVWe are a nine through 12 public school,
p140
aVbut we do school quite differently.
p141
aVI moved there primarily
p142
aVto be part of a learning environment
p143
aVthat validated the way that I knew that kids learned,
p144
aVand that really wanted to investigate
p145
aVwhat was possible
p146
aVwhen you are willing to let go
p147
aVof some of the paradigms of the past,
p148
aVof information scarcity when my grandmother was in school
p149
aVand when my father was in school and even when I was in school,
p150
aVand to a moment when we have information surplus.
p151
aVSo what do you do when the information is all around you?
p152
aVWhy do you have kids come to school
p153
aVif they no longer have to come there to get the information?
p154
aa(lp155
VIn Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,
p156
aVso the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,
p157
aVtaking them home, getting access to information.
p158
aVAnd here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with
p159
aVwhen you've given the tool
p160
aVto acquire information to students,
p161
aVis that you have to be comfortable with this idea
p162
aVof allowing kids to fail
p163
aVas part of the learning process.
p164
aVWe deal right now in the educational landscape
p165
aVwith an infatuation
p166
aVwith the culture of one right answer
p167
aVthat can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,
p168
aVand I am here to share with you:
p169
aVit is not learning.
p170
aVThat is the absolute wrong thing to ask,
p171
aVto tell kids to never be wrong.
p172
aVTo ask them to always have the right answer
p173
aVdoesn't allow them to learn.
p174
aVSo we did this project,
p175
aVand this is one of the artifacts of the project.
p176
aVI almost never show them off
p177
aVbecause of the issue of the idea of failure.
p178
aa(lp179
VMy students produced these info-graphics
p180
aVas a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year
p181
aVresponding to the oil spill.
p182
aVI asked them to take the examples that we were seeing
p183
aVof the info-graphics that existed
p184
aVin a lot of mass media,
p185
aVand take a look at what were the interesting components of it,
p186
aVand produce one for themselves
p187
aVof a different man-made disaster from American history.
p188
aVAnd they had certain criteria to do it.
p189
aVThey were a little uncomfortable with it,
p190
aVbecause we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.
p191
aVThey can talk \u2014 they're very smooth,
p192
aVand they can write very, very well,
p193
aVbut asking them to communicate ideas in a different way
p194
aVwas a little uncomfortable for them.
p195
aVBut I gave them the room to just do the thing.
p196
aVGo create. Go figure it out.
p197
aVLet's see what we can do.
p198
aVAnd the student that persistently
p199
aVturns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
p200
aVThis was done in like two or three days.
p201
aVAnd this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"
p204
aVAnd they immediately went, "There it is."
p205
aVDidn't read anything. "There it is."
p206
aVAnd I said, "Well what makes it great?"
p207
aVAnd they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.
p208
aVAnd there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.
p209
aVAnd I said, "Go read it."
p210
aVAnd they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
p211
aVAnd then we went to another one \u2014
p212
aVit didn't have great visuals, but it had great information \u2014
p213
aVand spent an hour talking about the learning process,
p214
aVbecause it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,
p215
aVor whether or not it was what I could create.
p216
aVIt asked them to create for themselves,
p217
aVand it allowed them to fail,
p218
aVprocess, learn from.
p219
aVAnd when we do another round of this in my class this year,
p220
aVthey will do better this time,
p221
aVbecause learning
p222
aVhas to include an amount of failure,
p223
aVbecause failure is instructional
p224
aVin the process.
p225
aa(lp226
VThere are a million pictures
p227
aVthat I could click through here,
p228
aVand had to choose carefully \u2014 this is one of my favorites \u2014
p229
aVof students learning,
p230
aVof what learning can look like
p231
aVin a landscape where we let go of the idea
p232
aVthat kids have to come to school to get the information,
p233
aVbut instead, ask them what they can do with it.
p234
aVAsk them really interesting questions.
p235
aVThey will not disappoint.
p236
aVAsk them to go to places,
p237
aVto see things for themselves,
p238
aVto actually experience the learning,
p239
aVto play, to inquire.
p240
aVThis is one of my favorite photos,
p241
aVbecause this was taken on Tuesday,
p242
aVwhen I asked the students to go to the polls.
p243
aVThis is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,
p244
aVand he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.
p245
aVBut this is learning too,
p246
aVbecause we asked them to go out into real spaces.
p247
aa(lp248
VThe main point
p249
aVis that, if we continue to look at education
p250
aVas if it's about coming to school
p251
aVto get the information
p252
aVand not about experiential learning,
p253
aVempowering student voice and embracing failure,
p254
aVwe're missing the mark.
p255
aVAnd everything that everybody is talking about today
p256
aVisn't possible if we keep having an educational system
p257
aVthat does not value these qualities,
p258
aVbecause we won't get there with a standardized test,
p259
aVand we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.
p260
aVWe know how to do this better,
p261
aVand it's time to do better.

VAbout 75 years ago,
p5
aVmy grandfather, a young man,
p6
aVwalked into a tent
p7
aVthat was converted into a
p8
aVmovie theater like that,
p9
aVand he fell hopelessly in love
p10
aVwith the woman he saw on the
p11
aVsilver screen: none other than Mae West,
p12
aVthe heartthrob of the '30s,
p13
aVand he could never forget her.
p14
aVIn fact, when he had his daughter
p15
aVmany years later, he wanted to
p16
aVname her after Mae West,
p17
aVbut can you imagine an Indian
p18
aVchild name Mae West?
p19
aVThe Indian family said, no way!
p20
aa(lp21
VSo when my twin brother Kaesava
p22
aVwas born, he decided to tinker
p23
aVwith the spelling of Keshava's name.
p24
aVHe said, if Mae West can be M-A-E,
p25
aVwhy can't Keshava be K-A-E?
p26
aVSo he changed Kaesava's spelling.
p27
aVNow Kaesava had a baby boy
p28
aVcalled Rehan a couple of weeks ago.
p29
aVHe decided to spell, or, rather,
p30
aVmisspell Raehan with an A-E.
p31
aa(lp32
VYou know, my grandfather died
p33
aVmany years ago when I was
p34
aVlittle, but his love for Mae
p35
aVWest lives on as a misspelling
p36
aVin the DNA of his progeny.
p37
aVThat for me is successful legacy. (Laughs)
p38
aa(lp39
VYou know, as for me,
p40
aVmy wife and I have our own
p41
aVcrazy legacy project.
p42
aVWe actually sit every few years,
p43
aVargue, disagree, fight,
p44
aVand actually come up with our
p45
aVvery own 200-year plan.
p46
aa(lp47
VOur friends think we're mad.
p48
aVOur parents think we're cuckoo.
p49
aVBecause, you know, we both
p50
aVcome from families that really
p51
aVlook up to humility and wisdom,
p52
aVbut we both like to live
p53
aVlarger than life.
p54
aVI believe in the concept of
p55
aVa Raja Yogi: Be a dude before
p56
aVyou can become an ascetic.
p57
aVThis is me being a rock star,
p58
aVeven if it's in my own house.
p59
aVYou know?
p60
aa(lp61
VSo when Netra and I sat down
p62
aVto make our first plan
p63
aV10 years ago, we said
p64
aVwe want the focus of this plan
p65
aVto go way beyond ourselves.
p66
aVWhat do we mean by beyond ourselves?
p67
aa(lp68
VWell 200 years, we calculated,
p69
aVis at the end of our direct
p70
aVcontact with the world.
p71
aVThere's nobody I'll meet in
p72
aVmy life will ever live beyond
p73
aV200 years, so we thought
p74
aVthat's a perfect place where
p75
aVwe should situate our plan and
p76
aVlet our imagination take flight.
p77
aa(lp78
VYou know, I never really
p79
aVbelieved in legacy. What am I
p80
aVgoing to leave behind? I'm an artist.
p81
aVUntil I made a cartoon about 9/11.
p82
aVIt caused so much trouble for me.
p83
aVI was so upset.
p84
aVYou know, a cartoon that was
p85
aVmeant to be a cartoon of the week
p86
aVended up staying so much longer.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow I'm in the business of
p89
aVcreating art that will
p90
aVdefinitely even outlive me, and
p91
aVI think about what I want to
p92
aVleave behind through those paintings.
p93
aa(lp94
VYou know, the 9/11 cartoon
p95
aVupset me so much that I decided
p96
aVI'll never cartoon again.
p97
aVI said, I'm never going to make any
p98
aVhonest public commentary again.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut of course I continued
p101
aVcreating artwork that was honest
p102
aVand raw, because I forgot about
p103
aVhow people reacted to my work.
p104
aa(lp105
VYou know, sometimes forgetting
p106
aVis so important to remain idealistic.
p107
aVPerhaps loss of memory is so
p108
aVcrucial for our survival
p109
aVas human beings.
p110
aa(lp111
VOne of the most important things
p112
aVin my 200-year plan that Netra
p113
aVand I write is what to forget
p114
aVabout ourselves.
p115
aVYou know, we carry so much
p116
aVbaggage, from our parents,
p117
aVfrom our society, from so many
p118
aVpeople \u2014 fears, insecurities \u2014 and
p119
aVour 200-year plan really lists
p120
aVall our childhood problems that we have to expire.
p121
aVWe actually put an expiry date
p122
aVon all our childhood problems.
p123
aVThe latest date I put was,
p124
aVI said, I am going to expire
p125
aVmy fear of my leftist, feminist
p126
aVmother-in-law, and this
p127
aVtoday is the date! (Laughs)
p128
aVShe's watching. (Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VAnyway, you know, I really
p131
aVmake decisions all the time
p132
aVabout how I want to remember
p133
aVmyself, and that's the most important
p134
aVkind of decisions I make.
p135
aVAnd this directly translates
p136
aVinto my paintings.
p137
aVBut like my friends, I can do
p138
aVthat really well on Facebook,
p139
aVPinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube.
p140
aVName it, I'm on it.
p141
aVI've started outsourcing my
p142
aVmemory to the digital world,
p143
aVyou know? But that comes
p144
aVwith a problem.
p145
aVIt's so easy to think of
p146
aVtechnology as a metaphor
p147
aVfor memory, but our brains
p148
aVare not perfect storage devices
p149
aVlike technology.
p150
aVWe only remember what we
p151
aVwant to. At least I do.
p152
aVAnd I rather think of our brains
p153
aVas biased curators of our
p154
aVmemory, you know? And if
p155
aVtechnology is not a metaphor for
p156
aVmemory, what is it?
p157
aa(lp158
VNetra and I use our technology
p159
aVas a tool in our 200-year plan
p160
aVto really curate our digital legacy.
p161
aa(lp162
VThat is a picture of my mother,
p163
aVand she recently got a Facebook account.
p164
aVYou know where this is going.
p165
aVAnd I've been very supportive
p166
aVuntil this picture shows up
p167
aVon my Facebook page. (Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd I actually untagged myself
p170
aVfirst, then I picked up the
p171
aVphone. I said, "Mom, you will
p172
aVnever put a picture of me
p173
aVin a bikini ever again."
p174
aVAnd she said, "Why? You look
p175
aVso cute, darling." I said,
p176
aV"You just don't understand."
p177
aa(lp178
VMaybe we are among the first
p179
aVgeneration that really understands
p180
aVthis digital curating of ourselves.
p181
aVMaybe we are the first to even
p182
aVactively record our lives.
p183
aa(lp184
VYou know, whether you
p185
aVagree with, you know, legacy
p186
aVor not, we are actually leaving
p187
aVbehind digital traces all the time.
p188
aVSo Netra and I really wanted
p189
aVto use our 200-year plan
p190
aVto curate this digital legacy,
p191
aVand not only digital legacy
p192
aVbut we believe in curating
p193
aVthe legacy of my past
p194
aVand future.
p195
aa(lp196
VHow, you may ask?
p197
aa(lp198
VWell, when I think of the future,
p199
aVI never see myself moving forward
p200
aVin time. I actually see time
p201
aVmoving backward towards me.
p202
aVI can actually visualize
p203
aVmy future approaching.
p204
aVI can dodge what I don't want
p205
aVand pull in what I want.
p206
aVIt's like a video game obstacle
p207
aVcourse. And I've gotten better and better
p208
aVat doing this. Even when I make
p209
aVa painting, I actually imagine
p210
aVI'm behind the painting,
p211
aVit already exists, and
p212
aVsomeone's looking at it,
p213
aVand I see whether they're
p214
aVfeeling it from their gut.
p215
aVAre they feeling it from their
p216
aVheart, or is it just a cerebral thing?
p217
aVAnd it really informs my painting.
p218
aVEven when I do an art show,
p219
aVI really think about, what should
p220
aVpeople walk away with?
p221
aa(lp222
VI remember when I was 19,
p223
aVI did, I wanted to do my first
p224
aVart exhibition, and I wanted the
p225
aVwhole world to know about it.
p226
aVI didn't know TED then,
p227
aVbut what I did was I closed
p228
aVmy eyes tight, and I started
p229
aVdreaming. I could imagine people
p230
aVcoming in, dressed up, looking
p231
aVbeautiful, my paintings with all
p232
aVthe light, and in my visualization
p233
aVI actually saw a very famous
p234
aVactress launching my show,
p235
aVgiving credibility to me.
p236
aVAnd I woke up from my
p237
aVvisualization and I said,
p238
aVwho was that? I couldn't tell
p239
aVif it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha,
p240
aVtwo very famous Indian actresses,
p241
aVlike the Meryl Streeps of India.
p242
aa(lp243
VAs it turned out, next morning
p244
aVI wrote a letter to both of them,
p245
aVand Shabana Azmi replied,
p246
aVand came and launched
p247
aVmy very first show 12 years ago.
p248
aVAnd what a bang it started
p249
aVmy career with! You know,
p250
aVwhen we think of time in this
p251
aVway, we can curate not only the
p252
aVfuture but also the past.
p253
aVThis is a picture of my family,
p254
aVand that is Netra, my wife.
p255
aVShe's the co-creator of my
p256
aV200-year plan.
p257
aa(lp258
VNetra's a high school history
p259
aVteacher. I love Netra,
p260
aVbut I hate history.
p261
aVI keep saying, "Nets, you live
p262
aVin the past while I'll create
p263
aVthe future, and when I'm done,
p264
aVyou can study about it."
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VShe gave me an indulgent smile,
p268
aVand as punishment, she said,
p269
aV"Tomorrow I'm teaching a class
p270
aVon Indian history, and you are
p271
aVsitting in it, and I'm grading you."
p272
aa(lp273
VI'm like, "Oh, God." I went.
p274
aa(lp275
VI actually went and sat in
p276
aVon her class. She started by
p277
aVgiving students primary source
p278
aVdocuments from India, Pakistan,
p279
aVfrom Britain, and I said,
p280
aV"Wow." Then she asked them to
p281
aVseparate fact from bias.
p282
aVI said, "Wow," again.
p283
aVThen she said, "Choose your
p284
aVfacts and biases and create an
p285
aVimage of your own story
p286
aVof dignity."
p287
aa(lp288
VHistory as an imaging tool?
p289
aVI was so inspired.
p290
aa(lp291
VI went and created my own
p292
aVversion of Indian history.
p293
aVI actually included stories from
p294
aVmy grandmother.
p295
aVShe used to work for the
p296
aVtelephone exchange, and she used
p297
aVto actually overhear conversations
p298
aVbetween Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.
p299
aVAnd she used to hear all
p300
aVkinds of things she shouldn't
p301
aVhave heard. But, you know,
p302
aVI include things like that.
p303
aVThis is my version of Indian history.
p304
aa(lp305
VYou know, if this
p306
aVis so, it occurred to me that
p307
aVmaybe, just maybe, the primary
p308
aVobjective of our brains
p309
aVis to serve our dignity.
p310
aVGo tell Facebook to
p311
aVfigure that out!
p312
aa(lp313
VNetra and I don't write our
p314
aV200-year plan for someone else
p315
aVto come and execute it
p316
aVin 150 years. Imagine receiving
p317
aVa parcel saying, from the past,
p318
aVokay now you're supposed to
p319
aVspend the rest of your life
p320
aVdoing all of this. No.
p321
aVWe actually write it only
p322
aVto set our attitudes right.
p323
aa(lp324
VYou know, I used to believe
p325
aVthat education is the most
p326
aVimportant tool to leave
p327
aVa meaningful legacy.
p328
aVEducation is great.
p329
aVIt really teaches us who
p330
aVwe are, and helps us
p331
aVcontextualize ourselves
p332
aVin the world, but it's really
p333
aVmy creativity that's taught me
p334
aVthat I can be much more
p335
aVthan what my education told me I am.
p336
aa(lp337
VI'd like to make
p338
aVthe argument that creativity is
p339
aVthe most important tool we have.
p340
aVIt lets us create who we are,
p341
aVand curate what is to come.
p342
aa(lp343
VI like to think \u2014 Thank you.
p344
aa(lp345
VI like to think of myself
p346
aVas a storyteller, where my past
p347
aVand my future are only stories,
p348
aVmy stories, waiting to be told
p349
aVand retold. I hope all of you
p350
aVone day get a chance to
p351
aVshare and write your own
p352
aV200-year story.
p353
aa(lp354
VThank you so much.
p355
aa(lp356
VShukran! (Applause)

(He even views his lavish Indian wedding as a piece of performance art.)</p><p>His early work as a painter made a complete break with his cartoon career -- he painted watercolors on canvas using only his hands and feet. Since then, his work has grown to knit together aesthetics from both worlds, as collage and complication play against flat color and precise lines. He shows in galleries and performance spaces around the world and often collaborates with other artists, most recently with musicians Paul Simon and Erykah Badu. &nbsp;In 2011, he launched his children&#39;s iPad book, <em>Pop-it</em>, shaking up the concept &nbsp;of an ideal family.

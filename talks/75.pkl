VVideo: Narrator: An event seen from one point of view
p5
aVgives one impression.
p6
aVSeen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.
p7
aVBut it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand
p8
aVwhat's going on.
p9
aa(lp10
VSasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?
p11
aVAnd I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about
p12
aVthe power of, and importance of, independent media
p13
aVthan I could say in an hour.
p14
aVSo I thought that it will be good to start with it.
p15
aVAnd also start with a little bit of statistics.
p16
aVAccording to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet
p17
aVlives in the societies without independent press.
p18
aVThink about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet
p19
aVdoes not really know what is going on in their countries.
p20
aVThe information they get gets filtered through somebody
p21
aVwho either twists that information, or colors that information,
p22
aVdoes something with it.
p23
aVSo they're deprived of understanding their reality.
p24
aVThat is just to understand how big and important this problem is.
p25
aVNow those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies
p26
aVthat represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.
p27
aVYou know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.
p28
aVEnjoy it while it lasts.
p29
aVBecause as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags,
p30
aVbut they can also lose press freedom,
p31
aVas I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.
p32
aVBut that's totally another and separate topic.
p33
aVSo I can go back to my story.
p34
aa(lp35
VMy story starts \u2014 the story I want to share \u2014 starts in 1991.
p36
aVAt that time I was running B92, the only independent,
p37
aVfor that matter the only electronic media, in the country.
p38
aVAnd I guess we were sharing \u2014 we had that regular life of the only
p39
aVindependent media in the country, operating in hostile environment,
p40
aVwhere government really wants to make your life miserable.
p41
aVAnd there are different ways.
p42
aVYeah, it was the usual cocktail:
p43
aVa little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice,
p44
aVa little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control,
p45
aVso you always have somebody who never leaves your office.
p46
aVBut what they really do, which is very powerful,
p47
aVand that is what governments in the late '90s started doing
p48
aVif they don't like independent media companies \u2014
p49
aVyou know, they threaten your advertisers.
p50
aVOnce they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually,
p51
aVyou know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come \u2014
p52
aVno matter how much does it make sense for them \u2014
p53
aVdo not want to come and advertise.
p54
aVAnd you have a problem making ends meet.
p55
aa(lp56
VAt that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem,
p57
aVwhich was, you know, survival below one side,
p58
aVbut what was really painful for me was,
p59
aVremember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.
p60
aVWe were sitting over there with a country in a downfall,
p61
aVin a slow-motion downfall.
p62
aVAnd we all had all of that on tapes.
p63
aVWe had the ability to understand what was going on.
p64
aVWe were actually recording history.
p65
aVThe problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later;
p66
aVbecause if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes
p67
aVto keep archives of that history.
p68
aVSo if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.
p69
aVIn that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.
p70
aVIt was still 1991.
p71
aVHe was running a media systems organization
p72
aVwhich is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.
p73
aVAnd what did I know at that time about media systems?
p74
aVI would think media systems were organizations,
p75
aVwhich means they should help you.
p76
aVSo I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans:
p77
aVthe small one and the big one.
p78
aVThe small one was, I just wanted him
p79
aVto help us get those damn tapes,
p80
aVso we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.
p81
aVThe big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.
p82
aVBecause I thought, I still maintain,
p83
aVthat serious and independent media companies are great business.
p84
aVAnd I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company
p85
aVonce Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.
p86
aVIt's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest
p87
aVmedia company in the country.
p88
aVAnd I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time
p89
aVwas 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.
p90
aa(lp91
VTo make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office,
p92
aVgreat suit and tie.
p93
aVI gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation
p94
aVof the political situation and explained how hard and difficult
p95
aVthe war will be.
p96
aVActually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.
p97
aVAnyway, after that whole, big, long explanation,
p98
aVthe only question he had for me \u2014 and this is not a joke \u2014
p99
aVis, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music
p100
aVof Michael Jackson?
p101
aVThat was really the only question he had.
p102
aVHe left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself
p103
aVbecause I thought there must be an institution in the world
p104
aVthat is providing loans to media companies.
p105
aVIt's so obvious, straight in your face,
p106
aVand somebody must have thought of it.
p107
aVSomebody must have started something like that.
p108
aVAnd I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.
p109
aVYou know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time;
p110
aVyou could not just Google in '91.
p111
aVSo I thought that that's actually my problem.
p112
aVNow we go from here, fast forward to 1995.
p113
aa(lp114
VI have \u2014 I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros,
p115
aVtrying for the third time to convince him that
p116
aVhis foundation should invest in something that should
p117
aVoperate like a media bank.
p118
aVAnd basically what I was saying is very simple.
p119
aVYou know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.
p120
aVForget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.
p121
aVWhat you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.
p122
aVIt's business anywhere.
p123
aVMedia business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.
p124
aVAnd what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.
p125
aVSo third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.
p126
aVAt the end of the meeting he says,
p127
aVlook, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back;
p128
aVbut my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.
p129
aVSee that it will not work.
p130
aVHe said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVI knew two things after that meeting.
p133
aVFirst, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.
p134
aVAnd second, that I have no idea how to make it work.
p135
aVYou see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.
p136
aVBut it's one thing to have a concept;
p137
aVit's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.
p140
aVHad the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.
p141
aVYou see banks \u2014 I don't know if there are any bankers over here;
p142
aVI apologize in advance \u2014 but it's the best job in the world.
p143
aVYou know, you find somebody who is respectable
p144
aVand has a lot of money.
p145
aVYou give them more money; they repay you that over a time.
p146
aVYou collect interest and do nothing in between.
p147
aVSo I thought, why don't we get into that business?
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aVSo here we are having our first client, brilliant.
p150
aVFirst independent newspaper in Slovakia.
p151
aVThe government cutting them off
p152
aVfrom all the printing facilities in Bratislava.
p153
aVSo here's the daily newspaper
p154
aVthat has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.
p155
aVIt's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.
p156
aVThat means that they have no sports;
p157
aVthey have no latest news; circulation goes down.
p158
aVIt's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way
p159
aVhow to economically strangle a daily newspaper.
p160
aVThey come to us with a request for a loan.
p161
aVThey want to \u2014 the only way for them to survive
p162
aVis to get a printing press.
p163
aVAnd we said, that's fine; let's meet;
p164
aVyou'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.
p165
aa(lp166
VWe start the meeting.
p167
aVI get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,
p168
aVso it's much bigger.
p169
aVA lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.
p170
aVBut however you put it, you know, the numbers
p171
aVdo not make any sense.
p172
aVAnd that's the best they could do.
p173
aVWe were the best that they could do.
p174
aVSo that is how we understood what our method is.
p175
aVIt's not a bank. We had to actually
p176
aVgo into these companies and earn our return
p177
aVby fixing them \u2014 by establishing management systems,
p178
aVby providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business
p179
aVon one side \u2014 while they all know how to run, how to create content.
p180
aa(lp181
VJust quickly on the results.
p182
aVOver these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing,
p183
aVaverage interest rate five percent to six percent.
p184
aVLately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.
p185
aVWe do it in 17 countries of the developing world.
p186
aVAnd here is the most stunning number.
p187
aVReturn rate \u2014 the one that Soros was so worried about \u2014 97 percent.
p188
aV97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time.
p189
aVWhat do we typically finance?
p190
aVWe finance anything that a media company would need,
p191
aVfrom printing presses to transmitters.
p192
aVWhat is most important is we do it
p193
aVeither in form of loans, equities, lease \u2014
p194
aVwhatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.
p195
aVBut what is most important here is, who do we finance?
p196
aVWe believe that in the last 10 years companies
p197
aVthat we've financed are actually the best media companies
p198
aVin the developing world.
p199
aVThat is a "Who is Who" list.
p200
aVAnd I could spend hours talking about them,
p201
aVbecause they're all kind of heroes.
p202
aVAnd I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,
p203
aVand depending on time I may give you two examples
p204
aVwho we work with.
p205
aa(lp206
VYou see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe,
p207
aVand moved to Russia.
p208
aVOur first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.
p209
aVI'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.
p210
aVIn the south of Russia there's a guy called
p211
aVBoris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running
p212
aVan independent newspaper there.
p213
aVThe city was closed until early '90s
p214
aVbecause, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.
p215
aVAnyway, he's running independent newspaper there.
p216
aVAfter two years working with us, he becomes
p217
aVthe most respected newspaper in that small place.
p218
aVGovernor comes to him one day,
p219
aVactually invites him to come to his office.
p220
aVHe goes and sees the governor. The governor says,
p221
aVBoris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job,
p222
aVand you are the most respected newspaper in our district.
p223
aVAnd I want to offer you a deal.
p224
aVCan you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,
p225
aVbecause I have elections \u2014
p226
aVthere are elections coming up in nine months.
p227
aVI will not run, but it's very important for me
p228
aVwho is going to succeed me.
p229
aVSo give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.
p230
aVI have no interest in being in media business.
p231
aVHow much would that cost?
p232
aVBoris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."
p233
aVThe governor says, "We will close you."
p234
aVBoris Nikolayevich says, "No, you cannot do it."
p235
aVSix months later the newspaper was closed.
p236
aVLuckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich
p237
aVtake all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one,
p238
aVto get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.
p239
aVSo what the governor got was an empty shell.
p240
aVBut that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,
p241
aVand if you are a banker for independent media.
p242
aVSo it sounds like a great story.
p243
aa(lp244
VSomewhere down the road we opened a media management center.
p245
aVWe started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.
p246
aVBut there is a second angle to that.
p247
aVThe second angle, like in this clip.
p248
aVIf you take the camera above, you start thinking
p249
aVabout these numbers again.
p250
aV40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries.
p251
aVThat is not too much, is it?
p252
aVIt's actually just a drop in the sea.
p253
aVBecause when you think about the importance,
p254
aVsome of the issues that we were talking about last night \u2014
p255
aVthis last session we had about Africa and his
p256
aVhypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.
p257
aVAll of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night \u2014
p258
aVgovernment accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption,
p259
aVgiving voice to unheard, to poor \u2014
p260
aVit's why independent media is in business.
p261
aVAnd it's why it was invented.
p262
aVSo from that perspective, what we did is just really
p263
aVone drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.
p264
aVNow ours is just one story.
p265
aa(lp266
VI'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories
p267
aVof nonprofits doing spectacular work.
p268
aVHere is where the problem is,
p269
aVand I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.
p270
aVAnd it's called fundraising.
p271
aVImagine that this third of this room is filled
p272
aVwith people who represent different foundations.
p273
aVImagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations,
p274
aVdoing very important work.
p275
aVNow imagine that every second person over here
p276
aVis deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.
p277
aVNow that is how difficult it is to match people
p278
aVfrom this side of the room
p279
aVwith people of that side of the room.
p280
aVSo we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed
p281
aVto reform, to totally rethink fundraising.
p282
aVYou know, instead of people running in this dark,
p283
aVtrying to find their own match, who will be willing,
p284
aVwho has the same goals.
p285
aVInstead of all of that we thought there is \u2014
p286
aVsomething new needs to be invented.
p287
aVAnd we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,
p288
aVpress freedom bonds.
p289
aVIf there are investors willing to finance
p290
aVU.S. government budget deficit,
p291
aVwhy wouldn't we find investors willing to finance
p292
aVpress freedom deficit?
p293
aVWe've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them,
p294
aVprobably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.
p295
aVI don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.
p296
aVBut the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them,
p297
aVfind enough investors that this can be considered a success,
p298
aVthere's nothing stopping the next organization
p299
aVto start to issue bonds next spring.
p300
aVAnd those can be environmental bonds.
p301
aVAnd then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his
p302
aVelectricity in Bangladesh bonds.
p303
aVAnd before you know it, any social cause
p304
aVcan be actually financed in this way.
p305
aa(lp306
VNow we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.
p307
aVBut let's take the idea further.
p308
aVYou do it, you start it in the States, because it's,
p309
aVyou know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.
p310
aVBut you can actually bring it to Europe, too.
p311
aVYou can bring it to Asia.
p312
aVYou can, once you have all of those different points,
p313
aVyou can make it easy for investors.
p314
aVPut all of those bonds at one place
p315
aVand they sit down and click.
p316
aVOnce you have more than 10 of them
p317
aVyou have to develop some kind of a matrix.
p318
aVWhat do investors get?
p319
aVOn one side financial, on the other side social.
p320
aVSo that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency,
p321
aVMorningstar type.
p322
aVIt says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.
p323
aVFinancial, they give you one percent, only one star.
p324
aVNow take it to the last step.
p325
aVOnce you have all of that put together,
p326
aVthere's not one reason why you couldn't actually have
p327
aVa marketplace for all of that,
p328
aVwhere you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.
p329
aVAnd in that way you organize the financing
p330
aVso there are no dark rooms, no blind people
p331
aVrunning around to find each other.
p332
aa(lp333
VThank you.

In most of the countries where his <a href=\\"http://www.mdlf.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Media Development Loan Fund</a>  is active, management skills are dramatically lacking, and too often, <strong>grants backfire by creating a dependency</strong> that cannot be sustained when the Western donors leave. </p><p>All the projects supported by <a href=\\"http://www.mdlf.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MDLF</a>  espouse the reverse philosophy: It doesn&#39;t give grants.

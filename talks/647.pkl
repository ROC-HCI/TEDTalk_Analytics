VFor years I've been feeling frustrated,
p5
aVbecause as a religious historian,
p6
aVI've become acutely aware
p7
aVof the centrality of compassion
p8
aVin all the major world faiths.
p9
aVEvery single one of them
p10
aVhas evolved their own version
p11
aVof what's been called the Golden Rule.
p12
aVSometimes it comes in a positive version \u2014
p13
aV"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."
p14
aVAnd equally important
p15
aVis the negative version \u2014
p16
aV"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
p17
aVLook into your own heart,
p18
aVdiscover what it is that gives you pain
p19
aVand then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever,
p20
aVto inflict that pain on anybody else.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd people have emphasized the importance of compassion,
p23
aVnot just because it sounds good,
p24
aVbut because it works.
p25
aVPeople have found that when they have
p26
aVimplemented the Golden Rule
p27
aVas Confucius said, "all day and every day,"
p28
aVnot just a question of doing your good deed for the day
p29
aVand then returning to a life of greed
p30
aVand egotism,
p31
aVbut to do it all day and every day,
p32
aVyou dethrone yourself from the center of your world,
p33
aVput another there, and you transcend yourself.
p34
aVAnd it brings you into the presence
p35
aVof what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.
p36
aVSomething that goes beyond
p37
aVwhat we know in our ego-bound existence.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut you know you'd never know it a lot of the time,
p40
aVthat this was so central to the religious life.
p41
aVBecause with a few wonderful exceptions,
p42
aVvery often when religious people come together,
p43
aVreligious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines
p44
aVor uttering a council of hatred
p45
aVor inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.
p46
aVOften people don't really want to be compassionate.
p47
aVI sometimes see
p48
aVwhen I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people
p49
aVa sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces
p50
aVbecause people often want to be right instead.
p51
aVAnd that of course defeats the object of the exercise.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow why was I so grateful to TED?
p54
aVBecause they took me very gently
p55
aVfrom my book-lined study
p56
aVand brought me into the 21st century,
p57
aVenabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience
p58
aVthan I could have ever conceived.
p59
aVBecause I feel an urgency about this.
p60
aVIf we don't manage to implement
p61
aVthe Golden Rule globally,
p62
aVso that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,
p63
aVas though they were as important as ourselves,
p64
aVI doubt that we'll have
p65
aVa viable world to hand on to the next generation.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe task of our time,
p68
aVone of the great tasks of our time,
p69
aVis to build a global society, as I said,
p70
aVwhere people can live together in peace.
p71
aVAnd the religions that should be making a major contribution
p72
aVare instead seen as part of the problem.
p73
aVAnd of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
p74
aVThis is the source of all morality,
p75
aVthis imaginative act of empathy,
p76
aVputting yourself in the place of another.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd so we have a choice, it seems to me.
p79
aVWe can either go on bringing out or emphasizing
p80
aVthe dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith,
p81
aVor we can go back to
p82
aVthe rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,
p83
aVwho, when asked by a pagan
p84
aVto sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,
p85
aVsaid, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.
p86
aVThat is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that
p89
aVany interpretation of scripture
p90
aVthat bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.
p91
aVAnd we need to revive that spirit.
p92
aVAnd it's not just going to happen
p93
aVbecause a spirit of love wafts us down.
p94
aVWe have to make this happen,
p95
aVand we can do it
p96
aVwith the modern communications
p97
aVthat TED has introduced.
p98
aVAlready I've been tremendously heartened
p99
aVat the response of all our partners.
p100
aa(lp101
VIn Singapore, we have a group
p102
aVgoing to use the Charter to heal divisions
p103
aVrecently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,
p104
aVand some members of the parliament want
p105
aVto implement it politically.
p106
aVIn Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition
p107
aVin which leading artists are going to be
p108
aVtaking people, young people,
p109
aVand showing them that compassion also lies
p110
aVat the root of all art.
p111
aVThroughout Europe, the Muslim communities
p112
aVare holding events and discussions,
p113
aVare discussing the centrality of compassion
p114
aVin Islam and in all faiths.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.
p117
aVReligious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,
p118
aVconcentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.
p119
aVReligious teaching must always lead to action.
p120
aVAnd I intend to work on this till my dying day.
p121
aVAnd I want to continue with our partners
p122
aVto do two things \u2014
p123
aVeducate and stimulate compassionate thinking.
p124
aVEducation because we've so
p125
aVdropped out of compassion.
p126
aVPeople often think it simply means
p127
aVfeeling sorry for somebody.
p128
aVBut of course you don't understand compassion
p129
aVif you're just going to think about it.
p130
aVYou also have to do it.
p131
aa(lp132
VI want them to get the media involved
p133
aVbecause the media are crucial
p134
aVin helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views
p135
aVwe have of other people,
p136
aVwhich are dividing us from one another.
p137
aVThe same applies to educators.
p138
aVI'd like youth to get a sense of
p139
aVthe dynamism, the dynamic and challenge
p140
aVof a compassionate lifestyle.
p141
aVAnd also see that it demands acute intelligence,
p142
aVnot just a gooey feeling.
p143
aa(lp144
VI'd like to call upon scholars to explore
p145
aVthe compassionate theme
p146
aVin their own and in other people's traditions.
p147
aVAnd perhaps above all,
p148
aVto encourage a sensitivity about
p149
aVuncompassionate speaking,
p150
aVso that because people have this Charter,
p151
aVwhatever their beliefs or lack of them,
p152
aVthey feel empowered
p153
aVto challenge uncompassionate speech,
p154
aVdisdainful remarks
p155
aVfrom their religious leaders, their political leaders,
p156
aVfrom the captains of industry.
p157
aVBecause we can change the world,
p158
aVwe have the ability.
p159
aa(lp160
VI would never have thought of putting the Charter online.
p161
aVI was still stuck in the old world
p162
aVof a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room
p163
aVand issuing yet another arcane statement.
p164
aVAnd TED introduced me to a whole new way
p165
aVof thinking and presenting ideas.
p166
aVBecause that is what is so wonderful about TED.
p167
aVIn this room, all this expertise,
p168
aVif we joined it all together,
p169
aVwe could change the world.
p170
aVAnd of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut I'd just like to quote, finish at the end
p173
aVwith a reference to a British author, an Oxford author
p174
aVwhom I don't quote very often,
p175
aVC.S. Lewis.
p176
aVBut he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind
p177
aVever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.
p178
aVIt's in his book "The Four Loves."
p179
aVHe said that he distinguished between erotic love,
p180
aVwhen two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.
p181
aVAnd then he compared that to friendship,
p182
aVwhen two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,
p183
aVwith their eyes fixed on a common goal.
p184
aa(lp185
VWe don't have to fall in love with each other,
p186
aVbut we can become friends.
p187
aVAnd I am convinced.
p188
aVI felt it very strongly
p189
aVduring our little deliberations at Vevey,
p190
aVthat when people of all different persuasions
p191
aVcome together, working side by side
p192
aVfor a common goal,
p193
aVdifferences melt away.
p194
aVAnd we learn amity.
p195
aVAnd we learn to live together and to get to know one another.
p196
aVThank you very much.
p197
aV(Applause)

In February 2009, the words were given to the Council of Conscience, a gathering of religious leaders and thinkers, who crafted the final document based on global input. The Charter was officially launched in November 2009. It has been signed by notable world leaders including Pope Benedict XVI, the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Deepak Chopra and Muhammad Ali.

has written more than 20 books on faith and the major religions, studying what Islam, Judaism and Christianity have in common, and how our faiths shaped world history and drive current events.</p>  <p>A former nun, Armstrong has written two books about this experience:&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/narrowgate\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Through the Narrow Gate</em></a>, about her seven years in the convent, and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/spiralstaircase\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Spiral Staircase</em></a>, about her subsequent spiritual awakening, when she developed her iconoclastic take on the major monotheistic religions -- and on the strains of fundamentalism common to all. She is a powerful voice for ecumenical understanding.</p>  <p>Armstrong&#39;s 2008 TED Prize wish asked the world to help her create the&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://charterforcompassion.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Charter for Compassion</a>, a document around which religious leaders can work together for peace. The Charter is based on the Golden Rule: that we should treat others how we would want to be treated. In fall 2008, the first draft of the charter was written by the world, via a sharing website. In February 2009, the words were given to the Council of Conscience, a gathering of religious leaders and thinkers, who crafted the final document based on global input. The Charter was officially launched in November 2009. It has been signed by notable world leaders including Pope Benedict XVI, the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Deepak Chopra and Muhammad Ali. The Charter has led to the creation of the Charter for Compassion International (CCI) organization, the Compassionate Communities campaign, and Global Compassion Council &ndash; a group of leaders continuing the movement around the the world.</p>", "slug": "karen_armstrong", "whotheyare": "Karen Armstrong -- winner of the 2008 TED Prize -- is a provocative, original thinker on the role of religion in the modern world.", "whatotherssay": "Her idea is to start a new \'theology of power,\' based on the Golden Rule.", "id": 208, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/34769_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Let\'s revive the Golden Rule", "take_action": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "link_url": "http://www.charterforcompassion.org/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "verb": "sign_up", "published": true, "visible_url": "charterforcompassion.org", "type": "take_action", "blurb": "**Sign** the Charter for Compassion and share its message with others."}], "comments": 529, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "Karen Armstrong\'s TED Prize wish", "link_url": "http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/charter-for-compassion-karen-armstrong", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "", "type": "from_the_blog", "blurb": "In 2008, the religious scholar wished for humanity to come together and create an interfaith bill of rights for justice and understanding.

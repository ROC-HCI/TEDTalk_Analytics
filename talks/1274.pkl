VHave you ever wanted to stay young a little longer
p5
aVand put off aging?
p6
aVThis is a dream of the ages.
p7
aVBut scientists have for a long time
p8
aVthought this just was never going to be possible.
p9
aVThey thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it \u2014
p10
aVkind of like an old shoe.
p11
aVBut if you look in nature,
p12
aVyou see that different kinds of animals
p13
aVcan have really different lifespans.
p14
aVNow these animals are different from one another,
p15
aVbecause they have different genes.
p16
aVSo that suggests
p17
aVthat somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,
p18
aVare genes for aging,
p19
aVgenes that allow them to have different lifespans.
p20
aVSo if there are genes like that,
p21
aVthen you can imagine that,
p22
aVif you could change one of the genes in an experiment,
p23
aVan aging gene,
p24
aVmaybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.
p25
aVAnd if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.
p26
aVAnd if they exist and you can find them,
p27
aVthen maybe one could eventually do something about it.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo we've set out to look for genes that control aging.
p30
aVAnd we didn't study any of these animals.
p31
aVInstead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,
p32
aVwhich is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.
p33
aVAnd we were really optimistic that we could find something
p34
aVbecause there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.
p35
aVSo we started to change genes at random,
p36
aVlooking for long-lived animals.
p37
aVAnd we were very lucky to find
p38
aVthat mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2
p39
aVdoubled the lifespan of the little worm.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo you can see in black, after a month \u2014
p42
aVthey're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them
p43
aVfor studies of aging \u2014
p44
aVin black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.
p45
aVBut at that time,
p46
aVmost of the mutant worms are still alive.
p47
aVAnd it isn't until twice as long
p48
aVthat they're all dead.
p49
aVAnd now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.
p50
aVSo the first thing you're going to see
p51
aVis the normal worm
p52
aVwhen it's about college student age \u2014 a young adult.
p53
aVIt's quite a cute little fellow.
p54
aVAnd next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.
p55
aVSo this animal is going to live twice as long.
p56
aVIs it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.
p57
aVIt's active. You can't tell the difference really.
p58
aVAnd they can be completely fertile \u2014
p59
aVhave the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow get out your handkerchiefs here.
p62
aVYou're going to see, in just two weeks,
p63
aVthe normal worms are old.
p64
aVYou can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.
p65
aVBut everything else is just lying there.
p66
aVThe animal's clearly in the nursing home.
p67
aVAnd if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.
p68
aVYou know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans \u2014
p69
aVwhich probably most of you haven't seen one \u2014
p70
aVyou can tell they're old \u2014 isn't that interesting?
p71
aa(lp72
VSo there's something about aging that's kind of universal.
p73
aVAnd now here is the daf-2 mutant.
p74
aVOne gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.
p75
aVIt's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home;
p76
aVit's going skiing.
p77
aVThis is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.
p78
aVIt takes this worm two days
p79
aVto age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.
p80
aVAnd when I tell people about this,
p81
aVthey tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person
p82
aVwho looks really good for being 90 or 80.
p83
aVBut it's really more like this:
p84
aVlet's say you're a 30 year-old guy \u2014 or in your 30s \u2014
p85
aVand you're a bachelor and you're dating people.
p86
aVAnd you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.
p87
aVAnd you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?"
p88
aVShe says, "I'm 60."
p89
aVThat's what it's like. And you would never know.
p90
aVYou would never know, until she told you.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VOkay.
p95
aVSo what is the daf-2 gene?
p96
aVWell as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,
p97
aVthey're instructions to make a protein that does something.
p98
aVAnd the daf-2 gene
p99
aVencodes a hormone receptor.
p100
aVSo what you see in the picture there
p101
aVis a cell with a hormone receptor in red
p102
aVpunching through the edge of the cell.
p103
aVSo part of it is like a baseball glove.
p104
aVPart of it's on the outside,
p105
aVand it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green.
p106
aVAnd the other part is on the inside
p107
aVwhere it sends signals into the cell.
p108
aa(lp109
VOkay, so what is the daf-2 receptor
p110
aVtelling the inside of the cell?
p111
aVI just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,
p112
aVthat you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;
p113
aVthe animal lives longer.
p114
aVSo that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor
p115
aVis to speed up aging.
p116
aVThat's what that arrow means.
p117
aVIt speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.
p118
aVSo it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,
p119
aVspeeding up aging.
p120
aVSo this is altogether really, really interesting.
p121
aVIt says that aging is subject to control by the genes,
p122
aVand specifically by hormones.
p123
aVSo what kind of hormones are these?
p124
aVThere's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.
p125
aVYou know about a lot of them.
p126
aVThese hormones are similar
p127
aVto hormones that we have in our bodies.
p128
aVThe daf-2 hormone receptor
p129
aVis very similar to the receptor
p130
aVfor the hormone insulin and IGF-1.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow you've all heard of at least insulin.
p133
aVInsulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients
p134
aVinto your tissues after you eat a meal.
p135
aVAnd the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.
p136
aVSo these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,
p137
aVbut our studies suggested
p138
aVthat maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about \u2014
p139
aVmaybe they also affect aging.
p140
aVAnd it's looking like that's the case.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,
p143
aVpeople who worked on other kinds of animals
p144
aVstarted asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation,
p145
aVthe hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,
p146
aVwill they live longer?
p147
aVAnd that is the case in flies.
p148
aVIf you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.
p149
aVAnd also in mice \u2014 and mice are mammals like us.
p150
aVSo it's an ancient pathway,
p151
aVbecause it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution
p152
aVsuch that it still works in all these animals.
p153
aVAnd also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo maybe it's working in people the same way.
p156
aVAnd there are hints of this.
p157
aVSo for example, there was one study that was done
p158
aVin a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.
p159
aVAnd just like any population,
p160
aVmost of the people live to be about 70 or 80,
p161
aVbut some live to be 90 or 100.
p162
aVAnd what they found
p163
aVwas that people who lived to 90 or 100
p164
aVwere more likely to have daf-2 mutations \u2014
p165
aVthat is, changes in the gene
p166
aVthat encodes the receptor for IGF-1.
p167
aVAnd these changes made the gene not act as well
p168
aVas the normal gene would have acted.
p169
aVIt damaged the gene.
p170
aVSo those are hints
p171
aVsuggesting that humans are susceptible
p172
aVto the effects of the hormones for aging.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo the next question, of course, is:
p175
aVIs there any effect on age-related disease?
p176
aVAs you age, you're much more likely
p177
aVto get cancer, Alzheimer's disease,
p178
aVheart disease, all sorts of diseases.
p179
aVIt turns out that these long-lived mutants
p180
aVare more resistant to all these diseases.
p181
aVThey hardly get cancer,
p182
aVand when they do it's not as severe.
p183
aVSo it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,
p184
aVthat they're still young,
p185
aVso why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?
p186
aVSo it suggests
p187
aVthat, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take
p188
aVto replicate some of these effects in humans,
p189
aVmaybe we would have a way
p190
aVof combating lots of different age-related diseases
p191
aVall at once.
p192
aVSo how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?
p193
aVHow could that work?
p194
aa(lp195
VWell it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,
p196
aVa whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA
p197
aVthat encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues,
p198
aVand repair damage.
p199
aVAnd the way that they're switched on
p200
aVis by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.
p201
aVSo in a daf-2 mutant \u2014
p202
aVyou see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.
p203
aVThe receptor isn't working as well.
p204
aVUnder those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue
p205
aVhas gone into the nucleus \u2014
p206
aVthat little compartment there in the middle of the cell \u2014
p207
aVand it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.
p208
aVYou see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.
p209
aVAnd it's just sitting on one of them.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo FOXO turns on a lot of genes.
p212
aVAnd the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes,
p213
aVgenes I call carrot-giver genes,
p214
aVwhose protein products
p215
aVactually help other proteins to function well \u2014
p216
aVto fold correctly and function correctly.
p217
aVAnd it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell
p218
aVand recycle them if they're damaged.
p219
aVDNA repair genes
p220
aVare more active in these animals.
p221
aVAnd the immune system is more active.
p222
aVAnd many of these different genes, we've shown,
p223
aVactually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.
p224
aVSo it's really interesting.
p225
aVThese animals have within them
p226
aVthe latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.
p227
aVThey have the ability
p228
aVto protect themselves from many kinds of damage,
p229
aVwhich we think makes them live longer.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo what about the normal worm?
p232
aVWell when the daf-2 receptor is active,
p233
aVthen it triggers a series of events
p234
aVthat prevent FOXO
p235
aVfrom getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.
p236
aVSo it can't turn the genes on.
p237
aVThat's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan,
p238
aVuntil we have the daf-2 mutant.
p239
aVBut what good is this for the worm?
p240
aVWell we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones
p241
aVare hormones that are particularly active
p242
aVunder favorable conditions \u2014 in the good times \u2014
p243
aVwhen food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.
p244
aVThen they promote the uptake of nutrients.
p245
aVYou can store the food, use it for energy,
p246
aVgrow, etc.
p247
aa(lp248
VBut what we think is that, under conditions of stress,
p249
aVthe levels of these hormones drop \u2014
p250
aVfor example, having limited food supply.
p251
aVAnd that, we think,
p252
aVis registered by the animal as a danger signal,
p253
aVa signal that things are not okay
p254
aVand that it should roll out its protective capacity.
p255
aVSo it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,
p256
aVand that triggers the expression of these genes
p257
aVthat improves the ability of the cell
p258
aVto protect itself and repair itself.
p259
aVAnd that's why we think the animals live longer.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo you can think of FOXO
p262
aVas being like a building superintendent.
p263
aVSo maybe he's a little bit lazy,
p264
aVbut he's there, he's taking care of the building.
p265
aVBut it's deteriorating.
p266
aVAnd then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.
p267
aVSo he doesn't actually do anything himself.
p268
aVHe gets on the telephone \u2014
p269
aVjust like FOXO gets on the DNA \u2014
p270
aVand he calls up
p271
aVthe roofer, the window person,
p272
aVthe painter, the floor person.
p273
aVAnd they all come and they fortify the house.
p274
aVAnd then the hurricane comes through,
p275
aVand the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.
p276
aVAnd not only that, it can also just last longer,
p277
aVeven if there isn't a hurricane.
p278
aVSo that's the concept here
p279
aVfor how we think this life extension ability exists.
p280
aa(lp281
VNow the really cool thing about FOXO
p282
aVis that there are different forms of it.
p283
aVWe all have FOXO genes,
p284
aVbut we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.
p285
aVJust like we all have eyes,
p286
aVbut some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.
p287
aVAnd there are certain forms of the FOXO gene
p288
aVthat have found to be more frequently present
p289
aVin people who live to be 90 or 100.
p290
aVAnd that's the case all over the world,
p291
aVas you can see from these stars.
p292
aVAnd each one of these stars represents a population
p293
aVwhere scientists have asked,
p294
aV"Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genes
p295
aVamong people who live a really long time?" and there are.
p296
aVWe don't know the details of how this works,
p297
aVbut we do know then
p298
aVthat FOXO genes can impact
p299
aVthe lifespan of people.
p300
aVAnd that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit,
p301
aVwe can increase the health and longevity of people.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo this is really exciting to me.
p304
aVA FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms
p305
aVto affect lifespan,
p306
aVand here it affects lifespan in people.
p307
aVSo we've been trying in our lab now
p308
aVto develop drugs
p309
aVthat will activate this FOXO cell
p310
aVusing human cells now
p311
aVin order to try and come up with drugs
p312
aVthat will delay aging and age-related diseases.
p313
aVAnd I'm really optimistic that this is going to work.
p314
aa(lp315
VThere are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.
p316
aVAnd for at least one of them, there is a drug.
p317
aVThere's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,
p318
aVlike the insulin pathway.
p319
aVAnd mutations that damage the TOR gene \u2014
p320
aVjust like the daf-2 mutations \u2014
p321
aVextend lifespan in worms
p322
aVand flies and mice.
p323
aVBut in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin
p324
aVthat binds to the TOR protein
p325
aVand inhibits its activity.
p326
aVAnd you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse \u2014
p327
aVeven when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human,
p328
aVthat old for a mouse \u2014
p329
aVif you give the mouse rapamycin,
p330
aVit will live longer.
p331
aa(lp332
VNow I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.
p333
aVIt is a drug for people,
p334
aVbut the reason is it suppresses the immune system.
p335
aVSo people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.
p336
aVSo this may not be the perfect drug
p337
aVfor staying young longer.
p338
aVBut still, here in the year 2011,
p339
aVthere's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age
p340
aVthat will extend their lifespan,
p341
aVwhich comes out of this science
p342
aVthat's been done in all these different animals.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo I'm really optimistic,
p345
aVand I think it won't be too long, I hope,
p346
aVbefore this age-old dream begins to come true.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Applause)
p351
aa(lp352
VMatt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.
p353
aVLet me get this straight.
p354
aVAlthough you're looking for a drug
p355
aVthat can solve aging
p356
aVin old men like me,
p357
aVwhat you could do now pretty well in the lab,
p358
aVif you were allowed ethically,
p359
aVis start a human life from scratch
p360
aVwith altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?
p361
aa(lp362
VCK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about
p363
aVwould not change the genes,
p364
aVthey would just bind to the protein itself
p365
aVand change its activity.
p366
aVSo if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.
p367
aVYou could change the genes in principle.
p368
aVThere isn't the technology to do that.
p369
aVBut I don't think that's a good idea.
p370
aVAnd the reason is
p371
aVthat these hormones,
p372
aVlike the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,
p373
aVthey're essential.
p374
aVIf you knock them out completely, then you're very sick.
p375
aVSo it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully
p376
aVto get the benefits without getting any problems.
p377
aVAnd I think that's much better,
p378
aVthat kind of control would be much better as a drug.
p379
aVAnd also, there are other ways of activating FOXO
p380
aVthat don't even involve insulin or IGF-1
p381
aVthat might even be safer.
p382
aa(lp383
VMR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...
p384
aV(Laughter)
p385
aVThere's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about,
p386
aVwhich is a negligible senescence.
p387
aVThere are some creatures on this planet already
p388
aVthat don't really do aging.
p389
aVJust move to one side for us, if you would.
p390
aa(lp391
VCK: There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age.
p392
aVFor example, there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles.
p393
aVAnd they grow to be about this size.
p394
aVAnd they've been tagged, and they've been found to be 70 years old.
p395
aVAnd when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,
p396
aVyou can't tell the difference, just by looking,
p397
aVbetween those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.
p398
aVAnd the 70 year-old ones,
p399
aVactually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places,
p400
aVand they also have more progeny every year.
p401
aVAnd there are other examples of these kinds of animals,
p402
aVlike turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.
p403
aVAnd nobody knows if they really can live forever,
p404
aVor what keeps them from aging.
p405
aVIt's not clear.
p406
aa(lp407
VIf you look at birds, which live a long time,
p408
aVcells from the birds tend to be more resistant
p409
aVto a lot of different environmental stresses
p410
aVlike high temperature
p411
aVor hydrogen peroxide, things like that.
p412
aVAnd our long-lived mutants are too.
p413
aVThey're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.
p414
aVSo it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about,
p415
aVwhich are set to run really quickly in the worm,
p416
aVhave a different normal set point
p417
aVin something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.
p418
aVAnd maybe they're even set really differently
p419
aVin animals with no senescence at all \u2014 but we don't know.
p420
aa(lp421
VMR: But what you're talking about here
p422
aVis not extending human lifespan
p423
aVby preventing death,
p424
aVso much as extending human youthspan.
p425
aa(lp426
VCK: Yes, that's right.
p427
aVIt's more like, say, if you were a dog.
p428
aVYou notice that you're getting old, and you look at your human
p429
aVand you think, "Why isn't this human getting old?"
p430
aVThey're not getting old in the dog's lifespan.
p431
aVIt's more like that.
p432
aVBut now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human.
p433
aa(lp434
VMR: Thank you very much indeed, Cynthia Kenyon.

VWhen we think of Nepal,
p5
aVwe tend to think of the snow-capped mountains
p6
aVof the Himalayas,
p7
aVthe crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes,
p8
aVor the huge expanse of its grasslands.
p9
aVWhat some of us may not realize
p10
aVis that in the Himalayan foothills,
p11
aVwhere the climate is much warmer
p12
aVand the landscape much greener,
p13
aVthere lives a great diversity of wildlife,
p14
aVincluding the one-horned rhinoceros,
p15
aVthe Asian elephant
p16
aVand the Bengal tiger.
p17
aVBut unfortunately, these animals
p18
aVare under constant threat from poachers
p19
aVwho hunt and kill them for their body parts.
p20
aVTo stop the killing of these animals,
p21
aVbattalions of soldiers and rangers
p22
aVare sent to protect Nepal's national parks,
p23
aVbut that is not an easy task,
p24
aVbecause these soldiers have to patrol
p25
aVthousands of hectares of forests on foot
p26
aVor elephant backs.
p27
aVIt is also risky for these soldiers
p28
aVwhen they get into gunfights with poachers,
p29
aVand therefore Nepal is always looking
p30
aVfor new ways to help with protecting the forests
p31
aVand wildlife.
p32
aa(lp33
VWell recently, Nepal acquired a new tool
p34
aVin the fight against wildlife crime,
p35
aVand these are drones,
p36
aVor more specifically, conservation drones.
p37
aVFor about a year now, my colleagues and I
p38
aVhave been building drones for Nepal
p39
aVand training the park protection personnel
p40
aVon the use of these drones.
p41
aVNot only does a drone give you
p42
aVa bird's-eye view of the landscape,
p43
aVbut it also allows you to capture detailed,
p44
aVhigh-resolution images of objects on the ground.
p45
aVThis, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros
p46
aVtaking a cooling bath on a hot summer day
p47
aVin the lowlands of Nepal.
p48
aVNow we believe that drones have
p49
aVtremendous potential,
p50
aVnot only for combating wildlife crime,
p51
aVbut also for monitoring the health
p52
aVof these wildlife populations.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo what is a drone?
p55
aVWell, the kind of drone I'm talking about
p56
aVis simply a model aircraft
p57
aVfitted with an autopilot system,
p58
aVand this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,
p59
aVa GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter
p60
aVand a few other sensors.
p61
aVNow a drone like this
p62
aVis meant to carry a useful payload,
p63
aVsuch as a video camera
p64
aVor a photographic camera.
p65
aVIt also requires a software that allows the user
p66
aVto program a mission,
p67
aVto tell the drone where to go.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow people I talk to are often surprised
p70
aVwhen they hear that these are the only
p71
aVfour components that make a conservation drone,
p72
aVbut they are even more surprised
p73
aVwhen I tell them how affordable these components are.
p74
aVThe facts is, a conservation drone
p75
aVdoesn't cost very much more than
p76
aVa good laptop computer
p77
aVor a decent pair of binoculars.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo now that you've built your own conservation drone,
p80
aVyou probably want to go fly it,
p81
aVbut how does one fly a drone?
p82
aVWell, actually, you don't,
p83
aVbecause the drone flies itself.
p84
aVAll you have to do is to program a mission
p85
aVto tell the drone where to fly.
p86
aVBut you simply do that by clicking on
p87
aVa few way points on the Google Maps interface
p88
aVusing the open-source software.
p89
aVThose missions could be as simple
p90
aVas just a few way points,
p91
aVor they could be slightly longer and more complicated,
p92
aVto fly along a river system.
p93
aVSometimes, we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern
p94
aVand take pictures of that area,
p95
aVand those pictures can be processed
p96
aVto produce a map of that forest.
p97
aVOther researchers might want to fly the drone
p98
aValong the boundaries of a forest
p99
aVto watch out for poachers or people
p100
aVwho might be trying to enter the forest illegally.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow whatever your mission is,
p103
aVonce you've programmed it,
p104
aVyou simply upload it to the autopilot system,
p105
aVbring your drone to the field,
p106
aVand launch it simply by tossing it in the air.
p107
aVAnd often we'll go about this mission
p108
aVtaking pictures or videos along the way,
p109
aVand usually at that point,
p110
aVwe will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee,
p111
aVsit back, and relax for the next few minutes,
p112
aValthough some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes
p113
aVworrying that the drone will not return.
p114
aVUsually it does, and when it does,
p115
aVit even lands automatically.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo what can we do with a conservation drone?
p118
aVWell, when we built our first prototype drone,
p119
aVour main objective was to fly it over
p120
aVa remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,
p121
aVto look for the nest of a species of great ape
p122
aVknown as the orangutan.
p123
aVThe reason we wanted to do that was because
p124
aVwe needed to know how many individuals
p125
aVof this species are still left in that forest.
p126
aVNow the traditional method of surveying
p127
aVfor orangutans is to walk the forest on foot
p128
aVcarrying heavy equipment
p129
aVand to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops
p130
aVwhere you might find an orangutan or its nest.
p131
aVNow as you can imagine,
p132
aVthat is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,
p133
aVand costly process,
p134
aVso we were hoping that drones
p135
aVcould significantly reduce the cost of surveying
p136
aVfor orangutan populations in Indonesia
p137
aVand elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
p138
aVSo we were very excited when we captured
p139
aVour first pair of orangutan nests on camera.
p140
aVAnd this is it; this is the first ever picture
p141
aVof orangutan nests taken with a drone.
p142
aVSince then we have taken pictures
p143
aVof dozens of these nests
p144
aVfrom around various parts of Southeast Asia,
p145
aVand we're now working with computer scientists
p146
aVto develop algorithms that can automatically count
p147
aVthe number of nests from the thousands
p148
aVof photos we've collected so far.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut nests are not the only objects
p151
aVthese drones can detect.
p152
aVThis is a wild orangutan
p153
aVhappily feeding on top of a palm tree,
p154
aVseemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead,
p155
aVnot once but several times.
p156
aVWe've also taken pictures of other animals
p157
aVincluding forest buffalos in Gabon,
p158
aVelephants, and even turtle nests.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves,
p161
aVwe also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in,
p162
aVbecause we want to keep track
p163
aVof the health of these habitats.
p164
aVSometimes, we zoom out a little
p165
aVand look at other things that might be happening
p166
aVin the landscape.
p167
aVThis is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.
p168
aVNow oil palm is a major driver of deforestation
p169
aVin that part of the world,
p170
aVso we wanted to use this new drone technology
p171
aVto keep track of the spread of these plantations
p172
aVin Southeast Asia.
p173
aVBut drones could also be used to keep track of
p174
aVillegal logging activities.
p175
aVThis is a recently logged forest,
p176
aVagain in Sumatra.
p177
aVYou could even still see the processed
p178
aVwooden planks left on the ground.
p179
aa(lp180
VBut perhaps the most exciting part
p181
aVabout taking pictures from the air is
p182
aVwe could later stitch these pictures together
p183
aVusing special software to create a map
p184
aVof the entire landscape, and this map
p185
aVgives us crucial information
p186
aVfor monitoring land use change,
p187
aVto let us know where and when plantations might be expanding,
p188
aVwhere forests might be contracting,
p189
aVor where fires might be breaking out.
p190
aVAerial images could also be processed
p191
aVto produce three-dimensional
p192
aVcomputer models of forests.
p193
aVNow these models are not just visually appealing,
p194
aVbut they are also geometrically accurate,
p195
aVwhich means researchers can now measure
p196
aVthe distance between trees,
p197
aVcalculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,
p198
aVand so on, all of which are important information
p199
aVfor monitoring the health of these forests.
p200
aVRecently, we've also begun experimenting
p201
aVwith thermal imaging cameras.
p202
aVNow these cameras can detect
p203
aVheat-emitting objects from the ground,
p204
aVand therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo I've told you quite a lot about
p207
aVwhat conservation drones are,
p208
aVhow you might operate one of these drones,
p209
aVand what a drone could do for you.
p210
aVI will now tell you where conservation drones
p211
aVare being used around the world.
p212
aVWe built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.
p213
aVWe brought a few of these to Indonesia
p214
aVfor the first few test flights.
p215
aVSince then, we've been building drones
p216
aVfor our collaborators from around the world,
p217
aVand these include fellow biologists
p218
aVand partners from major conservation organizations.
p219
aa(lp220
VPerhaps the best and most rewarding part
p221
aVabout working with these collaborators
p222
aVis the feedback they give us
p223
aVon how to improve our drones.
p224
aVBuilding drones for us is
p225
aVa constant work in progress.
p226
aVWe are constantly trying to improve them in terms of
p227
aVtheir range, their ruggedness,
p228
aVand the amount of payload they can carry.
p229
aVWe also work with collaborators
p230
aVto discover new ways of using these drones.
p231
aVFor example, camera traps are a common tool
p232
aVused by biologists to take pictures of shy animals
p233
aVhiding in the forests,
p234
aVbut these are motion-activated cameras,
p235
aVso they snap a picture every time an animal
p236
aVcrosses their path.
p237
aVBut the problem with camera traps
p238
aVis that the researcher has to go back to the forest
p239
aVevery so often to retrieve those images,
p240
aVand that takes a lot of time,
p241
aVespecially if there are dozens
p242
aVor hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.
p243
aVNow a drone could be designed to perform the task
p244
aVmuch more efficiently.
p245
aVThis drone, carrying a special sensor,
p246
aVcould be flown over the forest
p247
aVand remotely download these images
p248
aVfrom wi-fi\u2013enabled cameras.
p249
aa(lp250
VRadio collars are another tool
p251
aVthat's commonly used by biologists.
p252
aVNow these collars are put onto animals.
p253
aVThey transmit a radio signal which allows
p254
aVthe researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape.
p255
aVBut the traditional way of tracking animals
p256
aVis pretty ridiculous,
p257
aVbecause it requires the researcher to be walking
p258
aVon the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna,
p259
aVnot unlike those old TV antennae we used to have
p260
aVon our rooftops. Some of us still do.
p261
aVA drone could be used to do the same job
p262
aVmuch more efficiently.
p263
aVWhy not equip a drone
p264
aVwith a scanning radio receiver,
p265
aVfly that over the forest canopy
p266
aVin a certain pattern
p267
aVwhich would allow the user or the operator
p268
aVto triangulate the location
p269
aVof these radio-collared animals remotely
p270
aVwithout having to step foot in the forest.
p271
aa(lp272
VA third and perhaps most exciting way
p273
aVof using these drones
p274
aVis to fly them to a really remote,
p275
aVnever-explored-before rainforest
p276
aVsomewhere hidden in the tropics,
p277
aVand parachute down a tiny spy microphone
p278
aVthat would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls
p279
aVof mammals, birds, amphibians,
p280
aVthe Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever.
p281
aVThat would give us biologists
p282
aVa pretty good idea of what animals
p283
aVmight be living in those forests.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd finally, I would like to show you
p286
aVthe latest version of our conservation drone.
p287
aVThe MAJA drone has a wingspan
p288
aVof about two meters.
p289
aVIt weighs only about two kilograms,
p290
aVbut it can carry half its weight.
p291
aVIt is a fully autonomous system.
p292
aVDuring its mission, it can even transmit
p293
aVa live video feed back to a ground station laptop,
p294
aVwhich allows the user
p295
aVto see what the drone is seeing in real time.
p296
aVIt carries a variety of sensors,
p297
aVand the photo quality of some of these sensors
p298
aVcan be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.
p299
aVThis drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes,
p300
aVwhich gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers.
p301
aVThat is quite sufficient for most
p302
aVof our conservation applications.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow, conservation drones began as
p305
aVa crazy idea from two biologists
p306
aVwho are just deeply passionate about this technology.
p307
aVAnd we believe, strongly believe,
p308
aVthat drones can and will be a game changer
p309
aVfor conservation research and applications.
p310
aVWe've had our fair share of skeptics and critics
p311
aVwho thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes.
p312
aVAnd in a way, they are right.
p313
aVI mean, let's be honest,
p314
aVdrones are the ultimate toys for boys.
p315
aVBut at the same time, we've also gotten to know
p316
aVmany wonderful colleagues and collaborators
p317
aVwho share our vision
p318
aVand see the potential of conservation drones.
p319
aVTo us, it is obvious that conservation biologists
p320
aVand practitioners should make full use
p321
aVof every available tool, including drones,
p322
aVin our fight to save the last remaining forests
p323
aVand wildlife of this planet.
p324
aa(lp325
VThank you.

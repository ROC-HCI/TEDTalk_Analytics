VI want to talk about the election.
p5
aVFor the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters
p6
aVvoted for an African-American candidate for President.
p7
aVAnd in fact Barack Obama did quite well.
p8
aVHe won 375 electoral votes.
p9
aVAnd he won about 70 million popular votes
p10
aVmore than any other presidential candidate \u2014
p11
aVof any race, of any party \u2014 in history.
p12
aVIf you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier \u2014
p13
aVDemocrats really like seeing this transition here,
p14
aVwhere almost every state becomes bluer, becomes more democratic \u2014
p15
aVeven states Obama lost, like out west,
p16
aVthose states became more blue.
p17
aVIn the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere
p18
aVbut with a couple of exceptions here and there.
p19
aa(lp20
VOne exception is in Massachusetts.
p21
aVThat was John Kerry's home state.
p22
aVNo big surprise, Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there.
p23
aVOr in Arizona, which is John McCain's home,
p24
aVObama didn't have much improvement.
p25
aVBut there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.
p26
aVThis kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.
p27
aVNow if you look at '96, Bill Clinton \u2014
p28
aVthe last Democrat to actually win \u2014 how he did in '96,
p29
aVyou see real big differences in this part of the country right here,
p30
aVthe kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it:
p31
aV20 or 30 point swings
p32
aVfrom how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did
p33
aVin 2008.
p34
aVYes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas, but these are very, very profound differences.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas, you know.
p37
aVThere is a book written called, "What's the Matter with Kansas?"
p38
aVBut really the question here \u2014 Obama did relatively well in Kansas.
p39
aVHe lost badly but every Democrat does.
p40
aVHe lost no worse than most people do.
p41
aVBut yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVAnd when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations.
p44
aVWe think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns.
p45
aVAnd we think people like this probably don't want to vote
p46
aVfor people who look like this and are named Barack Obama.
p47
aVWe think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?
p48
aVAre we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country?
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd the answer is: it is at least partially fair.
p51
aVWe know that race was a factor, and the reason why we know that
p52
aVis because we asked those people.
p53
aVActually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted
p54
aVexit polls in every state,
p55
aVin 37 states, out of the 50,
p56
aVthey asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race.
p57
aVThey asked this question.
p58
aVIn deciding your vote for President today, was the race
p59
aVof the candidate a factor?
p60
aVWe're looking for people that said, "Yes, race was a factor;
p61
aVmoreover it was an important factor, in my decision,"
p62
aVand people who voted for John McCain
p63
aVas a result of that factor,
p64
aVmaybe in combination with other factors, and maybe alone.
p65
aVWe're looking for this behavior among white voters
p66
aVor, really, non-black voters.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo you see big differences in different parts
p69
aVof the country on this question.
p70
aVIn Louisiana, about one in five white voters
p71
aVsaid, "Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama
p72
aVis because he was an African-American."
p73
aVIf those people had voted for Obama,
p74
aVeven half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely.
p75
aVSame is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list.
p76
aVMeanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened"
p77
aVbut you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this
p78
aVadmitted, I suppose,
p79
aVmanifestation of racially-based voting.
p80
aVHere is the same data on a map.
p81
aVYou kind of see the relationship between
p82
aVthe redder states of where more people responded and said,
p83
aV"Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."
p84
aVYou see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here.
p85
aVThis really seems to explain
p86
aVwhy Barack Obama did worse
p87
aVin this one part of the country.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo we have to ask why.
p90
aVIs racism predictable in some way?
p91
aVIs there something driving this?
p92
aVIs it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas
p93
aVthat we don't understand, and Kentucky?
p94
aVOr are there more systematic factors at work?
p95
aVAnd so we can look at a bunch of different variables.
p96
aVThese are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time \u2014
p97
aVthings like income, and religion, education.
p98
aVWhich of these seem to drive
p99
aVthis manifestation of racism
p100
aVin this big national experiment we had on November 4th?
p101
aVAnd there are a couple of these that have
p102
aVstrong predictive relationships,
p103
aVone of which is education,
p104
aVwhere you see the states with the fewest years of schooling
p105
aVper adult are in red,
p106
aVand you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region,
p107
aVis less educated. It's just a fact.
p108
aVAnd you see the relationship there
p109
aVwith the racially-based voting patterns.
p110
aVThe other variable that's important is
p111
aVthe type of neighborhood that you live in.
p112
aVStates that are more rural \u2014
p113
aVeven to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine \u2014
p114
aVthey exhibit a little bit of
p115
aVthis racially-based voting against Barack Obama.
p116
aVSo it's the combination of these two things: it's education
p117
aVand the type of neighbors that you have,
p118
aVwhich we'll talk about more in a moment.
p119
aVAnd the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee
p120
aVis that they're both very rural,
p121
aVand they are educationally impoverished.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo yes, racism is predictable.
p124
aVThese things, among maybe other variables,
p125
aVbut these things seem to predict it.
p126
aVWe're going to drill down a little bit more now,
p127
aVinto something called the General Social Survey.
p128
aVThis is conducted by the University of Chicago
p129
aVevery other year.
p130
aVAnd they ask a series of really interesting questions.
p131
aVIn 2000 they had particularly interesting questions
p132
aVabout racial attitudes.
p133
aVOne simple question they asked is,
p134
aV"Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood?"
p135
aVWe can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different.
p136
aVIn cites, about 80 percent of people
p137
aVhave someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race,
p138
aVbut in rural communities, only about 30 percent.
p139
aVProbably because if you live on a farm, you might not have a lot of neighbors, period.
p140
aVBut nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people
p141
aVwho are unlike you.
p142
aVSo what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey
p143
aVand split them between those who have black neighbors \u2014
p144
aVor, really, some neighbor of another race \u2014
p145
aVand people who have only white neighbors.
p146
aVAnd we see in some variables
p147
aVin terms of political attitudes, not a lot of difference.
p148
aVThis was eight years ago, some people were more Republican back then.
p149
aVBut you see Democrats versus Republican,
p150
aVnot a big difference based on who your neighbors are.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd even some questions about race \u2014 for example
p153
aVaffirmative action, which is kind of a political question,
p154
aVa policy question about race, if you will \u2014
p155
aVnot much difference here.
p156
aVAffirmative action is not very popular frankly, with white voters, period.
p157
aVBut people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods
p158
aVfeel no differently about it really.
p159
aVBut if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will,
p160
aV"Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?"
p161
aVThere is a big difference.
p162
aVPeople who don't have neighbors of a different race
p163
aVare about twice as likely
p164
aVto oppose interracial marriage as people who do.
p165
aVJust based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you.
p166
aVAnd likewise they asked, not in 2000, but in the same survey in 1996,
p167
aV"Would you not vote for a qualified black president?"
p168
aVYou see people without neighbors who are African-American who
p169
aVwere much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem."
p170
aa(lp171
VSo it's really not even about urban versus rural.
p172
aVIt's about who you live with.
p173
aVRacism is predictable. And it's predicted by
p174
aVinteraction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races.
p175
aVSo if you want to address it,
p176
aVthe goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.
p177
aVI have a couple of very obvious, I suppose,
p178
aVideas for maybe how to do that.
p179
aa(lp180
VI'm a big fan of cities.
p181
aVEspecially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable,
p182
aVand can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups.
p183
aVI think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking,
p184
aVthe kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis.
p185
aVBut also not everyone wants to live in a city, certainly not a city like New York.
p186
aVSo we can think more about things like street grids.
p187
aVThis is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing, Michigan.
p188
aVIt's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid.
p189
aVYou have real neighborhoods and real trees, and real streets you can walk on.
p190
aVAnd you interact a lot with your neighbors \u2014
p191
aVpeople you like, people you might not know.
p192
aVAnd as a result it's a very tolerant community,
p193
aVwhich is different, I think, than something like this,
p194
aVwhich is in Schaumburg, Illinois,
p195
aVwhere every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac
p196
aVand drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that.
p197
aVI think that actually this type of urban design,
p198
aVwhich became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s \u2014
p199
aVI think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming
p200
aVmore conservative under Ronald Reagan.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut also here is another idea we have \u2014
p203
aVis an intercollegiate exchange program
p204
aVwhere you have students going from New York abroad.
p205
aVBut frankly there are enough differences within the country now
p206
aVwhere maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU,
p207
aVhave them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas,
p208
aVand vice versa. Do it at the high school level.
p209
aVLiterally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee
p210
aVand might never interact in a positive affirmative way
p211
aVwith someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group.
p212
aVI think part of the education variable we talked about before
p213
aVis the networking experience you get when you go to college
p214
aVwhere you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut the point is, this is all good news,
p217
aVbecause when something is predictable,
p218
aVit is what I call designable.
p219
aVYou can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem,
p220
aVeven if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.
p221
aVIf we understand the root causes of the behavior
p222
aVand where it manifests itself and where it doesn't,
p223
aVwe can start to design solutions to it.
p224
aVSo that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.

habitforming political blog. Red and blue bar charts crowded the scrollbars as the pulse of exit polls crept along the site&#39;s latest projections. It seemed almost miraculous: In a year of acute turns of favor, the site&#39;s owner and mouthpiece, Nate Silver (who blogged anonymously as &quot;<a href=\\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/05/no-im-not-chuck-todd.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Poblano</a>&quot; until outing himself on May 30, 2008, as a baseball numberhead), managed to predict the winners of every U.S. Senate contest -- and the general Presidential election.</p><p>Besides being just-damn-fascinating, Silver&#39;s analysis is a decidedly contrarian gauntlet thrown before an unrepentant, spectacle-driven media. The up-and-coming pundit, who cut his teeth forecasting the performance of Major League Baseball players, has a fairly direct explanation of why most projections fail: &quot;Polls are cherry-picked based on their brand name or shock value rather than their track record of accuracy.&quot;</p><p>Silver&#39;s considerable smarts are already helping local campaigns build constituencies and strategize.

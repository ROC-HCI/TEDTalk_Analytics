VSo, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today
p5
aVimagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.
p6
aVBut before I do that,
p7
aVI need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,
p8
aVwhich require huge amounts of energy to create
p9
aVand, because of their disposal issues,
p10
aVare slowly poisoning our planet.
p11
aVI also want to tell you and share with you
p12
aVhow my team and I
p13
aVhave been using mushrooms over the last three years.
p14
aVNot like that. (Laughter)
p15
aVWe're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials,
p16
aVwhich perform a lot like plastics during their use,
p17
aVbut are made from crop waste
p18
aVand are totally compostable at the end of their lives.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Cheering)
p21
aa(lp22
VBut first,
p23
aVI need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders
p24
aVin the disposable plastics category.
p25
aVThis is a material you all know is Styrofoam,
p26
aVbut I like to think of it as toxic white stuff.
p27
aVIn a single cubic foot of this material \u2014
p28
aVabout what would come around your computer or large television \u2014
p29
aVyou have the same energy content
p30
aVof about a liter and a half of petrol.
p31
aVYet, after just a few weeks of use,
p32
aVyou'll throw this material in the trash.
p33
aVAnd this isn't just found in packaging.
p34
aV20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year,
p35
aVin everything from building materials to surfboards
p36
aVto coffee cups to table tops.
p37
aVAnd that's not the only place it's found.
p38
aVThe EPA estimates, in the United States,
p39
aVby volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills.
p40
aVEven worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment \u2014
p41
aVon the side of the road or next to a river.
p42
aVIf it's not picked up by a human, like me and you,
p43
aVit'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.
p44
aVPerhaps even worse
p45
aVis when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre,
p46
aVwhere these materials are being mechanically broken
p47
aVinto smaller and smaller bits,
p48
aVbut they're not really going away.
p49
aVThey're not biologically compatible.
p50
aVThey're basically fouling up
p51
aVEarth's respiratory and circulatory systems.
p52
aVAnd because these materials are so prolific,
p53
aVbecause they're found in so many places,
p54
aVthere's one other place you'll find this material, styrene,
p55
aVwhich is made from benzene, a known carcinogen.
p56
aVYou'll find it inside of you.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo, for all these reasons,
p59
aVI think we need better materials,
p60
aVand there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.
p61
aVThe first is feedstocks.
p62
aVToday, we use a single feedstock, petroleum,
p63
aVto heat our homes, power our cars
p64
aVand make most of the materials you see around you.
p65
aVWe recognize this is a finite resource,
p66
aVand it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash
p67
aVevery time you get a package.
p68
aVSecond of all, we should really strive to use far less energy
p69
aVin creating these materials.
p70
aVI say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it.
p71
aVWe should be talking about half, a quarter,
p72
aVone-tenth the energy content.
p73
aVAnd lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly,
p74
aVwe should be creating materials
p75
aVthat fit into what I call nature's recycling system.
p76
aVThis recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.
p77
aVI fit into it, you fit into it,
p78
aVand a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing.
p79
aVYet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday
p80
aVis going to last for thousands of years.
p81
aVThis is crazy.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut nature provides us with a really good model here.
p84
aVWhen a tree's done using its leaves \u2014
p85
aVits solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices \u2014
p86
aVat the end of a season,
p87
aVit doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center
p88
aVand have them melted down to form new leaves.
p89
aVIt just drops them, the shortest distance possible,
p90
aVto the forest floor,
p91
aVwhere they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.
p92
aVAnd this gets us back to the mushrooms.
p93
aVBecause in nature,
p94
aVmushrooms are the recycling system.
p95
aVAnd what we've discovered
p96
aVis, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen \u2014
p97
aVanalogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium \u2014
p98
aVwe can actually grow materials
p99
aVwith many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, mycelium is an amazing material,
p102
aVbecause it's a self-assembling material.
p103
aVIt actually takes things we would consider waste \u2014
p104
aVthings like seed husks or woody biomass \u2014
p105
aVand can transform them into a chitinous polymer,
p106
aVwhich you can form into almost any shape.
p107
aVIn our process,
p108
aVwe basically use it as a glue.
p109
aVAnd by using mycelium as a glue,
p110
aVyou can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry,
p111
aVand you can create materials with many different properties,
p112
aVmaterials that are insulating, fire-resistant,
p113
aVmoisture-resistant, vapor-resistant \u2014
p114
aVmaterials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.
p115
aVBut these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts,
p116
aVnot petroleum.
p117
aVAnd because they're made of natural materials,
p118
aVthey are 100 percent compostable
p119
aVin you own backyard.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo I'd like to share with you the four basic steps
p122
aVrequired to make these materials.
p123
aVThe first is selecting a feedstock,
p124
aVpreferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right \u2014
p125
aVlocal manufacturing.
p126
aVThe next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool,
p127
aVphysically filling an enclosure, a mold,
p128
aVin whatever shape you want to get.
p129
aVThen you actually grow the mycelium through these particles,
p130
aVand that's where the magic happens,
p131
aVbecause the organism is doing the work in this process,
p132
aVnot the equipment.
p133
aVThe final step is, of course, the product,
p134
aVwhether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block.
p135
aVOur vision is local manufacturing,
p136
aVlike the local food movement, for production.
p137
aVSo we've created formulations for all around the world
p138
aVusing regional byproducts.
p139
aVIf you're in China, you might use a rice husk
p140
aVor a cottonseed hull.
p141
aVIf you're in Northern Europe or North America,
p142
aVyou can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.
p143
aVWe then process these husks with some basic equipment.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd I want to share with you a quick video from our facility
p146
aVthat gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.
p147
aVSo what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case.
p148
aVIt's a waste product.
p149
aVAnd what they're doing in our equipment
p150
aVis going through a continuous system,
p151
aVwhich cleans, cooks, cools
p152
aVand pasteurizes these materials,
p153
aVwhile also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium.
p154
aVThis gives us a continuous stream of material
p155
aVthat we can put into almost any shape,
p156
aVthough today we're making corner blocks.
p157
aVAnd it's when this lid goes on the part,
p158
aVthat the magic really starts.
p159
aVBecause the manufacturing process is our organism.
p160
aVIt'll actually begin to digest these wastes
p161
aVand, over the next five days,
p162
aVassemble them into biocomposites.
p163
aVOur entire facility
p164
aVis comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools
p165
aVsitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials \u2014
p166
aVand everything from building materials
p167
aVto, in this case,
p168
aVa packaging corner block.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo I've said a number of times that we grow materials.
p171
aVAnd it's kind of hard to picture how that happens.
p172
aVSo my team has taken five days-worth of growth,
p173
aVa typical growth cycle for us,
p174
aVand condensed it into a 15-second time lapse.
p175
aVAnd I want you to really watch closely
p176
aVthese little white dots on the screen,
p177
aVbecause, over the five-day period,
p178
aVwhat they do is extend out and through this material,
p179
aVusing the energy that's contained in these seed husks
p180
aVto build this chitinous polymer matrix.
p181
aVThis matrix self-assembles,
p182
aVgrowing through and around the particles,
p183
aVmaking millions and millions of tiny fibers.
p184
aVAnd what parts of the seed husk we don't digest,
p185
aVactually become part of the final, physical composite.
p186
aVSo in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled.
p187
aVIt actually takes a little longer. It takes five days.
p188
aVBut it's much faster than conventional farming.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe last step, of course, is application.
p191
aVIn this case, we've grown a corner block.
p192
aVA major Fortune 500 furniture maker
p193
aVuses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment.
p194
aVThey used to use a plastic packaging buffer,
p195
aVbut we were able to give them the exact same physical performance
p196
aVwith our grown material.
p197
aVBest of all, when it gets to the customer,
p198
aVit's not trash.
p199
aVThey can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing,
p200
aVand it's going to improve the local soil.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo, why mycelium?
p203
aVThe first reason is local open feedstocks.
p204
aVYou want to be able to do this anywhere in the world
p205
aVand not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls,
p206
aVbecause you have multiple choices.
p207
aVThe next is self-assembly,
p208
aVbecause the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process.
p209
aVYou don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility.
p210
aVSo you can have lots of small facilities
p211
aVspread all across the world.
p212
aVBiological yield is really important.
p213
aVAnd because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product,
p214
aVeven the parts that aren't digested
p215
aVbecome part of the structure,
p216
aVwe're getting incredible yield rates.
p217
aa(lp218
VNatural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important,
p219
aVbecause these polymers have been tried and tested
p220
aVin our ecosystem for the last billion years,
p221
aVin everything from mushrooms to crustaceans.
p222
aVThey're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great.
p223
aVAnd while, today,
p224
aVwe can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging
p225
aVis going to be here in 10,000 years,
p226
aVwhat I want to guarantee
p227
aVis that in 10,000 years,
p228
aVour descendants, our children's children,
p229
aVwill be living happily and in harmony
p230
aVwith a healthy Earth.
p231
aVAnd I think that can be some really good news.
p232
aa(lp233
VThank you.

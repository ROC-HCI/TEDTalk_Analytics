VLet me share with you today an original discovery.
p5
aVBut I want to tell it to you the way it really happened \u2014
p6
aVnot the way I present it in a scientific meeting,
p7
aVor the way you'd read it in a scientific paper.
p8
aVIt's a story about beyond biomimetics,
p9
aVto something I'm calling biomutualism.
p10
aVI define that as an association between biology and another discipline,
p11
aVwhere each discipline reciprocally advances the other,
p12
aVbut where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.
p13
aVNow, in terms of biomimetics,
p14
aVas human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature,
p15
aVnature becomes a much more useful teacher.
p16
aVEngineering can be inspired by biology
p17
aVby using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous,
p18
aVbut then integrating that with the best human engineering,
p19
aVultimately to make something actually better than nature.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, being a biologist, I was very curious about this.
p22
aVThese are gecko toes.
p23
aVAnd we wondered how they use these bizarre toes
p24
aVto climb up a wall so quickly.
p25
aVWe discovered it. And what we found was
p26
aVthat they have leaf-like structures on their toes,
p27
aVwith millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug,
p28
aVand each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible:
p29
aVabout 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size.
p30
aVAnd the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends.
p31
aVThey don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue.
p32
aVThey actually stick by intermolecular forces alone,
p33
aVvan der Waals forces.
p34
aVAnd I'm really pleased to report to you today
p35
aVthat the first synthetic self-cleaning, dry adhesive has been made.
p36
aVFrom the simplest version in nature, one branch,
p37
aVmy engineering collaborator, Ron Fearing, at Berkeley,
p38
aVhad made the first synthetic version.
p39
aVAnd so has my other incredible collaborator,
p40
aVMark Cutkosky, at Stanford \u2014
p41
aVhe made much larger hairs than the gecko,
p42
aVbut used the same general principles.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd here is its first test.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVThat's Kellar Autumn, my former Ph.D. student,
p47
aVprofessor now at Lewis and Clark,
p48
aVliterally giving his first-born child up for this test.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VMore recently, this happened.
p52
aa(lp53
VMan: This the first time someone has actually climbed with it.
p54
aa(lp55
VNarrator: Lynn Verinsky, a professional climber,
p56
aVwho appeared to be brimming with confidence.
p57
aa(lp58
VLynn Verinsky: Honestly, it's going to be perfectly safe. It will be perfectly safe.
p59
aa(lp60
VMan: How do you know?
p61
aa(lp62
VLynn Verinsky: Because of liability insurance. (Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VNarrator: With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope,
p65
aVLynn began her 60-foot ascent.
p66
aVLynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing
p67
aVof Hollywood and science.
p68
aa(lp69
VMan: So you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko.
p70
aa(lp71
VLynn Verinsky: Ha! Wow. And what a privilege that has been.
p72
aa(lp73
VRobert Full: That's what she did on rough surfaces.
p74
aVBut she actually used these on smooth surfaces \u2014
p75
aVtwo of them \u2014 to climb up, and pull herself up.
p76
aVAnd you can try this in the lobby,
p77
aVand look at the gecko-inspired material.
p78
aVNow the problem with the robots doing this
p79
aVis that they can't get unstuck,
p80
aVwith the material.
p81
aVThis is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away
p82
aVfrom the surface, at high rates,
p83
aVas they run up the wall.
p84
aa(lp85
VWell I'm really excited today to show you
p86
aVthe newest version of a robot, Stickybot,
p87
aVusing a new hierarchical dry adhesive.
p88
aVHere is the actual robot.
p89
aVAnd here is what it does.
p90
aVAnd if you look,
p91
aVyou can see that it uses
p92
aVthe toe peeling,
p93
aVjust like the gecko does.
p94
aVIf we can show some of the video, you can see it climbing up the wall.
p95
aV(Applause)
p96
aVThere it is.
p97
aVAnd now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive
p98
aVthat the Stanford group was able to do
p99
aVin designing this incredible robot.
p100
aV(Applause)
p101
aa(lp102
VOh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.
p103
aVYou see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.
p104
aVIt has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature,
p105
aVthis kind of thing happens.
p106
aVThe engineers told us, for the climbing robots,
p107
aVthat, if they don't have a tail,
p108
aVthey fall off the wall.
p109
aVSo what they did was they asked us
p110
aVan important question.
p111
aVThey said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail."
p112
aVEven though we put a passive bar there.
p113
aV"Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls?"
p114
aVWhat they were doing was returning the favor,
p115
aVby giving us a hypothesis to test,
p116
aVin biology, that we wouldn't have thought of.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo of course, in reality, we were then panicked,
p119
aVbeing the biologists, and we should know this already.
p120
aVWe said, "Well, what do tails do?"
p121
aVWell we know that tails store fat, for example.
p122
aVWe know that you can grab onto things with them.
p123
aVAnd perhaps it is most well known
p124
aVthat they provide static balance.
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aVIt can also act as a counterbalance.
p127
aVSo watch this kangaroo.
p128
aVSee that tail? That's incredible!
p129
aVMarc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot.
p130
aVAnd it was unstable without its tail.
p131
aVNow mostly tails limit maneuverability,
p132
aVlike this human inside this dinosaur suit.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVMy colleagues actually went on to test this limitation,
p135
aVby increasing the moment of inertia of a student, so they had a tail,
p136
aVand running them through and obstacle course,
p137
aVand found a decrement in performance,
p138
aVlike you'd predict.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVBut of course, this is a passive tail.
p141
aVAnd you can also have active tails.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd when I went back to research this, I realized
p144
aVthat one of the great TED moments in the past,
p145
aVfrom Nathan,
p146
aVwe've talked about an active tail.
p147
aa(lp148
VVideo: Myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs
p149
aVwere interested in love, not war.
p150
aa(lp151
VRobert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication.
p152
aVIt can also be used in defense.
p153
aVPretty powerful.
p154
aVSo we then went back and looked at the animal.
p155
aVAnd we ran it up a surface.
p156
aVBut this time what we did is we put a slippery patch
p157
aVthat you see in yellow there.
p158
aVAnd watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail
p159
aVwhen it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.
p160
aVSo here is normal speed.
p161
aVAnd watch it now slip,
p162
aVand see what it does with its tail.
p163
aVIt has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg,
p164
aVand it contributes to stability.
p165
aVIf you make it slip a huge amount, this is what we discovered.
p166
aVThis is incredible.
p167
aVThe engineers had a really good idea.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd then of course we wondered,
p170
aVokay, they have an active tail, but let's picture them.
p171
aVThey're climbing up a wall, or a tree.
p172
aVAnd they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there.
p173
aVAnd what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf,
p174
aVand there was some wind, or we shook it?
p175
aVAnd we did that experiment, that you see here.
p176
aV(Applause)
p177
aVAnd this is what we discovered.
p178
aVNow that's real time. You can't see anything.
p179
aVBut there it is slowed down.
p180
aa(lp181
VWhat we discovered was the world's fastest air-righting response.
p182
aVFor those of you who remember your physics, that's a zero-angular-momentum
p183
aVrighting response. But it's like a cat.
p184
aVYou know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies.
p185
aVBut geckos do it better.
p186
aVAnd they do it with their tail.
p187
aVSo they do it with this active tail as they swing around.
p188
aVAnd then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture.
p189
aVOkay, now we wondered, if we were right,
p190
aVwe should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo for TED we actually built a robot,
p193
aVover there, a prototype, with the tail.
p194
aVAnd we're going to attempt the first air-righting response
p195
aVin a tail, with a robot.
p196
aVIf we could have the lights on it.
p197
aVOkay, there it goes.
p198
aVAnd show the video.
p199
aVThere it is.
p200
aVAnd it works just like it does in the animal.
p201
aVSo all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.
p202
aV(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, of course, we were normally frightened
p205
aVbecause the animal has no gliding adaptations,
p206
aVso we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.
p207
aVWe'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk,
p208
aVjust outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVSo we did. And here is what it does.
p211
aVSo the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times.
p212
aVIt does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.
p213
aVThis is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful,
p214
aVwhen you take a picture of it.
p215
aVAnd it's better than that, it \u2014 just in the slide \u2014 maneuvers in mid-air.
p216
aVAnd the way it does it, is it takes its tail
p217
aVand it swings it one way to yaw left, and it swings its other way to yaw right.
p218
aVSo we can maneuver this way.
p219
aVAnd then \u2014 we had to film this several times to believe this \u2014
p220
aVit also does this. Watch this.
p221
aVIt oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.
p222
aVIt can actually swim through the air.
p223
aVBut watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing?
p224
aVWhat does that mean for the origin of flapping flight?
p225
aVMaybe it's evolved from coming down from trees,
p226
aVand trying to control a glide.
p227
aVStay tuned for that.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VSo then we wondered, "Can they actually maneuver with this?"
p231
aVSo there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it
p232
aVwith these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.
p233
aVAnd it certainly looks like it.
p234
aVYou can see it even better from down on top.
p235
aVWatch the animal.
p236
aVDefinitely moving towards the landing target.
p237
aVWatch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that.
p238
aVIt's unbelievable.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo now we were really confused,
p241
aVbecause there are no reports of it gliding.
p242
aVSo we went, "Oh my god, we have to go to the field,
p243
aVand see if it actually does this."
p244
aVCompletely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film, of course.
p245
aVWe wondered, "Do they actually glide in nature?"
p246
aVWell we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia.
p247
aVAnd the next video you see is the first time we've showed this.
p248
aa(lp249
VThis is the actual video \u2014 not staged, a real research video \u2014
p250
aVof animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.
p251
aVLook at the end to see the animal.
p252
aVBut then as it gets closer to the tree,
p253
aVlook at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.
p254
aVSo there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.
p255
aVYou see it there? There? Watch it come down.
p256
aVNow watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit?
p257
aVIt actually uses its tail too,
p258
aVjust like we saw in the lab.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo now we can continue this mutualism
p261
aVby suggesting that they can make an active tail.
p262
aVAnd here is the first active tail, in the robot,
p263
aVmade by Boston Dynamics.
p264
aVSo to conclude, I think we need to build biomutualisms, like I showed,
p265
aVthat will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application.
p266
aVTo do this though, we need to redesign education in a major way,
p267
aVto balance depth with interdisciplinary communication,
p268
aVand explicitly train people how to contribute to, and benefit from other disciplines.
p269
aVAnd of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.
p270
aVThat is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health,
p271
aVwe must preserve nature's designs,
p272
aVotherwise these secrets will be lost forever.
p273
aVAnd from what I heard from our new president,
p274
aVI'm very optimistic. Thank you.
p275
aV(Applause)

He founded <a href=\\"http://ciber.berkeley.edu/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">CiBER</a>, the Center for interdisciplinary&nbsp;Bio-inspiration in&nbsp;Education and Research, and the <a href=\\"http://polypedal.berkeley.edu/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Poly-PEDAL Laboratory</a>, which studies the&nbsp;Performance, Energetics and Dynamics of&nbsp;Animal Locomotion (PEDAL) in&nbsp;many-footed creatures (Poly). </p><p>His research shows how studying a diversity of&nbsp;animals leads to the discovery of&nbsp;general principles which inspire the design&nbsp;of novel circuits, artificial muscles, exoskeletons, versatile scampering legged search-and-rescue&nbsp;robots and&nbsp;synthetic self-cleaning dry adhesives based on gecko feet.

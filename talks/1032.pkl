VNow I'm going to give you a story.
p5
aVIt's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.
p6
aVLet me begin with my parents.
p7
aVI'm a product of this
p8
aVvisionary mother and father.
p9
aVMany years ago, when I was born in the '50s \u2014
p10
aV'50s and '60s
p11
aVdidn't belong to girls in India.
p12
aVThey belonged to boys.
p13
aVThey belonged to boys who would join business
p14
aVand inherit business from parents,
p15
aVand girls would be dolled up to get married.
p16
aVMy family, in my city,
p17
aVand almost in the country, was unique.
p18
aVWe were four of us, not one,
p19
aVand fortunately no boys.
p20
aVWe were four girls and no boys.
p21
aVAnd my parents were part
p22
aVof a landed property family.
p23
aVMy father defied his own grandfather,
p24
aValmost to the point of disinheritance,
p25
aVbecause he decided to educate
p26
aVall four of us.
p27
aVHe sent us to one of the best schools in the city
p28
aVand gave us the best education.
p29
aVAs I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents,
p30
aVand when we go to school, we don't choose our school.
p31
aVChildren don't choose a school.
p32
aVThey just get the school which parents choose for them.
p33
aVSo this is the foundation time which I got.
p34
aVI grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.
p35
aVAnd my father used to say at that time,
p36
aV"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world."
p37
aVI don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened.
p38
aVI'm the only one who's left in India.
p39
aVOne is a British, another is an American
p40
aVand the third is a Canadian.
p41
aVSo we are four of us in four corners of the world.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd since I said they're my role models,
p44
aVI followed two things which my father and mother gave me.
p45
aVOne, they said, "Life is on an incline.
p46
aVYou either go up,
p47
aVor you come down."
p48
aVAnd the second thing, which has stayed with me,
p49
aVwhich became my philosophy of life,
p50
aVwhich made all the difference,
p51
aVis: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.
p52
aVOut of 100, 90 are your creation.
p53
aVThey're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it.
p54
aVIf they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it.
p55
aVTen are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.
p56
aVIt's like a death of a relative,
p57
aVor a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.
p58
aVYou can't do a thing about it.
p59
aVYou've got to just respond to the situation.
p60
aVBut that response comes out of those 90 points.
p61
aVSince I'm a product of this philosophy,
p62
aVof 90/10,
p63
aVand secondly, "life on an incline,"
p64
aVthat's the way I grew up
p65
aVto be valuing what I got.
p66
aVI'm a product of opportunities,
p67
aVrare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s,
p68
aVwhich girls didn't get,
p69
aVand I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me
p70
aVwas something unique.
p71
aVBecause all of my best school friends were getting dolled up
p72
aVto get married with a lot of dowry,
p73
aVand here I was with a tennis racket and going to school
p74
aVand doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.
p75
aVI thought I must tell you this.
p76
aVWhy I said this, is the background.
p77
aa(lp78
VThis is what comes next.
p79
aVI joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman,
p80
aVa woman with indefatigable stamina,
p81
aVbecause I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.
p82
aVBut I joined the Indian Police Service,
p83
aVand then it was a new pattern of policing.
p84
aVFor me the policing stood for power to correct,
p85
aVpower to prevent and power to detect.
p86
aVThis is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India \u2014
p87
aVthe power to prevent.
p88
aVBecause normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it,
p89
aVor power to punish.
p90
aVBut I decided no, it's a power to prevent,
p91
aVbecause that's what I learned when I was growing up.
p92
aVHow do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?
p93
aVSo this was how it came into my service,
p94
aVand it was different from the men.
p95
aVI didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different,
p96
aVbecause this was the way I was different.
p97
aVAnd I redefined policing concepts in India.
p98
aVI'm going to take you on two journeys,
p99
aVmy policing journey and my prison journey.
p100
aVWhat you see, if you see the title
p101
aVcalled "PM's car held."
p102
aVThis was the first time a prime minister of India
p103
aVwas given a parking ticket.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVThat's the first time in India,
p106
aVand I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.
p107
aVIt'll never happen again in India,
p108
aVbecause now it was once and forever.
p109
aVAnd the rule was, because I was sensitive,
p110
aVI was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice,
p111
aVand I was very pro-justice.
p112
aVThat's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.
p113
aVI had other options, but I didn't choose them.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo I'm going to move on.
p116
aVThis is about tough policing, equal policing.
p117
aVNow I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen."
p118
aVSo I was sent to all indiscriminate postings,
p119
aVpostings which others would say no.
p120
aVI now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.
p121
aVNormally police officers don't want to do prison.
p122
aVThey sent me to prison to lock me up,
p123
aVthinking, "Now there will be no cars
p124
aVand no VIPs to be given tickets to.
p125
aVLet's lock her up."
p126
aVHere I got a prison assignment.
p127
aVThis was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.
p128
aVObviously, it was.
p129
aVBut 10,000 men,
p130
aVof which only 400 were women \u2014 10,000 \u2014
p131
aV9,000 plus about 600
p132
aVwere men.
p133
aVTerrorists, rapists,
p134
aVburglars, gangsters \u2014
p135
aVsome of them I'd sent to jail
p136
aVas a police officer outside.
p137
aVAnd then how did I deal with them?
p138
aVThe first day when I went in,
p139
aVI didn't know how to look at them.
p140
aVAnd I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?"
p141
aVThey saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.
p142
aVI said, "Do you pray?"
p143
aVAnd they didn't say anything.
p144
aVI said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?"
p145
aVThey said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray."
p146
aVI prayed for them, and things started to change.
p147
aVThis is a visual of education inside the prison.
p148
aa(lp149
VFriends, this has never happened,
p150
aVwhere everybody in the prison studies.
p151
aVI started this with community support.
p152
aVGovernment had no budget.
p153
aVIt was one of the finest, largest volunteerism
p154
aVin any prison in the world.
p155
aVThis was initiated in Delhi prison.
p156
aVYou see one sample
p157
aVof a prisoner teaching a class.
p158
aVThese are hundreds of classes.
p159
aVNine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program \u2014
p160
aVthe same den in which they thought
p161
aVthey would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.
p162
aVWe converted this into an ashram \u2014
p163
aVfrom a prison to an ashram through education.
p164
aVI think that's the bigger change.
p165
aVIt was the beginning of a change.
p166
aVTeachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.
p167
aVBooks came from donated schoolbooks.
p168
aVStationery was donated.
p169
aVEverything was donated,
p170
aVbecause there was no budget of education for the prison.
p171
aVNow if I'd not done that,
p172
aVit would have been a hellhole.
p173
aa(lp174
VThat's the second landmark.
p175
aVI want to show you some moments of history in my journey,
p176
aVwhich probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.
p177
aVOne, the numbers you'll never get to see.
p178
aVSecondly, this concept.
p179
aVThis was a meditation program inside the prison
p180
aVof over 1,000 prisoners.
p181
aVOne thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.
p182
aVThis was one of the most courageous steps
p183
aVI took as a prison governor.
p184
aVAnd this is what transformed.
p185
aVYou want to know more about this,
p186
aVgo and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana."
p187
aVYou will hear about it, and you will love it.
p188
aVAnd write to me on KiranBedi.com,
p189
aVand I'll respond to you.
p190
aVLet me show you the next slide.
p191
aVI took the same concept of mindfulness,
p192
aVbecause, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?
p193
aVBecause crime is a product of a distorted mind.
p194
aVIt was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.
p195
aVNot by preaching, not by telling,
p196
aVnot by reading, but by addressing your mind.
p197
aVI took the same thing to the police,
p198
aVbecause police, equally, were prisoners of their minds,
p199
aVand they felt as if it was "we" and "they,"
p200
aVand that the people don't cooperate.
p201
aVThis worked.
p202
aa(lp203
VThis is a feedback box called a petition box.
p204
aVThis is a concept which I introduced
p205
aVto listen to complaints, listen to grievances.
p206
aVThis was a magic box.
p207
aVThis was a sensitive box.
p208
aVThis is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.
p209
aVIf you see somebody in the blue \u2014
p210
aVyeah, this guy \u2014
p211
aVhe was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.
p212
aVAnd you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.
p213
aa(lp214
VLet me wrap it up.
p215
aVI'm currently into movements,
p216
aVmovements of education
p217
aVof the under-served children,
p218
aVwhich is thousands \u2014 India is all about thousands.
p219
aVSecondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.
p220
aVThat's a big way
p221
aVwe, as a small group of activists,
p222
aVhave drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.
p223
aVFriends, you will hear a lot about it.
p224
aVThat's the movement at the moment I'm driving,
p225
aVand that's the movement and ambition of my life.
p226
aa(lp227
VThank you very much.
p228
aV(Applause)
p229
aVThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
p230
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you.

VIf you are a blind child in India,
p5
aVyou will very likely have to contend with
p6
aVat least two big pieces of bad news.
p7
aVThe first bad news
p8
aVis that the chances of getting treatment
p9
aVare extremely slim to none,
p10
aVand that's because most of the blindness
p11
aValleviation programs in the country
p12
aVare focused on adults,
p13
aVand there are very, very few hospitals
p14
aVthat are actually equipped to treat children.
p15
aVIn fact, if you were to be treated,
p16
aVyou might well end up being treated
p17
aVby a person who has no medical credentials
p18
aVas this case from Rajasthan illustrates.
p19
aVThis is a three-year-old orphan girl
p20
aVwho had cataracts.
p21
aVSo, her caretakers took her
p22
aVto the village medicine man,
p23
aVand instead of suggesting to the caretakers
p24
aVthat the girl be taken to a hospital,
p25
aVthe person decided to burn her abdomen
p26
aVwith red-hot iron bars
p27
aVto drive out the demons.
p28
aVThe second piece of bad news
p29
aVwill be delivered to you
p30
aVby neuroscientists, who will tell you
p31
aVthat if you are older than four or five years of age,
p32
aVthat even if you have your eye corrected,
p33
aVthe chances of your brain learning how to see
p34
aVare very, very slim \u2014
p35
aVagain, slim or none.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo when I heard these two things,
p38
aVit troubled me deeply,
p39
aVboth because of personal reasons
p40
aVand scientific reasons.
p41
aVSo let me first start with the personal reason.
p42
aVIt'll sound corny, but it's sincere.
p43
aVThat's my son, Darius.
p44
aVAs a new father,
p45
aVI have a qualitatively different sense
p46
aVof just how delicate babies are,
p47
aVwhat our obligations are towards them
p48
aVand how much love
p49
aVwe can feel towards a child.
p50
aVI would move heaven and earth
p51
aVin order to get treatment for Darius,
p52
aVand for me to be told
p53
aVthat there might be other Dariuses
p54
aVwho are not getting treatment,
p55
aVthat's just viscerally wrong.
p56
aVSo that's the personal reason.
p57
aa(lp58
VScientific reason is that this notion
p59
aVfrom neuroscience of critical periods \u2014
p60
aVthat if the brain is older
p61
aVthan four or five years of age,
p62
aVit loses its ability to learn \u2014
p63
aVthat doesn't sit well with me,
p64
aVbecause I don't think that idea
p65
aVhas been tested adequately.
p66
aVThe birth of the idea is from
p67
aVDavid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work,
p68
aVtwo researchers who were at Harvard,
p69
aVand they got the Nobel Prize in 1981
p70
aVfor their studies of visual physiology,
p71
aVwhich are remarkably beautiful studies,
p72
aVbut I believe some of their work
p73
aVhas been extrapolated
p74
aVinto the human domain prematurely.
p75
aVSo, they did their work with kittens,
p76
aVwith different kinds of deprivation regiments,
p77
aVand those studies,
p78
aVwhich date back to the '60s,
p79
aVare now being applied to human children.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo I felt that I needed to do two things.
p82
aVOne: provide care
p83
aVto children who are currently
p84
aVbeing deprived of treatment.
p85
aVThat's the humanitarian mission.
p86
aVAnd the scientific mission would be
p87
aVto test the limits
p88
aVof visual plasticity.
p89
aVAnd these two missions, as you can tell,
p90
aVthread together perfectly. One adds to the other;
p91
aVin fact, one would be impossible without the other.
p92
aVSo, to implement
p93
aVthese twin missions,
p94
aVa few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.
p95
aVPrakash, as many of you know,
p96
aVis the Sanskrit word for light,
p97
aVand the idea is that
p98
aVin bringing light into the lives of children,
p99
aVwe also have a chance
p100
aVof shedding light on some of the
p101
aVdeepest mysteries of neuroscience.
p102
aVAnd the logo \u2014 even though it looks extremely Irish,
p103
aVit's actually derived from
p104
aVthe Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.
p105
aVThe Prakash, the overall effort
p106
aVhas three components:
p107
aVoutreach, to identify children in need of care;
p108
aVmedical treatment; and in subsequent study.
p109
aVAnd I want to show you a short video clip
p110
aVthat illustrates the first two components of this work.
p111
aa(lp112
VThis is an outreach station
p113
aVconducted at a school for the blind.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Text: Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ...)
p116
aa(lp117
VPawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind,
p118
aVmany children have permanent conditions.
p119
aVThat's a case of microphthalmos,
p120
aVwhich is malformed eyes,
p121
aVand that's a permanent condition;
p122
aVit cannot be treated.
p123
aVThat's an extreme of micropthalmos
p124
aVcalled enophthalmos.
p125
aVBut, every so often, we come across children
p126
aVwho show some residual vision,
p127
aVand that is a very good sign
p128
aVthat the condition might actually be treatable.
p129
aVSo, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.
p130
aVThat's the hospital we're working with in Delhi,
p131
aVthe Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.
p132
aVIt has a very well-equipped
p133
aVpediatric ophthalmic center,
p134
aVwhich was made possible in part
p135
aVby a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.
p136
aVSo, eating burgers actually helps.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Text: Such examinations allow us to improve
p139
aVeye-health in many children, and ...
p140
aV... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.)
p141
aa(lp142
VPS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child,
p143
aVyou will see the cause of his blindness.
p144
aVThe whites that you see in the middle of his pupils
p145
aVare congenital cataracts,
p146
aVso opacities of the lens.
p147
aVIn our eyes, the lens is clear,
p148
aVbut in this child, the lens has become opaque,
p149
aVand therefore he can't see the world.
p150
aVSo, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye.
p151
aVHere's the eye with the opaque lens,
p152
aVthe opaque lens extracted
p153
aVand an acrylic lens inserted.
p154
aVAnd here's the same child
p155
aVthree weeks post-operation,
p156
aVwith the right eye open.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VThank you.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense
p163
aVthat recovery is possible,
p164
aVand we have now
p165
aVprovided treatment to over 200 children,
p166
aVand the story repeats itself.
p167
aVAfter treatment, the child
p168
aVgains significant functionality.
p169
aVIn fact, the story holds true
p170
aVeven if you have a person who got sight
p171
aVafter several years of deprivation.
p172
aVWe did a paper a few years ago
p173
aVabout this woman that you see on the right, SRD,
p174
aVand she got her sight late in life,
p175
aVand her vision is remarkable at this age.
p176
aVI should add a tragic postscript to this \u2014
p177
aVshe died two years ago
p178
aVin a bus accident.
p179
aVSo, hers is just a truly inspiring story \u2014
p180
aVunknown, but inspiring story.
p181
aVSo when we started finding these results,
p182
aVas you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir
p183
aVin the scientific and the popular press.
p184
aVHere's an article in Nature
p185
aVthat profiled this work,
p186
aVand another one in Time.
p187
aVSo, we were fairly convinced \u2014 we are convinced \u2014
p188
aVthat recovery is feasible,
p189
aVdespite extended visual deprivation.
p190
aa(lp191
VThe next obvious question to ask:
p192
aVWhat is the process of recovery?
p193
aVSo, the way we study that is,
p194
aVlet's say we find a child who has light sensitivity.
p195
aVThe child is provided treatment,
p196
aVand I want to stress that the treatment
p197
aVis completely unconditional;
p198
aVthere is no quid pro quo.
p199
aVWe treat many more children then we actually work with.
p200
aVEvery child who needs treatment is treated.
p201
aVAfter treatment, about every week,
p202
aVwe run the child
p203
aVon a battery of simple visual tests
p204
aVin order to see how their visual skills
p205
aVare coming on line.
p206
aVAnd we try to do this for as long as possible.
p207
aVThis arc of development
p208
aVgives us unprecedented
p209
aVand extremely valuable information
p210
aVabout how the scaffolding of vision
p211
aVgets set up.
p212
aVWhat might be the causal connections
p213
aVbetween the early developing skills
p214
aVand the later developing ones?
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd we've used this general approach to study
p217
aVmany different visual proficiencies,
p218
aVbut I want to highlight one particular one,
p219
aVand that is image parsing into objects.
p220
aVSo, any image of the kind that you see on the left,
p221
aVbe it a real image or a synthetic image,
p222
aVit's made up of little regions
p223
aVthat you see in the middle column,
p224
aVregions of different colors, different luminances.
p225
aVThe brain has this complex task
p226
aVof putting together, integrating,
p227
aVsubsets of these regions
p228
aVinto something that's more meaningful,
p229
aVinto what we would consider to be objects,
p230
aVas you see on the right.
p231
aVAnd nobody knows how this integration happens,
p232
aVand that's the question we asked with Project Prakash.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo, here's what happens
p235
aVvery soon after the onset of sight.
p236
aVHere's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago,
p237
aVand you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT,
p238
aVrunning the experiment with him.
p239
aVHis visual-motor coordination is quite poor,
p240
aVbut you get a general sense
p241
aVof what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.
p242
aVIf you show him real world images,
p243
aVif you show others like him real world images,
p244
aVthey are unable to recognize most of the objects
p245
aVbecause the world to them is over-fragmented;
p246
aVit's made up of a collage, a patchwork,
p247
aVof regions of different colors and luminances.
p248
aVAnd that's what's indicated in the green outlines.
p249
aVWhen you ask them,
p250
aV"Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are,"
p251
aVthese are the regions that they point to.
p252
aVSo the world is this complex
p253
aVpatchwork of regions.
p254
aVEven the shadow on the ball
p255
aVbecomes its own object.
p256
aVInterestingly enough,
p257
aVyou give them a few months,
p258
aVand this is what happens.
p259
aa(lp260
VDoctor: How many are these?
p261
aa(lp262
VPatient: These are two things.
p263
aa(lp264
VDoctor: What are their shapes?
p265
aa(lp266
VPatient: Their shapes ...
p267
aVThis one is a circle,
p268
aVand this
p269
aVis a square.
p270
aa(lp271
VPS: A very dramatic transformation has come about.
p272
aVAnd the question is:
p273
aVWhat underlies this transformation?
p274
aVIt's a profound question,
p275
aVand what's even more amazing is how simple
p276
aVthe answer is.
p277
aVThe answer lies in motion
p278
aVand that's what I want to show you in the next clip.
p279
aa(lp280
VDoctor: What shape do you see here?
p281
aa(lp282
VPatient: I can't make it out.
p283
aa(lp284
VDoctor: Now?
p285
aa(lp286
VPatient: Triangle.
p287
aa(lp288
VDoctor: How many things are these?
p289
aVNow, how many things are these?
p290
aa(lp291
VPatient: Two.
p292
aa(lp293
VDoctor: What are these things?
p294
aa(lp295
VPatient: A square and a circle.
p296
aa(lp297
VPS: And we see this pattern over and over again.
p298
aVThe one thing the visual system needs
p299
aVin order to begin parsing the world
p300
aVis dynamic information.
p301
aVSo the inference we are deriving from this,
p302
aVand several such experiments,
p303
aVis that dynamic information processing,
p304
aVor motion processing,
p305
aVserves as the bedrock for building
p306
aVthe rest of the complexity of visual processing;
p307
aVit leads to visual integration
p308
aVand eventually to recognition.
p309
aa(lp310
VThis simple idea has far reaching implications.
p311
aVAnd let me just quickly mention two,
p312
aVone, drawing from the domain of engineering,
p313
aVand one from the clinic.
p314
aVSo, from the perspective of engineering,
p315
aVwe can ask: Goven that we know
p316
aVthat motion is so important for the human visual system,
p317
aVcan we use this as a recipe
p318
aVfor constructing machine-based vision systems
p319
aVthat can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed
p320
aVby a human programmer?
p321
aVAnd that's what we're trying to do.
p322
aa(lp323
VI'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply
p324
aVwhatever basic knowledge you gain.
p325
aVSo we are creating Dylan,
p326
aVwhich is a computational system
p327
aVwith an ambitious goal
p328
aVof taking in visual inputs
p329
aVof the same kind that a human child would receive,
p330
aVand autonomously discovering:
p331
aVWhat are the objects in this visual input?
p332
aVSo, don't worry about the internals of Dylan.
p333
aVHere, I'm just going to talk about
p334
aVhow we test Dylan.
p335
aVThe way we test Dylan is by giving it
p336
aVinputs, as I said, of the same kind
p337
aVthat a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.
p338
aVBut for a long time we couldn't quite figure out:
p339
aVWow can we get these kinds of video inputs?
p340
aVSo, I thought,
p341
aVcould we have Darius
p342
aVserve as our babycam carrier,
p343
aVand that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?
p344
aVSo that's what we did.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aVI had to have long conversations with my wife.
p347
aV(Laughter)
p348
aVIn fact, Pam, if you're watching this,
p349
aVplease forgive me.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo, we modified the optics of the camera
p352
aVin order to mimic the baby's visual acuity.
p353
aVAs some of you might know,
p354
aVbabyies are born pretty much legally blind.
p355
aVTheir acuity \u2014 our acuity is 20/20;
p356
aVbabies' acuity is like 20/800,
p357
aVso they are looking at the world
p358
aVin a very, very blurry fashion.
p359
aVHere's what a baby-cam video looks like.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aV(Applause)
p363
aa(lp364
VThankfully, there isn't any audio
p365
aVto go with this.
p366
aVWhat's amazing is that working with such
p367
aVhighly degraded input,
p368
aVthe baby, very quickly, is able
p369
aVto discover meaning in such input.
p370
aVBut then two or three days afterward,
p371
aVbabies begin to pay attention
p372
aVto their mother's or their father's face.
p373
aVHow does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that,
p374
aVand using this mantra of motion,
p375
aVDylan actually can do that.
p376
aVSo, given that kind of video input,
p377
aVwith just about six or seven minutes worth of video,
p378
aVDylan can begin to extract patterns
p379
aVthat include faces.
p380
aVSo, it's an important demonstration
p381
aVof the power of motion.
p382
aa(lp383
VThe clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.
p384
aVVisual integration has been associated with autism
p385
aVby several researchers.
p386
aVWhen we saw that, we asked:
p387
aVCould the impairment in visual integration
p388
aVbe the manifestation of something underneath,
p389
aVof dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?
p390
aVBecause, if that hypothesis were to be true,
p391
aVit would have massive repercussions in our understanding
p392
aVof what's causing the many different aspects
p393
aVof the autism phenotype.
p394
aa(lp395
VWhat you're going to see are
p396
aVvideo clips of two children \u2014 one neurotypical,
p397
aVone with autism, playing Pong.
p398
aVSo, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking.
p399
aVIn red are the eye movement traces.
p400
aVThis is the neurotypical child, and what you see
p401
aVis that the child is able to make cues
p402
aVof the dynamic information
p403
aVto predict where the ball is going to go.
p404
aVEven before the ball gets to a place,
p405
aVthe child is already looking there.
p406
aVContrast this with a child
p407
aVwith autism playing the same game.
p408
aVInstead of anticipating,
p409
aVthe child always follows where the ball has been.
p410
aVThe efficiency of the use
p411
aVof dynamic information
p412
aVseems to be significantly compromised in autism.
p413
aVSo we are pursuing this line of work
p414
aVand hopefully we'll have
p415
aVmore results to report soon.
p416
aa(lp417
VLooking ahead, if you think of this disk
p418
aVas representing all of the children
p419
aVwe've treated so far,
p420
aVthis is the magnitude of the problem.
p421
aVThe red dots are the children we have not treated.
p422
aVSo, there are many, many more children who need to be treated,
p423
aVand in order to expand the scope of the project,
p424
aVwe are planning on launching
p425
aVThe Prakash Center for Children,
p426
aVwhich will have a dedicated pediatric hospital,
p427
aVa school for the children we are treating
p428
aVand also a cutting-edge research facility.
p429
aVThe Prakash Center will integrate health care,
p430
aVeducation and research in a way
p431
aVthat truly creates the whole
p432
aVto be greater than the sum of the parts.
p433
aa(lp434
VSo, to summarize: Prakash, in its five years of existence,
p435
aVit's had an impact in multiple areas,
p436
aVranging from basic neuroscience
p437
aVplasticity and learning in the brain,
p438
aVto clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism,
p439
aVthe development of autonomous machine vision systems,
p440
aVeducation of the undergraduate and graduate students,
p441
aVand most importantly in the alleviation
p442
aVof childhood blindness.
p443
aVAnd for my students and I, it's been
p444
aVjust a phenomenal experience
p445
aVbecause we have gotten to do interesting research,
p446
aVwhile at the same time
p447
aVhelping the many children that we have worked with.
p448
aa(lp449
VThank you very much.

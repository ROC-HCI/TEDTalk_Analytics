VThe oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet.
p5
aVAnd I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right
p6
aVwhen he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet
p7
aVPlanet Ocean.
p8
aVAnd the oceans are hugely productive,
p9
aVas you can see by the satellite image
p10
aVof photosynthesis, the production of new life.
p11
aVIn fact, the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth
p12
aVas well as about half the oxygen that we breathe.
p13
aVIn addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth,
p14
aVand much of it we don't know about.
p15
aVBut I'll tell you some of that today.
p16
aVThat also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction
p17
aVthat we do from the ocean.
p18
aVThat's about 10 percent of our global needs
p19
aVand 100 percent of some island nations.
p20
aa(lp21
VIf you were to descend
p22
aVinto the 95 percent of the biosphere that's livable,
p23
aVit would quickly become pitch black,
p24
aVinterrupted only by pinpoints of light
p25
aVfrom bioluminescent organisms.
p26
aVAnd if you turn the lights on,
p27
aVyou might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by,
p28
aVbecause those are the denizens of the deep,
p29
aVthe things that live in the deep ocean.
p30
aVAnd eventually, the deep sea floor would come into view.
p31
aVThis type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface
p32
aVthan all other habitats combined.
p33
aVAnd yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars
p34
aVthan we do about this habitat,
p35
aVdespite the fact that we have yet to extract
p36
aVa gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water
p37
aVfrom those bodies.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd so 10 years ago,
p40
aVan international program began called the Census of Marine Life,
p41
aVwhich set out to try and improve our understanding
p42
aVof life in the global oceans.
p43
aVIt involved 17 different projects around the world.
p44
aVAs you can see, these are the footprints of the different projects.
p45
aVAnd I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage
p46
aVthat it managed to achieve.
p47
aVIt all began when two scientists, Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel,
p48
aVmet in Woods Hole, Massachusetts
p49
aVwhere both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute.
p50
aVAnd Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity
p51
aVand the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it.
p52
aVWell, from that discussion grew this program
p53
aVthat involved 2,700 scientists
p54
aVfrom more than 80 countries around the world
p55
aVwho engaged in 540 ocean expeditions
p56
aVat a combined cost of 650 million dollars
p57
aVto study the distribution, diversity and abundance
p58
aVof life in the global ocean.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd so what did we find?
p61
aVWe found spectacular new species,
p62
aVthe most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked \u2014
p63
aVfrom the shoreline to the abyss,
p64
aVform microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between.
p65
aVAnd the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life,
p66
aVbut rather the taxonomic specialists
p67
aVwho can identify and catalog these species
p68
aVthat became the limiting step.
p69
aVThey, in fact, are an endangered species themselves.
p70
aVThere are actually four to five new species
p71
aVdescribed everyday for the oceans.
p72
aVAnd as I say, it could be a much larger number.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, I come from Newfoundland in Canada \u2014
p75
aVIt's an island off the east coast of that continent \u2014
p76
aVwhere we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters
p77
aVin human history.
p78
aVAnd so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish.
p79
aVIt's around 1900.
p80
aVNow, when I was a boy of about his age,
p81
aVI would go out fishing with my grandfather
p82
aVand we would catch fish about half that size.
p83
aVAnd I thought that was the norm,
p84
aVbecause I had never seen fish like this.
p85
aVIf you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed,
p86
aVif you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge,
p87
aVit would be half that size still.
p88
aVSo what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines.
p89
aVOur expectations of what the oceans can produce
p90
aVis something that we don't really appreciate
p91
aVbecause we haven't seen it in our lifetimes.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow most of us, and I would say me included,
p94
aVthink that human exploitation of the oceans
p95
aVreally only became very serious
p96
aVin the last 50 to, perhaps, 100 years or so.
p97
aVThe census actually tried to look back in time,
p98
aVusing every source of information they could get their hands on.
p99
aVAnd so anything from restaurant menus
p100
aVto monastery records to ships' logs
p101
aVto see what the oceans looked like.
p102
aVBecause science data really goes back
p103
aVto, at best, World War II, for the most part.
p104
aVAnd so what they found, in fact,
p105
aVis that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans.
p106
aVAnd so at that time, of course, there was no refrigeration.
p107
aVSo fishermen could only catch
p108
aVwhat they could either eat or sell that day.
p109
aVBut the Romans developed salting.
p110
aVAnd with salting,
p111
aVit became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances.
p112
aVAnd so began industrial fishing.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have
p115
aVof what sort of loss we've had
p116
aVrelative to pre-human impacts on the ocean.
p117
aVThey range from 65 to 98 percent
p118
aVfor these major groups of organisms,
p119
aVas shown in the dark blue bars.
p120
aVNow for those species the we managed to leave alone, that we protect \u2014
p121
aVfor example, marine mammals in recent years and sea birds \u2014
p122
aVthere is some recovery.
p123
aVSo it's not all hopeless.
p124
aVBut for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.
p127
aVIt's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida.
p128
aVAnd so this is a photograph from the 1950s.
p129
aVI want you to notice the scale on the slide,
p130
aVbecause when you see the same picture from the 1980s,
p131
aVwe see the fish are much smaller
p132
aVand we're also seeing a change
p133
aVin terms of the composition of those fish.
p134
aVBy 2007, the catch was actually laughable
p135
aVin terms of the size for a trophy fish.
p136
aVBut this is no laughing matter.
p137
aVThe oceans have lost a lot of their productivity
p138
aVand we're responsible for it.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo what's left? Actually quite a lot.
p141
aVThere's a lot of exciting things, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them.
p142
aVAnd I want to start with a bit on technology,
p143
aVbecause, of course, this is a TED Conference
p144
aVand you want to hear something on technology.
p145
aVSo one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean
p146
aVare remotely operated vehicles.
p147
aVSo these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor
p148
aVwhere they're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom.
p149
aVSo a couple of years ago, I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise
p150
aVand I couldn't go because of a scheduling conflict.
p151
aVBut through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home
p152
aVwith my dog curled up at my feet, a cup of tea in my hand,
p153
aVand I could tell the pilot, "I want a sample right there."
p154
aVAnd that's exactly what the pilot did for me.
p155
aVThat's the sort of technology that's available today
p156
aVthat really wasn't available even a decade ago.
p157
aVSo it allows us to sample these amazing habitats
p158
aVthat are very far from the surface
p159
aVand very far from light.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans
p162
aVis acoustics, or sound waves.
p163
aVAnd the advantage of sound waves
p164
aVis that they actually pass well through water, unlike light.
p165
aVAnd so we can send out sound waves,
p166
aVthey bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back.
p167
aVAnd so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships.
p168
aVOne would send out sound waves that would bounce back.
p169
aVThey would be received by a second ship,
p170
aVand that would give us very precise estimates, in this case,
p171
aVof 250 billion herring
p172
aVin a period of about a minute.
p173
aVAnd that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island.
p174
aVAnd to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool,
p175
aVbecause knowing how many fish are there is really critical.
p176
aa(lp177
VWe can also use satellite tags
p178
aVto track animals as they move through the oceans.
p179
aVAnd so for animals that come to the surface to breathe,
p180
aVsuch as this elephant seal,
p181
aVit's an opportunity to send data back to shore
p182
aVand tell us where exactly it is in the ocean.
p183
aVAnd so from that we can produce these tracks.
p184
aVFor example, the dark blue
p185
aVshows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific.
p186
aVNow I realize for those of you who are colorblind, this slide is not very helpful,
p187
aVbut stick with me nonetheless.
p188
aa(lp189
VFor animals that don't surface,
p190
aVwe have something called pop-up tags,
p191
aVwhich collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets.
p192
aVAnd then at some period of time
p193
aVit pops up to the surface and, again, relays that data back to shore.
p194
aVBecause GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools.
p195
aVAnd so from this we're able to identify these blue highways,
p196
aVthese hot spots in the ocean,
p197
aVthat should be real priority areas
p198
aVfor ocean conservation.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow one of the other things that you may think about
p201
aVis that, when you go to the supermarket and you buy things, they're scanned.
p202
aVAnd so there's a barcode on that product
p203
aVthat tells the computer exactly what the product is.
p204
aVGeneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding.
p205
aVAnd what barcoding does
p206
aVis use a specific gene called CO1
p207
aVthat's consistent within a species, but varies among species.
p208
aVAnd so what that means is we can unambiguously identify
p209
aVwhich species are which
p210
aVeven if they look similar to each other,
p211
aVbut may be biologically quite different.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this
p214
aVis the story of two young women, high school students in New York City,
p215
aVwho worked with the census.
p216
aVThey went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City
p217
aVand they barcoded it.
p218
aVWell what they found was mislabeled fish.
p219
aVSo for example,
p220
aVthey found something which was sold as tuna, which is very valuable,
p221
aVwas in fact tilapia, which is a much less valuable fish.
p222
aVThey also found an endangered species
p223
aVsold as a common one.
p224
aVSo barcoding allows us to know what we're working with
p225
aVand also what we're eating.
p226
aa(lp227
VThe Ocean Biogeographic Information System
p228
aVis the database for all the census data.
p229
aVIt's open access; you can all go in and download data as you wish.
p230
aVAnd it contains all the data from the census
p231
aVplus other data sets that people were willing to contribute.
p232
aVAnd so what you can do with that
p233
aVis to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans.
p234
aVWhat I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand.
p235
aVThis is where our sampling effort has concentrated.
p236
aVNow what you can see
p237
aVis we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic,
p238
aVin the North Sea in particular,
p239
aVand also the east coast of North America fairly well.
p240
aVThat's the warm colors which show a well-sampled region.
p241
aVThe cold colors, the blue and the black,
p242
aVshow areas where we have almost no data.
p243
aVSo even after a 10-year census,
p244
aVthere are large areas that still remain unexplored.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico
p247
aVwho decided really as a labor of love
p248
aVto pull together all the knowledge they could
p249
aVabout biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico.
p250
aVAnd so they put this together, a list of all the species,
p251
aVwhere they're known to occur,
p252
aVand it really seemed like a very esoteric, scientific type of exercise.
p253
aVBut then, of course, there was the Deep Horizon oil spill.
p254
aVSo all of a sudden, this labor of love
p255
aVfor no obvious economic reason
p256
aVhas become a critical piece of information
p257
aVin terms of how that system is going to recover, how long it will take
p258
aVand how the lawsuits
p259
aVand the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years
p260
aVare likely to be resolved.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo what did we find?
p263
aVWell, I could stand here for hours, but, of course, I'm not allowed to do that.
p264
aVBut I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries
p265
aVfrom the census.
p266
aVSo one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity?
p267
aVWhere do we find the most species of ocean life?
p268
aVAnd what we find if we plot up the well-known species
p269
aVis this sort of a distribution.
p270
aVAnd what we see is that for coastal tags,
p271
aVfor those organisms that live near the shoreline,
p272
aVthey're most diverse in the tropics.
p273
aVThis is something we've actually known for a while,
p274
aVso it's not a real breakthrough.
p275
aa(lp276
VWhat is really exciting though
p277
aVis that the oceanic tags, or the ones that live far from the coast,
p278
aVare actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes.
p279
aVThis is the sort of data, again, that managers could use
p280
aVif they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve.
p281
aVYou can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale.
p282
aVAnd that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow while a lot of the species we discovered in the census
p285
aVare things that are small and hard to see,
p286
aVthat certainly wasn't always the case.
p287
aVFor example, while it's hard to believe
p288
aVthat a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists,
p289
aVit did until a few years ago
p290
aVwhen South African fishermen requested an export permit
p291
aVand scientists realized that this was something new to science.
p292
aVSimilarly this Golden V kelp
p293
aVcollected in Alaska just below the low water mark
p294
aVis probably a new species.
p295
aVEven though it's three meters long,
p296
aVit actually, again, eluded science.
p297
aVNow this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length.
p298
aVBut to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,
p299
aVso it was a lot harder to find.
p300
aVBut there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.
p301
aVThis particular shrimp, we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp,
p302
aVit's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago \u2014
p303
aVat least it was, until the census discovered
p304
aVit was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia.
p305
aVAnd it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness,
p306
aVcan hide secrets for a very long time.
p307
aVSo, Steven Spielberg, eat your heart out.
p308
aa(lp309
VIf we look at distributions, in fact distributions change dramatically.
p310
aVAnd so one of the records that we had
p311
aVwas this sooty shearwater, which undergoes these spectacular migrations
p312
aVall the way from New Zealand
p313
aVall the way up to Alaska and back again
p314
aVin search of endless summer
p315
aVas they complete their life cycles.
p316
aVWe also talked about the White Shark Cafe.
p317
aVThis is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge.
p318
aVWe don't know why they converge there, we simply don't know.
p319
aVThat's a question for the future.
p320
aa(lp321
VOne of the things that we're taught in high school
p322
aVis that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.
p323
aVNow this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size,
p324
aVnot terribly charismatic.
p325
aVBut it was only discovered in the early 1980s.
p326
aVBut the really interesting thing about it
p327
aVis that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered
p328
aVthat this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments
p329
aVin the deep Mediterranean Sea.
p330
aVSo now they know that, in fact,
p331
aVanimals can live without oxygen, at least some of them,
p332
aVand that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions.
p333
aa(lp334
VIf you were to suck all the water out of the ocean,
p335
aVthis is what you'd be left behind with,
p336
aVand that's the biomass of life on the sea floor.
p337
aVNow what we see is huge biomass towards the poles
p338
aVand not much biomass in between.
p339
aVWe found life in the extremes.
p340
aVAnd so there were new species that were found
p341
aVthat live inside ice
p342
aVand help to support an ice-based food web.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd we also found this spectacular yeti crab
p345
aVthat lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island.
p346
aVAnd this particular species
p347
aVreally captured the public's attention.
p348
aVWe also found the deepest vents known yet \u2014 5,000 meters \u2014
p349
aVthe hottest vents at 407 degrees Celsius \u2014
p350
aVvents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic
p351
aVwhere none had been found before.
p352
aVSo even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow in terms of the unknowns, there are many.
p355
aVAnd I'm just going to summarize just a few of them
p356
aVvery quickly for you.
p357
aVFirst of all, we might ask, how many fishes in the sea?
p358
aVWe actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean
p359
aVother than marine mammals.
p360
aVAnd so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery
p361
aVhow many more species we're likely to discover.
p362
aVAnd from that, we actually calculate
p363
aVthat we know about 16,500 marine species
p364
aVand there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go.
p365
aVSo we've done pretty well.
p366
aVWe've got about 75 percent of the fish,
p367
aVmaybe as much as 90 percent.
p368
aVBut the fishes, as I say, are the best known.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms.
p371
aVNow this figure is actually based on a brand new paper
p372
aVthat's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology.
p373
aVAnd what is does is predict how many more species there are
p374
aVon land and in the ocean.
p375
aVAnd what they found
p376
aVis that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean.
p377
aVThat means 91 percent, even after the census,
p378
aVstill remain to be discovered.
p379
aVAnd so that turns out to be about two million species
p380
aVonce all is said and done.
p381
aVSo we still have quite a lot of work to do
p382
aVin terms of unknowns.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow this bacterium
p385
aVis part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile.
p386
aVAnd these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece.
p387
aVAnd so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye.
p388
aVBut you can imagine the biomass that represents.
p389
aVBut the really intriguing thing about the microbes
p390
aVis just how diverse they are.
p391
aVA single drop of seawater
p392
aVcould contain 160 different types of microbes.
p393
aVAnd the oceans themselves
p394
aVare thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types.
p395
aVSo that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there?
p396
aVWe actually don't know.
p397
aa(lp398
VThe most exciting thing, I would say, about this census
p399
aVis the role of global science.
p400
aVAnd so as we see in this image of light during the night,
p401
aVthere are lots of areas of the Earth
p402
aVwhere human development is much greater
p403
aVand other areas where it's much less,
p404
aVbut between them we see large dark areas
p405
aVof relatively unexplored ocean.
p406
aVThe other point I'd like to make about this
p407
aVis that this ocean's interconnected.
p408
aVMarine organisms do not care about international boundaries;
p409
aVthey move where they will.
p410
aVAnd so the importance then of global collaboration
p411
aVbecomes all the more important.
p412
aa(lp413
VWe've lost a lot of paradise.
p414
aVFor example, these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea
p415
aVare now effectively gone.
p416
aVThere were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean,
p417
aVwhich collected more garbage than they did animals.
p418
aVAnd that's the deep sea, that's the environment that we consider to be
p419
aVamong the most pristine left on Earth.
p420
aVAnd there are a lot of other pressures.
p421
aVOcean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with,
p422
aVas well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs.
p423
aVOn the scale of decades, in our lifetimes,
p424
aVwe're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs.
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd I could spend the rest of my time, which is getting very limited,
p427
aVgoing through this litany of concerns about the ocean,
p428
aVbut I want to end on a more positive note.
p429
aVAnd so the grand challenge then
p430
aVis to try and make sure that we preserve what's left,

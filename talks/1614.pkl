VSo I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.
p5
aVIt makes me to stand here,
p6
aVthe fame, the money I got out of it.
p7
aVSo what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.
p8
aVWhat you did in the early marriage days,
p9
aVyou tried to impress your wife. I did the same.
p10
aVOn that occasion, I found my wife
p11
aVcarrying something like this.
p12
aVI saw. "What is that?" I asked.
p13
aVMy wife replied, "None of your business."
p14
aVThen, being her husband, I ran behind her
p15
aVand saw she had a nasty rag cloth.
p16
aVI don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.
p17
aVThen I understood this \u2014 adapting that unhygienic method
p18
aVto manage her period days.
p19
aa(lp20
VThen I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?
p21
aVShe replied, I also know about [sanitary pads],
p22
aVbut myself and my sisters, if they start using that,
p23
aVwe have to cut our family milk budget.
p24
aVThen I was shocked. What is the connection between
p25
aVusing a sanitary pad and a milk budget?
p26
aVAnd it's called affordability.
p27
aVI tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.
p28
aVI went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.
p29
aVThat fellow looks left and right,
p30
aVand spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper,
p31
aVgives it to me like a banned item, something like that.
p32
aVI don't know why. I did not ask for a condom.
p33
aVThen I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it?
p34
aa(lp35
VThe very first time, at the age of 29,
p36
aVthat day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.
p37
aVI must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?
p38
aVThey are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.
p39
aVThen I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton \u2014
p40
aVoh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material \u2014
p41
aVinside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
p42
aVWhy not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
p43
aVThat's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad,
p44
aVwhere can I check it?
p45
aVIt's not like I can just check it in the lab.
p46
aVI need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India?
p47
aVEven in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.
p48
aVSo only problem: the only available victim is my wife.
p49
aa(lp50
VThen I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti \u2014 my wife's name is Shanti.
p51
aV"Close your eyes. Whatever I give,
p52
aVit will be not a diamond pendant
p53
aVnot a diamond ring, even a chocolate,
p54
aVI will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.
p55
aVClose your eyes."
p56
aVBecause I tried to make it intimate.
p57
aVBecause it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVSo one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.
p60
aVThen other victims, they got into my sisters.
p61
aVBut even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.
p62
aVThat's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.
p63
aVThey are having a lot of women volunteers around them.
p64
aVWhy I am not getting [any]?
p65
aVYou know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.
p66
aVThen I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
p67
aVThey also refused. Finally, I decide,
p68
aVuse sanitary pad myself.
p69
aVNow I am having a title like
p70
aVthe first man to set foot on the moon.
p71
aVArmstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest,
p72
aVlike that Muruganantham is the first man
p73
aVwore a sanitary pad across the globe.
p74
aa(lp75
VI wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle,
p76
aVI tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties,
p77
aVwhile I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press,
p78
aVdoses of blood will go there.
p79
aVThat makes me bow down to any woman in front of me
p80
aVto give full respect. That five days I'll never forget \u2014
p81
aVthe messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.
p82
aVMy God, it's unbelievable.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut here the problem is, one company is making napkin
p85
aVout of cotton. It is working well.
p86
aVBut I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working.
p87
aVThat makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.
p88
aVYou need first funds.
p89
aVNot only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research,
p90
aVI come through all sorts of problems, including
p91
aVa divorce notice from my wife.
p92
aVWhy is this? I used medical college girls.
p93
aVShe suspects I am using as a trump card
p94
aVto run behind medical college girls.
p95
aVFinally, I came to know it is a special cellulose
p96
aVderived from a pinewood, but even after that,
p97
aVyou need a multimillion-dollar plant like this
p98
aVto process that material. Again, a stop-up.
p99
aVThen I spend another four years to create my own
p100
aVmachine tools, a simple machine tool like this.
p101
aVIn this machine, any rural woman can apply the same
p102
aVraw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant,
p103
aVanyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.
p104
aVThat is my invention.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo after that, what I did,
p107
aVusually if anyone got a patent or an invention,
p108
aVimmediately you want to make, convert into this.
p109
aVI never did this. I dropped it just like this,
p110
aVbecause you do this, if anyone runs after money,
p111
aVtheir life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom.
p112
aVA lot of people making a lot of money, billion,
p113
aVbillions of dollars accumulating.
p114
aVWhy are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?
p115
aVWhy the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?
p116
aVWhat if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
p117
aVThat's why I am giving this machine
p118
aVonly in rural India, for rural women, because in India,
p119
aV[you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women
p120
aVare using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth,
p121
aVa leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.
p122
aVIt is the same in the 21st century. That's why I am going
p123
aVto decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.
p124
aVSo far, 630 installations happened in 23 states
p125
aVin six other countries.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow I'm on my seventh year sustaining against
p128
aVmultinational, transnational giants \u2014 makes all MBA students a question mark.
p129
aVA school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?
p130
aVThat makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.
p131
aV(Applause)
p132
aVPlay video one.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Video) Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"
p135
aVShe replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start
p136
aVusing napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."
p137
aVWhy not make myself a low-cost napkin?
p138
aVSo I decided I'm going to sell this new machine
p139
aVonly for Women Self Help Groups.
p140
aVThat is my idea.
p141
aa(lp142
VAM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment
p143
aVfor machine and all. Now, any rural woman can.
p144
aVThey are performing puja.
p145
aV(Video): (Singing)
p146
aVYou just think, competing giants,
p147
aVeven from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.
p148
aVI make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.
p149
aVI'm sustaining on seventh year.
p150
aVAlready 600 installations. What is my mission?
p151
aVI'm going to make India
p152
aV[into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.
p153
aVIn this way I'm going to provide not less than a million
p154
aVrural employment that I'm going to create.
p155
aVThat's why I'm not running after this bloody money.
p156
aVI'm doing something serious.
p157
aVIf you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.
p158
aVDo your job simply, the girl will chase you.
p159
aVLike that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.
p160
aVMahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
p161
aVNot in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man.
p162
aVThat's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society
p163
aVof not using sanitary pad.
p164
aVI am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy.
p165
aVI don't want to make this as a corporate entity.
p166
aVI want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement
p167
aVacross the globe. That's why I put all the details
p168
aVon public domain like an open software.
p169
aVNow 110 countries are accessing it. Okay?
p170
aVSo I classify the people into three:
p171
aVuneducated, little educated, surplus educated.
p172
aVLittle educated, done this. Surplus educated,
p173
aVwhat are you going to do for the society?
p174
aa(lp175
VThank you very much. Bye!

VSo in my free time outside of Twitter
p5
aVI experiment a little bit
p6
aVwith telling stories online, experimenting
p7
aVwith what we can do with new digital tools.
p8
aVAnd in my job at Twitter,
p9
aVI actually spent a little bit of time
p10
aVworking with authors and storytellers as well,
p11
aVhelping to expand out the bounds
p12
aVof what people are experimenting with.
p13
aVAnd I want to talk through some examples today
p14
aVof things that people have done
p15
aVthat I think are really fascinating
p16
aVusing flexible identity and anonymity on the web
p17
aVand blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut I want to start and go back to the 1930s.
p20
aVLong before a little thing called Twitter,
p21
aVradio brought us broadcasts
p22
aVand connected millions of people
p23
aVto single points of broadcast.
p24
aVAnd from those single points emanated stories.
p25
aVSome of them were familiar stories.
p26
aVSome of them were new stories.
p27
aVAnd for a while they were familiar formats,
p28
aVbut then radio began to evolve its own
p29
aVunique formats specific to that medium.
p30
aVThink about episodes that happened live on radio.
p31
aa(lp32
VCombining the live play
p33
aVand the serialization of written fiction,
p34
aVyou get this new format.
p35
aVAnd the reason why I bring up radio is that I think
p36
aVradio is a great example of how a new medium
p37
aVdefines new formats which then define new stories.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd of course, today, we have an entirely new
p40
aVmedium to play with,
p41
aVwhich is this online world.
p42
aVThis is the map of verified users on Twitter
p43
aVand the connections between them.
p44
aVThere are thousands upon thousands of them.
p45
aVEvery single one of these points
p46
aVis its own broadcaster.
p47
aVWe've gone to this world of many to many,
p48
aVwhere access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.
p49
aVAnd I think that we should start to see
p50
aVwildly new formats emerge
p51
aVas people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.
p52
aVI actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier
p53
aVfor creative experimentation, if you will,
p54
aVthat we've explored and begun to settle
p55
aVthis wild land of the Internet
p56
aVand are now just getting ready
p57
aVto start to build structures on it,
p58
aVand those structures are the new formats
p59
aVof storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.
p60
aa(lp61
VI believe this starts with an evolution
p62
aVof existing methods.
p63
aVThe short story, for example,
p64
aVpeople are saying that the short story
p65
aVis experiencing a renaissance of sorts
p66
aVthanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.
p67
aVOne writer, Hugh Howey, experimented
p68
aVwith short stories on Amazon
p69
aVby releasing one very short story called "Wool."
p70
aVAnd he actually says that he didn't intend
p71
aVfor "Wool" to become a series,
p72
aVbut that the audience loved the first story so much
p73
aVthey demanded more, and so he gave them more.
p74
aVHe gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one,
p75
aV"Wool 3," which was even longer,
p76
aVculminating in "Wool 5,"
p77
aVwhich was a 60,000-word novel.
p78
aVI think Howey was able to do all of this because
p79
aVhe had the quick feedback system of e-books.
p80
aVHe was able to write and publish
p81
aVin relatively short order.
p82
aVThere was no mediator between him and the audience.
p83
aVIt was just him directly connected with his audience
p84
aVand building on the feedback and enthusiasm
p85
aVthat they were giving him.
p86
aVSo this whole project was an experiment.
p87
aVIt started with the one short story,
p88
aVand I think the experimentation actually became
p89
aVa part of Howey's format.
p90
aVAnd that's something that this medium enabled,
p91
aVwas experimentation being a part of the format itself.
p92
aa(lp93
VThis is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan
p94
aVcalled "Black Box."
p95
aVIt was originally written
p96
aVspecifically with Twitter in mind.
p97
aVEgan convinced The New Yorker
p98
aVto start a New Yorker fiction account
p99
aVfrom which they could tweet
p100
aVall of these lines that she created.
p101
aVNow Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.
p102
aVEgan mocked that up just writing manually
p103
aVin this storyboard sketchbook,
p104
aVused the physical space constraints
p105
aVof those storyboard squares
p106
aVto write each individual tweet,
p107
aVand those tweets ended up becoming
p108
aVover 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.
p109
aVEvery night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in
p110
aVto a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.
p111
aVI think that's pretty exciting:
p112
aVtune-in literary fiction.
p113
aVThe experience of Egan's story, of course,
p114
aVlike anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.
p115
aVYou could scroll back through it,
p116
aVbut interestingly, if you were watching it live,
p117
aVthere was this suspense that built
p118
aVbecause the actual tweets,
p119
aVyou had no control over when you would read them.
p120
aVThey were coming at a pretty regular clip,
p121
aVbut as the story was building,
p122
aVnormally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,
p123
aVbut in this case, The New Yorker did,
p124
aVand they were sending you bit by bit by bit,
p125
aVand you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnother great example of fiction
p128
aVand the short story on Twitter,
p129
aVElliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."
p130
aVIt began with this tweet: "On November 28
p131
aVat 10:13 p.m.,
p132
aVa woman identified as Miranda Brown,
p133
aV44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death
p134
aVfrom the roof of a Manhattan hotel."
p135
aVIt begins in Elliott's voice,
p136
aVbut then Elliott's voice recedes,
p137
aVand we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,
p138
aVcharacters that Elliott created on Twitter
p139
aVspecifically to tell this story,
p140
aVa story from multiple perspectives
p141
aVleading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.
p142
aVwhen this woman falls to her death.
p143
aVThese three characters brought an authentic vision
p144
aVfrom multiple perspectives.
p145
aVOne reviewer called Elliott's story
p146
aV"Twitter fiction done right," because she did.
p147
aVShe captured that voice
p148
aVand she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.
p149
aVInterestingly, though, it wasn't just
p150
aVTwitter as a distribution mechanism.
p151
aVIt was also Twitter as a production mechanism.
p152
aVElliott told me later
p153
aVshe wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.
p154
aVShe laid on the couch and just went back and forth
p155
aVbetween different characters
p156
aVtweeting out each line, line by line.
p157
aVI think that this kind of spontaneous creation
p158
aVof what was coming out of the characters' voices
p159
aVreally lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,
p160
aVbut also to this format that she had created
p161
aVof multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.
p162
aa(lp163
VAs you begin to play with flexible identity online,
p164
aVit gets even more interesting
p165
aVas you start to interact with the real world.
p166
aVThings like Invisible Obama
p167
aVor the famous "binders full of women"
p168
aVthat came up during the 2012 election cycle,
p169
aVor even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter
p170
aVin which you have all of these accounts
p171
aVfor every single one of the characters in "The West Wing,"
p172
aVincluding the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window
p173
aVin one single episode. (Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VAll of these are rapid iterations on a theme.
p176
aVThey are creative people experimenting
p177
aVwith the bounds of what is possible in this medium.
p178
aVYou look at something like "West Wing" Twitter,
p179
aVin which you have these fictional characters
p180
aVthat engage with the real world.
p181
aVThey comment on politics,
p182
aVthey cry out against the evils of Congress.
p183
aVKeep in mind, they're all Democrats.
p184
aVAnd they engage with the real world.
p185
aVThey respond to it.
p186
aVSo once you take flexible identity,
p187
aVanonymity, engagement with the real world,
p188
aVand you move beyond simple homage or parody
p189
aVand you put these tools to work in telling a story,
p190
aVthat's when things get really interesting.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo during the Chicago mayoral election
p193
aVthere was a parody account.
p194
aVIt was Mayor Emanuel.
p195
aVIt gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,
p196
aVparticularly in the expletive department.
p197
aVThis foul-mouthed account
p198
aVfollowed the daily activities of the race,
p199
aVproviding commentary as it went.
p200
aVIt followed all of the natural tropes
p201
aVof a good, solid Twitter parody account,
p202
aVbut then started to get weird.
p203
aVAnd as it progressed, it moved from this commentary
p204
aVto a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic
p205
aVin which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,
p206
aVengages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,
p207
aVwhich is \u2014 it didn't actually happen.
p208
aVI double checked the newspapers.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd then, very interestingly, it came to an end.
p211
aVThis is something that doesn't usually happen
p212
aVwith a Twitter parody account.
p213
aVIt ended, a true narrative conclusion.
p214
aVAnd so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,
p215
aVwho was completely anonymous this whole time,
p216
aVI think Dan \u2014 it made a lot of sense for him
p217
aVto turn this into a book,
p218
aVbecause it was a narrative format in the end,
p219
aVand I think that turning it into a book
p220
aVis representative of this idea that he had created something new
p221
aVthat needed to be translated into previous formats.
p222
aa(lp223
VOne of my favorite examples
p224
aVof something that's happening on Twitter right now,
p225
aVactually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.
p226
aVCrimer Show tells the story
p227
aVof a supercriminal and a hapless detective
p228
aVthat face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,
p229
aVwith all of the tropes of a television show.
p230
aVCrimer Show's creator has said that
p231
aVit is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,
p232
aVbut, man, is it weird.
p233
aVAnd there are all these times where Crimer,
p234
aVthe supercriminal, does all of these TV things.
p235
aVHe's always taking off his sunglasses
p236
aVor turning to the camera,
p237
aVbut these things just happen in text.
p238
aVI think borrowing all of these tropes from television
p239
aVand additionally presenting each Crimer Show
p240
aVas an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod,"
p241
aVpresenting them as episodes
p242
aVreally, it creates something new.
p243
aVThere is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show
p244
aVon Twitter pretty much every day,
p245
aVand they're archived that way.
p246
aVAnd I think this is an interesting experiment in format.
p247
aVSomething totally new has been created here
p248
aVout of parodying something on television.
p249
aa(lp250
VI think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,
p251
aVthere are a lot of really excellent examples as well.
p252
aVRealTimeWWII is an account
p253
aVthat documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago
p254
aVin exceptional detail, as if
p255
aVyou were reading the news reports from that day.
p256
aVAnd the author Teju Cole has done
p257
aVa lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist
p258
aVon events of the news.
p259
aVIn this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.
p260
aVI think that in both of these examples,
p261
aVyou're beginning to see ways in which
p262
aVpeople are telling stories with nonfiction content
p263
aVthat can be built into new types
p264
aVof fictional storytelling.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo with real-time storytelling,
p267
aVblurring the lines between fact and fiction,
p268
aVthe real world and the digital world,
p269
aVflexible identity, anonymity,
p270
aVthese are all tools that we have accessible to us,
p271
aVand I think that they're just the building blocks.
p272
aVThey are the bits that we use
p273
aVto create the structures, the frames,
p274
aVthat then become our settlements on this
p275
aVwide open frontier for creative experimentation.
p276
aa(lp277
VThank you.

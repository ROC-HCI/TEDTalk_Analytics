VAs a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space.
p5
aVI would watch Nova on PBS.
p6
aVOur school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy.
p7
aVWhen I was in elementary school, my next door neighbor,
p8
aVhe gave me a book for my birthday.
p9
aVIt was an astronomy book,
p10
aVand I poured over that thing for hours on end,
p11
aVand it was a combination of all these things
p12
aVthat inspired me to pursue space exploration
p13
aVas my own personal dream, and part of that dream was,
p14
aVI always wanted to just fly around the solar system
p15
aVand visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft.
p16
aa(lp17
VWell, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA
p18
aVand I found myself at NASA,
p19
aVworking for the jet propulsion laboratory,
p20
aVand there our team was challenged
p21
aVto create a 3D visualization of the solar system,
p22
aVand today I want to show you what we've done so far.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here
p25
aVyou can do at home, because we built this
p26
aVfor the public for you guys to use.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo what you're looking at right now is the Earth.
p29
aVYou can see the United States and California
p30
aVand San Diego, and you can use the mouse
p31
aVor the keyboard to spin things around.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth
p34
aVhas seen this before, but one thing we like to say
p35
aVin our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth.
p36
aVGoogle Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.
p37
aVWe go from this view out to the stars.
p38
aVSo the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show
p39
aVare the spacecraft,
p40
aVso I'm going to bring the interface back up,
p41
aVand now you're looking at a number of satellites
p42
aVorbiting the Earth.
p43
aVThese are a number of our science space Earth orbiters.
p44
aVWe haven't included military satellites and weather satellites
p45
aVand communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.
p46
aVIf we did, it would be a complete mess,
p47
aVbecause there's a lot of stuff out there.
p48
aVAnd the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models
p49
aVfor a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit
p50
aVany of these, all you need to do is double-click on them.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo I'm going to find the International Space Station,
p53
aVdouble-click, and it will take us all the way down to the ISS.
p54
aVAnd now you're riding along with the ISS
p55
aVwhere it is right now.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd the other cool thing is, not only can we
p58
aVmove the camera around, we can also control time,
p59
aVso I can slide this jog dial here
p60
aVto shuttle time forward, and now
p61
aVwe can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like,
p62
aVand they get one every 90 minutes. (Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VAll right, so what about the rest of it?
p65
aVWell, I can click on this home button over here,
p66
aVand that will take us up to the inner solar system,
p67
aVand now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.
p68
aVYou can see, there's Saturn, there's Jupiter,
p69
aVand while we're here, I want to point out something.
p70
aVIt's actually pretty busy.
p71
aa(lp72
VHere we have the Mars Science Laboratory
p73
aVon its way to Mars, just launched last weekend.
p74
aa(lp75
VHere we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.
p76
aVWe have Dawn orbiting Vesta,
p77
aVand we have over here New Horizons
p78
aVon a straight shot to Pluto.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd I mention this because
p81
aVthere's this strange public perception that
p82
aVNASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying
p83
aVand all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there.
p84
aa(lp85
VWell, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration,
p86
aVand we have a lot of spacecraft out there.
p87
aVGranted, we're not sending humans up at the moment,
p88
aVwell at least with our own launch vehicles,
p89
aVbut NASA is far from dead,
p90
aVand one of the reasons why we write a program like this
p91
aVis so that people realize that there's so many other things
p92
aVthat we're doing.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnyway, while we're here, again,
p95
aVif you want to visit anything,
p96
aVall you need to do is double-click.
p97
aVSo I'm just going to double-click on Vesta,
p98
aVand here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta,
p99
aVand this is happening right now.
p100
aVI'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see
p101
aVUranus rotating on its side along with its moons.
p102
aVYou can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd just being able to visit different places
p105
aVand go through different times,
p106
aVwe have data from 1950 to 2050.
p107
aVGranted, we don't have everything in between,
p108
aVbecause some of the data is hard to get.
p109
aVJust being able to visit places in different times,
p110
aVyou can explore this for hours,
p111
aVliterally hours on end,
p112
aVbut I want to show you one thing in particular,
p113
aVso I'm going to open up the destination tab,
p114
aVspacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1,
p115
aVand I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.
p116
aVSo now we've gone back in time.
p117
aVWe're now riding along with Voyager 1.
p118
aVThe date here is November 11, 1980.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, there's a funny thing going on here.
p121
aVIt doesn't look like anything's going on.
p122
aVIt looks like I've paused the program.
p123
aVIt's actually running at real rate right now,
p124
aVone second per second, and in fact,
p125
aVVoyager 1 here is flying by Titan at
p126
aVI think it's 38,000 miles per hour.
p127
aVIt only looks like nothing's moving because, well,
p128
aVSaturn here is 700,000 miles away,
p129
aVand Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away.
p130
aVIt's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut to make it more interesting,
p133
aVI'm going to speed up time, and we can watch
p134
aVas Voyager 1 flies by Titan,
p135
aVwhich is a hazy moon of Saturn.
p136
aVIt actually has a very thick atmosphere.
p137
aVAnd I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here.
p138
aVI'm going to pull out, and I want to show you
p139
aVVoyager 1 as it flies by Saturn.
p140
aa(lp141
VThere's a point to be made here.
p142
aVWith a 3D visualization like this,
p143
aVwe can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.
p144
aVThere's a whole story to tell here.
p145
aVAnd even better, because it's an interactive application,
p146
aVyou can tell the story for yourself.
p147
aVIf you want to pause it, you can pause it.
p148
aVIf you want to keep going, if you want to change
p149
aVthe camera angle, you can do that,
p150
aVand because of that, I can show you
p151
aVthat Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.
p152
aVIt actually flies underneath Saturn.
p153
aVNow, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn,
p154
aVSaturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up
p155
aVand out of the solar system,
p156
aVso if I just keep letting this go,
p157
aVyou can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.
p158
aVAnd, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.
p159
aVI'm going to go back to today, now,
p160
aVand I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.
p161
aVRight there, above, way above the solar system,
p162
aVway beyond our solar system.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.
p165
aVNow you know why, and to me,
p166
aVthat's the point of this program.
p167
aVYou can manipulate it yourself.
p168
aVYou can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself.
p169
aa(lp170
VYou know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp."
p171
aVWell, we're trying to give you
p172
aVthe solar system in your grasp \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p173
aVand we hope once it's there,
p174
aVyou'll be able to learn for yourself
p175
aVwhat we've done out there, and what we're about to do.
p176
aVAnd my personal dream is for kids to take this
p177
aVand explore and see the wonders out there
p178
aVand be inspired, as I was as a kid,
p179
aVto pursue STEM education
p180
aVand to pursue a dream in space exploration.
p181
aa(lp182
VThank you. (Applause)

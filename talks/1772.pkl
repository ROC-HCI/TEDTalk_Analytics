VWriting biography is a strange thing to do.
p5
aVIt's a journey into the foreign territory
p6
aVof somebody else's life,
p7
aVa journey, an exploration that can take you places
p8
aVyou never dreamed of going
p9
aVand still can't quite believe you've been,
p10
aVespecially if, like me, you're an agnostic Jew
p11
aVand the life you've been exploring
p12
aVis that of Muhammad.
p13
aa(lp14
VFive years ago, for instance,
p15
aVI found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle
p16
aVto what I knew was an impossible question:
p17
aVWhat actually happened
p18
aVone desert night,
p19
aVhalf the world and almost half of history away?
p20
aVWhat happened, that is,
p21
aVon the night in the year 610
p22
aVwhen Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran
p23
aVon a mountain just outside Mecca?
p24
aVThis is the core mystical moment of Islam,
p25
aVand as such, of course,
p26
aVit defies empirical analysis.
p27
aVYet the question wouldn't let go of me.
p28
aVI was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am,
p29
aVjust asking it could be seen
p30
aVas pure chutzpah.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVAnd I plead guilty as charged,
p33
aVbecause all exploration, physical or intellectual,
p34
aVis inevitably in some sense an act of transgression,
p35
aVof crossing boundaries.
p36
aa(lp37
VStill, some boundaries are larger than others.
p38
aVSo a human encountering the divine,
p39
aVas Muslims believe Muhammad did,
p40
aVto the rationalist, this is a matter not of fact
p41
aVbut of wishful fiction,
p42
aVand like all of us, I like to think of myself as rational.
p43
aa(lp44
VWhich might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts
p45
aVwe have of that night,
p46
aVwhat struck me even more than what happened
p47
aVwas what did not happen.
p48
aVMuhammad did not come floating off the mountain
p49
aVas though walking on air.
p50
aVHe did not run down shouting, "Hallelujah!"
p51
aVand "Bless the Lord!"
p52
aVHe did not radiate light and joy.
p53
aVThere were no choirs of angels,
p54
aVno music of the spheres, no elation, no ecstasy,
p55
aVno golden aura surrounding him,
p56
aVno sense of an absolute, fore-ordained role
p57
aVas the messenger of God.
p58
aVThat is, he did none of the things
p59
aVthat might make it easy to cry foul,
p60
aVto put down the whole story as a pious fable.
p61
aVQuite the contrary.
p62
aVIn his own reported words,
p63
aVhe was convinced at first
p64
aVthat what had happened couldn't have been real.
p65
aVAt best, he thought, it had to have been a hallucination \u2014
p66
aVa trick of the eye or the ear, perhaps,
p67
aVor his own mind working against him.
p68
aVAt worst, possession \u2014
p69
aVthat he'd been seized by an evil jinn,
p70
aVa spirit out to deceive him,
p71
aVeven to crush the life out of him.
p72
aVIn fact, he was so sure that he could only be majnun,
p73
aVpossessed by a jinn,
p74
aVthat when he found himself still alive,
p75
aVhis first impulse was to finish the job himself,
p76
aVto leap off the highest cliff
p77
aVand escape the terror of what he'd experienced
p78
aVby putting an end to all experience.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo the man who fled down the mountain that night
p81
aVtrembled not with joy
p82
aVbut with a stark, primordial fear.
p83
aVHe was overwhelmed not with conviction, but by doubt.
p84
aVAnd that panicked disorientation,
p85
aVthat sundering of everything familiar,
p86
aVthat daunting awareness of something
p87
aVbeyond human comprehension,
p88
aVcan only be called a terrible awe.
p89
aa(lp90
VThis might be somewhat difficult to grasp
p91
aVnow that we use the word "awesome"
p92
aVto describe a new app or a viral video.
p93
aVWith the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake,
p94
aVwe're protected from real awe.
p95
aVWe close the doors and hunker down,
p96
aVconvinced that we're in control,
p97
aVor, at least, hoping for control.
p98
aVWe do our best to ignore the fact that
p99
aVwe don't always have it,
p100
aVand that not everything can be explained.
p101
aVYet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic,
p102
aVwhether you think the words Muhammad heard that night
p103
aVcame from inside himself or from outside,
p104
aVwhat's clear is that he did experience them,
p105
aVand that he did so with a force that would shatter
p106
aVhis sense of himself and his world
p107
aVand transform this otherwise modest man
p108
aVinto a radical advocate for social and economic justice.
p109
aVFear was the only sane response,
p110
aVthe only human response.
p111
aa(lp112
VToo human for some,
p113
aVlike conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that
p114
aVthe account of his wanting to kill himself
p115
aVshouldn't even be mentioned, despite the fact
p116
aVthat it's in the earliest Islamic biographies.
p117
aVThey insist that he never doubted
p118
aVfor even a single moment, let alone despaired.
p119
aVDemanding perfection, they refuse to tolerate
p120
aVhuman imperfection.
p121
aVYet what, exactly, is imperfect about doubt?
p122
aVAs I read those early accounts, I realized it was
p123
aVprecisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me,
p124
aVthat allowed me to begin to see him in full,
p125
aVto accord him the integrity of reality.
p126
aVAnd the more I thought about it,
p127
aVthe more it made sense that he doubted,
p128
aVbecause doubt is essential to faith.
p129
aa(lp130
VIf this seems a startling idea at first,
p131
aVconsider that doubt, as Graham Greene once put it,
p132
aVis the heart of the matter.
p133
aVAbolish all doubt, and what's left is not faith,
p134
aVbut absolute, heartless conviction.
p135
aVYou're certain that you possess the Truth \u2014
p136
aVinevitably offered with an implied uppercase T \u2014
p137
aVand this certainty quickly devolves
p138
aVinto dogmatism and righteousness,
p139
aVby which I mean a demonstrative, overweening pride
p140
aVin being so very right,
p141
aVin short, the arrogance of fundamentalism.
p142
aVIt has to be one of the multiple ironies of history
p143
aVthat a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists
p144
aVis the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists
p145
aVknown as Crusaders:
p146
aV"infidel," from the Latin for "faithless."
p147
aVDoubly ironic, in this case, because their absolutism
p148
aVis in fact the opposite of faith.
p149
aVIn effect, they are the infidels.
p150
aVLike fundamentalists of all religious stripes,
p151
aVthey have no questions, only answers.
p152
aVThey found the perfect antidote to thought
p153
aVand the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith.
p154
aVThey don't have to struggle for it like Jacob
p155
aVwrestling through the night with the angel,
p156
aVor like Jesus in his 40 days and nights in the wilderness,
p157
aVor like Muhammad, not only that night on the mountain,
p158
aVbut throughout his years as a prophet,
p159
aVwith the Koran constantly urging him not to despair,
p160
aVand condemning those who most loudly proclaim
p161
aVthat they know everything there is to know
p162
aVand that they and they alone are right.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority,
p165
aVhave ceded the public arena to this extremist minority.
p166
aVWe've allowed Judaism to be claimed
p167
aVby violently messianic West Bank settlers,
p168
aVChristianity by homophobic hypocrites
p169
aVand misogynistic bigots,
p170
aVIslam by suicide bombers.
p171
aVAnd we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that
p172
aVno matter whether they claim to be Christians,
p173
aVJews or Muslims,
p174
aVmilitant extremists are none of the above.
p175
aVThey're a cult all their own, blood brothers
p176
aVsteeped in other people's blood.
p177
aa(lp178
VThis isn't faith.
p179
aVIt's fanaticism, and we have to stop confusing the two.
p180
aVWe have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers.
p181
aVIt's difficult and stubborn.
p182
aVIt involves an ongoing struggle,
p183
aVa continual questioning of what we think we know,
p184
aVa wrestling with issues and ideas.
p185
aVIt goes hand in hand with doubt,
p186
aVin a never-ending conversation with it,
p187
aVand sometimes in conscious defiance of it.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd this conscious defiance is why I, as an agnostic,
p190
aVcan still have faith.
p191
aVI have faith, for instance, that peace in the Middle East
p192
aVis possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence
p193
aVto the contrary.
p194
aVI'm not convinced of this.
p195
aVI can hardly say I believe it.
p196
aVI can only have faith in it,
p197
aVcommit myself, that is, to the idea of it,
p198
aVand I do this precisely because of the temptation
p199
aVto throw up my hands in resignation
p200
aVand retreat into silence.
p201
aa(lp202
VBecause despair is self-fulfilling.
p203
aVIf we call something impossible,
p204
aVwe act in such a way that we make it so.
p205
aVAnd I, for one, refuse to live that way.
p206
aVIn fact, most of us do,
p207
aVwhether we're atheist or theist
p208
aVor anywhere in between or beyond, for that matter,
p209
aVwhat drives us is that, despite our doubts
p210
aVand even because of our doubts,
p211
aVwe reject the nihilism of despair.
p212
aVWe insist on faith in the future
p213
aVand in each other.
p214
aVCall this naive if you like.
p215
aVCall it impossibly idealistic if you must.
p216
aVBut one thing is sure:
p217
aVCall it human.
p218
aa(lp219
VCould Muhammad have so radically changed his world
p220
aVwithout such faith, without the refusal
p221
aVto cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty?
p222
aVI think not.
p223
aVAfter keeping company with him as a writer
p224
aVfor the past five years, I can't see
p225
aVthat he'd be anything but utterly outraged
p226
aVat the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak
p227
aVand act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today.
p228
aVHe'd be appalled at the repression of half the population
p229
aVbecause of their gender.
p230
aVHe'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism.
p231
aVHe'd call out terrorism for what it is,
p232
aVnot only criminal but an obscene travesty
p233
aVof everything he believed in and struggled for.
p234
aVHe'd say what the Koran says: Anyone who takes a life
p235
aVtakes the life of all humanity.
p236
aVAnyone who saves a life, saves the life of all humanity.
p237
aVAnd he'd commit himself fully
p238
aVto the hard and thorny process of making peace.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you. (Applause)

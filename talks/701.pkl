VHow do you observe something you can't see?
p5
aVThis is the basic question of somebody who's interested
p6
aVin finding and studying black holes.
p7
aVBecause black holes are objects
p8
aVwhose pull of gravity is so intense
p9
aVthat nothing can escape it, not even light,
p10
aVso you can't see it directly.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, my story today about black holes
p13
aVis about one particular black hole.
p14
aVI'm interested in finding whether or not
p15
aVthere is a really massive, what we like to call
p16
aV"supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.
p17
aVAnd the reason this is interesting is that
p18
aVit gives us an opportunity to prove
p19
aVwhether or not these exotic objects really exist.
p20
aVAnd second, it gives us the opportunity
p21
aVto understand how these supermassive black holes
p22
aVinteract with their environment,
p23
aVand to understand how they affect the formation and evolution
p24
aVof the galaxies which they reside in.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo, to begin with,
p27
aVwe need to understand what a black hole is
p28
aVso we can understand the proof of a black hole.
p29
aVSo, what is a black hole?
p30
aVWell, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,
p31
aVbecause there are only three characteristics that you can describe:
p32
aVthe mass,
p33
aVthe spin, and the charge.
p34
aVAnd I'm going to only talk about the mass.
p35
aVSo, in that sense, it's a very simple object.
p36
aVBut in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object
p37
aVthat we need relatively exotic physics to describe,
p38
aVand in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding
p39
aVof the universe.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut today, the way I want you to understand a black hole,
p42
aVfor the proof of a black hole,
p43
aVis to think of it as an object
p44
aVwhose mass is confined to zero volume.
p45
aVSo, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about
p46
aVan object that's supermassive,
p47
aVand I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,
p48
aVit has no finite size.
p49
aVSo, this is a little tricky.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut fortunately there is a finite size that you can see,
p52
aVand that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.
p53
aVAnd that's named after the guy who recognized
p54
aVwhy it was such an important radius.
p55
aVThis is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.
p56
aVSo why is it so important?
p57
aVIt's important because it tells us
p58
aVthat any object can become a black hole.
p59
aVThat means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,
p60
aVthe auditorium can become a black hole
p61
aVif you can figure out how to compress it down
p62
aVto the size of the Schwarzschild radius.
p63
aa(lp64
VAt that point, what's going to happen?
p65
aVAt that point gravity wins.
p66
aVGravity wins over all other known forces.
p67
aVAnd the object is forced to continue to collapse
p68
aVto an infinitely small object.
p69
aVAnd then it's a black hole.
p70
aVSo, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,
p71
aVit would become a black hole,
p72
aVbecause the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.
p75
aVAnd it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.
p76
aVIt depends only on the mass of the object.
p77
aVBigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.
p78
aVSmaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.
p79
aVSo, if I were to take the sun
p80
aVand compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,
p81
aVit would become a black hole.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.
p84
aVAnd it's actually quite a useful concept,
p85
aVbecause it tells us not only
p86
aVwhen a black hole will form,
p87
aVbut it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.
p88
aVI only need two things.
p89
aVI need to understand the mass of the object
p90
aVI'm claiming is a black hole,
p91
aVand what its Schwarzschild radius is.
p92
aVAnd since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,
p93
aVthere is actually only one thing I really need to know.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo, my job in convincing you
p96
aVthat there is a black hole
p97
aVis to show that there is some object
p98
aVthat's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.
p99
aVAnd your job today is to be skeptical.
p100
aVOkay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;
p101
aVI'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,
p104
aVas if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.
p105
aVAn ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state
p106
aVof a really massive star's life.
p107
aVSo, if a star starts its life off
p108
aVwith much more mass than the mass of the Sun,
p109
aVit's going to end its life by exploding
p110
aVand leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.
p111
aVAnd inside that supernova remnant
p112
aVis going to be a little black hole
p113
aVthat has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.
p114
aVOn an astronomical scale
p115
aVthat's a very small black hole.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.
p118
aVAnd the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.
p119
aVAnd this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope
p120
aVshows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.
p121
aVThere are big ones. There are little ones.
p122
aVAlmost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.
p123
aVAnd there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.
p124
aVAnd there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,
p125
aVjust to give you a sense of scale.
p126
aVAnd all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,
p127
aVwhich is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,
p128
aVcomes from the light from the stars.
p129
aVSo, we see the galaxy because of the star light.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.
p132
aVI like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,
p133
aVbecause they are kind of show offs.
p134
aVAnd we call them active galactic nuclei.
p135
aVAnd we call them that because their nucleus,
p136
aVor their center, are very active.
p137
aVSo, at the center there, that's actually where
p138
aVmost of the starlight comes out from.
p139
aVAnd yet, what we actually see is light
p140
aVthat can't be explained by the starlight.
p141
aVIt's way more energetic.
p142
aVIn fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.
p143
aVThere are also jets emanating out from the center.
p144
aVAgain, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain
p145
aVif you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo, what people have thought is that perhaps
p148
aVthere are supermassive black holes
p149
aVwhich matter is falling on to.
p150
aVSo, you can't see the black hole itself,
p151
aVbut you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole
p152
aVinto the light we see.
p153
aVSo, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes
p154
aVexist at the center of galaxies.
p155
aVBut it's a kind of indirect argument.
p156
aa(lp157
VNonetheless, it's given rise to the notion
p158
aVthat maybe it's not just these prima donnas
p159
aVthat have these supermassive black holes,
p160
aVbut rather all galaxies might harbor these
p161
aVsupermassive black holes at their centers.
p162
aVAnd if that's the case \u2014 and this is an example of a normal galaxy;
p163
aVwhat we see is the star light.
p164
aVAnd if there is a supermassive black hole,
p165
aVwhat we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.
p166
aVBecause that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see
p167
aVin active galactic nuclei.
p168
aa(lp169
VIf we're going to look for these stealth black holes
p170
aVat the center of galaxies,
p171
aVthe best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.
p172
aVAnd this is a wide field picture
p173
aVtaken of the center of the Milky Way.
p174
aVAnd what we see is a line of stars.
p175
aVAnd that is because we live in a galaxy which has
p176
aVa flattened, disk-like structure.
p177
aVAnd we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,
p178
aVwe see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,
p179
aVor line that defines the plane of the galaxy.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, the advantage of studying our own galaxy
p182
aVis it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy
p183
aVthat we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy
p184
aVis 100 times further away.
p185
aVSo, we can see far more detail in our galaxy
p186
aVthan anyplace else.
p187
aVAnd as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail
p188
aVis key to this experiment.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass
p191
aVinside a small volume?
p192
aVWhich is the job that I have to show you today.
p193
aVAnd the tool that we use is to watch the way
p194
aVstars orbit the black hole.
p195
aVStars will orbit the black hole
p196
aVin the very same way that planets orbit the sun.
p197
aVIt's the gravitational pull
p198
aVthat makes these things orbit.
p199
aVIf there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,
p200
aVor at least go at a much slower rate
p201
aVbecause all that determines how they go around
p202
aVis how much mass is inside its orbit.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo, this is great, because remember my job is to show
p205
aVthere is a lot of mass inside a small volume.
p206
aVSo, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.
p207
aVAnd if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.
p208
aVSo, I want to see the stars
p209
aVthat are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.
p210
aVBecause I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.
p211
aVSo, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.
p212
aVAnd that's the reason that for this experiment we've used
p213
aVthe world's largest telescope.
p214
aa(lp215
VThis is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes
p216
aVwith a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly
p217
aVthe diameter of a tennis court.
p218
aVNow, this is wonderful,
p219
aVbecause the campaign promise
p220
aVof large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,
p221
aVthe smaller the detail that we can see.
p222
aVBut it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground
p223
aVhas had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.
p224
aVAnd that is because of the atmosphere.
p225
aVAtmosphere is great for us; it allows us
p226
aVto survive here on Earth.
p227
aVBut it's relatively challenging for astronomers
p228
aVwho want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo, to give you a sense of what this is like,
p231
aVit's actually like looking at a pebble
p232
aVat the bottom of a stream.
p233
aVLooking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,
p234
aVthe stream is continuously moving and turbulent,
p235
aVand that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.
p236
aVVery much in the same way, it's very difficult
p237
aVto see astronomical sources, because of the
p238
aVatmosphere that's continuously moving by.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways
p241
aVto correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.
p242
aVAnd that buys us about a factor of 20.
p243
aVAnd I think all of you can agree that if you can
p244
aVfigure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,
p245
aVyou've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,
p246
aVsay your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd this animation here shows you one example of
p249
aVthe techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.
p250
aVYou're seeing an animation that goes between
p251
aVan example of what you would see if you don't use this technique \u2014
p252
aVin other words, just a picture that shows the stars \u2014
p253
aVand the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,
p254
aVwhere we think the black hole is.
p255
aVSo, without this technology you can't see the stars.
p256
aVWith this technology all of a sudden you can see it.
p257
aVThis technology works by introducing a mirror
p258
aVinto the telescope optics system
p259
aVthat's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.
p260
aVSo, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.
p261
aa(lp262
VNow, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on
p263
aVthat little square there.
p264
aVSo, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,
p265
aValthough we've looked at all of them.
p266
aVSo, I want to see how these things have moved.
p267
aVAnd over the course of this experiment, these stars
p268
aVhave moved a tremendous amount.
p269
aVSo, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,
p270
aVand we see the stars go all the way around.
p271
aa(lp272
VNow, most astronomers have a favorite star,
p273
aVand mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.
p274
aVAbsolutely my favorite star in the world.
p275
aVAnd that's because it goes around in only 15 years.
p276
aVAnd to give you a sense of how short that is,
p277
aVthe sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.
p278
aVStars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy
p279
aVas possible, take 500 years.
p280
aVAnd this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.
p281
aVThat's kind of profound, in a way.
p282
aa(lp283
VBut it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me
p284
aVhow much mass is inside a very small radius.
p285
aVSo, next we see a picture here that shows you
p286
aVbefore this experiment the size to which we could
p287
aVconfine the mass of the center of the galaxy.
p288
aVWhat we knew before is that there was four million
p289
aVtimes the mass of the sun inside that circle.
p290
aVAnd as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.
p291
aVYou can see a lot of stars.
p292
aVSo, there was actually lots of alternatives
p293
aVto the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,
p294
aVbecause you could put a lot of stuff in there.
p295
aa(lp296
VBut with this experiment, we've confined
p297
aVthat same mass to a much smaller volume
p298
aVthat's 10,000 times smaller.
p299
aVAnd because of that, we've been able to show
p300
aVthat there is a supermassive black hole there.
p301
aVTo give you a sense of how small that size is,
p302
aVthat's the size of our solar system.
p303
aVSo, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun
p304
aVinto that small volume.
p305
aa(lp306
VNow, truth in advertising. Right?
p307
aVI have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.
p308
aVAnd the truth is, I'm not quite there.
p309
aVBut we actually have no alternative today
p310
aVto explaining this concentration of mass.
p311
aVAnd, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date
p312
aVfor not only existence of a supermassive black hole
p313
aVat the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.
p314
aVSo, what next? I actually think
p315
aVthis is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,
p316
aVso let's move on with the problem.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo, what I want to tell you, very briefly,
p319
aVis a few examples
p320
aVof the excitement of what we can do today
p321
aVat the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,
p322
aVor at least we believe,
p323
aVthat there is a supermassive black hole there.
p324
aVAnd the fun phase of this experiment
p325
aVis, while we've tested some of our ideas
p326
aVabout the consequences of a supermassive black hole
p327
aVbeing at the center of our galaxy,
p328
aValmost every single one
p329
aVhas been inconsistent with what we actually see.
p330
aVAnd that's the fun.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo, let me give you the two examples.
p333
aVYou can ask, "What do you expect
p334
aVfor the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy
p335
aVfor a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole."
p336
aVWhat you expect there is that old stars
p337
aVshould be very clustered around the black hole.
p338
aVYou should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.
p339
aa(lp340
VLikewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,
p341
aVthey just should not be there.
p342
aVA black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.
p343
aVTo get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.
p344
aVAnd it's a very fragile entity.
p345
aVAnd what does the big black hole do?
p346
aVIt strips that gas cloud apart.
p347
aVIt pulls much stronger on one side than the other
p348
aVand the cloud is stripped apart.
p349
aVIn fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo, you shouldn't see young stars.
p352
aVSo, what do we see?
p353
aVUsing observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,
p354
aVwe can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.
p355
aVThe old ones are red.
p356
aVThe young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.
p357
aVSo, you can already see the surprise.
p358
aVThere is a dearth of old stars.
p359
aVThere is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.
p360
aa(lp361
VSo, this is the fun part.
p362
aVAnd in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,
p363
aVthis mystery of how do you get \u2014
p364
aVhow do you resolve this contradiction.
p365
aVSo, in fact, my graduate students
p366
aVare, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,
p367
aVin Hawaii, making observations to get us
p368
aVhopefully to the next stage,
p369
aVwhere we can address this question
p370
aVof why are there so many young stars,
p371
aVand so few old stars.
p372
aVTo make further progress we really need to look at the orbits
p373
aVof stars that are much further away.
p374
aVTo do that we'll probably need much more
p375
aVsophisticated technology than we have today.
p376
aa(lp377
VBecause, in truth, while I said we're correcting
p378
aVfor the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only
p379
aVcorrect for half the errors that are introduced.
p380
aVWe do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,
p381
aVand what we think we can do is if we
p382
aVshine a few more that we can correct the rest.
p383
aVSo this is what we hope to do in the next few years.
p384
aVAnd on a much longer time scale,
p385
aVwhat we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,
p386
aVbecause, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.
p389
aVAnd with this telescope we should be able to see
p390
aVstars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.
p391
aVAnd we hope to be able to test some of
p392
aVEinstein's theories of general relativity,
p393
aVsome ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.
p394
aVSo, we think the future of this experiment
p395
aVis quite exciting.
p396
aa(lp397
VSo, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation
p398
aVthat basically shows you how these
p399
aVorbits have been moving, in three dimensions.
p400
aVAnd I hope, if nothing else,
p401
aVI've convinced you that, one, we do in fact
p402
aVhave a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.
p403
aVAnd this means that these things do exist in our universe,
p404
aVand we have to contend with this, we have to explain
p405
aVhow you can get these objects in our physical world.
p406
aa(lp407
VSecond, we've been able to look at that interaction
p408
aVof how supermassive black holes interact,
p409
aVand understand, maybe, the role in which they play
p410
aVin shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.
p411
aa(lp412
VAnd last but not least,
p413
aVnone of this would have happened
p414
aVwithout the advent of the tremendous progress
p415
aVthat's been made on the technology front.
p416
aVAnd we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,
p417
aVand holds a lot in store for the future.
p418
aVThanks very much.

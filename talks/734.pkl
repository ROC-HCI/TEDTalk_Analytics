VHi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears,
p5
aVthese are the dancing bears.
p6
aVIn 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project
p7
aVto try and find out what was going on.
p8
aVBecause the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted
p9
aVbecause of this.
p10
aVThis is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community
p11
aVwho live across India,
p12
aVand have been in India since the 13th century.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe went about getting evidence of what was going on.
p15
aVAnd this is footage from a hidden camera in a button.
p16
aVAnd we went in, pretending to be buyers.
p17
aVAnd we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka.
p18
aVAnd the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country
p19
aVand being sold and traded.
p20
aVThese were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each,
p21
aVand they are used for bear paw soup,
p22
aVand also being trained, later on,
p23
aVto become dancing bears like the one you just saw.
p24
aa(lp25
VSadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear.
p26
aVThe couple are barely 18 years old.
p27
aVThey already have four children beside them. You can see them.
p28
aVAnd the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals.
p29
aVSo, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, when we started working deeper and digging deeper,
p32
aVwe found that it's an illegal act.
p33
aVThese guys could go to jail for up to seven years
p34
aVif they were caught by authorities.
p35
aVAnd what they were doing to the bears was really appalling.
p36
aVIt was unacceptable.
p37
aVThe mother bears are usually killed.
p38
aVThe cubs, which are taken, are separated.
p39
aVTheir teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod.
p40
aVAnd they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.
p41
aVNow we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that
p42
aVfor a livelihood, to getting something else.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment.
p45
aVAnd we were so unsure that this would work.
p46
aVWe weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him.
p47
aVAnd we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund.
p48
aVLet's see if you can get something else." And we got the bear surrendered
p49
aVto \u2014 we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India.
p50
aVAnd now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.
p51
aVHe has a telephone booth.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd then it started, there was no turning back after that.
p54
aVThis is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.
p55
aVAnd now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store
p56
aVnear Agra.
p57
aVThen there was no looking back at all for us.
p58
aVWe gave cycle rickshaws.
p59
aVWe set up carpet-weaving units,
p60
aVvocational training for the women.
p61
aVThe women were just not allowed to come out of the community
p62
aVand work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that.
p63
aa(lp64
VEducation. The kids never went to school.
p65
aVThey only had Islamic education, very little of it.
p66
aVAnd they were never allowed to go to school
p67
aVbecause they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education.
p68
aVSo, we sponsor 600 children education programs today.
p69
aVWe were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.
p70
aa(lp71
VOf course we also had to get the bears in.
p72
aVThis is what happens to the bears when they come in.
p73
aVAnd this is what we turn them into.
p74
aVWe have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers.
p75
aVSo, basically in 2002 there were
p76
aV1,200 dancing bears.
p77
aVWe rescued over 550 dancing bears.
p78
aVWe've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe big news that I want to announce today
p81
aVis that next month we will be bringing in
p82
aVthe very last bear of India,
p83
aVinto our rescue center.
p84
aV(Applause)
p85
aVAnd India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice
p86
aVwhich has been here for centuries.
p87
aVAnd the people can hold their heads up high.
p88
aVAnd the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past
p89
aVthat they've lived all their lives.
p90
aVAnd the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again.
p91
aVAnd there will be no more removing of these bears.
p92
aVAnd the children, both humans and bear cubs
p93
aVcan live peacefully. Thank you.
p94
aV(Applause)

VI was born and raised in Sierra Leone,
p5
aVa small and very beautiful country
p6
aVin West Africa,
p7
aVa country rich both in physical resources
p8
aVand creative talent.
p9
aa(lp10
VHowever, Sierra Leone is infamous
p11
aVfor a decade-long rebel war in the '90s
p12
aVwhen entire villages were burnt down.
p13
aVAn estimated 8,000 men, women and children
p14
aVhad their arms and legs amputated during this time.
p15
aVAs my family and I ran for safety
p16
aVwhen I was about 12 from one of those attacks,
p17
aVI resolved that I would do everything I could
p18
aVto ensure that my own children
p19
aVwould not go through the  same experiences we had.
p20
aVThey would, in fact, be part of a Sierra Leone
p21
aVwhere war and amputation
p22
aVwere no longer a strategy for gaining power.
p23
aa(lp24
VAs I watched people who I knew, loved ones,
p25
aVrecover from this devastation,
p26
aVone thing that deeply troubled me
p27
aVwas that many of the amputees in the country
p28
aVwould not use their prostheses.
p29
aVThe reason, I would come to find out,
p30
aVwas that their prosthetic sockets
p31
aVwere painful because they did not fit well.
p32
aVThe prosthetic socket is the part
p33
aVin which the amputee inserts their residual limb,
p34
aVand which connects to the prosthetic ankle.
p35
aVEven in the developed world,
p36
aVit takes a period of three weeks to often years
p37
aVfor a patient to get a comfortable socket, if ever.
p38
aVProsthetists still use conventional processes
p39
aVlike molding and casting
p40
aVto create single-material prosthetic sockets.
p41
aVSuch sockets often leave intolerable amounts
p42
aVof pressure on the limbs of the patient,
p43
aVleaving them with pressure sores and blisters.
p44
aVIt does not matter
p45
aVhow powerful your prosthetic ankle is.
p46
aVIf your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable,
p47
aVyou will not use your leg,
p48
aVand that is just simply unacceptable in our age.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo one day, when I met professor Hugh Herr
p51
aVabout two and a half years ago,
p52
aVand he asked me if I knew  how to solve this problem,
p53
aVI said, "No, not yet,
p54
aVbut I would love to figure it out."
p55
aVAnd so, for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab,
p56
aVI designed custom prosthetic sockets
p57
aVquickly and cheaply
p58
aVthat are more comfortable
p59
aVthan conventional prostheses.
p60
aVI used magnetic resonance imaging
p61
aVto capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy,
p62
aVthen use finite element modeling to better predict
p63
aVthe internal stresses and strains
p64
aVon the normal forces,
p65
aVand then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture.
p66
aVWe use a 3D printer to create
p67
aVa multi-material prosthetic socket
p68
aVwhich relieves pressure where needed
p69
aVon the anatomy of the patient.
p70
aVIn short, we're using data
p71
aVto make novel sockets quickly and cheaply.
p72
aVIn a recent trial we just wrapped up
p73
aVat the Media Lab,
p74
aVone of our patients, a U.S. veteran
p75
aVwho has been an amputee for about 20 years
p76
aVand worn dozens of legs,
p77
aVsaid of one of our printed parts,
p78
aV"It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows,
p79
aVand it's effing sexy."
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VDisability in our age
p83
aVshould not prevent anyone
p84
aVfrom living meaningful lives.
p85
aVMy hope and desire is that the tools and processes
p86
aVwe develop in our research group
p87
aVcan be used to bring highly functional prostheses
p88
aVto those who need them.
p89
aVFor me, a place to begin healing the souls
p90
aVof those affected by war and disease
p91
aVis by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces
p92
aVfor their bodies.
p93
aVWhether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston,
p94
aVI hope this not only restores
p95
aVbut indeed transforms their sense of human potential.
p96
aa(lp97
VThank you very much.

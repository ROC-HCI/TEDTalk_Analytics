VI just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa.
p5
aVI was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago,
p6
aVand a Nigerian journalist comes \u2014 and this will only make sense
p7
aVif you've ever watched a James Bond movie \u2014
p8
aVand a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes,
p9
aV"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!"
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVIt was great.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, I've got a little sheet of paper here,
p14
aVmostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone,
p15
aVI'll talk for like two hours.
p16
aa(lp17
VI just want to say good afternoon, good evening.
p18
aVIt's been an incredible few days.
p19
aVIt's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris.
p20
aVBut also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TED
p21
aVthat you just see flitting around the whole place
p22
aVthat have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation.
p23
aVIt's really amazing.
p24
aVI've been in the audience.
p25
aVI'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows
p26
aVand scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit
p27
aVlike a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVLike, what have I got to say about all this?
p30
aVAnd I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday,
p31
aVand I thought it was really great, and I was watching
p32
aVthose incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought,
p33
aV"Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?"
p34
aVMy first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush."
p35
aVBut then I thought, "Why be rude to chimpanzees?"
p36
aVI guess there goes my green card.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VThere's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa.
p40
aVAnd what's become increasingly clear to me is that
p41
aVwe're talking about news stories about Africa;
p42
aVwe're not really talking about African narratives.
p43
aVAnd it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by,
p44
aV40 percent of Americans can't \u2014 either can't afford health insurance
p45
aVor have the most inadequate health insurance,
p46
aVand have a president who, despite the protest
p47
aVof millions of his citizens \u2014 even his own Congress \u2014
p48
aVcontinues to prosecute a senseless war.
p49
aVSo if news is anything to go by,
p50
aVthe U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?
p51
aVWhich it isn't really, is it?
p52
aVAnd talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt
p53
aVthat says, "Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity."
p54
aVIt's amazing, isn't it?
p55
aa(lp56
VThe truth is, everything we know about America,
p57
aVeverything Americans come to know about being American,
p58
aVisn't from the news.
p59
aVI live there.
p60
aVWe don't go home at the end of the day and think,
p61
aV"Well, I really know who I am now
p62
aVbecause the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange
p63
aVclosed at this many points."
p64
aVWhat we know about how to be who we are comes from stories.
p65
aVIt comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines.
p66
aVIt comes from popular culture.
p67
aa(lp68
VIn other words, it's the agents of our imagination
p69
aVwho really shape who we are. And this is important to remember,
p70
aVbecause in Africa
p71
aVthe complicated questions we want to ask about
p72
aVwhat all of this means has been asked
p73
aVfrom the rock paintings of the San people,
p74
aVthrough the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.
p75
aVIf you want to know about Africa, read our literature \u2014
p76
aVand not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying,
p77
aV"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America."
p78
aVThat's very important.
p79
aVThere's a poem by Jack Gilbert called "The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart."
p80
aVHe says, "When the Sumerian tablets were first translated,
p81
aVthey were thought to be business records.
p82
aVBut what if they were poems and psalms?
p83
aVMy love is like twelve Ethiopian goats
p84
aVstanding still in the morning light.
p85
aVShiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body.
p86
aVGiraffes are this desire in the dark."
p87
aVThis is important.
p88
aa(lp89
VIt's important because misreading is really the chance
p90
aVfor complication and opportunity.
p91
aVThe first Igbo Bible was translated from English
p92
aVin about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther,
p93
aVwho was a Yoruba.
p94
aVAnd it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language,
p95
aVand so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe":
p96
aVsame spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven,"
p97
aVand one means "bicycle" or "iron."
p98
aVSo "God is in heaven surrounded by His angels"
p99
aVwas translated as \u2014
p100
aV[Igbo].
p101
aVAnd for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried
p102
aVto translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois,
p103
aVthey chose the Igbo version.
p104
aVAnd I'm not going to give you the patois translation;
p105
aVI'm going to make it standard English.
p106
aVBasically, it ends up as "God is on a bicycle with his angels."
p107
aVThis is good, because language complicates things.
p108
aa(lp109
VYou know, we often think that language mirrors
p110
aVthe world in which we live, and I find that's not true.
p111
aVThe language actually makes the world in which we live.
p112
aVLanguage is not \u2014 I mean, things don't have
p113
aVany mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.
p114
aVAnd language can't be understood in its abstraction.
p115
aVIt can only be understood in the context of story,
p116
aVand everything, all of this is story.
p117
aVAnd it's important to remember that,
p118
aVbecause if we don't, then we become ahistorical.
p119
aVWe've had a lot of \u2014 a parade of amazing ideas here.
p120
aVBut these are not new to Africa.
p121
aVNigeria got its independence in 1960.
p122
aVThe first time the possibility for independence was discussed
p123
aVwas in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots.
p124
aVIn 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War,
p125
aVDr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine.
p126
aVSo, you know, the thing is to remember that
p127
aVbecause otherwise, 10 years from now,
p128
aVwe'll be back here trying to tell this story again.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, what it says to me then is that it's not really \u2014
p131
aVthe problem isn't really the stories that are being told
p132
aVor which stories are being told,
p133
aVthe problem really is the terms of humanity
p134
aVthat we're willing to bring to complicate every story,
p135
aVand that's really what it's all about.
p136
aVLet me tell you a Nigerian joke.
p137
aVWell, it's just a joke, anyway.
p138
aVSo there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction.
p139
aVAnd Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it,
p140
aVand he goes on this rant about, "Twenty years,
p141
aVmy wife has been packing rice for lunch.
p142
aVIf she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself
p143
aVoff this building and kill myself."
p144
aVAnd Dick and Harry repeat this.
p145
aVThe next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice,
p146
aVso he throws himself off and kills himself,
p147
aVand Tom, Dick and Harry follow.
p148
aVAnd now the inquest \u2014 you know, Tom's wife
p149
aVand Dick's wife are distraught.
p150
aVThey wished they'd not packed rice.
p151
aVBut Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know,
p152
aVHarry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years."
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VThis seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria,
p156
aVwas told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa,
p157
aVwith the Hausa being Harry.
p158
aVSo what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry
p159
aVbecomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.
p160
aVMy father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s.
p161
aVIn fact, every time I read in Ireland,
p162
aVpeople get me all mistaken and they say,
p163
aV"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork."
p164
aVBut he was also in Oxford in the '50s,
p165
aVand yet growing up as a child in Nigeria,
p166
aVmy father used to say to me, "You must never eat or drink
p167
aVin a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you."
p168
aVIt makes sense now when I think about it,
p169
aVbecause if you'd known my father,
p170
aVyou would've wanted to poison him too.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VSo I was born in 1966, at the beginning
p174
aVof the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years.
p175
aVAnd I was growing up in school and the federal government
p176
aVdidn't want us taught about the history of the war,
p177
aVbecause they thought it probably would make us
p178
aVgenerate a new generation of rebels.
p179
aVSo I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim,
p180
aVwho wanted to teach us about this.
p181
aVSo what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history,
p182
aVand so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz,
p183
aVI learned the melancholic history of my people
p184
aVthrough the melancholic history of another people.
p185
aVI mean, picture this \u2014 really picture this.
p186
aVA Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history
p187
aVto young Igbo children.
p188
aa(lp189
VStory is powerful.
p190
aVStory is fluid and it belongs to nobody.
p191
aVAnd it should come as no surprise
p192
aVthat my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis
p193
aVtaking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich.
p194
aVIt makes perfect sense.
p195
aVAnd they were to blow up strategic targets
p196
aVand take over the country, and they were foiled
p197
aVby a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams,
p198
aVand a Jewish Nazi hunter.
p199
aVAnd it happened over four continents.
p200
aVAnd when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer
p201
aVto Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best.
p202
aVBut also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused
p203
aVof constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.
p204
aVSo at 18, I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria.
p205
aa(lp206
VI grew up very privileged, and it's important
p207
aVto talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here.
p208
aVA lot of us are very privileged.
p209
aVI grew up \u2014 servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff.
p210
aVMy story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story
p211
aVI encountered in prison, and I had no language for it.
p212
aVI was completely terrified, completely broken,
p213
aVand kept trying to find a new language,
p214
aVa new way to make sense of all of this.
p215
aVSix months after that, with no explanation,
p216
aVthey let me go.
p217
aVNow for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know
p218
aVthat it was because it was costing them too much to feed me.
p219
aV(Laughter)
p220
aVBut I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege,
p221
aVand not just me \u2014 millions of Nigerians
p222
aVgrew up with books and libraries.
p223
aVIn fact, we were talking last night about how all
p224
aVof the steamy novels of Harold Robbins
p225
aVhad done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa
p226
aVthan any sex education programs ever had.
p227
aVAll of those are gone.
p228
aa(lp229
VWe are squandering the most valuable resource
p230
aVwe have on this continent: the valuable resource
p231
aVof the imagination.
p232
aVIn the film, "Sometimes in April" by Raoul Peck,
p233
aVIdris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised,
p234
aVand he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend \u2014
p235
aVfellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi \u2014
p236
aVplayed by Fraser James.
p237
aVAnd Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back,
p238
aVand he's crying.
p239
aVHe's sniveling.
p240
aVIt's a pitiful sight.
p241
aVAnd as we watch it, we are ashamed.
p242
aVAnd we want to say to Idris, "Chop him up.
p243
aVShut him up."
p244
aVAnd as Idris moves, Fraser screams, "Stop!
p245
aVPlease stop!"
p246
aVIdris pauses, then he moves again,
p247
aVand Fraser says, "Please!
p248
aVPlease stop!"
p249
aVAnd it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us;
p250
aVit's the look in Fraser's eyes.
p251
aVIt's one that says, "Don't do this.
p252
aVAnd I'm not saying this to save myself,
p253
aValthough this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you,
p254
aVbecause if you do this, you will be lost."
p255
aVTo be so afraid that you're standing in the face
p256
aVof a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself
p257
aVand crying, but to say in that moment,
p258
aVas Fraser says to Idris, "Tell my girlfriend I love her."
p259
aVIn that moment, Fraser says,
p260
aV"I am lost already, but not you ... not you."
p261
aVThis is a redemption we can all aspire to.
p262
aa(lp263
VAfrican narratives in the West, they proliferate.
p264
aVI really don't care anymore.
p265
aVI'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves \u2014
p266
aVhow as a writer, I find that African writers
p267
aVhave always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.
p268
aVThe question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderful
p269
aVwith narratives of wounds and self-loathing?
p270
aVAnd this is the difficulty that I face.
p271
aVI am trying to move beyond political rhetoric
p272
aVto a place of ethical questioning.
p273
aVI am asking us to balance the idea
p274
aVof our complete vulnerability with the complete notion
p275
aVof transformation of what is possible.
p276
aa(lp277
VAs a young middle-class Nigerian activist,
p278
aVI launched myself along with a whole generation of us
p279
aVinto the campaign to stop the government.
p280
aVAnd I asked millions of people,
p281
aVwithout questioning my right to do so,
p282
aVto go up against the government.
p283
aVAnd I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed.
p284
aVI justified it, and I said, "This is the cost of revolution.
p285
aVHave I not myself been imprisoned?
p286
aVHave I not myself been beaten?"
p287
aVIt wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again,
p288
aVthat I understood the real meaning of torture,
p289
aVand how easy your humanity can be taken from you,
p290
aVfor the time I was engaged in war,
p291
aVrighteous, righteous war.
p292
aVExcuse me.
p293
aa(lp294
VSometimes I can stand before the world \u2014
p295
aVand when I say this, transformation
p296
aVis a difficult and slow process \u2014
p297
aVsometimes I can stand before the world and say,
p298
aV"My name is Chris Abani.
p299
aVI have been human six days, but only sometimes."
p300
aVBut this is a good thing.
p301
aVIt's never going to be easy.
p302
aVThere are no answers.
p303
aVAs I was telling Rachel from Google Earth,
p304
aVthat I had challenged my students in America \u2014
p305
aVI said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots."
p306
aVAnd so they said, "Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani."
p307
aVSo I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa.
p308
aVAnd the truth be told, this is it, isn't it?
p309
aVThere are no essential Africans,
p310
aVand most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else
p311
aVabout the continent we come from,
p312
aVand yet we want to make profound statements about it.
p313
aVAnd I think if we can just admit that we're all trying
p314
aVto approximate the truth of our own communities,
p315
aVit will make for a much more nuanced
p316
aVand a much more interesting conversation.
p317
aVI want to believe that we can be agnostic about this,
p318
aVthat we can rise above all of this.
p319
aa(lp320
VWhen I was 10, I read James Baldwin's "Another Country,"
p321
aVand that book broke me.
p322
aVNot because I was encountering homosexual sex and love
p323
aVfor the first time, but because the way James wrote about it
p324
aVmade it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.
p325
aV"Here," Jimmy said.
p326
aV"Here is love, all of it."
p327
aVThe fact that it happens in "Another Country"
p328
aVtakes you quite by surprise.
p329
aVMy friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world:
p330
aVthose who can count, and those who can't.
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aVHe also says that the cause of all our trouble
p333
aVis the belief in an essential, pure identity:
p334
aVreligious, ethnic, historical, ideological.
p335
aa(lp336
VI want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa
p337
aVthat speaks to transformation.
p338
aVIt's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it
p339
aVthe way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.
p340
aV"Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch,
p341
aVfor how easy it is to be nailed to a board
p342
aVweathered raw as white butcher paper.
p343
aVLast night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet.
p344
aVYou know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell.
p345
aVWeeks ago, you broke me as a woman
p346
aVonce shattered me into a song beneath her weight,
p347
aVbefore you slouched into that grassy hush.
p348
aVAnd now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage,
p349
aVshaped like five bowstrings.
p350
aVGhosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum.
p351
aVYou've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight.
p352
aVPressure can make everything whole again.
p353
aVBrass nails tacked into the ebony wood,
p354
aVyour face has been carved five times.
p355
aVI have to drive trouble in the hills.
p356
aVTrouble in the valley,
p357
aVand trouble by the river too.
p358
aVThere is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash.
p359
aVKadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom.
p360
aVKa-doooom.
p361
aVNow I have beaten a song back into you.
p362
aVRise and walk away like a panther."
p363
aVThank you.

VI will always remember
p5
aVthe first time I met the girl in the blue uniform.
p6
aVI was eight at the time,
p7
aVliving in the village with my grandmother,
p8
aVwho was raising me and other children.
p9
aVFamine had hit my country of Zimbabwe,
p10
aVand we just didn't have enough to eat.
p11
aVWe were hungry.
p12
aVAnd that's when the girl in the blue uniform
p13
aVcame to my village with the United Nations
p14
aVto feed the children.
p15
aa(lp16
VAs she handed me my porridge,
p17
aVI asked her why she was there,
p18
aVand without hesitation, she said,
p19
aV"As Africans, we must uplift all the people of Africa."
p20
aVI had absolutely no idea what she meant.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VBut her words stuck with me.
p25
aa(lp26
VTwo years later,
p27
aVfamine hit my country for the second time.
p28
aVMy grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city
p29
aVto live with an aunt I had never met before.
p30
aVSo at the age of 10,
p31
aVI found myself in school for the very first time.
p32
aVAnd there, at the city school,
p33
aVI would experience what it was to be unequal.
p34
aVYou see, in the village,
p35
aVwe were all equal.
p36
aVBut in the eyes and the minds of the other kids,
p37
aVI was not their equal.
p38
aVI couldn't speak English,
p39
aVand I was way behind in terms of reading and writing.
p40
aVBut this feeling of inequality would get even more complex.
p41
aVEvery school holiday
p42
aVspent back in the village with my grandmother
p43
aVmade me consciously aware
p44
aVof the inequalities this incredible opportunity
p45
aVhad created within my own family.
p46
aVSuddenly, I had much more than the rest of my village.
p47
aVAnd in their eyes, I was no longer their equal.
p48
aa(lp49
VI felt guilty.
p50
aVBut I thought about the girl in the blue uniform,
p51
aVand I remember thinking,
p52
aV"That's who I want to be \u2014
p53
aVsomeone like her,
p54
aVsomeone who uplifts other people."
p55
aVThis childhood experience led me to the United Nations,
p56
aVand to my current role with UN Women,
p57
aVwhere we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities
p58
aVthat affects more than half of the world's population \u2014
p59
aVwomen and girls.
p60
aa(lp61
VToday, I want to share with you
p62
aVa simple idea that seeks to uplift all of us together.
p63
aVEight months ago,
p64
aVunder the visionary leadership of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,
p65
aVhead of UN Women,
p66
aVwe launched a groundbreaking initiative
p67
aVcalled HeForShe,
p68
aVinviting men and boys from around the world
p69
aVto stand in solidarity with each other and with women,
p70
aVto create a shared vision for gender equality.
p71
aVThis is an invitation for those who believe in equality
p72
aVfor women and men,
p73
aVand those who don't yet know that they believe.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe initiative is based on a simple idea:
p76
aVthat what we share is much more powerful
p77
aVthan what divides us.
p78
aVWe all feel the same things.
p79
aVWe all want the same things,
p80
aVeven when those things sometimes remain unspoken.
p81
aVHeForShe is about uplifting all of us,
p82
aVwomen and men together.
p83
aVIt's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality.
p84
aa(lp85
VImagine a blank page
p86
aVwith one horizontal line splitting it in half.
p87
aVNow imagine that women are represented here,
p88
aVand men are represented here.
p89
aVIn our current population,
p90
aVHeForShe is about moving the 3.2 billion men,
p91
aVone man at a time,
p92
aVacross that line,
p93
aVso that ultimately, men can stand alongside women
p94
aVand be on the right side of history,
p95
aVmaking gender equality a reality in the 21st century.
p96
aa(lp97
VHowever, engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial.
p98
aVWhy invite men? They are the problem.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VIn fact, men don't care, we were told.
p103
aa(lp104
VBut something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe.
p105
aVIn just three days, more than 100,000 men
p106
aVhad signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality.
p107
aVWithin that first week, at least one man in every single country in the world
p108
aVstood up to be counted,
p109
aVand within that same week,
p110
aVHeForShe created more than 1.2 billion conversations on social media.
p111
aVAnd that's when the emails started pouring in,
p112
aVsometimes as many as a thousand a day.
p113
aVWe heard from a man out of Zimbabwe,
p114
aVwho, after hearing about HeForShe,
p115
aVcreated a "husband school."
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VHe literally went around his village,
p120
aVhand-picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners,
p121
aVand committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers.
p122
aVIn Pune, India, a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally,
p123
aVmobilizing 700 cyclists
p124
aVto share the HeForShe messages within their own community.
p125
aa(lp126
VIn another impact story,
p127
aVa man sent a very personal note
p128
aVof something that had happened in his own community.
p129
aVHe wrote,
p130
aV"Dear Madam,
p131
aVI have lived all of my life
p132
aVnext door to a man who continuously beats up his wife.
p133
aVTwo weeks ago,
p134
aVI was listening to my radio,
p135
aVand your voice came on,
p136
aVand you spoke about something called the HeForShe,
p137
aVand the need for men to play their role.
p138
aVWithin a few hours, I heard the woman cry again next door,
p139
aVbut for the first time,
p140
aVI didn't just sit there.
p141
aVI felt compelled to do something,
p142
aVso I went over and I confronted the husband.
p143
aVMadam, it has been two weeks,
p144
aVand the woman has not cried since.
p145
aVThank you for giving me a voice."
p146
aa(lp147
V(Applause)
p148
aa(lp149
VPersonal impact stories such as these
p150
aVshow that we are tapping into something within men,
p151
aVbut getting to a world where women and men are equal
p152
aVis not just a matter of bringing men to the cause.
p153
aVWe want concrete, systematic, structural change that can equalize
p154
aVthe political, economic and social realities for women and men.
p155
aVWe are asking men to make concrete actions,
p156
aVcalling them to intervene at a personal level,
p157
aVto change their behavior.
p158
aVWe are calling upon governments, businesses, universities,
p159
aVto change their policies.
p160
aVWe want male leaders to become role models
p161
aVand change agents within their own institutions.
p162
aa(lp163
VAlready, a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up
p164
aVand made some concrete HeForShe commitments.
p165
aVIn a few early success stories,
p166
aVa leading French hospitality company, Accor,
p167
aVhas committed to eliminate the pay gap
p168
aVfor all of its 180,000 employees by 2020.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Applause)
p171
aa(lp172
VThe government of Sweden,
p173
aVunder its current feminist government,
p174
aVhas committed to close both the employment and the pay gap
p175
aVfor all of its citizens within the current electoral term.
p176
aVIn Japan, the University of Nagoya
p177
aVis building, as part of their HeForShe commitments,
p178
aVwhat will become one of Japan's leading gender-research centers.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, eight months later,
p181
aVa movement is building.
p182
aVWe are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life,
p183
aVand from every single corner in the world,
p184
aVfrom the United Nations' own Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
p185
aVto the Secretary-Generals of NATO and the EU Council,
p186
aVfrom the prime minister of Bhutan
p187
aVto the president of Sierra Leone.
p188
aa(lp189
VIn Europe alone, all the male EU Commissioners
p190
aVand the members of Parliament of the Swedish and Iceland governments
p191
aVhave signed up to be HeForShe.
p192
aVIn fact, one in 20 men in Iceland has joined the movement.
p193
aVThe rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador, Emma Watson,
p194
aVhas garnered more than five billion media impressions,
p195
aVmobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world
p196
aVto create more than a hundred HeForShe student associations.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow this is the beginning of the vision that HeForShe has
p199
aVfor the world that we want to see.
p200
aVEinstein once said,
p201
aV"A human being is part of the whole ...
p202
aVbut he experiences himself,
p203
aVhis thoughts and feelings,
p204
aVas something separate from the rest ...
p205
aVThis delusion is a kind of prison for us ...
p206
aVOur task must be to free ourselves from this prison
p207
aVby widening our circle of compassion."
p208
aa(lp209
VIf women and men are part of a greater whole,
p210
aVas Einstein suggests,
p211
aVit is my hope that HeForShe can help free us to realize
p212
aVthat it is not our gender that defines us,
p213
aVbut ultimately, our shared humanity.
p214
aVHeForShe is tapping into women's and men's dreams,
p215
aVthe dreams that we have for ourselves,
p216
aVand the dreams that we have for our families, our children,
p217
aVfriends, communities.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo that's what it is about.
p220
aVHeForShe is about uplifting all of us together.
p221
aa(lp222
VThank you.
p223

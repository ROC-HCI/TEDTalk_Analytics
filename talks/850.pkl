VI'm an ecologist,
p5
aVmostly a coral reef ecologist.
p6
aVI started out in Chesapeake Bay
p7
aVand went diving in the winter
p8
aVand became a tropical ecologist overnight.
p9
aVAnd it was really a lot of fun
p10
aVfor about 10 years.
p11
aVI mean, somebody pays you
p12
aVto go around and travel
p13
aVand look at some of the most
p14
aVbeautiful places on the planet.
p15
aVAnd that was what I did.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I ended up in Jamaica,
p18
aVin the West Indies,
p19
aVwhere the coral reefs were really
p20
aVamong the most extraordinary, structurally,
p21
aVthat I ever saw in my life.
p22
aVAnd this picture here,
p23
aVit's really interesting, it shows two things:
p24
aVFirst of all, it's in black and white
p25
aVbecause the water was so clear
p26
aVand you could see so far,
p27
aVand film was so slow
p28
aVin the 1960s and early 70s,
p29
aVyou took pictures in black and white.
p30
aVThe other thing it shows you
p31
aVis that, although there's this beautiful
p32
aVforest of coral,
p33
aVthere are no fish in that picture.
p34
aa(lp35
VThose reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica
p36
aVwere the most studied coral reefs
p37
aVin the world for 20 years.
p38
aVWe were the best and the brightest.
p39
aVPeople came to study our reefs from Australia,
p40
aVwhich is sort of funny
p41
aVbecause now we go to theirs.
p42
aVAnd the view of scientists
p43
aVabout how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,
p44
aVwas based on these reefs
p45
aVwithout any fish.
p46
aVThen, in 1980,
p47
aVthere was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.
p48
aVI put half the lab
p49
aVup in my house.
p50
aVThe wind blew very strong.
p51
aVThe waves were 25
p52
aVto 50 feet high.
p53
aVAnd the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,
p54
aVand we thought, "Well, we're real smart.
p55
aVWe know that hurricanes
p56
aVhave always happened in the past."
p57
aVAnd we published a paper in Science,
p58
aVthe first time that anybody ever
p59
aVdescribed the destruction
p60
aVon a coral reef by a major hurricane.
p61
aVAnd we predicted what would happen,
p62
aVand we got it all wrong.
p63
aVAnd the reason was
p64
aVbecause of overfishing,
p65
aVand the fact that a last common grazer,
p66
aVa sea urchin, died.
p67
aVAnd within a few months
p68
aVafter that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.
p69
aVAnd that is the same reef;
p70
aVthat's the same reef 15 years ago;
p71
aVthat's the same reef today.
p72
aVThe coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica
p73
aVhave a few percent live coral cover
p74
aVand a lot of seaweed and slime.
p75
aVAnd that's more or less the story
p76
aVof the coral reefs of the Caribbean,
p77
aVand increasingly, tragically,
p78
aVthe coral reefs worldwide.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, that's my little, depressing story.
p81
aVAll of us in our 60s and 70s
p82
aVhave comparable depressing stories.
p83
aVThere are tens of thousands
p84
aVof those stories out there,
p85
aVand it's really hard to conjure up
p86
aVmuch of a sense of well-being,
p87
aVbecause it just keeps getting worse.
p88
aVAnd the reason it keeps getting worse
p89
aVis that after a natural catastrophe,
p90
aVlike a hurricane,
p91
aVit used to be that there was
p92
aVsome kind of successional sequence of recovery,
p93
aVbut what's going on now is that
p94
aVoverfishing and pollution and climate change
p95
aVare all interacting
p96
aVin a way that prevents that.
p97
aVAnd so I'm going to sort of go through
p98
aVand talk about those three
p99
aVkinds of things.
p100
aa(lp101
VWe hear a lot about
p102
aVthe collapse of cod.
p103
aVIt's difficult to imagine that
p104
aVtwo, or some historians would say three world wars
p105
aVwere fought during the colonial era
p106
aVfor the control of cod.
p107
aVCod fed most of the people of Western Europe.
p108
aVIt fed the slaves
p109
aVbrought to the Antilles,
p110
aVthe song "Jamaica Farewell" \u2014
p111
aV"Ackee rice salt fish are nice" \u2014
p112
aVis an emblem of the importance
p113
aVof salt cod from northeastern Canada.
p114
aVIt all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:
p115
aV35,000 people lost their jobs.
p116
aVAnd that was the beginning
p117
aVof a kind of serial depletion
p118
aVfrom bigger and tastier species
p119
aVto smaller and not-so-tasty species,
p120
aVfrom species that were near to home
p121
aVto species that were all around the world,
p122
aVand what have you.
p123
aVIt's a little hard to understand that,
p124
aVbecause you can go to a Costco in the United States
p125
aVand buy cheap fish.
p126
aVYou ought to read the label to find out where it came from,
p127
aVbut it's still cheap,
p128
aVand everybody thinks it's okay.
p129
aa(lp130
VIt's hard to communicate this,
p131
aVand one way that I think is really interesting
p132
aVis to talk about sport fish,
p133
aVbecause people like to go out and catch fish.
p134
aVIt's one of those things.
p135
aVThis picture here shows the trophy fish,
p136
aVthe biggest fish caught
p137
aVby people who pay a lot of money
p138
aVto get on a boat,
p139
aVgo to a place off of Key West in Florida,
p140
aVdrink a lot of beer,
p141
aVthrow a lot of hooks and lines into the water,
p142
aVcome back with the biggest and the best fish,
p143
aVand the champion trophy fish
p144
aVare put on this board, where people take a picture,
p145
aVand this guy is obviously
p146
aVreally excited about that fish.
p147
aVWell, that's what it's like now,
p148
aVbut this is what it was like in the 1950s
p149
aVfrom the same boat in the same place
p150
aVon the same board on the same dock.
p151
aVThe trophy fish
p152
aVwere so big
p153
aVthat you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.
p154
aVAnd the average size trophy fish
p155
aVweighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,
p156
aVand if you wanted to go out and kill something,
p157
aVyou could pretty much count on
p158
aVbeing able to catch one of those fish.
p159
aVAnd they tasted really good.
p160
aVAnd people paid less in 1950 dollars
p161
aVto catch that
p162
aVthan what people pay now
p163
aVto catch those little, tiny fish.
p164
aVAnd that's everywhere.
p165
aa(lp166
VIt's not just the fish, though,
p167
aVthat are disappearing.
p168
aVIndustrial fishing uses big stuff,
p169
aVbig machinery.
p170
aVWe use nets that are 20 miles long.
p171
aVWe use longlines
p172
aVthat have one million or two million hooks.
p173
aVAnd we trawl,
p174
aVwhich means to take something
p175
aVthe size of a tractor trailer truck
p176
aVthat weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,
p177
aVput it on a big chain,
p178
aVand drag it across the sea floor
p179
aVto stir up the bottom and catch the fish.
p180
aVThink of it as
p181
aVbeing kind of the bulldozing of a city
p182
aVor of a forest,
p183
aVbecause it clears it away.
p184
aVAnd the habitat destruction
p185
aVis unbelievable.
p186
aVThis is a photograph,
p187
aVa typical photograph,
p188
aVof what the continental shelves
p189
aVof the world look like.
p190
aVYou can see the rows in the bottom,
p191
aVthe way you can see the rows
p192
aVin a field that has just been plowed
p193
aVto plant corn.
p194
aVWhat that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,
p195
aVwhich is a critical habitat
p196
aVfor the development of fish.
p197
aVWhat it is now is mud,
p198
aVand the area of the ocean floor
p199
aVthat has been transformed from forest
p200
aVto level mud, to parking lot,
p201
aVis equivalent to the entire area
p202
aVof all the forests
p203
aVthat have ever been cut down
p204
aVon all of the earth
p205
aVin the history of humanity.
p206
aVWe've managed to do that
p207
aVin the last 100 to 150 years.
p208
aa(lp209
VWe tend to think of oil spills
p210
aVand mercury
p211
aVand we hear a lot about plastic these days.
p212
aVAnd all of that stuff is really disgusting,
p213
aVbut what's really insidious
p214
aVis the biological pollution that happens
p215
aVbecause of the magnitude of the shifts
p216
aVthat it causes
p217
aVto entire ecosystems.
p218
aVAnd I'm going to just talk very briefly
p219
aVabout two kinds of biological pollution:
p220
aVone is introduced species
p221
aVand the other is what comes from nutrients.
p222
aVSo this is the infamous
p223
aVCaulerpa taxifolia,
p224
aVthe so-called killer algae.
p225
aVA book was written about it.
p226
aVIt's a bit of an embarrassment.
p227
aVIt was accidentally released
p228
aVfrom the aquarium in Monaco,
p229
aVit was bred to be cold tolerant
p230
aVto have in peoples aquaria.
p231
aVIt's very pretty,
p232
aVand it has rapidly started
p233
aVto overgrow
p234
aVthe once very rich
p235
aVbiodiversity of the
p236
aVnorthwestern Mediterranean.
p237
aVI don't know how many of you remember the movie
p238
aV"The Little Shop of Horrors,"
p239
aVbut this is the plant of "The Little Shop of Horrors."
p240
aVBut, instead of devouring the people in the shop,
p241
aVwhat it's doing is overgrowing
p242
aVand smothering
p243
aVvirtually all of the bottom-dwelling life
p244
aVof the entire northwestern
p245
aVMediterranean Sea.
p246
aVWe don't know anything that eats it,
p247
aVwe're trying to do all sorts of genetics
p248
aVand figure out something that could be done,
p249
aVbut, as it stands, it's the monster from hell,
p250
aVabout which nobody knows what to do.
p251
aa(lp252
VNow another form of pollution
p253
aVthat's biological pollution
p254
aVis what happens from excess nutrients.
p255
aVThe green revolution,
p256
aVall of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.
p257
aVIt's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.
p258
aVIt runs down the rivers,
p259
aVand it feeds the plankton,
p260
aVthe little microscopic plant cells
p261
aVin the coastal water.
p262
aVBut since we ate all the oysters
p263
aVand we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,
p264
aVthere's nothing to eat the plankton
p265
aVand there's more and more of it,
p266
aVso it dies of old age,
p267
aVwhich is unheard of for plankton.
p268
aVAnd when it dies, it falls to the bottom
p269
aVand then it rots,
p270
aVwhich means that bacteria break it down.
p271
aVAnd in the process
p272
aVthey use up all the oxygen,
p273
aVand in using up all the oxygen
p274
aVthey make the environment utterly lethal
p275
aVfor anything that can't swim away.
p276
aVSo, what we end up with
p277
aVis a microbial zoo
p278
aVdominated by bacteria
p279
aVand jellyfish, as you see
p280
aVon the left in front of you.
p281
aVAnd the only fishery left \u2014
p282
aVand it is a commercial fishery \u2014
p283
aVis the jellyfish fishery
p284
aVyou see on the right, where there used to be prawns.
p285
aVEven in Newfoundland
p286
aVwhere we used to catch cod,
p287
aVwe now have a jellyfish fishery.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd another version of this sort of thing
p290
aVis what is often called red tides
p291
aVor toxic blooms.
p292
aVThat picture on the left is just staggering to me.
p293
aVI have talked about it a million times,
p294
aVbut it's unbelievable.
p295
aVIn the upper right of that picture on the left
p296
aVis almost the Mississippi Delta,
p297
aVand the lower left of that picture
p298
aVis the Texas-Mexico border.
p299
aVYou're looking at the entire
p300
aVnorthwestern Gulf of Mexico;
p301
aVyou're looking at one toxic
p302
aVdinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,
p303
aVmade by that beautiful little creature
p304
aVon the lower right.
p305
aVAnd in the upper right you see this
p306
aVblack sort of cloud
p307
aVmoving ashore.
p308
aVThat's the same species.
p309
aVAnd as it comes to shore and the wind blows,
p310
aVand little droplets of the water get into the air,
p311
aVthe emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up
p312
aVwith people with acute respiratory distress.
p313
aVAnd that's retirement homes
p314
aVon the west coast of Florida.
p315
aVA friend and I did this thing in Hollywood
p316
aVwe called Hollywood ocean night,
p317
aVand I was trying to figure out how to
p318
aVexplain to actors what's going on.
p319
aVAnd I said,
p320
aV"So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu'
p321
aVbecause all the beautiful people have moved
p322
aVto North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.
p323
aVAnd the only people who are left there
p324
aVare the people who can't afford
p325
aVto move away from the coast,
p326
aVbecause the coast, instead of being paradise,
p327
aVis harmful to your health."
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd then this is amazing.
p330
aVIt was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.
p331
aVThis is from the coast of Brittany,
p332
aVwhich is being enveloped
p333
aVin this green, algal slime.
p334
aVThe reason that it attracted so much attention,
p335
aVbesides the fact that it's disgusting,
p336
aVis that sea birds flying over it
p337
aVare asphyxiated by the smell and die,
p338
aVand a farmer died of it,
p339
aVand you can imagine the scandal that happened.
p340
aVAnd so there's this war
p341
aVbetween the farmers
p342
aVand the fishermen about it all,
p343
aVand the net result is that
p344
aVthe beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff
p345
aVon a regular basis.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd then, of course, there's climate change,
p348
aVand we all know about climate change.
p349
aVI guess the iconic figure of it
p350
aVis the melting of the ice
p351
aVin the Arctic Sea.
p352
aVThink about the thousands and thousands of people who died
p353
aVtrying to find the Northwest Passage.
p354
aVWell, the Northwest Passage is already there.
p355
aVI think it's sort of funny;
p356
aVit's on the Siberian coast,
p357
aVmaybe the Russians will charge tolls.
p358
aVThe governments of the world
p359
aVare taking this really seriously.
p360
aVThe military of the Arctic nations
p361
aVis taking it really seriously.
p362
aVFor all the denial of climate change
p363
aVby government leaders,
p364
aVthe CIA
p365
aVand the navies of Norway
p366
aVand the U.S. and Canada, whatever
p367
aVare busily thinking about
p368
aVhow they will secure their territory
p369
aVin this inevitability
p370
aVfrom their point of view.
p371
aVAnd, of course, Arctic communities are toast.
p372
aa(lp373
VThe other kinds of effects of climate change \u2014
p374
aVthis is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right?
p375
aVAll that white coral.
p376
aVExcept it's supposed to be brown.
p377
aVWhat happens is that
p378
aVthe corals are a symbiosis,
p379
aVand they have these little algal cells
p380
aVthat live inside them.
p381
aVAnd the algae give the corals sugar,
p382
aVand the corals give the algae
p383
aVnutrients and protection.
p384
aVBut when it gets too hot,
p385
aVthe algae can't make the sugar.
p386
aVThe corals say, "You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."
p387
aVThey kick them out, and then they die.
p388
aVNot all of them die; some of them survive,
p389
aVsome more are surviving,
p390
aVbut it's really bad news.
p391
aVTo try and give you a sense of this,
p392
aVimagine you go camping in July
p393
aVsomewhere in Europe or in North America,
p394
aVand you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,
p395
aVand you see that 80 percent of the trees,
p396
aVas far as you can see,
p397
aVhave dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.
p398
aVAnd you come home, and you discover
p399
aVthat 80 percent of all the trees
p400
aVin North America and in Europe
p401
aVhave dropped their leaves.
p402
aVAnd then you read in the paper a few weeks later,
p403
aV"Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."
p404
aVWell, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean
p405
aVduring the 1998 El Nino,
p406
aVan area vastly greater
p407
aVthan the size of North America and Europe,
p408
aVwhen 80 percent of all the corals bleached
p409
aVand a quarter of them died.
p410
aa(lp411
VAnd then the really scary thing
p412
aVabout all of this \u2014
p413
aVthe overfishing, the pollution and the climate change \u2014
p414
aVis that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum.
p415
aVBut there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,
p416
aVthe synergies among them
p417
aVthat make the whole vastly greater
p418
aVthan the sum of the parts.
p419
aVAnd the great scientific challenge
p420
aVfor people like me in thinking about all this,
p421
aVis do we know how
p422
aVto put Humpty Dumpty back together again?
p423
aVI mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.
p424
aVBut what does that mean?
p425
aVWe really don't know.
p426
aa(lp427
VSo what are the oceans going to be like
p428
aVin 20 or 50 years?
p429
aVWell, there won't be any fish
p430
aVexcept for minnows,
p431
aVand the water will be pretty dirty,
p432
aVand all those kinds of things
p433
aVand full of mercury, etc., etc.
p434
aVAnd dead zones will get bigger and bigger
p435
aVand they'll start to merge,
p436
aVand we can imagine something like
p437
aVthe dead-zonification
p438
aVof the global, coastal ocean.
p439
aVThen you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it,
p440
aVbecause it would be a kind of
p441
aVgastronomic Russian roulette.
p442
aVSometimes you have a toxic bloom;
p443
aVsometimes you don't.
p444
aVThat doesn't sell.
p445
aa(lp446
VThe really scary things though
p447
aVare the physical, chemical,
p448
aVoceanographic things that are happening.
p449
aVAs the surface of the ocean gets warmer,
p450
aVthe water is lighter when it's warmer,
p451
aVit becomes harder and harder
p452
aVto turn the ocean over.
p453
aVWe say it becomes
p454
aVmore strongly stratified.
p455
aVThe consequence of that is that
p456
aVall those nutrients
p457
aVthat fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,
p458
aVof the sardines of California
p459
aVor in Peru or whatever,
p460
aVthose slow down
p461
aVand those fisheries collapse.
p462
aVAnd, at the same time,
p463
aVwater from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,
p464
aVdoesn't make it down
p465
aVand the ocean turns into a desert.
p466
aa(lp467
VSo the question is: How are we all
p468
aVgoing to respond to this?
p469
aVAnd we can do
p470
aVall sorts of things to fix it,
p471
aVbut in the final analysis,
p472
aVthe thing we really need to fix
p473
aVis ourselves.
p474
aVIt's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution;
p475
aVit's not about the climate change.
p476
aVIt's about us
p477
aVand our greed and our need for growth
p478
aVand our inability to imagine a world
p479
aVthat is different from the selfish world
p480
aVwe live in today.
p481
aVSo the question is: Will we respond to this or not?
p482
aVI would say that the future of life
p483
aVand the dignity of human beings
p484
aVdepends on our doing that.
p485
aa(lp486
VThank you. (Applause)

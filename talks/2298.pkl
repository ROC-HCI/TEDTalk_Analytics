VSo on my way here,
p5
aVthe passenger next to me and I had a very interesting conversation
p6
aVduring my flight.
p7
aVHe told me, "It seems like the United States has run out of jobs,
p8
aVbecause they're just making some up:
p9
aVcat psychologist, dog whisperer, tornado chaser."
p10
aa(lp11
VA couple of seconds later, he asked me,
p12
aV"So what do you do?"
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd I was like, "Peacebuilder?"
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VEvery day, I work to amplify the voices of women
p18
aVand to highlight their experiences
p19
aVand their participation in peace processes and conflict resolution,
p20
aVand because of my work,
p21
aVI recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally
p22
aVis by reclaiming religion.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, this matter is vitally important to me.
p25
aVAs a young Muslim woman, I am very proud of my faith.
p26
aVIt gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day.
p27
aVIt's the reason I can be here in front of you.
p28
aVBut I can't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion,
p29
aVnot just my own, but all of the world's major faiths.
p30
aVThe misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture
p31
aVhas influenced our social and cultural norms,
p32
aVour laws, our daily lives,
p33
aVto a point where we sometimes don't recognize it.
p34
aa(lp35
VMy parents moved from Libya, North Africa, to Canada
p36
aVin the early 1980s,
p37
aVand I am the middle child of 11 children.
p38
aVYes, 11.
p39
aVBut growing up, I saw my parents,
p40
aVboth religiously devout and spiritual people,
p41
aVpray and praise God for their blessings,
p42
aVnamely me of course, but among others. (Laughter)
p43
aVThey were kind and funny and patient,
p44
aVlimitlessly patient, the kind of patience that having 11 kids forces you to have.
p45
aVAnd they were fair.
p46
aVI was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens.
p47
aVI was treated the same,
p48
aVthe same was expected of me.
p49
aVI was never taught that God judged differently based on gender.
p50
aVAnd my parents' understanding of God as a merciful and beneficial friend
p51
aVand provider shaped the way I looked at the world.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, of course, my upbringing had additional benefits.
p54
aVBeing one of 11 children is Diplomacy 101. (Laughter)
p55
aVTo this day, I am asked where I went to school,
p56
aVlike, "Did you go to Kennedy School of Government?"
p57
aVand I look at them and I'm like, "No,
p58
aVI went to the Murabit School of International Affairs."
p59
aVIt's extremely exclusive. You would have to talk to my mom to get in.
p60
aVLucky for you, she's here.
p61
aVBut being one of 11 children and having 10 siblings
p62
aVteaches you a lot about power structures and alliances.
p63
aVIt teaches you focus; you have to talk fast or say less,
p64
aVbecause you will always get cut off.
p65
aVIt teaches you the importance of messaging.
p66
aVYou have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want,
p67
aVand you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace.
p68
aa(lp69
VBut the most important lesson I learned growing up
p70
aVwas the importance of being at the table.
p71
aVWhen my mom's favorite lamp broke, I had to be there when she was trying
p72
aVto find out how and by who, because I had to defend myself,
p73
aVbecause if you're not, then the finger is pointed at you,
p74
aVand before you know it, you will be grounded.
p75
aVI am not speaking from experience, of course.
p76
aa(lp77
VWhen I was 15 in 2005, I completed high school and I moved
p78
aVfrom Canada \u2014 Saskatoon \u2014
p79
aVto Zawiya, my parents' hometown in Libya,
p80
aVa very traditional city.
p81
aVMind you, I had only ever been to Libya before on vacation,
p82
aVand as a seven-year-old girl, it was magic.
p83
aVIt was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives.
p84
aa(lp85
VTurns out it's not the same as a 15-year-old young lady.
p86
aVI very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect of religion.
p87
aVThe words "haram" \u2014 meaning religiously prohibited \u2014
p88
aVand "aib" \u2014 meaning culturally inappropriate \u2014
p89
aVwere exchanged carelessly,
p90
aVas if they meant the same thing and had the same consequences.
p91
aVAnd I found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates
p92
aVand colleagues, professors, friends, even relatives,
p93
aVbeginning to question my own role and my own aspirations.
p94
aVAnd even with the foundation my parents had provided for me,
p95
aVI found myself questioning the role of women in my faith.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo at the Murabit School of International Affairs,
p98
aVwe go very heavy on the debate,
p99
aVand rule number one is do your research, so that's what I did,
p100
aVand it surprised me how easy it was
p101
aVto find women in my faith who were leaders,
p102
aVwho were innovative, who were strong \u2014
p103
aVpolitically, economically, even militarily.
p104
aVKhadija financed the Islamic movement
p105
aVin its infancy.
p106
aVWe wouldn't be here if it weren't for her.
p107
aVSo why weren't we learning about her?
p108
aVWhy weren't we learning about these women?
p109
aVWhy were women being relegated to positions which predated
p110
aVthe teachings of our faith?
p111
aVAnd why, if we are equal in the eyes of God,
p112
aVare we not equal in the eyes of men?
p113
aa(lp114
VTo me, it all came back to the lessons I had learned as a child.
p115
aVThe decision maker, the person who gets to control the message,
p116
aVis sitting at the table,
p117
aVand unfortunately, in every single world faith,
p118
aVthey are not women.
p119
aVReligious institutions are dominated by men
p120
aVand driven by male leadership,
p121
aVand they create policies in their likeness,
p122
aVand until we can change the system entirely,
p123
aVthen we can't realistically expect to have full economic
p124
aVand political participation of women.
p125
aVOur foundation is broken.
p126
aVMy mom actually says, you can't build a straight house on a crooked foundation.
p127
aa(lp128
VIn 2011, the Libyan revolution broke out, and my family was on the front lines.
p129
aVAnd there's this amazing thing that happens in war,
p130
aVa cultural shift almost, very temporary.
p131
aVAnd it was the first time that I felt it was not only acceptable
p132
aVfor me to be involved, but it was encouraged.
p133
aVIt was demanded.
p134
aVMyself and other women had a seat at the table.
p135
aVWe weren't holding hands or a medium.
p136
aVWe were part of decision making.
p137
aVWe were information sharing. We were crucial.
p138
aVAnd I wanted and needed for that change to be permanent.
p139
aa(lp140
VTurns out, that's not that easy.
p141
aVIt only took a few weeks before the women that I had previously worked with
p142
aVwere returning back to their previous roles,
p143
aVand most of them were driven by words of encouragement
p144
aVfrom religious and political leaders,
p145
aVmost of whom cited religious scripture as their defense.
p146
aVIt's how they gained popular support for their opinions.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo initially, I focused on the economic and political empowerment of women.
p149
aVI thought that would lead to cultural and social change.
p150
aVIt turns out, it does a little, but not a lot.
p151
aVI decided to use their defense as my offense,
p152
aVand I began to cite and highlight Islamic scripture as well.
p153
aa(lp154
VIn 2012 and 2013, my organization led the single largest
p155
aVand most widespread campaign in Libya.
p156
aVWe entered homes and schools and universities, even mosques.
p157
aVWe spoke to 50,000 people directly,
p158
aVand hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials,
p159
aVradio commercials and posters.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd you're probably wondering how a women's rights organization
p162
aVwas able to do this in communities which had previously opposed
p163
aVour sheer existence.
p164
aVI used scripture.
p165
aVI used verses from the Quran and sayings of the Prophet,
p166
aVHadiths, his sayings which are, for example,
p167
aV"The best of you is the best to their family."
p168
aV"Do not let your brother oppress another."
p169
aVFor the first time, Friday sermons led by local community imams
p170
aVpromoted the rights of women.
p171
aVThey discussed taboo issues, like domestic violence.
p172
aVPolicies were changed.
p173
aVIn certain communities, we actually had to go as far
p174
aVas saying the International Human Rights Declaration,
p175
aVwhich you opposed because it wasn't written by religious scholars,
p176
aVwell, those same principles are in our book.
p177
aVSo really, the United Nations just copied us.
p178
aa(lp179
VBy changing the message, we were able to provide
p180
aVan alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in Libya.
p181
aVIt's something that has now been replicated internationally,
p182
aVand while I am not saying it's easy \u2014 believe me, it's not.
p183
aVLiberals will say you're using religion and call you a bad conservative.
p184
aVConservatives will call you a lot of colorful things.
p185
aVI've heard everything from, "Your parents must be extremely ashamed of you" \u2014
p186
aVfalse; they're my biggest fans \u2014
p187
aVto "You will not make it to your next birthday" \u2014
p188
aVagain wrong, because I did.
p189
aVAnd I remain
p190
aVa very strong believer that women's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive.
p191
aVBut we have to be at the table.
p192
aVWe have to stop giving up our position, because by remaining silent,
p193
aVwe allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide.
p194
aVBy saying that we're going to fight for women's rights
p195
aVand fight extremism with bombs and warfare,
p196
aVwe completely cripple local societies which need to address these issues
p197
aVso that they're sustainable.
p198
aa(lp199
VIt is not easy, challenging distorted religious messaging.
p200
aVYou will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats.
p201
aVBut we have to do it.
p202
aVWe have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights,
p203
aVthe principles of our faith,
p204
aVnot for us, not for the women in your families,
p205
aVnot for the women in this room,
p206
aVnot even for the women out there,
p207
aVbut for societies that would be transformed
p208
aVwith the participation of women.
p209
aVAnd the only way we can do that,
p210
aVour only option,
p211
aVis to be, and remain, at the table.
p212
aa(lp213
VThank you.

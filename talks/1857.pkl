VThree years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards
p5
aVfrom Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.
p6
aVMy Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,
p7
aVwas going berserk,
p8
aVand the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,
p9
aVand frantic. My God.
p10
aa(lp11
VI was there covering the 25th anniversary
p12
aVof the world's worst nuclear accident,
p13
aVas you can see by the look on my face,
p14
aVreluctantly so, but with good reason,
p15
aVbecause the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days
p16
aVback in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation
p17
aVas the bomb dropped on Hiroshima,
p18
aVand the sarcophagus, which is the covering
p19
aVover reactor number four,
p20
aVwhich was hastily built 27 years ago,
p21
aVnow sits cracked and rusted
p22
aVand leaking radiation.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo I was filming.
p25
aVI just wanted to get the job done
p26
aVand get out of there fast.
p27
aVBut then, I looked into the distance,
p28
aVand I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse,
p29
aVand I'm thinking, who could be living here?
p30
aVI mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air,
p31
aVare among the most highly contaminated on Earth,
p32
aVand the reactor sits at the the center of
p33
aVa tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone,
p34
aVand it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards.
p35
aVYou have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away,
p36
aVyou have to have a government minder,
p37
aVand there's draconian radiation rules
p38
aVand constant contamination monitoring.
p39
aVThe point being, no human being
p40
aVshould be living anywhere near the dead zone.
p41
aVBut they are.
p42
aa(lp43
VIt turns out an unlikely community
p44
aVof some 200 people are living inside the zone.
p45
aVThey're called self-settlers.
p46
aVAnd almost all of them are women,
p47
aVthe men having shorter lifespans
p48
aVin part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes,
p49
aVif not radiation.
p50
aVHundreds of thousands of people were evacuated
p51
aVat the time of the accident,
p52
aVbut not everybody accepted that fate.
p53
aVThe women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s,
p54
aVare the last survivors of a group who defied authorities
p55
aVand, it would seem, common sense,
p56
aVand returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone.
p57
aVThey did so illegally.
p58
aVAs one woman put it to a soldier
p59
aVwho was trying to evacuate her for a second time,
p60
aV"Shoot me and dig the grave.
p61
aVOtherwise, I'm going home."
p62
aa(lp63
VNow why would they return to such deadly soil?
p64
aVI mean, were they unaware of the risks
p65
aVor crazy enough to ignore them, or both?
p66
aVThe thing is, they see their lives
p67
aVand the risks they run decidedly differently.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,
p70
aVeerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic,
p71
aVtotally contaminated.
p72
aVMany were bulldozed under at the time of the accident,
p73
aVbut a few are left like this,
p74
aVkind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.
p75
aVOthers have a few residents in them,
p76
aVone or two "babushkas," or "babas,"
p77
aVwhich are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.
p78
aVAnother village might have six or seven residents.
p79
aVSo this is the strange demographic of the zone \u2014
p80
aVisolated alone together.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd when I made my way to that piping chimney
p83
aVI'd seen in the distance,
p84
aVI saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her.
p85
aVShe's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village,
p86
aVpopulation eight.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVAnd she said to me, when I asked her the obvious,
p89
aV"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd you have to remember, these women have
p92
aVsurvived the worst atrocities of the 20th century.
p93
aVStalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor,
p94
aVkilled millions of Ukrainians,
p95
aVand they faced the Nazis in the '40s,
p96
aVwho came through slashing, burning, raping,
p97
aVand in fact many of these women
p98
aVwere shipped to Germany as forced labor.
p99
aVSo when a couple decades into Soviet rule,
p100
aVChernobyl happened,
p101
aVthey were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy
p102
aVthat was invisible.
p103
aVSo they returned to their villages
p104
aVand are told they're going to get sick and die soon,
p105
aVbut five happy years, their logic goes,
p106
aVis better than 10 stuck in a high rise
p107
aVon the outskirts of Kiev,
p108
aVseparated from the graves of their mothers
p109
aVand fathers and babies,
p110
aVthe whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon.
p111
aVFor them, environmental contamination
p112
aVmay not be the worst sort of devastation.
p113
aVIt turns out this holds true
p114
aVfor other species as well.
p115
aVWild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned
p116
aVto the region in force,
p117
aVthe very real, very negative effects of radiation
p118
aVbeing trumped by the upside of a mass exodus
p119
aVof humans.
p120
aVThe dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd there is a kind of heroic resilience,
p123
aVa kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those
p124
aVwho start their day at 5 a.m.
p125
aVpulling water from a well
p126
aVand end it at midnight
p127
aVpoised to beat a bucket with a stick
p128
aVand scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes,
p129
aVtheir only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka.
p130
aVAnd there's a patina of simple defiance among them.
p131
aV"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?"
p132
aVI mean, what about their health?
p133
aVThe benefits of hardy, physical living,
p134
aVbut an environment made toxic
p135
aVby a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation.
p136
aVIt's incredibly difficult to parse.
p137
aVHealth studies from the region
p138
aVare conflicting and fraught.
p139
aVThe World Health Organization
p140
aVputs the number of Chernobyl-related deaths
p141
aVat 4,000, eventually.
p142
aVGreenpeace and other organizations
p143
aVput that number in the tens of thousands.
p144
aVNow everybody agrees that thyroid cancers
p145
aVare sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees
p146
aVsuffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere:
p147
aVhigher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism,
p148
aVunemployment and, importantly,
p149
aVdisrupted social networks.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, like many of you,
p152
aVI have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.
p153
aVHome is a transient concept.
p154
aVI have a deeper connection to my laptop
p155
aVthan any bit of soil.
p156
aVSo it's hard for us to understand, but home
p157
aVis the entire cosmos of the rural babushka,
p158
aVand connection to the land is palpable.
p159
aVAnd perhaps because these Ukrainian women
p160
aVwere schooled under the Soviets
p161
aVand versed in the Russian poets,
p162
aVaphorisms about these ideas
p163
aVslip from their mouths all the time.
p164
aa(lp165
V"If you leave, you die."
p166
aa(lp167
V"Those who left are worse off now.
p168
aVThey are dying of sadness."
p169
aa(lp170
V"Motherland is motherland. I will never leave."
p171
aa(lp172
VWhat sounds like faith, soft faith,
p173
aVmay actually be fact,
p174
aVbecause the surprising truth \u2014
p175
aVI mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be
p176
aVthat these women who returned to their homes
p177
aVand have lived on some of the most radioactive land
p178
aVon Earth for the last 27 years,
p179
aVhave actually outlived their counterparts
p180
aVwho accepted relocation,
p181
aVby some estimates up to 10 years.
p182
aa(lp183
VHow could this be?
p184
aVHere's a theory: Could it be
p185
aVthat those ties to ancestral soil,
p186
aVthe soft variables reflected in their aphorisms,
p187
aVactually affect longevity?
p188
aVThe power of motherland
p189
aVso fundamental to that part of the world
p190
aVseems palliative.
p191
aVHome and community are forces
p192
aVthat rival even radiation.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow radiation or not,
p195
aVthese women are at the end of their lives.
p196
aVIn the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone,
p197
aVand it will revert to a wild, radioactive place,
p198
aVfull only of animals and occasionally
p199
aVdaring, flummoxed scientists.
p200
aVBut the spirit and existence of the babushkas,
p201
aVwhose numbers have been halved
p202
aVin the three years I've known them,
p203
aVwill leave us with powerful new templates
p204
aVto think about and grapple with,
p205
aVabout the relative nature of risk,
p206
aVabout transformative connections to home,
p207
aVand about the magnificent tonic
p208
aVof personal agency and self-determination.
p209
aa(lp210
VThank you.

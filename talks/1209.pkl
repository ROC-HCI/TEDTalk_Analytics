VI was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.
p5
aVI couldn't understand
p6
aVthe starvation, the destruction,
p7
aVthe killing of innocent people.
p8
aVMaking sense of those things
p9
aVis a very difficult thing to do.
p10
aVAnd when I was 12, I became an actor.
p11
aVI was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.
p12
aVI was told I was dyslexic.
p13
aVIn fact, I have got qualifications.
p14
aVI got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get \u2014
p15
aVwhich was useful, obviously.
p16
aVAnd so concern
p17
aVis where all of this comes from.
p18
aVAnd then, being an actor, I was doing these different kinds of things,
p19
aVand I felt the content of the work that I was involved in
p20
aVreally wasn't cutting it, that there surely had to be more.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd at that point, I read a book by Frank Barnaby,
p23
aVthis wonderful nuclear physicist,
p24
aVand he said that media had a responsibility,
p25
aVthat all sectors of society had a responsibility
p26
aVto try and progress things and move things forward.
p27
aVAnd that fascinated me,
p28
aVbecause I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life.
p29
aVAnd then I thought, well maybe I could do something.
p30
aVMaybe I could become a filmmaker.
p31
aVMaybe I can use the form of film constructively
p32
aVto in some way make a difference.
p33
aVMaybe there's a little change I can get involved in.
p34
aVSo I started thinking about peace,
p35
aVand I was obviously, as I said to you,
p36
aVvery much moved by these images,
p37
aVtrying to make sense of that.
p38
aVCould I go and speak to older and wiser people
p39
aVwho would tell me how they made sense
p40
aVof the things that are going on?
p41
aVBecause it's obviously incredibly frightening.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut I realized that,
p44
aVhaving been messing around with structure as an actor,
p45
aVthat a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough,
p46
aVthat there needed to be a mountain to climb,
p47
aVthere needed to be a journey that I had to take.
p48
aVAnd if I took that journey,
p49
aVno matter whether it failed or succeeded, it would be completely irrelevant.
p50
aVThe point was that I would have something
p51
aVto hook the questions of \u2014 is humankind fundamentally evil?
p52
aVIs the destruction of the world inevitable? Should I have children?
p53
aVIs that a responsible thing to do? Etc., etc.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo I was thinking about peace,
p56
aVand then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace?
p57
aVAnd that was when I had the idea.
p58
aVThere was no starting point for peace.
p59
aVThere was no day of global unity.
p60
aVThere was no day of intercultural cooperation.
p61
aVThere was no day when humanity came together,
p62
aVseparate in all of those things
p63
aVand just shared it together \u2014
p64
aVthat we're in this together,
p65
aVand that if we united and we interculturally cooperated,
p66
aVthen that might be the key to humanity's survival.
p67
aVThat might shift the level of consciousness
p68
aVaround the fundamental issues that humanity faces \u2014
p69
aVif we did it just for a day.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo obviously we didn't have any money.
p72
aVI was living at my mom's place.
p73
aVAnd we started writing letters to everybody.
p74
aVYou very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do
p75
aVto fathom that out.
p76
aVHow do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world
p77
aVto create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,
p78
aVthe 21st of September?
p79
aVAnd I wanted it to be the 21st of September
p80
aVbecause it was my granddad's favorite number.
p81
aVHe was a prisoner of war.
p82
aVHe saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.
p83
aVIt poisoned his blood. He died when I was 11.
p84
aVSo he was like my hero.
p85
aVAnd the reason why 21 was the number is
p86
aV700 men left, 23 came back,
p87
aVtwo died on the boat and 21 hit the ground.
p88
aVAnd that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo we began this journey,
p91
aVand we launched it in 1999.
p92
aVAnd we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors,
p93
aVNobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths,
p94
aVvarious organizations \u2014 literally wrote to everybody.
p95
aVAnd very quickly, some letters started coming back.
p96
aVAnd we started to build this case.
p97
aVAnd I remember the first letter.
p98
aVOne of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama.
p99
aVAnd of course we didn't have the money; we were playing guitars
p100
aVand getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [this mail].
p101
aVA letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying,
p102
aV"This is an amazing thing. Come and see me.
p103
aVI'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace."
p104
aVAnd we didn't have money for the flight.
p105
aVAnd I rang Sir Bob Ayling, who was CEO of BA at the time,
p106
aVand said, "Mate, we've got this invitation.
p107
aVCould you give me a flight? Because we're going to go see him."
p108
aVAnd of course, we went and saw him and it was amazing.
p109
aVAnd then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd actually, let me go back to that slide,
p112
aVbecause when we launched it in 1999 \u2014
p113
aVthis idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence \u2014
p114
aVwe invited thousands of people.
p115
aVWell not thousands \u2014 hundreds of people, lots of people \u2014
p116
aVall the press, because we were going to try and create
p117
aVthe first ever World Peace Day, a peace day.
p118
aVAnd we invited everybody,
p119
aVand no press showed up.
p120
aVThere were 114 people there \u2014 they were mostly my friends and family.
p121
aVAnd that was kind of like the launch of this thing.
p122
aVBut it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing.
p123
aVFor me, it was really about the process.
p124
aVIt wasn't about the end result.
p125
aVAnd that's the beautiful thing about the camera.
p126
aVThey used to say the pen is mightier than the sword. I think the camera is.
p127
aVAnd just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing
p128
aVand really empowering actually.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo anyway, we began the journey.
p131
aVAnd here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva.
p132
aVI'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long,
p133
aVbecause every time I saw Kofi Annan,
p134
aVI was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it,
p135
aVand that was kind of what was going on.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVYeah, I'm not worried about it now.
p138
aVSo Mary Robinson,
p139
aVshe said to me, "Listen, this is an idea whose time has come. This must be created."
p140
aVKofi Annan said, "This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground."
p141
aVThe OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim,
p142
aVsaid, "I must get the African countries involved."
p143
aVDr. Oscar Arias, Nobel Peace laureate,
p144
aVpresident now of Costa Rica,
p145
aVsaid, "I'll do everything that I can."
p146
aVSo I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States.
p147
aVI met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks,
p148
aVand so on and so on and so on \u2014
p149
aVwhile I was building the case
p150
aVto prove whether this idea
p151
aVwould make sense.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd then we were listening to the people. We were documenting everywhere.
p154
aV76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited.
p155
aVAnd I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone.
p156
aVI've recorded 44,000 young people.
p157
aVI've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts.
p158
aVI'm really clear about how young people feel
p159
aVwhen you talk to them about this idea
p160
aVof having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world
p161
aVthrough their poetry, their art, their literature,
p162
aVtheir music, their sport, whatever it might be.
p163
aVAnd we were listening to everybody.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd it was an incredibly thing, working with the U.N.
p166
aVand working with NGOs and building this case.
p167
aVI felt that I was presenting a case
p168
aVon behalf of the global community
p169
aVto try and create this day.
p170
aVAnd the stronger the case and the more detailed it was,
p171
aVthe better chance we had of creating this day.
p172
aVAnd it was this stuff, this,
p173
aVwhere I actually was in the beginning
p174
aVkind of thinking no matter what happened, it didn't actually matter.
p175
aVIt didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace.
p176
aVThe fact is that, if I tried and it didn't work,
p177
aVthen I could make a statement
p178
aVabout how unwilling the global community is to unite \u2014
p179
aVuntil, it was in Somalia, picking up that young girl.
p180
aVAnd this young child
p181
aVwho'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic,
p182
aVand that young boy who was a child soldier,
p183
aVwho told me he'd killed people \u2014 he was about 12 \u2014
p184
aVthese things made me realize
p185
aVthat this was not a film that I could just stop.
p186
aVAnd that actually, at that moment something happened to me,
p187
aVwhich obviously made me go, "I'm going to document.
p188
aVIf this is the only film that I ever make,
p189
aVI'm going to document until this becomes a reality."
p190
aVBecause we've got to stop, we've got to do something
p191
aVwhere we unite \u2014
p192
aVseparate from all the politics and religion
p193
aVthat, as a young person, is confusing me.
p194
aVI don't know how to get involved in that process.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd then on the seventh of September, I was invited to New York.
p197
aVThe Costa Rican government and the British government
p198
aVhad put forward to the United Nations General Assembly,
p199
aVwith 54 co-sponsors,
p200
aVthe idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,
p201
aVthe 21st of September, as a fixed calendar date,
p202
aVand it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world.
p203
aV(Applause)
p204
aVYeah, but there were hundreds of individuals, obviously, who made that a reality.
p205
aVAnd thank you to all of them.
p206
aVThat was an incredible moment.
p207
aVI was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen.
p208
aVAnd as I mentioned, when it started,
p209
aVwe were at the Globe, and there was no press.
p210
aVAnd now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story."
p211
aVAnd suddenly, we started to institutionalize this day.
p212
aa(lp213
VKofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th
p214
aVto do a press conference.
p215
aVAnd it was 8:00 AM when I stood there.
p216
aVAnd I was waiting for him to come down, and I knew that he was on his way.
p217
aVAnd obviously he never came down. The statement was never made.
p218
aVThe world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence.
p219
aVAnd it was obviously a tragic moment
p220
aVfor the thousands of people who lost their lives,
p221
aVthere and then subsequently all over the world.
p222
aVIt never happened.
p223
aVAnd I remember thinking,
p224
aV"This is exactly why, actually,
p225
aVwe have to work even harder.
p226
aVAnd we have to make this day work.
p227
aVIt's been created; nobody knows.
p228
aVBut we have to continue this journey,
p229
aVand we have to tell people,
p230
aVand we have to prove it can work."
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd I left New York freaked,
p233
aVbut actually empowered.
p234
aVAnd I felt inspired
p235
aVby the possibilities
p236
aVthat if it did, then maybe we wouldn't see things like that.
p237
aVI remember putting that film out and going to cynics.
p238
aVI was showing the film,
p239
aVand I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered
p240
aVby some guys having watched the film \u2014
p241
aVthat it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything.
p242
aVIt's not going to work; you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan;
p243
aVthe Taliban won't listen, etc., etc.
p244
aVIt's just symbolism.
p245
aVAnd that was even worse
p246
aVthan actually what had just happened in many ways,
p247
aVbecause it couldn't not work.
p248
aVI'd spoken in Somalia, Burundi, Gaza, the West Bank,
p249
aVIndia, Sri Lanka, Congo, wherever it was,
p250
aVand they'd all tell me, "If you can create a window of opportunity,
p251
aVwe can move aid, we can vaccinate children.
p252
aVChildren can lead their projects.
p253
aVThey can unite. They can come together. If people would stop, lives will be saved."
p254
aVThat's what I'd heard.
p255
aVAnd I'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd so I went back to the United Nations.
p258
aVI decided that I'd continue filming and make another movie.
p259
aVAnd I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years.
p260
aVWe started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system,
p261
aVgovernments and NGOs,
p262
aVtrying desperately to find somebody
p263
aVto come forward and have a go at it,
p264
aVsee if we could make it possible.
p265
aVAnd after lots and lots of meetings obviously,
p266
aVI'm delighted that this man, Ahmad Fawzi,
p267
aVone of my heroes and mentors really,
p268
aVhe managed to get UNICEF involved.
p269
aVAnd UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go."
p270
aVAnd then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan.
p271
aVIt was historical. Could it work in Afghanistan
p272
aVwith UNAMA and WHO
p273
aVand civil society, etc., etc., etc.?
p274
aVAnd I was getting it all on film and I was recording it,
p275
aVand I was thinking, "This is it. This is the possibility of it maybe working.
p276
aVBut even if it doesn't, at least the door is open
p277
aVand there's a chance."
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd so I went back to London,
p280
aVand I went and saw this chap, Jude Law.
p281
aVAnd I saw him because he was an actor, I was an actor,
p282
aVI had a connection to him,
p283
aVbecause we needed to get to the press, we needed this attraction,
p284
aVwe needed the media to be involved.
p285
aVBecause if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen
p286
aVand there'd be more \u2014
p287
aVwhen we got into certain areas,
p288
aVmaybe there would be more people interested.
p289
aVAnd maybe we'd be helped financially a little bit more,
p290
aVwhich had been desperately difficult.
p291
aVI won't go into that.
p292
aVSo Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you."
p293
aa(lp294
VWhile I was filming these statements, he said to me, "Where are you going next?"
p295
aVI said, "I'm going to go to Afghanistan." He said, "Really?"
p296
aVAnd I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest.
p297
aVSo I said to him, "Do you want to come with me?
p298
aVIt'd be really interesting if you came.
p299
aVIt would help and bring attention.
p300
aVAnd that attention
p301
aVwould help leverage the situation,
p302
aVas well as all of the other sides of it."
p303
aVI think there's a number of pillars to success.
p304
aVOne is you've got to have a great idea.
p305
aVThe other is you've got to have a constituency, you've got to have finance,
p306
aVand you've got to be able to raise awareness.
p307
aVAnd actually I could never raise awareness by myself, no matter what I'd achieved.
p308
aVSo these guys were absolutely crucial.
p309
aVSo he said yes,
p310
aVand we found ourselves in Afghanistan.
p311
aa(lp312
VIt was a really incredible thing that when we landed there,
p313
aVI was talking to various people, and they were saying to me,
p314
aV"You've got to get everybody involved here.
p315
aVYou can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work."
p316
aVAnd we did, and we traveled around,
p317
aVand we spoke to elders, we spoke to doctors, we spoke to nurses,
p318
aVwe held press conferences, we went out with soldiers,
p319
aVwe sat down with ISAF, we sat down with NATO,
p320
aVwe sat down with the U.K. government.
p321
aVI mean, we basically sat down with everybody \u2014
p322
aVin and out of schools with ministers of education,
p323
aVholding these press conferences,
p324
aVwhich of course, now were loaded with press, everybody was there.
p325
aVThere was an interest in what was going on.
p326
aVThis amazing woman, Fatima Gailani, was absolutely instrumental in what went on
p327
aVas she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians.
p328
aVAnd her Afghan network
p329
aVwas just absolutely everywhere.
p330
aVAnd she was really crucial in getting the message in.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd then we went home. We'd sort of done it.
p333
aVWe had to wait now and see what happened.
p334
aVAnd I got home,
p335
aVand I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me
p336
aVfrom the Taliban.
p337
aVAnd that letter basically said, "We'll observe this day.
p338
aVWe will observe this day.
p339
aVWe see it as a window of opportunity.
p340
aVAnd we will not engage. We're not going to engage."
p341
aVAnd that meant that humanitarian workers
p342
aVwouldn't be kidnapped or killed.
p343
aVAnd then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance.
p344
aVAnd days later,
p345
aV1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio
p346
aVas a consequence of everybody stopping.
p347
aV(Applause)
p348
aVAnd like the General Assembly,
p349
aVobviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment.
p350
aa(lp351
VAnd so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together
p352
aVbecause we had to go back.
p353
aVWe put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects.
p354
aVWe went back to Afghanistan,
p355
aVbecause the next year was coming, and we wanted to support.
p356
aVBut more importantly, we wanted to go back,
p357
aVbecause these people in Afghanistan were the heroes.
p358
aVThey were the people who believed in peace
p359
aVand the possibilities of it, etc., etc. \u2014 and they made it real.
p360
aVAnd we wanted to go back and show them the film
p361
aVand say, "Look, you guys made this possible. And thank you very much."
p362
aVAnd we gave the film over.
p363
aVObviously it was shown, and it was amazing.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd then that year, that year, 2008,
p366
aVthis ISAF statement from Kabul, Afghanistan, September 17th:
p367
aV"General Stanley McChrystal,
p368
aVcommander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan,
p369
aVannounced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations
p370
aVon the 21st of September."
p371
aVThey were saying they would stop.
p372
aVAnd then there was this other statement
p373
aVthat came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety
p374
aVsaying that, in Afghanistan,
p375
aVbecause of this work,
p376
aVthe violence was down by 70 percent.
p377
aV70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least.
p378
aVAnd that completely blew my mind
p379
aValmost more than anything.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd I remember being stuck in New York, this time because of the volcano,
p382
aVwhich was obviously much less harmful.
p383
aVAnd I was there thinking about what was going on.
p384
aVAnd I kept thinking about this 70 percent.
p385
aV70 percent reduction in violence \u2014
p386
aVin what everyone said was completely impossible
p387
aVand you couldn't do.
p388
aVAnd that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan,
p389
aVthen surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere.
p390
aVWe have to go for a global truce.
p391
aVWe have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence
p392
aVand go for a global truce,
p393
aVgo for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities,
p394
aVboth domestically and internationally, ever recorded.
p395
aa(lp396
VThat's exactly what we must do.
p397
aVAnd on the 21st of September this year,
p398
aVwe're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena
p399
aVto go for that process,
p400
aVto try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities.
p401
aVAnd we will utilize all kinds of things \u2014
p402
aVhave a dance and social media
p403
aVand visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition.
p404
aVAnd it's in the six official languages of the United Nations.
p405
aVAnd we'll globally link with government, inter-government,
p406
aVnon-government, education, unions, sports.
p407
aVAnd you can see the education box there.
p408
aVWe've got resources at the moment in 174 countries
p409
aVtrying to get young people to be the driving force
p410
aVbehind the vision of that global truce.
p411
aVAnd obviously the life-saving is increased, the concepts help.
p412
aa(lp413
VLinking up with the Olympics \u2014
p414
aVI went and saw Seb Coe. I said, "London 2012 is about truce.
p415
aVUltimately, that's what it's about."
p416
aVWhy don't we all team up? Why don't we bring truce to life?
p417
aVWhy don't you support the process of the largest ever global truce?
p418
aVWe'll make a new film about this process.
p419
aVWe'll utilize sport and football.
p420
aVOn the Day of Peace, there's thousands of football matches all played,
p421
aVfrom the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be.
p422
aVSo, utilizing all of these ways
p423
aVto inspire individual action.
p424
aVAnd ultimately, we have to try that.
p425
aVWe have to work together.
p426
aa(lp427
VAnd when I stand here in front of all of you,
p428
aVand the people who will watch these things,
p429
aVI'm excited, on behalf of everybody I've met,
p430
aVthat there is a possibility that our world could unite,
p431
aVthat we could come together as one,
p432
aVthat we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues,
p433
aVbrought about by individuals.
p434
aVI was with Brahimi, Ambassador Brahimi.
p435
aVI think he's one of the most incredible men
p436
aVin relation to international politics \u2014 in Afghanistan, in Iraq.
p437
aVHe's an amazing man.
p438
aVAnd I sat with him a few weeks ago.
p439
aVAnd I said to him, "Mr. Brahimi, is this nuts, going for a global truce?
p440
aVIs this possible? Is it really possible that we could do this?"
p441
aVHe said, "It's absolutely possible."
p442
aVI said, "What would you do?
p443
aVWould you go to governments and lobby and use the system?"
p444
aVHe said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals."
p445
aVIt's all about the individuals.
p446
aVIt's all about you and me.
p447
aVIt's all about partnerships.
p448
aVIt's about your constituencies; it's about your businesses.
p449
aVBecause together, by working together,
p450
aVI seriously think we can start to change things.
p451
aa(lp452
VAnd there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience, and I don't know where he is,
p453
aVwho said to me a few days ago \u2014 because I did a little rehearsal \u2014
p454
aVand he said, "I've been thinking about this day
p455
aVand imagining it as a square
p456
aVwith 365 squares,
p457
aVand one of them is white."
p458
aVAnd it then made me think about a glass of water, which is clear.
p459
aVIf you put one drop,
p460
aVone drop of something, in that water,
p461
aVit'll change it forever.
p462
aa(lp463
VBy working together, we can create peace one day.
p464
aVThank you TED. Thank you.
p465
aa(lp466
V(Applause)
p467
aa(lp468
VThank you.
p469
aa(lp470
V(Applause)
p471
aa(lp472
VThanks a lot.
p473

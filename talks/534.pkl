VThis is a sculpture I made,
p5
aVwhich is a way of, kind of, freeing a form
p6
aVinto an object that has different degrees of freedom.
p7
aVSo, it can balance on a point.
p8
aVThis is a bronze ball,
p9
aVan aluminum arm here,
p10
aVand then this wooden disk.
p11
aVAnd the wooden disk was really thought about
p12
aVas something that you'd want to hold on to,
p13
aVand that would glide easily through your hands.
p14
aVThe aluminum is because it's very light.
p15
aVThe bronze is nice hard, durable material
p16
aVthat could roll on the ground.
p17
aVInside of the bronze ball
p18
aVthere's a lead weight
p19
aVthat is free-swinging on an axle
p20
aVthat's on two bearings
p21
aVthat pass in between, across it,
p22
aVlike this, that counterbalance this weight.
p23
aVSo it allows it to roll.
p24
aVAnd the sphere has that balance property
p25
aVthat it always sort of stays still
p26
aVand looks the same from every direction.
p27
aVBut if you put something on top of it,
p28
aVit disbalances it. And so it would tip over.
p29
aVBut in this case because
p30
aVthe interior is free-swinging
p31
aVin relation to the sphere,
p32
aVit can stand up on one point.
p33
aVAnd then there was a second level to this object,
p34
aVwhich is that it \u2014
p35
aVI wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in,
p36
aVwhich is the diameter of the Moon
p37
aVand the diameter of the Earth
p38
aVin proportion to each other.
p39
aa(lp40
VI was exploring, really early on,
p41
aVwanting to make things float in the air.
p42
aVAnd I thought up a lot of ideas.
p43
aVThis is sculpture that I made that \u2014
p44
aVit's magnetically levitated.
p45
aVThe thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.
p46
aVNormally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum.
p47
aVBut it's uh \u2014 let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit
p48
aVwithout, um \u2014 oops.
p49
aVSo this is just floating,
p50
aVfloating on a permanent magnetic field,
p51
aVwhich stabilizes it in all directions.
p52
aVExcept there is a slight tether here,
p53
aVwhich keeps it from going over the top of its field.
p54
aVIt's sort of surfing on a magnetic field
p55
aVat the crest of a wave.
p56
aVAnd that's what supports the object and keeps it stable.
p57
aa(lp58
VI think we could roll the tape, admin.
p59
aVI have a sort of a collection of videos
p60
aVthat I took of different installations, which I could narrate.
p61
aVThis is a sculpture of the Sun
p62
aVand the Earth, in proportion.
p63
aVRepresenting that eight and a half minutes
p64
aVthat it takes light and gravity to connect the two.
p65
aVSo here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter
p66
aVthat was turned of solid bronze.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd here is a similar sculpture.
p69
aVThat's the Sun at that end.
p70
aVAnd then in a series of 55 balls,
p71
aVit reduces, proportionately \u2014 each ball
p72
aVand the spaces between them
p73
aVreduce proportionately,
p74
aVuntil they get down to this little Earth.
p75
aVThis is in a sculpture park in Taejon.
p76
aa(lp77
VThis one is about the Moon
p78
aVand then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also.
p79
aVThis is a little stone ball, floating.
p80
aVAs you can see the little tether,
p81
aVthat it's also magnetically levitated.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd then this is the first part of \u2014
p84
aVthis is 109 spheres,
p85
aVsince the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth.
p86
aVAnd so this is the size of the Sun.
p87
aVAnd then each of these little spheres
p88
aVis the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.
p89
aVIt's made up of 16 concentric shells. Each one has 92 spheres.
p90
aVThis is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.
p91
aVI was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist. (Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VSo this, again, is on the subject \u2014
p94
aVa slice from the equator of the Earth.
p95
aVAnd then the Moon in the center,
p96
aVand it's floating. And this is in France.
p97
aa(lp98
VThis is in Sapporo.
p99
aVIt's balancing on a shaft and a ball,
p100
aVright at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity,
p101
aVwhich means that the lower half of the object
p102
aVis just a little bit more weighty.
p103
aVSo you can see it rotating here.
p104
aVIt weighs about a ton or over a ton.
p105
aVIt's made of stainless steel, quite thick.
p106
aVBut it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.
p107
aVIt's susceptible to motion by the air currents.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis is another species of work that I do.
p110
aVThese are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended,
p111
aVbut they have magnets horizontally in them
p112
aVthat make them all like compasses.
p113
aVSo all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south.
p114
aVAnd the blue side, the compliment, faces the other way.
p115
aVSo as you turn around you're seeing different colors.
p116
aa(lp117
VThis is based on the structure of a diamond.
p118
aVIt was a diamond cell structure
p119
aVwas the point of departure.
p120
aVAnd then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows
p121
aVbetween the atoms.
p122
aVAnd so I placed one more element of each one of them.
p123
aVThese were white spheres.
p124
aVThen I had video projectors
p125
aVthat were projecting intermittently onto the spheres.
p126
aVSo they would catch parts of the images,
p127
aVand make sort of three-dimensional color volumes,
p128
aVas you walk through it, through the object.
p129
aa(lp130
VThis is something I did
p131
aVof a tactile communication system.
p132
aVIt was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture,
p133
aVand then putting it into a communication system.
p134
aVThis is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball,
p135
aVthat would be directed around the room
p136
aVby a computer.
p137
aa(lp138
VThis is a clock I designed.
p139
aVIt has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here.
p140
aVIt turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd then, this is like
p143
aVprojects that are harder to build.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVThis has a diamond-bottomed lake.
p146
aVSo it's a floating island
p147
aVwith water, fresh water,
p148
aVthat can fly from place to place.
p149
aVThis would be grown, I suppose,
p150
aVwith nanotechnology in the future sometime.
p151
aa(lp152
VIn the course of doing my work
p153
aVI sort of have a broad range of interests.
p154
aVAnd some of it is just the idea of creating media \u2014
p155
aVmedia as a sculpture,
p156
aVsomething that would keep the sculpture
p157
aVfresh and ever-changing,
p158
aVby just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.
p159
aVAnd I had a lot of \u2014
p160
aValways interested in the concept of a crystal ball.
p161
aVAnd the idea that you could see things
p162
aVinside of a crystal ball and predict the future \u2014
p163
aVor a television set, where it's sort of like a magic box
p164
aVwhere anything can appear.
p165
aVI had thought about, a long time ago,
p166
aVin the late '60s \u2014 when I was just starting out,
p167
aVI was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's
p168
aVgrand project for an electric globe
p169
aVacross from the United Nations \u2014
p170
aVand other things that were happening,
p171
aVthe space program at that time,
p172
aVand Whole Earth Catalog, things like that.
p173
aVI was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets
p174
aVthat could be linked to orbiting camera satellites.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo if we could roll the next film here.
p177
aVThis has evolved over the years
p178
aVin a lot of different iterations.
p179
aVBut this the current version of it,
p180
aVis a flying airship
p181
aVthat is about 35 meters in diameter,
p182
aVabout 110 feet in diameter.
p183
aVThe whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes,
p184
aVred, blue, and green,
p185
aVthat allow you to have a high-resolution picture, visible in daylight.
p186
aa(lp187
VI came with a plan.
p188
aVI brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment
p189
aVto do a feasibility study,
p190
aVand they analyzed it,
p191
aVand came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it.
p192
aVSo we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen.
p193
aVThis is the control room inside of the ship.
p194
aVThe idea of this air genie is,
p195
aVit's something that can just transform and become anything.
p196
aVIt's like a traveling show.
p197
aVIt has speakers on it. And it has cameras
p198
aVover the surface of it.
p199
aVSo it can see its environment,
p200
aVand then it can mimic its environment and disappear.
p201
aVHere the legs are retracting.
p202
aVThe cabin is open or closed, as you like.
p203
aVIt weighs about 20 tons.
p204
aVIt has on-board generators.
p205
aVIt can generate about a million kilowatts,
p206
aVin order to be bright enough
p207
aVto be visible in daylight.
p208
aVThe idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show.
p209
aVIt really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting.
p210
aVThere would be on board a crew of artists, musicians,
p211
aVthat would allow the thing to become
p212
aVactually kind of a conscious object
p213
aVthat would respond to the moment,
p214
aVand to interact as an entity
p215
aVthat was aware, that could communicate.
p216
aVIt's completely silent and nonpolluting.
p217
aVIt has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.
p218
aVIt could be interacted with large crowds in different ways.
p219
aa(lp220
VPrimarily I would be interested in
p221
aVhow it would interact with, say,
p222
aVgoing to a college campus,
p223
aVand then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences,
p224
aVthe world, the situation of the globe.
p225
aVThe default image on the object
p226
aVwould probably be a high-resolution Earth image.
p227
aVBut then one could interact with that
p228
aVand show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations \u2014
p229
aVall of the things that we're concerned with today.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd then at night the idea is that
p232
aVit would be used as kind of a rave situation,
p233
aVwhere the people could cut loose,
p234
aVand the music and the lights, and everything.
p235
aVSo it could land in a park, for example.
p236
aVOr this could represent a college green.
p237
aVAnd then it would have a corresponding website
p238
aVthat would show the itinerary of this.
p239
aVAnd so interacting with the same kind of imagery.
p240
aVIt would also be able to be an open code,
p241
aVso people could interact with it.
p242
aVIt would be forum for people's ideas about
p243
aVwhat they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.
p244
aVSo that's pretty much it.
p245
aVOkay. Thank you.
p246
aV(Applause)

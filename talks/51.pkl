VThe old story about climate protection is that it's costly,
p5
aVor it would have been done already.
p6
aVSo government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.
p7
aVThe new story about climate protection
p8
aVis that it's not costly, but profitable.
p9
aVThis was a simple sign error,
p10
aVbecause it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel,
p11
aVas is well known to companies that do it all the time \u2014
p12
aVfor example, Dupont, SD micro electronics.
p13
aVMany other firms \u2014 IBM \u2014 are reducing their energy intensity
p14
aVroutinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants,
p15
aVand they get their money back in two or three years.
p16
aVThat's called a profit.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it,
p19
aVit would be expensive, or we would have done it already,
p20
aVbecause markets are essentially perfect.
p21
aVIf, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation,
p22
aVand nobody could make any money.
p23
aVBut the new story about oil
p24
aVis the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil \u2014
p25
aVnot just incrementally, but completely \u2014
p26
aVquite the contrary. The United States, for example,
p27
aVcan completely eliminate its use of oil
p28
aVand rejuvenate the economy at the same time,
p29
aVled by business for profit,
p30
aVbecause it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil
p31
aVthan to keep on buying it.
p32
aVThis process will also be catalyzed by the military
p33
aVfor its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict,
p34
aVparticularly over oil.
p35
aa(lp36
VThis thesis is set out in a book called "Winning the Oil Endgame"
p37
aVthat four colleagues and I wrote
p38
aVand have posted for free at Oilendgame.com \u2014
p39
aVabout 170,000 downloads so far.
p40
aVAnd it was co-sponsored by the Pentagon \u2014
p41
aVit's independent, it's peer-reviewed
p42
aVand all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal.
p43
aVNow, a bit of economic history, I think, may be helpful here.
p44
aVAround 1850, one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling.
p45
aVAnd whale oil lit practically every building.
p46
aVBut in the nine years before Drake struck oil, in 1859,
p47
aVat least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared,
p48
aVthanks to fatal competitors, chiefly oil and gas made from coal,
p49
aVto which the whalers had not been paying attention.
p50
aVSo, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customers
p51
aVbefore they ran out of whales.
p52
aVThe remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators
p53
aVand profit-maximizing capitalists.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd it's funny \u2014 it feels a bit like this now for oil.
p58
aVWe've been spending the last few decades
p59
aVaccumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies
p60
aVfor saving and substituting for oil,
p61
aVand no one had bothered to add them up before.
p62
aVSo when we did, we found some very surprising things.
p63
aVNow, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil.
p64
aVBoth national competitiveness and national security are at risk.
p65
aVOn the competitiveness front,
p66
aVwe all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together.
p67
aVAnd serious competition from Europe, from Korea,
p68
aVand next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars.
p69
aVHow long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new
p70
aVwally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car?
p71
aVMaybe a decade, according to my friends in Detroit.
p72
aVChina has an energy policy
p73
aVbased on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology.
p74
aVThey're not going to export your uncle's Buick.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd after that comes India.
p77
aVThe point here is, these cars are going to be made super efficient.
p78
aVThe question is, who will make them?
p79
aVWill we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil,
p80
aVor will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars?
p81
aVThat seems to make more sense.
p82
aVThe more we keep on using the oil, particularly the imported oil,
p83
aVthe more we face a very obvious array of problems.
p84
aVOur analysis assumes that they all cost nothing,
p85
aVbut nothing is not the right number.
p86
aVIt could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.
p87
aVAnd one of the worst of these
p88
aVis what it does to our standing in the world
p89
aVif other countries think that everything we do is about oil,
p90
aVif we have to treat countries that have oil
p91
aVdifferently than countries that don't have oil.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd our military get quite unhappy
p94
aVwith having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan
p95
aVwhen what they actually signed up for
p96
aVwas to protect American citizens.
p97
aVThey don't like fighting over oil,
p98
aVthey don't like being in the sands
p99
aVand they don't like where the oil money goes
p100
aVand what sort of instability it creates.
p101
aVNow, in order to avoid these problems,
p102
aVwhatever you think they're worth, it's actually not that complicated.
p103
aVWe can save half the oil by using it more efficiently,
p104
aVat a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel.
p105
aVAnd then we can replace the other half
p106
aVwith a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas.
p107
aVAnd that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel.
p108
aVAnd compared with the official forecast,
p109
aVthat oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025,
p110
aVwhich is half of what we've been paying lately,
p111
aa(lp112
Vthat will save 70 billion dollars a year, starting quite soon.
p113
aVNow, in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars:
p114
aVhalf of it to retool the car, truck and plane industries;
p115
aVhalf of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry.
p116
aVIn the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural.
p117
aVAnd protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making.
p118
aVAnd we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year.
p119
aVSo that's a very handsome return.
p120
aVIt's financeable in the private capital market.
p121
aVBut if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned,
p122
aVto happen sooner and with higher confidence,
p123
aVthen \u2014 and also to expand choice and manage risk \u2014
p124
aVthen you might like some light-handed public policies
p125
aVthat support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic.
p126
aVAnd these policies work fine without taxes, subsidies or mandates.
p127
aVThey make a little net money for the treasury.
p128
aa(lp129
VThey have a broad trans-ideological appeal,
p130
aVand because we want them actually to happen,
p131
aVwe figured out ways to do them
p132
aVthat do not require much, if any, federal legislation,
p133
aVand can, indeed, be done administratively or at a state level.
p134
aVJust to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem,
p135
aVnamely, light vehicles,
p136
aVhere are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag,
p137
aVand all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive.
p138
aVYou can sort of have it all with these things.
p139
aVFor example, this Opel two-seater
p140
aVdoes 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon.
p141
aVThis muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light
p142
aVthat does zero to 60 in well under four seconds,
p143
aVand still gets 32 miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM \u2014
p146
aV84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater.
p147
aVWell, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles
p148
aVcosts about 57 cents per saved gallon.
p149
aVBut it's even a better deal for heavy trucks,
p150
aVwhere you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon,
p151
aVwith better aerodynamics and tires and engines, and so on,
p152
aVand taking out weight so you can put it into payload.
p153
aVSo you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return.
p154
aVThen you can go even further, almost tripling efficiency
p155
aVwith some operational improvements,
p156
aVdouble the big haulers' margins.
p157
aVAnd we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market.
p158
aa(lp159
VIn the airplane business, it's again a similar story
p160
aVwhere the first 20 percent fuel saving is free,
p161
aVas Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner.
p162
aVBut then the next generation of planes saves about half.
p163
aVAgain, much cheaper than buying the fuel.
p164
aVAnd if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body,
p165
aVkind of a flying wing with internal engines,
p166
aVthen you get about a factor three efficiency improvement
p167
aVat comparable or lower cost.
p168
aVLet me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks,
p169
aVbecause we all know the most about those;
p170
aVprobably everybody here drives one.
p171
aVAnd yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan,
p172
aVof all the fuel energy you feed into the car,
p173
aVseven-eighths never gets to the wheels;
p174
aVit's lost first in the engine, idling at zero miles a gallon,
p175
aVthe power train and accessories.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo then of the energy that does get to the wheels,
p178
aVonly an eighth of it, half of that, goes to heat the tires on the road,
p179
aVor to heat the air the car pushes aside.
p180
aVAnd only this little bit, only six percent
p181
aVactually ends up accelerating the car
p182
aVand then heating the brakes when you stop.
p183
aVIn fact, since 95 percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver,
p184
aVless than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver.
p185
aVThis is not very gratifying
p186
aVafter more than a century of devoted engineering effort.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VMoreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car.
p193
aVAnd it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels
p194
aVis going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy
p195
aVgetting that energy to the wheels.
p196
aVSo there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter.
p197
aVAnd the reason this has not been very seriously examined before
p198
aVis there was a common assumption in the industry that \u2014
p199
aVwell, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car,
p200
aVand it would cost a lot more to make,
p201
aVbecause the only way we know how to make cars much lighter
p202
aVwas to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium.
p203
aVBut these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials.
p204
aa(lp205
VFor example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites
p206
aVin sporting goods.
p207
aVAnd it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety.
p208
aVHere's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf.
p209
aVThe Golf was totaled.
p210
aVThe McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel.
p211
aVThey'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later.
p212
aVBut if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour,
p213
aVthe entire crash energy would be absorbed
p214
aVby a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones,
p215
aVweighing a total of 15 pounds, hidden in the front end.
p216
aVBecause these materials could actually absorb
p217
aVsix to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel,
p218
aVand do so a lot more smoothly.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight.
p221
aVWe could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light.
p222
aVWhereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient.
p223
aVAnd when you make them light in the right way,
p224
aVthat can be simpler and cheaper to make.
p225
aVYou can end up saving money, and lives, and oil, all at the same time.
p226
aVI showed here two years ago
p227
aVa little bit about a design of your basic, uncompromised,
p228
aVquintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle \u2014
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aV\u2014 and this is a complete virtual design
p231
aVthat is production-costed manufacturable.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd the process needed to make it
p234
aVis actually coming toward the market quite nicely.
p235
aVWe figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer
p236
aVfor this very stiff, strong, carbon-composite material,
p237
aVand then ways to thermoform it,
p238
aVbecause it's a combination of carbon and nylon,
p239
aVinto whatever complex shapes you want,
p240
aVlike the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers.
p241
aVAnd the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified.
p242
aVBecause the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150.
p243
aVEach one is formed by one fairly cheap die set,
p244
aVinstead of four expensive ones for stamping steel.
p245
aVEach of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist.
p246
aVThey snap together like a kid's toy.
p247
aVSo you got rid of the body shop.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop.
p250
aVThose are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car.
p251
aVSo you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity
p252
aVthan the leanest plant in the industry, which GM has in Lansing.
p253
aVThe plant also gets smaller.
p254
aVNow, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil,
p255
aVincluding buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on,
p256
aVyou find that of the 28 million barrels a day
p257
aVthe government says we will need in 2025,
p258
aVwell, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then,
p259
aVwith another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over,
p260
aVat an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel,
p261
aVinstead of 26 for buying the oil.
p262
aVAnd then another six can be made robustly, competitively,
p263
aVfrom cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel,
p264
aVwithout interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production.
p265
aa(lp266
VThere is a huge amount of gas to be saved,
p267
aVabout half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price.
p268
aVAnd here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over.
p269
aVSo much, in fact, that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast
p270
aVfrom areas already approved,
p271
aVyou have only this little bit left, and let's see how we can meet that,
p272
aVbecause there's a pretty flexible menu of ways.
p273
aVWe could, of course, buy more efficiency.
p274
aVMaybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.
p275
aVOr wait to capture the second half of it.
p276
aVOr we could, of course, just get this little bit
p277
aVby continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil,
p278
aVor the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.
p279
aVBut they'll sell it to Japan and China instead,
p280
aVbecause we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't.
p281
aa(lp282
VOr we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance,
p283
aVor if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient,
p284
aVwe'd get rid of the domestic oil too.
p285
aVAnd that doesn't even count, for example,
p286
aVthat available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively
p287
aVmake enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country.
p288
aVSo we have lots of options.
p289
aVAnd the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible.
p290
aVNow, to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence,
p291
aVthere is a few ways government could help.
p292
aVFor example, fee-bates, a combination of a fee and a rebate
p293
aVin any size class of vehicle you want,
p294
aVcan increase the price of inefficient vehicles
p295
aVand correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles.
p296
aVYou're not paid to change size class.
p297
aVYou are paid to pick efficiency within a size class,
p298
aVin a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings
p299
aVrather than just the first two or three.
p300
aa(lp301
VThis expands choice rapidly in the market,
p302
aVand actually makes more money for automakers as well.
p303
aVI'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country
p304
aVby making it very cheaply possible for low-income families
p305
aVto get efficient, reliable, warranted new cars
p306
aVthat they could otherwise never get.
p307
aVAnd for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker,
p308
aVpreferably the dirtiest ones.
p309
aVThis creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit
p310
aVfrom customers they weren't going to get otherwise,
p311
aVbecause they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car.
p312
aVAnd Detroit will make money on every unit.
p313
aVIt turns out that if, say, African-American and white households
p314
aVhad the same car ownership,
p315
aVit would cut employment disparity about in half
p316
aVby providing better access to job opportunities.
p317
aVSo this is a huge social win, too.
p318
aa(lp319
VGovernments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year.
p320
aVThere are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power
p321
aVto bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster.
p322
aVAnd we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrot
p323
aVthat's worth stretching further for.
p324
aVFor example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker
p325
aVto sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier.
p326
aVThen the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes
p327
aVthey desperately need to cut their fuel bills,
p328
aVbut if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that,
p329
aVthere are ways to finance it.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes,
p332
aVso that if they were otherwise to come back in the air,
p333
aVthey would waste more oil,
p334
aVand block the uptake of efficient, new planes.
p335
aVThose part inefficient planes
p336
aVare worth more to society dead than alive.
p337
aVWe ought to take them out back and shoot them,
p338
aVand put bounty hunters after them.
p339
aVThen there's an important military role.
p340
aVThat in creating the move to high-volume,
p341
aVlow-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials,
p342
aVor for that matter, ultra-light steels
p343
aVthat are a good backup technology,
p344
aVthe military can do the trick it did
p345
aVin turning DARPAnet into the Internet.
p346
aVJust turn it over to the private sector, and we have an Internet.
p347
aa(lp348
VThe same for GPS.
p349
aVThe same for the modern semi-conductor industry.
p350
aVThat is, military science and technology that they need
p351
aVcan create the advanced materials-industrial cluster
p352
aVthat transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil,
p353
aVwhich would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil
p354
aVand advancing national and global security.
p355
aVThen we need to retool the car industry and do retraining,
p356
aVand shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains
p357
aVto shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates,
p358
aVand get out of our own way in other ways.
p359
aVAnd make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster.
p360
aa(lp361
VBut here's how the whole thing fits together.
p362
aVInstead of official forecasts of oil use
p363
aVand oil imports going forever up,
p364
aVthey can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency,
p365
aVdown steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks,
p366
aVall implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention.
p367
aVAnd if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there,
p368
aVwe are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.
p371
aVIn this eight-year period, 1977 to 85, when we last paid attention,
p372
aVthe economy grew 27 percent, oil use fell 17 percent,
p373
aVoil imports fell 50 percent, oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent.
p374
aVThey would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year.
p375
aVWell, that was with very old technologies and delivery methods.
p376
aa(lp377
VWe could rerun that play a lot better now.
p378
aVAnd yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC.
p379
aVOurs is on the demand side.
p380
aVWe are the Saudi Arabia of "nega-barrels." (Laughter)
p381
aVWe can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
VWhatever your reason for wanting to do this,
p386
aVwhether you're concerned about national security or price volatility \u2014
p387
aV(Laughter)
p388
aV\u2014 or jobs, or the planet, or your grand-kids,
p389
aVit seems to me that this is an oil endgame
p390
aVthat we should all be playing to win.
p391
aVPlease download your copy, and thank you very much.

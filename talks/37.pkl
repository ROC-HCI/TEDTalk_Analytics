VCharles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica,
p5
aVsaid the ideal encyclopedia should be radical \u2014
p6
aVit should stop being safe.
p7
aVBut if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962,
p8
aVit was anything but radical:
p9
aVstill a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia.
p10
aVWikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea,
p11
aVand that's for all of us to imagine a world
p12
aVin which every single person on the planet
p13
aVis given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd that's what we're doing.
p16
aVSo Wikipedia \u2014
p17
aVyou just saw the little demonstration of it \u2014
p18
aVit's a freely licensed encyclopedia.
p19
aVIt's written by thousands of volunteers
p20
aVall over the world in many, many languages.
p21
aVIt's written using wiki software \u2014
p22
aVwhich is the type of software he just demonstrated \u2014
p23
aVso anyone can quickly edit and save,
p24
aVand it goes live on the Internet immediately.
p25
aVAnd everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff.
p26
aVSo when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization,
p27
aVhe's exactly describing Wikipedia.
p28
aVAnd what I'm going to do today
p29
aVis tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation,
p32
aVwhich I founded,
p33
aVa nonprofit organization.
p34
aVAnd our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation,
p35
aVis to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.
p36
aVAnd so, if you think about what that means,
p37
aVit means a lot more than just building a cool website.
p38
aVWe're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide,
p39
aVpoverty worldwide,
p40
aVempowering people everywhere to have the information that they need
p41
aVto make good decisions.
p42
aVAnd so we're going to have to do a lot of work
p43
aVthat goes beyond just the Internet.
p44
aVAnd so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model,
p45
aVbecause that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to \u2014
p46
aVthey can take our content and do anything they like with it \u2014
p47
aVyou can copy it, redistribute it \u2014
p48
aVand you can do it commercially or non-commercially.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia
p51
aVall over the world.
p52
aVWe're funded by donations from the public,
p53
aVand one of the more interesting things about that
p54
aVis how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia.
p55
aVSo Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was.
p56
aVAnd I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is.
p57
aVBut first, I'll show you how big it is.
p58
aVSo we've got over 600,000 articles in English.
p59
aVWe've got two million total articles across many, many different languages.
p60
aVThe biggest languages are German, Japanese, French \u2014
p61
aVall the Western-European languages are quite big.
p62
aVBut only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web
p63
aVclusters to the English Wikipedia,
p64
aVwhich is surprising to a lot of people.
p65
aVA lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet,
p66
aVbut for us, we're truly global.
p67
aVWe're in many, many languages.
p68
aVHow popular we've gotten to be \u2014 we're a top-50 website
p69
aVand we're more popular than the New York Times.
p70
aVSo this is where we get to Yochai's discussion.
p71
aa(lp72
VThis shows the growth of Wikipedia \u2014 we're the blue line there \u2014
p73
aVand this is the New York Times over there.
p74
aVAnd what's interesting about this
p75
aVis the New York Times website is a huge, enormous corporate operation
p76
aVwith I have no idea how many hundreds of employees.
p77
aVWe have exactly one employee,
p78
aVand that employee is our lead software developer.
p79
aVAnd he's only been our employee since January 2005,
p80
aVall the other growth before that ...
p81
aVSo the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers.
p82
aVAll the editing is done by volunteers.
p83
aVAnd the way that we're organized
p84
aVis not like any traditional organization you can imagine.
p85
aVPeople are always asking, "Well, who's in charge of this?"
p86
aVor "Who does that?"
p87
aVAnd the answer is: anybody who wants to pitch in.
p88
aVIt's a very unusual and chaotic thing.
p89
aVWe've got over 90 servers now in three locations.
p90
aVThese are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online.
p91
aVI can go online any time of the day or night
p92
aVand see eight to 10 people waiting for me
p93
aVto ask a question or something, anything about the servers.
p94
aVYou could never afford to do this in a company.
p95
aVYou could never afford
p96
aVto have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day
p97
aVand do what we're doing at Wikipedia.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly,
p100
aVso it's really gotten to be a huge thing.
p101
aVAnd everything is managed by the volunteers.
p102
aVAnd the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.
p103
aVAnd that's essentially our main cost.
p104
aVWe could actually do without the employee.
p105
aVWe hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years
p106
aVand full-time at Wikipedia,
p107
aVso we actually hired him,
p108
aVso he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes.
p109
aVSo the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is,
p110
aVwhy isn't it all rubbish?
p111
aVWhy is the website as good as it is?
p112
aa(lp113
VFirst of all, how good is it?
p114
aVWell, it's pretty good.
p115
aVIt isn't perfect,
p116
aVbut it's much better than you would expect,
p117
aVgiven our completely chaotic model.
p118
aVSo when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me,
p119
aVyou think, "Oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish."
p120
aVBut when we've seen quality tests \u2014
p121
aVand there haven't been enough of these yet
p122
aVand I'm really encouraging people to do more,
p123
aVcomparing Wikipedia to traditional things \u2014
p124
aVwe win hands down.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo a German magazine compared German Wikipedia,
p127
aVwhich is much, much smaller than English,
p128
aVto Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial,
p129
aVand we won across the board.
p130
aVThey hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality,
p131
aVand we were very pleased with that result.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.
p134
aVThe media has covered this somewhat extensively.
p135
aVIt started out with an article in Red Herring.
p136
aVThe reporters called me up and they \u2014
p137
aVI mean, I have to say they spelled my name right,
p138
aVbut they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious,
p139
aVit's tearing apart the Wikipedia community.
p140
aVAnd so they quote me as saying,
p141
aV"They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia."
p142
aVWhat I actually said is they're not contentious at all.
p143
aVSo it's a slight misquote.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VThe articles were edited quite heavily.
p148
aVAnd it is true that we did have to lock the articles
p149
aVon a couple of occasions.
p150
aVTime magazine recently reported that
p151
aV"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken,
p152
aVand Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004."
p153
aVThis came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for \u2014
p154
aVoccasionally a little bit here and there.
p155
aVSo the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies
p156
aVthat you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community
p157
aVare not really controversies at all.
p158
aa(lp159
VArticles on controversial topics are edited a lot,
p160
aVbut they don't cause much controversy within the community.
p161
aVAnd the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality.
p162
aVThe real struggle is not between the right and the left \u2014
p163
aVthat's where most people assume \u2014
p164
aVbut it's between the party of the thoughtful
p165
aVand the party of the jerks.
p166
aVAnd no side of the political spectrum
p167
aVhas a monopoly on either of those qualities.
p168
aVThe actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident
p169
aVis that the Bush-Kerry articles
p170
aVwere locked less than one percent of the time in 2004,
p171
aVand it wasn't because they were contentious;
p172
aVit was just because there was routine vandalism \u2014
p173
aVwhich happens sometimes even on stage ...
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VSometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia
p178
aVand were amazed that it was fixed so quickly.
p179
aVAnd I said \u2014 you know, I always say, please don't do that.
p180
aVThat's not a good thing.
p181
aVSo how do we do this?
p182
aVHow do we manage the quality control?
p183
aVHow does it work?
p184
aa(lp185
VSo there's a few elements,
p186
aVmostly social policies and some elements of the software.
p187
aVSo the biggest and the most important thing
p188
aVis our neutral point of view policy.
p189
aVThis is something that I set down, from the very beginning,
p190
aVas a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable.
p191
aVIt's a social concept of cooperation,
p192
aVso we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity.
p193
aVThe reason for this is if we say
p194
aVwe're only going to write the "truth" about some topic,
p195
aVthat doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write,
p196
aVbecause I don't agree with you about what's the truth.
p197
aVBut we have this jargon term of neutrality,
p198
aVwhich has its own long history within the community,
p199
aVwhich basically says, any time there's a controversial issue,
p200
aVWikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue.
p201
aVWe should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it.
p202
aVSo this neutrality policy is really important for us
p203
aVbecause it empowers a community that is very diverse
p204
aVto come together and actually get some work done.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo we have very diverse contributors
p207
aVin terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds.
p208
aVBy having this firm neutrality policy,
p209
aVwhich is non-negotiable from the beginning,
p210
aVwe ensure that people can work together
p211
aVand that the entries don't become simply a war
p212
aVback and forth between the left and the right.
p213
aVIf you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo, real-time peer review.
p216
aVEvery single change on the site goes to the "Recent changes" page.
p217
aVSo as soon as he made his change, it went to the "Recent changes" page.
p218
aVThat recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel,
p219
aVwhich is an Internet chat channel
p220
aVthat people are monitoring with various software tools.
p221
aVAnd people can get RSS feeds \u2014
p222
aVthey can get email notifications of changes.
p223
aVAnd then users can set up their own personal watch list.
p224
aVSo my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists,
p225
aVbecause it is sometimes vandalized.
p226
aVAnd therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly,
p227
aVand then they'll just simply revert the change.
p228
aa(lp229
VThere's a "new pages feed," for example,
p230
aVso you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia
p231
aVand see every new page as it's created.
p232
aVThis is really important
p233
aVbecause a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted,
p234
aVyou know, "ASDFASDF."
p235
aVBut also, that's some of the most interesting and fun things,
p236
aVsome of the new articles.
p237
aVPeople will start an article on some interesting topic,
p238
aVother people will find that intriguing
p239
aVand jump in and help and make it much better.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo we do have edits by anonymous users,
p242
aVwhich is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia.
p243
aVSo, Chris was able to do his change \u2014 he didn't have to log in or anything;
p244
aVhe just went on the website and made a change.
p245
aVBut it turns out that only about 18 percent
p246
aVof all the edits to the website
p247
aVare done by anonymous users.
p248
aVAnd that's a really important thing to understand:
p249
aVthe vast majority of the edits that go on on the website
p250
aVare from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people
p251
aVwho are in constant communication.
p252
aVAnd we have over 40 IRC channels, 40 mailing lists.
p253
aVAll these people know each other.
p254
aVThey communicate. We have off-line meetings.
p255
aa(lp256
VThese are the people who are doing the bulk of the site,
p257
aVand they are, in a sense, semi-professionals at what they're doing.
p258
aVThe standards we set for ourselves
p259
aVare equal to or higher than professional standards of quality.
p260
aVWe don't always meet those standards, but that's what we're striving for.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd so that tight community is who really cares for the site,
p263
aVand these are some of the smartest people I've ever met.
p264
aVIt's my job to say that, but it's actually true.
p265
aVThe type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun
p266
aVtend to be pretty smart people.
p267
aa(lp268
VThe tools and the software: there's lots of tools that allow us \u2014
p269
aVallow us, meaning the community \u2014
p270
aVto self-monitor and to monitor all the work.
p271
aVThis is an example of a page history on "flat Earth,"
p272
aVand you can see some changes that were made.
p273
aVWhat's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this
p274
aVand see, "OK, I understand now."
p275
aVWhen somebody goes and looks at \u2014
p276
aVthey see that someone, an anonymous IP number,
p277
aVmade an edit to my page.
p278
aVThat sounds suspicious. Who is this person?
p279
aVSomebody looks at it \u2014
p280
aVthey can immediately see highlighted in red
p281
aVall of the changes that took place \u2014
p282
aVto see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this.
p283
aVSo that's one tool that we can use
p284
aVto very quickly monitor the history of a page.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnother thing that we do within the community
p287
aVis we leave everything very open-ended.
p288
aVMost of the social rules and the methods of work
p289
aVare left completely open-ended in the software.
p290
aVAll of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.
p291
aVAnd so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules.
p292
aVThe example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page.
p293
aVSo, I mentioned earlier, people type "ASDFASDF" \u2014
p294
aVit needs to be deleted.
p295
aVCases like that, the administrators just delete it.
p296
aVThere's no reason to have a big argument about it.
p297
aVBut you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is,
p298
aVis this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia?
p299
aVIs the information verifiable? Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what?
p300
aVSo we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this.
p301
aVAnd so the method that arose organically within the community
p302
aVis the Votes For Deletion page.
p303
aVAnd in the particular example we have here,
p304
aVit's a film, "Twisted Issues,"
p305
aVand the first person says,
p306
aV"Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably."
p307
aVThe Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there,
p308
aVbecause if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all.
p309
aVIt's not a perfect rule,
p310
aVbut it's a nice starting point for quick research.
p311
aVSo somebody says, "Delete it, please. Delete it \u2014 it's not notable."
p312
aVAnd then somebody says, "Wait, I found it. I found it in a book,
p313
aV'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'"
p314
aVSo the next persons says, "Clean it up."
p315
aVSomebody says, "I've found it on IMDB. Keep, keep, keep."
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd what's interesting about this is that the software is \u2014
p318
aVthese votes are just text typed into a page.
p319
aVThis is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue.
p320
aVNow it is true that at the end of the day,
p321
aVan administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say,
p322
aV"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it."
p323
aVBut in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps,
p324
aVand we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say,
p325
aV"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book,
p326
aVand I found a link to a page that describes it,
p327
aVand I'm going to clean it up tomorrow, so please don't delete it,"
p328
aVthen it would survive.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd it also matters who the people are who are voting.
p331
aVLike I say, it's a tight-knit community.
p332
aVDown here at the bottom, "Keep, real movie," RickK.
p333
aVRickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work
p334
aVwith vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion.
p335
aVHis voice carries a lot of weight within the community
p336
aVbecause he knows what he's doing.
p337
aVSo how is all this governed?
p338
aVPeople really want to know about administrators, things like that.
p339
aVSo the Wikipedia governance model, the governance of the community,
p340
aVis a very confusing, but workable mix of consensus \u2014
p341
aVmeaning we try not to vote on the content of articles,
p342
aVbecause the majority view is not necessarily neutral \u2014
p343
aVsome amount of democracy \u2014
p344
aVall of the administrators \u2014
p345
aVthese are the people who have the ability to delete pages.
p346
aVThat doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages.
p347
aVThey still have to follow all the rules \u2014 but they're elected by the community.
p348
aa(lp349
VSometimes people \u2014 random trolls on the Internet \u2014
p350
aVlike to accuse me of handpicking the administrators
p351
aVto bias the content of the encyclopedia.
p352
aVI always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually.
p353
aVThere's a certain amount of aristocracy.
p354
aVYou got a hint of that when I mentioned, like,
p355
aVRickK's voice would carry a lot more weight
p356
aVthan someone we don't know.
p357
aa(lp358
VI give this talk sometimes with Angela,
p359
aVwho was just re-elected to the board from the community \u2014
p360
aVto the Board of the Foundation,
p361
aVwith more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it.
p362
aVAnd I always embarrass her because I say,
p363
aV"Well, Angela, for example,
p364
aVcould get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia,
p365
aVbecause she's so admired and so powerful."
p366
aVBut the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person
p367
aVwho you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia.
p368
aVAnd I also like to say she's the only person
p369
aVwho actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia, so ...
p370
aVAnd then there's monarchy,
p371
aVand that's my role on the community, so ...
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VI was describing this in Berlin once,
p376
aVand the next day in the newspaper the headline said,
p377
aV"I am the Queen of England."
p378
aa(lp379
V(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd that's not exactly what I said, but \u2014
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
Vthe point is my role in the community \u2014
p386
aVWithin the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition
p387
aVof the "benevolent dictator" model.
p388
aVSo if you look at most of the major free software projects,
p389
aVthey have one single person in charge
p390
aVwho everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator.
p391
aVWell, I don't like the term "benevolent dictator,"
p392
aVand I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas
p393
aVto be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge
p394
aVcompiled by the world.
p395
aVIt just isn't appropriate.
p396
aVBut there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy,
p397
aVa certain amount of \u2014
p398
aVsometimes we have to make a decision
p399
aVand we don't want to get bogged down too heavily
p400
aVin formal decision-making processes.
p401
aa(lp402
VSo as an example of how this can be important:
p403
aVwe recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia,
p404
aVand they said, "Oh, well, this is horrible,
p405
aVthis Jewish conspiracy of a website,
p406
aVand we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like.
p407
aVAnd we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send \u2014
p408
aVwe have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over
p409
aVand they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted."
p410
aVWell, they managed to get 18 people to show up.
p411
aVThat's neo-Nazi math for you.
p412
aVThey always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18.
p413
aVBut they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way
p414
aVto delete a perfectly valid article.
p415
aVOf course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18,
p416
aVso there was no real danger to our democratic processes.
p417
aVOn the other hand, people said, "But what are we going to do?
p418
aVI mean, this could happen.
p419
aVWhat if some group gets really seriously organized
p420
aVand comes in and wants to vote?"
p421
aVThen I said, "Well, fuck it, we'll just change the rules."
p422
aVThat's my job in the community:
p423
aVto say we won't allow our openness and freedom
p424
aVto undermine the quality of the content.
p425
aVAnd so, as long as people trust me in my role,
p426
aVthen that's a valid place for me.
p427
aVOf course, because of the free licensing,
p428
aVif I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave \u2014
p429
aVI can't tell anyone what to do.
p430
aa(lp431
VSo the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works,
p432
aVit's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work,
p433
aVbut we are not fanatical web anarchists.
p434
aVIn fact, we're very flexible about the social methodology,
p435
aVbecause ultimately, the passion of the community
p436
aVis for the quality of the work,
p437
aVnot necessarily for the process that we use to generate it.
p438
aa(lp439
VThank you.
p440
aa(lp441
V(Applause)
p442
aa(lp443
VBen Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.
p444
aVJimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success.
p445
aVIt strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children
p446
aVare inherently biased.
p447
aVHave you found Wikipedia being used by teachers
p448
aVand how do you see Wikipedia changing education?
p449
aa(lp450
VJimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia.
p451
aVThere's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false.
p452
aVIt builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers.
p453
aVAnd the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia,
p454
aVbut academics hate it and teachers hate it.
p455
aVAnd that turns out to not be true.
p456
aVThe last time I got an email from a journalist saying,
p457
aV"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?"
p458
aVI sent it from my Harvard email address
p459
aVbecause I was recently appointed a fellow there.
p460
aVAnd I said, "Well, they don't all hate it."
p461
aa(lp462
V(Laughter)
p463
aa(lp464
VBut I think there's going to be huge impacts.
p465
aVAnd we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about,
p466
aVwhich is the Wikibooks project,
p467
aVwhich is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages.
p468
aVAnd that's a much bigger project.
p469
aVIt's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition.
p470
aa(lp471
VBut part of that is to fulfill our mission
p472
aVof giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.
p473
aVWe don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs.
p474
aVWe mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use.
p475
aVAnd for a lot of people in the world,
p476
aVif I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level,
p477
aVit doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials
p478
aVto build you up to the point where you can actually use it.
p479
aVThe Wikibooks project is an effort to do that.
p480
aVAnd I think that we're going to see \u2014 it may not even come from us;
p481
aVthere's all kinds of innovation going on.
p482
aVBut freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education.

VOne year ago, I rented a car in Jerusalem
p5
aVto go find a man I'd never met
p6
aVbut who had changed my life.
p7
aVI didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming.
p8
aVI didn't have an exact address,
p9
aVbut I knew his name, Abed,
p10
aVI knew that he lived in a town of 15,000, Kfar Kara,
p11
aVand I knew that, 21 years before, just outside this holy city,
p12
aVhe broke my neck.
p13
aVAnd so, on an overcast morning in January, I headed north
p14
aVoff in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe road dropped and I exited Jerusalem.
p17
aVI then rounded the very bend where his blue truck,
p18
aVheavy with four tons of floor tiles,
p19
aVhad borne down with great speed onto the back left corner
p20
aVof the minibus where I sat.
p21
aVI was then 19 years old.
p22
aVI'd grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups
p23
aVin eight months, and the night before the crash,
p24
aVI delighted in my new body,
p25
aVplaying basketball with friends
p26
aVinto the wee hours of a May morning.
p27
aVI palmed the ball in my large right hand,
p28
aVand when that hand reached the rim, I felt invincible.
p29
aVI was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court.
p30
aa(lp31
VI didn't see Abed coming.
p32
aVFrom my seat, I was looking up at a stone town
p33
aVon a hilltop, bright in the noontime sun,
p34
aVwhen from behind there was a great bang,
p35
aVas loud and violent as a bomb.
p36
aVMy head snapped back over my red seat.
p37
aVMy eardrum blew. My shoes flew off.
p38
aVI flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones,
p39
aVand when I landed, I was a quadriplegic.
p40
aVOver the coming months, I learned to breathe on my own,
p41
aVthen to sit and to stand and to walk,
p42
aVbut my body was now divided vertically.
p43
aVI was a hemiplegic, and back home in New York,
p44
aVI used a wheelchair for four years, all through college.
p45
aa(lp46
VCollege ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year.
p47
aVThere I rose from my chair for good,
p48
aVI leaned on my cane, and I looked back,
p49
aVfinding all from my fellow passengers in the bus
p50
aVto photographs of the crash,
p51
aVand when I saw this photograph,
p52
aVI didn't see a bloody and unmoving body.
p53
aVI saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid,
p54
aVand I mourned that it was lost,
p55
aVmourned all I had not yet done,
p56
aVbut was now impossible.
p57
aa(lp58
VIt was then I read the testimony that Abed gave
p59
aVthe morning after the crash,
p60
aVof driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem.
p61
aVReading his words, I welled with anger.
p62
aVIt was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man,
p63
aVand it came from magical thinking.
p64
aVOn this xeroxed piece of paper,
p65
aVthe crash had not yet happened.
p66
aVAbed could still turn his wheel left
p67
aVso that I would see him whoosh by out my window
p68
aVand I would remain whole.
p69
aV"Be careful, Abed, look out. Slow down."
p70
aVBut Abed did not slow,
p71
aVand on that xeroxed piece of paper, my neck again broke,
p72
aVand again, I was left without anger.
p73
aa(lp74
VI decided to find Abed,
p75
aVand when I finally did,
p76
aVhe responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance,
p77
aVit seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call.
p78
aVAnd maybe he had.
p79
aVI didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record \u2014
p80
aV27 violations by the age of 25,
p81
aVthe last, his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day \u2014
p82
aVand I didn't mention my prior record \u2014
p83
aVthe quadriplegia and the catheters,
p84
aVthe insecurity and the loss \u2014
p85
aVand when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash,
p86
aVI didn't say that I knew from the police report
p87
aVthat he'd escaped serious injury.
p88
aVI said I wanted to meet.
p89
aVAbed said that I should call back in a few weeks,
p90
aVand when I did, and a recording told me
p91
aVthat his number was disconnected,
p92
aVI let Abed and the crash go.
p93
aa(lp94
VMany years passed.
p95
aVI walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack
p96
aVon trips in six continents.
p97
aVI pitched overhand in a weekly softball game
p98
aVthat I started in Central Park,
p99
aVand home in New York, I became a journalist and an author,
p100
aVtyping hundreds of thousands of words with one finger.
p101
aVA friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories
p102
aVmirrored my own, each centering on a life
p103
aVthat had changed in an instant,
p104
aVowing, if not to a crash, then to an inheritance,
p105
aVa swing of the bat, a click of the shutter, an arrest.
p106
aVEach of us had a before and an after.
p107
aVI'd been working through my lot after all.
p108
aa(lp109
VStill, Abed was far from my mind, when last year,
p110
aVI returned to Israel to write of the crash,
p111
aVand the book I then wrote, "Half-Life,"
p112
aVwas nearly complete when I recognized
p113
aVthat I still wanted to meet Abed,
p114
aVand finally I understood why:
p115
aVto hear this man say two words: "I'm sorry."
p116
aVPeople apologize for less.
p117
aVAnd so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived
p118
aVsomewhere in his same town,
p119
aVand I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat,
p120
aVwhen suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering.
p121
aVBut what to get the man who broke your fucking neck?
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVI pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh,
p124
aVand bought a brick of Turkish delight:
p125
aVpistachios glued in rosewater. Better.
p126
aa(lp127
VBack on Highway 1, I envisioned what awaited.
p128
aVAbed would hug me. Abed would spit at me.
p129
aVAbed would say, "I'm sorry."
p130
aVI then began to wonder, as I had many times before,
p131
aVhow my life would have been different
p132
aVhad this man not injured me,
p133
aVhad my genes been fed a different helping of experience.
p134
aVWho was I?
p135
aVWas I who I had been before the crash,
p136
aVbefore this road divided my life like the spine of an open book?
p137
aVWas I what had been done to me?
p138
aVWere all of us the results of things done to us, done for us,
p139
aVthe infidelity of a parent or spouse,
p140
aVmoney inherited?
p141
aVWere we instead our bodies, their inborn endowments and deficits?
p142
aVIt seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience,
p143
aVbut how to tease out the one from the other?
p144
aVAs Yeats put that same universal question,
p145
aV"O body swayed to music, o brightening glance,
p146
aVhow can we know the dancer from the dance?"
p147
aVI'd been driving for an hour
p148
aVwhen I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance.
p149
aVThe light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue.
p150
aVThe predispositions and impulses that had propelled me
p151
aVas a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake,
p152
aVthat had propelled me as a teen
p153
aVto jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane.
p154
aVBut I also saw in my reflection
p155
aVthat, had Abed not injured me,
p156
aVI would now, in all likelihood, be a doctor
p157
aVand a husband and a father.
p158
aVI would be less mindful of time and of death,
p159
aVand, oh, I would not be disabled,
p160
aVwould not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune.
p161
aVThe frequent furl of five fingers, the chips in my teeth
p162
aVcome from biting at all the many things
p163
aVa solitary hand cannot open.
p164
aVThe dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined.
p165
aa(lp166
VIt was approaching 11 when I exited right
p167
aVtoward Afula, and passed a large quarry
p168
aVand was soon in Kfar Kara.
p169
aVI felt a pang of nerves.
p170
aVBut Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas,
p171
aVand I pulled into a lot by a gas station
p172
aVto listen and to calm.
p173
aa(lp174
VI'd been told that in an Arab town,
p175
aVone need only mention the name of a local
p176
aVand it will be recognized.
p177
aVAnd I was mentioning Abed and myself,
p178
aVnoting deliberately that I was here in peace,
p179
aVto the people in this town,
p180
aVwhen I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon.
p181
aVHe listened to me.
p182
aa(lp183
VYou know, it was most often when speaking to people
p184
aVthat I wondered where I ended and my disability began,
p185
aVfor many people told me what they told no one else.
p186
aVMany cried.
p187
aVAnd one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same
p188
aVand I later asked her why,
p189
aVshe told me that, best she could tell, her tears
p190
aVhad had something to do with my being happy and strong,
p191
aVbut vulnerable too.
p192
aVI listened to her words. I suppose they were true.
p193
aVI was me,
p194
aVbut I was now me despite a limp,
p195
aVand that, I suppose, was what now made me, me.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnyway, Mohamed told me
p198
aVwhat perhaps he would not have told another stranger.
p199
aVHe led me to a house of cream stucco, then drove off.
p200
aVAnd as I sat contemplating what to say,
p201
aVa woman approached in a black shawl and black robe.
p202
aVI stepped from my car and said "Shalom,"
p203
aVand identified myself,
p204
aVand she told me that her husband Abed
p205
aVwould be home from work in four hours.
p206
aVHer Hebrew was not good, and she later confessed
p207
aVthat she thought that I had come to install the Internet.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VI drove off and returned at 4:30,
p211
aVthankful to the minaret up the road
p212
aVthat helped me find my way back.
p213
aVAnd as I approached the front door,
p214
aVAbed saw me, my jeans and flannel and cane,
p215
aVand I saw Abed, an average-looking man of average size.
p216
aVHe wore black and white: slippers over socks,
p217
aVpilling sweatpants, a piebald sweater,
p218
aVa striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead.
p219
aVHe'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned.
p220
aVAnd so at once, we shook hands, and smiled,
p221
aVand I gave him my gift,
p222
aVand he told me I was a guest in his home,
p223
aVand we sat beside one another on a fabric couch.
p224
aa(lp225
VIt was then that Abed resumed at once
p226
aVthe tale of woe he had begun over the phone
p227
aV16 years before.
p228
aVHe'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said.
p229
aVHe had problems with his side and his legs too,
p230
aVand, oh, he'd lost his teeth in the crash.
p231
aVDid I wish to see him remove them?
p232
aVAbed then rose and turned on the TV
p233
aVso that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room,
p234
aVand returned with polaroids of the crash
p235
aVand his old driver's license.
p236
aa(lp237
V"I was handsome," he said.
p238
aa(lp239
VWe looked down at his laminated mug.
p240
aVAbed had been less handsome than substantial,
p241
aVwith thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck.
p242
aVIt was this youth who on May 16, 1990,
p243
aVhad broken two necks including mine,
p244
aVand bruised one brain and taken one life.
p245
aVTwenty-one years later, he was now thinner than his wife,
p246
aVhis skin slack on his face,
p247
aVand looking at Abed looking at his young self,
p248
aVI remembered looking at that photograph of my young self
p249
aVafter the crash, and recognized his longing.
p250
aa(lp251
V"The crash changed both of our lives," I said.
p252
aa(lp253
VAbed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck,
p254
aVand said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver
p255
aVin the left lane who did not let him pass.
p256
aVI did not want to recap the crash with Abed.
p257
aVI'd hoped for something simpler:
p258
aVto exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way.
p259
aVAnd so I didn't point out that in his own testimony
p260
aVthe morning after the crash,
p261
aVAbed did not even mention the bus driver.
p262
aVNo, I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth.
p263
aVI had come for remorse.
p264
aVAnd so I now went looking for remorse
p265
aVand threw truth under the bus.
p266
aa(lp267
V"I understand," I said, "that the crash was not your fault,
p268
aVbut does it make you sad that others suffered?"
p269
aa(lp270
VAbed spoke three quick words.
p271
aV"Yes, I suffered."
p272
aa(lp273
VAbed then told me why he'd suffered.
p274
aVHe'd lived an unholy life before the crash,
p275
aVand so God had ordained the crash,
p276
aVbut now, he said, he was religious, and God was pleased.
p277
aa(lp278
VIt was then that God intervened:
p279
aVnews on the TV of a car wreck that hours before
p280
aVhad killed three people up north.
p281
aVWe looked up at the wreckage.
p282
aa(lp283
V"Strange," I said.
p284
aa(lp285
V"Strange," he agreed.
p286
aa(lp287
VI had the thought that there, on Route 804,
p288
aVthere were perpetrators and victims,
p289
aVdyads bound by a crash.
p290
aVSome, as had Abed, would forget the date.
p291
aVSome, as had I, would remember.
p292
aVThe report finished and Abed spoke.
p293
aa(lp294
V"It is a pity," he said, "that the police
p295
aVin this country are not tough enough on bad drivers."
p296
aa(lp297
VI was baffled.
p298
aVAbed had said something remarkable.
p299
aVDid it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash?
p300
aVWas it evidence of guilt, an assertion
p301
aVthat he should have been put away longer?
p302
aVHe'd served six months in prison, lost his truck license for a decade.
p303
aVI forgot my discretion.
p304
aa(lp305
V"Um, Abed," I said,
p306
aV"I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash."
p307
aa(lp308
V"Well," he said, "I once went 60 in a 40."
p309
aVAnd so 27 violations \u2014
p310
aVdriving through a red light, driving at excessive speed,
p311
aVdriving on the wrong side of a barrier,
p312
aVand finally, riding his brakes down that hill \u2014
p313
aVreduced to one.
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality,
p316
aVthe human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable.
p317
aVThe goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim.
p318
aVIt was then I understood that Abed would never apologize.
p319
aa(lp320
VAbed and I sat with our coffee.
p321
aVWe'd spent 90 minutes together,
p322
aVand he was now known to me.
p323
aVHe was not a particularly bad man
p324
aVor a particularly good man.
p325
aVHe was a limited man
p326
aVwho'd found it within himself to be kind to me.
p327
aVWith a nod to Jewish custom,
p328
aVhe told me that I should live to be 120 years old.
p329
aVBut it was hard for me to relate to one who had
p330
aVso completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing,
p331
aVto one whose life was so unexamined that he said
p332
aVhe thought two people had died in the crash.
p333
aa(lp334
VThere was much I wished to say to Abed.
p335
aVI wished to tell him that, were he to acknowledge my disability,
p336
aVit would be okay,
p337
aVfor people are wrong to marvel
p338
aVat those like me who smile as we limp.
p339
aVPeople don't know that they have lived through worse,
p340
aVthat problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck,
p341
aVthat problems of the mind are greater still,
p342
aVmore injurious, than a hundred broken necks.
p343
aVI wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are
p344
aVmost of all
p345
aVis not our minds and not our bodies
p346
aVand not what happens to us,
p347
aVbut how we respond to what happens to us.
p348
aV"This," wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl,
p349
aV"is the last of the human freedoms:
p350
aVto choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."
p351
aVI wished to tell him that not only paralyzers
p352
aVand paralyzees must evolve, reconcile to reality,
p353
aVbut we all must \u2014
p354
aVthe aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding
p355
aVand the bankrupt and everyone.
p356
aVI wished to tell him that one does not have to say
p357
aVthat a bad thing is good,
p358
aVthat a crash is from God and so a crash is good,
p359
aVa broken neck is good.
p360
aVOne can say that a bad thing sucks,
p361
aVbut that this natural world still has many glories.
p362
aVI wished to tell him that, in the end, our mandate is clear:
p363
aVWe have to rise above bad fortune.
p364
aVWe have to be in the good and enjoy the good,
p365
aVstudy and work and adventure and friendship \u2014 oh, friendship \u2014
p366
aVand community and love.
p367
aa(lp368
VBut most of all, I wished to tell him
p369
aVwhat Herman Melville wrote,
p370
aVthat "truly to enjoy bodily warmth,
p371
aVsome small part of you must be cold,
p372
aVfor there is no quality in this world
p373
aVthat is not what it is merely by contrast."
p374
aVYes, contrast.
p375
aVIf you are mindful of what you do not have,
p376
aVyou may be truly mindful of what you do have,
p377
aVand if the gods are kind, you may truly enjoy what you have.
p378
aVThat is the one singular gift you may receive
p379
aVif you suffer in any existential way.
p380
aVYou know death, and so may wake each morning
p381
aVpulsing with ready life.
p382
aVSome part of you is cold,
p383
aVand so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm,
p384
aVor even to be cold.
p385
aVWhen one morning, years after the crash,
p386
aVI stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot
p387
aVfelt the flash of cold, nerves at last awake,
p388
aVit was exhilarating, a gust of snow.
p389
aa(lp390
VBut I didn't say these things to Abed.
p391
aVI told him only that he had killed one man, not two.
p392
aVI told him the name of that man.
p393
aVAnd then I said, "Goodbye."
p394
aa(lp395
VThank you.
p396
aa(lp397
V(Applause)
p398
aVThanks a lot.
p399
aV(Applause)

VTrees are wonderful arenas for discovery
p5
aVbecause of their tall stature, their complex structure,
p6
aVthe biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.
p7
aVI used to climb trees for fun all the time
p8
aVand now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees
p9
aVand forests, through the medium of science.
p10
aa(lp11
VThe most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.
p12
aVAnd Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983,
p13
aVcalled the canopy, "the last biotic frontier."
p14
aVI'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy,
p15
aVand share with you what canopy researchers are asking
p16
aVand also how they're communicating with other people outside of science.
p17
aa(lp18
VLet's start our journey on the forest floor
p19
aVof one of my study sites in Costa Rica.
p20
aVBecause of the overhanging leaves and branches,
p21
aVyou'll notice that the understory is very dark,
p22
aVit's very still.
p23
aVAnd what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy,
p24
aVnot by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses,
p25
aVbut rather showing you a very short clip
p26
aVfrom a National Geographic film called "Heroes of the High Frontier."
p27
aVThis was filmed in Monteverde, Costa Rica
p28
aVand I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like
p29
aVto climb a giant strangler fig.
p30
aV(Music)
p31
aV(Growling)
p32
aV(Rustling)
p33
aa(lp34
VSo what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field,
p35
aVand there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted
p36
aVto make their way and their life in the canopy.
p37
aVCommon groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptations
p38
aVfor forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws.
p39
aVBut I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity
p40
aVand tell you about the ants.
p41
aVThere are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists \u2014
p42
aVpeople who describe and name animals \u2014 have named.
p43
aV4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy.
p44
aa(lp45
VOne of the reasons I tell you about ants
p46
aVis because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomist
p47
aVand when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did \u2014
p48
aVProcryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.
p49
aVWe've had two children, August Andrew and Erika
p50
aVand actually, he named ants after them.
p51
aVSo we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us.
p52
aa(lp53
VBut my passion \u2014 in addition to Jack and my children \u2014
p54
aVare the plants, the so-called epiphytes,
p55
aVthose plants that grow up on trees.
p56
aVThey don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor.
p57
aVBut rather, it is their leaves that are adapted
p58
aVto intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog.
p59
aVThese plants occur in great diversity,
p60
aVover 28,000 species around the world.
p61
aVThey grow in tropical forests like this one
p62
aVand they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state.
p63
aa(lp64
VThese epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses.
p65
aVOne thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes,
p66
aVas they die and decompose, they actually construct an arboreal soil,
p67
aVboth in the temperate zone and in the tropics.
p68
aVAnd these mosses, generated by decomposing,
p69
aVare like peat moss in your garden.
p70
aVThey have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water.
p71
aa(lp72
VOne of the surprising things I discovered
p73
aVis that, if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes,
p74
aVwhat you'll find underneath them are connections, networks
p75
aVof what we call canopy roots.
p76
aVThese are not epiphyte roots:
p77
aVthese are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves.
p78
aVAnd so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent
p79
aVin exchange for being supported high above the forest floor.
p80
aa(lp81
VI was interested, and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested
p82
aVin the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest.
p83
aVWe've done stripping experiments
p84
aVwhere we've removed mats of epiphytes
p85
aVand looked at the rates of recolonization.
p86
aVWe had predicted that they would grow back very quickly
p87
aVand that they would come in encroaching from the side.
p88
aVWhat we found, however, was that they took an extremely long time \u2014
p89
aVover 20 years \u2014 to regenerate,
p90
aVstarting from the bottom and growing up.
p91
aVAnd even now, after 25 years,
p92
aVthey're not up there, they have not recolonized completely.
p93
aVAnd I use this little image to say
p94
aVthis is what happens to mosses.
p95
aVIf it's gone, it's gone,
p96
aVand if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VSo, recolonization is really very slow.
p101
aVThese canopy communities are fragile.
p102
aVWell, when we look out, you and I, over that canopy
p103
aVof the intact primary forest,
p104
aVwhat we see is this enormous carpet of carbon.
p105
aVOne of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today
p106
aVis trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.
p107
aVWe know it's a lot,
p108
aVbut we do not yet know the answers to how much,
p109
aVand by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere,
p110
aVheld in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo I hope I've showed you that canopy-dwellers
p113
aVare not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy
p114
aVthat Tarzan and Jane were interested in,
p115
aVbut rather that they foster biodiversity
p116
aVcontribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles,
p117
aVand they also help to keep our global climate stable.
p118
aa(lp119
VUp in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me
p120
aVand you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems,
p121
aVyou would also see scenes like this.
p122
aVScenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting
p123
aVand forest fragmentation,
p124
aVthereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy
p125
aVunable to function in the marvelous ways that it has
p126
aVwhen it is not disturbed by humans.
p127
aa(lp128
VI've also looked out on urban places like this
p129
aVand thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.
p130
aVPeople who grew up in a place like this
p131
aVdid not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees
p132
aVand forests, as I did when I was a young girl.
p133
aVThis troubles me.
p134
aa(lp135
VHere in 2009, you know, it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist,
p136
aVgripping ourselves with these kinds of questions
p137
aVand trying to figure out how we can answer them.
p138
aVAnd especially, you know, as a small brown woman
p139
aVin a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country,
p140
aVfar away from the areas of power and money,
p141
aVI really have to ask myself, "What can I do about this?
p142
aVHow can I reconnect people with trees?"
p143
aa(lp144
VWell, I think that I can do something.
p145
aVI know that as a scientist, I have information
p146
aVand as a human being, I can communicate with anybody,
p147
aVinside or outside of academia.
p148
aVAnd so, that's what I've begin doing,
p149
aVand so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.
p150
aVWe consult to the media about canopy questions;
p151
aVwe have a canopy newsletter;
p152
aVwe have an email LISTSERV.
p153
aVAnd so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy,
p154
aVthe beauty of the canopy,
p155
aVthe necessity of intact canopies,
p156
aVto people outside of academia.
p157
aVWe also recognize that a lot of the products that we make \u2014
p158
aVthose videos and so forth \u2014
p159
aVyou know, they don't reach everybody,
p160
aVand so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia,
p161
aVand outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to.
p162
aa(lp163
VTreetop Barbie is a great example of that.
p164
aVWhat we do, my students in my lab and I,
p165
aVis we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village,
p166
aVwe dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses
p167
aVand we send her out with a canopy handbook.
p168
aVAnd my feeling is \u2014
p169
aa(lp170
V(Applause)
p171
aa(lp172
VThank you.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
V\u2014 that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit
p177
aVto become an ambassador who can carry the message
p178
aVthat being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing.
p179
aa(lp180
VWe've also made partnerships with artists,
p181
aVwith people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty
p182
aVof trees and forest canopies.
p183
aVAnd I'd like to just tell you one of our projects,
p184
aVwhich is the generation of Canopy Confluences.
p185
aVWhat I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds,
p186
aVand we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms;
p187
aVand we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy,
p188
aVand we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together.
p189
aVThe results have been fantastic.
p190
aa(lp191
VI'll just give you a few examples.
p192
aVThis is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao
p193
aVwho is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department
p194
aVat Rhode Island School of Design.
p195
aVHe saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences
p196
aVin the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.
p197
aVWe've had dance people up in the canopy.
p198
aVJodi Lomask, and her wonderful troupe Capacitor,
p199
aVjoined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.
p200
aVThey made a fabulous dance called "Biome."
p201
aa(lp202
VThey danced in the forest,
p203
aVand we are taking this dance, my scientific outreach communications,
p204
aVand also linking up with environmental groups,
p205
aVto go to different cities and to perform
p206
aVthe science, the dance and the environmental outreach
p207
aVthat we hope will make a difference.
p208
aVWe brought musicians to the canopy,
p209
aVand they made their music \u2014 and it's fantastic music.
p210
aVWe had wooden flutists, we had oboists,
p211
aVwe had opera singers, we had guitar players,
p212
aVand we had rap singers.
p213
aVAnd I brought a little segment to give you
p214
aVof Duke Brady's "Canopy Rap."
p215
aV(Music) That's Duke!
p216
aa(lp217
V(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VThis experience of working with Duke
p220
aValso led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.
p221
aVI saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth \u2014
p222
aVan audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor,
p223
aVI don't have a hope of getting to \u2014
p224
aVin terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.
p225
aVSo I engaged Caution, this rap singer,
p226
aVwith a group of young people from inner-city Tacoma.
p227
aVWe went out to the forest, I would pick up a branch,
p228
aVCaution would rap on it,
p229
aVand suddenly that branch was really cool.
p230
aVAnd then the students would come into our sound studios,
p231
aVthey would make their own rap songs with their own beats.
p232
aVThey ended up making a CD
p233
aVwhich they took home to their family and friends,
p234
aVthereby expressing their own experiences with nature
p235
aVin their own medium.
p236
aa(lp237
VThe final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart,
p238
aVand it involves an economic and social value
p239
aVthat is associated with epiphytic plants.
p240
aVIn the Pacific Northwest,
p241
aVthere's a whole industry of moss-harvesting
p242
aVfrom old-growth forests.
p243
aVThese mosses are taken from the forest;
p244
aVthey're used by the floriculture industry, by florists,
p245
aVto make arrangements and make hanging baskets.
p246
aVIt's a 265 million dollar industry
p247
aVand it's increasing rapidly.
p248
aVIf you remember that bald guy,
p249
aVyou'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks
p250
aVin the Pacific Northwest old-growth forest
p251
aVis going to take decades and decades to come back.
p252
aVSo this whole industry is unsustainable.
p253
aVWhat can I, as an ecologist, do about that?
p254
aa(lp255
VWell, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses,
p256
aVand that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild.
p257
aVAnd I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this,
p258
aVthat would be great.
p259
aVAnd so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women \u2014
p260
aVwho don't have access to nature,
p261
aVwho often have a lot of time, they often have space,
p262
aVand you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses \u2014
p263
aVwould be great partners.
p264
aVAnd they have become excellent partners.
p265
aVThe best I can imagine.
p266
aVThey were very enthusiastic.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
VThey were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.
p271
aVThey learned how to distinguish different species of mosses,
p272
aVwhich, to tell you the truth,
p273
aVis a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do.
p274
aVAnd they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design
p275
aVin order to grow these mosses.
p276
aVWe've been successful as partners
p277
aVin figuring out which species grow the fastest,
p278
aVand I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been.
p279
aVBecause the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well,
p280
aVI started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons.
p281
aVI brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison.
p282
aVWe gave talks once a month,
p283
aVand that actually ended up implementing
p284
aVsome amazing sustainability projects at the prisons \u2014
p285
aVorganic gardens, worm culture, recycling,
p286
aVwater catchment and beekeeping. (Applause)
p287
aa(lp288
VOur latest endeavor,
p289
aa(lp290
Vwith a grant
p291
aa(lp292
Vfrom the Department of Corrections at Washington state,
p293
aVthey've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons.
p294
aVAnd our new project is having the inmates and ourselves
p295
aVlearn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog
p296
aVwhich is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.
p297
aVSo they will raise them \u2014 in captivity, of course \u2014
p298
aVfrom eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs.
p299
aVAnd they will have the pleasure, many of them,
p300
aVof seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop,
p301
aVhelped nurture, move out into protected wildlands
p302
aVto augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild.
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd so, I think for many reasons \u2014
p305
aVecological, social, economic and perhaps even spiritual \u2014
p306
aVthis has been a tremendous project
p307
aVand I'm really looking forward to
p308
aVnot only myself and my students doing it,
p309
aVbut also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this.
p310
aVAs many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one.
p311
aVI'm trying to help researchers move more outward
p312
aVto have their own partnerships
p313
aVwith people outside of the academic community.
p314
aVAnd so I'm hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist,
p315
aVcan perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.
p316
aVPerhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together
p317
aVand make an opera about AIDS.
p318
aVOr perhaps Al Gore and Naturally 7 could make a song about climate change
p319
aVthat would really make you clap your hands.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo, although it's a little bit of a fantasy, I think it's also a reality.
p322
aVGiven the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times,
p323
aVit is time for scientists to reach outward,
p324
aVand time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.
p325
aVI started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests
p326
aVwith the tools of science.
p327
aVBy making these partnerships that I described to you,
p328
aVI have really opened my mind and, I have to say, my heart
p329
aVto have a greater understanding,
p330
aVto make other discoveries about nature and myself.
p331
aa(lp332
VWhen I look into my heart, I see trees \u2014
p333
aVthis is actually an image of a real heart \u2014
p334
aVthere are trees in our hearts,
p335
aVthere are trees in your hearts.
p336
aVWhen we come to understand nature,
p337
aVwe are touching the most deep, the most important parts of our self.
p338
aVIn these partnerships, I have also learned
p339
aVthat people tend to compartmentalize themselves
p340
aVinto IT people, and movie star people, and scientists,
p341
aVbut when we share nature,
p342
aVwhen we share our perspectives about nature,
p343
aVwe find a common denominator.
p344
aa(lp345
VFinally, as a scientist and as a person
p346
aVand now, as part of the TED community,
p347
aVI feel that I have better tools
p348
aVto go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature,
p349
aVto make new discoveries about nature \u2014
p350
aVand about humans' place in nature
p351
aVwherever we are and whomever you are.
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you very much.

VThere's currently over a thousand TED Talks on the TED website.
p5
aVAnd I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic,
p6
aVexcept for me, I don't agree with this.
p7
aVI think we have a situation here.
p8
aVBecause if you think about it, 1,000 TED Talks,
p9
aVthat's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.
p10
aVHow on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas?
p11
aVEven if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head
p12
aVby watching all those thousand TED videos,
p13
aVit would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so.
p14
aVAnd I did a little calculation of this.
p15
aVThe damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000.
p16
aVSo having seen this danger to the economy,
p17
aVI thought, we need to find a solution to this problem.
p18
aa(lp19
VHere's my approach to it all.
p20
aVIf you look at the current situation, you have a thousand TED Talks.
p21
aVEach of those TED Talks has an average length of about 2,300 words.
p22
aVNow take this together, and you end up with 2.3 million words of TED Talks,
p23
aVwhich is about three Bibles-worth of content.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VThe obvious question here is, does a TED Talk really need 2,300 words?
p28
aVIsn't there something shorter?
p29
aVI mean, if you have an idea worth spreading,
p30
aVsurely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words.
p31
aVThe only question is, how short can you get?
p32
aVWhat's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TED Talk?
p33
aa(lp34
VWhile I was pondering this question,
p35
aVI came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway,
p36
aVwho allegedly said that these six words here:
p37
aV"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"
p38
aVwere the best novel he had ever written.
p39
aVAnd I also encountered a project called Six-Word Memoirs
p40
aVwhere people were asked, take your whole life
p41
aVand please sum this up into six words, such as these here:
p42
aV"Found true love, married someone else."
p43
aVOr "Living in existential vacuum; it sucks."
p44
aVI actually like that one.
p45
aVSo if a novel can be put into six words
p46
aVand a whole memoir can be put into six words,
p47
aVyou don't need more than six words for a TED Talk.
p48
aVWe could have been done by lunch here.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd if you did this for all thousand TED Talks,
p53
aVyou would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000.
p54
aVSo I thought this was quite worthwhile.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo I started asking all my friends,
p57
aVplease take your favorite TED Talk and put that into six words.
p58
aVSo here are some of the results that I received.
p59
aVI think they're quite nice.
p60
aVFor example, Dan Pink's talk on motivation, which was pretty good,
p61
aVif you haven't seen it: "Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."
p62
aVIt's what he's basically talking about in those 18,5 minutes.
p63
aVOr some even included references to the speakers,
p64
aVsuch as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style, or the one of Tim Ferriss,
p65
aVwhich might be considered a bit strenuous at times.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this,
p68
aVI would probably end up with a lot of summaries,
p69
aVbut not with many friends in the end.
p70
aVSo I had to find a different method, preferably involving total strangers.
p71
aVAnd luckily, there's a website for that, called Mechanical Turk,
p72
aVwhich is a website where you can post tasks
p73
aVthat you don't want to do yourself,
p74
aVsuch as "Please summarize this text for me in six words."
p75
aVAnd I didn't allow any low-cost countries to work on this,
p76
aVbut I found out I could get a six-word summary for just 10 cents,
p77
aVwhich I think is a pretty good price.
p78
aa(lp79
VEven then, unfortunately,
p80
aVit's not possible to summarize each TED Talk individually.
p81
aVBecause if you do the math, you have a thousand TED Talks,
p82
aVyou pay 10 cents each;
p83
aVyou have to do more than one summary for each of those talks,
p84
aVbecause some of them will probably be, or are, really bad.
p85
aVSo I would end up paying hundreds of dollars.
p86
aVSo I thought of a different way,
p87
aVby thinking, well, the talks revolve around certain themes.
p88
aVSo what if I don't let people summarize individual TED Talks to six words,
p89
aVbut give them 10 TED Talks at the same time
p90
aVand say, "Please do a six-word summary for that one."
p91
aVI would cut my costs by 90 percent.
p92
aVSo for $60,
p93
aVI could summarize a thousand TED Talks into just 600 summaries,
p94
aVwhich would actually be quite nice.
p95
aa(lp96
VSome of you might actually right now be thinking,
p97
aVit's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks summarized into just six words.
p98
aVBut it's actually not,
p99
aVbecause there's an example by statistics professor Hans Rosling.
p100
aVI guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks.
p101
aVHe's got eight talks online,
p102
aVand those can basically be summed up into just four words,
p103
aVbecause that's all he's basically showing us, our intuition is really bad.
p104
aVHe always proves us wrong.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo people on the Internet, some didn't do so well.
p107
aVAnd when I asked them to summarize the 10 TED Talks at the same time,
p108
aVsome took the easy route out.
p109
aVThey just had some general comment.
p110
aVThere were others \u2014 and I found this quite cheeky \u2014
p111
aVThey used their six words to talk back to me
p112
aVand ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd finally also, I never understood this,
p117
aVsome people really came up with their own version of the truth.
p118
aVI don't know any TED Talk that contains this.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut, oh well.
p121
aVIn the end, however, and this is really amazing,
p122
aVfor each of those 10 TED Talk clusters that I submitted,
p123
aVI actually received meaningful summaries.
p124
aVHere are some of my favorites.
p125
aVFor example, for the TED Talks about food,
p126
aVsomeone summed this up into: "Food shaping body, brains and environment,"
p127
aVwhich I think is pretty good.
p128
aVOr happiness: "Striving toward happiness = moving toward unhappiness."
p129
aa(lp130
VSo here I was.
p131
aVI had started out with a thousand TED Talks
p132
aVand I had 600 six-word summaries for those.
p133
aVActually, it sounded nice in the beginning,
p134
aVbut when you look at 600 summaries, it's quite a lot, it's a huge list.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VSo I thought, I probably have to take this one step further here
p139
aVand create summaries of the summaries, and this is exactly what I did.
p140
aVSo I took the 600 summaries that I had, put them into nine groups
p141
aVaccording to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com
p142
aVand asked people to do summaries of those.
p143
aVAgain, there were some misunderstandings.
p144
aVFor example, when I had a cluster of all the "Beautiful" talks,
p145
aVsomeone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick-up line.
p146
aVBut in the end, amazingly,
p147
aVagain, people were able to do it.
p148
aVFor example, all the courageous TED Talks:
p149
aV"People dying" or "People suffering" was also one,
p150
aV"with easy solutions around."
p151
aVOr the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping TED Talk:
p152
aV"Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer."
p153
aVI mean that's the essence of it all.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow I had my nine groups, but, I mean, it's already quite a reduction.
p156
aVBut of course, once you are that far, you're not really satisfied.
p157
aVI wanted to go all the way, all the way down the distillery,
p158
aVstarting out with a thousand TED Talks.
p159
aVI wanted to have a thousand TED Talks summarized into just six words \u2014
p160
aVwhich would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content.
p161
aVAnd I would only pay $99.50 \u2014
p162
aVso stay even below $100 for it.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo I had 50 overall summaries done.
p165
aVThis time I paid 25 cents
p166
aVbecause I thought the task was a bit harder.
p167
aVAnd unfortunately, when I first received the answers \u2014
p168
aVand here, you'll see six of the answers \u2014 I was a bit disappointed.
p169
aVBecause I think you'll agree, they all summarize some aspect of TED,
p170
aVbut to me, they felt a bit bland,
p171
aVor they just had a certain aspect of TED in them.
p172
aVSo I was almost ready to give up
p173
aVwhen one night, I played around with these sentences
p174
aVand found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here.
p175
aVSo here it is,
p176
aVa crowd-sourced, six-word summary of a thousand TED Talks
p177
aVat the value of $99.50:
p178
aV"Why the worry? I'd rather wonder."
p179
aa(lp180
VThank you very much.

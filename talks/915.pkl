VWhen I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,
p5
aVthe future of the world was bleak.
p6
aVThe population explosion was unstoppable.
p7
aVGlobal famine was inevitable.
p8
aVA cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment
p9
aVwas going to shorten our lives.
p10
aVThe acid rain was falling on the forests.
p11
aVThe desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.
p12
aVThe oil was running out,
p13
aVand a nuclear winter would finish us off.
p14
aVNone of those things happened,
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVand astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime,
p17
aVthe average per-capita income
p18
aVof the average person on the planet,
p19
aVin real terms, adjusted for inflation,
p20
aVhas tripled.
p21
aVLifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.
p22
aVChild mortality is down by two-thirds.
p23
aVPer-capita food production
p24
aVis up by a third.
p25
aVAnd all this at a time when the population has doubled.
p26
aa(lp27
VHow did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?
p28
aVHow did we achieve that?
p29
aVHow did we become
p30
aVthe only species
p31
aVthat becomes more prosperous
p32
aVas it becomes more populous?
p33
aVThe size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,
p34
aVand the level of the graph
p35
aVrepresents GDP per capita.
p36
aVI think to answer that question
p37
aVyou need to understand
p38
aVhow human beings bring together their brains
p39
aVand enable their ideas to combine and recombine,
p40
aVto meet and, indeed, to mate.
p41
aVIn other words, you need to understand
p42
aVhow ideas have sex.
p43
aa(lp44
VI want you to imagine
p45
aVhow we got from making objects like this
p46
aVto making objects like this.
p47
aVThese are both real objects.
p48
aVOne is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago
p49
aVof the kind made by Homo erectus.
p50
aVThe other is obviously a computer mouse.
p51
aVThey're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.
p52
aVI've tried to work out which is bigger,
p53
aVand it's almost impossible.
p54
aVAnd that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.
p55
aVThey're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.
p56
aVIt just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.
p57
aVThe differences are what interest me,
p58
aVbecause the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design
p59
aVfor about a million years \u2014
p60
aVfrom one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.
p61
aVHomo erectus made the same tool
p62
aVfor 30,000 generations.
p63
aVOf course there were a few changes,
p64
aVbut tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.
p65
aVThere was no progress, no innovation.
p66
aVIt's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.
p67
aVWhereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.
p68
aVAnd there's another difference too,
p69
aVwhich is the object on the left is made from one substance.
p70
aVThe object on the right is made from
p71
aVa confection of different substances,
p72
aVfrom silicon and metal and plastic and so on.
p73
aVAnd more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,
p74
aVthe idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,
p75
aVthe idea of transistors.
p76
aVThey've all been combined together in this technology.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd it's this combination,
p79
aVthis cumulative technology, that intrigues me,
p80
aVbecause I think it's the secret to understanding
p81
aVwhat's happening in the world.
p82
aVMy body's an accumulation of ideas too:
p83
aVthe idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.
p84
aVThey've come together.
p85
aVHow does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?
p86
aVWell, it uses sexual reproduction.
p87
aVIn an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,
p88
aVa green one and a red one,
p89
aVthen one has to be better than the other.
p90
aVOne goes extinct for the other to survive.
p91
aVBut if you have a sexual species,
p92
aVthen it's possible for an individual
p93
aVto inherit both mutations
p94
aVfrom different lineages.
p95
aVSo what sex does is it enables the individual
p96
aVto draw upon
p97
aVthe genetic innovations of the whole species.
p98
aVIt's not confined to its own lineage.
p99
aa(lp100
VWhat's the process that's having the same effect
p101
aVin cultural evolution
p102
aVas sex is having in biological evolution?
p103
aVAnd I think the answer is exchange,
p104
aVthe habit of exchanging one thing for another.
p105
aVIt's a unique human feature.
p106
aVNo other animal does it.
p107
aVYou can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange \u2014
p108
aVand indeed there's reciprocity in other animals \u2014
p109
aVBut the exchange of one object for another never happens.
p110
aVAs Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog
p111
aVmake a fair exchange of a bone with another dog."
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVYou can have culture without exchange.
p114
aVYou can have, as it were, asexual culture.
p115
aVChimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.
p116
aVThey teach each other traditions
p117
aVwhich are handed down from parent to offspring.
p118
aVIn this case, chimpanzees teaching each other
p119
aVhow to crack nuts with rocks.
p120
aVBut the difference is
p121
aVthat these cultures never expand, never grow,
p122
aVnever accumulate, never become combinatorial,
p123
aVand the reason is because
p124
aVthere is no sex, as it were,
p125
aVthere is no exchange of ideas.
p126
aVChimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.
p127
aVThere's no exchange of ideas between them.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd why does exchange raise living standards?
p130
aVWell, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.
p131
aVAnd here is a Stone Age version of his story,
p132
aValthough he told it in terms of trade between countries.
p133
aVAdam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.
p134
aVOz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.
p135
aVSo Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.
p136
aVHe doesn't need Adam.
p137
aVHe can make his own spears and axes.
p138
aVWell no, because if you think about it,
p139
aVif Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,
p140
aVand then they trade,
p141
aVthen they will each have saved an hour of work.
p142
aVAnd the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,
p143
aVbecause the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes
p144
aVand the better Oz is going to get at making spears.
p145
aVSo the gains from trade are only going to grow.
p146
aVAnd this is one of the beauties of exchange,
p147
aVis it actually creates the momentum
p148
aVfor more specialization,
p149
aVwhich creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.
p150
aVAdam and Oz both saved an hour of time.
p151
aVThat is prosperity, the saving of time
p152
aVin satisfying your needs.
p153
aa(lp154
VAsk yourself how long you would have to work
p155
aVto provide for yourself
p156
aVan hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.
p157
aVIf you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.
p158
aVYou find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.
p159
aVYou render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.
p160
aVHow long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.
p161
aVHow long do you actually have to work
p162
aVto earn an hour of reading light
p163
aVif you're on the average wage in Britain today?
p164
aVAnd the answer is about half a second.
p165
aVBack in 1950,
p166
aVyou would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage
p167
aVto acquire that much light.
p168
aVAnd that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained
p169
aVsince 1950, as it were,
p170
aVbecause that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,
p171
aVor you can acquire another good or service.
p172
aVAnd back in 1880,
p173
aVit would have been 15 minutes
p174
aVto earn that amount of light on the average wage.
p175
aVBack in 1800,
p176
aVyou'd have had to work six hours
p177
aVto earn a candle that could burn for an hour.
p178
aVIn other words, the average person on the average wage
p179
aVcould not afford a candle in 1800.
p180
aa(lp181
VGo back to this image of the axe and the mouse,
p182
aVand ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?"
p183
aVThe stone axe was made by someone for himself.
p184
aVIt was self-sufficiency.
p185
aVWe call that poverty these days.
p186
aVBut the object on the right
p187
aVwas made for me by other people.
p188
aVHow many other people?
p189
aVTens? Hundreds? Thousands?
p190
aVYou know, I think it's probably millions.
p191
aVBecause you've got to include the man who grew the coffee,
p192
aVwhich was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig,
p193
aVwho was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.
p194
aVThey were all working for me,
p195
aVto make a mouse for me.
p196
aVAnd that's the way society works.
p197
aVThat's what we've achieved as a species.
p198
aa(lp199
VIn the old days, if you were rich,
p200
aVyou literally had people working for you.
p201
aVThat's how you got to be rich; you employed them.
p202
aVLouis XIV had a lot of people working for him.
p203
aVThey made his silly outfits, like this,
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVand they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.
p206
aVHe had 498 people
p207
aVto prepare his dinner every night.
p208
aVBut a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles
p209
aVand looking at Louis XIV's pictures,
p210
aVhe has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.
p211
aVThey're in bistros and cafes and restaurants
p212
aVand shops all over Paris,
p213
aVand they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal
p214
aVthat's probably got higher quality
p215
aVthan Louis XIV even had.
p216
aVAnd that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.
p217
aVWe're able to draw upon specialization and exchange
p218
aVto raise each other's living standards.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow, you do get other animals working for each other too.
p221
aVAnts are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.
p222
aVBut there's a big difference,
p223
aVwhich is that it only happens within the colony.
p224
aVThere's no working for each other across the colonies.
p225
aVAnd the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.
p226
aVThat is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.
p227
aVThe queen does it all.
p228
aVIn our species, we don't like doing that.
p229
aVIt's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aVEven in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VSo when did this habit start?
p236
aVAnd how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?
p237
aVWell, I think, probably, the oldest version of this
p238
aVis probably the sexual division of labor.
p239
aVBut I've got no evidence for that.
p240
aVIt just looks like the first thing we did
p241
aVwas work male for female and female for male.
p242
aVIn all hunter-gatherer societies today,
p243
aVthere's a foraging division of labor
p244
aVbetween, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.
p245
aVIt isn't always quite that simple,
p246
aVbut there's a distinction between
p247
aVspecialized roles for males and females.
p248
aVAnd the beauty of this system
p249
aVis that it benefits both sides.
p250
aVThe woman knows
p251
aVthat, in the Hadzas' case here \u2014
p252
aVdigging roots to share with men in exchange for meat \u2014
p253
aVshe knows that all she has to do to get access to protein
p254
aVis to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.
p255
aVAnd she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt
p256
aVand try and kill a warthog.
p257
aVAnd the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging
p258
aVto get roots.
p259
aVAll he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog
p260
aVit's big enough to share some.
p261
aVAnd so both sides raise each other's standards of living
p262
aVthrough the sexual division of labor.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhen did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible
p265
aVthat Neanderthals didn't do this.
p266
aVThey were a highly cooperative species.
p267
aVThey were a highly intelligent species.
p268
aVTheir brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine
p269
aVin this room today.
p270
aVThey were imaginative. They buried their dead.
p271
aVThey had language, probably,
p272
aVbecause we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us,
p273
aVwhich was discovered here in Oxford.
p274
aVAnd so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.
p275
aVThey were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.
p276
aVBut there's no evidence
p277
aVof a sexual division of labor.
p278
aVThere's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.
p279
aVIt looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.
p280
aVAnd the other thing there's no evidence for
p281
aVis exchange between groups,
p282
aVbecause the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains,
p283
aVthe tools they made,
p284
aVare always made from local materials.
p285
aVFor example, in the Caucasus
p286
aVthere's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.
p287
aVThey're always made from local chert.
p288
aVIn the same valley there are modern human remains
p289
aVfrom about the same date, 30,000 years ago,
p290
aVand some of those are from local chert,
p291
aVbut more \u2014 but many of them are made
p292
aVfrom obsidian from a long way away.
p293
aVAnd when human beings began
p294
aVmoving objects around like this,
p295
aVit was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.
p296
aa(lp297
VTrade is 10 times as old as farming.
p298
aVPeople forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.
p299
aVExchange between groups has been going on
p300
aVfor a hundred thousand years.
p301
aVAnd the earliest evidence for it crops up
p302
aVsomewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa,
p303
aVwhen you see obsidian and jasper and other things
p304
aVmoving long distances in Ethiopia.
p305
aVYou also see seashells \u2014
p306
aVas discovered by a team here in Oxford \u2014
p307
aVmoving 125 miles inland
p308
aVfrom the Mediterranean in Algeria.
p309
aVAnd that's evidence that people
p310
aVhave started exchanging between groups.
p311
aVAnd that will have led to specialization.
p312
aa(lp313
VHow do you know that long-distance movement
p314
aVmeans trade rather than migration?
p315
aVWell, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals,
p316
aVwho quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa,
p317
aVwhich was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.
p318
aVThey traded them with their neighbors
p319
aVfor things like stingray barbs,
p320
aVand the consequence was that stone axes
p321
aVended up over a large part of Australia.
p322
aVSo long-distance movement of tools
p323
aVis a sign of trade, not migration.
p324
aa(lp325
VWhat happens when you cut people off from exchange,
p326
aVfrom the ability to exchange and specialize?
p327
aVAnd the answer is that
p328
aVnot only do you slow down technological progress,
p329
aVyou can actually throw it into reverse.
p330
aVAn example is Tasmania.
p331
aVWhen the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago,
p332
aVthe people on it not only experienced
p333
aVslower progress than people on the mainland,
p334
aVthey actually experienced regress.
p335
aVThey gave up the ability to make stone tools
p336
aVand fishing equipment and clothing
p337
aVbecause the population of about 4,000 people
p338
aVwas simply not large enough
p339
aVto maintain the specialized skills
p340
aVnecessary to keep the technology they had.
p341
aVIt's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.
p342
aVHow many of the things in our pockets
p343
aVcould we continue to make after 10,000 years?
p344
aVIt didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego \u2014
p345
aVsimilar island, similar people.
p346
aVThe reason: because Tierra del Fuego
p347
aVis separated from South America by a much narrower straight,
p348
aVand there was trading contact across that straight
p349
aVthroughout 10,000 years.
p350
aVThe Tasmanians were isolated.
p351
aa(lp352
VGo back to this image again
p353
aVand ask yourself, not only who made it and for who,
p354
aVbut who knew how to make it.
p355
aVIn the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.
p356
aVBut who knows how to make a computer mouse?
p357
aVNobody, literally nobody.
p358
aVThere is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.
p359
aVI mean this quite seriously.
p360
aVThe president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.
p361
aVHe just knows how to run a company.
p362
aVThe person on the assembly line doesn't know
p363
aVbecause he doesn't know how to drill an oil well
p364
aVto get oil out to make plastic, and so on.
p365
aVWe all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.
p366
aa(lp367
VI am of course quoting from a famous essay
p368
aVby Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s,
p369
aVcalled "I, Pencil"
p370
aVin which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made,
p371
aVand how nobody knows even how to make a pencil,
p372
aVbecause the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite,
p373
aVand they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.
p374
aVAnd what we've done in human society,
p375
aVthrough exchange and specialization,
p376
aVis we've created
p377
aVthe ability to do things that we don't even understand.
p378
aVIt's not the same with language.
p379
aVWith language we have to transfer ideas
p380
aVthat we understand with each other.
p381
aVBut with technology,
p382
aVwe can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.
p383
aa(lp384
VWe've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind
p385
aVto an extraordinary degree.
p386
aVAnd by the way,
p387
aVthat's one of the reasons that I'm not interested
p388
aVin the debate about I.Q.,
p389
aVabout whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.
p390
aVIt's completely irrelevant.
p391
aVWhat's relevant to a society
p392
aVis how well people are communicating their ideas,
p393
aVand how well they're cooperating,
p394
aVnot how clever the individuals are.
p395
aVSo we've created something called the collective brain.
p396
aVWe're just the nodes in the network.
p397
aVWe're the neurons in this brain.
p398
aVIt's the interchange of ideas,
p399
aVthe meeting and mating of ideas between them,
p400
aVthat is causing technological progress,
p401
aVincrementally, bit by bit.
p402
aVHowever, bad things happen.
p403
aVAnd in the future, as we go forward,
p404
aVwe will, of course, experience terrible things.
p405
aVThere will be wars; there will be depressions;
p406
aVthere will be natural disasters.
p407
aVAwful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.
p408
aVBut I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making,
p409
aVand the ability of ideas
p410
aVto meet and to mate
p411
aVas never before,
p412
aVI'm also sure
p413
aVthat technology will advance,
p414
aVand therefore living standards will advance.
p415
aVBecause through the cloud,
p416
aVthrough crowd sourcing,
p417
aVthrough the bottom-up world that we've created,
p418
aVwhere not just the elites but everybody
p419
aVis able to have their ideas
p420
aVand make them meet and mate,
p421
aVwe are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.
p422
aa(lp423
VThank you.

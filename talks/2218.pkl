VLet me show you something.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Video) Girl: Okay, that's a cat sitting in a bed.
p7
aVThe boy is petting the elephant.
p8
aVThose are people that are going on an airplane.
p9
aVThat's a big airplane.
p10
aa(lp11
VFei-Fei Li: This is a three-year-old child
p12
aVdescribing what she sees in a series of photos.
p13
aVShe might still have a lot to learn about this world,
p14
aVbut she's already an expert at one very important task:
p15
aVto make sense of what she sees.
p16
aVOur society is more technologically advanced than ever.
p17
aVWe send people to the moon, we make phones that talk to us
p18
aVor customize radio stations that can play only music we like.
p19
aVYet, our most advanced machines and computers
p20
aVstill struggle at this task.
p21
aVSo I'm here today to give you a progress report
p22
aVon the latest advances in our research in computer vision,
p23
aVone of the most frontier and potentially revolutionary
p24
aVtechnologies in computer science.
p25
aa(lp26
VYes, we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves,
p27
aVbut without smart vision, they cannot really tell the difference
p28
aVbetween a crumpled paper bag on the road, which can be run over,
p29
aVand a rock that size, which should be avoided.
p30
aVWe have made fabulous megapixel cameras,
p31
aVbut we have not delivered sight to the blind.
p32
aVDrones can fly over massive land,
p33
aVbut don't have enough vision technology
p34
aVto help us to track the changes of the rainforests.
p35
aVSecurity cameras are everywhere,
p36
aVbut they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool.
p37
aVPhotos and videos are becoming an integral part of global life.
p38
aVThey're being generated at a pace that's far beyond what any human,
p39
aVor teams of humans, could hope to view,
p40
aVand you and I are contributing to that at this TED.
p41
aVYet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding
p42
aVand managing this enormous content.
p43
aVSo in other words, collectively as a society,
p44
aVwe're very much blind,
p45
aVbecause our smartest  machines are still blind.
p46
aa(lp47
V"Why is this so hard?" you may ask.
p48
aVCameras can take pictures like this one
p49
aVby converting lights into a two-dimensional array of numbers
p50
aVknown as pixels,
p51
aVbut these are just lifeless numbers.
p52
aVThey do not carry meaning in themselves.
p53
aVJust like to hear is not the same as to listen,
p54
aVto take pictures is not the same as to see,
p55
aVand by seeing, we really mean understanding.
p56
aVIn fact, it took Mother Nature 540 million years of hard work
p57
aVto do this task,
p58
aVand much of that effort
p59
aVwent into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains,
p60
aVnot the eyes themselves.
p61
aVSo vision begins with the eyes,
p62
aVbut it truly takes place in the brain.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo for 15 years now, starting from my Ph.D. at Caltech
p65
aVand then leading Stanford's Vision Lab,
p66
aVI've been working with my mentors, collaborators and students
p67
aVto teach computers to see.
p68
aVOur research field is called computer vision and machine learning.
p69
aVIt's part of the general field of artificial intelligence.
p70
aVSo ultimately, we want to teach the machines to see just like we do:
p71
aVnaming objects, identifying people, inferring 3D geometry of things,
p72
aVunderstanding relations, emotions, actions and intentions.
p73
aVYou and I weave together entire stories of people, places and things
p74
aVthe moment we lay our gaze on them.
p75
aa(lp76
VThe first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects,
p77
aVthe building block of the visual world.
p78
aVIn its simplest terms, imagine this teaching process
p79
aVas showing the computers some training images
p80
aVof a particular object, let's say cats,
p81
aVand designing a model that learns from these training images.
p82
aVHow hard can this be?
p83
aVAfter all, a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors,
p84
aVand this is what we did in the early days of object modeling.
p85
aVWe'd tell the computer algorithm in a mathematical language
p86
aVthat a cat has a round face, a chubby body,
p87
aVtwo pointy ears, and a long tail,
p88
aVand that looked all fine.
p89
aVBut what about this cat?
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVIt's all curled up.
p92
aVNow you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model.
p93
aVBut what if cats are hidden?
p94
aVWhat about these silly cats?
p95
aVNow you get my point.
p96
aVEven something as simple as a household pet
p97
aVcan present an infinite number of variations to the object model,
p98
aVand that's just one object.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo about eight years ago,
p101
aVa very simple and profound observation changed my thinking.
p102
aVNo one tells a child how to see,
p103
aVespecially in the early years.
p104
aVThey learn this through real-world experiences and examples.
p105
aVIf you consider a child's eyes
p106
aVas a pair of biological cameras,
p107
aVthey take one picture about every 200 milliseconds,
p108
aVthe average time an eye movement is made.
p109
aVSo by age three, a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures
p110
aVof the real world.
p111
aVThat's a lot of training examples.
p112
aVSo instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms,
p113
aVmy insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data
p114
aVthat a child was given through experiences
p115
aVin both quantity and quality.
p116
aa(lp117
VOnce we know this,
p118
aVwe knew we needed to collect a data set
p119
aVthat has far more images than we have ever had before,
p120
aVperhaps thousands of times more,
p121
aVand together with Professor Kai Li at Princeton University,
p122
aVwe launched the ImageNet project in 2007.
p123
aVLuckily, we didn't have to mount a camera on our head
p124
aVand wait for many years.
p125
aVWe went to the Internet,
p126
aVthe biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created.
p127
aVWe downloaded nearly a billion images
p128
aVand used crowdsourcing technology like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform
p129
aVto help us to label these images.
p130
aVAt its peak, ImageNet was one of the biggest employers
p131
aVof the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers:
p132
aVtogether, almost 50,000 workers
p133
aVfrom 167 countries around the world
p134
aVhelped us to clean, sort and label
p135
aVnearly a billion candidate images.
p136
aVThat was how much effort it took
p137
aVto capture even a fraction of the imagery
p138
aVa child's mind takes in in the early developmental years.
p139
aa(lp140
VIn hindsight, this idea of using big data
p141
aVto train computer algorithms may seem obvious now,
p142
aVbut back in 2007, it was not so obvious.
p143
aVWe were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while.
p144
aVSome very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure,
p145
aVand we were constantly struggling for research funding.
p146
aVOnce, I even joked to my graduate students
p147
aVthat I would just reopen my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet.
p148
aVAfter all, that's how I funded my college years.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo we carried on.
p151
aVIn 2009, the ImageNet project delivered
p152
aVa database of 15 million images
p153
aVacross 22,000 classes of objects and things
p154
aVorganized by everyday English words.
p155
aVIn both quantity and quality,
p156
aVthis was an unprecedented scale.
p157
aVAs an example, in the case of cats,
p158
aVwe have more than 62,000 cats
p159
aVof all kinds of looks and poses
p160
aVand across all species of domestic and wild cats.
p161
aVWe were thrilled to have put together ImageNet,
p162
aVand we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it,
p163
aVso in the TED fashion, we opened up the entire data set
p164
aVto the worldwide research community for free.
p165
aV(Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VNow that we have the data to nourish our computer brain,
p168
aVwe're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves.
p169
aVAs it turned out, the wealth of information provided by ImageNet
p170
aVwas a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms
p171
aVcalled convolutional neural network,
p172
aVpioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima, Geoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun
p173
aVback in the 1970s and '80s.
p174
aVJust like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons,
p175
aVa basic operating unit in a neural network
p176
aVis a neuron-like node.
p177
aVIt takes input from other nodes
p178
aVand sends output to others.
p179
aVMoreover, these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes
p180
aVare organized in hierarchical layers,
p181
aValso similar to the brain.
p182
aVIn a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model,
p183
aVit has 24 million nodes,
p184
aV140 million parameters,
p185
aVand 15 billion connections.
p186
aVThat's an enormous model.
p187
aVPowered by the massive data from ImageNet
p188
aVand the modern CPUs and GPUs to train such a humongous model,
p189
aVthe convolutional neural network
p190
aVblossomed in a way that no one expected.
p191
aVIt became the winning architecture
p192
aVto generate exciting new results in object recognition.
p193
aVThis is a computer telling us
p194
aVthis picture contains a cat
p195
aVand where the cat is.
p196
aVOf course there are more things than cats,
p197
aVso here's a computer algorithm telling us
p198
aVthe picture contains a boy and a teddy bear;
p199
aVa dog, a person, and a small kite in the background;
p200
aVor a picture of very busy things
p201
aVlike a man, a skateboard, railings, a lampost, and so on.
p202
aVSometimes, when the computer is not so confident about what it sees,
p203
aVwe have taught it to be smart enough
p204
aVto give us a safe answer instead of committing too much,
p205
aVjust like we would do,
p206
aVbut other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us
p207
aVwhat exactly the objects are,
p208
aVlike the make, model, year of the cars.
p209
aa(lp210
VWe applied this algorithm to millions of Google Street View images
p211
aVacross hundreds of American cities,
p212
aVand we have learned something really interesting:
p213
aVfirst, it confirmed our common wisdom
p214
aVthat car prices correlate very well
p215
aVwith household incomes.
p216
aVBut surprisingly, car prices also correlate well
p217
aVwith crime rates in cities,
p218
aVor voting patterns by zip codes.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo wait a minute. Is that it?
p221
aVHas the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities?
p222
aVNot so fast.
p223
aVSo far, we have just taught the computer to see objects.
p224
aVThis is like a small child learning to utter a few nouns.
p225
aVIt's an incredible accomplishment,
p226
aVbut it's only the first step.
p227
aVSoon, another developmental milestone will be hit,
p228
aVand children begin to communicate in sentences.
p229
aVSo instead of saying this is a cat in the picture,
p230
aVyou already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences,
p233
aVthe marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm
p234
aVhas to take another step.
p235
aVNow, the computer has to learn from both pictures
p236
aVas well as natural language sentences
p237
aVgenerated by humans.
p238
aVJust like the brain integrates vision and language,
p239
aVwe developed a model that connects parts of visual things
p240
aVlike visual snippets
p241
aVwith words and phrases in sentences.
p242
aa(lp243
VAbout four months ago,
p244
aVwe finally tied all this together
p245
aVand produced one of the first computer vision models
p246
aVthat is capable of generating a human-like sentence
p247
aVwhen it sees a picture for the first time.
p248
aVNow, I'm ready to show you what the computer says
p249
aVwhen it sees the picture
p250
aVthat the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Video) Computer: A man is standing next to an elephant.
p253
aVA large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway.
p254
aa(lp255
VFFL: Of course, we're still working hard to improve our algorithms,
p256
aVand it still has a lot to learn.
p257
aV(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd the computer still makes mistakes.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Video) Computer: A cat lying on a bed in a blanket.
p262
aa(lp263
VFFL: So of course, when it sees too many cats,
p264
aVit thinks everything might look like a cat.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Video) Computer: A young boy is holding a baseball bat.
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VFFL: Or, if it hasn't seen a toothbrush, it confuses it with a baseball bat.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Video) Computer: A man riding a horse down a street next to a building.
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VFFL: We haven't taught Art 101 to the computers.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Video) Computer: A zebra standing in a field of grass.
p277
aa(lp278
VFFL: And it hasn't learned to appreciate the stunning beauty of nature
p279
aVlike you and I do.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo it has been a long journey.
p282
aVTo get from age zero to three was hard.
p283
aVThe real challenge is to go from three to 13 and far beyond.
p284
aVLet me remind you with this picture of the boy and the cake again.
p285
aVSo far, we have taught the computer to see objects
p286
aVor even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Video) Computer: A person sitting at a table with a cake.
p289
aa(lp290
VFFL: But there's so much more  to this picture
p291
aVthan just a person and a cake.
p292
aVWhat the computer doesn't see is that this is a special Italian cake
p293
aVthat's only served during Easter time.
p294
aVThe boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt
p295
aVgiven to him as a gift by his father after a trip to Sydney,
p296
aVand you and I can all tell how happy he is
p297
aVand what's exactly on his mind at that moment.
p298
aa(lp299
VThis is my son Leo.
p300
aVOn my quest for visual intelligence,
p301
aVI think of Leo constantly
p302
aVand the future world he will live in.
p303
aVWhen machines can see,
p304
aVdoctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes
p305
aVto help them to diagnose and take care of patients.
p306
aVCars will run smarter and safer on the road.
p307
aVRobots, not just humans,
p308
aVwill help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded.
p309
aVWe will discover new species,  better materials,
p310
aVand explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines.
p311
aa(lp312
VLittle by little, we're giving sight to the machines.
p313
aVFirst, we teach them to see.
p314
aVThen, they help us to see better.
p315
aVFor the first time, human eyes won't be the only ones
p316
aVpondering and exploring our world.
p317
aVWe will not only use the machines for their intelligence,
p318
aVwe will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine.
p319
aa(lp320
VThis is my quest:
p321
aVto give computers visual intelligence
p322
aVand to create a better future for Leo and for the world.
p323
aa(lp324
VThank you.

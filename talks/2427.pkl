VSo I come from the tallest people on the planet \u2014
p5
aVthe Dutch.
p6
aVIt hasn't always been this way.
p7
aVIn fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height.
p8
aVIn the last 150 years,
p9
aVin developed countries,
p10
aVon average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller.
p11
aVAnd scientists have a lot of theories about why this is,
p12
aVbut almost all of them involve nutrition,
p13
aVnamely the increase of dairy and meat.
p14
aa(lp15
VIn the last 50 years,
p16
aVglobal meat consumption has more than quadrupled,
p17
aVfrom 71 million tons to 310 million tons.
p18
aVSomething similar has been going on with milk and eggs.
p19
aVIn every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption.
p20
aVAnd we know that globally, we are getting richer.
p21
aVAnd as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population,
p22
aVfrom 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050,
p23
aVwhich means that by 2050,
p24
aVwe are going to need at least 70 percent more protein
p25
aVthan what is available to humankind today.
p26
aVAnd the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number,
p27
aVby the end of this century, at 11 billion,
p28
aVwhich means that we are going to need a lot more protein.
p29
aa(lp30
VThis challenge is staggering \u2014
p31
aVso much so, that recently,
p32
aVa team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested
p33
aVthat if we don't change our global policies
p34
aVand food production systems,
p35
aVour societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.
p36
aa(lp37
VCurrently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein.
p38
aVOver 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day.
p39
aVAt the same time,
p40
aVour global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger
p41
aVthan what our oceans can sustainably support,
p42
aVmeaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean
p43
aVthan the oceans can naturally replace.
p44
aa(lp45
VWWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years,
p46
aVour global marine life has been slashed in half.
p47
aVAnd another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species,
p48
aVsuch as swordfish and bluefin tuna,
p49
aVover 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet
p52
aVworking towards better practices and better-managed fisheries.
p53
aVBut ultimately,
p54
aVall of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant.
p55
aVIt's unlikely,
p56
aVeven with the best-managed fisheries,
p57
aVthat we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean
p58
aVthan we do today.
p59
aa(lp60
VWe have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have.
p61
aVWe need to alleviate the pressure on it.
p62
aVAnd we are at a point
p63
aVwhere if we push much harder for more produce,
p64
aVwe might face total collapse.
p65
aVOur current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo how do we fix this?
p68
aVWhat's the world going to look like in just 35 short years
p69
aVwhen there's 2.7 billion more of us sharing the same resources?
p70
aVWe could all become vegan.
p71
aVSounds like a great idea,
p72
aVbut it's not realistic
p73
aVand it's impossibly hard to mandate globally.
p74
aa(lp75
VPeople are eating animal protein whether we like it or not.
p76
aVAnd suppose we fail to change our ways
p77
aVand continue on the current path,
p78
aVfailing to meet demands.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe World Health Organization recently reported
p81
aVthat 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage,
p82
aVwhich is due to that same growing, global population
p83
aVand the declining access to resources like water, energy and land.
p84
aVIt takes very little imagination
p85
aVto picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition.
p86
aVPeople are hungry,
p87
aVand we are running dangerously low on natural resources.
p88
aVFor so, so many reasons,
p89
aVwe need to change our global food production systems.
p90
aa(lp91
VWe must do better
p92
aVand there is a solution.
p93
aVAnd that solution lies in aquaculture \u2014
p94
aVthe farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans.
p95
aVAs the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said,
p96
aV"We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters.
p97
aVThat's what civilization is all about \u2014 farming instead of hunting."
p98
aVFish is the last food that we hunt.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd why is it that we keep hearing phrases like,
p101
aV"Life's too short for farmed fish,"
p102
aVor, "Wild-caught, of course!"
p103
aVover fish that we know virtually nothing about?
p104
aVWe don't know what it ate during its lifetime,
p105
aVand we don't know what pollution it encounters.
p106
aVAnd if it was a large predatory species,
p107
aVit might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday.
p108
aVWe don't know.
p109
aVVery few people realize
p110
aVthe traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter
p111
aVthat caught the wild animal.
p112
aa(lp113
VBut let's back up for a second
p114
aVand talk about why fish is the best food choice.
p115
aVIt's healthy,
p116
aVit prevents heart disease,
p117
aVit provides key amino acids
p118
aVand key fatty acids like Omega-3s,
p119
aVwhich is very different from almost any other type of meat.
p120
aVAnd aside from being healthy,
p121
aVit's also a lot more exciting and diverse.
p122
aa(lp123
VThink about it \u2014 most animal farming is pretty monotonous.
p124
aVCow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,
p125
aVand poultry \u2014 turkey, duck, chicken \u2014 pretty much sums it up.
p126
aVAnd then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently.
p127
aVnot that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves,
p128
aVbut that's beside that point.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd you can farm fish in a very healthy manner
p131
aVthat's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish.
p132
aVI know I sound fish-obsessed \u2014
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VLet me explain:
p137
aVMy brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved
p138
aVin aquaculture a couple of years ago.
p139
aVWe were inspired by Sylvia Earle,
p140
aVwho won the TED Prize in 2009.
p141
aVWe actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos.
p142
aVAmy was there as the TED Prize Director;
p143
aVme, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen,
p144
aVlove to dive, passion for the oceans.
p145
aa(lp146
VMission Blue truly changed our lives.
p147
aVWe fell in love,
p148
aVgot married
p149
aVand we came away really inspired,
p150
aVthinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation \u2014
p151
aVsomething that was meant to last,
p152
aVthat could make a real difference
p153
aVand something that we could do together.
p154
aa(lp155
VLittle did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming.
p156
aVBut a few months after we got off the boat,
p157
aVwe got to a meeting at Conservation International,
p158
aVwhere the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture,
p159
aVasking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it,
p160
aVrealize what was going on
p161
aVand to really get involved
p162
aVbecause aquaculture has the potential
p163
aVto be just what our oceans and populations need.
p164
aa(lp165
VWe were stunned when we heard the stats
p166
aVthat we didn't know more about this industry already
p167
aVand excited about the chance to help get it right.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd to talk about stats \u2014
p170
aVright now, the amount of fish consumed globally,
p171
aVwild catch and farmed combined,
p172
aVis twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef
p173
aVproduced on planet earth last year.
p174
aVEvery single fishing vessel combined,
p175
aVsmall and large, across the globe,
p176
aVtogether produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood
p177
aVfor human consumption.
p178
aa(lp179
VAquaculture this year,
p180
aVfor the first time in history,
p181
aVactually produces more than what we catch from the wild.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut now this:
p184
aVDemand is going to go up.
p185
aVIn the next 35 years,
p186
aVwe are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand,
p187
aVwhich is one-and-a-half times as much, almost,
p188
aVas what we catch globally out of our oceans.
p189
aVAn enormous number.
p190
aa(lp191
VIt's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean.
p192
aVIt needs to come from farming.
p193
aVAnd talk about farming \u2014
p194
aVfor farming you need resources.
p195
aVAs a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive,
p196
aVso does an animal.
p197
aVA cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed
p198
aVand drink almost 8,000 liters of water
p199
aVto create just one pound of meat.
p200
aVExperts agree that it's impossible
p201
aVto farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet.
p202
aVWe just don't have enough feed or water.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it.
p205
aVAnd fresh water \u2014 planet earth has a very limited supply.
p206
aVWe need something more efficient
p207
aVto keep humankind alive on this planet.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd now let's compare that with fish farming.
p210
aVYou can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed,
p211
aVand depending on species, even less.
p212
aVAnd why is that?
p213
aVWell, that's because fish, first of all, float.
p214
aVThey don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do.
p215
aVAnd most fish are cold-blooded \u2014
p216
aVthey don't need to heat themselves.
p217
aVFish chills.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd it needs very little water,
p222
aVwhich is counterintuitive,
p223
aVbut as we say,
p224
aVit swims in it but it hardly drinks it.
p225
aVFish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind,
p226
aVaside from insects.
p227
aa(lp228
VHow much we've learned since.
p229
aVFor example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught
p230
aVfor human consumption,
p231
aVthere's an additional 30 million tons caught for animal feed,
p232
aVmostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry
p233
aVthat's turned into fish meal and fish oil.
p234
aa(lp235
VThis is madness.
p236
aVSixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed.
p237
aVSome of the worst issues of our time are connected to it.
p238
aVIt's destroying our oceans.
p239
aVThe worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it.
p240
aVRecently, an article came out of Stanford
p241
aVsaying that if 50 percent of the world's aquaculture industry
p242
aVwould stop using fish meal,
p243
aVour oceans would be saved.
p244
aVNow think about that for a minute.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow, we know that the oceans have far more problems \u2014
p247
aVthey have pollution, there's acidification,
p248
aVcoral reef destruction and so on.
p249
aVBut it underlines the impact of our fisheries,
p250
aVand it underlines how interconnected everything is.
p251
aVFisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,
p252
aVclimate change, food security and so on.
p253
aa(lp254
VIn the search for alternatives,
p255
aVthe industry, on a massive scale,
p256
aVhas reverted to plant-based alternatives
p257
aVlike soy, industrial chicken waste,
p258
aVblood meal from slaughterhouses
p259
aVand so on.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd we understand where these choices come from,
p262
aVbut this is not the right approach.
p263
aVIt's not sustainable,
p264
aVit's not healthy.
p265
aVHave you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean?
p266
aVOf course not.
p267
aVIf you feed salmon soy with nothing else,
p268
aVit literally explodes.
p269
aVSalmon is a carnivore,
p270
aVit has no way to digest soy.
p271
aa(lp272
VNow, fish farming is by far
p273
aVthe best animal farming available to humankind.
p274
aVBut it's had a really bad reputation.
p275
aVThere's been excessive use of chemicals,
p276
aVthere's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations,
p277
aVecosystem destruction and pollution,
p278
aVescaped fish breeding with wild populations,
p279
aValtering the overall genetic pool,
p280
aVand then of course, as just mentioned,
p281
aVthe unsustainable feed ingredients.
p282
aa(lp283
VHow blessed were the days
p284
aVwhen we could just enjoy food that was on our plate,
p285
aVwhatever it was.
p286
aVOnce you know, you know.
p287
aVYou can't go back.
p288
aVIt's not fun.
p289
aVWe really need a transparent food system that we can trust,
p290
aVthat produces healthy food.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut the good news is
p293
aVthat decades of development and research
p294
aVhave led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge
p295
aVthat allow us to do a lot better.
p296
aVWe can now farm fish without any of these issues.
p297
aa(lp298
VI think of agriculture before the green revolution \u2014
p299
aVwe are at aquaculture and the blue revolution.
p300
aVNew technologies means
p301
aVthat we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural,
p302
aVwith a minimal footprint
p303
aVthat consists of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae.
p304
aVHealthy for the people,
p305
aVhealthy for the fish,
p306
aVhealthy for the planet.
p307
aa(lp308
VMicrobes, for example,
p309
aVcan be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal \u2014
p310
aVat scale.
p311
aa(lp312
VInsects are the \u2014
p313
aVwell, first of all, the perfect recycling
p314
aVbecause they're grown on food waste;
p315
aVbut second,
p316
aVthink of fly-fishing,
p317
aVand you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed.
p318
aVYou don't need large tracts of land for it
p319
aVand you don't need to cut down rain forests for it.
p320
aVAnd microbes and insects are actually net water producers.
p321
aa(lp322
VThis revolution is starting as we speak,
p323
aVit just needs scale.
p324
aVWe can now farm far more species than ever before
p325
aVin controlled, natural conditions, creating happy fish.
p326
aa(lp327
VI imagine, for example,
p328
aVa closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming,
p329
aVwhere you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish
p330
aVwith little or no effluent,
p331
aValmost no energy and almost no water
p332
aVand a natural feed with a minimal footprint.
p333
aVOr a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other \u2014
p334
aVoff of each other,
p335
aVmimicking nature.
p336
aVYou need very little feed,
p337
aVvery little footprint.
p338
aVI think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish, for example.
p339
aa(lp340
VThere's great technologies popping up all over the globe.
p341
aVFrom alternatives to battle disease
p342
aVso we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore,
p343
aVto automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry,
p344
aVso we can save on feed and create less pollution.
p345
aVSoftware systems that gather data across farms,
p346
aVso we can improve farm practices.
p347
aa(lp348
VThere's really cool stuff happening all over the globe.
p349
aVAnd make no mistake \u2014 all of these things are possible
p350
aVat a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today.
p351
aVTomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo somebody needs to connect the dots
p354
aVand give these developments a big kick in the butt.
p355
aVAnd that's what we've been working on the last couple of years,
p356
aVand that's what we need to be working on together \u2014
p357
aVrethinking everything from the ground up,
p358
aVwith a holistic view across the value chain,
p359
aVconnecting all these things across the globe,
p360
aValongside great entrepreneurs
p361
aVthat are willing to share a collective vision.
p362
aa(lp363
VNow is the time to create change in this industry
p364
aVand to push it into a sustainable direction.
p365
aVThis industry is still young,
p366
aVmuch of its growth is still ahead.
p367
aVIt's a big task, but not as far-fetched as you might think.
p368
aVIt's possible.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo we need to take pressure off the ocean.
p371
aVWe want to eat good and healthy.
p372
aVAnd if we eat an animal, it needs to be one
p373
aVthat had a happy and healthy life.
p374
aa(lp375
VWe need to have a meal that we can trust,
p376
aVlive long lives.
p377
aVAnd this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe \u2014
p378
aVthis is for all of us.
p379
aVEven in the poorest countries,
p380
aVit's not just about money.
p381
aVPeople prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust
p382
aVover something that comes from far away that they know nothing about.
p383
aVWe're all the same.
p384
aa(lp385
VThe day will come
p386
aVwhere people will realize \u2014 no, demand \u2014 farmed fish on their plate
p387
aVthat's farmed well and that's farmed healthy \u2014
p388
aVand refuse anything less.
p389
aa(lp390
VYou can help speed this up.
p391
aVAsk questions when you order seafood.
p392
aVWhere does my fish come from?
p393
aVWho raised it,
p394
aVand what did it eat?
p395
aVInformation about where your fish comes from and how it was produced
p396
aVneeds to be much more readily available.
p397
aVAnd consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry
p398
aVto do the right thing.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo every time you order,
p401
aVask for detail
p402
aVand show that you really care about what you eat
p403
aVand what's been given to you.
p404
aVAnd eventually, they will listen.
p405
aVAnd all of us will benefit.
p406
aa(lp407
VThank you.

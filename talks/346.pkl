VWe really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.
p5
aVIf we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.
p6
aVThey're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is,
p9
aVa bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer
p10
aVwithin reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.
p11
aVI'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.
p12
aVOne is what's on the Boston Public Library.
p13
aVCarved above their door is, "Free to All."
p14
aVIt's kind of an inspiring statement,
p15
aVand I'll go back at the end of this.
p16
aVI'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge
p17
aVto as many people as want to read it.
p18
aVAnd the idea of using technology is perfect for us.
p19
aVI think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.
p20
aVIt's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,
p21
aVthey were able to build the Library of Alexandria \u2014
p22
aVthe idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.
p23
aVThe problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.
p24
aVOn the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.
p25
aVI think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.
p26
aVAnd I'm going to try to argue only one point today:
p27
aVthat universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.
p28
aVSo if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,
p29
aVyeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,
p30
aVeverything that was ever meant for distribution,
p31
aVavailable to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.
p32
aa(lp33
VYes, there's issues about how money should be distributed,
p34
aVand that's still being refigured out.
p35
aVBut I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand,
p36
aVso we can actually achieve that.
p37
aVBut I'm going to go over the technological, social
p38
aVand sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.
p39
aVAnd the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,
p40
aVthe books, music, video and just go step \u2014 media type by media type,
p41
aVjust go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?
p42
aa(lp43
VSo if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?
p44
aVWell, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?
p45
aVIf you wanted to put all of the published works online
p46
aVso that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?
p47
aVWell, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world
p48
aVis the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.
p49
aVIt is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.
p50
aVAnd a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,
p51
aVso \u2014 you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.
p52
aVSo a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes \u2014
p53
aVit goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.
p54
aV26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,
p55
aVon spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.
p56
aVSo for the cost of a house \u2014 or around here, a garage \u2014
p57
aVyou can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.
p58
aVThat's pretty neat.
p59
aa(lp60
VThen the question is, what do you get?
p61
aVYou know, is it worth trying to get there?
p62
aVDo you actually want it online?
p63
aVSome of the first things that people do is they make book readers
p64
aVthat allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.
p65
aVAnd you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.
p66
aVAnd you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.
p67
aVThere's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces
p68
aVthat look a whole lot like books in certain ways,
p69
aVand you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute \u2014
p70
aVstill very book-like \u2014 on your laptop.
p71
aVBut I don't know, reading things on a laptop \u2014
p72
aVwhenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.
p73
aVI think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.
p74
aVI don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.
p75
aVIt's starting to be a little bit more specified.
p76
aVBut I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.
p77
aVI like the physical book.
p78
aVAnd I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,
p79
aVput them on the Net, and then download,
p80
aVprint them and bind them, and end up with books again.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd we sort of said, well, how hard is this?
p83
aVAnd it turns out to not be very hard.
p84
aVWe actually went off to make a bookmobile.
p85
aVAnd a bookmobile \u2014 the size of a van with a satellite dish,
p86
aVa printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.
p87
aVIt costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.
p88
aVAnd they actually come out kind of nice looking.
p89
aVYou can actually get really good-looking books
p90
aVfor on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo the idea of \u2014 this technology actually may end up
p93
aVputting books back in people's hands again.
p94
aVThere are some other bookmobiles running around.
p95
aVThis is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond \u2014 Thoreau's works.
p96
aVThis is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,
p97
aVfor competing with the bookstore there.
p98
aVIn India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.
p99
aVAnd this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,
p100
aVthe new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.
p101
aVIt was quite popularly attended.
p102
aVAnd kids starting to make their own books,
p103
aVand a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.
p104
aVSo the idea of being able to use this technology
p105
aVto end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,
p106
aVbut I think it still has its place.
p107
aVAnd being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian
p108
aVsort of world,
p109
aVwe thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,
p110
aVwe might have something.
p111
aVSo we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.
p112
aVAnd we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,
p113
aVfly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection
p114
aVat the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,
p115
aVand get a program going making books in rural Uganda.
p116
aVAnd it actually \u2014 so technologically, it works.
p117
aa(lp118
VWhat we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.
p119
aVSo the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,
p120
aVbut we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.
p121
aVEverybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.
p122
aVAnd so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.
p123
aVThere are some newer technologies for delivering
p124
aVthat have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.
p125
aVOne is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.
p126
aVWe have one of these things now. It's completely cool.
p127
aVIt's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.
p128
aVAnd it's called the "Espresso Book Machine,"
p129
aVand in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.
p130
aa(lp131
VSomething else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain,
p132
aVbeyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,
p133
aVis some of these new little screens that are coming out.
p134
aVAnd one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.
p135
aVAnd I don't mean to steal any thunder here,
p136
aVbut we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.
p137
aVSo here's one of the beta units and you can \u2014
p138
aVit actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.
p139
aVAnd we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,
p140
aVand it turns out that 200 dots per inch
p141
aVmeans that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.
p142
aVAt 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.
p143
aVWe're in good enough shape.
p144
aVYou actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo the idea of electronic books is starting to come about.
p147
aVBut how do you go about doing all this scanning?
p148
aVSo we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.
p149
aVAnd there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation \u2014
p150
aVsent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.
p151
aVWell, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.
p152
aVSo we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.
p153
aVAnd then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.
p154
aVThe lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.
p155
aVIf you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,
p156
aVespecially if they're valuable books.
p157
aVIf they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,
p158
aVbecause you could just buy another one,
p159
aVthat's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.
p160
aVBut do things that you love.
p161
aVBut the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books \u2014
p162
aVabout 300,000 now \u2014 doing very well.
p163
aVThe Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut we sent \u2014 thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.
p166
aVHow do we go and do this, and how do we get it down
p167
aVso that it's a cost point that we could afford?
p168
aVAnd we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.
p169
aVIf it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,
p170
aVmake it so that you could download, print and bind it \u2014 the whole shebang \u2014
p171
aVwe would have achieved something.
p172
aVSo we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?
p173
aVAnd we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well \u2014
p174
aVsort of these auto-page-turning things.
p175
aVIf we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.
p176
aVBut it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.
p177
aVSo anyway \u2014 so we ended up making our own book scanner,
p178
aVand with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,
p179
aVcontrolled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,
p180
aVyou can go and get the proper intonation.
p181
aVSo you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.
p182
aVThis is not a fax, this is \u2014 the idea is to do a beautiful job
p183
aVas you're going through these libraries.
p184
aVAnd we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume.
p185
aVThis is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.
p186
aVAnd actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.
p187
aVPeople seem to love it.
p188
aVYes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.
p189
aV(Laughter)
p190
aVAnd especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,
p191
aVin languages that you can read.
p192
aVWe actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.
p193
aVSo 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.
p194
aVThe Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing \u2014
p195
aV26 million books \u2014 is about 750 million dollars, right?
p196
aVBut a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,
p197
aVand that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd what we've been able to do is get into libraries.
p200
aVWe've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,
p201
aVand libraries are up for having their books scanned.
p202
aVThe Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,
p203
aVwhich is where we have one these scanning centers,
p204
aVand scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.
p205
aVSo we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.
p206
aVThe thing we're missing is the 10 cents.
p207
aVIf we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.
p208
aVWe've scanned about 200,000 books.
p209
aVNow we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,
p210
aVand it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo all in all, that's going very well.
p213
aVAnd we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright
p214
aVinto the out-of-print world.
p215
aVSo I think of \u2014 we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,
p216
aVand Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.
p217
aVAnd I think we'll meet in the middle some place,
p218
aVand have the classic thing that you have,
p219
aVwhich is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.
p220
aVAnd so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.
p221
aVExactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.
p222
aVBut anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,
p223
aVthe Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries
p224
aVthat are starting to participate in this program,
p225
aVto try out this model of where does a library stop
p226
aVand where does the bookstore take over.
p227
aVSo all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.
p228
aVWe're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.
p229
aVSo, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month
p230
aVand we've got about 250,000 books online,
p231
aVcounting all the other projects that are starting to add in.
p232
aVSo what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.
p233
aVThe idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.
p234
aVYes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,
p235
aVbut one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.
p236
aVAnd then, there's business model issues
p237
aVabout how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.
p238
aVBut it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,
p239
aVat least for the out of print and out of copyright,
p240
aVwe suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these.
p243
aVSo how much is there?
p244
aVWell, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks
p245
aVhaving been published \u2014 so 78s, long-playing records and CDs \u2014
p246
aVor at least that's the largest archives of published materials
p247
aVwe've been able to sort of point at.
p248
aVIt costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk
p249
aVand put it online, if you're doing things in volume.
p250
aVBut we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.
p251
aVThis is a fairly heavily litigated area,
p252
aVso we've found that there are niches in the music world
p253
aVthat aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.
p254
aVAnd we've been starting to make these available by going
p255
aVand offering shelf space on the Net.
p256
aVIn the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?
p257
aVIf you give something to a charity or to the public,
p258
aVyou get a pat on the back and a tax donation \u2014
p259
aVexcept on the Net, where you can go broke.
p260
aVIf you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,
p261
aVyou can lose your guitars or your house.
p262
aa(lp263
VThis doesn't make any sense.
p264
aVSo we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,
p265
aVto anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.
p266
aVAnd we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.
p267
aVThe rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,
p268
aVas long as nobody made any money. You could \u2014
p269
aVconcert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,
p270
aVbut concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.
p271
aVAnd we get about two or three bands a day signing up.
p272
aVThey give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.
p273
aVWe have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,
p274
aVup on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.
p275
aVSo audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.
p276
aVWe've got a lot of collections now \u2014
p277
aVa couple hundred thousand items \u2014 and it's growing over time.
p278
aa(lp279
VMoving images: if you think of theatrical releases,
p280
aVthere are not that many of them.
p281
aVAs best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever
p282
aVthat are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.
p283
aVBut half of those were Indian.
p284
aVBut anyway, it's doable,
p285
aVbut we've only found about a thousand of these things that \u2014
p286
aVto be out of copyright.
p287
aVSo we've digitized those and made those available.
p288
aVBut we've found that there's lots of other types of movies
p289
aVthat haven't really seen the light of day \u2014 archival films.
p290
aVWe've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,
p291
aVall sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.
p292
aVSo we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.
p293
aVWe're not quite a YouTube.
p294
aVWe tended towards longer-term things
p295
aVand also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,
p296
aVwhich has just been great fun.
p297
aa(lp298
VTelevision comes quite a bit larger.
p299
aVWe started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.
p300
aVIt's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.
p301
aVIt's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television \u2014
p302
aVRussian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC \u2014
p303
aV24 hours a day.
p304
aVWe only put one week up,
p305
aVwhich is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11,
p306
aVsort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see?
p307
aVCNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.
p308
aVWere they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out.
p309
aVHow can we have critical thinking without being able to quote
p310
aVand being able to compare what happened in the past?
p311
aVAnd television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,
p312
aVexcept by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.
p313
aVSo anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.
p314
aVSo 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,
p315
aVwe're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively
p316
aVand have them up on the Net.
p317
aVAnd we've got, now, a lot of these materials.
p318
aVSo we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.
p319
aVSo books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.
p320
aVMostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.
p321
aVBut we've worked through some of those,
p322
aVbut we've still got real problems in Washington.
p323
aa(lp324
VWell, we're best known as the World Wide Web.
p325
aVWe've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.
p326
aVWe take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.
p327
aVAnd actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,
p328
aVwhich donates this collection to the Internet Archive.
p329
aVAnd it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource.
p330
aVAnd we've made a Wayback Machine
p331
aVthat you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.
p332
aVIf you go and search on something \u2014 this is Google.com,
p333
aVthe different versions of it that we have,
p334
aVthis is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,
p335
aVand this is what it looked like at Stanford.
p336
aVSo anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.
p337
aVMostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.
p338
aVIf there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,
p339
aVwhich is probably best known for burning,
p340
aVis, don't just have one copy.
p341
aVSo we've started to \u2014 we've made another copy of all of this
p342
aVand we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.
p343
aVSo this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.
p344
aVAnd we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.
p345
aVSo, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,
p346
aVflood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...
p347
aVso we're hedging our bets here.
p348
aVIf we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.
p349
aa(lp350
VThere's a political and social question out of this.
p351
aVIs all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?
p352
aVThere's some large companies that have seen this vision,
p353
aVthat are doing large-scale digitization,
p354
aVbut they're locking up the public domain.
p355
aVThe question is, is that the world that we really want to live in?
p356
aVWhat's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?
p357
aVHow do we go and have a world where we both have libraries
p358
aVand publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up?
p359
aVSo universal access to all knowledge \u2014
p360
aVI think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind,
p361
aVlike the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria.
p362
aVIt could be something that we're remembered for,
p363
aVfor millennia, for having achieved.
p364
aVAnd as I said before, I'll end with something
p365
aVthat's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.
p366
aVCarnegie \u2014 one of the great capitalists of this country \u2014
p367
aVcarved above his legacy, "Free to the People."
p368
aVThank you very much.

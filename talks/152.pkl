(lp4
VIt's very, very difficult
p5
aVto speak at the end of a conference like this,
p6
aVbecause everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.
p7
aVSo I thought that what may be useful is to remind us
p8
aVof some of the things that have gone on here,
p9
aVand then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,
p10
aVand take forward and work on.
p11
aVThat's what I'd like to try and do.
p12
aVWe came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter."
p13
aVBut we are talking about "Africa: the Next Chapter"
p14
aVbecause we are looking at the old and the present chapter \u2014 that we're looking at,
p15
aVand saying it's not such a good thing.
p16
aVThe picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease
p17
aVis what we usually see.
p18
aVWhat we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter,"
p19
aVand that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.
p20
aVAnd I think it's worth remembering what we've heard
p21
aVthrough the conference right from the first day,
p22
aVwhere I heard that all the important statistics have been given \u2014
p23
aVabout where we are now,
p24
aVabout how the continent is doing much better.
p25
aVAnd the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo I'm not going to spend too much time \u2014
p28
aVjust to show you, refresh your memories
p29
aVthat we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first time
p30
aVthere really is a platform to build on.
p31
aVWe really do have it going right
p32
aVthat the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.
p33
aVAfter decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,
p34
aVand it's going to \u2014 projected \u2014 6 and 7 percent even.
p35
aVAnd inflation has come down.
p36
aVExternal debt \u2014 something that I can tell you a long story about
p37
aVbecause I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent \u2014
p38
aVhas come down dramatically.
p39
aVYou know, as you can see,
p40
aVfrom almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.
p41
aVNow this is a huge achievement.
p42
aa(lp43
VYou know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?
p44
aVIt's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies
p45
aVand gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.
p46
aVWe've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference
p47
aVbecause private investment flows have increased.
p48
aVI want to remind you again \u2014
p49
aVI know you saw these statistics before \u2014
p50
aVfrom almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.
p51
aVIn 2005, remittances \u2014 I just took one country, Nigeria
p52
aVskyrocketing \u2014 skyrocketing is too dramatic,
p53
aVbut increasing dramatically.
p54
aVAnd in many other countries this is happening.
p55
aVWhy is this important? Because it shows confidence.
p56
aVPeople are now confident to bring \u2014
p57
aVif your people in the diaspora bring their money back,
p58
aVit shows other people that, look,
p59
aVthere is emerging confidence in your country.
p60
aVAnd instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?
p63
aVIt's important that we build this platform,
p64
aVthat we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying,
p65
aV"Look, we must do something different."
p66
aVBecause we are confronted with a challenge.
p67
aV62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.
p68
aVWhat does this mean?
p69
aVThis means that we have to focus on how our youth
p70
aVare going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.
p71
aVYou have to focus on how to create jobs,
p72
aVmake sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.
p73
aVBut most of all that they are productively engaged in life,
p74
aVand that they are creating the kind of productive environment
p75
aVin our countries that will make things happen.
p76
aVAnd to support this, I just recently \u2014
p77
aVone of the things I've done since leaving government
p78
aVis to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.
p79
aVMost of our countries don't even have any opinion research.
p80
aVPeople don't have voice.
p81
aVThere is no way you can know what people want.
p82
aa(lp83
VOne of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.
p84
aVLike in every other country where this has been done,
p85
aVjobs is the top issue.
p86
aVI want to leave this up here and come back to it.
p87
aVBut before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.
p88
aVAnd to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform
p89
aVthat now enables us to move forward \u2014
p90
aVand we mustn't make light of it.
p91
aVIt was only 5, 6, 7 years ago
p92
aVwe couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.
p93
aVWe were going nowhere.
p94
aVThe economies were not growing.
p95
aVWe were having negative per capita growth.
p96
aVThe microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward
p97
aVwas not even there.
p98
aVSo let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,
p99
aVincluding all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.
p100
aVCreating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,
p101
aVbuilding institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo now we have this platform we can build on.
p104
aVAnd it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:
p105
aVaid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.
p106
aVAnd someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things
p107
aVis that it's been a simplistic debate.
p108
aVAnd that's not what the debate should be about.
p109
aVThat's engaging in the wrong debate.
p110
aVThe issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors,
p111
aVthe private sector and ordinary African people
p112
aVtaking charge of their own lives?
p113
aVHow do we combine all this?
p114
aVTo move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing
p115
aVthat I talked about \u2014 getting young people employed.
p116
aVGetting the creative juices flowing on this continent,
p117
aVmuch of what you have seen here.
p118
aVSo I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.
p119
aVWe need to bring it back to say,
p120
aVwhat is the combination of all these factors
p121
aVthat is going to yield what we want? (Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd I want to tell you something.
p124
aVFor me, the issue about aid \u2014
p125
aVI don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side
p126
aVand feel bad about aid.
p127
aVAfrica has been giving the other countries aid.
p128
aVMo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that
p129
aVhe dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.
p130
aVAnd I said, "Mo, you're right. We have \u2014 no, but we've already been doing it!
p131
aVThe U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid."
p132
aa(lp133
V(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VIt is all the resources that were taken from Africa,
p136
aVincluding human, that built these countries today!
p137
aVSo when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.
p138
aVThe issue is not that.
p139
aVThe issue is how are we using what has been given back.
p140
aVHow are we using it?
p141
aVIs it being directed effectively?
p142
aVI want to tell you a little story.
p143
aVWhy I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.
p144
aVFrom 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war \u2014 the Nigeria-Biafra war.
p145
aVAnd in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.
p146
aVWe spent much of our time with my mother cooking.
p147
aVFor the army \u2014 my father joined the army as a brigadier \u2014 the Biafran army.
p148
aVWe were on the Biafran side.
p149
aVAnd we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place,
p150
aVbut wherever we could help we did.
p151
aVAt a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.
p152
aVWe were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.
p153
aVPeople, children were dying of kwashiorkor.
p154
aVI'm sure some of you who are not so young
p155
aVwill remember those pictures.
p156
aVWell, I was in the middle of it.
p157
aa(lp158
VIn the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.
p159
aVWe thought she was going to die.
p160
aVMy father was not there.
p161
aVHe was in the army.
p162
aVSo I was the oldest person in the house.
p163
aVMy sister fell very ill with malaria.
p164
aVShe was three years old and I was 15.
p165
aVAnd she had such a high fever. We tried everything.
p166
aVIt didn't look like it was going to work.
p167
aVUntil we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was
p168
aVlooking at people and giving them meds.
p169
aVNow I put my sister on my back \u2014 burning \u2014
p170
aVand I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.
p171
aVIt was really hot. I was very hungry.
p172
aVI was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.
p173
aVWe heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.
p174
aVI walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.
p175
aVI got there and I saw huge crowds.
p176
aVAlmost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.
p177
aVShe was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?
p178
aa(lp179
VI had to crawl in between the legs of these people
p180
aVwith my sister strapped on my back,
p181
aVfind a way to a window.
p182
aVAnd while they were trying to break down the door,
p183
aVI climbed in through the window, and jumped in.
p184
aVThis woman told me it was in the nick of time.
p185
aVBy the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.
p186
aVShe gave a shot of her chloroquine \u2014 what I learned was the chloroquine then \u2014
p187
aVgave her some \u2014 it must have been a re-hydration \u2014
p188
aVand some other therapies, and put us in a corner.
p189
aVIn about two to three hours, she started to move.
p190
aVAnd then they toweled her down because she started sweating,
p191
aVwhich was a good sign.
p192
aVAnd then my sister woke up.
p193
aVAnd about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.
p194
aVI strapped her on my back.
p195
aVI walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.
p196
aVI was so happy \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 that my sister was alive!
p197
aVToday she's 41 years old, a mother of three,
p198
aVand she's a physician saving other lives.
p199
aa(lp200
VWhy am I telling that? I'm telling you that because \u2014
p201
aVwhen it is you or your person involved \u2014
p202
aVyou don't care where \u2014 whether it's aid.
p203
aVYou don't care what it is! (Applause)
p204
aVYou just want the person to be alive!
p205
aVAnd now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives \u2014
p206
aVwhich some of the aid we get does on this continent \u2014
p207
aVwhen you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother,
p208
aVthey are contributing productively into the economy.
p209
aVAnd as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.
p210
aVThese are people who are productive agents in the economy.
p211
aVSo if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria,
p212
aVit means they can form the base of production for our economy.
p213
aVAnd by the same token \u2014
p214
aVas someone said yesterday \u2014 if we don't and they die,
p215
aVtheir children will become a burden on the economy.
p216
aVSo even from an economic standpoint,
p217
aVif we leave the social and the humanitarian,
p218
aVwe need to save lives now.
p219
aVSo that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say
p220
aVlet's channel these resources we get into something productive.
p221
aVHowever, I will also tell you that I'm one of those
p222
aVwho doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.
p223
aVThat's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.
p224
aVYou know, we have to use it well.
p225
aa(lp226
VWhat has happened in Europe?
p227
aVDo you all know that Spain \u2014 part of the EU \u2014
p228
aVgot 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?
p229
aVResources that were transferred to them \u2014
p230
aVand were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!
p231
aVThe EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?
p232
aVHave you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.
p233
aVInfrastructure everywhere.
p234
aVIt is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain
p235
aVhas developed into a services economy.
p236
aVDid you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?
p237
aVIreland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.
p238
aVFor which many people, even from other parts of the world,
p239
aVare going there to find jobs.
p240
aVWhat did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?
p241
aVThey used it to build an information superhighway,
p242
aVgain infrastructure that
p243
aVenables them to participate in the
p244
aVinformation technology revolution,
p245
aVand to create jobs in their economy.
p246
aVThey didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this."
p247
aVToday, the European Union is busy transferring aid.
p248
aVMy frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain \u2014
p249
aVwhich is roads, highways, other things that they can build \u2014
p250
aVI say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid
p251
aVto build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)
p252
aa(lp253
VWhen we ask them and tell them what we need,
p254
aVone of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.
p255
aVNow we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that
p256
aVand the EU.
p257
aVWe also have private citizens now who have a lot of money \u2014
p258
aVsome of them in this audience, with private foundations.
p259
aVAnd one day, these foundations have so much money,
p260
aVthey will overtake the official aid that is being given.
p261
aVBut I fear \u2014 and I'm very grateful to all of them
p262
aVfor what they are trying to do on the continent \u2014
p263
aVbut I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly
p264
aVbecause I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.
p265
aVAnd they're also going from country to country,
p266
aVand many times trying to find what to do.
p267
aVBut I'm not really sure that their assistance
p268
aVis also being channeled in the right way.
p269
aVAnd many of them are not really familiar with the continent.
p270
aVThey are just discovering.
p271
aVAnd many times I don't see Africans working with them.
p272
aVThey are just going alone! (Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested
p275
aVin hearing from Africans who might know.
p276
aVThey want to visit us,
p277
aVsee what's happening on the ground and make a decision.
p278
aVAnd now I'm maybe being harsh.
p279
aVBut I worry because this money is so important.
p280
aVNow, who are they accountable to?
p281
aVAre we on their boards when they make decisions
p282
aVabout where to channel money? Are we there?
p283
aVWill we make the same mistake that we made before?
p284
aVHave our presidents and our leaders \u2014 everyone is talking about \u2014
p285
aVhave they ever called these people together and said,
p286
aV"Look, your foundation and your foundation \u2014
p287
aVyou have so much money, we are grateful.
p288
aVLet's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled
p289
aVand where this aid should go."
p290
aVHave we done that? The answer is no.
p291
aVAnd each one is making their own individual effort.
p292
aVAnd then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa,
p293
aVand we would still have the same problems.
p294
aa(lp295
VThis is what gives us the hopeless image.
p296
aVOur inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money,
p297
aV"Sit down."
p298
aVAnd we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.
p299
aVWe've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros,
p300
aVand everybody else who is helping and say,
p301
aV"Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.
p302
aVAs a continent, here are our priorities.
p303
aVHere is where we want you to channel this money."
p304
aVEach one should not be an entrepreneur
p305
aVgoing out and finding what is best.
p306
aVWe're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.
p307
aVAnd what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.
p308
aVTen years from now we will have the same story,
p309
aVand we will be repeating the same things.
p310
aVSo our problem right now is, how can we leverage
p311
aVall this good will that is coming towards our way?
p312
aVHow can we get government to combine properly
p313
aVwith these private foundations, with the international organizations,
p314
aVand with our private sector.
p315
aa(lp316
VI firmly believe in that private sector thing too.
p317
aVBut it cannot do it alone.
p318
aVSo there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.
p319
aVThey said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.
p320
aVSo why don't we think of using some of this aid?
p321
aVWell, why don't we first say to those helping us out,
p322
aV"Don't be shy about infrastructure.
p323
aVThat health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.
p324
aVThat education will work better
p325
aVif we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.
p326
aVThat agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.
p327
aVDon't be shy of it.
p328
aVInvest some of your resources in that, too."
p329
aVAnd then we can see that this is one combination
p330
aVof private, international, multilateral money,
p331
aVprivate sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership,
p332
aVso that aid can be a facilitator.
p333
aVThat is all aid can be.
p334
aVAid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.
p335
aVBut it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic,
p336
aVwe would have failed.
p337
aa(lp338
VOne of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now \u2014
p339
aVone of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid
p340
aVand China is coming to take resources.
p341
aVIt's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.
p342
aVIf you tell them, "We need a road here,"
p343
aVthey will help you build it.
p344
aVThey don't shy away from infrastructure.
p345
aVIn fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me,
p346
aVwhen I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.
p347
aVHe said, "There are two things you need only.
p348
aVInfrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
p349
aVYou are undisciplined." (Applause)
p350
aVAnd I repeat it for the continent.
p351
aVIt's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
p352
aVSo we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.
p353
aVNow I realize \u2014 I'm not saying \u2014 health and education \u2014
p354
aVno, you can also provide that as well.
p355
aVBut I'm saying it's not either or.
p356
aVLet's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.
p357
aVOne idea.
p358
aVSecond thing, for the private sector,
p359
aVpeople are afraid to take risks on the continent.
p360
aVWhy can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms,
p361
aVto enable people to take risk?
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd finally, because they are both standing at my \u2014 I'm out of time.
p366
aVAm I out of time?
p367
aVOK, so let me not forget my punchline.
p368
aVOne of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is
p369
aVto support women, to create jobs. (Applause)
p370
aVA lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.
p371
aVBut there are people \u2014 women \u2014 creating jobs.
p372
aVAnd we know, studies have shown
p373
aVthat when you put resources in the hand of the woman \u2014
p374
aVin fact, there's an econometric study,
p375
aVthe World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that
p376
aVtransfers into the hands of women result
p377
aVin healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.
p378
aVSo I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here \u2014
p379
aVI'm not saying the men are not important \u2014
p380
aVobviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?
p381
aVThey'll come back home and get disgruntled,
p382
aVand it will result in difficulties we don't want.
p383
aVWe don't want men beating their wives
p384
aVbecause they don't have a job, and so on.
p385
aa(lp386
VBut at the margin, we also \u2014 I want to push this,
p387
aVbecause the reason is the men automatically \u2014
p388
aVthey get \u2014 not automatically, but they tend to get more support.
p389
aVBut I want you to realize that resources
p390
aVin the hands of African women is a powerful tool.
p391
aVThere are people creating jobs.
p392
aVBeatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.
p393
aVWe have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.
p394

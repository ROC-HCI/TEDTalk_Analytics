VA fact
p5
aVcame out of MIT,
p6
aVcouple of years ago. Ken Hale,
p7
aVwho's a linguist,
p8
aVsaid that of the 6,000 languages
p9
aVspoken on Earth right now,
p10
aV3,000 aren't spoken by the children.
p11
aVSo that in one generation,
p12
aVwe're going to halve our cultural diversity.
p13
aVHe went on to say
p14
aVthat every two weeks,
p15
aVan elder goes to the grave
p16
aVcarrying the last spoken word
p17
aVof that culture.
p18
aVSo an entire philosophy,
p19
aVa body of knowledge about the natural world
p20
aVthat had been empirically gleaned over centuries,
p21
aVgoes away.
p22
aVAnd this happens every two weeks.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo for the last 20 years,
p25
aVsince my dental experience,
p26
aVI have been traveling the world
p27
aVand coming back
p28
aVwith stories about some of these people.
p29
aVWhat I'd like to do right now
p30
aVis share some of those stories with you.
p31
aVThis is Tamdin.
p32
aVShe is a 69-year-old nun.
p33
aVShe was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years
p34
aVfor putting up a little tiny placard
p35
aVprotesting the occupation of her country.
p36
aVAnd when I met her, she had just
p37
aVtaken a walk over the Himalayas
p38
aVfrom Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,
p39
aVinto Nepal, across to India \u2014
p40
aV30 days \u2014
p41
aVto meet her leader, the Dalai Lama.
p42
aVThe Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.
p43
aVSo I took this picture three days
p44
aVafter she arrived,
p45
aVand she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on,
p46
aVwith her toes sticking out.
p47
aVAnd she crossed in March,
p48
aVand there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.
p49
aa(lp50
VThis is Paldin.
p51
aVPaldin is a 62-year-old monk.
p52
aVAnd he spent 33 years in prison.
p53
aVHis whole monastery was thrown into prison
p54
aVat the time of the uprising,
p55
aVwhen the Dalai Lama had to leave
p56
aVTibet.
p57
aVAnd
p58
aVhe was beaten, starved,
p59
aVtortured \u2014 lost all his teeth while in prison.
p60
aVAnd when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.
p61
aVAnd it really impressed me \u2014
p62
aVI met him two weeks after he got out of prison \u2014
p63
aVthat he went through that experience, and ended up
p64
aVwith the demeanor that he had.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I was in Dharamsala meeting these people,
p67
aVand I'd spent about five weeks there,
p68
aVand I was hearing these similar stories
p69
aVof these refugees that had poured out of Tibet
p70
aVinto Dharamsala.
p71
aVAnd it just so happened, on the fifth week,
p72
aVthere was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.
p73
aVAnd
p74
aVI was watching this crowd of monks and nuns,
p75
aVmany of which I had just interviewed,
p76
aVand heard their stories,
p77
aVand I watched their faces,
p78
aVand they gave us a little FM radio,
p79
aVand we could listen to the translation of his teachings.
p80
aVAnd what he said was:
p81
aVtreat your enemies as if they were precious jewels,
p82
aVbecause it's your enemies
p83
aVthat build your tolerance and patience
p84
aVon the road to your enlightenment.
p85
aVThat hit me so hard,
p86
aVtelling these people that had been through this experience.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo, two months later, I went into
p89
aVTibet, and I started
p90
aVinterviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do.
p91
aVI interview and do portraits.
p92
aVAnd this is a little girl.
p93
aVI took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple.
p94
aVAnd I'd snuck in \u2014
p95
aVbecause it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet \u2014
p96
aVit's the quickest way you can get arrested.
p97
aVSo I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama,
p98
aVand I would hand them out.
p99
aVAnd when I gave them to the people,
p100
aVthey'd either hold them to their heart,
p101
aVor they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.
p102
aVAnd this is \u2014
p103
aVwell, at the time \u2014 I did this 10 years ago \u2014
p104
aVthat was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo
p107
aVI was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.
p108
aVThis is Jigme and her sister, Sonam.
p109
aVAnd they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau,
p110
aVway in the western part of the country.
p111
aVThis is at 17,000 feet.
p112
aVAnd they had just come down from the high pastures,
p113
aVat 18,000 feet.
p114
aVSame thing: gave her a picture,
p115
aVshe held it up to her forehead.
p116
aVAnd I usually hand out Polaroids
p117
aVwhen I do these, because I'm setting up lights,
p118
aVand checking my lights,
p119
aVand when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent.
p120
aa(lp121
VThis is Tenzin Gyatso;
p122
aVhe was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two,
p123
aVout in a peasant's house,
p124
aVway out in the middle of nowhere.
p125
aVAt the age of four, he was installed
p126
aVas the 14th Dalai Lama.
p127
aVAs a teenager, he faced
p128
aVthe invasion of his country,
p129
aVand had to deal with it \u2014 he was the leader of the country.
p130
aVEight years later, when they discovered there was a plot
p131
aVto kill him,
p132
aVthey dressed him up like a beggar
p133
aVand snuck him out of the country on horseback,
p134
aVand took the same trip that Tamdin did.
p135
aVAnd he's never been back to his country since.
p136
aVAnd
p137
aVif you think about this man,
p138
aV46 years later,
p139
aVstill sticking
p140
aVto this non-violent response
p141
aVto a severe political and human rights issue.
p142
aVAnd the young people,
p143
aVyoung Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.
p144
aVYou know, violence as a political tool
p145
aVis all the rage right now.
p146
aVAnd
p147
aVhe still is holding this line.
p148
aVSo this is our icon
p149
aVto non-violence in our world \u2014
p150
aVone of our living icons.
p151
aa(lp152
VThis is another leader of his people.
p153
aVThis is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
p154
aVAnd Moi is 35 years old.
p155
aVAnd
p156
aVthis area of the Ecuadorian Amazon \u2014
p157
aVoil was discovered in 1972.
p158
aVAnd in this period of time \u2014 since that time \u2014
p159
aVas much oil, or twice as much oil
p160
aVas was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident,
p161
aVwas spilled in this little area of the Amazon,
p162
aVand the tribes in this area have constantly had to move.
p163
aVAnd Moi
p164
aVbelongs to the Huaorani tribe,
p165
aVand they're known as
p166
aVvery fierce, they're known as "auca."
p167
aVAnd they've managed to keep out
p168
aVthe seismologists and the oil workers
p169
aVwith spears and blowguns.
p170
aVAnd we spent \u2014
p171
aVI was with a team \u2014
p172
aVtwo weeks with these guys out in the jungle
p173
aVwatching them hunt.
p174
aVThis was on a monkey hunt,
p175
aVhunting with curare-tipped darts.
p176
aVAnd the knowledge that these people have
p177
aVabout the natural environment is incredible.
p178
aVThey could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.
p179
aVAnd I couldn't even see the monkeys
p180
aVthat they were
p181
aVgetting with these darts.
p182
aa(lp183
VThis is Yadira,
p184
aVand Yadira is
p185
aVfive years old. She's in a
p186
aVtribe that's neighboring the Huaorani.
p187
aVAnd her tribe has had to move
p188
aVthree times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.
p189
aVAnd we never hear about that. And the latest
p190
aVinfraction against these people is,
p191
aVas part of Plan Colombia,
p192
aVwe're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is \u2014
p193
aVwe're defoliating thousands of acres
p194
aVof the Ecuadorian Amazon
p195
aVin our war on drugs.
p196
aVAnd these people are the people who take the brunt of it.
p197
aa(lp198
VThis is Mengatoue.
p199
aVHe's the shaman of the Huaorani,
p200
aVand
p201
aVhe said to us, you know, I'm an older man now;
p202
aVI'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired
p203
aVof spearing these oil workers.
p204
aVI wish they would just go away.
p205
aVAnd I was \u2014 I usually travel alone
p206
aVwhen I do my work, but I did this \u2014
p207
aVI hosted a program for Discovery,
p208
aVand when I went down with the team,
p209
aVI was quite concerned about
p210
aVgoing in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani,
p211
aVdeep into the Huaorani tribe.
p212
aVAnd
p213
aVas it turned out, these guys really
p214
aVtaught me a thing or two about blending in
p215
aVwith the locals.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VOne of the things I did
p219
aVjust before 9/11 \u2014
p220
aVAugust of 2001 \u2014
p221
aVI took my son, Dax,
p222
aVwho was 16 at the time,
p223
aVand I took him to Pakistan.
p224
aVBecause at first I wanted \u2014
p225
aVyou know, I've taken him on a couple of trips,
p226
aVbut I wanted him to see
p227
aVpeople that live on a dollar a day or less.
p228
aVI wanted him to get an experience
p229
aVin the Islamic world
p230
aVand I also wanted him to \u2014
p231
aVI was going there to work with a group,
p232
aVdo a story on a group called the Kalash,
p233
aVthat are a group of animists, 3,000 animists,
p234
aVthat live \u2014 very small area \u2014
p235
aVsurrounded by Islam \u2014 there's 3,000
p236
aVof these Kalash left; they're incredible people.
p237
aVSo it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them,
p238
aVdrumming and dancing.
p239
aVAnd he brought a soccer ball,
p240
aVand we had soccer every night in this little village.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd then we went up
p243
aVand met their shaman.
p244
aVBy the way, Mengatoue was the shaman
p245
aVof his tribe as well.
p246
aVAnd this is John Doolikahn,
p247
aVwho's the shaman of the Kalash.
p248
aVAnd he's up in the mountains,
p249
aVright on the border with Afghanistan.
p250
aVIn fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora,
p251
aVthe area where
p252
aVOsama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area.
p253
aVAnd we watched
p254
aVand stayed with
p255
aVJohn Doolikahn.
p256
aVAnd the shaman \u2014 I did a whole series on shamanism,
p257
aVwhich is
p258
aVan interesting phenomenon.
p259
aVBut around the world,
p260
aVthey go into trance in different ways,
p261
aVand in Pakistan,
p262
aVthe way they do it is they burn juniper leaves
p263
aVand they sacrifice an animal,
p264
aVpour the blood of the animal on the leaves
p265
aVand then inhale the smoke.
p266
aVAnd they're all praying
p267
aVto the mountain gods
p268
aVas they go into trance.
p269
aa(lp270
VYou know,
p271
aVgetting kids used to different realities,
p272
aVI think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day \u2014
p273
aVhaving a curriculum where they study different religions,
p274
aVjust to make a mental flexibility,
p275
aVgive them a mental flexibility
p276
aVin different belief systems \u2014
p277
aVI think this is so necessary in our world today
p278
aVas you see these clash of beliefs taking place.
p279
aVAnd all the security issues they cause us.
p280
aVSo, one thing we did five years ago:
p281
aVwe started a program that links kids
p282
aVin indigenous communities with kids in the United States.
p283
aVSo we first hooked up
p284
aVa spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.
p285
aVWe now have 15 sites.
p286
aVWe have one in Kathmandu, Nepal;
p287
aVDharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya \u2014
p288
aVTakaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim
p289
aVand one-third animist, the community is \u2014
p290
aVOllantaytambo, Peru,
p291
aVand Arctic Village, Alaska.
p292
aa(lp293
VThis is Daniel; he's one of our students
p294
aVin Arctic Village, Alaska.
p295
aVHe lives in this log cabin \u2014
p296
aVno running water, no heat other than \u2014
p297
aVno windows
p298
aVand high-speed Internet connection.
p299
aVAnd this is \u2014
p300
aVI see this rolling out all over \u2014
p301
aVthis is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago,
p302
aVwhere they first saw their first computers;
p303
aVnow they have computers in their classrooms.
p304
aVAnd the way we've done this \u2014
p305
aVwe teach digital storytelling to these kids.
p306
aVAnd we have them tell stories about issues in their community
p307
aVin their community that they care about.
p308
aVAnd this is in Peru, where the kids told the story
p309
aVabout a river that they cleaned up.
p310
aVAnd the way we do it is, we do it in workshops,
p311
aVand we bring people who want to learn
p312
aVdigital workflow and storytelling,
p313
aVand have them
p314
aVwork with the kids.
p315
aVAnd just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in,
p316
aVand this has worked the best.
p317
aVSo our dream is to bring teenagers together,
p318
aVso they'll have a community service experience
p319
aVas well as a cross-cultural experience,
p320
aVas they teach kids in these areas
p321
aVand help them build their communication infrastructure.
p322
aa(lp323
VThis is teaching Photoshop
p324
aVin the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.
p325
aVWe have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.
p326
aVThis is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies
p327
aVthat these kids have made,
p328
aVand they're quite incredible.
p329
aVThe one I want to show you \u2014
p330
aVafter we get them to make the movies,
p331
aVwe have a night where we show the movies to the community.
p332
aVAnd this is in Takaungu \u2014
p333
aVwe've got a generator and a digital projector,
p334
aVand we're projecting it up against a barn,
p335
aVand showing one of the movies that they made.
p336
aVAnd if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see
p337
aVthe incredible work these kids do.
p338
aa(lp339
VThe other thing:
p340
aVI wanted to give indigenous people a voice.
p341
aVThat was one of the big motivating factors.
p342
aVBut the other motivating factor is
p343
aVthe insular nature of our country.
p344
aVNational Geographic just did a Roper Study
p345
aVof 18 to 26 year olds
p346
aVin our country
p347
aVand in nine other industrialized countries.
p348
aVIt was a two million dollar study.
p349
aVUnited States came in second to last
p350
aVin geographic knowledge.
p351
aV70 percent of the kids couldn't find
p352
aVAfghanistan or Iraq on a map;
p353
aV60 percent couldn't find India;
p354
aV30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean.
p355
aVAnd this is a study
p356
aVthat was just done a couple of years ago.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo what I'd like to show you now,
p359
aVin the couple of minutes I have left,
p360
aVis a film that a student made in Guatemala.
p361
aVWe just had a workshop in Guatemala.
p362
aVA week before we got to the workshop,
p363
aVa massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan,
p364
aVlast October, came in and buried
p365
aV600 people alive in their village.
p366
aVAnd this kid lived in the village \u2014
p367
aVhe wasn't there at the time \u2014
p368
aVand this is the little movie he put together about that.
p369
aVAnd he hadn't seen a computer before
p370
aVwe did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and \u2014
p371
aVyeah, we can play it.
p372
aa(lp373
VThis is an old Mayan funeral chant
p374
aVthat he got from his grandfather.
p375
aa(lp376
VThank you very much.
p377
aV(Applause)

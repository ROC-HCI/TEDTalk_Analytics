VSo I started working
p5
aVwith refugees because I wanted
p6
aVto make a difference,
p7
aVand making a difference starts
p8
aVwith telling their stories.
p9
aVSo when I meet refugees,
p10
aVI always ask them questions.
p11
aVWho bombed your house?
p12
aVWho killed your son?
p13
aVDid the rest of your family make it out alive?
p14
aVHow are you coping
p15
aVin your life in exile?
p16
aVBut there's one question that always seems to me
p17
aVto be most revealing, and that is:
p18
aVWhat did you take?
p19
aVWhat was that most important thing
p20
aVthat you had to take with you
p21
aVwhen the bombs were exploding in your town,
p22
aVand the armed gangs were approaching your house?
p23
aa(lp24
VA Syrian refugee boy I know
p25
aVtold me that he didn't hesitate
p26
aVwhen his life was in imminent danger.
p27
aVHe took his high school diploma,
p28
aVand later he told me why.
p29
aVHe said, "I took my high school diploma
p30
aVbecause my life depended on it."
p31
aVAnd he would risk his life to get that diploma.
p32
aVOn his way to school, he would dodge snipers.
p33
aVHis classroom sometimes shook
p34
aVwith the sound of bombs and shelling,
p35
aVand his mother told me,
p36
aV"Every day, I would say to him every morning,
p37
aV'Honey, please don't go to school.'"
p38
aVAnd when he insisted, she said,
p39
aV"I would hug him as if it were for the last time."
p40
aVBut he said to his mother,
p41
aV"We're all afraid,
p42
aVbut our determination to graduate
p43
aVis stronger than our fear."
p44
aa(lp45
VBut one day, the family got terrible news.
p46
aVHany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin
p47
aVwere murdered in their homes for refusing
p48
aVto leave their house.
p49
aVTheir throats were slit.
p50
aVIt was time to flee.
p51
aa(lp52
VThey left that day, right away, in their car,
p53
aVHany hidden in the back because they were facing
p54
aVcheckpoints of menacing soldiers.
p55
aVAnd they would cross the border into Lebanon,
p56
aVwhere they would find peace.
p57
aVBut they would begin a life of grueling hardship
p58
aVand monotony.
p59
aVThey had no choice but to build a shack
p60
aVon the side of a muddy field,
p61
aVand this is Hany's brother Ashraf,
p62
aVwho plays outside.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd that day, they joined
p65
aVthe biggest population of refugees in the world,
p66
aVin a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.
p67
aVIt only has four million citizens,
p68
aVand there are one million Syrian refugees living there.
p69
aVThere's not a town, a city or a village
p70
aVthat is not host to Syrian refugees.
p71
aVThis is generosity and humanity
p72
aVthat is remarkable.
p73
aVThink about it this way, proportionately.
p74
aVIt would be as if
p75
aVthe entire population of Germany,
p76
aV80 million people,
p77
aVwould flee to the United States in just three years.
p78
aVHalf of the entire population of Syria
p79
aVis now uprooted,
p80
aVmost of them inside the country.
p81
aVSix and a half million people
p82
aVhave fled for their lives.
p83
aVOver and well over three million people
p84
aVhave crossed the borders
p85
aVand have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries,
p86
aVand only a small proportion, as you see,
p87
aVhave moved on to Europe.
p88
aVWhat I find most worrying
p89
aVis that half of all Syrian refugees are children.
p90
aVI took this picture of this little girl.
p91
aVIt was just two hours after she had arrived
p92
aVafter a long trek from Syria into Jordan.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd most troubling of all
p95
aVis that only 20 percent of  Syrian refugee children
p96
aVare in school in Lebanon.
p97
aVAnd yet, Syrian refugee children,
p98
aVall refugee children tell us
p99
aVeducation is the most important thing in their lives.
p100
aVWhy? Because it allows them to think of their future
p101
aVrather than the nightmare of their past.
p102
aVIt allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.
p103
aa(lp104
VI'm reminded of a recent visit I took
p105
aVto a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq,
p106
aVand I met this girl,
p107
aVand I thought, "She's beautiful,"
p108
aVand I went up to her and asked her,
p109
aV"Can I take your picture?"
p110
aVAnd she said yes,
p111
aVbut she refused to smile.
p112
aVI think she couldn't,
p113
aVbecause I think she must realize that she represents
p114
aVa lost generation of Syrian refugee children,
p115
aVa generation isolated and frustrated.
p116
aVAnd yet, look at what they fled:
p117
aVutter destruction,
p118
aVbuildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.
p119
aVHany's home was also destroyed.
p120
aVThis will need to be rebuilt
p121
aVby architects, by engineers, by electricians.
p122
aVCommunities will need teachers and lawyers
p123
aVand politicians interested in reconciliation
p124
aVand not revenge.
p125
aVShouldn't this be rebuilt
p126
aVby the people with the largest stake,
p127
aVthe societies in exile, the refugees?
p128
aa(lp129
VRefugees have a lot of time
p130
aVto prepare for their return.
p131
aVYou might imagine that being a refugee
p132
aVis just a temporary state.
p133
aVWell far from it.
p134
aVWith wars going on and on,
p135
aVthe average time a refugee will spend in exile
p136
aVis 17 years.
p137
aVHany was into his second year in limbo
p138
aVwhen I went to visit him recently,
p139
aVand we conducted our entire conversation in English,
p140
aVwhich he confessed to me he learned
p141
aVfrom reading all of Dan Brown's novels
p142
aVand from listening to American rap.
p143
aVWe also spent some nice moments of laughter
p144
aVand fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.
p145
aVBut I'll never forget what he told me
p146
aVwhen we ended our conversation that day.
p147
aVHe said to me,
p148
aV"If I am not a student, I am nothing."
p149
aa(lp150
VHany is one of 50 million people
p151
aVuprooted in this world today.
p152
aVNever since World War II
p153
aVhave so many people been forcibly displaced.
p154
aVSo while we're making sweeping progress
p155
aVin human health,
p156
aVin technology, in education and design,
p157
aVwe are doing dangerously little
p158
aVto help the victims
p159
aVand we are doing far too little
p160
aVto stop and prevent
p161
aVthe wars that are driving them from their homes.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd there are more and more victims.
p164
aVEvery day, on average,
p165
aVby the end of this day,
p166
aV32,000 people will be forcibly displaced
p167
aVfrom their homes \u2014
p168
aV32,000 people.
p169
aVThey flee across borders like this one.
p170
aVWe captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,
p171
aVand this is a typical day.
p172
aVOr they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,
p173
aVrisking their lives in this case
p174
aVjust to reach safety in Europe.
p175
aVThis Syrian young man
p176
aVsurvived one of these boats that capsized \u2014
p177
aVmost of the people drowned \u2014
p178
aVand he told us,
p179
aV"Syrians are just looking for a quiet place
p180
aVwhere nobody hurts you,
p181
aVwhere nobody humiliates you,
p182
aVand where nobody kills you."
p183
aVWell, I think that should be the minimum.
p184
aVHow about a place of healing,
p185
aVof learning,
p186
aVand even opportunity?
p187
aVAmericans and Europeans
p188
aVhave the impression that proportionally
p189
aVhuge numbers of refugees are coming
p190
aVto their country,
p191
aVbut the reality is
p192
aVthat 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,
p193
aVare living in the developing world,
p194
aVin countries struggling with their own insecurity,
p195
aVwith their own issues of helping their own populations
p196
aVand poverty.
p197
aVSo wealthy countries in the world should recognize
p198
aVthe humanity and the generosity of the countries
p199
aVthat are hosting so many refugees.
p200
aVAnd all countries should make sure that no one
p201
aVfleeing war and persecution
p202
aVarrives at a closed border.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Applause)
p205
aa(lp206
VThank you.
p207
aa(lp208
VBut there is something more that we can do
p209
aVthan just simply helping refugees survive.
p210
aVWe can help them thrive.
p211
aVWe should think of refugee camps and communities
p212
aVas more than just temporary population centers
p213
aVwhere people languish
p214
aVwaiting for the war to end.
p215
aVRather, as centers of excellence,
p216
aVwhere refugees can triumph over their trauma
p217
aVand train for the day that they can go home
p218
aVas agents of positive change
p219
aVand social transformation.
p220
aa(lp221
VIt makes so much sense,
p222
aVbut I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia
p223
aVthat has been raging on for 22 years.
p224
aVAnd imagine living in this camp.
p225
aVI visited this camp.
p226
aVIt's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,
p227
aVand it was so remote
p228
aVthat we had to take a helicopter to fly there.
p229
aVIt was dusty and it was terribly hot.
p230
aVAnd we went to visit a school
p231
aVand started talking to the children,
p232
aVand then I saw this girl across the room
p233
aVwho looked to me to be the same age
p234
aVas my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.
p235
aVAnd I asked her the questions
p236
aVthat grown-ups ask kids,
p237
aVlike, "What is your favorite subject?"
p238
aVand, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p239
aVAnd this is when her face turned blank,
p240
aVand she said to me,
p241
aV"I have no future.
p242
aVMy schooling days are over."
p243
aVAnd I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,
p244
aVso I turned to my colleague
p245
aVand she confirmed to me
p246
aVthere is no funding for secondary education
p247
aVin this camp.
p248
aVAnd how I wished at that moment
p249
aVthat I could say to her,
p250
aV"We will build you a school."
p251
aVAnd I also thought, what a waste.
p252
aVShe should be and she is
p253
aVthe future of Somalia.
p254
aa(lp255
VA boy named Jacob Atem
p256
aVhad a different chance, but not before he experienced
p257
aVterribly tragedy.
p258
aVHe watched \u2014 this is in Sudan \u2014
p259
aVas his village \u2014 he was only seven years old \u2014
p260
aVburned to the ground, and he learned
p261
aVthat his mother and his father
p262
aVand his entire family
p263
aVwere killed that day.
p264
aVOnly his cousin survived, and the two of them
p265
aVwalked for seven months \u2014
p266
aVthis is boys like him \u2014
p267
aVchased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs,
p268
aVand they finally made it to refugee camps
p269
aVwhere they found safety,
p270
aVand he would spend the next seven years
p271
aVin Kenya in a refugee camp.
p272
aa(lp273
VBut his life changed
p274
aVwhen he got the chance to be resettled
p275
aVto the United States,
p276
aVand he found love in a foster family
p277
aVand he was able to go to school,
p278
aVand he wanted me to share with you
p279
aVthis proud moment
p280
aVwhen he graduated from university.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Applause)
p283
aa(lp284
VI spoke to him on Skype the other day,
p285
aVand he was in his new university in Florida
p286
aVpursuing his Ph.D. in public health,
p287
aVand he proudly told me how he was able to raise
p288
aVenough funds from the American public
p289
aVto establish a health clinic back in his village
p290
aVback home.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo I want to take you back to Hany.
p293
aVWhen I told him I was going to have the chance
p294
aVto speak to you here on the TED stage,
p295
aVhe allowed me to read you a poem
p296
aVthat he sent in an email to me.
p297
aa(lp298
VHe wrote:
p299
aV"I miss myself,
p300
aVmy friends,
p301
aVtimes of reading novels or writing poems,
p302
aVbirds and tea in the morning.
p303
aVMy room, my books, myself,
p304
aVand everything that was making me smile.
p305
aVOh, oh, I had so many dreams
p306
aVthat were about to be realized."
p307
aa(lp308
VSo here is my point:
p309
aVNot investing in refugees
p310
aVis a huge missed opportunity.
p311
aVLeave them abandoned,
p312
aVand they risk exploitation and abuse,
p313
aVand leave them unskilled and uneducated,
p314
aVand delay by years the return
p315
aVto peace and prosperity in their countries.
p316
aVI believe how we treat the uprooted
p317
aVwill shape the future of our world.
p318
aVThe victims of war can hold the keys
p319
aVto lasting peace,
p320
aVand it's the refugees
p321
aVwho can stop the cycle of violence.
p322
aa(lp323
VHany is at a tipping point.
p324
aVWe would love to help him go to university
p325
aVand to become an engineer,
p326
aVbut our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:
p327
aVtents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,
p328
aVfood rations and a bit of medicine.
p329
aVUniversity is a luxury.
p330
aVBut leave him to languish in this muddy field,
p331
aVand he will become a member
p332
aVof a lost generation.
p333
aVHany's story is a tragedy,
p334
aVbut it doesn't have to end that way.
p335
aa(lp336
VThank you.

VThe future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.
p5
aVThe best minds in the best institutions
p6
aVgenerally get it wrong.
p7
aVThis is in technology. This is in the area of politics,
p8
aVwhere pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong.
p9
aVAnd it's clearly in the area of finance.
p10
aVWith institutions established to think about the future,
p11
aVthe IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming.
p12
aVOver 20,000 economists
p13
aVwhose job it is, competitive entry to get there,
p14
aVcouldn't see what was happening.
p15
aa(lp16
VGlobalization is getting more complex.
p17
aVAnd this change is getting more rapid.
p18
aVThe future will be more unpredictable.
p19
aVUrbanization, integration,
p20
aVcoming together, leads to a new renaissance.
p21
aVIt did this a thousand years ago.
p22
aVThe last 40 years have been extraordinary times.
p23
aVLife expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.
p24
aVIt took from the Stone Age to achieve that.
p25
aVIncome has gone up for a majority of the world's population,
p26
aVdespite the population going up by about two billion people over this period.
p27
aVAnd illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth.
p28
aVA huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential
p29
aVfor innovation, for development.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut there is an underbelly.
p32
aVThere are two Achilles' heels of globalization.
p33
aVThere is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality \u2014
p34
aVthose that are left out, those that feel angry,
p35
aVthose that are not participating. Globalization
p36
aVhas not been inclusive.
p37
aVThe second Achilles' heel is complexity \u2014
p38
aVa growing fragility, a growing brittleness.
p39
aVWhat happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.
p40
aVThis is a systemic risk, systemic shock.
p41
aVWe've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu.
p42
aVIt will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against.
p43
aa(lp44
VA lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology.
p45
aVThere have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement
p46
aVin what you can get for the same price
p47
aVin computing by 2030.
p48
aVThat's what the experience of the last 20 years has been.
p49
aVIt will continue.
p50
aVOur computers, our systems will be as primitive
p51
aVas the Apollo's are for today.
p52
aVOur mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine.
p53
aVOur mobile phones are more powerful than
p54
aVsome of the strongest computers of 20 years ago.
p55
aVSo what will this do?
p56
aVIt will create huge opportunities in technology.
p57
aVMiniaturization as well.
p58
aVThere will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies,
p59
aVin our brains, and in the air.
p60
aVThis is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.
p61
aa(lp62
VThis sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential,
p63
aVnot least in the area of medicine.
p64
aVThis is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford,
p65
aVfrom an embryonic stem cell.
p66
aVWe can develop any part of the body.
p67
aVIncreasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin \u2014
p68
aVable to replicate parts of the body.
p69
aVFantastic potential for regenerative medicine.
p70
aVI don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030,
p71
aVbecause of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body.
p72
aVBut the question is, "Who will have it?"
p73
aa(lp74
VThe other major development is going to be
p75
aVin the area of what can happen in genetics.
p76
aVThe capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified,
p77
aVsomething which goes three times faster,
p78
aVlasts for three times longer, we could produce,
p79
aVas this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years,
p80
aVusing about the same amount of food.
p81
aVBut will this only be available for the super rich,
p82
aVfor those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics?
p83
aVWill only those that are able to afford it
p84
aVbe able to be this super race of the future?
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VSo the big question for us is,
p88
aV"How do we manage this technological change?"
p89
aVHow do we ensure that it creates
p90
aVa more inclusive technology,
p91
aVa technology which means
p92
aVthat not only as we grow older,
p93
aVthat we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support
p94
aVthe populations of the future?
p95
aVOne of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements
p96
aVwill be moving from population pyramids
p97
aVto what we might term population coffins.
p98
aVThere is unlikely to be a pension
p99
aVor a retirement age in 2030.
p100
aVThese will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.
p101
aa(lp102
VThe most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper
p103
aVtype of new pyramids
p104
aVthat will take place in China and in many other countries.
p105
aVSo forget about retirements if you're young.
p106
aVForget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going.
p107
aVOf course, migration will become even more important.
p108
aVThe war on talent, the need to attract people
p109
aVat all skill ranges,
p110
aVto push us around in our wheelchairs,
p111
aVbut also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.
p112
aa(lp113
VThe employment in the rich countries
p114
aVwill go down from about 800
p115
aVto about 700 million of these people.
p116
aVThis would imply a massive leap in migration.
p117
aVSo the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today,
p118
aVof migration, will be turned on their head,
p119
aVas we search for people to help us sort out
p120
aVour pensions and our economies in the future.
p121
aVAnd then, the systemic risks.
p122
aVWe understand that these will become much more virulent,
p123
aVthat what we see today
p124
aVis this interweaving of societies, of systems,
p125
aVfastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems.
p126
aVSmall levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility.
p127
aa(lp128
VThe collapse in biodiversity,
p129
aVclimate change, pandemics, financial crises:
p130
aVthese will be the currency that we will think about.
p131
aVAnd so a new awareness will have to arise,
p132
aVof how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves,
p133
aVin a new way, and come together as a community
p134
aVto manage systemic risk.
p135
aVIt's going to require innovation.
p136
aVIt's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization
p137
aVcould also be its downfall.
p138
aVThis could be our best century ever because of the achievements,
p139
aVor it could be our worst.
p140
aVAnd of course we need to worry about the individuals,
p141
aVparticularly the individuals that feel that they've
p142
aVbeen left out in one way or another.
p143
aa(lp144
VAn individual, for the first time in the history of humanity,
p145
aVwill have the capacity, by 2030,
p146
aVto destroy the planet, to wreck everything,
p147
aVthrough the creation, for example, of a biopathogen.
p148
aVHow do we begin to weave these tapestries together?
p149
aVHow do we think about complex systems in new ways?
p150
aVThat will be the challenge of the scholars,
p151
aVand of all of us engaged in thinking about the future.
p152
aVThe rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now.
p153
aVWe need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized.
p154
aVIt cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring.
p155
aVWe have to develop a new way of managing the planet,
p156
aVcollectively, through collective wisdom.
p157
aa(lp158
VWe know, and I know from my own experience,
p159
aVthat amazing things can happen,
p160
aVwhen individuals and societies come together
p161
aVto change their future.
p162
aVI left South Africa, and 15 years later,
p163
aVafter thinking I would never go back,
p164
aVI had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela.
p165
aVThis was a miracle. We can create miracles,
p166
aVcollectively, in our lifetime.
p167
aVIt is vital that we do so.
p168
aVIt is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED,
p169
aVthat the ideas that we think about
p170
aVlook forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century,
p171
aVand not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.
p172
aVThank you. (Applause)

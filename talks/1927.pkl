VThe world is changing
p5
aVin some really profound ways,
p6
aVand I worry that investors
p7
aVaren't paying enough attention
p8
aVto some of the biggest drivers of change,
p9
aVespecially when it comes to sustainability.
p10
aVAnd by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things,
p11
aVlike environmental and social issues
p12
aVand corporate governance.
p13
aVI think it's reckless to ignore these things,
p14
aVbecause doing so can jeopardize
p15
aVfuture long-term returns.
p16
aVAnd here's something that may surprise you:
p17
aVthe balance of power to really influence sustainability
p18
aVrests with institutional investors,
p19
aVthe large investors like pension funds,
p20
aVfoundations and endowments.
p21
aVI believe that sustainable investing
p22
aVis less complicated than you think,
p23
aVbetter-performing than you believe,
p24
aVand more important than we can imagine.
p25
aa(lp26
VLet me remind you what we already know.
p27
aVWe have a population that's both growing and aging;
p28
aVwe have seven billion souls today
p29
aVheading to 10 billion
p30
aVat the end of the century;
p31
aVwe consume natural resources
p32
aVfaster than they can be replenished;
p33
aVand the emissions that are mainly responsible
p34
aVfor climate change just keep increasing.
p35
aVNow clearly, these are environmental and social issues,
p36
aVbut that's not all.
p37
aVThey're economic issues,
p38
aVand that makes them relevant
p39
aVto risk and return.
p40
aVAnd they are really complex
p41
aVand they can seem really far off,
p42
aVthat the temptation may be to do this:
p43
aVbury our heads in the sand and not think about it.
p44
aVResist this, if you can. Don't do this at home.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VBut it makes me wonder
p48
aVif the investment rules of today
p49
aVare fit for purpose tomorrow.
p50
aVWe know that investors,
p51
aVwhen they look at a company and decide whether to invest,
p52
aVthey look at financial data,
p53
aVmetrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,
p54
aVvaluation \u2014 you know, the really sexy stuff.
p55
aVAnd these things are fundamental, of course,
p56
aVbut they're not enough.
p57
aVInvestors should also look at performance metrics
p58
aVin what we call ESG:
p59
aVenvironment, social and governance.
p60
aVEnvironment includes energy consumption,
p61
aVwater availability, waste and pollution,
p62
aVjust making efficient uses of resources.
p63
aVSocial includes human capital,
p64
aVthings like employee engagement
p65
aVand innovation capacity,
p66
aVas well as supply chain management
p67
aVand labor rights and human rights.
p68
aVAnd governance relates to the oversight
p69
aVof companies by their boards and investors.
p70
aVSee, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.
p71
aVBut ESG is the measure of sustainability,
p72
aVand sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors
p73
aVwith financial factors into the investment process.
p74
aVIt means limiting future risk
p75
aVby minimizing harm to people and planet,
p76
aVand it means providing capital to users
p77
aVwho deploy it towards productive
p78
aVand sustainable outcomes.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo if sustainability matters financially today,
p81
aVand all signs indicate more tomorrow,
p82
aVis the private sector paying attention?
p83
aVWell, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.
p84
aVThey started to see sustainability
p85
aVnot just as important but crucial to business success.
p86
aVAbout 80 percent of global CEOs
p87
aVsee sustainability as the root to growth in innovation
p88
aVand leading to competitive advantage
p89
aVin their industries.
p90
aVBut 93 percent see ESG as the future,
p91
aVor as important to the future of their business.
p92
aVSo the views of CEOs are clear.
p93
aVThere's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo how are companies actually leveraging ESG
p96
aVto drive hard business results?
p97
aVOne example is near and dear to our hearts.
p98
aVIn 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications
p99
aVto the cloud environment,
p100
aVand we retired another 85.
p101
aVWe virtualized our operating system environments,
p102
aVand we completed numerous automation projects.
p103
aVNow these initiatives create a more mobile workplace,
p104
aVand they reduce our real estate footprint,
p105
aVand they yield savings of 23 million dollars
p106
aVin operating costs annually,
p107
aVand avoid the emissions
p108
aVof a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.
p109
aVThat's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars
p110
aVoff the road.
p111
aVSo awesome, right?
p112
aVAnother example is Pentair.
p113
aVPentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,
p114
aVand about a decade ago,
p115
aVthey sold their core power tools business
p116
aVand reinvested those proceeds in a water business.
p117
aVThat's a really big bet. Why did they do that?
p118
aVWell, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans,
p119
aVthere's more growth in water than in power tools,
p120
aVand this company has their sights set
p121
aVon what they call "the new New World."
p122
aVThat's four billion middle class people
p123
aVdemanding food, energy and water.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, you may be asking yourself,
p126
aVare these just isolated cases?
p127
aVI mean, come on, really?
p128
aVDo companies that take sustainability into account
p129
aVreally do well financially?
p130
aVThe answer that may surprise you is yes.
p131
aVThe data shows that stocks with better ESG performance
p132
aVperform just as well as others.
p133
aVIn blue, we see the MSCI World.
p134
aVIt's an index of large companies
p135
aVfrom developed markets across the world.
p136
aVAnd in gold, we see a subset of companies
p137
aVrated as having the best ESG performance.
p138
aVOver three plus years, no performance tradeoff.
p139
aVSo that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.
p140
aVIn some cases, there may be outperformance
p141
aVfrom ESG.
p142
aVIn blue, we see the performance
p143
aVof the 500 largest global companies,
p144
aVand in gold, we see a subset of companies
p145
aVwith best practice in climate change strategy
p146
aVand risk management.
p147
aVNow over almost eight years,
p148
aVthey've outperformed by about two thirds.
p149
aVSo yes, this is correlation. It's not causation.
p150
aVBut it does illustrate that environmental leadership
p151
aVis compatible with good returns.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo if the returns are the same or better
p154
aVand the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm?
p155
aVAre investors, particularly institutional investors,
p156
aVengaged?
p157
aVWell, some are,
p158
aVand a few are really at the vanguard.
p159
aVHesta.
p160
aVHesta is a retirement fund for health
p161
aVand community services employees in Australia,
p162
aVwith assets of 22 billion [dollars].
p163
aVThey believe that ESG has the potential
p164
aVto impact risks and returns,
p165
aVso incorporating it into the investment process
p166
aVis core to their duty
p167
aVto act in the best interest of fund members,
p168
aVcore to their duty.
p169
aVYou gotta love the Aussies, right?
p170
aVCalPERS is another example.
p171
aVCalPERS is the pension fund
p172
aVfor public employees in California,
p173
aVand with assets of 244 billion [dollars],
p174
aVthey are the second largest in the U.S.
p175
aVand the sixth largest in the world.
p176
aVNow, they're moving toward 100 percent
p177
aVsustainable investment
p178
aVby systematically integrated ESG
p179
aVacross the entire fund.
p180
aVWhy? They believe it's critical
p181
aVto superior long-term returns, full stop.
p182
aVIn their own words, "long-term value creation
p183
aVrequires the effective management
p184
aVof three forms of capital:
p185
aVfinancial, human, and physical.
p186
aVThis is why we are concerned with ESG."
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, I do speak to a lot of investors
p189
aVas part of my job,
p190
aVand not all of them see it this way.
p191
aVOften I hear, "We are required to maximize returns,
p192
aVso we don't do that here,"
p193
aVor, "We don't want to use the portfolio
p194
aVto make policy statements."
p195
aVThe one that just really gets under my skin is,
p196
aV"If you want to do something about that,
p197
aVjust make money, give the profits to charities."
p198
aVIt's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.
p199
aa(lp200
VI mean, let me clarify something right here.
p201
aVCompanies and investors are not
p202
aVsingularly responsible for the fate of the planet.
p203
aVThey don't have indefinite social obligations,
p204
aVand prudent investing and finance theory
p205
aVaren't subordinate to sustainability.
p206
aVThey're compatible.
p207
aVSo I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.
p208
aVBut institutional investors
p209
aVare the x-factor in sustainability.
p210
aVWhy do they hold the key?
p211
aVThe answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.
p212
aV(Laughter)
p213
aVA lot of it.
p214
aVI mean, a really lot of it.
p215
aVThe global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.
p216
aVThe global bond market, 78 trillion.
p217
aVThat's 133 trillion combined.
p218
aVThat's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.
p219
aVThat's the world's largest economy.
p220
aVThat's some serious freaking firepower.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo we can reconsider
p223
aVsome of these pressing challenges,
p224
aVlike fresh water, clean air,
p225
aVfeeding 10 billion mouths,
p226
aVif institutional investors
p227
aVintegrated ESG into investment.
p228
aVWhat if they used that firepower
p229
aVto allocate more of their capital
p230
aVto companies working the hardest
p231
aVat solving these challenges
p232
aVor at least not exacerbating them?
p233
aVWhat if we work and save and invest,
p234
aVonly to find that the world we retire into
p235
aVis more stressed and less secure than it is now?
p236
aVWhat if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?
p237
aa(lp238
VNow a fair question might be,
p239
aVwhat if all this sustainability risk stuff
p240
aVis exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,
p241
aVsomething for virtuous consumers
p242
aVor lifestyle choice?
p243
aVWell, President John F. Kennedy said something
p244
aVabout this that is just spot on:
p245
aV"There are risks and costs to a program of action,
p246
aVbut they are far less than the long-range risks
p247
aVand costs of comfortable inaction."
p248
aVI can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,
p249
aVbut since this is based on widespread scientific consensus,
p250
aVthe odds that it's not completely wrong
p251
aVare better than the odds
p252
aVthat our house will burn down
p253
aVor we'll get in a car accident.
p254
aVWell, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter)
p255
aVBut my point is that we buy insurance
p256
aVto protect ourselves financially
p257
aVin case those things happen, right?
p258
aVSo by investing sustainably
p259
aVwe're doing two things.
p260
aVWe're creating insurance,
p261
aVreducing the risk to our planet and to our economy,
p262
aVand at the same time, in the short term,
p263
aVwe're not sacrificing performance.
p264
aV[Man in comic: "What if it's a big hoax  and we create a better world for nothing?"]
p265
aa(lp266
VGood, you like it. I like it too.
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aVI like it because it pokes fun
p269
aVat both sides of the climate change issue.
p270
aVI bet you can't guess which side I'm on.
p271
aVBut what I really like about it
p272
aVis that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,
p273
aVwhich is, "Plan for the future,
p274
aVbecause that's where you're going to spend
p275
aVthe rest of your life."
p276
aa(lp277
VThank you.
p278

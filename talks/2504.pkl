VBy raising your hand,
p5
aVhow many of you know at least one person on the screen?
p6
aVWow, it's almost a full house.
p7
aVIt's true, they are very famous in their fields.
p8
aVAnd do you know what all of them have in common?
p9
aVThey all died of pancreatic cancer.
p10
aVHowever, although it's very, very sad this news,
p11
aVit's also thanks to their personal stories
p12
aVthat we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be.
p13
aa(lp14
VIt's become the third cause of cancer deaths,
p15
aVand only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years.
p16
aVThat's a very tiny number,
p17
aVespecially if you compare it with breast cancer,
p18
aVwhere the survival rate is almost 90 percent.
p19
aVSo it doesn't really come as a surprise
p20
aVthat being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer
p21
aVmeans facing an almost certain death sentence.
p22
aVWhat's shocking, though, is that in the last 40 years,
p23
aVthis number hasn't changed a bit,
p24
aVwhile much more progress has been made
p25
aVwith other types of tumors.
p26
aVSo how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective?
p27
aVAs a biomedical entrepreneur,
p28
aVI like to work on problems that seem impossible,
p29
aVunderstanding their limitations
p30
aVand trying to find new, innovative solutions
p31
aVthat can change their outcome.
p32
aa(lp33
VThe first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer
p34
aVis that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly, literally.
p35
aVIt's depicted in orange on the screen.
p36
aVBut you can barely see it
p37
aVuntil I remove all the other organs in front.
p38
aVIt's also surrounded by many other vital organs,
p39
aVlike the liver, the stomach, the bile duct.
p40
aVAnd the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs
p41
aVis the reason why pancreatic cancer
p42
aVis one of the most painful tumor types.
p43
aVThe hard-to-reach location also prevents the doctor
p44
aVfrom surgically removing it,
p45
aVas is routinely done for breast cancer, for example.
p46
aVSo all of these reasons leave chemotherapy as the only option
p47
aVfor the pancreatic cancer patient.
p48
aa(lp49
VThis brings us to the second piece of bad news.
p50
aVPancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels.
p51
aVWhy should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor?
p52
aVLet's think for a second how chemotherapy works.
p53
aVThe drug is injected in the vein
p54
aVand it navigates throughout the body until it reaches the tumor site.
p55
aVIt's like driving on a highway, trying to reach a destination.
p56
aVBut what if your destination doesn't have an exit on the highway?
p57
aVYou will never get there.
p58
aVAnd that's exactly the same problem
p59
aVfor chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.
p60
aVThe drugs navigate throughout all of your body.
p61
aVThey will reach healthy organs,
p62
aVresulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall,
p63
aVbut very little will go to the tumor.
p64
aVTherefore, the efficacy is very limited.
p65
aa(lp66
VTo me, it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole-body treatment
p67
aVto target a specific organ.
p68
aVHowever, in the last 40 years,
p69
aVa lot of money, research and effort have gone towards
p70
aVfinding new, powerful drugs to treat pancreatic cancer,
p71
aVbut nothing has been done in changing the way
p72
aVwe deliver them to the patient.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo after two pieces of bad news,
p75
aVI'm going to give you good news, hopefully.
p76
aVWith a collaborator at MIT
p77
aVand the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston,
p78
aVwe have revolutionized the way we treat cancer
p79
aVby making localized drug delivery a reality.
p80
aVWe are basically parachuting you on top of your destination,
p81
aVavoiding your having to drive all around the highway.
p82
aVWe have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one.
p83
aVThey are flexible enough that they can be folded
p84
aVto fit into the catheter,
p85
aVso the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor
p86
aVwith minimally invasive surgery.
p87
aVBut they are solid enough that once they are positioned
p88
aVon top of the tumor,
p89
aVthey will act as a cage.
p90
aVThey will actually physically prevent the tumor
p91
aVfrom entering other organs,
p92
aVcontrolling the metastasis.
p93
aa(lp94
VThe devices are also biodegradable.
p95
aVThat means that once in the body,
p96
aVthey start dissolving,
p97
aVdelivering the drug only locally, slowly and more effectively
p98
aVthan what is done with the current whole-body treatment.
p99
aVIn pre-clinical study, we have demonstrated
p100
aVthat this localized approach
p101
aVis able to improve by 12 times the response to treatment.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo we took a drug that is already known
p104
aVand by just delivering it locally where it's needed the most,
p105
aVwe allow a response that is 12 times more powerful,
p106
aVreducing the systemic toxic effect.
p107
aVWe are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level.
p108
aVWe are finalizing the pre-clinical testing
p109
aVand the animal model required prior to asking the FDA for approval
p110
aVfor clinical trials.
p111
aa(lp112
VCurrently, the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer.
p113
aVWe are hoping that one day,
p114
aVwe can reduce their pain, extend their life
p115
aVand potentially make pancreatic cancer
p116
aVa curable disease.
p117
aa(lp118
VBy rethinking the way we deliver the drug,
p119
aVwe don't only make it more powerful and less toxic,
p120
aVwe are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions
p121
aVfor almost all other impossible problems
p122
aVin pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.
p123
aa(lp124
VThank you very much.

She was selected as a TED Fellow in 2016.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Indolfi has broad professional experiences and interests ranging from biomedical engineering to entrepreneurship and outreaching initiative to promoting science. Her scientific expertise covers a broad range of therapeutic areas (cardio, cancer, inflammation, regenerative medicine) and approaches (drug delivery, cell therapy, implanted devices). Together with her strong technical background, Laura has hands-on business and managerial know-how developed during her biomedical business training at Sloan and Harvard Business Schools and with several consulting firms. She strongly believes in the power of outreach initiatives to promote research awareness and foster the public audience&#39;s discovery of the beauty of science. In 2014 the line of clothes Cytocouture, created in collaboration with Colombian designer Carlos Villamil and inspired by her cell-therapy research, won the global competition Descience.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Indolfi holds a MS/BS degree in materials science and engineering and a PhD in biomaterials from the University of Naples Federico II in Italy.

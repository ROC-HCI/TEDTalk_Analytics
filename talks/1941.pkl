VThe year is 1800.
p5
aVA curious little invention is being talked about.
p6
aVIt's called a microscope.
p7
aVWhat it allows you to do
p8
aVis see tiny little lifeforms
p9
aVthat are invisible to the naked eye.
p10
aVSoon comes the medical discovery
p11
aVthat many of these lifeforms are actually causes
p12
aVof terrible human diseases.
p13
aVImagine what happened to the society
p14
aVwhen they realized
p15
aVthat an English mom in her teacup
p16
aVactually was drinking a monster soup,
p17
aVnot very far from here. This is from London.
p18
aa(lp19
VFast forward 200 years.
p20
aVWe still have this monster soup around,
p21
aVand it's taken hold in the developing countries
p22
aVaround the tropical belt.
p23
aVJust for malaria itself,
p24
aVthere are a million deaths a year,
p25
aVand more than a billion people
p26
aVthat need to be tested because they are at risk
p27
aVfor different species of malarial infections.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow it's actually very simple to put a face
p30
aVto many of these monsters.
p31
aVYou take a stain, like acridine orange
p32
aVor a fluorescent stain or Giemsa,
p33
aVand a microscope, and you look at them.
p34
aVThey all have faces.
p35
aVWhy is that so, that Alex in Kenya,
p36
aVFatima in Bangladesh, Navjoot in Mumbai,
p37
aVand Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months
p38
aVto be able to diagnose why they are sick?
p39
aVAnd that's primarily because scalability
p40
aVof the diagnostics is completely out of reach.
p41
aVAnd remember that number: one billion.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe problem lies with the microscope itself.
p44
aVEven though the pinnacle of modern science,
p45
aVresearch microscopes are not designed for field testing.
p46
aVNeither were they first designed
p47
aVfor diagnostics at all.
p48
aVThey are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain,
p49
aVand cost a lot of money.
p50
aVThis picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s
p51
aVusing the exact same setup that we actually use today
p52
aVfor diagnosing T.B. in his ashram
p53
aVin Sevagram in India.
p54
aa(lp55
VTwo of my students, Jim and James,
p56
aVtraveled around India and Thailand,
p57
aVstarting to think about this problem a lot.
p58
aVWe saw all kinds of donated equipment.
p59
aVWe saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.
p60
aVAnd we saw people who had a functional microscope
p61
aVbut just didn't know how to even turn it on.
p62
aVWhat grew out of that work and that trip
p63
aVwas actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo what is a Foldscope?
p66
aVA Foldscope is a completely functional microscope,
p67
aVa platform for fluorescence, bright-field,
p68
aVpolarization, projection,
p69
aVall kinds of advanced microscopy
p70
aVbuilt purely by folding paper.
p71
aVSo, now you think, how is that possible?
p72
aVI'm going to show you some examples here,
p73
aVand we will run through some of them.
p74
aVIt starts with a single sheet of paper.
p75
aVWhat you see here is all the possible components
p76
aVto build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope.
p77
aVSo, there are three stages:
p78
aVThere is the optical stage, the illumination stage
p79
aVand the mask-holding stage.
p80
aVAnd there are micro optics at the bottom
p81
aVthat's actually embedded in the paper itself.
p82
aVWhat you do is, you take it on,
p83
aVand just like you are playing like a toy,
p84
aVwhich it is,
p85
aVI tab it off,
p86
aVand I break it off.
p87
aa(lp88
VThis paper has no instructions and no languages.
p89
aVThere is a code, a color code embedded,
p90
aVthat tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope.
p91
aVWhen it's done, it looks something like this,
p92
aVhas all the functionalities of a standard microscope,
p93
aVjust like an XY stage,
p94
aVa place where a sample slide could go,
p95
aVfor example right here.
p96
aVWe didn't want to change this,
p97
aVbecause this is the standard
p98
aVthat's been optimized for over the years,
p99
aVand many health workers are actually used to this.
p100
aVSo this is what changes,
p101
aVbut the standard stains all remain the same
p102
aVfor many different diseases.
p103
aVYou pop this in.
p104
aVThere is an XY stage,
p105
aVand then there is a focusing stage,
p106
aVwhich is a flexure mechanism
p107
aVthat's built in paper itself that allows us to move
p108
aVand focus the lenses by micron steps.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo what's really interesting about this object,
p111
aVand my students hate when I do this,
p112
aVbut I'm going to do this anyway,
p113
aVis these are rugged devices.
p114
aVI can turn it on and throw it on the floor
p115
aVand really try to stomp on it.
p116
aVAnd they last, even though they're designed
p117
aVfrom a very flexible material, like paper.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnother fun fact is, this is what we actually
p120
aVsend out there as a standard diagnostic tool,
p121
aVbut here in this envelope
p122
aVI have 30 different foldscopes
p123
aVof different configurations all in a single folder.
p124
aVAnd I'm going to pick one randomly.
p125
aVThis one, it turns out, is actually designed
p126
aVspecifically for malaria,
p127
aVbecause it has the fluorescent filters built
p128
aVspecifically for diagnosing malaria.
p129
aVSo the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes
p130
aVcomes out of this.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo up till now, you didn't actually see
p133
aVwhat I would see from one of these setups.
p134
aVSo what I would like to do is,
p135
aVif we could dim the lights, please,
p136
aVit turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes.
p137
aVI have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn \u2014
p138
aVgo to the back of the wall \u2014
p139
aVand just project, and this way you will see
p140
aVexactly what I would see.
p141
aVWhat you're looking at \u2014
p142
aV(Applause) \u2014
p143
aVThis is a cross-section of a compound eye,
p144
aVand when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there,
p145
aVI am going through the z-axis.
p146
aVYou actually see how the lenses are cut together
p147
aVin the cross-section pattern.
p148
aVAnother example, one of my favorite insects,
p149
aVI love to hate this one,
p150
aVis a mosquito,
p151
aVand you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.
p152
aVRight there.
p153
aVAll from the simple setup that I actually described.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo my wife has been field testing
p156
aVsome of our microscopes
p157
aVby washing my clothes whenever I forget them
p158
aVin the dryer.
p159
aVSo it turns out they're waterproof, and \u2014
p160
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p161
aVright here is just fluorescent water,
p162
aVand I don't know if you can actually see this.
p163
aVThis also shows you how  the projection scope works.
p164
aVYou get to see the beam the  way it's projected and bent.
p165
aa(lp166
VCan we get the lights back on again?
p167
aa(lp168
VSo I'm quickly going to show you,
p169
aVsince I'm running out of time,
p170
aVin terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture,
p171
aVthe biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing,
p172
aVso we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.
p173
aV(Applause)
p174
aVAnd what this allows us to do
p175
aVis to think about a new paradigm in microscopy,
p176
aVwhich we call use-and-throw microscopy.
p177
aVI'm going to give you a quick snapshot
p178
aVof some of the parts that go in.
p179
aVHere is a sheet of paper.
p180
aVThis is when we were thinking about the idea.
p181
aVThis is an A4 sheet of paper.
p182
aVThese are the three stages that you actually see.
p183
aVAnd the optical components, if you look at the inset up on the right,
p184
aVwe had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses
p185
aVin paper itself at really high throughputs,
p186
aVso it uses a process of self-assembly
p187
aVand surface tension
p188
aVto build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.
p189
aVSo that's where the lenses go.
p190
aVThere are some light sources.
p191
aVAnd essentially, in the end,
p192
aVall the parts line up because of origami,
p193
aVbecause of the fact that origami allows us
p194
aVmicron-scale precision of optical alignment.
p195
aVSo even though this looks like a simple toy,
p196
aVthe aspects of engineering that go in
p197
aVsomething like this are fairly sophisticated.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo here is another obvious thing that we would do,
p200
aVtypically, if I was going to show
p201
aVthat these microscopes are robust,
p202
aVis go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself.
p203
aVThere it is, and it survives.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo for us, the next step actually
p206
aVis really finishing our field trials.
p207
aVWe are starting at the end of the summer.
p208
aVWe are at a stage where we'll be  making thousands of microscopes.
p209
aVThat would be the first time where we would be
p210
aVdoing field trials with the highest density
p211
aVof microscopes ever at a given place.
p212
aVWe've started collecting data for malaria,
p213
aVChagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd I want to leave you with this picture.
p216
aVI had not anticipated this before,
p217
aVbut a really interesting link
p218
aVbetween hands-on science education
p219
aVand global health.
p220
aVWhat are the tools that we're actually providing
p221
aVthe kids who are going to fight
p222
aVthis monster soup for tomorrow?
p223
aVI would love for them to be able to just print out
p224
aVa Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets.
p225
aa(lp226
VThank you.

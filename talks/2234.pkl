VThis is a story about capitalism.
p5
aVIt's a system I love
p6
aVbecause of the successes and opportunities it's afforded me and millions of others.
p7
aa(lp8
VI started in my 20s trading commodities, cotton in particular, in the pits,
p9
aVand if there was ever a free market free-for-all, this was it,
p10
aVwhere men wearing ties  but acting like gladiators
p11
aVfought literally  and physically for a profit.
p12
aa(lp13
VFortunately, I was good enough that by the time I was 30,
p14
aVI was able to move into the upstairs  world of money management,
p15
aVwhere I spent the next three decades as a global macro trader.
p16
aVAnd over that time, I've seen a lot of crazy things in the markets,
p17
aVand I've traded a lot of crazy manias.
p18
aVAnd unfortunately,
p19
aVI'm sad to report that right now  we might be in the grips
p20
aVof one of the most disastrous, certainly of my career,
p21
aVand one consistent takeaway is manias never end well.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, over the past 50 years,
p24
aVwe as a society have come to view our companies and corporations
p25
aVin a very narrow, almost monomaniacal fashion
p26
aVwith regard to how we value them,
p27
aVand we have put so much emphasis on profits,
p28
aVon short-term quarterly earnings and share prices,
p29
aVat the exclusion of all else.
p30
aVIt's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies.
p31
aVNow, we don't do that \u2014 conveniently reduce something
p32
aVto a set of numbers that you can play with like Lego toys \u2014
p33
aVwe don't do that in our individual life.
p34
aVWe don't treat somebody or value them
p35
aVbased on their monthly income  or their credit score,
p36
aVbut we have this double standard
p37
aVwhen it comes to the way that we value our businesses,
p38
aVand you know what?
p39
aVIt's threatening the very underpinnings of our society.
p40
aVAnd here's how you'll see.
p41
aa(lp42
VThis chart is corporate profit margins going back 40 years
p43
aVas a percentage of revenues,
p44
aVand you can see that we're at a 40-year high of 12.5 percent.
p45
aVNow, hooray if you're a shareholder,
p46
aVbut if you're the other side of that, and you're the average American worker,
p47
aVthen you can see it's not such a good thing.
p48
aV["U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio"]
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth.
p51
aVWhat they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality,
p52
aVand that's not a good thing.
p53
aVBut intuitively, that makes sense, right?
p54
aVBecause if the top 10 percent of American families
p55
aVown 90 percent of the stocks,
p56
aVas they take a greater share of corporate profits,
p57
aVthen there's less wealth left for the rest of society.
p58
aa(lp59
VAgain, income inequality is not a good thing.
p60
aVThis next chart, made by The Equality Trust,
p61
aVshows 21 countries from Austria to Japan to New Zealand.
p62
aVOn the horizontal axis is income inequality.
p63
aVThe further to the right you go, the greater the income inequality.
p64
aVOn the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics.
p65
aVThe more you go up that, the worse the problems are,
p66
aVand those metrics include life expectancy, teenage pregnancy, literacy,
p67
aVsocial mobility, just to name a few.
p68
aVNow, those of you in the audience who are Americans may wonder,
p69
aVwell, where does the United States rank?
p70
aVWhere does it lie on that chart?
p71
aVAnd guess what?
p72
aVWe're literally off the chart.
p73
aVYes, that's us,
p74
aVwith the greatest income inequality
p75
aVand the greatest social problems, according to those metrics.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, here's a macro forecast that's easy to make,
p78
aVand that's, that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest,
p79
aVit will get closed.
p80
aVHistory always does it.
p81
aVIt typically happens in one of three ways:
p82
aVeither through revolution, higher taxes, or wars.
p83
aVNone of those are on my bucket list.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, there's another way to do it,
p87
aVand that's by increasing justness in corporate behavior,
p88
aVbut the way that we're operating right now,
p89
aVthat would require a tremendous change in behavior,
p90
aVand like an addict trying to kick a habit,
p91
aVthe first step is to acknowledge that you have a problem.
p92
aVAnd let me just say, this profits mania that we're on
p93
aVis so deeply entrenched
p94
aVthat we don't even realize how we're harming society.
p95
aVHere's a small but startling example of exactly how we're doing that:
p96
aVthis chart shows corporate giving
p97
aVas a percentage of profits,  not revenues, over the last 30 years.
p98
aVJuxtapose that to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins,
p99
aVand I ask you, does that feel right?
p100
aa(lp101
VIn all fairness, when I started writing this, I thought,
p102
aV"Oh wow, what does my company, what does Tudor do?"
p103
aVAnd I realized we give one percent of corporate profits
p104
aVto charity every year.
p105
aVAnd I'm supposed to be a philanthropist.
p106
aVWhen I realized that, I literally wanted to throw up.
p107
aVBut the point is, this mania is so deeply entrenched
p108
aVthat well-intentioned people like myself don't even realize that we're part of it.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, we're not going to change corporate behavior
p111
aVby simply increasing corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions.
p112
aVAnd oh, by the way, we've since quadrupled that,
p113
aVbut \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 Please.
p114
aVBut we can do it by driving more just behavior.
p115
aVAnd one way to do it is actually trusting
p116
aVthe system that got us here in the first place,
p117
aVand that's the free market system.
p118
aVAbout a year ago, some friends of mine and I
p119
aVstarted a not-for-profit called Just Capital.
p120
aVIts mission is very simple:
p121
aVto help companies and corporations
p122
aVlearn how to operate in a more just fashion by using the public's input
p123
aVto define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior.
p124
aVNow, right now, there's no widely accepted standard
p125
aVthat a company or corporation can follow, and that's where Just Capital comes in,
p126
aVbecause beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey
p127
aVof a representative sample of 20,000 Americans
p128
aVto find out exactly what they think
p129
aVare the criteria for justness in corporate behavior.
p130
aVNow, this is a model that's going to start in the United States
p131
aVbut can be expanded anywhere around the globe,
p132
aVand maybe we'll find out
p133
aVthat the most important thing for the public
p134
aVis that we create living wage jobs, or make healthy products,
p135
aVor help, not harm, the environment.
p136
aVAt Just Capital, we don't know, and it's not for us to decide.
p137
aVWe're but messengers,
p138
aVbut we have 100 percent confidence  and faith in the American public
p139
aVto get it right.
p140
aVSo we'll release the findings this September for the first time,
p141
aVand then next year, we'll poll again,
p142
aVand we'll take the additive step this time
p143
aVof ranking the 1,000 largest U.S. companies
p144
aVfrom number one to number 1,000 and everything in between.
p145
aVWe're calling it the Just Index,
p146
aVand remember, we're an independent not-for-profit with no bias,
p147
aVand we will be giving the American public a voice.
p148
aVAnd maybe over time, we'll find out that as people come to know
p149
aVwhich companies are the most just,
p150
aVhuman and economic resources will be driven towards them,
p151
aVand they'll become the most prosperous
p152
aVand help our country be the most prosperous.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation
p155
aVthat's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in.
p156
aVCapitalism has to be based on justice.
p157
aVIt has to be, and now more than ever,
p158
aVwith economic divisions growing wider every day.
p159
aVIt's estimated that 47 percent of American workers
p160
aVcan be displaced in the next 20 years.
p161
aVI'm not against progress.
p162
aVI want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else.
p163
aVBut I'm pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits
p164
aVhas to come greater corporate social responsibility.
p165
aa(lp166
V"If justice is removed," said Adam Smith, the father of capitalism,
p167
aV"the great, the immense fabric of human society must in a moment
p168
aVcrumble into atoms."
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, when I was young, and there was a problem,
p171
aVmy mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say,
p172
aV"Have mercy, have mercy."
p173
aVNow's not the time for us, for the rest of us to show them mercy.
p174
aVThe time is now for us to show them fairness,
p175
aVand we can do that, you and I,
p176
aVby starting where we work, in the businesses that we operate in.
p177
aVAnd when we put justness on par with profits,
p178
aVwe'll get the most wonderful thing in all the world.
p179
aVWe'll take back our humanity.
p180
aa(lp181
VThank you.

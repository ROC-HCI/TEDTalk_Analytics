VThere's so many of you.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VWhen I was a kid,
p9
aVI hid my heart under the bed, because my mother said,
p10
aV"If you're not careful, someday someone's going to break it."
p11
aVTake it from me: Under the bed is not a good hiding spot.
p12
aVI know because I've been shot down so many times,
p13
aVI get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself.
p14
aVBut that's what we were told.
p15
aV"Stand up for yourself."
p16
aVAnd that's hard to do if you don't know who you are.
p17
aVWe were expected to define ourselves at such an early age,
p18
aVand if we didn't do it, others did it for us.
p19
aVGeek. Fatty.
p20
aVSlut. Fag.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd at the same time we were being told what we were,
p23
aVwe were being asked,
p24
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p25
aVI always thought that was an unfair question.
p26
aVIt presupposes that we can't be what we already are.
p27
aVWe were kids.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhen I was a kid, I wanted to be a man.
p30
aVI wanted a registered retirement savings plan
p31
aVthat would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VWhen I was a kid, I wanted to shave.
p36
aVNow, not so much.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VWhen I was eight, I wanted to be a marine biologist.
p41
aVWhen I was nine, I saw the movie "Jaws,"
p42
aVand thought to myself, "No, thank you."
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd when I was 10,
p47
aVI was told that my parents left because they didn't want me.
p48
aVWhen I was 11, I wanted to be left alone.
p49
aVWhen I was 12, I wanted to die. When I was 13, I wanted to kill a kid.
p50
aVWhen I was 14, I was asked to seriously consider a career path.
p51
aa(lp52
VI said, "I'd like to be a writer."
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd they said, "Choose something realistic."
p55
aa(lp56
VSo I said, "Professional wrestler."
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd they said, "Don't be stupid."
p59
aa(lp60
VSee, they asked me what I wanted to be,
p61
aVthen told me what not to be.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd I wasn't the only one.
p64
aVWe were being told that we somehow must become
p65
aVwhat we are not, sacrificing what we are
p66
aVto inherit the masquerade of what we will be.
p67
aVI was being told to accept the identity that others will give me.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd I wondered, what made my dreams so easy to dismiss?
p70
aVGranted, my dreams are shy,
p71
aVbecause they're Canadian.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VMy dreams are self-conscious and overly apologetic.
p76
aVThey're standing alone at the high school dance,
p77
aVand they've never been kissed.
p78
aVSee, my dreams got called names too.
p79
aVSilly. Foolish.
p80
aVImpossible.
p81
aVBut I kept dreaming.
p82
aVI was going to be a wrestler. I had it all figured out.
p83
aVI was going to be The Garbage Man.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VMy finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor.
p88
aVMy saying was going to be, "I'm taking out the trash!"
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
V(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd then this guy, Duke "The Dumpster" Droese,
p95
aVstole my entire shtick.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VI was crushed,
p100
aVas if by a trash compactor.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VI thought to myself, "What now? Where do I turn?"
p105
aa(lp106
VPoetry.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VLike a boomerang, the thing I loved came back to me.
p111
aVOne of the first lines of poetry I can remember writing
p112
aVwas in response to a world that demanded I hate myself.
p113
aVFrom age 15 to 18, I hated myself
p114
aVfor becoming the thing that I loathed:
p115
aVa bully.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhen I was 19, I wrote,
p118
aV"I will love myself despite the ease with which
p119
aVI lean toward the opposite."
p120
aa(lp121
VStanding up for yourself doesn't have to mean
p122
aVembracing violence.
p123
aa(lp124
VWhen I was a kid,
p125
aVI traded in homework assignments for friendship,
p126
aVthen gave each friend a late slip for never showing up on time,
p127
aVand in most cases, not at all.
p128
aVI gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise.
p129
aVAnd I remember this plan, born out of frustration
p130
aVfrom a kid who kept calling me "Yogi,"
p131
aVthen pointed at my tummy and said, "Too many picnic baskets."
p132
aVTurns out it's not that hard to trick someone,
p133
aVand one day before class, I said,
p134
aV"Yeah, you can copy my homework,"
p135
aVand I gave him all the wrong answers that I'd written down the night before.
p136
aVHe got his paper back expecting a near-perfect score,
p137
aVand couldn't believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero.
p138
aVI knew I didn't have to hold up my paper of 28 out of 30,
p139
aVbut my satisfaction was complete when he looked at me, puzzled,
p140
aVand I thought to myself, "Smarter than the average bear, motherfucker."
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
V(Applause)
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is who I am.
p147
aVThis is how I stand up for myself.
p148
aa(lp149
VWhen I was a kid,
p150
aVI used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing.
p151
aVI thought they were both pork chops.
p152
aVMy grandmother thought it was cute,
p153
aVand because they were my favorite, she let me keep doing it.
p154
aVNot really a big deal.
p155
aVOne day, before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees,
p156
aVI fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body.
p157
aVI didn't want to tell my grandmother
p158
aVbecause I was scared I'd get in trouble
p159
aVfor playing somewhere I shouldn't have been.
p160
aVThe gym teacher noticed the bruise, and I got sent to the principal's office.
p161
aVFrom there, I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady
p162
aVwho asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home.
p163
aVI saw no reason to lie.
p164
aVAs far as I was concerned, life was pretty good.
p165
aVI told her, whenever I'm sad, my grandmother gives me karate chops.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VThis led to a full-scale investigation,
p170
aVand I was removed from the house for three days,
p171
aVuntil they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises.
p172
aVNews of this silly little story quickly spread through the school,
p173
aVand I earned my first nickname:
p174
aVPorkchop.
p175
aVTo this day,
p176
aVI hate pork chops.
p177
aa(lp178
VI'm not the only kid who grew up this way,
p179
aVsurrounded by people who used to say that rhyme
p180
aVabout sticks and stones,
p181
aVas if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called,
p182
aVand we got called them all.
p183
aVSo we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us,
p184
aVthat we'd be lonely forever,
p185
aVthat we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun
p186
aVwas something they built for us in their toolshed.
p187
aVSo broken heartstrings bled the blues,
p188
aVand we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing.
p189
aVDon't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone,
p190
aVthat an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away,
p191
aVthat there's no way for it to metastasize; it does.
p192
aa(lp193
VShe was eight years old,
p194
aVour first day of grade three when she got called ugly.
p195
aVWe both got moved to the back of class
p196
aVso we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs.
p197
aVBut the school halls were a battleground.
p198
aVWe found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day.
p199
aVWe used to stay inside for recess, because outside was worse.
p200
aVOutside, we'd have to rehearse running away,
p201
aVor learn to stay still like statues, giving no clues that we were there.
p202
aVIn grade five, they taped a sign to the front of her desk
p203
aVthat read, "Beware of dog."
p204
aa(lp205
VTo this day,
p206
aVdespite a loving husband, she doesn't think she's beautiful,
p207
aVbecause of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half her face.
p208
aVKids used to say, "She looks like a wrong answer
p209
aVthat someone tried to erase, but couldn't quite get the job done."
p210
aVAnd they'll never understand that she's raising two kids
p211
aVwhose definition of beauty begins with the word "Mom,"
p212
aVbecause they see her heart before they see her skin,
p213
aVbecause she's only ever always been amazing.
p214
aa(lp215
VHe was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree,
p216
aVadopted,
p217
aVnot because his parents opted for a different destiny.
p218
aVHe was three when he became a mixed drink
p219
aVof one part left alone and two parts tragedy,
p220
aVstarted therapy in eighth grade,
p221
aVhad a personality made up of tests and pills,
p222
aVlived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs,
p223
aVfour-fifths suicidal, a tidal wave of antidepressants,
p224
aVand an adolescent being called "Popper,"
p225
aVone part because of the pills,
p226
aV99 parts because of the cruelty.
p227
aVHe tried to kill himself in grade 10
p228
aVwhen a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad
p229
aVhad the audacity to tell him, "Get over it."
p230
aVAs if depression is something that could be remedied
p231
aVby any of the contents found in a first-aid kit.
p232
aa(lp233
VTo this day, he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends,
p234
aVcould describe to you in detail the way the sky bends
p235
aVin the moment before it's about to fall,
p236
aVand despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration,
p237
aVhe remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand
p238
aVsometimes being drug-free has less to do with addiction
p239
aVand more to do with sanity.
p240
aa(lp241
VWe weren't the only kids who grew up this way.
p242
aVTo this day, kids are still being called names.
p243
aVThe classics were "Hey, stupid," "Hey, spaz."
p244
aVSeems like every school has an arsenal of names
p245
aVgetting updated every year.
p246
aVAnd if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear,
p247
aVdo they make a sound?
p248
aVAre they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck on repeat,
p249
aVwhen people say things like, "Kids can be cruel."
p250
aVEvery school was a big top circus tent,
p251
aVand the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers,
p252
aVfrom clowns to carnies, all of these miles ahead of who we were.
p253
aVWe were freaks \u2014
p254
aVlobster-claw boys and bearded ladies,
p255
aVoddities juggling depression and loneliness,
p256
aVplaying solitaire, spin the bottle,
p257
aVtrying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal,
p258
aVbut at night, while the others slept,
p259
aVwe kept walking the tightrope.
p260
aVIt was practice, and yes, some of us fell.
p261
aa(lp262
VBut I want to tell them that all of this
p263
aVis just debris
p264
aVleft over when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be,
p265
aVand if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself,
p266
aVget a better mirror, look a little closer, stare a little longer,
p267
aVbecause there's something inside you that made you keep trying
p268
aVdespite everyone who told you to quit.
p269
aVYou built a cast around your broken heart
p270
aVand signed it yourself, "They were wrong."
p271
aVBecause maybe you didn't belong to a group or a clique.
p272
aVMaybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything.
p273
aVMaybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show-and-tell, but never told,
p274
aVbecause how can you hold your ground
p275
aVif everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it?
p276
aVYou have to believe that they were wrong.
p277
aVThey have to be wrong.
p278
aVWhy else would we still be here?
p279
aa(lp280
VWe grew up learning to cheer on the underdog
p281
aVbecause we see ourselves in them.
p282
aVWe stem from a root planted in the belief
p283
aVthat we are not what we were called.
p284
aVWe are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway,
p285
aVand if in some way we are, don't worry.
p286
aVWe only got out to walk and get gas.
p287
aVWe are graduating members from the class of We Made It,
p288
aVnot the faded echoes of voices crying out,
p289
aV"Names will never hurt me."
p290
aVOf course they did.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act
p293
aVthat has less to do with pain
p294
aVand more to do with beauty.

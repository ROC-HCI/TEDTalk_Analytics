VI'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps
p5
aVwe don't understand as much as we think we do.
p6
aVI'd like to begin with four questions.
p7
aVThis is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year.
p8
aVThat's an in-joke, by the way.
p9
aVBut these four questions, actually,
p10
aVare ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard.
p11
aVAnd they're questions that I've asked of science television producers,
p12
aVof audiences of science educators \u2014
p13
aVso that's science teachers \u2014 and also of seven-year-olds,
p14
aVand I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better
p15
aVthan the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo the first question, and you might want to write this down,
p18
aVeither on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper
p19
aVin your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.
p20
aVA little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?
p21
aVI think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,
p22
aVright? Where does all this stuff come from?
p23
aV(Knocks)
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb
p26
aVwith a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?
p27
aVAnd would you be able to, kind of, draw a \u2014 you don't have to draw
p28
aVthe diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,
p29
aVif you had to do it? Or would you just say,
p30
aVthat's actually not possible?
p31
aa(lp32
VThe third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?
p33
aVI think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,
p34
aVbut why? And finally, would you be able to \u2014
p35
aVand you can sort of scribble it, if you like \u2014
p36
aVscribble a plan diagram of the solar system,
p37
aVshowing the shape of the planets' orbits?
p38
aVWould you be able to do that?
p39
aVAnd if you can, just scribble a pattern.
p40
aa(lp41
VOK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers,
p42
aVas teachers often think, but actually from common sense,
p43
aVfrom experience of the world around them,
p44
aVfrom all the things that go on between them and their peers,
p45
aVand their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.
p46
aVAnd one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,
p47
aVCardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads
p48
aVbecause it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVI'm not quite sure how he died, actually.
p51
aVWas he beheaded in the end, or hung?
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVNow, those questions, which, of course, you've got right,
p54
aVand you haven't been conferring, and so on.
p55
aVAnd I \u2014 you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,
p56
aVbut maybe not in this instance.
p57
aa(lp58
VA little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff,
p59
aV99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.
p60
aVNow, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED,
p61
aVwill have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,
p62
aVprobably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,
p63
aVand say that actually, it comes out of the ground.
p64
aVNow, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country,
p65
aVfilling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business.
p66
aVBut, actually, we don't do that.
p67
aVThe mass of this comes out of the air.
p68
aVNow, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.
p69
aVI passed them really well, but I still came out of school
p70
aVthinking that that stuff came out of the ground.
p71
aa(lp72
VSecond one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire?
p73
aVYes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that.
p74
aVNow, I have some rather bad news,
p75
aVwhich is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,
p76
aVwhich unfortunately \u2014 the sound doesn't work in this room,
p77
aVso I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion,
p78
aVwhat happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers
p79
aVgo to MIT on graduation day.
p80
aVWe chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away
p81
aVfrom here, and you wouldn't mind too much,
p82
aVbut it sort of works the same way in Britain
p83
aVand in the West Coast of the USA.
p84
aVAnd we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions
p85
aVof science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.
p86
aVAnd so, there's a whole lot of people saying,
p87
aV"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.
p88
aVThat's very surprising to me." And those are science graduates.
p89
aVAnd we intercut it with, "We are the premier science university in the world,"
p90
aVbecause of British-like hubris.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVAnd when we gave graduate engineers that question,
p93
aVthey said it couldn't be done.
p94
aVAnd when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,
p95
aVand said, "Can you do it?" They couldn't do it. Right?
p96
aVAnd that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,
p97
aVit's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.
p98
aa(lp99
VAs if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money
p100
aVfor teaching people \u2014 we might as well get it right.
p101
aVAnd there are also some societal reasons
p102
aVwhy we might want people to understand what it is that's happening
p103
aVin photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation
p104
aVis how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,
p105
aVas I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew,
p106
aVis how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
p107
aVThat's what plants actually do for a living.
p108
aVAnd, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:
p109
aVwe are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice
p110
aVif we don't understand that kind of thing.
p111
aVNow, here's how you do the battery and the bulb.
p112
aVIt's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that.
p113
aVBut if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb,
p114
aVif you've only seen a circuit diagram,
p115
aVyou might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?
p118
aVWe learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot,
p119
aVand it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning,
p120
aVand it happens pretty early on.
p121
aVBy extension, we think to ourselves, "Why it's hotter in summer than in winter
p122
aVmust be because we're closer to the Sun."
p123
aVI promise you that most of you will have got that.
p124
aVOh, you're all shaking your heads,
p125
aVbut only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.
p126
aVOther ones are kind of going like this. All right.
p127
aVIt's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun
p128
aVare spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.
p129
aVAnd if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.
p130
aVThe Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right?
p131
aVIt makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,
p132
aVwe're further from the Sun in summer,
p133
aVas it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.
p134
aa(lp135
VOK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.
p136
aVIf you believe, as most of you probably do,
p137
aVthat it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun,
p138
aVyou must have drawn an ellipse.
p139
aVRight? That would explain it, right?
p140
aVExcept, in your \u2014 you're nodding \u2014 now, in your ellipse,
p141
aVhave you thought, "Well, what happens during the night?"
p142
aVBetween Australia and here, right, they've got summer
p143
aVand we've got winter, and what \u2014
p144
aVdoes the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,
p145
aVand then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on,
p146
aVand we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right,
p147
aVand we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.
p150
aVThat's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?
p151
aVAnd this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.
p152
aVI hope you notice the coincidence here.
p153
aVWhat would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,
p154
aVright, in their heads, of elliptical orbits
p155
aVcaused by our experiences as children?
p156
aVWhat sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,
p157
aVto show that it's not really like that?
p158
aVYou'd show them something like this, wouldn't you?
p159
aVIt's a plan, looking down from above.
p160
aVBut, no, look what I found in the textbooks.
p161
aVThat's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,
p162
aVfrom websites, educational websites \u2014
p163
aVand almost anything you pick up is like that.
p164
aVAnd the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring
p165
aVto have a load of concentric circles,
p166
aVwhereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,
p167
aVisn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,
p168
aVif you've got that misconception in your head, then that
p169
aVtwo-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.
p170
aVSo you've \u2014 it's crap, isn't it really? As we say.
p171
aVSo, these mental models \u2014 we look for evidence that reinforces our models.
p172
aVWe do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,
p173
aVand we do it in science as well. So we look, just look \u2014
p174
aVand scientists do it, constantly \u2014 we look for evidence
p175
aVthat reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able
p176
aVand willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans.
p179
aVThese are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science
p180
aVteaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France
p181
aVand the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.
p182
aVAnd, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,
p183
aVthere's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional \u2014
p184
aVin that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up
p185
aVfrom under the sheets in that scene in "Annie Hall,"
p186
aVand said, "God, that's so professional." And that you don't \u2014
p187
aVthere's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right,
p188
aVand, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation \u2014
p189
aVI'll use an example from nearby \u2014 is San Francisco Exploratorium,
p190
aVwhere all the things that \u2014 the demonstrations, and so on,
p191
aVare made out of everyday objects that children can understand,
p192
aVit's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.
p193
aVAnd I know that if the graduates at MIT
p194
aVand in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire
p195
aVand the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,
p196
aVthey would have learned how it actually works,
p197
aVrather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it.
p198
aVSo good interpretation is more about
p199
aVthings that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?
p200
aVAnd things that \u2014 where there isn't an extra barrier
p201
aVof a piece of glass or machined titanium,
p202
aVand it all looks fantastic, OK?
p203
aVAnd the Exploratorium does that really, really well.
p204
aVAnd it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense,
p205
aVin other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo, children are not empty vessels, OK?
p208
aVSo, as "Monty Python" would have it,
p209
aVthis is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,
p210
aVbut this is \u2014 children are not empty vessels.
p211
aVThey come with their own ideas and their own theories,
p212
aVand unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them,
p213
aVright? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas
p214
aVof how the world and universe operates, either.
p215
aVBut this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.
p216
aVFor example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover
p217
aVof the whole population into digital technology [for television].
p218
aVAnd it's one of the difficult things
p219
aVis that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,
p220
aVit's quite difficult to shift those.
p221
aVSo we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have
p222
aVas children persist into adulthood.
p223
aVPoor teaching actually does more harm than good.
p224
aVIn this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better
p225
aVby children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK?
p226
aVSame for gravity, two concepts, so it's \u2014 which is quite humbling,
p227
aVas a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after,
p228
aVthat's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.
p229
aVAnd we collude. We design tests,
p230
aVor at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?
p231
aVAnd governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.
p232
aVOK? We collude, and actually if you \u2014
p233
aVif someone had designed a test for me
p234
aVwhen I was doing my biology exams,
p235
aVto really understand, to see whether I'd understood
p236
aVmore than just kind of putting starch and iodine together
p237
aVand seeing it go blue,
p238
aVand really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,
p239
aVthen I might have done better at science.
p240
aVSo the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.
p241
aa(lp242
VYour homework is \u2014 you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift?
p243
aVAn obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads.
p244
aVAnd the second question to that then is,
p245
aVensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.
p246
aVAh ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?
p247
aVAnd you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.
p248
aVSo, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVI've always wanted to say that in this country.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVFinally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children,
p253
aVand anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff,
p254
aVbecause it's by fiddling with things that you, you know,
p255
aVyou complement your other learning. It's not a replacement,
p256
aVit's just part of learning that's important.
p257
aVThank you very much.
p258
aVNow \u2014 oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.

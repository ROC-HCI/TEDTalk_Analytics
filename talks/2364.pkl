VI want to tell you three stories
p5
aVabout the power of relationships
p6
aVto solve the deep and complex social problems of this century.
p7
aa(lp8
VYou know, sometimes it seems like all these problems
p9
aVof poverty, inequality, ill health, unemployment, violence, addiction \u2014
p10
aVthey're right there in one person's life.
p11
aVSo I want to tell you about someone like this that I know.
p12
aVI'm going to call her Ella.
p13
aVElla lives in a British city on a run down estate.
p14
aVThe shops are closed, the pub's gone,
p15
aVthe playground's pretty desolate and never used,
p16
aVand inside Ella's house, the tension is palpable
p17
aVand the noise levels are deafening.
p18
aVThe TV's on at full volume.
p19
aVOne of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters.
p20
aVAnother son, Ryan, is keeping up this constant stream of abuse from the kitchen,
p21
aVand the dogs are locked behind the bedroom door and straining.
p22
aVElla is stuck.
p23
aVShe has lived with crisis for 40 years.
p24
aVShe knows nothing else, and she knows no way out.
p25
aVShe's had a whole series of abusive partners,
p26
aVand, tragically, one of her children has been taken into care by social services.
p27
aVThe three children that still live with her
p28
aVsuffer from a whole range of problems, and none of them are in education.
p29
aVAnd Ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle
p30
aVof her own mother's life before her.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut when I met Ella, there were 73 different services
p33
aVon offer for her and her family in the city where she lives,
p34
aV73 different services run out of 24 departments in one city,
p35
aVand Ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them.
p36
aVThey think nothing of calling social services
p37
aVto try and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out.
p38
aVAnd the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers,
p39
aVyouth workers, a health officer, a housing officer, a home tutor
p40
aVand the local policemen.
p41
aVAnd the governments say that there are 100,000 families
p42
aVin Britain today like Ella's,
p43
aVstruggling to break the cycle of economic, social and environmental deprivation.
p44
aVAnd they also say that managing this problem
p45
aVcosts a quarter of a million pounds per family per year
p46
aVand yet nothing changes.
p47
aVNone of these well-meaning visitors are making a difference.
p48
aa(lp49
VThis is a chart we made in the same city with another family like Ella's.
p50
aVThis shows 30 years of intervention in that family's life.
p51
aVAnd just as with Ella, not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan.
p52
aVThere's no end goal in sight.
p53
aVNone of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues.
p54
aVThese are just containment measures, ways of managing a problem.
p55
aVOne of the policemen says to me,
p56
aV"Look, I just deliver the message and then I leave."
p57
aa(lp58
VSo, I've spent time living with families like Ella's
p59
aVin different parts of the world,
p60
aVbecause I want to know: what can we learn
p61
aVfrom places where our social institutions just aren't working?
p62
aVI want to know what it feels like to live in Ella's family.
p63
aVI want to know what's going on and what we can do differently.
p64
aa(lp65
VWell, the first thing I learned is that cost is a really slippery concept.
p66
aVBecause when the government says that a family like Ella's
p67
aVcosts a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage,
p68
aVwhat it really means
p69
aVis that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year.
p70
aVBecause not one penny of this money actually touches Ella's family
p71
aVin a way that makes a difference.
p72
aVInstead, the system is just like this costly gyroscope
p73
aVthat spins around the families, keeping them stuck at its heart,
p74
aVexactly where they are.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd I also spent time with the frontline workers,
p77
aVand I learned that it is an impossible situation.
p78
aVSo Tom, who is the social worker for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,
p79
aVhas to spend 86 percent of his time servicing the system:
p80
aVmeetings with colleagues, filling out forms,
p81
aVmore meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms,
p82
aVand maybe most shockingly,
p83
aVthe 14 percent of the time he has to be with Ryan
p84
aVis spent getting data and information for the system.
p85
aVSo he says to Ryan,
p86
aV"How often have you been smoking? Have you been drinking?
p87
aVWhen did you go to school?"
p88
aVAnd this kind of interaction rules out the possibility
p89
aVof a normal conversation.
p90
aVIt rules out the possibility of what's needed
p91
aVto build a relationship between Tom and Ryan.
p92
aa(lp93
VWhen we made this chart,
p94
aVthe frontline workers, the professionals \u2014
p95
aVthey stared at it absolutely amazed.
p96
aVIt snaked around the walls of their offices.
p97
aVSo many hours, so well meant, but ultimately so futile.
p98
aVAnd there was this moment of absolute breakdown,
p99
aVand then of clarity:
p100
aVwe had to work in a different way.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo in a really brave step, the leaders of the city where Ella lives
p103
aVagreed that we could start by reversing Ryan's ratio.
p104
aVSo everyone who came into contact with Ella or a family like Ella's
p105
aVwould spend 80 percent of their time working with the families
p106
aVand only 20 percent servicing the system.
p107
aVAnd even more radically,
p108
aVthe families would lead
p109
aVand they would decide who was in a best position to help them.
p110
aVSo Ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel,
p111
aVto choose from amongst the existing professionals
p112
aVwho would work with them.
p113
aVAnd many, many people wanted to join us,
p114
aVbecause you don't go into this kind of work to manage a system,
p115
aVyou go in because you can and you want to make a difference.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo Ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door,
p118
aV"What will you do when my son starts kicking me?"
p119
aVAnd so the first person who comes in says,
p120
aV"Well, I'll look around for the nearest exit
p121
aVand I will back out very slowly,
p122
aVand if the noise is still going on, I'll call my supervisor."
p123
aVAnd the mothers go, "You're the system. Get out of here!"
p124
aVAnd then the next person who comes is a policeman, and he says,
p125
aV"Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground and then I'm not sure what I'll do."
p126
aVAnd the mothers say, "Thank you."
p127
aVSo, they chose professionals who confessed
p128
aVthey didn't necessarily have the answers,
p129
aVwho said \u2014 well, they weren't going to talk in jargon.
p130
aVThey showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers
p131
aVthat they would stick with them through thick and thin,
p132
aVeven though they wouldn't be soft with them.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo these new teams and the families
p135
aVwere then given a sliver of the former budget,
p136
aVbut they could spend the money in any way they chose.
p137
aVAnd so one of the families went out for supper.
p138
aVThey went to McDonald's and they sat down and they talked and they listened
p139
aVfor the first time in a long time.
p140
aVAnother family asked the team
p141
aVif they would help them do up their home.
p142
aVAnd one mother took the money
p143
aVand she used it as a float to start a social enterprise.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd in a really short space of time,
p146
aVsomething new started to grow:
p147
aVa relationship between the team and the workers.
p148
aVAnd then some remarkable changes took place.
p149
aVMaybe it's not surprising
p150
aVthat the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards
p151
aVas well as forwards.
p152
aVBut today, she's completed an IT training course,
p153
aVshe has her first paid job, her children are back in school,
p154
aVand the neighbors,
p155
aVwho previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere
p156
aVexcept next door to them,
p157
aVare fine.
p158
aVThey've made some new friendships.
p159
aVAnd all the same people have been involved in this transformation \u2014
p160
aVsame families, same workers.
p161
aVBut the relationship between them has been supported to change.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo I'm telling you about Ella because I think that relationships
p164
aVare the critical resource we have
p165
aVin solving some of these intractable problems.
p166
aVBut today, our relationships are all but written off
p167
aVby our politics, our social policies, our welfare institutions.
p168
aVAnd I've learned that this really has to change.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo what do I mean by relationships?
p171
aVI'm talking about the simple human bonds between us,
p172
aVa kind of authentic sense of connection, of belonging,
p173
aVthe bonds that make us happy, that support us to change,
p174
aVto be brave like Ella and try something new.
p175
aVAnd, you know, it's no accident
p176
aVthat those who run and work in the institutions
p177
aVthat are supposed to support Ella and her family
p178
aVdon't talk about relationships,
p179
aVbecause relationships are expressly designed out of a welfare model
p180
aVthat was drawn up in Britain and exported around the world.
p181
aVThe contemporaries of William Beveridge,
p182
aVwho was the architect of the first welfare state
p183
aVand the author of the Beveridge Report,
p184
aVhad little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man.
p185
aVInstead, they trusted this idea of the impersonal system
p186
aVand the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system.
p187
aVAnd the impact of Beveridge
p188
aVon the way the modern state sees social issues
p189
aVjust can't be underestimated.
p190
aVThe Beveridge Report sold over 100,000 copies
p191
aVin the first weeks of publication alone.
p192
aVPeople queued in the rain on a November night to get hold of a copy,
p193
aVand it was read across the country, across the colonies, across Europe,
p194
aVacross the United States of America,
p195
aVand it had this huge impact
p196
aVon the way that welfare states were designed around the globe.
p197
aVThe cultures, the bureaucracies, the institutions \u2014 they are global,
p198
aVand they've come to seem like common sense.
p199
aVThey've become so ingrained in us,
p200
aVthat actually we don't even see them anymore.
p201
aVAnd I think it's really important to say that in the 20th century,
p202
aVthey were remarkably successful, these institutions.
p203
aVThey led to longer lifespans, the eradication of mass disease,
p204
aVmass housing, almost universal education.
p205
aVBut at the same time,
p206
aVBeveridge sowed the seeds of today's challenges.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo let me tell you a second story.
p209
aVWhat do you think today is a bigger killer than a lifetime of smoking?
p210
aVIt's loneliness.
p211
aVAccording to government statistics, one person over 60 \u2014 one in three \u2014
p212
aVdoesn't speak to or see another person in a week.
p213
aVOne person in 10, that's 850,000 people,
p214
aVdoesn't speak to anyone else in a month.
p215
aVAnd we're not the only people with this problem;
p216
aVthis problem touches the whole of the Western world.
p217
aVAnd it's even more acute in countries like China,
p218
aVwhere a process of rapid urbanization, mass migration, has left older people
p219
aValone in the villages.
p220
aVAnd so the services that Beveridge designed and exported \u2014
p221
aVthey can't address this kind of problem.
p222
aVLoneliness is like a collective relational challenge,
p223
aVand it can't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo some years ago, wanting to understand this problem,
p226
aVI started to work with a group of about 60 older people
p227
aVin South London, where I live.
p228
aVI went shopping, I played bingo,
p229
aVbut mainly I was just observing and listening.
p230
aVI wanted to know what we could do differently.
p231
aVAnd if you ask them, people tell you they want two things.
p232
aVThey want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb,
p233
aVor to be there when they come out of hospital.
p234
aVThey want on-demand, practical support.
p235
aVAnd they want to have fun.
p236
aVThey want to go out, do interesting things with like-minded people,
p237
aVand make friends like we've all made friends at every stage of our lives.
p238
aVSo we rented a phone line, hired a couple of handymen,
p239
aVand started a service we called "Circle."
p240
aVAnd Circle offers its local membership a toll-free 0 800 number
p241
aVthat they can call on demand for any support.
p242
aVAnd people have called us for so many reasons.
p243
aVThey've called because their pets are unwell,
p244
aVtheir DVD is broken, they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone,
p245
aVor maybe they are coming out of hospital
p246
aVand they want someone to be there.
p247
aVAnd Circle also offers a rich social calendar \u2014
p248
aVknitting, darts, museum tours, hot air ballooning \u2014 you name it.
p249
aVBut here's the interesting thing, the really deep change:
p250
aVover time, the friendships that have formed
p251
aVhave begun to replace the practical offer.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo let me tell you about Belinda.
p254
aVBelinda's a Circle member, and she was going into hospital for a hip operation,
p255
aVso she called her local Circle to say they wouldn't see her for a bit.
p256
aVAnd Damon, who runs the local Circle, calls her back and says, "How can I help?"
p257
aVAnd Belinda says, "Oh no, I'm fine \u2014
p258
aVJocelyn is doing the shopping, Tony's doing the gardening,
p259
aVMelissa and Joe are going to come in and cook and chat."
p260
aVSo five Circle members had organized themselves
p261
aVto take care of Belinda.
p262
aVAnd Belinda's 80, although she says that she feels 25 inside,
p263
aVbut she also says
p264
aVthat she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined Circle.
p265
aVBut the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event
p266
aVled to a process where natural friendships formed,
p267
aVfriendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services.
p268
aVIt's relationships that are making the difference.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo I think that three factors have converged
p271
aVthat enable us to put relationships at the heart and center
p272
aVof how we solve social problems today.
p273
aVFirstly, the nature of the problems \u2014
p274
aVthey've changed, and they require different solutions.
p275
aVSecondly, the cost, human as much as financial, of doing business as usual.
p276
aVAnd thirdly, technology.
p277
aa(lp278
VI've talked about the first two factors.
p279
aVIt's technology that enables these approaches to scale
p280
aVand potentially now support thousands of people.
p281
aVSo the technology we've used is really simple,
p282
aVit's made up of available things like databases, mobile phones.
p283
aVCircle has got this very simple system that underpins it,
p284
aVenables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand.
p285
aVAnd you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization
p286
aVof the 1970s,
p287
aVwhen this kind of scale just wasn't possible,
p288
aVneither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo it's relationships underpinned by technology
p291
aVthat can turn the Beveridge models on their heads.
p292
aVThe Beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources,
p293
aVanonymously managing access.
p294
aVIn my work at the front line,
p295
aVI've seen again and again how up to 80 percent of resource
p296
aVis spent keeping people out.
p297
aVSo professionals have to administer
p298
aVthese increasingly complex forms of administration
p299
aVthat are basically about stopping people accessing the service
p300
aVor managing the queue.
p301
aVAnd Circle, like the relational services that we and others have designed,
p302
aVinverts this logic.
p303
aVWhat it says is, the more people, the more relationships,
p304
aVthe stronger the solution.
p305
aVSo I want to tell you my third and final story,
p306
aVwhich is about unemployment.
p307
aVIn Britain, as in most places in the world,
p308
aVour welfare states were primarily designed
p309
aVto get people into work,
p310
aVto educate them for this,
p311
aVand to keep them healthy.
p312
aVBut here, too, the systems are failing.
p313
aVAnd so the response has been
p314
aVto try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional \u2014
p315
aVto speed up processing times, divide people into ever-smaller categories,
p316
aVtry and target services at them more efficiently \u2014 in other words,
p317
aVthe very opposite of relational.
p318
aa(lp319
VBut guess how most people find work today?
p320
aVThrough word of mouth.
p321
aVIt turns out that in Britain today, most new jobs are not advertised.
p322
aVSo it's friends that tell you about a job,
p323
aVit's friends that recommend you for a job,
p324
aVand it's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work.
p325
aVMaybe some of you here this evening are thinking,
p326
aV"But I found my job through an advert,"
p327
aVbut if you think back, it was probably a friend that showed you the ad
p328
aVand then encouraged you to apply.
p329
aVBut not surprisingly,
p330
aVpeople who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network
p331
aVare those who are most isolated from it.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo knowing this,
p334
aVand also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems,
p335
aVwe designed something new with relationships at its heart.
p336
aVWe designed a service that encourages people to meet up,
p337
aVpeople in and out of work,
p338
aVto work together in structured ways
p339
aVand try new opportunities.
p340
aVAnd, well, it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems
p341
aVwith the old transactional models,
p342
aVbut it looks like, with our first 1,000 members,
p343
aVwe outperformed existing services by a factor of three,
p344
aVat a fraction of the cost.
p345
aVAnd here, too, we've used technology,
p346
aVbut not to network people in the way that a social platform would do.
p347
aVWe've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other,
p348
aVbuilding real relationships and supporting people to find work.
p349
aa(lp350
VAt the end of his life, in 1948,
p351
aVBeveridge wrote a third report.
p352
aVAnd in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake.
p353
aVHe had left people and their communities out.
p354
aVAnd this omission, he said, led to seeing people,
p355
aVand people starting to see themselves,
p356
aVwithin the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions.
p357
aVAnd human relationships were already withering.
p358
aVBut unfortunately, this third report was much less read
p359
aVthan Beveridge's earlier work.
p360
aa(lp361
VBut today, we need to bring people and their communities
p362
aVback into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services,
p363
aVin an approach that I call "Relational Welfare."
p364
aVWe need to leave behind these old, transactional,
p365
aVunsuitable, outdated models,
p366
aVand we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses
p367
aVthat can support a family like Ella's,
p368
aVthat can address an issue like loneliness,
p369
aVthat can support people into work and up the skills curve
p370
aVin a modern labor market,
p371
aVthat can also address challenges of education, of health care systems,
p372
aVand so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies.
p373
aVIt is all about relationships.
p374
aVRelationships are the critical resource we have.
p375
aa(lp376
VThank you.

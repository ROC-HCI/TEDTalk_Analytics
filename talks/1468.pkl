VWhen I go to parties,
p5
aVit doesn't usually take very long
p6
aVfor people to find out
p7
aVthat I'm a scientist and I study sex.
p8
aVAnd then I get asked questions.
p9
aVAnd the questions usually have a very particular format.
p10
aVThey start with the phrase,
p11
aV"A friend told me,"
p12
aVand then they end with the phrase,
p13
aV"Is this true?"
p14
aVAnd most of the time
p15
aVI'm glad to say that I can answer them,
p16
aVbut sometimes I have to say,
p17
aV"I'm really sorry,
p18
aVbut I don't know
p19
aVbecause I'm not that kind of a doctor."
p20
aa(lp21
VThat is, I'm not a clinician,
p22
aVI'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy.
p23
aVAnd my job is to look at lots of different species of animals
p24
aVand try to figure out how their tissues and organs work
p25
aVwhen everything's going right,
p26
aVrather than trying to figure out
p27
aVhow to fix things when they go wrong,
p28
aVlike so many of you.
p29
aVAnd what I do is I look for similarities and differences
p30
aVin the solutions that they've evolved
p31
aVfor fundamental biological problems.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo today I'm here to argue
p34
aVthat this is not at all
p35
aVan esoteric Ivory Tower activity
p36
aVthat we find at our universities,
p37
aVbut that broad study
p38
aVacross species, tissue types and organ systems
p39
aVcan produce insights
p40
aVthat have direct implications for human health.
p41
aVAnd this is true both of my recent project
p42
aVon sex differences in the brain,
p43
aVand my more mature work
p44
aVon the anatomy and function of penises.
p45
aVAnd now you know why I'm fun at parties.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo today I'm going to give you an example
p50
aVdrawn from my penis study
p51
aVto show you how knowledge
p52
aVdrawn from studies of one organ system
p53
aVprovided insights into a very different one.
p54
aVNow I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows \u2014
p55
aVI did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week \u2014
p56
aVpenises are structures that transfer sperm
p57
aVfrom one individual to another.
p58
aVAnd the slide behind me
p59
aVbarely scratches the surface
p60
aVof how widespread they are in animals.
p61
aVThere's an enormous amount of anatomical variation.
p62
aVYou find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins,
p63
aVas well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder
p64
aVthat we're all familiar with \u2014
p65
aVor at least half of you are.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd I think we see this tremendous variation
p70
aVbecause it's a really effective solution
p71
aVto a very basic biological problem,
p72
aVand that is getting sperm in a position
p73
aVto meet up with eggs and form zygotes.
p74
aVNow the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion,
p75
aVbut when internal fertilization evolves,
p76
aVpenises often follow.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd the question I get when I start talking about this most often is,
p79
aV"What made you interested in this subject?"
p80
aVAnd the answer is skeletons.
p81
aVYou wouldn't think that skeletons and penises
p82
aVhave very much to do with one another.
p83
aVAnd that's because we tend to think of skeletons
p84
aVas stiff lever systems
p85
aVthat produce speed or power.
p86
aVAnd my first forays into biological research,
p87
aVdoing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate,
p88
aVwere really squarely in that realm.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics,
p91
aVI really wanted to find a dissertation project
p92
aVthat would expand our knowledge of skeletal function.
p93
aVI tried a bunch of different stuff.
p94
aVA lot of it didn't pan out.
p95
aVBut then one day I started thinking
p96
aVabout the mammalian penis.
p97
aVAnd it's really an odd sort of structure.
p98
aVBefore it can be used for internal fertilization,
p99
aVits mechanical behavior has to change
p100
aVin a really dramatic fashion.
p101
aVMost of the time it's a flexible organ.
p102
aVIt's easy to bend.
p103
aVBut before it's brought into use
p104
aVduring copulation
p105
aVit has to become rigid,
p106
aVit has to become difficult to bend.
p107
aVAnd moreover, it has to work.
p108
aVA reproductive system that fails to function
p109
aVproduces an individual that has no offspring,
p110
aVand that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd so I thought, "Here's a problem
p113
aVthat just cries out for a skeletal system \u2014
p114
aVnot one like this one,
p115
aVbut one like this one \u2014
p116
aVbecause, functionally,
p117
aVa skeleton is any system
p118
aVthat supports tissue and transmits forces.
p119
aVAnd I already knew that animals like this earthworm,
p120
aVindeed most animals,
p121
aVdon't support their tissues
p122
aVby draping them over bones.
p123
aVInstead they're more like reinforced water balloons.
p124
aVThey use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton.
p125
aVAnd a hydrostatic skeleton
p126
aVuses two elements.
p127
aVThe skeletal support comes from an interaction
p128
aVbetween a pressurized fluid
p129
aVand a surrounding wall of tissue
p130
aVthat's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins.
p131
aVAnd the interaction is crucial.
p132
aVWithout both elements you have no support.
p133
aVIf you have fluid
p134
aVwith no wall to surround it
p135
aVand keep pressure up,
p136
aVyou have a puddle.
p137
aVAnd if you have just the wall
p138
aVwith no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension,
p139
aVyou've got a little wet rag.
p140
aa(lp141
VWhen you look at a penis in cross section,
p142
aVit has a lot of the hallmarks
p143
aVof a hydrostatic skeleton.
p144
aVIt has a central space
p145
aVof spongy erectile tissue
p146
aVthat fills with fluid \u2014 in this case blood \u2014
p147
aVsurrounded by a wall of tissue
p148
aVthat's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut at the time when I started this project,
p151
aVthe best explanation I could find for penal erection
p152
aVwas that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues,
p153
aVand the spongy tissues filled with blood
p154
aVand pressure rose and voila! it became erect.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd that explained to me expansion \u2014
p157
aVmade sense: more fluid, you get tissues that expand \u2014
p158
aVbut it didn't actually explain erection.
p159
aVBecause there was no mechanism in this explanation
p160
aVfor making this structure hard to bend.
p161
aVAnd no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue.
p162
aVSo I thought, wall tissue's important in skeletons.
p163
aVIt has to be part of the explanation.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd this was the point
p166
aVat which my graduate adviser said,
p167
aV"Whoa! Hold on. Slow down."
p168
aVBecause after about six months of me talking about this,
p169
aVI think he finally figured out
p170
aVthat I was really serious about the penis thing.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VSo he sat me down, and he warned me.
p175
aVHe was like, "Be careful going down this path.
p176
aVI'm not sure this project's going to pan out."
p177
aVBecause he was afraid I was walking into a trap.
p178
aVI was taking on a socially embarrassing question
p179
aVwith an answer that he thought
p180
aVmight not be particularly interesting.
p181
aVAnd that was because
p182
aVevery hydrostatic skeleton
p183
aVthat we had found in nature up to that point
p184
aVhad the same basic elements.
p185
aVIt had the central fluid,
p186
aVit had the surrounding wall,
p187
aVand the reinforcing fibers in the wall
p188
aVwere arranged in crossed helices
p189
aVaround the long axis of the skeleton.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo the image behind me
p192
aVshows a piece of tissue
p193
aVin one of these cross helical skeletons
p194
aVcut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall.
p195
aVThe arrow shows you the long axis.
p196
aVAnd you can see two layers of fibers,
p197
aVone in blue and one in yellow,
p198
aVarranged in left-handed and right-handed angles.
p199
aVAnd if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers,
p200
aVthose fibers would be going in helices
p201
aVaround the long axis of the skeleton \u2014
p202
aVsomething like a Chinese finger trap,
p203
aVwhere you stick your fingers in and they get stuck.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors,
p206
aVwhich I'm going to demonstrate in a film.
p207
aVIt's a model skeleton
p208
aVthat I made out of a piece of cloth
p209
aVthat I wrapped around an inflated balloon.
p210
aVThe cloth's cut on the bias.
p211
aVSo you can see that the fibers wrap in helices,
p212
aVand those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves,
p213
aVwhich means the skeleton's flexible.
p214
aVIt lengthens, shortens and bends really easily
p215
aVin response to internal or external forces.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow my adviser's concern
p218
aVwas what if the penile wall tissue
p219
aVis just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton.
p220
aVWhat are you going to contribute?
p221
aVWhat new thing are you contributing
p222
aVto our knowledge of biology?
p223
aVAnd I thought, "Yeah, he does have a really good point here."
p224
aVSo I spent a long, long time thinking about it.
p225
aVAnd one thing kept bothering me,
p226
aVand that's, when they're functioning,
p227
aVpenises don't wiggle.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVSo something interesting had to be going on.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo I went ahead, collected wall tissue,
p232
aVprepared it so it was erect,
p233
aVsectioned it, put it on slides
p234
aVand then stuck it under the microscope to have a look,
p235
aVfully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.
p236
aVBut instead I saw this.
p237
aVThere's an outer layer and an inner layer.
p238
aVThe arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton.
p239
aa(lp240
VI was really surprised at this.
p241
aVEveryone I showed it
p242
aVwas really surprised at this.
p243
aVWhy was everyone surprised at this?
p244
aVThat's because we knew theoretically
p245
aVthat there was another way
p246
aVof arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton,
p247
aVand that was with fibers at zero degrees
p248
aVand 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure.
p249
aVThe thing is, no one had ever seen it before in nature.
p250
aVAnd now I was looking at one.
p251
aa(lp252
VThose fibers in that particular orientation
p253
aVgive the skeleton a very, very different behavior.
p254
aVI'm going to show a model
p255
aVmade out of exactly the same materials.
p256
aVSo it'll be made of the same cotton cloth,
p257
aVsame balloon, same internal pressure.
p258
aVBut the only difference
p259
aVis that the fibers are arranged differently.
p260
aVAnd you'll see that, unlike the cross helical model,
p261
aVthis model resists extension and contraction
p262
aVand resists bending.
p263
aa(lp264
VNow what that tells us
p265
aVis that wall tissues are doing so much more
p266
aVthan just covering the vascular tissues.
p267
aVThey're an integral part of the penile skeleton.
p268
aVIf the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there,
p269
aVif it wasn't reinforced in this way,
p270
aVthe shape would change,
p271
aVbut the inflated penis would not resist bending,
p272
aVand erection simply wouldn't work.
p273
aa(lp274
VIt's an observation with obvious medical applications
p275
aVin humans as well,
p276
aVbut it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think,
p277
aVto the design of prosthetics, soft robots,
p278
aVbasically anything
p279
aVwhere changes of shape and stiffness are important.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo to sum up:
p282
aVTwenty years ago,
p283
aVI had a college adviser tell me,
p284
aVwhen I went to the college and said,
p285
aV"I'm kind of interested in anatomy,"
p286
aVthey said, "Anatomy's a dead science."
p287
aVHe couldn't have been more wrong.
p288
aVI really believe that we still have a lot to learn
p289
aVabout the normal structure and function of our bodies.
p290
aVNot just about its genetics and molecular biology,
p291
aVbut up here in the meat end of the scale.
p292
aVWe've got limits on our time.
p293
aVWe often focus on one disease,
p294
aVone model, one problem,
p295
aVbut my experience suggests
p296
aVthat we should take the time
p297
aVto apply ideas broadly between systems
p298
aVand just see where it takes us.
p299
aVAfter all, if ideas about invertebrate skeletons
p300
aVcan give us insights
p301
aVabout mammalian reproductive systems,
p302
aVthere could be lots of other wild and productive connections
p303
aVlurking out there just waiting to be found.
p304
aa(lp305
VThank you.

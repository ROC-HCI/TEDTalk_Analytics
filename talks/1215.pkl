VToday I'd like to show you
p5
aVthe future of the way we make things.
p6
aVI believe that soon our buildings and machines
p7
aVwill be self-assembling,
p8
aVreplicating and repairing themselves.
p9
aVSo I'm going to show you
p10
aVwhat I believe is the current state of manufacturing,
p11
aVand then compare that to some natural systems.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers \u2014
p14
aVtwo and a half years [of assembly time],
p15
aV500,000 to a million parts,
p16
aVfairly complex,
p17
aVnew, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
p18
aVWe have exciting machines
p19
aVthat can take us into space \u2014
p20
aVfive years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut on the other side, if you look at the natural systems,
p23
aVwe have proteins
p24
aVthat have two million types,
p25
aVcan fold in 10,000 nanoseconds,
p26
aVor DNA with three billion base pairs
p27
aVwe can replicate in roughly an hour.
p28
aVSo there's all of this complexity
p29
aVin our natural systems,
p30
aVbut they're extremely efficient,
p31
aVfar more efficient than anything we can build,
p32
aVfar more complex than anything we can build.
p33
aVThey're far more efficient in terms of energy.
p34
aVThey hardly ever make mistakes.
p35
aVAnd they can repair themselves for longevity.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo there's something super interesting about natural systems.
p38
aVAnd if we can translate that
p39
aVinto our built environment,
p40
aVthen there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
p41
aVAnd I think the key to that is self-assembly.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment,
p44
aVI think there's four key factors.
p45
aVThe first is that we need to decode
p46
aVall of the complexity of what we want to build \u2014
p47
aVso our buildings and machines.
p48
aVAnd we need to decode that into simple sequences \u2014
p49
aVbasically the DNA of how our buildings work.
p50
aVThen we need programmable parts
p51
aVthat can take that sequence
p52
aVand use that to fold up, or reconfigure.
p53
aVWe need some energy that's going to allow that to activate,
p54
aVallow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.
p55
aVAnd we need some type of error correction redundancy
p56
aVto guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo I'm going to show you a number of projects
p59
aVthat my colleagues and I at MIT are working on
p60
aVto achieve this self-assembling future.
p61
aVThe first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.
p62
aVSo these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots \u2014
p63
aV8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
p64
aVThey're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
p65
aVYou decode what you want to fold up into,
p66
aVinto a sequence of angles \u2014
p67
aVso negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0,
p68
aV120, negative 120 \u2014 something like that;
p69
aVso a sequence of angles, or turns,
p70
aVand you send that sequence through the string.
p71
aVEach unit takes its message \u2014 so negative 120 \u2014
p72
aVit rotates to that, checks if it got there
p73
aVand then passes it to its neighbor.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo these are the brilliant scientists,
p76
aVengineers, designers that worked on this project.
p77
aVAnd I think it really brings to light:
p78
aVIs this really scalable?
p79
aVI mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours
p80
aVmade to make this eight-foot robot.
p81
aVCan we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
p82
aVThe next one questions that
p83
aVand looks at passive nature,
p84
aVor passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.
p85
aVBut it goes a step further,
p86
aVand it tries to have actual computation.
p87
aVIt basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing,
p88
aVthe digital logic gate,
p89
aVdirectly into your parts.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo this is a NAND gate.
p92
aVYou have one tetrahedron which is the gate
p93
aVthat's going to do your computing,
p94
aVand you have two input tetrahedrons.
p95
aVOne of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.
p96
aVThe other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
p97
aVAnd then it gives you an output in 3D space.
p98
aVSo what this means
p99
aVis that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
p100
aVIt computes on what it was doing before
p101
aVand what you said you wanted it to do.
p102
aVAnd now it starts moving in three-dimensional space \u2014
p103
aVso up or down.
p104
aVSo on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
p105
aVOn the right-hand side,
p106
aV[0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
p107
aVAnd so what that really means
p108
aVis that our structures now contain the blueprints
p109
aVof what we want to build.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
p112
aVSo that means that we can have some form of self-replication.
p113
aVIn this case I call it self-guided replication,
p114
aVbecause your structure contains the exact blueprints.
p115
aVIf you have errors, you can replace a part.
p116
aVAll the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
p117
aVSo you could have something that climbs along and reads it
p118
aVand can output at one to one.
p119
aVIt's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains,
p122
aVand it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now
p123
aVof passive self-assembly systems.
p124
aVSo it takes the reconfigurability
p125
aVand programmability
p126
aVand makes it a completely passive system.
p127
aVSo basically you have a chain of elements.
p128
aVEach element is completely identical,
p129
aVand they're biased.
p130
aVSo each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
p131
aVSo as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
p132
aVYou're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
p133
aVSo when you shake the chain,
p134
aVit then folds up
p135
aVinto any configuration that you've programmed in \u2014
p136
aVso in this case, a spiral,
p137
aVor in this case,
p138
aVtwo cubes next to each other.
p139
aVSo you can basically program
p140
aVany three-dimensional shape \u2014
p141
aVor one-dimensional, two-dimensional \u2014 up into this chain completely passively.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo what does this tell us about the future?
p144
aVI think that it's telling us
p145
aVthat there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair
p146
aVin our physical structures, our buildings, machines.
p147
aVThere's new programmability in these parts.
p148
aVAnd from that you have new possibilities for computing.
p149
aVWe'll have spatial computing.
p150
aVImagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines,
p151
aVall of our bricks could actually compute.
p152
aVThat's amazing parallel and distributed computing power,
p153
aVnew design possibilities.
p154
aVSo it's exciting potential for this.
p155
aVSo I think these projects I've showed here
p156
aVare just a tiny step towards this future,
p157
aVif we implement these new technologies
p158
aVfor a new self-assembling world.
p159
aa(lp160
VThank you.

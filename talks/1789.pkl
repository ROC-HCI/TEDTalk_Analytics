VWhere do you come from?
p5
aVIt's such a simple question,
p6
aVbut these days, of course, simple questions
p7
aVbring ever more complicated answers.
p8
aa(lp9
VPeople are always asking me where I come from,
p10
aVand they're expecting me to say India,
p11
aVand they're absolutely right insofar as 100 percent
p12
aVof my blood and ancestry does come from India.
p13
aVExcept, I've never lived one day of my life there.
p14
aVI can't speak even one word
p15
aVof its more than 22,000 dialects.
p16
aVSo I don't think I've really earned the right
p17
aVto call myself an Indian.
p18
aVAnd if "Where do you come from?"
p19
aVmeans "Where were you born and raised and educated?"
p20
aVthen I'm entirely of that funny little country
p21
aVknown as England,
p22
aVexcept I left England as soon as I completed
p23
aVmy undergraduate education,
p24
aVand all the time I was growing up,
p25
aVI was the only kid in all my classes
p26
aVwho didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes
p27
aVrepresented in our textbooks.
p28
aVAnd if "Where do you come from?"
p29
aVmeans "Where do you pay your taxes?
p30
aVWhere do you see your doctor and your dentist?"
p31
aVthen I'm very much of the United States,
p32
aVand I have been for 48 years now,
p33
aVsince I was a really small child.
p34
aVExcept, for many of those years,
p35
aVI've had to carry around this funny little pink card
p36
aVwith green lines running through my face
p37
aVidentifying me as a permanent alien.
p38
aVI do actually feel more alien the longer I live there.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd if "Where do you come from?"
p43
aVmeans "Which place goes deepest inside you
p44
aVand where do you try to spend most of your time?"
p45
aVthen I'm Japanese,
p46
aVbecause I've been living as much as I can
p47
aVfor the last 25 years in Japan.
p48
aVExcept, all of those years I've been there on a tourist visa,
p49
aVand I'm fairly sure not many Japanese
p50
aVwould want to consider me one of them.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd I say all this just to stress
p53
aVhow very old-fashioned and straightforward
p54
aVmy background is,
p55
aVbecause when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver,
p56
aVmost of the kids I meet
p57
aVare much more international and multi-cultured than I am.
p58
aVAnd they have one home associated with their parents,
p59
aVbut another associated with their partners,
p60
aVa third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be,
p61
aVa fourth connected with the place they dream of being,
p62
aVand many more besides.
p63
aVAnd their whole life will be spent taking pieces
p64
aVof many different places and putting them together
p65
aVinto a stained glass whole.
p66
aVHome for them is really a work in progress.
p67
aVIt's like a project on which they're constantly adding
p68
aVupgrades and improvements and corrections.
p69
aVAnd for more and more of us,
p70
aVhome has really less to do with a piece of soil
p71
aVthan, you could say, with a piece of soul.
p72
aa(lp73
VIf somebody suddenly asks me, "Where's your home?"
p74
aVI think about my sweetheart or my closest friends
p75
aVor the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be.
p76
aVAnd I'd always felt this way,
p77
aVbut it really came home to me, as it were,
p78
aVsome years ago when I was climbing up the stairs
p79
aVin my parents' house in California,
p80
aVand I looked through the living room windows
p81
aVand I saw that we were encircled by 70-foot flames,
p82
aVone of those wildfires that regularly tear through
p83
aVthe hills of California and many other such places.
p84
aVAnd three hours later, that fire had reduced
p85
aVmy home and every last thing in it
p86
aVexcept for me to ash.
p87
aVAnd when I woke up the next morning,
p88
aVI was sleeping on a friend's floor,
p89
aVthe only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush
p90
aVI had just bought from an all-night supermarket.
p91
aVOf course, if anybody asked me then,
p92
aV"Where is your home?"
p93
aVI literally couldn't point to any physical construction.
p94
aVMy home would have to be whatever I carried around inside me.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd in so many ways, I think this is a terrific liberation.
p97
aVBecause when my grandparents were born,
p98
aVthey pretty much had their sense of home,
p99
aVtheir sense of community, even their sense of enmity,
p100
aVassigned to them at birth,
p101
aVand didn't have much chance of stepping outside of that.
p102
aVAnd nowadays, at least some of us can choose our sense of home,
p103
aVcreate our sense of community,
p104
aVfashion our sense of self, and in so doing
p105
aVmaybe step a little beyond
p106
aVsome of the black and white divisions
p107
aVof our grandparents' age.
p108
aVNo coincidence that the president
p109
aVof the strongest nation on Earth is half-Kenyan,
p110
aVpartly raised in Indonesia,
p111
aVhas a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law.
p112
aa(lp113
VThe number of people living in countries not their own
p114
aVnow comes to 220 million,
p115
aVand that's an almost unimaginable number,
p116
aVbut it means that if you took the whole population of Canada
p117
aVand the whole population of Australia
p118
aVand then the whole population of Australia again
p119
aVand the whole population of Canada again
p120
aVand doubled that number,
p121
aVyou would still have fewer people than belong
p122
aVto this great floating tribe.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd the number of us who live outside
p125
aVthe old nation-state categories is increasing so quickly,
p126
aVby 64 million just in the last 12 years,
p127
aVthat soon there will be more of us than there are Americans.
p128
aVAlready, we represent the fifth-largest nation on Earth.
p129
aVAnd in fact, in Canada's largest city, Toronto,
p130
aVthe average resident today is what used to be called
p131
aVa foreigner, somebody born in a very different country.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd I've always felt that the beauty of being surrounded by the foreign
p134
aVis that it slaps you awake.
p135
aVYou can't take anything for granted.
p136
aVTravel, for me, is a little bit like being in love,
p137
aVbecause suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked "on."
p138
aVSuddenly you're alert to the secret patterns of the world.
p139
aVThe real voyage of discovery, as Marcel Proust famously said,
p140
aVconsists not in seeing new sights,
p141
aVbut in looking with new eyes.
p142
aVAnd of course, once you have new eyes,
p143
aVeven the old sights, even your home
p144
aVbecome something different.
p145
aVMany of the people living in countries not their own
p146
aVare refugees who never wanted to leave home
p147
aVand ache to go back home.
p148
aVBut for the fortunate among us,
p149
aVI think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities.
p150
aa(lp151
VCertainly when I'm traveling,
p152
aVespecially to the major cities of the world,
p153
aVthe typical person I meet today
p154
aVwill be, let's say, a half-Korean, half-German young woman
p155
aVliving in Paris.
p156
aVAnd as soon as she meets a half-Thai,
p157
aVhalf-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh,
p158
aVshe recognizes him as kin.
p159
aVShe realizes that she probably has much more in common with him
p160
aVthan with anybody entirely of Korea or entirely of Germany.
p161
aVSo they become friends. They fall in love.
p162
aVThey move to New York City.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VOr Edinburgh.
p167
aVAnd the little girl who arises out of their union
p168
aVwill of course be not Korean or German
p169
aVor French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian
p170
aVor even American, but a wonderful
p171
aVand constantly evolving mix of all those places.
p172
aVAnd potentially, everything about the way
p173
aVthat young woman dreams about the world,
p174
aVwrites about the world, thinks about the world,
p175
aVcould be something different,
p176
aVbecause it comes out of this almost unprecedented
p177
aVblend of cultures.
p178
aa(lp179
VWhere you come from now is much less important
p180
aVthan where you're going.
p181
aVMore and more of us are rooted in the future
p182
aVor the present tense as much as in the past.
p183
aVAnd home, we know, is not just the place
p184
aVwhere you happen to be born.
p185
aVIt's the place where you become yourself.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd yet,
p188
aVthere is one great problem with movement,
p189
aVand that is that it's really hard to get your bearings
p190
aVwhen you're in midair.
p191
aVSome years ago, I noticed that I had accumulated
p192
aVone million miles on United Airlines alone.
p193
aVYou all know that crazy system,
p194
aVsix days in hell, you get the seventh day free.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd I began to think that really,
p199
aVmovement was only as good as the sense of stillness
p200
aVthat you could bring to it to put it into perspective.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd eight months after my house burned down,
p203
aVI ran into a friend who taught at a local high school,
p204
aVand he said, "I've got the perfect place for you."
p205
aV"Really?" I said. I'm always a bit skeptical
p206
aVwhen people say things like that.
p207
aV"No, honestly," he went on,
p208
aV"it's only three hours away by car,
p209
aVand it's not very expensive,
p210
aVand it's probably not like anywhere you've stayed before."
p211
aV"Hmm." I was beginning to get slightly intrigued. "What is it?"
p212
aV"Well \u2014" Here my friend hemmed and hawed \u2014
p213
aV"Well, actually it's a Catholic hermitage."
p214
aVThis was the wrong answer.
p215
aVI had spent 15 years in Anglican schools,
p216
aVso I had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime.
p217
aVSeveral lifetimes, actually.
p218
aVBut my friend assured me that he wasn't Catholic,
p219
aVnor were most of his students,
p220
aVbut he took his classes there every spring.
p221
aVAnd as he had it, even the most restless, distractible,
p222
aVtestosterone-addled 15-year-old Californian boy
p223
aVonly had to spend three days in silence
p224
aVand something in him cooled down and cleared out.
p225
aVHe found himself.
p226
aVAnd I thought, "Anything that works for a 15-year-old boy
p227
aVought to work for me."
p228
aa(lp229
VSo I got in my car, and I drove three hours north
p230
aValong the coast,
p231
aVand the roads grew emptier and narrower,
p232
aVand then I turned onto an even narrower path,
p233
aVbarely paved, that snaked for two miles
p234
aVup to the top of a mountain.
p235
aVAnd when I got out of my car,
p236
aVthe air was pulsing.
p237
aVThe whole place was absolutely silent,
p238
aVbut the silence wasn't an absence of noise.
p239
aVIt was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening.
p240
aVAnd at my feet was the great, still blue plate
p241
aVof the Pacific Ocean.
p242
aVAll around me were 800 acres of wild dry brush.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd I went down to the room in which I was to be sleeping.
p245
aVSmall but eminently comfortable,
p246
aVit had a bed and a rocking chair
p247
aVand a long desk and even longer picture windows
p248
aVlooking out on a small, private, walled garden,
p249
aVand then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass
p250
aVrunning down to the sea.
p251
aVAnd I sat down, and I began to write,
p252
aVand write, and write,
p253
aVeven though I'd gone there really to get away from my desk.
p254
aVAnd by the time I got up, four hours had passed.
p255
aVNight had fallen,
p256
aVand I went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars,
p257
aVand I could see the tail lights of cars
p258
aVdisappearing around the headlands 12 miles to the south.
p259
aVAnd it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day
p260
aVvanishing.
p261
aVAnd the next day, when I woke up
p262
aVin the absence of telephones and TVs and laptops,
p263
aVthe days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours.
p264
aVIt was really all the freedom I know when I'm traveling,
p265
aVbut it also profoundly felt like coming home.
p266
aVAnd I'm not a religious person,
p267
aVso I didn't go to the services.
p268
aVI didn't consult the monks for guidance.
p269
aVI just took walks along the monastery road
p270
aVand sent postcards to loved ones.
p271
aVI looked at the clouds,
p272
aVand I did what is hardest of all for me to do usually,
p273
aVwhich is nothing at all.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd I started to go back to this place,
p276
aVand I noticed that I was doing my most important work there
p277
aVinvisibly just by sitting still,
p278
aVand certainly coming to my most critical decisions
p279
aVthe way I never could when I was racing
p280
aVfrom the last email to the next appointment.
p281
aVAnd I began to think that something in me
p282
aVhad really been crying out for stillness,
p283
aVbut of course I couldn't hear it
p284
aVbecause I was running around so much.
p285
aVI was like some crazy guy who puts on a blindfold
p286
aVand then complains that he can't see a thing.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd I thought back to that wonderful phrase
p289
aVI had learned as a boy from Seneca,
p290
aVin which he says, "That man is poor
p291
aVnot who has little but who hankers after more."
p292
aVAnd, of course, I'm not suggesting
p293
aVthat anybody here go into a monastery.
p294
aVThat's not the point.
p295
aVBut I do think it's only by stopping movement
p296
aVthat you can see where to go.
p297
aVAnd it's only by stepping out of your life and the world
p298
aVthat you can see what you most deeply care about
p299
aVand find a home.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd I've noticed so many people now
p302
aVtake conscious measures to sit quietly for 30 minutes
p303
aVevery morning just collecting themselves
p304
aVin one corner of the room without their devices,
p305
aVor go running every evening,
p306
aVor leave their cell phones behind
p307
aVwhen they go to have a long conversation with a friend.
p308
aVMovement is a fantastic privilege,
p309
aVand it allows us to do so much that our grandparents
p310
aVcould never have dreamed of doing.
p311
aVBut movement, ultimately,
p312
aVonly has a meaning if you have a home to go back to.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd home, in the end, is of course
p315
aVnot just the place where you sleep.
p316
aVIt's the place where you stand.
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you.

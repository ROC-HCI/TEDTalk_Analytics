VI think it's safe to say
p5
aVthat all humans will be intimate with death
p6
aVat least once in their lives.
p7
aVBut what if that intimacy began
p8
aVlong before you faced your own transition
p9
aVfrom life into death?
p10
aVWhat would life be like
p11
aVif the dead literally lived alongside you?
p12
aa(lp13
VIn my husband's homeland
p14
aVin the highlands of Sulawesi island
p15
aVin eastern Indonesia,
p16
aVthere is a community of people that experience death
p17
aVnot as a singular event
p18
aVbut as a gradual social process.
p19
aVIn Tana Toraja,
p20
aVthe most important social moments in people's lives,
p21
aVthe focal points of social and cultural interaction
p22
aVare not weddings or births or even family dinners,
p23
aVbut funerals.
p24
aVSo these funerals are characterized
p25
aVby elaborate rituals
p26
aVthat tie people in a system of reciprocal debt
p27
aVbased on the amount of animals \u2014
p28
aVpigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo \u2014
p29
aVthat are sacrificed and distributed
p30
aVin the name of the deceased.
p31
aVSo this cultural complex surrounding death,
p32
aVthe ritual enactment of the end of life,
p33
aVhas made death the most visible
p34
aVand remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape.
p35
aVLasting anywhere from a few days
p36
aVto a few weeks,
p37
aVfuneral ceremonies are a raucous affair,
p38
aVwhere commemorating someone who's died
p39
aVis not so much a private sadness
p40
aVbut more of a publicly shared transition.
p41
aVAnd it's a transition that's just as much
p42
aVabout the identity of the living
p43
aVas it is about remembrance of the dead.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo every year, thousands of visitors
p46
aVcome to Tana Toraja to see, as it were,
p47
aVthis culture of death,
p48
aVand for many people these grandiose ceremonies
p49
aVand the length of the ceremonies
p50
aVare somehow incommensurable
p51
aVwith the way that we face our own mortality in the West.
p52
aVSo even as we share death as a universal experience,
p53
aVit's not experienced the same way the world over.
p54
aVAnd as an anthropologist,
p55
aVI see these differences in experience
p56
aVbeing rooted in the cultural and social world
p57
aVthrough which we define the phenomena around us.
p58
aVSo where we see an unquestionable reality,
p59
aVdeath as an irrefutable biological condition,
p60
aVTorajans see the expired corporeal form
p61
aVas part of a larger social genesis.
p62
aVSo again, the physical cessation of life
p63
aVis not the same as death.
p64
aVIn fact, a member of society is only truly dead
p65
aVwhen the extended family can agree upon
p66
aVand marshal the resources necessary
p67
aVto hold a funeral ceremony
p68
aVthat is considered appropriate in terms of resources
p69
aVfor the status of the deceased.
p70
aVAnd this ceremony has to take place
p71
aVin front of the eyes of the whole community
p72
aVwith everyone's participation.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo after a person's physical death,
p75
aVtheir body is placed in a special room
p76
aVin the traditional residence, which is called the tongkonan.
p77
aVAnd the tongkonan is symbolic
p78
aVnot only of the family's identity
p79
aVbut also of the human life cycle from birth to death.
p80
aVSo essentially, the shape of the building
p81
aVthat you're born into is the shape
p82
aVof the structure which carries you
p83
aVto your ancestral resting place.
p84
aVUntil the funeral ceremony,
p85
aVwhich can be held years after a person's physical death,
p86
aVthe deceased is referred to as "to makala," a sick person,
p87
aVor "to mama," a person who is asleep,
p88
aVand they continue to be a member of the household.
p89
aVThey are symbolically fed and cared for,
p90
aVand the family at this time
p91
aVwill begin a number of ritual injunctions,
p92
aVwhich communicates to the wider community around them
p93
aVthat one of their members is undergoing the transition
p94
aVfrom this life into the afterlife
p95
aVknown as Puya.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo I know what some of you must be thinking right now.
p98
aVIs she really saying that these people live
p99
aVwith the bodies of their dead relatives?
p100
aVAnd that's exactly what I'm saying.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction
p103
aVwe have to this idea of proximity to bodies,
p104
aVproximity to death,
p105
aVor how this notion just does not fit
p106
aVinto our very biological or medical
p107
aVsort of definition of death,
p108
aVI like to think about what the Torajan way
p109
aVof viewing death encompasses of the human experience
p110
aVthat the medical definition leaves out.
p111
aVI think that Torajans socially recognize
p112
aVand culturally express
p113
aVwhat many of us feel to be true
p114
aVdespite the widespread acceptance
p115
aVof the biomedical definition of death,
p116
aVand that is that our relationships with other humans,
p117
aVtheir impact on our social reality,
p118
aVdoesn't cease with the termination
p119
aVof the physical processes of the body,
p120
aVthat there's a period of transition
p121
aVas the relationship between the living and the dead
p122
aVis transformed but not ended.
p123
aVSo Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship
p124
aVby lavishing love and attention
p125
aVon the most visible symbol of that relationship,
p126
aVthe human body.
p127
aVSo my husband has fond memories
p128
aVof talking to and playing with
p129
aVand generally being around his deceased grandfather,
p130
aVand for him there is nothing unnatural about this.
p131
aVThis is a natural part of the process
p132
aVas the family comes to terms with the transition
p133
aVin their relationship to the deceased,
p134
aVand this is the transition from relating to the deceased
p135
aVas a person who's living
p136
aVto relating to the deceased
p137
aVas a person who's an ancestor.
p138
aVAnd here you can see these wooden effigies
p139
aVof the ancestors,
p140
aVso these are people who have already been buried,
p141
aValready had a funeral ceremony.
p142
aVThese are called tau tau.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo the funeral ceremony itself
p145
aVembodies this relational perspective on death.
p146
aVIt ritualizes the impact of death on families
p147
aVand communities.
p148
aVAnd it's also a moment of self-awareness.
p149
aVIt's a moment when people think about who they are,
p150
aVtheir place in society,
p151
aVand their role in the life cycle
p152
aVin accordance with Torajan cosmology.
p153
aa(lp154
VThere's a saying in Toraja
p155
aVthat all people will become grandparents,
p156
aVand what this means is that after death,
p157
aVwe all become part of the ancestral line
p158
aVthat anchors us between the past and the present
p159
aVand will define who our loved ones are into the future.
p160
aVSo essentially, we all become grandparents
p161
aVto the generations of human children
p162
aVthat come after us.
p163
aVAnd this metaphor of membership
p164
aVin the greater human family
p165
aVis the way that children also describe
p166
aVthe money that they invest
p167
aVin these sacrificial buffaloes
p168
aVthat are thought to carry people's soul
p169
aVfrom here to the afterlife,
p170
aVand children will explain
p171
aVthat they will invest the money in this
p172
aVbecause they want to repay their parents
p173
aVthe debt for all of the years their parents spent
p174
aVinvesting and caring for them.
p175
aa(lp176
VBut the sacrifice of buffalo
p177
aVand the ritual display of wealth
p178
aValso exhibits the status of the deceased,
p179
aVand, by extension, the deceased's family.
p180
aVSo at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed
p181
aVbut also transformed
p182
aVin a ritual drama that highlights
p183
aVthe most salient feature about death in this place:
p184
aVits impact on life and the relationships of the living.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo all of this focus on death
p187
aVdoesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire
p188
aVto the ideal of a long life.
p189
aVThey engage in many practices
p190
aVthought to confer good health
p191
aVand survival to an advanced age.
p192
aVBut they don't put much stock
p193
aVin efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness
p194
aVor in old age.
p195
aVIt's said in Toraja that everybody has
p196
aVsort of a predetermined amount of life.
p197
aVIt's called the sunga'.
p198
aVAnd like a thread, it should be allowed to unspool
p199
aVto its natural end.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo by having death as a part
p202
aVof the cultural and social fabric of life,
p203
aVpeople's everyday decisions about their health
p204
aVand healthcare are affected.
p205
aVThe patriarch of my husband's maternal clan,
p206
aVNenet Katcha,
p207
aVis now approaching the age of 100, as far as we can tell.
p208
aVAnd there are increasing signs
p209
aVthat he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya.
p210
aVAnd his death will be greatly mourned.
p211
aVBut I know that my husband's family
p212
aVlooks forward to the moment
p213
aVwhen they can ritually display
p214
aVwhat his remarkable presence has meant to their lives,
p215
aVwhen they can ritually recount
p216
aVhis life's narrative,
p217
aVweaving his story
p218
aVinto the history of their community.
p219
aVHis story is their story.
p220
aVHis funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves.
p221
aVAnd it's a story that has no discernible beginning,
p222
aVno foreseeable end.
p223
aVIt's a story that goes on
p224
aVlong after his body no longer does.
p225
aa(lp226
VPeople ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed
p227
aVby participating in a culture
p228
aVwhere the physical manifestations of death
p229
aVgreet us at every turn.
p230
aVBut I see something profoundly transformative
p231
aVin experiencing death as a social process
p232
aVand not just a biological one.
p233
aVIn reality, the relationship between the living and the dead
p234
aVhas its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system,
p235
aVwhere decisions about how long to stretch
p236
aVthe thread of life are made based on our emotional
p237
aVand social ties with the people around us,
p238
aVnot just on medicine's ability to prolong life.
p239
aVWe, like the Torajans,
p240
aVbase our decisions about life
p241
aVon the meanings and the definitions
p242
aVthat we ascribe to death.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience
p245
aVshould run out and adopt the traditions
p246
aVof the Torajans.
p247
aVIt might be a little bit difficult
p248
aVto put into play in the United States.
p249
aVBut I want to ask what we can gain
p250
aVfrom seeing physical death not only as a biological process
p251
aVbut as part of the greater human story.
p252
aVWhat would it be like to look on
p253
aVthe expired human form with love
p254
aVbecause it's so intimately a part of who we all are?
p255
aVIf we could expand our definition of death
p256
aVto encompass life,
p257
aVwe could experience death as part of life
p258
aVand perhaps face death
p259
aVwith something other than fear.
p260
aVPerhaps one of the answers to the challenges
p261
aVthat are facing the U.S. healthcare system,
p262
aVparticularly in the end-of-life care,
p263
aVis as simple as a shift in perspective,
p264
aVand the shift in perspective in this case
p265
aVwould be to look at the social life of every death.
p266
aVIt might help us recognize that the way we limit
p267
aVour conversation about death
p268
aVto something that's medical or biological
p269
aVis reflective of a larger culture that we all share
p270
aVof avoiding death, being afraid of talking about it.
p271
aVIf we could entertain and value
p272
aVother kinds of knowledge about life,
p273
aVincluding other definitions of death,
p274
aVit has the potential to change the discussions
p275
aVthat we have about the end of life.
p276
aVIt could change the way that we die,
p277
aVbut more importantly,
p278
aVit could transform the way that we live.

big questions: how do we know who we are, and how does our identity shape interactions with others? As a cultural anthropologist, Swazey has explored these ideas by researching how religion, spirituality and politics define society in Indonesia, where she has lived for more than 10 years. Swazey is currently a lecturer at the Center for Cross-Cultural and Religious Studies at Gadjah Mada University.</p>  <p>In her research, Swazey has looked at Christian-Muslim relations in North Sulawesi, documented Indonesian church services in New England and taken an interest in the funeral practices in Tana Toraja, located in eastern Indonesia. Her husband is an ethnic Torajan, and Swazey found herself fascinated by his stories of playing with his grandfather long after he was dead. Examinging the way Torajans make death a unique part of village life has deeply influenced her own thoughts on the end of life, she says. This is why she loves anthropology: because thinking about human difference has the power to teach us about ourselves.</p>  <p>Swazey has also embarked on an unusual cultural tour of Indonesia: she is learning to sing a song from every province.</p>", "slug": "kelli_swazey", "whotheyare": "Kelli Swazey examines how religious and spiritual practices form group identity, and play a vital role in structuring the interactions of individuals within a culture.

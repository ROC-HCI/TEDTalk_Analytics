VOpenness. It's a word that
p5
aVdenotes opportunity and possibilities.
p6
aVOpen-ended, open hearth,
p7
aVopen source, open door policy,
p8
aVopen bar. (Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd everywhere the world is opening up,
p11
aVand it's a good thing.
p12
aa(lp13
VWhy is this happening?
p14
aVThe technology revolution is opening the world.
p15
aa(lp16
VYesterday's Internet was a platform
p17
aVfor the presentation of content.
p18
aVThe Internet of today is a platform for computation.
p19
aVThe Internet is becoming a giant
p20
aVglobal computer, and every time you go on it,
p21
aVyou upload a video, you do a Google search,
p22
aVyou remix something,
p23
aVyou're programming this big global computer
p24
aVthat we all share.
p25
aVHumanity is building a machine,
p26
aVand this enables us to collaborate in new ways.
p27
aVCollaboration can occur on
p28
aVan astronomical basis.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow a new generation is opening up the world as well.
p31
aVI started studying kids about 15 years ago,
p32
aV\u2014 so actually 20 years ago now \u2014
p33
aVand I noticed how my own children were
p34
aVeffortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology,
p35
aVand at first I thought,
p36
aV"My children are prodigies!" (Laughter)
p37
aVBut then I noticed all their friends were like them,
p38
aVso that was a bad theory.
p39
aVSo I've started working with a few hundred kids,
p40
aVand I came to the conclusion
p41
aVthat this is the first generation to come of age
p42
aVin the digital age,
p43
aVto be bathed in bits.
p44
aVI call them the Net Generation.
p45
aVI said, these kids are different.
p46
aVThey have no fear of technology, because it's not there.
p47
aVIt's like the air.
p48
aVIt's sort of like, I have no fear of a refrigerator.
p49
aVAnd \u2014 (Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd there's no more powerful force to change
p52
aVevery institution than the first generation of digital natives.
p53
aVI'm a digital immigrant.
p54
aVI had to learn the language.
p55
aa(lp56
VThe global economic crisis is opening up the world as well.
p57
aVOur opaque institutions from the Industrial Age,
p58
aVeverything from old models of the corporation,
p59
aVgovernment, media, Wall Street,
p60
aVare in various stages of being stalled or frozen
p61
aVor in atrophy or even failing,
p62
aVand this is now creating a burning platform in the world.
p63
aVI mean, think about Wall Street.
p64
aVThe core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down
p65
aVglobal capitalism.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, you know the idea of a burning platform,
p68
aVthat you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are
p69
aVbecome greater than the costs of moving to something different,
p70
aVperhaps something radically different.
p71
aVAnd we need to change
p72
aVand open up all of our institutions.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo this technology push,
p75
aVa demographic kick from a new generation
p76
aVand a demand pull from a new
p77
aVeconomic global environment
p78
aVis causing the world to open up.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, I think, in fact,
p81
aVwe're at a turning point in human history,
p82
aVwhere we can finally now rebuild
p83
aVmany of the institutions of the Industrial Age
p84
aVaround a new set of principles.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, what is openness?
p87
aVWell, as it turns out, openness
p88
aVhas a number of different meanings,
p89
aVand for each there's a corresponding principle
p90
aVfor the transformation of
p91
aVcivilization.
p92
aVThe first is collaboration.
p93
aVNow, this is openness in the sense of the boundaries
p94
aVof organizations becoming more porous and fluid
p95
aVand open.
p96
aa(lp97
VThe guy in the picture here,
p98
aVI'll tell you his story.
p99
aVHis name is Rob McEwen.
p100
aVI'd like to say, "I have this think tank, we scour the world
p101
aVfor amazing case studies."
p102
aVThe reason I know this story
p103
aVis because he's my neighbor. (Laughter)
p104
aVHe actually moved across the street from us,
p105
aVand he held a cocktail party
p106
aVto meet the neighbors, and he says, "You're Don Tapscott.
p107
aVI've read some of your books."
p108
aVI said, "Great. What do you do?"
p109
aVAnd he says, "Well I used to be a banker
p110
aVand now I'm a gold miner."
p111
aVAnd he tells me this amazing story.
p112
aVHe takes over this gold mine, and his geologists
p113
aVcan't tell him where the gold is.
p114
aVHe gives them more money for geological data,
p115
aVthey come back, they can't tell
p116
aVhim where to go into production.
p117
aVAfter a few years, he's so frustrated he's ready
p118
aVto give up, but he has an epiphany one day.
p119
aVHe wonders, "If my geologists don't know where the gold is,
p120
aVmaybe somebody else does."
p121
aVSo he does a "radical" thing.
p122
aVHe takes his geological data,
p123
aVhe publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet
p124
aVcalled the Goldcorp Challenge.
p125
aVIt's basically half a million dollars in prize money
p126
aVfor anybody who can tell me, do I have any gold,
p127
aVand if so, where is it? (Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VHe gets submissions from all around the world.
p130
aVThey use techniques that he's never heard of,
p131
aVand for his half a million dollars in prize money,
p132
aVRob McEwen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold.
p133
aVThe market value of his company
p134
aVgoes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars,
p135
aVand I can tell you, because he's my neighbor,
p136
aVhe's a happy camper. (Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VYou know, conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right?
p139
aVYour most precious asset goes out the elevator every night.
p140
aVHe viewed talent differently.
p141
aVHe wondered, who are their peers?
p142
aVHe should have fired his geology department, but he didn't.
p143
aVYou know, some of the best submissions
p144
aVdidn't come from geologists.
p145
aVThey came from computer scientists, engineers.
p146
aVThe winner was a computer graphics company
p147
aVthat built a three dimensional model of the mine
p148
aVwhere you can helicopter underground
p149
aVand see where the gold is.
p150
aa(lp151
VHe helped us understand that social media's becoming
p152
aVsocial production.
p153
aVIt's not about hooking up online.
p154
aVThis is a new means of production in the making.
p155
aVAnd this Ideagora that he created, an open market, agora,
p156
aVfor uniquely qualified minds,
p157
aVwas part of a change, a profound change in the deep structure
p158
aVand architecture of our organizations,
p159
aVand how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate,
p160
aVto create goods and services,
p161
aVto engage with the rest of the world,
p162
aVin terms of government, how we create public value.
p163
aVOpenness is about collaboration.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow secondly, openness is about transparency.
p166
aVThis is different. Here, we're talking about the communication
p167
aVof pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations:
p168
aVemployees, customers, business partners, shareholders,
p169
aVand so on.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd everywhere, our institutions are becoming naked.
p172
aVPeople are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks,
p173
aVbut that's just the tip of the iceberg.
p174
aVYou see, people at their fingertips now, everybody,
p175
aVnot just Julian Assange,
p176
aVhave these powerful tools for finding out what's going on,
p177
aVscrutinizing, informing others,
p178
aVand even organizing collective responses.
p179
aVInstitutions are becoming naked,
p180
aa(lp181
Vand if you're going to be naked,
p182
aVwell, there's some corollaries that flow from that.
p183
aVI mean, one is,
p184
aVfitness is no longer optional. (Laughter)
p185
aVYou know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, by buff I mean, you need to have good value,
p188
aVbecause value is evidenced like never before.
p189
aVYou say you have good products.
p190
aVThey'd better be good.
p191
aVBut you also need to have values.
p192
aVYou need to have integrity as part of your bones
p193
aVand your DNA as an organization,
p194
aVbecause if you don't, you'll be unable to build trust,
p195
aVand trust is a sine qua non of this new network world.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo this is good. It's not bad.
p198
aVSunlight is the best disinfectant.
p199
aVAnd we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world.
p200
aa(lp201
VNow, the third meaning and corresponding principle
p202
aVof openness is about sharing.
p203
aVNow this is different than transparency.
p204
aVTransparency is about the communication of information.
p205
aVSharing is about giving up assets, intellectual property.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd there are all kinds of famous stories about this.
p208
aVIBM gave away 400 million dollars of software
p209
aVto the Linux movement, and that gave them
p210
aVa multi-billion dollar payoff.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, conventional wisdom says,
p213
aV"Well, hey, our intellectual property belongs to us,
p214
aVand if someone tries to infringe it, we're going to get out
p215
aVour lawyers and we're going to sue them."
p216
aVWell, it didn't work so well for the record labels, did it?
p217
aVI mean, they took \u2014 They had a technology disruption,
p218
aVand rather than taking a business model innovation
p219
aVto correspond to that, they took and sought a legal solution
p220
aVand the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles
p221
aVis now suing children
p222
aVand is in danger of collapse.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo we need to think differently about intellectual property.
p225
aa(lp226
VI'll give you an example.
p227
aVThe pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble.
p228
aVFirst of all, there aren't a lot of big inventions
p229
aVin the pipeline, and this is a big problem for human health,
p230
aVand the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem,
p231
aVthat they're about to fall off something
p232
aVcalled the patent cliff.
p233
aVDo you know about this?
p234
aVThey're going to lose 20 to 35 percent of their revenue
p235
aVin the next 12 months.
p236
aVAnd what are you going to do,
p237
aVlike, cut back on paper clips or something? No.
p238
aa(lp239
VWe need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research.
p240
aVThe pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets
p241
aVin a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research.
p242
aVThey need to start sharing
p243
aVclinical trial data,
p244
aVand in doing so, create a rising tide that could lift all boats,
p245
aVnot just for the industry but
p246
aVfor humanity.
p247
aa(lp248
VNow, the fourth meaning
p249
aVof openness,
p250
aVand corresponding principle, is about empowerment.
p251
aVAnd I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here.
p252
aVKnowledge and intelligence is power,
p253
aVand as it becomes more distributed, there's a
p254
aVconcomitant distribution
p255
aVand decentralization and disaggregation of power
p256
aVthat's underway in the world today.
p257
aVThe open world is bringing freedom.
p258
aa(lp259
VNow, take the Arab Spring.
p260
aVThe debate about the role of social media
p261
aVand social change has been settled.
p262
aVYou know, one word: Tunisia.
p263
aVAnd then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too.
p264
aVBut in the Tunisian revolution,
p265
aVthe new media didn't cause the revolution;
p266
aVit was caused by injustice.
p267
aVSocial media didn't create the revolution;
p268
aVit was created by a new generation of young people
p269
aVwho wanted jobs and hope and
p270
aVwho didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore.
p271
aa(lp272
VBut just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration
p273
aVcosts in business and government,
p274
aVit also drops the cost of dissent, of rebellion,
p275
aVand even insurrection
p276
aVin ways that people didn't understand.
p277
aa(lp278
VYou know, during the Tunisian revolution,
p279
aVsnipers associated with the regime were killing
p280
aVunarmed students in the street.
p281
aVSo the students would take their mobile devices,
p282
aVtake a picture, triangulate the location,
p283
aVsend that picture to friendly military units,
p284
aVwho'd come in and take out the snipers.
p285
aVYou think that social media is about hooking up online?
p286
aVFor these kids, it was a military tool
p287
aVto defend unarmed people from murderers.
p288
aVIt was a tool of self-defense.
p289
aa(lp290
VYou know, as we speak today, young people
p291
aVare being killed in Syria,
p292
aVand up until three months ago,
p293
aVif you were injured on the street,
p294
aVan ambulance would pick you up,
p295
aVtake you to the hospital, you'd go in, say, with a broken leg,
p296
aVand you'd come out with a bullet in your head.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo these 20-somethings created
p299
aVan alternative health care system,
p300
aVwhere what they did is they used Twitter and basic
p301
aVpublicly available tools that when someone's injured,
p302
aVa car would show up, it would pick them up,
p303
aVtake them to a makeshift medical clinic, where you'd get
p304
aVmedical treatment, as opposed to being executed.
p305
aVSo this is a time of great change.
p306
aa(lp307
VNow, it's not without its problems.
p308
aVUp until two years ago,
p309
aVall revolutions in human history had a leadership,
p310
aVand when the old regime fell, the leadership
p311
aVand the organization would take power.
p312
aVWell, these wiki revolutions happen so fast
p313
aVthey create a vacuum, and
p314
aVpolitics abhors a vacuum,
p315
aVand unsavory forces can fill that,
p316
aVtypically the old regime,
p317
aVor extremists, or fundamentalist forces.
p318
aVYou can see this playing out today in Egypt.
p319
aa(lp320
VBut that doesn't matter,
p321
aVbecause this is moving forward.
p322
aVThe train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag.
p323
aVThe horse is out of the barn. Help me out here, okay?
p324
aV(Laughter) The toothpaste is out of the tube.
p325
aVI mean, we're not putting this one back.
p326
aVThe open world is bringing empowerment and freedom.
p327
aa(lp328
VI think, at the end of these four days,
p329
aVthat you'll come to conclude that the arc of history
p330
aVis a positive one, and it's towards openness.
p331
aa(lp332
VIf you go back a few hundred years,
p333
aVall around the world it was a very closed society.
p334
aVIt was agrarian, and the means of production
p335
aVand political system was called feudalism, and knowledge
p336
aVwas concentrated in the church and the nobility.
p337
aVPeople didn't know about things.
p338
aVThere was no concept of progress.
p339
aVYou were born, you lived your life and you died.
p340
aa(lp341
VBut then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention,
p342
aVand, over time, the society opened up.
p343
aVPeople started to learn about things, and when they did,
p344
aVthe institutions of feudal society appeared
p345
aVto be stalled, or frozen, or failing.
p346
aVIt didn't make sense for the church to be responsible
p347
aVfor medicine when people had knowledge.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo we saw the Protestant Reformation.
p350
aVMartin Luther called the printing press
p351
aV"God's highest act of grace."
p352
aVThe creation of a corporation, science, the university,
p353
aVeventually the Industrial Revolution,
p354
aVand it was all good.
p355
aa(lp356
VBut it came with a cost.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd now, once again, the technology genie
p359
aVis out of the bottle, but this time it's different.
p360
aVThe printing press gave us access to the written word.
p361
aVThe Internet enables each of us to be a producer.
p362
aVThe printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge.
p363
aVThe Internet gives us access,
p364
aVnot just to information and knowledge, but
p365
aVto the intelligence contained in the crania of other people
p366
aVon a global basis.
p367
aa(lp368
VTo me, this is not an information age,
p369
aVit's an age of networked intelligence.
p370
aVIt's an age of vast promise,
p371
aVan age of collaboration,
p372
aVwhere the boundaries of our organizations are changing,
p373
aVof transparency, where sunlight
p374
aVis disinfecting civilization,
p375
aVan age of sharing and understanding
p376
aVthe new power of the commons,
p377
aVand it's an age of empowerment
p378
aVand of freedom.
p379
aa(lp380
VNow, what I'd like to do is,
p381
aVto close, to share with you
p382
aVsome research that I've been doing.
p383
aVI've tried to study all kinds of organizations
p384
aVto understand what the future might look like,
p385
aVbut I've been studying nature recently.
p386
aa(lp387
VYou know, bees come in swarms
p388
aVand fish come in schools.
p389
aVStarlings, in the area around Edinburgh,
p390
aVin the moors of England,
p391
aVcome in something called a murmuration,
p392
aVand the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings
p393
aVof the birds, and throughout the day the starlings
p394
aVare out over a 20-mile radius
p395
aVsort of doing their starling thing.
p396
aVAnd at night they come together
p397
aVand they create one of the most spectacular things
p398
aVin all of nature,
p399
aVand it's called a murmuration.
p400
aVAnd scientists that have studied this have said
p401
aVthey've never seen an accident.
p402
aVNow, this thing has a function.
p403
aVIt protects the birds.
p404
aVYou can see on the right here,
p405
aVthere's a predator being chased away by the collective power
p406
aVof the birds, and apparently this is a frightening thing
p407
aVif you're a predator of starlings.
p408
aVAnd there's leadership,
p409
aVbut there's no one leader.
p410
aa(lp411
VNow, is this some kind of fanciful analogy,
p412
aVor could we actually learn something from this?
p413
aVWell, the murmuration functions to record
p414
aVa number of principles,
p415
aVand they're basically the principles that
p416
aVI have described to you today.
p417
aVThis is a huge collaboration.
p418
aVIt's an openness, it's a sharing
p419
aVof all kinds of information, not just about location
p420
aVand trajectory and danger and so on, but about food sources.
p421
aVAnd there's a real sense of interdependence,
p422
aVthat the individual birds somehow understand
p423
aVthat their interests are in the interest of the collective.
p424
aa(lp425
VPerhaps like we should understand
p426
aVthat business can't succeed
p427
aVin a world that's failing.
p428
aa(lp429
VWell, I look at this thing,
p430
aVand I get a lot of hope.
p431
aVThink about the kids today in the Arab Spring, and
p432
aVyou see something like this that's underway.
p433
aa(lp434
VAnd imagine, just consider this idea, if you would:
p435
aVWhat if we could connect ourselves in this world
p436
aVthrough a vast network of air and glass?
p437
aVCould we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge?
p438
aVCould we start to share our intelligence?
p439
aVCould we create some kind of
p440
aVcollective intelligence
p441
aVthat goes beyond an individual or a group or a team
p442
aVto create, perhaps, some kind of consciousness
p443
aVon a global basis?
p444
aVWell, if we could do this, we could attack some big problems in the world.
p445
aa(lp446
VAnd I look at this thing,
p447
aVand, I don't know, I get a lot of hope that maybe this
p448
aVsmaller, networked, open world
p449
aVthat our kids inherit might be a better one, and that
p450
aVthis new age of networked intelligence could be
p451
aVan age of promise fulfilled
p452
aVand of peril unrequited.
p453
aa(lp454
VLet's do this. Thank you.

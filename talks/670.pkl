VOn the 30th of May, 1832,
p5
aVa gunshot was heard
p6
aVringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris.
p7
aV(Gunshot)
p8
aVA peasant, who was walking to market that morning,
p9
aVran towards where the gunshot had come from,
p10
aVand found a young man writhing in agony on the floor,
p11
aVclearly shot by a dueling wound.
p12
aVThe young man's name was Evariste Galois.
p13
aVHe was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.
p14
aVGalois was taken to the local hospital
p15
aVwhere he died the next day in the arms of his brother.
p16
aVAnd the last words he said to his brother were,
p17
aV"Don't cry for me, Alfred.
p18
aVI need all the courage I can muster
p19
aVto die at the age of 20."
p20
aa(lp21
VIt wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics
p22
aVfor which Galois was famous.
p23
aVBut a few years earlier, while still at school,
p24
aVhe'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical
p25
aVproblems at the time.
p26
aVAnd he wrote to the academicians in Paris,
p27
aVtrying to explain his theory.
p28
aVBut the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVThis is how he wrote most of his mathematics.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo, the night before that duel, he realized
p33
aVthis possibly is his last chance
p34
aVto try and explain his great breakthrough.
p35
aVSo he stayed up the whole night, writing away,
p36
aVtrying to explain his ideas.
p37
aVAnd as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny,
p38
aVhe left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.
p39
aVMaybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics
p40
aVwas the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut contained inside those documents
p43
aVwas a new language, a language to understand
p44
aVone of the most fundamental concepts
p45
aVof science \u2014 namely symmetry.
p46
aVNow, symmetry is almost nature's language.
p47
aVIt helps us to understand so many
p48
aVdifferent bits of the scientific world.
p49
aVFor example, molecular structure.
p50
aVWhat crystals are possible,
p51
aVwe can understand through the mathematics of symmetry.
p52
aa(lp53
VIn microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object,
p54
aVbecause they are generally rather nasty.
p55
aVThe swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.
p56
aVAnd it uses the efficiency of symmetry
p57
aVto be able to propagate itself so well.
p58
aVBut on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important,
p59
aVbecause it actually communicates genetic information.
p60
aa(lp61
VI've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical.
p62
aVAnd if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful,
p63
aVyou're probably drawn to the lower two.
p64
aVBecause it is hard to make symmetry.
p65
aVAnd if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign
p66
aVthat you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing
p67
aVand therefore you'll make a good mate.
p68
aVSo symmetry is a language which can help to communicate
p69
aVgenetic information.
p70
aa(lp71
VSymmetry can also help us to explain
p72
aVwhat's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
p73
aVOr what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
p74
aVTo be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles
p75
aVwe might see there,
p76
aVit seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape
p77
aVin a higher dimensional space.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd I think Galileo summed up, very nicely,
p80
aVthe power of mathematics
p81
aVto understand the scientific world around us.
p82
aVHe wrote, "The universe cannot be read
p83
aVuntil we have learnt the language
p84
aVand become familiar with the characters in which it is written.
p85
aVIt is written in mathematical language,
p86
aVand the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures,
p87
aVwithout which means it is humanly impossible
p88
aVto comprehend a single word."
p89
aa(lp90
VBut it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry.
p91
aVArtists too love to play around with symmetry.
p92
aVThey also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.
p93
aVHere is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain."
p94
aVHe has a character describing the snowflake,
p95
aVand he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision,
p96
aVfound it deathly, the very marrow of death."
p97
aa(lp98
VBut what artists like to do is to set up expectations
p99
aVof symmetry and then break them.
p100
aVAnd a beautiful example of this
p101
aVI found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine
p102
aVin Japan, Professor Kurokawa.
p103
aVAnd he took me up to the temples in Nikko.
p104
aVAnd just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.
p105
aVAnd the gateway you see behind
p106
aVhas eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them.
p107
aVSeven of them are exactly the same,
p108
aVand the eighth one is turned upside down.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd I said to Professor Kurokawa,
p111
aV"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves
p112
aVwhen they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down."
p113
aVAnd he said, "No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act."
p114
aVAnd he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese
p115
aV"Essays in Idleness" from the 14th century,
p116
aVin which the essayist wrote, "In everything,
p117
aVuniformity is undesirable.
p118
aVLeaving something incomplete makes it interesting,
p119
aVand gives one the feeling that there is room for growth."
p120
aVEven when building the Imperial Palace,
p121
aVthey always leave one place unfinished.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut if I had to choose one building in the world
p124
aVto be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life,
p125
aVbeing an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada.
p126
aVThis is a palace celebrating symmetry.
p127
aVRecently I took my family \u2014
p128
aVwe do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love.
p129
aVThis is my son Tamer. You can see
p130
aVhe's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra.
p131
aVBut I wanted to try and enrich him.
p132
aVI think one of the problems about school mathematics
p133
aVis it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded
p134
aVin the world we live in.
p135
aVSo, I wanted to open his eyes up to
p136
aVhow much symmetry is running through the Alhambra.
p137
aa(lp138
VYou see it already. Immediately you go in,
p139
aVthe reflective symmetry in the water.
p140
aVBut it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.
p141
aVThe Moorish artists were denied the possibility
p142
aVto draw things with souls.
p143
aVSo they explored a more geometric art.
p144
aVAnd so what is symmetry?
p145
aVThe Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions.
p146
aVWhat is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls,
p147
aVdo they have the same symmetries?
p148
aVCan we say whether they discovered
p149
aVall of the symmetries in the Alhambra?
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd it was Galois who produced a language
p152
aVto be able to answer some of these questions.
p153
aVFor Galois, symmetry \u2014 unlike for Thomas Mann,
p154
aVwhich was something still and deathly \u2014
p155
aVfor Galois, symmetry was all about motion.
p156
aVWhat can you do to a symmetrical object,
p157
aVmove it in some way, so it looks the same
p158
aVas before you moved it?
p159
aVI like to describe it as the magic trick moves.
p160
aVWhat can you do to something? You close your eyes.
p161
aVI do something, put it back down again.
p162
aVIt looks like it did before it started.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo, for example, the walls in the Alhambra \u2014
p165
aVI can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place,
p166
aVrotate them by 90 degrees,
p167
aVput them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there.
p168
aVAnd if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved.
p169
aVBut it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry
p170
aVinside the Alhambra.
p171
aVBut it's also about producing a language to describe this.
p172
aVAnd the power of mathematics is often
p173
aVto change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically \u2014
p176
aVso brace yourselves \u2014
p177
aVpush you a little bit to understand how this language works,
p178
aVwhich enables us to capture what is symmetry.
p179
aVSo, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.
p180
aVLet's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.
p181
aVWhat can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?
p182
aVWell, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn,
p183
aVand still it looks like it did before I started.
p184
aVI could rotate it by a third of a turn,
p185
aVor a half a turn,
p186
aVor put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.
p187
aVAnd a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.
p188
aVAnd those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object
p189
aVthat make it look like it did before I started.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.
p192
aVCan anybody think what else I could do to this
p193
aVwhich would leave it like I did before I started?
p194
aVI can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?
p195
aVIt's got no reflective symmetry.
p196
aVBut what I could do is just leave it where it is,
p197
aVpick it up, and put it down again.
p198
aVAnd for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry.
p199
aVActually, the invention of the number zero
p200
aVwas a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians.
p201
aVIt seems mad to talk about nothing.
p202
aVAnd this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical \u2014
p203
aVso everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo, this object has six symmetries.
p206
aVAnd what about the triangle?
p207
aVWell, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise
p208
aVor a third of a turn anticlockwise.
p209
aVBut now this has some reflectional symmetry.
p210
aVI can reflect it in the line through X,
p211
aVor the line through Y,
p212
aVor the line through Z.
p213
aVFive symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry
p214
aVwhere I just pick it up and leave it where it is.
p215
aVSo both of these objects have six symmetries.
p216
aVNow, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport,
p217
aVand you have to do some mathematics
p218
aVin order to really understand it.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo here is a little question for you.
p221
aVAnd I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk
p222
aVfor the person who gets closest to the answer.
p223
aVThe Rubik's Cube.
p224
aVHow many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?
p225
aVHow many things can I do to this object
p226
aVand put it down so it still looks like a cube?
p227
aVOkay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on,
p228
aVand count how many symmetries there are.
p229
aVAnd there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects.
p232
aVWhat Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries,
p233
aVbut how they interact with each other
p234
aVwhich really characterizes the symmetry of an object.
p235
aVIf I do one magic trick move followed by another,
p236
aVthe combination is a third magic trick move.
p237
aVAnd here we see Galois starting to develop
p238
aVa language to see the substance
p239
aVof the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea
p240
aVof the symmetry underlying this physical object.
p241
aVFor example, what if I turn the starfish
p242
aVby a sixth of a turn,
p243
aVand then a third of a turn?
p244
aa(lp245
VSo I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F,
p246
aVare the names for the rotations.
p247
aVB, for example, rotates the little yellow dot
p248
aVto the B on the starfish. And so on.
p249
aVSo what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn,
p250
aVfollowed by C, which is a third of a turn?
p251
aVWell let's do that. A sixth of a turn,
p252
aVfollowed by a third of a turn,
p253
aVthe combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.
p254
aVSo the little table here records
p255
aVhow the algebra of these symmetries work.
p256
aVI do one followed by another, the answer is
p257
aVit's rotation D, half a turn.
p258
aVWhat I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?
p259
aVLet's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn.
p260
aVOf course, it doesn't make any difference.
p261
aVIt still ends up at half a turn.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other.
p264
aVBut this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.
p265
aVLet's see what happens if we do two symmetries
p266
aVwith the triangle, one after the other.
p267
aVLet's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise,
p268
aVand reflect in the line through X.
p269
aVWell, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z
p270
aVto start with.
p271
aVNow, let's do it in a different order.
p272
aVLet's do the reflection in X first,
p273
aVfollowed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.
p274
aVThe combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.
p275
aVIt's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow it matters what order you do the operations in.
p278
aVAnd this enables us to distinguish
p279
aVwhy the symmetries of these objects \u2014
p280
aVthey both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say
p281
aVthey have the same symmetries?
p282
aVBut the way the symmetries interact
p283
aVenable us \u2014 we've now got a language
p284
aVto distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.
p285
aVAnd you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.
p286
aVTake a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn,
p287
aVthen flip it. And then do it in the other order,
p288
aVand the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow, Galois produced some laws for how these tables \u2014 how symmetries interact.
p291
aVIt's almost like little Sudoku tables.
p292
aVYou don't see any symmetry twice
p293
aVin any row or column.
p294
aVAnd, using those rules, he was able to say
p295
aVthat there are in fact only two objects
p296
aVwith six symmetries.
p297
aVAnd they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle,
p298
aVor the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish.
p299
aVI think this is an amazing development.
p300
aVIt's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.
p301
aVIn the front here, I've got one, two, three people
p302
aVsitting on one, two, three chairs.
p303
aVThe people and the chairs are very different,
p304
aVbut the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra.
p307
aVHere are two very different walls,
p308
aVvery different geometric pictures.
p309
aVBut, using the language of Galois,
p310
aVwe can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things
p311
aVare actually the same.
p312
aVFor example, let's take this beautiful wall
p313
aVwith the triangles with a little twist on them.
p314
aVYou can rotate them by a sixth of a turn
p315
aVif you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors.
p316
aVBut the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn
p317
aVaround the point where all the triangles meet.
p318
aVWhat about the center of a triangle? I can rotate
p319
aVby a third of a turn around the center of the triangle,
p320
aVand everything matches up.
p321
aVAnd then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge,
p322
aVwhere I can rotate by 180 degrees.
p323
aVAnd all the tiles match up again.
p324
aVSo rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra.
p327
aVAnd we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction.
p328
aVSo, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet.
p329
aVAnd the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.
p330
aVAnd although these walls look very different,
p331
aVGalois has produced a language to say
p332
aVthat in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.
p333
aVAnd it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.
p334
aa(lp335
VHere is another example in the Alhambra.
p336
aVThis is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.
p337
aVThey all look very different. But this language allows us to say
p338
aVthat they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object,
p339
aVwhich we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football,
p340
aVbut because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate
p341
aVby a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.
p342
aa(lp343
VNow, this power of the language is even more,
p344
aVbecause Galois can say,
p345
aV"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries
p346
aVon the walls in the Alhambra?"
p347
aVAnd it turns out they almost did.
p348
aVYou can prove, using Galois' language,
p349
aVthere are actually only 17
p350
aVdifferent symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.
p351
aVAnd they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one,
p352
aVit will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.
p353
aa(lp354
VBut these are things that we can see.
p355
aVAnd the power of Galois' mathematical language
p356
aVis it also allows us to create
p357
aVsymmetrical objects in the unseen world,
p358
aVbeyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional,
p359
aVall the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space.
p360
aVAnd that's where I work. I create
p361
aVmathematical objects, symmetrical objects,
p362
aVusing Galois' language,
p363
aVin very high dimensional spaces.
p364
aVSo I think it's a great example of things unseen,
p365
aVwhich the power of mathematical language allows you to create.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo, like Galois, I stayed up all last night
p368
aVcreating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you,
p369
aVand I've got a picture of it here.
p370
aVWell, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board
p371
aVat the side here, great, excellent.
p372
aVHere we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you
p373
aVa picture of this symmetrical object.
p374
aVBut here is the language which describes
p375
aVhow the symmetries interact.
p376
aa(lp377
VNow, this new symmetrical object
p378
aVdoes not have a name yet.
p379
aVNow, people like getting their names on things,
p380
aVon craters on the moon
p381
aVor new species of animals.
p382
aVSo I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object
p383
aVwhich hasn't been named before.
p384
aVAnd this thing \u2014 species die away,
p385
aVand moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode \u2014
p386
aVbut this mathematical object will live forever.
p387
aVIt will make you immortal.
p388
aVIn order to win this symmetrical object,
p389
aVwhat you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.
p390
aVHow many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?
p391
aa(lp392
VOkay, I'm going to sort you out.
p393
aVRather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are
p394
aVin that number. Okay?
p395
aVIf you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials.
p396
aVOkay, now if you want to play,
p397
aVI want you to stand up, okay?
p398
aVIf you think you've got an estimate for how many digits,
p399
aVright \u2014 we've already got one competitor here.
p400
aVIf you all stay down he wins it automatically.
p401
aVOkay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six.
p402
aVGreat. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.
p403
aa(lp404
VAnybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down,
p405
aVbecause you've underestimated.
p406
aVFive or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.
p407
aV60 digits or more, you've got to sit down.
p408
aVYou've overestimated.
p409
aV20 digits or less, sit down.
p410
aVHow many digits are there in your number?
p411
aVTwo? So you should have sat down earlier.
p412
aV(Laughter)
p413
aVLet's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay?
p414
aVIf I told you 20 or less, stand up.
p415
aVBecause this one. I think there were a few here.
p416
aVThe people who just last sat down.
p417
aa(lp418
VOkay, how many digits do you have in your number?
p419
aV(Laughs)
p420
aV21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours?
p421
aV18. So it goes to this lady here.
p422
aV21 is the closest.
p423
aVIt actually has \u2014 the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube
p424
aVhas 25 digits.
p425
aVSo now I need to name this object.
p426
aVSo, what is your name?
p427
aVI need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally \u2014
p428

aVNo, SO2 has already been used, actually,

aVSo Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object.

aVYou are now immortal.

VAnd if you'd like your own symmetrical object,
p437
aVI have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala,
p438
aVwhere I will stay up all night and devise an object for you,
p439
aVfor a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala.
p440
aVAnd I think what drives me, as a mathematician,
p441
aVare those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered.
p442
aVIt's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject.
p443
aVAnd I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese "Essays in Idleness":

aV"In everything, uniformity is undesirable.

aVLeaving something incomplete makes it interesting,

aVand gives one the feeling that there is room for growth." Thank you.

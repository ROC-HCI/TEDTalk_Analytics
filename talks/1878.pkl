VSo yesterday, I was out in the street
p5
aVin front of this building,
p6
aVand I was walking down the sidewalk,
p7
aVand I had company, several of us,
p8
aVand we were all abiding by the rules
p9
aVof walking down sidewalks.
p10
aVWe're not talking each other. We're facing forward.
p11
aVWe're moving.
p12
aVWhen the person in front of me slows down.
p13
aVAnd so I'm watching him, and he slows down,
p14
aVand finally he stops.
p15
aVWell, that wasn't fast enough for me,
p16
aVso I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him,
p17
aVand as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing,
p18
aVand he was doing this.
p19
aVHe was texting,
p20
aVand he couldn't text and walk at the same time.
p21
aVNow we could approach this
p22
aVfrom a working memory perspective
p23
aVor from a multitasking perspective.
p24
aVWe're going to do working memory today.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, working memory
p27
aVis that part of our consciousness that we are
p28
aVaware of at any given time of day.
p29
aVYou're going it right now.
p30
aVIt's not something we can turn off.
p31
aVIf you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?
p32
aVSo right now, you're doing just fine.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow working memory has four basic components.
p35
aVIt allows us to store some immediate experiences
p36
aVand a little bit of knowledge.
p37
aVIt allows us to reach back into our long-term memory
p38
aVand pull some of that in as we need it,
p39
aVmixes it, processes it
p40
aVin light of whatever our current goal is.
p41
aVNow the current goal isn't something like,
p42
aVI want to be president or the best surfer in the world.
p43
aVIt's more mundane. I'd like that cookie,
p44
aVor I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.
p45
aVNow working memory capacity
p46
aVis our ability to leverage that,
p47
aVour ability to take what we know
p48
aVand what we can hang onto
p49
aVand leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy
p50
aVour current goal.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow working memory capacity
p53
aVhas a fairly long history,
p54
aVand it's associated with a lot of positive effects.
p55
aVPeople with high working memory capacity
p56
aVtend to be good storytellers.
p57
aVThey tend to solve and do well on standardized tests,
p58
aVhowever important that is.
p59
aVThey're able to have high levels of writing ability.
p60
aVThey're also able to reason at high levels.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that.
p63
aVSo I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks,
p64
aVand we're going to take your  working memory out for a ride.
p65
aVYou up for that? Okay.
p66
aa(lp67
VI'm going to give you five words,
p68
aVand I just want you to hang on to them.
p69
aVDon't write them down. Just hang on to them.
p70
aVFive words.
p71
aVWhile you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions.
p72
aVI want to see what happens with those words.
p73
aVSo here's the words:
p74
aVtree,
p75
aVhighway,
p76
aVmirror,
p77
aVSaturn
p78
aVand electrode.
p79
aVSo far so good?
p80
aVOkay. What I want you to do
p81
aVis I want you to tell me what the answer is
p82
aVto 23 times eight.
p83
aVJust shout it out.
p84
aV(Mumbling) (Laughter)
p85
aVIn fact it's \u2014 (Mumbling) \u2014 exactly. (Laughter)
p86
aVAll right. I want you to take out your left hand
p87
aVand I want you to go, "One, two, three, four, five,
p88
aVsix, seven, eight, nine, 10."
p89
aVIt's a neurological test, just in case you were wondering.
p90
aVAll right, now what I want you to do
p91
aVis to recite the last five letters
p92
aVof the English alphabet backwards.
p93
aVYou should have started with Z.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VAll right. How many people here are still pretty sure
p97
aVyou've got all five words?
p98
aVOkay. Typically we end up with about less than half,
p99
aVright, which is normal. There will be a range.
p100
aVSome people can hang on to five.
p101
aVSome people can hang on to 10.
p102
aVSome will be down to two or three.
p103
aa(lp104
VWhat we know is this is really important to the way we function, right?
p105
aVAnd it's going to be really important here at TED
p106
aVbecause you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow the problem that we have
p109
aVis that life comes at us,
p110
aVand it comes at us very quickly,
p111
aVand what we need to do is to take that amorphous
p112
aVflow of experience and somehow
p113
aVextract meaning from it
p114
aVwith a working memory
p115
aVthat's about the size of a pea.
p116
aVNow don't get me wrong, working memory is awesome.
p117
aVWorking memory allows us
p118
aVto investigate our current experience
p119
aVas we move forward.
p120
aVIt allows us to make sense of the world around us.
p121
aVBut it does have certain limits.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow working memory is great for allowing us to communicate.
p124
aVWe can have a conversation,
p125
aVand I can build a narrative around that
p126
aVso I know where we've been and where we're going
p127
aVand how to contribute to this conversation.
p128
aVIt allows us to problem-solve, critical think.
p129
aVWe can be in the middle of a meeting,
p130
aVlisten to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,
p131
aVdecide whether or not we like it,
p132
aVask follow-up questions.
p133
aVAll of that occurs within working memory.
p134
aVIt also allows us to go to the store
p135
aVand allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese
p136
aVwhen what we're really looking for
p137
aVis Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter)
p138
aVGotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.
p139
aVNow, a central issue with working memory
p140
aVis that it's limited.
p141
aVIt's limited in capacity, limited in duration,
p142
aVlimited in focus.
p143
aVWe tend to remember about four things.
p144
aVOkay? It used to be seven,
p145
aVbut with functional MRIs, apparently it's four,
p146
aVand we were overachieving.
p147
aVNow we can remember those four things
p148
aVfor about 10 to 20 seconds
p149
aVunless we do something with it,
p150
aVunless we process it, unless we apply it to something,
p151
aVunless we talk to somebody about it.
p152
aa(lp153
VWhen we think about working memory,
p154
aVwe have to realize that this limited capacity
p155
aVhas lots of different impacts on us.
p156
aVHave you ever walked from one room to another
p157
aVand then forgotten why you're there?
p158
aVYou do know the solution to that, right?
p159
aVYou go back to that original room. (Laughter)
p160
aVHave you ever forgotten your keys?
p161
aVYou ever forgotten your car?
p162
aVYou ever forgotten your kids?
p163
aVHave you ever been involved in a conversation,
p164
aVand you realize that the conversation to your left
p165
aVis actually more interesting? (Laughter)
p166
aVSo you're nodding and you're smiling,
p167
aVbut you're really paying attention to this one over here,
p168
aVuntil you hear that last word go up,
p169
aVand you realize,
p170
aVyou've been asked a question. (Laughter)
p171
aVAnd you're really hoping the answer is no,
p172
aVbecause that's what you're about to say.
p173
aVAll of that talks about working memory,
p174
aVwhat we can do and what we can't do.
p175
aVWe need to realize that working memory
p176
aVhas a limited capacity,
p177
aVand that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that.
p178
aVWe negotiate that through strategies.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo what I want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here,
p181
aVand these will be really important
p182
aVbecause you are now in an information target-rich environment
p183
aVfor the next several days.
p184
aVNow the first part of this that we need to think about
p185
aVand we need to process our existence, our life,
p186
aVimmediately and repeatedly.
p187
aVWe need to process what's going on
p188
aVthe moment it happens, not 10 minutes later,
p189
aVnot a week later, at the moment.
p190
aVSo we need to think about, well, do I agree with him?
p191
aVWhat's missing? What would I like to know?
p192
aVDo I agree with the assumptions?
p193
aVHow can I apply this in my life?
p194
aVIt's a way of processing what's going on
p195
aVso that we can use it later.
p196
aVNow we also need to repeat it. We need to practice.
p197
aVSo we need to think about it here.
p198
aVIn between, we want to talk to people about it.
p199
aVWe're going to write it down, and when you get home,
p200
aVpull out those notes and think about them
p201
aVand end up practicing over time.
p202
aVPractice for some reason became a very negative thing.
p203
aVIt's very positive.
p204
aa(lp205
VThe next thing is, we need to think elaboratively
p206
aVand we need to think illustratively.
p207
aVOftentimes, we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge.
p208
aVWhat we want to do is spin that around.
p209
aVWe want to take all of our existence
p210
aVand wrap it around that new knowledge
p211
aVand make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful.
p212
aVWe also want to use imagery. We are built for images.
p213
aVWe need to take advantage of that.
p214
aVThink about things in images,
p215
aVwrite things down that way.
p216
aVIf you read a book, pull things up.
p217
aVI just got through reading "The Great Gatsby,"
p218
aVand I have a perfect idea of what he looks like
p219
aVin my head, so my own version.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe last one is organization and support.
p222
aVWe are meaning-making machines. It's what we do.
p223
aVWe try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us.
p224
aVOrganization helps, so we need to structure
p225
aVwhat we're doing in ways that make sense.
p226
aVIf we are providing knowledge and experience,
p227
aVwe need to structure that.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd the last one is support.
p230
aVWe all started as novices.
p231
aVEverything we do is an approximation of sophistication.
p232
aVWe should expect it to change over time. We have to support that.
p233
aVThe support may come in asking people questions,
p234
aVgiving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it
p235
aVor has some guiding images,
p236
aVbut we need to support it.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow, the final piece of this, the take-home message
p239
aVfrom a working memory capacity standpoint is this:
p240
aVwhat we process, we learn.
p241
aVIf we're not processing life, we're not living it.
p242
aVLive life. Thank you.

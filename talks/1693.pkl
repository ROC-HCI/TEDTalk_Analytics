VSo, this book that I have in my hand
p5
aVis a directory of everybody who had an email address
p6
aVin 1982. (Laughter)
p7
aVActually, it's deceptively large.
p8
aVThere's actually only about 20 people on each page,
p9
aVbecause we have the name, address
p10
aVand telephone number of every single person.
p11
aVAnd, in fact, everybody's listed twice,
p12
aVbecause it's sorted once by name and once by email address.
p13
aVObviously a very small community.
p14
aVThere were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.
p15
aVI knew them both.
p16
aVWe didn't all know each other,
p17
aVbut we all kind of trusted each other,
p18
aVand that basic feeling of trust
p19
aVpermeated the whole network,
p20
aVand there was a real sense that
p21
aVwe could depend on each other to do things.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community,
p24
aVlet me tell you what it was like
p25
aVto register a domain name in the early days.
p26
aVNow, it just so happened that I got to register
p27
aVthe third domain name on the Internet.
p28
aVSo I could have anything I wanted
p29
aVother than bbn.com and symbolics.com.
p30
aVSo I picked think.com, but then I thought,
p31
aVyou know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there.
p32
aVMaybe I should register a few extras just in case.
p33
aVAnd then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice."
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VThat attitude of only taking what you need
p38
aVwas really what everybody had on the network in those days,
p39
aVand in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network,
p40
aVbut it was actually kind of built into the protocols
p41
aVof the Internet itself.
p42
aVSo the basic idea of I.P., or Internet protocol,
p43
aVand the way that the \u2014 the routing algorithm that used it,
p44
aVwere fundamentally "from each according to their ability,
p45
aVto each according to their need."
p46
aVAnd so, if you had some extra bandwidth,
p47
aVyou'd deliver a message for someone.
p48
aVIf they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you.
p49
aVYou'd kind of depend on people to do that,
p50
aVand that was the building block.
p51
aVIt was actually interesting that such a communist principle
p52
aVwas the basis of a system developed during the Cold War
p53
aVby the Defense Department,
p54
aVbut it obviously worked really well,
p55
aVand we all saw what happened with the Internet.
p56
aVIt was incredibly successful.
p57
aa(lp58
VIn fact, it was so successful that there's no way
p59
aVthat these days you could make a book like this.
p60
aVMy rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick.
p61
aVBut, of course, you couldn't do it,
p62
aVbecause we don't know the names of all the people
p63
aVwith Internet or email addresses,
p64
aVand even if we did know their names,
p65
aVI'm pretty sure that they would not want their name,
p66
aVaddress and telephone number published to everyone.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days,
p69
aVand so we dealt with that by making
p70
aVwalled communities,
p71
aVsecure subnetworks, VPNs,
p72
aVlittle things that aren't really the Internet
p73
aVbut are made out of the same building blocks,
p74
aVbut we're still basically building it out of those
p75
aVsame building blocks with those same assumptions of trust.
p76
aVAnd that means that it's vulnerable
p77
aVto certain kinds of mistakes that can happen,
p78
aVor certain kinds of deliberate attacks,
p79
aVbut even the mistakes can be bad.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, for instance,
p82
aVin all of Asia recently,
p83
aVit was impossible to get YouTube for a little while
p84
aVbecause Pakistan made some mistakes
p85
aVin how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network.
p86
aVThey didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did
p87
aVbecause of the way that the protocols work.
p88
aVAnother example that may have affected many of you in this audience is,
p89
aVyou may remember a couple of years ago,
p90
aVall the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded
p91
aVbecause a single routing card in Salt Lake City
p92
aVhad a bug in it.
p93
aVNow, you don't really think
p94
aVthat our airplane system depends on the Internet,
p95
aVand in some sense it doesn't.
p96
aVI'll come back to that later.
p97
aVBut the fact is that people couldn't take off
p98
aVbecause something was going wrong on the Internet,
p99
aVand the router card was down.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd so, there are many of those things that start to happen.
p102
aVNow, there was an interesting thing that happened last April.
p103
aVAll of a sudden,
p104
aVa very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet,
p105
aVincluding a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations,
p106
aVstarted getting re-routed through China.
p107
aVSo for a few hours, it all passed through China.
p108
aVNow, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake,
p109
aVand it is actually possible that it was, the way things work,
p110
aVbut certainly somebody could make
p111
aVa dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to,
p112
aVand it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes.
p113
aVImagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo if somebody really wanted to attack the United States
p116
aVor Western civilization these days,
p117
aVthey're not going to do it with tanks.
p118
aVThat will not succeed.
p119
aVWhat they'll probably do is something
p120
aVvery much like the attack that happened
p121
aVon the Iranian nuclear facility.
p122
aVNobody has claimed credit for that.
p123
aVThere was basically a factory of industrial machines.
p124
aVIt didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.
p125
aVIt thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet,
p126
aVbut it was possible for somebody to smuggle
p127
aVa USB drive in there, or something like that,
p128
aVand software got in there that causes the centrifuges,
p129
aVin that case, to actually destroy themselves.
p130
aVNow that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery
p131
aVor a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant.
p132
aVAnd so there's a lot of \u2014 I'm sure you've read a lot in papers,
p133
aVabout worries about cyberattacks
p134
aVand defenses against those.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut the fact is, people are mostly focused on
p137
aVdefending the computers on the Internet,
p138
aVand there's been surprisingly little attention
p139
aVto defending the Internet itself as a communications medium.
p140
aVAnd I think we probably do need to pay
p141
aVsome more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile.
p142
aVSo actually, in the early days,
p143
aVback when it was the ARPANET,
p144
aVthere were actually times \u2014 there was a particular time it failed completely
p145
aVbecause one single message processor
p146
aVactually got a bug in it.
p147
aVAnd the way the Internet works is
p148
aVthe routers are basically exchanging information
p149
aVabout how they can get messages to places,
p150
aVand this one processor, because of a broken card,
p151
aVdecided it could actually get a message
p152
aVto some place in negative time.
p153
aVSo, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.
p154
aVSo of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere
p155
aVwas to send it to this guy,
p156
aVwho would send it back in time and get it there super early,
p157
aVso every message in the Internet
p158
aVstarted getting switched through this one node,
p159
aVand of course that clogged everything up.
p160
aVEverything started breaking.
p161
aVThe interesting thing was, though,
p162
aVthat the sysadmins were able to fix it,
p163
aVbut they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off.
p164
aVNow, of course you couldn't do that today.
p165
aVI mean, everything off, it's like
p166
aVthe service call you get from the cable company,
p167
aVexcept for the whole world.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.
p170
aVOne of the reasons is a lot of their telephones
p171
aVuse IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on
p172
aVthat go through the Internet right now,
p173
aVand so in fact we're becoming dependent on it
p174
aVfor more and more different things,
p175
aVlike when you take off from LAX,
p176
aVyou're really not thinking you're using the Internet.
p177
aVWhen you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet.
p178
aVWhat's happening increasingly, though, is these systems
p179
aVare beginning to use the Internet.
p180
aVMost of them aren't based on the Internet yet,
p181
aVbut they're starting to use the Internet for service functions,
p182
aVfor administrative functions,
p183
aVand so if you take something like the cell phone system,
p184
aVwhich is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part,
p185
aVInternet pieces are beginning to sneak into it
p186
aVin terms of some of the control and administrative functions,
p187
aVand it's so tempting to use these same building blocks
p188
aVbecause they work so well, they're cheap,
p189
aVthey're repeated, and so on.
p190
aVSo all of our systems, more and more,
p191
aVare starting to use the same technology
p192
aVand starting to depend on this technology.
p193
aVAnd so even a modern rocket ship these days
p194
aVactually uses Internet protocol to talk
p195
aVfrom one end of the rocket ship to the other.
p196
aVThat's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo we've built this system
p199
aVwhere we understand all the parts of it,
p200
aVbut we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it,
p201
aVand it's gotten a very, very different scale
p202
aVthan it was designed for.
p203
aVAnd in fact, nobody really exactly understands
p204
aVall the things it's being used for right now.
p205
aVIt's turning into one of these big emergent systems
p206
aVlike the financial system, where we've designed all the parts
p207
aVbut nobody really exactly understands
p208
aVhow it operates and all the little details of it
p209
aVand what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.
p210
aVAnd so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet
p211
aVand saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that,
p212
aVyou should treat it with the same skepticism
p213
aVthat you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy
p214
aVor a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.
p215
aVThey have an informed opinion,
p216
aVbut it's changing so quickly that even the experts
p217
aVdon't know exactly what's going on.
p218
aVSo if you see one of these maps of the Internet,
p219
aVit's just somebody's guess.
p220
aVNobody really knows what the Internet is right now
p221
aVbecause it's different than it was an hour ago.
p222
aVIt's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd the problem with it is,
p225
aVI think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster
p226
aVlike the disaster we had in the financial system,
p227
aVwhere we take a system that's basically built on trust,
p228
aVwas basically built for a smaller-scale system,
p229
aVand we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits
p230
aVof how it was meant to operate.
p231
aVAnd so right now, I think it's literally true
p232
aVthat we don't know what the consequences
p233
aVof an effective denial-of-service attack
p234
aVon the Internet would be,
p235
aVand whatever it would be is going to be worse next year,
p236
aVand worse next year, and so on.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut so what we need is a plan B.
p239
aVThere is no plan B right now.
p240
aVThere's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept
p241
aVto be independent of the Internet,
p242
aVmade out of completely different sets of building blocks.
p243
aVSo what we need is something that doesn't necessarily
p244
aVhave to have the performance of the Internet,
p245
aVbut the police department has to be able
p246
aVto call up the fire department even without the Internet,
p247
aVor the hospitals have to order fuel oil.
p248
aVThis doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project.
p249
aVIt's actually relatively simple to do, technically,
p250
aVbecause it can use existing fibers that are in the ground,
p251
aVexisting wireless infrastructure.
p252
aVIt's basically a matter of deciding to do it.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut people won't decide to do it
p255
aVuntil they recognize the need for it,
p256
aVand that's the problem that we have right now.
p257
aVSo there's been plenty of people,
p258
aVplenty of us have been quietly arguing
p259
aVthat we should have this independent system for years,
p260
aVbut it's very hard to get people focused on plan B
p261
aVwhen plan A seems to be working so well.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo I think that, if people understand
p264
aVhow much we're starting to depend on the Internet,
p265
aVand how vulnerable it is,
p266
aVwe could get focused on
p267
aVjust wanting this other system to exist,
p268
aVand I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it,
p269
aVI'd like to have such a system," then it will get built.
p270
aVIt's not that hard a problem.
p271
aVIt could definitely be done by people in this room.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd so I think that this is actually,
p274
aVof all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference,
p275
aVthis is probably one of the very easiest to fix.
p276
aVSo I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it.
p277
aa(lp278
VThank you very much.

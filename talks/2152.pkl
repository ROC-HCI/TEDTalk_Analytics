VWhile preparing for my talk
p5
aVI was reflecting on my life and trying to figure out
p6
aVwhere exactly was that moment when my journey began.
p7
aVA long time passed by, and I simply couldn't figure out
p8
aVthe beginning or the middle or the end of my story.
p9
aVI always used to think that my beginning
p10
aVwas one afternoon in my community when my mother had told me
p11
aVthat I had escaped three arranged marriages by the time I was two.
p12
aVOr one evening when electricity had failed for eight hours in our community,
p13
aVand my dad sat, surrounded by all of us,
p14
aVtelling us stories of when he was a little kid struggling to go to school
p15
aVwhile his father, who was a farmer, wanted him to work in the fields with him.
p16
aVOr that dark night when I was 16
p17
aVwhen three little kids had come to me and they whispered in my ear
p18
aVthat my friend was murdered in something called the honor killings.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut then I realized that,
p21
aVas much as I know that these moments have contributed on my journey,
p22
aVthey have influenced my journey
p23
aVbut they have not been the beginning of it,
p24
aVbut the true beginning of my journey was in front of a mud house
p25
aVin upper Sindh of Pakistan,
p26
aVwhere my father held the hand of my 14-year-old mother
p27
aVand they decided to walk out of the village
p28
aVto go to a town where they could send their kids to school.
p29
aVIn a way, I feel like my life
p30
aVis kind of a result of some wise choices and decisions they've made.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd just like that, another of their decisions
p33
aVwas to keep me and my siblings connected to our roots.
p34
aVWhile we were living in a community I fondly remember as called Ribabad,
p35
aVwhich means community of the poor,
p36
aVmy dad made sure that we also had a house in our rural homeland.
p37
aVI come from an indigenous tribe in the mountains of Balochistan
p38
aVcalled Brahui.
p39
aVBrahui, or Brohi, means mountain dweller, and it is also my language.
p40
aVThanks to my father's very strict rules about connecting to our customs,
p41
aVI had to live a beautiful life of songs,  cultures, traditions, stories, mountains,
p42
aVand a lot of sheep.
p43
aVBut then, living in two extremes
p44
aVbetween the traditions  of my culture, of my village,
p45
aVand then modern education in my school wasn't easy.
p46
aVI was aware that I was the only girl who got to have such freedom,
p47
aVand I was guilty of it.
p48
aVWhile going to school in Karachi and Hyderabad,
p49
aVa lot of my cousins and childhood friends were getting married off,
p50
aVsome to older men, some in exchange,
p51
aVsome even as second wives.
p52
aVI got to see the beautiful tradition and its magic fade in front of me
p53
aVwhen I saw that the birth of a girl child was celebrated with sadness,
p54
aVwhen women were told to have patience as their main virtue.
p55
aa(lp56
VUp until I was 16,
p57
aVI healed my sadness by crying,
p58
aVmostly at nights  when everyone would sleep
p59
aVand I would sob in my pillow,
p60
aVuntil that one night  when I found out my friend was killed
p61
aVin the name of honor.
p62
aa(lp63
VHonor killings is a custom
p64
aVwhere men and women are suspected of having relationships
p65
aVbefore or outside of the marriage,
p66
aVand they're killed by their family for it.
p67
aVUsually the killer is the brother or father or the uncle in the family.
p68
aVThe U.N. reports there are about 1,000 honor murders every year in Pakistan,
p69
aVand these are only the reported cases.
p70
aa(lp71
VA custom that kills did not make any sense to me,
p72
aVand I knew I had to do something about it this time.
p73
aVI was not going to cry myself to sleep.
p74
aVI was going to do something, anything, to stop it.
p75
aVI was 16 \u2014 I started writing poetry
p76
aVand going door to door telling everybody about honor killings
p77
aVand why it happens, why it should be stopped,
p78
aVand raising awareness about it
p79
aVuntil I actually found a much, much  better way to handle this issue.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn those days, we were living in a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.
p82
aVEvery year, during the monsoon seasons, our house would flood up with water \u2014
p83
aVrainwater and sewage \u2014
p84
aVand my mom and dad would be taking the water out.
p85
aVIn those days, my dad brought home a huge machine, a computer.
p86
aVIt was so big it looked as if it was going to take up half of the only room we had,
p87
aVand had so many pieces and wires that needed to be connected.
p88
aVBut it was still the most exciting thing
p89
aVthat has ever happened to me and my sisters.
p90
aVMy oldest brother Ali got to be in charge of taking care of the computer,
p91
aVand all of us were given 10 to 15 minutes every day to use it.
p92
aVBeing the oldest of eight kids,
p93
aVI got to use it the last,
p94
aVand that was after I had washed the dishes,
p95
aVcleaned the house, made dinner with my mom,
p96
aVand put blankets on the floor for everyone to sleep,
p97
aVand after that,  I would run to the computer,
p98
aVconnect it to the Internet,
p99
aVand have pure joy and wonder for 10 to 15 minutes.
p100
aa(lp101
VIn those days, I had discovered a website called Joogle.
p102
aV[Google] (Laughter)
p103
aVIn my frantic wish to do something about this custom,
p104
aVI made use of Google and discovered Facebook,
p105
aVa website where people can connect to anyone around the world,
p106
aVand so, from my very tiny, cement-roofed room in Karachi,
p107
aVI connected with people in the U.K., the U.S., Australia and Canada,
p108
aVand created a campaign called
p109
aVWAKE UP Campaign against Honor Killings.
p110
aVIt became enormous in just a few months.
p111
aVI got a lot of support from all around the world.
p112
aVMedia was connecting to us.
p113
aVA lot of people were reaching out trying to raise awareness with us.
p114
aVIt became so big that it went from online to the streets of my hometown,
p115
aVwhere we would do rallies and strikes
p116
aVtrying to change the policies  in Pakistan for women's support.
p117
aVAnd while I thought everything was perfect,
p118
aVmy team \u2014 which was basically my friends and neighbors at that time \u2014
p119
aVthought everything was going so well,
p120
aVwe had no idea a big opposition was coming to us.
p121
aa(lp122
VMy community stood up against us,
p123
aVsaying we were spreading un-Islamic behavior.
p124
aVWe were challenging centuries-old customs in those communities.
p125
aVI remember my father receiving anonymous letters
p126
aVsaying, "Your daughter  is spreading Western culture
p127
aVin the honorable societies."
p128
aVOur car was stoned at one point.
p129
aVOne day I went to the office and found our metal signboard
p130
aVwrinkled and broken as if a lot of people had been hitting it with something heavy.
p131
aVThings got so bad that I had to hide myself in many ways.
p132
aVI would put up the windows of the car,
p133
aVveil my face, not speak while I was in public,
p134
aVbut eventually situations got worse when my life was threatened,
p135
aVand I had to leave, back to Karachi, and our actions stopped.
p136
aa(lp137
VBack in Karachi, as an 18-year-old,
p138
aVI thought this was the biggest failure of my entire life.
p139
aVI was devastated.
p140
aVAs a teenager, I was blaming myself for everything that happened.
p141
aVAnd it turns out, when we started reflecting,
p142
aVwe did realize that it was actually me and my team's fault.
p143
aa(lp144
VThere were two big reasons why our campaign had failed big time.
p145
aVOne of those, the first reason,
p146
aVis we were standing against core values of people.
p147
aVWe were saying no to something that was very important to them,
p148
aVchallenging their code of honor,
p149
aVand hurting them deeply in the process.
p150
aVAnd number two, which was very important for me to learn,
p151
aVand amazing, and surprising for me to learn,
p152
aVwas that we were not including the true heroes
p153
aVwho should be fighting for themselves.
p154
aVThe women in the villages had no idea we were fighting for them in the streets.
p155
aVEvery time I would go back,
p156
aVI would find my cousins and friends with scarves on their faces,
p157
aVand I would ask, "What happened?"
p158
aVAnd they'd be like,  "Our husbands beat us."
p159
aVBut we are working in the streets for you!
p160
aVWe are changing the policies.
p161
aVHow is that not impacting their life?
p162
aa(lp163
VSo then we found out something which was very amazing for us.
p164
aVThe policies of a country
p165
aVdo not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities.
p166
aVIt was devastating \u2014 like, oh, we can't actually do something about this?
p167
aVAnd we found out there's a huge gap
p168
aVwhen it comes to official policies and the real truth on the ground.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo this time, we were like, we are going to do something different.
p171
aVWe are going to use strategy,
p172
aVand we are going to go back and apologize.
p173
aVYes, apologize.
p174
aVWe went back to the communities
p175
aVand we said we are  very ashamed of what we did.
p176
aVWe are here to apologize, and in fact, we are here to make it up to you.
p177
aVHow do we do that?
p178
aVWe are going to promote three of your main cultures.
p179
aVWe know that it's music, language, and embroidery.
p180
aa(lp181
VNobody believed us.
p182
aVNobody wanted to work with us.
p183
aVIt took a lot of convincing and discussions with these communities
p184
aVuntil they agreed that we are going to promote their language
p185
aVby making a booklet of their stories, fables and old tales in the tribe,
p186
aVand we would promote their music
p187
aVby making a CD of the songs from the tribe, and some drumbeating.
p188
aVAnd the third, which was my favorite,
p189
aVwas we would promote their embroidery by making a center in the village
p190
aVwhere women would come every day to make embroidery.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd so it began.
p193
aVWe worked with one village, and we started our first center.
p194
aVIt was a beautiful day.
p195
aVWe started the center.
p196
aVWomen were coming to make embroidery,
p197
aVand going through a life-changing process of education,
p198
aVlearning about their rights, what Islam says about their rights,
p199
aVand enterprise development, how they can create money,
p200
aVand then how they can create money from money,
p201
aVhow they can fight the customs that have been destroying their lives
p202
aVfrom so many centuries,
p203
aVbecause in Islam, in reality,
p204
aVwomen are supposed to be shoulder to shoulder with men.
p205
aVWomen have so much status that we have not been hearing,
p206
aVthat they have not been hearing,
p207
aVand we needed to tell them that they need to know
p208
aVwhere their rights are and how to take them by themselves,
p209
aVbecause they can do it and we can't.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo this was the model which actually came out \u2014 very amazing.
p212
aVThrough embroidery we were promoting their traditions.
p213
aVWe went into the village. We would mobilize the community.
p214
aVWe would make a center inside where 30 women will come
p215
aVfor six months to learn about value addition of traditional embroidery,
p216
aVenterprise development, life skills and basic education,
p217
aVand about their rights and how to say no to those customs
p218
aVand how to stand as leaders for themselves and the society.
p219
aVAfter six months, we would connect these women to loans and to markets
p220
aVwhere they can become local entrepreneurs in their communities.
p221
aa(lp222
VWe soon called this project Sughar.
p223
aVSughar is a local word used in many, many languages in Pakistan.
p224
aVIt means skilled and confident women.
p225
aVI truly believe, to create women leaders, there's only one thing you have to do:
p226
aVJust let them know that they have what it takes to be a leader.
p227
aVThese women you see here,
p228
aVthey have strong skills and potential to be leaders.
p229
aVAll we had to do was remove the barriers that surrounded them,
p230
aVand that's what we decided to do.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut then while we were thinking everything was going well,
p233
aVonce again everything was fantastic,
p234
aVwe found our next setback:
p235
aVA lot of men started seeing the visible changes in their wife.
p236
aVShe's speaking more, she's making decisions \u2014
p237
aVoh my gosh, she's handling  everything in the house.
p238
aVThey stopped them from coming to the centers,
p239
aVand this time, we were like, okay, time for strategy two.
p240
aVWe went to the fashion  industry in Pakistan
p241
aVand decided to do research about what happens there.
p242
aVTurns out the fashion industry in Pakistan is very strong and growing day by day,
p243
aVbut there is less contribution from the tribal areas
p244
aVand to the tribal areas, especially women.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo we decided to launch our first ever tribal women's very own fashion brand,
p247
aVwhich is now called Nomads.
p248
aVAnd so women started earning more,
p249
aVthey started contributing more financially to the house,
p250
aVand men had to think again before saying no to them
p251
aVwhen they were coming to the centers.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Applause)
p254
aVThank you, thank you.
p255
aa(lp256
VIn 2013, we launched our first Sughar Hub instead of a center.
p257
aVWe partnered with TripAdvisor
p258
aVand created a cement hall in the middle of a village
p259
aVand invited so many other organizations to work over there.
p260
aVWe created this platform for the nonprofits
p261
aVso they can touch and work on the other issues
p262
aVthat Sughar is not working on,
p263
aVwhich would be an easy place  for them to give trainings,
p264
aVuse it as a farmer school, even as a marketplace,
p265
aVand anything they want to use it for,
p266
aVand they have been doing really amazingly.
p267
aVAnd so far, we have been able to support 900 women
p268
aVin 24 villages around Pakistan.
p269
aV(Applause)
p270
aa(lp271
VBut that's actually not what I want.
p272
aVMy dream is to reach out to one million women in the next 10 years,
p273
aVand to make sure that happens,
p274
aVthis year we launched Sughar Foundation in the U.S.
p275
aVIt is not just going to fund Sughar but many other organizations in Pakistan
p276
aVto replicate the idea
p277
aVand to find even more innovative ways
p278
aVto unleash the rural women's potential in Pakistan.
p279
aa(lp280
VThank you so much.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Applause)
p283
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you.
p284
aa(lp285
VChris Anderson: Khalida, you are quite the force of nature.
p286
aVI mean, this story, in many ways, just seems beyond belief.
p287
aVIt's incredible that someone so young could do achieve this much
p288
aVthrough so much force and ingenuity.
p289
aVSo I guess one question:
p290
aVThis is a spectacular dream to reach out and empower a million women \u2014
p291
aVhow much of the current  success depends on you,
p292
aVthe force of this magnetic personality?
p293
aVHow does it scale?
p294
aa(lp295
VKhalida Brohi: I think my job is to give the inspiration out,
p296
aVgive my dream out.
p297
aVI can't teach how to do it, because there are so many different ways.
p298
aVWe have been experimenting with three ways only.
p299
aVThere are a hundred different ways to unleash potential in women.
p300
aVI would just give the inspiration and that's my job.
p301
aVI will keep doing it. Sughar will still be growing.
p302
aVWe are planning to reach out to two more villages,
p303
aVand soon I believe  we will be scaling out of Pakistan
p304
aVinto South Asia and beyond.
p305
aa(lp306
VCA: I love that when you talked about your team in the talk,
p307
aVI mean, you were all 18 at the time.
p308
aVWhat did this team look like?
p309
aVThis was school friends, right?
p310
aa(lp311
VKB: Do people here believe that I'm at an age
p312
aVwhere I'm supposed to be a grandmother in my village?
p313
aVMy mom was married at nine, and I am the oldest woman not married
p314
aVand not doing anything in my life in my village.
p315
aa(lp316
VCA: Wait, wait, wait, not doing anything?
p317
aa(lp318
VKB: No. CA: You're right.
p319
aa(lp320
VKB: People feel sorry for me, a lot of times.
p321
aa(lp322
VCA: But how much time are you spending now actually back in Balochistan?
p323
aVKB: I live over there.
p324
aVWe live between, still, Karachi and Balochistan.
p325
aVMy siblings are all going to school.
p326
aVI am still the oldest of eight siblings.
p327
aa(lp328
VCA: But what you're doing is definitely threatening to some people there.
p329
aVHow do you handle safety? Do you feel safe?
p330
aVAre there issues there?
p331
aa(lp332
VKB: This question has come to me a lot of times before,
p333
aVand I feel like the word "fear" just comes to me and then drops,
p334
aVbut there is one fear that I have that is different from that.
p335
aVThe fear is that if I get killed, what would happen to the people
p336
aVwho love me so much?
p337
aVMy mom waits for me till late at night that I should come home.
p338
aVMy sisters want to learn so much from me,
p339
aVand there are many, many girls in my community who want to talk to me
p340
aVand ask me different things,
p341
aVand I recently got engaged. (Laughs)
p342
aV(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VCA: Is he here? You've got to stand up.
p345
aV(Applause)
p346
aa(lp347
VKB: Escaping arranged marriages, I chose my own husband
p348
aVacross the world in L.A., a really different world.
p349
aVI had to fight for a whole year. That's totally a different story.
p350
aVBut I think that's the only thing that I'm afraid of,
p351
aVand I don't want my mom to not see anyone when she waits in the night.
p352
aa(lp353
VCA: So people who want to help you on their way,
p354
aVthey can go on, they can maybe buy some of these clothes
p355
aVthat you're bringing over
p356
aVthat are actually made, the embroidery is done back in Balochistan?
p357
aa(lp358
VKB: Yeah.
p359
aa(lp360
VCA: Or they can get involved in the foundation.
p361
aa(lp362
VKB: Definitely. We are looking for as many people as we can,
p363
aVbecause now that the foundation's in the beginning process,
p364
aVI am trying to learn a lot about how to operate,
p365
aVhow to get funding or reach out to more organizations,
p366
aVand especially in the e-commerce, which is very new for me.
p367
aVI mean, I am not a fashion person, believe me.
p368
aa(lp369
VCA: Well, it's been incredible to have you here.
p370
aVPlease go on being courageous, go on being smart, and please stay safe.
p371
aa(lp372
VKB: Thank you so much. CA: Thank you, Khalida. (Applause)

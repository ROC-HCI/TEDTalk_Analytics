VI'm going to start with a little story.
p5
aVSo, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old,
p6
aVI went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete,
p7
aVover four months, slowly wasting away until
p8
aVI was basically a famine victim
p9
aVwith an unquenchable thirst.
p10
aVI had basically digested away my body.
p11
aVAnd this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip,
p12
aVmy first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain
p13
aVin West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles
p14
aVof water and drinking like a dog.
p15
aa(lp16
VThat night, I was taken into the emergency room
p17
aVand diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.
p18
aVAnd I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine,
p19
aVinsulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd something festered inside me after this happened.
p22
aVWhat I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?
p23
aVYou see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease
p24
aVwhere your body fights itself, and at the time people thought
p25
aVthat somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen
p26
aVhad triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen
p27
aVand then kill the cells that make insulin.
p28
aVAnd this is what I thought for a long period of time,
p29
aVand that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit,
p30
aVthe microbes that do bad things.
p31
aVAnd that's where I need my assistant here now.
p32
aVYou may recognize her.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks,
p35
aVand I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building,
p36
aVand they sell toys, giant microbes.
p37
aVAnd here we go!
p38
aVSo you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.
p39
aVI gotta get back out my baseball ability here.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes
p44
aVthey sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.
p45
aVEverybody focuses on the things that kill us,
p46
aVand that's what I was focusing on.
p47
aVAnd it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes,
p48
aVand those microbes actually do us good much of the time,
p49
aVrather than killing us.
p50
aVAnd so, we've known about this for some period of time.
p51
aVPeople have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us,
p52
aVI know you're not paying attention to me, but ...
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VThe microbes that cover us.
p57
aVAnd if you look at them in the microscope,
p58
aVyou can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells
p59
aVof microbes on us as we have human cells.
p60
aVThere's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.
p61
aa(lp62
VWe are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.
p63
aVAnd unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms,
p64
aVjust looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.
p65
aVAnd so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.
p66
aVIt turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes
p67
aVand to understand them is to look at their DNA.
p68
aVAnd that's what I've been doing for 20 years,
p69
aVusing DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places,
p70
aVincluding the human body, reading the DNA sequence
p71
aVand then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about
p72
aVthe microbes that are in a particular place.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd what's amazing, when you use this technology,
p75
aVfor example, looking at humans, we're not just covered
p76
aVin a sea of microbes.
p77
aVThere are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.
p78
aVWe have millions of genes of microbes in our human
p79
aVmicrobiome covering us.
p80
aVAnd so this microbial diversity differs between people,
p81
aVand what people have been thinking about in the last 10,
p82
aVmaybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes,
p83
aVthis microbial cloud in and on us,
p84
aVand the variation between us, may be responsible
p85
aVfor some of the health and illness differences between us.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.
p88
aVIt turns out that people now think that one of the triggers
p89
aVfor type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen,
p90
aVbut is in fact trying to \u2014 miscommunicating with the microbes
p91
aVthat live in and on you.
p92
aVAnd somehow maybe the microbial community that's
p93
aVin and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort
p94
aVof immune response and led to me killing the cells
p95
aVthat make insulin in my body.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is,
p98
aVwhat people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques
p99
aVin particular, to study the microbial cloud
p100
aVthat lives in and on us.
p101
aVAnd I want to tell you a story about a personal project.
p102
aVMy first personal experience with studying the microbes
p103
aVon the human body actually came from a talk that I gave,
p104
aVright around the corner from here at Georgetown.
p105
aa(lp106
VI gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be
p107
aVthe Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk,
p108
aVand came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing
p109
aVa study of ileal transplants in people.
p110
aVAnd they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd so I started a collaboration with this person,
p113
aVMichael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes
p114
aVthat colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.
p115
aVAnd I can tell you all the details about the microbial study
p116
aVthat we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story
p117
aVis something really striking that they did at the beginning
p118
aVof this project.
p119
aVThey take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor
p120
aVand they have a recipient who might have a problem
p121
aVwith their microbial community, say Crohn's disease,
p122
aVand they sterilized the donor ileum.
p123
aVCleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.
p124
aVThey did this because this was common practice
p125
aVin medicine, even though it was obvious
p126
aVthat this was not a good idea.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd fortunately, in the course of this project,
p129
aVthe transplant surgeons and the other people
p130
aVdecided, forget common practice. We have to switch.
p131
aVSo they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial
p132
aVcommunity in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor,
p133
aVand theoretically that might help the people who are
p134
aVreceiving this ileal transplant.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd so, people \u2014 this is a study that I did now.
p137
aVIn the last few years there's been a great expansion
p138
aVin using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.
p139
aVThere's something called the Human Microbiome Project
p140
aVthat's going on in the United States,
p141
aVand MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd when people have done a variety of studies,
p144
aVthey have learned things such as, when a baby is
p145
aVborn, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the
p146
aVmicrobes from your mother.
p147
aVThere are risk factors associated with cesarean sections,
p148
aVsome of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization
p149
aVwhen you carve a baby out of its mother
p150
aVrather than being delivered through the birth canal.
p151
aVAnd a variety of other studies have shown that the
p152
aVmicrobial community that lives in and on us
p153
aVhelps in development of the immune system,
p154
aVhelps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism,
p155
aVand determining our metabolic rate, probably
p156
aVdetermines our odor, and may even shape our behavior
p157
aVin a variety of ways.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd so, these studies have documented or suggested
p160
aVout of a variety of important functions for the microbial community,
p161
aVthis cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.
p162
aVAnd one area that I think is very interesting,
p163
aVwhich many of you may have now that we've thrown
p164
aVmicrobes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."
p165
aVSo people are really into cleanliness, right?
p166
aVWe have antibiotics in our kitchen counters,
p167
aVpeople are washing every part of them all of the time,
p168
aVwe pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities,
p169
aVwe take antibiotics excessively.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick,
p172
aVbut we should understand that when we pump chemicals
p173
aVand antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing
p174
aVthe cloud of microbes that live in and on us.
p175
aVAnd excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children,
p176
aVhas been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors
p177
aVfor obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety
p178
aVof problems that are probably due to disruption
p179
aVof the microbial community.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo the microbial community can go wrong
p182
aVwhether we want it to or not,
p183
aVor we can kill it with antibiotics,
p184
aVbut what can we do to restore it?
p185
aVI'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.
p186
aVProbiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore
p187
aVthe microbial community that is in and on you.
p188
aVAnd they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.
p189
aVThere's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using
p190
aVprobiotics to try and treat, prevent,
p191
aVnecrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.
p192
aVPremature infants have real problems with their microbial community.
p193
aVAnd it may be that probiotics can help prevent
p194
aVthe development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis
p195
aVin these premature infants.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.
p198
aVMost of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat
p199
aVhave one or two species in them, maybe five species in them,
p200
aVand the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.
p201
aVSo what can we do to restore our microbial community
p202
aVwhen we have thousands and thousands of species on us?
p203
aa(lp204
VWell, one thing that animals seem to do is,
p205
aVthey eat poo \u2014 coprophagia.
p206
aVAnd it turns out that many veterinarians,
p207
aVold school veterinarians in particular,
p208
aVhave been doing something called "poo tea,"
p209
aVnot booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other
p210
aVailments in horses and cows and things like that,
p211
aVwhere you make tea from the poo from a healthy
p212
aVindividual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.
p213
aVAlthough, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side,
p214
aVand you can put your hand into its rumen,
p215
aVit's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes
p216
aVdirectly into the mouth and through the entire
p217
aVtop of the digestive tract is the best delivery system,
p218
aVso you may have heard in people they are now doing
p219
aVfecal transplants, where rather than delivering
p220
aVa couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth,
p221
aVthey are delivering a community of probiotics,
p222
aVa community of microbes from a healthy donor,
p223
aVthrough the other end.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd this has turned out to be very effective in fighting
p226
aVcertain intransigent infectious diseases
p227
aVlike Clostridium difficile infections that can stay
p228
aVwith people for years and years and years.
p229
aVTransplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces,
p230
aVfrom a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure
p231
aVsystemic C. dif infections in some people.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or
p234
aVthe poo tea suggest to me, and many other people
p235
aVhave come up with this same idea, is that
p236
aVthe microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.
p237
aVWe should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.
p238
aVWe should treat it carefully and with respect,
p239
aVand we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections
p240
aVor by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness,
p241
aVwithout some real good justification.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now
p244
aVis do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease
p245
aVand 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.
p246
aVOr 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little,
p247
aVand 100 people who did not take antibiotics.
p248
aVAnd we can now start to compare the community of microbes
p249
aVand their genes and see if there are differences.
p250
aVAnd eventually we may be able to understand if they're not
p251
aVjust correlative differences, but causative.
p252
aVStudies in model systems like mouse and other animals
p253
aVare also helping do this, but people are now using
p254
aVthese technologies because they've gotten very cheap,
p255
aVto study the microbes in and on a variety of people.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is,
p258
aVI didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.
p259
aVIt turns out that my father was an M.D.,
p260
aVactually studied hormones. I told him many times
p261
aVthat I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.
p262
aVAnd he shrugged it off, I think he either thought
p263
aVI was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical
p264
aVM.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."
p265
aVWe even went to the International Society of Endocrinology
p266
aVmeeting as family in Quebec.
p267
aVAnd I was getting up every five minutes to pee,
p268
aVand drinking everybody's water at the table,
p269
aVand I think they all thought I was a druggie.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VBut the reason I'm telling you this is that
p274
aVthe medical community, my father as an example,
p275
aVsometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.
p276
aVThe microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.
p277
aVWe can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.
p278
aVThey're microbes. They're tiny.
p279
aVBut we can see them through their DNA,
p280
aVwe can see them through the effects that they have on people.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd what we need now
p283
aVis to start thinking about this microbial community in the context
p284
aVof everything in human medicine.
p285
aVIt doesn't mean that it affects every part of us,
p286
aVbut it might.
p287
aVWhat we need is a full field guide to the microbes
p288
aVthat live in and on people, so that we can understand
p289
aVwhat they're doing to our lives.
p290
aVWe are them. They are us.
p291
aa(lp292
VThank you.

VWe are stealing nature from our children.
p5
aVNow, when I say this, I don't mean that we are destroying nature
p6
aVthat they will have wanted us to preserve,
p7
aValthough that is unfortunately also the case.
p8
aVWhat I mean here is that we've started to define nature in a way
p9
aVthat's so purist and so strict
p10
aVthat under the definition we're creating for ourselves,
p11
aVthere won't be any nature left for our children
p12
aVwhen they're adults.
p13
aVBut there's a fix for this.
p14
aVSo let me explain.
p15
aa(lp16
VRight now, humans use half of the world
p17
aVto live, to grow their crops and their timber,
p18
aVto pasture their animals.
p19
aVIf you added up all the human beings,
p20
aVwe would weigh 10 times as much as all the wild mammals put together.
p21
aVWe cut roads through the forest.
p22
aVWe have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean beaches.
p23
aVWe've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertilizers.
p24
aVAnd of course, we've changed the chemistry of the air.
p25
aVSo when you take your next breath,
p26
aVyou'll be breathing in 42 percent more carbon dioxide
p27
aVthan if you were breathing in 1750.
p28
aVSo all of these changes, and many others,
p29
aVhave come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric of the "Anthropocene."
p30
aVAnd this is a term that some geologists are suggesting
p31
aVwe should give to our current epoch,
p32
aVgiven how pervasive human influence has been over it.
p33
aVNow, it's still just a proposed epoch, but I think it's a helpful way
p34
aVto think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo where does this put nature?
p37
aVWhat counts as nature in a world where everything is influenced by humans?
p38
aa(lp39
VSo 25 years ago, environmental writer Bill McKibben said
p40
aVthat because nature was a thing apart from man
p41
aVand because climate change meant
p42
aVthat every centimeter of the Earth was altered by man,
p43
aVthen nature was over.
p44
aVIn fact, he called his book "The End of Nature."
p45
aa(lp46
VI disagree with this. I just disagree with this.
p47
aVI disagree with this definition of nature, because, fundamentally, we are animals.
p48
aVRight? Like, we evolved on this planet
p49
aVin the context of all the other animals with which we share a planet,
p50
aVand all the other plants, and all the other microbes.
p51
aVAnd so I think that nature
p52
aVis not that which is untouched by humanity, man or woman.
p53
aVI think that nature is anywhere where life thrives,
p54
aVanywhere where there are multiple species together,
p55
aVanywhere that's green and blue and thriving and filled with life
p56
aVand growing.
p57
aVAnd under that definition,
p58
aVthings look a little bit different.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow, I understand that there are certain parts of this nature
p61
aVthat speak to us in a special way.
p62
aVPlaces like Yellowstone,
p63
aVor the Mongolian steppe,
p64
aVor the Great Barrier Reef
p65
aVor the Serengeti.
p66
aVPlaces that we think of as kind of Edenic representations
p67
aVof a nature before we screwed everything up.
p68
aVAnd in a way, they are less impacted by our day to day activities.
p69
aVMany of these places have no roads or few roads,
p70
aVso on, like such.
p71
aVBut ultimately, even these Edens are deeply influenced by humans.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, let's just take North America, for example,
p74
aVsince that's where we're meeting.
p75
aVSo between about 15,000 years ago when people first came here,
p76
aVthey started a process of interacting with the nature
p77
aVthat led to the extinction of a big slew of large-bodied animals,
p78
aVfrom the mastodon to the giant ground sloth,
p79
aVsaber-toothed cats,
p80
aVall of these cool animals that unfortunately are no longer with us.
p81
aVAnd when those animals went extinct,
p82
aVyou know, the ecosystems didn't stand still.
p83
aVMassive ripple effects changed grasslands into forests,
p84
aVchanged the composition of forest from one tree to another.
p85
aVSo even in these Edens,
p86
aVeven in these perfect-looking places
p87
aVthat seem to remind us of a past before humans,
p88
aVwe're essentially looking at a humanized landscape.
p89
aVNot just these prehistoric humans, but historical humans, indigenous people
p90
aVall the way up until the moment when the first colonizers showed up.
p91
aVAnd the case is the same for the other continents as well.
p92
aVHumans have just been involved in nature
p93
aVin a very influential way for a very long time.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, just recently, someone told me,
p96
aa(lp97
V"Oh, but there are still wild places."
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd I said, "Where? Where? I want to go."
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd he said, "The Amazon."
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd I was like, "Oh, the Amazon. I was just there.
p104
aVIt's awesome. National Geographic sent me to Manú National Park,
p105
aVwhich is in the Peruvian Amazon,
p106
aVbut it's a big chunk of rainforest, uncleared, no roads,
p107
aVprotected as a national park,
p108
aVone of the most, in fact, biodiverse parks in the world.
p109
aVAnd when I got in there with my canoe, what did I find, but people.
p110
aVPeople have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years.
p111
aVPeople live there, and they don't just float over the jungle.
p112
aVThey have a meaningful relationship with the landscape.
p113
aVThey hunt. They grow crops.
p114
aVThey domesticate crops.
p115
aVThey use the natural resources to build their houses,
p116
aVto thatch their houses.
p117
aVThey even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals.
p118
aVThese people are there
p119
aVand they're interacting with the environment
p120
aVin a way that's really meaningful and that you can see in the environment.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, I was with an anthropologist on this trip,
p123
aVand he told me, as we were floating down the river,
p124
aVhe said, "There are no demographic voids in the Amazon."
p125
aVThis statement has really stuck with me,
p126
aVbecause what it means is that the whole Amazon is like this.
p127
aVThere's people everywhere.
p128
aVAnd many other tropical forests are the same,
p129
aVand not just tropical forests.
p130
aVPeople have influenced ecosystems in the past,
p131
aVand they continue to influence them in the present,
p132
aVeven in places where they're harder to notice.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo, if all of the definitions of nature that we might want to use
p135
aVthat involve it being untouched by humanity
p136
aVor not having people in it,
p137
aVif all of those actually give us a result where we don't have any nature,
p138
aVthen maybe they're the wrong definitions.
p139
aVMaybe we should define it by the presence of multiple species,
p140
aVby the presence of a thriving life.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow, if we do it that way,
p143
aVwhat do we get?
p144
aVWell, it's this kind of miracle.
p145
aVAll of a sudden, there's nature all around us.
p146
aVAll of a sudden, we see this Monarch caterpillar
p147
aVmunching on this plant,
p148
aVand we realize that there it is,
p149
aVand it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga.
p150
aVAnd look at this empty lot.
p151
aVI mean, there's, like, probably,
p152
aVa dozen, minimum, plant species growing there,
p153
aVsupporting all kinds of insect life,
p154
aVand this is a completely unmanaged space, a completely wild space.
p155
aVThis is a kind of wild nature right under our nose,
p156
aVthat we don't even notice.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd there's an interesting little paradox, too.
p159
aVSo this nature,
p160
aVthis kind of wild, untended part
p161
aVof our urban, peri-urban, suburban agricultural existence
p162
aVthat flies under the radar,
p163
aVit's arguably more wild than a national park,
p164
aVbecause national parks are very carefully managed
p165
aVin the 21st century.
p166
aVCrater Lake in southern Oregon, which is my closest national park,
p167
aVis a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the past.
p168
aVBut they're managing it carefully.
p169
aVOne of the issues they have now is white bark pine die-off.
p170
aVWhite bark pine is a beautiful, charismatic \u2014
p171
aVI'll say it's a charismatic megaflora
p172
aVthat grows up at high altitude \u2014
p173
aVand it's got all these problems right now with disease.
p174
aVThere's a blister rust that was introduced,
p175
aVbark beetle.
p176
aVSo to deal with this, the park service has been planting
p177
aVrust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park,
p178
aVeven in areas that they are otherwise managing as wilderness.
p179
aVAnd they're also putting out beetle repellent in key areas
p180
aVas I saw last time I went hiking there.
p181
aVAnd this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think.
p182
aVNational parks are heavily managed.
p183
aVThe wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure.
p184
aVFires are suppressed.
p185
aVFires are started.
p186
aVNon-native species are removed.
p187
aVNative species are reintroduced.
p188
aVAnd in fact, I took a look,
p189
aVand Banff National Park is doing all of the things I just listed:
p190
aVsuppressing fire, having fire,
p191
aVradio-collaring wolves, reintroducing bison.
p192
aVIt takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
V(Applause)
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd in a further irony, these places that we love the most
p199
aVare the places that we love a little too hard, sometimes.
p200
aVA lot of us like to go there,
p201
aVand because we're managing them to be stable
p202
aVin the face of a changing planet,
p203
aVthey often are becoming more fragile over time.
p204
aa(lp205
VWhich means that they're the absolute worst places
p206
aVto take your children on vacation,
p207
aVbecause you can't do anything there.
p208
aVYou can't climb the trees.
p209
aVYou can't fish the fish.
p210
aVYou can't make a campfire out in the middle of nowhere.
p211
aVYou can't take home the pinecones.
p212
aVThere are so many rules and restrictions
p213
aVthat from a child's point of view,
p214
aVthis is, like, the worst nature ever.
p215
aVBecause children don't want to hike
p216
aVthrough a beautiful landscape for five hours
p217
aVand then look at a beautiful view.
p218
aVThat's maybe what we want to do as adults,
p219
aVbut what kids want to do is hunker down in one spot
p220
aVand just tinker with it, just work with it,
p221
aVjust pick it up, build a house, build a fort, do something like that.
p222
aa(lp223
VAdditionally, these sort of Edenic places
p224
aVare often distant from where people live.
p225
aVAnd they're expensive to get to. They're hard to visit.
p226
aVSo this means that they're only available to the elites,
p227
aVand that's a real problem.
p228
aVThe Nature Conservancy did a survey of young people,
p229
aVand they asked them, how often do you spend time outdoors?
p230
aVAnd only two out of five spent time outdoors
p231
aVat least once a week.
p232
aVThe other three out of five were just staying inside.
p233
aVAnd when they asked them why, what are the barriers to going outside,
p234
aVthe response of 61 percent was,
p235
aV"There are no natural areas near my home."
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd this is crazy. This is just patently false.
p238
aVI mean, 71 percent of people in the US
p239
aVlive within a 10-minute walk of a city park.
p240
aVAnd I'm sure the figures are similar in other countries.
p241
aVAnd that doesn't even count your back garden,
p242
aVthe urban creek, the empty lot.
p243
aVEverybody lives near nature.
p244
aVEvery kid lives near nature.
p245
aVWe've just somehow forgotten how to see it.
p246
aVWe've spent too much time watching David Attenborough documentaries
p247
aVwhere the nature is really sexy \u2014
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
Vand we've forgotten how to see the nature that is literally right outside our door,
p252
aVthe nature of the street tree.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo here's an example: Philadelphia.
p255
aVThere's this cool elevated railway
p256
aVthat you can see from the ground, that's been abandoned.
p257
aVNow, this may sound like the beginning of the High Line story in Manhattan,
p258
aVand it's very similar, except they haven't developed this into a park yet,
p259
aValthough they're working on it.
p260
aVSo for now, it's still this little sort of secret wilderness
p261
aVin the heart of Philadelphia,
p262
aVand if you know where the hole is in the chain-link fence,
p263
aVyou can scramble up to the top
p264
aVand you can find this completely wild meadow
p265
aVjust floating above the city of Philadelphia.
p266
aVEvery single one of these plants grew from a seed
p267
aVthat planted itself there.
p268
aVThis is completely autonomous, self-willed nature.
p269
aVAnd it's right in the middle of the city.
p270
aVAnd they've sent people up there to do sort of biosurveys,
p271
aVand there are over 50 plant species up there.
p272
aVAnd it's not just plants.
p273
aVThis is an ecosystem, a functioning ecosystem.
p274
aVIt's creating soil. It's sequestering carbon.
p275
aVThere's pollination going on.
p276
aVI mean, this is really an ecosystem.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo scientists have started calling ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems,"
p279
aVbecause they're often dominated by non-native species,
p280
aVand because they're just super weird.
p281
aVThey're just unlike anything we've ever seen before.
p282
aVFor so long, we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash.
p283
aVWe're talking about regrown agricultural fields,
p284
aVtimber plantations that are not being managed on a day-to-day basis,
p285
aVsecond-growth forests generally, the entire East Coast,
p286
aVwhere after agriculture moved west, the forest sprung up.
p287
aVAnd of course, pretty much all of Hawaii,
p288
aVwhere novel ecosystems are the norm,
p289
aVwhere exotic species totally dominate.
p290
aVThis forest here has Queensland maple,
p291
aVit has sword ferns from Southeast Asia.
p292
aVYou can make your own novel ecosystem, too.
p293
aVIt's really simple.
p294
aVYou just stop mowing your lawn.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VIlkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland, and he did this experiment himself.
p299
aVHe just stopped mowing his lawn,
p300
aVand after a few years, he had some grad students come,
p301
aVand they did sort of a bio-blitz of his backyard,
p302
aVand they found 375 plant species,
p303
aVincluding two endangered species.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo when you're up there on that future High Line of Philadelphia,
p306
aVsurrounded by this wildness,
p307
aVsurrounded by this diversity, this abundance, this vibrance,
p308
aVyou can look over the side
p309
aVand you can see a local playground for a local school,
p310
aVand that's what it looks like.
p311
aVThese children have, that \u2014
p312
aVYou know, under my definition,
p313
aVthere's a lot of the planet that counts as nature,
p314
aVbut this would be one of the few places that wouldn't count as nature.
p315
aVThere's nothing there except humans, no other plants, no other animals.
p316
aVAnd what I really wanted to do
p317
aVwas just, like, throw a ladder over the side
p318
aVand get all these kids to come up with me into this cool meadow.
p319
aVIn a way, I feel like this is the choice that faces us.
p320
aVIf we dismiss these new natures as not acceptable or trashy or no good,
p321
aVwe might as well just pave them over.
p322
aVAnd in a world where everything is changing,
p323
aVwe need to be very careful about how we define nature.
p324
aa(lp325
VIn order not to steal it from our children,
p326
aVwe have to do two things.
p327
aVFirst, we cannot define nature as that which is untouched.
p328
aVThis never made any sense anyway.
p329
aVNature has not been untouched for thousands of years.
p330
aVAnd it excludes most of the nature that most people can visit
p331
aVand have a relationship with,
p332
aVincluding only nature that children cannot touch.
p333
aVWhich brings me to the second thing that we have to do,
p334
aVwhich is that we have to let children touch nature,
p335
aVbecause that which is untouched is unloved.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VWe face some pretty grim environmental challenges on this planet.
p340
aVClimate change is among them.
p341
aVThere's others too: habitat loss is my favorite thing
p342
aVto freak out about in the middle of the night.
p343
aVBut in order to solve them,
p344
aVwe need people \u2014 smart, dedicated people \u2014
p345
aVwho care about nature.
p346
aVAnd the only way we're going to raise up a generation of people
p347
aVwho care about nature
p348
aVis by letting them touch nature.
p349
aa(lp350
VI have a Fort Theory of Ecology,
p351
aVFort Theory of Conservation.
p352
aVEvery ecologist I know, every conservation biologist I know,
p353
aVevery conservation professional I know,
p354
aVbuilt forts when they were kids.
p355
aVIf we have a generation that doesn't know how to build a fort,
p356
aVwe'll have a generation that doesn't know how to care about nature.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd I don't want to be the one to tell this kid,
p359
aVwho is on a special program
p360
aVthat takes Philadelphia kids from poor neighborhoods
p361
aVand takes them to city parks,
p362
aVI don't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he's holding
p363
aVis a non-native invasive weed that he should throw away as trash.
p364
aVI think I would much rather learn from this boy
p365
aVthat no matter where this plant comes from,
p366
aVit is beautiful, and it deserves to be touched and appreciated.
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you.

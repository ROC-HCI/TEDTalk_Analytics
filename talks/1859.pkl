VIn December of 2010,
p5
aVthe city of Apatzingán
p6
aVin the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,
p7
aVawoke to gunfire.
p8
aVFor two straight days,
p9
aVthe city became an open battlefield
p10
aVbetween the federal forces
p11
aVand a well-organized group,
p12
aVpresumably from the local criminal organization,
p13
aVLa Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.
p14
aVThe citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire
p15
aVbut also explosions
p16
aVand burning trucks used as barricades across the city,
p17
aVso truly like a battlefield.
p18
aVAfter these two days,
p19
aVand during a particularly intense encounter,
p20
aVit was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,
p21
aVNazario Moreno, was killed.
p22
aa(lp23
VIn response to this terrifying violence,
p24
aVthe mayor of Apatzingán
p25
aVdecided to call the citizens to a march for peace.
p26
aVThe idea was to ask for a softer approach
p27
aVto criminal activity in the state.
p28
aVAnd so, the day of the scheduled procession,
p29
aVthousands of people showed up.
p30
aVAs the mayor was preparing to deliver
p31
aVthe speech starting the march,
p32
aVhis team noticed
p33
aVthat, while half of the participants
p34
aVwere appropriately dressed in white,
p35
aVand bearing banners asking for peace,
p36
aVthe other half was actually marching
p37
aVin support of the criminal organization
p38
aVand its now-presumed-defunct leader.
p39
aVShocked, the mayor decided to step aside
p40
aVrather than participate or lead a procession
p41
aVthat was ostensibly in support of organized crime.
p42
aVAnd so his team stepped aside.
p43
aVThe two marches joined together,
p44
aVand they continued their path
p45
aVtowards the state capital.
p46
aa(lp47
VThis story of horrific violence
p48
aVfollowed by a fumbled approach
p49
aVby federal and local authorities as they tried
p50
aVto engage civil society,
p51
aVwho has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,
p52
aVis a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,
p53
aVwhere we see that our current understanding
p54
aVof drug violence and what leads to it
p55
aVis probably at the very least incomplete.
p56
aa(lp57
VIf you decided to spend 30 minutes trying
p58
aVto figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico
p59
aVby, say, just researching online,
p60
aVthe first thing you would find out is that
p61
aVwhile the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,
p62
aVthere are some that are more
p63
aVand there are some that are much less equal than others,
p64
aVbecause you will quickly find out
p65
aVthat in the past six years
p66
aVanywhere between 60 and 100,000 people
p67
aVhave lost their lives in drug-related violence.
p68
aVTo put these numbers in perspective,
p69
aVthis is eight times larger than the number of casualties
p70
aVin the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
p71
aVIt's also shockingly close to the number of people
p72
aVwho have died in the Syrian civil war,
p73
aVwhich is an active civil war.
p74
aVThis is happening just south of the border.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow as you're reading, however,
p77
aVyou will be maybe surprised that you will quickly
p78
aVbecome numb to the numbers of deaths,
p79
aVbecause you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers
p80
aVof faceless, nameless dead people.
p81
aVImplicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative
p82
aVthat all the people who are dying
p83
aVwere somehow involved in the drug trade,
p84
aVand we infer this because they were either tortured
p85
aVor executed in a professional manner,
p86
aVor, most likely, both.
p87
aVAnd so clearly they were criminals
p88
aVbecause of the way they died.
p89
aVAnd so the narrative is that somehow these people
p90
aVgot what they were deserved.
p91
aVThey were part of the bad guys.
p92
aVAnd that creates some form of comfort
p93
aVfor a lot of people.
p94
aa(lp95
VHowever, while it's easier to think
p96
aVof us, the citizens, the police, the army,
p97
aVas the good guys, and them, the narcos,
p98
aVthe carteles, as the bad guys,
p99
aVif you think about it,
p100
aVthe latter are only providing a service to the former.
p101
aVWhether we like it or not,
p102
aVthe U.S. is the largest market
p103
aVfor illegal substances in the world,
p104
aVaccounting for more than half of global demand.
p105
aVIt shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico
p106
aVthat is its only route of access from the South,
p107
aVand so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,
p108
aVused to say, "Poor Mexico,
p109
aVso far from God and so close to the United States."
p110
aa(lp111
VThe U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users
p112
aVof illegal drugs in the United States.
p113
aVUsing very, very conservative assumptions,
p114
aVthis yields a yearly drug market on the retail side
p115
aVof anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.
p116
aVIf we assume that the narcos only have access
p117
aVto the wholesale part, which we know is false,
p118
aVthat still leaves you with yearly revenues
p119
aVof anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.
p120
aVTo put these numbers in perspective,
p121
aVMicrosoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.
p122
aVAnd it so happens that this is a product that,
p123
aVbecause of its nature, a business model
p124
aVto address this market requires you
p125
aVto guarantee to your producers
p126
aVthat their product will be reliably placed
p127
aVin the markets where it is consumed.
p128
aVAnd the only way to do this, because it's illegal,
p129
aVis to have absolute control of the geographic corridors
p130
aVthat are used to transport drugs.
p131
aVHence the violence.
p132
aVIf you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,
p133
aVyou will see that it almost perfectly aligns
p134
aVwith the most efficient routes of transportation
p135
aVfrom the south to the north.
p136
aVThe only thing that the cartels are doing
p137
aVis that they're trying to protect their business.
p138
aa(lp139
VIt's not only a multi-billion dollar market,
p140
aVbut it's also a complex one.
p141
aVFor example, the coca plant is a fragile plant
p142
aVthat can only grow in certain latitudes,
p143
aVand so it means that a business model
p144
aVto address this market requires you to have
p145
aVdecentralized, international production,
p146
aVthat by the way needs to have good quality control,
p147
aVbecause people need a good high
p148
aVthat is not going to kill them
p149
aVand that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.
p150
aVAnd so that means they need to secure
p151
aVproduction and quality control in the south,
p152
aVand you need to ensure that you have
p153
aVefficient and effective distribution channels
p154
aVin the markets where these drugs are consumed.
p155
aVI urge you, but only a little bit,
p156
aVbecause I don't want to get you in trouble,
p157
aVto just ask around and see how difficult it would be
p158
aVto get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,
p159
aVwhenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,
p160
aVand some of you may be surprised to know
p161
aVthat there are many dealers that offer a service
p162
aVwhere if you send them a text message,
p163
aVthey guarantee delivery of the drug
p164
aVin 30 minutes or less.
p165
aa(lp166
VThink about this for a second.
p167
aVThink about the complexity
p168
aVof the distribution network that I just described.
p169
aVIt's very difficult to reconcile this
p170
aVwith the image of faceless, ignorant goons
p171
aVthat are just shooting each other,
p172
aVvery difficult to reconcile.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,
p175
aVan effective organization requires
p176
aVan integrated strategy that includes
p177
aVa good organizational structure, good incentives,
p178
aVa solid identity and good brand management.
p179
aVThis leads me to the second thing that you would learn
p180
aVin your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.
p181
aVBecause you would quickly realize,
p182
aVand maybe be confused by the fact,
p183
aVthat there are three organizations
p184
aVthat are constantly named in the articles.
p185
aVYou will hear about Los Zetas,
p186
aVthe Knights Templar, which is the new brand
p187
aVfor the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,
p188
aVand the Sinaloa Federation.
p189
aVYou will read that Los Zetas is this assortment
p190
aVof sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter
p191
aVand they silence the press,
p192
aVand this is somewhat true, or mostly true.
p193
aVBut this is the result of a very careful branding
p194
aVand business strategy.
p195
aVYou see, Los Zetas is not just
p196
aVthis random assortment of individuals,
p197
aVbut was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,
p198
aVthat used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.
p199
aVWhen that corridor became contested, they decided
p200
aVthat they wanted to recruit
p201
aVa professional enforcement arm.
p202
aVSo they recruited Los Zetas:
p203
aVan entire unit of elite paratroopers
p204
aVfrom the Mexican Army.
p205
aVThey were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,
p206
aVso much so that at some point, they decided
p207
aVto just take over the operations,
p208
aVwhich is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,
p209
aVbecause they grow up.
p210
aVBecause the Zetas organization was founded in treason,
p211
aVthey lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution
p212
aVin the most profitable markets like cocaine,
p213
aVbut what they did have,
p214
aVand this is again based on their military origin,
p215
aVwas a perfectly structured chain of command
p216
aVwith a very clear hierarchy
p217
aVand a very clear promotion path that allowed them
p218
aVto supervise and operate across many, many markets
p219
aVvery effectively,
p220
aVwhich is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.
p221
aVAnd so because they didn't have access
p222
aVto the more profitable drug markets,
p223
aVthis pushed them and gave them the opportunity
p224
aVto diversify into other forms of crime.
p225
aVThat includes kidnapping, prostitution,
p226
aVlocal drug dealing and human trafficking,
p227
aVincluding of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.
p228
aVSo what they currently run is truly
p229
aVand quite literally a franchise business.
p230
aVThey focus most of their recruiting on the army,
p231
aVand they very openly advertise for better salaries,
p232
aVbetter benefits, better promotion paths,
p233
aVnot to mention much better food,
p234
aVthan what the army can deliver.
p235
aVThe way they operate is that
p236
aVwhen they arrive in a locality,
p237
aVthey let people know that they are there,
p238
aVand they go to the most powerful local gang
p239
aVand they say, "I offer you
p240
aVto be the local representative of the Zeta brand."
p241
aVIf they agree \u2014 and you don't want to know
p242
aVwhat happens if they don't \u2014
p243
aVthey train them and they supervise them
p244
aVon how to run the most efficient criminal operation
p245
aVfor that town, in exchange for royalties.
p246
aVThis kind of business model obviously depends
p247
aVentirely on having a very effective brand of fear,
p248
aVand so Los Zetas
p249
aVcarefully stage acts of violence
p250
aVthat are spectacular in nature,
p251
aVespecially when they arrive first in a city,
p252
aVbut again, that's just a brand strategy.
p253
aVI'm not saying they're not violent,
p254
aVbut what I am saying is that even though you will read
p255
aVthat they are the most violent of all,
p256
aVwhen you count, when you do the body count,
p257
aVthey're actually all the same.
p258
aa(lp259
VIn contrast to them, the Knights Templar
p260
aVthat arose in Michoacán
p261
aVemerged in reaction to the incursion
p262
aVof the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.
p263
aVMichoacán is a geographically strategic state
p264
aVbecause it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,
p265
aVand it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,
p266
aVwhich then gives you direct access to the U.S.
p267
aVThe Knights Templar realized very quickly
p268
aVthat they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,
p269
aVand so they developed a strategy
p270
aVas a social enterprise.
p271
aVThey brand themselves as representative of
p272
aVand protecting of the citizens of Michoacán
p273
aVagainst organized crime.
p274
aVTheir brand of social enterprise means
p275
aVthat they require a lot of civic engagement,
p276
aVso they invest heavily in providing local services,
p277
aVlike dealing with home violence,
p278
aVgoing after petty criminals, treating addicts,
p279
aVand keeping drugs out of the local markets
p280
aVwhere they are,
p281
aVand, of course, protecting people
p282
aVfrom other criminal organizations.
p283
aVNow, they kill a lot of people too,
p284
aVbut when they kill them,
p285
aVthey provide very careful narratives and descriptions
p286
aVfor why they did them,
p287
aVthrough newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,
p288
aVand billboards that explain that the people who were killed
p289
aVwere killed because they represented a threat
p290
aVnot to us, as an organization, of course,
p291
aVbut to you, as citizens.
p292
aVAnd so we're actually here to protect you.
p293
aVThey, as social enterprises do,
p294
aVhave created a moral and ethical code
p295
aVthat they advertise around,
p296
aVand they have very strict recruiting practices.
p297
aVAnd here you have the types of explanations
p298
aVthat they provide for some of their actions.
p299
aVThey have actually retained access
p300
aVto the profitable drug trade,
p301
aVbut the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,
p302
aVand they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,
p303
aVthey leverage that to, for example,
p304
aVtrade copper from Michoacán that is legally created
p305
aVand legally extracted
p306
aVwith illegal ephedrine from China
p307
aVwhich is a critical precursor for methamphetamines
p308
aVthat they produce, and then they have partnerships
p309
aVwith larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation
p310
aVthat place their products in the U.S.
p311
aa(lp312
VFinally, the Sinaloa Federation.
p313
aVWhen you read about them, you will often read about them
p314
aVwith an undertone of reverence and admiration,
p315
aVbecause they are the most integrated
p316
aVand the largest of all the Mexican organizations,
p317
aVand, many people argue, the world.
p318
aVThey started as just sort of a transport organization
p319
aVthat specialized in smuggling between the U.S.
p320
aVand the Mexican borders,
p321
aVbut now they have grown
p322
aVinto a truly integrated multinational
p323
aVthat has partnerships in production in the south
p324
aVand partnerships in global distribution
p325
aVacross the planet.
p326
aVThey have cultivated a brand of professionalism,
p327
aVbusiness acumen and innovation.
p328
aVThey have designed new drug products
p329
aVand new drug processes.
p330
aVThey have designed narco-tunnels
p331
aVthat go across the border,
p332
aVand you can see that these are not
p333
aV"The Shawshank Redemption" types.
p334
aVThey have invented narco-submarines and boats
p335
aVthat are not detected by radar.
p336
aVThey have invented drones to transport drugs,
p337
aVcatapults, you name it.
p338
aVOne of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation
p339
aVactually made it to the Forbes list.
p340
aa(lp341
V[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]
p342
aa(lp343
VLike any multinational would, they have specialized
p344
aVand focused only in the most profitable part of the business,
p345
aVwhich is high-margin drugs like cocaine,
p346
aVheroine, methamphetamines.
p347
aVLike any traditional Latin American multinational would,
p348
aVthe way they control their operations
p349
aVis through family ties.
p350
aVWhen they're entering a new market, they send
p351
aVa family member to supervise it,
p352
aVor, if they're partnering with a new organization,
p353
aVthey create a family tie,
p354
aVeither through marriages or other types of ties.
p355
aVLike any other multinational would,
p356
aVthey protect their brand by outsourcing
p357
aVthe more questionable parts of the business model,
p358
aVlike for example, when they have to engage
p359
aVin violence against other criminal organizations,
p360
aVthey recruit gangs and other smaller players
p361
aVto do the dirty work for them,
p362
aVand they try to separate their operations
p363
aVand their violence and be very discrete about this.
p364
aa(lp365
VTo further strengthen their brand,
p366
aVthey actually have professional P.R. firms
p367
aVthat shape how the press talks about them.
p368
aVThey have professional videographers on staff.
p369
aVThey have incredibly productive ties
p370
aVwith the security organizations
p371
aVon both sides of the border.
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd so, differences aside,
p374
aVwhat these three organizations share
p375
aVis on the one hand, a very clear understanding
p376
aVthat institutions cannot be imposed from the top,
p377
aVbut rather they are built from the bottom up
p378
aVone interaction at a time.
p379
aVThey have created extremely coherent structures
p380
aVthat they use to show the inconsistencies
p381
aVin government policies.
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd so what I want you to remember from this talk
p384
aVare three things.
p385
aVThe first one is that drug violence
p386
aVis actually the result
p387
aVof a huge market demand
p388
aVand an institutional setup that forces
p389
aVthe servicing of this market to necessitate violence
p390
aVto guarantee delivery routes.
p391
aVThe second thing I want you to remember
p392
aVis that these are sophisticated,
p393
aVcoherent organizations
p394
aVthat are business organizations,
p395
aVand analyzing them and treating them as such
p396
aVis probably a much more useful approach.
p397
aVThe third thing I want you to remember
p398
aVis that even though we're more comfortable
p399
aVwith this idea of "them,"
p400
aVa set of bad guys separated from us,
p401
aVwe are actually accomplices to them,
p402
aVeither through our direct consumption
p403
aVor through our acceptance of the inconsistency
p404
aVbetween our policies of prohibition
p405
aVand our actual behavior of tolerance
p406
aVor even encouragement of consumption.
p407
aa(lp408
VThese organizations service, recruit from,
p409
aVand operate within our communities,
p410
aVso necessarily, they are much more integrated
p411
aVwithin them than we are comfortable acknowledging.
p412
aVAnd so to me the question is not whether
p413
aVthese dynamics will continue the way they have.
p414
aVWe see that the nature of this phenomenon
p415
aVguarantees that they will.
p416
aVThe question is whether we are willing to continue
p417
aVour support of a failed strategy
p418
aVbased on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance
p419
aVat the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.
p420
aa(lp421
VThank you.

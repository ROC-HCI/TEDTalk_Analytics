VI've spent the last decade
p5
aVsubjecting myself to pain and humiliation,
p6
aVhopefully for a good cause,
p7
aVwhich is self-improvement.
p8
aVAnd I've done this in three parts.
p9
aVSo first I started with the mind.
p10
aVAnd I decided to try to get smarter
p11
aVby reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica
p12
aVfrom A to Z \u2014
p13
aVor, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec."
p14
aVAnd here's a little image of that.
p15
aVAnd this was an amazing year.
p16
aVIt was really a fascinating journey.
p17
aVIt was painful at times,
p18
aVespecially for those around me.
p19
aVMy wife started to fine me one dollar
p20
aVfor every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.
p21
aVSo it had its downsides.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut after that,
p24
aVI decided to work on the spirit.
p25
aVAs I mentioned last year,
p26
aVI grew up with no religion at all.
p27
aVI'm Jewish,
p28
aVbut I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVNot really.
p31
aVBut I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage
p32
aVby actually diving in
p33
aVand trying to live it and immerse myself in it.
p34
aVSo I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.
p35
aVAnd from the Ten Commandments
p36
aVto growing my beard \u2014
p37
aVbecause Leviticus says you cannot shave.
p38
aVSo this is what I looked like by the end.
p39
aVThank you for that reaction.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVI look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.
p42
aVI got both of them.
p43
aVSo there was the topiary there.
p44
aVAnd there's the sheep.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow the final part of the trilogy
p47
aVwas I wanted to focus on the body
p48
aVand try to be the healthiest person I could be,
p49
aVthe healthiest person alive.
p50
aVSo that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.
p51
aVAnd I just finished a couple of months ago.
p52
aVAnd I have to say, thank God.
p53
aVBecause living so healthily was killing me.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVIt was so overwhelming,
p56
aVbecause the amount of things you have to do,
p57
aVit's just mind-boggling.
p58
aVI was listening to all the experts
p59
aVand talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.
p60
aVAnd they were telling me
p61
aVall the things I had to do.
p62
aVI had to eat right,
p63
aVexercise, meditate, pet dogs,
p64
aVbecause that lowers the blood pressure.
p65
aVI wrote the book on a treadmill,
p66
aVand it took me about a thousand miles
p67
aVto write the book.
p68
aVI had to put on sunscreen.
p69
aVThis was no small feat,
p70
aVbecause if you listen to dermatologists,
p71
aVthey say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.
p72
aVAnd you have to reapply it every two to four hours.
p73
aVSo I think half of my book advance
p74
aVwent into sunscreen.
p75
aVI was like a glazed doughnut
p76
aVfor most of the year.
p77
aVThere was the washing of hands.
p78
aVI had to do that properly.
p79
aVAnd my immunologist told me
p80
aVthat I should also wipe down
p81
aVall of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,
p82
aVbecause those are just orgies of germs.
p83
aVSo that took a lot of time.
p84
aa(lp85
VI also tried to be the safest person I could be,
p86
aVbecause that's a part of health.
p87
aVI was inspired
p88
aVby the Danish Safety Council.
p89
aVThey started a public campaign
p90
aVthat says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."
p91
aVSo they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,
p92
aVbut also for walking around.
p93
aVAnd you can see there
p94
aVthey're shopping with their helmets.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVWell yeah, I tried that.
p97
aVNow it's a little extreme, I admit.
p98
aVBut if you think about this,
p99
aVthis is actually \u2014 the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this \u2014
p100
aVthat more people die on a per mile basis
p101
aVfrom drunk walking
p102
aVthan from drunk driving.
p103
aVSo something to think about tonight
p104
aVif you've had a couple.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I finished,
p107
aVand it was a success in a sense.
p108
aVAll of the markers went in the right direction.
p109
aVMy cholesterol went down, I lost weight,
p110
aVmy wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.
p111
aVSo that was nice.
p112
aVAnd it was successful overall.
p113
aVBut I also learned that I was too healthy,
p114
aVand that was unhealthy.
p115
aVI was so focused on doing all these things
p116
aVthat I was neglecting my friends and family.
p117
aVAnd as Dan Buettner can tell you,
p118
aVhaving a strong social network
p119
aVis so crucial to our health.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo I finished.
p122
aVAnd I kind of went overboard
p123
aVon the week after the project was over.
p124
aVI went to the dark side,
p125
aVand I just indulged myself.
p126
aVIt was like something out of Caligula.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVWithout the sex part.
p129
aVBecause I have three young kids,
p130
aVso that wasn't happening.
p131
aVBut the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.
p132
aVAnd I finally have stabilized.
p133
aVSo now I'm back
p134
aVto adopting many \u2014 not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore \u2014
p135
aVbut dozens of healthy behaviors
p136
aVthat I adopted during my year.
p137
aVIt was really a life-changing project.
p138
aVAnd I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.
p139
aVLet me just tell you two really quickly.
p140
aa(lp141
VThe first is \u2014 and this was surprising to me;
p142
aVI didn't expect this to come out \u2014
p143
aVbut I live a much quieter life now.
p144
aVBecause we live in such a noisy world.
p145
aVThere's trains and planes and cars
p146
aVand Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVAnd this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard \u2014
p149
aVnot just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does,
p150
aVbut it actually initiates
p151
aVthe fight-or-flight response.
p152
aVA loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.
p153
aVAnd this, over the years,
p154
aVcan cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.
p155
aVThe World Health Organization just did a big study
p156
aVthat they published this year.
p157
aVAnd it was done in Europe.
p158
aVAnd they estimated
p159
aVthat 1.6 million years of healthy living
p160
aVare lost every year in Europe
p161
aVbecause of noise pollution.
p162
aVSo they think it's actually very deadly.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd by the way,
p165
aVit's also terrible for your brain.
p166
aVIt really impairs cognition.
p167
aVAnd our Founding Fathers knew about this.
p168
aVWhen they wrote the Constitution,
p169
aVthey put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall
p170
aVso that they could concentrate.
p171
aVSo without noise reduction technology,
p172
aVour country would not exist.
p173
aVSo as a patriot,
p174
aVI felt it was important to \u2014
p175
aVI wear all the earplugs and the earphones,
p176
aVand it's really improved my life
p177
aVin a surprising and unexpected way.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd the second point I want to make, the final point,
p180
aVis that \u2014 and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED \u2014
p181
aVthat joy is so important to your health,
p182
aVthat very few of these behaviors
p183
aVwill stick with me
p184
aVunless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.
p185
aVAnd just to give you one instance of this:
p186
aVfood.
p187
aVThe junk food industry
p188
aVis really great
p189
aVat pressing our pleasure buttons
p190
aVand figuring out what's the most pleasurable.
p191
aVBut I think we can use their techniques
p192
aVand apply them to healthy food.
p193
aVTo give just one example,
p194
aVwe love crunchiness, mouthfeel.
p195
aVSo I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness
p196
aVinto a lot of my recipes \u2014
p197
aVthrow in some sunflower seeds.
p198
aVAnd you can almost trick yourself
p199
aVinto thinking you're eating Doritos.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVAnd it has made me a healthier person.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo that is it.
p204
aVThe book about it comes out in April.
p205
aVIt's called "Drop Dead Healthy."
p206
aVAnd I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.
p207
aVThat's my greatest hope.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo thank you very much.

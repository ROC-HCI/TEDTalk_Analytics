V2014 is a very special year for me:
p5
aV20 years as a consultant,
p6
aV20 years of marriage,
p7
aVand I'm turning 50 in one month.
p8
aVThat means I was born in 1964 in a small town in Germany.
p9
aa(lp10
VIt was a gray November day,
p11
aVand I was overdue.
p12
aVThe hospital's maternity ward was really stressed out
p13
aVbecause a lot of babies were born on this gray November day.
p14
aVAs a matter of fact,
p15
aV1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in Germany:
p16
aVmore than 1.3 million.
p17
aVLast year, we just hit over 600,000,
p18
aVso half of my number.
p19
aa(lp20
VWhat you can see here is the German age pyramid,
p21
aVand there, the small black point at the top, that's me.
p22
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p23
aVIn red, you can see the potential working-age population,
p24
aVso people over 15 and under 65,
p25
aVand I'm actually only interested in this red area.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, let's do a simple simulation
p28
aVof how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years.
p29
aVAs you can see,
p30
aVthe peak is moving to the right,
p31
aVand I, with many other baby boomers, will retire in 2030.
p32
aVBy the way, I don't need any forecasts
p33
aVof birth rates for predicting this red area.
p34
aVThe red area,
p35
aVso the potential working-age population in 2030,
p36
aVis already set in stone today,
p37
aVexcept for much higher migration rates.
p38
aVAnd if you compare this red area in 2030 with the red area in 2014,
p39
aVit is much, much smaller.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo before I show you the rest of the world,
p42
aVwhat does this mean for Germany?
p43
aVSo what we know from this picture is that the labor supply,
p44
aVso people who provide labor,
p45
aVwill go down in Germany, and will go down significantly.
p46
aVNow, what about labor demand?
p47
aVThat's where it gets tricky.
p48
aVAs you might know, the consultant's favorite answer to any question is,
p49
aV"It depends."
p50
aVSo I would say it depends.
p51
aVWe didn't want to forecast the future.
p52
aVHighly speculative.
p53
aVWe did something else.
p54
aVWe looked at the GDP and productivity growth of Germany
p55
aVover the last 20 years,
p56
aVand calculated the following scenario:
p57
aVif Germany wants to continue this GDP and productivity growth,
p58
aVwe could directly calculate
p59
aVhow many people Germany would need to support this growth.
p60
aVAnd this is the green line: labor demand.
p61
aVSo Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly.
p62
aVEight million people are missing,
p63
aVwhich is more than 20 percent of our current workforce,
p64
aVso big numbers, really big numbers.
p65
aVAnd we calculated several scenarios,
p66
aVand the picture always looked like this.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, to close the gap,
p69
aVGermany has to significantly increase migration,
p70
aVget many more women in the workforce,
p71
aVincrease retirement age \u2014
p72
aVby the way, we just lowered it this year \u2014
p73
aVand all these measures at once.
p74
aVIf Germany fails here, Germany will stagnate.
p75
aVWe won't grow anymore. Why?
p76
aVBecause the workers are not there who can generate this growth.
p77
aVAnd companies will look for talents somewhere else.
p78
aVBut where?
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, we simulated labor supply and labor demand
p81
aVfor the largest 15 economies in the world,
p82
aVrepresenting more than 70 percent of world GDP,
p83
aVand the overall picture looks like this by 2020.
p84
aVBlue indicates a labor surplus,
p85
aVred indicates a labor shortfall,
p86
aVand gray are those countries which are borderline.
p87
aVSo by 2020, we still see a labor surplus in some countries,
p88
aVlike Italy, France, the U.S.,
p89
aVbut this picture will change dramatically by 2030.
p90
aVBy 2030, we will face a global workforce crisis
p91
aVin most of our largest economies,
p92
aVincluding three out of the four BRIC countries.
p93
aVChina, with its former one-child policy, will be hit,
p94
aVas well as Brazil and Russia.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, to tell the truth,
p97
aVin reality, the situation will be even more challenging.
p98
aVWhat you can see here are average numbers.
p99
aVWe de-averaged them
p100
aVand broke them down into different skill levels,
p101
aVand what we found
p102
aVwere even higher shortfalls for high-skilled people
p103
aVand a partial surplus for low-skilled workers.
p104
aVSo on top of an overall labor shortage,
p105
aVwe will face a big skill mismatch in the future,
p106
aVand this means huge challenges
p107
aVin terms of education, qualification,
p108
aVupskilling for governments and companies.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, the next thing we looked into was robots, automation, technology.
p111
aVWill technology change this picture and boost productivity?
p112
aVNow, the short answer would be
p113
aVthat our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity
p114
aVdriven by technology.
p115
aVA long answer would go like this.
p116
aVLet's take Germany again.
p117
aVThe Germans have a certain reputation in the world
p118
aVwhen it comes to productivity.
p119
aVIn the '90s, I worked in our Boston office for almost two years,
p120
aVand when I left, an old senior partner told me, literally,
p121
aV"Send me more of these Germans, they work like machines."
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVThat was 1998.
p124
aVSixteen years later, you'd probably say the opposite.
p125
aV"Send me more of these machines. They work like Germans."
p126
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VTechnology will replace a lot of jobs, regular jobs.
p129
aVNot only in the production industry,
p130
aVbut even office workers are in jeopardy
p131
aVand might be replaced by robots,
p132
aVartificial intelligence, big data, or automation.
p133
aVSo the key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs,
p134
aVbut when, how fast, and to what extent?
p135
aVOr in other words,
p136
aVwill technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis?
p137
aVYes and no.
p138
aVThis is a more sophisticated version of "it depends."
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VLet's take the automotive industry as an example,
p142
aVbecause there, more than 40 percent of industrial robots are already working
p143
aVand automation has already taken place.
p144
aVIn 1980, less than 10 percent of the production cost of a car
p145
aVwas caused by electronic parts.
p146
aVToday, this number is more than 30 percent
p147
aVand it will grow to more than 50 percent by 2030.
p148
aVAnd these new electronic parts and applications
p149
aVrequire new skills and have created a lot of new jobs,
p150
aVlike the cognitive systems engineer
p151
aVwho optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system.
p152
aVIn 1980, no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist.
p153
aVAs a matter of fact,
p154
aVthe overall number of people involved in the production of a car
p155
aVhas only changed slightly in the last decades,
p156
aVin spite of robots and automation.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo what does this mean?
p159
aVYes, technology will replace a lot of jobs,
p160
aVbut we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon,
p161
aVand that means technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch.
p162
aVAnd this kind of de-averaging
p163
aVreveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo people, high-skilled people,
p166
aVtalents, will be the big thing in the next decade.
p167
aVIf they are the scarce resource, we have to understand them much better.
p168
aVAre they actually willing to work abroad?
p169
aVWhat are their job preferences?
p170
aa(lp171
VTo find out, this year we conducted a global survey
p172
aVamong more than 200,000 job seekers from 189 countries.
p173
aVMigration is certainly one key measure to close a gap,
p174
aVat least in the short term,
p175
aVso we asked about mobility.
p176
aVMore than 60 percent of these 200,000 job seekers
p177
aVare willing to work abroad.
p178
aVFor me, a surprisingly high number.
p179
aVIf you look at the employees aged 21 to 30,
p180
aVthis number is even higher.
p181
aVIf you split this number up by country,
p182
aVyes, the world is mobile, but only partly.
p183
aVThe least mobile countries are Russia, Germany and the U.S.
p184
aVNow where would these people like to move?
p185
aVNumber seven is Australia, where 28 percent could imagine moving.
p186
aVThen France, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, U.K.,
p187
aVand the top choice worldwide is the U.S.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow, what are the job preferences of these 200,000 people?
p190
aVSo, what are they looking for?
p191
aVOut of a list of 26 topics, salary is only number eight.
p192
aVThe top four topics are all around culture.
p193
aVNumber four,
p194
aVhaving a great relationship with the boss;
p195
aVthree, enjoying a great work-life balance;
p196
aVtwo, having a great relationship with colleagues;
p197
aVand the top priority worldwide
p198
aVis being appreciated for your work.
p199
aVSo, do I get a thank you?
p200
aVNot only once a year with the annual bonus payment,
p201
aVbut every day.
p202
aVAnd now, our global workforce crisis becomes very personal.
p203
aVPeople are looking for recognition.
p204
aVAren't we all looking for recognition in our jobs?
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, let me connect the dots.
p207
aVWe will face a global workforce crisis
p208
aVwhich consists of an overall labor shortage
p209
aVplus a huge skill mismatch,
p210
aVplus a big cultural challenge.
p211
aVAnd this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast.
p212
aVRight now, we are just at the turning point.
p213
aVSo what can we, what can governments, what can companies do?
p214
aVEvery company,
p215
aVbut also every country,
p216
aVneeds a people strategy,
p217
aVand to act on it immediately,
p218
aVand such a people strategy consists of four parts.
p219
aVNumber one, a plan
p220
aVfor how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills.
p221
aVWorkforce planning will become  more important than financial planning.
p222
aVTwo, a plan for how to attract great people:
p223
aVgeneration Y, women, but also retirees.
p224
aVThree, a plan for how to educate and upskill them.
p225
aVThere's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us.
p226
aVAnd four,
p227
aVfor how to retain the best people,
p228
aVor in other words,
p229
aVhow to realize an appreciation and relationship culture.
p230
aa(lp231
VHowever, one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes.
p232
aVEmployees are resources, are assets,
p233
aVnot costs, not head counts,
p234
aVnot machines,
p235
aVnot even the Germans.
p236
aa(lp237
VThank you.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)

VThis is actually a painting
p5
aVthat hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School.
p6
aVAnd it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted.
p7
aVIn the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray
p8
aVgetting the patient ready for the transplant,
p9
aVwhile in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison,
p10
aVthe Chief of Urology at Harvard,
p11
aVactually harvesting the kidney.
p12
aVThe kidney was indeed the first organ
p13
aVever to be transplanted to the human.
p14
aa(lp15
VThat was back in 1954,
p16
aV55 years ago.
p17
aVYet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges
p18
aVas many decades ago.
p19
aVCertainly many advances, many lives saved.
p20
aVBut we have a major shortage of organs.
p21
aVIn the last decade the number of patients
p22
aVwaiting for a transplant has doubled.
p23
aVWhile, at the same time, the actual number of transplants
p24
aVhas remained almost entirely flat.
p25
aVThat really has to do with our aging population.
p26
aVWe're just getting older.
p27
aVMedicine is doing a better job
p28
aVof keeping us alive.
p29
aVBut as we age, our organs tend to fail more.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, that's a challenge,
p32
aVnot just for organs but also for tissues.
p33
aVTrying to replace pancreas,
p34
aVtrying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's.
p35
aVThese are major issues.
p36
aVThis is actually a very stunning statistic.
p37
aVEvery 30 seconds
p38
aVa patient dies from diseases
p39
aVthat could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement.
p40
aVSo, what can we do about it?
p41
aVWe've talked about stem cells tonight.
p42
aVThat's a way to do it.
p43
aVBut still ways to go to get stem cells into patients,
p44
aVin terms of actual therapies for organs.
p45
aa(lp46
VWouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate?
p47
aVWouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power
p48
aVof our bodies, to actually heal ourselves?
p49
aVIt's not really that foreign of a concept, actually;
p50
aVit happens on the Earth every day.
p51
aVThis is actually a picture of a salamander.
p52
aVSalamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate.
p53
aVYou see here a little video.
p54
aVThis is actually a limb injury in this salamander.
p55
aVAnd this is actually real photography,
p56
aVtimed photography, showing how that limb regenerates
p57
aVin a period of days.
p58
aVYou see the scar form.
p59
aVAnd that scar actually grows out
p60
aVa new limb.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, salamanders can do it.
p63
aVWhy can't we? Why can't humans regenerate?
p64
aVActually, we can regenerate.
p65
aVYour body has many organs
p66
aVand every single organ in your body
p67
aVhas a cell population
p68
aVthat's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day.
p69
aVAs you age, as you get older.
p70
aVYour bones regenerate every 10 years.
p71
aVYour skin regenerates every two weeks.
p72
aVSo, your body is constantly regenerating.
p73
aVThe challenge occurs when there is an injury.
p74
aVAt the time of injury or disease,
p75
aVthe body's first reaction
p76
aVis to seal itself off from the rest of the body.
p77
aVIt basically wants to fight off infection,
p78
aVand seal itself, whether it's organs inside your body,
p79
aVor your skin, the first reaction
p80
aVis for scar tissue to move in,
p81
aVto seal itself off from the outside.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo, how can we harness that power?
p84
aVOne of the ways that we do that
p85
aVis actually by using smart biomaterials.
p86
aVHow does this work? Well, on the left side here
p87
aVyou see a urethra which was injured.
p88
aVThis is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.
p89
aVAnd you see that it is injured.
p90
aVWe basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials
p91
aVthat you can actually use as a bridge.
p92
aVIf you build that bridge, and you close off
p93
aVfrom the outside environment,
p94
aVthen you can create that bridge, and cells
p95
aVthat regenerate in your body,
p96
aVcan then cross that bridge, and take that path.
p97
aa(lp98
VThat's exactly what you see here.
p99
aVIt's actually a smart biomaterial
p100
aVthat we used, to actually treat this patient.
p101
aVThis was an injured urethra on the left side.
p102
aVWe used that biomaterial in the middle.
p103
aVAnd then, six months later on the right-hand side
p104
aVyou see this reengineered urethra.
p105
aVTurns out your body can regenerate,
p106
aVbut only for small distances.
p107
aVThe maximum efficient distance for regeneration
p108
aVis only about one centimeter.
p109
aVSo, we can use these smart biomaterials
p110
aVbut only for about one centimeter
p111
aVto bridge those gaps.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo, we do regenerate, but for limited distances.
p114
aVWhat do we do now,
p115
aVif you have injury for larger organs?
p116
aVWhat do we do when we have injuries
p117
aVfor structures which are much larger
p118
aVthan one centimeter?
p119
aVThen we can start to use cells.
p120
aVThe strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us
p121
aVwith a diseased or injured organ,
p122
aVyou can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ,
p123
aVless than half the size of a postage stamp,
p124
aVyou can then tease that tissue apart,
p125
aVand look at its basic components,
p126
aVthe patient's own cells,
p127
aVyou take those cells out,
p128
aVgrow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities,
p129
aVand then we then use scaffold materials.
p130
aa(lp131
VTo the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse,
p132
aVor your shirt, but actually
p133
aVthese materials are fairly complex
p134
aVand they are designed to degrade once inside the body.
p135
aVIt disintegrates a few months later.
p136
aVIt's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle.
p137
aVIt's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing
p138
aVthe cells to regenerate new tissue,
p139
aVand once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd that's what we did for this piece of muscle.
p142
aVThis is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through
p143
aVthe structures to actually engineer the muscle.
p144
aVWe take the cells, we expand them,
p145
aVwe place the cells on the scaffold,
p146
aVand we then place the scaffold back into the patient.
p147
aVBut actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient,
p148
aVwe actually exercise it.
p149
aVWe want to make sure that we condition
p150
aVthis muscle, so that it knows what to do
p151
aVonce we put it into the patient.
p152
aVThat's what you're seeing here. You're seeing
p153
aVthis muscle bio-reactor
p154
aVactually exercising the muscle back and forth.
p155
aa(lp156
VOkay. These are flat structures that we see here,
p157
aVthe muscle.
p158
aVWhat about other structures?
p159
aVThis is actually an engineered blood vessel.
p160
aVVery similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex.
p161
aVHere we take a scaffold,
p162
aVand we basically \u2014 scaffold can be like a piece of paper here.
p163
aVAnd we can then tubularize this scaffold.
p164
aVAnd what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy.
p165
aVA blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.
p166
aVWe take muscle cells, we paste,
p167
aVor coat the outside with these muscle cells,
p168
aVvery much like baking a layer cake, if you will.
p169
aa(lp170
VYou place the muscle cells on the outside.
p171
aVYou place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside.
p172
aVYou now have your fully seeded scaffold.
p173
aVYou're going to place this in an oven-like device.
p174
aVIt has the same conditions as a human body,
p175
aV37 degrees centigrade,
p176
aV95 percent oxygen.
p177
aVYou then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered.
p180
aVThis is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain.
p181
aVAnd this is an X-ray showing you
p182
aVthe patent, functional blood vessel.
p183
aVMore complex structures
p184
aVsuch as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you,
p185
aVthey're definitely more complex
p186
aVbecause you're introducing two different cell types.
p187
aVBut they are really acting mostly as conduits.
p188
aVYou're allowing fluid or air to go through
p189
aVat steady states.
p190
aVThey are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.
p191
aVHollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity,
p192
aVbecause you're asking these organs to act on demand.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo, the bladder is one such organ.
p195
aVSame strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder,
p196
aVless than half the size of a postage stamp.
p197
aVWe then tease the tissue apart
p198
aVinto its two individual cell components,
p199
aVmuscle, and these bladder specialized cells.
p200
aVWe grow the cells outside the body in large quantities.
p201
aVIt takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ.
p202
aVWe then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.
p203
aVWe coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.
p204
aVWe coat the outside with these muscle cells.
p205
aVWe place it back into this oven-like device.
p206
aVFrom the time you take that piece of tissue, six to eight weeks later
p207
aVyou can put the organ right back into the patient.
p208
aa(lp209
VThis actually shows the scaffold.
p210
aVThe material is actually being coated with the cells.
p211
aVWhen we did the first clinical trial for these patients
p212
aVwe actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.
p213
aVWe brought patients in,
p214
aVsix to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays,
p215
aVand we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size
p216
aVpelvic cavity.
p217
aVFor the second phase of the trials
p218
aVwe just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large.
p219
aV(Laughter)
p220
aVIt's true.
p221
aVAnd I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large. Right?
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VSo, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex
p225
aVthan the other structures.
p226
aVBut there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.
p227
aVThis is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.
p228
aVAnd the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.
p229
aVWe take the scaffold, we seed it with cells,
p230
aVand you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.
p231
aVWe exercise these prior to implantation.
p232
aVSame strategy.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd then the most complex are the solid organs.
p235
aVFor solid organs, they're more complex
p236
aVbecause you're using a lot more cells per centimeter.
p237
aVThis is actually a simple solid organ like the ear.
p238
aVIt's now being seeded with cartilage.
p239
aVThat's the oven-like device;
p240
aVonce it's coated it gets placed there.
p241
aVAnd then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold.
p242
aa(lp243
VThis is actually digits that we're engineering.
p244
aVThese are being layered, one layer at a time,
p245
aVfirst the bone, we fill in the gaps with cartilage.
p246
aVWe then start adding the muscle on top.
p247
aVAnd you start layering these solid structures.
p248
aVAgain, fairly more complex organs,
p249
aVbut by far, the most complex solid organs
p250
aVare actually the vascularized, highly vascularized,
p251
aVa lot of blood vessel supply,
p252
aVorgans such as the heart,
p253
aVthe liver, the kidneys.
p254
aVThis is actually an example \u2014 several strategies
p255
aVto engineer solid organs.
p256
aa(lp257
VThis is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer.
p258
aVAnd instead of using ink, we use \u2014 you just saw an inkjet cartridge \u2014
p259
aVwe just use cells.
p260
aVThis is actually your typical desktop printer.
p261
aVIt's actually printing this two chamber heart,
p262
aVone layer at a time.
p263
aVYou see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print,
p264
aVand about four to six hours later
p265
aVyou see the muscle cells contract.
p266
aV(Applause)
p267
aVThis technology was developed by Tao Ju, who worked at our institute.
p268
aVAnd this is actually still, of course, experimental,
p269
aVnot for use in patients.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnother strategy that we have followed
p272
aVis actually to use decellularized organs.
p273
aVWe actually take donor organs,
p274
aVorgans that are discarded,
p275
aVand we then can use very mild detergents
p276
aVto take all the cell elements out of these organs.
p277
aVSo, for example on the left panel,
p278
aVtop panel, you see a liver.
p279
aVWe actually take the donor liver,
p280
aVwe use very mild detergents,
p281
aVand we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells
p282
aVout of the liver.
p283
aa(lp284
VTwo weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up,
p285
aVit feels like a liver,
p286
aVwe can hold it like a liver,
p287
aVit looks like a liver, but it has no cells.
p288
aVAll we are left with
p289
aVis the skeleton, if you will, of the liver,
p290
aVall made up of collagen,
p291
aVa material that's in our bodies, that will not reject.
p292
aVWe can use it from one patient to the next.
p293
aVWe then take this vascular structure
p294
aVand we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply.
p295
aa(lp296
VYou can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy.
p297
aVWe're actually injecting contrast into the organ.
p298
aVNow you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ
p299
aVinto this decellularized liver.
p300
aVAnd you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.
p301
aVWe then take the cells, the vascular cells,
p302
aVblood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree
p303
aVwith the patient's own cells.
p304
aVWe perfuse the outside of the liver
p305
aVwith the patient's own liver cells.
p306
aVAnd we can then create functional livers.
p307
aVAnd that's actually what you're seeing.
p308
aVThis is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality
p309
aVof the liver structure, experimentally.
p310
aa(lp311
VFor the kidney,
p312
aVas I talked to you about the first painting that you saw,
p313
aVthe first slide I showed you,
p314
aV90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list
p315
aVare waiting for a kidney, 90 percent.
p316
aVSo, another strategy we're following
p317
aVis actually to create wafers
p318
aVthat we stack together, like an accordion, if you will.
p319
aVSo, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells.
p320
aVAnd then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered.
p321
aVThey are actually making urine.
p322
aVAgain, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger,
p323
aVand that is something we're working on
p324
aVright now at the institute.
p325
aVOne of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then
p326
aVis what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine.
p327
aa(lp328
VIf at all possible,
p329
aVwe really would like to use smart biomaterials
p330
aVthat we can just take off the shelf
p331
aVand regenerate your organs.
p332
aVWe are limited with distances right now,
p333
aVbut our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.
p334
aVIf we cannot use smart biomaterials,
p335
aVthen we'd rather use your very own cells.
p336
aa(lp337
VWhy? Because they will not reject.
p338
aVWe can take cells from you,
p339
aVcreate the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject.
p340
aVAnd if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ.
p341
aVIf you present with a diseased wind pipe
p342
aVwe'd like to take cells from your windpipe.
p343
aVIf you present with a diseased pancreas
p344
aVwe'd like to take cells from that organ.
p345
aa(lp346
VWhy? Because we'd rather take those cells
p347
aVwhich already know that those are the cell types you want.
p348
aVA windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.
p349
aVWe don't need to teach it to become another cell type.
p350
aVSo, we prefer organ-specific cells.
p351
aVAnd today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body,
p352
aVexcept for several which we still need stem cells for,
p353
aVlike heart, liver, nerve and pancreas.
p354
aVAnd for those we still need stem cells.
p355
aVIf we cannot use stem cells from your body
p356
aVthen we'd like to use donor stem cells.
p357
aVAnd we prefer cells that will not reject
p358
aVand will not form tumors.
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd we're working a lot with the stem cells that we
p361
aVpublished on two years ago,
p362
aVstem cells from the amniotic fluid,
p363
aVand the placenta, which have those properties.
p364
aVSo, at this point, I do want to tell you that
p365
aVsome of the major challenges we have.
p366
aVYou know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good,
p367
aVeverything works. Actually no,
p368
aVthese technologies really are not that easy.
p369
aVSome of the work you saw today
p370
aVwas performed by over 700 researchers
p371
aVat our institute across a 20-year time span.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo, these are very tough technologies.
p374
aVOnce you get the formula right you can replicate it.
p375
aVBut it takes a lot to get there.
p376
aVSo, I always like to show this cartoon.
p377
aVThis is how to stop a runaway stage.
p378
aVAnd there you see the stagecoach driver,
p379
aVand he goes, on the top panel,
p380
aVHe goes A, B, C, D, E, F.
p381
aVHe finally stops the runaway stage.
p382
aVAnd those are usually the basic scientists,
p383
aVThe bottom is usually the surgeons.
p384
aV(Laughter)
p385
aVI'm a surgeon so that's not that funny.
p386
aV(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VBut actually method A is the correct approach.
p389
aVAnd what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies
p390
aVto the clinic,
p391
aVwe've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can
p392
aVin the laboratory before we ever
p393
aVlaunch these technologies to patients.
p394
aVAnd when we launch these technologies to patients
p395
aVwe want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.
p396
aVAre you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child,
p397
aVyour own family member, and then we proceed.
p398
aVBecause our main goal, of course,
p399
aVis first, to do no harm.
p400
aa(lp401
VI'm going to show you now, a very short clip,
p402
aVIt's a five second clip of a patient
p403
aVwho received one of the engineered organs.
p404
aVWe started implanting some of these structures
p405
aVover 14 years ago.
p406
aVSo, we have patients now walking around with organs,
p407
aVengineered organs, for over 10 years, as well.
p408
aVI'm going to show a clip of one young lady.
p409
aVShe had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality.
p410
aVShe did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN.
p411
aVWe are just taking five seconds.
p412
aVThis is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of.
p413
aa(lp414
VVideo: Kaitlyn M: I'm happy. I was always afraid
p415
aVthat I was going to have like, an accident or something.
p416
aVAnd now I can just go and
p417
aVgo out with my friends,
p418
aVgo do whatever I want.
p419
aa(lp420
VAnthony Atala: See, at the end of the day, the promise of regenerative medicine
p421
aVis a single promise.
p422
aVAnd that is really very simple,
p423
aVto make our patients better.
p424
aVThank you for your attention.

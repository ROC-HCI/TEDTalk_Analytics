VMy favorite topic is
p5
aVshortcuts.
p6
aVThe master of shortcuts \u2014 it's, of course, nature.
p7
aVBut I will demonstrate
p8
aVdifferent ways to get
p9
aVrid of difficulties and go to the point,
p10
aVto find an answer
p11
aVprobably much quicker than Arthur did. So,
p12
aVfirst,
p13
aVwe violate the common sense,
p14
aVthe logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this,
p15
aV90 degrees \u2014
p16
aVall of you. Not you.
p17
aVAll of you, right? Palm up.
p18
aVIf you do this,
p19
aVthe common, the logic says you must turn the wrist.
p20
aVDo you agree?
p21
aVGood.
p22
aVBut I will first teach you
p23
aVa method, how you can do it without
p24
aVmoving the wrist, and then the shortcut.
p25
aVYou can do it immediately, right?
p26
aVHold the hand like this, palm up.
p27
aVDon't move the wrist. The wrist is \u2014
p28
aVI doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are.
p29
aVRight-molded you say, with iron?
p30
aVThat was a joke, actually,
p31
aVand I \u2014
p32
aVOK.
p33
aVHold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist.
p34
aVOver the heart, don't move the wrist.
p35
aVForward, don't move the wrist.
p36
aVUp, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist.
p37
aVAnd forward. Yeah.
p38
aVNow \u2014
p39
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p40
aVlogic, logically,
p41
aVyou have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVNow, the shortcut.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVBut it was six moves. Now with one move.
p46
aVI start here, palm down, you can follow.
p47
aVAnd then look at me.
p48
aVYeah! (Laughter)
p49
aVOne move. OK.
p50
aVSo,
p51
aVthat was the warming up.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow,
p54
aVI need an assistant.
p55
aVI talked to a nice girl before, Zoe.
p56
aVShe has left. No! A big hand.
p57
aV(Applause)
p58
aa(lp59
VGood. Nice. And you can sit over there.
p60
aVOne item here was water, right?
p61
aVAnd I will give my tribute
p62
aVto water.
p63
aVI think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about \u2014 cheers.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVBeer has about \u2014
p66
aVthere's a lot of water in beer.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VSo, now
p70
aVI will demonstrate different ways of
p71
aVmemorizing,
p72
aVcontrol cards and so on.
p73
aVAnd I think I'll take off this one.
p74
aVI work with a special
p75
aVmethod to do it, quick.
p76
aVI work with
p77
aVprecision \u2014 oh, sorry \u2014
p78
aVcontrol
p79
aVand
p80
aVa very powerful ...
p81
aVmemory system, right?
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVSo,
p84
aVif \u2014
p85
aVI have studied the poker. I like to gamble.
p86
aVOfficially, I don't gamble but ...
p87
aVSo, if we are \u2014
p88
aVif we have five person,
p89
aVand I will do a five-handed poker game.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow I will interact. So a different person
p92
aVall the time, so not the same person can answer.
p93
aVSo we have an agreement.
p94
aVWhich one shall have a good poker hand?
p95
aVWhich number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)
p96
aa(lp97
VLennart Green: Three \u2014 good.
p98
aVAnd
p99
aVhere,
p100
aVI had a mat here to make it a little \u2014
p101
aVthe critical moment is \u2014 sorry.
p102
aVIf a card shark gathers the cards together,
p103
aVimmediately when he \u2014
p104
aVbefore he deals the card. Now,
p105
aVso I think, number three,
p106
aVI have arranged them in a full house.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVWith queens and \u2014 it's OK \u2014
p109
aVqueens and tens.
p110
aVThat's a challenge. I like this.
p111
aVI will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.
p112
aVI start with three queens.
p113
aVSo here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.
p114
aVAnd two tens.
p115
aVYeah. Thank you.
p116
aV(Applause)
p117
aVBut also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too.
p118
aVSo these guys have actually a stronger hand \u2014
p119
aVthree aces and two kings.
p120
aVThis guy beats them with
p121
aVfour of a kind, or deuce \u2014 deuce.
p122
aVNo reaction? That with even \u2014
p123
aVOK, and this.
p124
aVThese look in order, I'm probably \u2014 hopefully \u2014
p125
aVyeah. Three, four, five, six, seven
p126
aVand ...
p127
aVBut, of course, I will have the winning hand.
p128
aVTen, jack,
p129
aVqueen, king, ace.
p130
aVYeah. So,
p131
aVgood.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVSo the hand that looks so good from the beginning,
p134
aVnumber three, at the end
p135
aVwas actually the lowest hand.
p136
aVSuch life. Right?
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, please mix them.
p139
aVNow, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some
p140
aVunderground techniques.
p141
aVYes?
p142
aVI work with
p143
aVkind of estimation,
p144
aVshuffle tracking \u2014
p145
aVah, good.
p146
aVImpressive. Thank you.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VSo, first,
p150
aVthe first term is estimation.
p151
aVHere, I can estimate exactly how many cards
p152
aVare put between
p153
aVmy royal flush.
p154
aVOf course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker.
p155
aVRight? You agree.
p156
aVSo here I have, actually \u2014
p157
aVI know exactly where the cards are.
p158
aVSo here, I can make a bet,
p159
aVand this is actually one of the points where I get my money.
p160
aVSo here: 10, jack,
p161
aVqueen, king, ace.
p162
aVOK.
p163
aV(Applause)
p164
aa(lp165
VNext
p166
aVis a term \u2014
p167
aVI do it quick. I call this stealing.
p168
aVSo here, I think
p169
aVI know about where the cards are.
p170
aVI will spread the cards and you'll say stop,
p171
aVwhen I point to them, right. Point, say stop.
p172
aa(lp173
VZoe: Stop.
p174
aa(lp175
VLG: Here \u2014 you see some are missing?
p176
aVAnd that's the stealing cards, which I did.
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VOK.
p180
aVNow, another term called shuffle tracking.
p181
aVShuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,
p182
aVeven if another person shuffles.
p183
aVThis is a little risky.
p184
aVSo \u2014 because if you look, now, I can still see it.
p185
aVYou agree? But if you square \u2014
p186
aVsquare, and shuffle,
p187
aVand then a cut.
p188
aVSo here,
p189
aVto follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin \u2014
p190
aVah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.
p191
aVCome to \u2014 no, no, no, no.
p192
aVI'm joking, yeah?
p193
aVAny style \u2014 yeah, good.
p194
aVHere I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.
p195
aVI work direct with the right brain.
p196
aVIf you pass the left brain,
p197
aVyou have to take care of logic and common sense.
p198
aVDirect in the right brain, that's much better. And so \u2014
p199
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p200
aVArthur Benjamin did
p201
aVa little of the same thing.
p202
aVAnd if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,
p203
aVyou have \u2014 that's the password
p204
aVto the
p205
aVcosmic bank of knowledge,
p206
aVwhere you can find any solution of any problem.
p207
aa(lp208
VOK. Now, I drop the cards,
p209
aVand you say stop anyway, right?
p210
aVNot at the last card.
p211
aa(lp212
VZoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.
p213
aa(lp214
VWhen I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aVAh, not in order, it \u2014 that was a mistake.
p217
aVNo, I'm kidding.
p218
aV(Applause)
p219
aVNo, now and then I put in a mistake,
p220
aVjust to emphasize how difficult it is.
p221
aVRight?
p222
aVYeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.
p223
aVBut now I'm glad I remember it.
p224
aVSo,
p225
aVthis deck is bought here. Sorry.
p226
aVI have a little pad
p227
aVto make it a little softer.
p228
aVThis deck is bought here in America.
p229
aVIt's called
p230
aV"Bicycle." And this deck is very flexible,
p231
aVbut not so many people know,
p232
aVif you check, if you press at
p233
aVthe right spots,
p234
aVyou see how thin and flexible this deck is, right?
p235
aVNow, you can carry this in your wallet,
p236
aVso ...
p237
aVYou don't see it, make no reaction?
p238
aV(Laughter)
p239
aVSo, but here,
p240
aVand \u2014
p241
aVis the camera getting too much? No.
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VYeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)
p245
aa(lp246
VLG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this.
p247
aVBut not too much.
p248
aVThen you have to push it down again.
p249
aVHere, please. If you push these
p250
aVheaps \u2014 everyone see \u2014
p251
aVpush them together so they are really interlaced,
p252
aVright? Yeah, good.
p253
aVPerfect.
p254
aVJust push them through, good. Thank you.
p255
aVAnd then, I will demonstrate a thing from
p256
aVRussian satellite,
p257
aVstealen \u2014 stolen,
p258
aVprobably copied from America but we will see.
p259
aa(lp260
VHere \u2014
p261
aVshortcuts. I talk about shortcuts.
p262
aVNow I go very quick
p263
aVthrough the deck and try to find some pattern.
p264
aVThe new chaos theory is already old, right?
p265
aVBut you know, I think you are
p266
aVfamiliar with fractals \u2014
p267
aVthe Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.
p268
aVAnd it's much
p269
aVeasier to memorize cards in a pattern way,
p270
aVand not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate,
p271
aVthen you go to \u2014
p272
aVthen it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk
p273
aVin another language ...
p274
aVYeah, great.
p275
aVI think I have it.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo now, different persons, older, tap.
p278
aVPlease name any card, anyone.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.
p281
aa(lp282
VJack of spades.
p283
aVI think jack of spades is number 12 from the top.
p284
aVOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
p285
aVnine, 10, 11,
p286
aV12. Yes, right.
p287
aVSo \u2014 oh, jack of spades.
p288
aa(lp289
VYou said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah.
p290
aVMy fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs.
p291
aVSo, jack of spades.
p292
aVI think ...
p293
aV23 \u2014
p294
aV24, sorry, 24.
p295
aVOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
p296
aV10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
p297
aV18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
p298
aV23 \u2014
p299
aVah, 25, yes.
p300
aVIt's the last.
p301
aVNow, I do it quicker, better.
p302
aVOK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think \u2014
p303
aV(Laughter)
p304
aV\u2014 actually, my technique is to peek,
p305
aVall the time.
p306
aVWhen I lift the heap, I peek.
p307
aVYou see, yeah, perfect.
p308
aVThree, four, five, six. Then I calculate \u2014 yeah, good.
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VAnother person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)
p312
aa(lp313
VLG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven.
p314
aVSo I will do it quick,
p315
aVvery quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow.
p316
aV(Laughter)
p317
aa(lp318
VSeven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)
p319
aa(lp320
VLG: Diamonds, good. I start here.
p321
aVGood, thank you.
p322
aV(Applause)
p323
aVThe thing I did \u2014 I peeked.
p324
aVI know where the card were,
p325
aVthen I chose it. So another person, another card.
p326
aV(Laughter)
p327
aVAnother person.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)
p330
aVLG: Pardon?
p331
aV(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)
p332
aa(lp333
VLG: Ten of diamonds, yeah.
p334
aVI think I do it the same way. I like to,
p335
aVso I know where it is.
p336
aVTen of diamonds.
p337
aVBut now I do it the regular speed, right?
p338
aVTen of diamonds.
p339
aVGood.
p340
aVMaybe you will cut? Lift.
p341
aVExcellent.
p342
aVSo, thank you. Another person, another card.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Audience: Five of clubs.)
p345
aa(lp346
VLG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)
p347
aa(lp348
VLG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot.
p349
aVWe can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards.
p350
aVAnd you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it?
p351
aVFive of clubs.
p352
aVNot the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here.
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aVWe do it again.
p355
aVThe person who said five of clubs say stop,
p356
aVwhen the cards are in the air, right?
p357
aa(lp358
V(Audience: Stop.)
p359
aa(lp360
VLG: Very good.
p361
aVOK.
p362
aV(Applause)
p363
aa(lp364
VOK, I had to use a little force there.
p365
aVI think we save five of clubs.
p366
aVAnd now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.
p367
aa(lp368
V(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah.
p369
aVExcellent. I love that card.
p370
aVHere, I will do the most difficult thing.
p371
aVFor example, you are sitting in Las Vegas,
p372
aVand you're betting,
p373
aVand you let the other guys
p374
aVpeek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card.
p375
aVAnd now, when I lift this card,
p376
aVit shall be your card. What was your card?
p377
aa(lp378
V(Audience: Queen of hearts.)
p379
aa(lp380
VLG: Queen of? Queen of hearts.
p381
aVSo that's a tough challenge, right?
p382
aVSo here, I grab \u2014
p383
aVyou know this? Five of clubs ...
p384
aVand queen of hearts. Yes!
p385
aVThis is a tough one,
p386
aVbecause here I must take advantage of \u2014
p387
aVI switch it with the five of clubs.
p388
aVSo, now
p389
aVa false count.
p390
aVWhich card shall I use? Queen or five?
p391
aa(lp392
VZoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.
p393
aa(lp394
VSo, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs.
p395
aVThe false count \u2014 and the number
p396
aVone, two, three,
p397
aVfour, five, six, seven, eight \u2014
p398
aVyou say the same card all the time.
p399
aVEight, nine, 10.
p400
aVThis is a kind of optical deal, right?
p401
aVWhen I put one card at a table \u2014
p402
aVlook, it's not one card. It's \u2014 look,
p403
aVit's a bunch of cards that gives this
p404
aVimpression.
p405
aVYeah.
p406
aVNow some hard stuff.
p407
aVI think we keep the queen here, yes.
p408
aVNow, to the satellites things.
p409
aVThis \u2014
p410
aVoh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault.
p411
aV(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
VThis is high-frequency laser,
p414
aVand it's enough with a fraction of a second
p415
aVto destroy the retina completely.
p416
aVRight, sorry, my \u2014 I should have mentioned that, yeah.
p417
aVBut you can relax,
p418
aVbecause it takes half an hour before it works,
p419
aVso you have plenty of time to see my whole performance.
p420
aV(Laughter)
p421
aVNow,
p422
aVI put the laser here,
p423
aVand \u2014
p424
aVnow, when I deal the cards in the laser,
p425
aVI know where they are but \u2014 yes?
p426
aVDid the camera got it?
p427
aVNo?
p428
aVThey didn't?
p429
aVWhat happened?
p430
aa(lp431
V(Audience: It disappeared.)
p432
aa(lp433
VLG: OK, I'll take another group.
p434
aVDo the cameras see the cards now?
p435
aa(lp436
VNo? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)
p437
aa(lp438
VLG: But you see the hand.
p439
aVAh, good, good, good. But now.
p440
aVSo now, that was the reason, right?
p441
aVYou see the cards? Yes.
p442
aV(Laughter)
p443
aVYeah, good.
p444
aVNow \u2014
p445
aV(Laughter)
p446
aV\u2014 one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen,
p447
aVdo it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen.
p448
aV(Laughter)
p449
aVYeah, interesting,
p450
aVbut a little dangerous.
p451
aV(Laughter)
p452
aVI liked it. Now,
p453
aVa little more difficult.
p454
aVName \u2014 anyone, name, please, any suit.
p455
aa(lp456
V(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.
p457
aa(lp458
VSo here,
p459
aVhere I have to peek, lots of cards.
p460
aVI think there are lots of \u2014
p461
aVI don't know how many \u2014 but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right?
p462
aV(Laughter)
p463
aVSo every time I lift the heap, I peek, right.
p464
aVThen I arrange them so I can
p465
aVget them quick.
p466
aVPerfect, excellent.
p467
aVSo I start with the ace \u2014
p468
aVyeah, ace. Ah, yeah \u2014 spades?
p469
aVSame mistake as before, right?
p470
aVSo \u2014 I arrange the spades \u2014 the clubs.
p471
aVI try to do this right here. First, I take the spades.
p472
aVYou see, I don't work with prestige,
p473
aVso always do mistakes.
p474
aVIt doesn't matter to me.
p475
aVAnd now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right?
p476
aVOne,
p477
aVtwo, three, four \u2014 yes,
p478
aVthe camera got it? Five, six,
p479
aVseven, eight \u2014
p480
aVah \u2014
p481
aVnine, 10,
p482
aVthe jack,

aVArmani \u2014 who said Armani? You?

p549
aVI have to figure out so many outs,
p550
aVwhen I miss some cards, but
p551
aVI love it. So now,
p552
aVI will do it. I will try to find
p553
aVthe diamonds,
p554
aVbut I will do it the hard way.
p555
aVIt's too easy to do it right away, right?
p556
aVI think I will do it ...

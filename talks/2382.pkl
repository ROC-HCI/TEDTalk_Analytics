VIt's often said that you can tell a lot about a person
p5
aVby looking at what's on their bookshelves.
p6
aVWhat do my bookshelves say about me?
p7
aVWell, when I asked myself this question a few years ago,
p8
aVI made an alarming discovery.
p9
aVI'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured,
p10
aVcosmopolitan sort of person.
p11
aVBut my bookshelves told a rather different story.
p12
aVPretty much all the titles on them
p13
aVwere by British or North American authors,
p14
aVand there was almost nothing in translation.
p15
aVDiscovering this massive, cultural blind spot in my reading
p16
aVcame as quite a shock.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd when I thought about it, it seemed like a real shame.
p19
aVI knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there
p20
aVby writers working in languages other than English.
p21
aVAnd it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant
p22
aVI would probably never encounter them.
p23
aVSo, I decided to prescribe myself
p24
aVan intensive course of global reading.
p25
aV2012 was set to be a very international year for the UK;
p26
aVit was the year of the London Olympics.
p27
aVAnd so I decided to use it as my time frame
p28
aVto try to read a novel, short story collection
p29
aVor memoir from every country in the world.
p30
aVAnd so I did.
p31
aVAnd it was very exciting
p32
aVand I learned some remarkable things
p33
aVand made some wonderful connections
p34
aVthat I want to share with you today.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut it started with some practical problems.
p37
aVAfter I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world
p38
aVto use for my project,
p39
aVI ended up going with the list of UN-recognized nations,
p40
aVto which I added Taiwan,
p41
aVwhich gave me a total of 196 countries.
p42
aVAnd after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging
p43
aVabout, roughly, four books a week
p44
aVaround working five days a week,
p45
aa(lp46
VI then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able
p47
aVto get books in English from every country.
p48
aVOnly around 4.5 percent of the literary works published
p49
aVeach year in the UK are translations,
p50
aVand the figures are similar for much of the English-speaking world.
p51
aVAlthough, the proportion of translated books published
p52
aVin many other countries is a lot higher.
p53
aV4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,
p54
aVbut what that figure doesn't tell you
p55
aVis that many of those books will come from countries
p56
aVwith strong publishing networks
p57
aVand lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles
p58
aVto English-language publishers.
p59
aVSo, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French
p60
aVand published in the UK each year,
p61
aVmost of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland.
p62
aVFrench-speaking Africa, on the other hand,
p63
aVwill rarely ever get a look-in.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations
p66
aVthat may have little or even no commercially available literature
p67
aVin English.
p68
aVTheir books remain invisible to readers
p69
aVof the world's most published language.
p70
aVBut when it came to reading the world,
p71
aVthe biggest challenge of all for me
p72
aVwas that fact that I didn't know where to start.
p73
aVHaving spent my life reading almost exclusively British
p74
aVand North American books,
p75
aVI had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories
p76
aVand choosing them from much of the rest of the world.
p77
aVI couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland.
p78
aVI wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia.
p79
aVThere was no hiding it \u2014
p80
aVI was a clueless literary xenophobe.
p81
aVSo how on earth was I going to read the world?
p82
aa(lp83
VI was going to have to ask for help.
p84
aVSo in October 2011, I registered my blog,
p85
aVayearofreadingtheworld.com,
p86
aVand I posted a short appeal online.
p87
aVI explained who I was,
p88
aVhow narrow my reading had been,
p89
aVand I asked anyone who cared to
p90
aVto leave a message suggesting what I might read
p91
aVfrom other parts of the planet.
p92
aVNow, I had no idea whether anyone would be interested,
p93
aVbut within a few hours of me posting that appeal online,
p94
aVpeople started to get in touch.
p95
aVAt first, it was friends and colleagues.
p96
aVThen it was friends of friends.
p97
aVAnd pretty soon, it was strangers.
p98
aa(lp99
VFour days after I put that appeal online,
p100
aVI got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur.
p101
aVShe said she loved the sound of my project,
p102
aVcould she go to her local English-language bookshop
p103
aVand choose my Malaysian book and post it to me?
p104
aVI accepted enthusiastically,
p105
aVand a few weeks later,
p106
aVa package arrived containing not one, but two books \u2014
p107
aVRafidah's choice from Malaysia,
p108
aVand a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me.
p109
aVNow, at the time, I was amazed
p110
aVthat a stranger more than 6,000 miles away
p111
aVwould go to such lengths to help someone
p112
aVshe would probably never meet.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year.
p115
aVTime and again, people went out of their way to help me.
p116
aVSome took on research on my behalf,
p117
aVand others made detours on holidays and business trips
p118
aVto go to bookshops for me.
p119
aVIt turns out, if you want to read the world,
p120
aVif you want to encounter it with an open mind,
p121
aVthe world will help you.
p122
aVWhen it came to countries
p123
aVwith little or no commercially available literature in English,
p124
aVpeople went further still.
p125
aa(lp126
VBooks often came from surprising sources.
p127
aVMy Panamanian read, for example, came through a conversation
p128
aVI had with the Panama Canal on Twitter.
p129
aVYes, the Panama Canal has a Twitter account.
p130
aVAnd when I tweeted at it about my project,
p131
aVit suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work
p132
aVof the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan.
p133
aVI found Morgan's website and I sent him a message,
p134
aVasking if any of his Spanish-language novels
p135
aVhad been translated into English.
p136
aVAnd he said that nothing had been published,
p137
aVbut he did have an unpublished translation
p138
aVof his novel "The Golden Horse."
p139
aVHe emailed this to me,
p140
aVallowing me to become one of the first people ever
p141
aVto read that book in English.
p142
aa(lp143
VMorgan was by no means the only wordsmith
p144
aVto share his work with me in this way.
p145
aVFrom Sweden to Palau,
p146
aVwriters and translators sent me self-published books
p147
aVand unpublished manuscripts of books
p148
aVthat hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers
p149
aVor that were no longer available,
p150
aVgiving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds.
p151
aVI read, for example,
p152
aVabout the Southern African king Ngungunhane, who led the resistance
p153
aVagainst the Portuguese in the 19th century;
p154
aVand about marriage rituals in a remote village
p155
aVon the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan.
p156
aVI met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut perhaps the most amazing example
p163
aVof the lengths that people were prepared to go to
p164
aVto help me read the world,
p165
aVcame towards the end of my quest,
p166
aVwhen I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking
p167
aVAfrican island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe.
p168
aVNow, having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find
p169
aVa book that had been translated into English from the nation,
p170
aVit seemed as though the only option left to me
p171
aVwas to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch.
p172
aVNow, I was really dubious
p173
aVwhether anyone was going to want to help with this,
p174
aVand give up their time for something like that.
p175
aVBut, within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook
p176
aVfor Portuguese speakers,
p177
aVI had more people than I could involve in the project,
p178
aVincluding Margaret Jull Costa, a leader in her field,
p179
aVwho has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner José Saramago.
p180
aVWith my nine volunteers in place,
p181
aVI managed to find a book by a São Toméan author
p182
aVthat I could buy enough copies of online.
p183
aVHere's one of them.
p184
aVAnd I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers.
p185
aVThey all took on a couple of short stories from this collection,
p186
aVstuck to their word, sent their translations back to me,
p187
aVand within six weeks, I had the entire book to read.
p188
aa(lp189
VIn that case, as I found so often during my year of reading the world,
p190
aVmy not knowing and being open about my limitations
p191
aVhad become a big opportunity.
p192
aVWhen it came to São Tomé and Príncipe,
p193
aVit was a chance not only to learn something new
p194
aVand discover a new collection of stories,
p195
aVbut also to bring together a group of people
p196
aVand facilitate a joint creative endeavor.
p197
aVMy weakness had become the project's strength.
p198
aa(lp199
VThe books I read that year opened my eyes to many things.
p200
aVAs those who enjoy reading will know,
p201
aVbooks have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself
p202
aVand into someone else's mindset,
p203
aVso that, for a while at least,
p204
aVyou look at the world through different eyes.
p205
aVThat can be an uncomfortable experience,
p206
aVparticularly if you're reading a book
p207
aVfrom a culture that may have quite different values to your own.
p208
aVBut it can also be really enlightening.
p209
aVWrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking.
p210
aVAnd it can also show up blind spots
p211
aVin the way you might have been looking at the world.
p212
aa(lp213
VWhen I looked back at much of the English-language literature
p214
aVI'd grown up with, for example,
p215
aVI began to see how narrow a lot of it was,
p216
aVcompared to the richness that the world has to offer.
p217
aVAnd as the pages turned,
p218
aVsomething else started to happen, too.
p219
aVLittle by little,
p220
aVthat long list of countries that I'd started the year with, changed
p221
aVfrom a rather dry, academic register of place names
p222
aVinto living, breathing entities.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow, I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible
p225
aVto get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book.
p226
aVBut cumulatively, the stories I read that year
p227
aVmade me more alive than ever before
p228
aVto the richness, diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet.
p229
aVIt was as though the world's stories
p230
aVand the people who'd gone to such lengths to help me read them
p231
aVhad made it real to me.
p232
aVThese days, when I look at my bookshelves
p233
aVor consider the works on my e-reader,
p234
aVthey tell a rather different story.
p235
aVIt's the story of the power books have to connect us
p236
aVacross political, geographical, cultural, social, religious divides.
p237
aVIt's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd, it's testament
p240
aVto the extraordinary times we live in, where, thanks to the Internet,
p241
aVit's easier than ever before
p242
aVfor a stranger to share a story, a worldview, a book
p243
aVwith someone she may never meet, on the other side of the planet.
p244
aVI hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come.
p245
aVAnd I hope many more people will join me.
p246
aVIf we all read more widely, there'd be more incentive
p247
aVfor publishers to translate more books,
p248
aVand we would all be richer for that.
p249
aa(lp250
VThank you.

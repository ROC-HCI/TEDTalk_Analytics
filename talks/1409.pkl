VJust a moment ago,
p5
aVmy daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck.
p6
aVHer text said,
p7
aV"Mom, you will rock."
p8
aVI love this.
p9
aVGetting that text
p10
aVwas like getting a hug.
p11
aVAnd so there you have it.
p12
aVI embody
p13
aVthe central paradox.
p14
aVI'm a woman
p15
aVwho loves getting texts
p16
aVwho's going to tell you
p17
aVthat too many of them can be a problem.
p18
aa(lp19
VActually that reminder of my daughter
p20
aVbrings me to the beginning of my story.
p21
aV1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk,
p22
aVRebecca was five years old
p23
aVand she was sitting right there
p24
aVin the front row.
p25
aVI had just written a book
p26
aVthat celebrated our life on the internet
p27
aVand I was about to be on the cover
p28
aVof Wired magazine.
p29
aVIn those heady days,
p30
aVwe were experimenting
p31
aVwith chat rooms and online virtual communities.
p32
aVWe were exploring different aspects of ourselves.
p33
aVAnd then we unplugged.
p34
aVI was excited.
p35
aVAnd, as a psychologist, what excited me most
p36
aVwas the idea
p37
aVthat we would use what we learned in the virtual world
p38
aVabout ourselves, about our identity,
p39
aVto live better lives in the real world.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow fast-forward to 2012.
p42
aVI'm back here on the TED stage again.
p43
aVMy daughter's 20. She's a college student.
p44
aVShe sleeps with her cellphone,
p45
aVso do I.
p46
aVAnd I've just written a new book,
p47
aVbut this time it's not one
p48
aVthat will get me on the cover
p49
aVof Wired magazine.
p50
aVSo what happened?
p51
aVI'm still excited by technology,
p52
aVbut I believe,
p53
aVand I'm here to make the case,
p54
aVthat we're letting it take us places
p55
aVthat we don't want to go.
p56
aa(lp57
VOver the past 15 years,
p58
aVI've studied technologies of mobile communication
p59
aVand I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people,
p60
aVyoung and old,
p61
aVabout their plugged in lives.
p62
aVAnd what I've found
p63
aVis that our little devices,
p64
aVthose little devices in our pockets,
p65
aVare so psychologically powerful
p66
aVthat they don't only change what we do,
p67
aVthey change who we are.
p68
aVSome of the things we do now with our devices
p69
aVare things that, only a few years ago,
p70
aVwe would have found odd
p71
aVor disturbing,
p72
aVbut they've quickly come to seem familiar,
p73
aVjust how we do things.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo just to take some quick examples:
p76
aVPeople text or do email
p77
aVduring corporate board meetings.
p78
aVThey text and shop and go on Facebook
p79
aVduring classes, during presentations,
p80
aVactually during all meetings.
p81
aVPeople talk to me about the important new skill
p82
aVof making eye contact
p83
aVwhile you're texting.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVPeople explain to me
p86
aVthat it's hard, but that it can be done.
p87
aVParents text and do email
p88
aVat breakfast and at dinner
p89
aVwhile their children complain
p90
aVabout not having their parents' full attention.
p91
aVBut then these same children
p92
aVdeny each other their full attention.
p93
aVThis is a recent shot
p94
aVof my daughter and her friends
p95
aVbeing together
p96
aVwhile not being together.
p97
aVAnd we even text at funerals.
p98
aVI study this.
p99
aVWe remove ourselves
p100
aVfrom our grief or from our revery
p101
aVand we go into our phones.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhy does this matter?
p104
aVIt matters to me
p105
aVbecause I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble \u2014
p106
aVtrouble certainly
p107
aVin how we relate to each other,
p108
aVbut also trouble
p109
aVin how we relate to ourselves
p110
aVand our capacity for self-reflection.
p111
aVWe're getting used to a new way
p112
aVof being alone together.
p113
aVPeople want to be with each other,
p114
aVbut also elsewhere \u2014
p115
aVconnected to all the different places they want to be.
p116
aVPeople want to customize their lives.
p117
aVThey want to go in and out of all the places they are
p118
aVbecause the thing that matters most to them
p119
aVis control over where they put their attention.
p120
aVSo you want to go to that board meeting,
p121
aVbut you only want to pay attention
p122
aVto the bits that interest you.
p123
aVAnd some people think that's a good thing.
p124
aVBut you can end up
p125
aVhiding from each other,
p126
aVeven as we're all constantly connected to each other.
p127
aa(lp128
VA 50-year-old business man
p129
aVlamented to me
p130
aVthat he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work.
p131
aVWhen he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody,
p132
aVhe doesn't call.
p133
aVAnd he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues
p134
aVbecause, he says, "They're too busy on their email."
p135
aVBut then he stops himself
p136
aVand he says, "You know, I'm not telling you the truth.
p137
aVI'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted.
p138
aVI think I should want to,
p139
aVbut actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry."
p140
aa(lp141
VAcross the generations,
p142
aVI see that people can't get enough of each other,
p143
aVif and only if
p144
aVthey can have each other at a distance,
p145
aVin amounts they can control.
p146
aVI call it the Goldilocks effect:
p147
aVnot too close, not too far,
p148
aVjust right.
p149
aVBut what might feel just right
p150
aVfor that middle-aged executive
p151
aVcan be a problem for an adolescent
p152
aVwho needs to develop face-to-face relationships.
p153
aVAn 18-year-old boy
p154
aVwho uses texting for almost everything
p155
aVsays to me wistfully,
p156
aV"Someday, someday,
p157
aVbut certainly not now,
p158
aVI'd like to learn how to have a conversation."
p159
aa(lp160
VWhen I ask people
p161
aV"What's wrong with having a conversation?"
p162
aVPeople say, "I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation.
p163
aVIt takes place in real time
p164
aVand you can't control what you're going to say."
p165
aVSo that's the bottom line.
p166
aVTexting, email, posting,
p167
aVall of these things
p168
aVlet us present the self as we want to be.
p169
aVWe get to edit,
p170
aVand that means we get to delete,
p171
aVand that means we get to retouch,
p172
aVthe face, the voice,
p173
aVthe flesh, the body \u2014
p174
aVnot too little, not too much,
p175
aVjust right.
p176
aa(lp177
VHuman relationships
p178
aVare rich and they're messy
p179
aVand they're demanding.
p180
aVAnd we clean them up with technology.
p181
aVAnd when we do,
p182
aVone of the things that can happen
p183
aVis that we sacrifice conversation
p184
aVfor mere connection.
p185
aVWe short-change ourselves.
p186
aVAnd over time,
p187
aVwe seem to forget this,
p188
aVor we seem to stop caring.
p189
aa(lp190
VI was caught off guard
p191
aVwhen Stephen Colbert
p192
aVasked me a profound question,
p193
aVa profound question.
p194
aVHe said, "Don't all those little tweets,
p195
aVdon't all those little sips
p196
aVof online communication,
p197
aVadd up to one big gulp
p198
aVof real conversation?"
p199
aVMy answer was no,
p200
aVthey don't add up.
p201
aVConnecting in sips may work
p202
aVfor gathering discrete bits of information,
p203
aVthey may work for saying, "I'm thinking about you,"
p204
aVor even for saying, "I love you," \u2014
p205
aVI mean, look at how I felt
p206
aVwhen I got that text from my daughter \u2014
p207
aVbut they don't really work
p208
aVfor learning about each other,
p209
aVfor really coming to know and understand each other.
p210
aVAnd we use conversations with each other
p211
aVto learn how to have conversations
p212
aVwith ourselves.
p213
aVSo a flight from conversation
p214
aVcan really matter
p215
aVbecause it can compromise
p216
aVour capacity for self-reflection.
p217
aVFor kids growing up,
p218
aVthat skill is the bedrock of development.
p219
aa(lp220
VOver and over I hear,
p221
aV"I would rather text than talk."
p222
aVAnd what I'm seeing
p223
aVis that people get so used to being short-changed
p224
aVout of real conversation,
p225
aVso used to getting by with less,
p226
aVthat they've become almost willing
p227
aVto dispense with people altogether.
p228
aVSo for example,
p229
aVmany people share with me this wish,
p230
aVthat some day a more advanced version of Siri,
p231
aVthe digital assistant on Apple's iPhone,
p232
aVwill be more like a best friend,
p233
aVsomeone who will listen
p234
aVwhen others won't.
p235
aVI believe this wish
p236
aVreflects a painful truth
p237
aVthat I've learned in the past 15 years.
p238
aVThat feeling that no one is listening to me
p239
aVis very important
p240
aVin our relationships with technology.
p241
aVThat's why it's so appealing
p242
aVto have a Facebook page
p243
aVor a Twitter feed \u2014
p244
aVso many automatic listeners.
p245
aVAnd the feeling that no one is listening to me
p246
aVmake us want to spend time
p247
aVwith machines that seem to care about us.
p248
aa(lp249
VWe're developing robots,
p250
aVthey call them sociable robots,
p251
aVthat are specifically designed to be companions \u2014
p252
aVto the elderly,
p253
aVto our children,
p254
aVto us.
p255
aVHave we so lost confidence
p256
aVthat we will be there for each other?
p257
aVDuring my research
p258
aVI worked in nursing homes,
p259
aVand I brought in these sociable robots
p260
aVthat were designed to give the elderly
p261
aVthe feeling that they were understood.
p262
aVAnd one day I came in
p263
aVand a woman who had lost a child
p264
aVwas talking to a robot
p265
aVin the shape of a baby seal.
p266
aVIt seemed to be looking in her eyes.
p267
aVIt seemed to be following the conversation.
p268
aVIt comforted her.
p269
aVAnd many people found this amazing.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut that woman was trying to make sense of her life
p272
aVwith a machine that had no experience
p273
aVof the arc of a human life.
p274
aVThat robot put on a great show.
p275
aVAnd we're vulnerable.
p276
aVPeople experience pretend empathy
p277
aVas though it were the real thing.
p278
aVSo during that moment
p279
aVwhen that woman
p280
aVwas experiencing that pretend empathy,
p281
aVI was thinking, "That robot can't empathize.
p282
aVIt doesn't face death.
p283
aVIt doesn't know life."
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd as that woman took comfort
p286
aVin her robot companion,
p287
aVI didn't find it amazing;
p288
aVI found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments
p289
aVin my 15 years of work.
p290
aVBut when I stepped back,
p291
aVI felt myself
p292
aVat the cold, hard center
p293
aVof a perfect storm.
p294
aVWe expect more from technology
p295
aVand less from each other.
p296
aVAnd I ask myself,
p297
aV"Why have things come to this?"
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd I believe it's because
p300
aVtechnology appeals to us most
p301
aVwhere we are most vulnerable.
p302
aVAnd we are vulnerable.
p303
aVWe're lonely,
p304
aVbut we're afraid of intimacy.
p305
aVAnd so from social networks to sociable robots,
p306
aVwe're designing technologies
p307
aVthat will give us the illusion of companionship
p308
aVwithout the demands of friendship.
p309
aVWe turn to technology to help us feel connected
p310
aVin ways we can comfortably control.
p311
aVBut we're not so comfortable.
p312
aVWe are not so much in control.
p313
aa(lp314
VThese days, those phones in our pockets
p315
aVare changing our minds and hearts
p316
aVbecause they offer us
p317
aVthree gratifying fantasies.
p318
aVOne, that we can put our attention
p319
aVwherever we want it to be;
p320
aVtwo, that we will always be heard;
p321
aVand three, that we will never have to be alone.
p322
aVAnd that third idea,
p323
aVthat we will never have to be alone,
p324
aVis central to changing our psyches.
p325
aVBecause the moment that people are alone,
p326
aVeven for a few seconds,
p327
aVthey become anxious, they panic, they fidget,
p328
aVthey reach for a device.
p329
aVJust think of people at a checkout line
p330
aVor at a red light.
p331
aVBeing alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved.
p332
aVAnd so people try to solve it by connecting.
p333
aVBut here, connection
p334
aVis more like a symptom than a cure.
p335
aVIt expresses, but it doesn't solve,
p336
aVan underlying problem.
p337
aVBut more than a symptom,
p338
aVconstant connection is changing
p339
aVthe way people think of themselves.
p340
aVIt's shaping a new way of being.
p341
aa(lp342
VThe best way to describe it is,
p343
aVI share therefore I am.
p344
aVWe use technology to define ourselves
p345
aVby sharing our thoughts and feelings
p346
aVeven as we're having them.
p347
aVSo before it was:
p348
aVI have a feeling,
p349
aVI want to make a call.
p350
aVNow it's: I want to have a feeling,
p351
aVI need to send a text.
p352
aVThe problem with this new regime
p353
aVof "I share therefore I am"
p354
aVis that, if we don't have connection,
p355
aVwe don't feel like ourselves.
p356
aVWe almost don't feel ourselves.
p357
aVSo what do we do? We connect more and more.
p358
aVBut in the process,
p359
aVwe set ourselves up to be isolated.
p360
aa(lp361
VHow do you get from connection to isolation?
p362
aVYou end up isolated
p363
aVif you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude,
p364
aVthe ability to be separate,
p365
aVto gather yourself.
p366
aVSolitude is where you find yourself
p367
aVso that you can reach out to other people
p368
aVand form real attachments.
p369
aVWhen we don't have the capacity for solitude,
p370
aVwe turn to other people in order to feel less anxious
p371
aVor in order to feel alive.
p372
aVWhen this happens,
p373
aVwe're not able to appreciate who they are.
p374
aVIt's as though we're using them
p375
aVas spare parts
p376
aVto support our fragile sense of self.
p377
aVWe slip into thinking that always being connected
p378
aVis going to make us feel less alone.
p379
aVBut we're at risk,
p380
aVbecause actually it's the opposite that's true.
p381
aVIf we're not able to be alone,
p382
aVwe're going to be more lonely.
p383
aVAnd if we don't teach our children to be alone,
p384
aVthey're only going to know
p385
aVhow to be lonely.
p386
aa(lp387
VWhen I spoke at TED in 1996,
p388
aVreporting on my studies
p389
aVof the early virtual communities,
p390
aVI said, "Those who make the most
p391
aVof their lives on the screen
p392
aVcome to it in a spirit of self-reflection."
p393
aVAnd that's what I'm calling for here, now:
p394
aVreflection and, more than that, a conversation
p395
aVabout where our current use of technology
p396
aVmay be taking us,
p397
aVwhat it might be costing us.
p398
aVWe're smitten with technology.
p399
aVAnd we're afraid, like young lovers,
p400
aVthat too much talking might spoil the romance.
p401
aVBut it's time to talk.
p402
aVWe grew up with digital technology
p403
aVand so we see it as all grown up.
p404
aVBut it's not, it's early days.
p405
aVThere's plenty of time
p406
aVfor us to reconsider how we use it,
p407
aVhow we build it.
p408
aVI'm not suggesting
p409
aVthat we turn away from our devices,
p410
aVjust that we develop a more self-aware relationship
p411
aVwith them, with each other
p412
aVand with ourselves.
p413
aa(lp414
VI see some first steps.
p415
aVStart thinking of solitude
p416
aVas a good thing.
p417
aVMake room for it.
p418
aVFind ways to demonstrate this
p419
aVas a value to your children.
p420
aVCreate sacred spaces at home \u2014
p421
aVthe kitchen, the dining room \u2014
p422
aVand reclaim them for conversation.
p423
aVDo the same thing at work.
p424
aVAt work, we're so busy communicating
p425
aVthat we often don't have time to think,
p426
aVwe don't have time to talk,
p427
aVabout the things that really matter.
p428
aVChange that.
p429
aVMost important, we all really need to listen to each other,
p430
aVincluding to the boring bits.
p431
aVBecause it's when we stumble
p432
aVor hesitate or lose our words
p433
aVthat we reveal ourselves to each other.
p434
aa(lp435
VTechnology is making a bid
p436
aVto redefine human connection \u2014
p437
aVhow we care for each other,
p438
aVhow we care for ourselves \u2014
p439
aVbut it's also giving us the opportunity
p440
aVto affirm our values
p441
aVand our direction.
p442
aVI'm optimistic.
p443
aVWe have everything we need to start.
p444
aVWe have each other.
p445
aVAnd we have the greatest chance of success
p446
aVif we recognize our vulnerability.
p447
aVThat we listen
p448
aVwhen technology says
p449
aVit will take something complicated
p450
aVand promises something simpler.
p451
aa(lp452
VSo in my work,
p453
aVI hear that life is hard,
p454
aVrelationships are filled with risk.
p455
aVAnd then there's technology \u2014
p456
aVsimpler, hopeful,
p457
aVoptimistic, ever-young.
p458
aVIt's like calling in the cavalry.
p459
aVAn ad campaign promises
p460
aVthat online and with avatars,
p461
aVyou can "Finally, love your friends
p462
aVlove your body, love your life,
p463
aVonline and with avatars."
p464
aVWe're drawn to virtual romance,
p465
aVto computer games that seem like worlds,
p466
aVto the idea that robots, robots,
p467
aVwill someday be our true companions.
p468
aVWe spend an evening on the social network
p469
aVinstead of going to the pub with friends.
p470
aa(lp471
VBut our fantasies of substitution
p472
aVhave cost us.
p473
aVNow we all need to focus
p474
aVon the many, many ways
p475
aVtechnology can lead us back
p476
aVto our real lives, our own bodies,
p477
aVour own communities,
p478
aVour own politics,
p479
aVour own planet.
p480
aVThey need us.
p481
aVLet's talk about
p482
aVhow we can use digital technology,
p483
aVthe technology of our dreams,
p484
aVto make this life
p485
aVthe life we can love.
p486
aa(lp487
VThank you.

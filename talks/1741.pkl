VWhen I was in my 20s,
p5
aVI saw my very first psychotherapy client.
p6
aVI was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
p7
aVShe was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
p8
aa(lp9
VNow Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,
p10
aVand she dropped onto the couch in my office
p11
aVand kicked off her flats
p12
aVand told me she was there to talk about guy problems.
p13
aVNow when I heard this, I was so relieved.
p14
aVMy classmate got an arsonist for her first client.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys.
p19
aVThis I thought I could handle.
p20
aVBut I didn't handle it.
p21
aVWith the funny stories that Alex would bring to session,
p22
aVit was easy for me just to nod my head
p23
aVwhile we kicked the can down the road.
p24
aV"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say,
p25
aVand as far as I could tell, she was right.
p26
aVWork happened later, marriage happened later,
p27
aVkids happened later, even death happened later.
p28
aVTwentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life.
p31
aVI pushed back.
p32
aVI said, "Sure, she's dating down,
p33
aVshe's sleeping with a knucklehead,
p34
aVbut it's not like she's going to marry the guy."
p35
aVAnd then my supervisor said,
p36
aV"Not yet, but she might marry the next one.
p37
aVBesides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage
p38
aVis before she has one."
p39
aa(lp40
VThat's what psychologists call an "Aha!" moment.
p41
aVThat was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.
p42
aVYes, people settle down later than they used to,
p43
aVbut that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime.
p44
aVThat made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot,
p45
aVand we were sitting there, blowing it.
p46
aVThat was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect
p47
aVwas a real problem, and it had real consequences,
p48
aVnot just for Alex and her love life
p49
aVbut for the careers and the families and the futures
p50
aVof twentysomethings everywhere.
p51
aa(lp52
VThere are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now.
p53
aVWe're talking about 15 percent of the population,
p54
aVor 100 percent if you consider
p55
aVthat no one's getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VRaise your hand if you're in your 20s.
p60
aVI really want to see some twentysomethings here.
p61
aVOh, yay! You are all awesome.
p62
aVIf you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething,
p63
aVyou're losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see \u2014
p64
aVOkay. Awesome, twentysomethings really matter.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe
p67
aVthat every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings
p68
aVdeserves to know what psychologists,
p69
aVsociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists
p70
aValready know:
p71
aVthat claiming your 20s is one of the simplest,
p72
aVyet most transformative, things you can do
p73
aVfor work, for love, for your happiness,
p74
aVmaybe even for the world.
p75
aa(lp76
VThis is not my opinion.
p77
aVThese are the facts.
p78
aVWe know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments
p79
aVtake place by age 35.
p80
aVThat means that eight out of 10
p81
aVof the decisions and experiences and "Aha!" moments
p82
aVthat make your life what it is
p83
aVwill have happened by your mid-30s.
p84
aVPeople who are over 40, don't panic.
p85
aVThis crowd is going to be fine, I think.
p86
aVWe know that the first 10 years of a career
p87
aVhas an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.
p88
aVWe know that more than half of Americans
p89
aVare married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30.
p90
aVWe know that the brain caps off
p91
aVits second and last growth spurt in your 20s
p92
aVas it rewires itself for adulthood,
p93
aVwhich means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself,
p94
aVnow is the time to change it.
p95
aVWe know that personality changes more during your 20s
p96
aVthan at any other time in life,
p97
aVand we know that female fertility peaks at age 28,
p98
aVand things get tricky after age 35.
p99
aVSo your 20s are the time to educate yourself
p100
aVabout your body and your options.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo when we think about child development,
p103
aVwe all know that the first five years are a critical period
p104
aVfor language and attachment in the brain.
p105
aVIt's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life
p106
aVhas an inordinate impact on who you will become.
p107
aVBut what we hear less about is that there's such a thing
p108
aVas adult development,
p109
aVand our 20s are that critical period of adult development.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing.
p112
aVNewspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood.
p113
aVResearchers call the 20s an extended adolescence.
p114
aVJournalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings
p115
aVlike "twixters" and "kidults."
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughing) It's true!
p118
aa(lp119
VAs a culture, we have trivialized
p120
aVwhat is actually the defining decade of adulthood.
p121
aa(lp122
VLeonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things,
p123
aVyou need a plan and not quite enough time.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughing) Isn't that true?
p126
aa(lp127
VSo what do you think happens
p128
aVwhen you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say,
p129
aV"You have 10 extra years to start your life"?
p130
aVNothing happens.
p131
aVYou have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition,
p132
aVand absolutely nothing happens.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings
p135
aVlike you or like your sons and daughters
p136
aVcome into my office and say things like this:
p137
aV"I know my boyfriend's no good for me,
p138
aVbut this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."
p139
aVOr they say, "Everybody says as long as I get started
p140
aVon a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine."
p141
aa(lp142
VBut then it starts to sound like this:
p143
aV"My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself.
p144
aVI had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college."
p145
aVAnd then it starts to sound like this:
p146
aV"Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.
p147
aVEverybody was running around and having fun,
p148
aVbut then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off
p149
aVand everybody started sitting down.
p150
aVI didn't want to be the only one left standing up,
p151
aVso sometimes I think I married my husband
p152
aVbecause he was the closest chair to me at 30."
p153
aa(lp154
VWhere are the twentysomethings here?
p155
aVDo not do that.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VOkay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake,
p160
aVthe stakes are very high.
p161
aVWhen a lot has been pushed to your 30s,
p162
aVthere is enormous thirtysomething pressure
p163
aVto jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up,
p164
aVand have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.
p165
aVMany of these things are incompatible,
p166
aVand as research is just starting to show,
p167
aVsimply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.
p168
aa(lp169
VThe post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car.
p170
aVIt's realizing you can't have that career you now want.
p171
aVIt's realizing you can't have that child you now want,
p172
aVor you can't give your child a sibling.
p173
aVToo many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings
p174
aVlook at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room,
p175
aVand say about their 20s,
p176
aV"What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
p177
aVI want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.
p178
aa(lp179
VHere's a story about how that can go.
p180
aVIt's a story about a woman named Emma.
p181
aVAt 25, Emma came to my office
p182
aVbecause she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.
p183
aVShe said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment,
p184
aVbut she hadn't decided yet,
p185
aVso she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead.
p186
aVBecause it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend
p187
aVwho displayed his temper more than his ambition.
p188
aVAnd as hard as her 20s were,
p189
aVher early life had been even harder.
p190
aVShe often cried in our sessions,
p191
aVbut then would collect herself by saying,
p192
aV"You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends."
p193
aa(lp194
VWell one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap,
p195
aVand she sobbed for most of the hour.
p196
aVShe'd just bought a new address book,
p197
aVand she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts,
p198
aVbut then she'd been left staring at that empty blank
p199
aVthat comes after the words
p200
aV"In case of emergency, please call ..."
p201
aVShe was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said,
p202
aV"Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck?
p203
aVWho's going to take care of me if I have cancer?"
p204
aa(lp205
VNow in that moment, it took everything I had
p206
aVnot to say, "I will."
p207
aVBut what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared.
p208
aVEmma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.
p209
aVI had learned too much since I first worked with Alex
p210
aVto just sit there while Emma's defining decade
p211
aVwent parading by.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo over the next weeks and months,
p214
aVI told Emma three things
p215
aVthat every twentysomething, male or female,
p216
aVdeserves to hear.
p217
aa(lp218
VFirst, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis
p219
aVand get some identity capital.
p220
aVBy "get identity capital,"
p221
aVI mean do something that adds value to who you are.
p222
aVDo something that's an investment
p223
aVin who you might want to be next.
p224
aVI didn't know the future of Emma's career,
p225
aVand no one knows the future of work,
p226
aVbut I do know this:
p227
aVIdentity capital begets identity capital.
p228
aVSo now is the time for that cross-country job,
p229
aVthat internship, that startup you want to try.
p230
aVI'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here,
p231
aVbut I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count,
p232
aVwhich, by the way, is not exploration.
p233
aVThat's procrastination.
p234
aVI told Emma to explore work and make it count.
p235
aa(lp236
VSecond, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.
p237
aVBest friends are great for giving rides to the airport,
p238
aVbut twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers
p239
aVlimit who they know,
p240
aVwhat they know, how they think,
p241
aVhow they speak, and where they work.
p242
aVThat new piece of capital, that new person to date
p243
aValmost always comes from outside the inner circle.
p244
aVNew things come from what are called our weak ties,
p245
aVour friends of friends of friends.
p246
aVSo yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.
p247
aVBut half aren't,
p248
aVand weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.
p249
aVHalf of new jobs are never posted,
p250
aVso reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job.
p251
aVIt's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads.
p252
aa(lp253
VLast but not least, Emma believed
p254
aVthat you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.
p255
aVNow this was true for her growing up,
p256
aVbut as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family
p257
aVwhen she partnered with someone and created a family of her own.
p258
aVI told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down
p261
aVthan 20, or even 25,
p262
aVand I agree with you.
p263
aVBut grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with
p264
aVwhen everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle
p265
aVis not progress.
p266
aVThe best time to work on your marriage is before you have one,
p267
aVand that means being as intentional with love
p268
aVas you are with work.
p269
aVPicking your family is about consciously choosing
p270
aVwho and what you want
p271
aVrather than just making it work or killing time
p272
aVwith whoever happens to be choosing you.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo what happened to Emma?
p275
aVWell, we went through that address book,
p276
aVand she found an old roommate's cousin
p277
aVwho worked at an art museum in another state.
p278
aVThat weak tie helped her get a job there.
p279
aVThat job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend.
p280
aVNow, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums.
p281
aVShe's married to a man she mindfully chose.
p282
aVShe loves her new career, she loves her new family,
p283
aVand she sent me a card that said,
p284
aV"Now the emergency contact blanks
p285
aVdon't seem big enough."
p286
aa(lp287
VNow Emma's story made that sound easy,
p288
aVbut that's what I love about working with twentysomethings.
p289
aVThey are so easy to help.
p290
aVTwentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX,
p291
aVbound for somewhere west.
p292
aVRight after takeoff, a slight change in course
p293
aVis the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.
p294
aVLikewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,
p295
aVone good conversation, one good break,
p296
aVone good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect
p297
aVacross years and even generations to come.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo here's an idea worth spreading
p300
aVto every twentysomething you know.
p301
aVIt's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
p302
aVIt's what I now have the privilege
p303
aVof saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day:
p304
aVThirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood,
p305
aVget some identity capital, use your weak ties,
p306
aVpick your family.
p307
aVDon't be defined by what you didn't know
p308
aVor didn't do.
p309
aVYou're deciding your life right now.
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Applause)

VThroughout the history of computers
p5
aVwe've been striving to shorten the gap between us
p6
aVand digital information,
p7
aVthe gap between our physical world
p8
aVand the world in the screen
p9
aVwhere our imagination can go wild.
p10
aVAnd this gap has become shorter,
p11
aVshorter, and even shorter,
p12
aVand now this gap is shortened down
p13
aVto less than a millimeter,
p14
aVthe thickness of a touch-screen glass,
p15
aVand the power of computing
p16
aVhas become accessible to everyone.
p17
aVBut I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?
p18
aVI started to imagine what this would look like.
p19
aVFirst, I created this tool
p20
aVwhich penetrates into the digital space,
p21
aVso when you press it hard on the screen,
p22
aVit transfers its physical body into pixels.
p23
aVDesigners can materialize their ideas
p24
aVdirectly in 3D,
p25
aVand surgeons can practice on virtual organs
p26
aVunderneath the screen.
p27
aVSo with this tool, this boundary has been broken.
p28
aVBut our two hands still remain outside the screen.
p29
aVHow can you reach inside and interact
p30
aVwith the digital information
p31
aVusing the full dexterity of our hands?
p32
aVAt Microsoft Applied Sciences,
p33
aValong with my mentor Cati Boulanger,
p34
aVI redesigned the computer
p35
aVand turned a little space above the keyboard
p36
aVinto a digital workspace.
p37
aVBy combining a transparent display and depth cameras
p38
aVfor sensing your fingers and face,
p39
aVnow you can lift up your hands from the keyboard
p40
aVand reach inside this 3D space
p41
aVand grab pixels with your bare hands.
p42
aV(Applause)
p43
aVBecause windows and files have a position in the real space,
p44
aVselecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.
p45
aVThen you can flip through this book
p46
aVwhile highlighting the lines, words
p47
aVon the virtual touch pad below each floating window.
p48
aVArchitects can stretch or rotate the models
p49
aVwith their two hands directly.
p50
aVSo in these examples,
p51
aVwe are reaching into the digital world.
p52
aVBut how about reversing its role
p53
aVand having the digital information reach us instead?
p54
aVI'm sure many of us have had the experience
p55
aVof buying and returning items online.
p56
aVBut now you don't have to worry about it.
p57
aVWhat I got here is an online augmented fitting room.
p58
aVThis is a view that you get from
p59
aVhead-mounted or see-through display
p60
aVwhen the system understands the geometry of your body.
p61
aVTaking this idea further, I started to think,
p62
aVinstead of just seeing these pixels in our space,
p63
aVhow can we make it physical
p64
aVso that we can touch and feel it?
p65
aVWhat would such a future look like?
p66
aVAt MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii
p67
aVand my collaborator Rehmi Post,
p68
aVwe created this one physical pixel.
p69
aVWell, in this case, this spherical magnet
p70
aVacts like a 3D pixel in our space,
p71
aVwhich means that both computers and people
p72
aVcan move this object to anywhere
p73
aVwithin this little 3D space.
p74
aVWhat we did was essentially canceling gravity
p75
aVand controlling the movement by combining
p76
aVmagnetic levitation and mechanical actuation
p77
aVand sensing technologies.
p78
aVAnd by digitally programming the object,
p79
aVwe are liberating the object from constraints
p80
aVof time and space, which means that now,
p81
aVhuman motions can be recorded and played back
p82
aVand left permanently in the physical world.
p83
aVSo choreography can be taught physically over distance
p84
aVand Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated
p85
aVover and over as a physical reality.
p86
aVStudents can use this as a tool
p87
aVto learn about the complex concepts
p88
aVsuch as planetary motion, physics,
p89
aVand unlike computer screens or textbooks,
p90
aVthis is a real, tangible experience
p91
aVthat you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.
p92
aVAnd what's more exciting
p93
aVthan just turning what's currently in the computer physical
p94
aVis to start imagining how programming the world
p95
aVwill alter even our daily physical activities.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVAs you can see, the digital information
p98
aVwill not just show us something
p99
aVbut it will start directly acting upon us
p100
aVas a part of our physical surroundings
p101
aVwithout disconnecting ourselves from our world.
p102
aVToday, we started by talking about the boundary,
p103
aVbut if we remove this boundary,
p104
aVthe only boundary left is our imagination.
p105
aVThank you.
p106
aV(Applause)

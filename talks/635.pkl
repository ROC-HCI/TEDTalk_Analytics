VSo the question is, what is invisible?
p5
aVThere is more of it than you think, actually.
p6
aVEverything, I would say. Everything that matters
p7
aVexcept every thing and except matter.
p8
aa(lp9
VWe can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter.
p10
aVAs in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently:
p11
aV"The marriage suffered a setback in 1965,
p12
aVwhen the husband was killed by the wife."
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVThere's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VSo, we can see the stars and the planets,
p18
aVbut we can't see what holds them apart
p19
aVor what draws them together.
p20
aVWith matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.
p21
aVWe can't see into the engine room.
p22
aVWe can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.
p23
aVAnd the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.
p24
aVIn fact, if you look really closely at stuff,
p25
aVif you look at the basic substructure of matter,
p26
aVthere isn't anything there.
p27
aVElectrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
p28
aVand there is only energy. And you can't see energy.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.
p31
aVOne slightly silly thing that's invisible
p32
aVis this story, which is invisible to you.
p33
aVAnd I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.
p34
aVIt's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens.
p35
aa(lp36
VThe late Geoffrey Dickens, M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency.
p37
aVWherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed
p38
aVby a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVTry as he might, he couldn't get away from her.
p41
aVA few days later he received a letter from a constituent
p42
aVsaying how much she admired him,
p43
aVhad met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.
p44
aVAfter her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
V"I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.
p48
aV"Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness,
p49
aVshe turns it to her advantage.
p50
aVA photo is not enough."
p51
aVSo he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.
p52
aVAnd on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish,
p53
aV"To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."
p54
aVAfter it had been sent off, his secretary said to him,
p55
aV"Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?
p56
aVI wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was."
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VI bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, one of the interesting things about invisibility
p63
aVis that things that we can't see
p64
aVwe also can't understand.
p65
aVGravity is one thing that we can't see
p66
aVand which we don't understand.
p67
aVIt's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces,
p68
aVand the weakest.
p69
aVAnd nobody really knows what it is or why it's there.
p70
aa(lp71
VFor what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived,
p72
aVhe thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.
p73
aVThat's what he thought he was there for.
p74
aVSo, bright guy, could be wrong on that one, I don't know.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VConsciousness. I see all your faces.
p78
aVI have no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing?
p79
aVIsn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?
p80
aVBut we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.
p81
aVBut we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing.
p82
aa(lp83
VIn the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion,
p84
aVwhich some claim is the route of all religions,
p85
aVSufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.
p86
aVBut their main exercise of telepathy
p87
aVis to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.
p88
aVSo that's why we don't think it exists,
p89
aVthe Sufi masters working on us.
p90
aa(lp91
VIn the question of consciousness
p92
aVand artificial intelligence,
p93
aVartificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness,
p94
aVgotten nowhere. We have no idea how consciousness works.
p95
aVWith artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence,
p96
aVthey haven't yet created artificial stupidity.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VThe laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful.
p100
aVRemind you of anyone?
p101
aVInteresting. I'm, as you can guess,
p102
aVnot a materialist, I'm an immaterialist.
p103
aVAnd I've found a very useful new word, ignostic. Okay?
p104
aVI'm an ignostic.
p105
aVI refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists,
p106
aVuntil somebody properly defines the terms.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VAnother thing we can't see is the human genome.
p110
aVAnd this is increasingly peculiar,
p111
aVbecause about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome,
p112
aVthey thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.
p113
aVGeneticists will know this, but every year since,
p114
aVit's been revised downwards.
p115
aVWe now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000
p116
aVgenes in the human genome.
p117
aa(lp118
VThis is extraordinary. Because rice \u2014 get this \u2014
p119
aVrice is known to have 38 thousand genes.
p120
aVPotatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that?
p121
aVTwo more than people,
p122
aVand the same as a gorilla.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVYou can't see these things, but they are very strange.
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VThe stars by day. I always think that's fascinating.
p128
aVThe universe disappears.
p129
aVThe more light there is, the less you can see.
p130
aa(lp131
VTime, nobody can see time.
p132
aVI don't know if you know this. Modern physics,
p133
aVthere is a big movement in modern physics
p134
aVto decide that time doesn't really exist,
p135
aVbecause it's too inconvenient for the figures.
p136
aVIt's much easier if it's not really there.
p137
aVYou can't see the future, obviously.
p138
aVAnd you can't see the past, except in your memory.
p139
aa(lp140
VOne of the interesting things about the past is
p141
aVyou particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day,
p142
aVhe said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?"
p143
aVAnd I said, "Yes." And he said, "Why can't I?"
p144
aa(lp145
VIsn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember
p146
aVwhat happened to you earlier than the age of two or three,
p147
aVwhich is great news for psychoanalysts,
p148
aVbecause otherwise they'd be out of a job.
p149
aVBecause that's where all the stuff happens
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVthat makes you who you are.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnother thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.
p154
aVThis is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,
p155
aVthat cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff.
p156
aVSkin flakes off, hairs grow, nails, that kind of stuff.
p157
aVBut every cell in your body is replaced at some point.
p158
aVTaste buds, every 10 days or so.
p159
aVLivers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer. A spine takes several years.
p160
aVBut at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body
p161
aVremains from what was there seven years ago.
p162
aVThe question is, who, then, are we?
p163
aVWhat are we? What is this thing that we hang on,
p164
aVthat is actually us?
p165
aa(lp166
VOkay. Atoms, you can't see them.
p167
aVNobody ever will. They're smaller than the wavelength of light.
p168
aVGas, you can't see that.
p169
aVInteresting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.
p170
aVGas was invented in 1600
p171
aVby a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.
p172
aVIt's said to be the most successful ever invention
p173
aVof a word by a known individual.
p174
aVQuite good. He also invented a word called "blas,"
p175
aVmeaning astral radiation.
p176
aVDidn't catch on, unfortunately.
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aVBut well done, him.
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VThere is so many things that \u2014 Light.
p182
aVYou can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum,
p183
aVif a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,
p184
aVyou won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.
p185
aVBut it's odd that you can't see the beam of light,
p186
aVyou can only see what it hits.
p187
aVI find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light,
p188
aVnot to be able to see darkness.
p189
aa(lp190
VElectricity, you can't see that.
p191
aVDon't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.
p192
aVThey don't. Nobody knows what it is.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVYou probably think the electrons in an electric wire
p195
aVmove instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light
p196
aVwhen you turn the light on. They don't.
p197
aVElectrons bumble down the wire,
p198
aVabout the speed of spreading honey, they say.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VGalaxies, 100 billion of them estimated in the universe.
p202
aV100 billion. How many can we see? Five.
p203
aVFive out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye,
p204
aVand one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight.
p205
aa(lp206
VRadio waves. There's another thing.
p207
aVHeinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887,
p208
aVhe called them radio waves because they radiated.
p209
aVAnd somebody said to him,
p210
aV"Well what's the point of these, Heinrich?
p211
aVWhat's the point of these radio waves that you've found?"
p212
aVAnd he said, "Well, I've no idea.
p213
aVBut I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."
p214
aVAnd that's what they do, radio. That's what they discovered.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnyway, so the biggest thing
p217
aVthat's invisible to us is what we don't know.
p218
aVIt is incredible how little we know.
p219
aVThomas Edison once said,
p220
aV"We don't know one percent of one millionth
p221
aVabout anything."
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd I've come to the conclusion \u2014
p224
aVbecause you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"
p225
aVThe point, most of us. What's the point?
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aV(Applause)
p228
aVYou can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless,
p229
aVlike an electron, oddly enough.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut the point, what I've got it down to,
p232
aVis there are only two questions really worth asking.
p233
aV"Why are we here?" and "What should we do about it while we are?
p234
aVAnd to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers,
p235
aVperhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century,
p236
aVone a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet.
p237
aa(lp238
VThe first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said,
p239
aV"I don't know why we are here.
p240
aVBut I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves."
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aVHe was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd secondly and lastly, W.H. Auden,
p246
aVone of my favorite poets, who said,
p247
aV"We are here on earth
p248
aVto help others.
p249
aVWhat the others are here for, I've no idea."
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aV(Applause)

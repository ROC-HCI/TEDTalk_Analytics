VAn evolutionary biologist at Purdue University
p5
aVnamed William Muir studied chickens.
p6
aVHe was interested in productivity \u2014
p7
aVI think it's something that concerns all of us \u2014
p8
aVbut it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVHe wanted to know what could make his chickens more productive,
p11
aVso he devised a beautiful experiment.
p12
aVChickens live in groups, so first of all, he selected just an average flock,
p13
aVand he let it alone for six generations.
p14
aVBut then he created a second group
p15
aVof the individually most productive chickens \u2014
p16
aVyou could call them superchickens \u2014
p17
aVand he put them together in a superflock,
p18
aVand each generation, he selected only the most productive for breeding.
p19
aa(lp20
VAfter six generations had passed,
p21
aVwhat did he find?
p22
aVWell, the first group, the average group, was doing just fine.
p23
aVThey were all plump and fully feathered
p24
aVand egg production had increased dramatically.
p25
aVWhat about the second group?
p26
aVWell, all but three were dead.
p27
aVThey'd pecked the rest to death.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVThe individually productive chickens had only achieved their success
p30
aVby suppressing the productivity of the rest.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, as I've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story
p33
aVin all sorts of organizations and companies,
p34
aVpeople have seen the relevance almost instantly,
p35
aVand they come up and they say things to me like,
p36
aV"That superflock, that's my company."
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVOr, "That's my country."
p39
aVOr, "That's my life."
p40
aa(lp41
VAll my life I've been told that the way we have to get ahead is to compete:
p42
aVget into the right school, get into the right job, get to the top,
p43
aVand I've really never found it very inspiring.
p44
aVI've started and run businesses because invention is a joy,
p45
aVand because working alongside brilliant, creative people
p46
aVis its own reward.
p47
aVAnd I've never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by superchickens
p48
aVor by superstars.
p49
aVBut for the past 50 years,
p50
aVwe've run most organizations and some societies
p51
aValong the superchicken model.
p52
aVWe've thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars,
p53
aVthe brightest men, or occasionally women, in the room,
p54
aVand giving them all the resources and all the power.
p55
aVAnd the result has been just the same as in William Muir's experiment:
p56
aVaggression, dysfunction and waste.
p57
aVIf the only way the most productive can be successful
p58
aVis by suppressing the productivity of the rest,
p59
aVthen we badly need to find a better way to work
p60
aVand a richer way to live.
p61
aV(Applause)
p62
aa(lp63
VSo what is it that makes some groups
p64
aVobviously more successful and more productive than others?
p65
aVWell, that's the question a team at MIT took to research.
p66
aVThey brought in hundreds of volunteers,
p67
aVthey put them into groups, and they gave them very hard problems to solve.
p68
aVAnd what happened was exactly what you'd expect,
p69
aVthat some groups were very much more successful than others,
p70
aVbut what was really interesting was that the high-achieving groups
p71
aVwere not those where they had one or two people
p72
aVwith spectacularly high I.Q.
p73
aVNor were the most successful groups the ones that had the highest
p74
aVaggregate I.Q.
p75
aVInstead, they had three characteristics, the really successful teams.
p76
aVFirst of all, they showed high degrees of social sensitivity to each other.
p77
aVThis is measured by something called the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test.
p78
aVIt's broadly considered a test for empathy,
p79
aVand the groups that scored highly on this
p80
aVdid better.
p81
aVSecondly, the successful groups gave roughly equal time to each other,
p82
aVso that no one voice dominated,
p83
aVbut neither were there any passengers.
p84
aVAnd thirdly, the more successful groups
p85
aVhad more women in them.
p86
aV(Applause)
p87
aVNow, was this because women typically score more highly on
p88
aVthe Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,
p89
aVso you're getting a doubling down on the empathy quotient?
p90
aVOr was it because they brought a more diverse perspective?
p91
aVWe don't really know, but the striking thing about this experiment
p92
aVis that it showed what we know, which is some groups do better than others,
p93
aVbut what's key to that
p94
aVis their social connectedness to each other.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo how does this play out in the real world?
p97
aVWell, it means that what happens between people really counts,
p98
aVbecause in groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other,
p99
aVideas can flow and grow.
p100
aVPeople don't get stuck. They don't waste energy down dead ends.
p101
aa(lp102
VAn example: Arup is one of the world's most successful engineering firms,
p103
aVand it was commissioned to build the equestrian center
p104
aVfor the Beijing Olympics.
p105
aVNow, this building had to receive
p106
aVtwo and a half thousand really highly strung thoroughbred horses
p107
aVthat were coming off long-haul flights,
p108
aVhighly jet-lagged, not feeling their finest.
p109
aVAnd the problem the engineer confronted was,
p110
aVwhat quantity of waste to cater for?
p111
aVNow, you don't get taught this in engineering school \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p112
aVand it's not really the kind of thing you want to get wrong,
p113
aVso he could have spent months talking to vets, doing the research,
p114
aVtweaking the spreadsheet.
p115
aVInstead, he asked for help
p116
aVand he found someone who had designed the Jockey Club in New York.
p117
aVThe problem was solved in less than a day.
p118
aVArup believes that the culture of helpfulness
p119
aVis central to their success.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, helpfulness sounds really anemic,
p122
aVbut it's absolutely core to successful teams,
p123
aVand it routinely outperforms individual intelligence.
p124
aVHelpfulness means I don't have to know everything,
p125
aVI just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help.
p126
aVAt SAP, they reckon that you can answer any question in 17 minutes.
p127
aVBut there isn't a single high-tech company I've worked with
p128
aVthat imagines for a moment that this is a technology issue,
p129
aVbecause what drives helpfulness is people getting to know each other.
p130
aVNow that sounds so obvious, and we think it'll just happen normally,
p131
aVbut it doesn't.
p132
aVWhen I was running my first software company,
p133
aVI realized that we were getting stuck.
p134
aVThere was a lot of friction, but not much else,
p135
aVand I gradually realized the brilliant, creative people that I'd hired
p136
aVdidn't know each other.
p137
aVThey were so focused on their own individual work,
p138
aVthey didn't even know who they were sitting next to,
p139
aVand it was only when I insisted that we stop working
p140
aVand invest time in getting to know each other
p141
aVthat we achieved real momentum.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow, that was 20 years ago, and now I visit companies
p144
aVthat have banned coffee cups at desks
p145
aVbecause they want people to hang out around the coffee machines
p146
aVand talk to each other.
p147
aVThe Swedes even have a special term for this.
p148
aVThey call it fika, which means more than a coffee break.
p149
aVIt means collective restoration.
p150
aVAt Idexx, a company up in Maine,
p151
aVthey've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people
p152
aVfrom different parts of the business
p153
aVcan work together and get to know the whole business that way.
p154
aVHave they all gone mad?
p155
aVQuite the opposite \u2014 they've figured out that when the going gets tough,
p156
aVand it always will get tough
p157
aVif you're doing breakthrough work that really matters,
p158
aVwhat people need is social support,
p159
aVand they need to know who to ask for help.
p160
aVCompanies don't have ideas; only people do.
p161
aVAnd what motivates people
p162
aVare the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other.
p163
aVWhat matters is the mortar,
p164
aVnot just the bricks.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow, when you put all of this together,
p167
aVwhat you get is something called social capital.
p168
aVSocial capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust.
p169
aVThe term comes from sociologists who were studying communities
p170
aVthat proved particularly resilient in times of stress.
p171
aVSocial capital is what gives companies momentum,
p172
aVand social capital is what makes companies robust.
p173
aVWhat does this mean in practical terms?
p174
aVIt means that time is everything,
p175
aVbecause social capital compounds with time.
p176
aVSo teams that work together longer get better, because it takes time
p177
aVto develop the trust you need for real candor and openness.
p178
aVAnd time is what builds value.
p179
aVWhen Alex Pentland suggested to one company
p180
aVthat they synchronize coffee breaks
p181
aVso that people would have time to talk to each other,
p182
aVprofits went up 15 million dollars,
p183
aVand employee satisfaction went up 10 percent.
p184
aVNot a bad return on social capital,
p185
aVwhich compounds even as you spend it.
p186
aVNow, this isn't about chumminess, and it's no charter for slackers,
p187
aVbecause people who work this way tend to be kind of scratchy,
p188
aVimpatient, absolutely determined to think for themselves
p189
aVbecause that's what their contribution is.
p190
aVConflict is frequent because candor is safe.
p191
aVAnd that's how good ideas turn into great ideas,
p192
aVbecause no idea is born fully formed.
p193
aVIt emerges a little bit as a child is born,
p194
aVkind of messy and confused, but full of possibilities.
p195
aVAnd it's only through the generous contribution, faith and challenge
p196
aVthat they achieve their potential.
p197
aVAnd that's what social capital supports.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, we aren't really used to talking about this,
p200
aVabout talent, about creativity, in this way.
p201
aVWe're used to talking about stars.
p202
aVSo I started to wonder, well, if we start working this way,
p203
aVdoes that mean no more stars?
p204
aVSo I went and I sat in on the auditions
p205
aVat the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.
p206
aVAnd what I saw there really surprised me,
p207
aVbecause the teachers weren't looking for individual pyrotechnics.
p208
aVThey were looking for what happened between the students,
p209
aVbecause that's where the drama is.
p210
aVAnd when I talked to producers of hit albums,
p211
aVthey said, "Oh sure, we have lots of superstars in music.
p212
aVIt's just, they don't last very long.
p213
aVIt's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers,
p214
aVbecause bringing out the best in others is how they found the best
p215
aVin themselves."
p216
aVAnd when I went to visit companies that are renowned
p217
aVfor their ingenuity and creativity,
p218
aVI couldn't even see any superstars,
p219
aVbecause everybody there really mattered.
p220
aVAnd when I reflected on my own career,
p221
aVand the extraordinary people I've had the privilege to work with,
p222
aVI realized how much more we could give each other
p223
aVif we just stopped trying to be superchickens.
p224
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p225
aVOnce you appreciate truly how social work is,
p226
aVa lot of things have to change.
p227
aVManagement by talent contest has routinely pitted
p228
aVemployees against each other.
p229
aVNow, rivalry has to be replaced by social capital.
p230
aVFor decades, we've tried to motivate people with money,
p231
aVeven though we've got a vast amount of research that shows
p232
aVthat money erodes social connectedness.
p233
aVNow, we need to let people motivate each other.
p234
aVAnd for years, we've thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected,
p235
aVall by themselves, to solve complex problems.
p236
aVNow, we need to redefine leadership
p237
aVas an activity in which conditions are created
p238
aVin which everyone can do their most courageous thinking together.
p239
aa(lp240
VWe know that this works.
p241
aVWhen the Montreal Protocol called for the phasing out of CFCs,
p242
aVthe chlorofluorocarbons implicated in the hole in the ozone layer,
p243
aVthe risks were immense.
p244
aVCFCs were everywhere,
p245
aVand nobody knew if a substitute could be found.
p246
aVBut one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles.
p247
aVThe first was the head of engineering, Frank Maslen, said,
p248
aVthere will be no stars in this team.
p249
aVWe need everybody.
p250
aVEverybody has a valid perspective.
p251
aVSecond, we work to one standard only:
p252
aVthe best imaginable.
p253
aVAnd third, he told his boss, Geoff Tudhope,
p254
aVthat he had to butt out,
p255
aVbecause he knew how disruptive power can be.
p256
aVNow, this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing.
p257
aVHe gave the team air cover,
p258
aVand he listened to ensure that they honored their principles.
p259
aVAnd it worked: Ahead of all the other companies tackling this hard problem,
p260
aVthis group cracked it first.
p261
aVAnd to date, the Montreal Protocol
p262
aVis the most successful international environmental agreement
p263
aVever implemented.
p264
aa(lp265
VThere was a lot at stake then,
p266
aVand there's a lot at stake now,
p267
aVand we won't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved
p268
aVby a few supermen or superwomen.
p269
aVNow we need everybody,
p270
aVbecause it is only when we accept that everybody has value
p271
aVthat we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need
p272
aVto create the best beyond measure.
p273
aa(lp274
VThank you.
p275

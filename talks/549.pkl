VAlright.
p5
aVI'm going to show you a couple of images
p6
aVfrom a very diverting paper in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.
p7
aVI'm going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper
p8
aVever published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.
p9
aVThe title is "Observations of In-Utero Masturbation."
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VOkay. Now on the left you can see the hand \u2014 that's the big arrow \u2014
p14
aVand the penis on the right. The hand hovering.
p15
aVAnd over here we have,
p16
aVin the words of radiologist Israel Meisner,
p17
aV"The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements."
p18
aVBear in mind this was an ultrasound,
p19
aVso it would have been moving images.
p20
aa(lp21
VOrgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system.
p22
aVNow, this is the part of the nervous system
p23
aVthat deals with the things that we don't consciously control,
p24
aVlike digestion, heart rate and sexual arousal.
p25
aVAnd the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input.
p26
aVGenital stimulation. Duh.
p27
aVBut also, Kinsey interviewed a woman
p28
aVwho could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow.
p29
aVPeople with spinal cord injuries,
p30
aVlike paraplegias, quadriplegias,
p31
aVwill often develop a very, very sensitive area
p32
aVright above the level of their injury,
p33
aVwherever that is.
p34
aVThere is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature.
p35
aa(lp36
VI think the most curious one that I came across
p37
aVwas a case report of a woman
p38
aVwho had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VSomething in the complex sensory-motor action of brushing her teeth
p43
aVwas triggering orgasm.
p44
aVAnd she went to a neurologist, who was fascinated.
p45
aVHe checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste,
p46
aVbut no \u2014 it happened with any brand.
p47
aVThey stimulated her gums with a toothpick, to see if that was doing it.
p48
aVNo. It was the whole, you know, motion.
p49
aVAnd the amazing thing to me
p50
aVis that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VSadly \u2014 this is what it said in the journal paper \u2014
p55
aV"She believed that she was possessed by demons
p56
aVand switched to mouthwash for her oral care."
p57
aVIt's so sad.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VWhen I was working on the book,
p62
aVI interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm.
p63
aVShe was part of a study at Rutgers University.
p64
aVYou've got to love that. Rutgers.
p65
aVSo I interviewed her in Oakland, in a sushi restaurant.
p66
aVAnd I said, "So, could you do it right here?"
p67
aVAnd she said,
p68
aV"Yeah, but you know I'd rather finish my meal if you don't mind."
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VBut afterwards, she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside.
p73
aVIt was remarkable. It took about one minute.
p74
aVAnd I said to her,
p75
aV"Are you just doing this all the time?"
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VShe said, "No. Honestly, when I get home, I'm usually too tired."
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VShe said that the last time she had done it
p84
aVwas on the Disneyland tram.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VThe headquarters for orgasm, along the spinal nerve,
p89
aVis something called the sacral nerve root,
p90
aVwhich is back here.
p91
aVAnd if you trigger, if you stimulate with an electrode,
p92
aVthe precise spot, you will trigger an orgasm.
p93
aVAnd it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people \u2014
p94
aVa certain kind of dead person, a beating-heart cadaver.
p95
aVNow this is somebody who is brain-dead,
p96
aVlegally dead, definitely checked out,
p97
aVbut is being kept alive on a respirator,
p98
aVso that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation.
p99
aVNow in one of these brain-dead people,
p100
aVif you trigger the right spot,
p101
aVyou will see something every now and then.
p102
aVThere is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex.
p103
aVAnd this is \u2014 I'll demonstrate as best I can, not being dead.
p104
aVIt's like this. You trigger the spot.
p105
aVThe dead guy, or gal, goes... like that.
p106
aVVery unsettling for people working in pathology labs.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, if you can trigger the Lazarus reflex in a dead person,
p111
aVwhy not the orgasm reflex?
p112
aVI asked this question to a brain death expert,
p113
aVStephanie Mann, who was foolish enough to return my emails.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VI said, "So, could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person?"
p118
aVShe said, "Yes, if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated,
p119
aVyou conceivably could."
p120
aVObviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person.
p121
aVBut it would be an orgasm \u2014
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
Vnonetheless.
p126
aa(lp127
VThere is a researcher at the University of Alabama
p128
aVwho does orgasm research.
p129
aVI said to her, "You should do an experiment.
p130
aVYou know? You can get cadavers if you work at a university."
p131
aVI said, "You should actually do this."
p132
aVShe said, "You get the human subjects review board approval for this one."
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VAccording to 1930s marriage manual author,
p137
aVTheodoor van De Velde,
p138
aVa slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman
p139
aVwithin about an hour after sexual intercourse.
p140
aVTheodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VThis is a guy writing a book, "Ideal Marriage," you know.
p145
aVVery heavy hetero guy.
p146
aVBut he wrote in this book, "Ideal Marriage" \u2014
p147
aVhe said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man,
p148
aVwhich he said had a fresh, exhilarating smell,
p149
aVand the semen of mature men, whose semen smelled, quote,
p150
aV"Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut.
p151
aVSometimes quite freshly floral,
p152
aVand then again sometimes extremely pungent."
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VOkay. In 1999, in the state of Israel, a man began hiccupping.
p157
aVAnd this was one of those cases that went on and on.
p158
aVHe tried everything his friends suggested.
p159
aVNothing seemed to help.
p160
aVDays went by.
p161
aVAt a certain point, the man, still hiccupping, had sex with his wife.
p162
aVAnd lo and behold, the hiccups went away.
p163
aVHe told his doctor, who published a case report
p164
aVin a Canadian medical journal under the title,
p165
aV"Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups."
p166
aVI love this article because at a certain point they suggested
p167
aVthat unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VI love that because there is like a whole demographic: unattached hiccuppers.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VMarried, single, unattached hiccupper.
p176
aVIn the 1900s, early 1900s,
p177
aVa lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm,
p178
aVthe contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix
p179
aVand sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg,
p180
aVthereby upping the odds of conception.
p181
aVIt was called the "upsuck" theory.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VIf you go all the way back to Hippocrates,
p186
aVphysicians believed that orgasm in women
p187
aVwas not just helpful for conception, but necessary.
p188
aVDoctors back then were routinely telling men
p189
aVthe importance of pleasuring their wives.
p190
aVMarriage-manual author and semen-sniffer Theodoor van De Velde \u2014
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
Vhas a line in his book.
p195
aVI loved this guy.
p196
aVI got a lot of mileage out of Theodoor van De Velde.
p197
aVHe had this line in his book
p198
aVthat supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy,
p199
aVwhere there was an empress Maria Theresa,
p200
aVwho was having trouble conceiving.
p201
aVAnd apparently the royal court physician said to her,
p202
aV"I am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty
p203
aVbe titillated for some time prior to intercourse."
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VIt's apparently, I don't know, on the record somewhere.
p208
aa(lp209
VMasters and Johnson:
p210
aVnow we're moving forward to the 1950s.
p211
aVMasters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics,
p212
aVwhich is also really fun to say.
p213
aVThey didn't buy it.
p214
aVAnd they decided, being Masters and Johnson,
p215
aVthat they would get to the bottom of it.
p216
aVThey brought women into the lab \u2014 I think it was five women \u2014
p217
aVand outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen.
p218
aVAnd in the artificial semen was a radio-opaque substance,
p219
aVsuch that it would show up on an X-ray.
p220
aVThis is the 1950s.
p221
aVAnyway, these women sat in front of an X-ray device.
p222
aVAnd they masturbated.
p223
aVAnd Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up.
p224
aVDid not find any evidence of upsuck.
p225
aVYou may be wondering, "How do you make artificial semen?"
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VI have an answer for you. I have two answers.
p230
aVYou can use flour and water, or cornstarch and water.
p231
aVI actually found three separate recipes in the literature.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VMy favorite being the one that says \u2014
p236
aVyou know, they have the ingredients listed,
p237
aVand then in a recipe it will say, for example,
p238
aV"Yield: two dozen cupcakes."
p239
aVThis one said, "Yield: one ejaculate."
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VThere's another way that orgasm might boost fertility.
p244
aVThis one involves men.
p245
aVSperm that sit around in the body for a week or more
p246
aVstart to develop abnormalities
p247
aVthat make them less effective at head-banging their way into the egg.
p248
aVBritish sexologist Roy Levin has speculated
p249
aVthat this is perhaps why men
p250
aVevolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators.
p251
aVHe said, "If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made."
p252
aVWhich I thought was an interesting idea, theory.
p253
aVSo now you have an evolutionary excuse.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VOkay.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VAll righty. There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom \u2014
p262
aVpigs, for instance.
p263
aVIn Denmark, the Danish National Committee for Pig Production
p264
aVfound out that if you sexually stimulate a sow
p265
aVwhile you artificially inseminate her,
p266
aVyou will see a six-percent increase in the farrowing rate,
p267
aVwhich is the number of piglets produced.
p268
aVSo they came up with this five-point stimulation plan for the sows.
p269
aVThere is posters they put in the barn, and they have a DVD.
p270
aVAnd I got a copy of this DVD.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VThis is my unveiling, because I am going to show you a clip.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VSo, okay.
p279
aVNow, here we go, la la la, off to work.
p280
aVIt all looks very innocent.
p281
aVHe's going to be doing things with his hands
p282
aVthat the boar would use his snout, lacking hands. Okay.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VThis is it.
p287
aVThe boar has a very odd courtship repertoire.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VThis is to mimic the weight of the boar.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VYou should know, the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina.
p296
aVSo this may be sort of titillating for her.
p297
aVHere we go.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd the happy result.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
VI love this video.
p306
aVThere is a point in this video, towards the beginning,
p307
aVwhere they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring,
p308
aVas if to say, "It's okay, it's just his job.
p309
aVHe really does like women."
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VOkay. When I was in Denmark, my host was named Anne Marie.
p314
aVAnd I said, "So why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig?
p315
aVWhy don't you have the farmers do that?
p316
aVThat's not one of your five steps."
p317
aVI have to read you what she said, because I love it.
p318
aVShe said, "It was a big hurdle
p319
aVjust to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva.
p320
aVSo we thought, let's not mention the clitoris right now."
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VShy but ambitious pig farmers, however, can purchase a \u2014 this is true \u2014
p325
aVa sow vibrator,
p326
aVthat hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate.
p327
aVBecause, as I mentioned, the clitoris is inside the vagina.
p328
aVSo possibly, you know, a little more arousing than it looks.
p329
aVAnd I also said to her,
p330
aV"Now, these sows. I mean, you may have noticed there.
p331
aVThe sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy."
p332
aVAnd she said, you can't make that conclusion,
p333
aVbecause animals don't register pain or pleasure
p334
aVon their faces in the same way that we do.
p335
aVPigs, for example, are more like dogs.
p336
aVThey use the upper half of the face; the ears are very expressive.
p337
aVSo you're not really sure what's going on with the pig.
p338
aa(lp339
VPrimates, on the other hand, we use our mouths more.
p340
aVThis is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd, interestingly, this has been observed in female macaques,
p345
aVbut only when mounting another female.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VMasters and Johnson.
p350
aVIn the 1950s, they decided, okay, we're going to figure out
p351
aVthe entire human sexual response cycle,
p352
aVfrom arousal, all the way through orgasm, in men and women \u2014
p353
aVeverything that happens in the human body.
p354
aVOkay, with women, a lot of this is happening inside.
p355
aVThis did not stop Masters and Johnson.
p356
aVThey developed an artificial coition machine.
p357
aVThis is basically a penis camera on a motor.
p358
aVThere is a phallus,
p359
aVclear acrylic phallus, with a camera and a light source,
p360
aVattached to a motor that is kind of going like this.
p361
aVAnd the woman would have sex with it.
p362
aVThat is what they would do. Pretty amazing.
p363
aVSadly, this device has been dismantled.
p364
aVThis just kills me, not because I wanted to use it \u2014
p365
aVI wanted to see it.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Laughter)
p368
aa(lp369
VOne fine day,
p370
aVAlfred Kinsey decided to calculate
p371
aVthe average distance traveled by ejaculated semen.
p372
aVThis was not idle curiosity.
p373
aVDoctor Kinsey had heard \u2014
p374
aVand there was a theory going around at the time, this being the 1940s \u2014
p375
aVthat the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix
p376
aVwas a factor in fertility.
p377
aVKinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work.
p378
aVHe got together in his lab
p379
aV300 men, a measuring tape, and a movie camera.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd in fact, he found that in three quarters of the men
p384
aVthe stuff just kind of slopped out.
p385
aVIt wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force.
p386
aVHowever, the record holder
p387
aVlanded just shy of the eight-foot mark, which is impressive.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter)
p390
aa(lp391
V(Applause)
p392
aa(lp393
VYes. Exactly.
p394
aa(lp395
V(Laughter)
p396
aa(lp397
VSadly, he's anonymous. His name is not mentioned.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
VIn his write-up of this experiment in his book,
p402
aVKinsey wrote,
p403
aV"Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets."
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VWhich is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey.
p408
aVMy favorite being, "Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats
p409
aVwill distract the female, but not the male."
p410
aa(lp411
V(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
VThank you very much.
p414
aa(lp415
V(Applause)
p416
aa(lp417
VThanks!

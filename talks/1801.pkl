p13
aVThat's a few samples of the theater, opera
p14
aVand films that I have done over the last 20 years.
p15
aVBut what I'd like to begin with right now
p16
aVis to take you back to a moment
p17
aVthat I went through in Indonesia,
p18
aVwhich is a seminal moment in my life
p19
aVand, like all myths,
p20
aVthese stories need to be retold
p21
aVand told, lest we forget them.
p22
aVAnd when I'm in the turbulent times, as we know,
p23
aVthat I am right now, through the crucible
p24
aVand the fire of transformation,
p25
aVwhich is what all of you do, actually.
p26
aVAnybody who creates knows there's that point where
p27
aVit hasn't quite become the phoenix or the burnt char.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVAnd I am right there on the edge,
p30
aVwhich I'll tell you about, another story.
p31
aVI want to go back to Indonesia
p32
aVwhere I was about 21, 22 years, a long time ago,
p33
aVon a fellowship.
p34
aVAnd I found myself, after two years there
p35
aVand performing and learning, on the island of Bali,
p36
aVon the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.
p37
aVAnd I was in a village where there was
p38
aVan initiation ceremony for the young men,
p39
aVa rite of passage.
p40
aVLittle did I know that it was mine as well.
p41
aVAnd as I sat in this temple square
p42
aVunder this gigantic beringin banyan tree,
p43
aVin the dark, there was no electricity, just the full moon,
p44
aVdown in this empty square,
p45
aVand I heard the most beautiful sounds,
p46
aVlike a Charles Ives concert
p47
aVas I listened to the gamelan music
p48
aVfrom all the different villagers that came
p49
aVfor this once-every-five-years ceremony.
p50
aVAnd I thought I was alone in the dark under this tree.
p51
aVAnd all of a sudden, out of the dark,
p52
aVfrom the other end of the square,
p53
aVI saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon.
p54
aVAnd these 20 old men who I'd seen before
p55
aVall of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes
p56
aVwith the headdress and the spears,
p57
aVand no one was in the square, and I was hidden in the shadows.
p58
aVNo one was there, and they came out,
p59
aVand they did this incredible dance.
p60
aV"Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha."
p61
aVAnd they moved their bodies and they came forward,
p62
aVand the lights bounced off these costumes.
p63
aVAnd I've been in theater since I was 11 years old,
p64
aVand performing, creating, and I went,
p65
aV"Who are they performing for
p66
aVwith these elaborate costumes,
p67
aVthese extraordinary headdresses?"
p68
aVAnd I realized that they were performing for God,
p69
aVwhatever that means.
p70
aVBut somehow, it didn't matter about the publicity.
p71
aVThere was no money involved.
p72
aVIt wasn't going to be written down. It was no news.
p73
aVAnd there were these incredible artists
p74
aVthat felt for me like an eternity as they performed.
p75
aVThe next moment,
p76
aVas soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows,
p77
aVa young man with a propane lantern came on,
p78
aVhung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.
p79
aVThe village square was filled with hundreds of people.
p80
aVAnd they put on an opera all night long.
p81
aVHuman beings needed the light.
p82
aVThey needed the light to see.
p83
aVSo what I gained and gathered from this incredible,
p84
aVseminal moment in my life as a young artist
p85
aVwas that you must be true
p86
aVto what you believe as an artist all the way through,
p87
aVbut you also have to be aware
p88
aVthat the audience is out there in our lives at this time,
p89
aVand they also need the light.
p90
aVAnd it's this incredible balance
p91
aVthat I think that we walk
p92
aVwhen we are creating something that is breaking ground,
p93
aVthat's trying to do something you've never seen before,
p94
aVthat imaginary world
p95
aVwhere you actually don't know where you're going to end up,
p96
aVthat's the fine line on the edge of a crater
p97
aVthat I have walked my whole life.
p98
aVWhat I would like to do now is to tell you
p99
aVa little bit
p100
aVabout how I work. Let's take "The Lion King."
p101
aVYou saw many examples of my work up there,
p102
aVbut it's one that people know.
p103
aVI start with the notion of the ideograph.
p104
aVAn ideograph is like a brush painting, a Japanese brush painting.
p105
aVThree strokes, you get the whole bamboo forest.
p106
aVI go to the concept of "The Lion King"
p107
aVand I say, "What is the essence of it?
p108
aVWhat is the abstraction?
p109
aVIf I were to reduce this entire story
p110
aVinto one image, what would it be?"
p111
aVThe circle. The circle. It's so obvious.
p112
aVThe circle of life. The circle of Mufasa's mask.
p113
aVThe circle that, when we come to Act II and there's a drought,
p114
aVhow do you express drought?
p115
aVIt's a circle of silk on the floor
p116
aVthat disappears into the hole in the stage floor.
p117
aVThe circle of life comes in the wheels
p118
aVof the gazelles that leap.
p119
aVAnd you see the mechanics.
p120
aVAnd being a theater person, what I know and love about the theater
p121
aVis that when the audience comes in
p122
aVand they suspend their disbelief,
p123
aVwhen you see men walking or women walking
p124
aVwith a platter of grass on their heads,
p125
aVyou know it's the savanna.
p126
aVYou don't question that.
p127
aVI love the apparent truth of theater.
p128
aVI love that people are willing to fill in the blanks.
p129
aVThe audience is willing to say,
p130
aV"Oh, I know that's not a real sun.
p131
aVYou took pieces of sticks.
p132
aVYou added silk to the bottom.
p133
aVYou suspended these pieces. You let it fall flat on the floor.
p134
aVAnd as it rises with the strings, I see that it's a sun.
p135
aVBut the beauty of it is that it's just silk and sticks.
p136
aVAnd in a way, that is what makes it spiritual.
p137
aVThat's what moves you.
p138
aVIt's not the actual literal sunrise that's coming.
p139
aVIt's the art of it.
p140
aVSo in the theater, as much as the story is critical
p141
aVand the book and the language,
p142
aVthe telling of the story, how it's told,
p143
aVthe mechanics, the methods that you use,
p144
aVis equal to the story itself.
p145
aVAnd I'm one who loves high tech and low tech.
p146
aVSo I could go from \u2014
p147
aVFor instance, I'll show you some "Spider-Man" later,
p148
aVthese incredible machines that move people along.
p149
aVBut the fact is, without the dancer
p150
aVwho knows how to use his body and swing on those wires,
p151
aVit's nothing.
p152
aVSo now I'm going to show you
p153
aVsome clips from the other big project of my life this year,
p154
aV"The Tempest."
p155
aVIt's a movie. I did "The Tempest" on a stage three times
p156
aVin the theater since 1984, '86,
p157
aVand I love the play.
p158
aVI did it always with a male Prospero.
p159
aVAnd all of a sudden, I thought,
p160
aV"Well, who am I gonna get to play Prospero?
p161
aVWhy not Helen Mirren? She's a great actor. Why not?"
p162
aVAnd this material really did work for a woman equally as well.
p163
aVSo now, let's take a look at some of the images
p164
aVfrom "The Tempest."
p165
aV(Music)
p166
aV(Video) Prospera: Hast thou, spirit, performed to the point the tempest that I bade thee?
p167
aVAriel: I boarded the king's ship. In every cabin, I flamed amazement.
p168
aVProspera: At first sight, they have changed eyes.
p169
aVMiranda: Do you love me?
p170
aVFerdinand: Beyond all limit.
p171
aVHM: They are both in either's powers.
p172
aVTrinculo: Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.
p173
aV(Music)
p174
aVLooking for business, governor?
p175
aVCaliban: Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
p176
aVStephano: Out of the moon, I do assure thee.
p177
aVProspera: Caliban!
p178
aVCaliban: This island is mine.
p179
aVProspera: For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps.
p180
aVAntonio: Here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon.
p181
aVSebastian: Draw thy sword.
p182
aVAnd I, the king, shall love thee.
p183
aVProspera: I will plague them all, even to roaring.
p184
aVAriel: I have made you mad.
p185
aVProspera: We are such stuff as dreams are made on.
p186
aVand our little life is rounded with a sleep.
p187
aV(Music)
p188
aVJT: Okay.
p189
aV(Applause)
p190
aVSo I went from theater, doing "The Tempest"
p191
aVon the stage in a very low-budget production
p192
aVmany years ago,
p193
aVand I love the play, and I also think
p194
aVit's Shakespeare's last play,
p195
aVand it really lends itself, as you can see, to cinema.
p196
aVBut I'm just going to give you a little example about
p197
aVhow one stages it in theater
p198
aVand then how one takes that same idea or story
p199
aVand moves it into cinema.
p200
aVThe ideograph that I talked to you about before,
p201
aVwhat is it for "The Tempest"?
p202
aVWhat, if I were to boil it down,
p203
aVwould be the one image that I could
p204
aVhang my hat on for this?
p205
aVAnd it was the sand castle,
p206
aVthe idea of nurture versus nature,
p207
aVthat we build these civilizations \u2014
p208
aVshe speaks about it at the end, Helen Mirren's Prospera \u2014
p209
aVwe build them, but under nature, under the grand tempest,
p210
aVthese cloud-capped towers, these gorgeous palaces will fade
p211
aVand there will \u2014 leave not a rack behind.
p212
aVSo in the theater, I started the play,
p213
aVit was a black sand rake, white cyc,
p214
aVand there was a little girl, Miranda, on the horizon,
p215
aVbuilding a drip castle, a sand castle.
p216
aVAnd as she was there on the edge of that stage,
p217
aVtwo stagehands all in black
p218
aVwith watering cans ran along the top
p219
aVand started to pour water on the sand castle,
p220
aVand the sand castle started to drip and sink,
p221
aVbut before it did,
p222
aVthe audience saw the black-clad stagehands.
p223
aVThe medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it.
p224
aVBut as they started to pour the water,
p225
aVthe light changed from showing you the black-clad stagehands
p226
aVto focusing, this rough magic that we do in theater,
p227
aVit focused right on the water itself.
p228
aVAnd all of a sudden, the audience's perspective changes.
p229
aVIt becomes something magically large.
p230
aVIt becomes the rainstorm.
p231
aVThe masked actors, the puppeteers, they disappear,
p232
aVand the audience makes that leap into this world,
p233
aVinto this imaginary world of "The Tempest" actually happening.
p234
aVNow the difference
p235
aVwhen I went and did it in the cinema,
p236
aVI started the actual movie
p237
aVwith a close-up of a sand castle, a black sand castle,
p238
aVand what cinema can do is,
p239
aVby using camera, perspective,
p240
aVand also long shots and close-ups,
p241
aVit started on a close-up of the sand castle,
p242
aVand as it pulled away,
p243
aVyou saw that it was a miniature sitting in the palm
p244
aVof the girl's hands.
p245
aVAnd so I could play with the medium,
p246
aVand why I move from one medium to another
p247
aVis to be able to do this.
p248
aVNow I'm going to take you to "Spider-Man."
p249
aV(Music)
p250
aV(Video) Peter Parker: \u266a Standing on the precipice,
p251
aVI can soar away from this. \u266a
p252
aVJT: We're trying to do everything in live theater
p253
aVthat you can't do in two dimensions
p254
aVin film and television.
p255
aVPP: \u266a Rise above yourself and take control. \u266a
p256
aVGeorge Tsypin: We're looking at New York from a Spider-Man point of view.
p257
aVSpider Man is not bound by gravity.
p258
aVManhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either.
p259
aVPP: \u266a Be yourself and rise above it all. \u266a
p260
aVEnsemble: \u266a Sock! Pow! \u266a
p261
aV\u266a Slam! Scratch! \u266a
p262
aVDanny Ezralow: I don't want you to even think there's a choreographer.
p263
aVIt's real, what's happening.
p264
aVI prefer you to see people moving,
p265
aVand you're going, "Whoa, what was that?"
p266
aV(Music)
p267
aVJT: If I give enough movement in the sculpture,
p268
aVand the actor moves their head, you feel like it's alive.
p269
aVIt's really comic book live. It's a comic book coming alive.
p270
aV(Music)
p271
aVBono: They're mythologies.
p272
aVThey're modern myths, these comic book heroes.
p273
aVPP: \u266a They believe. \u266a
p274
aV(Screams)
p275
aV(Music)
p276
aV(Applause)
p277
aVJT: Ohhhh. What was that?
p278
aVCircus, rock 'n' roll, drama.
p279
aVWhat the hell are we doing up there on that stage?
p280
aVWell, one last story, very quickly.
p281
aVAfter I was in that village, I crossed the lake,
p282
aVand I saw that the volcano was erupting
p283
aVon the other side, Gunung Batur,
p284
aVand there was a dead volcano next to the live volcano.
p285
aVI didn't think I'd be swallowed by the volcano,
p286
aVand I am here.
p287
aVBut it's very easy to climb up, is it not?
p288
aVYou hold on to the roots,
p289
aVyou put your foot in the little rocks
p290
aVand climb up there, and you get to the top,
p291
aVand I was with a good friend who was an actor,
p292
aVand we said, "Let's go up there.
p293
aVLet's see if we can come close to the edge
p294
aVof that live volcano."
p295
aVAnd we climbed up and we got to the very top,
p296
aVand we're on the edge, on this precipice,
p297
aVRoland disappears into the sulfur smoke
p298
aVat the volcano at the other end,
p299
aVand I'm up there alone
p300
aVon this incredible precipice.
p301
aVDid you hear the lyrics?
p302
aVI'm on the precipice looking down
p303
aVinto a dead volcano to my left.
p304
aVTo my right is sheer shale. It's coming off.
p305
aVI'm in thongs and sarongs. It was many years ago.
p306
aVAnd no hiking boots.
p307
aVAnd he's disappeared, this mad French gypsy actor,
p308
aVoff in the smoke, and I realize,
p309
aVI can't go back the way that I've come. I can't.
p310
aVSo I throw away my camera. I throw away my thongs,
p311
aVand I looked at the line straight in front of me,
p312
aVand I got down on all fours like a cat,
p313
aVand I held with my knees to either side
p314
aVof this line in front of me,
p315
aVfor 30 yards or 30 feet, I don't know.
p316
aVThe wind was massively blowing,
p317
aVand the only way I could get to the other side
p318
aVwas to look at the line straight in front of me.
p319
aVI know you've all been there.
p320
aVI'm in the crucible right now.
p321
aVIt's my trial by fire.
p322
aVIt's my company's trials by fire.
p323
aVWe survive because our theme song is "Rise Above."
p324
aVBoy falls from the sky, rise above.
p325
aVIt's right there in the palm of both of our hands,
p326
aVof all of my company's hands.
p327
aVI have beautiful collaborators, and we as creators
p328
aVonly get there all together.
p329
aVI know you understand that.
p330
aVAnd you just stay going forward,
p331
aVand then you see this extraordinary thing
p332
aVin front of your eyes.
p333
aVThank you.

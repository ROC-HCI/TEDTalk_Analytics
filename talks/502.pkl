VI started with paragliding.
p5
aVParagliding is taking off from mountains
p6
aVwith a paraglider, with the possibility to
p7
aVfly cross-country, distance,
p8
aVjust with the use of thermals to soar.
p9
aVAlso different aerobatic maneuvers are possible
p10
aVwith a paraglider.
p11
aa(lp12
VFrom there I started with skydiving.
p13
aVIn this picture you can see
p14
aVthere is a four-way skydive,
p15
aVfour people flying together,
p16
aVand on the left hand side it's the camera flier
p17
aVwith the camera mounted to his helmet
p18
aVso he can film the whole jump,
p19
aVfor the film itself and also for the judging.
p20
aa(lp21
VFrom regular, relative skydiving
p22
aVI went on to freeflying.
p23
aVFreeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.
p24
aVYou can see the skydiver with the red suit,
p25
aVhe's in a stand-up position.
p26
aVThe one with the yellow-green suit,
p27
aVhe's flying head-down.
p28
aVAnd that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation
p29
aVin freefall also, with the helmet cam
p30
aVto film this jump.
p31
aa(lp32
VFrom freeflying I went on to skysurfing.
p33
aVSkysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.
p34
aVYou can imagine with this big surface
p35
aVof a skysurfing board,
p36
aVthere is a lot of force, a lot of power.
p37
aVOf course I can use this power
p38
aVfor example for nice spinning \u2014 we call it "helicopter moves."
p39
aa(lp40
VFrom there I went on to wingsuit flying.
p41
aVWingsuit flying is a suit,
p42
aVthat I can make fly, just only with my body.
p43
aVIf I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit,
p44
aVI can make it fly. And as you see
p45
aVthe fall rate is much much slower
p46
aVbecause of the bigger surface.
p47
aVWith a proper body position I'm able to really move forward
p48
aVto gain quite some distance.
p49
aVThis is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.
p50
aVYou can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.
p51
aa(lp52
VFrom there with all the skills and knowledge
p53
aVfrom paragliding and all the different disciplines
p54
aVin skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.
p55
aVBASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects,
p56
aVlike buildings, antennae, bridges and earth \u2014
p57
aVmeaning mountains, cliffs.
p58
aVIt's for sure \u2014 for me \u2014 it's the ultimate feeling
p59
aVof being in free fall,
p60
aVwith all the visual references.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo my goal soon was to discover new places
p63
aVthat nobody had jumped before.
p64
aVSo in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump
p65
aVthe Eiger North Face in Switzerland.
p66
aVTwo years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn,
p67
aVa very famous mountain that probably
p68
aVeverybody knows in here.
p69
aV2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau,
p70
aVthree very famous mountains in Switzerland.
p71
aVThe special thing on these three jumps were,
p72
aVI hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.
p73
aVIn 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VSo with all this knowledge, I also
p77
aVwanted to get into stunts.
p78
aVSo with some friends we started to do different tricks,
p79
aVlike for example this jump here,
p80
aVI jumped from a paraglider.
p81
aVOr here \u2014 everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me,
p82
aVbecause it was very cold in Austria
p83
aVwhere we did this filming.
p84
aVEverybody sitting in a basket,
p85
aVand I was on top of the balloon,
p86
aVready to slide down with my skysurf board.
p87
aVOr this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VExtreme sports on top level like this
p91
aVis only possible if you practice step by step,
p92
aVif you really work hard on your skills
p93
aVand on your knowledge.
p94
aVOf course you need to be in physical, very good, condition,
p95
aVso I'm training a lot.
p96
aVYou need to have the best possible equipment.
p97
aVAnd probably the most important is
p98
aVyou have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.
p99
aVAnd all this to come as close as possible
p100
aVto the human dream of being able to fly.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo for 2009,
p103
aVI'm training hard for my two new projects.
p104
aVThe first one, I want to set a world record
p105
aVin flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.
p106
aVAnd I want to set a new record,
p107
aVwith the longest distance ever flown.
p108
aVFor my second project,
p109
aVI have a sensational idea
p110
aVof a jump that never has been done before.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo now, on the following movie you will see
p113
aVthat I'm much better in flying a wingsuit
p114
aVthan speaking in English.
p115
aVEnjoy, and thank you very much.
p116
aV(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VJune Cohen: I have some questions.
p121
aVI think we all might have some questions.
p122
aVQuestion one: so does that actually feel
p123
aVthe way the flying dream does?
p124
aVBecause it looks like it might.
p125
aa(lp126
VUeli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest
p127
aVpossibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.
p128
aa(lp129
VJC: I know the answer to this, but how do you land?
p130
aa(lp131
VUE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute
p132
aVjust seconds before, I would say, impact.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVIt's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.
p135
aa(lp136
VJC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those \u2014
p137
aVyou're not going to commit \u2014 are you among those trying to do it?
p138
aa(lp139
VUE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.
p140
aVWe're still working on it and we're
p141
aVdeveloping the wingsuits to get better performance,
p142
aVto get more knowledge.
p143
aVAnd I believe soon.
p144
aa(lp145
VJC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.
p146
aVWhat is the \u2014 there was exhaust coming
p147
aVout of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?
p148
aa(lp149
VUE: Nope. It's just smoke.
p150
aa(lp151
VJC: Coming off of you?
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VUE: Hopefully not.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VJC: That seems dangerous.
p160
aa(lp161
VUE: No, smoke is for two reasons,
p162
aVyou can see the speed, you can see the way
p163
aVwhere I was flying.
p164
aVThat's reason number one. And reason number two:
p165
aVit's much easier for the camera guy to film
p166
aVIf I'm using smoke.
p167
aa(lp168
VJC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke
p169
aVso that you can be tracked. One more question.
p170
aVWhat do you do to to cover your face?
p171
aVBecause I just keep thinking of going that fast
p172
aVand having your whole face smushed backwards.
p173
aVAre you in a helmet? Are you in goggles?
p174
aa(lp175
VUE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.
p176
aa(lp177
VJC: And is that how you usually fly?
p178
aa(lp179
VUE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet
p180
aVbecause of landings \u2014 usually it's difficult \u2014
p181
aVit's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.
p182
aVSo you have to be prepared.
p183
aa(lp184
VJC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?
p185
aVDo people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!"
p186
aVand do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to."
p187
aa(lp188
VUE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and \u2014
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VJC: ...a round of applause...
p193
aa(lp194
V(Applause)
p195
aa(lp196
VUE: Thank you very much.

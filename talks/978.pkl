VI learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.
p5
aVMy wife sent me a message,
p6
aV"Whoa, earthquake,"
p7
aVand then disappeared for 25 minutes.
p8
aVIt was 25 minutes of absolute terror
p9
aVthat thousands of people across the U.S. felt.
p10
aVI was afraid of a tsunami;
p11
aVwhat I didn't realize
p12
aVwas there was a greater terror in Haiti,
p13
aVand that was building collapse.
p14
aVWe've all seen the photos
p15
aVof the collapsed buildings in Haiti.
p16
aVThese are shots my wife took
p17
aVa couple days after the quake,
p18
aVwhile I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.
p19
aVThis is the national palace \u2014
p20
aVthe equivalent of the White House.
p21
aVThis is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean
p22
aVat peak shopping time.
p23
aVThis is a nurses' college \u2014
p24
aVthere are 300 nurses studying.
p25
aVThe general hospital right next door
p26
aVemerged largely unscathed.
p27
aVThis is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.
p28
aa(lp29
VWe have all heard
p30
aVabout the tremendous human loss
p31
aVin the earthquake in Haiti,
p32
aVbut we haven't heard enough
p33
aVabout why all those lives were lost.
p34
aVWe haven't heard about
p35
aVwhy the buildings failed.
p36
aVAfter all, it was the buildings,
p37
aVnot the earthquake,
p38
aVthat killed 220,000 people,
p39
aVthat injured 330,000,
p40
aVthat displaced 1.3 million people,
p41
aVthat cut off food
p42
aVand water and supplies
p43
aVfor an entire nation.
p44
aVThis is the largest metropolitan-area disaster
p45
aVin decades,
p46
aVand it was not a natural disaster \u2014
p47
aVit was a disaster of engineering.
p48
aa(lp49
VAIDG has worked in Haiti
p50
aVsince 2007,
p51
aVproviding engineering and business support
p52
aVto small businesses.
p53
aVAnd after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers
p54
aVto figure out why the buildings collapsed,
p55
aVto examine what was safe and what wasn't.
p56
aVWorking with MINUSTAH,
p57
aVwhich is the U.N. mission in Haiti,
p58
aVwith the Ministry of Public Works,
p59
aVwith different NGOs,
p60
aVwe inspected over 1,500 buildings.
p61
aVWe inspected schools
p62
aVand private residencies.
p63
aVWe inspected medical centers
p64
aVand food warehouses.
p65
aVWe inspected government buildings.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis is the Ministry of Justice.
p68
aVBehind that door
p69
aVis the National Judicial Archives.
p70
aVThe fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault \u2014
p71
aVwho's the director
p72
aVof the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research
p73
aVat the University of Buffalo \u2014
p74
aVwas examining it to see if it was safe
p75
aVto recover the archives.
p76
aVAndre told me,
p77
aVafter seeing these buildings fail
p78
aVagain and again in the same way,
p79
aVthat there is no new research here.
p80
aVThere is nothing here that we don't know.
p81
aVThe failure points were the same:
p82
aVwalls and slabs not tied properly into columns \u2014
p83
aVthat's a roof slab hanging off the building \u2014
p84
aVcantilevered structures,
p85
aVor structures that were asymmetric,
p86
aVthat shook violently and came down,
p87
aVpoor building materials,
p88
aVnot enough concrete,
p89
aVnot enough compression in the blocks,
p90
aVrebar that was smooth,
p91
aVrebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow there's a solution
p94
aVto all these problems.
p95
aVAnd we know how to build properly.
p96
aVThe proof of this came in Chile,
p97
aValmost a month later,
p98
aVwhen 8.8 magnitude earthquake
p99
aVhit Chile.
p100
aVThat is 500 times
p101
aVthe power of the 7.0
p102
aVthat hit Port-au-Prince \u2014
p103
aV500 times the power,
p104
aVyet only under a thousand casualties.
p105
aVAdjusted for population density,
p106
aVthat is less than one percent
p107
aVof the impact of the Haitian quake.
p108
aVWhat was the difference
p109
aVbetween Chile and Haiti?
p110
aVSeismic standards
p111
aVand confined masonry,
p112
aVwhere the building acts as a whole \u2014
p113
aVwalls and columns
p114
aVand roofs and slabs
p115
aVtied together to support each other \u2014
p116
aVinstead of breaking off into separate members and failing.
p117
aVIf you look at this building in Chile,
p118
aVit's ripped in half,
p119
aVbut it's not a pile of rubble.
p120
aVChileans have been building with confined masonry
p121
aVfor decades.
p122
aa(lp123
VRight now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers,
p124
aVArchitecture for Humanity,
p125
aVto bring more confined masonry training
p126
aVinto Haiti.
p127
aVThis is Xantus Daniel;
p128
aVhe's a mason,
p129
aVjust a general construction worker, not a foreman,
p130
aVwho took one of our trainings.
p131
aVOn his last job he was working with his boss,
p132
aVand they started pouring the columns wrong.
p133
aVHe took his boss aside,
p134
aVand he showed him the materials on confined masonry.
p135
aVHe showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.
p136
aVIt won't cost us any more
p137
aVto do it the right way."
p138
aVAnd they redid that building.
p139
aVThey tied the rebar right,
p140
aVthey poured the columns right,
p141
aVand that building will be safe.
p142
aVAnd every building
p143
aVthat they build going forward
p144
aVwill be safe.
p145
aa(lp146
VTo make sure these buildings are safe,
p147
aVit's not going to take policy \u2014
p148
aVit's going to take reaching out
p149
aVto the masons on the ground
p150
aVand helping them learn the proper techniques.
p151
aVNow there are many groups doing this.
p152
aVAnd the fellow in the vest there,
p153
aVCraig Toten,
p154
aVhe has pushed forward
p155
aVto get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.
p156
aVThrough Haiti Rewired,
p157
aVthrough Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,
p158
aVAIDG,
p159
aVthere is the possibility
p160
aVto reach out
p161
aVto 30,000 \u2014 40,000 masons
p162
aVacross the country
p163
aVand create a movement of proper building.
p164
aVIf you reach out to the people on the ground
p165
aVin this collaborative way
p166
aVit's extremely affordable.
p167
aVFor the billions spent on reconstruction,
p168
aVyou can train masons
p169
aVfor dollars on every house
p170
aVthat they end up building over their lifetime.
p171
aa(lp172
VUltimately, there are two ways
p173
aVthat you can rebuild Haiti;
p174
aVthe way at the top
p175
aVis the way that Haiti's been building for decades.
p176
aVThe way at the top
p177
aVis a poorly constructed building
p178
aVthat will fail.
p179
aVThe way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,
p180
aVwhere the walls are tied together,
p181
aVthe building is symmetric,
p182
aVand it will stand up to an earthquake.
p183
aVFor all the disaster,
p184
aVthere is an opportunity here
p185
aVto build better houses
p186
aVfor the next generation,
p187
aVso that when the next earthquake hits,
p188
aVit is a disaster \u2014
p189
aVbut not a tragedy.

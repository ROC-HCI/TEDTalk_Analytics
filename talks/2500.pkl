VToday, I am going to show you
p5
aVhow this tablet and this virtual-reality headset that I'm wearing
p6
aVare going to completely revolutionize science education.
p7
aVAnd I'm also going to show you
p8
aVhow it can make any science teacher more than twice as effective.
p9
aVBut before I show you how all of this is possible,
p10
aVlet's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education
p11
aVis so vitally important.
p12
aa(lp13
VIf you think about it,
p14
aVthe world is growing incredibly fast.
p15
aVAnd with that growth comes a whole list of growing challenges,
p16
aVchallenges such as dealing with global warming,
p17
aVsolving starvation and water shortages
p18
aVand curing diseases,
p19
aVto name just a few.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd who, exactly, is going to help us solve all of these great challenges?
p22
aVWell, to a very last degree, it is these young students.
p23
aVThis is the next generation of young, bright scientists.
p24
aVAnd in many ways, we all rely on them
p25
aVfor coming up with new, great innovations
p26
aVto help us solve all these challenges ahead of us.
p27
aVAnd so a couple of years back,
p28
aVmy cofounder and I were teaching university students just like these,
p29
aVonly the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd yes, this is really the reality out there
p34
aVin way too many universities around the world:
p35
aVstudents that are bored, disengaged
p36
aVand sometimes not even sure why they're learning about a topic
p37
aVin the first place.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo we started looking around for new, innovative teaching methods,
p40
aVbut what we found was quite disappointing.
p41
aVWe saw that books were being turned into e-books,
p42
aVblackboards were being turned into YouTube videos
p43
aVand lecture hall monologues were being turned into MOOCs \u2014
p44
aVmassive online open courses.
p45
aVAnd if you think about it,
p46
aVall we're really doing here is taking the same content
p47
aVand the same format,
p48
aVand bringing it out to more students \u2014
p49
aVwhich is great, don't get me wrong, that is really great \u2014
p50
aVbut the teaching method is still more or less the same,
p51
aVno real innovation there.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo we started looking elsewhere.
p54
aVWhat we found was that flight simulators had been proven over and over again
p55
aVto be far more effective
p56
aVwhen used in combination with real, in-flight training to train the pilots.
p57
aVAnd so we thought to ourselves:
p58
aVWhy not just apply that to science?
p59
aVWhy not build a virtual laboratory simulator?
p60
aa(lp61
VWell, we did it.
p62
aVWe basically set out to create
p63
aVa fully simulated, one-to-one, virtual reality laboratory simulator,
p64
aVwhere the students could perform experiments
p65
aVwith mathematical equations
p66
aVthat would simulate what would happen in a real-world lab.
p67
aVBut not just simple simulations \u2014
p68
aVwe would also create advanced simulations
p69
aVwith top universities like MIT,
p70
aVto bring out cutting-edge cancer research to these students.
p71
aVAnd suddenly, the universities could save millions of dollars
p72
aVby letting the students perform virtual experiments
p73
aVbefore they go into the real laboratory.
p74
aVAnd not only that; now, they could also understand \u2014
p75
aVeven on a molecular level inside the machine \u2014
p76
aVwhat is happening to the machines.
p77
aVAnd then they could suddenly perform
p78
aVdangerous experiments in the labs as well.
p79
aVFor instance also here,
p80
aVlearning about salmonella bacteria, which is an important topic
p81
aVthat many schools cannot teach for good safety reasons.
p82
aVAnd we, of course, quiz the students
p83
aVand then give the teachers a full dashboard,
p84
aVso they fully understand where the students are at.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut we didn't stop there,
p87
aVbecause we had seen just how important meaning is
p88
aVfor the students' engagement in the class.
p89
aVSo we brought in game designers
p90
aVto create fun and engaging stories.
p91
aVFor instance, here in this case,
p92
aVwhere the students have to solve a mysterious CSI murder case
p93
aVusing their core science skills.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd the feedback we got when we launched all of this
p96
aVwas quite overwhelmingly positive.
p97
aVHere we have 300 students,
p98
aVall passionately solving CSI murder cases
p99
aVwhile learning core science skills.
p100
aVAnd what I love the most about this
p101
aVis really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards,
p102
aVall surprised and a little confused,
p103
aVand say, "I just spent two hours in this virtual lab,
p104
aVand ... and I didn't check Facebook."
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VThat's how engaging and immersive this really is for the students.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd so, to investigate whether this really worked,
p111
aVa learning psychologist did a study with 160 students \u2014
p112
aVthat was from Stanford University and Technical University of Denmark.
p113
aVAnd what they did is split the students into two groups.
p114
aVOne group would only use the virtual laboratory simulations,
p115
aVthe other group would only use traditional teaching methods,
p116
aVand they had the same amount of time.
p117
aVThen, interestingly,
p118
aVthey gave the students a test before and after the experiment,
p119
aVso they could clearly measure the learning impact of the students.
p120
aVAnd what they found
p121
aVwas a surprisingly high 76 percent increase in the learning effectiveness
p122
aVwhen using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut even more interestingly,
p125
aVthe second part of this study investigated
p126
aVwhat the teacher's impact was on the learning.
p127
aVAnd what they found
p128
aVwas that when you combined the virtual laboratories
p129
aVwith teacher-led coaching and mentoring,
p130
aVthen we saw a total 101 percent increase in the learning effectiveness,
p131
aVwhich effectively doubles the science teacher's impact
p132
aVwith the same amount of time spent.
p133
aVSo a couple of months back,
p134
aVwe started asking ourselves \u2014
p135
aVwe have a wonderful team now of learning psychologists
p136
aVand teachers and scientists and game developers \u2014
p137
aVand we started asking ourselves:
p138
aVHow can we keep ourselves to our promise
p139
aVof constantly reimagining education?
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd today, I am really excited to be presenting what we came up with
p142
aVand have been working incredibly hard to create.
p143
aVI will explain briefly what this is.
p144
aVBasically, I take my mobile phone \u2014
p145
aVmost students already have these, smartphones \u2014
p146
aVand I plug it into this virtual-reality headset, a low-cost headset.
p147
aVAnd now what I can effectively do is,
p148
aVI can literally step into this virtual world.
p149
aVWe'll have some of you in the audience also get to try this,
p150
aVbecause it is really something that you have to try
p151
aVto fully feel how immersive it really is.
p152
aVIt literally feels like I just stepped inside this virtual lab.
p153
aVDo you see me up on the screen?
p154
aa(lp155
VAudience: Yes.
p156
aa(lp157
VMichael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo basically, I have just turned my mobile phone
p160
aVinto a fully simulated, million-dollar Ivy League laboratory
p161
aVwith all this amazing equipment that I can interact with.
p162
aVI can, for instance, pick up the pipette and do experiments with it.
p163
aVI have my E-Ggel, my PCR and \u2014 oh, look there,
p164
aVI have my next-generation sequencing machine,
p165
aVand there I even have my electron microscope.
p166
aVI mean, who's carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket?
p167
aVAnd here I have my machine,
p168
aVI can do different experiments on the machine.
p169
aVAnd over here I have the door,
p170
aVI can go into other experiments,
p171
aVI can perform in the laboratories.
p172
aVAnd here, I have my learning tablet.
p173
aVThis is an intelligent tablet
p174
aVthat allows me to read about relevant theory.
p175
aVAs you can see, I can interact with it.
p176
aVI can watch videos and see content that is relevant
p177
aVto the experiment that I'm performing right now.
p178
aVThen over here, I have Marie.
p179
aVShe is my teacher \u2014 my lab assistant \u2014
p180
aVand what she does is guides me through this whole laboratory.
p181
aVAnd very soon,
p182
aVthe teachers will be able to literally teleport themselves
p183
aVinto this virtual world that I'm in right now
p184
aVand help me, guide me, through this whole experiment.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd now before I finalize this,
p187
aVI want to show you an even cooler thing, I think \u2014
p188
aVsomething you cannot even do in real laboratories.
p189
aVThis is a PCR machine.
p190
aVI'm now going to start this experiment.
p191
aVAnd what I just did is literally shrunk myself a million times
p192
aVinto the size of a molecule \u2014
p193
aVand it really feels like it, you have to try this.
p194
aVSo now it feels like I'm standing inside the machine
p195
aVand I'm seeing all the DNA, and I see the molecules.
p196
aVI see the polymerase and the enzymes and so forth.
p197
aVAnd I can see how in this case,
p198
aVDNA is being replicated millions of times,
p199
aVjust like it's happening inside your body right now.
p200
aVAnd I can really feel and understand how all of this works.
p201
aa(lp202
VNow, I hope that gives you a little bit of a sense
p203
aVof the possibilities in these new teaching methods.
p204
aVAnd I want to also emphasize
p205
aVthat everything you just saw also works on iPads and laptops
p206
aVwithout the headsets.
p207
aVI say that for a very important reason.
p208
aVIn order for us to really empower and inspire
p209
aVthe next generation of scientists,
p210
aVwe really need teachers to drive the adoption
p211
aVof new technologies in the classroom.
p212
aVAnd so in many ways,
p213
aVI believe that the next big, quantum leap in science education
p214
aVlies no longer with the technology,
p215
aVbut rather with the teachers' decision
p216
aVto push forward and adopt these technologies
p217
aVinside the classrooms.
p218
aVAnd so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers
p219
aVwill collaborate with technology companies
p220
aVto realize this full potential.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd so,
p223
aVlastly, I'd like to leave you with a little story
p224
aVthat really inspires me.
p225
aVAnd that is the story of Jack Andraka.
p226
aVSome of you might already know him.
p227
aVJack invented a new, groundbreaking low-cost test for pancreatic cancer
p228
aVat the age 15.
p229
aVAnd when Jack shares his story of how he did this huge breakthrough,
p230
aVhe also explains that one thing almost prevented him
p231
aVfrom making this breakthrough.
p232
aVAnd that was that he did not have access to real laboratories,
p233
aVbecause he was too inexperienced
p234
aVto be allowed in.
p235
aa(lp236
VNow, imagine if we could bring
p237
aVIvy League, million-dollar virtual laboratories
p238
aVout to all these students just like Jack,
p239
aVall over the world,
p240
aVand give them the latest, greatest, most fancy machines you can imagine
p241
aVthat would quite literally make any scientist in here
p242
aVjump up and down out of pure excitement.
p243
aVAnd then imagine how that would empower and inspire
p244
aVa whole new generation of young and bright scientists,
p245
aVready to innovate and change the world.
p246
aa(lp247
VThank you very much.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Applause)

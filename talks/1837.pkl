VI think we're all aware
p5
aVthat the world today is full of problems.
p6
aVWe've been hearing them
p7
aVtoday and yesterday and every day for decades.
p8
aVSerious problems, big problems, pressing problems.
p9
aVPoor nutrition, access to water,
p10
aVclimate change, deforestation,
p11
aVlack of skills, insecurity, not enough food,
p12
aVnot enough healthcare, pollution.
p13
aVThere's problem after problem,
p14
aVand I think what really separates this time
p15
aVfrom any time I can remember in my brief time
p16
aVon Earth is the awareness of these problems.
p17
aVWe're all very aware.
p18
aa(lp19
VWhy are we having so much trouble
p20
aVdealing with these problems?
p21
aVThat's the question I've been struggling with,
p22
aVcoming from my very different perspective.
p23
aVI'm not a social problem guy.
p24
aVI'm a guy that works with business,
p25
aVhelps business make money.
p26
aVGod forbid.
p27
aVSo why are we having so many problems
p28
aVwith these social problems,
p29
aVand really is there any role for business,
p30
aVand if so, what is that role?
p31
aVI think that in order to address that question,
p32
aVwe have to step back and think about
p33
aVhow we've understood and pondered
p34
aVboth the problems and the solutions
p35
aVto these great social challenges that we face.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, I think many have seen business
p38
aVas the problem, or at least one of the problems,
p39
aVin many of the social challenges we face.
p40
aVYou know, think of the fast food industry,
p41
aVthe drug industry, the banking industry.
p42
aVYou know, this is a low point
p43
aVin the respect for business.
p44
aVBusiness is not seen as the solution.
p45
aVIt's seen as the problem now, for most people.
p46
aVAnd rightly so, in many cases.
p47
aVThere's a lot of bad actors out there
p48
aVthat have done the wrong thing,
p49
aVthat actually have made the problem worse.
p50
aVSo this perspective is perhaps justified.
p51
aa(lp52
VHow have we tended to see the solutions
p53
aVto these social problems,
p54
aVthese many issues that we face in society?
p55
aVWell, we've tended to see the solutions
p56
aVin terms of NGOs,
p57
aVin terms of government,
p58
aVin terms of philanthropy.
p59
aVIndeed, the kind of unique organizational entity
p60
aVof this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs
p61
aVand social organizations.
p62
aVThis is a unique, new organizational form
p63
aVthat we've seen grown up.
p64
aVEnormous innovation, enormous energy,
p65
aVenormous talent now has been mobilized
p66
aVthrough this structure
p67
aVto try to deal with all of these challenges.
p68
aVAnd many of us here are deeply involved in that.
p69
aa(lp70
VI'm a business school professor,
p71
aVbut I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits.
p72
aVWhenever I got interested and became aware
p73
aVof a societal problem, that was what I did,
p74
aVform a nonprofit.
p75
aVThat was the way we've thought about how to deal
p76
aVwith these issues.
p77
aVEven a business school professor has thought about it that way.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut I think at this moment,
p80
aVwe've been at this for quite a while.
p81
aVWe've been aware of these problems for decades.
p82
aVWe have decades of experience
p83
aVwith our NGOs and with our government entities,
p84
aVand there's an awkward reality.
p85
aVThe awkward reality is we're not making
p86
aVfast enough progress.
p87
aVWe're not winning.
p88
aVThese problems still seem very daunting
p89
aVand very intractable,
p90
aVand any solutions we're achieving
p91
aVare small solutions.
p92
aVWe're making incremental progress.
p93
aa(lp94
VWhat's the fundamental problem we have
p95
aVin dealing with these social problems?
p96
aVIf we cut all the complexity away,
p97
aVwe have the problem of scale.
p98
aVWe can't scale.
p99
aVWe can make progress. We can show benefits.
p100
aVWe can show results. We can make things better.
p101
aVWe're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good.
p102
aVWe can't scale.
p103
aVWe can't make a large-scale impact on these problems.
p104
aVWhy is that?
p105
aVBecause we don't have the resources.
p106
aVAnd that's really clear now.
p107
aVAnd that's clearer now than it's been for decades.
p108
aVThere's simply not enough money
p109
aVto deal with any of these problems at scale
p110
aVusing the current model.
p111
aVThere's not enough tax revenue,
p112
aVthere's not enough philanthropic donations,
p113
aVto deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now.
p114
aVWe've got to confront that reality.
p115
aVAnd the scarcity of resources
p116
aVfor dealing with these problems is only growing,
p117
aVcertainly in the advanced world today,
p118
aVwith all the fiscal problems we face.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo if it's fundamentally a resource problem,
p121
aVwhere are the resources in society?
p122
aVHow are those resources really created,
p123
aVthe resources we're going to need to deal
p124
aVwith all these societal challenges?
p125
aVWell there, I think the answer is very clear:
p126
aVThey're in business.
p127
aVAll wealth is actually created by business.
p128
aVBusiness creates wealth
p129
aVwhen it meets needs at a profit.
p130
aVThat's how all wealth is created.
p131
aVIt's meeting needs at a profit
p132
aVthat leads to taxes
p133
aVand that leads to incomes
p134
aVand that leads to charitable donations.
p135
aVThat's where all the resources come from.
p136
aVOnly business can actually create resources.
p137
aVOther institutions can utilize them
p138
aVto do important work,
p139
aVbut only business can create them.
p140
aVAnd business creates them
p141
aVwhen it's able to meet a need at a profit.
p142
aVThe resources are overwhelmingly
p143
aVgenerated by business.
p144
aVThe question then is, how do we tap into this?
p145
aVHow do we tap into this?
p146
aVBusiness generates those resources
p147
aVwhen it makes a profit.
p148
aVThat profit is that small difference
p149
aVbetween the price and the cost it takes to produce
p150
aVwhatever solution business has created
p151
aVto whatever problem they're trying to solve.
p152
aVBut that profit is the magic.
p153
aVWhy? Because that profit allows whatever solution
p154
aVwe've created
p155
aVto be infinitely scalable.
p156
aVBecause if we can make a profit,
p157
aVwe can do it for 10, 100, a million,
p158
aV100 million, a billion.
p159
aVThe solution becomes self-sustaining.
p160
aVThat's what business does
p161
aVwhen it makes a profit.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow what does this all have to do
p164
aVwith social problems?
p165
aVWell, one line of thinking is, let's take this profit
p166
aVand redeploy it into social problems.
p167
aVBusiness should give more.
p168
aVBusiness should be more responsible.
p169
aVAnd that's been the path that we've been on
p170
aVin business.
p171
aVBut again, this path that we've been on
p172
aVis not getting us where we need to go.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, I started out as a strategy professor,
p175
aVand I'm still a strategy professor.
p176
aVI'm proud of that.
p177
aVBut I've also, over the years,
p178
aVworked more and more on social issues.
p179
aVI've worked on healthcare, the environment,
p180
aVeconomic development, reducing poverty,
p181
aVand as I worked more and more in the social field,
p182
aVI started seeing something
p183
aVthat had a profound impact on me
p184
aVand my whole life, in a way.
p185
aa(lp186
VThe conventional wisdom in economics
p187
aVand the view in business has historically been
p188
aVthat actually, there's a tradeoff
p189
aVbetween social performance and economic performance.
p190
aVThe conventional wisdom has been
p191
aVthat business actually makes a profit
p192
aVby causing a social problem.
p193
aVThe classic example is pollution.
p194
aVIf business pollutes, it makes more money
p195
aVthan if it tried to reduce that pollution.
p196
aVReducing pollution is expensive,
p197
aVtherefore businesses don't want to do it.
p198
aVIt's profitable to have an unsafe working environment.
p199
aVIt's too expensive to have a safe working environment,
p200
aVtherefore business makes more money
p201
aVif they don't have a safe working environment.
p202
aVThat's been the conventional wisdom.
p203
aVA lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom.
p204
aVThey resisted environmental improvement.
p205
aVThey resisted workplace improvement.
p206
aVThat thinking has led to, I think,
p207
aVmuch of the behavior
p208
aVthat we have come to criticize in business,
p209
aVthat I come to criticize in business.
p210
aa(lp211
VBut the more deeply I got into all these social issues,
p212
aVone after another,
p213
aVand actually, the more I tried to address them
p214
aVmyself, personally, in a few cases,
p215
aVthrough nonprofits that I was involved with,
p216
aVthe more I found actually that the reality
p217
aVis the opposite.
p218
aVBusiness does not profit
p219
aVfrom causing social problems,
p220
aVactually not in any fundamental sense.
p221
aVThat's a very simplistic view.
p222
aVThe deeper we get into these issues,
p223
aVthe more we start to understand
p224
aVthat actually business profits
p225
aVfrom solving from social problems.
p226
aVThat's where the real profit comes.
p227
aVLet's take pollution.
p228
aVWe've learned today that actually
p229
aVreducing pollution and emissions
p230
aVis generating profit.
p231
aVIt saves money.
p232
aVIt makes the business more productive and efficient.
p233
aVIt doesn't waste resources.
p234
aVHaving a safer working environment actually,
p235
aVand avoiding accidents,
p236
aVit makes the business more profitable,
p237
aVbecause it's a sign of good processes.
p238
aVAccidents are expensive and costly.
p239
aVIssue by issue by issue, we start to learn
p240
aVthat actually there's no trade-off
p241
aVbetween social progress
p242
aVand economic efficiency
p243
aVin any fundamental sense.
p244
aVAnother issue is health.
p245
aVI mean, what we've found is actually
p246
aVhealth of employees is something
p247
aVthat business should treasure,
p248
aVbecause that health allows those employees
p249
aVto be more productive and come to work
p250
aVand not be absent.
p251
aVThe deeper work, the new work, the new thinking
p252
aVon the interface between business and social problems
p253
aVis actually showing that there's a fundamental,
p254
aVdeep synergy,
p255
aVparticularly if you're not thinking in the very short run.
p256
aVIn the very short run, you can sometimes
p257
aVfool yourself into thinking
p258
aVthat there's fundamentally opposing goals,
p259
aVbut in the long run, ultimately, we're learning
p260
aVin field after field that this is simply not true.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo how could we tap into
p263
aVthe power of business
p264
aVto address the fundamental problems
p265
aVthat we face?
p266
aVImagine if we could do that, because if we could do it,
p267
aVwe could scale.
p268
aVWe could tap into this enormous resource pool
p269
aVand this organizational capacity.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd guess what? That's happening now, finally,
p272
aVpartly because of people like you
p273
aVwho have raised these issues now
p274
aVfor year after year and decade after decade.
p275
aVWe see organizations like Dow Chemical
p276
aVleading the revolution away from trans fat
p277
aVand saturated fat with innovative new products.
p278
aVThis is an example of Jain Irrigation.
p279
aVThis is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology
p280
aVto thousands and millions of farmers,
p281
aVreducing substantially the use of water.
p282
aVWe see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria
p283
aVthat's figured out how to avoid
p284
aVtearing down old growth forest
p285
aVand using eucalyptus and getting much more yield
p286
aVper hectare of pulp
p287
aVand making much more paper than you could make
p288
aVby cutting down those old trees.
p289
aVYou see companies like Cisco that are training
p290
aVso far four million people in I.T. skills
p291
aVto actually, yes, be responsible,
p292
aVbut help expand the opportunity
p293
aVto disseminate I.T. technology
p294
aVand grow the whole business.
p295
aVThere's a fundamental opportunity for business today
p296
aVto impact and address these social problems,
p297
aVand this opportunity
p298
aVis the largest business opportunity
p299
aVwe see in business.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd the question is, how can we get business
p302
aVthinking to adapt this issue of shared value?
p303
aVThis is what I call shared value:
p304
aVaddressing a social issue with a business model.
p305
aVThat's shared value.
p306
aVShared value is capitalism,
p307
aVbut it's a higher kind of capitalism.
p308
aVIt's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be,
p309
aVmeeting important needs,
p310
aVnot incrementally competing for
p311
aVtrivial differences in product attributes
p312
aVand market share.
p313
aVShared value is when we can create social value
p314
aVand economic value simultaneously.
p315
aVIt's finding those opportunities
p316
aVthat will unleash the greatest possibility we have
p317
aVto actually address these social problems
p318
aVbecause we can scale.
p319
aVWe can address shared value at multiple levels.
p320
aVIt's real. It's happening.
p321
aa(lp322
VBut in order to get this solution working,
p323
aVwe have to now change how business sees itself,
p324
aVand this is thankfully underway.
p325
aVBusinesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom
p326
aVthat they shouldn't worry about social problems,
p327
aVthat this was sort of something on the side,
p328
aVthat somebody else was doing it.
p329
aVWe're now seeing companies
p330
aVembrace this idea.
p331
aVBut we also have to recognize business
p332
aVis not going to do this as effectively
p333
aVas if we have NGOs and government
p334
aVworking in partnership with business.
p335
aVThe new NGOs that are really moving the needle
p336
aVare the ones that have found these partnerships,
p337
aVthat have found these ways to collaborate.
p338
aVThe governments that are making the most progress
p339
aVare the governments that have found ways
p340
aVto enable shared value in business
p341
aVrather than see government as the only player
p342
aVthat has to call the shots.
p343
aVAnd government has many ways in which it could impact
p344
aVthe willingness and the ability of companies
p345
aVto compete in this way.
p346
aa(lp347
VI think if we can get business seeing itself differently,
p348
aVand if we can get others seeing business differently,
p349
aVwe can change the world.
p350
aVI know it. I'm seeing it.
p351
aVI'm feeling it.
p352
aVYoung people, I think,
p353
aVmy Harvard Business School students, are getting it.
p354
aVIf we can break down this sort of divide,
p355
aVthis unease, this tension,
p356
aVthis sense that we're not
p357
aVfundamentally collaborating here
p358
aVin driving these social problems,
p359
aVwe can break this down,
p360
aVand we finally, I think,
p361
aVcan have solutions.
p362
aa(lp363
VThank you.

VHow many people here have heard of PMS?
p5
aVEverybody, right?
p6
aVEveryone knows that women go a little crazy
p7
aVright before they get their period,
p8
aVthat the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster
p9
aVof irrationality and irritability.
p10
aVThere's a general assumption
p11
aVthat fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions
p12
aVand that the great majority of women are affected by this.
p13
aVWell, I am here to tell you that scientific evidence says
p14
aVneither of those assumptions is true.
p15
aVI'm here to give you  the good news about PMS.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut first, let's take a look at how firmly the idea of PMS
p18
aVis entrenched in American culture.
p19
aVIf you examine newspaper or magazine articles,
p20
aVyou'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS.
p21
aVIn an article in the magazine Redbook titled "You: PMS Free,"
p22
aVreaders were informed that between 80  to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.
p23
aVL.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers
p24
aVthat 40 to 50 percent of women suffer from PMS,
p25
aVand that it plays a major role in women's mental and physical health,
p26
aVand a couple of years ago, even the Wall Street Journal
p27
aVran an article on calcium as a treatment for PMS,
p28
aVasking its female readers,
p29
aV"Do you turn into a witch every month?"
p30
aa(lp31
VFrom all these articles, you would think there must be a mountain of research
p32
aVverifying the widespread nature of PMS.
p33
aVHowever, after five decades of research,
p34
aVthere's no strong consensus on the definition, the cause,
p35
aVthe treatment, or even  the existence of PMS.
p36
aVAs most commonly defined by psychologists,
p37
aVPMS involves negative behavioral, cognitive and physical symptoms
p38
aVfrom the time of ovulation to menstruation.
p39
aVBut here's where it gets tricky.
p40
aVOver 150 different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS,
p41
aVand here are just a few of those.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, I want to be clear here.
p44
aVI'm not saying women don't get some of these symptoms.
p45
aVWhat I'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms
p46
aVdoesn't amount to a mental disorder,
p47
aVand when psychologists come up with a disorder
p48
aVthat's so vaguely defined,
p49
aVthe label eventually becomes meaningless.
p50
aVWith a list of symptoms this long and wide,
p51
aVI could have PMS, you could have PMS,
p52
aVthe guy in the third row here could have PMS,
p53
aVmy dog could have PMS. (Laughter)
p54
aVSome researchers said you had to have five symptoms.
p55
aVSome said three.
p56
aVOther researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful
p57
aVif they were highly disturbing to you,
p58
aVbut others said minor symptoms were just as important.
p59
aVFor many years, because there was no standardization
p60
aVin the definition of PMS,
p61
aVwhen psychologists tried to report prevalence rates,
p62
aVtheir estimates ranged from five percent of women
p63
aVto 97 percent of women,
p64
aVso at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had PMS.
p65
aa(lp66
VOverall, the weaknesses in the methods of research on PMS have been considerable.
p67
aVFirst, many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively,
p68
aVlooking to the past and relying on memory,
p69
aVwhich is known to inflate reporting of PMS
p70
aVcompared to what's called prospective reporting,
p71
aVwhich involves keeping a daily log of symptoms
p72
aVfor at least two months in a row.
p73
aVMany studies also exclusively focused on white, middle-class women,
p74
aVwhich makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women.
p75
aVWe know there's a strong cultural component to the belief in PMS
p76
aVbecause it's nearly unheard of outside of Western nations.
p77
aVThird, many studies failed to use control groups.
p78
aVIf we want to understand the specific characteristics
p79
aVof women who have PMS,
p80
aVwe need to be able to compare them to women who don't have PMS.
p81
aVAnd finally, many different types of questionnaires were used
p82
aVto diagnose PMS, focusing on different symptoms,
p83
aVsymptom duration and severity.
p84
aVTo do reliable research on any condition,
p85
aVscientists must agree on the specific characteristics
p86
aVthat make up that condition
p87
aVso they're all talking about the same thing,
p88
aVand with PMS, this has not been the case.
p89
aa(lp90
VHowever, in 1994,
p91
aVthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
p92
aVknown as the DSM, thankfully \u2014
p93
aVit's also the manual for mental health professionals \u2014
p94
aVthey redefined PMS as PMDD,
p95
aVPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.
p96
aVAnd dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease.
p97
aVAnd according to these new DSM guidelines,
p98
aVin most menstrual cycles in the last year,
p99
aVat least five of 11 possible symptoms
p100
aVmust appear in the week before menstruation starts;
p101
aVthe symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun;
p102
aVand the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended.
p103
aVOne of these symptoms must come from this list of four:
p104
aVmarked mood swings, irritability, anxiety, or depression.
p105
aVThe other symptoms could come from the first slide
p106
aVor from those on the second slide,
p107
aVincluding symptoms like feeling out of control
p108
aVand changes in sleep or appetite.
p109
aVThe DSM also required now that the symptoms
p110
aVshould be associated with clinically significant distress \u2014
p111
aVthere should be some kind of disturbance in work
p112
aVor school or social relationships \u2014
p113
aVand that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented
p114
aVby keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row.
p115
aVAnd finally, the DSM required that the emotional disturbance
p116
aVshould be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder.
p117
aVSo scientifically speaking, this is an improvement.
p118
aVWe now have a limited number of symptoms,
p119
aVand a high impact on functioning that's required,
p120
aVand the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific.
p121
aVWell, using this criteria
p122
aVand looking at most recent studies,
p123
aVwe see that on average,
p124
aVthree to eight percent of women suffer from PMDD.
p125
aVNot all women, not most women,
p126
aVnot the majority of women, not even a lot of women:
p127
aVthree to eight percent.
p128
aVFor everyone else, variables like stressful events or happy occasions
p129
aVor even day of the week
p130
aVare more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month,
p131
aVand this is the information the scientific community has had
p132
aVsince the 1990s.
p133
aVIn 2002, my colleagues and I published an article
p134
aVdescribing the PMS and PMDD research,
p135
aVand several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals.
p136
aVThe questions is, why hasn't this information trickled down to the public?
p137
aVWhy do these myths persist?
p138
aa(lp139
VWell, certainly the onslaught of messages that women receive
p140
aVfrom books, TV, movies, the Internet, that everyone gets PMS
p141
aVgo a long way in convincing them it must be true.
p142
aVResearch tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets PMS,
p143
aVthe more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it.
p144
aVLet me tell you what I mean by "erroneously."
p145
aVYou might ask her, "Do you have PMS?"
p146
aVand she says yes,
p147
aVbut then, when you have her  keep a daily log
p148
aVof psychological symptoms for two months,
p149
aVno correlation is found between her symptoms
p150
aVand time of the month.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnother reason for the persistence of the PMS myth
p153
aVhas to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role.
p154
aVFeminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler
p155
aVhave suggested that taking on the label of PMS
p156
aVallows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered unladylike.
p157
aVThe near universal definition of a good woman
p158
aVis one who is happy, loving, caring for others,
p159
aVand taking great satisfaction from that role.
p160
aVWell, PMS has become a permission slip to be angry, complain, be irritated,
p161
aVwithout losing the title of good woman.
p162
aVWe know that the variables in a woman's environment
p163
aVare much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones,
p164
aVbut when she attributes anger to hormones,
p165
aVshe's absolved of responsibility or criticism.
p166
aV"Oh, that's not who she is. It's out of her control."
p167
aVAnd while this can be a useful tool, it serves to invalidate women's emotions.
p168
aVWhen people respond to a woman's anger
p169
aVwith the thought, "Oh, it's just that time of the month,"
p170
aVher ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo who else benefits from the myth of PMS?
p173
aVWell, I can tell you that treating PMS
p174
aVhas become a profitable,  thriving industry.
p175
aVAmazon.com currently offers over 1,900 books on PMS treatment.
p176
aVA quick Google search will bring up a cornucopia
p177
aVof clinics, workshops and seminars.
p178
aVReputable Internet sources of medical information
p179
aVlike WebMD or the Mayo Clinic list PMS as a known disorder.
p180
aVIt's not a known disorder, but they list it.
p181
aVAnd they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it,
p182
aVlike anti-depressants or hormones.
p183
aVInterestingly, though, both websites say that the success of medication
p184
aVin treating PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman.
p185
aVWell, that doesn't make sense.
p186
aVIf you've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause,
p187
aVwhich PMS is supposed to be,
p188
aVthen the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women.
p189
aVThis has not been the case with these treatments,
p190
aVand FDA regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective,
p191
aVa large portion of the target population
p192
aVshould see clinically significant improvement.
p193
aVSo we have not had that at all with these so-called treatments.
p194
aVHowever, the financial gain of perpetuating the myth
p195
aVthat PMS is a common mental disorder
p196
aVand is treatable is quite substantial.
p197
aVWhen women are prescribed drugs like anti-depressants or hormones,
p198
aVmedical protocol requires that they have physician follow-up every three months.
p199
aVThat's a lot of doctor visits.
p200
aVPharmaceutical companies reap untold profits
p201
aVwhen women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication
p202
aVfor all of their child-bearing lives.
p203
aVOver-the-counter drugs like Midol
p204
aVeven claim to treat PMS symptoms like tension and irritability,
p205
aVeven though they only contain a diuretic, a pain reliever
p206
aVand caffeine.
p207
aVNow, far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine,
p208
aVbut I don't think reducing tension is one of them.
p209
aVSince 2002, Midol has marketed a Teen Midol to adolescents.
p210
aVThey are aiming at young girls early,
p211
aVto convince them that everyone gets PMS and that it will make you a monster,
p212
aVbut wait, there's something you can do about it:
p213
aVTake Midol and you will be a human being again.
p214
aVIn 2013, Midol took in 48 million dollars in sales revenue.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo while perpetuating the myth of PMS has been lucrative for some,
p217
aVit comes with some serious adverse consequences for women.
p218
aVFirst, it contributes to the medicalization
p219
aVof women's reproductive health.
p220
aVThe medical field has a long history of conceptualizing
p221
aVwomen's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment,
p222
aVand this has come at many costs, including excessive Cesarean deliveries,
p223
aVhysterectomies and prescribed hormone treatments
p224
aVthat have harmed rather than enhanced women's health.
p225
aVSecond, the PMS myth also contributes to the stereotype of women
p226
aVas irrational and overemotional.
p227
aVWhen the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster
p228
aVthat turns women into angry beasts,
p229
aVit becomes easy to question  the competence of all women.
p230
aVWomen have made tremendous strides in the workforce,
p231
aVbut still there's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons
p232
aVof fields like government or business,
p233
aVand when we think about who makes for a good CEO or senator,
p234
aVsomeone who has qualities like  rationality, steadiness, competence
p235
aVcome to mind,
p236
aVand in our culture, that sounds more like a man than a woman,
p237
aVand the PMS myth contributes to that.
p238
aa(lp239
VPsychologists know that the moods of men and women
p240
aVare more similar than different.
p241
aVOne study followed men and women for four to six months
p242
aVand found that the number of mood swings they experienced
p243
aVand the severity of those mood swings were no different.
p244
aVAnd finally, the PMS myth keeps women from dealing
p245
aVwith the actual issues causing them emotional upset.
p246
aVIndividual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions
p247
aVor societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty
p248
aVare all strongly related to daily mood.
p249
aVSweeping emotions under the rug of PMS
p250
aVkeeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions,
p251
aVbut it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo the good news about PMS
p254
aVis that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle,
p255
aVthe great majority don't get a mental disorder.
p256
aVThey go to work or school, take care of their families,
p257
aVand function at a normal level.
p258
aVWe know the emotions and moods of men and women
p259
aVare more similar than different,
p260
aVso let's walk away from the tired old PMS myth of women as witches
p261
aVand embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning
p262
aVthe great majority of women live every day.
p263
aa(lp264
VThank you.

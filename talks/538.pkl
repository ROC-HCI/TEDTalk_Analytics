VSo sometimes I get invited to give weird talks.
p5
aVI got invited to speak to the people
p6
aVwho dress up in big stuffed animal costumes
p7
aVto perform at sporting events.
p8
aVUnfortunately I couldn't go.
p9
aVBut it got me thinking about
p10
aVthe fact that these guys, at least most of them,
p11
aVknow what it is that they do for a living.
p12
aVWhat they do is they dress up
p13
aVas stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events.
p14
aa(lp15
VShortly after that I got invited
p16
aVto speak at the convention of the people
p17
aVwho make balloon animals.
p18
aVAnd again, I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals.
p19
aVThere is a big schism between the ones who make
p20
aVgospel animals and porn animals, but \u2014
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVthey do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons.
p23
aVSometimes they get in trouble, but not often.
p24
aVAnd the other thing about these guys
p25
aVis, they also know what they do for a living.
p26
aVThey make balloon animals.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut what do we do for a living?
p29
aVWhat exactly to the people watching this do every day?
p30
aVAnd I want to argue that what we do
p31
aVis we try to change everything.
p32
aVThat we try to find a piece of the status quo \u2014
p33
aVsomething that bothers us, something that needs to be improved,
p34
aVsomething that is itching to be changed \u2014 and we change it.
p35
aVWe try to make big, permanent, important change.
p36
aVBut we don't think about it that way.
p37
aVAnd we haven't spent a lot of time talking about
p38
aVwhat that process is like.
p39
aVAnd I've been studying it for a couple years.
p40
aVAnd I want to share a couple stories with you today.
p41
aa(lp42
VFirst, about a guy named Nathan Winograd.
p43
aVNathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA.
p44
aVAnd what you may not know about the history of the SPCA
p45
aVis, it was founded to kill dogs and cats.
p46
aVCities gave them a charter
p47
aVto get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them.
p48
aVIn a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed,
p49
aVmost of them within 24 hours of being scooped off of the street.
p50
aVNathan and his boss saw this,
p51
aVand they could not tolerate it.
p52
aVSo they set out to make San Francisco
p53
aVa no-kill city:
p54
aVcreate an entire city
p55
aVwhere every dog and cat,
p56
aVunless it was ill or dangerous,
p57
aVwould be adopted, not killed.
p58
aVAnd everyone said it was impossible.
p59
aVNathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance.
p60
aVAnd people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country
p61
aVflew to San Francisco
p62
aVto testify against them \u2014
p63
aVto say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane.
p64
aVThey persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community.
p65
aVHe connected with people who cared about this:
p66
aVnonprofessionals, people with passion.
p67
aVAnd within just a couple years,
p68
aVSan Francisco became the first no-kill city,
p69
aVrunning no deficit, completely supported by the community.
p70
aVNathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York \u2014
p71
aVa place as different from San Francisco
p72
aVas you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again.
p73
aVHe went from being a glorified dogcatcher
p74
aVto completely transforming the community.
p75
aVAnd then he went to North Carolina and did it again.
p76
aVAnd he went to Reno and he did it again.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd when I think about what Nathan did,
p79
aVand when I think about what people here do, I think about ideas.
p80
aVAnd I think about the idea that
p81
aVcreating an idea, spreading an idea
p82
aVhas a lot behind it.
p83
aVI don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding,
p84
aVbut what they do is, they take a light bulb
p85
aVand they smash it.
p86
aVNow there is a bunch of reasons for that, and stories about it.
p87
aVBut one reason is because it indicates a change,
p88
aVfrom before to after.
p89
aVIt is a moment in time.
p90
aVAnd I want to argue that we are living through
p91
aVand are right at the key moment
p92
aVof a change in the way ideas are created
p93
aVand spread and implemented.
p94
aa(lp95
VWe started with the factory idea:
p96
aVthat you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory
p97
aVthat could churn out change.
p98
aVWe then went to the TV idea,
p99
aVthat said if you had a big enough mouthpiece,
p100
aVif you could get on TV enough times, if you could buy enough ads, you could win.
p101
aVAnd now we're in this new model of leadership,
p102
aVwhere the way we make change
p103
aVis not by using money
p104
aVor power to lever a system,
p105
aVbut by leading.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle.
p108
aVHenry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.
p109
aVIt enables him to hire men
p110
aVwho used to get paid 50 cents a day
p111
aVand pay them five dollars a day.
p112
aVBecause he's got an efficient enough factory.
p113
aVWell with that sort of advantage
p114
aVyou can churn out a lot of cars.
p115
aVYou can make a lot of change. You can get roads built.
p116
aVYou can change the fabric of an entire country.
p117
aVThat the essence of what you're doing is you need
p118
aVever-cheaper labor,
p119
aVand ever-faster machines.
p120
aVAnd the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both.
p121
aVEver-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VSo we shift gears for a minute,
p125
aVand say, "I know: television;
p126
aVadvertising. Push push.
p127
aVTake a good idea and push it on the world.
p128
aVI have a better mousetrap.
p129
aVAnd if I can just get enough money to tell enough people, I'll sell enough."
p130
aVAnd you can build an entire industry on that.
p131
aVIf necessary you can put babies in your ads.
p132
aVIf necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff.
p133
aVAnd if babies don't work, you can use doctors.
p134
aVBut be careful.
p135
aVBecause you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition,
p136
aVwhere you're talking about one thing instead of the other.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVThis model requires you to act like the king,
p139
aVlike the person in the front of the room
p140
aVthrowing things to the peons in the back.
p141
aVThat you are in charge, and you're going to tell people
p142
aVwhat to do next.
p143
aVThe quick little diagram of it is, you're up here,
p144
aVand you are pushing it out to the world.
p145
aVThis method \u2014 mass marketing \u2014
p146
aVrequires average ideas,
p147
aVbecause you're going to the masses,
p148
aVand plenty of ads.
p149
aVWhat we've done as spammers
p150
aVis tried to hypnotize everyone
p151
aVinto buying our idea,
p152
aVhypnotize everyone into donating to our cause,
p153
aVhypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate.
p154
aVAnd, unfortunately, it doesn't work so well anymore either.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VBut there is good news around the corner \u2014 really good news.
p158
aVI call it the idea of tribes.
p159
aVWhat tribes are, is a very simple concept
p160
aVthat goes back 50,000 years.
p161
aVIt's about leading and connecting people and ideas.
p162
aVAnd it's something that people have wanted forever.
p163
aVLots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe, or a church tribe,
p164
aVhaving a work tribe,
p165
aVhaving a community tribe.
p166
aVBut now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media,
p167
aVthanks to a lot of other things
p168
aVthat are bubbling through our society around the world,
p169
aVtribes are everywhere.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all.
p172
aVInstead what it's allowed is silos of interest.
p173
aVSo you've got the red-hat ladies over here.
p174
aVYou've got the red-hat triathletes over there.
p175
aVYou've got the organized armies over here.
p176
aVYou've got the disorganized rebels over here.
p177
aVYou've got people in white hats making food.
p178
aVAnd people in white hats sailing boats.
p179
aVThe point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers
p180
aVand connect with them,
p181
aVbecause you want to be connected.
p182
aVThat people on the fringes
p183
aVcan find each other, connect and go somewhere.
p184
aVEvery town that has a volunteer fire department
p185
aVunderstands this way of thinking.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VNow it turns out
p189
aVthis is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo.
p190
aVPeople I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon.
p191
aVAnd that what firemen do to train sometimes
p192
aVis they take a house that is going to be torn down,
p193
aVand they burn it down instead, and practice putting it out.
p194
aVBut they always stop and take a picture.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VYou know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one.
p198
aVThey've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches.
p199
aVYou can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe.
p200
aVAnd it turns out that it's tribes \u2014
p201
aVnot money, not factories \u2014
p202
aVthat can change our world, that can change politics,
p203
aVthat can align large numbers of people.
p204
aVNot because you force them to do something against their will,
p205
aVbut because they wanted to connect.
p206
aa(lp207
VThat what we do for a living now,
p208
aVall of us, I think,
p209
aVis find something worth changing,
p210
aVand then assemble tribes that assemble tribes
p211
aVthat spread the idea and spread the idea.
p212
aVAnd it becomes something far bigger than ourselves,
p213
aVit becomes a movement.
p214
aVSo when Al Gore set out
p215
aVto change the world again,
p216
aVhe didn't do it by himself.
p217
aVAnd he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads.
p218
aVHe did it by creating a movement.
p219
aVThousands of people around the country
p220
aVwho could give his presentation for him,
p221
aVbecause he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night.
p222
aa(lp223
VYou don't need everyone.
p224
aVWhat Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need,
p225
aVI don't know, a thousand true fans \u2014
p226
aVa thousand people who care enough
p227
aVthat they will get you the next round
p228
aVand the next round and the next round.
p229
aVAnd that means that the idea you create, the product you create,
p230
aVthe movement you create isn't for everyone,
p231
aVit's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about.
p232
aVWhat it's about instead
p233
aVis finding the true believers.
p234
aVIt's easy to look at what I've said so far,
p235
aVand say, "Wait a minute, I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader."
p236
aa(lp237
VSo here are two leaders. They don't have a lot in common.
p238
aVThey're about the same age. But that's about it.
p239
aVWhat they did, though, is each in their own way,
p240
aVcreated a different way
p241
aVof navigating your way through technology.
p242
aVSo some people will go out and get people to be on one team.
p243
aVAnd some people will get people to be on the other team.
p244
aa(lp245
VIt also informs the decisions you make
p246
aVwhen you make products or services.
p247
aVYou know, this is one of my favorite devices.
p248
aVBut what a shame that it's not organized
p249
aVto help authors create movements.
p250
aVWhat would happen if, when you're using your Kindle,
p251
aVyou could see the comments and quotes and notes
p252
aVfrom all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment.
p253
aVOr from your book group. Or from your friends, or from the circle you want.
p254
aVWhat would happen if authors, or people with ideas
p255
aVcould use version two, which comes out on Monday,
p256
aVand use it to organize people
p257
aVwho want to talk about something.
p258
aVNow there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here.
p259
aVBut let me just try a couple.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe Beatles did not invent teenagers.
p262
aVThey merely decided to lead them.
p263
aVThat most movements, most leadership that we're doing
p264
aVis about finding a group that's disconnected
p265
aVbut already has a yearning \u2014
p266
aVnot persuading people to want something
p267
aVthey don't have yet.
p268
aa(lp269
VWhen Diane Hatz worked on "The Meatrix,"
p270
aVher video that spread all across the internet
p271
aVabout the way farm animals are treated,
p272
aVshe didn't invent the idea of being a vegan.
p273
aVShe didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue.
p274
aVBut she helped organize people,
p275
aVand helped turn it into a movement.
p276
aa(lp277
VHugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected
p278
aVmiddle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them.
p279
aa(lp280
VBob Marley did not invent Rastafarians.
p281
aVHe just stepped up and said, "Follow me."
p282
aa(lp283
VDerek Sivers invented CD Baby,
p284
aVwhich allowed independent musicians
p285
aVto have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man \u2014
p286
aVto have place to take the mission
p287
aVthey already wanted to go to, and connect with each other.
p288
aa(lp289
VWhat all these people have in common is that they are heretics.
p290
aVThat heretics look at the status quo and say,
p291
aV"This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo.
p292
aVI am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward.
p293
aVI see what the status quo is; I don't like it."
p294
aVThat instead of looking at all the little rules
p295
aVand following each one of them,
p296
aVthat instead of being what I call a sheepwalker \u2014
p297
aVsomebody who's half asleep,
p298
aVfollowing instructions,
p299
aVkeeping their head down, fitting in \u2014
p300
aVevery once in a while someone stands up and says, "Not me."
p301
aVSomeone stands up and says, "This one is important.
p302
aVWe need to organize around it."
p303
aVAnd not everyone will. But you don't need everyone.
p304
aVYou just need a few people \u2014
p305
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p306
aVwho will look at the rules,
p307
aVrealize they make no sense,
p308
aVand realize how much they want to be connected.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store.
p311
aVZappos isn't a shoe store.
p312
aVZappos is the one, the only,
p313
aVthe best-there-ever-was
p314
aVplace for people who are into shoes to find each other,
p315
aVto talk about their passion,
p316
aVto connect with people who care more
p317
aVabout customer service than making a nickel tomorrow.
p318
aVIt can be something as prosaic as shoes,
p319
aVand something as complicated as overthrowing a government.
p320
aVIt's exactly the same behavior though.
p321
aa(lp322
VWhat it requires, as Geraldine Carter has discovered,
p323
aVis to be able to say, "I can't do this by myself.
p324
aVBut if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride,
p325
aVthen together we can get something that we all want.
p326
aVWe're just waiting for someone to lead us."
p327
aa(lp328
VMichelle Kaufman has pioneered
p329
aVnew ways of thinking about environmental architecture.
p330
aVShe doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.
p331
aVShe does it by telling a story
p332
aVto people who want to hear it.
p333
aVBy connecting a tribe of people
p334
aVwho are desperate to be connected to each other.
p335
aVBy leading a movement and
p336
aVmaking change.
p337
aVAnd around and around and around it goes.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo three questions I'd offer you.
p340
aVThe first one is, who exactly
p341
aVare you upsetting?
p342
aVBecause if you're not upsetting anyone, you're not changing the status quo.
p343
aVThe second question is, who are you connecting?
p344
aVBecause for a lot of people, that's what they're in it for:
p345
aVthe connections that are being made, one to the other.
p346
aVAnd the third one is, who are you leading?
p347
aVBecause focusing on that part of it \u2014
p348
aVnot the mechanics of what you're building,
p349
aVbut the who, and the leading part \u2014 is where change comes.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo Blake, at Tom's Shoes, had a very simple idea.
p352
aV"What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes
p353
aVI gave exactly the same pair to someone
p354
aVwho doesn't even own a pair of shoes?"
p355
aVThis is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus.
p356
aVIt's a story of a product that tells a story.
p357
aVAnd as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes
p358
aVand someone says, "What are those?"
p359
aVYou get to tell the story on Blake's behalf,
p360
aVon behalf of the people who got the shoes.
p361
aVAnd suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes.
p362
aVIt's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes.
p363
aa(lp364
VMy friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years
p365
aVfighting against juvenile diabetes.
p366
aVNot fighting the organization that's fighting it \u2014 fighting with them, leading them,
p367
aVconnecting them, challenging the status quo
p368
aVbecause it's important to him.
p369
aVAnd the people he surrounds himself with need the connection.
p370
aVThey need the leadership. It makes a difference.
p371
aa(lp372
VYou don't need permission from people to lead them.
p373
aVBut in case you do, here it is:
p374
aVthey're waiting, we're waiting
p375
aVfor you to show us where to go next.
p376
aVSo here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is, they challenge
p377
aVthe status quo.
p378
aVThey challenge what's currently there.
p379
aVThe second thing is, they build a culture.
p380
aVA secret language, a seven-second handshake,
p381
aVa way of knowing that you're in or out.
p382
aVThey have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe,
p383
aVcuriosity about outsiders. They're asking questions.
p384
aVThey connect people to one another.
p385
aVDo you know what people want more than anything?
p386
aVThey want to be missed.
p387
aVThey want to be missed the day they don't show up.
p388
aVThey want to be missed when they're gone.
p389
aVAnd tribe leaders can do that.
p390
aVIt's fascinating, because all tribe leaders have charisma,
p391
aVbut you don't need charisma to become a leader.
p392
aVBeing a leader gives you charisma.
p393
aVIf you look and study the leaders who have succeeded,
p394
aVthat's where charisma comes from \u2014 from the leading.
p395
aVFinally, they commit.
p396
aVThey commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe.
p397
aVThey commit to the people who are there.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo I'd like you to do something for me.
p400
aVAnd I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand.
p401
aVWhat I want you to do, it only takes 24 hours,
p402
aVis: create a movement.
p403
aVSomething that matters. Start. Do it. We need it.
p404
aVThank you very much. I appreciate it.

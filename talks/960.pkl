VHello. I would like to start my talk
p5
aVwith actually two questions, and the first one is:
p6
aVHow many people here actually eat pig meat?
p7
aVPlease raise your hand \u2014
p8
aVoh, that's a lot.
p9
aVAnd how many people have actually seen
p10
aVa live pig producing this meat?
p11
aVIn the last year?
p12
aa(lp13
VIn the Netherlands \u2014 where I come from \u2014
p14
aVyou actually never see a pig, which is really strange,
p15
aVbecause, on a population of 16 million people,
p16
aVwe have 12 million pigs.
p17
aVAnd well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.
p18
aVThey eat about one-third, and the rest is exported
p19
aVto all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world.
p20
aVA lot goes to the U.K., Germany.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd what I was curious about \u2014
p23
aVbecause historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bit
p24
aVso nothing would be wasted \u2014
p25
aVand I was curious to find out
p26
aVif this was actually still the case.
p27
aVAnd I spent about three years researching.
p28
aVAnd I followed this one pig
p29
aVwith number "05049,"
p30
aVall the way up until the end
p31
aVand to what products it's made of.
p32
aVAnd in these years, I met all kinds people
p33
aVlike, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical.
p34
aVBut I also met aluminum mold makers,
p35
aVammunition producers
p36
aVand all kinds of people.
p37
aVAnd what was striking to me
p38
aVis that the farmers actually had no clue
p39
aVwhat was made of their pigs,
p40
aVbut the consumers \u2014 as in us \u2014
p41
aVhad also no idea
p42
aVof the pigs being in all these products.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo what I did is,
p45
aVI took all this research
p46
aVand I made it into a \u2014 well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig,
p47
aVand it carries a duplicate of his ear tag
p48
aVon the back.
p49
aVAnd it consists of seven chapters \u2014
p50
aVthe chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs,
p51
aVblood, fat and miscellaneous.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVIn total,
p54
aVthey weigh 103.7 kilograms.
p55
aVAnd to show you how often you actually
p56
aVmeet part of this pig in a regular day,
p57
aVI want to show you some images of the book.
p58
aa(lp59
VYou probably start the day with a shower.
p60
aVSo, in soap, fatty acids
p61
aVmade from boiling pork bone fat
p62
aVare used as a hardening agent,
p63
aVbut also for giving it a pearl-like effect.
p64
aVThen if you look around you in the bathroom,
p65
aVyou see lots more products
p66
aVlike shampoo, conditioner,
p67
aVanti-wrinkle cream, body lotion,
p68
aVbut also toothpaste.
p69
aVThen, so, before breakfast,
p70
aVyou've already met the pig so many times.
p71
aVThen, at breakfast, the pig that I followed,
p72
aVthe hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig
p73
aVwere used as an improver of dough.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVWell, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough,
p76
aVof course."
p77
aVIn low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products,
p78
aVwhen you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out.
p79
aVSo what they do is they put gelatin back in,
p80
aVin order to retain the texture.
p81
aa(lp82
VWell, when you're off to work, under the road or under the buildings that you see,
p83
aVthere might very well be cellular concrete,
p84
aVwhich is a very light kind of concrete
p85
aVthat's actually got proteins from bones inside
p86
aVand it's also fully reusable.
p87
aVIn the train brakes \u2014 at least in the German train brakes \u2014
p88
aVthere's this part of the brake
p89
aVthat's made of bone ash.
p90
aVAnd in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts,
p91
aVlike chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding,
p92
aVeverything that's cooled in the supermarket,
p93
aVthere's gelatin to make it look good.
p94
aVFine bone china \u2014 this is a real classic.
p95
aVOf course, the bone in fine-bone china
p96
aVgives it its translucency
p97
aVand also its strength,
p98
aVin order to make these really fine shapes,
p99
aVlike this deer.
p100
aa(lp101
VIn interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.
p102
aVIt's used in paint for the texture,
p103
aVbut also for the glossiness.
p104
aVIn sandpaper, bone glue
p105
aVis actually the glue between the sand and the paper.
p106
aVAnd then in paintbrushes,
p107
aVhairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes
p108
aVbecause of their hard-wearing nature.
p109
aa(lp110
VI was not planning on showing you any meat
p111
aVbecause, of course, half the book's meat
p112
aVand you probably all know what meats they are.
p113
aVBut I didn't want you to miss out on this one,
p114
aVbecause this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts."
p115
aVAnd this is actually sold
p116
aVin the frozen area of the supermarket.
p117
aVAnd what it is \u2014 it's actually steak.
p118
aVSo, this is sold as cow,
p119
aVbut what happens when you slaughter a cow \u2014
p120
aVat least in industrial factory farming \u2014
p121
aVthey have all these little bits of steak left
p122
aVthat they can't actually sell as steak,
p123
aVso what they do is they glue them all together
p124
aVwith fibrin from pig blood
p125
aVinto this really large sausage,
p126
aVthen freeze the sausage, cut it in little slices
p127
aVand sell those as steak again.
p128
aVAnd this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.
p129
aVSo, with the steak, you might drink a beer.
p130
aVIn the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer,
p131
aVso to get rid of these cloudy elements,
p132
aVwhat some companies do
p133
aVis they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve
p134
aVin order to get rid of that cloudiness.
p135
aVThis actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice.
p136
aa(lp137
VThere's actually a company in Greece
p138
aVthat produces these cigarettes
p139
aVthat actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter.
p140
aVAnd according to them,
p141
aVthis creates an artificial lung in the filter.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVSo, this is actually a healthier cigarette.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVInjectable collagen \u2014 or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs \u2014
p146
aVhas been used for injecting into wrinkles.
p147
aVAnd the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings,
p148
aVso the collagen is as well.
p149
aVWell, this must be the strangest thing I found.
p150
aVThis is a bullet coming from
p151
aVa very large ammunition company in the United States.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd while I was making the book,
p154
aVI contacted all the producers of products
p155
aVbecause I wanted them to send me the real samples
p156
aVand the real specimens.
p157
aVSo I sent this company an email
p158
aVsaying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research.
p159
aVAnd can you send me a bullet?"
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVAnd well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email.
p162
aVBut they answered
p163
aVand they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story.
p164
aVAre you in anyway related to the Dutch government?"
p165
aVI thought that was really weird,
p166
aVas if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VSo, the most beautiful thing I found \u2014
p171
aVat least what I think is the most beautiful \u2014 in the book, is this heart valve.
p172
aVIt's actually a very low-tech
p173
aVand very high-tech product at the same time.
p174
aVThe low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve
p175
aVmounted in the high-tech bit,
p176
aVwhich is a memory metal casing.
p177
aVAnd what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart
p178
aVwithout open heart surgery.
p179
aVAnd once it's in the right spot,
p180
aVthey remove the outer shell,
p181
aVand the heart valve, well, it gets this shape
p182
aVand at that moment it starts beating, instantly.
p183
aVIt's really a sort of magical moment.
p184
aVSo this is actually a Dutch company,
p185
aVso I called them up, and I asked,
p186
aV"Can I borrow a heart valve from you?"
p187
aVAnd the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic.
p188
aVSo they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin,
p189
aVand you can borrow it."
p190
aVGreat \u2014 and then I didn't hear from them for weeks,
p191
aVso I called,
p192
aVand I asked, "What's going on with the heart valve?"
p193
aVAnd they said, "Well the director of the company
p194
aVdecided not to let you borrow this heart valve,
p195
aVbecause want his product
p196
aVto be associated with pigs."
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VWell, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy \u2014
p201
aVactually, to show that my first question,
p202
aVif pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true.
p203
aVWell it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else
p204
aVis made into a fuel
p205
aVthat can be used as renewable energy source.
p206
aa(lp207
VIn total, I found 185 products.
p208
aVAnd what they showed me
p209
aVis that, well, firstly,
p210
aVit's at least to say odd
p211
aVthat we don't treat these pigs
p212
aVas absolute kings and queens.
p213
aVAnd the second, is that we actually don't have a clue
p214
aVof what all these products that surround us are made of.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd you might think I'm very fond of pigs,
p217
aVbut actually \u2014 well, I am a little bit \u2014
p218
aVbut I'm more fond
p219
aVof raw materials in general.
p220
aVAnd I think that, in order to take better care
p221
aVof what's behind our products \u2014
p222
aVso, the livestock, the crops, the plants,
p223
aVthe non-renewable materials,
p224
aVbut also the people that produce these products \u2014
p225
aVthe first step would actually be to know that they are there.
p226
aa(lp227
VThank you very much.

For her first book, <em>Checked Baggage</em>, she purchased a container filled with a week&#39;s worth of objects confiscated at security checkpoints at Amsterdam&#39;s Schiphol Airport after 9/11. She meticulously categorized all 3,267 items and photographed them on a white seamless background. Her second book, <em>PIG 05049</em>, documents the astounding array of products that different parts of a pig named 05049 could support -- revealing the lines that link raw materials with producers, products and consumers that have become so invisible in an increasingly globalized world. <em>PIG 05049</em> was acquired by New York&#39;s Museum of Modern Art this winter. </p><p>With her product designs, Meindertsma <strong>plays with ancient, natural materials</strong> and processes. In a project for the Nature Conservancy last year, she made the sensuous Idaho rug, knitted from inch-thick felted wool yarn from the fleece of sheep at Lava Lake Ranch in Idaho. Each panel of the massive rug was knitted (on giant wooden needles) from the fleece of one sheep, using a different stitch per animal to display the personalities that make up a flock.</p>", "slug":

For her first book, <em>Checked Baggage</em>, she purchased a container filled with a week&#39;s worth of objects confiscated at security checkpoints at Amsterdam&#39;s Schiphol Airport after 9/11. She meticulously categorized all 3,267 items and photographed them on a white seamless background. Her second book, <em>PIG 05049</em>, documents the astounding array of products that different parts of a pig named 05049 could support -- revealing the lines that link raw materials with producers, products and consumers that have become so invisible in an increasingly globalized world. <em>PIG 05049</em> was acquired by New York&#39;s Museum of Modern Art this winter. </p><p>With her product designs, Meindertsma <strong>plays with ancient, natural materials</strong> and processes. In a project for the Nature Conservancy last year, she made the sensuous Idaho rug, knitted from inch-thick felted wool yarn from the fleece of sheep at Lava Lake Ranch in Idaho. Each panel of the massive rug was knitted (on giant wooden needles) from the fleece of one sheep, using a different stitch per animal to display the personalities that make up a flock.</p>", "slug":

VI don't know your name. Audience Member: Howard. Howard.
p5
aa(lp6
VThom Mayne: Howard? I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard, obviously,
p7
aVand he's going, I hope you're not next.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VAmazing. Amazing performance.
p12
aVI kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that.
p13
aVLet me start some place. I'm interested \u2014
p14
aVI kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body. (Laughter)
p15
aVAnd instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space,
p16
aVI work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter.
p17
aVAnd I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different
p18
aVbecause an architect versus, let's say, a dance company
p19
aVfinally is a negotiation between one's private world,
p20
aVone's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations,
p21
aVof inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world
p22
aVand all the limitations, the naysayers.
p23
aVBecause I have to say, for my whole career,
p24
aVif there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it.
p25
aVNo matter what I've done, what I've tried to do,
p26
aVeverybody says it can't be done.
p27
aVAnd it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various
p28
aVkind of realities that you confront with your ideas.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right,
p31
aVand you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place
p32
aVand the outside world, and then make it understood.
p33
aVI can start any number of places, because this process is also \u2014
p34
aVI think \u2014 very different from some of the morning sessions,
p35
aVwhich you had such a kind of very clear, such a lineal idea,
p36
aVlike the last one, say, with Howard,
p37
aVthat I think the creative process in architecture,
p38
aVthe design process, is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine.
p39
aVIt's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points
p40
aVis the circuitous line, not the straight line.
p41
aVAnd definitely my life has been part of that.
p42
aVI'm going to start with some simple kind of
p43
aVnotions of how we organize things.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world.
p46
aVWe make physical things, buildings
p47
aVthat become a part in an accretional process; they make cities.
p48
aVAnd those things are the reflection of the processes,
p49
aVand the time that they are made.
p50
aVAnd what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world
p51
aVand the territories which are useful as generative material.
p52
aVBecause, really, all I'm interested in, always, as an architect,
p53
aVis the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right?
p54
aVAnd it's not based on an a priori notion.
p55
aVI have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain
p56
aVand saying, "This is what it looks like." In fact, somebody mentioned \u2014
p57
aVEwan, maybe it was you in your introduction \u2014
p58
aVabout this is what architects \u2014
p59
aVdid somebody say it's what business people come to,
p60
aVit's what the corporate world comes to
p61
aVwhen they want to make it look like something at the end of the line? Huh. Wow.
p62
aVIt doesn't work that way for me at all.
p63
aVI have no interest in that whatsoever.
p64
aa(lp65
VArchitecture is the beginning of something, because it's \u2014
p66
aVif you're not involved in first principles,
p67
aVif you're not involved in the absolute,
p68
aVthe beginning of that generative process, it's cake decoration.
p69
aVAnd I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators,
p70
aVif anybody's involved in cake decorations \u2014
p71
aVit's not what I'm interested in doing. (Laughter)
p72
aVAnd so, in the formation of things, in giving it form,
p73
aVin concretizing these things,
p74
aVit starts with some notion of how one organizes.
p75
aVAnd I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities
p76
aVwhere a series of forces are brought to bear,
p77
aVand to understand the nature of the final result of that,
p78
aVrepresenting the building itself.
p79
aVThere's been a continual relationship between inventions,
p80
aVwhich are private, and reality, which has been important to me.
p81
aa(lp82
VA project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen 10 years ago,
p83
aVwhich was the modeling of a hippocampus \u2014
p84
aVthe territory of the brain that records short-term memory \u2014
p85
aVand the documentation of that, the imaginative and documentation of that
p86
aVthrough a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience.
p87
aVAnd it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer,
p88
aVobserving every kilometer a particular object of desire,
p89
aVand then placing that within this.
p90
aVAnd the notion was that I could make an organization
p91
aVnot built on normal coherencies, but built on non-sequiturs, built on randomness.
p92
aVAnd I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness
p93
aVas it produces architectural work
p94
aVand as it definitely connects to the notion of the city,
p95
aVan accretional notion of the city,
p96
aVand that led to various ideas of organization.
p97
aVAnd then this led to broader ideas of buildings
p98
aVthat come together through the multiplicity of systems.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd it's not any single system that makes the work.
p101
aVIt's the relationship \u2014 it's the dynamics between the systems \u2014
p102
aVwhich have the power to transform and invent
p103
aVand produce an architecture that is \u2014 that would otherwise not exist.
p104
aVAnd those systems could be identified,
p105
aVand they could be grouped together.
p106
aVAnd of course, today, with the technology of the computer
p107
aVand with the rapid prototyping, etc., we have the mechanisms
p108
aVto understand and to respond to these systems,
p109
aVand to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities
p110
aVbecause that's all we do.
p111
aVWe're producing spaces that accommodate human activity.
p112
aVAnd what I'm interested in is not the styling of that,
p113
aVbut the relationship of that as it enhances that activity.
p114
aVAnd that directly connects to ideas of city-making.
p115
aa(lp116
VThis is a project that we just finished in Penang
p117
aVfor a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process,
p118
aVwhich is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it.
p119
aVAnd the project \u2014 again, enormous, enormous competition \u2014
p120
aVon the Hudson River and in New York
p121
aVthat we were asked to do three years ago, which uses these processes.
p122
aVAnd what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do
p123
aVwith the generation of the city as one applies a methodology
p124
aVthat uses notions of these multiple forces,
p125
aVthat deals with the enormity of the problem, the complexity of the problem,
p126
aVwhen we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates.
p127
aVBecause one of the issues today is
p128
aVthat the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate,
p129
aVand as the aggregates get larger we require
p130
aVmore and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems.
p131
aVAnd that led us directly to the Olympic Village.
p132
aa(lp133
VI was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC.
p134
aVWe won the competition \u2014 what was it, nine months ago?
p135
aVAgain, a direct reflection from using these processes
p136
aVto develop extremely complicated, very large-scale organisms.
p137
aVAnd then, also, was working with broad strategies.
p138
aVIn this case, we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land,
p139
aVand the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village.
p140
aVAnd it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc.
p141
aVIts position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan \u2014 it's on Hunter's Point.
p142
aVAnd then the broader ideas of city-making
p143
aVstart having direct influences on architecture,
p144
aVon the elements that make up the broader scheme,
p145
aVthe buildings themselves, and start guiding us.
p146
aVArchitecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces
p147
aVthat could come from literally any place.
p148
aVAnd so I can start this discussion in any number of places,
p149
aVand I've chosen three or four to talk about.
p150
aVAnd it has also to do with an interest in
p151
aVthe vast kind of territory that architecture touches.
p152
aVIt literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base.
p153
aVThere's just no place that it doesn't somehow
p154
aVhave a connective tissue to.
p155
aa(lp156
VThis is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc.
p157
aVIt's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character.
p158
aVIt became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work,
p159
aVand it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface,
p160
aVand it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded
p161
aVand made into a very, kind of complex space.
p162
aVAnd the idea was the relationship of the space,
p163
aVwhich was made up of the fold of the image,
p164
aVand the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration,
p165
aVand the clarity of the image
p166
aVand the complexity of the space, which were in dialog.
p167
aVAnd it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work
p168
aVand how we make things,
p169
aVand it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces,
p170
aVand then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations.
p171
aVAnd this was the first prototype in Korea,
p172
aVas we're dealing with a dynamic envelope,
p173
aVand then the same characteristic of the fabric.
p174
aVIt has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous,
p175
aVand it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is.
p176
aVAnd that turned right away into another project.
p177
aa(lp178
VThis is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles.
p179
aVAnd now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated.
p180
aVAgain, it's a very, very simple notion.
p181
aVIf you look at most buildings,
p182
aVwhat you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building.
p183
aVAnd all of a sudden we're kind of moving away,
p184
aVand we're separating the skin from the body,
p185
aVand that's going to lead to broader performance criteria,
p186
aVwhich I'm going to talk about in a minute.
p187
aVAnd you're looking at how it drapes over
p188
aVand differentiates from the body.
p189
aVAnd then, again, the building itself,
p190
aVmiddle of Los Angeles, right across from City Hall.
p191
aVAnd as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up.
p192
aVIt's part of a sign system,
p193
aVwhich was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles \u2014
p194
aVthe two-dimension, three-dimension signing, etc.
p195
aVAnd then it allows one to penetrate the work itself.
p196
aVIt's transparent, and it allows you to understand, I think,
p197
aVwhat is always the most interesting thing in any building,
p198
aVwhich is the actual constructional processes that make it.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd it's probably the most intense kind of territory
p201
aVof the work, which is not occupied,
p202
aVbecause architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism
p203
aVwhen it's separated from function,
p204
aVand this is an area that allows for that.
p205
aVAnd then the skin starts transforming into other materials.
p206
aVWe're using light as a building material in this case.
p207
aVWe're working with Keith Sonnier in New York,
p208
aVand we're making this large outside room,
p209
aVwhich is possible in Los Angeles, and which is very much reflective
p210
aVof the urban, the contemporary urban environments
p211
aVthat you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City
p212
aVor Sao Paulo, etc.,
p213
aVthat have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time.
p214
aVAnd that was very much part of the notion
p215
aVof the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd, again, all of it promoting transparency.
p218
aVAnd an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium,
p219
aVthat light becomes literally a building material.
p220
aVWell, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope.
p221
aVAnd again, we're looking at an early sketch
p222
aVwhere I'm understanding now
p223
aVthat the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower.
p224
aVThis is a building in San Francisco which is under construction.
p225
aVAnd now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem,
p226
aVand it has to do with performance.
p227
aVThis will be the first building in the United States that took \u2014
p228
aVwell, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid.
p229
aVI wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.
p230
aVIt's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut we took the air conditioning out of the tower.
p233
aVThere's some air conditioning left in the base,
p234
aVbut the skin now moves on hydraulics.
p235
aVIt forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.
p236
aVIt adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning.
p237
aVHuge, huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta.
p238
aV10 of these \u2014 it's just under a million square feet \u2014
p239
aV800 and some thousand square feet \u2014
p240
aV10 of these would power Sausalito \u2014 the delta on this.
p241
aVAnd so now what we're looking at, as the projects get larger in scale,
p242
aVas they interface with broader problems,
p243
aVthat they expand the capabilities
p244
aVin terms of their performance.
p245
aVWell, I could also start here.
p246
aVWe could talk about the relationship
p247
aVat a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.
p248
aa(lp249
VWell, our research \u2014 my generation for sure,
p250
aVpeople who were going to school in the late '60s \u2014
p251
aVmade very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture,
p252
aVlooking at architecture within its own territory,
p253
aVand we were much more affected by film,
p254
aVby what was going on in the art world, etc.
p255
aVThis is, of course, Michael Heizer.
p256
aVAnd when I saw this, first an image and then visited,
p257
aVit completely changed the way I thought after that point.
p258
aVAnd I understood that building really could be
p259
aVthe augmentation of the Earth's surface,
p260
aVand it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense.
p261
aVAnd then \u2014 well, he was probably looking at this \u2014 this is Nazca;
p262
aVthis is 700 years ago \u2014 the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures.
p263
aVThey're just totally incredible.
p264
aVAnd that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw, how we work.
p265
aa(lp266
VThis is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona \u2014
p267
aVwell, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea.
p268
aVAnd it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable.
p269
aVSo it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work
p270
aVin the surface of that Earth.
p271
aVThere it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.
p272
aVAnd there it is, again, as it's starting to get resolved tectonically,
p273
aVand then there's the school.
p274
aVAnd, of course,
p275
aVwe're interested in participating with education.
p276
aVI have absolutely no interest in producing a building
p277
aVthat just accommodates X, Y and Z function.
p278
aVWhat I'm interested in are how these ideas
p279
aVparticipate in the educational process of young people.
p280
aVIt demands some sort of notion of inquiry
p281
aVbecause it's a system that's developed not sculpturally.
p282
aa(lp283
VIt's an idea that started from my first discussion.
p284
aVIt has to do with a broad, consistent logic,
p285
aVand that logic could be understood as one occupies the building.
p286
aVAnd there's an overt \u2014 at least,
p287
aVthere's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building
p288
aVthat connects to the land in a very different way
p289
aVbecause I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem,
p290
aVas one would understand that.
p291
aVAnd the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles
p292
aVthat uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea.
p293
aVThen, again, we're doing the headquarters for NOAA \u2014
p294
aVNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency \u2014
p295
aVoutside of Washington in Maryland.
p296
aVAnd this is how they see the world.
p297
aVThey have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles,
p298
aVand the site's in red.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd what we really want to do \u2014 well, the architects,
p301
aVif there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut;
p302
aVthis is the primitive hut that's been around for so long \u2014
p303
aVand what we wanted to do is really build this,
p304
aVbecause they see themselves as the caretakers of the world,
p305
aVand we wanted them to look down at their satellite,
p306
aVhow they see their own site, that eight-acre site,
p307
aVand we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green.
p308
aVThere's actually three baseball fields on it right now,
p309
aVand they're going to stay there.
p310
aVWe put one piece directly north-south,
p311
aVand it holds the dishes at the ears, right?
p312
aVAnd then right below that the processing, and the mission lift,
p313
aVand the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground.
p314
aVAnd what you look at is an aircraft carrier
p315
aVthat's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.
p316
aVAnd that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion,
p317
aVbroken up by a series of courts,
p318
aVand it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space
p319
aVfor their administrative offices.
p320
aVAnd then that, in turn, propelled us to look at
p321
aVlarger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface
p322
aVbecomes a connective tissue.
p323
aa(lp324
VThe new capital competition for Berlin, four years ago.
p325
aVAnd again we just finished the ECB \u2014
p326
aVactually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project,
p327
aVwhere the building was separated into a series of landscape elements
p328
aVthat became part of a connective tissue of a park,
p329
aVwhich is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves
p330
aVand becomes part of the connective fabric \u2014
p331
aVthe social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city.
p332
aVAnd the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing,
p333
aVbut something that's only inextricably connected
p334
aVto this city and this place at this time.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank,
p337
aVwhich again used this idea of connecting typology,
p338
aVthe traditional buildings, and morphology,
p339
aVor the relationship of the development of land as an idea,
p340
aVinto a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it
p341
aVis literally just this augmenting,
p342
aVthis movement of the land that's a very simple idea of
p343
aVjust lifting it up and occupying it,
p344
aVand other parts are much more energetic and intense.
p345
aVAnd talk about that intensity
p346
aVin terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make
p347
aVthat have to do with putting a series of systems together,
p348
aVand then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts.
p349
aVOne enters the building as it lifts off the ground,
p350
aVand it becomes part of the idea.
p351
aVAnd then the skin \u2014 the edges of this \u2014
p352
aVall promote the dynamic, the movement of the building
p353
aVas a series of seismic shifts, geologic shifts. Right?
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd it makes for event space and then it breaks in places
p356
aVthat allow you to peer into the interior, and those interiors, again,
p357
aVare promoting transparency for the workplace,
p358
aVwhich has been a continual interest of ours.
p359
aVAnd then, again, in a more, kind of traditional setting,
p360
aVthis is a graduate student housing in Toronto,
p361
aVand it's very much about the relationship of a building
p362
aVas it makes a connective tissue to the city.
p363
aVThe main idea was the gateway, where it breaks the site,
p364
aVand the building occupies both the public space and the private space.
p365
aVAnd it's that territory of \u2014 it's this thing.
p366
aVI visited the site many times, and everybody, kind of \u2014
p367
aVyou can see this from two kilometers away; it's an exact center of the street,
p368
aVand the whole notion is to engage the public,
p369
aVto engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd finally, one of the most interesting projects \u2014 it's a courthouse.
p372
aVAnd what I want to talk about \u2014 this is the Supreme Court, of course \u2014
p373
aVand, well, I'm dealing with Michael Hogan, the Chief Justice of Oregon.
p374
aVYou could not proceed without making this negotiation
p375
aVbetween one's own values and the relationship
p376
aVof the character you're working with and how he understands the court,
p377
aVbecause I'm showing him, of course, Corbusier at Savoy,
p378
aVwhich is 1928, which is the beginning of modern architecture.
p379
aVWell, then we get to this image.
p380
aVAnd this is where the project started. Because I'm going,
p381
aVI'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here.
p382
aVAnd really what we're talking about is constructing reality.
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd I'm a character that's extremely interested
p385
aVin understanding the nature of that constructed reality
p386
aVbecause there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone.
p387
aVNature in the 19th-century sense, alright?
p388
aVNature is only a cultural edifice today, right?
p389
aVWe construct it and we construct those ideas.
p390
aVAnd then of course, this one, our governor at the moment.
p391
aVAnd we spent some time with Conan, believe it or not,
p392
aVand then that led us to, kind of, the very differences of our worlds
p393
aVfrom a legal and an artistic, architectural.
p394
aVAnd it forced us to talk about notions of how we work,
p395
aVand the dynamics of that, and what other sources of the work is.
p396
aVAnd it led us to the project, the courthouse,
p397
aVwhich is absolutely a part of a negotiation
p398
aVbetween tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse.
p399
aVYou'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court.
p400
aVHere's a piano nobile, which is a device used in the Renaissance.
p401
aVThe courts were made of that. The skin is this series of layers
p402
aVthat reflect even rusticated stonework,
p403
aVbut which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution,
p404
aVwhich were part of the little process,
p405
aVall set on a plinth that defined it from the community.
p406
aVThank you so much.

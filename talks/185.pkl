VYou know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains,
p5
aVfar from these beautiful mountains, where the people
p6
aVof the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different,
p7
aVwhich is to measure their gross national happiness
p8
aVrather than their gross national product.
p9
aVAnd why not?
p10
aVAfter all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few,
p11
aVbut a fundamental human right for all.
p12
aVAnd what is happiness?
p13
aVHappiness is the freedom of choice.
p14
aVThe freedom to chose where to live,
p15
aVwhat to do, what to buy, what to sell,
p16
aVfrom whom, to whom, when and how.
p17
aVWhere does choice come from?
p18
aVAnd who gets to express it, and how do we express it?
p19
aa(lp20
VWell, one way to express choice is through the market.
p21
aVWell-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately,
p22
aVthe ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.
p23
aVThe great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prize
p24
aVfor demonstrating that famine is not so much about
p25
aVthe availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquire
p26
aVor entitle oneself to that food through the market.
p27
aVIn 1984, in what can only be considered one of the
p28
aVgreatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation
p29
aVin my country of birth, Ethiopia.
p30
aVNot because there was not enough food \u2014
p31
aVbecause there was actually a surplus of food
p32
aVin the fertile regions of the south parts of the country \u2014
p33
aVbut because in the north, people could not access
p34
aVor entitle themselves to that food.
p35
aVThat was a turning point for my life.
p36
aa(lp37
VMost Africans today, by far, are farmers.
p38
aVAnd most of Africa's farmers are, by and large,
p39
aVsmall farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small
p40
aVfarmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.
p41
aVAfrican agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.
p42
aVOnly seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated,
p43
aVcompared to 40 percent in Asia.
p44
aVAfrican farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare,
p45
aVcompared to 144 in Asia.
p46
aVRoad density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.
p47
aVThere are eight times more tractors in Latin America,
p48
aVand three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.
p49
aVThe small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice,
p50
aVand therefore without much freedom.
p51
aVHis livelihood is predetermined
p52
aVby the conditions of grinding poverty.
p53
aVHe comes to the market when prices are lowest,
p54
aVwith the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest,
p55
aVbecause he has no choice.
p56
aVShe comes back to the market
p57
aVsome months later, when prices are highest, in what we call
p58
aVthe lean season \u2014 when food is scarce \u2014
p59
aVbecause she has to feed her family and has no choice.
p60
aa(lp61
VThe real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa
p62
aVto harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship
p63
aVthat we know exists?
p64
aVAnother notable economist, Theodore Schultz,
p65
aVin 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers
p66
aVare efficient, but poor.
p67
aVMeaning, in fact, that farmers are rational
p68
aVand profit-minded just like everybody else.
p69
aVWell, we don't need, now,
p70
aVany more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake
p71
aVat the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.
p72
aVAnd one thing is clear, which is at least now we know
p73
aVthat Africa is open for business.
p74
aVAnd that business is agriculture.
p75
aVOver two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that markets
p76
aVmust be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.
p77
aVThis meant that governments were to remove themselves
p78
aVfrom the business of buying and selling \u2014
p79
aVwhich they did rather inefficiently \u2014
p80
aVand let the private market do its magic.
p81
aVWell, what happened over the last 25 years?
p82
aVDid Africa feed itself?
p83
aVDid our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?
p84
aa(lp85
VI think we're all in this room,
p86
aVprobably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region
p87
aVin the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up
p88
aVover the next 10 years,
p89
aVwhere the food import bill is now double
p90
aVwhat it was 20 years ago,
p91
aVwhere food production per capita has
p92
aVstagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.
p93
aVSo why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?
p94
aVThe market reforms prompted by the West \u2014
p95
aVand I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent
p96
aVdoing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed
p97
aVtraders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders \u2014
p98
aVtrying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.
p99
aVAnd it seems to me that the reforms might have
p100
aVthrown the baby out with the bath water.
p101
aa(lp102
VLike its agriculture,
p103
aVAfrica's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.
p104
aVWe know from our work around the continent
p105
aVthat transaction costs of reaching the market,
p106
aVand the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets,
p107
aVare extremely high.
p108
aVIn fact, only one third of agricultural output
p109
aVproduced in Africa even reaches the market.
p110
aVAfrica's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure
p111
aVin terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because
p112
aVof the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as
p113
aVmarket information, grades and standards,
p114
aVand reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.
p115
aVBecause of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles,
p116
aVin narrow networks of people they know and trust.
p117
aVAnd because of that, as grain changes hands \u2014
p118
aVand I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in
p119
aVits trajectory from the farmer to the consumer \u2014
p120
aVevery time it changes hands \u2014 and I've seen this all over rural Africa \u2014
p121
aVit also changes sacks.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd I thought that was incredibly peculiar.
p124
aVAnd really realized that that was because \u2014 as traders would tell me
p125
aVover and over \u2014 that's the only way people know what they're getting
p126
aVin terms of the quantity and the product quality.
p127
aVAnd that actually has huge implications
p128
aVfor the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals,
p129
aVand situations where there are deficits, for example.
p130
aVIt also has very high cost implications.
p131
aVI have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin
p132
aVis simply due to the fact that, because of the absence
p133
aVof grades and standards and market information,
p134
aVsacks have to be constantly changed.
p135
aVAnd this leads to very high handling costs.
p136
aVFor their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa,
p137
aVcome to the market with virtually no information at all \u2014 blind \u2014
p138
aVtrusting that they're going to have
p139
aVsome sort of demand for their produce,
p140
aVand completely at the mercy of the merchants
p141
aVin the only market, the nearest local market they know \u2014
p142
aVwhere they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk.
p143
aa(lp144
VSpeaking of risk, we have seen that price volatility
p145
aVof food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.
p146
aVIn Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.
p147
aVIn fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history
p148
aVthat farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk
p149
aVthat Africa's farmers have to bear.
p150
aVAnd in my view, there is simply no place in the world
p151
aVthat has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk
p152
aVthat our farmers in Africa today face.
p153
aVIn Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices
p154
aVfrom year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.
p155
aVThis kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implications
p156
aVfor not only the incentives of farmers to invest
p157
aVin higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers,
p158
aVbut also direct implications for food security.
p159
aa(lp160
VTo give you an example, between 2001 and 2002,
p161
aVEthiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.
p162
aVThat in turn, because of the weak marketing system,
p163
aVled to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.
p164
aVThis made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.
p165
aVAnd we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain
p166
aVwas left in the fields to rot in early 2002.
p167
aVNot six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis,
p168
aVto the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.
p169
aVWhat also happened that year
p170
aVis in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmers
p171
aVhad previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided
p172
aVto withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizer
p173
aVand actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.
p174
aVThis is a tragic example of arrested development,
p175
aVor a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.
p176
aVAnd this is not just specific to Ethiopia,
p177
aVbut happens over and over, all over Africa.
p178
aa(lp179
VWell, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.
p180
aVI am here to tell you that change is in the air.
p181
aVAfrica today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions,
p182
aVor cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.
p183
aVAfrica has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly,
p184
aVthat markets don't happen by themselves.
p185
aVIn the 1980s, it was very fashionable
p186
aVto talk about getting prices right.
p187
aVThere was a very influential book about that,
p188
aVwhich was mainly about getting governments out of the market.
p189
aVWe now recognize that getting markets right is about not just
p190
aVprice incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure
p191
aVand the appropriate and necessary institutions to create
p192
aVthe conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.
p193
aVWhen conditions are right, we know and see
p194
aVthat that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa,
p195
aVjust like anywhere else.
p196
aa(lp197
VNearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job
p198
aVas a World Bank senior economist in Washington
p199
aVand come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia,
p200
aVafter nearly 30 years abroad.
p201
aVI did so for a simple reason.
p202
aVAfter having spent more than a decade
p203
aVunderstanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors
p204
aVabout what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets,
p205
aVI decided it was time to do something about it.
p206
aVI currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiative
p207
aVto establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.
p208
aVNow, the commodity exchange itself, that concept,
p209
aVis not new to the world.
p210
aVIn fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together
p211
aVin a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan
p212
aVto establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.
p213
aa(lp214
VThat was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade,
p215
aVwhich is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.
p216
aVThe Chicago Board of Trade was established then
p217
aVfor precisely the same reasons
p218
aVthat our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.
p219
aVIn the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges
p220
aVand send it upriver to the Chicago market.
p221
aVBut once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found,
p222
aVor if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.
p223
aVAnd in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan,
p224
aVrather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.
p225
aVWell, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses
p226
aVled to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system
p227
aVof grading grain and receipting \u2014 issuing warehouse receipts
p228
aVon the basis of which trade could be done.
p229
aa(lp230
VFrom there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market,
p231
aVwhich is that buyers and sellers could transact grain
p232
aVwithout actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.
p233
aVThat meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances,
p234
aVand even across time \u2014 as far forward as 18 months into the future.
p235
aVThis innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture,
p236
aVand the rise of Chicago to a global market,
p237
aVagricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.
p238
aVNow, over the last century,
p239
aVwe tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview
p240
aVof Western industrialized countries,
p241
aVand that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa \u2014
p242
aVproducts produced mainly in the south \u2014
p243
aVare actually a reference price, or a price discovered in these
p244
aVorganized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.
p245
aVBut that is actually changing.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd we're seeing a shift \u2014
p248
aVpowered mainly because of information technology \u2014
p249
aVa shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.
p250
aVAnd over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges \u2014
p251
aVand this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world \u2014
p252
aVhas gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.
p253
aVSimilarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example,
p254
aVwhere rural farmers are using exchanges \u2014 growing here
p255
aVover the last three years by 270 percent a year.
p256
aVThis is powered by low-cost VSAT technology,
p257
aVaggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.
p258
aVChina's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago,
p259
aV2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become
p260
aVthe second largest commodity exchange in the world.
p261
aVNow, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing
p262
aVthe first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.
p263
aVWe're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model
p264
aVor the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored
p265
aVto Ethiopia's needs and realities,
p266
aVEthiopia's small farmers.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.
p269
aVWe're creating a system that serves all market actors,
p270
aVthat creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency
p271
aVand enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.
p272
aVIn the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia,
p273
aVwe've done something rather unique, which is to
p274
aVtake the approach of an integrated perspective,
p275
aVor what we call the ECX Edge.
p276
aVThe ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem
p277
aVin which the market will develop itself.
p278
aVAnd this is because one of the things we've learned
p279
aVover the last decade of studying market development in Africa
p280
aVis that the piecemeal approach does not work.
p281
aVYou've got one donor trying to develop market information,
p282
aVanother trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards,
p283
aVanother ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.
p284
aa(lp285
VIn our approach in Ethiopia,
p286
aVwe've decided to put together the entire ecosystem,
p287
aVor environment, in which trade takes place.
p288
aVThat means that the exchange will operate a trading system,
p289
aVwhich will initially start as an open outcry,
p290
aVbecause we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.
p291
aVBut at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange
p292
aVin the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like
p293
aVan Internet cafe in the rural areas.
p294
aVSo that farmers and small traders
p295
aVcan actually come to a terminal center \u2014 what we call
p296
aVthe remote access terminal centers \u2014 and actually,
p297
aVwithout having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up
p298
aVor any of those things, simply see the trading
p299
aVthat's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.
p300
aa(lp301
VAt the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that \u2014
p302
aVand again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange \u2014
p303
aVis that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country,
p304
aVin which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.
p305
aVAnd in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system,
p306
aVto assure that payment is done appropriately,
p307
aVin the right amount and at the right time,
p308
aVso that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.
p309
aVObviously, we work with exchange actors,
p310
aVand as we're developing the exchange market itself,
p311
aVwe're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework,
p312
aVthe overarching legal framework for making this market work.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo, in fact, our proclamation
p315
aVis going to parliament next month.
p316
aVWhat's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system
p317
aVto disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country,
p318
aVusing VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination
p319
aVdirectly to farmers.
p320
aVWhat this does is transforms, fundamentally,
p321
aVthe farmers' relationship to the market.
p322
aVWhereas before the farmer used to think local \u2014
p323
aVmeaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market,
p324
aVeight to 10 kilometers away on average,
p325
aVand sell whatever they happened to have,
p326
aVwithout any idea of what the price premium or anything else was \u2014
p327
aVnow farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.
p328
aVAnd they start to think national, and even global.
p329
aVThey start to make not only commercial marketing decisions,
p330
aVbut also planting decisions, on the basis of information
p331
aVcoming from the futures price market.
p332
aVAnd they come to the market knowing what grades their products
p333
aVwill achieve in terms of a price premium.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo all of this will transform farmers.
p336
aVIt will also transform the way traders do business.
p337
aVIt will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage
p338
aVto really thinking strategically about how to move grain
p339
aVacross long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].
p340
aVCan Ethiopia do this?
p341
aVIt seems very ambitious.
p342
aVBut it will create new opportunities.
p343
aVWe believe that this initiative requires great political will,
p344
aVand we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector,
p345
aVand really even the underlying legal framework.
p346
aVWe believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.
p347
aVECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium,
p348
aVwhich starts in about eight months.
p349
aa(lp350
VThe last parliament of our century opened with our president
p351
aVannouncing to the country that this was the most important
p352
aVeconomic initiative for the country today.
p353
aVWe believe that the stakes are high,
p354
aVbut that the returns will be even greater.
p355
aVECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market
p356
aVin agricultural commodities.
p357
aVEthiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.
p358
aVAnd we feel that over the next five years,
p359
aVif Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market,
p360
aVand add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.
p361
aVEthiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher
p362
aVthan South Africa's grain production,
p363
aVand, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.
p364
aVSo the potential is there.
p365
aVThe will is there.
p366
aVThe commitment is there.
p367
aVSo we feel that we have a winning value proposition
p368
aVto transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture,
p369
aVand to change Africa.
p370
aVSo, we are in the business of finding our happiness.
p371
aVThank you very much.

VHannah is excited to be going to college.
p5
aVShe couldn't wait to get out of her parents' house,
p6
aVto prove to them that she's an adult,
p7
aVand to prove to her new friends that she belongs.
p8
aa(lp9
VShe heads to a campus party
p10
aVwhere she sees a guy that she has a crush on.
p11
aVLet's call him Mike.
p12
aVThe next day, Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache.
p13
aVShe can only remember the night in flashes.
p14
aVBut what she does remember is
p15
aVthrowing up in the hall outside Mike's room
p16
aVand staring at the wall silently while he was inside her,
p17
aVwanting it to stop,
p18
aVthen shakily stumbling home.
p19
aVShe doesn't feel good about what happened,
p20
aVbut she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex in college is?"
p21
aa(lp22
VOne in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted
p23
aVat some point during their college career in the United States.
p24
aVLess than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school
p25
aVor to the police.
p26
aVAnd those who do, on average, wait 11 months to make the report.
p27
aa(lp28
VHannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own.
p29
aVBut when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties,
p30
aVshe's worried about them.
p31
aa(lp32
VAfter graduation, Hannah learns
p33
aVthat she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to.
p34
aVAnd this is not an unlikely scenario
p35
aVbecause 90 percent of sexual assaults
p36
aVare committed by repeat offenders.
p37
aVBut with such low reporting rates,
p38
aVit's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported,
p39
aVmuch less anything happen if they are.
p40
aa(lp41
VIn fact, only six percent of assaults reported to the police
p42
aVend with the assailant spending a single day in prison.
p43
aVMeaning, there's a 99 percent chance that they'll get away with it.
p44
aVThis means there's practically no deterrent to assault
p45
aVin the United States.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training.
p48
aVI'm interested in systems and networks
p49
aVand where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good.
p50
aVSo this, to me, is a tragic but a solvable problem.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago,
p53
aVit felt like a unique opportunity to make a change.
p54
aVAnd so we did.
p55
aVWe started by talking to college survivors.
p56
aVAnd what they wish they'd had in college is pretty simple;
p57
aVthey wanted a website,
p58
aVone they could use at the time and place
p59
aVthat felt safest to them
p60
aVwith clearly written information about their reporting options,
p61
aVwith the ability to electronically report their assault,
p62
aVrather than having the first step
p63
aVto go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them.
p64
aVWith the option to create a secure, timestamped document
p65
aVof what happened to them,
p66
aVpreserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet.
p67
aVAnd lastly, and perhaps most critically,
p68
aVwith the ability to report their assault
p69
aVonly if someone else reported the same assailant.
p70
aVYou see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything.
p71
aVIt changes the way you frame your own experience,
p72
aVit changes the way you think about your perpetrator,
p73
aVit means that if you do come forward,
p74
aVyou'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours.
p75
aa(lp76
VWe created a website that actually does this
p77
aVand we launched it [...] in August,
p78
aVon two college campuses.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd we included a unique matching system
p81
aVwhere if Mike's first victim had come forward,
p82
aVsaved her record, entered into the matching system
p83
aVand named Mike,
p84
aVand Mike's second victim had done the same thing
p85
aVa few months later,
p86
aVthey would have matched
p87
aVand the verified contact information of both survivors
p88
aVwould have been sent to the authorities at the same time
p89
aVfor investigation and follow up.
p90
aa(lp91
VIf a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers,
p92
aVit's more likely that they would have reported,
p93
aVthat they would have been believed,
p94
aVand that Mike would have been kicked off campus,
p95
aVgone to jail, or at least gotten the help that he needed.
p96
aVAnd if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike
p97
aVafter just their second assault following a match,
p98
aVsurvivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted
p99
aVin the first place.
p100
aVWe could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults
p101
aVjust by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on.
p102
aVAnd because we're creating a real deterrent to assault,
p103
aVfor perhaps the first time,
p104
aVmaybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe type of system I'm describing,
p107
aVthe type of system that survivors want
p108
aVis a type of information escrow,
p109
aVmeaning an entity that holds on to information for you
p110
aVand only releases it to a third party
p111
aVwhen certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met,
p112
aVsuch as a match.
p113
aVThe application that we built is for college campuses.
p114
aVBut the same type of system could be used in the military
p115
aVor even the workplace.
p116
aa(lp117
VWe don't have to live in a world
p118
aVwhere 99 percent of rapists get away with it.
p119
aVWe can create one
p120
aVwhere those who do wrong are held accountable,
p121
aVwhere survivors get the support and justice they deserve,
p122
aVwhere the authorities get the information they need,
p123
aVand where there's a real deterrent
p124
aVto violating the rights of another human being.
p125
aa(lp126
VThank you.

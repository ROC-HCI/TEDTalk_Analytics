VMany of you could ask the question, you know,
p5
aVwhy is a flying car, or maybe more accurately,
p6
aVa roadable aircraft, possible at this time?
p7
aVA number of years ago,
p8
aVMr. Ford predicted that flying cars
p9
aVof some form would be available.
p10
aVNow, 60 years later,
p11
aVI'm here to tell you why it's possible.
p12
aVWhen I was about five years old,
p13
aVnot very much \u2014 about a year after
p14
aVMr. Ford made his predictions,
p15
aVI was living in a rural part of Canada,
p16
aVon the side of a mountain in a very isolated area.
p17
aVGetting to school, for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age,
p18
aVthrough the Canadian winter, was not a pleasant experience.
p19
aVIt was a trying and scary thing
p20
aVfor a young kid to be going through.
p21
aa(lp22
VAt the end of my first year in school, in the summer of that year,
p23
aVI discovered a couple hummingbirds
p24
aVthat were caught in a shed near my home.
p25
aVThey'd worn themselves out,
p26
aVbeating themselves against the window,
p27
aVand, well, they were easy to capture.
p28
aVI took them outside and as I let them go, that split second, even though they were very tired,
p29
aVthat second I let them go they hovered for a second,
p30
aVthen zipped off into the distance.
p31
aVI thought, what a great way to get to school.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VFor a kid at that age, this was like infinite speed, disappearing,
p36
aVand I was very inspired by that.
p37
aVAnd so the next \u2014 over the next
p38
aVsix decades, believe it or not,
p39
aVI've built a number of aircraft,
p40
aVwith the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me,
p41
aVwhat the hummingbird does,
p42
aVand give you that flexibility.
p43
aVI've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor,
p44
aVafter the Latin word "volant," meaning,
p45
aVto fly in a light, nimble manner.
p46
aVVolantor-like helicopter, perhaps.
p47
aVThe FAA, the controlling body above all,
p48
aVcalls it a "powered lift aircraft."
p49
aVAnd they've actually issued a pilot's license \u2014
p50
aVa powerlift pilot's license \u2014 for this type of aircraft.
p51
aVIt's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that
p52
aVthere are no operational powered lift aircraft.
p53
aVSo for once, perhaps, the government is ahead of itself.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar."
p56
aVThis is a little bit earlier version of it,
p57
aVthat's why it's given the X designation,
p58
aVbut it's a four-passenger aircraft
p59
aVthat could take off vertically, like a helicopter \u2014
p60
aVtherefore it doesn't need an airfield.
p61
aVOn the ground, it's powered electrically.
p62
aVIt's actually classified as a motorcycle
p63
aVbecause of the three wheels, which is a great asset
p64
aVbecause it allows you, theoretically, to use this on the highways
p65
aVin most states, and actually in all cities.
p66
aVSo that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues
p67
aVof the automobile, forget it \u2014 you're never going to fly it.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VOne could say that a helicopter
p72
aVdoes pretty much what the hummingbird does,
p73
aVand gets around in much the same way, and it's true,
p74
aVbut a helicopter is a very complex device.
p75
aVIt's expensive \u2014
p76
aVso expensive that very few people could own or use it.
p77
aVIt's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity,
p78
aVas a series of parts \u2014 a large number of parts \u2014
p79
aVflying in formation.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnother difference, and I have to describe this,
p84
aVbecause it's very personal,
p85
aVanother great difference between the helicopter
p86
aVand the volantor \u2014
p87
aVin my case the Skycar volantor \u2014
p88
aVis the experience that I've had
p89
aVin flying both of those.
p90
aVIn a helicopter you feel \u2014 and it's still a remarkable sensation \u2014
p91
aVyou feel like you're being hauled up from above
p92
aVby a vibrating crane.
p93
aVWhen you get in the Skycar \u2014 and I can tell you,
p94
aVthere's only one other person that's flown it, but he had the same sensation \u2014
p95
aVyou really feel like you're being lifted up
p96
aVby a magic carpet,
p97
aVwithout any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable.
p98
aVAnd it's been a great motivator.
p99
aVI only get to fly this vehicle occasionally,
p100
aVand only when I can persuade my stockholders
p101
aVto let me do so,
p102
aVbut it's still one of those wonderful experiences
p103
aVthat reward you for all that time.
p104
aa(lp105
VWhat we really need is something to replace the automobile
p106
aVfor those 50-plus mile trips.
p107
aVVery few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips
p108
aVmake up 85 percent of the miles traveled in America.
p109
aVIf we can get rid of that,
p110
aVthen the highways will now be useful to you,
p111
aVas contrasted by what's happening
p112
aVin many parts of the world today.
p113
aVOn this next slide, is an interesting history
p114
aVof what we really have seen in infrastructure,
p115
aVbecause whether I give you a perfect Skycar,
p116
aVthe perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you
p117
aVunless you've got a system to use it in.
p118
aVI'm sure any of you have asked the question,
p119
aVyeah, are there great things up there \u2014 what am I going to do, get up there?
p120
aVIt's bad enough on a highway, what's it going to be like to be in the air?
p121
aVThis world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow
p122
aVis going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot,
p123
aVyou're going to be a passenger.
p124
aVAnd it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward.
p125
aa(lp126
VI can tell you, technically we can build Skycars \u2014
p127
aVmy God, we went to the moon!
p128
aVThe technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here.
p129
aVBut we have to have these priority changes,
p130
aVwe have to have infrastructure to go with this.
p131
aVHistorically you see that we got around
p132
aV200 years ago by canals,
p133
aVand as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads.
p134
aVAs that disappeared we came in with highways.
p135
aVBut if you look at that top corner \u2014 the highway system \u2014
p136
aVyou see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built,
p137
aVand that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways
p138
aVin the next 10 years.
p139
aVHowever, the next 10 years, if like the last 10 years,
p140
aVwe're going to see 30 percent more traffic.
p141
aVAnd where is that going to lead you to?
p142
aVSo the issue then, I've often asked, is
p143
aVwhen is it going to happen?
p144
aa(lp145
VWhen are we going to be able to have these vehicles?
p146
aVAnd of course, if you ask me, I'm going to give you a really optimistic view.
p147
aVAfter all, I've been spending 60 years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow.
p148
aVSo, I'm not going to quote myself on this.
p149
aVI'd prefer to quote someone else,
p150
aVwho testified with me before Congress,
p151
aVand in his position as head of NASA
p152
aVput forward this particular vision
p153
aVof the future of this type of aircraft.
p154
aVNow I would argue, actually, if you look at the fact that on the highways today,
p155
aVyou're only averaging about 30 miles per hour \u2014
p156
aVon average, according to the DOT \u2014
p157
aVthe Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour,
p158
aVup to 25,000 feet.
p159
aVAnd so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase
p160
aVin the ability to get around
p161
aVas far as speed is concerned.
p162
aa(lp163
VUnbeknownst to many of you,
p164
aVthe highway in the sky that I'm talking about here
p165
aVhas been under construction for 10 years.
p166
aVIt makes use of the GPS \u2014 you're familiar with GPS in your automobile,
p167
aVbut you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.,
p168
aVthere's a Russian GPS,
p169
aVand there's a new GPS system
p170
aVgoing to Europe, called Galileo.
p171
aVWith those three systems,
p172
aVyou have what is always necessary \u2014
p173
aVa level of redundancy that says,
p174
aVif one system fails, you'll still have a way
p175
aVto make sure that you're being controlled.
p176
aVBecause if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing,
p177
aVit's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you.
p178
aa(lp179
VHow would a trip in a Skycar work?
p180
aVWell, you can't right now
p181
aVtake off from your home because it's too noisy.
p182
aVI mean to be able to take off from your home, you'd have to be extremely quiet.
p183
aVBut it's still fairly quiet.
p184
aVYou'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport,
p185
aVwhich may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away.
p186
aVThis is clearly, as I said earlier, a roadable aircraft,
p187
aVand you're not going to spend that much time on the road.
p188
aVAfter all, if you can fly like that,
p189
aVwhy are you going to drive around on a highway?
p190
aVGo to a local vertiport,
p191
aVplug in your destination,
p192
aVdelivered almost like a passenger.
p193
aVYou can play computer games, you can sleep, you can read on the way.
p194
aVThis is the world \u2014 there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that \u2014
p195
aVand I've had a lot of bad feedback
p196
aVfrom people who want to be up there, flying around
p197
aVand experiencing that.
p198
aVAnd of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.
p199
aVBut the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.
p200
aVOr it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system.
p201
aa(lp202
VWe flew the first vehicle for the international press
p203
aVin 1965, when I really got it started.
p204
aVI was a professor at the U.C. Davis System,
p205
aVand I got a lot of excitement around this,
p206
aVand I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time.
p207
aVAnd then through the various years
p208
aVwe invented various vehicles.
p209
aVActually the critical point was in 1989,
p210
aVwhen we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle \u2014
p211
aVhow completely stable it was in all circumstances,
p212
aVwhich is of course very critical.
p213
aVStill not a practical vehicle during all of this,
p214
aVbut moving in the right direction, we believe.
p215
aVFinally, in the early part of \u2014
p216
aVor actually the middle of 2002,
p217
aVwe flew the 400 \u2014 M400, which was the four-passenger vehicle.
p218
aVIn this case here, we're flying it remotely, as we always did at the beginning.
p219
aVAnd we had very small power plants in it at this time.
p220
aVWe are now installing larger powerplants,
p221
aVwhich will make it possible for me to get back on board.
p222
aa(lp223
VA vertical-takeoff aircraft
p224
aVis not the safest vehicle during the test flight program.
p225
aVThere's an old adage that applied for the years
p226
aVbetween 1950s and 1970s,
p227
aVwhen every aeronautical company
p228
aVwas working on vertical-takeoff aircraft.
p229
aVA vertical-takeoff aircraft
p230
aVneeds an artificial stabilization system \u2014
p231
aVthat's essential.
p232
aVAt least for the hover,
p233
aVand the low-speed flight.
p234
aVIf that single-stability system,
p235
aVthat brain that flies that aircraft, fails, or if the engine fails,
p236
aVthat vehicle crashes. There is no option to that.
p237
aVAnd the adage that I'm referring to,
p238
aVthat applied at that time,
p239
aVwas that nothing comes down faster
p240
aVthan a VTOL aircraft upside down.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VThat's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots.
p245
aVIn fact, the aircraft companies gave up on
p246
aVvertical-takeoff aircraft
p247
aVmore or less for a number of years.
p248
aVAnd there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today
p249
aVthat's a vertical-takeoff aircraft \u2014 as distinct from a helicopter \u2014
p250
aVand that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet.
p251
aVA vertical-takeoff aircraft,
p252
aVlike the hummingbird,
p253
aVhas a very high metabolism,
p254
aVwhich means it requires a lot of energy.
p255
aVGetting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down
p256
aVto that power plant \u2014 how to get a large amount of power in a small package.
p257
aa(lp258
VFortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel
p259
aVinvented the rotary engine.
p260
aVA very unique engine \u2014 it's round,
p261
aVit's small, it's vibration-free.
p262
aVIt fits exactly where we need to fit it,
p263
aVright in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system \u2014
p264
aVvery critical. In fact that engine \u2014
p265
aVfor those who are into the automobile \u2014
p266
aVknow that it recently is applied to the RX8 \u2014
p267
aVthe Mazda.
p268
aVAnd that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year.
p269
aVWonderful engine.
p270
aVIn that application, it generates one horsepower per pound,
p271
aVwhich is twice as good as your car engine today,
p272
aVbut only half of what we need.
p273
aVMy company has spent 35 years
p274
aVand many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine,
p275
aVwhich was invented in the late '50s, and getting it to the point that we get
p276
aVover two horsepower per pound, reliably, and critical.
p277
aVWe actually get 175 horsepower
p278
aVinto one cubic foot.
p279
aVWe have eight engines in this vehicle.
p280
aVWe have four computers. We have two parachutes.
p281
aa(lp282
VRedundancy is the critical issue here.
p283
aVIf you want to stay alive you've got to have backups.
p284
aVAnd we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine,
p285
aVand continued to hover.
p286
aVThe computers back up each other. There's a voting system \u2014
p287
aVif one computer is not agreeing with the other three,
p288
aVit's kicked out of the system.
p289
aVAnd then you have three \u2014 you still have the triple redundancy.
p290
aVIf one of those fails, you still have a second chance.
p291
aVIf you stick around, then good luck.
p292
aVThere won't be a third chance.
p293
aVThe parachutes are there \u2014 hopefully,
p294
aVmore for psychological than real reasons, but
p295
aVthey will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VI'd like to show you an animation in this next one,
p300
aVwhich is one element
p301
aVof the Skycar's use,
p302
aVbut it's one that demonstrates how it could be used.
p303
aVYou could think of it personally in your own terms,
p304
aVof how you might use it.
p305
aVVideo: Skycar dispatched, launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco.
p306
aVPaul Moller: I believe that personal transportation
p307
aVin something like the Skycar,
p308
aVprobably in another volantor form as well,
p309
aVwill be a significant part of our lives,
p310
aVas Dr. Goldin says, within the next 10 years.
p311
aVAnd it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way.
p312
aVIf you can live 75 miles from San Francisco and get there in 15 minutes,
p313
aVyou're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment,
p314
aVbuy an upscale home on the side of a mountain,
p315
aVbuy a Skycar,
p316
aVwhich I think would be priced at that time perhaps
p317
aVin the area of 100,000 dollars, put money in the bank ...
p318
aVthat's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.
p319
aVBut you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell.
p320
aa(lp321
V(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VDeveloping the Skycar has been a real challenge.
p324
aVObviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people
p325
aVbelieving in what I'm doing \u2014 both financially and in technical help.
p326
aVAnd that has \u2014
p327
aVyou run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing,
p328
aVand a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing.
p329
aVI characterized this emerging technology
p330
aVin an aphorism,
p331
aVas it's described,
p332
aVwhich really talks about what I've experienced,
p333
aVand I'm sure what other people may have experienced
p334
aVin emerging technologies.
p335
aa(lp336
VThere's an interesting poll that came out recently
p337
aVunder NAS \u2014
p338
aVI think it's MSNBC \u2014
p339
aVin which they asked the question,
p340
aV"Are you in the market for a volantor?"
p341
aVTwenty-three percent said, "Yes, as soon as possible."
p342
aVForty-seven percent \u2014 yes, as soon as they could \u2014 price could come down.
p343
aVTwenty-three percent said, "As soon as it's proven safe."
p344
aVOnly seven percent said
p345
aVthat they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar.
p346
aVI'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like,
p347
aVto some extent, it is becoming self-evident.
p348
aVThat we need an alternative to the automobile,
p349
aVat least for those 50-mile trips and more,
p350
aVso that the highways become usable in today's world.
p351
aVThank you.

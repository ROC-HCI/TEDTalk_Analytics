VThere's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.
p5
aVSo let's start talking about that.
p6
aVI wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.
p7
aVThat's what I have behind myself.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VBut of course what we have to remember is this.
p12
aVAnd what you have to think about is,
p13
aVwhen you're dancing in the flames, what's next?
p14
aVSo what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes
p15
aVis I'm going to talk first about the flames \u2014
p16
aVwhere we are in the economy \u2014
p17
aVand then I'm going to take three trends
p18
aVthat have taken place at TED over the last 25 years
p19
aVand that will take place in this conference
p20
aVand I will try and bring them together.
p21
aVAnd I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.
p22
aVThose three trends are
p23
aVthe ability to engineer cells,
p24
aVthe ability to engineer tissues,
p25
aVand robots.
p26
aVAnd somehow it will all make sense.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut anyway, let's start with the economy.
p29
aVThere's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.
p30
aVOne is leverage.
p31
aVAnd the problem with leverage is
p32
aVit makes the U.S. financial system look like this.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.
p37
aVThat means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.
p38
aVA normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,
p39
aVit's an investment bank;
p40
aVit has 15 to 20 times.
p41
aVIt turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.
p42
aVAnd your friendly Citibank had 47 times.
p43
aVOops.
p44
aVThat means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.
p45
aVAnd that, of course, is the reason why all of you
p46
aVare making such generous and wonderful donations
p47
aVto these nice folks.
p48
aVAnd as you think about that,
p49
aVyou've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aVIt ain't pretty.
p52
aa(lp53
VThe government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.
p54
aVWe all love Santa Claus, right?
p55
aVBut the problem with Santa Clause is,
p56
aVif you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing
p57
aVand promising folks,
p58
aVit turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending
p59
aVon what we call "entitlements."
p60
aVAnd then by 2007 it was 68 percent.
p61
aVAnd we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.
p62
aVExcept we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,
p63
aVthat we've brought that date of reckoning forward
p64
aVto about 2017.
p65
aVAnd we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,
p66
aVbut, guess what?
p67
aVWe're going to start to pay them.
p68
aVAnd the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,
p69
aVit turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.
p70
aVRight?
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VHere's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.
p75
aVThis guy runs the China Investment Corporation.
p76
aVHe is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.
p77
aVAnd he gave an interview in December.
p78
aVHere's his first bit of advice.
p79
aVAnd here's his second bit of advice.
p80
aVAnd, by the way,
p81
aVthe Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.
p82
aVThis stuff is getting serious enough
p83
aVthat if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,
p84
aVwe're going to end up losing the dollar.
p85
aVAnd then all bets are off.
p86
aa(lp87
VLet me show you what it looks like.
p88
aVI think I can safely say
p89
aVthat I'm the only trillionaire in this room.
p90
aVThis is an actual bill.
p91
aVAnd it's 10 triliion dollars.
p92
aVThe only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.
p93
aVThat was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,
p94
aVa buck next week.
p95
aVAnd that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.
p96
aVSo the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,
p97
aVand sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want \u2014
p98
aVyou've just got to say no.
p99
aVAnd you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement."
p100
aVAnd the reason we have to do that in the short term
p101
aVis because we have just run out of cash.
p102
aa(lp103
VIf you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.
p104
aVThe orange slice is what's discretionary.
p105
aVEverything else is mandated.
p106
aVIt makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.
p107
aVSo what we have to start thinking about doing
p108
aVis capping our medical spending
p109
aVbecause that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.
p110
aVWe've got to start thinking about asking people
p111
aVto retire a little bit later.
p112
aVIf you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.
p113
aVYour 401(k) just got nailed.
p114
aVIf you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.
p115
aVIf you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.
p116
aVThe reason why that's reasonable is,
p117
aVwhen your grandparents were given Social Security,
p118
aVthey got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.
p119
aVSixty-eight is young today.
p120
aVWe've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.
p121
aa(lp122
VWe've got to limit other mandatory spending.
p123
aVWe've got to quit borrowing as much,
p124
aVbecause otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.
p125
aVAnd we've got to end up with a smaller government.
p126
aVAnd if we don't start changing this trend line,
p127
aVwe are going to lose the dollar
p128
aVand start to look like Iceland.
p129
aVI got what you're thinking.
p130
aVThis is going to happen when hell freezes over.
p131
aVBut let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VHere's what happens if you don't address this stuff.
p136
aVSo, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis
p137
aVback in the late '80s.
p138
aVAnd its 225 largest companies today
p139
aVare worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.
p140
aVWe don't fix this now,
p141
aVhow would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?
p142
aVBecause that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.
p143
aVAnd unless you want this person
p144
aVto not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,
p145
aVwe'd better deal with this stuff.
p146
aVThat's the short term. That's the flame part.
p147
aVThat's the financial crisis.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave
p150
aVthat we need to talk about.
p151
aVThat wave is much larger, much more powerful,
p152
aVand that's of course the wave of technology.
p153
aVAnd what's really important in this stuff is,
p154
aVas we cut, we also have to grow.
p155
aVAmong other things, because startup companies
p156
aVare .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm
p157
aVand they're about 17.8 percent of output.
p158
aVIt's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.
p159
aVAnd that's what we've got to keep growing.
p160
aVWe don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.
p161
aVSo let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.
p162
aVAnd that's where these three trends come together.
p163
aVThat's where the ability to engineer microbes,
p164
aVthe ability to engineer tissues,
p165
aVand the ability to engineer robots
p166
aVbegin to lead to a reboot.
p167
aVAnd let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.
p168
aa(lp169
VCraig Venter showed up last year
p170
aVand showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware
p171
aVwhere you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.
p172
aVIn parallel, the folks at MIT
p173
aVhave been building a standard registry of biological parts.
p174
aVSo think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.
p175
aVYou can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.
p176
aVAnd start building stuff.
p177
aVIn 2006 they brought together high school students and college students
p178
aVand started to build these little odd creatures.
p179
aVThey just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.
p180
aa(lp181
VHere was one of the first things they built.
p182
aVSo, cells have this cycle.
p183
aVFirst they don't grow.
p184
aVThen they grow exponentially.
p185
aVThen they stop growing.
p186
aVGraduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.
p187
aVSo they engineered these cells
p188
aVso that when they're growing in the exponential phase,
p189
aVthey would smell like wintergreen.
p190
aVAnd when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.
p191
aVAnd you could tell very easily when your experiment was working
p192
aVand wasn't, and where it was in the phase.
p193
aa(lp194
VThis got a bit more complicated two years later.
p195
aVTwenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.
p196
aVThey started competing.
p197
aVThe team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine
p198
aVthat makes red wine good for you
p199
aVinto beer.
p200
aVSo you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.
p201
aVOf course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,
p202
aV"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VThe team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.
p207
aVThey tried to engineer bacterias in such a way
p208
aVthat they would act as your kidneys.
p209
aVFour years ago, I showed you this picture.
p210
aVAnd people oohed and ahhed,
p211
aVbecause Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.
p212
aVAnd that was very cool stuff back then.
p213
aVBut now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,
p214
aVlet me show you what's happened in that period of time.
p215
aa(lp216
VTwo years ago, you saw this creature.
p217
aVAn almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico
p218
aVcalled an axolotl
p219
aVthat can re-generate its limbs.
p220
aVYou can freeze half its heart. It regrows.
p221
aVYou can freeze half the brain. It regrows.
p222
aVIt's almost like leaving Congress.
p223
aV(Laughter)
p224
aVBut now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,
p225
aVbecause you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.
p226
aVAnd, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,
p227
aVyou can grow human molars in Petri dishes.
p228
aVThis should not surprise you, right?
p229
aVI mean, you're born with no teeth.
p230
aVYou give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.
p231
aVYou re-grow a set of teeth.
p232
aVBut then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,
p233
aVunless, if you're a lawyer.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VBut, of course, for most of us,
p238
aVwe know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,
p239
aVput them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,
p240
aVand simply implant it.
p241
aVAnd we can do it with other things.
p242
aVSo, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,
p243
aVthey took all the cells off the trachea,
p244
aVthey spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.
p245
aVShe regrew her own trachea,
p246
aVand 72 hours later it was implanted.
p247
aVShe's now running around with her kids.
p248
aVThis is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest
p249
aVwhere he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,
p250
aVand he's also re-growing bladders.
p251
aVSo there are now nine women walking around Boston
p252
aVwith re-grown bladders,
p253
aVwhich is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags
p254
aVfor the rest of your life.
p255
aa(lp256
VThis is kind of getting boring, right?
p257
aVI mean, you understand where this story's going.
p258
aVBut, I mean it gets more interesting.
p259
aVLast year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,
p260
aVleaving just the cartilage.
p261
aVThen, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.
p262
aVThose stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.
p263
aVLife happens.
p264
aa(lp265
VThis may be one of the ultimate papers.
p266
aVThis was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,
p267
aVand it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.
p268
aVThat meant that you can take the stuff right here,
p269
aVand turn it into almost anything in your body.
p270
aVAnd this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,
p271
aVit's moving in a whole series of places.
p272
aa(lp273
VThird trend: robots.
p274
aVThose of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now
p275
aVwe would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.
p276
aVAnd all we've got is a Roomba.
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aVWe also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.
p279
aVDidn't happen.
p280
aVAnd these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?
p281
aVSo, Rosie runs around on skates
p282
aVand the other one ran on flat threads.
p283
aVIf you don't have a flat world, that's not good,
p284
aVwhich is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different.
p285
aa(lp286
VThis is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog."
p287
aVAnd this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.
p288
aVO.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall,
p289
aVyou're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,
p290
aVand when you don't know if that thing is human or animal \u2014
p291
aVthat's when computers have reached human intelligence.
p292
aVThis is not an intelligence Turing rest,
p293
aVbut this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.
p294
aVAnd this stuff is moving very quickly,
p295
aVand by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.
p296
aVThese are not the only interesting robots.
p297
aVYou've also got flies, the size of flies,
p298
aVthat are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.
p299
aVYou've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.
p300
aVAnd as you bring these things together,
p301
aVas you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,
p302
aVyou begin to get some really odd questions.
p303
aa(lp304
VIn the last Olympics, this gentleman,
p305
aVwho had several world records in the Special Olympics,
p306
aVtried to run in the normal Olympics.
p307
aVThe only issue with Oscar Pistorius
p308
aVis he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.
p309
aVHe came within about a second of qualifying.
p310
aVHe sued to be allowed to run,
p311
aVand he won the suit,
p312
aVbut didn't qualify by time.
p313
aVNext Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,
p314
aVis going to make the time.
p315
aVAnd two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable.
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means
p318
aVto take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear \u2014
p319
aVI mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?
p320
aVI mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,
p321
aVand then your parents had these odd boxes
p322
aVthat would squawk at odd times during dinner,
p323
aVand now we have these little buds that nobody sees.
p324
aVAnd now you have cochlear implants
p325
aVthat go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.
p326
aVNow, they can't hear as well as you and I can.
p327
aVBut, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,
p328
aVand these are machine generations, not human generations.
p329
aVAnd about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,
p330
aVthey'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,
p331
aVor how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.
p332
aVThey'll be able to focus their hearing,
p333
aVthey'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,
p334
aVdo a series of things that we can't do.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd the same thing is happening in eyes.
p337
aVThis is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes
p338
aVso that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.
p339
aVVery primitive.
p340
aVAnd then they'll be able to see shape.
p341
aVAnd then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,
p342
aVand one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.
p343
aVAnd a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,
p344
aVthey'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,
p345
aVthey'll be able to come into a microfocus.
p346
aVThey'll do stuff you and I can't do.
p347
aVAll of these things are coming together,
p348
aVand it's a particularly important thing to understand,
p349
aVas we worry about the flames of the present,
p350
aVto keep an eye on the future.
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,
p353
aVbecause next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.
p354
aVAnd it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."
p355
aVAnd Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.
p356
aVIt is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.
p357
aVThere have actually been 22 species of hominids
p358
aVthat have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,
p359
aVhave gone extinct.
p360
aVIt is common for hominids to evolve.
p361
aVAnd that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,
p362
aVerectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,
p363
aVand Homo sapiens, all overlap.
p364
aVThe common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,
p365
aVnot one.
p366
aa(lp367
VAnd as you think of the implications of that,
p368
aVhere's a brief history of the universe.
p369
aVThe universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,
p370
aVand then you created all the stars, and all the planets,
p371
aVand all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.
p372
aVAnd then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,
p373
aVand then you got life about four billion years ago,
p374
aVand then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,
p375
aVand then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.
p376
aVTa-dah!
p377
aVMaybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,
p378
aVand all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,
p379
aVand all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff
p380
aVis to create what's in this room.
p381
aVMaybe not.
p382
aVThat would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.
p383
aV(Laughter)
p384
aVSo, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?
p385
aV(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
VI think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.
p388
aVI think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.
p389
aVAnd I think this isn't 1,000 years out.
p390
aVI think most of us are going to glance at it,
p391
aVand our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.
p392
aVAnd a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends
p393
aVinto a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control
p394
aVover the evolution of his species, her species and other species.
p395
aVAnd that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.
p396
aa(lp397
VThank you very much.

And I noted that even though those of us of a certain age had the sense not to expect R2D2 in the near future, what we saw was primitive and underwhelming, so we underestimated robots. Since then, Google has bought Boston Dynamics and several other robotics companies. These acquisitions, plus Amazon\\u2019s purchase of Kiva, make robot-human interactions even more important for short-term commercial advantage. Eventually, as we seriously consider colonizing other planets, these types of machines and capabilities will be essential building blocks."}, {"is_pdf": false, "headline": "The Fast Life of Oscar Pistorius", "link_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/magazine/oscar-pistorius.html", "eyebrow": null, "label": "READ_Article", "note": "Michael Sokolove \\r\\n*The New York Times Magazine,* January 18, 2012", "position": null, "blurb": "This article tracks the fascinating tale of the Paralympian athlete and reminds us that enhanced physicality does not always mean enhanced ethics, judgment and brains.

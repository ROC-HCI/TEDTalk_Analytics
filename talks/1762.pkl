VWell, Arthur C. Clarke,
p5
aVa famous science fiction writer from the 1950s,
p6
aVsaid that, "We overestimate technology in the short term,
p7
aVand we underestimate it in the long term."
p8
aVAnd I think that's some of the fear that we see
p9
aVabout jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots.
p10
aVThat we're overestimating the technology in the short term.
p11
aVBut I am worried whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term.
p12
aVBecause the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing
p13
aVand that we, our society, is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future.
p14
aVSo I'm scared we won't have enough robots.
p15
aVBut fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time.
p16
aVBack in 1957, there was a Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn movie.
p17
aVSo you know how it ended up,
p18
aVSpencer Tracy brought a computer, a mainframe computer of 1957, in
p19
aVto help the librarians.
p20
aVThe librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives,
p21
aV"What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"
p22
aVAnd they would look that up.
p23
aVAnd this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job.
p24
aVWell of course a mainframe computer in 1957 wasn't much use for that job.
p25
aVThe librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear.
p26
aVBut that's not what happened in fact.
p27
aVThe number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after 1957.
p28
aVIt wasn't until the Internet came into play,
p29
aVthe web came into play and search engines came into play
p30
aVthat the need for librarians went down.
p31
aVAnd I think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated
p32
aVthe level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today.
p33
aVAnd we can just ask: "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?" and be told instantly \u2014
p34
aVor anything else we want to ask.
p35
aVBy the way, the wages for librarians went up faster
p36
aVthan the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period,
p37
aVbecause librarians became partners of computers.
p38
aVComputers became tools, and they got more tools that they could use
p39
aVand become more effective during that time.
p40
aVSame thing happened in offices.
p41
aVBack in the old days, people used spreadsheets.
p42
aVSpreadsheets were spread sheets of paper,
p43
aVand they calculated by hand.
p44
aVBut here was an interesting thing that came along.
p45
aVWith the revolution around 1980 of P.C.'s,
p46
aVthe spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers,
p47
aVnot to replace office workers,
p48
aVbut it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers.
p49
aVSo office workers became programmers of spreadsheets.
p50
aVIt increased their capabilities.
p51
aVThey no longer had to do the mundane computations,
p52
aVbut they could do something much more.
p53
aVNow today, we're starting to see robots in our lives.
p54
aVOn the left there is the PackBot from iRobot.
p55
aVWhen soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan,
p56
aVinstead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick,
p57
aVas they used to do up until about 2002,
p58
aVthey now send the robot out.
p59
aVSo the robot takes over the dangerous jobs.
p60
aVOn the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh.
p61
aVThese are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.
p62
aVAnd they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry.
p63
aVThey take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen.
p64
aVThey bring the medicines up from the pharmacy.
p65
aVAnd it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides
p66
aVfrom doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around
p67
aVto spend more time with patients.
p68
aVIn fact, robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways.
p69
aVBut I think when it comes to factory robots, people are sort of afraid,
p70
aVbecause factory robots are dangerous to be around.
p71
aVIn order to program them, you have to understand six-dimensional vectors and quaternions.
p72
aVAnd ordinary people can't interact with them.
p73
aVAnd I think it's the sort of technology that's gone wrong.
p74
aVIt's displaced the worker from the technology.
p75
aVAnd I think we really have to look at technologies
p76
aVthat ordinary workers can interact with.
p77
aVAnd so I want to tell you today about Baxter, which we've been talking about.
p78
aVAnd Baxter, I see, as a way \u2014 a first wave of robot
p79
aVthat ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting.
p80
aVSo Baxter is up here.
p81
aVThis is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics.
p82
aVWe've got a conveyor there.
p83
aVAnd if the lighting isn't too extreme \u2014
p84
aVAh, ah! There it is. It's picked up the object off the conveyor.
p85
aVIt's going to come bring it over here and put it down.
p86
aVAnd then it'll go back, reach for another object.
p87
aVThe interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense.
p88
aVBy the way, what's going on with the eyes?
p89
aVThe eyes are on the screen there.
p90
aVThe eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move.
p91
aVSo a person that's interacting with the robot
p92
aVunderstands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions.
p93
aVHere Chris took the object out of its hand,
p94
aVand Baxter didn't go and try to put it down;
p95
aVit went back and realized it had to get another one.
p96
aVIt's got a little bit of basic common sense, goes and picks the objects.
p97
aVAnd Baxter's safe to interact with.
p98
aVYou wouldn't want to do this with a current industrial robot.
p99
aVBut with Baxter it doesn't hurt.
p100
aVIt feels the force, understands that Chris is there
p101
aVand doesn't push through him and hurt him.
p102
aVBut I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface.
p103
aVAnd so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now.
p104
aVAnd when he grabs an arm, it goes into zero-force gravity-compensated mode
p105
aVand graphics come up on the screen.
p106
aVYou can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm.
p107
aVHe's going to put something in its hand, he's going to bring it over here,
p108
aVpress a button and let go of that thing in the hand.
p109
aVAnd the robot figures out, ah, he must mean I want to put stuff down.
p110
aVIt puts a little icon there.
p111
aVHe comes over here, and he gets the fingers to grasp together,
p112
aVand the robot infers, ah, you want an object for me to pick up.
p113
aVThat puts the green icon there.
p114
aVHe's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from.
p115
aVIt just moves it around, and the robot figures out that was an area search.
p116
aVHe didn't have to select that from a menu.
p117
aVAnd now he's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object
p118
aVwhile we continue talking.
p119
aVSo as we continue here,
p120
aVI want to tell you about what this is like in factories.
p121
aVThese robots we're shipping every day.
p122
aVThey go to factories around the country.
p123
aVThis is Mildred.
p124
aVMildred's a factory worker in Connecticut.
p125
aVShe's worked on the line for over 20 years.
p126
aVOne hour after she saw her first industrial robot,
p127
aVshe had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory.
p128
aVShe decided she really liked robots.
p129
aVAnd it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand.
p130
aVNow she's got the robot doing it.
p131
aVWhen we first went out to talk to people in factories
p132
aVabout how we could get robots to interact with them better,
p133
aVone of the questions we asked them was,
p134
aV"Do you want your children to work in a factory?"
p135
aVThe universal answer was "No, I want a better job than that for my children."
p136
aVAnd as a result of that, Mildred is very typical
p137
aVof today's factory workers in the U.S.
p138
aVThey're older, and they're getting older and older.
p139
aVThere aren't many young people coming into factory work.
p140
aVAnd as their tasks become more onerous on them,
p141
aVwe need to give them tools that they can collaborate with,
p142
aVso that they can be part of the solution,
p143
aVso that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S.
p144
aVAnd so our vision is that Mildred who's the line worker
p145
aVbecomes Mildred the robot trainer.
p146
aVShe lifts her game,
p147
aVlike the office workers of the 1980s lifted their game of what they could do.
p148
aVWe're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use.
p149
aVThey're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes.
p150
aVThere's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable.
p151
aVThat's climate change and demographics.
p152
aVDemographics is really going to change our world.
p153
aVThis is the percentage of adults who are working age.
p154
aVAnd it's gone down slightly over the last 40 years.
p155
aVBut over the next 40 years, it's going to change dramatically, even in China.
p156
aVThe percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically.
p157
aVAnd turned up the other way, the people who are retirement age goes up very, very fast,
p158
aVas the baby boomers get to retirement age.
p159
aVThat means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars
p160
aVcompeting for services.
p161
aVBut more than that, as we get older we get more frail
p162
aVand we can't do all the tasks we used to do.
p163
aVIf we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers,
p164
aVbefore our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older.
p165
aVThat's happening statistically right now.
p166
aVAnd as the number of people who are older, above retirement age and getting older, as they increase,
p167
aVthere will be less people to take care of them.
p168
aVAnd I think we're really going to have to have robots to help us.
p169
aVAnd I don't mean robots in terms of companions.
p170
aVI mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves
p171
aVbut get harder as we get older.
p172
aVGetting the groceries in from the car, up the stairs, into the kitchen.
p173
aVOr even, as we get very much older,
p174
aVdriving our cars to go visit people.
p175
aVAnd I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older
p176
aVby having control of the robotic solution.
p177
aVSo they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them.
p178
aVAnd so I really think that we're going to be spending more time
p179
aVwith robots like Baxter
p180
aVand working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives. And that we will \u2014
p181
aVHere, Baxter, it's good.
p182
aVAnd that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years
p183
aVas part of our everyday lives.
p184
aVThanks very much.
p185
aV(Applause)

Brooks studies and engineers robot intelligence, looking for the holy grail of robotics: the AGI, or artificial general intelligence. For decades, we&#39;ve been building robots to do highly specific tasks -- welding, riveting, delivering interoffice mail -- but what we all want, really, is a robot that can figure things out on its own, the way we humans do.</p><p>Brooks realized that a top-down approach -- just building the biggest brain possible and teaching it everything we could think of -- would never work. What <em>would</em> work is a robot who learns like we do, by trial and error, and with many separate parts that learn separate jobs. The thesis of his work which was captured in&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/fastcheap/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Fast, Cheap and Out of Control</a>,</em>went on to become the title of the great Errol Morris documentary.</p><p>A founder of <a href=\\"http://www.irobot.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">iRobot</a>, makers of the Roomba vacuum, Brooks is now founder and CTO of&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://rethinkrobotics.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span>Rethink Robotics</span></a>, whose mission is to apply advanced robotic intelligence to manufacturing and physical labor.

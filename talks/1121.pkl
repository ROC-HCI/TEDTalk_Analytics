VRoger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice.
p5
aVThis is Alex, the best computer voice
p6
aVI've been able to find,
p7
aVwhich comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh.
p8
aVFor most of my life,
p9
aVI never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.
p10
aVIt was like breathing.
p11
aVIn those days, I was living in a fool's paradise.
p12
aVAfter surgeries for cancer
p13
aVtook away my ability to speak, eat or drink,
p14
aVI was forced to enter this virtual world
p15
aVin which a computer does some of my living for me.
p16
aa(lp17
VFor several days now,
p18
aVwe have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.
p19
aVI used to be able to talk like that.
p20
aVMaybe I wasn't as smart,
p21
aVbut I was at least as talkative.
p22
aVI want to devote my talk today
p23
aVto the act of speaking itself,
p24
aVand how the act of speaking or not speaking
p25
aVis tied so indelibly to one's identity
p26
aVas to force the birth of a new person
p27
aVwhen it is taken away.
p28
aVHowever, I've found that listening to a computer voice
p29
aVfor any great length of time
p30
aVcan be monotonous.
p31
aVSo I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends
p32
aVto read my words aloud for me.
p33
aVI will start with my wife, Chaz.
p34
aa(lp35
VChaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side
p36
aVthrough three attempts to reconstruct my jaw
p37
aVand restore my ability to speak.
p38
aVGoing into the first surgery
p39
aVfor a recurrence of salivary cancer
p40
aVin 2006,
p41
aVI expected to be out of the hospital
p42
aVin time to return to my movie review show,
p43
aV'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.'
p44
aVI had pre-taped enough shows
p45
aVto get me through six weeks of surgery
p46
aVand recuperation.
p47
aVThe doctors took a fibula bone from my leg
p48
aVand some tissue from my shoulder
p49
aVto fashion into a new jaw.
p50
aVMy tongue, larynx and vocal cords
p51
aVwere still healthy and unaffected.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VCE: I was optimistic,
p58
aVand all was right with the world.
p59
aVThe first surgery was a great success.
p60
aVI saw myself in the mirror
p61
aVand I looked pretty good.
p62
aVTwo weeks later, I was ready to return home.
p63
aVI was using my iPod
p64
aVto play the Leonard Cohen song
p65
aV'I'm Your Man'
p66
aVfor my doctors and nurses.
p67
aVSuddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding.
p68
aVMy carotid artery had ruptured.
p69
aVThank God I was still in my hospital room
p70
aVand my doctors were right there.
p71
aVChaz told me
p72
aVthat if that song hadn't played for so long,
p73
aVI might have already been in the car, on the way home,
p74
aVand would have died right there and then.
p75
aVSo thank you, Leonard Cohen,
p76
aVfor saving my life.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Applause)
p79
aa(lp80
VThere was a second surgery \u2014
p81
aVwhich held up for five or six days
p82
aVand then it also fell apart.
p83
aVAnd then a third attempt,
p84
aVwhich also patched me back together pretty well,
p85
aVuntil it failed.
p86
aVA doctor from Brazil said
p87
aVhe had never seen anyone survive
p88
aVa carotid artery rupture.
p89
aVAnd before I left the hospital,
p90
aVafter a year of being hospitalized,
p91
aVI had seven ruptures
p92
aVof my carotid artery.
p93
aa(lp94
VThere was no particular day
p95
aVwhen anyone told me
p96
aVI would never speak again;
p97
aVit just sort of became obvious.
p98
aVHuman speech
p99
aVis an ingenious manipulation of our breath
p100
aVwithin the sound chamber of our mouth
p101
aVand respiratory system.
p102
aVWe need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath
p103
aVin order to form sounds.
p104
aVTherefore, the system
p105
aVmust be essentially airtight
p106
aVin order to capture air.
p107
aVBecause I had lost my jaw,
p108
aVI could no longer form a seal,
p109
aVand therefore my tongue
p110
aVand all of my other vocal equipment
p111
aVwas rendered powerless.
p112
aa(lp113
VDean Ornish: At first for a long time,
p114
aVI wrote messages in notebooks.
p115
aVThen I tried typing words on my laptop
p116
aVand using its built in voice.
p117
aVThis was faster,
p118
aVand nobody had to try to read my handwriting.
p119
aVI tried out various computer voices that were available online,
p120
aVand for several months I had a British accent,
p121
aVwhich Chaz called Sir Lawrence."
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aV"It was the clearest I could find.
p124
aVThen Apple released the Alex voice,
p125
aVwhich was the best I'd heard.
p126
aVIt knew things like the difference
p127
aVbetween an exclamation point and a question mark.
p128
aVWhen it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence
p129
aVsound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.
p130
aVThere are all sorts of html codes you can use
p131
aVto control the timing and inflection of computer voices,
p132
aVand I've experimented with them.
p133
aVFor me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow.
p134
aVWhen I find myself in a conversational situation,
p135
aVI need to type fast and to jump right in.
p136
aVPeople don't have the time or the patience
p137
aVto wait for me to fool around with the codes
p138
aVfor every word or phrase.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?
p141
aVHow does that affect who you are as a person?
p142
aVWhen people hear Alex speaking my words,
p143
aVdo they experience a disconnect?
p144
aVDoes that create a separation or a distance
p145
aVfrom one person to the next?
p146
aVHow did I feel not being able to speak?
p147
aVI felt, and I still feel,
p148
aVa lot of distance from the human mainstream.
p149
aVI've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop.
p150
aVEven then, I'm aware that most people have little patience
p151
aVfor my speaking difficulties.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice
p154
aVusing my TV show voice
p155
aVfrom a period of 30 years.
p156
aVAt first I was against it.
p157
aVI thought it would be creepy
p158
aVto hear my own voice coming from a computer.
p159
aVThere was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.
p160
aVBut I decided then to just give it a try.
p161
aVSo we contacted a company in Scotland
p162
aVthat created personalized computer voices.
p163
aVThey'd never made one from previously-recorded materials.
p164
aVAll of their voices had been made by a speaker
p165
aVrecording original words in a control booth.
p166
aVBut they were willing to give it a try.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice,
p169
aVincluding several audio commentary tracks
p170
aVthat I'd made for movies on DVDs.
p171
aVAnd it sounded like me, it really did.
p172
aVThere was a reason for that; it was me.
p173
aVBut it wasn't that simple.
p174
aVThe tapes from my TV show weren't very useful
p175
aVbecause there were too many other kinds of audio involved \u2014
p176
aVmovie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me \u2014
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aVand my words often had a particular emphasis
p179
aVthat didn't fit into a sentence well enough.
p180
aa(lp181
VI'll let you hear a sample of that voice.
p182
aVThese are a few of the comments I recorded for use
p183
aVwhen Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program.
p184
aVAnd here's the voice we call Roger Jr.
p185
aVor Roger 2.0.
p186
aa(lp187
VRoger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is
p188
aVto be back on your show.
p189
aVWe have been talking for a long time,
p190
aVand now here we are again.
p191
aVThis is the first version of my computer voice.
p192
aVIt still needs improvement,
p193
aVbut at least it sounds like me
p194
aVand not like HAL 9000.
p195
aVWhen I heard it the first time,
p196
aVit sent chills down my spine.
p197
aVWhen I type anything,
p198
aVthis voice will speak whatever I type.
p199
aVWhen I read something, it will read in my voice.
p200
aVI have typed these words in advance,
p201
aVas I didn't think it would be thrilling
p202
aVto sit here watching me typing.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe voice was created by a company in Scotland
p205
aVnamed CereProc.
p206
aVIt makes me feel good
p207
aVthat many of the words you are hearing were first spoken
p208
aVwhile I was commenting on "Casablanca"
p209
aVand "Citizen Kane."
p210
aVThis is the first voice they've created for an individual.
p211
aVThere are several very good voices available for computers,
p212
aVbut they all sound like somebody else,
p213
aVwhile this voice sounds like me.
p214
aVI plan to use it on television, radio
p215
aVand the Internet.
p216
aVPeople who need a voice should know
p217
aVthat most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.
p218
aVMany blind people use them
p219
aVto read pages on the Web to themselves.
p220
aVBut I've got to say, in first grade,
p221
aVthey said I talked too much,
p222
aVand now I still can.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VRoger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me,
p227
aVbut the words jump up and down.
p228
aVThe flow isn't natural.
p229
aVThe good people in Scotland are still improving my voice,
p230
aVand I'm optimistic about it.
p231
aVBut so far, the Apple Alex voice
p232
aVis the best one I've heard.
p233
aVI wrote a blog about it
p234
aVand actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex.
p235
aVHe said he recorded many long hours in various intonations
p236
aVto be used in the voice.
p237
aVA very large sample is needed.
p238
aa(lp239
VJohn Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth.
p240
aVNow I have spoken my last words,
p241
aVand I don't even remember for sure
p242
aVwhat they were.
p243
aVI feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story
p244
aVtitled "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."
p245
aVOn Wednesday, David Christian explained to us
p246
aVwhat a tiny instant the human race represents
p247
aVin the time-span of the universe.
p248
aVFor almost all of its millions and billions of years,
p249
aVthere was no life on Earth at all.
p250
aVFor almost all the years of life on Earth,
p251
aVthere was no intelligent life.
p252
aVOnly after we learned to pass knowledge
p253
aVfrom one generation to the next,
p254
aVdid civilization become possible.
p255
aVIn cosmological terms,
p256
aVthat was about 10 minutes ago.
p257
aVFinally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool,
p258
aVthe computer.
p259
aVThat has mostly happened in my lifetime.
p260
aa(lp261
VSome of the famous early computers
p262
aVwere being built in my hometown of Urbana,
p263
aVthe birthplace of HAL 9000.
p264
aVWhen I heard the amazing talk
p265
aVby Salman Khan on Wednesday,
p266
aVabout the Khan Academy website
p267
aVthat teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world,
p268
aVI had a flashback.
p269
aVIt was about 1960.
p270
aVAs a local newspaper reporter still in high school,
p271
aVI was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois
p272
aVto interview the creators
p273
aVof something called PLATO.
p274
aVThe initials stood for Programmed Logic
p275
aVfor Automated Teaching Operations.
p276
aVThis was a computer-assisted instruction system,
p277
aVwhich in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC.
p278
aVThe programmers said it could assist students in their learning.
p279
aa(lp280
VI doubt, on that day 50 years ago,
p281
aVthey even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished.
p282
aVBut that's not the point.
p283
aVThe point is PLATO was only 50 years ago,
p284
aVan instant in time.
p285
aVIt continued to evolve and operated in one form or another
p286
aVon more and more sophisticated computers,
p287
aVuntil only five years ago.
p288
aVI have learned from Wikipedia
p289
aVthat, starting with that humble beginning,
p290
aVPLATO established forums, message boards,
p291
aVonline testing,
p292
aVemail, chat rooms,
p293
aVpicture languages, instant messaging,
p294
aVremote screen sharing
p295
aVand multiple-player games.
p296
aa(lp297
VSince the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana,
p298
aVit appears that my hometown
p299
aVin downstate Illinois
p300
aVwas the birthplace
p301
aVof much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today.
p302
aVBut I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce.
p303
aV(Laughter)
p304
aVI'm here as a man who wants to communicate.
p305
aa(lp306
VAll of this has happened in my lifetime.
p307
aVI started writing on a computer back in the 1970s
p308
aVwhen one of the first Atech systems was installed
p309
aVat the Chicago Sun-Times.
p310
aVI was in line at Radio Shack
p311
aVto buy one of the first Model 100's.
p312
aVAnd when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards
p313
aVthat they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections,
p314
aVthey didn't know what I was talking about.
p315
aVWhen I bought my first desktop,
p316
aVit was a DEC Rainbow.
p317
aVDoes anybody remember that?"
p318
aV(Applause)
p319
aV"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival
p320
aVwith a portable computer the size of a suitcase
p321
aVnamed the Porteram Telebubble.
p322
aVI joined CompuServe
p323
aVwhen it had fewer numbers
p324
aVthan I currently have followers on Twitter.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
VCE: All of this has happened
p329
aVin the blink of an eye.
p330
aVIt is unimaginable
p331
aVwhat will happen next.
p332
aVIt makes me incredibly fortunate
p333
aVto live at this moment in history.
p334
aVIndeed, I am lucky to live in history at all,
p335
aVbecause without intelligence and memory
p336
aVthere is no history.
p337
aVFor billions of years,
p338
aVthe universe evolved
p339
aVcompletely without notice.
p340
aVNow we live in the age of the Internet,
p341
aVwhich seems to be creating a form of global consciousness.
p342
aVAnd because of it,
p343
aVI can communicate
p344
aVas well as I ever could.
p345
aVWe are born into a box
p346
aVof time and space.
p347
aVWe use words and communication
p348
aVto break out of it
p349
aVand to reach out to others.
p350
aa(lp351
VFor me, the Internet began
p352
aVas a useful tool
p353
aVand now has become something I rely on
p354
aVfor my actual daily existence.
p355
aVI cannot speak;
p356
aVI can only type so fast.
p357
aVComputer voices
p358
aVare sometimes not very sophisticated,
p359
aVbut with my computer,
p360
aVI can communicate more widely
p361
aVthan ever before.
p362
aVI feel as if my blog,
p363
aVmy email, Twitter and Facebook
p364
aVhave given me a substitute
p365
aVfor everyday conversation.
p366
aVThey aren't an improvement,
p367
aVbut they're the best I can do.
p368
aVThey give me a way to speak.
p369
aVNot everybody has the patience
p370
aVof my wife, Chaz.
p371
aVBut online,
p372
aVeverybody speaks at the same speed.
p373
aa(lp374
VThis whole adventure
p375
aVhas been a learning experience.
p376
aVEvery time there was a surgery that failed,
p377
aVI was left with a little less flesh and bone.
p378
aVNow I have no jaw left at all.
p379
aVWhile harvesting tissue from both my shoulders,
p380
aVthe surgeries left me with back pain
p381
aVand reduced my ability to walk easily.
p382
aVIronic that my legs are fine,
p383
aVand it's my shoulders that slow up my walk.
p384
aVWhen you see me today,
p385
aVI look like the Phantom of the Opera.
p386
aa(lp387
VBut no you don't.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter)
p390
aa(lp391
V(Applause)
p392
aa(lp393
VIt is human nature to look at someone like me
p394
aVand assume I have lost some of my marbles.
p395
aVPeople \u2014
p396
aV(Applause)
p397
aVPeople talk loudly \u2014
p398
aa(lp399
VI'm so sorry.
p400
aVExcuse me.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Applause)
p403
aa(lp404
VPeople talk loudly and slowly to me.
p405
aVSometimes they assume I am deaf.
p406
aVThere are people who don't want to make eye contact.
p407
aa(lp408
VBelieve me, he didn't mean this as \u2014
p409
aVanyway, let me just read it.
p410
aV(Laughter)
p411
aVYou should never let your wife read something like this.
p412
aa(lp413
V(Laughter)
p414
aa(lp415
VIt is human nature
p416
aVto look away from illness.
p417
aVWe don't enjoy a reminder
p418
aVof our own fragile mortality.
p419
aVThat's why writing on the Internet
p420
aVhas become a lifesaver for me.
p421
aVMy ability to think and write
p422
aVhave not been affected.
p423
aVAnd on the Web, my real voice finds expression.
p424
aVI have also met many other disabled people
p425
aVwho communicate this way.
p426
aVOne of my Twitter friends
p427
aVcan type only with his toes.
p428
aVOne of the funniest blogs on the Web
p429
aVis written by a friend of mine
p430
aVnamed Smartass Cripple.
p431
aV(Laughter)
p432
aVGoogle him and he will make you laugh.
p433
aVAll of these people are saying, in one way or another,
p434
aVthat what you see
p435
aVis not all you get.
p436
aa(lp437
VSo I have not come here to complain.
p438
aVI have much to make me happy and relieved.
p439
aVI seem, for the time being,
p440
aVto be cancer-free.
p441
aVI am writing as well as ever.
p442
aVI am productive.
p443
aVIf I were in this condition at any point
p444
aVbefore a few cosmological instants ago,
p445
aVI would be as isolated as a hermit.
p446
aVI would be trapped inside my head.
p447
aVBecause of the rush of human knowledge,
p448
aVbecause of the digital revolution,
p449
aVI have a voice,
p450
aVand I do not need to scream.
p451
aa(lp452
VRE: Wait. I have one more thing to add.
p453
aVA guy goes into a psychiatrist.
p454
aVThe psychiatrist says, "You're crazy."
p455
aVThe guy says, "I want a second opinion."
p456
aVThe psychiatrist says, "All right, you're ugly."
p457
aa(lp458
V(Laughter)
p459
aa(lp460
VYou all know the test for artificial intelligence \u2014 the Turing test.
p461
aVA human judge has a conversation
p462
aVwith a human and a computer.
p463
aVIf the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human,
p464
aVthe machine has passed the test.
p465
aVI now propose a test for computer voices \u2014 the Ebert test.
p466
aVIf a computer voice can successfully tell a joke
p467
aVand do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman,
p468
aVthen that's the voice I want.

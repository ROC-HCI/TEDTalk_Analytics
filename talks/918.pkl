VChris Anderson: Julian, welcome.
p5
aVIt's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby,
p6
aVhas, in the last few years
p7
aVhas released more classified documents
p8
aVthan the rest of the world's media combined.
p9
aVCan that possibly be true?
p10
aa(lp11
VJulian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?
p12
aVIt's a worry \u2014 isn't it? \u2014 that the rest of the world's media
p13
aVis doing such a bad job
p14
aVthat a little group of activists
p15
aVis able to release more
p16
aVof that type of information
p17
aVthan the rest of the world press combined.
p18
aa(lp19
VCA: How does it work?
p20
aVHow do people release the documents?
p21
aVAnd how do you secure their privacy?
p22
aa(lp23
VJA: So these are \u2014 as far as we can tell \u2014
p24
aVclassical whistleblowers,
p25
aVand we have a number of ways for them
p26
aVto get information to us.
p27
aVSo we use this state-of-the-art encryption
p28
aVto bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails,
p29
aVpass it through legal jurisdictions
p30
aVlike Sweden and Belgium
p31
aVto enact those legal protections.
p32
aVWe get information in the mail,
p33
aVthe regular postal mail,
p34
aVencrypted or not,
p35
aVvet it like a regular news organization, format it \u2014
p36
aVwhich is sometimes something that's quite hard to do,
p37
aVwhen you're talking about
p38
aVgiant databases of information \u2014
p39
aVrelease it to the public
p40
aVand then defend ourselves
p41
aVagainst the inevitable legal and political attacks.
p42
aa(lp43
VCA: So you make an effort to ensure
p44
aVthe documents are legitimate,
p45
aVbut you actually
p46
aValmost never know who the identity of the source is?
p47
aa(lp48
VJA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know,
p49
aVand if we find out at some stage
p50
aVthen we destroy that information as soon as possible.
p51
aV(Phone ring) God damn it.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VCA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is
p56
aVfor a TED membership.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VSo let's take [an] example, actually.
p61
aVThis is something
p62
aVyou leaked a few years ago.
p63
aVIf we can have this document up ...
p64
aVSo this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.
p65
aVCan you tell us what you leaked and what happened?
p66
aa(lp67
VJA: So this is the Kroll Report.
p68
aVThis was a secret intelligence report
p69
aVcommissioned by the Kenyan government
p70
aVafter its election in 2004.
p71
aVPrior to 2004, Kenya was ruled
p72
aVby Daniel arap Moi
p73
aVfor about 18 years.
p74
aVHe was a soft dictator of Kenya.
p75
aVAnd when Kibaki got into power \u2014
p76
aVthrough a coalition of forces that were trying
p77
aVto clean up corruption in Kenya \u2014
p78
aVthey commissioned this report,
p79
aVspent about two million pounds
p80
aVon this and an associated report.
p81
aVAnd then the government sat on it
p82
aVand used it for political leverage on Moi,
p83
aVwho was the richest man \u2014
p84
aVstill is the richest man \u2014 in Kenya.
p85
aVIt's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.
p86
aVSo I went there in 2007,
p87
aVand we managed to get hold of this
p88
aVjust prior to the election \u2014
p89
aVthe national election, December 28.
p90
aVWhen we released that report,
p91
aVwe did so three days after the new president, Kibaki,
p92
aVhad decided to pal up with
p93
aVthe man that he was going to clean out,
p94
aVDaniel arap Moi,
p95
aVso this report then
p96
aVbecame a dead albatross
p97
aVaround President Kibaki's neck.
p98
aa(lp99
VCA: And \u2014 I mean, to cut a long story short \u2014
p100
aVword of the report leaked into Kenya,
p101
aVnot from the official media, but indirectly,
p102
aVand in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.
p103
aVJA: Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian
p104
aVand was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya,
p105
aVin Tanzanian and South African press.
p106
aVAnd so it came in from the outside.
p107
aVAnd that, after a couple of days,
p108
aVmade the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.
p109
aVAnd it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV,
p110
aVshifted the vote by 10 percent,
p111
aVaccording to a Kenyan intelligence report,
p112
aVwhich changed the result of the election.
p113
aa(lp114
VCA: Wow, so your leak
p115
aVreally substantially changed the world?
p116
aa(lp117
VJA: Yep.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Applause)
p120
aa(lp121
VCA: Here's \u2014 We're going to just show
p122
aVa short clip from this
p123
aVBaghdad airstrike video.
p124
aVThe video itself is longer,
p125
aVbut here's a short clip.
p126
aVThis is \u2014 this is intense material, I should warn you.
p127
aa(lp128
VRadio: ... just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open 'em up.
p129
aVI see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along ...
p130
aVYou're clear. All right. Firing.
p131
aVLet me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.
p132
aVLight 'em all up.
p133
aVC'mon, fire!
p134
aV(Machine gun fire)
p135
aVKeep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n.
p136
aV(Machine gun fire)
p137
aVKeep shoot 'n.
p138
aVHotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,
p139
aVwe need to move, time now!
p140
aVAll right, we just engaged all eight individuals.
p141
aVYeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.
p142
aVRoger. I got 'em.
p143
aVTwo-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.
p144
aVOops, I'm sorry. What was going on?
p145
aVGod damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em.
p146
aa(lp147
VCA: So, what was the impact of that?
p148
aa(lp149
VJA: The impact on the people who worked on it
p150
aVwas severe.
p151
aVWe ended up sending two people to Baghdad
p152
aVto further research that story.
p153
aVSo this is just the first of three attacks
p154
aVthat occurred in that scene.
p155
aa(lp156
VCA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right,
p157
aVincluding two Reuters employees?
p158
aa(lp159
VJA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees,
p160
aVtwo young children were wounded.
p161
aVThere were between 18 and 26 people killed all together.
p162
aa(lp163
VCA: And releasing this caused
p164
aVwidespread outrage.
p165
aVWhat was the key element of this
p166
aVthat actually caused the outrage, do you think?
p167
aa(lp168
VJA: I don't know. I guess people can see
p169
aVthe gross disparity in force.
p170
aVYou have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street,
p171
aVand then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer
p172
aVfiring 30-millimeter cannon shells
p173
aVon everyone \u2014
p174
aVlooking for any excuse to do so \u2014
p175
aVand killing people rescuing the wounded.
p176
aVAnd there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents
p177
aVbecause that's their full-time job.
p178
aa(lp179
VCA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst,
p180
aVBradley Manning, arrested,
p181
aVand it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room
p182
aVto have leaked this video to you,
p183
aValong with 280,000
p184
aVclassified U.S. embassy cables.
p185
aVI mean, did he?
p186
aa(lp187
VJA: We have denied receiving those cables.
p188
aVHe has been charged,
p189
aVabout five days ago,
p190
aVwith obtaining 150,000 cables
p191
aVand releasing 50.
p192
aVNow, we had released,
p193
aVearly in the year,
p194
aVa cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy,
p195
aVbut this is not necessarily connected.
p196
aVI mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.
p197
aa(lp198
VCA: I mean, if you did receive thousands
p199
aVof U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
p200
aa(lp201
VJA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?)
p202
aa(lp203
VJA: Yeah. (CA: Because?)
p204
aa(lp205
VJA: Well, because these sort of things
p206
aVreveal what the true state
p207
aVof, say,
p208
aVArab governments are like,
p209
aVthe true human-rights abuses in those governments.
p210
aVIf you look at declassified cables,
p211
aVthat's the sort of material that's there.
p212
aa(lp213
VCA: So let's talk a little more broadly about this.
p214
aVI mean, in general, what's your philosophy?
p215
aVWhy is it right
p216
aVto encourage leaking of secret information?
p217
aa(lp218
VJA: Well, there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world,
p219
aVwhat sort of information
p220
aVcan achieve reform.
p221
aVAnd there's a lot of information.
p222
aVSo information that organizations
p223
aVare spending economic effort into concealing,
p224
aVthat's a really good signal
p225
aVthat when the information gets out,
p226
aVthere's a hope of it doing some good \u2014
p227
aVbecause the organizations that know it best,
p228
aVthat know it from the inside out,
p229
aVare spending work to conceal it.
p230
aVAnd that's what we've found in practice,
p231
aVand that's what the history of journalism is.
p232
aa(lp233
VCA: But are there risks with that,
p234
aVeither to the individuals concerned
p235
aVor indeed to society at large,
p236
aVwhere leaking can actually have
p237
aVan unintended consequence?
p238
aa(lp239
VJA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released.
p240
aVI mean, we have a harm immunization policy.
p241
aVWe have a way of dealing with information
p242
aVthat has sort of personal \u2014
p243
aVpersonally identifying information in it.
p244
aVBut there are legitimate secrets \u2014
p245
aVyou know, your records with your doctor;
p246
aVthat's a legitimate secret \u2014
p247
aVbut we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward
p248
aVthat are really sort of well-motivated.
p249
aa(lp250
VCA: So they are well-motivated.
p251
aVAnd what would you say to, for example,
p252
aVthe, you know, the parent of someone
p253
aVwhose son is out serving the U.S. military,
p254
aVand he says, "You know what,
p255
aVyou've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out.
p256
aVIt shows a U.S. soldier laughing
p257
aVat people dying.
p258
aVThat gives the impression, has given the impression,
p259
aVto millions of people around the world
p260
aVthat U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.
p261
aVActually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?"
p262
aVWhat would you say to that?
p263
aa(lp264
VJA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.
p265
aVBut remember, the people in Baghdad,
p266
aVthe people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan \u2014
p267
aVthey don't need to see the video;
p268
aVthey see it every day.
p269
aVSo it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.
p270
aVThat's what they see every day.
p271
aVIt will change the perception and opinion
p272
aVof the people who are paying for it all,
p273
aVand that's our hope.
p274
aa(lp275
VCA: So you found a way to shine light
p276
aVinto what you see
p277
aVas these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.
p278
aVLight is good.
p279
aVBut do you see any irony in the fact that,
p280
aVin order for you to shine that light,
p281
aVyou have to, yourself,
p282
aVcreate secrecy around your sources?
p283
aa(lp284
VJA: Not really. I mean, we don't have
p285
aVany WikiLeaks dissidents yet.
p286
aVWe don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.
p287
aVShould they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us,
p288
aVbut we're presumably acting in such a way
p289
aVthat people feel
p290
aVmorally compelled
p291
aVto continue our mission, not to screw it up.
p292
aa(lp293
VCA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far \u2014
p294
aVI'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.
p295
aVYou know, there might be a couple of views
p296
aVof WikiLeaks and of Julian.
p297
aVYou know, hero \u2014 people's hero \u2014
p298
aVbringing this important light.
p299
aVDangerous troublemaker.
p300
aVWho's got the hero view?
p301
aVWho's got the dangerous troublemaker view?
p302
aa(lp303
VJA: Oh, come on. There must be some.
p304
aa(lp305
VCA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd.
p306
aVWe have to try better. Let's show them another example.
p307
aVNow here's something that you haven't yet leaked,
p308
aVbut I think for TED you are.
p309
aVI mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?
p310
aVWhat is this?
p311
aa(lp312
VJA: So this is a sample of what we do
p313
aVsort of every day.
p314
aVSo late last year \u2014 in November last year \u2014
p315
aVthere was a series of well blowouts
p316
aVin Albania,
p317
aVlike the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico,
p318
aVbut not quite as big.
p319
aVAnd we got a report \u2014
p320
aVa sort of engineering analysis into what happened \u2014
p321
aVsaying that, in fact, security guards
p322
aVfrom some rival, various competing oil firms
p323
aVhad, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.
p324
aVAnd part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.
p325
aVAnd the engineering report
p326
aVhad nothing on the top of it,
p327
aVso it was an extremely difficult document for us.
p328
aVWe couldn't verify it because we didn't know
p329
aVwho wrote it and knew what it was about.
p330
aVSo we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was
p331
aVa competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.
p332
aVSo under that basis, we put it out and said,
p333
aV"Look, we're skeptical about this thing.
p334
aVWe don't know, but what can we do?
p335
aVThe material looks good, it feels right,
p336
aVbut we just can't verify it."
p337
aVAnd we then got a letter
p338
aVjust this week
p339
aVfrom the company who wrote it,
p340
aVwanting to track down the source \u2014
p341
aV(Laughter)
p342
aVsaying, "Hey, we want to track down the source."
p343
aVAnd we were like, "Oh, tell us more.
p344
aVWhat document is it, precisely, you're talking about?
p345
aVCan you show that you had legal authority over that document?
p346
aVIs it really yours?"
p347
aVSo they sent us this screen shot
p348
aVwith the author
p349
aVin the Microsoft Word ID.
p350
aVYeah.
p351
aV(Applause)
p352
aVThat's happened quite a lot though.
p353
aVThis is like one of our methods
p354
aVof identifying, of verifying, what a material is,
p355
aVis to try and get these guys to write letters.
p356
aa(lp357
VCA: Yeah. Have you had information
p358
aVfrom inside BP?
p359
aa(lp360
VJA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment,
p361
aVwe are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.
p362
aVSo our publication rate
p363
aVover the past few months
p364
aVhas been sort of minimized
p365
aVwhile we're re-engineering our back systems
p366
aVfor the phenomenal public interest that we have.
p367
aVThat's a problem.
p368
aVI mean, like any sort of growing startup organization,
p369
aVwe are sort of overwhelmed
p370
aVby our growth,
p371
aVand that means we're getting enormous quantity
p372
aVof whistleblower disclosures
p373
aVof a very high caliber
p374
aVbut don't have enough people to actually
p375
aVprocess and vet this information.
p376
aa(lp377
VCA: So that's the key bottleneck,
p378
aVbasically journalistic volunteers
p379
aVand/or the funding of journalistic salaries?
p380
aa(lp381
VJA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people.
p382
aVI mean, we're an organization
p383
aVthat is hard to grow very quickly
p384
aVbecause of the sort of material we deal with,
p385
aVso we have to restructure
p386
aVin order to have people
p387
aVwho will deal with the highest national security stuff,
p388
aVand then lower security cases.
p389
aa(lp390
VCA: So help us understand a bit about you personally
p391
aVand how you came to do this.
p392
aVAnd I think I read that as a kid
p393
aVyou went to 37 different schools.
p394
aVCan that be right?
p395
aa(lp396
VJA: Well, my parents were in the movie business
p397
aVand then on the run from a cult,
p398
aVso the combination between the two ...
p399
aa(lp400
V(Laughter)
p401
aa(lp402
VCA: I mean, a psychologist might say
p403
aVthat's a recipe for breeding paranoia.
p404
aa(lp405
VJA: What, the movie business?
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
V(Applause)
p410
aa(lp411
VCA: And you were also \u2014 I mean,
p412
aVyou were also a hacker at an early age
p413
aVand ran into the authorities early on.
p414
aVJA: Well, I was a journalist.
p415
aVYou know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age.
p416
aVI wrote a magazine,
p417
aVwas prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.
p418
aVSo you have to be careful with hacker.
p419
aVI mean there's like \u2014 there's a method
p420
aVthat can be deployed for various things.
p421
aVUnfortunately, at the moment,
p422
aVit's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia
p423
aVin order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.
p424
aVSo this phrase is not,
p425
aVnot as nice as it used to be.
p426
aa(lp427
VCA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think
p428
aVyou're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account,
p429
aVbut what about
p430
aVyour core values?
p431
aVCan you give us a sense of what they are
p432
aVand maybe some incident in your life
p433
aVthat helped determine them?
p434
aa(lp435
VJA: I'm not sure about the incident.
p436
aVBut the core values:
p437
aVwell, capable, generous men
p438
aVdo not create victims;
p439
aVthey nurture victims.
p440
aVAnd that's something from my father
p441
aVand something from other capable, generous men
p442
aVthat have been in my life.
p443
aa(lp444
VCA: Capable, generous men do not create victims;
p445
aVthey nurture victims?
p446
aa(lp447
VJA: Yeah. And you know,
p448
aVI'm a combative person,
p449
aVso I'm not actually so big on the nurture,
p450
aVbut some way \u2014
p451
aVthere is another way of nurturing victims,
p452
aVwhich is to police perpetrators
p453
aVof crime.
p454
aVAnd so that is something
p455
aVthat has been in my character
p456
aVfor a long time.
p457
aa(lp458
VCA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story:
p459
aVwhat happened in Iceland?
p460
aVYou basically published something there,
p461
aVran into trouble with a bank,
p462
aVthen the news service there
p463
aVwas injuncted from running the story.
p464
aVInstead, they publicized your side.
p465
aVThat made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next?
p466
aa(lp467
VJA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.
p468
aVIceland went through this financial crisis.
p469
aVIt was the hardest hit of any country in the world.
p470
aVIts banking sector was 10 times the GDP
p471
aVof the rest of the economy.
p472
aVAnyway, so we release this report
p473
aVin July last year.
p474
aVAnd the national TV station was injuncted
p475
aVfive minutes before it went on air,
p476
aVlike out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk,
p477
aVand the news reader was like,
p478
aV"This has never happened before. What do we do?"
p479
aVWell, we just show the website instead,
p480
aVfor all that time, as a filler,

aVand we became very famous in Iceland,
p482
aVwent to Iceland and spoke about this issue.
p483
aVAnd there was a feeling in the community
p484
aVthat that should never happen again,
p485
aVand as a result,
p486
aVworking with Icelandic politicians
p487
aVand some other international legal experts,
p488
aVwe put together a new sort of
p489
aVpackage of legislation for Iceland
p490
aVto sort of become an offshore haven
p491
aVfor the free press,
p492
aVwith the strongest journalistic protections in the world,
p493
aVwith a new Nobel Prize
p494
aVfor freedom of speech.
p495
aVIceland's a Nordic country,
p496
aVso, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.
p497
aVAnd just a month ago,
p498
aVthis was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.
p499

VLast question, Julian.
p505
aVWhen you think of the future then,
p506
aVdo you think it's more likely to be
p507
aVBig Brother exerting more control,
p508
aVmore secrecy,
p509
aVor us watching
p510
aVBig Brother,
p511
aVor it's just all to be played for either way?
p512
aa(lp513
VJA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go.
p514
aVI mean, there's enormous pressures
p515
aVto harmonize freedom of speech legislation
p516
aVand transparency legislation around the world \u2014
p517
aVwithin the E.U.,
p518
aVbetween China and the United States.
p519
aVWhich way is it going to go? It's hard to see.
p520
aVThat's why it's a very interesting time to be in \u2014
p521
aVbecause with just a little bit of effort,
p522
aVwe can shift it one way or the other.
p523
aa(lp524
VCA: Well, it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion
p525
aVto say, Julian, be careful,
p526
aVand all power to you.

His Wikipedia entry says he is &quot;constantly on the move,&quot; and <a href=\\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-11/daniel-ellsberg-wikileaks-julian-assange-in-danger/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">some speculate</a>  that his role in publishing <a href=\\"http://www.collateralmurder.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">decrypted US military video</a>  has put him in personal danger. A controversial figure, pundits debate whether his work is reckless and does more harm than good. Amnesty International recognized him with an International Media Award in 2009.<br /><br />Assange studied physics and mathematics at the University of Melbourne. He wrote Strobe, the first free and open-source port scanner, and contributed to the book&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/underground\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Underground: Tales of Hacking, Madness and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier</a>.</em></p>", "slug": "julian_assange", "whotheyare": "Internet activist Julian Assange serves as spokesperson for WikiLeaks, a controversial, volunteer-driven website that publishes and comments on leaked documents alleging government and corporate misconduct.", "whatotherssay": "WikiLeaks has had more scoops in three years than the Washington Post has had in 30.", "id": 779, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/184223_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Why the world needs WikiLeaks", "take_action": null, "comments": 750, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/185000_800x600.jpg", "description": "The controversial website WikiLeaks collects and posts highly classified documents and video.

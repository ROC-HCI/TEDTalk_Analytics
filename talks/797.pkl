VIf you think about the phone \u2014
p5
aVand Intel has tested
p6
aVa lot of the things I'm going to show you,
p7
aVover the last 10 years,
p8
aVin about 600 elderly households \u2014
p9
aV300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland \u2014
p10
aVtrying to understand: How do we measure
p11
aVand monitor behavior
p12
aVin a medically meaningful way?
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd if you think about the phone, right,
p15
aVit's something that we can use for some incredible ways
p16
aVto help people actually take the right medication at the right time.
p17
aVWe're testing these kinds of simple
p18
aVsensor-network technologies in the home
p19
aVso that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with
p20
aVcan help them deal with their medications.
p21
aVAnd a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone,
p22
aVand it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take,
p23
aVand they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend.
p24
aVAnd they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly,
p25
aVthat sits on their kitchen table and says,
p26
aV"I'm old. I'm frail."
p27
aVIt's surreptitious technology
p28
aVthat's helping them do a simple task
p29
aVof taking the right pill at the right time.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.
p32
aVBecause that moment when you answer the phone
p33
aVis a cognitive test every time that you do it.
p34
aVThink about it, all right? I'm going to answer the phone three different times.
p35
aV"Hello? Hey."
p36
aVAll right? That's the first time.
p37
aV"Hello? Uh, hey."
p38
aV"Hello? Uh, who?
p39
aVOh, hey."
p40
aVAll right? Very big differences
p41
aVbetween the way I answered the phone the three times.
p42
aVAnd as we monitor phone usage
p43
aVby seniors over a long period of time,
p44
aVdown to the tenths of a microsecond,
p45
aVthat recognition moment
p46
aVof whether they can figure out that person on the other end
p47
aVis a friend and we start talking to them immediately,
p48
aVor they do a lot of what's called trouble talk,
p49
aVwhere they're like, "Wait, who is this? Oh." Right?
p50
aVWaiting for that recognition moment
p51
aVmay be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia
p52
aVthan anything that shows up clinically today.
p53
aa(lp54
VWe call these behavioral markers.
p55
aVThere's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone
p56
aVas quickly, when it rings, as they used to?
p57
aVIs it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?
p58
aVHas their voice gotten more quiet? We're doing a lot of work with people
p59
aVwith Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's,
p60
aVwhere that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients
p61
aVmay be the best early indicator
p62
aVof Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically.
p63
aVBut those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time
p64
aVare hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme
p65
aVand your voice has become so quiet.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.
p68
aVWhen you pick up the phone,
p69
aVhow much tremor are you having,
p70
aVand what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time?
p71
aVAre you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to?
p72
aVIs it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis?
p73
aVAre you using the phone? Are you socializing less than you used to?
p74
aVAnd looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health
p75
aVmean, as a kind of a vital sign of the future?
p76
aVAnd then wow, what a radical idea,
p77
aVwe \u2014 except in the United States \u2014
p78
aVmight be able to use this newfangled technology
p79
aVto actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line.
p80
aVWow, what a great day that will be
p81
aVonce we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo, these are what I would call behavioral markers.
p84
aVAnd it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on
p85
aVfor the last 10 years at Intel.
p86
aVHow do you put simple disruptive technologies,
p87
aVand the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk?
p88
aVBehavioral markers matter.
p89
aVHow do we change behavior?
p90
aVHow do we measure changes in behavior
p91
aVin a meaningful way that's going to help us with
p92
aVprevention of disease, early onset of disease,
p93
aVand tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time?
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, why would Intel let me
p96
aVspend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years,
p97
aVtrying to understand the needs of seniors
p98
aVand start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers?
p99
aVThis is some of the field work that we've done.
p100
aVWe have now lived with 1,000 elderly households
p101
aVin 20 countries over the last 10 years.
p102
aVWe study people in Rochester, New York.
p103
aVWe go live with them in the winter
p104
aVbecause what they do in the winter,
p105
aVand their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize,
p106
aVis very different than in the summer.
p107
aVIf they have a hip fracture we go with them
p108
aVand we study their entire discharge experience.
p109
aVIf they have a family member who is a key part of their care network,
p110
aVwe fly and study them as well.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo, we study the holistic health experience
p113
aVof 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years
p114
aVin 20 different countries.
p115
aVWhy is Intel willing to fund that?
p116
aVIt's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about.
p117
aVTen years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel
p118
aVto let me go start looking at disruptive technologies
p119
aVthat could help with independent living,
p120
aVthis is what I called it: "Y2K + 10."
p121
aa(lp122
VYou know, back in 2000,
p123
aVwe were all so obsessed with paying attention
p124
aVto the aging of our computers,
p125
aVand whether or not they were going to survive
p126
aVthe tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000,
p127
aVthat we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to.
p128
aVIt was right around New Years.
p129
aVAnd that switchover,
p130
aVwhen we had the larger number of older people on the planet,
p131
aVfor the first time than younger people.
p132
aVFor the first time in human history \u2014 and barring aliens landing
p133
aVor some major other pandemic,
p134
aVthat's the expectation from demographers, going forward.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time
p137
aVto convince Intel to work on this. Right?
p138
aVY2K + 10 was coming,
p139
aVthe baby boomers starting to retire.
p140
aVWell folks, it's like we know these demographics here.
p141
aVThis is a map of the entire world.
p142
aVIt's like the lights are on,
p143
aVbut nobody's home on this demographic
p144
aVY2K + 10 problem. Right?
p145
aVI mean we sort of get it here, but we don't get it here,
p146
aVand we're not doing anything about it.
p147
aa(lp148
VThe health reform bill is largely ignoring
p149
aVthe realities of the age wave that's coming,
p150
aVand the implications for what we need to do to change
p151
aVnot only how we pay for care,
p152
aVbut deliver care in some radically different ways.
p153
aVAnd in fact, it's upon us.
p154
aVI mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey
p155
aVwho is the first boomer to actually get Social Security.
p156
aVThat actually occurred this year. She took early retirement.
p157
aVShe was born one second after midnight in 1946.
p158
aVA retired school teacher,
p159
aVthere she is with a Social Security administrator.
p160
aVThe first boomer actually, we didn't even wait till 2011, next year.
p161
aVWe're already starting to see early retirement occur this year.
p162
aa(lp163
VAll right, so it's here. This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door.
p164
aVThis is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar,
p165
aVbut somehow we can't sort of marshal our government
p166
aVand innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it
p167
aVand do something about it. We'll wait until
p168
aVit's more of a catastrophe, and react,
p169
aVas opposed to prepare for it.
p170
aVSo, one of the reasons it's so
p171
aVchallenging to prepare for this Y2K problem
p172
aVis, I want to argue, we have what I would call
p173
aVmainframe poisoning.
p174
aa(lp175
VAndy Grove, about six or seven years ago,
p176
aVhe doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine article
p177
aVhe used the phrase "mainframe healthcare,"
p178
aVand I've been extending and expanding this.
p179
aVHe saw it written down somewhere. He's like, "Eric that's a really cool concept."
p180
aVI was like, "Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article.
p181
aVI just extended it."
p182
aVYou know, this is the mainframe.
p183
aa(lp184
VThis mentality of traveling to
p185
aVand timesharing large, expensive healthcare systems
p186
aVactually began in 1787.
p187
aVThis is the first general hospital in Vienna.
p188
aVAnd actually the second general hospital in Vienna,
p189
aVin about 1850, was where we started to build out
p190
aVan entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties.
p191
aVAnd it's a place in which we started developing
p192
aVarchitecture that literally divided the body,
p193
aVand divided care into departments and compartments.
p194
aVAnd it was reflected in our architecture,
p195
aVit was reflected in the way that we taught students,
p196
aVand this mainframe mentality persists today.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, I'm not anti-hospital.
p199
aVWith my own healthcare problems, I've taken drug therapies,
p200
aVI've traveled to this hospital and others, many, many times.
p201
aVBut we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right?
p202
aVAnd this is mainframe healthcare.
p203
aVAnd just as 30 years ago
p204
aVwe couldn't conceive that we would have the power
p205
aVof a mainframe computer that took up a room this size
p206
aVin our purses and on our belts,
p207
aVthat we're carrying around in our cell phone today,
p208
aVand suddenly, computing,
p209
aVthat used to be an expert driven system,
p210
aVit was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives \u2014
p211
aVthat shift from mainframe to personal computing
p212
aVis what we have to do for healthcare.
p213
aVWe have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare
p214
aVto a personal model of healthcare.
p215
aa(lp216
VWe are obsessed with this way of thinking.
p217
aVWhen Intel does surveys all around the world and we say,
p218
aV"Quick response: healthcare."
p219
aVThe first word that comes up is "doctor."
p220
aVThe second that comes up is "hospital." And the third is "illness" or "sickness." Right?
p221
aVWe are wired, in our imagination, to think about healthcare
p222
aVand healthcare innovation as something
p223
aVthat goes into that place.
p224
aVOur entire health reform discussion right now,
p225
aVhealth I.T., when we talk with policy makers,
p226
aVequals "How are we going to get doctors using
p227
aVelectronic medical records in the mainframe?"
p228
aVWe're not thinking about
p229
aVhow do we shift from the mainframe to the home.
p230
aVAnd the problem with this is
p231
aVthe way we conceive healthcare. Right?
p232
aa(lp233
VThis is a very reactive, crisis-driven system.
p234
aVWe're doing 15-minute exams with patients.
p235
aVIt's population-based.
p236
aVWe collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting,
p237
aVand we fix them up, like Humpty-Dumpty all over again,
p238
aVand send them home,
p239
aVand hope \u2014 we might hand them a brochure, maybe an interactive website \u2014
p240
aVthat they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd the problem is we can't afford it today, folks.
p243
aVWe can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured.
p244
aVAnd now we want to do a double-double
p245
aVof the age wave coming through?
p246
aVBusiness as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different.
p247
aVWe've got to focus on the home.
p248
aa(lp249
VWe've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm
p250
aVthat moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive,
p251
aVprevention-driven?
p252
aVHow do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7?
p253
aVHow do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you?
p254
aVHow do we collect not just biological data
p255
aVbut behavioral data, psychological data,
p256
aVrelational data, in and on and around the home?
p257
aVAnd how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan
p258
aVthat uses all this great technology that's around us
p259
aVto change our behavior?
p260
aVThat's what we need to do for our personal health model.
p261
aa(lp262
VI want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi
p263
aVfrom one of our studies \u2014
p264
aVin her 90s, had to move out of her home
p265
aVbecause her family was worried about falls.
p266
aVRaise your hand if you had a serious fall
p267
aVin your household, or any of your loved ones,
p268
aVyour parents or so forth. Right?
p269
aVClassic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior.
p270
aVThis is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it,
p271
aVmoved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility.
p272
aVShe tripped over her oxygen tank.
p273
aa(lp274
VMany people in this generation won't press the button,
p275
aVeven if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody,
p276
aVeven though they've been paying 30 dollars a month.
p277
aVBoomers will press the button. Trust me.
p278
aVThey're going to be pressing that button non-stop. Right?
p279
aa(lp280
VMimi broke her pelvis, lay all night, all morning,
p281
aVfinally somebody came in and found her,
p282
aVsent her to the hospital.
p283
aVThey fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back
p284
aVinto the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit.
p285
aVFirst night in the nursing home unit where she had been
p286
aVin the same assisted living facility, moved her from one bed to another,
p287
aVkind of threw her, rebroke her pelvis,
p288
aVsent her back to the hospital that she had just come from,
p289
aVno one read the chart, put her on Tylenol,
p290
aVwhich she is allergic to, broke out, got bedsores,
p291
aVbasically, had heart problems, and died
p292
aVfrom the fall and the complications and the errors that were there.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, the most frightening thing about this is
p295
aVthis is my wife's grandmother.
p296
aVNow, I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English,
p297
aVI work for Intel, I make a good salary,
p298
aVI'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries \u2014
p299
aVit's an area of research that I work on.
p300
aVI have access to senators and CEOs.
p301
aVI can't stop this from happening.
p302
aVWhat happens if you don't have money, you don't speak English
p303
aVor don't have the kind of access
p304
aVto deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur?
p305
aVHow do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls
p306
aVfrom ever occurring in the first place?
p307
aa(lp308
VLet me give you a quick example of work that we're doing
p309
aVto try to do exactly that.
p310
aVI've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer.
p311
aVIt's a research platform.
p312
aVIt has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG.
p313
aVThere is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play
p314
aVkind of Legos that you can do to capture, in the wild,
p315
aVin the real world,
p316
aVthings like tremor, gait,
p317
aVstride length and those kinds of things.
p318
aa(lp319
VThe problem is, our understanding of falls today,
p320
aVlike Mimi, is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell,
p321
aVfrom the State, saying, "What were you doing when you fell?"
p322
aVThat's sort of the state of the art.
p323
aVBut with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet,
p324
aVembedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systems
p325
aVthat we borrowed from sports medicine,
p326
aVwe're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households
p327
aVto collect actual kinematic motion data
p328
aVto understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurring
p329
aVthat can show us that mom has become risk at falls?
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd most often we can do two interventions,
p332
aVfix the meds mix.
p333
aVI'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming in
p334
aVfrom these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the day
p335
aVthat some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else
p336
aVknew that they were on, because we see the changes
p337
aVin their patterns in the household. Right?
p338
aVThese discoveries of behavioral markers,
p339
aVand behavioral changes
p340
aVare game changing, and like the discovery of the microscope
p341
aVbecause of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before.
p342
aa(lp343
VThis is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland
p344
aVof \u2014 actually what you're seeing is
p345
aVshe's looking at data,
p346
aVin this picture, from the Magic Carpet.
p347
aVSo, we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway,
p348
aVand look at the changes in your postural sway over many months.
p349
aVHere's what some of this data might look like.
p350
aVThis is actually sensor firings.
p351
aa(lp352
VThese are two different subjects in our study.
p353
aVIt's about a year's worth of data.
p354
aVThe color represents different rooms they are in the house.
p355
aVThis person on the left is living in their own home.
p356
aVThis person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility.
p357
aVI know this because look at how punctuated meal time is
p358
aVwhen they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right?
p359
aVNow, this doesn't mean that much to you.
p360
aVBut when we look at these cycles of data
p361
aVover a longer period of time \u2014 and we're looking at everything from
p362
aVmotion around different rooms in the house,
p363
aVto sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up,
p364
aVabout gait and stride length \u2014 these streams of data
p365
aVare starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns
p366
aVthat we've never understood before.
p367
aa(lp368
VYou can go to ORCATech.org \u2014
p369
aVit has nothing to do with whales, it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology \u2014
p370
aVto see more about that.
p371
aVThe problem is, Intel is still one of the largest
p372
aVfunders in the world
p373
aVof independent living technology research.
p374
aVI'm not bragging about how much we fund;
p375
aVit's how little anyone else actually pays attention
p376
aVto aging and funds innovation on aging,
p377
aVchronic disease management and independent living in the home.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo, my mantra here, my fourth slogan is:
p380
aV10,000 households or bust.
p381
aVWe need to drive
p382
aVa national, if not international, Framingham-type heart study
p383
aVof independent living technologies,
p384
aVwhere we have 10,000 elderly connected households
p385
aVwith broadband, full medical characterization,
p386
aVand a platform by which we can start to experiment
p387
aVand turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies
p388
aVthat the universities fund,
p389
aVto large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies.
p390
aVSo, 10,000 households or bust.
p391
aVThese are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies.
p392
aa(lp393
VMy fifth and final phrase:
p394
aVI have tried for two years,
p395
aVand there were moments when we were quite close,
p396
aVto make this healthcare reform bill be about reform
p397
aVfrom something and to something,
p398
aVfrom a mainframe model
p399
aVto a personal health model,
p400
aVor to mean something more than just a debate
p401
aVabout the public option and how we're going to finance.
p402
aVIt doesn't matter how we finance healthcare.
p403
aVWe're going to figure something out
p404
aVfor the next 10 years, and try it.
p405
aVNo matter who pays for it,
p406
aVwe better start doing care in a fundamentally different way
p407
aVand treating the home and the patient
p408
aVand the family member and the caregivers
p409
aVas part of these coordinated care teams
p410
aVand using disruptive technologies that are already here
p411
aVto do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.
p412
aa(lp413
VThe president needs to stand up and say,
p414
aVat the end of a healthcare reform debate,
p415
aV"Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care
p416
aVout of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,
p417
aVto the home, in 10 years."
p418
aVIt's achievable. We should do it economically,
p419
aVwe should do it morally,
p420
aVand we should do it for quality of life.
p421
aVBut there is no goal within this health reform.
p422
aVIt's just a mess today.
p423
aa(lp424
VSo, you know, that's my last message to you.
p425
aVHow do we set a going-to-the-moon goal
p426
aVof dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?

aVIt's not that innovation and technology is going to be the
p428
aVmagic pill that cures all, but it's going to be part of the solution.
p429
aVAnd if we don't create a personal health movement,
p430
aVsomething that we're all aiming towards in reform,
p431
aVthen we're going to move nowhere.
p432
aVSo, I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.
p433
aVThanks very much.

VI'm going to talk to you tonight
p5
aVabout coming out of the closet,
p6
aVand not in the traditional sense,
p7
aVnot just the gay closet.
p8
aVI think we all have closets.
p9
aVYour closet may be telling someone
p10
aVyou love her for the first time,
p11
aVor telling someone that you're pregnant,
p12
aVor telling someone you have cancer,
p13
aVor any of the other hard conversations
p14
aVwe have throughout our lives.
p15
aVAll a closet is is a hard conversation,
p16
aVand although our topics may vary tremendously,
p17
aVthe experience of being in
p18
aVand coming out of the closet is universal.
p19
aVIt is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.
p20
aa(lp21
VSeveral years ago,
p22
aVI was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe,
p23
aVa local diner in town,
p24
aVand during my time there I would go through phases
p25
aVof militant lesbian intensity:
p26
aVnot shaving my armpits,
p27
aVquoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel.
p28
aVAnd depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts
p29
aVand how recently I had shaved my head,
p30
aVthe question would often be sprung on me,
p31
aVusually by a little kid:
p32
aa(lp33
V"Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?"
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd there would be an awkward silence at the table.
p36
aVI'd clench my jaw a little tighter,
p37
aVhold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance.
p38
aVThe dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper
p39
aVand the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid.
p40
aVBut I would say nothing,
p41
aVand I would seethe inside.
p42
aVAnd it got to the point where every time I walked up
p43
aVto a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVAnd that is a terrible feeling.
p46
aVSo I promised myself, the next time, I would say something.
p47
aVI would have that hard conversation.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo within a matter of weeks, it happens again.
p50
aa(lp51
V"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"
p52
aa(lp53
VFamiliar silence, but this time I'm ready,
p54
aVand I am about to go all Women's Studies 101
p55
aVon this table. (Laughter)
p56
aVI've got my Betty Friedan quotes.
p57
aVI've got my Gloria Steinem quotes.
p58
aVI've even got this little bit from "Vagina Monologues" I'm going to do.
p59
aVSo I take a deep breath and I look down
p60
aVand staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress,
p61
aVnot a challenge to a feminist duel,
p62
aVjust a kid with a question:
p63
aV"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"
p64
aa(lp65
VSo I take another deep breath,
p66
aVsquat down to next to her, and say,
p67
aV"Hey, I know it's kind of confusing.
p68
aVMy hair is short like a boy's,
p69
aVand I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl,
p70
aVand you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress,
p71
aVand sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies?
p72
aVWell, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl."
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd this kid looks me dead in the eye,
p75
aVwithout missing a beat, and says,
p76
aV"My favorite pajamas are purple with fish.
p77
aVCan I get a pancake, please?"
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVAnd that was it. Just, "Oh, okay. You're a girl.
p80
aVHow about that pancake?"
p81
aa(lp82
VIt was the easiest hard conversation
p83
aVI have ever had.
p84
aVAnd why? Because Pancake Girl and I,
p85
aVwe were both real with each other.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo like many of us,
p88
aVI've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah,
p89
aVmost often, my walls happened to be rainbow.
p90
aVBut inside, in the dark,
p91
aVyou can't tell what color the walls are.
p92
aVYou just know what it feels like to live in a closet.
p93
aVSo really, my closet is no different than yours
p94
aVor yours or yours.
p95
aVSure, I'll give you 100 reasons
p96
aVwhy coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours,
p97
aVbut here's the thing: Hard is not relative.
p98
aVHard is hard.
p99
aVWho can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy
p100
aVis harder than telling someone you just cheated on them?
p101
aVWho can tell me that his coming out story
p102
aVis harder than telling your five-year-old  you're getting a divorce?
p103
aVThere is no harder, there is just hard.
p104
aVWe need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard
p105
aVto make us feel better or worse about our closets
p106
aVand just commiserate on the  fact that we all have hard.
p107
aVAt some point in our lives, we all live in closets,
p108
aVand they may feel safe,
p109
aVor at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door.
p110
aVBut I am here to tell you,
p111
aVno matter what your walls are made of,
p112
aVa closet is no place for a person to live.
p113
aa(lp114
VThanks. (Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VSo imagine yourself 20 years ago.
p117
aVMe, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress,
p118
aVand high-heeled shoes.
p119
aVI was not the militant lesbian
p120
aVready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe.
p121
aVI was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner
p122
aVof my pitch-black closet
p123
aVclutching my gay grenade,
p124
aVand moving one muscle is the scariest thing
p125
aVI have ever done.
p126
aVMy family, my friends, complete strangers \u2014
p127
aVI had spent my entire life
p128
aVtrying to not disappoint these people,
p129
aVand now I was turning the world upside down
p130
aVon purpose.
p131
aVI was burning the pages of the script
p132
aVwe had all followed for so long,
p133
aVbut if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.
p134
aa(lp135
VOne of my most memorable grenade tosses
p136
aVwas at my sister's wedding.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVIt was the first time that many in attendance
p139
aVknew I was gay, so in doing  my maid of honor duties,
p140
aVin my black dress and heels,
p141
aVI walked around to tables
p142
aVand finally landed on a table of my parents' friends,
p143
aVfolks that had known me for years.
p144
aVAnd after a little small talk, one of the women shouted out,
p145
aV"I love Nathan Lane!"
p146
aVAnd the battle of gay relatability had begun.
p147
aa(lp148
V"Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?"
p149
aa(lp150
V"Well, yeah, actually, we have friends in San Francisco."
p151
aa(lp152
V"Well, we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous."
p153
aa(lp154
V"Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?
p155
aVHe's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend."
p156
aa(lp157
V"Ash, what's your favorite TV show?
p158
aVOur favorite TV show? Favorite: Will & Grace.
p159
aVAnd you know who we love? Jack.
p160
aVJack is our favorite."
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd then one woman, stumped
p163
aVbut wanting so desperately to show her support,
p164
aVto let me know she was on my side,
p165
aVshe finally blurted out,
p166
aV"Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts."
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd I had a choice in that moment,
p170
aVas all grenade throwers do.
p171
aVI could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-loving table
p172
aVand mock their responses,
p173
aVchastise their unworldliness and their inability
p174
aVto jump through the politically correct  gay hoops I had brought with me,
p175
aVor I could empathize with them
p176
aVand realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done,
p177
aVthat starting and having that conversation
p178
aVwas them coming out of their closets.
p179
aVSure, it would have been easy to point out where they felt short.
p180
aVIt's a lot harder to meet them where they are
p181
aVand acknowledge the fact that they were trying.
p182
aVAnd what else can you ask someone to do but try?
p183
aVIf you're going to be real with someone,
p184
aVyou gotta be ready for real in return.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo hard conversations are still not my strong suit.
p187
aVAsk anybody I have ever dated.
p188
aVBut I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call
p189
aVthe three Pancake Girl principles.
p190
aVNow, please view this through gay-colored lenses,
p191
aVbut know what it takes to come out of any closet
p192
aVis essentially the same.
p193
aa(lp194
VNumber one: Be authentic.
p195
aVTake the armor off. Be yourself.
p196
aVThat kid in the cafe had no armor,
p197
aVbut I was ready for battle.
p198
aVIf you want someone to be real with you,
p199
aVthey need to know that you bleed too.
p200
aa(lp201
VNumber two: Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band-Aid off.
p202
aVIf you know you are gay, just say it.
p203
aVIf you tell your parents you might be gay,
p204
aVthey will hold out hope that this will change.
p205
aVDo not give them that sense of false hope.
p206
aV(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd number three, and most important \u2014
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVBe unapologetic.
p211
aVYou are speaking your truth.
p212
aVNever apologize for that.
p213
aVAnd some folks may have gotten hurt along the way,
p214
aVso sure, apologize for what you've done,
p215
aVbut never apologize for who you are.
p216
aVAnd yeah, some folks may be disappointed,
p217
aVbut that is on them, not on you.
p218
aVThose are their expectations of who you are, not yours.
p219
aVThat is their story, not yours.
p220
aVThe only story that matters
p221
aVis the one that you want to write.
p222
aVSo the next time you find yourself
p223
aVin a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade,
p224
aVknow we have all been there before.
p225
aVAnd you may feel so very alone, but you are not.
p226
aVAnd we know it's hard but we need you out here,
p227
aVno matter what your walls are made of,
p228
aVbecause I guarantee you there are others
p229
aVpeering through the keyholes of their closets
p230
aVlooking for the next brave soul to bust a door open, so be that person
p231
aVand show the world that we are bigger than our closets
p232
aVand that a closet is no place for a person
p233
aVto truly live.
p234
aa(lp235
VThank you, Boulder. Enjoy your night. (Applause)

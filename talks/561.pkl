VI have a big impact on the planet
p5
aVto travel here by plane.
p6
aVI emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2;
p7
aVthat is the weight of two elephants.
p8
aVI came here to speak about ecology,
p9
aVand I emitted as much CO2
p10
aVas a Frenchman in one year.
p11
aVSo what do I have to do?
p12
aVI have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVI have to do my carbon offset in another way,
p15
aVlike I do every time.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VIn fact my work is to show
p19
aVour impact on our planet.
p20
aVI'm going to show you some examples
p21
aVof the last pictures I've done
p22
aVin the last year.
p23
aa(lp24
VAlberta sand oil, a lot of pollution.
p25
aVYou know the problem;
p26
aVwe don't want to believe what we know.
p27
aVIn Alberta people work nonstop,
p28
aV24 hours by seven
p29
aVto extract as much oil
p30
aVas they can.
p31
aVWe know about the end of oil.
p32
aVOil sand is not a long-term solution.
p33
aVBut we use three times more oil
p34
aVthan we find every year.
p35
aVWe don't want to believe what we know.
p36
aVDeny.
p37
aa(lp38
VCoral reef in New Caledonia.
p39
aV100 percent of the coral
p40
aVmay be wiped out before 2050
p41
aVbecause of global warming.
p42
aVAnd you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature,
p43
aVand are very important for the biodiversity of the sea.
p44
aa(lp45
VNorth Pole. I've done this picture last summer.
p46
aVIt was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago.
p47
aVNow there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific.
p48
aVThe thickness of the Arctic
p49
aVdecreased more than 40 percent
p50
aVsince 1960.
p51
aa(lp52
VThere is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice.
p53
aVSad picture.
p54
aVIt lost 80 percent of its ice.
p55
aVAccording to scientists,
p56
aVin 100 years
p57
aVall the mountain glacier will be gone.
p58
aVGlaciers are very important for the life on earth.
p59
aVLike Al Gore told you,
p60
aVtwo billion people live on the water
p61
aVfrom the glacier of Himalaya.

p68
aVAccording to FAO,
p69
aVif we don't change our system of fishing
p70
aVthe main sea resources will be gone in 2050.
p71
aVWe don't want to believe what we know.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.
p74
aVOne human of six
p75
aVhave not enough to eat in the world.
p76
aVOne billion people have not enough to eat.

aVAccording to the U.N.,
p88
aVwe speak about 250 million refugees
p89
aVin 2050.
p90
aa(lp91
VI always show my pictures in the street.
p92
aVWe have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.
p93
aVBut how to understand the world
p94
aVwithout the voice of people?
p95
aVLandscape was not enough.
p96
aVIt was obvious to me to do another work.
p97
aVI launched a project named Six Billion Others.
p98
aVI sent around the world six cameramen
p99
aVasking the same question,
p100
aVthe same crucial question,
p101
aVabout life.
p102
aVWe have done five thousand interviews.
p103
aVI'm going to show you this.
p104
aa(lp105
VMan: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?
p106
aVIt's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."
p107
aa(lp108
VWoman: Love? Love is nice if you can have it.
p109
aa(lp110
VSecond Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha,
p111
aVthis is love! Third Man: My greatest fear is ...
p112
aa(lp113
VWoman: You're asking me a hard question.
p114
aa(lp115
VFourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do?
p116
aa(lp117
VFifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,)
p118
aVFifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.)
p119
aVFifth Man: we were having fun, biking. (Sixth Man: I will never forget those words.)
p120
aa(lp121
VSeventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic.
p122
aa(lp123
VEighth Man: I had a big laugh today.
p124
aVNinth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful.
p125
aa(lp126
V10th Man: In the word life, you have the life.
p127
aa(lp128
V11th Man: Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question?
p129
aa(lp130
V12th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq
p131
aVand speak to the people,
p132
aVI'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.
p133
aVJust as that woman tried to kiss my feet
p134
aVwhen we were taking her sons.
p135
aVI feel ashamed.
p136
aVAnd I feel humbled
p137
aVby their strength.
p138
aVAnd I will forever feel a need
p139
aVto make reparations to Iraq.
p140
aa(lp141
VSecond Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up.
p142
aVYou shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work.
p143
aVMy family ... What can I say?
p144
aVAt the moment, my family is very poor,
p145
aVmy life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more
p146
aVand to let my parents stay and have something to live on.
p147
aVI don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.
p148
aVIf someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.
p149
aVThank you.
p150
aVThank you for having fed me and raised me,
p151
aVand for making my life of today. Thank you.
p152
aa(lp153
V13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair,
p154
aVI've done more in life being in a chair
p155
aVthan out of a chair.
p156
aVI still surf. I sail the world. I freedive.
p157
aVAfter many people said I couldn't do that.
p158
aVAnd I think that comes from connecting with nature,
p159
aVconnecting with the energy of life,
p160
aVbecause we're all disabled in some way on the planet \u2014
p161
aVspiritually, mentally or physically.
p162
aVI got the easy part.
p163
aa(lp164
V14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other.
p165
aVYou come from elsewhere.
p166
aVYou don't know me. I don't know you.
p167
aVWe talk without lying.
p168
aVIf I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things
p169
aVand we become friends.
p170
aVHow can we make it all by ourselves?
p171
aa(lp172
V(Applause)
p173
aa(lp174
VYAB: You can also go to the website,
p175
aVanswer \u2014 respond to the questions also.
p176
aVForty crucial questions.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow I am going to speak to you about my movie.
p179
aVFor the last three years,
p180
aVI was shooting the earth for the movie.
p181
aVThe name of the movie is "Home" \u2014
p182
aV"Maison."
p183
aVIt is about the state of the planet.
p184
aVIt's a fantastic story of life on the earth.
p185
aVI'm very proud to show you the teaser.
p186
aa(lp187
VVideo: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.
p188
aVThese plants, several hundred million years old.
p189
aVAnd we humans have been walking upright
p190
aVfor only 200 thousand years.
p191
aVWe've managed to adapt,
p192
aVand have conquered the whole planet.
p193
aVFor generations, we've been raising our children,
p194
aVnot unlike millions of other species living beside us.
p195
aVFor the past 30 years
p196
aVI've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers
p197
aVfrom high up in the sky.
p198
aVOur life is tied to the well-being of our planet.
p199
aVWe depend on water,
p200
aVforests,
p201
aVdeserts,
p202
aVoceans.
p203
aVFishing,
p204
aVbreeding,
p205
aVfarming
p206
aVare still the world's foremost human occupations.
p207
aVAnd what binds us together
p208
aVis far greater than what divides us.
p209
aVWe all share the same need for the earth's gifts \u2014
p210
aVthe same wish to rise above ourselves,
p211
aVand become better.
p212
aVAnd yet we carry on raising walls
p213
aVto keep us apart.
p214
aa(lp215
VToday our greatest battle
p216
aVis to protect the natural offerings of our planet.
p217
aVIn less than 50 years
p218
aVwe've altered it more thoroughly
p219
aVthan in the entire history of mankind.
p220
aVHalf of the world's forests have vanished.
p221
aVWater resources are running low.
p222
aVIntensive farming is depleting soils.
p223
aVOur energy sources are not sustainable.
p224
aVThe climate is changing.
p225
aVWe are endangering ourselves.
p226
aVWe're only trying to improve our lives.
p227
aVBut the wealth gaps are growing wider.
p228
aVWe haven't yet understood
p229
aVthat we're going at a much faster pace
p230
aVthan the planet can sustain.
p231
aVWe know that solutions are available today.
p232
aVWe all have the power to change this trend
p233
aVfor the better.
p234
aVSo what are we waiting for?
p235
aV(Applause)
p236
aa(lp237
VYAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.
p238
aVBut it is not a normal movie.
p239
aVThe film is going to be distributed free.
p240
aVThis film has no copyright.
p241
aVOn the five of June,
p242
aVthe environment day,
p243
aVeverybody can download the movie on Internet.
p244
aVThe film is given for free
p245
aVto the distributor for TV and theater
p246
aVto show it the fifth of June.
p247
aVThere is no business on this movie.
p248
aVIt is also available for school,
p249
aVcities, NGOs and you.
p250
aa(lp251
VWe have to believe what we know.
p252
aVLet me tell you something.
p253
aVIt's too late to be pessimistic \u2014
p254
aVreally too late.
p255
aVWe have all a part of the solutions.
p256
aVTo finish,
p257
aVI would like to welcome
p258
aVthe 4,700th baby
p259
aVborn since the beginning of this talk.
p260
aVMerci beaucoup. I love you.

VThirteen trillion dollars in wealth
p5
aVhas evaporated over the course of the last two years.
p6
aVWe've questioned the future of capitalism.
p7
aVWe've questioned the financial industry.
p8
aVWe've looked at our government oversight.
p9
aVWe've questioned where we're going.
p10
aVAnd yet, at the same time,
p11
aVthis very well may be a seminal moment in American history,
p12
aVan opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us
p13
aVto a new trajectory in America.
p14
aa(lp15
VI'm calling this The Great Unwind.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd the idea is a simple, simple idea,
p20
aVwhich is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety
p21
aVto action.
p22
aVConsumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America
p23
aVhave actually started, just like banks and just like businesses,
p24
aVto de-leverage, to unwind their leverage in daily life,
p25
aVto remove themselves from the liability and risk
p26
aVthat presents itself as they move forward.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo, to understand this \u2014 and I'm going to stress this \u2014
p29
aVit's not about the consumer being in retreat.
p30
aVThe consumer is empowered.
p31
aVTo understand this, we'll step back and look at what's happened
p32
aVover the last year and a half.
p33
aVSo if you've been gone, this is the CliffsNotes
p34
aVon what's happened in the economy.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VUnemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down.
p39
aVCommodity prices are like this.
p40
aa(lp41
VIf you're a mom trying to manage a budget,
p42
aVand oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer,
p43
aVand it's somewhere between 50 and 70,
p44
aVdo you plan vacations?
p45
aVHow do you buy?
p46
aVWhat's your strategy in your household? Will the bailout work?
p47
aVWe have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, health care \u2014
p48
aVall these issues facing us.
p49
aVYou put them all together, mix them up in a bouillabaisse,
p50
aVand you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time bomb.
p51
aa(lp52
VIn fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis,
p53
aVbecause the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives,
p54
aVactually contributed a large part to the problem.
p55
aVThis is something I call the 50-20 paradox.
p56
aVIt took us 50 years
p57
aVto reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent.
p58
aVFifty years.
p59
aVDo you know what this was right here? This was World War II.
p60
aVDo you know why savings was so high?
p61
aVThere was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhat happened, though, over the course of the last 20 years,
p64
aVwe went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate.
p65
aVBecause we binged.
p66
aVWe bought extra-large cars, supersized everything,
p67
aVwe bought remedies for restless leg syndrome.
p68
aVAll these things together basically created a factor
p69
aVwhere the consumer drove us headlong into the crisis
p70
aVthat we face today.
p71
aVThe personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 to 135 percent
p72
aVin the span of about 15 years.
p73
aVSo consumers got over-leveraged.
p74
aVAnd of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.
p75
aa(lp76
VThis is an absolutely staggering chart.
p77
aVIt shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009.
p78
aVAnd what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon
p79
aVthat we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging
p80
aVfuture education, future children in our households.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout,
p83
aVwhat you can see is, if you stack up dollar bills,
p84
aVfirst of all, 360,000 dollars
p85
aVis about the size of a five-foot-four guy.
p86
aVBut if you stack it up, you see this amazing, staggering amount of dollars
p87
aVthat have been put into the system to fund and bail us out.
p88
aVSo this is the first 315 billion.
p89
aVBut I read this fact the other day,
p90
aVthat one trillion seconds equals 32,000 years.
p91
aVSo if you think about that,
p92
aVthe context, the casualness with which we talk about
p93
aVtrillion-dollar bailout here and trillion there,
p94
aVwe are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.
p95
aa(lp96
VHowever, consumers have moved.
p97
aVThey are taking responsibility.
p98
aVWhat we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate.
p99
aVIn fact, 11 straight months of savings have happened
p100
aVsince the beginning of the crisis.
p101
aVWe're working our way back up to that 10 percent.
p102
aVAlso, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,
p103
aVspending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years \u2014
p104
aValmost a 3.7 percent decline.
p105
aa(lp106
VVisa now reports that more people are using debit cards than credit cards.
p107
aVSo we're starting to pay for things with money that we have.
p108
aVAnd we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and invest.
p109
aVBut that's not really the whole story,
p110
aVbecause this has also been a dramatic time of transformation.
p111
aVAnd you've got to admit, over the last year and a half,
p112
aVconsumers have been doing some weird things.
p113
aVIt's pretty staggering, what we've lived through.
p114
aVIf you take into account that 80 percent of all Americans
p115
aVwere born after World War II,
p116
aVthis was essentially our Depression.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd so, as a result, some crazy things have happened.
p119
aVI'll give you some examples.
p120
aVLet's talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VDentists report molars \u2014 people grinding their teeth,
p125
aVcoming in and reporting that they've had stress.
p126
aVSo there's an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced.
p127
aVGun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks,
p128
aVare up almost 25 percent since January.
p129
aVVasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell Institute.
p130
aVAnd lastly, but a very good point,
p131
aVhopefully not related to the former point I just made,
p132
aVwhich is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003.
p133
aVDoes anybody know why?
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VNo one's at the beach.
p138
aVSo there's a bright side to everything.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut seriously, what we see happening,
p141
aVand the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat,
p142
aVis that this is a tremendous opportunity
p143
aVfor the consumer who drove us into this recession
p144
aVto lead us right back out.
p145
aVWhat I mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption
p146
aVto mindful consumption.
p147
aVRight?
p148
aa(lp149
V(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VIf you think about the last three decades,
p152
aVthe consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s,
p153
aVto gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade.
p154
aVBut the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate.
p155
aVBy restricting their demand,
p156
aVconsumers can actually align their values with their spending,
p157
aVand drive capitalism and business to not just be about more,
p158
aVbut to be about better.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe're going to explain that right now.
p161
aVBased on Y&R's BrandAsset Valuator,
p162
aVproprietary tool of VML and Young & Rubicam,
p163
aVwe set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis
p164
aVwith the consumer marketplace.
p165
aVWe found a couple of really interesting things.
p166
aVWe're going to go through four value shifts
p167
aVthat we see driving new consumer behaviors,
p168
aVthat offer new management principles.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe first cultural value shift we see
p171
aVis this tendency toward something we call "liquid life."
p172
aVThis is the movement
p173
aVfrom Americans defining their success on having things
p174
aVto having liquidity,
p175
aVbecause the less excess that you have around you,
p176
aVthe more nimble and fleet of foot you are.
p177
aVAs a result, déclassé consumption is in.
p178
aVDéclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously
p179
aVmakes you look a little bit anti-fashion.
p180
aVThe management principle is dollars and cents.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo let's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption
p183
aVthat falls out of this value.
p184
aVThe first thing is, something must be happening
p185
aVwhen P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VBut seriously, we also have this phenomenon
p190
aVon Madison Avenue and in other places,
p191
aVwhere people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques
p192
aVwith ordinary, generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases.
p193
aVWe see high-end haggling in fashion today,
p194
aVhigh-end haggling for luxury and real estate.
p195
aVWe also see just a relaxing of ego,
p196
aVand sort of a dismantling of artifice.
p197
aa(lp198
VThis is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar.
p199
aVBlue-collar yacht club \u2014 where you can join,
p200
aVbut you've got to work in the boatyard as condition of membership.
p201
aVWe also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low-key:
p202
aVagritourism \u2014 going to vineyards and going to farms.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents.
p205
aVWhat businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets
p206
aVis really interesting.
p207
aVA couple things that are kind of cool.
p208
aVOne is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer.
p209
aVThey found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month,
p210
aVless at the end of the month.
p211
aVSo they started to change their packaging:
p212
aVlarger packs at the beginning of the month,
p213
aVsmaller packaging at the end of the month.
p214
aa(lp215
VReally interestingly, too, was the San Francisco Giants.
p216
aVThey've just instituted dynamic pricing.
p217
aVIt takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups,
p218
aVto the weather, to the team records,
p219
aVin setting prices for the consumer.
p220
aVAnother quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga.
p221
aVZynga has risen on the consumer's desire
p222
aVto not want to be locked in to fixed cost.
p223
aVAgain, this theme is about variable cost, variable living.
p224
aVSo micro-payments have become huge.
p225
aVAnd lastly, some people are using Hulu
p226
aVas a device to get rid of their cable bill.
p227
aVSo, really clever ideas there that are being taken ahold of
p228
aVand that marketers are starting to understand.
p229
aa(lp230
VThe second of the four values is this movement toward
p231
aVethics and fair play.
p232
aVWe see that play itself out with empathy and respect.
p233
aVThe consumer is demanding it.
p234
aVAnd, as a result, businesses must provide not only value,
p235
aVbut values.
p236
aVIncreasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company,
p237
aVat their conduct in the marketplace.
p238
aVSo we see with empathy and respect
p239
aVlots of really hopeful things come out of this recession.
p240
aVI'll give you a few examples.
p241
aa(lp242
VOne is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods,
p243
aVand increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system.
p244
aVAlso, a wonderful by-product of a really lousy thing,
p245
aVwhich has been unemployment,
p246
aVis a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country.
p247
aVWe also see the phenomenon \u2014 some of you may have "boomerang kids" \u2014
p248
aVthese are "boomerang alumni,"
p249
aVwhere universities are actually reconnecting with alumni
p250
aVand helping them with jobs, sharing skills and retraining.
p251
aVWe also talked about character and professionalism.
p252
aVWe had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City in January,
p253
aVand suddenly Sully has become a key name on BabyCenter.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VSo, from a value and values standpoint,
p258
aVwhat companies can do is connect in lots of different ways.
p259
aVMicrosoft is doing something wonderful.
p260
aVThey are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with IT training,
p261
aVusing their existing infrastructure to do something good.
p262
aa(lp263
VAlso, a really interesting company is GORE-TEX.
p264
aVGORE-TEX is all about personal accountability
p265
aVof their management and their employees,
p266
aVto the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses.
p267
aVBut they also talk about the fact that their executives \u2014
p268
aVall of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet
p269
aVfor everyone to see.
p270
aVComplete transparency.
p271
aVThink twice before you have that bottle of wine.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VThe third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism
p276
aVis about durable living.
p277
aVWe're seeing in our data that consumers are realizing
p278
aVthis is a marathon, not a sprint.
p279
aVThey're digging in and looking for ways to extract value
p280
aVout of every purchase they make.
p281
aVWitness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars
p282
aVlonger than ever before: 9.4 years on average, in March.
p283
aVA record.
p284
aVWe also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America.
p285
aVDid you know that 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card?
p286
aVThe highest percentage ever in our nation's history.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge.
p289
aVContinuing education is up.
p290
aVEverything is focused on betterment, training,
p291
aVdevelopment and moving forward.
p292
aVWe also see a big DIY movement.
p293
aVI was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America
p294
aVare actually built by owners.
p295
aVThat includes cottages and the like,
p296
aVbut 30 percent.
p297
aVPeople are getting their hands dirty, rolling up their sleeves.
p298
aVThey want these skills.
p299
aa(lp300
VWe see it with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens, chickens and ducks.
p301
aVAnd when you work out the math, they say it doesn't work,
p302
aVbut the principle is there;
p303
aVit's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself.
p304
aVThen we look at the High Line in New York City,
p305
aVan excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure
p306
aVfor something good,
p307
aVwhich is a brand-new park in New York City.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo what brands can do, and companies, is pay dividends to consumers,
p310
aVbe a brand that lasts,
p311
aVoffer transparency,
p312
aVpromise you're going to be there beyond today's sale.
p313
aVPerfect example of that is Patagonia.
p314
aVPatagonia's "Footprint Chronicles"
p315
aVbasically goes through and tracks every product they make,
p316
aVand gives you social responsibility,
p317
aVand helps you understand the ethics behind the product they make.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnother great example is Fidelity.
p320
aVRather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases,
p321
aVthis is about 529 rewards for your student education.
p322
aVOr the interesting company Sunrun.
p323
aVI love this company.
p324
aVThey've created a consumer collective
p325
aVwhere they put solar panels on households
p326
aVand create a consumer-based utility,
p327
aVwhere the electricity they generate
p328
aVis basically pumped back out into the marketplace.
p329
aVSo it's a consumer-driven co-op.
p330
aa(lp331
VThe fourth post-crisis consumerism that we see
p332
aVis this movement about "return to the fold."
p333
aVIt's incredibly important right now.
p334
aVTrust is not parceled out, as we all know.
p335
aVIt's now about connecting to your communities,
p336
aVconnecting to your social networks.
p337
aVIn my book, I talked about the fact
p338
aVthat 72 percent of people trust what other people say
p339
aVabout a brand or a company,
p340
aVversus 15 percent on advertising.
p341
aVSo in that respect, cooperative consumerism has really taken off.
p342
aVThis is about consumers working together to get what they want
p343
aVout of the marketplace.
p344
aVLet's look at a couple of quick examples.
p345
aa(lp346
VThe artisanal movement is huge:
p347
aVeverything about locally derived products and services,
p348
aVsupporting your local neighborhoods,
p349
aVwhether it's cheeses, wines and other products.
p350
aVAlso this rise of local currencies.
p351
aVRealizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment,
p352
aVyou're doing business with people you trust
p353
aVin your local markets.
p354
aVSo this rise of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon.
p355
aVAnd then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating.
p356
aVThey actually started, in certain communities in the United States,
p357
aVto publish people's electricity usage.
p358
aVAnd what they found out is when that was available for public record,
p359
aVthe people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.
p360
aa(lp361
VThen we also look at the idea of cow-pooling,
p362
aVwhich is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together
p363
aVto buy meat from organic farms, that they know is safe and controlled
p364
aVin the way that they want it to be controlled.
p365
aVAnd then there's this other really interesting movement in California,
p366
aVwhich is about carrot mobs.
p367
aVThe traditional thing would be to boycott, right? Have a stick.
p368
aVWell, why not have a carrot?
p369
aVSo these are consumers organizing, pooling their resources
p370
aVto incentify companies to do good.
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd then we look at what companies can do.
p373
aVThis is all the opportunity about being a community organizer.
p374
aVYou have to realize that you can't fight and control this.
p375
aVYou actually need to organize it.
p376
aVYou need to harness it. You need to give it meaning.
p377
aVAnd there's lots of really interesting examples here.
p378
aVFirst is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of
p379
aVand diversified from rating restaurants,
p380
aVinto actually rating health care.
p381
aVSo what credentials does Zagat's have?
p382
aVWell, they have a lot,
p383
aVbecause it's their network of people.
p384
aVSo that becomes a very powerful force for them
p385
aVto make their brand more elastic.
p386
aa(lp387
VThen you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.
p388
aVThis Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck.
p389
aVIt's a moving truck through L.A.,
p390
aVand the only way you can find it is through Twitter.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VOr you look at
p395
aVJohnson & Johnson's "Momversations," a phenomenal blog that's been built up,
p396
aVwhere J&J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers,
p397
aVallowing them to create a forum where they can communicate and connect.
p398
aVAnd it's also become a very valuable advertising revenue for J&J as well.
p399
aVThis, plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs,
p400
aVfrom Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter,
p401
aVcreating an open environment,
p402
aVallowing their employees to be part of the process,
p403
aVrather than hidden behind walls.
p404
aa(lp405
VYou see this rising force in total transparency and openness
p406
aVthat companies are starting to adopt,
p407
aVall because the consumer is demanding it.
p408
aVSo when we look at this and step back,
p409
aVwhat I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real.
p410
aVIt's been tremendously powerful for consumers.
p411
aVBut at the same time, this is also a tremendous opportunity.
p412
aVThe Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side
p413
aVof the same coin.
p414
aVCrisis equals opportunity.
p415
aVWhat we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them
p416
aVto actually lead us forward out of this recession.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better:
p419
aVit will drive innovation;
p420
aVit will make longer-lasting products;
p421
aVit will create better, more intuitive customer service;
p422
aVand it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies
p423
aVthat share the values that we share.
p424
aVSo when we look back and step out at this
p425
aVand see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data,
p426
aVwe see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.
p427
aa(lp428
VThank you very much.

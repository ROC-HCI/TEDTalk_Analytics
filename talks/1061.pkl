VI was afraid of womanhood.
p7
aVNot that I'm not afraid now,
p8
aVbut I've learned to pretend.
p9
aVI've learned to be flexible.
p10
aVIn fact, I've developed some interesting tools
p11
aVto help me deal with this fear.
p12
aVLet me explain.
p13
aVBack in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up,
p14
aVlittle girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful
p15
aVand pretty and gentle and soft,
p16
aVand we were supposed to fit into roles
p17
aVthat were sort of shadowy \u2014
p18
aVreally not quite clear what we were supposed to be.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VThere were plenty of role models all around us.
p23
aVWe had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters,
p24
aVand of course, the ever-present media
p25
aVbombarding us with images and words,
p26
aVtelling us how to be.
p27
aVNow my mother was different.
p28
aVShe was a homemaker,
p29
aVbut she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,
p30
aVand she didn't buy me pink outfits.
p31
aVInstead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.
p32
aVAnd I just ate it up.
p33
aVI drew, and I drew,
p34
aVand since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family,
p35
aVI could draw, do what I wanted to do,
p36
aVand not have to perform, not have to speak \u2014
p37
aVI was very shy \u2014
p38
aVand I could still get approval.
p39
aVI was launched as a cartoonist.
p40
aVNow when we're young,
p41
aVwe don't always know. We know there are rules out there,
p42
aVbut we don't always know \u2014
p43
aVwe don't perform them right,
p44
aVeven though we are imprinted at birth
p45
aVwith these things,
p46
aVand we're told
p47
aVwhat the most important color in the world is.
p48
aVWe're told what shape we're supposed to be in.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVWe're told what to wear \u2014
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aV\u2014 and how to do our hair \u2014
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aV\u2014 and how to behave.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow the rules that I'm talking about
p57
aVare constantly being monitored by the culture.
p58
aVWe're being corrected,
p59
aVand the primary policemen are women,
p60
aVbecause we are the carriers of the tradition.
p61
aVWe pass it down from generation to generation.
p62
aVNot only that \u2014
p63
aVwe always have this vague notion
p64
aVthat something's expected of us.
p65
aVAnd on top of all off these rules,
p66
aVthey keep changing.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVWe don't know what's going on half the time,
p69
aVso it puts us in a very tenuous position.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VNow if you don't like these rules,
p74
aVand many of us don't \u2014
p75
aVI know I didn't, and I still don't,
p76
aVeven though I follow them half the time,
p77
aVnot quite aware that I'm following them \u2014
p78
aVwhat better way than to change them [than] with humor?
p79
aVHumor relies on the traditions of a society.
p80
aVIt takes what we know, and it twists it.
p81
aVIt takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress,
p82
aVand it makes it unexpected,
p83
aVand that's what elicits a laugh.
p84
aVNow what if you put together women and humor?
p85
aVI think you can get change.
p86
aVBecause women are on the ground floor,
p87
aVand we know the traditions so well,
p88
aVwe can bring a different voice to the table.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow I started drawing
p91
aVin the middle of a lot of chaos.
p92
aVI grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
p93
aVduring the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations,
p94
aVthe Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement,
p95
aVand I think I was drawing,
p96
aVtrying to figure out what was going on.
p97
aVAnd then also my family was in chaos,
p98
aVand I drew to try to bring my family together \u2014
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aV\u2014 try to bring my family together with laughter.
p101
aVIt didn't work.
p102
aVMy parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.
p103
aVBut I found my place.
p104
aVI found that I didn't have to wear high heels,
p105
aVI didn't have to wear pink,
p106
aVand I could feel like I fit in.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow when I was a little older, in my 20s,
p109
aVI realized there are not many women in cartooning.
p110
aVAnd I thought, "Well, maybe I can break
p111
aVthe little glass ceiling of cartooning,"
p112
aVand so I did. I became a cartoonist.
p113
aVAnd then I thought \u2014 in my 40s I started thinking,
p114
aV"Well, why don't I do something?
p115
aVI always loved political cartoons,
p116
aVso why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons
p117
aVto make people think about the stupid rules that we're following
p118
aVas well as laugh?"
p119
aa(lp120
VNow my perspective
p121
aVis a particularly \u2014
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aV\u2014 my perspective is a particularly American perspective.
p124
aVI can't help it. I live here.
p125
aVEven though I've traveled a lot,
p126
aVI still think like an American woman.
p127
aVBut I believe that the rules that I'm talking about
p128
aVare universal, of course \u2014
p129
aVthat each culture has its different codes of behavior
p130
aVand dress and traditions,
p131
aVand each woman has to deal with these same things
p132
aVthat we do here in the U.S.
p133
aVConsequently, we have.
p134
aVWomen, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.
p135
aVWe have amazing antennae.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow my work lately
p138
aVhas been to collaborate with international cartoonists,
p139
aVwhich I so enjoy,
p140
aVand it's given me a greater appreciation
p141
aVfor the power of cartoons
p142
aVto get at the truth,
p143
aVto get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
p144
aVAnd not only that, it can get to the viewer
p145
aVthrough not only the intellect, but through the heart.
p146
aVMy work also has allowed me to collaborate
p147
aVwith women cartoonists from across the world \u2014
p148
aVcountries such as Saudi Arabia,
p149
aVIran, Turkey,
p150
aVArgentina, France \u2014
p151
aVand we have sat together and laughed
p152
aVand talked and shared our difficulties.
p153
aVAnd these women are working so hard to get their voices heard
p154
aVin some very difficult circumstances.
p155
aVBut I feel blessed to be able to work with them.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd we talk about
p158
aVhow women have such strong perceptions,
p159
aVbecause of our tenuous position
p160
aVand our role as tradition-keepers,
p161
aVthat we can have the great potential
p162
aVto be change-agents.
p163
aVAnd I think, I truly believe,
p164
aVthat we can change this thing
p165
aVone laugh at a time.
p166
aa(lp167
VThank you.

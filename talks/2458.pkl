VSo in college,
p5
aVI was a government major,
p6
aVwhich means I had to write a lot of papers.
p7
aVNow, when a normal student writes a paper,
p8
aVthey might spread the work out a little like this.
p9
aVSo, you know \u2014
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
Vyou get started maybe a little slowly,
p14
aVbut you get enough done in the first week
p15
aVthat, with some heavier days later on,
p16
aVeverything gets done, things stay civil.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd I would want to do that like that.
p21
aVThat would be the plan.
p22
aVI would have it all ready to go,
p23
aVbut then, actually, the paper would come along,
p24
aVand then I would kind of do this.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd that would happen every single paper.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut then came my 90-page senior thesis,
p31
aVa paper you're supposed to spend a year on.
p32
aVAnd I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option.
p33
aVIt was way too big a project.
p34
aVSo I planned things out,
p35
aVand I decided I kind of had to go something like this.
p36
aVThis is how the year would go.
p37
aVSo I'd start off light,
p38
aVand I'd bump it up in the middle months,
p39
aVand then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear
p40
aVjust like a little staircase.
p41
aVHow hard could it be to walk up the stairs?
p42
aVNo big deal, right?
p43
aa(lp44
VBut then, the funniest thing happened.
p45
aVThose first few months?
p46
aVThey came and went,
p47
aVand I couldn't quite do stuff.
p48
aVSo we had an awesome new revised plan.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd then \u2014
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VBut then those middle months actually went by,
p57
aVand I didn't really write words,
p58
aVand so we were here.
p59
aVAnd then two months turned into one month,
p60
aVwhich turned into two weeks.
p61
aVAnd one day I woke up
p62
aVwith three days until the deadline,
p63
aVstill not having written a word,
p64
aVand so I did the only thing I could:
p65
aVI wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,
p66
aVpulling not one but two all-nighters \u2014
p67
aVhumans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters \u2014
p68
aVsprinted across campus,
p69
aVdove in slow motion,
p70
aVand got it in just at the deadline.
p71
aa(lp72
VI thought that was the end of everything.
p73
aVBut a week later I get a call,
p74
aVand it's the school.
p75
aVAnd they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"
p76
aVAnd I say, "Yeah."
p77
aVAnd they say, "We need to talk about your thesis."
p78
aVAnd I say, "OK."
p79
aVAnd they say,
p80
aV"It's the best one we've ever seen."
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VThat did not happen.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VIt was a very, very bad thesis.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VI just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought,
p95
aV"This guy is amazing!"
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VNo, no, it was very, very bad.
p100
aVAnyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.
p101
aVI write the blog Wait But Why.
p102
aVAnd a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
p103
aVMy behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me,
p104
aVand I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world
p105
aVwhat goes on in the heads of procrastinators,
p106
aVand why we are the way we are.
p107
aVNow, I had a hypothesis
p108
aVthat the brains of procrastinators were actually different
p109
aVthan the brains of other people.
p110
aVAnd to test this, I found an MRI lab
p111
aVthat actually let me scan both my brain
p112
aVand the brain of a proven non-procrastinator,
p113
aVso I could compare them.
p114
aVI actually brought them here to show you today.
p115
aVI want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.
p116
aVI know that if you're not a trained brain expert,
p117
aVit's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?
p118
aVSo here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VNow ...
p123
aVhere's my brain.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VThere is a difference.
p128
aVBoth brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them,
p129
aVbut the procrastinator's brain
p130
aValso has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
p131
aVNow, what does this mean for the procrastinator?
p132
aVWell, it means everything's fine until this happens.
p133
aa(lp134
V[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]
p135
aa(lp136
VSo the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision
p137
aVto do something productive,
p138
aVbut the Monkey doesn't like that plan,
p139
aVso he actually takes the wheel,
p140
aVand he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page
p141
aVof the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal,
p142
aVbecause I just remembered that that happened.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VThen \u2014
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VThen we're going to go over to the fridge,
p151
aVto see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.
p152
aVAfter that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral
p153
aVthat starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets
p154
aVand ends much, much later with us watching interviews
p155
aVwith Justin Bieber's mom.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
V"All of that's going to take a while,
p160
aVso we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today.
p161
aVSorry!"
p162
aa(lp163
V(Sigh)
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, what is going on here?
p166
aVThe Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy
p167
aVyou want behind the wheel.
p168
aVHe lives entirely in the present moment.
p169
aVHe has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future,
p170
aVand he only cares about two things:
p171
aVeasy and fun.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, in the animal world, that works fine.
p174
aVIf you're a dog
p175
aVand you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things,
p176
aVyou're a huge success!
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd to the Monkey,
p181
aVhumans are just another animal species.
p182
aVYou have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation,
p183
aVwhich in tribal times might have worked OK.
p184
aVBut, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.
p185
aVWe're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.
p186
aVWhich is why we have another guy in our brain,
p187
aVthe Rational Decision-Maker,
p188
aVwho gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.
p189
aVWe can visualize the future.
p190
aVWe can see the big picture.
p191
aVWe can make long-term plans.
p192
aVAnd he wants to take all of that into account.
p193
aVAnd he wants to just have us do
p194
aVwhatever makes sense to be doing right now.
p195
aVNow, sometimes it makes sense
p196
aVto be doing things that are easy and fun,
p197
aVlike when you're having dinner or going to bed
p198
aVor enjoying well-earned leisure time.
p199
aVThat's why there's an overlap.
p200
aVSometimes they agree.
p201
aVBut other times, it makes much more sense
p202
aVto be doing things that are harder and less pleasant,
p203
aVfor the sake of the big picture.
p204
aVAnd that's when we have a conflict.
p205
aVAnd for the procrastinator,
p206
aVthat conflict tends to end a certain way every time,
p207
aVleaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone,
p208
aVan easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.
p209
aVI call it the Dark Playground.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, the Dark Playground is a place
p214
aVthat all of you procrastinators out there know very well.
p215
aVIt's where leisure activities happen
p216
aVat times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.
p217
aVThe fun you have in the Dark Playground
p218
aVisn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned,
p219
aVand the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred \u2014
p220
aVall of those good procrastinator feelings.
p221
aVAnd the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel,
p222
aVhow does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone,
p223
aVa less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?
p224
aa(lp225
VWell, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel,
p226
aVsomeone who's always looking down on him and watching over him
p227
aVin his darkest moments \u2014
p228
aVsomeone called the Panic Monster.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time,
p233
aVbut he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close
p234
aVor there's danger of public embarrassment,
p235
aVa career disaster or some other scary consequence.
p236
aVAnd importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of.
p237
aVNow, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently,
p238
aVbecause the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago
p239
aVand invited me to do a TED Talk.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VNow, of course, I said yes.
p244
aVIt's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
V(Applause)
p249
aVBut in the middle of all this excitement,
p250
aVthe Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.
p251
aVHe was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted?
p252
aVDo we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?
p253
aVWe need to sit down and work on this right now."
p254
aVAnd the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth
p255
aVand zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground,
p256
aVand scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country,
p257
aVso we can get a better feel for India."
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VSo that's what we did that day.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VAs six months turned into four and then two and then one,
p266
aVthe people of TED decided to release the speakers.
p267
aVAnd I opened up the website, and there was my face
p268
aVstaring right back at me.
p269
aVAnd guess who woke up?
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VSo the Panic Monster starts losing his mind,
p274
aVand a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd the Monkey \u2014 remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster \u2014
p279
aVboom, he's up the tree!
p280
aVAnd finally,
p281
aVfinally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel
p282
aVand I can start working on the talk.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, the Panic Monster explains
p285
aVall kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior,
p286
aVlike how someone like me could spend two weeks
p287
aVunable to start the opening sentence of a paper,
p288
aVand then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic
p289
aVto stay up all night and write eight pages.
p290
aVAnd this entire situation, with the three characters \u2014
p291
aVthis is the procrastinator's system.
p292
aVIt's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
p293
aVThis is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.
p294
aa(lp295
VWhen I did, I was amazed by the response.
p296
aVLiterally thousands of emails came in,
p297
aVfrom all different kinds of people from all over the world,
p298
aVdoing all different kinds of things.
p299
aVThese are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers
p300
aVand lots and lots of PhD students.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd they were all writing, saying the same thing:
p305
aV"I have this problem too."
p306
aVBut what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post
p307
aVand the heaviness of these emails.
p308
aVThese people were writing with intense frustration
p309
aVabout what procrastination had done to their lives,
p310
aVabout what this Monkey had done to them.
p311
aVAnd I thought about this, and I said,
p312
aVwell, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?
p313
aVWhy are all of these people in such a dark place?
p314
aa(lp315
VWell, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.
p316
aVEverything I've talked about today, the examples I've given,
p317
aVthey all have deadlines.
p318
aVAnd when there's deadlines,
p319
aVthe effects of procrastination are contained to the short term
p320
aVbecause the Panic Monster gets involved.
p321
aVBut there's a second kind of procrastination
p322
aVthat happens in situations when there is no deadline.
p323
aVSo if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter \u2014
p324
aVsomething in the arts, something entrepreneurial \u2014
p325
aVthere's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening,
p326
aVnot until you've gone out and done the hard work
p327
aVto get momentum, get things going.
p328
aVThere's also all kinds of important things outside of your career
p329
aVthat don't involve any deadlines,
p330
aVlike seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health,
p331
aVworking on your relationship
p332
aVor getting out of a relationship that isn't working.
p333
aa(lp334
VNow if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things
p335
aVis the Panic Monster, that's a problem,
p336
aVbecause in all of these non-deadline situations,
p337
aVthe Panic Monster doesn't show up.
p338
aVHe has nothing to wake up for,
p339
aVso the effects of procrastination, they're not contained;
p340
aVthey just extend outward forever.
p341
aVAnd it's this long-term kind of procrastination
p342
aVthat's much less visible and much less talked about
p343
aVthan the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind.
p344
aVIt's usually suffered quietly and privately.
p345
aVAnd it can be the source
p346
aVof a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.
p347
aVAnd I thought, that's why those people are emailing,
p348
aVand that's why they're in such a bad place.
p349
aVIt's not that they're cramming for some project.
p350
aVIt's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator,
p351
aVat times, in their own lives.
p352
aVThe frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams;
p353
aVit's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany \u2014
p356
aVthat I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
p357
aVThat's right \u2014 I think all of you are procrastinators.
p358
aVNow, you might not all be a mess,
p359
aVlike some of us,
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
Vand some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines,
p364
aVbut remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick
p365
aVis when the deadlines aren't there.
p366
aa(lp367
VNow, I want to show you one last thing.
p368
aVI call this a Life Calendar.
p369
aVThat's one box for every week of a 90-year life.
p370
aVThat's not that many boxes,
p371
aVespecially since we've already used a bunch of those.
p372
aVSo I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.
p373
aVWe need to think about what we're really procrastinating on,
p374
aVbecause everyone is procrastinating on something in life.
p375
aVWe need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
p376
aVThat's a job for all of us.
p377
aVAnd because there's not that many boxes on there,
p378
aVit's a job that should probably start today.
p379
aa(lp380
VWell, maybe not today, but ...
p381
aa(lp382
V(Laughter)
p383
aa(lp384
VYou know.
p385
aVSometime soon.
p386
aa(lp387
VThank you.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Applause)

VAn image is worth more than a thousand words,
p5
aVso I'm going to start my talk
p6
aVby stop talking and show you a few images
p7
aVthat I recently captured.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo by now, my talk is already 6,000 words long,
p10
aVand I feel like I should stop here.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VAt the same time, I probably owe you
p15
aVsome explanation
p16
aVabout the images that you just saw.
p17
aVWhat I am trying to do as a photographer,
p18
aVas an artist, is to bring the world
p19
aVof art and science together.
p20
aVWhether it is an image of a soap bubble
p21
aVcaptured at the very moment where it's bursting,
p22
aVas you can see in this image,
p23
aVwhether it's a universe made of tiny little beads
p24
aVof oil paint,
p25
aVstrange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways,
p26
aVor paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces,
p27
aVI'm always trying to link those two fields together.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhat I find very intriguing about those two
p30
aVis that they both look at the same thing:
p31
aVThey are a response to their surroundings.
p32
aVAnd yet, they do it in a very different way.
p33
aVIf you look at science on one hand,
p34
aVscience is a very rational approach
p35
aVto its surroundings,
p36
aVwhereas art on the other hand
p37
aVis usually an emotional approach to its surroundings.
p38
aVWhat I am trying to do is I'm trying
p39
aVto bring those two views into one
p40
aVso that my images both speak to the viewer's heart
p41
aVbut also to the viewer's brain.
p42
aVLet me demonstrate this based on three projects.
p43
aa(lp44
VThe first one has to do with making sound visible.
p45
aVNow as you may know,
p46
aVsound travels in waves,
p47
aVso if you have a speaker,
p48
aVa speaker actually does nothing else
p49
aVthan taking the audio signal,
p50
aVtransform it into a vibration,
p51
aVwhich is then transported through the air,
p52
aVis captured by our ear,
p53
aVand transformed into an audio signal again.
p54
aVNow I was thinking,
p55
aVhow can I make those sound waves visible?
p56
aVSo I came up with the following setup.
p57
aVI took a speaker, I placed a thin foil
p58
aVof plastic on top of that speaker,
p59
aVand then I added tiny little crystals
p60
aVon top of that speaker.
p61
aVAnd now, if I would play a sound through that speaker,
p62
aVit would cause the crystals to move up and down.
p63
aVNow this happens very fast,
p64
aVin the blink of an eye,
p65
aVso, together with LG, we captured this motion
p66
aVwith a camera that is able
p67
aVto capture more than 3,000 frames per second.
p68
aVLet me show you what this looks like.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Music: "Teardrop" by Massive Attack)
p71
aa(lp72
V(Applause)
p73
aa(lp74
VThank you very much.
p75
aVI agree, it looks pretty amazing.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut I have to tell you a funny story.
p78
aVI got an indoor sunburn doing this
p79
aVwhile shooting in Los Angeles.
p80
aVNow in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn
p81
aVjust on any of the beaches,
p82
aVbut I got mine indoors,
p83
aVand what happened is that,
p84
aVif you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second,
p85
aVyou need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights.
p86
aVSo we had this speaker set up,
p87
aVand we had the camera facing it,
p88
aVand lots of lights pointing at the speaker,
p89
aVand I would set up the speaker,
p90
aVput the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker,
p91
aVand we would do this over and over again,
p92
aVand it was until midday that I realized
p93
aVthat I had a completely red face
p94
aVbecause of the lights pointing at the speaker.
p95
aVWhat was so funny about it was that
p96
aVthe speaker was only coming from the right side,
p97
aVso the right side of my face was completely red
p98
aVand I looked like the Phantom of the Opera
p99
aVfor the rest of the week.
p100
aa(lp101
VLet me now turn to another project
p102
aVwhich involves less harmful substances.
p103
aVHas anyone of you heard of ferrofluid?
p104
aVAh, some of you have. Excellent.
p105
aVShould I skip that part?
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VFerrofluid has a very strange behavior.
p110
aVIt's a liquid that is completely black.
p111
aVIt's got an oily consistency.
p112
aVAnd it's got tiny little particles of metal in it,
p113
aVwhich makes it magnetic.
p114
aVSo if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field,
p115
aVit would change its appearance.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow I've got a live demonstration over here
p118
aVto show this to you.
p119
aVSo I've got a camera pointing down at this plate,
p120
aVand underneath that plate, there is a magnet.
p121
aVNow I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid
p122
aVto that magnet.
p123
aa(lp124
VLet's just slightly move it to the right
p125
aVand maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo what you can see now is that
p128
aVthe ferrofluid has formed spikes.
p129
aVThis is due to the attraction and the repulsion
p130
aVof the individual particles inside the liquid.
p131
aVNow this looks already quite interesting,
p132
aVbut let me now add some watercolors to it.
p133
aVThose are just standard watercolors
p134
aVthat you would paint with.
p135
aVYou wouldn't paint with syringes,
p136
aVbut it works just the same.
p137
aVSo what happened now is,
p138
aVwhen the watercolor was flowing into the structure,
p139
aVthe watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid.
p140
aVThat's because the ferrofluid itself
p141
aVis hydrophobic.
p142
aVThat means it doesn't mix with the water.
p143
aVAnd at the same time, it tries to maintain its position
p144
aVabove the magnet,
p145
aVand therefore, it creates those amazing-looking
p146
aVstructures of channels and tiny little ponds
p147
aVof colorful water paint.
p148
aVSo that was the second project.
p149
aa(lp150
VLet me now turn to the last project,
p151
aVwhich involves
p152
aVthe national beverage of Scotland.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VThis image, and also this one,
p156
aVwere made using whiskey.
p157
aVNow you might ask yourself,
p158
aVhow did he do that?
p159
aVDid he drink half a bottle of whiskey
p160
aVand then draw the hallucination he got
p161
aVfrom being drunk onto paper?
p162
aVI can assure you I was fully conscious
p163
aVwhile I was taking those pictures.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, whiskey contains 40 percent of alcohol,
p166
aVand alcohol has got some very interesting properties.
p167
aVMaybe you have experienced
p168
aVsome of those properties before,
p169
aVbut I am talking about the physical properties,
p170
aVnot the other ones.
p171
aVSo when I open the bottle, the alcohol molecules
p172
aVwould spread in the air,
p173
aVand that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance.
p174
aVAnd at the same time, alcohol is highly flammable.
p175
aVAnd it was with those two properties
p176
aVthat I was able to create the images
p177
aVthat you're seeing right now.
p178
aa(lp179
VLet me demonstrate this over here.
p180
aVAnd what I have here is an empty glass vessel.
p181
aVIt's got nothing in it.
p182
aVAnd now I'm going to fill it with oxygen
p183
aVand whiskey.
p184
aVAdd some more.
p185
aVNow we just wait for a few seconds
p186
aVfor the molecules to spread inside the bottle.
p187
aVAnd now, let's set that on fire.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VSo that's all that happens.
p192
aVIt goes really fast, and it's not that impressive.
p193
aVI could do it again to show it one more time,
p194
aVbut some would argue that this is a complete waste
p195
aVof the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut let me show you a slow motion
p198
aVin a completely darkened room
p199
aVof what I just showed you in this live demonstration.
p200
aVSo what happened is that the flame
p201
aVtraveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom,
p202
aVburning the mix of the air molecules
p203
aVand the alcohol.
p204
aVSo the images that you saw at the beginning,
p205
aVthey are actually a flame stopped in time
p206
aVwhile it is traveling through the bottle,
p207
aVand you have to imagine
p208
aVit was flipped around 180 degrees.
p209
aVSo that's how those images were made.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Applause)
p212
aa(lp213
VThank you.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo, I have now showed you three projects,
p216
aVand you might ask yourself, what is it good for?
p217
aVWhat's the idea behind it?
p218
aVIs it just a waste of whiskey?
p219
aVIs it just some strange materials?
p220
aVThose three projects, they're based on very simple
p221
aVscientific phenomena,
p222
aVsuch as magnetism, the sound waves,
p223
aVor over here, the physical properties of a substance,
p224
aVand what I'm trying to do
p225
aVis I'm trying to use these phenomena
p226
aVand show them in a poetic and unseen way,
p227
aVand therefore invite the viewer
p228
aVto pause for a moment
p229
aVand think about all the beauty
p230
aVthat is constantly surrounding us.
p231
aa(lp232
VThank you very much.
p233
aa(lp234

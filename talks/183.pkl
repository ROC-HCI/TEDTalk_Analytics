VThere's an ancient and universal concept that words have power,
p5
aVthat spells exist,
p6
aVand that if we could only pronounce the right words,
p7
aVthen \u2014 whoosh! \u2014 you know, an avalanche would come
p8
aVand wipe out the hobbits, right?
p9
aVSo this is a very attractive idea,
p10
aVbecause we're very lazy, like the Sorcerer's Apprentice,
p11
aVor the world's greatest computer programmer.
p12
aVThis idea has a lot of traction with us.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe love the idea that words, when pronounced,
p15
aVare little more than pure information,
p16
aVbut they evoke physical action in the real world
p17
aVthat helps us do work.
p18
aVSo, of course, with lots of programmable computers
p19
aVand robots around,
p20
aVthis is an easy thing to picture.
p21
aa(lp22
VHow many of you know what I'm talking about?
p23
aVRaise your right hand.
p24
aVHow many don't know what I'm talking about?
p25
aVRaise your left hand.
p26
aVSo that's great. So that was too easy.
p27
aVYou guys have very insecure computers, OK?
p28
aVSo now the thing is, this is a different kind of spell.
p29
aVThis is a computer program made of zeros and ones.
p30
aVIt can be pronounced on a computer, does something like this.
p31
aVThe important thing is we can write it in a high-level language.
p32
aa(lp33
VA computer magician can write this thing.
p34
aVIt can be compiled into zeros and ones and pronounced by a computer.
p35
aVAnd that's what makes computers powerful,
p36
aVthese high-level languages that can be compiled.
p37
aVAnd so, I'm here to tell you, you don't need a computer
p38
aVto actually have a spell.
p39
aVIn fact, what you can do at the molecular level
p40
aVis that if you encode information \u2014
p41
aVyou encode a spell or program as molecules \u2014
p42
aVthen physics can actually directly interpret that information
p43
aVand run a program.
p44
aa(lp45
VIt's what happens in proteins.
p46
aVWhen this amino-acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms,
p47
aVthese little letters are sticky for each other.
p48
aVIt collapses into a three-dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine
p49
aVthat actually cuts DNA.
p50
aVThe interesting thing is that if you change the sequence,
p51
aVyou change the three-dimensional folding.
p52
aVYou get, now, a DNA stapler, instead.
p53
aVThese are the kind of molecular programs we want to be able to write.
p54
aVThe problem is, we don't know
p55
aVthe machine language of proteins or have a compiler for proteins.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo I've joined a growing band of people
p58
aVthat try to make molecular spells using DNA.
p59
aVWe use DNA because it's cheaper, it's easier to handle,
p60
aVit's something we understand really well \u2014
p61
aVso well, in fact, that we think we can actually write
p62
aVprogramming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo then, we think we can do that.
p65
aVOne of my first questions doing this was:
p66
aVHow can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA?
p67
aVI decided to use a type of DNA origami,
p68
aVwhere you take a long strand of DNA
p69
aVand fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want.
p70
aVSo here's a shape.
p71
aVI actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear, coding,
p72
aVlike Linus [Torvalds], in that picture before.
p73
aVThis program takes a shape and spits out 250 DNA sequences.
p74
aVThese short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand
p75
aVinto this shape that we want to make.
p76
aVSo you send an e-mail with these sequences in it
p77
aVto a company,
p78
aVand the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer,
p79
aVa machine about the size of a photocopier.
p80
aVAnd they take your e-mail,
p81
aVand every letter in your e-mail, they replace with a 30-atom cluster \u2014
p82
aVone for each letter, A, T, C and G in DNA.
p83
aa(lp84
VThey string them up in the right sequence,
p85
aVand then they send them back to you via FedEx.
p86
aVSo you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes.
p87
aVI mix them together, add a little bit of salt water,
p88
aVand then add this long strand I was telling you about,
p89
aVthat I've stolen from a virus.
p90
aVAnd then what happens is,
p91
aVyou heat this whole thing up to about boiling.
p92
aVYou cool it down to room temperature,
p93
aVand as you do, those short strands do the following thing:
p94
aVeach one of them binds that long strand in one place,
p95
aVand then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place,
p96
aVand brings those two parts of the long strand
p97
aVclose together so they stick together.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo the net effect of all 250 of these strands
p100
aVis to fold the long strand into the shape you're looking for.
p101
aVIt'll approximate that shape.
p102
aVWe do this for real, in the test tube.
p103
aVIn each little drop of water, you get 50 billion of these guys.
p104
aVWith a microscope, you can see them on a surface.
p105
aVThe neat thing is if you change the sequence and change the spell,
p106
aVjust change the sequence of the staples,
p107
aVyou can make a molecule that looks like this.
p108
aVAnd, you know, he likes to hang out with his buddies.
p109
aVA lot of them are actually pretty good.
p110
aa(lp111
VIf you change the spell again, you change the sequence again,
p112
aVyou get really nice, 130-nanometer triangles.
p113
aVIf you do it again,
p114
aVyou can get arbitrary patterns.
p115
aVSo on a rectangle, you can paint patterns of North and South America,
p116
aVor the words, "DNA."
p117
aa(lp118
VSo that's DNA origami. That's one way.
p119
aVThere are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA.
p120
aVWhat we really want to do in the end
p121
aVis learn how to program self-assembly so we can build anything, right?
p122
aVWe want to be able to build technological artifacts
p123
aVthat are maybe good for the world.
p124
aVWe want to learn how to build biological artifacts,
p125
aVlike people and whales and trees.
p126
aVAnd if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity,
p127
aVif our ability to program molecules gets to be that good,
p128
aVthen that will truly be magic.
p129
aa(lp130
VThank you very much.

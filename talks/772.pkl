VDoes anybody know when the stethoscope was invented?
p5
aVAny guesses? 1816.
p6
aVAnd what I can say is, in 2016,
p7
aVdoctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes.
p8
aVThere's a whole lot better technology coming,
p9
aVand that's part of the change in medicine.
p10
aa(lp11
VWhat has changed our society
p12
aVhas been wireless devices.
p13
aVBut the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK?
p14
aa(lp15
VSo, let me give you some examples of this
p16
aVto kind of make this much more concrete.
p17
aVThis is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram.
p18
aVAnd, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time
p19
aVa patient, an individual, anywhere in the world
p20
aVon your smartphone,
p21
aVwatching your rhythm \u2014 that's incredible,
p22
aVand it's with us today.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut that's just the beginning.
p25
aVYou check your email while you're sitting here.
p26
aVIn the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs,
p27
aVall your vital signs: your heart rhythm,
p28
aVyour blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.
p29
aVThis is already available today.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis is AirStrip Technologies.
p32
aVIt's now wired \u2014 or I should say, wireless \u2014
p33
aVby taking the aggregate of these signals
p34
aVin the hospital, in the intensive care unit,
p35
aVand putting it on a smartphone for physicians.
p36
aVIf you're an expectant parent,
p37
aVwhat about the ability to monitor, continuously,
p38
aVfetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions,
p39
aVand not having to worry so much that things are
p40
aVfine as the pregnancy,
p41
aVand moving over into the time of delivery?
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd then as we go further,
p44
aVtoday we have continuous glucose sensors.
p45
aVRight now, they are under the skin,
p46
aVbut in the future, they won't have to be implanted.
p47
aVAnd of course, the desired range \u2014 trying to keep glucose
p48
aVbetween 75 and less than 200,
p49
aVchecking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor \u2014
p50
aVyou'll see how that can impact diabetes.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd what about sleep?
p53
aVWe're going to zoom in on that a little bit.
p54
aVWe're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.
p55
aVWhat if, on your phone,
p56
aVwhich will be available in the next few weeks,
p57
aVyou had every minute of your sleep displayed?
p58
aVAnd this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange.
p59
aVThe REM sleep, rapid eye movement,
p60
aVdream state, is in light green;
p61
aVand light is gray, light sleep;
p62
aVand deep sleep, the best restorative sleep,
p63
aVis that dark green.
p64
aa(lp65
VHow about counting every calorie?
p66
aVAnd this is ability, in real time, to actually take
p67
aVmeasurements of caloric intake
p68
aVas well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, what I've talked about are physiologic metrics.
p71
aVBut what I want to get to, the next frontier,
p72
aVvery quickly, and why the stethoscope
p73
aVis on its way out,
p74
aVis because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds,
p75
aVand the breath sounds, because now,
p76
aVintroduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound.
p77
aVWhy is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive.
p78
aVHere is an example of an abdominal ultrasound,
p79
aVand also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless,
p80
aVand then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics \u2014
p83
aVthe key measurements of vital signs,
p84
aVand all those things in physiology \u2014 but also all the imaging
p85
aVthat one could look at in your smartphone.
p86
aVNow, this is an example of another obsolete technology,
p87
aVsoon to be buried: the Holter Monitor.
p88
aVTwenty-four hour recording, lots of wires.
p89
aVThis is now a little tiny patch.
p90
aVYou can put it on for two weeks
p91
aVand send it in the mail.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, how does this work? Well,
p94
aVthere is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors
p95
aVthat one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.
p96
aVAnd this sends a signal
p97
aVand it creates a body area network to a gateway.
p98
aVGateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway,
p99
aVas today many of these things are dedicated gateways,
p100
aVbecause they are not so well integrated.
p101
aVThat signal goes to the web, the cloud,
p102
aVand then it can be processed and sent anywhere:
p103
aVto a caregiver, to a physician,
p104
aVback to the patient, etc.
p105
aVSo, that's basically very simplistic technology
p106
aVof how this works.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow, I have this device on.
p109
aVI didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.
p110
aVThis is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm,
p111
aVas you saw already,
p112
aVbut it also goes well beyond that.
p113
aVThis is me now. And you can see the ECG.
p114
aVBelow that's the actual heart rate and the trend;
p115
aVto the right of that is a bioconductant.
p116
aVThat's the fluid status,
p117
aVfluid status, that's really important
p118
aVif you're monitoring somebody with heart failure.
p119
aVAnd below that's temperature,
p120
aVand respiration, and oxygen,
p121
aVand then the position activity.
p122
aVSo, this is really striking, because this device
p123
aVmeasures seven things
p124
aVthat are very much vital signs
p125
aVfor monitoring someone with heart failure. OK?
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd why is this important? Well,
p128
aVthis is the most expensive bed.
p129
aVWhat if we could reduce the need for hospital beds?
p130
aVWell, we can. First of all, heart failure
p131
aVis the number one reason
p132
aVfor hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.
p133
aVThe cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year,
p134
aVwhich is 80 percent related to hospitalization.
p135
aVAnd in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay
p136
aVfor a Medicare greater than 65 years or older,
p137
aVis \u2014 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days,
p138
aVand by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.
p139
aVSo, can we improve that? Well the idea is
p140
aVwe take this device that I'm wearing,
p141
aVand we put it on 600 patients with heart failure,
p142
aVrandomly assigned, versus 600 patients
p143
aVwho don't have active monitoring,
p144
aVand see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions,
p145
aVand that's exciting. And we'll start that trial,
p146
aVand you'll hear more about how we're going to do that,
p147
aVbut that's a type of wireless device trial
p148
aVthat could change medicine in the years ahead.
p149
aa(lp150
VWhy now? Why has this all of a sudden become
p151
aVa reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine?
p152
aVWhat we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm.
p153
aVThis sets up consumer-driven healthcare.
p154
aVThat's where this is all starting.
p155
aVLet me just give you specifics about why this is
p156
aVa big movement if you're not aware of it:
p157
aV1.2 million Americans
p158
aVhave gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network
p159
aVthat connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod.
p160
aVAnd this Wired Magazine cover article
p161
aVreally captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe
p162
aVand how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology
p163
aVand energy expenditure.
p164
aVHere are some things, the principles
p165
aVthat are guiding principles to keep in mind:
p166
aV"A data-driven health revolution
p167
aVpromises to make us all
p168
aVbetter, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers."
p169
aVAnd this one, which is really telling,
p170
aVthis was from July, this cover article:
p171
aa(lp172
V"The personal metrics movement goes way beyond
p173
aVdiet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet
p174
aVof life, from sleep to mood to pain,
p175
aV24/7/365."
p176
aVWell, I tried this device.
p177
aVA lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life.
p178
aVI didn't have one of those,
p179
aVbut I got the Fitbit.
p180
aVThat looks like this.
p181
aVIt's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer.
p182
aVAnd I want to just give you the results of that testing,
p183
aVbecause I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.
p184
aVI hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better \u2014
p185
aVI hope so.
p186
aVBut this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.
p187
aVHowever you have to put in most of this stuff.
p188
aVThe only thing it really tracks by itself is activity,
p189
aVand even then, it's not complete.
p190
aVSo, you exercise and it picks up the exercise.
p191
aVYou put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI,
p192
aVand of course it tells you how many calories you're expending
p193
aVfrom the exercise, and how many you took in,
p194
aVif you go in and enter all the foods.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut it really wants you to enter all your activity.
p197
aVAnd so I went to this,
p198
aVand of course I was gratified that it picked up
p199
aVthe 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did,
p200
aVbut then it wants more information.
p201
aVSo, it says, "You want to log sexual activity.
p202
aVHow long did you do it for?"
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVAnd it says, "How hard was it?"
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVFurthermore it says, "Start time."
p207
aVNow, this doesn't appear \u2014 this just doesn't work,
p208
aVI mean, this just doesn't work.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo, now I want to move to sleep.
p211
aVWho would ever have thought you could have your own EEG
p212
aVat your home, tagged to a very nice alarm clock, by the way?
p213
aVThis is the headband that goes with this alarm clock.
p214
aVIt monitors your brainwaves continuously, when you're sleeping.
p215
aVSo, I did this thing for seven days
p216
aVgetting ready for TEDMed.
p217
aVThis is an important part of our life, one-third you're supposed to be sleeping.
p218
aa(lp219
VOf course how many here
p220
aVhave any problems with sleeping?
p221
aVIt's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected.
p222
aVOkay, well this was a week of
p223
aVmy life in sleeping,
p224
aVand you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score,
p225
aVyou get a Z.Q. score when you wake up.
p226
aVYou say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score
p227
aVis adjusted to age,
p228
aVand you want to get as high as you possibly can.
p229
aVSo this is the moment-by-moment,
p230
aVor minute-by-minute sleep.
p231
aVAnd you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd.
p232
aVAnd the wake time is in orange.
p233
aVAnd this can be a problem, as I learned.
p234
aVBecause it not only helps you with quantifying
p235
aVyour sleep,
p236
aVbut also tells others you're awake.
p237
aVSo, when my wife came in and she
p238
aVcould tell you're awake.
p239
aV"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk."
p240
aVAnd I'm trying to play possum.
p241
aVThis thing is very, very impressive.
p242
aa(lp243
VOK. So, that's the first night.
p244
aVAnd this one is now 67,
p245
aVand that's not a good score.
p246
aVAnd this tells you, of course, how much you had in REM sleep,
p247
aVin deep sleep, and all this sort of thing.
p248
aVThis was really fascinating because
p249
aVthis gave that quantitation
p250
aVabout all the different phases of sleep.
p251
aVSo, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group.
p252
aVIt's like a managed competition of sleep.
p253
aVAnd really interesting stuff.
p254
aVLook at this thing and say, "Well, I didn't think I was a very good sleeper,
p255
aVbut actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds." OK?
p256
aVAnd the key thing was, what I didn't know,
p257
aVwas that I was a really good dreamer.
p258
aa(lp259
VOK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases.
p260
aVEighty percent of Americans have chronic disease,
p261
aVor 80 percent of age greater than 65 have
p262
aVtwo or more chronic disease,
p263
aV140 million Americans
p264
aVhave one or more chronic disease,
p265
aVand 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion
p266
aVexpenditures are related to chronic disease.
p267
aVNow, diabetes is one of the big ones.
p268
aVAlmost 24 million people have diabetes.
p269
aVAnd here is the latest map. It was published
p270
aVjust a little more than a week ago in the New York Times,
p271
aVand it isn't looking good.
p272
aVThat is, for men, 29 percent
p273
aVin the country over 60 have Type II diabetes,
p274
aVand women, although it's less, it's terribly high.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut of course we have a way to measure that now
p277
aVon a continuous basis,
p278
aVwith a sensor that detects blood glucose,
p279
aVand it's important because we could detect
p280
aVhyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known,
p281
aVand also hypoglycemia.
p282
aVAnd you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case,
p283
aVwere finger sticks, which would have missed both ends.
p284
aa(lp285
VBut by continuous monitoring,
p286
aVit captures all that vital information.
p287
aVThe future of this though,
p288
aVis being able to move this to a Band-Aid type phenomenon,
p289
aVand that's not so far away.
p290
aVSo, let me just give you, very quickly,
p291
aV10 top targets for wireless medicine.
p292
aVAll these things are possible \u2014
p293
aVsome of them are very close,
p294
aVor already, as you heard,
p295
aVare available today, in some way or form.
p296
aa(lp297
VAlzheimer's disease:
p298
aVthere's five million people affected, and you can check
p299
aVvital signs, activity, balance.
p300
aVAsthma: large number, we could detect things like
p301
aVpollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer,
p302
aVI'll show you an example of that real quickly.
p303
aVChronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
p304
aVDepression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders.
p305
aVDiabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension:
p306
aV74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring
p307
aVto come up with much better management and prevention.
p308
aVAnd obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that.
p309
aVAnd sleep disorders.
p310
aa(lp311
VThis is effective around the world. The access to smartphones
p312
aVand cell phones today is extraordinary.
p313
aVAnd this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully
p314
aVabout the opportunities in health across the developing world:
p315
aV"Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people,
p316
aVmore quickly, than any previous technology."
p317
aVAnd that's before we got going on the m-health world.
p318
aVAging: The problem is enormous,
p319
aV300,000 broken hips per year;
p320
aVbut the solutions are extraordinary,
p321
aVand they include so many different things.
p322
aa(lp323
VOne of the ones I just wanted to mention:
p324
aVThe iShoe is another example of a sensor that
p325
aVimproves proprioception among the elderly
p326
aVto prevent falling.
p327
aVOne of many different techniques using wireless sensors.
p328
aVSo, we can change medicine across the continuum of care,
p329
aVacross the ages from premies or unborn children
p330
aVto seniors; the pharmaceutical arena changes;
p331
aVthe full spectrum of disease \u2014 I hope I've given you a sense of that \u2014
p332
aVacross the globe.
p333
aa(lp334
VThere are two things that can really accelerate this whole process.
p335
aVOne of them \u2014 we're very fortunate \u2014 is to develop a dedicated institute
p336
aVand that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ...
p337
aVand then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West,
p338
aVto get behind this wireless health institute.
p339
aVSan Diego is an extraordinary place for this.
p340
aVThere's over 650 wireless companies,
p341
aV100 of which or more are working in wireless health.
p342
aVIt's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly
p343
aVit dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies.
p344
aa(lp345
VThe wireless institute,
p346
aVthe West Wireless Health Institute,
p347
aVis really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people
p348
aVwho are here this evening:
p349
aVGary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this.
p350
aV(Applause)
p351
aVTheir fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible,
p352
aVand this is really a nonprofit education center
p353
aVwhich is just about to open. It looks like this,
p354
aVthis whole building dedicated.
p355
aVAnd what it's trying to do is accelerate this era:
p356
aVto take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate \u2014
p357
aVand we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany,
p358
aVit was announced on Monday \u2014
p359
aVthen to move up with development,
p360
aVclinical trial validation and then changing medical practice,
p361
aVthe most challenging thing of all,
p362
aVrequiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics.
p363
aa(lp364
VThe other big thing, besides having this fantastic
p365
aVinstitute to catalyze this process
p366
aVis guidance,
p367
aVand that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital.
p368
aVIf we understand biology from genomics and omics
p369
aVand wireless through physiologic phenotyping, that's big.
p370
aVBecause what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before.
p371
aVOver 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level,
p372
aVbut this is quite extraordinary: More has been learned about
p373
aVthe underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years
p374
aVthan in the history of man.
p375
aVAnd when you put that together with, for example,
p376
aVnow an app for the iPhone with your genotype
p377
aVto guide drug therapy ...
p378
aVbut, the future \u2014 we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes
p379
aVfrom all the common variants,
p380
aVand that's going to get filled in more
p381
aVwith low-frequency variants in the future.
p382
aVWe can tell who's going to get breast cancer
p383
aVfrom the various genes.
p384
aVWe can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation.
p385
aa(lp386
VAnd finally, another example: sudden cardiac death.
p387
aVEach of these has a sensor.
p388
aVWe can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it.
p389
aVWe can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible,
p390
aVfor breast cancer with an ultrasound device
p391
aVgiven to the patient.
p392
aVAn iPatch, iRhythm, for atrial fibrillation.
p393
aVAnd vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death.
p394
aVWe lose 700,000 people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death.
p395
aa(lp396
VSo, I hope I've convinced you of this,
p397
aVof the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound
p398
aVand then the impact on diseases is equally impressive
p399
aVacross all these different diseases and more.
p400
aVIt's really taking individualized medicine to a new height
p401
aVand it's hyper-innovative,
p402
aVand I think it represents the black swan of medicine.
p403
aVThanks for your attention.

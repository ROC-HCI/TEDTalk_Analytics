VA great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity
p5
aVis to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here,
p6
aVwhat's going on with no difficulty at all.
p7
aVThe best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing,
p8
aVand my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable
p9
aVbut would miss the point.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVHe would have a great time.
p12
aVAnd of course, if you're a speaker here, like Hans Rosling,
p13
aVa speaker finds this complex, tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case,
p14
aVhe had a secret weapon yesterday,
p15
aVliterally, in his sword swallowing act.
p16
aVAnd I must say, I thought of quite a few objects
p17
aVthat I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on,
p18
aVbut he just did it and that was a wonderful thing.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense,
p21
aVbut that we're easily fooled. In fact, what Shakespeare
p22
aVwas pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled,
p23
aVso we're actually looking forward to it.
p24
aVWe go to magic shows in order to be fooled.
p25
aVAnd this makes many things fun, but it makes it difficult to actually
p26
aVget any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd our friend, Betty Edwards,
p29
aVthe "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" lady, shows these two tables
p30
aVto her drawing class and says,
p31
aV"The problem you have with learning to draw
p32
aVis not that you can't move your hand,
p33
aVbut that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.
p34
aVIt's trying to perceive images into objects
p35
aVrather than seeing what's there."
p36
aVAnd to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops
p37
aVis the same, and I'm going to prove it to you."
p38
aVShe does this with cardboard, but since I have
p39
aVan expensive computer here
p40
aVI'll just rotate this little guy around and ...
p41
aVNow having seen that \u2014 and I've seen it hundreds of times,
p42
aVbecause I use this in every talk I give \u2014 I still can't see
p43
aVthat they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure.
p46
aVThey measure very, very carefully.
p47
aVAnd if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge,
p48
aVyou'll see that those two shapes are
p49
aVexactly the same size.
p50
aVAnd the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying,
p51
aV"We see things not as they are, but as we are."
p52
aVI certainly would like to know what happened to the person
p53
aVwho had that insight back then,
p54
aVif they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are,
p57
aVthen what we call reality is a kind of hallucination
p58
aVhappening inside here. It's a waking dream,
p59
aVand understanding that that is what we actually exist in
p60
aVis one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.
p61
aVAnd what that means: "simple and understandable"
p62
aVmight not be actually simple or understandable,
p63
aVand things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.
p64
aVSomehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.
p65
aVWe can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel.
p66
aVThe way I think of it is, we can't learn to see
p67
aVuntil we admit we're blind.
p68
aVOnce you start down at this very humble level,
p69
aVthen you can start finding ways to see things.
p70
aVAnd what's happened, over the last 400 years in particular,
p71
aVis that human beings have invented "brainlets" \u2014
p72
aVlittle additional parts for our brain \u2014
p73
aVmade out of powerful ideas that help us
p74
aVsee the world in different ways.
p75
aVAnd these are in the form of sensory apparatus \u2014
p76
aVtelescopes, microscopes \u2014 reasoning apparatus \u2014
p77
aVvarious ways of thinking \u2014 and, most importantly,
p78
aVin the ability to change perspective on things.
p79
aa(lp80
VI'll talk about that a little bit.
p81
aVIt's this change in perspective
p82
aVon what it is we think we're perceiving
p83
aVthat has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years
p84
aVthan we have in the rest of human history.
p85
aVAnd yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo one of the things that goes from simple to complex
p88
aVis when we do more. We like more.
p89
aVIf we do more in a kind of a stupid way,
p90
aVthe simplicity gets complex
p91
aVand, in fact, we can keep on doing it for a very long time.
p92
aVBut Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties;
p93
aVanother name for them could be "architecture"
p94
aVas a metaphor for taking the same old material
p95
aVand thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it.
p96
aVAnd in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature \u2014
p97
aVof having the descriptions
p98
aVat various levels be rather similar \u2014
p99
aVall goes down to the idea that the elementary particles
p100
aVare both sticky and standoffish,
p101
aVand they're in violent motion.
p102
aVThose three things give rise to all the different levels
p103
aVof what seem to be complexity in our world.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut how simple?
p106
aVSo, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago,
p107
aVI just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen
p108
aVin conveying complex ideas simply.
p109
aVBut then I had a thought of, "Boy, maybe it's too simple."
p110
aVAnd I put some effort in to try and check
p111
aVto see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time
p112
aVactually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side,
p113
aVand I found that they matched up very well.
p114
aVSo the Roslings have been able to do simplicity
p115
aVwithout removing what's important about the data.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhereas the film yesterday that we saw
p118
aVof the simulation of the inside of a cell,
p119
aVas a former molecular biologist, I didn't like that at all.
p120
aVNot because it wasn't beautiful or anything,
p121
aVbut because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand
p122
aVabout molecular biology, and that is:
p123
aVwhy is there any probability at all of two complex shapes
p124
aVfinding each other just the right way
p125
aVso they combine together and be catalyzed?
p126
aVAnd what we saw yesterday was
p127
aVevery reaction was fortuitous;
p128
aVthey just swooped in the air and bound, and something happened.
p129
aVBut in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of
p130
aVabout a million revolutions per second;
p131
aVthey're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds;
p132
aVthey're completely crowded together, they're jammed,
p133
aVthey're bashing up against each other.
p134
aVAnd if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff,
p135
aVwhat happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous,
p136
aVand I think that's exactly the wrong image
p137
aVfor when you're trying to teach science.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo, another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication
p140
aVwith the actual understanding of some principle.
p141
aVSo a kid who's 14 in high school
p142
aVgets this version of the Pythagorean theorem,
p143
aVwhich is a truly subtle and interesting proof,
p144
aVbut in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics.
p145
aVSo a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math,
p146
aVis something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this:
p147
aVso here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with
p148
aVthree more triangles and we copy that,
p149
aVnotice that we can move those triangles down like this.
p150
aVAnd that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
p151
aVand bingo. That is all you have to do.
p152
aVAnd this kind of proof is the kind of proof
p153
aVthat you need to learn when you're learning mathematics
p154
aVin order to get an idea of what it means
p155
aVbefore you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs
p156
aVof Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow let's go to young children.
p159
aVThis is a very unusual teacher
p160
aVwho was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher,
p161
aVbut was a natural mathematician.
p162
aVSo she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music
p163
aVbut is a terrific musician;
p164
aVshe just had a feeling for math.
p165
aVAnd here are her six-year-olds,
p166
aVand she's got them making shapes out of a shape.
p167
aVSo they pick a shape they like \u2014 like a diamond, or a square,
p168
aVor a triangle, or a trapezoid \u2014 and then they try and make
p169
aVthe next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape.
p170
aVYou can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd what this teacher did on every project
p173
aVwas to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project,
p174
aVand then something like science.
p175
aVSo they had created these artifacts.
p176
aVNow she had them look at them and do this ... laborious,
p177
aVwhich I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was
p178
aVto slow them down so they'll think.
p179
aVSo they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here
p180
aVand pasting them up.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut the whole point of this thing is
p183
aVfor them to look at this chart and fill it out.
p184
aV"What have you noticed about what you did?"
p185
aVAnd so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one,
p186
aVand the second one took three more
p187
aVand the total was four on that one,
p188
aVthe third one took five more and the total was nine on that one,
p189
aVand then the next one.
p190
aVShe saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add
p191
aVaround the edges was always going to grow by two,
p192
aVso she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.
p193
aVAnd she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six,
p194
aVwhere she wasn't sure what six times six was
p195
aVand what seven times seven was,
p196
aVbut then she was confident again.
p197
aVSo that's what Lauren did.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd then the teacher, Gillian Ishijima, had the kids
p200
aVbring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor,
p201
aVand everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!"
p202
aVNo matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same.
p203
aVAnd the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd
p204
aVwill recognize these two progressions
p205
aVas a first-order discrete differential equation
p206
aVand a second-order discrete differential equation,
p207
aVderived by six-year-olds.
p208
aVWell, that's pretty amazing.
p209
aVThat isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this.
p212
aVAnd so the first idea here is
p213
aVjust to show you the kind of things that children do.
p214
aVI'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.
p215
aVSo I'd like to draw a little car here \u2014
p216
aVI'll just do this very quickly \u2014 and put a big tire on him.
p217
aVAnd I get a little object here and I can look inside this object,
p218
aVI'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior: car forward.
p219
aVEach time I click it, car turn.
p220
aVIf I want to make a little script to do this over and over again,
p221
aVI just drag these guys out and set them going.
p222
aVAnd I can try steering the car here by ...
p223
aVSee the car turn by five here?
p224
aVSo what if I click this down to zero?
p225
aVIt goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.
p226
aVMake it go in the other direction.
p227
aVBut of course, that's a little bit like kissing your sister
p228
aVas far as driving a car,
p229
aVso the kids want to do a steering wheel;
p230
aVso they draw a steering wheel.
p231
aVAnd we'll call this a wheel.
p232
aVSee this wheel's heading here?
p233
aVIf I turn this wheel, you can see that number over there going minus and positive.
p234
aVThat's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of
p235
aVthose numbers coming out there
p236
aVand to just drop it into the script here,
p237
aVand now I can steer the car with the steering wheel.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd it's interesting.
p240
aVYou know how much trouble the children have with variables,
p241
aVbut by learning it this way, in a situated fashion,
p242
aVthey never forget from this single trial
p243
aVwhat a variable is and how to use it.
p244
aVAnd we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.
p245
aVSo if you look at the little script here,
p246
aVthe speed is always going to be 30.
p247
aVWe're going to move the car according to that over and over again.
p248
aVAnd I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things;
p249
aVthey're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart.
p250
aVAnd what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did
p251
aVof saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time,
p252
aVand then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time?
p253
aVWhat do I get there?"
p254
aVWe get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo how do the children do science?
p257
aa(lp258
V(Video) Teacher: [Choose] objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time.
p259
aa(lp260
VStudent 1: Ooh, this is nice.
p261
aa(lp262
VTeacher: Do not pay any attention
p263
aVto what anybody else is doing.
p264
aVWho's got the apple?
p265
aa(lp266
VAlan Kay: They've got little stopwatches.
p267
aVStudent 2: What did you get? What did you get?
p268
aVAK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough.
p269
aa(lp270
VStudent 3: 0.99 seconds.
p271
aa(lp272
VTeacher: So put "sponge ball" ...
p273
aa(lp274
VStudent 4l: [I decided to] do the shot put and the sponge ball
p275
aVbecause they're two totally different weights,
p276
aVand if you drop them at the same time,
p277
aVmaybe they'll drop at the same speed.
p278
aa(lp279
VTeacher: Drop. Class: Whoa!
p280
aa(lp281
VAK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child
p282
aVabout this particular point
p283
aVbecause, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment,
p284
aVand neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.
p285
aVAnd it was not until Galileo actually did it
p286
aVthat an adult thought like a child,
p287
aVonly 400 years ago.
p288
aVWe get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids
p289
aVwho will actually cut straight to the chase.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, what if we want to look at this more closely?
p292
aVWe can take a movie of what's going on,
p293
aVbut even if we single stepped this movie,
p294
aVit's tricky to see what's going on.
p295
aVAnd so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side
p296
aVor stack them up.
p297
aVSo when the children see this, they say, "Ah! Acceleration,"
p298
aVremembering back four months when they did their cars sideways,
p299
aVand they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is.
p300
aVSo what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image
p301
aVto the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later,
p302
aVlike that. And they're getting faster and faster each time,
p303
aVand if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase
p304
aVin the speed is constant.
p305
aVAnd they say, "Oh, yeah. Constant acceleration.
p306
aVWe've done that already."
p307
aVAnd how shall we look and verify that we actually have it?
p308
aVSo you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there,
p309
aVbut if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time,
p310
aVwe can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model.
p311
aa(lp312
VGalileo, by the way, did this very cleverly
p313
aVby running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute.
p314
aVI pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that
p315
aVthis is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story,
p316
aVbut it's a great story.
p317
aVAnd I thought I would do just one thing
p318
aVon the $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here.
p319
aVSo once you have gravity, here's this \u2014
p320
aVincrease the speed by something,
p321
aVincrease the ship's speed.
p322
aVIf I start the little game here that the kids have done,
p323
aVit'll crash the space ship.
p324
aVBut if I oppose gravity, here we go ... Oops!
p325
aV(Laughter)
p326
aVOne more.
p327
aVYeah, there we go. Yeah, OK?
p328
aa(lp329
VI guess the best way to end this is with two quotes:
p330
aVMarshall McLuhan said,
p331
aV"Children are the messages that we send to the future,"
p332
aVbut in fact, if you think of it,
p333
aVchildren are the future we send to the future.
p334
aVForget about messages;
p335
aVchildren are the future,
p336
aVand children in the first and second world
p337
aVand, most especially, in the third world
p338
aVneed mentors.
p339
aVAnd this summer, we're going to build five million of these $100 laptops,
p340
aVand maybe 50 million next year.
p341
aVBut we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life.
p342
aVThat means that we, once again, have a thing where we can put technology out,
p343
aVbut the mentoring that is required to go
p344
aVfrom a simple new iChat instant messaging system
p345
aVto something with depth is missing.
p346
aVI believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface,
p347
aVand this new kind of user interface could be done
p348
aVwith an expenditure of about 100 million dollars.
p349
aVIt sounds like a lot, but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq \u2014
p350
aVwe're spending 8 billion dollars a month; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars \u2014
p351
aVso this is actually cheap.
p352
aVAnd Einstein said,
p353
aV"Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."
p354
aVThank you.

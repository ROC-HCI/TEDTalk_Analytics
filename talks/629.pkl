VToday I want to talk to you about
p5
aVswimming across the North Pole,
p6
aVacross the most northern place in the whole world.
p7
aVAnd perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.
p8
aVHe was a great storyteller.
p9
aVHe could tell a story about an event,
p10
aVand so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.
p11
aVAnd one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy
p12
aVwas of the first British atomic bomb test.
p13
aVHe had been there and watched it go off.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd he said that the explosion was so loud
p16
aVand the light was so intense,
p17
aVthat he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.
p18
aVAnd he said that he could actually see an x-ray
p19
aVof his fingers,
p20
aVbecause the light was so bright.
p21
aVAnd I know that watching that atomic bomb going off
p22
aVhad a very, very big impact on my late father.
p23
aVEvery holiday I had as a young boy
p24
aVwas in a national park.
p25
aVWhat he was trying to do with me was to inspire me
p26
aVto protect the world,
p27
aVand show me just how fragile the world is.
p28
aa(lp29
VHe also told me about the great explorers.
p30
aVHe loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott
p31
aVwalking all the way to the South Pole
p32
aVand Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.
p33
aVAnd so ever since I think I was just six years old,
p34
aVI dreamed of going to the polar regions.
p35
aVI really, really wanted to go to the Arctic.
p36
aVThere was something about that place
p37
aVwhich drew me to it.
p38
aVAnd, well, sometimes it takes a long time
p39
aVfor a dream to come true.
p40
aVBut seven years ago, I went to the Arctic
p41
aVfor the first time.
p42
aVAnd it was so beautiful that I've been back there
p43
aVever since, for the last seven years.
p44
aVI love the place.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut I have seen that place change
p47
aVbeyond all description,
p48
aVjust in that short period of time.
p49
aVI have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice
p50
aVin search of food.
p51
aVI have swum in front of glaciers
p52
aVwhich have retreated so much.
p53
aVAnd I have also, every year,
p54
aVseen less and less sea ice.
p55
aVAnd I wanted the world to know what was happening up there.
p56
aa(lp57
VIn the two years before my swim,
p58
aV23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover
p59
aVjust melted away.
p60
aVAnd I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders
p61
aVto get them to understand what is happening.
p62
aVSo I decided to do this symbolic swim
p63
aVat the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over,
p64
aVbut which now is rapidly unfreezing.
p65
aVAnd the message was very clear:
p66
aVClimate change is for real,
p67
aVand we need to do something about it.
p68
aVAnd we need to do something about it right now.
p69
aa(lp70
VWell, swimming across the North Pole,
p71
aVit's not an ordinary thing to do.
p72
aVI mean, just to put it in perspective,
p73
aV27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.
p74
aVThis morning, the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.
p75
aVThe passengers who fell off the Titanic
p76
aVfell into water of just five degrees centigrade.
p77
aVFresh water freezes at zero.
p78
aVAnd the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.
p79
aVIt's fucking freezing.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aV(Applause)
p82
aVI'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd so I had to assemble an incredible team around me
p86
aVto help me with this task.
p87
aVI assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations.
p88
aVSome people think that swimming is a very solo sport,
p89
aVyou just dive into the sea and off you go.
p90
aVIt couldn't be further from the truth for me.
p91
aVAnd I then went and did a huge amount of training,
p92
aVswimming in icy water, backwards and forwards.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut the most important thing was to train my mind
p95
aVto prepare myself for what was going to happen.
p96
aVAnd I had to visualize the swim.
p97
aVI had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.
p98
aVI had to taste the salt water in my mouth.
p99
aVI had to see my coach screaming for me,
p100
aV"Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!"
p101
aVAnd so I literally swam across the North Pole
p102
aVhundreds and hundreds of times in my mind.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd then, after a year of training, I felt ready.
p105
aVI felt confident that I could actually
p106
aVdo this swim.
p107
aVSo myself and the five members of the team,
p108
aVwe hitched a ride on an icebreaker
p109
aVwhich was going to the North Pole.
p110
aVAnd on day four, we decided to just do a quick
p111
aVfive minute test swim.
p112
aVI had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before,
p113
aVbecause it's just impossible to train
p114
aVin those types of conditions.
p115
aVSo we stopped the ship, as you do.
p116
aVWe all got down onto the ice,
p117
aVand I then got into my swimming costume
p118
aVand I dived into the sea.
p119
aa(lp120
VI have never in my life felt anything
p121
aVlike that moment.
p122
aVI could barely breathe. I was gasping for air.
p123
aVI was hyperventilating so much,
p124
aVand within seconds my hands were numb.
p125
aVAnd it was \u2014 the paradox is
p126
aVthat you're in freezing cold water,
p127
aVbut actually you're on fire.
p128
aVI swam as hard as I could for five minutes.
p129
aVI remember just trying to get out of the water.
p130
aVI climbed out of the ice.
p131
aVAnd I remember taking the goggles off my face
p132
aVand looking down at my hands in sheer shock,
p133
aVbecause my fingers
p134
aVhad swollen so much that they were like sausages.
p135
aVAnd they were swollen so much, I couldn't even close them.
p136
aa(lp137
VWhat had happened is that we are made partially of water,
p138
aVand when water freezes it expands.
p139
aVAnd so what had actually happened is
p140
aVthat the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.
p141
aVAnd they had burst. And I was in so much agony.
p142
aVI immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd I remember standing underneath the hot shower
p145
aVand trying to defrost my fingers.
p146
aVAnd I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole.
p147
aVI was going to try and do a 20-minute swim,
p148
aVfor one kilometer across the North Pole.
p149
aVAnd this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy
p150
aVwith my father, was just going out the window.
p151
aVThere is no possibility that this was going to happen.
p152
aVAnd I remember then getting out of the shower
p153
aVand realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.
p154
aVAnd for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands
p155
aVbecause you need to be able to grab the water
p156
aVand pull it through with you.
p157
aa(lp158
VThe next morning, I woke up
p159
aVand I was in such a state of depression,
p160
aVand all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.
p161
aVFor those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer.
p162
aVA number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole.
p163
aVHe accidentally fell through the ice into the sea.
p164
aVAnd after just three minutes in that water,
p165
aVhe was able
p166
aVto get himself out.
p167
aVAnd his hands were so badly frostbitten
p168
aVthat he had to return to England.
p169
aVHe went to a local hospital and there they said,
p170
aV"Ran, there is no possibility
p171
aVof us being able to save these fingers.
p172
aVWe are going to actually have to take them off."
p173
aVAnd Ran decided to go into his tool shed
p174
aVand take out a saw
p175
aVand do it himself.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd all I could think of was, if that happened to Ran after three minutes,
p178
aVand I can't feel my hands after five minutes,
p179
aVwhat on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes?
p180
aVAt the very best, I'm going to end up losing some fingers.
p181
aVAnd at worst, I didn't even want to think about it.
p182
aVWe carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking,
p185
aVand he came up to me and he said, "Lewis,
p186
aVI've known you since you were 18 years old.
p187
aVI've known you, and I know, Lewis,
p188
aVdeep down, right deep down here,
p189
aVthat you are going to make this swim.
p190
aVI so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training.
p191
aVAnd I realize the reason why you're going to do this.
p192
aVThis is such an important swim.
p193
aVWe stand at a very, very important moment in this history,
p194
aVand you're going to make a symbolic swim here
p195
aVto try to shake the lapels of world leaders.
p196
aVLewis, have the courage to go in there,
p197
aVbecause we are going to look after you every moment of it."
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that,
p200
aVbecause he knew me so well.
p201
aVSo we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole.
p202
aVAnd we stopped the ship,
p203
aVand it was just as the scientists had predicted.
p204
aVThere were open patches of sea everywhere.
p205
aVAnd I went down into my cabin
p206
aVand I put on my swimming costume.
p207
aVAnd then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor,
p208
aVwhich measures my core body temperature
p209
aVand my heart rate.
p210
aVAnd then we walked out onto the ice.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd I remember looking into the ice,
p213
aVand there were big chunks of white ice in there,
p214
aVand the water was completely black.
p215
aVI had never seen black water before.
p216
aVAnd it is 4,200 meters deep.
p217
aVAnd I said to myself, "Lewis, don't look left, don't look right.
p218
aVJust scuttle forward and go for it."
p219
aVAnd so I now want to show you a short video
p220
aVof what happened there on the ice.
p221
aa(lp222
VNarrator (Video): We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage
p223
aVwhen one can have a bit of a wobble mentally.
p224
aVEverything just looks so gray around here,
p225
aVand looks so cold.
p226
aVWe've just seen our first polar bears.
p227
aVIt was absolutely magical.
p228
aVA mother and a cub, such a beautiful sight.
p229
aVAnd to think that in 30, 40 years
p230
aVthey could become extinct.
p231
aVIt's a very frightening, very, very frightening thought.
p232
aVWe're finally at the North Pole. This is
p233
aVmonths and months and months of dreaming to get here,
p234
aVyears of training and planning and preparation.
p235
aVOoh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim.
p236
aVIt's all a little bit frightening,
p237
aVand emotional.
p238
aVAmundson, you ready? Amudson: Ready.
p239
aVLewis Pugh: Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim.
p240
aVTake the goggles off. Take the goggles off!
p241
aa(lp242
VMan: Take the shoes. Take the shoes.
p243
aVWell done lad! You did it! You did it Lewis!
p244
aVYou did it! You did it man!
p245
aa(lp246
VLP: How on earth did we do that?
p247
aa(lp248
VMan: Against the current! You did it against the current!
p249
aa(lp250
V(Applause)
p251
aa(lp252
VLP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
p253
aV(Applause)
p254
aVThank you so much.
p255
aa(lp256
VAudience: Encore!
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VLP: I'd just like to end off by just saying this:
p260
aVIt took me four months again to feel my hands.
p261
aVBut was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was.
p262
aVThere are very, very few people who don't know now
p263
aVabout what is happening in the Arctic.
p264
aVAnd people ask me, "Lewis, what can we do about climate change?"
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd I say to them,
p267
aVI think we need to do three things.
p268
aVThe first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down
p269
aVinto manageable chunks.
p270
aVYou saw during that video all those flags.
p271
aVThose flags represented the countries
p272
aVfrom which my team came from.
p273
aVAnd equally, when it comes to climate change,
p274
aVevery single country is going to have to make cuts.
p275
aVBritain, America, Japan,
p276
aVSouth Africa, the Congo.
p277
aVAll of us together, we're all on the same ship together.
p278
aa(lp279
VThe second thing we need to do is
p280
aVwe need to just look back
p281
aVat how far we have come
p282
aVin such a short period of time.
p283
aVI remember, just a few years ago, speaking about climate change,
p284
aVand people heckling me in the back
p285
aVand saying it doesn't even exist.
p286
aVI've just come back from giving a series of speeches
p287
aVin some of the poorest townships in South Africa
p288
aVto young children as young as 10 years old.
p289
aVFour or five children sitting behind a desk,
p290
aVand even in those poorest conditions,
p291
aVthey all have a very, very good grasp
p292
aVof climate change.
p293
aa(lp294
VWe need to believe in ourselves.
p295
aVNow is the time to believe.
p296
aVWe've come a long way. We're doing good.
p297
aVBut the most important thing we must do
p298
aVis, I think, we must all walk to the end of our lives
p299
aVand turn around, and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.
p300
aVAnd that is, "What type of world do we want to live in,
p301
aVand what decision are we going to make today
p302
aVto ensure that we all live
p303
aVin a sustainable world?"
p304
aVLadies and gentlemen, thank you very, very much.
p305
aV(Applause)

In 2006, he swam the drought-stricken Thames; also that year he became the first swimmer to do a long-distance swim in all five oceans of the world. The following year, he made the first long-distance swim across the North Pole -- where climate change made the ice temporarily disappear. Heading into the second decade of his swimming career, he&#39;s regarded as the greatest cold-water swimmer in history. <br /><br />His swims have given him a sea-level view of our planet, and inspired him to do his bit to help preserve it. He left a career in maritime law to become a public speaker on environmental issues with his group, Polar Defence Project -- and of course to plan more astonishing swims and treks. In September 2008, Pugh and Robbie Hedgus kayaked across the Arctic Ocean into the polar ice pack, to raise awareness of the thinning sea ice and the dangers of climate change in the Arctic and across the world. And at the end of May 2010 he swam 1 kilometer across Pumori, a meltwater lake situated next to the Khumbu Glacier on Mount Everest, at an altitude of 5300 meters, to draw attention to the melting of the Asian glaciers. He completed the swim -- the highest any person has undertaken -- in less than 23 minutes. &quot;Glaciers are not just ice: they are a lifeline, they provide water to 2 billion people, and we need to protect them,&quot; he says. </p>", "slug": "lewis_pugh", "whotheyare": "Pushing his body through epic cold-water swims, Lewis Gordon Pugh wants to draw attention to our global climate.

"<p>Lewis Gordon Pugh loves to pioneer new swimming routes around or between landmarks once thought unswimmable. In 2006, he swam the drought-stricken Thames; also that year he became the first swimmer to do a long-distance swim in all five oceans of the world. The following year, he made the first long-distance swim across the North Pole -- where climate change made the ice temporarily disappear. Heading into the second decade of his swimming career, he&#39;s regarded as the greatest cold-water swimmer in history. <br /><br />His swims have given him a sea-level view of our planet, and inspired him to do his bit to help preserve it. He left a career in maritime law to become a public speaker on environmental issues with his group, Polar Defence Project -- and of course to plan more astonishing swims and treks. In September 2008, Pugh and Robbie Hedgus kayaked across the Arctic Ocean into the polar ice pack, to raise awareness of the thinning sea ice and the dangers of climate change in the Arctic and across the world. And at the end of May 2010 he swam 1 kilometer across Pumori, a meltwater lake situated next to the Khumbu Glacier on Mount Everest, at an altitude of 5300 meters, to draw attention to the melting of the Asian glaciers. He completed the swim -- the highest any person has undertaken -- in less than 23 minutes. &quot;Glaciers are not just ice: they are a lifeline, they provide water to 2 billion people, and we need to protect them,&quot; he says. </p>", "slug": "lewis_pugh", "whotheyare": "Pushing his body through epic cold-water swims, Lewis Gordon Pugh wants to draw attention to our global climate.

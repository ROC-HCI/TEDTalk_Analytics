VI'm here today, as June said,
p5
aVto talk about a project
p6
aVthat my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.
p7
aVWe're crocheting a coral reef.
p8
aVAnd it's a project that we've actually
p9
aVbeen now joined by hundreds of people around the world,
p10
aVwho are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people
p11
aVhave actually been involved in this project,
p12
aVin many of its different aspects.
p13
aVIt's a project that now reaches across three continents,
p14
aVand its roots go into the fields of mathematics,
p15
aVmarine biology, feminine handicraft
p16
aVand environmental activism.
p17
aVIt's true.
p18
aVIt's also a project
p19
aVthat in a very beautiful way,
p20
aVthe development of this
p21
aVhas actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth,
p22
aVwhich is a particularly lovely thing to be saying
p23
aVright here in February 2009 \u2014
p24
aVwhich, as one of our previous speakers told us,
p25
aVis the 200th anniversary
p26
aVof the birth of Charles Darwin.
p27
aa(lp28
VAll of this I'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes, I hope.
p29
aVBut let me first begin by showing you
p30
aVsome pictures of what this thing looks like.
p31
aVJust to give you an idea of scale,
p32
aVthat installation there is about six feet across,
p33
aVand the tallest models are about two or three feet high.
p34
aVThis is some more images of it.
p35
aVThat one on the right is about five feet high.
p36
aVThe work involves hundreds of different crochet models.
p37
aVAnd indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people
p38
aVhave contributed all over the world as part of this.
p39
aVThe totality of this project
p40
aVinvolves tens of thousands of hours
p41
aVof human labor \u2014
p42
aV99 percent of it done by women.
p43
aVOn the right hand side, that bit there is part of an installation
p44
aVthat is about 12 feet long.
p45
aa(lp46
VMy sister and I started this project in 2005
p47
aVbecause in that year, at least in the science press,
p48
aVthere was a lot of talk about global warming,
p49
aVand the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs.
p50
aVCorals are very delicate organisms,
p51
aVand they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures.
p52
aVIt causes these vast bleaching events
p53
aVthat are the first signs of corals of being sick.
p54
aVAnd if the bleaching doesn't go away \u2014
p55
aVif the temperatures don't go down \u2014 reefs start to die.
p56
aVA great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef,
p57
aVparticularly in coral reefs all over the world.
p58
aVThis is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef.
p59
aa(lp60
VWe have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring,
p61
aVwhich is a little organization we started
p62
aVto promote, to do projects about the
p63
aVaesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics.
p64
aVAnd I went and put a little announcement up on our site,
p65
aVasking for people to join us in this enterprise.
p66
aVTo our surprise, one of the first people who called
p67
aVwas the Andy Warhol Museum.
p68
aVAnd they said they were having an exhibition
p69
aVabout artists' response to global warming,
p70
aVand they'd like our coral reef to be part of it.
p71
aVI laughed and said, "Well we've only just started it,
p72
aVyou can have a little bit of it."
p73
aVSo in 2007 we had an exhibition,
p74
aVa small exhibition of this crochet reef.
p75
aVAnd then some people in Chicago came along and they said,
p76
aV"In late 2007, the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is
p77
aVglobal warming. And we've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery
p78
aVand we want you to fill it with your reef."
p79
aVAnd I, naively by this stage, said, "Oh, yes, sure."
p80
aVNow I say "naively" because actually
p81
aVmy profession is as a science writer.
p82
aVWhat I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics.
p83
aVI've written books about the history of space,
p84
aVthe history of physics and religion,
p85
aVand I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times.
p86
aVSo I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.
p87
aVSo I said yes to this proposition.
p88
aVAnd I went home, and I told my sister Christine.
p89
aVAnd she nearly had a fit
p90
aVbecause Christine is a professor at one of
p91
aVL.A.'s major art colleges, CalArts,
p92
aVand she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.
p93
aVShe thought I'd gone off my head.
p94
aVBut she went into crochet overdrive.
p95
aVAnd to cut a long story short, eight months later
p96
aVwe did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's
p97
aV3,000 square foot gallery.
p98
aa(lp99
VBy this stage the project had taken on
p100
aVa viral dimension of its own,
p101
aVwhich got completely beyond us.
p102
aVThe people in Chicago decided
p103
aVthat as well as exhibiting our reefs, what they wanted to do
p104
aVwas have the local people there make a reef.
p105
aVSo we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures.
p106
aVAnd the people in Chicago made a reef of their own.
p107
aVAnd it was exhibited alongside ours.
p108
aVThere were hundreds of people involved in that.
p109
aVWe got invited to do the whole thing
p110
aVin New York, and in London,
p111
aVand in Los Angeles.
p112
aVIn each of these cities, the local citizens,
p113
aVhundreds and hundreds of them, have made a reef.
p114
aVAnd more and more people get involved in this,
p115
aVmost of whom we've never met.
p116
aVSo the whole thing has sort of morphed
p117
aVinto this organic, ever-evolving creature,
p118
aVthat's actually gone way beyond Christine and I.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow some of you are sitting here thinking,
p121
aV"What planet are these people on?
p122
aVWhy on earth are you crocheting a reef?
p123
aVWoolenness and wetness aren't exactly
p124
aVtwo concepts that go together.
p125
aVWhy not chisel a coral reef out of marble?
p126
aVCast it in bronze."
p127
aVBut it turns out there is a very good reason
p128
aVwhy we are crocheting it
p129
aVbecause many organisms in coral reefs
p130
aVhave a very particular kind of structure.
p131
aVThe frilly crenulated forms that you see
p132
aVin corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs,
p133
aVis a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry.
p134
aVAnd the only way that mathematicians know
p135
aVhow to model this structure
p136
aVis with crochet. It happens to be a fact.
p137
aVIt's almost impossible to model this structure any other way,
p138
aVand it's almost impossible to do it on computers.
p139
aVSo what is this hyperbolic geometry
p140
aVthat corals and sea slugs embody?
p141
aa(lp142
VThe next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up
p143
aVto the level of a sea slug.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVThis sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics
p146
aVwhen it was first discovered in the 19th century.
p147
aVBut not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand
p148
aVhow they could model it.
p149
aVIn 1997 a mathematician
p150
aVat Cornell, Daina Taimina,
p151
aVmade the discovery that this structure
p152
aVcould actually be done in knitting and crochet.
p153
aVThe first one she did was knitting.
p154
aVBut you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized
p155
aVcrochet was the better thing.
p156
aVBut what she was doing was actually making a model
p157
aVof a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians
p158
aVhad thought it was actually impossible to model.
p159
aVAnd indeed they thought that anything like this structure
p160
aVwas impossible per se.
p161
aVSome of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years
p162
aVtrying to prove that this structure was impossible.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo what is this impossible hyperbolic structure?
p165
aVBefore hyperbolic geometry, mathematicians knew
p166
aVabout two kinds of space:
p167
aVEuclidean space, and spherical space.
p168
aVAnd they have different properties.
p169
aVMathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist.
p170
aVYou all have a sense of what a flat space is, Euclidean space is.
p171
aVBut mathematicians formalize this in a particular way.
p172
aVAnd what they do is, they do it through the concept
p173
aVof parallel lines.
p174
aVSo here we have a line and a point outside the line.
p175
aVAnd Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines?
p176
aVI ask the question, how many lines can I draw through
p177
aVthe point but never meet the original line?"
p178
aVAnd you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out?
p179
aVOne. Great. Okay.
p180
aVThat's our definition of a parallel line.
p181
aVIt's a definition really of Euclidean space.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut there is another possibility that you all know of:
p184
aVspherical space.
p185
aVThink of the surface of a sphere \u2014
p186
aVjust like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth.
p187
aVI have a straight line on my spherical surface.
p188
aVAnd I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines
p189
aVcan I draw through the point
p190
aVbut never meet the original line?
p191
aVWhat do we mean to talk about
p192
aVa straight line on a curved surface?
p193
aVNow mathematicians have answered that question.
p194
aVThey've understood there is a generalized concept
p195
aVof straightness, it's called a geodesic.
p196
aVAnd on the surface of a sphere,
p197
aVa straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw.
p198
aVSo it's like the equator or the lines of longitude.
p199
aVSo we ask the question again,
p200
aV"How many straight lines can I draw through the point,
p201
aVbut never meet the original line?"
p202
aVDoes someone want to guess?
p203
aVZero. Very good.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow mathematicians thought that was the only alternative.
p206
aVIt's a bit suspicious isn't it? There is two answers to the question so far,
p207
aVZero and one.
p208
aVTwo answers? There may possibly be a third alternative.
p209
aVTo a mathematician if there are two answers,
p210
aVand the first two are zero and one,
p211
aVthere is another number that immediately suggests itself
p212
aVas the third alternative.
p213
aVDoes anyone want to guess what it is?
p214
aVInfinity. You all got it right. Exactly.
p215
aVThere is, there's a third alternative.
p216
aVThis is what it looks like.
p217
aVThere's a straight line, and there is an infinite number of lines
p218
aVthat go through the point and never meet the original line.
p219
aVThis is the drawing.
p220
aVThis nearly drove mathematicians bonkers
p221
aVbecause, like you, they're sitting there feeling bamboozled.
p222
aVThinking, how can that be? You're cheating. The lines are curved.
p223
aVBut that's only because I'm projecting it onto a
p224
aVflat surface.
p225
aVMathematicians for several hundred years
p226
aVhad to really struggle with this.
p227
aVHow could they see this?
p228
aVWhat did it mean to actually have a physical model
p229
aVthat looked like this?
p230
aa(lp231
VIt's a bit like this: imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space.
p232
aVThen our mathematicians come along
p233
aVand said, "There's this thing called a sphere,
p234
aVand the lines come together at the north and south pole."
p235
aVBut you don't know what a sphere looks like.
p236
aVAnd someone that comes along and says, "Look here's a ball."
p237
aVAnd you go, "Ah! I can see it. I can feel it.
p238
aVI can touch it. I can play with it."
p239
aVAnd that's exactly what happened
p240
aVwhen Daina Taimina
p241
aVin 1997, showed that you could crochet models
p242
aVin hyperbolic space.
p243
aVHere is this diagram in crochetness.
p244
aVI've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface.
p245
aVAnd the lines look curved.
p246
aVBut look, I can prove to you that they're straight
p247
aVbecause I can take any one of these lines,
p248
aVand I can fold along it.
p249
aVAnd it's a straight line.
p250
aVSo here, in wool,
p251
aVthrough a domestic feminine art,
p252
aVis the proof that the most famous postulate
p253
aVin mathematics is wrong.
p254
aV(Applause)
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd you can stitch all sorts of mathematical
p257
aVtheorems onto these surfaces.
p258
aVThe discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics
p259
aVthat is called non-Euclidean geometry.
p260
aVAnd this is actually the field of mathematics
p261
aVthat underlies general relativity
p262
aVand is actually ultimately going to show us
p263
aVabout the shape of the universe.
p264
aVSo there is this direct line
p265
aVbetween feminine handicraft,
p266
aVEuclid and general relativity.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.
p269
aVHere's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate \u2014
p270
aVdidn't know it was impossible to violate,
p271
aVand they're simply getting on with it.
p272
aVThey've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.
p273
aVI once asked the mathematicians why it was
p274
aVthat mathematicians thought this structure was impossible
p275
aVwhen sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age.
p276
aVTheir answer was interesting.
p277
aVThey said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians
p278
aVsitting around looking at sea slugs."
p279
aVAnd that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.
p280
aVIt also says a whole lot of things
p281
aVabout what mathematicians thought mathematics was,
p282
aVwhat they thought it could and couldn't do,
p283
aVwhat they thought it could and couldn't represent.
p284
aVEven mathematicians, who in some sense
p285
aVare the freest of all thinkers,
p286
aVliterally couldn't see
p287
aVnot only the sea slugs around them,
p288
aVbut the lettuce on their plate \u2014
p289
aVbecause lettuces, and all those curly vegetables,
p290
aVthey also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry.
p291
aVAnd so in some sense they literally,
p292
aVthey had such a symbolic view of mathematics,
p293
aVthey couldn't actually see what was going on
p294
aVon the lettuce in front of them.
p295
aVIt turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd so, too, we've discovered
p298
aVthat there is an infinite taxonomy
p299
aVof crochet hyperbolic creatures.
p300
aVWe started out, Chrissy and I and our contributors,
p301
aVdoing the simple mathematically perfect models.
p302
aVBut we found that when we deviated from the specific
p303
aVsetness of the mathematical code
p304
aVthat underlies it \u2014 the simple algorithm
p305
aVcrochet three, increase one \u2014
p306
aVwhen we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code,
p307
aVthe models immediately started to look more natural.
p308
aVAnd all of our contributors, who are an amazing
p309
aVcollection of people around the world,
p310
aVdo their own embellishments.
p311
aVAs it were, we have this ever-evolving,
p312
aVcrochet taxonomic tree of life.
p313
aVJust as the morphology
p314
aVand the complexity of life on earth is never ending,
p315
aVlittle embellishments and complexifications
p316
aVin the DNA code
p317
aVlead to new things like giraffes, or orchids \u2014
p318
aVso too, do little embellishments in the crochet code
p319
aVlead to new and wondrous creatures
p320
aVin the evolutionary tree of crochet life.
p321
aVSo this project really has
p322
aVtaken on this inner organic life of its own.
p323
aVThere is the totality of all the people who have come to it.
p324
aVAnd their individual visions,
p325
aVand their engagement with this mathematical mode.
p326
aa(lp327
VWe have these technologies. We use them.
p328
aVBut why? What's at stake here? What does it matter?
p329
aVFor Chrissy and I, one of the things that's important here
p330
aVis that these things suggest
p331
aVthe importance and value of embodied knowledge.
p332
aVWe live in a society
p333
aVthat completely tends to valorize
p334
aVsymbolic forms of representation \u2014
p335
aValgebraic representations,
p336
aVequations, codes.
p337
aVWe live in a society that's obsessed
p338
aVwith presenting information in this way,
p339
aVteaching information in this way.
p340
aVBut through this sort of modality,
p341
aVcrochet, other plastic forms of play \u2014
p342
aVpeople can be engaged with the most abstract,
p343
aVhigh-powered, theoretical ideas,
p344
aVthe kinds of ideas that normally you have to go
p345
aVto university departments to study in higher mathematics,
p346
aVwhich is where I first learned about hyperbolic space.
p347
aVBut you can do it through playing with material objects.
p348
aVOne of the ways that we've come to think about this
p349
aVis that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring
p350
aVand projects like this, we're trying to have
p351
aVkindergarten for grown-ups.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd kindergarten was actually a very formalized
p354
aVsystem of education,
p355
aVestablished by a man named Friedrich Froebel,
p356
aVwho was a crystallographer in the 19th century.
p357
aVHe believed that the crystal was the model
p358
aVfor all kinds of representation.
p359
aVHe developed a radical alternative system
p360
aVof engaging the smallest children
p361
aVwith the most abstract ideas
p362
aVthrough physical forms of play.
p363
aVAnd he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right.
p364
aVThe value of education
p365
aVis something that Froebel championed,
p366
aVthrough plastic modes of play.
p367
aa(lp368
VWe live in a society now
p369
aVwhere we have lots of think tanks,
p370
aVwhere great minds go to think about the world.
p371
aVThey write these great symbolic treatises
p372
aVcalled books, and papers,
p373
aVand op-ed articles.
p374
aVWe want to propose, Chrissy and I,
p375
aVthrough The Institute for Figuring, another alternative way of doing things,
p376
aVwhich is the play tank.
p377
aVAnd the play tank, like the think tank,
p378
aVis a place where people can go
p379
aVand engage with great ideas.
p380
aVBut what we want to propose,
p381
aVis that the highest levels of abstraction,
p382
aVthings like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. \u2014
p383
aVall of this can be engaged with,
p384
aVnot just through purely cerebral algebraic
p385
aVsymbolic methods,
p386
aVbut by literally, physically playing with ideas.
p387
aVThank you very much.
p388

V(Video) Newscaster: There's a large path of destruction here in town.
p5
aV... pulling trees from the ground, shattering windows,
p6
aVtaking the roofs off of homes ...
p7
aa(lp8
VCaitria O'Neill: That was me
p9
aVin front of our house in Monson, Massachusetts last June.
p10
aVAfter an EF3 tornado ripped straight through our town
p11
aVand took parts of our roof off,
p12
aVI decided to stay in Massachusetts,
p13
aVinstead of pursuing the master's program
p14
aVI had moved my boxes home that afternoon for.
p15
aa(lp16
VMorgan O'Neill: So, on June 1, we weren't disaster experts,
p17
aVbut on June 3, we started faking it.
p18
aVThis experience changed our lives,
p19
aVand now we're trying to change the experience.
p20
aa(lp21
VCO: So, tornadoes don't happen in Massachusetts,
p22
aVand I was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill.
p23
aVAfter a lamppost flew by, my family and I sprinted into the basement.
p24
aVTrees were thrown against the house, the windows exploded.
p25
aVWhen we finally got out the back door,
p26
aVtransformers were burning in the street.
p27
aa(lp28
VMO: I was here in Boston.
p29
aVI'm a PhD student at MIT,
p30
aVand I happen to study atmospheric science.
p31
aVActually, it gets weirder \u2014
p32
aVI was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit,
p33
aVplaying with the tornado display \u2014
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
Vso I missed her call.
p38
aVI get a call from Caitria, hear the news, and start tracking the radar online
p39
aVto call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area.
p40
aVI drove home late that night with batteries and ice.
p41
aVWe live across the street from a historic church
p42
aVthat had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm.
p43
aVIt had become a community gathering place overnight.
p44
aVThe town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits,
p45
aVand so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church.
p46
aa(lp47
VCO: We walked to the church because we heard they had hot meals,
p48
aVbut when we arrived, we found problems.
p49
aVThere were a couple large, sweaty men with chainsaws
p50
aVstanding in the center of the church, but nobody knew where to send them
p51
aVbecause no one knew the extent of the damage yet.
p52
aVAs we watched, they became frustrated and left
p53
aVto go find somebody to help on their own.
p54
aa(lp55
VMO: So we started organizing. Why? It had to be done.
p56
aVWe found Pastor Bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure.
p57
aVAnd then, armed with just two laptops and one air card,
p58
aVwe built a recovery machine.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VCO: That was a tornado, and everyone's heading to the church
p63
aVto drop things off and volunteer.
p64
aa(lp65
VMO: Everyone's donating clothing.
p66
aVWe should inventory the donations piling up here.
p67
aa(lp68
VCO: And we need a hotline. Can you make a Google Voice number?
p69
aa(lp70
VMO: Sure. And we need to tell people what not to bring.
p71
aVI'll make a Facebook account. Can you print flyers?
p72
aa(lp73
VCO: Yeah, but we don't even know what houses are accepting help.
p74
aVWe need to canvas and send out volunteers.
p75
aa(lp76
VMO: We need to tell people what not to bring.
p77
aVHey, there's a news truck. I'll tell them.
p78
aVCO: You got my number off the news? We don't need more freezers!
p79
aa(lp80
V(Together) MO: Insurance won't cover it? CO: Juice boxes coming in an hour?
p81
aVTogether: Someone get me Post-its!
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VCO: And then the rest of the community figured out that we had answers.
p86
aa(lp87
VMO: I can donate three water heaters, but someone needs to come pick them up.
p88
aa(lp89
VCO: My car is in my living room!
p90
aa(lp91
VMO: My boyscout troop would like to rebuild 12 mailboxes.
p92
aa(lp93
VCO: My puppy is missing and insurance doesn't cover chimneys.
p94
aa(lp95
VMO: My church group of 50 would like housing and meals for a week
p96
aVwhile we repair properties.
p97
aa(lp98
VCO: You sent me to that place on Washington Street yesterday,
p99
aVand now I'm covered in poison ivy.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VSo this is what filled our days.
p104
aVWe had to learn how to answer questions quickly
p105
aVand to solve problems in a minute or less;
p106
aVotherwise, something more urgent would come up,
p107
aVand it wouldn't get done.
p108
aa(lp109
VMO: We didn't get our authority from the board of selectmen
p110
aVor the emergency management director or the United Way.
p111
aVWe just started answering questions and making decisions
p112
aVbecause someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 had to.
p113
aVAnd why not me? I'm a campaign organizer.
p114
aVI'm good at Facebook.
p115
aVAnd there's two of me.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VCO: The point is, if there's a flood or a fire or a hurricane,
p120
aVyou, or somebody like you,
p121
aVare going to step up and start organizing things.
p122
aVThe other point is that it is hard.
p123
aa(lp124
VMO: Lying on the ground after another 17-hour day,
p125
aVCaitria and I would empty our pockets
p126
aVand try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context \u2014
p127
aVall bits of information that had to be remembered and matched
p128
aVin order to help someone.
p129
aVAfter another day and a shower at the shelter,
p130
aVwe realized it shouldn't be this hard.
p131
aa(lp132
VCO: In a country like ours where we breathe Wi-Fi,
p133
aVleveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no-brainer.
p134
aVSystems like the ones that we were creating on the fly
p135
aVcould exist ahead of time.
p136
aVAnd if some community member is in this organizing position
p137
aVin every area after every disaster,
p138
aVthese tools should exist.
p139
aa(lp140
VMO: So, we decided to build them:
p141
aVa recovery in a box, something that could be deployed after every disaster
p142
aVby any local organizer.
p143
aa(lp144
VCO: I decided to stay in the country, give up the master's in Moscow
p145
aVand to work full-time to make this happen.
p146
aVIn the course of the past year,
p147
aVwe've become experts in the field of community-powered disaster recovery.
p148
aVAnd there are three main problems that we've observed
p149
aVwith the way things work currently.
p150
aa(lp151
VMO: The tools.
p152
aa(lp153
VLarge aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear
p154
aVafter a disaster,
p155
aVbut they often fulfill very specific missions, and then they leave.
p156
aVThis leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers,
p157
aVthousands of donations,
p158
aVand all with no training and no tools.
p159
aVSo they use Post-its or Excel or Facebook.
p160
aVBut none of these tools allow you to value high-priority information
p161
aVamidst all of the photos and well-wishes.
p162
aa(lp163
VCO: The timing.
p164
aVDisaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign.
p165
aVIn a political campaign, you start with no interest
p166
aVand no capacity to turn that into action.
p167
aVYou build both gradually,
p168
aVuntil a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election.
p169
aVIn a disaster, however, you start with all of the interest
p170
aVand none of the capacity.
p171
aVAnd you've only got about seven days
p172
aVto capture 50 percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made
p173
aVto help your area.
p174
aVThen some sporting event happens,
p175
aVand you've got only the resources that you've collected thus far
p176
aVto meet the next five years of recovery needs.
p177
aa(lp178
VThis is the slide for Katrina.
p179
aVThis is the curve for Joplin.
p180
aVAnd this is the curve for the Dallas tornadoes in April,
p181
aVwhere we deployed software.
p182
aVThere's a gap here.
p183
aVAffected households have to wait for the insurance adjuster to visit
p184
aVbefore they can start accepting help on their properties.
p185
aVAnd you've only got about four days of interest in Dallas.
p186
aa(lp187
VMO: Data.
p188
aVData is inherently unsexy,
p189
aVbut it can jump-start an area's recovery.
p190
aVFEMA and the state will pay 85 percent of the cost
p191
aVof a federally-declared disaster,
p192
aVleaving the town to pay the last 15 percent of the bill.
p193
aVNow that expense can be huge,
p194
aVbut if the town can mobilize X amount of volunteers for Y hours,
p195
aVthe dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town's contribution.
p196
aVBut who knows that?
p197
aVNow try to imagine the sinking feeling you get
p198
aVwhen you've just sent out 2,000 volunteers and you can't prove it.
p199
aa(lp200
VCO: These are three problems with a common solution.
p201
aVIf we can get the right tools at the right time
p202
aVto the people who will inevitably step up
p203
aVand start putting their communities back together,
p204
aVwe can create new standards in disaster recovery.
p205
aa(lp206
VMO: We needed canvasing tools, donations databasing,
p207
aVneeds reporting, remote volunteer access,
p208
aVall in an easy-to-use website.
p209
aa(lp210
VCO: And we needed help.
p211
aVAlvin, our software engineer and co-founder, has built these tools.
p212
aVChris and Bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships.
p213
aVAnd we've been flying into disaster areas since this past January,
p214
aVsetting up software, training residents
p215
aVand licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters.
p216
aa(lp217
VMO: One of our first launches was after the Dallas tornadoes
p218
aVthis past April.
p219
aVWe flew into a town that had a static, outdated website
p220
aVand a frenetic Facebook feed, trying to structure the response,
p221
aVand we launched our platform.
p222
aVAll of the interest came in the first four days,
p223
aVbut by the time they lost the news cycle,
p224
aVthat's when the needs came in,
p225
aVyet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give
p226
aVand they've been able to meet the needs of their residents.
p227
aa(lp228
VCO: So it's working, but it could be better.
p229
aVEmergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery
p230
aVbecause it makes towns safer and more resilient.
p231
aVImagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place
p232
aVbefore a disaster.
p233
aVSo that's what we're working on.
p234
aVWe're working on getting the software to places so people expect it,
p235
aVso people know how to use it
p236
aVand so it can be filled ahead of time
p237
aVwith that micro-information that drives recovery.
p238
aa(lp239
VMO: It's not rocket science.
p240
aVThese tools are obvious and people want them.
p241
aVIn our hometown, we trained a half-dozen residents
p242
aVto run these Web tools on their own,
p243
aVbecause Caitria and I live here, in Boston.
p244
aVThey took to it immediately, and now they are forces of nature.
p245
aVThere are over three volunteer groups working almost every day,
p246
aVand have been since June 1 of last year,
p247
aVto make sure these residents get what they need and get back in their homes.
p248
aVThey have hotlines and spreadsheets and data.
p249
aa(lp250
VCO: And that makes a difference.
p251
aVJune 1 this year marked the one-year anniversary of the Monson tornado,
p252
aVand our community's never been more connected or more empowered.
p253
aVWe've been able to see the same transformation in Texas and in Alabama.
p254
aVBecause it doesn't take Harvard or MIT
p255
aVto fly in and fix problems after a disaster;
p256
aVit takes a local.
p257
aVNo matter how good an aid organization is at what they do,
p258
aVthey eventually have to go home.
p259
aVBut if you give locals the tools,
p260
aVif you show them what they can do to recover,
p261
aVthey become experts.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Applause)
p264
aa(lp265
VMO: All right. Let's go.
p266
aa(lp267

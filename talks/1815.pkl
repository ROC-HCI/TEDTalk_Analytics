VI have a confession to make.
p5
aVBut first, I want you to make a little confession to me.
p6
aVIn the past year, I want you to just raise your hand
p7
aVif you've experienced relatively little stress.
p8
aVAnyone?
p9
aa(lp10
VHow about a moderate amount of stress?
p11
aa(lp12
VWho has experienced a lot of stress?
p13
aVYeah. Me too.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut that is not my confession.
p16
aVMy confession is this:
p17
aVI am a health psychologist,
p18
aVand my mission is to help people be happier and healthier.
p19
aVBut I fear that something I've been teaching
p20
aVfor the last 10 years is doing more harm than good,
p21
aVand it has to do with stress.
p22
aVFor years I've been telling people, stress makes you sick.
p23
aVIt increases the risk of everything from the common cold
p24
aVto cardiovascular disease.
p25
aVBasically, I've turned stress into the enemy.
p26
aVBut I have changed my mind about stress,
p27
aVand today, I want to change yours.
p28
aa(lp29
VLet me start with the study that made me rethink
p30
aVmy whole approach to stress.
p31
aVThis study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years,
p32
aVand they started by asking people,
p33
aV"How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"
p34
aVThey also asked,
p35
aV"Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?"
p36
aVAnd then they used public death records to find out who died.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VOkay.
p41
aVSome bad news first.
p42
aVPeople who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year
p43
aVhad a 43 percent increased risk of dying.
p44
aVBut that was only true for the people
p45
aVwho also believed that stress is harmful for your health.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VPeople who experienced a lot of stress
p50
aVbut did not view stress as harmful
p51
aVwere no more likely to die.
p52
aVIn fact, they had the lowest risk of dying
p53
aVof anyone in the study,
p54
aVincluding people who had relatively little stress.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow the researchers estimated that over the eight years
p57
aVthey were tracking deaths,
p58
aV182,000 Americans died prematurely,
p59
aVnot from stress,
p60
aVbut from the belief that stress is bad for you.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VThat is over 20,000 deaths a year.
p65
aVNow, if that estimate is correct,
p66
aVthat would make believing stress is bad for you
p67
aVthe 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year,
p68
aVkilling more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VYou can see why this study freaked me out.
p73
aVHere I've been spending so much energy telling people
p74
aVstress is bad for your health.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo this study got me wondering:
p77
aVCan changing how you think about stress make you healthier?
p78
aVAnd here the science says yes.
p79
aVWhen you change your mind about stress,
p80
aVyou can change your body's response to stress.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow to explain how this works,
p83
aVI want you all to pretend that you are participants
p84
aVin a study designed to stress you out.
p85
aVIt's called the social stress test.
p86
aVYou come into the laboratory,
p87
aVand you're told you have to give
p88
aVa five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses
p89
aVto a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you,
p90
aVand to make sure you feel the pressure,
p91
aVthere are bright lights and a camera in your face,
p92
aVkind of like this.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd the evaluators have been trained
p97
aVto give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback,
p98
aVlike this.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Exhales)
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VNow that you're sufficiently demoralized,
p105
aVtime for part two: a math test.
p106
aVAnd unbeknownst to you,
p107
aVthe experimenter has been trained to harass you during it.
p108
aVNow we're going to all do this together.
p109
aVIt's going to be fun.
p110
aVFor me.
p111
aa(lp112
VOkay.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VI want you all to count backwards from 996
p117
aVin increments of seven.
p118
aVYou're going to do this out loud,
p119
aVas fast as you can,
p120
aVstarting with 996.
p121
aVGo!
p122
aa(lp123
V(Audience counting)
p124
aa(lp125
VGo faster. Faster please.
p126
aVYou're going too slow.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Audience counting)
p129
aa(lp130
VStop. Stop, stop, stop.
p131
aVThat guy made a mistake.
p132
aVWe are going to have to start all over again.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VYou're not very good at this, are you?
p137
aVOkay, so you get the idea.
p138
aVIf you were actually in this study,
p139
aVyou'd probably be a little stressed out.
p140
aVYour heart might be pounding,
p141
aVyou might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat.
p142
aVAnd normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety
p143
aVor signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut what if you viewed them instead
p146
aVas signs that your body was energized,
p147
aVwas preparing you to meet this challenge?
p148
aVNow that is exactly what participants were told
p149
aVin a study conducted at Harvard University.
p150
aVBefore they went through the social stress test,
p151
aVthey were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.
p152
aVThat pounding heart is preparing you for action.
p153
aVIf you're breathing faster, it's no problem.
p154
aVIt's getting more oxygen to your brain.
p155
aVAnd participants who learned to view the stress response
p156
aVas helpful for their performance,
p157
aVwell, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident,
p158
aVbut the most fascinating finding to me
p159
aVwas how their physical stress response changed.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow, in a typical stress response,
p162
aVyour heart rate goes up,
p163
aVand your blood vessels constrict like this.
p164
aVAnd this is one of the reasons that chronic stress
p165
aVis sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease.
p166
aVIt's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.
p167
aVBut in the study,
p168
aVwhen participants viewed their stress response as helpful,
p169
aVtheir blood vessels stayed relaxed like this.
p170
aVTheir heart was still pounding,
p171
aVbut this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile.
p172
aVIt actually looks a lot like what happens
p173
aVin moments of joy and courage.
p174
aVOver a lifetime of stressful experiences,
p175
aVthis one biological change
p176
aVcould be the difference
p177
aVbetween a stress-induced heart attack at age 50
p178
aVand living well into your 90s.
p179
aVAnd this is really what the new science of stress reveals,
p180
aVthat how you think about stress matters.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo my goal as a health psychologist has changed.
p183
aVI no longer want to get rid of your stress.
p184
aVI want to make you better at stress.
p185
aVAnd we just did a little intervention.
p186
aVIf you raised your hand and said
p187
aVyou'd had a lot of stress in the last year,
p188
aVwe could have saved your life,
p189
aVbecause hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress,
p190
aVyou're going to remember this talk
p191
aVand you're going to think to yourself,
p192
aVthis is my body helping me rise to this challenge.
p193
aVAnd when you view stress in that way,
p194
aVyour body believes you,
p195
aVand your stress response becomes healthier.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress
p198
aVto redeem myself from,
p199
aVso we are going to do one more intervention.
p200
aVI want to tell you
p201
aVabout one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the stress response,
p202
aVand the idea is this:
p203
aVStress makes you social.
p204
aa(lp205
VTo understand this side of stress,
p206
aVwe need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,
p207
aVand I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get.
p208
aVIt even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone,
p209
aVbecause it's released when you hug someone.
p210
aVBut this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in.
p211
aa(lp212
VOxytocin is a neuro-hormone.
p213
aVIt fine-tunes your brain's social instincts.
p214
aVIt primes you to do things
p215
aVthat strengthen close relationships.
p216
aVOxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family.
p217
aVIt enhances your empathy.
p218
aVIt even makes you more willing to help and support
p219
aVthe people you care about.
p220
aVSome people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin...
p221
aVto become more compassionate and caring.
p222
aVBut here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.
p223
aVIt's a stress hormone.
p224
aVYour pituitary gland pumps this stuff out
p225
aVas part of the stress response.
p226
aVIt's as much a part of your stress response
p227
aVas the adrenaline that makes your heart pound.
p228
aVAnd when oxytocin is released in the stress response,
p229
aVit is motivating you to seek support.
p230
aVYour biological stress response
p231
aVis nudging you to tell someone how you feel,
p232
aVinstead of bottling it up.
p233
aVYour stress response wants to make sure you notice
p234
aVwhen someone else in your life is struggling
p235
aVso that you can support each other.
p236
aVWhen life is difficult,
p237
aVyour stress response wants you to be surrounded
p238
aVby people who care about you.
p239
aa(lp240
VOkay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier?
p241
aVWell, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.
p242
aVIt also acts on your body,
p243
aVand one of its main roles in your body
p244
aVis to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress.
p245
aVIt's a natural anti-inflammatory.
p246
aVIt also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.
p247
aVBut my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart.
p248
aVYour heart has receptors for this hormone,
p249
aVand oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate
p250
aVand heal from any stress-induced damage.
p251
aVThis stress hormone strengthens your heart.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits
p254
aVof oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support.
p255
aVSo when you reach out to others under stress,
p256
aVeither to seek support or to help someone else,
p257
aVyou release more of this hormone,
p258
aVyour stress response becomes healthier,
p259
aVand you actually recover faster from stress.
p260
aVI find this amazing,
p261
aVthat your stress response has a built-in mechanism
p262
aVfor stress resilience,
p263
aVand that mechanism is human connection.
p264
aa(lp265
VI want to finish by telling you about one more study.
p266
aVAnd listen up, because this study could also save a life.
p267
aVThis study tracked about 1,000 adults in the United States,
p268
aVand they ranged in age from 34 to 93,
p269
aVand they started the study by asking,
p270
aV"How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"
p271
aVThey also asked,
p272
aV"How much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors,
p273
aVpeople in your community?"
p274
aVAnd then they used public records for the next five years
p275
aVto find out who died.
p276
aa(lp277
VOkay, so the bad news first:
p278
aVFor every major stressful life experience,
p279
aVlike financial difficulties or family crisis,
p280
aVthat increased the risk of dying by 30 percent.
p281
aVBut \u2014 and I hope you are expecting a "but" by now \u2014
p282
aVbut that wasn't true for everyone.
p283
aVPeople who spent time caring for others
p284
aVshowed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying.
p285
aVZero.
p286
aVCaring created resilience.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd so we see once again
p289
aVthat the harmful effects of stress on your health
p290
aVare not inevitable.
p291
aVHow you think and how you act
p292
aVcan transform your experience of stress.
p293
aVWhen you choose to view your stress response as helpful,
p294
aVyou create the biology of courage.
p295
aVAnd when you choose to connect with others under stress,
p296
aVyou can create resilience.
p297
aVNow I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life,
p298
aVbut this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress.
p299
aVStress gives us access to our hearts.
p300
aVThe compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning
p301
aVin connecting with others,
p302
aVand yes, your pounding physical heart,
p303
aVworking so hard to give you strength and energy.
p304
aVAnd when you choose to view stress in this way,
p305
aVyou're not just getting better at stress,
p306
aVyou're actually making a pretty profound statement.
p307
aVYou're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges.
p308
aVAnd you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VChris Anderson: This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us.
p315
aVIt seems amazing to me that a belief about stress
p316
aVcan make so much difference to someone's life expectancy.
p317
aVHow would that extend to advice,
p318
aVlike, if someone is making a lifestyle choice
p319
aVbetween, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job,
p320
aVdoes it matter which way they go?
p321
aVIt's equally wise to go for the stressful job
p322
aVso long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense?
p323
aa(lp324
VKM: Yeah, and one thing we know for certain
p325
aVis that chasing meaning is better for your health
p326
aVthan trying to avoid discomfort.
p327
aVAnd so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions,
p328
aVis go after what it is that creates meaning in your life
p329
aVand then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.
p330
aa(lp331
VCA: Thank you so much, Kelly. It's pretty cool.

VA girl I've never met before
p5
aVchanged my life and the life of thousands of other people.
p6
aVI'm the CEO of DoSomething.org.
p7
aVIt's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people.
p8
aVIn fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States.
p9
aVAnd we're not homophobic.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd it's true \u2014 the way we communicate with young people is by text,
p14
aVbecause that's how young people communicate.
p15
aVSo we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,
p16
aVthings like collecting peanut butter for food pantries,
p17
aVor making Valentine's Day cards for senior citizens who are homebound.
p18
aVAnd we'll text them.
p19
aVAnd we'll have a 97 percent open rate.
p20
aVIt'll over-index Hispanic and urban.
p21
aVWe collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter
p22
aVand over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.
p23
aVThis is big scale. OK \u2014
p24
aa(lp25
V(Applause)
p26
aa(lp27
VBut there's one weird side effect.
p28
aVEvery time we send out a text message,
p29
aVwe get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter
p30
aVor hunger or senior citizens \u2014
p31
aVbut text messages about being bullied,
p32
aVtext messages about being addicted to pot.
p33
aVAnd the worst message we ever got said exactly this:
p34
aV"He won't stop raping me.
p35
aVIt's my dad.
p36
aVHe told me not to tell anyone. Are you there?"
p37
aa(lp38
VWe couldn't believe this was happening.
p39
aVWe couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being,
p40
aVand that she would share it with us \u2014 something so intimate, so personal.
p41
aVAnd we realized we had to stop triaging this
p42
aVand we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain.
p43
aVSo we launched Crisis Text Line,
p44
aVvery quietly, in Chicago and El Paso \u2014 just a few thousand people in each market.
p45
aVAnd in four months, we were in all 295 area codes in America.
p46
aVJust to put that into perspective,
p47
aVthat's zero marketing and faster growth than when Facebook first launched.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Applause)
p50
aa(lp51
VText is unbelievably private.
p52
aVNo one hears you talking.
p53
aVSo we spike everyday at lunch time \u2014
p54
aVkids are sitting at the lunch table
p55
aVand you think that she's texting the cute boy across the hall,
p56
aVbut she's actually texting us about her bulimia.
p57
aVAnd we don't get the word "like" or "um" or hyperventilating or crying.
p58
aVWe just get facts.
p59
aa(lp60
VWe get things like, "I want to die.
p61
aVI have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me."
p62
aVAnd so the crisis counselor says,
p63
aV"How about you put those pills in the drawer while we text?"
p64
aVAnd they go back and forth for a while.
p65
aVAnd the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address,
p66
aVbecause if you're texting a text line, you want help.
p67
aVSo she gets the address
p68
aVand the counselor triggers an active rescue
p69
aVwhile they're texting back and forth.
p70
aVAnd then it goes quiet \u2014
p71
aV23 minutes with no response from this girl.
p72
aVAnd the next message that comes in says \u2014
p73
aVit's the mom \u2014
p74
aV"I had no idea, and I was in the house,
p75
aVwe're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital."
p76
aVAs a mom that one just \u2014
p77
aVThe next message comes a month later.
p78
aV"I just got out of the hospital.
p79
aVI was diagnosed as bipolar, and I think I'm going to be OK."
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VI would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange,
p84
aVbut we're doing on average 2.41 active rescues a day.
p85
aVThirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression \u2014 huge.
p86
aVThe beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line
p87
aVis that these are strangers counseling other strangers
p88
aVon the most intimate issues,
p89
aVand getting them from hot moments to cold moments.
p90
aVIt's exciting, and I will tell you
p91
aVthat we have done a total of more than 6.5 million text messages
p92
aVin less than two years.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Applause)
p95
aa(lp96
VBut the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this,
p97
aVthe thing that really gets me psyched is the data:
p98
aV6.5 million messages \u2014
p99
aVthat's the volume, velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus.
p100
aVWe can do things like predictive work.
p101
aVWe can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set.
p102
aVSo we can be better, and the world can be better.
p103
aVSo how do we use the data to make us better?
p104
aVAlright, chances are someone here, someone watching this
p105
aVhas seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life \u2014
p106
aVyou do not have to raise your hand.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VHow do you know that person's any good?
p111
aVOh, they have a degree from Harvard on the wall?
p112
aVAre you sure he didn't graduate in the bottom 10 percent?
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VWhen my husband and I saw a marriage counselor,
p117
aVI thought she was a genius when she said,
p118
aV"I'll see you guys in two weeks \u2014 but I need to see you next week, sir."
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VWe have the data to know what makes a great counselor.
p123
aVWe know that if you text the words "numbs" and "sleeve,"
p124
aVthere's a 99 percent match for cutting.
p125
aVWe know that if you text in the words "mg" and "rubber band,"
p126
aVthere's a 99 percent match for substance abuse.
p127
aVAnd we know that if you text in "sex," "oral" and "Mormon,"
p128
aVyou're questioning if you're gay.
p129
aVNow that's interesting information that a counselor could figure out
p130
aVbut that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic pop-up says,
p131
aV"99 percent match for cutting \u2014 try asking one of these questions"
p132
aVto prompt the counselor.
p133
aVOr "99 percent match for substance abuse,
p134
aVhere are three drug clinics near the texter."
p135
aVIt makes us more accurate.
p136
aa(lp137
VOn the day that Robin Williams committed suicide,
p138
aVpeople flooded hotlines all over this country.
p139
aVIt was sad to see an icon, a funnyman, commit suicide,
p140
aVand there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country.
p141
aVWe had a spike in volume also.
p142
aVThe difference was
p143
aVif you text us, "I want to die," or "I want to kill myself,"
p144
aVthe algorithm reads that, you're code orange,
p145
aVand you become number one in the queue.
p146
aVSo we can handle severity, not chronological.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Applause)
p149
aa(lp150
VThis data is also making the world better
p151
aVbecause I'm sitting on the world's first map of real-time crises.
p152
aVThink about it:
p153
aVthose 6.5 million messages, auto-tagging through natural language processes,
p154
aVall of these data points \u2014
p155
aVI can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders: Monday.
p156
aVThe worst time of day for substance abuse: 5am.
p157
aVAnd that Montana is a beautiful place to visit
p158
aVbut you do not want to live there,
p159
aVbecause it is the number one state for suicidal ideation.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd we've made this data public and free and open.
p162
aVWe've pulled all the personally identifiable information.
p163
aVAnd it's in a place called CrisisTrends.org.
p164
aVBecause I want schools to be able to see
p165
aVthat Monday is the worst day for eating disorders,
p166
aVso that they can plan meals
p167
aVand guidance counselors to be there on Mondays.
p168
aVAnd I want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at 5am.
p169
aVI want somebody to take care of those Native American reservations in Montana.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VData, evidence
p174
aVmakes policy, research,
p175
aVjournalism, policing, school boards \u2014 everything better.
p176
aVI don't think of myself as a mental health activist.
p177
aVI think of myself as a national health activist.
p178
aVI get really excited about this data, I'm a little nerdy.
p179
aVYeah, that sounded too girly.
p180
aVI'm nerdy.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VI love data.
p185
aVAnd the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road
p186
aVwith their fat-funded companies,
p187
aVis that I'm not inspired by helping you find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas,
p188
aVor helping you touch your wrist and get a car immediately,
p189
aVor swipe right and get laid.
p190
aVI'm inspired \u2014
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter, applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VI want to use tech and data to make the world a better place.
p195
aVI want to use it to help that girl,
p196
aVwho texted in about  being raped by her father.
p197
aVBecause the truth is we never heard from her again.
p198
aVAnd I hope that she is somewhere safe and healthy,
p199
aVand I hope that she sees this talk
p200
aVand she knows that her desperation
p201
aVand her courage inspired the creation of Crisis Text Line
p202
aVand inspires me every freaking day.

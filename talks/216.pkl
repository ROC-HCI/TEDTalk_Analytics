VI'm here to enlist you
p5
aVin helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.
p6
aVHere is the old story \u2014 we've already heard a little bit about it:
p7
aVbiology is war in which only the fiercest survive;
p8
aVbusinesses and nations succeed only by defeating,
p9
aVdestroying and dominating competition;
p10
aa(lp11
Vpolitics is about your side winning at all costs.
p12
aVBut I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.
p13
aVIt's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines,
p14
aVin which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependencies
p15
aVplay a more important role.
p16
aVAnd the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittest
p17
aVshrinks just a little bit to make room.
p18
aa(lp19
VI started thinking about the relationship between communication, media
p20
aVand collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs,"
p21
aVand I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.
p22
aVIn fact, if you look back, human communication media
p23
aVand the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time.
p24
aVHumans have lived for much, much longer
p25
aVthan the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization
p26
aa(lp27
Vin small family groups. Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering food.
p28
aVThe form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive.
p29
aVBut at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.
p30
aVAnd we don't know exactly how they did this,
p31
aValthough they must have solved some collective action problems;
p32
aVit only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons
p33
aVwhile you're fighting with the other groups.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd again, we have no way of knowing,
p36
aVbut it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.
p37
aVMore protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.
p38
aVSo that raised a social question
p39
aVthat I believe must have driven new social forms.
p40
aVDid the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something
p41
aVto the hunters and their families?
p42
aVAnd if so, how did they make arrangements?
p43
aVAgain, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of
p44
aVsymbolic communication must have been involved.
p45
aa(lp46
VOf course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations,
p47
aVthe first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.
p48
aVAnd it was the administers of these empires
p49
aVwho began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed
p50
aVand the taxes that was owed on them
p51
aVby making marks; marks on clay in that time.
p52
aa(lp53
VNot too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented.
p54
aVAnd this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years,
p55
aVfor the elite administrators (Laughter) who kept track of accounts for the empires.
p56
aVAnd then another communication technology enabled new media:
p57
aVthe printing press came along, and within decades,
p58
aVmillions of people became literate.
p59
aVAnd from literate populations,
p60
aVnew forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge,
p61
aVreligion and politics.
p62
aVWe saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation,
p63
aVconstitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.
p64
aVNot created by the printing press,
p65
aVbut enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.
p66
aVAnd again, new forms of wealth emerged.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads.
p69
aVBut capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old,
p70
aVenabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies,
p71
aVsuch as the joint-stock ownership company,
p72
aVshared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet,
p75
aVand in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press,
p76
aVa broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.
p77
aVEvolution is speeding up.
p78
aVMore recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops,
p79
aVand very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority of
p80
aVthe human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputers
p81
aVlinked at speeds greater
p82
aVthan what we consider to be broadband today.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, when I started looking into collective action,
p85
aVthe considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas."
p86
aVAnd there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.
p87
aVI'm going to talk briefly about two of them:
p88
aVthe prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly,
p91
aVhe assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details
p92
aVof the prisoner's dilemma,
p93
aVso I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly.
p94
aVIf you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later. (Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VThe prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid
p97
aVon a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory
p98
aVin the early years of thinking about nuclear war:
p99
aVtwo players who couldn't trust each other.
p100
aVLet me just say that every unsecured transaction
p101
aVis a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.
p102
aVPerson with the goods, person with the money,
p103
aVbecause they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange.
p104
aVNeither one wants to be the first one
p105
aVor they're going to get the sucker's payoff,
p106
aVbut both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.
p107
aVIf they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into
p108
aVa different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.
p109
aa(lp110
VTwenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma
p111
aVas a probe of the biological question:
p112
aVif we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors,
p113
aVhow does cooperation exist at all?
p114
aVHe started a computer tournament for
p115
aVpeople to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered,
p116
aVmuch to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won \u2014
p117
aVit won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won,
p118
aVit won the second tournament \u2014 that's known as tit for tat.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnother economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma
p121
aVis the ultimatum game,
p122
aVand it's also a very interesting probe of
p123
aVour assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.
p124
aVHere's how the game is played: there are two players;
p125
aVthey've never played the game before,
p126
aVthey will not play the game again, they don't know each other,
p127
aVand they are, in fact, in separate rooms.
p128
aVFirst player is offered a hundred dollars
p129
aVand is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10,
p130
aVwhatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split \u2014
p131
aVboth players are paid and the game is over \u2014
p132
aVor rejects the split \u2014 neither player is paid and the game is over.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics
p135
aVwould tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar
p136
aVbecause someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99.
p137
aVYet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students,
p138
aVa significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50/50.
p139
aVAnd although they were screened and didn't know about the game
p140
aVand had never played the game before,
p141
aVproposers seemed to innately know this
p142
aVbecause the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow, the interesting part comes in more recently
p145
aVwhen anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures
p146
aVand discovered, to their surprise,
p147
aVthat slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazon
p148
aVor nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures \u2014
p149
aVeach had radically different ideas of what is fair.
p150
aVWhich suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness,
p151
aVthat somehow the basis of our economic
p152
aVtransactions can be influenced by our social institutions,
p153
aVwhether we know that or not.
p154
aa(lp155
VThe other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.
p156
aVGarrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.
p157
aVHe used the example of a common grazing area in which each person
p158
aVby simply maximizing their own flock
p159
aVled to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.
p160
aVHe had the rather gloomy conclusion that
p161
aVhumans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource
p162
aVin which people cannot be restrained from using it.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, in
p165
aV1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask,
p166
aVwhich is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?
p167
aVSo she went out and looked at what data she could find.
p168
aVShe looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds,
p169
aVforestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case,
p170
aVhumans destroyed the commons that they depended on.
p171
aVBut she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma;
p172
aVin fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.
p173
aVAnd she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.
p174
aVThey escape by creating institutions for collective action.
p175
aVAnd she discovered, I think most interestingly,
p176
aVthat among those institutions that worked,
p177
aVthere were a number of common design
p178
aVprinciples, and those principles seem to be
p179
aVmissing from those institutions that don't work.
p180
aa(lp181
VI'm moving very quickly over a number of
p182
aVdisciplines. In biology, the notions of symbiosis,
p183
aVgroup selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.
p184
aVBut there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that
p185
aVcooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role
p186
aVin biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.
p187
aVAnd again, our notions of individuals as economic beings
p188
aVhave been overturned.
p189
aVRational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.
p190
aVIn fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd most recently, neurophysiological measures
p193
aVhave shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games
p194
aVshow activity in the reward centers of their brain.
p195
aVWhich led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment
p196
aVmay be the glue that holds societies together.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media
p199
aVin the past have helped create new economic forms.
p200
aVCommerce is ancient. Markets are very old. Capitalism is fairly recent;
p201
aVsocialism emerged as a reaction to that.
p202
aVAnd yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.
p203
aVJim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source,
p204
aVpointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.
p205
aVI simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation
p206
aVenabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth,
p207
aVwe may be moving into yet another economic form
p208
aVthat is significantly different from previous ones.
p209
aa(lp210
VVery briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun \u2014
p211
aVsome of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing
p212
aVtheir software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.
p213
aVEli Lilly \u2014 in, again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world \u2014
p214
aVhas created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems.
p215
aVToyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace,
p216
aVtreats them as a network and trains them to produce better,
p217
aVeven though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.
p218
aVNow none of these companies are doing this out of altruism;
p219
aVthey're doing it because they're learning that
p220
aVa certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.
p221
aa(lp222
VOpen source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla,
p223
aVcan be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm
p224
aVnor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.
p225
aVGoogle enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.
p226
aVAmazon has opened its Application Programming Interface
p227
aVto 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.
p228
aVThey're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.
p229
aVeBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market
p230
aVwhere none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism
p231
aVthat turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.
p232
aa(lp233
VInstead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves,"
p234
aVit's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."
p235
aVWikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia
p236
aVwith a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.
p237
aa(lp238
VWe've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries
p239
aVto put up problems to be solved by design students around the world,
p240
aVincluding something that's being used for tsunami relief right now:
p241
aVit's a mechanism for rehydrating
p242
aVcholera victims that's so simple to use it,
p243
aVilliterates can be trained to use it.
p244
aVBitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader,
p245
aVmaking the system more efficient the more it is used.
p246
aa(lp247
VMillions of people have contributed their desktop computers
p248
aVwhen they're not using them to link together through the Internet
p249
aVinto supercomputing collectives
p250
aVthat help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers \u2014
p251
aVthat's Folding@home at Stanford \u2014
p252
aVto crack codes, to search for life in outer space.
p253
aa(lp254
VI don't think we know enough yet.
p255
aVI don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are,
p256
aVbut I think we can begin to think about them.
p257
aVAnd I don't have enough time to talk about all of them,
p258
aVbut think about self-interest.
p259
aVThis is all about self-interest that adds up to more.
p260
aVIn El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war
p261
aVtook moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.
p262
aa(lp263
VIn the U.S., in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world,
p264
aVcitizens have self-organized political protests and
p265
aVget out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.
p266
aVIs an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?
p267
aVA transdisciplinary study of cooperation?
p268
aVI believe that the payoff would be very big.
p269
aVI think we need to begin developing maps of this territory
p270
aVso that we can talk about it across disciplines.
p271
aVAnd I am not saying that understanding cooperation
p272
aVis going to cause us to be better people \u2014
p273
aVand sometimes people cooperate to do bad things \u2014
p274
aVbut I will remind you that a few hundred years ago,
p275
aVpeople saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought
p276
aVwere caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits.
p277
aa(lp278
VDescartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.
p279
aVWhen the scientific method provided that new way of thinking
p280
aVand biology showed that microorganisms caused disease,
p281
aVsuffering was alleviated.
p282
aVWhat forms of suffering could be alleviated,
p283
aVwhat forms of wealth could be created
p284
aVif we knew a little bit more about cooperation?
p285
aVI don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse
p286
aVis automatically going to happen;
p287
aVit's going to require effort.
p288
aVSo I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started.
p289
aVThank you.

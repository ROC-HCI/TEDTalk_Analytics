VHello! My name is Golan Levin.
p5
aVI'm an artist and an engineer,
p6
aVwhich is, increasingly, a more common kind of hybrid.
p7
aVBut I still fall into this weird crack
p8
aVwhere people don't seem to understand me.
p9
aVAnd I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture.
p10
aVIt's a letter from "Artforum" in 1967
p11
aVsaying "We can't imagine ever doing a special issue
p12
aVon electronics or computers in art." And they still haven't.
p13
aVAnd lest you think that you all, as the digerati, are more enlightened,
p14
aVI went to the Apple iPhone app store the other day.
p15
aVWhere's art? I got productivity. I got sports.
p16
aVAnd somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone,
p17
aVwhich my friends and I are doing now,
p18
aVis still not reflected in our understanding
p19
aVof what computers are for.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo, from both directions, there is kind of, I think, a lack of understanding
p22
aVabout what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials
p23
aVof his own day, or her own day,
p24
aVwhich I think artists are obliged to do,
p25
aVis to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have.
p26
aVIn my own case, I'm an artist,
p27
aVand I'm really interested in
p28
aVexpanding the vocabulary of human action,
p29
aVand basically empowering people through interactivity.
p30
aVI want people to discover themselves as actors,
p31
aVas creative actors, by having interactive experiences.
p32
aa(lp33
VA lot of my work is about trying to get away from this.
p34
aVThis a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine.
p35
aVAnd when I say desktop, I don't just mean
p36
aVthe actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk.
p37
aVIf you look carefully, you can even see
p38
aVa hint of the Apple menu, up here in the upper left,
p39
aVwhere the virtual world has literally
p40
aVpunched through to the physical.
p41
aVSo this is, as Joy Mountford once said,
p42
aV"The mouse is probably the narrowest straw
p43
aVyou could try to suck all of human expression through."
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd the thing I'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich
p48
aVkinds of interactive experiences.
p49
aVHow can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies
p50
aVas a way of exploring aesthetic experiences,
p51
aVnot necessarily utilitarian ones.
p52
aVSo I write software. And that's how I do it.
p53
aVAnd a lot of my experiences
p54
aVresemble mirrors in some way.
p55
aVBecause this is, in some sense, the first way,
p56
aVthat people discover their own potential as actors,
p57
aVand discover their own agency.
p58
aVBy saying "Who is that person in the mirror? Oh it's actually me."
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd so, to give an example,
p61
aVthis is a project from last year,
p62
aVwhich is called the Interstitial Fragment Processor.
p63
aVAnd it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create
p64
aVwhen they're just going about their everyday business.
p65
aVSo as people make shapes with their hands or their heads
p66
aVand so forth, or with each other,
p67
aVthese shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air \u2014
p68
aVbasically taking what's often this, kind of, unseen space,
p69
aVor this undetected space, and making it something real,
p70
aVthat people then can appreciate and become creative with.
p71
aVSo again, people discover their creative agency in this way.
p72
aVAnd their own personalities come out
p73
aVin totally unique ways.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo in addition to using full-body input,
p76
aVsomething that I've explored now, for a while,
p77
aVhas been the use of the voice,
p78
aVwhich is an immensely expressive system for us, vocalizing.
p79
aVSong is one of our oldest ways
p80
aVof making ourselves heard and understood.
p81
aVAnd I came across this fantastic research by Wolfgang Köhler,
p82
aVthe so-called father of gestalt psychology, from 1927,
p83
aVwho submitted to an audience like yourselves
p84
aVthe following two shapes.
p85
aVAnd he said one of them is called Maluma.
p86
aVAnd one of them is called Taketa. Which is which?
p87
aVAnyone want to hazard a guess?
p88
aVMaluma is on top. Yeah. So.
p89
aVAs he says here, most people answer without any hesitation.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon
p92
aVcalled phonaesthesia,
p93
aVwhich is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have.
p94
aVAnd so, whereas Dr. Oliver Sacks has talked about
p95
aVhow perhaps one person in a million
p96
aVactually has true synesthesia,
p97
aVwhere they hear colors or taste shapes, and things like this,
p98
aVphonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent.
p99
aVIt's about mappings between different perceptual domains,
p100
aVlike hardness, sharpness, brightness and darkness,
p101
aVand the phonemes that we're able to speak with.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo 70 years on, there's been some research where
p104
aVcognitive psychologists have actually sussed out
p105
aVthe extent to which, you know,
p106
aVL, M and B are more associated with shapes that look like this,
p107
aVand P, T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this.
p108
aVAnd here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature
p109
aVthat we can exploit numerically,
p110
aVa relative mapping between curvature and shape.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo it occurred to me, what happens if we could run these backwards?
p113
aVAnd thus was born the project called Remark,
p114
aVwhich is a collaboration with Zachary Lieberman
p115
aVand the Ars Electronica Futurelab.
p116
aVAnd this is an interactive installation which presents
p117
aVthe fiction that speech casts visible shadows.
p118
aVSo the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light.
p119
aVAnd as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech.
p120
aVAnd they sort of fly away, out of your head.
p121
aVIf a computer speech recognition system
p122
aVis able to recognize what you're saying, then it spells it out.
p123
aVAnd if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically
p124
aVtightly coupled to the sounds you made.
p125
aVSo let's bring up a video of that.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Applause)
p128
aa(lp129
VThanks. So. And this project here,
p130
aVI was working with the great abstract vocalist, Jaap Blonk.
p131
aVAnd he is a world expert in performing "The Ursonate,"
p132
aVwhich is a half-an-hour nonsense poem
p133
aVby Kurt Schwitters, written in the 1920s,
p134
aVwhich is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense.
p135
aVAnd it's almost impossible to perform.
p136
aVBut Jaap is one of the world experts in performing it.
p137
aVAnd in this project we've developed
p138
aVa form of intelligent real-time subtitles.
p139
aVSo these are our live subtitles,
p140
aVthat are being produced by a computer that knows the text of "The Ursonate" \u2014
p141
aVfortunately Jaap does too, very well \u2014
p142
aVand it is delivering that text at the same time as Jaap is.
p143
aVSo all the text you're going to see
p144
aVis real-time generated by the computer,
p145
aVvisualizing what he's doing with his voice.
p146
aVHere you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him.
p147
aVOkay. So ...
p148
aV(Applause)
p149
aVThe full videos are online if you are interested.
p150
aa(lp151
VI got a split reaction to that during the live performance,
p152
aVbecause there is some people who understand
p153
aVlive subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron,
p154
aVbecause usually there is someone making them afterwards.
p155
aVAnd then a bunch of people who were like, "What's the big deal?
p156
aVI see subtitles all the time on television."
p157
aVYou know? They don't imagine the person in the booth, typing it all.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo in addition to the full body, and in addition to the voice,
p160
aVanother thing that I've been really interested in,
p161
aVmost recently, is the use of the eyes,
p162
aVor the gaze, in terms of how people relate to each other.
p163
aVIt's a really profound amount of nonverbal information
p164
aVthat's communicated with the eyes.
p165
aVAnd it's one of the most interesting technical challenges
p166
aVthat's very currently active in the computer sciences:
p167
aVbeing able to have a camera that can understand,
p168
aVfrom a fairly big distance away,
p169
aVhow these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another
p170
aVto reveal what you're interested in,
p171
aVand where your attention is directed.
p172
aVSo there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd so I've been beginning, with a variety of different projects,
p175
aVto understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes.
p176
aVAnd basically to ask the questions:
p177
aVWhat if art was aware that we were looking at it?
p178
aVHow could it respond, in a way,
p179
aVto acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it?
p180
aVAnd what could it do if it could look back at us?
p181
aVAnd so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects.
p182
aa(lp183
VIn the first one which I'm going to show you, called Eyecode,
p184
aVit's a piece of interactive software
p185
aVin which, if we read this little circle,
p186
aV"the trace left by the looking of the previous observer
p187
aVlooks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer."
p188
aVThe idea is that it's an image wholly constructed
p189
aVfrom its own history of being viewed
p190
aVby different people in an installation.
p191
aVSo let me just switch over so we can do the live demo.
p192
aVSo let's run this and see if it works.
p193
aa(lp194
VOkay. Ah, there is lots of nice bright video.
p195
aVThere is just a little test screen that shows that it's working.
p196
aVAnd what I'm just going to do is \u2014 I'm going to hide that.
p197
aVAnd you can see here that what it's doing
p198
aVis it's recording my eyes every time I blink.
p199
aVHello? And I can ... hello ... okay.
p200
aVAnd no matter where I am, what's really going on here
p201
aVis that it's an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes.
p202
aVAnd if I get really far away I'm blurry.
p203
aVYou know, you're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this
p204
aVthat maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way.
p205
aVBut if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera
p206
aVon this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes.
p207
aa(lp208
VYou can think of it as a way of, sort of, typing, with your eyes.
p209
aVAnd what you're typing are recordings of your eyes
p210
aVas you're looking at other peoples' eyes.
p211
aVSo each person is looking at the looking
p212
aVof everyone else before them.
p213
aVAnd this exists in larger installations
p214
aVwhere there are thousands and thousands of eyes
p215
aVthat people could be staring at,
p216
aVas you see who's looking at the people looking
p217
aVat the people looking before them.
p218
aVSo I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink.
p219
aVAnd you can see, just once again, how it's sort of finding my eyes
p220
aVand doing its best to estimate when it's blinking.
p221
aVAlright. Let's leave that.
p222
aVSo that's this kind of recursive observation system.
p223
aV(Applause)
p224
aVThank you.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe last couple pieces I'm going to show
p227
aVare basically in the new realm of robotics \u2014 for me, new for me.
p228
aVIt's called Opto-Isolator.
p229
aVAnd I'm going to show a video of the older version of it,
p230
aVwhich is just a minute long. Okay.
p231
aVIn this case, the Opto-Isolator is blinking
p232
aVin response to one's own blinks.
p233
aVSo it blinks one second after you do.
p234
aVThis is a device which is intended to reduce
p235
aVthe phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials.
p236
aVJust one eye,
p237
aVlooking at you, and eliminating everything else about a face,
p238
aVbut just to consider gaze in an isolated way
p239
aVas a kind of, as an element.
p240
aVAnd at the same time, it attempts to engage in what you might call
p241
aVfamiliar psycho-social gaze behaviors.
p242
aVLike looking away if you look at it too long
p243
aVbecause it gets shy,
p244
aVor things like that.
p245
aa(lp246
VOkay. So the last project I'm going to show
p247
aVis this new one called Snout.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVIt's an eight-foot snout,
p250
aVwith a googly eye.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVAnd inside it's got an 800-pound robot arm
p253
aVthat I borrowed,
p254
aV(Laughter)
p255
aVfrom a friend.
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aVIt helps to have good friends.
p258
aVI'm at Carnegie Mellon; we've got a great Robotics Institute there.
p259
aVI'd like to show you thing called Snout, which is \u2014
p260
aVThe idea behind this project is to
p261
aVmake a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you.
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aVThe idea is that basically \u2014
p264
aVif it's constantly like "Huh? ... Huh?"
p265
aVThat's why its other name is Doubletaker, Taker of Doubles.
p266
aVIt's always kind of doing a double take: "What?"
p267
aVAnd the idea is basically, can it look at you
p268
aVand make you feel as if like,
p269
aV"What? Is it my shoes?"
p270
aV"Got something on my hair?" Here we go. Alright.
p271
aa(lp272
VChecking him out ...
p273
aVFor you nerds, here's a little behind-the-scenes.
p274
aVIt's got a computer vision system,
p275
aVand it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most.
p276
aVThose are its targets.
p277
aVUp there is the skeleton,
p278
aVwhich is actually what it's trying to do.
p279
aVIt's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature.
p280
aVHollywood does this all the time, of course.
p281
aVBut also have the body language communicate something
p282
aVto the person who is looking at it.
p283
aVThis language is communicating that it is surprised to see you,
p284
aVand it's interested in looking at you.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
V(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you very much. That's all I've got for today.
p291
aVAnd I'm really happy to be here. Thank you so much.

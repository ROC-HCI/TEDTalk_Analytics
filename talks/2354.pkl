(lp4
VA few years ago,
p5
aVwith my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,
p6
aVI invented a new technology for editing genomes.
p7
aVIt's called CRISPR-Cas9.
p8
aVThe CRISPR technology allows scientists to make changes
p9
aVto the DNA in cells
p10
aVthat could allow us to cure genetic disease.
p11
aa(lp12
VYou might be interested to know
p13
aVthat the CRISPR technology came about through a basic research project
p14
aVthat was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections.
p15
aVBacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment,
p16
aVand we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb \u2014
p17
aVa bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb
p18
aVbefore it gets destroyed.
p19
aVSo, many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called CRISPR,
p20
aVthat allows them to detect viral DNA and destroy it.
p21
aa(lp22
VPart of the CRISPR system is a protein called Cas9,
p23
aVthat's able to seek out, cut and eventually degrade viral DNA
p24
aVin a specific way.
p25
aVAnd it was through our research
p26
aVto understand the activity of this protein, Cas9,
p27
aVthat we realized that we could harness its function
p28
aVas a genetic engineering technology \u2014
p29
aVa way for scientists to delete or insert specific bits of DNA into cells
p30
aVwith incredible precision \u2014
p31
aVthat would offer opportunities
p32
aVto do things that really haven't been possible in the past.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe CRISPR technology has already been used
p35
aVto change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys,
p36
aVother organisms as well.
p37
aVChinese scientists showed recently
p38
aVthat they could even use the CRISPR technology
p39
aVto change genes in human embryos.
p40
aVAnd scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR
p41
aVto remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus
p42
aVfrom infected human cells.
p43
aa(lp44
VThe opportunity to do this kind of genome editing
p45
aValso raises various ethical issues that we have to consider,
p46
aVbecause this technology can be employed not only in adult cells,
p47
aVbut also in the embryos of organisms,
p48
aVincluding our own species.
p49
aVAnd so, together with my colleagues,
p50
aVI've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co-invented,
p51
aVso that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications
p52
aVof a technology like this.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhat I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is,
p55
aVwhat it can do,
p56
aVwhere we are today
p57
aVand why I think we need to take a prudent path forward
p58
aVin the way that we employ this technology.
p59
aa(lp60
VWhen viruses infect a cell, they inject their DNA.
p61
aVAnd in a bacterium,
p62
aVthe CRISPR system allows that DNA to be plucked out of the virus,
p63
aVand inserted in little bits into the chromosome \u2014
p64
aVthe DNA of the bacterium.
p65
aVAnd these integrated bits of viral DNA get inserted at a site called CRISPR.
p66
aVCRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VA big mouthful \u2014 you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR.
p70
aVIt's a mechanism that allows cells to record, over time,
p71
aVthe viruses they have been exposed to.
p72
aVAnd importantly, those bits of DNA are passed on to the cells' progeny,
p73
aVso cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation,
p74
aVbut over many generations of cells.
p75
aVThis allows the cells to keep a record of infection,
p76
aVand as my colleague, Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say,
p77
aVthe CRISPR locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells.
p78
aVOnce those bits of DNA have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome,
p79
aVthe cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RNA,
p80
aVwhich is orange in this picture,
p81
aVthat is an exact replicate of the viral DNA.
p82
aVRNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,
p83
aVand it allows interaction with DNA molecules
p84
aVthat have a matching sequence.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR locus
p87
aVassociate \u2014 they bind \u2014 to protein called Cas9,
p88
aVwhich is white in the picture,
p89
aVand form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell.
p90
aVIt searches through all of the DNA in the cell,
p91
aVto find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs.
p92
aVAnd when those sites are found \u2014
p93
aVas you can see here, the blue molecule is DNA \u2014
p94
aVthis complex associates with that DNA
p95
aVand allows the Cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral DNA.
p96
aVIt makes a very precise break.
p97
aVSo we can think of the Cas9 RNA sentinel complex
p98
aVlike a pair of scissors that can cut DNA \u2014
p99
aVit makes a double-stranded break in the DNA helix.
p100
aVAnd importantly, this complex is programmable,
p101
aVso it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences,
p102
aVand make a break in the DNA at that site.
p103
aa(lp104
VAs I'm going to tell you now,
p105
aVwe recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering,
p106
aVto allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA
p107
aVat the site where this break was introduced.
p108
aVThat's sort of analogous
p109
aVto the way that we use a word-processing program
p110
aVto fix a typo in a document.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering
p113
aVis because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA
p114
aVand repair it.
p115
aVSo when a plant or an animal cell detects a double-stranded break in its DNA,
p116
aVit can fix that break,
p117
aVeither by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA
p118
aVwith a little, tiny change in the sequence of that position,
p119
aVor it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.
p120
aVSo if we have a way to introduce double-stranded breaks into DNA
p121
aVat precise places,
p122
aVwe can trigger cells to repair those breaks,
p123
aVby either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information.
p124
aVSo if we were able to program the CRISPR technology
p125
aVto make a break in DNA
p126
aVat the position at or near a mutation causing cystic fibrosis, for example,
p127
aVwe could trigger cells to repair that mutation.
p128
aa(lp129
VGenome engineering is actually not new, it's been in development since the 1970s.
p130
aVWe've had technologies for sequencing DNA,
p131
aVfor copying DNA,
p132
aVand even for manipulating DNA.
p133
aVAnd these technologies were very promising,
p134
aVbut the problem was that they were either inefficient,
p135
aVor they were difficult enough to use
p136
aVthat most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories,
p137
aVor certainly for many clinical applications.
p138
aVSo, the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,
p139
aVbecause of its relative simplicity.
p140
aVWe can think of older genome engineering technologies
p141
aVas similar to having to rewire your computer
p142
aVeach time you want to run a new piece of software,
p143
aVwhereas the CRISPR technology is like software for the genome,
p144
aVwe can program it easily, using these little bits of RNA.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo once a double-stranded break is made in DNA,
p147
aVwe can induce repair,
p148
aVand thereby potentially achieve astounding things,
p149
aVlike being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia
p150
aVor cause Huntington's Disease.
p151
aVI actually think that the first applications of the CRISPR technology
p152
aVare going to happen in the blood,
p153
aVwhere it's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells,
p154
aVcompared to solid tissues.
p155
aa(lp156
VRight now, a lot of the work that's going on
p157
aVapplies to animal models of human disease, such as mice.
p158
aVThe technology is being used to make very precise changes
p159
aVthat allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA
p160
aVaffect either a tissue or, in this case, an entire organism.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow in this example,
p163
aVthe CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene
p164
aVby making a tiny change in the DNA
p165
aVin a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice.
p166
aVImagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates
p167
aVby just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome,
p168
aVand they're otherwise completely normal.
p169
aVAnd when we sequence the DNA from these animals,
p170
aVwe find that the change in the DNA
p171
aVhas occurred at exactly the place where we induced it,
p172
aVusing the CRISPR technology.
p173
aa(lp174
VAdditional experiments are going on in other animals
p175
aVthat are useful for creating models for human disease,
p176
aVsuch as monkeys.
p177
aVAnd here we find that we can use these systems
p178
aVto test the application of this technology in particular tissues,
p179
aVfor example, figuring out how to deliver the CRISPR tool into cells.
p180
aVWe also want to understand better
p181
aVhow to control the way that DNA is repaired after it's cut,
p182
aVand also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off-target,
p183
aVor unintended effects of using the technology.
p184
aa(lp185
VI think that we will see clinical application of this technology,
p186
aVcertainly in adults,
p187
aVwithin the next 10 years.
p188
aVI think that it's likely that we will see clinical trials
p189
aVand possibly even approved therapies within that time,
p190
aVwhich is a very exciting thing to think about.
p191
aVAnd because of the excitement around this technology,
p192
aVthere's a lot of interest in start-up companies
p193
aVthat have been founded to commercialize the CRISPR technology,
p194
aVand lots of venture capitalists
p195
aVthat have been investing in these companies.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut we have to also consider
p198
aVthat the CRISPR technology can be used for things like enhancement.
p199
aVImagine that we could try to engineer humans
p200
aVthat have enhanced properties, such as stronger bones,
p201
aVor less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease
p202
aVor even to have properties
p203
aVthat we would consider maybe to be desirable,
p204
aVlike a different eye color or to be taller, things like that.
p205
aV"Designer humans," if you will.
p206
aVRight now, the genetic information
p207
aVto understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits
p208
aVis mostly not known.
p209
aVBut it's important to know
p210
aVthat the CRISPR technology gives us a tool to make such changes,
p211
aVonce that knowledge becomes available.
p212
aa(lp213
VThis raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider,
p214
aVand this is why I and my colleagues have called for a global pause
p215
aVin any clinical application of the CRISPR technology in human embryos,
p216
aVto give us time
p217
aVto really consider all of the various implications of doing so.
p218
aVAnd actually, there is an important precedent for such a pause
p219
aVfrom the 1970s,
p220
aVwhen scientists got together
p221
aVto call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning,
p222
aVuntil the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and validated.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo, genome-engineered humans are not with us yet,
p225
aVbut this is no longer science fiction.
p226
aVGenome-engineered animals and plants are happening right now.
p227
aVAnd this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility,
p228
aVto consider carefully both the unintended consequences
p229
aVas well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough.
p230
aa(lp231
VThank you.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
V(Applause ends)
p236
aa(lp237
VBruno Giussani: Jennifer, this is a technology with huge consequences,
p238
aVas you pointed out.
p239
aVYour attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine
p240
aVis incredibly responsible.
p241
aVThere are, of course, the therapeutic results of this,
p242
aVbut then there are the un-therapeutic ones
p243
aVand they seem to be the ones gaining traction,
p244
aVparticularly in the media.
p245
aVThis is one of the latest issues of The Economist \u2014 "Editing humanity."
p246
aVIt's all about genetic enhancement, it's not about therapeutics.
p247
aVWhat kind of reactions did you get back in March
p248
aVfrom your colleagues in the science world,
p249
aVwhen you asked or suggested
p250
aVthat we should actually pause this for a moment and think about it?
p251
aa(lp252
VJennifer Doudna: My colleagues were actually, I think, delighted
p253
aVto have the opportunity to discuss this openly.
p254
aVIt's interesting that as I talk to people,
p255
aVmy scientific colleagues as well as others,
p256
aVthere's a wide variety of viewpoints about this.
p257
aVSo clearly it's a topic that needs careful consideration and discussion.
p258
aa(lp259
VBG: There's a big meeting happening in December
p260
aVthat you and your colleagues are calling,
p261
aVtogether with the National Academy of Sciences and others,
p262
aVwhat do you hope will come out of the meeting, practically?
p263
aa(lp264
VJD: Well, I hope that we can air the views
p265
aVof many different individuals and stakeholders
p266
aVwho want to think about how to use this technology responsibly.
p267
aVIt may not be possible to come up with a consensus point of view,
p268
aVbut I think we should at least understand
p269
aVwhat all the issues are as we go forward.
p270
aa(lp271
VBG: Now, colleagues of yours,
p272
aVlike George Church, for example, at Harvard,
p273
aVthey say, "Yeah, ethical issues basically are just a question of safety.
p274
aVWe test and test and test again, in animals and in labs,
p275
aVand then once we feel it's safe enough, we move on to humans."
p276
aVSo that's kind of the other school of thought,
p277
aVthat we should actually use this opportunity and really go for it.
p278
aVIs there a possible split happening in the science community about this?
p279
aVI mean, are we going to see some people holding back
p280
aVbecause they have ethical concerns,
p281
aVand some others just going forward
p282
aVbecause some countries under-regulate or don't regulate at all?
p283
aa(lp284
VJD: Well, I think with any new technology, especially something like this,
p285
aVthere are going to be a variety of viewpoints,
p286
aVand I think that's perfectly understandable.
p287
aVI think that in the end,
p288
aVthis technology will be used for human genome engineering,
p289
aVbut I think to do that without careful consideration and discussion
p290
aVof the risks and potential complications
p291
aVwould not be responsible.
p292
aa(lp293
VBG: There are a lot of technologies and other fields of science
p294
aVthat are developing exponentially, pretty much like yours.
p295
aVI'm thinking about artificial intelligence, autonomous robots and so on.
p296
aVNo one seems \u2014
p297
aVaside from autonomous warfare robots \u2014
p298
aVnobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those fields,
p299
aVin calling for a moratorium.
p300
aVDo you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields?
p301
aa(lp302
VJD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory.
p303
aVSpeaking for myself,
p304
aVit's a little bit uncomfortable to do that.
p305
aVBut I do think that being involved in the genesis of this
p306
aVreally puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility.
p307
aVAnd I would say that I certainly hope that other technologies
p308
aVwill be considered in the same way,
p309
aVjust as we would want to consider something that could have implications
p310
aVin other fields besides biology.
p311
aa(lp312
VBG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED.
p313
aa(lp314
VJD: Thank you.

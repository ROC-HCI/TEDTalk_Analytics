p5
aVDavid Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.
p6
aVAnd we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.
p7
aVWe've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen,
p8
aVand we're not going to show you any of it.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VThe truth of the matter is that the Titanic \u2014
p12
aVeven though it's breaking all sorts of box office records \u2014
p13
aVit's not the most exciting story from the sea.
p14
aVAnd the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.
p15
aVWhen you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.
p16
aVMost of the planet is ocean water.
p17
aVThe average depth is about two miles.
p18
aVPart of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach,
p19
aVor we see images like this of the ocean,
p20
aVand you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering
p21
aVand it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides,
p22
aVbut you have no idea for what lies in there.
p23
aVAnd in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.
p24
aVMost of the animals are in the oceans.
p25
aVMost of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea,
p26
aVat the bottom of the sea.
p27
aVThe biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places,
p28
aVthan it is in the rainforests.
p29
aVIt's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this
p30
aVthat captivate us and make us become familiar with it.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think
p33
aVthat you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.
p34
aVWe have to have a very special technology
p35
aVto get into that unfamiliar world.
p36
aVWe use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras,
p37
aVand the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.
p38
aVMarcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery
p39
aVis not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes."
p40
aVPeople that have partnered with us have given us new eyes,
p41
aVnot only on what exists \u2014
p42
aVthe new landscapes at the bottom of the sea \u2014
p43
aVbut also how we think about life on the planet itself.
p44
aa(lp45
VHere's a jelly.
p46
aVIt's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.
p47
aVThis turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.
p48
aVIt gets up to about 150 feet long.
p49
aVBut see all those different working things?
p50
aVI love that kind of stuff.
p51
aVIt's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.
p52
aVIt's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.
p53
aVIt's a colonial animal.
p54
aVThese are all individual animals
p55
aVbanding together to make this one creature.
p56
aVAnd it's got these jet thrusters up in front
p57
aVthat it'll use in a moment, and a little light.
p58
aVIf you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that,
p59
aVput them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals
p60
aVon the other side, those guys win hands down.
p61
aa(lp62
VMost of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.
p63
aVHere's the X-wing death jelly.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVThe bioluminescence \u2014 they use the lights for attracting mates
p66
aVand attracting prey and communicating.
p67
aVWe couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.
p68
aVThey come in all different sizes and shapes.
p69
aa(lp70
VBill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep
p71
aVon average, and that we're real familiar with the animals
p72
aVthat are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar
p73
aVwith what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.
p74
aVAnd these are the types of animals
p75
aVthat live in that three-dimensional space,
p76
aVthat micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.
p77
aVYou hear about giant squid and things like that,
p78
aVbut some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.
p79
aVThey're very little understood.
p80
aa(lp81
VDG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.
p82
aVYou can actually see through his head.
p83
aVAnd here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.
p84
aVWe see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.
p85
aVThey go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.
p86
aVThey come right up to the submarine \u2014
p87
aVthey'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.
p88
aa(lp89
VThis is really a world within a world,
p90
aVand we're going to show you two.
p91
aVIn this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.
p92
aVThis is kind of like an undersea rooster.
p93
aVThis guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.
p94
aVAnd then one of my favorites. What a face!
p95
aVThis is basically scientific data that you're looking at.
p96
aVIt's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.
p97
aVAnd that's one of the things that Bill's been doing,
p98
aVis providing scientists with this first view of animals like this,
p99
aVin the world where they belong.
p100
aVThey don't catch them in a net.
p101
aVThey're actually looking at them down in that world.
p102
aVWe're going to take a joystick,
p103
aVsit in front of our computer, on the Earth,
p104
aVand press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.
p105
aa(lp106
VWe're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge,
p107
aVa 40,000-mile long mountain range.
p108
aVThe average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.
p109
aVAnd we're over the Atlantic \u2014 that's the ridge right there \u2014
p110
aVbut we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America,
p111
aVand end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.
p112
aVWe make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar,
p113
aVand this is one of those mountain ranges.
p114
aVWe're coming around a cliff here on the right.
p115
aVThe height of these mountains on either side of this valley
p116
aVis greater than the Alps in most cases.
p117
aVAnd there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.
p118
aa(lp119
VThis is a volcanic ridge.
p120
aVWe're getting down further and further in scale.
p121
aVAnd eventually, we can come up with something like this.
p122
aa(lp123
VThis is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.
p124
aVAnd you can sit in a room like this,
p125
aVwith a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that
p126
aVaround the bottom of the ocean in real time.
p127
aVOne of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners
p128
aVis to bring this virtual world \u2014
p129
aVthis world, this unexplored region \u2014 back to the laboratory.
p130
aVBecause we see it in bits and pieces right now.
p131
aVWe see it either as sound, or we see it as video,
p132
aVor we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors,
p133
aVbut we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.
p134
aa(lp135
VHere's where Bill's cameras really do shine.
p136
aVThis is what's called a hydrothermal vent.
p137
aVAnd what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed,
p138
aVhydrogen-sulfide-rich water
p139
aVcoming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.
p140
aVGets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.
p141
aVSo that's all water under the sea \u2014
p142
aVa mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.
p143
aVAnd we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.
p144
aVAnd then we had some hint that these things existed
p145
aVall along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism,
p146
aVwater's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor,
p147
aVcome in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.
p148
aVWe weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.
p149
aVWe didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.
p150
aa(lp151
VThis is one of these hydrothermal vents.
p152
aVSix hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.
p153
aVOn either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps,
p154
aVso the setting here is very dramatic.
p155
aa(lp156
VBL: The white material is a type of bacteria
p157
aVthat thrives at 180 degrees C.
p158
aa(lp159
VDG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now
p160
aVthat we're seeing from the bottom of the sea,
p161
aVis that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor
p162
aVafter a volcanic eruption is bacteria.
p163
aVAnd we started to wonder for a long time,
p164
aVhow did it all get down there?
p165
aVWhat we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.
p166
aVNot only is it coming out of the Earth \u2014
p167
aVso, biogenesis made from volcanic activity \u2014
p168
aVbut that bacteria supports these colonies of life.
p169
aVThe pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.
p170
aVA mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles \u2014
p171
aVno sun has ever gotten down here.
p172
aVAll the energy to support these life forms
p173
aVis coming from inside the Earth \u2014 so, chemosynthesis.
p174
aVAnd you can see how dense the population is.
p175
aVThese are called tube worms.
p176
aa(lp177
VBL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth.
p178
aVBut they have two types of gill structures.
p179
aVOne for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water,
p180
aVanother one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria,
p181
aVwhich takes the hydrothermal fluid \u2014
p182
aVthat hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom \u2014
p183
aVand converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.
p184
aa(lp185
VDG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.
p186
aVHe's managed to grab a tip of these worms.
p187
aVNow, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.
p188
aVOh! Good going.
p189
aVSo, as soon as a crab touches them,
p190
aVthey retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.
p191
aVThere's a whole story being played out here
p192
aVthat we're just now beginning to have some idea of
p193
aVbecause of this new camera technology.
p194
aa(lp195
VBL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme.
p196
aVTheir foot is at about 200 degrees C
p197
aVand their head is out at three degrees C,
p198
aVso it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.
p199
aVThat's how they like to live.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VDG: This is a female of this kind of worm.
p203
aVAnd here's a male.
p204
aVYou watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here \u2014
p205
aVthis one and one that will show up over here \u2014 start to fight.
p206
aVEverything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea.
p207
aVThere are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring.
p208
aVHere they go.
p209
aVOn one of the last dive series,
p210
aVwe counted 200 species in these areas \u2014
p211
aV198 were new, new species.
p212
aa(lp213
VBL: One of the big problems is that for the biologists
p214
aVworking at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals.
p215
aVAnd they disintegrate on the way up,
p216
aVso the imagery is critical for the science.
p217
aa(lp218
VDG: Two octopods at about two miles depth.
p219
aVThis pressure thing really amazes me \u2014
p220
aVthat these animals can exist there at a depth
p221
aVwith pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.
p222
aVWhat we saw up till now was from the Pacific.
p223
aVThis is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.
p224
aVYou can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here,
p225
aVand he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd the same thing's going on over here.
p229
aVWhat they're getting at is that \u2014 on the back of this crab \u2014
p230
aVthe foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria
p231
aVthat lives on the backs of all these animals.
p232
aVAnd what these shrimp are trying to do
p233
aVis actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals.
p234
aVAnd the crabs don't like it at all.
p235
aVThese long filaments that you see on the back of the crab
p236
aVare actually created by the product of that bacteria.
p237
aVSo, the bacteria grows hair on the crab.
p238
aVOn the back, you see this again.
p239
aVThe red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin
p240
aVto give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents.
p241
aVThose are all shrimp.
p242
aVYou see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out.
p243
aVThey're clinging to a rock face
p244
aVand actually scraping bacteria off that rock face.
p245
aVHere's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.
p246
aVThose pillars get up to several stories.
p247
aVSo here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape
p248
aVof pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes,
p249
aVinhabited by these very strange animals
p250
aVthat live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground.
p251
aVThey don't need the sun at all.
p252
aa(lp253
VBL: You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp?
p254
aVIt's actually a light-sensing organ.
p255
aVIt's how they find the hydrothermal vents.
p256
aVThe vents are emitting a black body radiation \u2014 an IR signature \u2014
p257
aVand so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.
p258
aa(lp259
VDG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range
p260
aVthat we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today,
p261
aVas we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity.
p262
aVThis is the first time we've ever tried this any place.
p263
aVWe're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific.
p264
aVWe're moving up one of these pillars.
p265
aVThis one's several stories tall.
p266
aVIn it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals.
p267
aVThere's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it.
p268
aVSo all of these are individual homes for worms.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow here's a closer view of that community.
p271
aVHere's crabs here, worms here.
p272
aVThere are smaller animals crawling around.
p273
aVHere's pagoda structures.
p274
aVI think this is the neatest-looking thing.
p275
aVI just can't get over this \u2014
p276
aVthat you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away.
p277
aVThis stuff is toxic as hell, by the way.
p278
aVYou could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean,
p279
aVand it's coming out all from it.
p280
aV(Laughter)
p281
aVIt's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid,
p282
aVand it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.
p283
aVAnd animals are thriving \u2014 and we probably came from here.
p284
aVThat's probably where we evolved from.
p285
aa(lp286
VBL: This bacteria that we've been talking about
p287
aVturns out to be the most simplest form of life found.
p288
aVThere are a number of groups that are proposing
p289
aVthat life evolved at these vent sites.
p290
aVAlthough the vent sites are short-lived \u2014
p291
aVan individual site may last only 10 years or so \u2014
p292
aVas an ecosystem they've been stable for millions \u2014 well, billions \u2014 of years.
p293
aa(lp294
VDG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well.
p295
aVThere's a fish sitting here.
p296
aVHere's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm,
p297
aVwaiting for that worm to stick his head out.
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VBL: The biologists right now cannot explain
p301
aVwhy these animals are so active.
p302
aVThe worms are growing inches per week!
p303
aa(lp304
VDG: I already said that this site,
p305
aVfrom a human perspective, is toxic as hell.
p306
aVNot only that, but on top \u2014 the lifeblood \u2014
p307
aVthat plumbing system turns off every year or so.
p308
aVTheir plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move.
p309
aVAnd then there's earthquakes,
p310
aVand then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years,
p311
aVthat completely wipes the area out.
p312
aVDespite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time.
p313
aVYou're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again,
p314
aVhigher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.
p315
aVIs it sensitive? Yes.
p316
aVIs it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.
p317
aa(lp318
VI'll end up with saying one thing.
p319
aVThere's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea,
p320
aVin the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor.
p321
aVIt's an incredible story.
p322
aVWhat we see when we look back in time,
p323
aVin those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history.
p324
aVEverything on this planet \u2014 everything \u2014 works by cycles and rhythms.
p325
aVThe continents move apart. They come back together.
p326
aVOceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go.
p327
aVEl Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic.
p328
aVWhat we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony.
p329
aVIt's just like music \u2014 it really is just like music.
p330
aVAnd what we're learning now is that
p331
aVyou can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say,
p332
aV"Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today."
p333
aVIt's absurd. It's just absurd.
p334
aVSo, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going
p335
aVat all these different scales and work with it.
p336
aVLearn to manage it.
p337
aVThe concept of preservation is futile.
p338
aVConservation's tougher, but we can probably get there.
p339
aVThank you very much.
p340
aVThank you.
p341
aV(Applause)

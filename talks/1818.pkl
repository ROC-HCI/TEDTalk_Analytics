VWhen I was about three or four years old,
p5
aVI remember my mum reading a story to me
p6
aVand my two big brothers,
p7
aVand I remember putting up my hands
p8
aVto feel the page of the book,
p9
aVto feel the picture they were discussing.
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd my mum said, "Darling,
p12
aVremember that you can't see
p13
aVand you can't feel the picture
p14
aVand you can't feel the print on the page."
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd I thought to myself,
p17
aV"But that's what I want to do.
p18
aVI love stories. I want to read."
p19
aVLittle did I know
p20
aVthat I would be part of a technological revolution
p21
aVthat would make that dream come true.
p22
aa(lp23
VI was born premature by about 10 weeks,
p24
aVwhich resulted in my blindness, some 64 years ago.
p25
aVThe condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia,
p26
aVand it's now very rare in the developed world.
p27
aVLittle did I know, lying curled up
p28
aVin my prim baby humidicrib in 1948
p29
aVthat I'd been born at the right place
p30
aVand the right time,
p31
aVthat I was in a country where I could participate
p32
aVin the technological revolution.
p33
aa(lp34
VThere are 37 million totally blind people on our planet,
p35
aVbut those of us who've shared in the technological changes
p36
aVmainly come from North America, Europe,
p37
aVJapan and other developed parts of the world.
p38
aVComputers have changed the lives of us all in this room
p39
aVand around the world,
p40
aVbut I think they've changed the lives
p41
aVof we blind people more than any other group.
p42
aVAnd so I want to tell you about the interaction
p43
aVbetween computer-based adaptive technology
p44
aVand the many volunteers who helped me over the years
p45
aVto become the person I am today.
p46
aVIt's an interaction between volunteers,
p47
aVpassionate inventors and technology,
p48
aVand it's a story that many other blind people could tell.
p49
aVBut let me tell you a bit about it today.
p50
aa(lp51
VWhen I was five, I went to school and I learned braille.
p52
aVIt's an ingenious system of six dots
p53
aVthat are punched into paper,
p54
aVand I can feel them with my fingers.
p55
aVIn fact, I think they're putting up my grade six report.
p56
aVI don't know where Julian Morrow got that from.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aVI was pretty good in reading,
p59
aVbut religion and musical appreciation needed more work.
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VWhen you leave the opera house,
p63
aVyou'll find there's braille signage in the lifts.
p64
aVLook for it. Have you noticed it?
p65
aVI do. I look for it all the time.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VWhen I was at school,
p70
aVthe books were transcribed by transcribers,
p71
aVvoluntary people who punched one dot at a time
p72
aVso I'd have volumes to read,
p73
aVand that had been going on, mainly by women,
p74
aVsince the late 19th century in this country,
p75
aVbut it was the only way I could read.
p76
aVWhen I was in high school,
p77
aVI got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder,
p78
aVand tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer
p79
aVmedium of learning.
p80
aVI could have family and friends read me material,
p81
aVand I could then read it back
p82
aVas many times as I needed.
p83
aVAnd it brought me into contact
p84
aVwith volunteers and helpers.
p85
aVFor example, when I studied at graduate school
p86
aVat Queen's University in Canada,
p87
aVthe prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me.
p88
aVI gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it.
p89
aVAs one of them said to me,
p90
aV"Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment."
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VBut think of it. These men,
p95
aVwho hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had,
p96
aVhelped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law
p97
aVby their dedicated help.
p98
aa(lp99
VWell, I went back and became an academic
p100
aVat Melbourne's Monash University,
p101
aVand for those 25 years,
p102
aVtape recorders were everything to me.
p103
aVIn fact, in my office in 1990,
p104
aVI had 18 miles of tape.
p105
aVStudents, family and friends all read me material.
p106
aVMrs. Lois Doery,
p107
aVwhom I later came to call my surrogate mum,
p108
aVread me many thousands of hours onto tape.
p109
aVOne of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today
p110
aVwas that I was hoping that Lois would be here
p111
aVso I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her.
p112
aVBut sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today.
p113
aVBut I thank you here, Lois, from this platform.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VI saw my first Apple computer in 1984,
p118
aVand I thought to myself,
p119
aV"This thing's got a glass screen, not much use to me."
p120
aVHow very wrong I was.
p121
aVIn 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born,
p122
aVI got my first blind computer,
p123
aVand it's actually here.
p124
aVSee it up there?
p125
aVAnd you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aVIt's a blind computer.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVIt's a Keynote Gold 84k,
p130
aVand the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVDon't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter)
p133
aVI think there's more memory in my watch.
p134
aa(lp135
VIt was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor
p136
aVin New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.
p137
aVSadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005,
p138
aVbut his memory lives on in my heart.
p139
aVIt meant, for the first time,
p140
aVI could read back what I had typed into it.
p141
aVIt had a speech synthesizer.
p142
aVI'd written my first coauthored labor law book
p143
aVon a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory.
p144
aVThis now allowed me to read back what I'd written
p145
aVand to enter the computer world,
p146
aVeven with its 84k of memory.
p147
aa(lp148
VIn 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor,
p149
aVworked on building a machine that would scan books
p150
aVand read them out in synthetic speech.
p151
aVOptical character recognition units then
p152
aVonly operated usually on one font,
p153
aVbut by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners
p154
aVand speech synthesizers,
p155
aVhe developed a machine that could read any font.
p156
aVAnd his machine, which was as big as a washing machine,
p157
aVwas launched on the 13th of January, 1976.
p158
aVI saw my first commercially available Kurzweil
p159
aVin March 1989, and it blew me away,
p160
aVand in September 1989,
p161
aVthe month that my associate professorship
p162
aVat Monash University was announced,
p163
aVthe law school got one, and I could use it.
p164
aVFor the first time, I could read what I wanted to read
p165
aVby putting a book on the scanner.
p166
aVI didn't have to be nice to people!
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VI no longer would be censored.
p171
aVFor example, I was too shy then,
p172
aVand I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody
p173
aVto read me out loud sexually explicit material.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVBut, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and \u2014
p176
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, the Kurzweil reader is simply
p179
aVa program on my laptop.
p180
aVThat's what it's shrunk to.
p181
aVAnd now I can scan the latest novel
p182
aVand not wait to get it into talking book libraries.
p183
aVI can keep up with my friends.
p184
aa(lp185
VThere are many people who have helped me in my life,
p186
aVand many that I haven't met.
p187
aVOne is another American inventor Ted Henter.
p188
aVTed was a motorcycle racer,
p189
aVbut in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight,
p190
aVwhich is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes.
p191
aVHe then turned to being a waterskier
p192
aVand was a champion disabled waterskier.
p193
aVBut in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce
p194
aVto develop a program that would read out
p195
aVwhat was on the computer screen
p196
aVfrom the Net or from what was on the computer.
p197
aVIt's called JAWS, Job Access With Speech,
p198
aVand it sounds like this.
p199
aa(lp200
V(JAWS speaking)
p201
aa(lp202
VRon McCallum: Isn't that slow?
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aVYou see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep.
p206
aVI slowed it down for you.
p207
aVI'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it.
p208
aVCan we play that one?
p209
aa(lp210
V(JAWS speaking)
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VRM: You know, when you're marking student essays,
p215
aVyou want to get through them fairly quickly.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VThis technology that fascinated me in 1987
p220
aVis now on my iPhone and on yours as well.
p221
aVBut, you know, I find reading with machines
p222
aVa very lonely process.
p223
aVI grew up with family, friends, reading to me,
p224
aVand I loved the warmth and the breath
p225
aVand the closeness of people reading.
p226
aVDo you love being read to?
p227
aVAnd one of my most enduring memories
p228
aVis in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children
p229
aVdown near Manly Beach
p230
aV"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."
p231
aVIsn't that a great book?
p232
aVI still love being close to someone reading to me.
p233
aVBut I wouldn't give up the technology,
p234
aVbecause it's allowed me to lead a great life.
p235
aa(lp236
VOf course, talking books for the blind
p237
aVpredated all this technology.
p238
aVAfter all, the long-playing record was developed
p239
aVin the early 1930s,
p240
aVand now we put talking books on CDs
p241
aVusing the digital access system known as DAISY.
p242
aVBut when I'm reading with synthetic voices,
p243
aVI love to come home and read a racy novel
p244
aVwith a real voice.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow there are still barriers
p247
aVin front of we people with disabilities.
p248
aVMany websites we can't read using JAWS
p249
aVand the other technologies.
p250
aVWebsites are often very visual,
p251
aVand there are all these sorts of graphs
p252
aVthat aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled,
p253
aVand that's why the World Wide Web Consortium 3,
p254
aVknown as W3C, has developed worldwide standards
p255
aVfor the Internet.
p256
aVAnd we want all Internet users or Internet site owners
p257
aVto make their sites compatible so that
p258
aVwe persons without vision can have a level playing field.
p259
aVThere are other barriers brought about by our laws.
p260
aVFor example, Australia,
p261
aVlike about one third of the world's countries,
p262
aVhas copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled
p263
aVor read for we blind persons.
p264
aVBut those books can't travel across borders.
p265
aVFor example, in Spain, there are a 100,000
p266
aVaccessible books in Spanish.
p267
aVIn Argentina, there are 50,000.
p268
aVIn no other Latin American country
p269
aVare there more than a couple of thousand.
p270
aVBut it's not legal to transport the books
p271
aVfrom Spain to Latin America.
p272
aVThere are hundreds of thousands of accessible books
p273
aVin the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.,
p274
aVbut they can't be transported to the 60 countries
p275
aVin our world where English is the first and the second language.
p276
aVAnd remember I was telling you about Harry Potter.
p277
aVWell, because we can't transport books across borders,
p278
aVthere had to be separate versions read
p279
aVin all the different English-speaking countries:
p280
aVBritain, United States, Canada, Australia,
p281
aVand New Zealand all had to have
p282
aVseparate readings of Harry Potter.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd that's why, next month in Morocco,
p285
aVa meeting is taking place between all the countries.
p286
aVIt's something that a group of countries
p287
aVand the World Blind Union are advocating,
p288
aVa cross-border treaty
p289
aVso that if books are available under a copyright exception
p290
aVand the other country has a copyright exception,
p291
aVwe can transport those books across borders
p292
aVand give life to people, particularly in developing countries,
p293
aVblind people who don't have the books to read.
p294
aVI want that to happen.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Applause)
p297
aa(lp298
VMy life has been extraordinarily blessed
p299
aVwith marriage and children
p300
aVand certainly interesting work to do,
p301
aVwhether it be at the University of Sydney Law School,
p302
aVwhere I served a term as dean,
p303
aVor now as I sit on the United Nations Committee
p304
aVon the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in Geneva.
p305
aVI've indeed been a very fortunate human being.
p306
aa(lp307
VI wonder what the future will hold.
p308
aVThe technology will advance even further,
p309
aVbut I can still remember my mum saying, 60 years ago,
p310
aV"Remember, darling,
p311
aVyou'll never be able to read the print with your fingers."
p312
aVI'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers,
p313
aVvolunteer readers and passionate inventors,
p314
aVhas allowed this dream of reading to come true for me
p315
aVand for blind people throughout the world.
p316
aa(lp317
VI'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin,
p318
aVwho is my slide clicker, who clicks the slides,
p319
aVand my wife, Professor Mary Crock, who's the light of my life,
p320
aVis coming on to collect me.
p321
aVI want to thank her too.
p322
aa(lp323
VI think I have to say goodbye now.
p324
aVBless you. Thank you very much.
p325
aa(lp326

p327
aVYay! (Applause)

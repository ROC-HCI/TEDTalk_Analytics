aa(lp6
V\u266b My age is three hundred \u266b
p7
aa(lp8
V\u266b and seventy-two \u266b
p9
aa(lp10
V\u266b I think with the deepest regret \u266b
p11
aa(lp12
V\u266b How I used to pick up
p13
aa(lp14
Vand voraciously chew \u266b
p15
aa(lp16
V\u266b the dear little boys
p17
aa(lp18
Vthat I met \u266b
p19
aa(lp20
V\u266b I've eaten them raw
p21
aa(lp22
Vin their holiday suits, \u266b
p23
aa(lp24
V\u266b Eaten them
p25
aa(lp26
Vcurried with rice, \u266b
p27
aa(lp28
V\u266b I've eaten them baked
p29
aa(lp30
Vin their jackets and boots, \u266b
p31
aa(lp32
V\u266b And found them exceedingly nice. \u266b
p33
aa(lp34
V\u266b But now that my jaws
p35
aa(lp36
Vare too weak for such fare, \u266b
p37
aa(lp38
V\u266b I think it's increasingly rude \u266b
p39
aa(lp40
V\u266b To do such a thing
p41
aa(lp42
Vwhen I'm quite well aware \u266b
p43
aa(lp44
V\u266b Little boys do not like
p45
aa(lp46
Vbeing chewed. \u266b
p47
aa(lp48
V\u266b Little boys do not like
p49
aa(lp50
Vbeing chewed. \u266b
p51
aa(lp52
V(Music)
p53
aa(lp54
V\u266b So now I contentedly live upon eels, \u266b
p55
aa(lp56
V\u266b And try to do nothing amiss \u266b
p57
aa(lp58
V\u266b And pass all the time
p59
aa(lp60
VI can spare from my meals \u266b
p61
aa(lp62
V\u266b In innocent slumber like this, \u266b
p63
aa(lp64
V\u266b Innocent slumber
p65
aa(lp66
Vlike this. \u266b
p67

p69
aa(lp70
VI suppose I owe you an explanation.
p71
aVI've been working on a project for the last six years
p72
aVadapting children's poetry to music.
p73
aVAnd that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl,
p74
aVwho was a stockbroker in New York City
p75
aVfor 45 years,
p76
aVbut in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children.
p77
aVAnd this book was one of the most famous books in America
p78
aVfor about 35 years.
p79
aV"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang,
p80
aVis one of his poems.
p81
aVNow, we're going to do
p82
aVother poems for you,
p83
aVand here's a preview of some of the poets.
p84
aVThis is Rachel Field,
p85
aVRobert Graves \u2014
p86
aVa very young Robert Graves \u2014
p87
aVChristina Rossetti.
p88
aVGhosts, right?
p89
aVHave nothing to say to us,
p90
aVobsolete,
p91
aVgone \u2014
p92
aVnot so.
p93
aVWhat I really enjoyed about this project
p94
aVis reviving these people's words.
p95
aVTaking them off the dead, flat pages.
p96
aVBringing them to life,
p97
aVbringing them to light.
p98
aVSo, what we're going to do next
p99
aVis a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.
p100
aVNathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.
p101
aVWhen she was 10 years old in 1927,
p102
aVshe published her first book of poems
p103
aVcalled "The Janitor's Boy."
p104
aVHere she is.
p105
aVAnd here's her poem.
p106
aa(lp107

p108
aa(lp109
V\u266b Oh, I'm in love
p110
aa(lp111
Vwith the janitor's boy, \u266b
p112
aa(lp113
V\u266b And the janitor's boy
p114
aa(lp115
Vis in love with me. \u266b
p116
aa(lp117
V\u266b Oh, I'm in love
p118
aa(lp119
Vwith the janitor's boy, \u266b
p120
aa(lp121
V\u266b And the janitor's boy
p122
aa(lp123
Vis in love with me. \u266b
p124
aa(lp125
V\u266b He's going to hunt for a desert isle \u266b
p126
aa(lp127
V\u266b In our geography. \u266b
p128
aa(lp129
V\u266b A desert isle
p130
aa(lp131
Vwith spicy trees \u266b
p132
aa(lp133
V\u266b Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay; \u266b
p134
aa(lp135
V\u266b A right nice place,
p136
aa(lp137
Vjust fit for two \u266b
p138
aa(lp139
V\u266b Where we can live always. \u266b
p140
aa(lp141
V\u266b Oh, I'm in love
p142
aa(lp143
Vwith the janitor's boy, \u266b
p144
aa(lp145
V\u266b And the janitor's boy, \u266b
p146
aa(lp147
Vhe's busy as can be; \u266b
p148
aa(lp149
V\u266b Down in the cellar he's making a raft \u266b
p150
aa(lp151
V\u266b Out of an old settee. \u266b
p152
aa(lp153
V\u266b He'll carry me off,
p154
aa(lp155
VI know that he will, \u266b
p156
aa(lp157
V\u266b For his hair is exceedingly red; \u266b
p158
aa(lp159
V\u266b And the only thing
p160
aa(lp161
Vthat occurs to me \u266b
p162
aa(lp163
V\u266b Is to dutifully shiver in bed. \u266b
p164
aa(lp165
V\u266b And on the day that we sail,
p166
aa(lp167
VI will leave a little note \u266b
p168
aa(lp169
V\u266b For my parents I hate to annoy: \u266b

VThe next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."
p301
aVIt was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.
p302
aVShe was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter
p303
aVwho had made his fame in England.
p304
aVHe went there after the death
p305
aVof his wife of smallpox
p306
aVand brought his two young children.
p307
aVOne was his daughter, Laurence.
p308
aVShe wrote this poem when she was
p309
aV18 years old in 1888,
p310
aVand I look at it as kind of a
p311
aVvery sweet feminist manifesto
p312
aVtinged with a little bit of defiance
p313
aVand a little bit of resignation and regret.

VI became very curious about the poets
p383
aVafter spending six years with them,
p384
aVand started to research their lives,
p385
aVand then decided to write a book about it.
p386
aVAnd the burning question about Alma-Tadema
p387
aVwas: Did she marry?
p388
aVAnd the answer was no,
p389
aVwhich I found in the London Times archive.
p390
aVShe died alone in 1940
p391
aVin the company of her books and her dear friends.
p392
aVGerard Manley Hopkins,
p393
aVa saintly man.
p394
aVHe became a Jesuit.
p395
aVHe converted from his Anglican faith.
p396
aVHe was moved to by the Tractarian Movement,
p397
aVthe Oxford Movement, otherwise known as \u2014
p398
aVand he became a Jesuit priest.
p399
aVHe burned all his poetry at the age of 24
p400
aVand then did not write another poem for at least seven years
p401
aVbecause he couldn't rectify the life of a poet
p402
aVwith the life of a priest.
p403
aVHe died typhoid fever
p404
aVat the age of 44, I believe,
p405
aV43 or 44.
p406
aVAt the time, he was teaching classics
p407
aVat Trinity College in Dublin.
p408
aVA few years before he died,
p409
aVafter he had resumed writing poetry,
p410
aVbut in secret,
p411
aVhe confessed to a friend in a letter
p412
aVthat I found when I was doing my research:
p413
aV"I've written a verse.
p414
aVIt is to explain death to a child,
p415
aVand it deserves a piece of plain-song music."
p416
aVAnd my blood froze when I read that
p417
aVbecause I had written the plain-song music
p418
aV130 years after he'd written the letter.
p419
aVAnd the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."
p420
aa(lp421
V\u266b Margaret,

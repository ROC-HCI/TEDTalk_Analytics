VIf you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common:
p5
aVtheir interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface.
p6
aVThe odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVMy talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer,
p9
aVand then as a worried member of the human race.
p10
aVBut let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed
p11
aVhow we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.
p12
aVAnd what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology
p13
aVis to go back before Darwin's simple beginning,
p14
aVto set our Earth in a cosmic context.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd let me just run through a few slides.
p17
aVThis was the impact that happened last week on a comet.
p18
aVIf they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular
p19
aVthan what actually happened last Monday.
p20
aVSo that's another project for NASA.
p21
aVThat's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.
p22
aVThis artist's impression turned into reality
p23
aVwhen a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.
p24
aVIt landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.
p25
aVThat looks like a coastline.
p26
aVIt is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane \u2014
p27
aVthe temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.
p28
aVIf we go beyond our solar system,
p29
aVwe've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.
p30
aVEach one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.
p31
aVAnd we can see places where stars are forming,
p32
aVlike the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying.
p33
aVIn six billion years, the sun will look like that.
p34
aVAnd some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,
p35
aVleaving remnants like that.
p36
aa(lp37
VOn a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.
p38
aVWe see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.
p39
aVAnd to the cosmologist,
p40
aVthese galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.
p41
aVThis picture shows a patch of sky
p42
aVso small that it would take about 100 patches like it
p43
aVto cover the full moon in the sky.
p44
aVThrough a small telescope, this would look quite blank,
p45
aVbut you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.
p46
aVEach is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,
p47
aVwhich looks so small and faint because its light
p48
aVhas taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.
p49
aVThe stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.
p50
aVThere's scant chance of life there \u2014 that's because there's been no time
p51
aVfor the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron,
p52
aVthe building blocks of planets and of life.
p53
aVWe believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang \u2014
p54
aVa hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang
p55
aVturn into our complex cosmos?
p56
aa(lp57
VI'm going to show you a movie simulation
p58
aV16 powers of 10 faster than real time,
p59
aVwhich shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.
p60
aVBut you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom,
p61
aVyou will see structures evolve as gravity feeds
p62
aVon small, dense irregularities, and structures develop.
p63
aVAnd we'll end up after 13 billion years
p64
aVwith something looking rather like our own universe.
p65
aVAnd we compare simulated universes like that \u2014
p66
aVI'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk \u2014
p67
aVwith what we actually see in the sky.
p68
aVWell, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang,
p69
aVbut we still don't know what banged and why it banged.
p70
aa(lp71
VThat's a challenge for 21st-century science.
p72
aVIf my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here:
p73
aVan ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left \u2014
p74
aVthe world of the quantum \u2014 and on the right
p75
aVthe large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.
p76
aVWe know our universes are united though \u2014
p77
aVlinks between left and right.
p78
aVThe everyday world is determined by atoms,
p79
aVhow they stick together to make molecules.
p80
aVStars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.
p81
aVAnd, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together
p82
aVby the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter:
p83
aVparticles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei.
p84
aVBut we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.
p85
aVThe micro-world of the quantum is understood.
p86
aVOn the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that.
p87
aVBut the unfinished business for 21st-century science
p88
aVis to link together cosmos and micro-world
p89
aVwith a unified theory \u2014 symbolized, as it were, gastronomically
p90
aVat the top of that picture. (Laughter)
p91
aVAnd until we have that synthesis,
p92
aVwe won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe
p93
aVbecause when our universe was itself the size of an atom,
p94
aVquantum effects could shake everything.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small,
p97
aVwhich we don't yet have.
p98
aVOne idea, incidentally \u2014
p99
aVand I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on \u2014
p100
aVis that our Big Bang was not the only one.
p101
aVOne idea is that our three-dimensional universe
p102
aVmay be embedded in a high-dimensional space,
p103
aVjust as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.
p104
aVYou can imagine ants on one of them
p105
aVthinking it's a two-dimensional universe,
p106
aVnot being aware of another population of ants on the other.
p107
aVSo there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours,
p108
aVbut we're not aware of it because that millimeter
p109
aVis measured in some fourth spatial dimension,
p110
aVand we're imprisoned in our three.
p111
aVAnd so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality
p112
aVthan what we've normally called our universe \u2014
p113
aVthe aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture.
p114
aVBottom right depicts our universe,
p115
aVwhich on the horizon is not beyond that,
p116
aVbut even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.
p117
aVMany people suspect that just as we've gone from believing
p118
aVin one solar system to zillions of solar systems,
p119
aVone galaxy to many galaxies,
p120
aVwe have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang,
p121
aVperhaps these many Big Bangs displaying
p122
aVan immense variety of properties.
p123
aa(lp124
VWell, let's go back to this picture.
p125
aVThere's one challenge symbolized at the top,
p126
aVbut there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.
p127
aVYou want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small,
p128
aVbut we want to understand the very complex.
p129
aVAnd the most complex things are ourselves,
p130
aVmidway between atoms and stars.
p131
aVWe depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.
p132
aVWe depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.
p133
aVWe clearly have to be large, compared to atoms,
p134
aVto have layer upon layer of complex structure.
p135
aVWe clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets \u2014
p136
aVotherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.
p137
aVIt would take as many human bodies to make up the sun
p138
aVas there are atoms in each of us.
p139
aVThe geometric mean of the mass of a proton
p140
aVand the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms,
p141
aVwithin a factor of two of the mass of each person here.
p142
aVWell, most of you anyway.
p143
aVThe science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all,
p144
aVgreater than that of the very small on the left
p145
aVand the very large on the right.
p146
aVAnd it's this science,
p147
aVwhich is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world,
p148
aVbut also transforming our world faster than ever.
p149
aVAnd more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd I now move on to the second part of my talk,
p152
aVand the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned.
p153
aVIf I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself,
p154
aVand I would add that it's available in paperback.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd in America it was called "Our Final Hour"
p159
aVbecause Americans like instant gratification.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VBut my theme is that in this century,
p164
aVnot only has science changed the world faster than ever,
p165
aVbut in new and different ways.
p166
aVTargeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence,
p167
aVperhaps even implants into our brains,
p168
aVmay change human beings themselves. And human beings,
p169
aVtheir physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.
p170
aVIt may change this century.
p171
aVIt's new in our history.
p172
aVAnd the human impact on the global environment \u2014 greenhouse warming,
p173
aVmass extinctions and so forth \u2014 is unprecedented, too.
p174
aVAnd so, this makes this coming century a challenge.
p175
aVBio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign
p176
aVin that they offer marvelous prospects,
p177
aVwhile, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.
p178
aVBut they will have a dark side.
p179
aVIn our interconnected world, novel technology could empower
p180
aVjust one fanatic,
p181
aVor some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses,
p182
aVto trigger some kind on disaster.
p183
aVIndeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure \u2014
p184
aVerror rather than terror.
p185
aVAnd even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable
p186
aVwhen the downside could be of global consequence.
p187
aa(lp188
VIn fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article
p189
aVexpressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.
p190
aVI don't go along with all that,
p191
aVbut it's interesting that he had a simple solution.
p192
aVIt was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."
p193
aVHe wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science
p194
aVand keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.
p195
aVFirst, any scientific discovery has benign consequences
p196
aVas well as dangerous ones.
p197
aVAnd also, when a scientist makes a discovery,
p198
aVhe or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.
p199
aVAnd so what this means is that we have to accept the risks
p200
aVif we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.
p201
aVWe have to accept that there will be hazards.
p202
aVAnd I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era,
p203
aVpost-World War II, when the nuclear scientists
p204
aVwho'd been involved in making the atomic bomb,
p205
aVin many cases were concerned that they should do all they could
p206
aVto alert the world to the dangers.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd they were inspired not by the young Einstein,
p209
aVwho did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein,
p210
aVthe icon of poster and t-shirt,
p211
aVwho failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.
p212
aVHe was premature. But he was a moral compass \u2014
p213
aVan inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.
p214
aVAnd perhaps the greatest living person
p215
aVis someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.
p216
aVEqually untidy office there, as you can see.
p217
aVHe's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.
p218
aVHe persuaded Einstein, as his last act,
p219
aVto sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.
p220
aVAnd he sets an example of the concerned scientist.
p221
aVAnd I think to harness science optimally,
p222
aVto choose which doors to open and which to leave closed,
p223
aVwe need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.
p224
aa(lp225
VWe need not just campaigning physicists,
p226
aVbut we need biologists, computer experts
p227
aVand environmentalists as well.
p228
aVAnd I think academics and independent entrepreneurs
p229
aVhave a special obligation because they have more freedom
p230
aVthan those in government service,
p231
aVor company employees subject to commercial pressure.
p232
aVI wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist,
p233
aVjust a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think,
p234
aVin which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective,
p235
aVand that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.
p236
aVThe stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past
p237
aVare now part of common culture \u2014
p238
aVoutside the American Bible Belt, anyway \u2014
p239
aV(Laughter)
p240
aVbut most people, even those who are familiar with evolution,
p241
aVaren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.
p242
aa(lp243
VThe sun has been shining for four and a half billion years,
p244
aVbut it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.
p245
aVOn that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.
p246
aVAnd it'll be another six billion before that happens,
p247
aVand any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.
p248
aVThere's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there,
p249
aVexperiencing the sun's demise,
p250
aVbut any life and intelligence that exists then
p251
aVwill be as different from us as we are from bacteria.
p252
aVThe unfolding of intelligence and complexity
p253
aVstill has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.
p254
aVSo we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity
p255
aVin our Earth and beyond.
p256
aVIf you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year,
p257
aVsay from January when it was made to December,
p258
aVthe 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June \u2014
p259
aVa tiny fraction of the year.
p260
aVBut even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective,
p261
aVour century is very, very special,
p262
aVthe first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.
p263
aa(lp264
VAs I should have shown this earlier,
p265
aVit will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun;
p266
aVit will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.
p267
aVWhen Einstein died in 1955,
p268
aVone striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon
p269
aVby Herblock in the Washington Post.
p270
aVThe plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here."
p271
aVAnd I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.
p272
aVWe've been familiar for 40 years with this image:
p273
aVthe fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds,
p274
aVcontrasted with the sterile moonscape
p275
aVon which the astronauts left their footprints.
p276
aVBut let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot
p277
aVin the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years,
p278
aVbut for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.
p279
aVWhat would they have seen?
p280
aVOver nearly all that immense time,
p281
aVEarth's appearance would have changed very gradually.
p282
aVThe only abrupt worldwide change
p283
aVwould have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.
p284
aVApart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.
p285
aa(lp286
VThe continental landmasses drifted around.
p287
aVIce cover waxed and waned.
p288
aVSuccessions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.
p289
aVBut in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history,
p290
aVthe last one-millionth part, a few thousand years,
p291
aVthe patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.
p292
aVThis signaled the start of agriculture.
p293
aVChange has accelerated as human populations rose.
p294
aVThen other things happened even more abruptly.
p295
aVWithin just 50 years \u2014
p296
aVthat's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age \u2014
p297
aVthe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise,
p298
aVand ominously fast.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe planet became an intense emitter of radio waves \u2014
p301
aVthe total output from all TV and cell phones
p302
aVand radar transmissions. And something else happened.
p303
aVMetallic objects \u2014 albeit very small ones, a few tons at most \u2014
p304
aVescaped into orbit around the Earth.
p305
aVSome journeyed to the moons and planets.
p306
aVA race of advanced extraterrestrials
p307
aVwatching our solar system from afar
p308
aVcould confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.
p309
aVBut could they have predicted this unprecedented spike
p310
aVless than halfway through the Earth's life?
p311
aVThese human-induced alterations
p312
aVoccupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime
p313
aVand seemingly occurring with runaway speed?
p314
aVIf they continued their vigil,
p315
aVwhat might these hypothetical aliens witness
p316
aVin the next hundred years?
p317
aVWill some spasm foreclose Earth's future?
p318
aVOr will the biosphere stabilize?
p319
aVOr will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth
p320
aVspawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?
p321
aa(lp322
VThe science done by the young Einstein will continue
p323
aVas long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive,
p324
aVwe'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein \u2014
p325
aVhumane, global and farseeing.
p326
aVAnd whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century
p327
aVwill resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth,
p328
aVfar beyond the Earth as depicted here.
p329
aVThank you very much.

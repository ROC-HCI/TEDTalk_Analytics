VI've got a confession.
p5
aVI love looking through people's garbage.
p6
aVNow, it's not some creepy thing.
p7
aVI'm usually just looking for old electronics,
p8
aVstuff I can take to my workshop and hack.
p9
aVI do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.
p10
aVEach one's got three different motors,
p11
aVso now you can build things that move.
p12
aVThere's switches so you can turn things on and off.
p13
aVThere's even a freaking laser,
p14
aVso you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, I've built a lot of stuff out of garbage,
p17
aVand some of these things have even been kind of useful.
p18
aVBut here's the thing,
p19
aVfor me, garbage is just a chance to play,
p20
aVto be creative and build things to amuse myself.
p21
aVThis is what I love doing, so I just made it part of my day job.
p22
aVI lead a university-based biological research lab,
p23
aVwhere we value curiosity and exploration above all else.
p24
aVWe aren't focused on any particular problem,
p25
aVand we're not trying to solve any particular disease.
p26
aVThis is just a place where people can come
p27
aVand ask fascinating questions and find answers.
p28
aVAnd I realized a long time ago
p29
aVthat if I challenge people to build the equipment they need
p30
aVout of the garbage I find,
p31
aVit's a great way to foster creativity.
p32
aVAnd what happened
p33
aVwas that artists and scientists from around the world
p34
aVstarted coming to my lab.
p35
aVAnd it's not just because we value unconventional ideas,
p36
aVit's because we test and validate them
p37
aVwith scientific rigor.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo one day I was hacking something, I was taking it apart,
p40
aVand I had this sudden idea:
p41
aVCould I treat biology like hardware?
p42
aVCould I dismantle a biological system,
p43
aVmix and match the parts
p44
aVand then put it back together in some new and creative way?
p45
aVMy lab started working on this,
p46
aVand I want to show you the result.
p47
aa(lp48
VCan any of you guys tell me what fruit this is?
p49
aa(lp50
VAudience: Apple!
p51
aa(lp52
VAndrew Pelling: That's right \u2014 it's an apple.
p53
aVNow, I actually want you to notice as well
p54
aVthat this is a lot redder than most apples.
p55
aVAnd that's because we grew human cells into it.
p56
aVWe took a totally innocent Macintosh apple,
p57
aVremoved all the apple cells and DNA
p58
aVand then implanted human cells.
p59
aVAnd what we're left with after removing all the apple cells
p60
aVis this cellulose scaffold.
p61
aVThis is the stuff that gives plants their shape and texture.
p62
aVAnd these little holes that you can see,
p63
aVthis is where all the apple cells used to be.
p64
aVSo then we come along,
p65
aVwe implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue.
p66
aVWhat happens is, these guys start multiplying
p67
aVand they fill up this entire scaffold.
p68
aa(lp69
VAs weird as this is,
p70
aVit's actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized.
p71
aVAnd we found in our pre-clinical work
p72
aVthat you can implant these scaffolds into the body,
p73
aVand the body will send in cells and a blood supply
p74
aVand actually keep these things alive.
p75
aVThis is the point when people started asking me,
p76
aV"Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?"
p77
aVAnd I'm like, "You've come to the right place."
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VI actually brought this up with my wife.
p82
aVShe's a musical instrument maker,
p83
aVand she does a lot of wood carving for a living.
p84
aVSo I asked her,
p85
aV"Could you, like, literally carve some ears
p86
aVout of an apple for us?"
p87
aVAnd she did.
p88
aVSo I took her ears to the lab.
p89
aVWe then started preparing them.
p90
aVYeah, I know.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VIt's a good lab, man.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd then we grew cells on them.
p99
aVAnd this is the result.
p100
aa(lp101
VListen, my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business.
p102
aVPeople have actually been working on this for decades.
p103
aVHere's the issue:
p104
aVcommercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic,
p105
aVbecause they're sourced from proprietary products,
p106
aVanimals or cadavers.
p107
aVWe used an apple and it cost pennies.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhat's also really cool here
p110
aVis it's not that hard to make these things.
p111
aVThe equipment you need can be built from garbage,
p112
aVand the key processing step only requires soap and water.
p113
aVSo what we did was put all the instructions online as open source.
p114
aVAnd then we founded a mission-driven company,
p115
aVand we're developing kits to make it easier
p116
aVfor anyone with a sink and a soldering iron
p117
aVto make these things at home.
p118
aVWhat I'm really curious about is if one day,
p119
aVit will be possible to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies
p120
aVwith stuff we make in the kitchen.
p121
aa(lp122
VSpeaking of kitchens,
p123
aVhere's some asparagus.
p124
aVThey're tasty, and they make your pee smell funny.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VNow, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing
p129
aVthat when you look down the stalks of these asparagus,
p130
aVwhat you can see are all these tiny little vessels.
p131
aVAnd when we image them in the lab,
p132
aVyou can see how the cellulose forms these structures.
p133
aVThis image reminds me of two things:
p134
aVour blood vessels
p135
aVand the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo here's the question:
p138
aVCan we grow axons and neurons down these channels?
p139
aVBecause if we can,
p140
aVthen maybe we can use asparagus to form new connections
p141
aVbetween the ends of damaged and severed nerves.
p142
aVOr maybe even a spinal cord.
p143
aVDon't get me wrong \u2014
p144
aVthis is exceptionally challenging
p145
aVand really hard work to do,
p146
aVand we are not the only ones working on this.
p147
aVBut we are the only ones using asparagus.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VRight now, we've got really promising pilot data.
p152
aVAnd we're working with tissue engineers
p153
aVand neurosurgeons
p154
aVto find out what's actually possible.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo listen, all of the work I've shown you,
p157
aVthe stuff that I've built that's all around me on this stage
p158
aVand the other projects my lab is involved in
p159
aVare all a direct result of me playing with your garbage.
p160
aVPlay \u2014 play is a key part of my scientific practice.
p161
aVIt's how I train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative
p162
aVand to decide to make human apple ears.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo, the next time any of you are looking at some old,
p165
aVbroken-down, malfunctioning, piece-of-crap technology,
p166
aVI want you to think of me.
p167
aVBecause I want it.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VSeriously, please find any way to get in touch with me,
p172
aVand let's see what we can build.
p173
aa(lp174
VThank you.

VI'm Ellen and I'm totally obsessed with food.
p5
aVBut I didn't start out obsessed with food.
p6
aVI started out obsessed with global security policy,
p7
aVbecause I lived in New York during 9/11 and it was a very relevant thing.
p8
aVI got from global security policy to food
p9
aVbecause I realized when I'm hungry, I'm really pissed off,
p10
aVand I'm assuming the rest of the world is too.
p11
aVEspecially if you and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry
p12
aVand your whole neighborhood is hungry.
p13
aVAnd actually, it looks like the areas of the world that are hungry
p14
aVare also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo I took a job at the United Nations World Food Programme
p17
aVas a way to try to address these security issues
p18
aVthrough food security issues.
p19
aVThere, I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs.
p20
aVIt's called School Feeding and it's a really simple idea
p21
aVto get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger
p22
aVthat continues for a lot of people around the world, and stop it.
p23
aVA free school meal gets kids into school,
p24
aVwhich is education, the first step out of poverty,
p25
aVbut it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need
p26
aVto develop mentally and physically.
p27
aa(lp28
VWhile I was working at the UN, I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.
p29
aVAnd she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag, called the "Feed Bag" \u2014
p30
aVwhich is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag.
p31
aVBut each bag we'd sell would provide
p32
aVa year's worth of school meals for one kid.
p33
aVIt's so simple, and we thought, OK,
p34
aVit costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year.
p35
aVWe could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and awareness
p36
aVfor the World Food Programme.
p37
aVBut at the UN, sometimes things move slowly
p38
aVand they basically said no.
p39
aVAnd we thought, this is such a good idea, it's going to raise so much money.
p40
aVSo we said screw it, we'll start our own company,
p41
aVwhich we did, three years ago.
p42
aVThat was my first dream, to start this company called FEED,
p43
aVand here's a screenshot of our website.
p44
aVWe did a bag for Haiti just a month after the earthquake
p45
aVto provide school meals for kids in Haiti.
p46
aVSo FEED's doing great.
p47
aVWe've so far provided 55 million meals to kids around the world
p48
aVby selling now 550,000 bags, a ton of bags, a lot of bags.
p49
aa(lp50
VAll this time you're really \u2014
p51
aVhunger is a hard thing to think about,
p52
aVbecause what we think about is eating.
p53
aVI think about eating a lot and I really love it.
p54
aVAnd the thing that's strange about international hunger
p55
aVand talking about international issues
p56
aVis that most people want to know:
p57
aV"What are you doing for America's kids?"
p58
aVThere's definitely hunger in America:
p59
aV49 million people and almost 16.7 million children.
p60
aVI mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country.
p61
aVHunger definitely means something different in America
p62
aVthan it does internationally,
p63
aVbut it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country.
p64
aVBut the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity,
p65
aVand it's dramatic.
p66
aVThe other thing that's dramatic
p67
aVis that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last 30 years.
p68
aVUnfortunately, obesity's not only an American problem.
p69
aVIt's actually been spreading all around the world
p70
aVand mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting.
p71
aVThe numbers are pretty crazy.
p72
aVThere's a billion people obese or overweight
p73
aVand a billion people hungry.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo those seem like two bifurcated problems,
p76
aVbut I kind of started to think about, you know,
p77
aVwhat is obesity and hunger?
p78
aVWhat are both those things about?
p79
aVWell, they're both about food.
p80
aVAnd when you think about food,
p81
aVthe underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture.
p82
aVAnd agriculture is where food comes from.
p83
aVAgriculture in America's very interesting.
p84
aVIt's very consolidated
p85
aVand the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat.
p86
aVThe foods that are produced are, more or less, corn, soy and wheat.
p87
aVAnd that's three-quarters of the food that we're eating:
p88
aVprocessed foods and fast foods.
p89
aVUnfortunately, in our agricultural system,
p90
aVwe haven't done a good job in the last three decades
p91
aVof exporting those technologies around the world.
p92
aVSo African agriculture, which is the place of most hunger in the world,
p93
aVhas actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen.
p94
aVSo somehow we're not making the connect
p95
aVbetween exporting a good agricultural system
p96
aVthat will help feed people all around the world.
p97
aa(lp98
VWho is farming? That's what I was wondering.
p99
aVSo I went and stood on a big grain bin in the Midwest,
p100
aVand that really didn't help me understand farming,
p101
aVbut I think it's a really cool picture.
p102
aVAnd the reality is that between farmers in America \u2014
p103
aVwho actually, quite frankly, when I spend time in the Midwest,
p104
aVare pretty large in general.
p105
aVAnd their farms are also large.
p106
aVBut farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny,
p107
aVand that's because they're starving.
p108
aVMost hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers.
p109
aVAnd most of those people are women \u2014
p110
aVwhich is a totally other topic that I won't get on right now,
p111
aVbut I'd love to do the feminist thing at some point.
p112
aVI think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides.
p113
aVThere's this large, consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America,
p114
aVand it's really been since around 1980, after the oil crisis,
p115
aVwhen, you know \u2014 mass consolidation,
p116
aVmass exodus of small farmers in this country.
p117
aVAnd then in the same time period,
p118
aVwe've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing.
p119
aVUnfortunately, what is farmed ends up as what we eat.
p120
aVAnd in America, a lot of what we eat has led to obesity
p121
aVand has led to a real change
p122
aVin sort of what our diet is, in the last 30 years.
p123
aa(lp124
VIt's crazy.
p125
aVA fifth of kids under two drinks soda.
p126
aVHello! You don't put soda in bottles.
p127
aVBut people do, because it's so cheap,
p128
aVand so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shifted.
p129
aVI mean, you know, it's not just in our own country,
p130
aVbut really we're exporting the system around the world,
p131
aVand when you look at the data of least developed countries \u2014
p132
aVespecially in cities, which are growing really rapidly \u2014
p133
aVpeople are eating American processed foods.
p134
aVAnd in one generation, they're going from hunger
p135
aVand all of the detrimental health effects of hunger
p136
aVto obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation.
p137
aVSo the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity.
p138
aVNot to beat a dead horse, but this is a global food system
p139
aVwhere there's a billion people hungry and a billion people obese.
p140
aVI think that's the only way to look at it.
p141
aVAnd instead of taking these two things
p142
aVas bifurcated problems that are very separate,
p143
aVit's really important to look at them as one system.
p144
aVWe get a lot of our food from all around the world
p145
aVand people from all around the world are importing our food system,
p146
aVso it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it.
p147
aa(lp148
VI've learned \u2014 and the technology people here,
p149
aVwhich I'm totally not one of \u2014
p150
aVbut apparently, it really takes 30 years
p151
aVfor a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us,
p152
aVlike the mouse and the Internet and Windows.
p153
aVYou know, there's 30-year cycles.
p154
aVI think 2010 can be a really interesting year
p155
aVbecause it is the end of the 30-year cycle,
p156
aVand it's the birthday of the global food system.
p157
aVThat's the first birthday I want to talk about.
p158
aVIf we really think that this is something that's happened in the last 30 years,
p159
aVthere's hope in that.
p160
aVIt's the 30th anniversary of GMO crops
p161
aVand the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets, high-fructose corn syrup,
p162
aVthe farm crisis in America
p163
aVand the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally.
p164
aVSo there's a lot of reasons to take this 30-year time period
p165
aVas sort of the creation of this new food system.
p166
aVI'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole 30-year thing.
p167
aVThe icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish
p168
aVboth addressed this last three-decade time period
p169
aVas incredibly relevant for food system change.
p170
aVWell, I really care about 1980
p171
aVbecause it's also the 30th anniversary of me this year.
p172
aVAnd so in my lifetime,
p173
aVa lot of what's happened in the world \u2014
p174
aVand being a person obsessed with food \u2014
p175
aVa lot of this has really changed.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo my second dream is that I think we can look to the next 30 years
p178
aVas a time to change the food system again.
p179
aVAnd we know what's happened in the past,
p180
aVso if we start now and we look at technologies
p181
aVand improvements to the food system long-term,
p182
aVwe might be able to recreate the food system
p183
aVso when I give my next talk and I'm 60 years old,
p184
aVI'll be able to say that it's been a success.
p185
aVSo I'm announcing today the start of a new organization,
p186
aVor a new fund within the FEED Foundation, called the 30 Project.
p187
aVAnd the 30 Project is really focused
p188
aVon these long-term ideas for food system change.
p189
aVAnd I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger
p190
aVand domestic advocates that are addressing obesity,
p191
aVwe might actually look for long-term solutions
p192
aVthat will make the food system better for everyone.
p193
aa(lp194
VWe all tend to think that these systems are quite different
p195
aVand people argue whether or not organic can feed the world,
p196
aVbut if we take a 30-year view, there's more hope in collaborative ideas.
p197
aVSo I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations
p198
aVlike the ONE campaign and Slow Food,
p199
aVwhich don't seem right now to have much in common,
p200
aVwe can talk about holistic, long-term, systemic solutions
p201
aVthat will improve food for everyone.
p202
aVSome ideas I've had is like, look, the reality is \u2014
p203
aVkids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots
p204
aVand so do kids in Botswana.
p205
aVAnd how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods?
p206
aa(lp207
VAnother thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish.
p208
aVUnderstanding how to produce protein
p209
aVin a way that's healthy for the environment
p210
aVand healthy for people
p211
aVwill be incredibly important to address things like climate change
p212
aVand how we use petrochemical fertilizers.
p213
aVAnd, you know, these are really relevant topics
p214
aVthat are long-term and important
p215
aVfor both people in Africa who are small farmers
p216
aVand people in America who are farmers and eaters.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way,
p219
aVwhere we actually price the negative externalities
p220
aVlike petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff
p221
aVinto the price of a bag of chips \u2014
p222
aVWell, if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple,
p223
aVthen maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice
p224
aVbecause the choices are actually choices
p225
aVinstead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn, soy and wheat.
p226
aa(lp227
VThe 30Project.org is launched
p228
aVand I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start.
p229
aVAnd it'll be growing over the next few months.
p230
aVBut I really hope that you will all think of ways
p231
aVthat you can look long-term at things like the food system
p232
aVand make change.

VYou all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
p5
aVI think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive
p6
aVhas been around since before the French Revolution.
p7
aVWhat's changed
p8
aVis we now can look at the evidence,
p9
aVwe can compare societies, more and less equal societies,
p10
aVand see what inequality does.
p11
aVI'm going to take you through that data
p12
aVand then explain why
p13
aVthe links I'm going to be showing you exist.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut first, see what a miserable lot we are.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVI want to start though
p18
aVwith a paradox.
p19
aVThis shows you life expectancy
p20
aVagainst gross national income \u2014
p21
aVhow rich countries are on average.
p22
aVAnd you see the countries on the right,
p23
aVlike Norway and the USA,
p24
aVare twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
p25
aVAnd it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
p26
aVThere's no suggestion of a relationship there.
p27
aVBut if we look within our societies,
p28
aVthere are extraordinary social gradients in health
p29
aVrunning right across society.
p30
aVThis, again, is life expectancy.
p31
aa(lp32
VThese are small areas of England and Wales \u2014
p33
aVthe poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
p34
aVA lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
p35
aVEven the people just below the top
p36
aVhave less good health
p37
aVthan the people at the top.
p38
aVSo income means something very important
p39
aVwithin our societies,
p40
aVand nothing between them.
p41
aVThe explanation of that paradox
p42
aVis that, within our societies,
p43
aVwe're looking at relative income
p44
aVor social position, social status \u2014
p45
aVwhere we are in relation to each other
p46
aVand the size of the gaps between us.
p47
aVAnd as soon as you've got that idea,
p48
aVyou should immediately wonder:
p49
aVwhat happens if we widen the differences,
p50
aVor compress them,
p51
aVmake the income differences bigger or smaller?
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd that's what I'm going to show you.
p54
aVI'm not using any hypothetical data.
p55
aVI'm taking data from the U.N. \u2014
p56
aVit's the same as the World Bank has \u2014
p57
aVon the scale of income differences
p58
aVin these rich developed market democracies.
p59
aVThe measure we've used,
p60
aVbecause it's easy to understand and you can download it,
p61
aVis how much richer the top 20 percent
p62
aVthan the bottom 20 percent in each country.
p63
aVAnd you see in the more equal countries on the left \u2014
p64
aVJapan, Finland, Norway, Sweden \u2014
p65
aVthe top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich
p66
aVas the bottom 20 percent.
p67
aVBut on the more unequal end \u2014
p68
aVU.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore \u2014
p69
aVthe differences are twice as big.
p70
aVOn that measure, we are twice as unequal
p71
aVas some of the other successful market democracies.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
p74
aVWe collected data on problems with social gradients,
p75
aVthe kind of problems that are more common
p76
aVat the bottom of the social ladder.
p77
aVInternationally comparable data on life expectancy,
p78
aVon kids' maths and literacy scores,
p79
aVon infant mortality rates, homicide rates,
p80
aVproportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates,
p81
aVlevels of trust,
p82
aVobesity, mental illness \u2014
p83
aVwhich in standard diagnostic classification
p84
aVincludes drug and alcohol addiction \u2014
p85
aVand social mobility.
p86
aVWe put them all in one index.
p87
aVThey're all weighted equally.
p88
aVWhere a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
p89
aVAnd there, you see it
p90
aVin relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you,
p91
aVwhich I shall use over and over again in the data.
p92
aVThe more unequal countries
p93
aVare doing worse
p94
aVon all these kinds of social problems.
p95
aVIt's an extraordinarily close correlation.
p96
aVBut if you look at that same index
p97
aVof health and social problems
p98
aVin relation to GNP per capita,
p99
aVgross national income,
p100
aVthere's nothing there,
p101
aVno correlation anymore.
p102
aa(lp103
VWe were a little bit worried
p104
aVthat people might think
p105
aVwe'd been choosing problems to suit our argument
p106
aVand just manufactured this evidence,
p107
aVso we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal
p108
aVon the UNICEF index of child well-being.
p109
aVIt has 40 different components
p110
aVput together by other people.
p111
aVIt contains whether kids can talk to their parents,
p112
aVwhether they have books at home,
p113
aVwhat immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
p114
aVEverything goes into it.
p115
aVHere it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
p116
aVKids do worse in the more unequal societies.
p117
aVHighly significant relationship.
p118
aVBut once again,
p119
aVif you look at that measure of child well-being,
p120
aVin relation to national income per person,
p121
aVthere's no relationship,
p122
aVno suggestion of a relationship.
p123
aa(lp124
VWhat all the data I've shown you so far says
p125
aVis the same thing.
p126
aVThe average well-being of our societies
p127
aVis not dependent any longer
p128
aVon national income and economic growth.
p129
aVThat's very important in poorer countries,
p130
aVbut not in the rich developed world.
p131
aVBut the differences between us
p132
aVand where we are in relation to each other
p133
aVnow matter very much.
p134
aVI'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
p135
aVHere, for instance, is trust.
p136
aVIt's simply the proportion of the population
p137
aVwho agree most people can be trusted.
p138
aVIt comes from the World Values Survey.
p139
aVYou see, at the more unequal end,
p140
aVit's about 15 percent of the population
p141
aVwho feel they can trust others.
p142
aVBut in the more equal societies,
p143
aVit rises to 60 or 65 percent.
p144
aVAnd if you look at measures of involvement in community life
p145
aVor social capital,
p146
aVvery similar relationships
p147
aVclosely related to inequality.
p148
aa(lp149
VI may say, we did all this work twice.
p150
aVWe did it first on these rich, developed countries,
p151
aVand then as a separate test bed,
p152
aVwe repeated it all on the 50 American states \u2014
p153
aVasking just the same question:
p154
aVdo the more unequal states
p155
aVdo worse on all these kinds of measures?
p156
aVSo here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government
p157
aVrelated to inequality.
p158
aVVery similar scatter
p159
aVover a similar range of levels of trust.
p160
aVSame thing is going on.
p161
aVBasically we found
p162
aVthat almost anything that's related to trust internationally
p163
aVis related to trust amongst the 50 states
p164
aVin that separate test bed.
p165
aVWe're not just talking about a fluke.
p166
aa(lp167
VThis is mental illness.
p168
aVWHO put together figures
p169
aVusing the same diagnostic interviews
p170
aVon random samples of the population
p171
aVto allow us to compare rates of mental illness
p172
aVin each society.
p173
aVThis is the percent of the population
p174
aVwith any mental illness in the preceding year.
p175
aVAnd it goes from about eight percent
p176
aVup to three times that \u2014
p177
aVwhole societies
p178
aVwith three times the level of mental illness of others.
p179
aVAnd again, closely related to inequality.
p180
aa(lp181
VThis is violence.
p182
aVThese red dots are American states,
p183
aVand the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
p184
aVBut look at the scale of the differences.
p185
aVIt goes from 15 homicides per million
p186
aVup to 150.
p187
aVThis is the proportion of the population in prison.
p188
aVThere's a about a tenfold difference there,
p189
aVlog scale up the side.
p190
aVBut it goes from about 40 to 400
p191
aVpeople in prison.
p192
aVThat relationship
p193
aVis not mainly driven by more crime.
p194
aVIn some places, that's part of it.
p195
aVBut most of it is about more punitive sentencing,
p196
aVharsher sentencing.
p197
aVAnd the more unequal societies
p198
aVare more likely also to retain the death penalty.
p199
aVHere we have children dropping out of high school.
p200
aVAgain, quite big differences.
p201
aVExtraordinarily damaging,
p202
aVif you're talking about using the talents of the population.
p203
aa(lp204
VThis is social mobility.
p205
aVIt's actually a measure of mobility
p206
aVbased on income.
p207
aVBasically, it's asking:
p208
aVdo rich fathers have rich sons
p209
aVand poor fathers have poor sons,
p210
aVor is there no relationship between the two?
p211
aVAnd at the more unequal end,
p212
aVfathers' income is much more important \u2014
p213
aVin the U.K., USA.
p214
aVAnd in Scandinavian countries,
p215
aVfathers' income is much less important.
p216
aVThere's more social mobility.
p217
aVAnd as we like to say \u2014
p218
aVand I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here \u2014
p219
aVif Americans want to live the American dream,
p220
aVthey should go to Denmark.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
V(Applause)
p225
aa(lp226
VI've shown you just a few things in italics here.
p227
aVI could have shown a number of other problems.
p228
aVThey're all problems that tend to be more common
p229
aVat the bottom of the social gradient.
p230
aVBut there are endless problems with social gradients
p231
aVthat are worse in more unequal countries \u2014
p232
aVnot just a little bit worse,
p233
aVbut anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
p234
aVThink of the expense,
p235
aVthe human cost of that.
p236
aa(lp237
VI want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier
p238
aVwhere we put it all together
p239
aVto make two points.
p240
aVOne is that, in graph after graph,
p241
aVwe find the countries that do worse,
p242
aVwhatever the outcome,
p243
aVseem to be the more unequal ones,
p244
aVand the ones that do well
p245
aVseem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
p246
aVSo what we're looking at
p247
aVis general social disfunction related to inequality.
p248
aVIt's not just one or two things that go wrong,
p249
aVit's most things.
p250
aa(lp251
VThe other really important point I want to make on this graph
p252
aVis that, if you look at the bottom,
p253
aVSweden and Japan,
p254
aVthey're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
p255
aVThe position of women,
p256
aVhow closely they keep to the nuclear family,
p257
aVare on opposite ends of the poles
p258
aVin terms of the rich developed world.
p259
aVBut another really important difference
p260
aVis how they get their greater equality.
p261
aVSweden has huge differences in earnings,
p262
aVand it narrows the gap through taxation,
p263
aVgeneral welfare state,
p264
aVgenerous benefits and so on.
p265
aVJapan is rather different though.
p266
aVIt starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
p267
aVIt has lower taxes.
p268
aVIt has a smaller welfare state.
p269
aVAnd in our analysis of the American states,
p270
aVwe find rather the same contrast.
p271
aVThere are some states that do well through redistribution,
p272
aVsome states that do well
p273
aVbecause they have smaller income differences before tax.
p274
aVSo we conclude
p275
aVthat it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality,
p276
aVas long as you get there somehow.
p277
aa(lp278
VI am not talking about perfect equality,
p279
aVI'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
p280
aVAnother really surprising part of this picture
p281
aVis that it's not just the poor
p282
aVwho are affected by inequality.
p283
aVThere seems to be some truth in John Donne's
p284
aV"No man is an island."
p285
aVAnd in a number of studies, it's possible to compare
p286
aVhow people do in more and less equal countries
p287
aVat each level in the social hierarchy.
p288
aVThis is just one example.
p289
aVIt's infant mortality.
p290
aVSome Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths
p291
aVaccording to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
p292
aVAnd so it's anachronistically
p293
aVa classification by fathers' occupations,
p294
aVso single parents go on their own.
p295
aVBut then where it says "low social class,"
p296
aVthat's unskilled manual occupations.
p297
aVIt goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle,
p298
aVthen the junior non-manual,
p299
aVgoing up high to the professional occupations \u2014
p300
aVdoctors, lawyers,
p301
aVdirectors of larger companies.
p302
aa(lp303
VYou see there that Sweden does better than Britain
p304
aVall the way across the social hierarchy.
p305
aVThe biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
p306
aVBut even at the top,
p307
aVthere seems to be a small benefit
p308
aVto being in a more equal society.
p309
aVWe show that on about five different sets of data
p310
aVcovering educational outcomes
p311
aVand health in the United States and internationally.
p312
aVAnd that seems to be the general picture \u2014
p313
aVthat greater equality makes most difference at the bottom,
p314
aVbut has some benefits even at the top.
p315
aa(lp316
VBut I should say a few words about what's going on.
p317
aVI think I'm looking and talking
p318
aVabout the psychosocial effects of inequality.
p319
aVMore to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority,
p320
aVof being valued and devalued,
p321
aVrespected and disrespected.
p322
aVAnd of course, those feelings
p323
aVof the status competition that comes out of that
p324
aVdrives the consumerism in our society.
p325
aVIt also leads to status insecurity.
p326
aVWe worry more about how we're judged and seen by others,
p327
aVwhether we're regarded as attractive, clever,
p328
aVall that kind of thing.
p329
aVThe social-evaluative judgments increase,
p330
aVthe fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
p331
aa(lp332
VInterestingly,
p333
aVsome parallel work going on in social psychology:
p334
aVsome people reviewed 208 different studies
p335
aVin which volunteers had been invited
p336
aVinto a psychological laboratory
p337
aVand had their stress hormones,
p338
aVtheir responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
p339
aVAnd in the review,
p340
aVwhat they were interested in seeing
p341
aVis what kind of stresses
p342
aVmost reliably raise levels of cortisol,
p343
aVthe central stress hormone.
p344
aVAnd the conclusion was
p345
aVit was tasks that included social-evaluative threat \u2014
p346
aVthreats to self-esteem or social status
p347
aVin which others can negatively judge your performance.
p348
aVThose kind of stresses
p349
aVhave a very particular effect
p350
aVon the physiology of stress.
p351
aa(lp352
VNow we have been criticized.
p353
aVOf course, there are people who dislike this stuff
p354
aVand people who find it very surprising.
p355
aVI should tell you though
p356
aVthat when people criticize us for picking and choosing data,
p357
aVwe never pick and choose data.
p358
aVWe have an absolute rule
p359
aVthat if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at,
p360
aVit goes into the analysis.
p361
aVOur data source decides
p362
aVwhether it's reliable data,
p363
aVwe don't.
p364
aVOtherwise that would introduce bias.
p365
aa(lp366
VWhat about other countries?
p367
aVThere are 200 studies
p368
aVof health in relation to income and equality
p369
aVin the academic peer-reviewed journals.
p370
aVThis isn't confined to these countries here,
p371
aVhiding a very simple demonstration.
p372
aVThe same countries,
p373
aVthe same measure of inequality,
p374
aVone problem after another.
p375
aVWhy don't we control for other factors?
p376
aVWell we've shown you that GNP per capita
p377
aVdoesn't make any difference.
p378
aVAnd of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature
p379
aVhave controlled for poverty and education
p380
aVand so on.
p381
aa(lp382
VWhat about causality?
p383
aVCorrelation in itself doesn't prove causality.
p384
aVWe spend a good bit of time.
p385
aVAnd indeed, people know the causal links quite well
p386
aVin some of these outcomes.
p387
aVThe big change in our understanding
p388
aVof drivers of chronic health
p389
aVin the rich developed world
p390
aVis how important chronic stress from social sources
p391
aVis affecting the immune system,
p392
aVthe cardiovascular system.
p393
aVOr for instance, the reason why violence
p394
aVbecomes more common in more unequal societies
p395
aVis because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
p396
aa(lp397
VI should say that to deal with this,
p398
aVwe've got to deal with the post-tax things
p399
aVand the pre-tax things.
p400
aVWe've got to constrain income,
p401
aVthe bonus culture incomes at the top.
p402
aVI think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees
p403
aVin any way we can.
p404
aVI think the take-home message though
p405
aVis that we can improve the real quality of human life
p406
aVby reducing the differences in incomes between us.
p407
aVSuddenly we have a handle
p408
aVon the psychosocial well-being of whole societies,
p409
aVand that's exciting.
p410
aa(lp411

VIn the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said,
p5
aV"People protect what they love,"
p6
aVI want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean,
p7
aVand that's the incredible number and variety
p8
aVof animals in it that make light.
p9
aa(lp10
VMy addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp;
p11
aVthat's not an acronym \u2014 just somebody thought it looked like the insect.
p12
aVIt was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry
p13
aVfor diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.
p14
aVRight after I completed my Ph.D.,
p15
aVI was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists
p16
aVthat was using it for the first time
p17
aVas a tool for ocean exploration.
p18
aVWe trained in a tank in Port Hueneme,
p19
aVand then my first open ocean dive
p20
aVwas in Santa Barbara Channel.
p21
aVIt was an evening dive.
p22
aVI went down to a depth of 880 feet
p23
aVand turned out the lights.
p24
aVAnd the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see
p25
aVthis phenomenon of animals making light
p26
aVcalled bioluminescence.
p27
aVBut I was totally unprepared
p28
aVfor how much there was
p29
aVand how spectacular it was.
p30
aVI saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores
p31
aVthat were longer than this room,
p32
aVpumping out so much light
p33
aVthat I could read the dials and gauges
p34
aVinside the suit without a flashlight;
p35
aVand puffs and billows
p36
aVof what looked like luminous blue smoke;
p37
aVand explosions of sparks
p38
aVthat would swirl up out of the thrusters \u2014
p39
aVjust like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire,
p40
aVbut these were icy, blue embers.
p41
aVIt was breathtaking.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all,
p44
aVit's these guys; it's fireflies.
p45
aVAnd there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light \u2014
p46
aVsome insects, earthworms, fungi \u2014
p47
aVbut in general, on land, it's really rare.
p48
aVIn the ocean, it's the rule
p49
aVrather than the exception.
p50
aVIf I go out in the open ocean environment,
p51
aVvirtually anywhere in the world,
p52
aVand I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface,
p53
aVmost of the animals \u2014
p54
aVin fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent
p55
aVof the animals that I bring up in that net \u2014
p56
aVmake light.
p57
aVThis makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow I want to share with you a little video
p60
aVthat I shot from a submersible.
p61
aVI first developed this technique working from a little
p62
aVsingle-person submersible called Deep Rover
p63
aVand then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link,
p64
aVwhich you see here.
p65
aVSo, mounted in front of the observation sphere,
p66
aVthere's a a three-foot diameter hoop
p67
aVwith a screen stretched across it.
p68
aVAnd inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera
p69
aVthat's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye,
p70
aValbeit a little fuzzy.
p71
aVSo you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.
p72
aVThat sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence,
p73
aVthat's just electronic noise
p74
aVon these super intensified cameras.
p75
aVYou don't see luminescence until the submersible
p76
aVbegins to move forward through the water,
p77
aVbut as it does, animals bumping into the screen
p78
aVare stimulated to bioluminesce.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, when I was first doing this,
p81
aVall I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.
p82
aVI knew my forward speed, I knew the area,
p83
aVand so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources
p84
aVthere were per cubic meter.
p85
aVBut I started to realize that I could actually identify animals
p86
aVby the type of flashes they produced.
p87
aVAnd so, here, in the Gulf of Maine
p88
aVat 740 feet,
p89
aVI can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level.
p90
aVLike those big explosions, sparks,
p91
aVare from a little comb jelly,
p92
aVand there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans,
p93
aVand jellyfish.
p94
aVThere was another one of those comb jellies.
p95
aVAnd so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers
p96
aVto develop automatic recognition systems
p97
aVthat can identify these animals
p98
aVand then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.
p99
aVAnd we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land,
p100
aVand do nearest neighbor distances.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean
p103
aVto see a light show like this.
p104
aVYou can actually see it in surface waters.
p105
aVThis is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution,
p106
aVof a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton.
p107
aVAnd this isn't someplace exotic
p108
aVlike one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico,
p109
aVthis was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.
p110
aVAnd sometimes you can see it even closer than that,
p111
aVbecause the heads on ships \u2014
p112
aVthat's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening \u2014
p113
aVare flushed with unfiltered seawater
p114
aVthat often has bioluminescent plankton in it.
p115
aVSo, if you stagger into the head late at night
p116
aVand you're so toilet-hugging sick
p117
aVthat you forget to turn on the light,
p118
aVyou may think that you're having a religious experience. (Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, how does a living creature make light?
p121
aVWell, that was the question that 19th century
p122
aVFrench physiologist Raphael Dubois,
p123
aVasked about this bioluminescent clam.
p124
aVHe ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals;
p125
aVone, the enzyme, he called luciferase;
p126
aVthe substrate, he called luciferin
p127
aVafter Lucifer the Lightbearer.
p128
aVThat terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals
p129
aVbecause these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.
p130
aVIn fact, most of the people
p131
aVstudying bioluminescence today
p132
aVare focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals
p133
aVhave proved so incredibly valuable
p134
aVfor developing antibacterial agents,
p135
aVcancer fighting drugs,
p136
aVtesting for the presence of life on Mars,
p137
aVdetecting pollutants in our waters \u2014
p138
aVwhich is how we use it at ORCA.
p139
aVIn 2008,
p140
aVthe Nobel Prize in Chemistry
p141
aVwas awarded for work done
p142
aVon a molecule called green fluorescent protein
p143
aVthat was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry
p144
aVof a jellyfish,
p145
aVand it's been equated to the invention of the microscope,
p146
aVin terms of the impact that it has had
p147
aVon cell biology and genetic engineering.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnother thing all these molecules are telling us
p150
aVthat, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved
p151
aVat least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times
p152
aVin evolutionary history,
p153
aVwhich is a clear indication
p154
aVof how spectacularly important
p155
aVthis trait is for survival.
p156
aVSo, what is it about bioluminescence
p157
aVthat's so important to so many animals?
p158
aVWell, for animals that are trying to avoid predators
p159
aVby staying in the darkness,
p160
aVlight can still be very useful
p161
aVfor the three basic things that animals have to do to survive:
p162
aVand that's find food,
p163
aVattract a mate and avoid being eaten.
p164
aVSo, for example, this fish
p165
aVhas a built-in headlight behind its eye
p166
aVthat it can use for finding food
p167
aVor attracting a mate.
p168
aVAnd then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head
p169
aVjust like the headlights on your Lamborghini.
p170
aVThis fish actually has high beams.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd this fish, which is one of my favorites,
p173
aVhas three headlights on each side of its head.
p174
aVNow, this one is blue,
p175
aVand that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean
p176
aVbecause evolution has selected
p177
aVfor the color that travels farthest through seawater
p178
aVin order to optimize communication.
p179
aVSo, most animals make blue light,
p180
aVand most animals can only see blue light,
p181
aVbut this fish is a really fascinating exception
p182
aVbecause it has two red light organs.
p183
aVAnd I have no idea why there's two,
p184
aVand that's something I want to solve some day \u2014
p185
aVbut not only can it see blue light,
p186
aVbut it can see red light.
p187
aVSo it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope
p188
aVto be able to sneak up on animals
p189
aVthat are blind to red light
p190
aVand be able to see them without being seen.
p191
aVIt's also got a little chin barbel here
p192
aVwith a blue luminescent lure on it
p193
aVthat it can use to attract prey from a long way off.
p194
aVAnd a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.
p195
aa(lp196
VThis is another one of my favorite fish.
p197
aVThis is a viperfish, and it's got a lure
p198
aVon the end of a long fishing rod
p199
aVthat it arches in front of the toothy jaw
p200
aVthat gives the viperfish its name.
p201
aVThe teeth on this fish are so long
p202
aVthat if they closed inside the mouth of the fish,
p203
aVit would actually impale its own brain.
p204
aVSo instead, it slides in grooves
p205
aVon the outside of the head.
p206
aVThis is a Christmas tree of a fish;
p207
aVeverything on this fish lights up,
p208
aVit's not just that lure.
p209
aVIt's got a built-in flashlight.
p210
aVIt's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly
p211
aVthat it uses for a type of camouflage
p212
aVthat obliterates its shadow,
p213
aVso when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below,
p214
aVit makes itself disappear.
p215
aVIt's got light organs in the mouth,
p216
aVit's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins,
p217
aVin a mucus layer on the back and the belly,
p218
aVall used for different things \u2014
p219
aVsome of which we know about, some of which we don't.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar,
p222
aVand I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing
p223
aVmy favorite topic with so many people.
p224
aVI do wish, with their budget,
p225
aVthat they might have spent just a tiny bit more money
p226
aVto pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student,
p227
aVwho could have told them that those are the eyes
p228
aVof a fish that's been preserved in formalin.
p229
aVThese are the eyes of a living anglerfish.
p230
aVSo, she's got a lure that she sticks out
p231
aVin front of this living mousetrap
p232
aVof needle-sharp teeth
p233
aVin order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.
p234
aVAnd this one has a lure
p235
aVwith all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow we used to think that the different shape of the lure
p238
aVwas to attract different types of prey,
p239
aVbut then stomach content analyses on these fish
p240
aVdone by scientists, or more likely their graduate students,
p241
aVhave revealed that
p242
aVthey all eat pretty much the same thing.
p243
aVSo, now we believe that the different shape of the lure
p244
aVis how the male recognizes the female
p245
aVin the anglerfish world,
p246
aVbecause many of these males
p247
aVare what are known as dwarf males.
p248
aVThis little guy
p249
aVhas no visible means of self-support.
p250
aVHe has no lure for attracting food
p251
aVand no teeth for eating it when it gets there.
p252
aVHis only hope for existence on this planet
p253
aVis as a gigolo. (Laughter)
p254
aVHe's got to find himself a babe
p255
aVand then he's got to latch on for life.
p256
aVSo this little guy
p257
aVhas found himself this babe,
p258
aVand you will note that he's had the good sense
p259
aVto attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVBut he still knows a good thing when he sees it,
p262
aVand so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss.
p263
aVHis flesh fuses with her flesh,
p264
aVher bloodstream grows into his body,
p265
aVand he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac.
p266
aV(Laughter)
p267
aVWell, this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib.
p268
aVShe always knows where he is,
p269
aVand she doesn't have to be monogamous,
p270
aVbecause some of these females
p271
aVcome up with multiple males attached.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo they can use it for finding food, for attracting mates.
p274
aVThey use it a lot for defense, many different ways.
p275
aVA lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water
p276
aVjust the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.
p277
aVThis shrimp is actually
p278
aVspewing light out of its mouth
p279
aVlike a fire breathing dragon
p280
aVin order to blind or distract this viperfish
p281
aVso that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.
p282
aVAnd there are a lot of different animals that can do this:
p283
aVThere's jellyfish, there's squid,
p284
aVthere's a whole lot of different crustaceans,
p285
aa(lp286
Vthere's even fish that can do this.
p287
aVThis fish is called the shining tubeshoulder
p288
aVbecause it actually has a tube on its shoulder
p289
aVthat can squirt out light.
p290
aVAnd I was luck enough to capture one of these
p291
aVwhen we were on a trawling expedition
p292
aVoff the northwest coast of Africa for "Blue Planet,"
p293
aVfor the deep portion of "Blue Planet."
p294
aVAnd we were using a special trawling net
p295
aVthat we were able to bring these animals up alive.
p296
aVSo we captured one of these, and I brought it into the lab.
p297
aVSo I'm holding it,
p298
aVand I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder,
p299
aVand when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out.
p300
aVBut to me, what's shocking
p301
aVis not just the amount of light,
p302
aVbut the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.
p303
aVFor this fish, it's actually whole cells
p304
aVwith nuclei and membranes.
p305
aVIt's energetically very costly for this fish to do this,
p306
aVand we have no idea why it does it \u2014
p307
aVanother one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, another form of defense
p310
aVis something called a burglar alarm \u2014
p311
aVsame reason you have a burglar alarm on your car;
p312
aVthe honking horn and flashing lights
p313
aVare meant to attract the attention of, hopefully,
p314
aVthe police that will come and take the burglar away \u2014
p315
aVwhen an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator,
p316
aVits only hope for escape may be
p317
aVto attract the attention of something bigger and nastier
p318
aVthat will attack their attacker,
p319
aVthereby affording them a chance for escape.
p320
aVThis jellyfish, for example, has
p321
aVa spectacular bioluminescent display.
p322
aVThis is us chasing it in the submersible.
p323
aVThat's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads.
p324
aVWe capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible
p325
aVthat allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition,
p326
aVbring it into the lab on the ship.
p327
aVAnd then to generate the display you're about to see,
p328
aVall I did was touch it once per second
p329
aVon its nerve ring with a sharp pick
p330
aVthat's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.
p331
aVAnd once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.
p332
aVThis is an unbelievable light show.
p333
aVIt's this pinwheel of light,
p334
aVand I've done calculations that show that this could be seen
p335
aVfrom as much as 300 feet away by a predator.
p336
aVAnd I thought, "You know,
p337
aVthat might actually make a pretty good lure."
p338
aVBecause one of the things that's frustrated me
p339
aVas a deep-sea explorer
p340
aVis how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about
p341
aVbecause of the way we explore the ocean.
p342
aa(lp343
VThe primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean
p344
aVis we go out and drag nets behind ships.
p345
aVAnd I defy you to name any other branch of science
p346
aVthat still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.
p347
aVThe other primary way is we go down
p348
aVwith submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.
p349
aVI've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.
p350
aVWhen I'm sitting in a submersible though,
p351
aVI know that I'm not unobtrusive at all \u2014
p352
aVI've got bright lights and noisy thrusters \u2014
p353
aVany animal with any sense is going to be long gone.
p354
aVSo, I've wanted for a long time
p355
aVto figure out a different way to explore.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd so, sometime ago, I got this idea for a camera system.
p358
aVIt's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea.
p359
aVAnd scientists have done this on land for years;
p360
aVwe just use a color that the animals can't see
p361
aVand then a camera that can see that color.
p362
aVYou can't use infrared in the sea.
p363
aVWe use far-red light, but even that's a problem
p364
aVbecause it gets absorbed so quickly.
p365
aVMade an intensified camera,
p366
aVwanted to make this electronic jellyfish.
p367
aVThing is, in science,
p368
aVyou basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover
p369
aVbefore they'll give you the money.
p370
aVAnd I didn't know what I was going to discover,
p371
aVso I couldn't get the funding for this.
p372
aVSo I kluged this together, I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic
p373
aVto actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially,
p374
aVand then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources.
p375
aa(lp376
VMonterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
p377
aVgave me time with their ROV
p378
aVso that I could test it and we could figure out,
p379
aVyou know, for example, which colors of red light we had to use
p380
aVso that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us \u2014
p381
aVget the electronic jellyfish working.
p382
aVAnd you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was,
p383
aVbecause we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy
p384
aVand you can see in the epoxy mold that we used,
p385
aVthe word Ziploc is still visible.
p386
aVNeedless to say, when it's kluged together like this,
p387
aVthere were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working.
p388
aVBut there came a moment when it all came together,
p389
aVand everything worked.
p390
aVAnd, remarkably, that moment got caught on film
p391
aVby photographer Mark Richards,
p392
aVwho happened to be there at the precise moment
p393
aVthat we discovered that it all came together.
p394
aVThat's me on the left,
p395
aVmy graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond,
p396
aVand Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.
p397
aVAnd we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor
p398
aVwith the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter)
p399
aVAnd we were very, very happy.
p400
aa(lp401
VSo now we had a system
p402
aVthat we could actually take to some place
p403
aVthat was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean
p404
aVthat might be patrolled by large predators.
p405
aVAnd so, the place that we took it to
p406
aVwas this place called a Brine Pool,
p407
aVwhich is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
p408
aVIt's a magical place.
p409
aVAnd I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you \u2014
p410
aVwe had a crummy camera at the time \u2014
p411
aVbut I was ecstatic.
p412
aVWe're at the edge of the Brine Pool,
p413
aVthere's a fish that's swimming towards the camera.
p414
aVIt's clearly undisturbed by us.
p415
aVAnd I had my window into the deep sea.
p416
aVI, for the first time, could see what animals were doing down there
p417
aVwhen we weren't down there disturbing them in some way.
p418
aVFour hours into the deployment,
p419
aVwe had programmed the electronic jellyfish
p420
aVto come on for the first time.
p421
aVEighty-six seconds after
p422
aVit went into its pinwheel display,
p423
aVwe recorded this:
p424
aVThis is a squid, over six feet long,
p425
aVthat is so new to science,
p426
aVit cannot be placed in any known scientific family.
p427
aVI could not have asked for a better proof of concept.
p428
aa(lp429
VAnd based on this, I went back to the National Science Foundation
p430
aVand said, "This is what we will discover."
p431
aVAnd they gave me enough money to do it right,
p432
aVwhich has involved developing the world's first deep-sea webcam \u2014
p433
aVwhich has been installed in
p434
aVthe Monterey Canyon for the past year \u2014
p435
aVand now, more recently,
p436
aVa modular form of this system,
p437
aVa much more mobile form
p438
aVthat's a lot easier to launch and recover,
p439
aVthat I hope can be used on Sylvia's "hope spots"
p440
aVto help explore
p441
aVand protect these areas,
p442
aVand, for me, learn more about
p443
aVthe bioluminescence in these "hope spots."
p444
aa(lp445
VSo one of these take-home messages here
p446
aVis, there is still a lot to explore in the oceans.
p447
aVAnd Sylvia has said
p448
aVthat we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them,
p449
aVand she's right.
p450
aVSo if you ever, ever get an opportunity
p451
aVto take a dive in a submersible,
p452
aVsay yes \u2014 a thousand times, yes \u2014
p453
aVand please turn out the lights.
p454
aVI promise, you'll love it.
p455
aa(lp456

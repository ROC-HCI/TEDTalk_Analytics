VIn my lab, we build autonomous aerial robots
p5
aVlike the one you see flying here.
p6
aVUnlike the commercially available drones that you can buy today,
p7
aVthis robot doesn't have any GPS on board.
p8
aVSo without GPS,
p9
aVit's hard for robots like this to determine their position.
p10
aVThis robot uses onboard sensors, cameras and laser scanners,
p11
aVto scan the environment.
p12
aVIt detects features from the environment,
p13
aVand it determines where it is relative to those features,
p14
aVusing a method of triangulation.
p15
aVAnd then it can assemble all these features into a map,
p16
aVlike you see behind me.
p17
aVAnd this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are
p18
aVand navigate in a collision-free manner.
p19
aa(lp20
VWhat I want to show you next
p21
aVis a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory,
p22
aVwhere this robot was able to go for longer distances.
p23
aVSo here you'll see, on the top right, what the robot sees with the camera.
p24
aVAnd on the main screen \u2014
p25
aVand of course this is sped up by a factor of four \u2014
p26
aVon the main screen you'll see the map that it's building.
p27
aVSo this is a high-resolution map of the corridor around our laboratory.
p28
aVAnd in a minute you'll see it enter our lab,
p29
aVwhich is recognizable by the clutter that you see.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VBut the main point I want to convey to you
p34
aVis that these robots are capable of building high-resolution maps
p35
aVat five centimeters resolution,
p36
aVallowing somebody who is outside the lab, or outside the building
p37
aVto deploy these without actually going inside,
p38
aVand trying to infer what happens inside the building.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow there's one problem with robots like this.
p41
aVThe first problem is it's pretty big.
p42
aVBecause it's big, it's heavy.
p43
aVAnd these robots consume about 100 watts per pound.
p44
aVAnd this makes for a very short mission life.
p45
aVThe second problem
p46
aVis that these robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive \u2014
p47
aVa laser scanner, a camera and the processors.
p48
aVThat drives up the cost of this robot.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo we asked ourselves a question:
p51
aVwhat consumer product can you buy in an electronics store
p52
aVthat is inexpensive, that's lightweight, that has sensing onboard and computation?
p53
aVAnd we invented the flying phone.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VSo this robot uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf,
p58
aVand all you need is an app that you can download from our app store.
p59
aVAnd you can see this robot reading the letters, "TED" in this case,
p60
aVlooking at the corners of the "T" and the "E"
p61
aVand then triangulating off of that, flying autonomously.
p62
aVThat joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy,
p63
aVGiuseppe can kill it.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VIn addition to building these small robots,
p68
aVwe also experiment with aggressive behaviors, like you see here.
p69
aVSo this robot is now traveling at two to three meters per second,
p70
aVpitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction.
p71
aVThe main point is we can have smaller robots that can go faster
p72
aVand then travel in these very unstructured environments.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd in this next video,
p75
aVjust like you see this bird, an eagle, gracefully coordinating its wings,
p76
aVits eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water,
p77
aVour robot can go fishing, too.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VIn this case, this is a Philly cheesesteak hoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VSo you can see this robot going at about three meters per second,
p86
aVwhich is faster than walking speed, coordinating its arms, its claws
p87
aVand its flight with split-second timing to achieve this maneuver.
p88
aVIn another experiment,
p89
aVI want to show you how the robot adapts its flight
p90
aVto control its suspended payload,
p91
aVwhose length is actually larger than the width of the window.
p92
aVSo in order to accomplish this,
p93
aVit actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude
p94
aVand swing the payload through.
p95
aVBut of course we want to make these even smaller,
p96
aVand we're inspired in particular by honeybees.
p97
aVSo if you look at honeybees, and this is a slowed down video,
p98
aVthey're so small, the inertia is so lightweight \u2014
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
Vthat they don't care \u2014 they bounce off my hand, for example.
p103
aVThis is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior.
p104
aVAnd smaller is better,
p105
aVbecause along with the small size you get lower inertia.
p106
aVAlong with lower inertia \u2014
p107
aa(lp108
V(Robot buzzing, laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
Valong with lower inertia, you're resistant to collisions.
p111
aVAnd that makes you more robust.
p112
aVSo just like these honeybees, we build small robots.
p113
aVAnd this particular one is only 25 grams in weight.
p114
aVIt consumes only six watts of power.
p115
aVAnd it can travel up to six meters per second.
p116
aVSo if I normalize that to its size,
p117
aVit's like a Boeing 787 traveling ten times the speed of sound.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd I want to show you an example.
p122
aVThis is probably the first planned mid-air collision, at one-twentieth normal speed.
p123
aVThese are going at a relative speed of two meters per second,
p124
aVand this illustrates the basic principle.
p125
aVThe two-gram carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling,
p126
aVbut essentially the collision is absorbed and the robot responds to the collisions.
p127
aVAnd so small also means safe.
p128
aVIn my lab, as we developed these robots,
p129
aVwe start off with these big robots
p130
aVand then now we're down to these small robots.
p131
aVAnd if you plot a histogram of the number of Band-Aids we've ordered
p132
aVin the past, that sort of tailed off now.
p133
aVBecause these robots are really safe.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe small size has some disadvantages,
p136
aVand nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages.
p137
aVThe basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups, or swarms.
p138
aVSo, similarly, in our lab, we try to create artificial robot swarms.
p139
aVAnd this is quite challenging
p140
aVbecause now you have to think about networks of robots.
p141
aVAnd within each robot,
p142
aVyou have to think about the interplay of sensing, communication, computation \u2014
p143
aVand this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage.
p144
aVSo from nature we take away three organizing principles
p145
aVthat essentially allow us to develop our algorithms.
p146
aVThe first idea is that robots need to be aware of their neighbors.
p147
aVThey need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo this video illustrates the basic idea.
p150
aVYou have four robots \u2014
p151
aVone of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator, literally.
p152
aVBut because the robots interact with each other,
p153
aVthey sense their neighbors,
p154
aVthey essentially follow.
p155
aVAnd here there's a single person able to lead this network of followers.
p156
aVSo again, it's not because all the robots know where they're supposed to go.
p157
aVIt's because they're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VSo the next experiment illustrates the second organizing principle.
p162
aVAnd this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity.
p163
aVHere the key idea is that
p164
aVthe robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors.
p165
aVThey're asked to form a circular shape,
p166
aVand no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation,
p167
aVor how many robots you pull out,
p168
aVeach robot is simply reacting to its neighbor.
p169
aVIt's aware of the fact that it needs to form the circular shape,
p170
aVbut collaborating with its neighbors
p171
aVit forms the shape without central coordination.
p172
aVNow if you put these ideas together,
p173
aVthe third idea is that we essentially give these robots
p174
aVmathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute.
p175
aVAnd these shapes can be varying as a function of time,
p176
aVand you'll see these robots start from a circular formation,
p177
aVchange into a rectangular formation, stretch into a straight line,
p178
aVback into an ellipse.
p179
aVAnd they do this with the same kind of split-second coordination
p180
aVthat you see in natural swarms, in nature.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo why work with swarms?
p183
aVLet me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in.
p184
aVThe first one has to do with agriculture,
p185
aVwhich is probably the biggest problem that we're facing worldwide.
p186
aVAs you well know,
p187
aVone in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished.
p188
aVMost of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated.
p189
aVAnd the efficiency of most systems in the world is improving,
p190
aVbut our production system efficiency is actually declining.
p191
aVAnd that's mostly because of water shortage, crop diseases, climate change
p192
aVand a couple of other things.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo what can robots do?
p195
aVWell, we adopt an approach that's called Precision Farming in the community.
p196
aVAnd the basic idea is that we fly aerial robots through orchards,
p197
aVand then we build precision models of individual plants.
p198
aVSo just like personalized medicine,
p199
aVwhile you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually,
p200
aVwhat we'd like to do is build models of individual plants
p201
aVand then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs \u2014
p202
aVthe inputs in this case being water, fertilizer and pesticide.
p203
aVHere you'll see robots traveling through an apple orchard,
p204
aVand in a minute you'll see two of its companions
p205
aVdoing the same thing on the left side.
p206
aVAnd what they're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard.
p207
aVWithin the map is a map of every plant in this orchard.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Robot buzzing)
p210
aa(lp211
VLet's see what those maps look like.
p212
aVIn the next video, you'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot.
p213
aVOn the top-left is essentially a standard color camera.
p214
aVOn the left-center is an infrared camera.
p215
aVAnd on the bottom-left is a thermal camera.
p216
aVAnd on the main panel, you're seeing a three-dimensional reconstruction
p217
aVof every tree in the orchard as the sensors fly right past the trees.
p218
aVArmed with information like this, we can do several things.
p219
aVThe first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple:
p220
aVcount the number of fruits on every tree.
p221
aVBy doing this, you tell the farmer how many fruits she has in every tree
p222
aVand allow her to estimate the yield in the orchard,
p223
aVoptimizing the production chain downstream.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe second thing we can do
p226
aVis take models of plants, construct three-dimensional reconstructions,
p227
aVand from that estimate the canopy size,
p228
aVand then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant.
p229
aVAnd this is called the leaf area index.
p230
aVSo if you know this leaf area index,
p231
aVyou essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant,
p232
aVwhich again tells you how healthy each plant is.
p233
aVBy combining visual and infrared information,
p234
aVwe can also compute indices such as NDVI.
p235
aVAnd in this particular case, you can essentially see
p236
aVthere are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops.
p237
aVThis is easily discernible from imagery,
p238
aVnot just visual imagery but combining
p239
aVboth visual imagery and infrared imagery.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd then lastly,
p242
aVone thing we're interested in doing is detecting the early onset of chlorosis \u2014
p243
aVand this is an orange tree \u2014
p244
aVwhich is essentially seen by yellowing of leaves.
p245
aVBut robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously
p246
aVand then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem
p247
aVin this section of the orchard.
p248
aa(lp249
VSystems like this can really help,
p250
aVand we're projecting yields that can improve by about ten percent
p251
aVand, more importantly, decrease the amount of inputs such as water
p252
aVby 25 percent by using aerial robot swarms.
p253
aa(lp254
VLastly, I want you to applaud the people who actually create the future,
p255
aVYash Mulgaonkar, Sikang Liu and Giuseppe Loianno,
p256
aVwho are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw.
p257
aa(lp258
VThank you.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)

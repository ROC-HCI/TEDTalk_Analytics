VMy name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning
p5
aVabout my project, Tidying Up Art.
p6
aVFirst of all \u2014 any questions so far?
p7
aVFirst of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.
p8
aVI'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?
p9
aVI mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous
p10
aVbecause I'm speaking in a foreign language,
p11
aVand I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.
p12
aVBecause I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German
p13
aVI'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like
p14
aVif we Swiss try to speak American.
p15
aVBut don't worry \u2014 I don't have trouble with English, as such.
p16
aVI mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVI am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,
p19
aVand you have to go on talking like this all the time.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.
p23
aVIt's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see,
p24
aVit's more or less a picture book.
p25
aVSo the reading would be over very quickly.
p26
aVBut since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,
p27
aVin the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.
p28
aVI'd like to show them around so we can just, you know \u2014
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVActually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures \u2014 even better.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.
p33
aVYou won't be familiar with it.
p34
aVI mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,
p35
aVand it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler
p36
aVI had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day
p37
aVand after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore
p38
aVthis guy was looking at all day long.
p39
aVYeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.
p40
aVAnd it seemed to me even he felt really bad
p41
aVfacing these unorganized red squares day after day.
p42
aVSo I decided to give him a little support,
p43
aVand brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVYeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.
p46
aVAnd it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely
p47
aVat modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art
p48
aVis particularly topsy-turvy.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd I can show here a very good example.
p51
aVIt's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.
p52
aVIt's a picture by Paul Klee.
p53
aVAnd we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVYeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.
p56
aVThe various pictures here of the various elements of the picture \u2014
p57
aVthe whole thing is unstructured.
p58
aVWe don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean \u2014
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aV\u2014 maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.
p61
aVWe can see here he started out with orange,
p62
aVand then he already ran out of orange,
p63
aVand here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.
p64
aVAnd I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVWe can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:
p67
aV17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.
p68
aVYeah, that's great.
p69
aVSo I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.
p70
aVI would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VWhat can you say? What a mess.
p74
aVI mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.
p75
aVIf my room back home had looked like this,
p76
aVmy mother would have grounded me for three days.
p77
aVSo I'd like to \u2014 I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.
p78
aVAnd that's really advanced tidying up.
p79
aV(Applause)
p80
aVYeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,
p81
aVbut that's actually more in Switzerland.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVWe Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.
p84
aVWe are only happy when things are in order.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut to go on, here is a very good example to see.
p87
aVThis is a picture by Joan Miro.
p88
aVAnd yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes
p89
aVand dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.
p90
aVAnd yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVAnd this is my \u2014
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aV\u2014 you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.
p95
aVIt's more economical and also more efficient.
p96
aVWith this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.
p99
aVSo that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,
p100
aVI brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,
p101
aVbecause I've had my working methods patented
p102
aVat the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVI'll just quote from the specification.
p105
aV"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht \u2014"
p106
aVIt's not finished yet.
p107
aV"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusen
p108
aVwird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunst
p109
aVdurch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeiten
p110
aVdes allgemeinen Formenschatzes
p111
aVneue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird."
p112
aa(lp113
VJa, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.
p114
aVI'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.
p115
aVI just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people,
p116
aVthat's why these patents are sometimes necessary.
p117
aVI would like to do a short test with you.
p118
aVEveryone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.
p119
aVSo I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.
p120
aVThe right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.
p121
aVAnd now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.
p122
aVNow, I'll count to three, and on the count of three
p123
aVI'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?
p124
aVOne, two, three.
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VYou can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way
p128
aVcan sometimes lead to complete chaos.
p129
aVSo we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.
p130
aVThis is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.
p131
aVAnd I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see
p132
aVwhat this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.
p133
aVBut in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVYeah, it's a \u2014 this one here, that's much better.
p136
aVThat's a picture by Keith Haring.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVI think it doesn't matter.
p139
aVSo, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.
p140
aVIt's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVThis is Keith Haring looked at statistically.
p145
aVOne can see here quite clearly,
p146
aVyou can see we have 25 pale green elements,
p147
aVof which one is in the form of a circle.
p148
aVOr here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.
p149
aVI mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis
p150
aVto cover all Mr. Haring's various works,
p151
aVin order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.
p152
aVAnd the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure
p153
aVby using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VOne can obviously also make combinations.
p157
aVFor example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.
p158
aVYou can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.
p159
aVIn the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.
p160
aVThen you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,
p161
aVput it in your office and you can make a living doing it.
p162
aV(Laughter)
p163
aVYeah, from my own experience. So I'm \u2014
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVActually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.
p166
aVThis is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VBut I think it could still benefit from more discipline.
p170
aVAnd I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aVAnd here, that's one of my favorites.
p173
aVTidying up Rene Magritte \u2014 this is really fun.
p174
aVYou know, there is a \u2014
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVI'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.
p177
aVIt goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.
p178
aVSo once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.
p179
aVAnd you know, there you had this little sign \u2014
p180
aVI put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,
p181
aV"Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here.
p182
aVSo actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.
p183
aVSo after a while I decided to have a little fun,
p184
aVand before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.
p185
aVLike books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.
p186
aVBy the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.
p187
aVBut then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVAnd you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.
p190
aVAnd when I returned it looked like this.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVYeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VOK, I mean, I can see there are always people
p196
aVthat like reacting that one or another picture
p197
aVhasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.
p198
aVThis is a picture by Rene Magritte,
p199
aVand I'd like you all to inwardly \u2014 like in your head, that is \u2014
p200
aVto tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aVYeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.
p203
aVSome people would make apple pie out of it.
p204
aVBut it's a very good example to see that the whole work
p205
aVwas more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job
p206
aVof cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.
p207
aVAnd it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,
p208
aVotherwise it would look like this.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VSo now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.
p212
aVHere is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.
p213
aVIt's \u2014 oh, no, it's \u2014 that's a really hard one.
p214
aVBut after a while, I just decided here to go all the way
p215
aVand put the paint back into the cans.
p216
aV(Applause)
p217
aVOr you could go into three-dimensional art.
p218
aVHere we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.
p219
aVHere I just brought it back to its original state.
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aVBut yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know \u2014
p222
aVOr we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.
p223
aVThe pointillist movement is that kind of paintings
p224
aVwhere everything is broken down into dots and pixels.
p225
aVAnd then I \u2014 this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VSo I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,
p229
aVand I collected together all his dots.
p230
aVAnd now they're all in here.
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVYou can count them afterwards, if you like.
p233
aVYou see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:
p234
aVit's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.
p235
aVThere is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.
p236
aVI mean, it's "the future we will create."
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVBut to round things up I would like to show you just one more.
p239
aVThis is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.
p240
aVThat's how it looks like when you send everyone home.
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aVYeah, maybe you're asking yourselves
p243
aVwhere old Bruegel's people went?
p244
aVOf course, they're not gone. They're all here.
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aVI just piled them up.
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VSo I'm \u2014 yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.
p250
aVAnd for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.
p251
aVAnd I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.
p252
aV(Laughter)
p253
aVBut before leaving I would like to show you,
p254
aVI'm working right now on another \u2014 in a related field
p255
aVwith my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.
p256
aVAnd I started to bring some order into some flags.
p257
aVHere \u2014 that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVAnd then maybe before I leave you ...
p260
aVyeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVYeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,
p263
aVso I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aVThank you very much.
p266
aV(Applause)

VIn 2011, during the final six months of Kim Jong-Il's life,
p5
aVI lived undercover in North Korea.
p6
aa(lp7
VI was born and raised in South Korea, their enemy.
p8
aVI live in America, their other enemy.
p9
aa(lp10
VSince 2002, I had visited North Korea a few times.
p11
aVAnd I had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning,
p12
aVor to understand the place beyond the regime's propaganda,
p13
aVthe only option was total immersion.
p14
aVSo I posed as a teacher and a missionary
p15
aVat an all-male university in Pyongyang.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe Pyongyang University of Science and Technology
p18
aVwas founded by Evangelical Christians who cooperate with the regime
p19
aVto educate the sons of the North Korean elite,
p20
aVwithout proselytizing, which is a capital crime there.
p21
aVThe students were 270 young men, expected to be the future leaders
p22
aVof the most isolated and brutal dictatorship in existence.
p23
aVWhen I arrived, they became my students.
p24
aa(lp25
V2011 was a special year,
p26
aVmarking the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's original Great Leader,
p27
aVKim Il-Sung.
p28
aVTo celebrate the occasion, the regime shut down all universities,
p29
aVand sent students off to the fields
p30
aVto build the DPRK's much-heralded ideal
p31
aVas the world's most powerful and prosperous nation.
p32
aVMy students were the only ones spared from that fate.
p33
aa(lp34
VNorth Korea is a gulag posing as a nation.
p35
aVEverything there is about the Great Leader.
p36
aVEvery book, every newspaper article, every song, every TV program \u2014
p37
aVthere is just one subject.
p38
aVThe flowers are named after him,
p39
aVthe mountains are carved with his slogans.
p40
aVEvery citizen wears the badge of the Great Leader at all times.
p41
aVEven their calendar system begins with the birth of Kim Il-Sung.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe school was a heavily guarded prison, posing as a campus.
p44
aVTeachers could only leave on group outings accompanied by an official minder.
p45
aVEven then, our trips were limited to sanctioned national monuments
p46
aVcelebrating the Great Leader.
p47
aVThe students were not allowed to leave the campus,
p48
aVor communicate with their parents.
p49
aVTheir days were meticulously mapped out, and any free time they had
p50
aVwas devoted to honoring their Great Leader.
p51
aVLesson plans had to meet the approval of North Korean staff,
p52
aVevery class was recorded and reported on, every room was bugged,
p53
aVand every conversation, overheard.
p54
aVEvery blank space was covered with the  portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il,
p55
aVlike everywhere else in North Korea.
p56
aa(lp57
VWe were never allowed to discuss the outside world.
p58
aVAs students of science and technology, many of them were computer majors
p59
aVbut they did not know the existence of the Internet.
p60
aVThey had never heard of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.
p61
aVFacebook, Twitter \u2014 none of those things would have meant a thing.
p62
aVAnd I could not tell them.
p63
aa(lp64
VI went there looking for truth.
p65
aVBut where do you even start when an entire nation's ideology,
p66
aVmy students' day-to-day realities,
p67
aVand even my own position at the universities,
p68
aVwere all built on lies?
p69
aa(lp70
VI started with a game.
p71
aVWe played "Truth and Lie."
p72
aVA volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard,
p73
aVand the other students had to guess
p74
aVwhether it was a truth or a lie.
p75
aVOnce a student wrote, "I visited China last year on vacation,"
p76
aVand everyone shouted, "Lie!"
p77
aVThey all knew this wasn't possible.
p78
aVVirtually no North Korean is allowed to leave the country.
p79
aVEven traveling within their own country requires a travel pass.
p80
aa(lp81
VI had hoped that this game would reveal some truth about my students,
p82
aVbecause they lie so often and so easily,
p83
aVwhether about the mythical accomplishments of their Great Leader,
p84
aVor the strange claim that they cloned a rabbit as fifth graders.
p85
aVThe difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them.
p86
aVIt took me a while to understand the different types of lies;
p87
aVthey lie to shield their system from the world,
p88
aVor they were taught lies, and were just regurgitating them.
p89
aVOr, at moments, they lied out of habit.
p90
aVBut if all they have ever known were lies,
p91
aVhow could we expect them to be otherwise?
p92
aa(lp93
VNext, I tried to teach them essay writing.
p94
aVBut that turned out to be nearly impossible.
p95
aVEssays are about coming up with one's own thesis,
p96
aVand making an evidence-based argument to prove it.
p97
aVThese students, however, were simply told what to think,
p98
aVand they obeyed.
p99
aVIn their world, critical thinking was not allowed.
p100
aa(lp101
VI also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter,
p102
aVto anybody.
p103
aVIt took a long time, but eventually some of them began to write
p104
aVto their mothers, their friends, their girlfriends.
p105
aVAlthough those were just homework,
p106
aVand would never reach their intended recipients,
p107
aVmy students slowly began to reveal their true feelings in them.
p108
aVThey wrote that they were fed up with the sameness of everything.
p109
aVThey were worried about their future.
p110
aVIn those letters, they rarely ever mentioned their Great Leader.
p111
aa(lp112
VI was spending all of my time with these young men.
p113
aVWe all ate meals together, played basketball together.
p114
aVI often called them gentlemen, which made them giggle.
p115
aVThey blushed at the mention of girls.
p116
aVAnd I came to adore them.
p117
aVAnd watching them open up even in the tiniest of ways,
p118
aVwas deeply moving.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut something also felt wrong.
p121
aVDuring those months of living in their world,
p122
aVI often wondered if the truth would, in fact, improve their lives.
p123
aVI wanted so much to tell them the truth,
p124
aVof their country and of the outside world,
p125
aVwhere Arab youth were turning their rotten regime inside out,
p126
aVusing the power of social media,
p127
aVwhere everyone except them was connected through the world wide web,
p128
aVwhich wasn't worldwide after all.
p129
aVBut for them, the truth was dangerous.
p130
aVBy encouraging them to run after it, I was putting them at risk \u2014
p131
aVof persecution,
p132
aVof heartbreak.
p133
aa(lp134
VWhen you're not allowed to express anything in the open,
p135
aVyou become good at reading what is unspoken.
p136
aVIn one of their personal letters to me, a student wrote that he understood
p137
aVwhy I always called them gentlemen.
p138
aVIt was because I was wishing them to be gentle in life, he said.
p139
aa(lp140
VOn my last day in December of 2011,
p141
aVthe day Kim Jong-Il's death was announced,
p142
aVtheir world shattered.
p143
aVI had to leave without a proper goodbye.
p144
aVBut I think they knew how sad I was for them.
p145
aa(lp146
VOnce, toward the end of my stay, a student said to me,
p147
aV"Professor, we never think of you as being different from us.
p148
aVOur circumstances are different, but you're the same as us.
p149
aVWe want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same."
p150
aa(lp151
VToday, if I could respond to my students with a letter of my own,
p152
aVwhich is of course impossible,
p153
aVI would tell them this:
p154
aV"My dear gentlemen,
p155
aVIt's been a bit over three years since I last saw you.
p156
aVAnd now, you must be 22 \u2014 maybe even as old as 23.
p157
aVAt our final class, I asked you if there was anything you wanted.
p158
aVThe only wish you expressed, the only thing you ever asked of me
p159
aVin all those months we spent together,
p160
aVwas for me to speak to you in Korean.
p161
aVJust once.
p162
aVI was there to teach you English;
p163
aVyou knew it wasn't allowed.
p164
aVBut I understood then, you wanted to share that bond of our mother tongue.
p165
aVI called you my gentlemen,
p166
aVbut I don't know if being gentle in Kim Jong-Un's merciless North Korea
p167
aVis a good thing.
p168
aVI don't want you to lead a revolution \u2014
p169
aVlet some other young person do it.
p170
aVThe rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect
p171
aVsome sort of North Korean Spring,
p172
aVbut I don't want you to do anything risky,
p173
aVbecause I know in your world, someone is always watching.
p174
aVI don't want to imagine what might happen to you.
p175
aVIf my attempts to reach you have inspired something new in you,
p176
aVI would rather you forget me.
p177
aVBecome soldiers of your Great Leader, and live long, safe lives.
p178
aVYou once asked me if I thought your city of Pyongyang was beautiful,
p179
aVand I could not answer truthfully then.
p180
aVBut I know why you asked.
p181
aVI know that it was important for you to hear that I, your teacher,
p182
aVthe one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from,
p183
aVdeclare your city as the most beautiful.
p184
aVI know hearing that would make your lives there a bit more bearable,
p185
aVbut no, I don't find your capital beautiful.
p186
aVNot because it's monotone and concrete,
p187
aVbut because of what it symbolizes:
p188
aVa monster that feeds off the rest of the country,
p189
aVwhere citizens are soldiers and slaves.
p190
aVAll I see there is darkness.
p191
aVBut it's your home, so I cannot hate it.
p192
aVAnd I hope instead that you, my lovely young gentlemen,
p193
aVwill one day help make it beautiful.
p194
aa(lp195
VThank you.

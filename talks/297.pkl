VSome of you have heard the story before,
p5
aVbut, in fact, there's somebody in the audience
p6
aVwho's never heard this story in front of an audience before,
p7
aVso I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story.
p8
aVI used to be a photographer for many years.
p9
aVIn 1978, I was working for "TIME Magazine"
p10
aVand I was given a three-day assignment to photograph Amerasian children,
p11
aVchildren who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia,
p12
aVand then abandoned \u2014 40,000 children all over Asia.
p13
aVI had never heard the word Amerasian before.
p14
aVI spent a few days photographing children in different countries,
p15
aVand like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists,
p16
aVI always hoped that when my pictures are published,
p17
aVthey might actually have an effect on a situation,
p18
aVinstead of just documenting it.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, I was so disturbed by what I saw
p21
aVand I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards,
p22
aVthat I decided I would take six months off.
p23
aVI was 28 years old.
p24
aVI decided I would find six children in different countries,
p25
aVand actually go spend some time with the kids,
p26
aVand try to tell their story a little bit better
p27
aVthan I thought I had done for Time magazine.
p28
aVIn the course of doing the story,
p29
aVI was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before,
p30
aVand the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans
p31
aVwho were donating money to help some of these kids.
p32
aVAnd a man told me,
p33
aVwho ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea,
p34
aVthat there was a young girl, who was 11 years old,
p35
aVbeing raised by her grandmother.
p36
aVAnd the grandmother had never let any Westerners see her.
p37
aVEvery time any Westerners came to the village, she hid the girl.
p38
aVOf course, I was immediately intrigued.
p39
aVI saw photographs of her and I thought I wanted to go.
p40
aVAnd the guy just told me,
p41
aV"This grandmother \u2014 there's no way she's ever going to let you
p42
aVmeet this girl that's she's raising."
p43
aa(lp44
VI took a translator with me and went to this village,
p45
aVfound the grandmother, sat down with her.
p46
aVAnd to my astonishment, she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter.
p47
aVAnd I was paying for this myself, so I asked the translator
p48
aVif it would be OK if I stayed for the week.
p49
aVI had a sleeping bag.
p50
aVThe family had a small shed on the side of the house,
p51
aVso I said, "Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"
p52
aVAnd I just told the little girl, whose name was Eun-Sook Lee,
p53
aVthat if I ever did anything to embarrass her \u2014
p54
aVshe didn't speak a word of English, although she looked very American \u2014
p55
aVshe could put up her hand and say, "Stop," and I would stop taking pictures.
p56
aVThen my translator left. I couldn't speak a word of Korean.
p57
aVThis is the first night I met Eun-Sook.
p58
aVHer mother was still alive.
p59
aVShe was not raising her, her grandmother was raising her.
p60
aVAnd what struck me immediately
p61
aVwas how in love the two of these people were.
p62
aVThe grandmother was incredibly fond, deeply in love with this little girl.
p63
aVThey slept on the floor at night.
p64
aVThe way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks under the floors,
p65
aVso the heat radiates from underneath the floor.
p66
aVEun-Sook was 11 years old.
p67
aa(lp68
VI had photographed, as I said, a lot of these kids.
p69
aVEun-Sook was the fifth child that I found to photograph.
p70
aVAnd almost universally, amongst all the kids,
p71
aVthey were really psychologically damaged
p72
aVby having been made fun of, ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.
p73
aVAnd Korea was probably the place I found to be the worst for these kids.
p74
aVAnd what struck me immediately in meeting Eun-Sook
p75
aVwas how confident she appeared to be,
p76
aVhow happy she seemed to be in her own skin.
p77
aVAnd remember this picture,
p78
aVbecause I'm going to show you another picture later.
p79
aVShe looks much like her grandmother, although she looks so Western.
p80
aa(lp81
VI decided to follow her to school.
p82
aVThis is the first morning I stayed with her.
p83
aVThis is on the way to school.
p84
aVThis is the morning assembly outside her school.
p85
aVAnd I noticed that she was clowning around.
p86
aVWhen the teachers would ask questions,
p87
aVshe'd be the first person to raise her hand.
p88
aVAgain, not at all shy or withdrawn,
p89
aVor anything like the other children that I'd photographed.
p90
aVThe first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions.
p91
aVGetting in trouble for whispering into her best friend's ears.
p92
aVAnd one of the other things I said to her through the translator \u2014
p93
aVagain, this thing about saying stop \u2014 was to not pay attention to me.
p94
aVSo she really just completely ignored me most of the time.
p95
aVI noticed that at recess,
p96
aVshe was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team.
p97
aVIt was very obvious, from the beginning, that she was a leader.
p98
aVThis is on the way home. And that's North Korea up along the hill.
p99
aVThis is up along the DMZ.
p100
aVThey would actually cover the windows every night,
p101
aVso that light couldn't be seen,
p102
aVbecause the South Korean government has said for years
p103
aVthat the North Koreans may invade at any time.
p104
aVSo the closer you were to North Korea, the more terrifying it was.
p105
aa(lp106
VVery often at school, I'd be taking pictures,
p107
aVand she would whisper into her girlfriends' ears,
p108
aVand then look at me and say, "Stop."
p109
aVAnd I would stand at attention, and all the girls would crack up,
p110
aVand it was sort of a little joke.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VThe end of the week came and my translator came back,
p115
aVbecause I'd asked her to come back,
p116
aVso I could formally thank the grandmother and Eun-Sook.
p117
aVAnd in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator,
p118
aVthe grandmother started crying.
p119
aVAnd I said to my translator, "What's going on, why is she crying?"
p120
aVAnd she spoke to the grandmother for a moment,
p121
aVand then she started getting tears in her eyes.
p122
aVAnd I said, "What did I do? Why is everyone crying?"
p123
aVAnd the translator said,
p124
aV"The grandmother says that she thinks she's dying,
p125
aVand she wants to know if you would take Eun-Sook to America with you."
p126
aVAnd I said, "I'm 28 years old and I live in hotels,
p127
aVand I'm not married."
p128
aVI mean, I had fallen in love with this girl,
p129
aVbut you know, emotionally I was about 12 years old.
p130
aVIf you know of photographers,
p131
aVthe joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented.
p132
aV"Sorry, I have to go on an assignment, I'll be back" \u2014
p133
aVand then you never come back.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo I asked the translator why she thought she was dying.
p136
aVCan I get her to a hospital? Could I pay to get her a doctor?
p137
aVAnd she refused any help at all.
p138
aVSo when I got outside, I gave the translator some money and said,
p139
aV"Go back and see if you can do something."
p140
aVAnd I gave the grandmother my business card.
p141
aVAnd I said, "If you're serious, I will try to find a family for her."
p142
aVAnd I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in Atlanta, Georgia,
p143
aVwho had an 11-year-old son.
p144
aVAnd my best friend had mistakenly one day said something
p145
aVabout wishing he had another child.
p146
aVSo my friends Gene and Gayle had not heard from me in about a year,
p147
aVand suddenly I was calling,
p148
aVsaying "I'm in Korea and I've met this extraordinary girl."
p149
aVAnd I said, "The grandmother thinks she's sick,
p150
aVbut I think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also."
p151
aVAnd I said, "I'll pay for the ... " I mean, I had this whole sort of picture.
p152
aVSo anyway, I left.
p153
aVAnd my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her.
p154
aVAnd I said, "Look, I think I'll scare the grandmother to death,
p155
aVif I tell her that you're willing to adopt her.
p156
aVI want to go back and talk to her." But I was off on assignment.
p157
aVI figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks
p158
aVand talk to the grandmother.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd on Christmas Day, I was in Bangkok with a group of photographers
p161
aVand got a telegram \u2014 back in those days, you got telegrams \u2014
p162
aVfrom Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died
p163
aVand left their child in a will to me.
p164
aVDid I know anything about this?
p165
aVBecause I hadn't told them what I was doing,
p166
aVbecause I was so upset with the story they'd run.
p167
aVSo, I went back to Korea, and I went back to Eun-Sook's village,
p168
aVand she was gone.
p169
aVAnd the house that I had spent time in was empty.
p170
aVIt was incredibly cold.
p171
aVNo one in the village would tell me where Eun-Sook was,
p172
aVbecause the grandmother had always hidden her from Westerners.
p173
aVAnd they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me.
p174
aVSo I finally found Myung Sung,
p175
aVher best friend that she used to play with after school every day.
p176
aVAnd Myung Sung, under some pressure from me and the translator,
p177
aVgave us an address on the outside of Seoul.
p178
aVAnd I went to that address and knocked on the door,
p179
aVand a man answered the door.
p180
aVIt was not a very nice area of Seoul, there were mud streets outside of it.
p181
aVAnd I knocked on the door and Eun-Sook answered the door,
p182
aVand her eyes were bloodshot, and she seemed to be in shock.
p183
aVShe didn't recognize me \u2014 there was no recognition whatsoever.
p184
aVAnd this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean.
p185
aVAnd I said to the translator, "What did he say?"
p186
aVAnd she said, "He wants to know who you are."
p187
aVAnd I said, "Tell him that I am a photographer."
p188
aVI started explaining who I was, and he interrupted.
p189
aVAnd she said, "He says he knows who you are, what do you want?"
p190
aVI said, "Well, tell him that I was asked by this little girl's grandmother
p191
aVto find a family for her."
p192
aVAnd he said, "I'm her uncle, she's fine, you can leave now."
p193
aa(lp194
VSo I was \u2014
p195
aVThe door was being slammed in my face,
p196
aVit's incredibly cold, and I'm trying to think,
p197
aV"What would the hero do in a movie, if I was writing this as a movie script?"
p198
aVSo I said, "It's really cold, I've come a very long way,
p199
aVdo you mind if I come in for a minute? I'm freezing."
p200
aVSo the guy reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor.
p201
aVAnd as we started talking, I saw him yell something,
p202
aVand Eun-Sook came and brought us some food.
p203
aVAnd I had this whole mental picture of \u2014 sort of like Cinderella.
p204
aVI sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful,
p205
aVbright, happy little child,
p206
aVwho now appeared to be very withdrawn, being enslaved by this family.
p207
aVAnd I was really appalled, and I couldn't figure out what to do.
p208
aVAnd the more I tried talking to him, the less friendly he was getting.
p209
aVSo finally I said "Look," \u2014 this is all through the translator,
p210
aVbecause, you know, I don't speak a word of Korean \u2014
p211
aVand I said, "Look, I'm really glad that Eun-Sook has a family to live with.
p212
aVI was very worried about her.
p213
aVI made a promise to her grandmother, your mother, that I would find a family,
p214
aVand I'm so happy that you're going to take care of her.
p215
aVBut I bought an airline ticket and I'm stuck here for a week.
p216
aVI'm staying in a hotel downtown.
p217
aVWould you like to come and have lunch tomorrow?
p218
aVAnd you can practice your English."
p219
aVBecause he told me \u2014 I was trying to ask him questions about himself.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd so I went to the hotel, and I found two older Amerasians.
p222
aVA girl whose mother had been a prostitute,
p223
aVand she was a prostitute,
p224
aVand a boy who'd been in and out of jail.
p225
aVAnd I said to them, "Look, there's a little girl
p226
aVwho has a tiny chance of getting out of here
p227
aVand going to America.
p228
aVI don't know if it's the right decision or not,
p229
aVbut I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow
p230
aVand tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street,
p231
aVwhat people say to you, what you do for a living.
p232
aVI want him to understand what happens if she stays here.
p233
aVAnd I could be wrong, I don't know, but I wish you would come tomorrow."
p234
aa(lp235
VSo, these two came to lunch and we got thrown out of the restaurant.
p236
aVThey were yelling at him, it got to be really ugly.
p237
aVWe went outside, and he was just furious.
p238
aVAnd I knew I had totally blown this thing.
p239
aVHere I was again, trying to figure out what to do.
p240
aVAnd he started yelling at me, and I said to the translator,
p241
aV"Tell him to calm down, what is he saying?"
p242
aVAnd she said, "He's saying, 'Who the hell are you to walk into my house,
p243
aVsome rich American with your cameras around your neck,
p244
aVaccusing me of enslaving my niece?
p245
aVThis is my niece, I love her, she's my sister's daughter.
p246
aVWho the hell are you to accuse me of something like this?'"
p247
aVAnd I said, you know, "Look, you're absolutely right.
p248
aVI don't pretend to understand what's going on here.
p249
aVAll I know is, I've been photographing a lot of these children.
p250
aVI'm in love with your niece,
p251
aVI think she's an incredibly special child."
p252
aVAnd I said, "Look, I will fly my friends over here from the United States
p253
aVif you want to meet them, to see if you approve of them.
p254
aVI just think that \u2014 what little I know about the situation,
p255
aVshe has very little chance here of having the kind of life
p256
aVthat you probably would like her to have."
p257
aa(lp258
VSo, everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over
p259
aVwas, again, the stupidest thing I could have possibly done,
p260
aVbecause who's ever good enough for your relative?
p261
aVBut he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day
p262
aVfor her grandmother.
p263
aVAnd they actually take items of clothing and photographs,
p264
aVand they burn them as part of the ritual.
p265
aVAnd you can see how different she looks just in three months.
p266
aVThis was now, I think, early February.
p267
aVAnd the pictures before were taken in September.
p268
aVWell, there was an American Maryknoll priest
p269
aVthat I had met in the course of doing the story,
p270
aVwho had 75 children living in his house.
p271
aVHe had three women helping him take care of these kids.
p272
aVAnd so I suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Keane
p273
aVto find out how the adoption process worked.
p274
aVBecause I wanted him to feel
p275
aVlike this was all being done very much above board.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo, this is on the way down to the orphanage.
p278
aVThis is Father Keane. He's just a wonderful guy.
p279
aVHe had kids from all over Korea living there,
p280
aVand he would find families for these kids.
p281
aVThis is a social worker interviewing Eun-Sook.
p282
aVNow, I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this,
p283
aVbecause the grandmother, to me,
p284
aVappeared to be sort of the village wise woman \u2014
p285
aVthroughout the day, I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother.
p286
aVAnd I always had this mental picture
p287
aVthat even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village,
p288
aVthey were one of the most respected.
p289
aVAnd I always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded, and insisted,
p290
aVthat the villagers treat Eun-Sook with the same respect they treated her.
p291
aVEun-Sook stayed at Father Keane's,
p292
aVand her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through.
p293
aVHe actually agreed to the adoption.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd I went off on assignment and came back a week later,
p296
aVand Father Keane said, "I've got to talk to you about Eun-Sook."
p297
aVI said, "Oh God, now what?"
p298
aVAnd he takes me into this room, closes the door and says,
p299
aV"I have 75 children here in the orphanage, and it's total bedlam."
p300
aVThere's clothes, there's kids.
p301
aVThree adults and 75 kids \u2014 you can imagine.
p302
aVAnd he said, "The second day she was here she made up a list
p303
aVof all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids.
p304
aVAnd she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids.
p305
aVAnd then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day."
p306
aVAnd he said, "She's telling me that I'm messy
p307
aVand I have to clean up my room."
p308
aVAnd he said, "I don't know who raised her, but she's running the orphanage,
p309
aVand she's been here three days."
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VThis was movie day that she organized where all the kids went to the movies.
p314
aVA lot of the kids who had been adopted wrote back to the other kids,
p315
aVtelling them what their life was like with their new families.
p316
aVSo it was a really big deal when the letters showed up.
p317
aVThis is a woman who is now working at the orphanage,
p318
aVwhose son had been adopted.
p319
aVGene and Gayle started studying Korean
p320
aVthe moment they had gotten my first letter.
p321
aVThey really wanted to be able to welcome Eun-Sook into their family.
p322
aVAnd one of the things Father Keane told me
p323
aVwhen I came back from one of these trips \u2014
p324
aVEun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha,
p325
aVwhich I understood was from her watching a "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoon
p326
aVon the American Air Force station.
p327
aVThis may be one of those myth-buster things
p328
aVthat we'll have to clear up here, in a minute.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo, my friend Gene flew over with his son, Tim.
p331
aVGayle couldn't come.
p332
aVAnd they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary.
p333
aVAnd this was Gene showing the uncle
p334
aVwhere Atlanta was on the map, where he lived.
p335
aVThis is the uncle signing the adoption papers.
p336
aVNow, we went out to dinner that night to celebrate.
p337
aVThe uncle went back to his family
p338
aVand Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner.
p339
aVAnd Gene was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork,
p340
aVand then Natasha was returning the utensil lessons.
p341
aVWe went back to our hotel room,
p342
aVand Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was.
p343
aVThis is the third night we were in Korea.
p344
aVThe first night we'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us.
p345
aa(lp346
VI'd been staying in this room for about three months \u2014
p347
aVit was a little 15-story Korean hotel.
p348
aVThe second night, we didn't keep the kids' room,
p349
aVbecause we slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage.
p350
aVAnd the third night, we came back \u2014
p351
aVwe'd just gone out to dinner, where you saw the pictures \u2014
p352
aVand we got to the front desk, and the guy said,
p353
aV"There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight,
p354
aVyou can put the kids five floors below you."
p355
aVAnd Gene and I looked at each other and said,
p356
aV"We don't want two 11-year-olds five floors away."
p357
aVSo his son said, "I have a sleeping bag, I'll sleep on the floor."
p358
aVAnd I said, "I have one too." So Tim and I slept on the floor,
p359
aVNatasha got one bed, Gene got the other \u2014 kids pass out,
p360
aVit's been very exciting for three days.
p361
aa(lp362
VWe're lying in bed, and Gene and I are talking about how cool we are.
p363
aVWe said, "That was so great, we saved this little girl's life."
p364
aVWe were just like, you know, just full of ourselves.
p365
aVAnd we fall asleep \u2014
p366
aVand I've been in this room for a couple of months now.
p367
aVAnd they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly,
p368
aVso during the day I always left the window open.
p369
aVAnd then about midnight, they turn the heat off in the hotel.
p370
aVSo at 1am, the whole room would be like 20 below zero, and I'd get up.
p371
aVI'd been doing this every night I'd been there.
p372
aVSo, sure enough, it's one o'clock, room's freezing,
p373
aVI go to close the window and I hear people shouting outside,
p374
aVand I thought, "Oh, the bars must have just gotten out."
p375
aVI don't speak Korean, but I'm hearing these voices,
p376
aVand I'm not hearing anger, I'm hearing terror.
p377
aVSo I open the window and I look out,
p378
aVand there's flames coming up the side of our hotel,
p379
aVand the hotel's on fire.
p380
aVSo I run over to Gene and I wake him up,
p381
aVand I say, "Don't freak out, I think the hotel's on fire."
p382
aVAnd now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows \u2014
p383
aVwe're on the 11th floor.
p384
aVSo the two of us were just like, "Oh my God, oh my God."
p385
aa(lp386
VSo we're trying to get Natasha up, and we can't talk to her.
p387
aVYou know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour,
p388
aVit's like they took five Valiums \u2014 they're all over the place.
p389
aVAnd we can't talk to her.
p390
aVHis son had the L.L.Bean bootlaces, and we're trying to do up his laces.
p391
aVSo we try to get to the door, we run to the door, we open the door,
p392
aVand it's like walking into a blast furnace.
p393
aVThere's people screaming, the sound of glass breaking, weird thumps.
p394
aVAnd the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds.
p395
aVAnd Gene turns around and says, "We're not going to make it."
p396
aVAnd he closes the door, and the whole room is now filled with smoke.
p397
aVWe're all choking, and there's smoke
p398
aVpouring through the vents, under the doors.
p399
aVThere's people screaming.
p400
aVI just remember this unbelievable \u2014 just utter chaos.
p401
aa(lp402
VI remember sitting near the bed, and I had two overwhelming feelings.
p403
aVOne was absolute terror. "Oh, please God, I just want to wake up.
p404
aVThis has got to be a nightmare, this can't be happening.
p405
aVPlease, I just want to wake up."
p406
aVAnd the other is unbelievable guilt.
p407
aVHere I've been playing God with my friends' lives,
p408
aVmy friends' son, with Natasha's life,
p409
aVand this what you get when you try playing God, is you hurt people.
p410
aVI remember just being so frightened and terrified.
p411
aVAnd Gene, who's lying on the floor, says,
p412
aV"We've got to soak towels." I said, "What?"
p413
aV"We've got to soak towels. We're going to die from the smoke."
p414
aVSo got towels and put them over our faces and the kids' faces.
p415
aVThen he said, "Do you have gaffer's tape?"
p416
aV"What?" "Do you have gaffer's tape?"
p417
aVI said, "Somewhere in my Halliburton."
p418
aVHe says, "We've got to stop the smoke. That's all we can do."
p419
aVI mean, Gene \u2014 thank God for Gene.
p420
aVSo we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall,
p421
aVwe put blankets at the bottom of the door,
p422
aVwe put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air.
p423
aVAnd there was a new building, going up,
p424
aVthat was being built right across the street from our hotel.
p425
aVAnd there, in the building, were photographers,
p426
aVwaiting for people to jump.
p427
aVEleven people ended up dying in the fire.
p428
aVFive people jumped and died, other people were killed by the smoke.
p429
aVAnd there's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this,
p430
aVand people were shouting in Korean.
p431
aVAnd I remember \u2014
p432
aVNatasha didn't want us opening the door \u2014
p433
aVsorry, I was trying not to open the door,
p434
aVbecause we'd spent so much time barricading the room.
p435
aVI didn't know who it was, I didn't know what they wanted,
p436
aVand Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out.
p437
aVI remember a sort of a tussle at the door, trying to get the door open.
p438
aa(lp439
VIn any case, 12 hours later \u2014 I mean, they put us in the lobby.
p440
aVGene ended up using his coat, and his fist in the coat,
p441
aVto break open a liquor cabinet.
p442
aVPeople were lying on the floor.
p443
aVIt was one of just the most horrifying nights.
p444
aVAnd then 12 hours later, we rented a car, as we had planned to,
p445
aVand drove back to Natasha's village.
p446
aVAnd we kept saying, "Do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire,
p447
aVlike eight hours ago?"
p448
aVIt's so weird how life just goes on.
p449
aVNatasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers,
p450
aVand the day we showed up turned out to be a 60-year-old man's birthday.
p451
aVThis guy's 60 years old.
p452
aVSo it turned into a dual celebration,
p453
aVbecause Natasha was the first person from this village
p454
aVever to go to the United States.
p455
aVSo, these are the greenhouse tents.
p456
aVThis is the elders teaching Gene their dances.
p457
aVWe drank a lot of rice wine.
p458
aVWe were both so drunk, I couldn't believe it.
p459
aa(lp460
VThis is the last picture before Gene and Tim headed back.
p461
aVThe adoption people told us
p462
aVit was going to take a year for the adoption to go through.
p463
aVLike, what could you do for a year?
p464
aVSo I found out the name of every official on both the Korean and American side,
p465
aVand I photographed them,
p466
aVand told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done.
p467
aVAnd four months later, the adoption papers came through.
p468
aVThis is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage.
p469
aVThis is Father Keane with Natasha at the bus stop.
p470
aVHer great aunt at the airport.
p471
aVI had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific airlines for many years,
p472
aVwhere they gave me free passes on all their airlines
p473
aVin return for photography.
p474
aVIt was like the ultimate perk.
p475
aVAnd the pilot, I actually knew \u2014
p476
aVbecause they used to let me sit in the jump seat,
p477
aVto tell you how long ago this was.
p478
aVThis is a TriStar, and so they let Natasha actually sit in the jump seat.
p479
aVAnd the pilot, Jeff Cowley, actually went back
p480
aVand adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha.
p481
aa(lp482
VThis is 28 hours later in Atlanta.
p483
aVIt's a very long flight.
p484
aVJust to make things even crazier, Gayle, Natasha's new mom,
p485
aVwas three days away from giving birth to her own daughter.
p486
aVYou know, if you were writing this, you'd say,
p487
aV"No, we've got to write the script differently."
p488
aVThis is the first night showing Natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts.
p489
aVGene and Gayle know everyone in Atlanta \u2014 they're the most social couple imaginable.
p490
aVSo, at this point, Natasha doesn't speak a word of English,
p491
aVother than what little Father Keane taught her.
p492
aVThis is Kylie, her sister, who's now a doctor, on the right.
p493
aVThis is a deal I had with Natasha, which is that when we got to Atlanta
p494
aVshe could cut off my beard.
p495
aVShe never liked it very much.
p496
aa(lp497
VShe learned English in three months.
p498
aVShe entered seventh grade at her own age level.
p499
aVPledge of Allegiance for the first time.
p500
aVThis is her cooking teacher.
p501
aVNatasha told me a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up,
p502
aVbecause they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer,
p503
aVand they didn't realize she didn't speak English very well.
p504
aVBut what I noticed, again as an observer,
p505
aVwas she was choosing who was going to be on her team,
p506
aVand seemed to be very popular very, very quickly.
p507
aVNow, remember the picture,
p508
aVhow much she looked like her grandmother, at the beginning?
p509
aVPeople were always telling Natasha how much she looks like her mother, Gayle.
p510
aa(lp511
V(Laughter)
p512
aa(lp513
VThis is a tense moment in the first football game, I think.
p514
aVAnd Kylie \u2014 I mean, it was almost like Kylie was her own child.
p515
aVShe's being baptized.
p516
aVNow, a lot of parents, when they adopt,
p517
aVactually want to erase their children's history.
p518
aVAnd Gayle and Gene did the complete opposite.
p519
aVThey were studying Korean; they bought Korean clothes.
p520
aVGene even did a little tile work in the kitchen,
p521
aVwhich was that, "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl
p522
aVthat came from the hills of Korea to live happily ever after in Atlanta."
p523
aa(lp524
VShe hates this picture \u2014 it was her first job.
p525
aVShe bought a bright red Karmann Ghia
p526
aVwith the money she made working at Burger King.
p527
aVThe captain of the cheerleaders.
p528
aVBeauty pageant.
p529
aVUsed to do their Christmas card every year.
p530
aVGene's been restoring this car for a million years.
p531
aa(lp532
VKodak hired Natasha to be a translator for them at the Olympics in Korea.
p533
aVHer future husband, Jeff, was working for Canon cameras,
p534
aVand met Natasha at the Olympic Village.
p535
aVThis is her first trip back to Korea. So there's her uncle.
p536
aVThis is her half sister.
p537
aVShe went back to the village.
p538
aVThat's her best friend's mother.
p539
aVAnd I always thought that was a very Annie Hall kind of outfit.
p540
aa(lp541
V(Laughter)
p542
aa(lp543
VIt's just, you know, it was just so interesting, just to watch \u2014
p544
aVthis is her mother in the background there.
p545
aVThis is Natasha's wedding day.
p546
aVGene is looking a little older.
p547
aVThis is Sydney, who's going to be three years old in a couple of days.
p548
aVAnd there's Evan.
p549
aa(lp550
VAnd Natasha, would you just come up, for a second,
p551
aVjust maybe to say hello to everybody?
p552
aa(lp553
V(Applause)
p554
aa(lp555
VNatasha's actually never heard me tell the story.
p556
aVYou know, we've looked at the pictures together.
p557
aa(lp558
VNatasha: I've seen pictures millions of times,
p559
aVbut today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation.
p560
aVI started crying.
p561
aa(lp562
VRick Smolan: There's about 40 things she's going to tell me,
p563
aV"That wasn't what happened." Natasha: I'll tell you that later.
p564
aa(lp565
VRS: Anyway, thank you, Mike and Richard, so much for letting us tell the story.
p566
aa(lp567
VThank you, all of you.

More than 20,000 photographers -- pros and amateurs -- sent images to a team of editors assembled by Smolan and partner Jennifer Erwitt, who turned the photos into an eye-popping book.

States during a week in September 2008</strong>. More than 20,000 photographers -- pros and amateurs -- sent images to a team of editors assembled by Smolan and partner Jennifer Erwitt, who turned the photos into an eye-popping book. It&#39;s become a best-seller, of course, helped along by the fact that <a href=\\"http://www.myamericaathome.com/customcover/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">buyers can choose their own image for the cover</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Smolan has long been a force for <strong>exploring culture through photography</strong>. The Day in the Life photography series that he cofounded -- best-selling photo books that captured life in America, Australia,  the Soviet Union ... -- were an &#39;80s cultural phenomenon. (Rare was the coffee table without at least one of them.) In the 1990s his production company, <a href=\\"http://www.againstallodds.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Against All Odds</a>, investigated the storytelling powers of interactive CD-ROMs with <em>From Alice to Ocean</em>, a narrative of a cross-Australia trek, and <em>Passage to Vietnam</em>, exploring that country as it opened up in the early 1990s. <em>24 Hours in Cyberspace</em> took a snapshot of the booming industry in 1996, and <em>One Digital Day</em> in 1997 further explored our fascination with tech.</p><p>Along with collaborator Jennifer Erwitt, Smolan published the beautiful <em><a href=\\"http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/12/17/blueplanet_smolan_q/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Blue Planet Run</a>&nbsp;</em>in 2007, about the drive to bring fresh drinking water to everyone on Earth. It&#39;s packed with glorious (and sometimes shocking) images and data about our planet&#39;s water. In an unprecedented move, Amazon.com offers <a href=\\"http://geni.us/blueplanetrun\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Blue Planet Run</em></a>  as a free PDF download. <a href=\\"http://geni.us/blueplanetrun\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><strong>Download the free PDF of <em>Blue Planet Run</em> &gt;&gt;</strong></a></p><p>Smolan&#39;s latest work is&nbsp;<em>The Obama Time Capsule, </em>a collection of photographs and insights capturing the historical election of President Barack Obama, from the beginning of his campaign to his first 100 days in office.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "rick_smolan", "whotheyare": "Rick Smolan is the co-founder of the America 24/7 and Day in the Life photography series -- and a natural storyteller in many media.

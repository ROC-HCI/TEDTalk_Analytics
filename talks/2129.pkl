VDre Urhahn: This theater  is built on Copacabana,
p5
aVwhich is the most famous  beach in the world,
p6
aVbut 25 kilometers away from here
p7
aVin the North Zone of Rio
p8
aVlies a community called Vila Cruzeiro,
p9
aVand roughly 60,000 people live there.
p10
aVNow, the people here in Rio mostly know
p11
aVVila Cruzeiro from the news,
p12
aVand unfortunately, news  from Vila Cruzeiro often
p13
aVis not good news.
p14
aVBut Vila Cruzeiro is also the place
p15
aVwhere our story begins.
p16
aa(lp17
VJeroen Koolhaas: Ten years  ago, we first came to Rio
p18
aVto shoot a documentary  about life in the favelas.
p19
aVNow, we learned that favelas  are informal communities.
p20
aVThey emerged over the years
p21
aVwhen immigrants from the countryside
p22
aVcame to the cities looking for work,
p23
aVlike cities within the cities,
p24
aVknown for problems like crime, poverty,
p25
aVand the violent drug war between
p26
aVpolice and the drug gangs.
p27
aVSo what struck us was that
p28
aVthese were communities that the people
p29
aVwho lived there had built  with their own hands,
p30
aVwithout a master plan
p31
aVand like a giant work in progress.
p32
aVWhere we're from, in Holland,
p33
aVeverything is planned.
p34
aVWe even have rules for  how to follow the rules.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VDU: So the last day of  filming, we ended up
p38
aVin Vila Cruzeiro, and  we were sitting down
p39
aVand we had a drink,
p40
aVand we were overlooking this hill
p41
aVwith all these houses,
p42
aVand most of these houses looked unfinished,
p43
aVand they had walls of bare brick,
p44
aVbut we saw some of these houses
p45
aVwhich were plastered and painted,
p46
aVand suddenly we had this idea:
p47
aVwhat would it look like if all these houses
p48
aVwould be plastered and painted?
p49
aVAnd then we imagined one big design,
p50
aVone big work of art.
p51
aVWho would expect something like that
p52
aVin a place like this?
p53
aVSo we thought, would that even be possible?
p54
aVSo first we started to count the houses,
p55
aVbut we soon lost count.
p56
aVBut somehow the idea stuck.
p57
aa(lp58
VJK: We had a friend.
p59
aVHe ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.
p60
aVHis name was Nanko,
p61
aVand he also liked the idea.
p62
aVHe said, "You know, everybody here
p63
aVwould pretty much love  to have their houses
p64
aVplastered and painted.
p65
aVIt's when a house is finished."
p66
aVSo he introduced us to the right people,
p67
aVand Vitor and Maurinho became our crew.
p68
aVWe picked three houses in the center of the community
p69
aVand we start here. We made a few designs,
p70
aVand everybody liked this design
p71
aVof a boy flying a kite the best.
p72
aVSo we started painting,  and the first thing we did
p73
aVwas to paint everything blue,
p74
aVand we thought that looked  already pretty good.
p75
aVBut they hated it. The people who lived there really hated it.
p76
aVThey said, "What did you do?
p77
aVYou painted our house in  exactly the same color
p78
aVas the police station."
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVIn a favela, that is not a good thing.
p81
aVAlso the same color as the prison cell.
p82
aVSo we quickly went ahead  and we painted the boy,
p83
aVand then we thought we were finished,
p84
aVwe were really happy, but still,
p85
aVit wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us,
p86
aVand they said, "You know,  there's a boy flying the kite,
p87
aVbut where is his kite?"
p88
aVWe said, "Uh, it's art.
p89
aVYou know, you have to imagine the kite."
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVAnd they said, "No, no, no,  we want to see the kite."
p92
aVSo we quickly installed a kite
p93
aVway up high on the hill,
p94
aVso that you could see  the boy flying the kite
p95
aVand you could actually see a kite.
p96
aVSo the local news started writing about it,
p97
aVwhich was great,
p98
aVand then even The Guardian wrote about it:
p99
aV"Notorious slum becomes open-air gallery."
p100
aa(lp101
VJK: So, encouraged by this success,
p102
aVwe went back to Rio for a second project,
p103
aVand we stumbled upon this street.
p104
aVIt was covered in concrete  to prevent mudslides,
p105
aVand somehow we saw a sort of river in it,
p106
aVand we imagined this river to be a river in Japanese style
p107
aVwith koi carp swimming upstream.
p108
aVSo we decided to paint that river,
p109
aVand we invited Rob Admiraal,
p110
aVwho is a tattoo artist,
p111
aVand he specialized in the Japanese style.
p112
aVSo little did we know that we would spend
p113
aValmost an entire year painting that river,
p114
aVtogether with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor,
p115
aVwho lived nearby.
p116
aVAnd we even moved into the neighborhood
p117
aVwhen one of the guys that  lived on the street, Elias,
p118
aVtold us that we could come  and live in his house,
p119
aVtogether with his family,
p120
aVwhich was fantastic.
p121
aVUnfortunately, during that time,
p122
aVanother war broke out between the police
p123
aVand the drug gangs.
p124
aV(Video) (Gunfire)
p125
aVWe learned that during those times,
p126
aVpeople in communities  really stick together
p127
aVduring these times of hardship,
p128
aVbut we also learned a  very important element,
p129
aVthe importance of barbecues.  (Laughter)
p130
aVBecause, when you throw a barbecue,
p131
aVit turns you from a guest into a host,
p132
aVso we decided to throw one
p133
aValmost every other week,
p134
aVand we got to know everybody  in the neighborhood.
p135
aa(lp136
VJK: We still had this  idea of the hill, though.
p137
aa(lp138
VDU: Yeah, yeah, we were talking about
p139
aVthe scale of this, because this painting
p140
aVwas incredibly big,
p141
aVand it was insanely detailed,
p142
aVand this process almost drove us completely insane ourselves.
p143
aVBut we figured that maybe,  during this process,
p144
aVall the time that we had  spent in the neighborhood
p145
aVwas maybe actually even more important
p146
aVthan the painting itself.
p147
aa(lp148
VJK: So after all that time,
p149
aVthis hill, this idea was still there,
p150
aVand we started to make sketches,
p151
aVmodels, and we figured something out.
p152
aVWe figured that our ideas, our designs
p153
aVhad to be a little bit more simple than that last project
p154
aVso that we could paint with more people
p155
aVand cover more houses at the same time.
p156
aVAnd we had an opportunity to try that out
p157
aVin a community in the central part of Rio,
p158
aVwhich is called Santa Marta,
p159
aVand we made a design for this place
p160
aVwhich looked like this,
p161
aVand then we got people to go along with it
p162
aVbecause turns out that if  your idea is ridiculously big,
p163
aVit's easier to get people to  go along with this. (Laughter)
p164
aVAnd the people of Santa Marta
p165
aVgot together and in a little over a month
p166
aVthey turned that square into this.
p167
aV(Applause)
p168
aVAnd this image somehow  went all over the world.
p169
aa(lp170
VDU: So then we received  an unexpected phone call
p171
aVfrom the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program,
p172
aVand they had this question
p173
aVif this idea, our approach,
p174
aVif this would actually  work in North Philly,
p175
aVwhich is one of the poorest neighborhoods
p176
aVin the United States.
p177
aVSo we immediately said yes.
p178
aVWe had no idea how,
p179
aVbut it seemed like a very  interesting challenge,
p180
aVso we did exactly the  same as we did in Rio,
p181
aVand we moved into the neighborhood
p182
aVand started barbecuing.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVSo the project took almost two years to complete,
p185
aVand we made individual designs
p186
aVfor every single house on  the avenue that we painted,
p187
aVand we made these designs together
p188
aVwith the local store owners,  the building owners,
p189
aVand a team of about a dozen  young men and women.
p190
aVThey were hired, and then they were trained as painters,
p191
aVand together they transformed their own neighborhood,
p192
aVthe whole street, into a  giant patchwork of color.
p193
aV(Applause)
p194
aVAnd at the end, the city of Philadelphia
p195
aVthanked every single one of them
p196
aVand gave them a merit for their accomplishment.
p197
aa(lp198
VJK: So now we had painted a whole street.
p199
aVHow about we do this whole hill now?
p200
aVWe started looking for funding,
p201
aVbut instead, we just ran into questions,
p202
aVlike, how many houses  are you going to paint?
p203
aVHow many square meters is that?
p204
aVHow much paint are you going to use,
p205
aVand how many people are you going to employ?
p206
aVAnd we did try for years to write plans
p207
aVfor the funding and answer  all those questions,
p208
aVbut then we thought,
p209
aVin order to answer all those questions,
p210
aVyou have to know exactly  what you're going to do
p211
aVbefore you actually get there and start.
p212
aVAnd maybe it's a mistake  to think like that.
p213
aVIt would lose some of the  magic that we had learned
p214
aVabout that if you go somewhere
p215
aVand you spend time there,
p216
aVyou can let the project grow organically
p217
aVand have a life of its own.
p218
aa(lp219
VDU: So what we did is
p220
aVwe decided to take this  plan and strip it away
p221
aVfrom all the numbers
p222
aVand all the ideas and presumptions
p223
aVand just go back to the base idea,
p224
aVwhich was to transform this hill
p225
aVinto a giant work of art.
p226
aVAnd instead of looking for funding,
p227
aVwe started a crowdfunding campaign,
p228
aVand in a little over a month,
p229
aVmore than 1,500 people put together
p230
aVand donated over 100,000 dollars.
p231
aVSo for us, this was an amazing  moment, because now \u2014
p232
aV(Applause) \u2014
p233
aVbecause now we finally had the freedom
p234
aVto use all the lessons that we had learned
p235
aVand create a project that was built
p236
aVthe same way that the favela was built,
p237
aVfrom the ground on up, bottom up,
p238
aVwith no master plan.
p239
aa(lp240
VJK: So we went back,  and we employed Angelo,
p241
aVand he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro,
p242
aVvery talented guy, and he knows almost everybody there,
p243
aVand then we employed Elias, our former landlord
p244
aVwho invited us into his house,
p245
aVand he's a master of construction.
p246
aVTogether with them, we decided where to start.
p247
aVWe picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro,
p248
aVand houses are being plastered as we speak.
p249
aVAnd the good thing about them is that
p250
aVthey are deciding which houses go next.
p251
aVThey're even printing t-shirts,
p252
aVthey're putting up banners
p253
aVexplaining everything to everybody,
p254
aVand talking to the press.
p255
aVThis article about Angelo appeared.
p256
aa(lp257
VDU: So while this is happening,
p258
aVwe are bringing this  idea all over the world.
p259
aVSo, like the project we  did in Philadelphia,
p260
aVwe are also invited to do workshops,
p261
aVfor instance in Curaçao,
p262
aVand right now we're planning  a huge project in Haiti.
p263
aa(lp264
VJK: So the favela was not only the place
p265
aVwhere this idea started:
p266
aVit was also the place that made it possible
p267
aVto work without a master plan,
p268
aVbecause these communities are informal \u2014
p269
aVthis was the inspiration \u2014
p270
aVand in a communal effort,  together with the people,
p271
aVyou can almost work like in an orchestra,
p272
aVwhere you can have a hundred instruments
p273
aVplaying together to create a symphony.
p274
aa(lp275
VDU: So we want to thank everybody who
p276
aVwanted to become part of this dream
p277
aVand supported us along the way,
p278
aVand we are looking at continuing.
p279
aa(lp280
VJK: Yeah. And so one day pretty soon,
p281
aVwhen the colors start  going up on these walls,
p282
aVwe hope more people will join us,
p283
aVand join this big dream,
p284
aVand maybe one day, the  whole of Vila Cruzeiro
p285
aVwill be painted.
p286
aa(lp287
VDU: Thank you.

VThe Hindus say, "Nada brahma,"
p5
aVone translation of which is, "The world is sound."
p6
aVAnd in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.
p7
aVIn fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.
p8
aVEvery part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.
p9
aVSo you are, in fact, a chord \u2014
p10
aVeach of you an individual chord.
p11
aVOne definition of health may be
p12
aVthat that chord is in complete harmony.
p13
aVYour ears can't hear that chord;
p14
aVthey can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves.
p15
aVIncidentally, we see just one octave.
p16
aVYour ears are always on \u2014 you have no ear lids.
p17
aVThey work even when you sleep.
p18
aVThe smallest sound you can perceive
p19
aVmoves your eardrum just four atomic diameters.
p20
aVThe loudest sound you can hear
p21
aVis a trillion times more powerful than that.
p22
aa(lp23
VEars are made not for hearing,
p24
aVbut for listening.
p25
aVListening is an active skill,
p26
aVwhereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at \u2014
p27
aVit's a relationship with sound.
p28
aVAnd yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.
p29
aVFor example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions,
p30
aVplaces you can listen from?
p31
aVHere are two of them.
p32
aVReductive listening is listening "for."
p33
aVIt reduces everything down to what's relevant
p34
aVand it discards everything that's not relevant.
p35
aVMen typically listen reductively.
p36
aVSo he's saying, "I've got this problem."
p37
aVHe's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next."
p38
aVThat's the way we talk, right guys?
p39
aa(lp40
VExpansive listening, on the other hand,
p41
aVis listening "with," not listening "for."
p42
aVIt's got no destination in mind \u2014
p43
aVit's just enjoying the journey.
p44
aVWomen typically listen expansively.
p45
aVIf you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other,
p46
aVpossibly both talking at the same time.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVMen, if you get nothing else out of this talk,
p49
aVpractice expansive listening,
p50
aVand you can transform your relationships.
p51
aa(lp52
VThe trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear
p53
aVis noise, surrounding us all the time.
p54
aVNoise like this, according to the European Union,
p55
aVis reducing the health and the quality of life
p56
aVof 25 percent
p57
aVof the population of Europe.
p58
aVTwo percent of the population of Europe \u2014
p59
aVthat's 16 million people \u2014
p60
aVare having their sleep devastated
p61
aVby noise like that.
p62
aVNoise kills
p63
aV200,000 people a year in Europe.
p64
aVIt's a really big problem.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it,
p67
aVyou'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.
p68
aVThese days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler.
p69
aVIt looks a bit like this.
p70
aVThe trouble with widespread headphone use
p71
aVis it brings three really big health issues.
p72
aVThe first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined:
p73
aV"schizophonia."
p74
aVIt's a dislocation
p75
aVbetween what you see and what you hear.
p76
aVSo, we're inviting into our lives
p77
aVthe voices of people who are not present with us.
p78
aVI think there's something deeply unhealthy
p79
aVabout living all the time in schizophonia.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe second problem that comes with headphone abuse
p82
aVis compression.
p83
aVWe squash music to fit it into our pocket
p84
aVand there is a cost attached to this.
p85
aVListen to this \u2014 this is an uncompressed piece of music.
p86
aV(Music)
p87
aVAnd now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed.
p88
aV(Music)
p89
aVI do hope that some of you at least
p90
aVcan hear the difference between those two.
p91
aVThere is a cost of compression.
p92
aVIt makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.
p93
aVYou're having to imagine it.
p94
aVIt's not good for you in the long run.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe third problem with headphones is this: deafness \u2014
p97
aVnoise-induced hearing disorder.
p98
aVTen million Americans already have this for one reason or another,
p99
aVbut really worryingly,
p100
aV16 percent \u2014
p101
aVroughly one in six \u2014 of American teenagers
p102
aVsuffer from noise-induced hearing disorder
p103
aVas a result of headphone abuse.
p104
aVOne study at an American university
p105
aVfound that 61 percent of college freshmen
p106
aVhad damaged hearing
p107
aVas a result of headphone abuse.
p108
aVWe may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.
p109
aVNow that's a really serious problem.
p110
aa(lp111
VI'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears
p112
aVand pass these on to your children, please.
p113
aVProfessional hearing protectors are great;
p114
aVI use some all the time.
p115
aVIf you're going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford
p116
aVbecause quality means you don't have to have it so loud.
p117
aVIf you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice,
p118
aVit's too loud.
p119
aVAnd thirdly, if you're in bad sound,
p120
aVit's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.
p121
aVProtect your ears in that way.
p122
aa(lp123
VLet's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out.
p124
aVWWB:
p125
aVWind, water, birds \u2014
p126
aVstochastic natural sounds
p127
aVcomposed of lots of individual random events,
p128
aVall of it very healthy,
p129
aVall of it sound that we evolved to over the years.
p130
aVSeek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.
p131
aVSilence is beautiful.
p132
aVThe Elizabethans described language
p133
aVas decorated silence.
p134
aVI urge you to move away from silence with intention
p135
aVand to design soundscapes just like works of art.
p136
aVHave a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion.
p137
aVIt's fun to get into designing with sound.
p138
aVIf you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.
p139
aVSound design is the future,
p140
aVand I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds.
p141
aa(lp142
VI'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities,
p143
aVeight ways sound can improve health.
p144
aVFirst, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy;
p145
aVit's also now being used to treat cancer.
p146
aVLithotripsy \u2014 saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel
p147
aVby pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.
p148
aVSound healing is a wonderful modality.
p149
aVIt's been around for thousands of years.
p150
aVI do urge you to explore this.
p151
aVThere are great things being done there, treating now autism,
p152
aVdementia and other conditions.
p153
aVAnd music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you,
p154
aVif it's music that's made with good intention,
p155
aVmade with love, generally.
p156
aVDevotional music, good \u2014 Mozart, good.
p157
aVThere are all sorts of types of music
p158
aVthat are very healthy.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd four modalities where you need to take some action
p161
aVand get involved.
p162
aVFirst of all, listen consciously.
p163
aVI hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.
p164
aVIt's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension.
p165
aVSecondly, get in touch with making some sound \u2014
p166
aVcreate sound.
p167
aVThe voice is the instrument we all play,
p168
aVand yet how many of us are trained in using our voice? Get trained;
p169
aVlearn to sing, learn to play an instrument.
p170
aVMusicians have bigger brains \u2014 it's true.
p171
aVYou can do this in groups as well.
p172
aVIt's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia;
p173
aVto make music and sound in a group of people,
p174
aVwhichever style you enjoy particularly.
p175
aVAnd let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.
p176
aVProtect your ears? Yes, absolutely.
p177
aVDesign soundscapes to be beautiful around you
p178
aVat home and at work.
p179
aVAnd let's start to speak up
p180
aVwhen people are assailing us
p181
aVwith the noise that I played you early on.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now
p184
aVto improve your health with sound.
p185
aVMy vision is of a world that sounds beautiful
p186
aVand if we all start doing these things,
p187
aVwe will take a very big step in that direction.
p188
aVSo I urge you to take that path.
p189
aa(lp190
VI'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you.
p191
aVI wish you sound health.

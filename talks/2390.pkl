VWell, I'm an ocean chemist.
p5
aVI look at the chemistry of the ocean today.
p6
aVI look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past.
p7
aVThe way I look back in the past
p8
aVis by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals.
p9
aVYou can see an image of one of these corals behind me.
p10
aVIt was collected from close to Antarctica, thousands of meters below the sea,
p11
aVso, very different than the kinds of corals
p12
aVyou may have been lucky enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo I'm hoping that this talk will give you
p15
aVa four-dimensional view of the ocean.
p16
aVTwo dimensions, such as this beautiful two-dimensional image
p17
aVof the sea surface temperature.
p18
aVThis was taken using satellite, so it's got tremendous spatial resolution.
p19
aVThe overall features are extremely easy to understand.
p20
aVThe equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight.
p21
aVThe polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight.
p22
aVAnd that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica
p23
aVand up in the Northern Hemisphere.
p24
aVIf you plunge deep into the sea, or even put your toes in the sea,
p25
aVyou know it gets colder as you go down,
p26
aVand that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean
p27
aVcome from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense.
p28
aa(lp29
VIf we travel back in time 20,000 years ago,
p30
aVthe earth looked very much different.
p31
aVAnd I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences
p32
aVyou would have seen if you went back that long.
p33
aVThe icecaps were much bigger.
p34
aVThey covered lots of the continent, and they extended out over the ocean.
p35
aVSea level was 120 meters lower.
p36
aVCarbon dioxide [levels] were very much lower than they are today.
p37
aVSo the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall,
p38
aVand much, much colder in the polar regions.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhat I'm trying to understand,
p41
aVand what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand,
p42
aVis how we moved from that cold climate condition
p43
aVto the warm climate condition that we enjoy today.
p44
aVWe know from ice core research
p45
aVthat the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions
p46
aVwasn't smooth, as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation.
p47
aVAnd we know this from ice cores, because if you drill down into ice,
p48
aVyou find annual bands of ice, and you can see this in the iceberg.
p49
aVYou can see those blue-white layers.
p50
aVGases are trapped in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 \u2014
p51
aVthat's why we know CO2 was lower in the past \u2014
p52
aVand the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature
p53
aVin the polar regions.
p54
aVAnd if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day,
p55
aVyou see that temperature increased.
p56
aVIt didn't increase smoothly.
p57
aVSometimes it increased very rapidly,
p58
aVthen there was a plateau,
p59
aVthen it increased rapidly.
p60
aVIt was different in the two polar regions,
p61
aVand CO2 also increased in jumps.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this.
p64
aVThe ocean stores huge amounts of carbon,
p65
aVabout 60 times more than is in the atmosphere.
p66
aVIt also acts to transport heat across the equator,
p67
aVand the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo if we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea,
p70
aVwe really need to get down there,
p71
aVsee what's there
p72
aVand start to explore.
p73
aVThis is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount
p74
aVabout a kilometer deep in international waters
p75
aVin the equatorial Atlantic, far from land.
p76
aVYou're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor,
p77
aValong with my research team.
p78
aVYou're probably seeing new species.
p79
aVWe don't know.
p80
aVYou'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy.
p81
aVYou can see beautiful bubblegum corals.
p82
aVThere are brittle stars growing on these corals.
p83
aVThose are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals.
p84
aVThere are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate
p85
aVgrowing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain,
p86
aVand the dark sort of stuff, those are fossilized corals,
p87
aVand we're going to talk a little more about those
p88
aVas we travel back in time.
p89
aa(lp90
VTo do that, we need to charter a research boat.
p91
aVThis is the James Cook, an ocean-class research vessel
p92
aVmoored up in Tenerife.
p93
aVLooks beautiful, right?
p94
aVGreat, if you're not a great mariner.
p95
aVSometimes it looks a little more like this.
p96
aVThis is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples.
p97
aVEveryone's scurrying around, and I get terribly seasick,
p98
aVso it's not always a lot of fun, but overall it is.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo we've got to become a really good mapper to do this.
p101
aVYou don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere.
p102
aVIt is global and it is deep,
p103
aVbut we need to really find the right places.
p104
aVWe just saw a global map, and overlaid was our cruise passage
p105
aVfrom last year.
p106
aVThis was a seven-week cruise,
p107
aVand this is us, having made our own maps
p108
aVof about 75,000 square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks,
p109
aVbut that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor.
p110
aVWe're traveling from west to east,
p111
aVover part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big-scale map,
p112
aVbut actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest.
p113
aVSo with the maps that we make on board,
p114
aVwe get about 100-meter resolution,
p115
aVenough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment,
p116
aVbut not enough to see very much.
p117
aVTo do that, we need to fly remotely-operated vehicles
p118
aVabout five meters off the seafloor.
p119
aVAnd if we do that, we can get maps that are one-meter resolution
p120
aVdown thousands of meters.
p121
aVHere is a remotely-operated vehicle,
p122
aVa research-grade vehicle.
p123
aVYou can see an array of big lights on the top.
p124
aVThere are high-definition cameras, manipulator arms,
p125
aVand lots of little boxes and things to put your samples.
p126
aa(lp127
VHere we are on our first dive of this particular cruise,
p128
aVplunging down into the ocean.
p129
aVWe go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles
p130
aVare not affected by any other ships.
p131
aVAnd we go down,
p132
aVand these are the kinds of things you see.
p133
aVThese are deep sea sponges, meter scale.
p134
aVThis is a swimming holothurian \u2014 it's a small sea slug, basically.
p135
aVThis is slowed down.
p136
aVMost of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up,
p137
aVbecause all of this takes a lot of time.
p138
aVThis is a beautiful holothurian as well.
p139
aVAnd this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise.
p140
aVI've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised.
p141
aVThis was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy,
p142
aVand suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past.
p143
aVIt's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate, if you like.
p144
aVThis wasn't what we were looking for.
p145
aVWe were looking for corals, deep sea corals.
p146
aVYou're going to see a picture of one in a moment.
p147
aVIt's small, about five centimeters high.
p148
aVIt's made of calcium carbonate, so you can see its tentacles there,
p149
aVmoving in the ocean currents.
p150
aVAn organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years.
p151
aVAnd as it grows, it takes in chemicals from the ocean.
p152
aVAnd the chemicals, or the amount of chemicals,
p153
aVdepends on the temperature; it depends on the pH,
p154
aVit depends on the nutrients.
p155
aVAnd if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton,
p156
aVwe can then go back, collect fossil specimens,
p157
aVand reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past.
p158
aVAnd here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system,
p159
aVand we put it into a sampling container.
p160
aVWe can do this very carefully, I should add.
p161
aa(lp162
VSome of these organisms live even longer.
p163
aVThis is a black coral called Leiopathes, an image taken by my colleague,
p164
aVBrendan Roark, about 500 meters below Hawaii.
p165
aVFour thousand years is a long time.
p166
aVIf you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up,
p167
aVthis is about 100 microns across.
p168
aVAnd Brendan took some analyses across this coral \u2014
p169
aVyou can see the marks \u2014
p170
aVand he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands,
p171
aVso even at 500 meters deep in the ocean,
p172
aVcorals can record seasonal changes,
p173
aVwhich is pretty spectacular.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum.
p176
aVSo what do we do?
p177
aVWe go in for these fossil specimens.
p178
aVThis is what makes me really unpopular with my research team.
p179
aVSo going along,
p180
aVthere's giant sharks everywhere,
p181
aVthere are pyrosomes, there are swimming holothurians,
p182
aVthere's giant sponges,
p183
aVbut I make everyone go down to these dead fossil areas
p184
aVand spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor.
p185
aVAnd we pick up all these corals, bring them back, we sort them out.
p186
aVBut each one of these is a different age,
p187
aVand if we can find out how old they are
p188
aVand then we can measure those chemical signals,
p189
aVthis helps us to find out
p190
aVwhat's been going on in the ocean in the past.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo on the left-hand image here,
p193
aVI've taken a slice through a coral, polished it very carefully
p194
aVand taken an optical image.
p195
aVOn the right-hand side,
p196
aVwe've taken that same piece of coral, put it in a nuclear reactor,
p197
aVinduced fission,
p198
aVand every time there's some decay,
p199
aVyou can see that marked out in the coral,
p200
aVso we can see the uranium distribution.
p201
aVWhy are we doing this?
p202
aVUranium is a very poorly regarded element,
p203
aVbut I love it.
p204
aVThe decay helps us find out about the rates and dates
p205
aVof what's going on in the ocean.
p206
aVAnd if you remember from the beginning,
p207
aVthat's what we want to get at when we're thinking about climate.
p208
aVSo we use a laser to analyze uranium
p209
aVand one of its daughter products, thorium, in these corals,
p210
aVand that tells us exactly how old the fossils are.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis beautiful animation of the Southern Ocean
p213
aVI'm just going to use illustrate how we're using these corals
p214
aVto get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks.
p215
aVYou can see the density of the surface water
p216
aVin this animation by Ryan Abernathey.
p217
aVIt's just one year of data,
p218
aVbut you can see how dynamic the Southern Ocean is.
p219
aVThe intense mixing, particularly the Drake Passage,
p220
aVwhich is shown by the box,
p221
aVis really one of the strongest currents in the world
p222
aVcoming through here, flowing from west to east.
p223
aVIt's very turbulently mixed,
p224
aVbecause it's moving over those great big undersea mountains,
p225
aVand this allows CO2 and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out.
p226
aVAnd essentially, the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean.
p227
aVWe've collected corals from back and forth across this Antarctic passage,
p228
aVand we've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating:
p229
aVthe corals migrated from south to north
p230
aVduring this transition from the glacial to the interglacial.
p231
aVWe don't really know why,
p232
aVbut we think it's something to do with the food source
p233
aVand maybe the oxygen in the water.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo here we are.
p236
aVI'm going to illustrate what I think we've found about climate
p237
aVfrom those corals in the Southern Ocean.
p238
aVWe went up and down sea mountains. We collected little fossil corals.
p239
aVThis is my illustration of that.
p240
aVWe think back in the glacial,
p241
aVfrom the analysis we've made in the corals,
p242
aVthat the deep part of the Southern Ocean was very rich in carbon,
p243
aVand there was a low-density layer sitting on top.
p244
aVThat stops carbon dioxide coming out of the ocean.
p245
aVWe then found corals that are of an intermediate age,
p246
aVand they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition.
p247
aVThat allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean.
p248
aVAnd then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day,
p249
aVor indeed if we go down there today anyway
p250
aVand measure the chemistry of the corals,
p251
aVwe see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out.
p252
aVSo this is the way we can use fossil corals
p253
aVto help us learn about the environment.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo I want to leave you with this last slide.
p256
aVIt's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you.
p257
aVThis is a spectacular coral garden.
p258
aVWe didn't even expect to find things this beautiful.
p259
aVIt's thousands of meters deep.
p260
aVThere are new species.
p261
aVIt's just a beautiful place.
p262
aVThere are fossils in amongst,
p263
aVand now I've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals
p264
aVthat are down there.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo next time you're lucky enough to fly over the ocean
p267
aVor sail over the ocean,
p268
aVjust think \u2014 there are massive sea mountains down there
p269
aVthat nobody's ever seen before,
p270
aVand there are beautiful corals.
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you.

To do this research, Robinson uses geochemical techniques, with an emphasis on radioactive elements including uranium series isotopes and radiocarbon. These elements are particularly valuable as they have a wide range of decay rates and geochemical properties and can be analyzed in geologic materials such as corals, marine sediments and seawater.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">Through a combination of field work and lab work, Robinson has been tackling questions relating to: timing of Pleistocene climate change events; palaeoclimate reconstructions; deep-sea coral paleo-biogeography; impact of weathering on the ocean and climate; biomineralization; development of new geochemical proxies for past climate conditions; chemical tracers of ocean circulation.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">Robinson describes the inspiration behind her work:</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">&ldquo;When I finished my PhD, I moved to California to work with Professor Jess Adkins at Caltech on a project using deep-sea corals. Before that time, like many people, I did not know that corals lived in the deep ocean. The first thing I did was prepare for a research cruise to the North Atlantic. We took the research submarine &#39;Alvin&#39; out to undersea mountains and were able to collect fossil corals from the seafloor. The start of my work in the Southern Ocean came from analysis of a single coral specimen from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington DC. They loaned us the sample, and we found that it was about 16,000 years old, just right for looking at the middle of the last global deglaciation. Being able to access and work on these specimens is a fantastic way of starting a science project. We published a paper on that sample, and then, together with a coral biologist, I wrote a proposal to fund specific expeditions to the Southern Ocean, and to the Equatorial Atlantic to gain a wider view of how the Atlantic Ocean behaved during major climate transitions.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">I love the research as it combines field work, lab work and collaborations with all kinds of people including scientists, engineers as well as the ships&#39; crews.

Robinson&#39;s research the processes that govern climate on time scales ranging from the modern day back through hundreds of thousands of years. To do this research, Robinson uses geochemical techniques, with an emphasis on radioactive elements including uranium series isotopes and radiocarbon. These elements are particularly valuable as they have a wide range of decay rates and geochemical properties and can be analyzed in geologic materials such as corals, marine sediments and seawater.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">Through a combination of field work and lab work, Robinson has been tackling questions relating to: timing of Pleistocene climate change events; palaeoclimate reconstructions; deep-sea coral paleo-biogeography; impact of weathering on the ocean and climate; biomineralization; development of new geochemical proxies for past climate conditions; chemical tracers of ocean circulation.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">Robinson describes the inspiration behind her work:</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">&ldquo;When I finished my PhD, I moved to California to work with Professor Jess Adkins at Caltech on a project using deep-sea corals. Before that time, like many people, I did not know that corals lived in the deep ocean. The first thing I did was prepare for a research cruise to the North Atlantic. We took the research submarine &#39;Alvin&#39; out to undersea mountains and were able to collect fossil corals from the seafloor. The start of my work in the Southern Ocean came from analysis of a single coral specimen from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington DC. They loaned us the sample, and we found that it was about 16,000 years old, just right for looking at the middle of the last global deglaciation. Being able to access and work on these specimens is a fantastic way of starting a science project. We published a paper on that sample, and then, together with a coral biologist, I wrote a proposal to fund specific expeditions to the Southern Ocean, and to the Equatorial Atlantic to gain a wider view of how the Atlantic Ocean behaved during major climate transitions.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">I love the research as it combines field work, lab work and collaborations with all kinds of people including scientists, engineers as well as the ships&#39; crews. In terms of scientists, I work with biologists, oceanographers, chemists, geologists, habitat specialists and a whole range of people who have technical expertise across these fields.&rdquo;</p><p class=\\"p2\\"><a href=\\"https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/so-anteco/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Learn more</a> about Robinson&#39;s current expidition in the Southern Ocean.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "laura_robinson", "whotheyare": "Dr. Laura Robinson\'s scientific mission is to document and understand the processes that govern climate.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 2843, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/07fd8e07247c825c028ee141f6b38824f6578806_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "The secrets I find on the mysterious ocean floor", "take_action": [], "comments": 27009, "more_resources": [], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/9a8ed14cef99ed36c93a952adf824345fb9e7108_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Hundreds of meters below the surface of the ocean, Laura Robinson probes the steep slopes of massive undersea mountains.

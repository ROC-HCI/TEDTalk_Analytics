VI decided when I was asked to do this
p5
aVthat what I really wanted to talk about was my friend, Richard Feynman.
p6
aVI was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him
p7
aVand enjoyed his presence.
p8
aVAnd I'm going to tell you about the Richard Feynman that I knew.
p9
aVI'm sure there are people here who could tell you
p10
aVabout the Richard Feynman they knew,
p11
aVand it would probably be a different Richard Feynman.
p12
aa(lp13
VRichard Feynman was a very complex man.
p14
aVHe was a man of many, many parts.
p15
aVHe was, of course, foremost, a very, very, very great scientist.
p16
aVHe was an actor. You saw him act.
p17
aVI also had the good fortune to be in those lectures,
p18
aVup in the balcony.
p19
aVThey were fantastic.
p20
aVHe was a philosopher.
p21
aVHe was a drum player.
p22
aVHe was a teacher par excellence.
p23
aVRichard Feynman was also a showman,
p24
aVan enormous showman.
p25
aVHe was brash, irreverent.
p26
aVHe was full of macho, a kind of macho one-upmanship.
p27
aVHe loved intellectual battle.
p28
aVHe had a gargantuan ego.
p29
aVBut the man had, somehow,
p30
aVa lot of room at the bottom.
p31
aVAnd what I mean by that is a lot of room, in my case \u2014
p32
aVI can't speak for anybody else, but in my case \u2014
p33
aVa lot of room for another big ego.
p34
aVWell, not as big as his,
p35
aVbut fairly big.
p36
aVI always felt good with Dick Feynman.
p37
aa(lp38
VIt was always fun to be with him.
p39
aVHe always made me feel smart.
p40
aVHow can somebody like that make you feel smart?
p41
aVSomehow he did.
p42
aVHe made me feel smart. He made me feel he was smart.
p43
aVHe made me feel we were both smart,
p44
aVand the two of us could solve any problem whatever.
p45
aVAnd in fact, we did sometimes do physics together.
p46
aVWe never published a paper together,
p47
aVbut we did have a lot of fun.
p48
aa(lp49
VHe loved to win,
p50
aVwin these little macho games we would sometimes play.
p51
aVAnd he didn't only play them with me, but with all sorts of people.
p52
aVHe would almost always win.
p53
aVBut when he didn't win, when he lost,
p54
aVhe would laugh and seem to have just as much fun
p55
aVas if he had won.
p56
aa(lp57
VI remember once he told me a story
p58
aVabout a joke the students played on him.
p59
aVI think it was for his birthday \u2014
p60
aVthey took him for lunch
p61
aVto a sandwich place in Pasadena.
p62
aVIt may still exist; I don't know.
p63
aVCelebrity sandwiches was their thing.
p64
aVYou could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich.
p65
aVYou could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich.
p66
aVThe students went there in advance,
p67
aVand arranged that they'd all order Feynman sandwiches.
p68
aVOne after another, they came in and ordered Feynman sandwiches.
p69
aVFeynman loved this story.
p70
aVHe told me this story, and he was really happy and laughing.
p71
aVWhen he finished the story, I said to him,
p72
aV"Dick, I wonder what would be the difference
p73
aVbetween a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich."
p74
aVAnd without skipping a beat at all,
p75
aVhe said, "Well, they'd be about the same.
p76
aVThe only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham."
p77
aV"Ham" as in bad actor.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VWell, I happened to have been very quick that day,
p82
aVand I said, "Yeah, but a lot less baloney."
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
V(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VThe truth of the matter
p89
aVis that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham,
p90
aVbut absolutely no baloney.
p91
aVWhat Feynman hated worse than anything else
p92
aVwas intellectual pretense \u2014
p93
aVphoniness,
p94
aVfalse sophistication, jargon.
p95
aVI remember sometime during the mid-'80s,
p96
aVDick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times
p97
aVup in San Francisco \u2014 at some very rich guy's house \u2014
p98
aVup in San Francisco for dinner.
p99
aVAnd the last time the rich guy invited us,
p100
aVhe also invited a couple of philosophers.
p101
aVThese guys were philosophers of mind.
p102
aVTheir specialty was the philosophy of consciousness.
p103
aVAnd they were full of all kinds of jargon.
p104
aVI'm trying to remember the words \u2014
p105
aV"monism," "dualism," categories all over the place.
p106
aVI didn't know what those meant, neither did Dick or Sydney, for that matter.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd what did we talk about?
p109
aVWell, what do you talk about when you talk about minds?
p110
aVThere's one obvious thing to talk about:
p111
aVCan a machine become a mind?
p112
aVCan you build a machine
p113
aVthat thinks like a human being that is conscious?
p114
aVWe sat around and talked about this \u2014 we of course never resolved it.
p115
aVBut the trouble with the philosophers
p116
aVis that they were philosophizing
p117
aVwhen they should have been science-ophizing.
p118
aVIt's a scientific question, after all.
p119
aVAnd this was a very, very dangerous thing to do
p120
aVaround Dick Feynman.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VFeynman let them have it \u2014 both barrels, right between the eyes.
p125
aVIt was brutal; it was funny \u2014 ooh, it was funny.
p126
aVBut it was really brutal.
p127
aVHe really popped their balloon.
p128
aVBut the amazing thing was \u2014 Feynman had to leave a little early;
p129
aVhe wasn't feeling too well, so he left a little bit early.
p130
aVAnd Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers.
p131
aVAnd the amazing thing is these guys were flying.
p132
aVThey were so happy.
p133
aVThey had met the great man;
p134
aVthey had been instructed by the great man;
p135
aVthey had an enormous amount of fun
p136
aVhaving their faces shoved in the mud ...
p137
aVAnd it was something special.
p138
aVI realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman,
p139
aVeven when he did what he did.
p140
aa(lp141
VDick \u2014 he was my friend; I did call him Dick \u2014
p142
aVDick and I had a little bit of a rapport.
p143
aVI think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had.
p144
aVWe liked each other; we liked the same kind of things.
p145
aVI also like the intellectual macho games.
p146
aVSometimes I would win, mostly he would win,
p147
aVbut we both enjoyed them.
p148
aVAnd Dick became convinced at some point
p149
aVthat he and I had some kind of similarity of personality.
p150
aVI don't think he was right.
p151
aVI think the only point of similarity between us
p152
aVis we both like to talk about ourselves.
p153
aVBut he was convinced of this.
p154
aVAnd the man was incredibly curious.
p155
aVAnd he wanted to understand what it was and why it was
p156
aVthat there was this funny connection.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd one day, we were walking.
p159
aVWe were in France, in Les Houches.
p160
aVWe were up in the mountains, 1976.
p161
aVAnd Feynman said to me, "Leonardo ..."
p162
aVThe reason he called me "Leonardo" is because we were in Europe,
p163
aVand he was practicing his French.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd he said, "Leonardo,
p168
aVwere you closer to your mother or your father when you were a kid?"
p169
aVI said, "Well, my real hero was my father.
p170
aVHe was a working man,
p171
aVhad a fifth-grade education.
p172
aVHe was a master mechanic, and he taught me how to use tools.
p173
aVHe taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things.
p174
aVHe even taught me the Pythagorean theorem.
p175
aVHe didn't call it the hypotenuse,
p176
aVhe called it the shortcut distance."
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd Feynman's eyes just opened up.
p179
aVHe went off like a lightbulb.
p180
aVAnd he said that he had had
p181
aVbasically exactly the same relationship with his father.
p182
aVIn fact, he had been convinced at one time
p183
aVthat to be a good physicist,
p184
aVit was very important to have had that kind of relationship
p185
aVwith your father.
p186
aVI apologize for the sexist conversation here,
p187
aVbut this is the way it really happened.
p188
aa(lp189
VHe said he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary,
p190
aVa necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist.
p191
aVBeing Dick, he, of course, wanted to check this.
p192
aVHe wanted to go out and do an experiment.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VWell, he did.
p197
aVHe went out and did an experiment.
p198
aVHe asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists,
p199
aV"Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you?"
p200
aVThey were all men,
p201
aVand to a man, every single one of them said,
p202
aV"My mother."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VThere went that theory, down the trash can of history.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VBut he was very excited that he had finally met somebody
p211
aVwho had the same experience with his father
p212
aVas he had with his father.
p213
aVAnd for some time, he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well.
p214
aVI don't know. Maybe. Who knows?
p215
aa(lp216
VBut let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist.
p217
aVFeynman's style \u2014 no, "style" is not the right word.
p218
aV"Style" makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn,
p219
aVor the suit he was wearing.
p220
aVIt's something much deeper than that,
p221
aVbut I can't think of another word for it.
p222
aVFeynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest,
p223
aVmost elementary solution to a problem that was possible.
p224
aVIf it wasn't possible, you had to use something fancier.
p225
aVNo doubt, part of this was his great joy and pleasure
p226
aVin showing people that he could think more simply than they could.
p227
aVBut he also deeply believed, he truly believed,
p228
aVthat if you couldn't explain something simply,
p229
aVyou didn't understand it.
p230
aVIn the 1950s, people were trying to figure out
p231
aVhow superfluid helium worked.
p232
aa(lp233
VThere was a theory.
p234
aVIt was due to a Russian mathematical physicist.
p235
aVIt was a complicated theory;
p236
aVI'll tell you what it was soon enough.
p237
aVIt was a terribly complicated theory,
p238
aVfull of very difficult integrals and formulas
p239
aVand mathematics and so forth.
p240
aVAnd it sort of worked, but it didn't work very well.
p241
aVThe only way it worked
p242
aVis when the helium atoms were very, very far apart.
p243
aVAnd unfortunately,
p244
aVthe helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other.
p245
aa(lp246
VFeynman decided, as a sort of amateur helium physicist,
p247
aVthat he would try to figure it out.
p248
aVHe had an idea, a very clear idea.
p249
aVHe would try to figure out
p250
aVwhat the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like.
p251
aVHe would try to visualize it,
p252
aVguided by a small number of simple principles.
p253
aVThe small number of simple principles were very, very simple.
p254
aVThe first one was that when helium atoms touch each other,
p255
aVthey repel.
p256
aVThe implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero,
p257
aVit has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other.
p258
aVThe other fact is that in the ground state \u2014
p259
aVthe lowest energy state of a quantum system \u2014
p260
aVthe wave function is always very smooth;
p261
aVit has the minimum number of wiggles.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo he sat down \u2014
p264
aVand I imagine he had nothing more
p265
aVthan a simple piece of paper and a pencil \u2014
p266
aVand he tried to write down, and did write down,
p267
aVthe simplest function that he could think of,
p268
aVwhich had the boundary conditions
p269
aVthat the wave function vanish when things touch
p270
aVand is smooth in between.
p271
aVHe wrote down a simple thing \u2014 so simple, in fact,
p272
aVthat I suspect a really smart high-school student
p273
aVwho didn't even have calculus
p274
aVcould understand what he wrote down.
p275
aVThe thing was, that simple thing that he wrote down
p276
aVexplained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium,
p277
aVand then some.
p278
aa(lp279
VI've always wondered whether the professionals \u2014
p280
aVthe real professional helium physicists \u2014
p281
aVwere just a little bit embarrassed by this.
p282
aVThey had their super-powerful technique,
p283
aVand they couldn't do as well.
p284
aVIncidentally, I'll tell you what that super-powerful technique was.
p285
aVIt was the technique of Feynman diagrams.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
VHe did it again in 1968.
p290
aVIn 1968, in my own university \u2014 I wasn't there at the time \u2014
p291
aVthey were exploring the structure of the proton.
p292
aVThe proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles;
p293
aVthis was more or less known.
p294
aVAnd the way to analyze it was, of course, Feynman diagrams.
p295
aVThat's what Feynman diagrams were constructed for \u2014
p296
aVto understand particles.
p297
aVThe experiments that were going on were very simple:
p298
aVyou simply take the proton,
p299
aVand you hit it really sharply with an electron.
p300
aVThis was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for.
p301
aa(lp302
VThe only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated.
p303
aVThey're difficult integrals.
p304
aVIf you could do all of them, you would have a very precise theory,
p305
aVbut you couldn't \u2014 they were just too complicated.
p306
aVPeople were trying to do them.
p307
aVYou could do a one-loop diagram. Don't worry about one loop.
p308
aVOne loop, two loops \u2014 maybe you could do a three-loop diagram,
p309
aVbut beyond that, you couldn't do anything.
p310
aa(lp311
VFeynman said, "Forget all of that.
p312
aVJust think of the proton
p313
aVas an assemblage, a swarm, of little particles."
p314
aVHe called them "partons."
p315
aVHe said, "Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast."
p316
aVBecause they're moving real fast,
p317
aVrelativity says the internal motions go very slow.
p318
aVThe electron hits it suddenly \u2014
p319
aVit's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton.
p320
aVWhat do you see?
p321
aVYou see a frozen bunch of partons.
p322
aVThey don't move,
p323
aVand because they don't move during the course of the experiment,
p324
aVyou don't have to worry about how they're moving.
p325
aVYou don't have to worry about the forces between them.
p326
aVYou just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons."
p327
aVThis was the key to analyzing these experiments.
p328
aVExtremely effective.
p329
aVSomebody said the word "revolution" is a bad word.
p330
aVI suppose it is, so I won't say "revolution,"
p331
aVbut it certainly evolved very, very deeply our understanding of the proton,
p332
aVand of particles beyond that.
p333
aa(lp334
VWell, I had some more that I was going to tell you
p335
aVabout my connection with Feynman,
p336
aVwhat he was like,
p337
aVbut I see I have exactly half a minute.
p338
aVSo I think I'll just finish up by saying:
p339
aVI actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event.
p340
aVI think he would have said, "I don't need this."
p341
aVBut ...
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
VHow should we honor Feynman?
p346
aVHow should we really honor Feynman?
p347
aVI think the answer is we should honor Feynman
p348
aVby getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches
p349
aVas we can.
p350
aa(lp351
VThank you.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Applause)

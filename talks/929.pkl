VI grew up on a small farm in Missouri.
p5
aVWe lived on less than a dollar a day
p6
aVfor about 15 years.
p7
aVI got a scholarship, went to university,
p8
aVstudied international agriculture, studied anthropology,
p9
aVand decided I was going to give back.
p10
aVI was going to work with small farmers.
p11
aVI was going to help alleviate poverty.
p12
aVI was going to work on international development,
p13
aVand then I took a turn
p14
aVand ended up here.
p15
aVNow, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach,
p16
aVyou don't always end up in a place like this.
p17
aVIt's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab.
p18
aVYou could be in New York.
p19
aVWhat I found was,
p20
aVI started working with refugees and famine victims \u2014
p21
aVsmall farmers, all, or nearly all \u2014
p22
aVwho had been dispossessed and displaced.
p23
aVNow, what I'd been trained to do
p24
aVwas methodological research on such people.
p25
aVSo I did it: I found out how many women
p26
aVhad been raped en route to these camps.
p27
aVI found out how many people had been put in jail,
p28
aVhow many family members had been killed.
p29
aVI assessed how long they were going to stay
p30
aVand how much it would take to feed them.
p31
aVAnd I got really good at predicting
p32
aVhow many body bags you would need
p33
aVfor the people who were going to die in these camps.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow this is God's work, but it's not my work.
p36
aVIt's not the work I set out to do.
p37
aVSo I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests
p38
aVin 1988.
p39
aVI met a guy \u2014 the guy on the left.
p40
aVHis name was Ben.
p41
aVHe said, "What can I do to save the rainforests?"
p42
aVI said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?"
p43
aV"I make ice cream."
p44
aVSo I said, "Well, you've got to make
p45
aVa rainforest ice cream.
p46
aVAnd you've got to use nuts from the rainforests
p47
aVto show that forests are worth more as forests
p48
aVthan they are as pasture."
p49
aVHe said, "Okay."
p50
aVWithin a year,
p51
aVRainforest Crunch was on the shelves.
p52
aVIt was a great success.
p53
aVWe did our first million-dollars-worth of trade
p54
aVby buying on 30 days and selling on 21.
p55
aVThat gets your adrenaline going.
p56
aVThen we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit
p57
aVbecause we were credit-worthy at that point.
p58
aVWe had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent
p59
aVof the global Brazil-nut market.
p60
aVWe paid two to three times more than anybody else.
p61
aVEverybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts
p62
aVbecause we would buy it otherwise.
p63
aVA great success.
p64
aV50 companies signed up, 200 products came out,
p65
aVgenerated 100 million in sales.
p66
aVIt failed.
p67
aVWhy did it fail?
p68
aVBecause the people who were gathering Brazil nuts
p69
aVweren't the same people who were cutting the forests.
p70
aVAnd the people who made money from Brazil nuts
p71
aVwere not the people who made money from cutting the forests.
p72
aVWe were attacking the wrong driver.
p73
aVWe needed to be working on beef.
p74
aVWe needed to be working on lumber.
p75
aVWe needed to be working on soy \u2014
p76
aVthings that we were not focused on.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo let's go back to Sudan.
p79
aVI often talk to refugees:
p80
aV"Why was it that the West didn't realize
p81
aVthat famines are caused by policies and politics,
p82
aVnot by weather?"
p83
aVAnd this farmer said to me, one day,
p84
aVsomething that was very profound.
p85
aVHe said, "You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep."
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VOkay. Fast forward.
p90
aVWe live on a planet.
p91
aVThere's just one of them.
p92
aVWe've got to wake up to the fact
p93
aVthat we don't have any more
p94
aVand that this is a finite planet.
p95
aVWe know the limits of the resources we have.
p96
aVWe may be able to use them differently.
p97
aVWe may have some innovative, new ideas.
p98
aVBut in general, this is what we've got.
p99
aVThere's no more of it.
p100
aVThere's a basic equation that we can't get away from.
p101
aVPopulation times consumption
p102
aVhas got to have some kind of relationship to the planet,
p103
aVand right now, it's a simple "not equal."
p104
aVOur work shows that we're living
p105
aVat about 1.3 planets.
p106
aVSince 1990,
p107
aVwe crossed the line
p108
aVof being in a sustainable relationship to the planet.
p109
aVNow we're at 1.3.
p110
aVIf we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed.
p111
aVFor bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest.
p112
aVThis is where we stand today.
p113
aVA lot of people like to point
p114
aVto some place else as the cause of the problem.
p115
aVIt's always population growth.
p116
aVPopulation growth's important,
p117
aVbut it's also about how much each person consumes.
p118
aVSo when the average American
p119
aVconsumes 43 times as much
p120
aVas the average African,
p121
aVwe've got to think that consumption is an issue.
p122
aVIt's not just about population,
p123
aVand it's not just about them; it's about us.
p124
aVBut it's not just about people;
p125
aVit's about lifestyles.
p126
aVThere's very good evidence \u2014
p127
aVagain, we don't necessarily have
p128
aVa peer-reviewed methodology
p129
aVthat's bulletproof yet \u2014
p130
aVbut there's very good evidence
p131
aVthat the average cat in Europe
p132
aVhas a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime
p133
aVthan the average African.
p134
aVYou think that's not an issue going forward?
p135
aVYou think that's not a question
p136
aVas to how we should be using the Earth's resources?
p137
aa(lp138
VLet's go back and visit our equation.
p139
aVIn 2000, we had six billion people on the planet.
p140
aVThey were consuming what they were consuming \u2014
p141
aVlet's say one unit of consumption each.
p142
aVWe have six billion units of consumption.
p143
aVBy 2050,
p144
aVwe're going to have nine billion people \u2014 all the scientists agree.
p145
aVThey're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do \u2014
p146
aVscientists, again, agree \u2014
p147
aVbecause income is going to grow in developing countries
p148
aVfive times what it is today \u2014
p149
aVon global average, about [2.9].
p150
aVSo we're going to have 18 billion units of consumption.
p151
aVWho have you heard talking lately
p152
aVthat's said we have to triple production
p153
aVof goods and services?
p154
aVBut that's what the math says.
p155
aVWe're not going to be able to do that.
p156
aVWe can get productivity up.
p157
aVWe can get efficiency up.
p158
aVBut we've also got to get consumption down.
p159
aVWe need to use less
p160
aVto make more.
p161
aVAnd then we need to use less again.
p162
aVAnd then we need to consume less.
p163
aVAll of those things are part of that equation.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut it basically raises a fundamental question:
p166
aVshould consumers have a choice
p167
aVabout sustainability, about sustainable products?
p168
aVShould you be able to buy a product that's sustainable
p169
aVsitting next to one that isn't,
p170
aVor should all the products on the shelf be sustainable?
p171
aVIf they should all be sustainable on a finite planet,
p172
aVhow do you make that happen?
p173
aVThe average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.
p174
aVOkay, so let's be generous.
p175
aVLet's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe.
p176
aVHow do you evaluate all the scientific data
p177
aVaround a product,
p178
aVthe data that's changing on a weekly, if not a daily, basis?
p179
aVHow do you get informed?
p180
aVYou don't.
p181
aVHere's a little question.
p182
aVFrom a greenhouse gas perspective,
p183
aVis lamb produced in the U.K.
p184
aVbetter than lamb produced in New Zealand,
p185
aVfrozen and shipped to the U.K.?
p186
aVIs a bad feeder lot operation for beef
p187
aVbetter or worse than
p188
aVa bad grazing operation for beef?
p189
aVDo organic potatoes
p190
aVactually have fewer toxic chemicals
p191
aVused to produce them
p192
aVthan conventional potatoes?
p193
aVIn every single case,
p194
aVthe answer is "it depends."
p195
aVIt depends on who produced it and how,
p196
aVin every single instance.
p197
aVAnd there are many others.
p198
aVHow is a consumer going to walk through this minefield?
p199
aVThey're not.
p200
aVThey may have a lot of opinions about it,
p201
aVbut they're not going to be terribly informed.
p202
aa(lp203
VSustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue.
p204
aVIt's got to be something we all care about.
p205
aVAnd we need collusion.
p206
aVWe need groups to work together that never have.
p207
aVWe need Cargill to work with Bunge.
p208
aVWe need Coke to work with Pepsi.
p209
aVWe need Oxford to work with Cambridge.
p210
aVWe need Greenpeace to work with WWF.
p211
aVEverybody's got to work together \u2014
p212
aVChina and the U.S.
p213
aVWe need to begin to manage this planet
p214
aVas if our life depended on it,
p215
aVbecause it does,
p216
aVit fundamentally does.
p217
aVBut we can't do everything.
p218
aVEven if we get everybody working on it,
p219
aVwe've got to be strategic.
p220
aVWe need to focus on the where,
p221
aVthe what and the who.
p222
aVSo, the where:
p223
aVWe've identified 35 places globally that we need to work.
p224
aVThese are the places that are the richest in biodiversity
p225
aVand the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view.
p226
aVWe have to work in these places.
p227
aVWe have to save these places if we want a chance in hell
p228
aVof preserving biodiversity as we know it.
p229
aVWe looked at the threats to these places.
p230
aVThese are the 15 commodities
p231
aVthat fundamentally pose the biggest threats
p232
aVto these places
p233
aVbecause of deforestation,
p234
aVsoil loss, water use, pesticide use,
p235
aVover-fishing, etc.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo we've got 35 places,
p238
aVwe've got 15 priority commodities,
p239
aVwho do we work with
p240
aVto change the way those commodities are produced?
p241
aVAre we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?
p242
aVLet's see, that's about 7,000 languages,
p243
aV350 major languages \u2014
p244
aVa lot of work there.
p245
aVI don't see anybody actually being able
p246
aVto do that very effectively.
p247
aVAre we going to work with 1.5 billion producers?
p248
aVAgain, a daunting task.
p249
aVThere must be a better way.
p250
aV300 to 500 companies
p251
aVcontrol 70 percent or more
p252
aVof the trade of each of the 15 commodities
p253
aVthat we've identified as the most significant.
p254
aVIf we work with those, if we change those companies
p255
aVand the way they do business,
p256
aVthen the rest will happen automatically.
p257
aVSo, we went through our 15 commodities.
p258
aVThis is nine of them.
p259
aVWe lined them up side-by-side,
p260
aVand we put the names of the companies that work
p261
aVon each of those.
p262
aVAnd if you go through the first 25 or 30 names
p263
aVof each of the commodities,
p264
aVwhat you begin to see is,
p265
aVgosh, there's Cargill here, there's Cargill there,
p266
aVthere's Cargill everywhere.
p267
aVIn fact, these names start coming up over and over again.
p268
aVSo we did the analysis again a slightly different way.
p269
aVWe said: if we take the top hundred companies,
p270
aVwhat percentage
p271
aVof all 15 commodities
p272
aVdo they touch, buy or sell?
p273
aVAnd what we found is it's 25 percent.
p274
aVSo 100 companies
p275
aVcontrol 25 percent of the trade
p276
aVof all 15 of the most significant
p277
aVcommodities on the planet.
p278
aVWe can get our arms around a hundred companies.
p279
aVA hundred companies, we can work with.
p280
aa(lp281
VWhy is 25 percent important?
p282
aVBecause if these companies demand sustainable products,
p283
aVthey'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production.
p284
aVCompanies can push producers
p285
aVfaster than consumers can.
p286
aVBy companies asking for this,
p287
aVwe can leverage production so much faster
p288
aVthan by waiting for consumers to do it.
p289
aVAfter 40 years, the global organic movement
p290
aVhas achieved 0.7 of one percent
p291
aVof global food.
p292
aVWe can't wait that long.
p293
aVWe don't have that kind of time.
p294
aVWe need change
p295
aVthat's going to accelerate.
p296
aVEven working with individual companies
p297
aVis not probably going to get us there.
p298
aVWe need to begin to work with industries.
p299
aVSo we've started roundtables
p300
aVwhere we bring together the entire value chain,
p301
aVfrom producers
p302
aVall the way to the retailers and brands.
p303
aVWe bring in civil society, we bring in NGOs,
p304
aVwe bring in researchers and scientists
p305
aVto have an informed discussion \u2014
p306
aVsometimes a battle royale \u2014
p307
aVto figure out what are the key impacts
p308
aVof these products,
p309
aVwhat is a global benchmark,
p310
aVwhat's an acceptable impact,
p311
aVand design standards around that.
p312
aVIt's not all fun and games.
p313
aa(lp314
VIn salmon aquaculture,
p315
aVwe kicked off a roundtable
p316
aValmost six years ago.
p317
aVEight entities came to the table.
p318
aVWe eventually got, I think, 60 percent
p319
aVof global production at the table
p320
aVand 25 percent of demand at the table.
p321
aVThree of the original eight entities were suing each other.
p322
aVAnd yet, next week, we launch
p323
aVglobally verified, vetted and certified
p324
aVstandards for salmon aquaculture.
p325
aVIt can happen.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Applause)
p328
aa(lp329
VSo what brings
p330
aVthe different entities to the table?
p331
aVIt's risk and demand.
p332
aVFor the big companies, it's reputational risk,
p333
aVbut more importantly,
p334
aVthey don't care what the price of commodities is.
p335
aVIf they don't have commodities, they don't have a business.
p336
aVThey care about availability,
p337
aVso the big risk for them is not having product at all.
p338
aVFor the producers,
p339
aVif a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way,
p340
aVthat's what brings them to the table.
p341
aVSo it's the demand that brings them to the table.
p342
aVThe good news is
p343
aVwe identified a hundred companies two years ago.
p344
aVIn the last 18 months, we've signed agreements
p345
aVwith 40 of those hundred companies
p346
aVto begin to work with them on their supply chain.
p347
aVAnd in the next 18 months,
p348
aVwe will have signed up to work with another 40,
p349
aVand we think we'll get those signed as well.
p350
aVNow what we're doing is bringing the CEOs
p351
aVof these 80 companies together
p352
aVto help twist the arms of the final 20,
p353
aVto bring them to the table,
p354
aVbecause they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs,
p355
aVthey're concerned about this, they're concerned about that,
p356
aVbut we all need to be in this together.
p357
aVSo we're pulling out all the stops.
p358
aVWe're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table.
p359
aa(lp360
VOne company we're working with that's begun \u2014
p361
aVin baby steps, perhaps \u2014
p362
aVbut has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill.
p363
aVThey've funded research that shows
p364
aVthat we can double global palm oil production
p365
aVwithout cutting a single tree in the next 20 years,
p366
aVand do it all in Borneo alone
p367
aVby planting on land that's already degraded.
p368
aVThe study shows that the highest net present value
p369
aVfor palm oil
p370
aVis on land that's been degraded.
p371
aVThey're also undertaking a study to look at
p372
aVall of their supplies of palm oil
p373
aVto see if they could be certified
p374
aVand what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified
p375
aVunder a credible certification program.
p376
aVWhy is Cargill important?
p377
aVBecause Cargill has 20 to 25 percent
p378
aVof global palm oil.
p379
aVIf Cargill makes a decision,
p380
aVthe entire palm oil industry moves,
p381
aVor at least 40 or 50 percent of it.
p382
aVThat's not insignificant.
p383
aVMore importantly, Cargill and one other company
p384
aVship 50 percent of the palm oil
p385
aVthat goes to China.
p386
aVWe don't have to change the way
p387
aVa single Chinese company works
p388
aVif we get Cargill to only send
p389
aVsustainable palm oil to China.
p390
aVIt's a pre-competitive issue.
p391
aVAll the palm oil going there is good.
p392
aVBuy it.
p393
aa(lp394
VMars is also on a similar journey.
p395
aVNow most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company,
p396
aVbut Mars has made sustainability pledges
p397
aVto buy only certified product for all of its seafood.
p398
aVIt turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart
p399
aVbecause of pet food.
p400
aVBut they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate,
p401
aVand it all comes from the fact
p402
aVthat Mars wants to be in business in the future.
p403
aVAnd what they see is that they need to
p404
aVimprove chocolate production.
p405
aVOn any given plantation,
p406
aV20 percent of the trees produce 80 percent of the crop,
p407
aVso Mars is looking at the genome,
p408
aVthey're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant.
p409
aVThey're doing it with IBM and the USDA,
p410
aVand they're putting it in the public domain
p411
aVbecause they want everybody to have access to this data,
p412
aVbecause they want everybody to help them
p413
aVmake cocoa more productive and more sustainable.
p414
aVWhat they've realized
p415
aVis that if they can identify the traits
p416
aVon productivity and drought tolerance,
p417
aVthey can produce 320 percent as much cocoa
p418
aVon 40 percent of the land.
p419
aVThe rest of the land can be used for something else.
p420
aVIt's more with less and less again.
p421
aVThat's what the future has got to be,
p422
aVand putting it in the public domain is smart.
p423
aVThey don't want to be an I.P. company; they want to be a chocolate company,
p424
aVbut they want to be a chocolate company forever.
p425
aa(lp426
VNow, the price of food, many people complain about,
p427
aVbut in fact, the price of food is going down,
p428
aVand that's odd because in fact,
p429
aVconsumers are not paying for the true cost of food.
p430
aVIf you take a look just at water,
p431
aVwhat we see is that,
p432
aVwith four very common products,
p433
aVyou look at how much a farmer produced to make those products,
p434
aVand then you look at how much water input was put into them,
p435
aVand then you look at what the farmer was paid.
p436
aVIf you divide the amount of water
p437
aVinto what the farmer was paid,
p438
aVthe farmer didn't receive enough money
p439
aVto pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities.
p440
aVThat is an externality by definition.
p441
aVThis is the subsidy from nature.
p442
aVCoca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water,
p443
aVbut right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts
p444
aVwith growers in Turkey
p445
aVto sell juice into Europe,
p446
aVand they're doing that because they want to have a product
p447
aVthat's closer to the European market.
p448
aVBut they're not just buying the juice;
p449
aVthey're also buying the carbon in the trees
p450
aVto offset the shipment costs associated with carbon
p451
aVto get the product into Europe.
p452
aVThere's carbon that's being bought with sugar,
p453

VI was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company,
p5
aV81's platoon,
p6
aVout in Camp Pendleton, California.
p7
aVOorah!
p8
aa(lp9
VAudience: Oorah!
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI joined a few months after September 11,
p14
aVfeeling like I think most people in the country did at the time,
p15
aVfilled with a sense of patriotism and retribution
p16
aVand the desire to do something \u2014
p17
aVthat, coupled with that fact that I wasn't doing anything.
p18
aVI was 17, just graduated from high school that past summer,
p19
aVliving in the back room of my parents' house paying rent,
p20
aVin the small town I was raised in in Northern Indiana,
p21
aVcalled Mishawaka.
p22
aVI can spell that later for people who are interested \u2014
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VMishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not,
p27
aVso my only exposure to theater and film
p28
aVwas limited to the plays I did in high school
p29
aVand Blockbuster Video, may she rest in peace.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VI was serious enough about acting
p34
aVthat I auditioned for Juilliard when I was a senior in high school,
p35
aVdidn't get in,
p36
aVdetermined college wasn't for me and applied nowhere else,
p37
aVwhich was a genius move.
p38
aVI also did that Hail Mary LA acting odyssey
p39
aVthat I always heard stories about,
p40
aVof actors moving to LA with, like, seven dollars
p41
aVand finding work and successful careers.
p42
aVI got as far as Amarillo, Texas, before my car broke down.
p43
aVI spent all my money repairing it,
p44
aVfinally made it to Santa Monica \u2014
p45
aVnot even LA \u2014
p46
aVstayed for 48 hours wandering the beach, basically,
p47
aVgot in my car, drove home,
p48
aVthus ending my acting career, so \u2014
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VSeventeen, Mishawaka ...
p53
aVparents' house, paying rent, selling vacuums ...
p54
aVtelemarketing,
p55
aVcutting grass at the local 4-H fairgrounds.
p56
aVThis was my world going into September, 2001.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo after the 11th,
p59
aVand feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,
p60
aVand just being pissed off in general \u2014 at myself,
p61
aVmy parents, the government;
p62
aVnot having confidence, not having a respectable job,
p63
aVmy shitty mini-fridge that I just drove to California and back \u2014
p64
aVI joined the Marine Corps and loved it. I loved being a Marine.
p65
aVIt's one of the things I'm most proud of having done in my life.
p66
aVFiring weapons was cool,
p67
aVdriving and detonating expensive things was great.
p68
aVBut I found I loved the Marine Corps the most
p69
aVfor the thing I was looking for the least when I joined,
p70
aVwhich was the people:
p71
aVthese weird dudes \u2014 a motley crew of characters
p72
aVfrom a cross section of the United States \u2014
p73
aVthat on the surface I had nothing in common with.
p74
aVAnd over time,
p75
aVall the political and personal bravado
p76
aVthat led me to the military dissolved,
p77
aVand for me, the Marine Corps became synonymous with my friends.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd then, a few years into my service
p80
aVand months away from deploying to Iraq,
p81
aVI dislocated my sternum in a mountain-biking accident,
p82
aVand had to be medically separated.
p83
aVThose never in the military may find this hard to understand,
p84
aVbut being told I wasn't getting deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan
p85
aVwas very devastating for me.
p86
aVI have a very clear image of leaving the base hospital on a stretcher
p87
aVand my entire platoon is waiting outside to see if I was OK.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd then, suddenly, I was a civilian again.
p90
aVI knew I wanted to give acting another shot,
p91
aVbecause \u2014 again, this is me \u2014
p92
aVI thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military.
p93
aVI mean, what can you really bitch about now, you know?
p94
aV"It's hot.
p95
aVSomeone should turn on the air conditioner."
p96
aV"This coffee line is too long."
p97
aVI was a Marine,
p98
aVI knew how to survive.
p99
aVI'd go to New York and become an actor.
p100
aVIf things didn't work out,
p101
aVI'd live in Central Park and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VI re-auditioned for Juilliard and this time I was lucky,
p106
aVI got in.
p107
aVBut I was surprised by how complex the transition was
p108
aVfrom military to civilian.
p109
aVAnd I was relatively healthy; I can't imagine going through that process
p110
aVon top of a mental or physical injury.
p111
aVBut regardless, it was difficult.
p112
aVIn part, because I was in acting school \u2014
p113
aVI couldn't justify going to voice and speech class,
p114
aVthrowing imaginary balls of energy at the back of the room,
p115
aVdoing acting exercises where I gave birth to myself \u2014
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
Vwhile my friends were serving without me overseas.
p120
aVBut also, because I didn't know how to apply the things
p121
aVI learned in the military to a civilian context.
p122
aVI mean that both practically and emotionally.
p123
aVPractically, I had to get a job.
p124
aVAnd I was an Infantry Marine,
p125
aVwhere you're shooting machine guns and firing mortars.
p126
aVThere's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VEmotionally, I struggled to find meaning.
p131
aVIn the military, everything has meaning.
p132
aVEverything you do is either steeped in tradition
p133
aVor has a practical purpose.
p134
aVYou can't smoke in the field
p135
aVbecause you don't want to give away your position.
p136
aVYou don't touch your face \u2014 you have to maintain
p137
aVa personal level of health and hygiene.
p138
aVYou face this way when "Colors" plays,
p139
aVout of respect for people who went before you.
p140
aVWalk this way, talk this way because of this.
p141
aVYour uniform is maintained to the inch.
p142
aVHow diligently you followed those rules spoke volumes
p143
aVabout the kind of Marine you were.
p144
aVYour rank said something about your history
p145
aVand the respect you had earned.
p146
aa(lp147
VIn the civilian world there's no rank.
p148
aVHere you're just another body,
p149
aVand I felt like I constantly had to prove my worth all over again.
p150
aVAnd the respect civilians were giving me while I was in uniform
p151
aVdidn't exist when I was out of it.
p152
aVThere didn't seem to be a ...
p153
aVa sense of community,
p154
aVwhereas in the military, I felt this sense of community.
p155
aVHow often in the civilian world
p156
aVare you put in a life-or-death situation with your closest friends
p157
aVand they constantly demonstrate that they're not going to abandon you?
p158
aVAnd meanwhile, at acting school ...
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VI was really, for the first time,
p163
aVdiscovering playwrights and characters and plays
p164
aVthat had nothing to do with the military,
p165
aVbut were somehow describing my military experience
p166
aVin a way that before to me was indescribable.
p167
aVAnd I felt myself becoming less aggressive
p168
aVas I was able to put words to feelings for the first time
p169
aVand realizing what a valuable tool that was.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd when I was reflecting on my time in the military,
p172
aVI wasn't first thinking on the stereotypical drills
p173
aVand discipline and pain of it;
p174
aVbut rather, the small, intimate human moments,
p175
aVmoments of great feeling:
p176
aVfriends going AWOL because they missed their families,
p177
aVfriends getting divorced,
p178
aVgrieving together, celebrating together,
p179
aVall within the backdrop of the military.
p180
aVI saw my friends battling these circumstances,
p181
aVand I watched the anxiety it produced in them and me,
p182
aVnot being able to express our feelings about it.
p183
aa(lp184
VThe military and theater communities are actually very similar.
p185
aVYou have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission
p186
aVgreater than themselves; it's not about you.
p187
aVYou have a role, you have to know your role within that team.
p188
aVEvery team has a leader or director;
p189
aVsometimes they're smart, sometimes they're not.
p190
aVYou're forced to be intimate with complete strangers
p191
aVin a short amount of time;
p192
aVthe self-discipline, the self-maintenance.
p193
aVI thought, how great would it be to create a space
p194
aVthat combined these two seemingly dissimilar communities,
p195
aVthat brought entertainment to a group of people
p196
aVthat, considering their occupation,
p197
aVcould handle something a bit more thought-provoking
p198
aVthan the typical mandatory-fun events
p199
aVthat I remember being "volun-told" to go to in the military \u2014
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
Vall well-intended but slightly offensive events,
p204
aVlike "Win a Date with a San Diego Chargers Cheerleader,"
p205
aVwhere you answer a question about pop culture,
p206
aVand if you get it right you win a date,
p207
aVwhich was a chaperoned walk around the parade deck
p208
aVwith this already married, pregnant cheerleader \u2014
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VNothing against cheerleaders, I love cheerleaders.
p213
aVThe point is more, how great would it be to have theater presented
p214
aVthrough characters that were accessible without being condescending.
p215
aVSo we started this nonprofit called Arts in the Armed Forces,
p216
aVwhere we tried to do that,
p217
aVtried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities.
p218
aVWe pick a play or select monologues from contemporary American plays
p219
aVthat are diverse in age and race like a military audience is,
p220
aVgrab a group of incredible theater-trained actors,
p221
aVarm them with incredible material,
p222
aVkeep production value as minimal as possible \u2014
p223
aVno sets, no costumes, no lights, just reading it \u2014
p224
aVto throw all the emphasis on the language
p225
aVand to show that theater can be created at any setting.
p226
aa(lp227
VIt's a powerful thing,
p228
aVgetting in a room with complete strangers
p229
aVand reminding ourselves of our humanity,
p230
aVand that self-expression is just as valuable a tool
p231
aVas a rifle on your shoulder.
p232
aVAnd for an organization like the military,
p233
aVthat prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms,
p234
aVyou can get lost in the sauce
p235
aVwhen it comes to explaining a collective experience.
p236
aVAnd I can think of no better community
p237
aVto arm with a new means of self-expression
p238
aVthan those protecting our country.
p239
aa(lp240
VWe've gone all over the United States and the world,
p241
aVfrom Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,
p242
aVto Camp Pendleton, to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,
p243
aVto USAG Bavaria,
p244
aVon- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.
p245
aVAnd for the performing artists we bring,
p246
aVit's a window into a culture
p247
aVthey otherwise would not have had exposure to.
p248
aVAnd for the military, it's the exact same.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd in doing this for the past six years,
p251
aVI'm always reminded that acting is many things.
p252
aVIt's a craft, it's a political act, it's a business, it's \u2014
p253
aVwhatever adjective is most applicable to you.
p254
aVBut it's also a service.
p255
aVI didn't get to finish mine,
p256
aVso whenever I get to be of service
p257
aVto this ultimate service industry, the military, for me, again \u2014
p258
aVthere's not many things better than that.
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
VWe're going to be doing a piece from Marco Ramirez,
p265
aVcalled "I am not Batman."
p266
aVAn incredible actor and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,
p267
aVis going to be reading,
p268
aVand Matt Johnson, who I just met a couple hours ago.
p269
aVThey're doing it together for the first time,
p270
aVso we'll see how it goes.
p271
aa(lp272
VJesse Perez and Matt Johnson.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Applause)
p275
aa(lp276
VJesse Perez: It's the middle of the night
p277
aVand the sky is glowing like mad, radioactive red.
p278
aVAnd if you squint, you can maybe see the moon
p279
aVthrough a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust
p280
aVthat covers the whole city,
p281
aVlike a mosquito net that won't let the angels in.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Drum beat)
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd if you look up high enough,
p286
aVyou can see me standing on the edge of an 87-story building.
p287
aVAnd up there, a place for gargoyles and broken clock towers
p288
aVthat have stayed still and dead for maybe like 100 years,
p289
aVup there is me.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Beat)
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd I'm frickin' Batman.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Beat)
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd I gots Batmobiles and batarangs
p298
aVand frickin' bat caves, like, for real.
p299
aVAnd all it takes is a broom closet
p300
aVor a back room or a fire escape,
p301
aVand Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.
p302
aVAnd my navy blue polo shirt,
p303
aVthe one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt
p304
aVfrom when it got snagged on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's
p305
aVbut it isn't even a big deal because I tuck that part in
p306
aVand it's, like, all good.
p307
aVThat blue polo shirt \u2014 it's gone, too!
p308
aVAnd I get like, like ... transformational.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Beat)
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd nobody pulls out a belt and whips Batman for talkin' back.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Beat)
p315
aa(lp316
VOr for not talkin' back.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd nobody calls Batman simple
p319
aVor stupid
p320
aVor skinny.
p321
aVAnd nobody fires Batman's brother from the Eastern Taxi Company
p322
aV'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.
p323
aV'Cause they got nothing but respect.
p324
aVAnd not like afraid-respect,
p325
aVjust, like, respect-respect.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Laughter)
p328
aa(lp329
V'Cause nobody's afraid of you.
p330
aV'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Beat)
p333
aa(lp334
VEver. (Double beat)
p335
aa(lp336
V'Cause all Batman really wants to do is save people
p337
aVand maybe pay abuela's bills one day
p338
aVand die happy.
p339
aVAnd maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VOh \u2014 and kill the Joker.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Drum roll)
p346
aa(lp347
VTonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.
p348
aVAnd I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'
p349
aVlike a eagle
p350
aVor like a \u2014
p351
aVno, yeah, like a eagle.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd my cape is flapping in the wind cause it's frickin' long
p356
aVand my pointy ears are on,
p357
aVand that mask that covers like half my face is on, too,
p358
aVand I got, like, bulletproof stuff all in my chest so no one can hurt me.
p359
aVAnd nobody \u2014 nobody! \u2014
p360
aVis gonna come between Batman ...
p361
aVand justice.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Drums) (Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
VFrom where I am,
p366
aVI can hear everything.
p367
aa(lp368
V(Silence)
p369
aa(lp370
VSomewhere in the city,
p371
aVthere's a old lady picking Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can
p372
aVand she's putting a piece of sesame chicken someone spit out
p373
aVinto her own mouth.
p374
aVAnd somewhere there's a doctor with a wack haircut in a black lab coat
p375
aVtrying to find a cure for the diseases
p376
aVthat are gonna make us all extinct for real one day.
p377
aVAnd somewhere there's a man,
p378
aVa man in a janitor's uniform,
p379
aVstumbling home drunk and dizzy
p380
aVafter spending half his paycheck on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer,
p381
aVand the other half on a four-hour visit to some lady's house
p382
aVon a street where the lights have all been shot out
p383
aVby people who'd rather do what they do in this city in the dark.
p384
aVAnd half a block away from janitor man,
p385
aVthere's a group of good-for-nothings who don't know no better,
p386
aVwaiting for janitor man with rusted bicycle chains
p387
aVand imitation Louisville Sluggers,
p388
aVand if they don't find a cent on him,
p389
aVwhich they won't,
p390
aVthey'll just pound at him till the muscles in their arms start burning,
p391
aVtill there's no more teeth to crack out.
p392
aa(lp393
VBut they don't count on me.
p394
aVThey don't count on no Dark Knight,
p395
aVwith a stomach full of grocery-store brand macaroni and cheese
p396
aVand cut-up Vienna sausages.
p397
aa(lp398
V(Laughter)
p399
aa(lp400
V'Cause they'd rather believe I don't exist.
p401
aa(lp402
VAnd from 87 stories up, I can hear one of the good-for-nothings say,
p403
aV"Gimme the cash!" \u2014 real fast like that,
p404
aVjust, "Gimme me the fuckin' cash!"
p405
aVAnd I see janitor man mumble something in drunk language and turn pale,
p406
aVand from 87 stories up,
p407
aVI can hear his stomach trying to hurl its way out his Dickies.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo I swoop down, like, mad-fast
p410
aVand I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!"
p411
aVAnd I throw a batarang at the one naked lightbulb.
p412
aa(lp413
V(Cymbal)
p414
aa(lp415
VAnd they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker!
p416
aVWho just turned out the lights?"
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
V"What's that over there?" "What?"
p421
aa(lp422
V"Gimme me what you got, old man!"
p423
aa(lp424
V"Did anybody hear that?"
p425
aV"Hear what? There ain't nothing. No, really \u2014 there ain't no bat!"
p426
aa(lp427
VBut then ...
p428
aVone out of the three good-for-nothings gets it to the head \u2014 pow!
p429
aa(lp430
VAnd number two swings blindly into the dark cape before him,
p431
aVbut before his fist hits anything,
p432
aVI grab a trash can lid and \u2014
p433
aVright in the gut!
p434
aVAnd number one comes back with the jump kick,
p435
aVbut I know judo karate, too, so I'm like \u2014
p436
aa(lp437
V(Drums)
p438
aa(lp439
VTwice!
p440
aa(lp441
V(Drums)
p442
aa(lp443
V(Laughter)
p444
aa(lp445
V(Drums)
p446
aa(lp447
VBut before I can do any more damage,
p448
aVsuddenly we all hear a "click-click."
p449
aVAnd suddenly everything gets quiet.
p450
aVAnd the one good-for-nothing left standing
p451
aVgrips a handgun and aims it straight up,
p452
aVlike he's holding Jesus hostage,
p453
aVlike he's threatening maybe to blow a hole in the moon.
p454
aVAnd the good-for-nothing who got it to the head,
p455
aVwho tried to jump-kick me,
p456
aVand the other good-for-nothing who got it in the gut,
p457
aVis both scrambling back away from the dark figure before 'em.
p458
aVAnd the drunk man, the janitor man,
p459
aVis huddled in a corner, praying to Saint Anthony
p460
aV'cause that's the only one he could remember.
p461
aa(lp462
V(Double beat)
p463
aVAnd there's me:
p464
aVeyes glowing white,
p465
aVcape blowing softly in the wind.
p466
aa(lp467
V(Beat)
p468
aVBulletproof chest heaving,
p469
aVmy heart beating right through it in a Morse code for:
p470
aV"Fuck with me
p471
aVjust once
p472
aVcome on
p473
aVjust try."
p474
aa(lp475
VAnd the one good-for-nothing left standing,
p476
aVthe one with the handgun \u2014
p477
aVyeah, he laughs.
p478
aVAnd he lowers his arm.
p479
aVAnd he points it at me
p480
aVand gives the moon a break.
p481
aVAnd he aims it right between my pointy ears,
p482
aVlike goal posts and he's special teams.
p483
aVAnd janitor man is still calling Saint Anthony,
p484

aa(lp501
VAnd he's on the floor
p502
aVand I'm standing over him
p503
aVand I got the gun in my hands now
p504
aVand I hate guns, I hate holding 'em 'cause I'm Batman.
p505
aVAnd, asterisk:
p506
aVBatman don't like guns 'cause his parents got iced by guns a long time ago.
p507
aVBut for just a second,
p508
aVmy eyes glow white,
p509
aVand I hold this thing
p510
aVfor I could speak to the good-for-nothing
p511
aVin a language he maybe understands.
p512
aVClick-click!
p513
aa(lp514

p515
aa(lp516
VAnd the good-for-nothings become good-for-disappearing
p517
aVinto whatever toxic waste, chemical sludge shithole they crawled out of.
p518
aVAnd it's just me and janitor man.
p519
aVAnd I pick him up,
p520
aVand I wipe sweat and cheap perfume off his forehead.
p521
aVAnd he begs me not to hurt him
p522
aVand I grab him tight by his janitor-man shirt collar,
p523
aVand I pull him to my face
p524
aVand he's taller than me but the cape helps,
p525
aVso he listens when I look him straight in the eyes.
p526
aVAnd I say two words to him:
p527
aV"Go home."
p528
aa(lp529
VAnd he does,
p530
aVchecking behind his shoulder every 10 feet.
p531
aVAnd I swoosh from building to building on his way there
p532
aV'cause I know where he lives.
p533
aVAnd I watch his hands tremble as he pulls out his key chain
p534
aVand opens the door to his building.
p535
aVAnd I'm back in bed
p536
aVbefore he even walks in through the front door.
p537
aa(lp538
VAnd I hear him turn on the faucet
p539
aVand pour himself a glass of warm tap water.
p540
aVAnd he puts the glass back in the sink.
p541
aVAnd I hear his footsteps.
p542
aVAnd they get slower as they get to my room.
p543
aVAnd he creaks my door open, like, mad-slow.
p544
aVAnd he takes a step in,
p545
aVwhich he never does.
p546
aa(lp547
V(Beat)
p548
aVAnd he's staring off into nowhere,
p549
aVhis face, the color of sidewalks in summer.
p550
aVAnd I act like I'm just waking up
p551
aVand I say, "Ah, what's up, Pop?"
p552
aVAnd janitor man says nothing to me.
p553
aVBut I see in the dark,
p554
aVI see his arms go limp
p555
aVand his head turns back, like, towards me.
p556
aVAnd he lifts it for I can see his face,
p557
aVfor I could see his eyes.
p558
aVAnd his cheeks is drippin', but not with sweat.
p559
aVAnd he just stands there breathing,
p560
aVlike he remembers my eyes glowing white,
p561
aVlike he remembers my bulletproof chest,
p562
aVlike he remembers he's my pop.
p563
aVAnd for a long time I don't say nothin'.
p564
aVAnd he turns around, hand on the doorknob.
p565
aVAnd he ain't looking my way,
p566
aVbut I hear him mumble two words to me:
p567
aV"I'm sorry."
p568
aa(lp569
VAnd I lean over, and I open my window just a crack.
p570
aVIf you look up high enough,
p571
aVyou could see me.
p572
aVAnd from where I am \u2014

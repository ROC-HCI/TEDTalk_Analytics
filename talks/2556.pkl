VSo when I decided to create an art piece in Manshiyat Naser,
p5
aVthe neighborhood of the Cairo garbage collectors in Egypt,
p6
aVI never thought this project would be
p7
aVthe most amazing human experience that I would ever live.
p8
aVAs an artist, I had this humanist intention
p9
aVof beautifying a poor and neglected neighborhood
p10
aVby bringing art to it and hopefully shining light on this isolated community.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe first time I heard about this Christian Coptic community
p13
aVwas in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities under the regime of Hosni Mubarak
p14
aVdecided to slaughter 300,000 pigs using the pretext of H1N1 virus.
p15
aVOriginally, they are pig breeders.
p16
aVTheir pigs and other animals are fed with the organic waste
p17
aVthat they collect on a daily basis.
p18
aVThis event killed their livelihood.
p19
aVThe first time I entered Manshiyat Naser, it felt like a maze.
p20
aVI was looking for the St. Simon Monastery on the top of the Muqattam Mountain.
p21
aVSo you go right, then straight, then right again, then left
p22
aVto reach all the way to the top.
p23
aVBut to reach there, you must dodge between the trucks overpacked with garbage
p24
aVand slalom between the tuk-tuks,
p25
aVthe fastest vehicle to move around in the neighborhood.
p26
aVThe smell of the garbage unloaded from those trucks was intense,
p27
aVand the noise of the traffic was loud and overbearing.
p28
aVAdd to it the din created by the crushers in those warehouses along the way.
p29
aVFrom outside it looks chaotic, but everything is perfectly organized.
p30
aa(lp31
VThe Zaraeeb, that\u2019s how they call themselves,
p32
aVwhich means the pig breeders,
p33
aVhave been collecting the garbage of Cairo
p34
aVand sorting it in their own neighborhood for decades.
p35
aVThey have developed one of the most efficient
p36
aVand highly profitable systems on a global level.
p37
aVStill, the place is perceived as dirty, marginalized and segregated
p38
aVbecause of their association with the trash.
p39
aVSo my initial idea was to create an anamorphic piece,
p40
aVa piece that you can only see from one vantage point.
p41
aVI wanted to challenge myself artistically by painting over several buildings
p42
aVand having it only fully visible from one point on the Muqattam Mountain.
p43
aVThe Muqattam Mountain is the pride of the community.
p44
aVThis is where they built the St. Simon Monastery,
p45
aVa 10,000-seat cave church that they carved into the mountain itself.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo, the first time I stood on top of the mountain
p48
aVand I looked at the neighborhood,
p49
aVI asked myself, how on earth will I convince all those owners
p50
aVto let me paint on their buildings?
p51
aVAnd then Magd came.
p52
aVMagd is a guide from the Church.
p53
aVHe told me the only person I needed to convince was Father Samaan,
p54
aVwho is the leader of the community.
p55
aVBut to convince Father Samaan, I needed to convince Mario,
p56
aVwho is a Polish artist who moved to Cairo 20 years ago
p57
aVand who created all the artwork of the Cave Church.
p58
aVI am really grateful to Mario. He was the key of the project.
p59
aVHe managed to get me a meeting with Father Samaan,
p60
aVand surprisingly, he loved the idea.
p61
aVHe asked me about where I painted before
p62
aVand how I will make it happen.
p63
aVAnd he was mainly concerned by what I was going to write.
p64
aa(lp65
VIn every work that I create, I write messages
p66
aVwith my style of Arabic calligraphy.
p67
aVI make sure those messages are relevant to the place where I am painting
p68
aVbut have this universal dimension,
p69
aVso anybody around the world can relate to it.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo for Manshiyat Naser,
p72
aVI decided to write in Arabic the words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria,
p73
aVa Coptic bishop from the third century,
p74
aVwho said: (Arabic),
p75
aVwhich means in English,
p76
aV"Anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly
p77
aVneeds to wipe his eyes first."
p78
aa(lp79
VIt was really important for me
p80
aVthat the community felt connected to the words.
p81
aVAnd for me this quote was perfectly reflecting the spirit of the project.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo Father Samaan blessed the project,
p84
aVand his approval brought all the residents on board.
p85
aVHundreds of liters of paint, a dozen blue manual lifts,
p86
aVseveral trips back and forth to Cairo,
p87
aVa strong and solid team from France, North Africa, Middle East and the US,
p88
aVand after a year of planning and logistics, there we are,
p89
aVmy team and some members from the local community
p90
aVcreating a piece that will spread over 50 buildings,
p91
aVsome filling up the space of the calligraphy
p92
aVthat I trace with colors.
p93
aVHere some blue, there some yellow, there some orange.
p94
aVSome others carrying some sand bags
p95
aVand putting them on the top of the buildings
p96
aVto hold those manual lifts,
p97
aVand some others assembling and disassembling those same lifts
p98
aVand moving them around the different buildings.
p99
aa(lp100
VAt the beginning of the project,
p101
aVI numbered all those buildings on my sketch,
p102
aVand there was no real interaction with the community.
p103
aVPeople didn\u2019t get the point of all this.
p104
aVBut fast enough, those building numbers became family names.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe first building was the house of Uncle Ibrahim.
p107
aVUncle Ibrahim is such an enthusiastic person.
p108
aVHe was always singing and making jokes,
p109
aVand his daughters and sons saved me from his bull
p110
aVwho wanted to attack me on the fourth floor.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VActually, the bull saw me from the window and came out on the balcony.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VYeah.
p119
aa(lp120
VUncle Ibrahim was always hanging out on the balcony
p121
aVand talking to me while I was painting.
p122
aVI remember him saying that he didn\u2019t go to the mountain for 10 years,
p123
aVand that he never takes a day off.
p124
aVHe said that if he stopped working, who will stop the garbage?
p125
aVBut surprisingly, at the end of the project,
p126
aVhe came all the way to the mountain to look at the piece.
p127
aVHe was really proud to see his house painted,
p128
aVand he said that this project was a project of peace and \u2014
p129
aVsorry \u2014
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VThank you.
p134
aa(lp135
VHe said that it was a project of peace and unity
p136
aVand that it brought people together.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo his perception towards the project changed,
p139
aVand my perception towards the community changed also,
p140
aVand towards what they do.
p141
aVAll the garbage that everybody is disgusted by is not theirs.
p142
aVThey just work out of it.
p143
aVActually, they don\u2019t live in the garbage. They live from the garbage.
p144
aVSo I started doubting myself and wondering
p145
aVwhat was the real purpose of this whole project?
p146
aVIt was not about beautifying a place by bringing art to it.
p147
aVIt was about switching perception and opening a dialogue
p148
aVon the connection that we have with communities that we don\u2019t know.
p149
aVSo day after day,
p150
aVthe calligraphy circle was taking shape,
p151
aVand we were always excited to go back on the mountain to look at the piece.
p152
aVAnd standing exactly at this point every day made my realize
p153
aVthe symbolism behind this anamorphic piece.
p154
aVIf you want to see the real image of somebody,
p155
aVmaybe you should change your angle.
p156
aa(lp157
VThere was doubts and difficulties,
p158
aVlike fears and stress.
p159
aVIt wasn't simple to work in such environments,
p160
aVsometimes having pigs under you while you paint
p161
aVor climbing a stack of garbage to reach a lift.
p162
aVBut we all got over the fear of the heights, the swinging lifts,
p163
aVthe strength of the smell
p164
aVand also the stress of not finishing on time.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut the kindness of all those people made us forget everything.
p167
aVThe building number 3 was the house of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda.
p168
aVIn Egyptian, they have this expression that says, "Ahsen Nas,"
p169
aVwhich means "the best people."
p170
aVThey were the best people.
p171
aVWe used to take our break in front of their houses,
p172
aVand all the kids of the neighborhood
p173
aVused to join us.
p174
aVI was impressed and amazed by the kids of Manshiyat Naser.
p175
aVFor the first few days, they were always refusing anything we were offering them,
p176
aVeven a snack or a drink.
p177
aVSo I asked Aunty Fareeda, "Why is that?"
p178
aVAnd she told me they teach their kids to refuse anything
p179
aVfrom somebody that they don't know
p180
aVbecause maybe this person needs it more than they do.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo at this exact point I realized actually
p183
aVthe Zaraeeb community was the ideal context
p184
aVto raise the topic of perception.
p185
aVWe need to question our level of misconception
p186
aVand judgment we can have as a society
p187
aVupon communities based on their differences.
p188
aVI remember how we got delayed on Uncle Ibrahim's house
p189
aVwhen his pigs that are bred on the rooftop
p190
aVwere eating the sand bags that hold the lifts.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VThe house of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda
p195
aVwas this kind of meeting point.
p196
aVEverybody used to gather there.
p197
aVI think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant
p198
aVwhen he said that was a project of peace and unity,
p199
aVbecause I really felt that people were coming together.
p200
aVEveryone was greeting us with a smile, offering us a drink
p201
aVor inviting us into their own house for lunch.
p202
aVSometime, you are at the first level of a building,
p203
aVand somebody opens his window and offers you some tea.
p204
aVAnd then the same thing happens on the second floor.
p205
aVAnd you keep going all the way to the top.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VI think I never drink as much tea as I did in Egypt.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd to be honest with you, we could have finished earlier,
p216
aVbut I think it took us three weeks because of all those tea breaks.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VIn Egypt, they have another expression, which is "Nawartouna,"
p221
aVwhich means, "You brought light to us."
p222
aVIn Manshiyat Naser they were always telling us this.
p223
aVThe calligraphy, actually \u2014
p224
aVI used a white glow-in-the-dark paint for the calligraphy
p225
aVso at the end of the project, we rented some black light projectors
p226
aVand lit up the whole neighborhood,
p227
aVsurprising everybody around.
p228
aVWe wanted to tell them
p229
aVthat they are the ones who brought light to us.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VThe Zaraeeb community are strong, honest, hard workers,
p234
aVand they know their value.
p235
aVThe people of Cairo call them "the Zabaleen,"
p236
aVwhich means "the people of the garbage,"
p237
aVbut ironically, the people of Manshiyat Naser
p238
aVcall the people of Cairo the Zabaleen.
p239
aVThey say, they are the ones who produce the garbage, not them.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)
p244
aa(lp245
VThe goal was to leave something to this community,
p246
aVbut I feel that they are the ones who left something in our lives.
p247
aVYou know, the art project was just a pretext
p248
aVfor this amazing human experience.
p249
aVThe art piece at some point will disappear, vanish,
p250
aVand actually there is somebody who is building a second floor
p251
aVin front of Uncle Ibrahim's house,
p252
aVso it's covering part of the painting,
p253
aVso I might need to go back and paint over it.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VIt was about the experience,
p258
aVabout the story,
p259
aVabout the moment.
p260
aa(lp261
VFrom the streets of the neighborhood,
p262
aVthe painting appears in fragments,
p263
aVisolated from one another,
p264
aVstanding alone.
p265
aVBut connected with the sign of calligraphy
p266
aVthat today reveals the powerful message that we should all think about
p267
aVbefore we want to judge somebody.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly
p270
aVneeds to wipe his eyes first.
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Applause)

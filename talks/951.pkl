VMy story is a little bit about war.
p5
aVIt's about disillusionment.
p6
aVIt's about death.
p7
aVAnd it's about rediscovering
p8
aVidealism
p9
aVin all of that wreckage.
p10
aVAnd perhaps also, there's a lesson
p11
aVabout how to deal with
p12
aVour screwed-up, fragmenting
p13
aVand dangerous world of the 21st century.
p14
aVI don't believe in straightforward narratives.
p15
aVI don't believe in a life or history
p16
aVwritten as decision "A" led to consequence "B"
p17
aVled to consequence "C" \u2014
p18
aVthese neat narratives that we're presented with,
p19
aVand that perhaps we encourage in each other.
p20
aVI believe in randomness,
p21
aVand one of the reasons I believe that
p22
aVis because me becoming a diplomat was random.
p23
aVI'm colorblind.
p24
aVI was born unable to see most colors.
p25
aVThis is why I wear gray and black most of the time,
p26
aVand I have to take my wife with me
p27
aVto chose clothes.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.
p30
aVI loved watching planes barrel over
p31
aVour holiday home in the countryside.
p32
aVAnd it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.
p33
aVAnd I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot,
p34
aVand sure enough, I failed.
p35
aVI couldn't see all the blinking different lights,
p36
aVand I can't distinguish color.
p37
aVSo I had to choose another career,
p38
aVand this was in fact relatively easy for me,
p39
aVbecause I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood,
p40
aVwhich was international relations.
p41
aVAs a child,
p42
aVI read the newspaper thoroughly.
p43
aVI was fascinated by the Cold War,
p44
aVby the INF negotiations
p45
aVover intermediate-range nuclear missiles,
p46
aVthe proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
p47
aVin Angola or Afghanistan.
p48
aVThese things really interested me.
p49
aVAnd so I decided quite at an early age
p50
aVI wanted to be a diplomat.
p51
aVAnd I, one day, I announced this to my parents \u2014
p52
aVand my father denies this story to this day \u2014
p53
aVI said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."
p54
aVAnd he turned to me, and he said,
p55
aV"Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVAnd my ambition was sealed.
p58
aa(lp59
VIn 1989,
p60
aVI entered the British Foreign Service.
p61
aVThat year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat,
p62
aVand 20 of us succeeded.
p63
aVAnd as those numbers suggest,
p64
aVI was inducted into an elite
p65
aVand fascinating and exhilarating world.
p66
aVBeing a diplomat, then and now,
p67
aVis an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it \u2014
p68
aVI enjoyed the status of it.
p69
aVI bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes
p70
aVand reveled in
p71
aVthis amazing access I had to world events.
p72
aVI traveled to the Gaza Strip.
p73
aVI headed the Middle East Peace Process section
p74
aVin the British Foreign Ministry.
p75
aVI became a speechwriter
p76
aVfor the British Foreign Secretary.
p77
aVI met Yasser Arafat.
p78
aVI negotiated
p79
aVwith Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.
p80
aVLater, I traveled to Kabul
p81
aVand served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
p82
aVAnd I would travel
p83
aVin a C-130 transport
p84
aVand go and visit warlords
p85
aVin mountain hideaways
p86
aVand negotiate with them
p87
aVabout how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan,
p88
aVsurrounded by my Special Forces escort,
p89
aVwho, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines,
p90
aVbecause it was so dangerous.
p91
aVAnd that was exciting \u2014 that was fun.
p92
aVIt was really interesting.
p93
aVAnd it's a great cadre of people,
p94
aVincredibly close-knit community of people.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out,
p97
aVwas when I was posted to New York.
p98
aVI'd already served in Germany, Norway,
p99
aVvarious other places,
p100
aVbut I was posted to New York
p101
aVto serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.
p102
aVAnd my responsibility was the Middle East,
p103
aVwhich was my specialty.
p104
aVAnd there, I dealt with things
p105
aVlike the Middle East peace process,
p106
aVthe Lockerbie issue \u2014
p107
aVwe can talk about that later, if you wish \u2014
p108
aVbut above all, my responsibility was Iraq
p109
aVand its weapons of mass destruction
p110
aVand the sanctions we placed on Iraq
p111
aVto oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.
p112
aVI was the chief British negotiator
p113
aVon the subject,
p114
aVand I was steeped in the issue.
p115
aVAnd anyway,
p116
aVmy tour \u2014 it was kind of a very exciting time.
p117
aVI mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.
p118
aVWe went through several wars
p119
aVduring my time in New York.
p120
aVI negotiated for my country
p121
aVthe resolution in the Security Council
p122
aVof the 12th of September 2001
p123
aVcondemning the attacks of the day before,
p124
aVwhich were, of course, deeply present to us
p125
aVactually living in New York at the time.
p126
aVSo it was kind of the best of time, worst of times
p127
aVkind of experience.
p128
aVI lived the high-life.
p129
aVAlthough I worked very long hours,
p130
aVI lived in a penthouse in Union Square.
p131
aVI was a single British diplomat in New York City;
p132
aVyou can imagine what that might have meant.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVI had a good time.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut in 2002,
p137
aVwhen my tour came to an end,
p138
aVI decided I wasn't going to go back
p139
aVto the job that was waiting for me in London.
p140
aVI decided to take a sabbatical,
p141
aVin fact, at the New School, Bruce.
p142
aVIn some inchoate, inarticulate way
p143
aVI realized that there was something wrong
p144
aVwith my work, with me.
p145
aVI was exhausted,
p146
aVand I was also disillusioned
p147
aVin a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.
p148
aVAnd I decided to take some time out from work.
p149
aVThe Foreign Office was very generous.
p150
aVYou could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them,
p151
aVand yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.
p152
aVIt was nice.
p153
aVAnd eventually, I decided
p154
aVto take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo,
p155
aVwhich was then under U.N. administration.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd two things happened in Kosovo,
p158
aVwhich kind of, again,
p159
aVshows the randomness of life,
p160
aVbecause these things turned out to be
p161
aVtwo of the pivots of my life
p162
aVand helped to deliver me to the next stage.
p163
aVBut they were random things.
p164
aVOne was that, in the summer of 2004,
p165
aVthe British government, somewhat reluctantly,
p166
aVdecided to have an official inquiry
p167
aVinto the use of intelligence on WMD
p168
aVin the run up to the Iraq War,
p169
aVa very limited subject.
p170
aVAnd I testified to that inquiry in secret.
p171
aVI had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq
p172
aVand its WMD,
p173
aVand my testimony to the inquiry said three things:
p174
aVthat the government exaggerated the intelligence,
p175
aVwhich was very clear in all the years I'd read it.
p176
aVAnd indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear
p177
aVthat Iraq's WMD
p178
aVdid not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.
p179
aVSecondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war,
p180
aVwhich in some ways
p181
aVwas a more discreditable thing still.
p182
aVThe third reason, I won't go into.
p183
aVBut anyway, I gave that testimony,
p184
aVand that presented me with a crisis.
p185
aVWhat was I going to do?
p186
aVThis testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues,
p187
aVof my ministers, who had, in my view
p188
aVhad perpetrated a war on a falsehood.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd so I was in crisis.
p191
aVAnd this wasn't a pretty thing.
p192
aVI moaned about it, I hesitated,
p193
aVI went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife,
p194
aVand eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.
p195
aVI felt \u2014 there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know,
p196
aVwhere he goes back to CBS
p197
aVafter they've let him down over the tobacco guy,
p198
aVand he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken."
p199
aVAnd it was like that for me. I love that movie.
p200
aVI felt just something's broken.
p201
aVI can't actually sit with my foreign minister
p202
aVor my prime minister again with a smile on my face
p203
aVand do what I used to do gladly for them.
p204
aVSo took a running leap
p205
aVand jumped over the edge of a cliff.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling.
p208
aVAnd I started to fall.
p209
aVAnd today, that fall hasn't stopped;
p210
aVI'm still falling.
p211
aVBut, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.
p212
aVAnd in a way, I kind of like
p213
aVthe sensation of it a lot better
p214
aVthan I like actually standing on top of the cliff,
p215
aVwondering what to do.
p216
aVA second thing happened in Kosovo,
p217
aVwhich kind of \u2014 I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.
p218
aVA second thing happened in Kosovo,
p219
aVwhich kind of delivered the answer,
p220
aVwhich I couldn't really answer,
p221
aVwhich is, "What do I do with my life?"
p222
aVI love diplomacy \u2014
p223
aVI have no career \u2014
p224
aVI expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.
p225
aVI wanted to be an ambassador,
p226
aVand my mentors, my heroes,
p227
aVpeople who got to the top of my profession,
p228
aVand here I was throwing it all away.
p229
aVA lot of my friends were still in it.
p230
aVMy pension was in it.
p231
aVAnd I gave it up.
p232
aVAnd what was I going to do?
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd that year, in Kosovo,
p235
aVthis terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.
p236
aVIn March 2004, there were terrible riots
p237
aVall over the province \u2014 as it then was \u2014 of Kosovo.
p238
aV18 people were killed.
p239
aVIt was anarchy.
p240
aVAnd it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy,
p241
aVto know that the police and the military \u2014
p242
aVthere were lots of military troops there \u2014
p243
aVactually can't stop that rampaging mob
p244
aVwho's coming down the street.
p245
aVAnd the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop
p246
aVis when they decide to stop
p247
aVand when they've had enough burning and killing.
p248
aVAnd that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.
p249
aVAnd I went through it. I went through those mobs.
p250
aVAnd with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.
p251
aVAnd that riot taught me something,
p252
aVwhich isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut one of the reasons that riot took place \u2014
p255
aVthose riots, which went on for several days, took place \u2014
p256
aVwas because the Kosovo people
p257
aVwere disenfranchised from their own future.
p258
aVThere were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo
p259
aVgoing on then,
p260
aVand the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people,
p261
aVwere not actually
p262
aVparticipating in those talks.
p263
aVThere was this whole fancy diplomatic system,
p264
aVthis negotiation process about the future of Kosovo,
p265
aVand the Kosovars weren't part of it.
p266
aVAnd funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.
p267
aVThose riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.
p268
aVIt wasn't the only reason,
p269
aVand life is not simple, one reason narratives.
p270
aVIt was a complicated thing,
p271
aVand I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.
p272
aVBut that was one of the reasons.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd that kind of gave me the inspiration \u2014
p275
aVor rather to be precise,
p276
aVit gave my wife the inspiration.
p277
aVShe said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?
p278
aVWhy don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?"
p279
aVAnd the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.
p280
aVThey were not allowed diplomats.
p281
aVThey were not allowed a foreign office
p282
aVto help them deal with this immensely complicated process,
p283
aVwhich became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.
p284
aVAnd so that was the idea.
p285
aVThat was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat,
p286
aVthe world's first diplomatic advisory group
p287
aVand a non-profit to boot.
p288
aVAnd it began when I flew back from London
p289
aVafter my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.
p290
aVI flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him,
p291
aV"Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.
p292
aVI know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?"
p293
aVAnd he raised his glass of raki to me and said,
p294
aV"Yes, Carne. Come."
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd I came to Kosovo
p297
aVand advised the Kosovo government.
p298
aVIndependent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers
p299
aVand the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo.
p300
aVAnd Kosovo became independent.
p301
aVIndependent Diplomat is now established
p302
aVin five diplomatic centers around the world,
p303
aVand we're advising seven or eight
p304
aVdifferent countries, or political groups,
p305
aVdepending on how you wish to define them \u2014
p306
aVand I'm not big on definitions.
p307
aVWe're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.
p308
aVWe're advising the Burmese opposition,
p309
aVthe government of Southern Sudan,
p310
aVwhich \u2014 you heard it here first \u2014
p311
aVis going to be a new country within the next few years.
p312
aVWe're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara,
p313
aVwho are fighting to get their country back
p314
aVfrom Moroccan occupation
p315
aVafter 34 years of dispossession.
p316
aVWe're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations,
p317
aVwhich is suppose to culminate
p318
aVin Copenhagen.
p319
aa(lp320
VThere's a bit of randomness here too
p321
aVbecause, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat,
p322
aVI went to a party in the House of Lords,
p323
aVwhich is a ridiculous place,
p324
aVbut I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into
p325
aVthis guy who was standing behind me.
p326
aVAnd we started talking, and he said \u2014
p327
aVI told him what I was doing,
p328
aVand I told him rather grandly
p329
aVI was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.
p330
aVAt that time there was just me \u2014
p331
aVand me and my wife were moving back to New York.
p332
aVAnd he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?"
p333
aVAnd it turned out
p334
aVhe worked for an innovation company called ?What If!,
p335
aVwhich some of you have probably heard of.
p336
aVAnd one thing led to another,
p337
aVand I ended up having a desk
p338
aVin ?What If! in New York,
p339
aVwhen I started Independent Diplomat.
p340
aVAnd watching ?What If!
p341
aVdevelop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley
p342
aVor new flavors for Coke
p343
aVactually helped me innovate
p344
aVnew strategies for the Kosovars
p345
aVand for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.
p346
aVAnd I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy \u2014
p347
aVthat diplomacy, like business,
p348
aVis a business of solving problems,
p349
aVand yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy;
p350
aVit's all zero sum games and realpolitik
p351
aVand ancient institutions that have been there for generations
p352
aVand do things the same way they've always done things.
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd Independent Diplomat, today,
p355
aVtries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!.
p356
aVWe all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.
p357
aVWe all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.
p358
aVAnd we use naive experts
p359
aVwho may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with,
p360
aVbut may know something about something else
p361
aVto try to inject new thinking
p362
aVinto the problems
p363
aVthat we try to address for our clients.
p364
aVIt's not easy, because our clients, by definition,
p365
aVare having a difficult time, diplomatically.
p366
aa(lp367
VThere are, I don't know,
p368
aVsome lessons from all of this,
p369
aVpersonal and political \u2014
p370
aVand in a way, they're the same thing.
p371
aVThe personal one
p372
aVis falling off a cliff
p373
aVis actually a good thing, and I recommend it.
p374
aVAnd it's a good thing to do at least once in your life
p375
aVjust to tear everything up and jump.
p376
aVThe second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.
p377
aVIndependent Diplomat is part of a trend
p378
aVwhich is emerging and evident across the world,
p379
aVwhich is that the world is fragmenting.
p380
aVStates mean less than they used to,
p381
aVand the power of the state is declining.
p382
aVThat means the power of others things is rising.
p383
aVThose other things are called non-state actors.
p384
aVThey may be corporations,
p385
aVthey may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs,
p386
aVthey may anything,
p387
aVany number of things.
p388
aVWe are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.
p389
aVIf governments are less able
p390
aVto affect the problems
p391
aVthat affect us in the world,
p392
aVthen that means, who is left to deal with them,
p393
aVwho has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?
p394
aVUs.
p395
aVIf they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?
p396
aVWe have no choice but to embrace that reality.
p397
aa(lp398
VWhat this means is
p399
aVit's no longer good enough
p400
aVto say that international relations, or global affairs,
p401
aVor chaos in Somalia,
p402
aVor what's going on in Burma is none of your business,
p403
aVand that you can leave it to governments to get on with.
p404
aVI can connect any one of you
p405
aVby six degrees of separation
p406
aVto the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.
p407
aVAsk me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough,
p408
aVbut that connection is there.
p409
aVWe are all intimately connected.
p410
aVAnd this isn't just Tom Friedman,
p411
aVit's actually provable in case after case after case.
p412
aVWhat that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things,
p413
aVyou have to look to yourself to do things.
p414
aVAnd Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this
p415
aVin a sort of loose way.
p416
aa(lp417
VThere aren't neat examples, but one example is this:
p418
aVthe way the world is changing
p419
aVis embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work \u2014
p420
aVthe U.N. Security Council.
p421
aVThe U.N. was established in 1945.
p422
aVIts charter is basically designed
p423
aVto stop conflicts between states \u2014
p424
aVinterstate conflict.
p425
aVToday, 80 percent of the agenda
p426
aVof the U.N. Security Council
p427
aVis about conflicts within states,
p428
aVinvolving non-state parties \u2014
p429
aVguerillas, separatists,
p430
aVterrorists, if you want to call them that,
p431
aVpeople who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.
p432
aVThat is the state of the world today.
p433
aVWhen I realized this,
p434
aVand when I look back on my time at the Security Council
p435
aVand what happened with the Kosovars,
p436
aVand I realize that often
p437
aVthe people who were most directly affected
p438
aVby what we were doing in the Security Council
p439
aVweren't actually there, weren't actually invited
p440
aVto give their views to the Security Council,
p441
aVI thought, this is wrong.
p442
aVSomething's got to be done about this.
p443
aa(lp444
VSo I started off in a traditional mode.
p445
aVMe and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat
p446
aVwent around the U.N. Security Council.
p447
aVWe went around 70 U.N. member states \u2014
p448
aVthe Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis \u2014
p449
aVyou name them, we went to see them \u2014
p450
aVthe secretary general, all of them,
p451
aVand said, "This is all wrong.
p452
aVThis is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.
p453
aVYou've got to institutionalize a system
p454
aVwhere you actually invite the Kosovars
p455
aVto come and tell you what they think.
p456
aVThis will allow you to tell me \u2014 you can tell them what you think.
p457
aVIt'll be great. You can have an exchange.
p458
aVYou can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions,
p459
aVwhich means your decisions will be more effective and durable."
p460
aVSuper-logical, you would think.
p461
aVI mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.
p462
aVAnd of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.
p463
aVCome back to us
p464
aVin maybe six months."
p465
aVAnd of course, nothing happened \u2014 nobody did anything.
p466
aVThe Security Council does its business
p467
aVin exactly the same way today
p468
aVthat it did X number of years ago,
p469
aVwhen I was there 10 years ago.
p470
aa(lp471
VSo we looked at that observation
p472
aVof basically failure
p473
aVand thought, what can we do about it.
p474
aVAnd I thought, I'm buggered
p475
aVif I'm going to spend the rest of my life
p476
aVlobbying for these crummy governments
p477
aVto do what needs to be done.
p478
aVSo what we're going to do
p479
aVis we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.
p480
aVSo now, Independent Diplomat
p481
aVis in the process of setting up meetings
p482
aVbetween the U.N. Security Council
p483
aVand the parties to the disputes
p484
aVthat are on the agenda of the Security Council.
p485
aVSo we will be bringing
p486
aVDarfuri rebel groups,
p487
aVthe Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots,
p488
aVrebels from Aceh,
p489
aVand awful long laundry list
p490
aVof chaotic conflicts around the world.
p491
aVAnd we will be trying to bring the parties to New York
p492
aVto sit down in a quiet room
p493
aVin a private setting with no press
p494
aVand actually explain what they want
p495
aVto the members of the U. N. Security Council,
p496
aVand for the members of the U.N. Security Council
p497
aVto explain to them what they want.
p498
aVSo there's actually a conversation,
p499
aVwhich has never before happened.
p500
aVAnd of course, describing all this,
p501
aVany of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult,
p502
aVand I entirely agree with you.
p503
aVThe chances of failure are very high,
p504
aVbut it certainly won't happen
p505
aVif we don't try to make it happen.
p506
aa(lp507
VAnd my politics has changed fundamentally
p508
aVfrom when I was a diplomat to what I am today,
p509
aVand I think that outputs is what matters, not process,
p510
aVnot technology, frankly, so much either.
p511
aVPreach technology
p512
aVto all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations
p513
aVwho are now in political prison in Tehran,
p514
aVwhere Ahmadinejad remains in power.
p515
aVTechnology has not delivered political change in Iran.
p516
aVYou've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself,
p517
aV"What can I do to produce that particular output?"
p518
aVThat is the politics of the 21st century,
p519
aVand in a way, Independent Diplomat
p520
aVembodies that fragmentation, that change,
p521
aVthat is happening to all of us.
p522
aa(lp523
VThat's my story. Thanks.

VCultural evolution is a dangerous child
p5
aVfor any species to let loose on its planet.
p6
aVBy the time you realize what's happening, the child is a toddler,
p7
aVup and causing havoc, and it's too late to put it back.
p8
aVWe humans are Earth's Pandoran species.
p9
aVWe're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box,
p10
aVand we can't push it back in.
p11
aVWe're seeing the consequences all around us.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow that, I suggest, is the view that
p14
aVcomes out of taking memetics seriously.
p15
aVAnd it gives us a new way of thinking about
p16
aVnot only what's going on on our planet,
p17
aVbut what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos.
p18
aVSo first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics
p19
aVand the theory of memes,
p20
aVand secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there,
p21
aVif indeed anyone is.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, memetics:
p24
aVmemetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism.
p25
aVDarwin had this amazing idea.
p26
aVIndeed, some people say
p27
aVit's the best idea anybody ever had.
p28
aVIsn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing
p29
aVas a best idea anybody ever had?
p30
aVDo you think there could?
p31
aVAudience: No.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVSusan Blackmore: Someone says no, very loudly, from over there.
p34
aVWell, I say yes, and if there is, I give the prize to Darwin.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhy?
p37
aVBecause the idea was so simple,
p38
aVand yet it explains all design in the universe.
p39
aVI would say not just biological design,
p40
aVbut all of the design that we think of as human design.
p41
aVIt's all just the same thing happening.
p42
aVWhat did Darwin say?
p43
aVI know you know the idea, natural selection,
p44
aVbut let me just paraphrase "The Origin of Species," 1859,
p45
aVin a few sentences.
p46
aa(lp47
VWhat Darwin said was something like this:
p48
aVif you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted \u2014
p49
aVI've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks
p50
aVand the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on.
p51
aVAnd 100 pages later.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVAnd if there is a struggle for life,
p54
aVsuch that nearly all of these creatures die \u2014
p55
aVand this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus
p56
aVand I've calculated how long it would take for elephants
p57
aVto cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on.
p58
aVAnd another 100 pages later.
p59
aVAnd if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring
p60
aVwhatever it was that helped them survive,
p61
aVthen those offspring must be better adapted
p62
aVto the circumstances in which all this happened
p63
aVthan their parents were.
p64
aa(lp65
VYou see the idea?
p66
aVIf, if, if, then.
p67
aVHe had no concept of the idea of an algorithm,
p68
aVbut that's what he described in that book,
p69
aVand this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm.
p70
aVThe principle is you just need those three things \u2014
p71
aVvariation, selection and heredity.
p72
aVAnd as Dan Dennett puts it, if you have those,
p73
aVthen you must get evolution.
p74
aVOr design out of chaos, without the aid of mind.
p75
aa(lp76
VThere's one word I love on that slide.
p77
aVWhat do you think my favorite word is?
p78
aVAudience: Chaos.
p79
aVSB: Chaos? No. What? Mind? No.
p80
aVAudience: Without.
p81
aVSB: No, not without.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVYou try them all in order: Mmm...?
p84
aVAudience: Must.
p85
aVSB: Must, at must. Must, must.
p86
aVThis is what makes it so amazing.
p87
aVYou don't need a designer,
p88
aVor a plan, or foresight, or anything else.
p89
aVIf there's something that is copied with variation
p90
aVand it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere.
p91
aVYou can't stop it.
p92
aVMust is my favorite word there.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, what's this to do with memes?
p95
aVWell, the principle here applies to anything
p96
aVthat is copied with variation and selection.
p97
aVWe're so used to thinking in terms of biology,
p98
aVwe think about genes this way.
p99
aVDarwin didn't, of course; he didn't know about genes.
p100
aVHe talked mostly about animals and plants,
p101
aVbut also about languages evolving and becoming extinct.
p102
aVBut the principle of Universal Darwinism
p103
aVis that any information that is varied and selected
p104
aVwill produce design.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd this is what Richard Dawkins was on about
p107
aVin his 1976 bestseller, "The Selfish Gene."
p108
aVThe information that is copied, he called the replicator.
p109
aVIt selfishly copies.
p110
aVNot meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going, "I want to get copied."
p111
aVBut that it will get copied if it can,
p112
aVregardless of the consequences.
p113
aVIt doesn't care about the consequences because it can't,
p114
aVbecause it's just information being copied.
p115
aVAnd he wanted to get away
p116
aVfrom everybody thinking all the time about genes,
p117
aVand so he said, "Is there another replicator out there on the planet?"
p118
aVAh, yes, there is.
p119
aa(lp120
VLook around you \u2014 here will do, in this room.
p121
aVAll around us, still clumsily drifting about
p122
aVin its primeval soup of culture, is another replicator.
p123
aVInformation that we copy from person to person, by imitation,
p124
aVby language, by talking, by telling stories,
p125
aVby wearing clothes, by doing things.
p126
aVThis is information copied with variation and selection.
p127
aVThis is design process going on.
p128
aVHe wanted a name for the new replicator.
p129
aVSo, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated.
p130
aVRemember that, that's the core definition:
p131
aVthat which is imitated.
p132
aVAnd abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good
p133
aVand made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.
p134
aVSo that's how the idea came about.
p135
aVIt's important to stick with that definition.
p136
aa(lp137
VThe whole science of memetics is much maligned,
p138
aVmuch misunderstood, much feared.
p139
aVBut a lot of these problems can be avoided
p140
aVby remembering the definition.
p141
aVA meme is not equivalent to an idea.
p142
aVIt's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else, really.
p143
aVStick with the definition.
p144
aVIt's that which is imitated,
p145
aVor information which is copied from person to person.
p146
aVSo, let's see some memes.
p147
aa(lp148
VWell, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck
p149
aVin that particularly fetching way.
p150
aVI wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself,
p151
aVor copied it from someone else?
p152
aVIf you copied it from someone else, it's a meme.
p153
aVAnd what about, oh, I can't see any interesting memes here.
p154
aVAll right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me?
p155
aVOh, well, your earrings,
p156
aVI don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings.
p157
aVYou probably went out and bought them.
p158
aVThere are plenty more in the shops.
p159
aVThat's something that's passed on from person to person.
p160
aVAll the stories that we're telling \u2014 well, of course,
p161
aVTED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe way to think about memes, though,
p164
aVis to think, why do they spread?
p165
aVThey're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can.
p166
aVBut some of them will be copied because they're good,
p167
aVor true, or useful, or beautiful.
p168
aVSome of them will be copied even though they're not.
p169
aVSome, it's quite hard to tell why.
p170
aa(lp171
VThere's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy.
p172
aVAnd I'm glad to say, as I expected, I found it when I came here,
p173
aVand I'm sure all of you found it, too.
p174
aVYou go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere,
p175
aVand you come in and you put down your clothes
p176
aVand you go to the bathroom, and what do you see?
p177
aVAudience: Bathroom soap.
p178
aVSB: Pardon?
p179
aVAudience: Soap.
p180
aVSB: Soap, yeah. What else do you see?
p181
aVAudience: (Inaudible)
p182
aVSB: Mmm mmm.
p183
aVAudience: Sink, toilet!
p184
aVSB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes,
p185
aVbut they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVWhat is this one doing?
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVThis has spread all over the world.
p190
aVIt's not surprising that you all found it
p191
aVwhen you arrived in your bathrooms here.
p192
aVBut I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent
p193
aVin the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVWho folded that thing up there, and why?
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aVSome people get carried away.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVOther people are just lazy and make mistakes.
p200
aVSome hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes
p201
aVwith a little sticker.
p202
aV(Laughter)
p203
aVWhat is this all about?
p204
aVI suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's
p205
aVcleaned the place, and it's all lovely.
p206
aVAnd you know, actually, all it tells you is that another person
p207
aVhas potentially spread germs from place to place.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VSo, think of it this way.
p211
aVImagine a world full of brains
p212
aVand far more memes than can possibly find homes.
p213
aVThe memes are all trying to get copied \u2014
p214
aVtrying, in inverted commas \u2014 i.e.,
p215
aVthat's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will.
p216
aVThey're using you and me as their propagating, copying machinery,
p217
aVand we are the meme machines.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, why is this important?
p220
aVWhy is this useful, or what does it tell us?
p221
aVIt gives us a completely new view of human origins
p222
aVand what it means to be human,
p223
aVall conventional theories of cultural evolution,
p224
aVof the origin of humans,
p225
aVand what makes us so different from other species.
p226
aVAll other theories explaining the big brain, and language, and tool use
p227
aVand all these things that make us unique,
p228
aVare based upon genes.
p229
aVLanguage must have been useful for the genes.
p230
aVTool use must have enhanced our survival, mating and so on.
p231
aVIt always comes back, as Richard Dawkins complained
p232
aVall that long time ago, it always comes back to genes.
p233
aa(lp234
VThe point of memetics is to say, "Oh no, it doesn't."
p235
aVThere are two replicators now on this planet.
p236
aVFrom the moment that our ancestors,
p237
aVperhaps two and a half million years ago or so,
p238
aVbegan imitating, there was a new copying process.
p239
aVCopying with variation and selection.
p240
aVA new replicator was let loose, and it could never be \u2014
p241
aVright from the start \u2014 it could never be
p242
aVthat human beings who let loose this new creature,
p243
aVcould just copy the useful, beautiful, true things,
p244
aVand not copy the other things.
p245
aVWhile their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy \u2014
p246
aVlighting fires, keeping fires going, new techniques of hunting,
p247
aVthese kinds of things \u2014
p248
aVinevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair,
p249
aVor wearing strange clothes, or painting their faces,
p250
aVor whatever.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo, you get an arms race between the genes
p253
aVwhich are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains
p254
aVand not waste their time copying all this stuff,
p255
aVand the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied \u2014
p256
aVin other words, what turned out to be language \u2014
p257
aVcompeting to get the brains to get bigger and bigger.
p258
aVSo, the big brain, on this theory, is driven by the memes.
p259
aa(lp260
VThis is why, in "The Meme Machine," I called it memetic drive.
p261
aVAs the memes evolve, as they inevitably must,
p262
aVthey drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes
p263
aVthat are doing the driving.
p264
aVThis is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains,
p265
aVthat we like religion, and music, and art.
p266
aVLanguage is a parasite that we've adapted to,
p267
aVnot something that was there originally for our genes,
p268
aVon this view.
p269
aVAnd like most parasites, it can begin dangerous,
p270
aVbut then it coevolves and adapts,
p271
aVand we end up with a symbiotic relationship
p272
aVwith this new parasite.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd so, from our perspective,
p275
aVwe don't realize that that's how it began.
p276
aVSo, this is a view of what humans are.
p277
aVAll other species on this planet are gene machines only,
p278
aVthey don't imitate at all well, hardly at all.
p279
aVWe alone are gene machines and meme machines as well.
p280
aVThe memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine.
p281
aa(lp282
VBut that's not all.
p283
aVWe have a new kind of memes now.
p284
aVI've been wondering for a long time,
p285
aVsince I've been thinking about memes a lot,
p286
aVis there a difference between the memes that we copy \u2014
p287
aVthe words we speak to each other,
p288
aVthe gestures we copy, the human things \u2014
p289
aVand all these technological things around us?
p290
aVI have always, until now, called them all memes,
p291
aVbut I do honestly think now
p292
aVwe need a new word for technological memes.
p293
aa(lp294
VLet's call them techno-memes or temes.
p295
aVBecause the processes are getting different.
p296
aVWe began, perhaps 5,000 years ago, with writing.
p297
aVWe put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet,
p298
aVbut in order to get true temes and true teme machines,
p299
aVyou need to get the variation, the selection and the copying,
p300
aVall done outside of humans.
p301
aVAnd we're getting there.
p302
aVWe're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there,
p303
aVthat there are machines like that.
p304
aVAnd indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED,
p305
aVI see we're even closer than I thought we were before.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo actually, now the temes are forcing our brains
p308
aVto become more like teme machines.
p309
aVOur children are growing up very quickly learning to read,
p310
aVlearning to use machinery.
p311
aVWe're going to have all kinds of implants,
p312
aVdrugs that force us to stay awake all the time.
p313
aVWe'll think we're choosing these things,
p314
aVbut the temes are making us do it.
p315
aVSo, we're at this cusp now
p316
aVof having a third replicator on our planet.
p317
aVNow, what about what else is going on out there in the universe?
p318
aVIs there anyone else out there?
p319
aVPeople have been asking this question for a long time.
p320
aVWe've been asking it here at TED already.
p321
aVIn 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation,
p322
aVbut I think he concentrated on the wrong things.
p323
aVIt's been very productive, that equation.
p324
aVHe wanted to estimate N,
p325
aVthe number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy,
p326
aVand he included in there the rate of star formation,
p327
aVthe rate of planets, but crucially, intelligence.
p328
aa(lp329
VI think that's the wrong way to think about it.
p330
aVIntelligence appears all over the place, in all kinds of guises.
p331
aVHuman intelligence is only one kind of a thing.
p332
aVBut what's really important is the replicators you have
p333
aVand the levels of replicators, one feeding on the one before.
p334
aVSo, I would suggest that we don't think intelligence,
p335
aVwe think replicators.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd on that basis, I've suggested a different kind of equation.
p338
aVA very simple equation.
p339
aVN, the same thing,
p340
aVthe number of communicative civilizations out there
p341
aV[that] we might expect in our galaxy.
p342
aVJust start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy.
p343
aVThe fraction of those which get a first replicator.
p344
aVThe fraction of those that get the second replicator.
p345
aVThe fraction of those that get the third replicator.
p346
aVBecause it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out \u2014
p347
aVsending information, sending probes, getting out there,
p348
aVand communicating with anywhere else.
p349
aa(lp350
VOK, so if we take that equation,
p351
aVwhy haven't we heard from anybody out there?
p352
aVBecause every step is dangerous.
p353
aVGetting a new replicator is dangerous.
p354
aVYou can pull through, we have pulled through,
p355
aVbut it's dangerous.
p356
aVTake the first step, as soon as life appeared on this earth.
p357
aVWe may take the Gaian view.
p358
aVI loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday \u2014 it's not Gaian all the time.
p359
aVActually, life forms produce things that kill themselves.
p360
aVWell, we did pull through on this planet.
p361
aa(lp362
VBut then, a long time later, billions of years later,
p363
aVwe got the second replicator, the memes.
p364
aVThat was dangerous, all right.
p365
aVThink of the big brain.
p366
aVHow many mothers do we have here?
p367
aVYou know all about big brains.
p368
aVThey are dangerous to give birth to,
p369
aVare agonizing to give birth to.
p370
aV(Laughter)
p371
aVMy cat gave birth to four kittens, purring all the time.
p372
aVAh, mm \u2014 slightly different.
p373
aV(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VBut not only is it painful, it kills lots of babies,
p376
aVit kills lots of mothers,
p377
aVand it's very expensive to produce.
p378
aVThe genes are forced into producing all this myelin,
p379
aVall the fat to myelinate the brain.
p380
aVDo you know, sitting here,
p381
aVyour brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output
p382
aVfor two percent of your body weight?
p383
aVIt's a really expensive organ to run.
p384
aVWhy? Because it's producing the memes.
p385
aa(lp386
VNow, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off,
p387
aVand maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know.
p388
aVBut maybe it nearly did.
p389
aVHas it been tried before?
p390
aVWhat about all those other species?
p391
aVLouise Leakey talked yesterday
p392
aVabout how we're the only one in this branch left.
p393
aVWhat happened to the others?
p394
aVCould it be that this experiment in imitation,
p395
aVthis experiment in a second replicator,
p396
aVis dangerous enough to kill people off?
p397
aa(lp398
VWell, we did pull through, and we adapted.
p399
aVBut now, we're hitting, as I've just described,
p400
aVwe're hitting the third replicator point.
p401
aVAnd this is even more dangerous \u2014
p402
aVwell, it's dangerous again.
p403
aVWhy? Because the temes are selfish replicators
p404
aVand they don't care about us, or our planet, or anything else.
p405
aVThey're just information, why would they?
p406
aVThey are using us to suck up the planet's resources
p407
aVto produce more computers,
p408
aVand more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED.
p409
aVDon't think, "Oh, we created the Internet for our own benefit."
p410
aVThat's how it seems to us.
p411
aVThink, temes spreading because they must.
p412
aVWe are the old machines.
p413
aa(lp414
VNow, are we going to pull through?
p415
aVWhat's going to happen?
p416
aVWhat does it mean to pull through?
p417
aVWell, there are kind of two ways of pulling through.
p418
aVOne that is obviously happening all around us now,
p419
aVis that the temes turn us into teme machines,
p420
aVwith these implants, with the drugs,
p421
aVwith us merging with the technology.
p422
aVAnd why would they do that?
p423
aVBecause we are self-replicating.
p424
aVWe have babies.
p425
aVWe make new ones, and so it's convenient to piggyback on us,
p426
aVbecause we're not yet at the stage on this planet
p427
aVwhere the other option is viable.
p428
aVAlthough it's closer, I heard this morning,
p429
aVit's closer than I thought it was.
p430
aVWhere the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves.
p431
aVThat way, it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate
p432
aVwas utterly destabilized,
p433
aVand it was no longer possible for humans to live here.
p434
aVBecause those teme machines, they wouldn't need \u2014
p435
aVthey're not squishy, wet, oxygen-breathing,
p436
aVwarmth-requiring creatures.
p437
aVThey could carry on without us.

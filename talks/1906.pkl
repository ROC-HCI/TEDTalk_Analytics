VPat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage.
p5
aa(lp6
VSheryl Sandberg: First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out
p7
aVand see so many women.
p8
aVIt's so not my regular experience,  as I know anyone else's.
p9
aa(lp10
VPM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media,
p11
aVwhich we assumed it would be, but  that you had very much on your mind
p12
aVthe missing leadership positions, particularly  in the sector of technology and social media.
p13
aVBut how did that evolve for you as a thought, and end up being the TED Talk that you gave?
p14
aa(lp15
VSS: So I was really scared to get on  this stage and talk about women,
p16
aVbecause I grew up in the business  world, as I think so many of us did.
p17
aVYou never talk about being a woman, because  someone might notice that you're a woman, right?
p18
aVThey might notice. Or worse, if you say "woman,"  people on the other end of the table
p19
aVthink you're asking for special  treatment, or complaining.
p20
aVOr worse, about to sue them.  And so I went through \u2014 (Laughter)
p21
aVRight? I went through my entire business career,
p22
aVand never spoke about being a woman,  never spoke about it publicly.
p23
aVBut I also had noticed that it wasn't working.
p24
aa(lp25
VI came out of college over  20 years ago, and I thought
p26
aVthat all of my peers were men and women,  all the people above me were all men,
p27
aVbut that would change,
p28
aVbecause your generation had done such  an amazing job fighting for equality,
p29
aVequality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't.
p30
aVBecause year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer,
p31
aVand now, often the only woman in a room.
p32
aVAnd I talked to a bunch of people about,
p33
aVshould I give a speech at TEDWomen  about women, and they said, oh no, no.
p34
aVIt will end your business career. You  cannot be a serious business executive
p35
aVand speak about being a woman.  You'll never be taken seriously again.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut fortunately, there were the few, the proud \u2014 like you \u2014 who told me I should give the speech,
p38
aVand I asked myself the question  Mark Zuckerberg might \u2014
p39
aVthe founder of Facebook and my boss \u2014
p40
aVasks all of us, which is, what  would I do if I wasn't afraid?
p41
aVAnd the answer to what would I do if I wasn't  afraid is I would get on the TED stage,
p42
aVand talk about women, and leadership.  And I did, and survived. (Applause)
p43
aa(lp44
VPM: I would say, not only survived.  I'm thinking of that moment, Sheryl,
p45
aVwhen you and I were standing backstage  together, and you turned to me,
p46
aVand you told me a story.
p47
aVAnd I said \u2014 very last minute \u2014 you know,  you really should share that story.
p48
aa(lp49
VSS: Oh, yeah. PM: What was that story?
p50
aa(lp51
VSS: Well, it's an important part of the  journey. So I had \u2014 TEDWomen \u2014
p52
aVthe original one was in D.C. \u2014 so I live here,  so I had gotten on a plane the day before,
p53
aVand my daughter was three, she was  clinging to my leg: "Mommy, don't go."
p54
aVAnd Pat's a friend, and so, not related  to the speech I was planning on giving,
p55
aVwhich was chock full of facts and  figures, and nothing personal,
p56
aVI told Pat the story. I said, well,  I'm having a hard day.
p57
aVYesterday my daughter was clinging  to my leg, and "Don't go."
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd you looked at me and said,  you have to tell that story.
p60
aVI said, on the TED stage? Are you kidding?
p61
aVI'm going to get on a stage and admit  my daughter was clinging to my leg?
p62
aVAnd you said yes, because if you want to talk  about getting more women into leadership roles,
p63
aVyou have to be honest about how hard it is.
p64
aVAnd I did. And I think that's a really  important part of the journey.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe same thing happened when I wrote my book.  I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter,
p67
aVI thought it was fabulous. It was  chock-full of data and figures,
p68
aVI had three pages on matrilineal Maasai  tribes, and their sociological patterns.
p69
aVMy husband read it and he was like, this  is like eating your Wheaties. (Laughter)
p70
aVNo one \u2014 and I apologize to Wheaties if there's  someone \u2014 no one, no one will read this book.
p71
aVAnd I realized through the process that I  had to be more honest and more open,
p72
aVand I had to tell my stories. My stories of still  not feeling as self-confident as I should,
p73
aVin many situations. My first and  failed marriage. Crying at work.
p74
aVFelling like I didn't belong there,  feeling guilty to this day.
p75
aVAnd part of my journey, starting on this stage,  going to "Lean In," going to the foundation,
p76
aVis all about being more open and  honest about those challenges,
p77
aVso that other women can be more open and honest,
p78
aVand all of us can work together towards real equality.
p79
aa(lp80
VPM: I think that one of the most  striking parts about the book,
p81
aVand in my opinion, one of the reasons it's hit such  a nerve and is resonating around the world,
p82
aVis that you are personal in the book,  and that you do make it clear that,
p83
aVwhile you've observed some things that are  very important for other women to know,
p84
aVthat you've had the same challenges  that many others of us have,
p85
aVas you faced the hurdles and the barriers and  possibly the people who don't believe the same.
p86
aVSo talk about that process: deciding  you'd go public with the private part,
p87
aVand then you would also put yourself in  the position of something of an expert
p88
aVon how to resolve those challenges.
p89
aa(lp90
VSS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was \u2014
p91
aVyou know, I never really expected to write  a book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer,
p92
aVand it was viewed a lot, and it really  started impacting people's lives.
p93
aVI got this great \u2014- one of the first  letters I got was from a woman
p94
aVwho said that she was offered a really big  promotion at work, and she turned it down,
p95
aVand she told her best friend she turned  it down, and her best friend said,
p96
aVyou really need to watch this TED Talk.
p97
aVAnd so she watched this TED Talk, and she  went back the next day, she took the job,
p98
aVshe went home, and she handed her  husband the grocery list. (Laughter)
p99
aVAnd she said, I can do this.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd what really mattered to me \u2014 it wasn't  only women in the corporate world,
p102
aVeven though I did hear from a lot of  them, and it did impact a lot of them,
p103
aVit was also people of all different circumstances.
p104
aVThere was a doctor I met who was an  attending physician at Johns Hopkins,
p105
aVand he said that until he saw my TED  Talk, it never really occurred to him
p106
aVthat even though half the students in  his med school classes were women,
p107
aVthey weren't speaking as much as  the men as he did his rounds.
p108
aVSo he started paying attention, and as he waited for  raised hands, he realized the men's hands were up.
p109
aVSo he started encouraging the  women to raise their hands more,
p110
aVand it still didn't work.
p111
aVSo he told everyone, no more  hand raising, I'm cold-calling.
p112
aVSo he could call evenly on men and women.  And what he proved to himself was that
p113
aVthe women knew the answers just as well or better,
p114
aVand he was able to go back  to them and tell them that.
p115
aVAnd then there was the woman, stay-at-home  mom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood,
p116
aVwith not a great school, she said that TED  Talk \u2014 she's never had a corporate job,
p117
aVbut that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school  and fight for a better teacher for her child.
p118
aVAnd I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.
p119
aVAnd I realized that other women and  men could find their voice through it,
p120
aVwhich is why I went from the talk to the book.
p121
aa(lp122
VPM: And in the book, you not only found your  voice, which is clear and strong in the book,
p123
aVbut you also share what you've learned \u2014
p124
aVthe experiences of other people in the lessons.
p125
aVAnd that's what I'm thinking about  in terms of putting yourself in a \u2014
p126
aVyou became a sort of expert in how you lean in.
p127
aVSo what did that feel like, and  become like in your life?
p128
aVTo launch not just a book, not just  a best-selling, best-viewed talk,
p129
aVbut a movement, where people began to  literally describe their actions at work as,
p130
aVI'm leaning in.
p131
aa(lp132
VSS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored,  I'm happy, and it's the very beginning.
p133
aVSo I don't know if I'm an expert, or if anyone is  an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research.
p134
aVI have read every study, I have  pored over the materials,
p135
aVand the lessons are very clear.  Because here's what we know:
p136
aVWhat we know is that stereotypes are holding women  back from leadership roles all over the world.
p137
aVIt's so striking. "Lean In" is very global,  I've been all over the world,
p138
aVtalking about it, and \u2014 cultures are so different.
p139
aVEven within our own country, to Japan,  to Korea, to China, to Asia, Europe,
p140
aVthey're so different. Except for one thing: gender.
p141
aVAll over the world, no matter what our cultures are,
p142
aVwe think men should be strong,  assertive, aggressive, have voice;
p143
aVwe think women should speak  when spoken to, help others.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow we have, all over the world,
p146
aVwomen are called "bossy."  There is a word for "bossy,"
p147
aVfor little girls, in every language there's one.
p148
aVIt's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys,
p149
aVbecause if a little boy leads,  there's no negative word for it,
p150
aVit's expected. But if a little girl leads, she's bossy.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow I know there aren't a lot of  men here, but bear with me.
p153
aVIf you're a man, you'll have  to represent your gender.
p154
aVPlease raise your hand if you've been  told you're too aggressive at work.
p155
aV(Laughter) There's always a few, it runs about  five percent. Okay, get ready, gentlemen.
p156
aVIf you're a woman, please raise your hand if you've  ever been told you're too aggressive at work.
p157
aV(Laughter) That is what audiences have  said in every country in the world,
p158
aVand it's deeply supported by the data.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow, do we think women are more  aggressive than men? Of course not.
p161
aVIt's just that we judge them through a different lens,
p162
aVand a lot of the character traits that you must  exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead,
p163
aVare ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss,
p164
aVand in a woman, she's bossy.
p165
aVAnd the good news about this is that we  can change this by acknowledging it.
p166
aa(lp167
VOne of the happiest moments  I had in this whole journey is,
p168
aVafter the book came out, I stood on a stage  with John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco.
p169
aVHe read the book. He stood on a stage with me, he  invited me in front of his whole management team,
p170
aVmen and women, and he said, I thought we  were good at this. I thought I was good at this.
p171
aVAnd then I read this book, and I  realized that we \u2014 my company \u2014
p172
aVwe have called all of our  senior women too aggressive,
p173
aVand I'm standing on this stage, and I'm sorry.
p174
aVAnd I want you to know we're  never going to do it again.
p175
aa(lp176
VPM: Can we send that to a lot of other  people that we know? (Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VSS: And so John is doing that because  he believes it's good for his company,
p179
aVand so this kind of acknowledgement  of these biases can change it.
p180
aVAnd so next time you all see  someone call a little girl "bossy,"
p181
aVyou walk right up to that person,  big smile, and you say,
p182
aV"That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has  executive leadership skills." (Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VPM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter.  SS: Absolutely.
p185
aa(lp186
VPM: And you did focus in the book \u2014 and  the reason, as you said, in writing it,
p187
aVwas to create a dialogue about this.
p188
aVI mean, let's just put it out there,  face the fact that women are \u2014
p189
aVin a time when we have more open  doors, and more opportunities \u2014
p190
aVare still not getting to the leadership positions.
p191
aVSo in the months that have come since the book,
p192
aVin which "Lean In" focused on that and said,
p193
aVhere are some of the challenges that remain, and  many of them we have to own within ourselves
p194
aVand look at ourselves. What has changed?
p195
aVHave you seen changes?
p196
aa(lp197
VSS: Well, there's certainly more  dialogue, which is great.
p198
aVBut what really matters to me,  and I think all of us, is action.
p199
aVSo everywhere I go, CEOs,  they're mostly men, say to me,
p200
aVyou're costing me so much money
p201
aVbecause all the women want to  be paid as much as the men.
p202
aVAnd to them I say, I'm not sorry at all. (Laughter)
p203
aVAt all. I mean, the women should  be paid as much as the men.
p204
aa(lp205
VEverywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises.
p206
aVEverywhere I go, women say they're getting  better relationships with their spouses,
p207
aVasking for more help at home, asking for the  promotions they should be getting at work,
p208
aVand importantly, believing it  themselves. Even little things.
p209
aVOne of the governors of one of the states told me  that he didn't realize that more women were, in fact,
p210
aVliterally sitting on the side  of the room, which they are,
p211
aVand now he made a rule that all the women  on his staff need to sit at the table.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe foundation I started along  with the book "Lean In"
p214
aVhelps women, or men, start circles \u2014 small groups,
p215
aVit can be 10, it can be however many  you want, which meet once a month.
p216
aVI would have hoped that by now, we'd have  about 500 circles. That would've been great.
p217
aVYou know, 500 times roughly 10.
p218
aVThere are over 12,000 circles  in 50 countries in the world.
p219
aa(lp220
VPM: Wow, that's amazing.
p221
aa(lp222
VSS: And these are people who  are meeting every single month.
p223
aVI met one of them, I was in Beijing.
p224
aVA group of women, they're all about 29 or 30,  they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing,
p225
aVseveral of them grew up in very poor, rural China.
p226
aVThese women are 29, they are told by  their society that they are "left over,"
p227
aVbecause they are not yet married,
p228
aVand the process of coming together  once a month at a meeting
p229
aVis helping them define who they are for themselves.
p230
aVWhat they want in their careers. The  kind of partners they want, if at all.
p231
aVI looked at them, we went around  and introduced ourselves,
p232
aVand they all said their names  and where they're from,
p233
aVand I said, I'm Sheryl Sandberg,  and this was my dream.
p234
aVAnd I kind of just started crying.
p235
aVRight, which, I admit, I do. Right?  I've talked about it before.
p236
aVBut the fact that a woman so far away out in  the world, who grew up in a rural village,
p237
aVwho's being told to marry someone  she doesn't want to marry,
p238
aVcan now go meet once a month with  a group of people and refuse that,
p239
aVand find life on her own terms.
p240
aVThat's the kind of change we have to hope for.
p241
aa(lp242
VPM: Have you been surprised by  the global nature of the message?
p243
aVBecause I think when the book first  came out, many people thought,
p244
aVwell, this is a really important handbook  for young women on their way up.
p245
aVThey need to look at this, anticipate  the barriers, and recognize them,
p246
aVput them out in the open, have the dialogue about it,
p247
aVbut that it's really for women who are that.  Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world.
p248
aVAnd yet the book is being read, as you  say, in rural and developing countries.
p249
aVWhat part of that has surprised you, and  perhaps led to a new perspective on your part?
p250
aa(lp251
VSS: The book is about self-confidence,  and about equality.
p252
aVAnd it turns out, everywhere in the world,  women need more self-confidence,
p253
aVbecause the world tells us we're not equal to men.
p254
aVEverywhere in the world, we live in  a world where the men get "and,"
p255
aVand women get "or."
p256
aVI've never met a man who's been  asked how he does it all. (Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VAgain, I'm going to turn to the men in the audience:
p259
aVPlease raise your hand if you've  been asked, how do you do it all?
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVMen only.
p262
aVWomen, women. Please raise your hand  if you've been asked how you do it all?
p263
aVWe assume men can do it all,  slash \u2014 have jobs and children.
p264
aVWe assume women can't, and that's ridiculous,
p265
aVbecause the great majority of women everywhere  in the world, including the United States,
p266
aVwork full time and have children.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd I think people don't fully understand  how broad the message is.
p269
aVThere is a circle that's been started  for rescued sex workers in Miami.
p270
aVThey're using "Lean In" to help  people make the transition
p271
aVback to what would be a fair life, really rescuing  them from their pimps, and using it.
p272
aVThere are dress-for-success groups  in Texas which are using the book,
p273
aVfor women who have never been to college.
p274
aVAnd we know there are groups  all the way to Ethiopia.
p275
aVAnd so these messages of equality \u2014 of how women  are told they can't have what men can have \u2014
p276
aVhow we assume that leadership is for men,  how we assume that voice is for men,
p277
aVthese affect all of us, and I  think they are very universal.
p278
aVAnd it's part of what TEDWomen does.
p279
aVIt unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in,
p280
aVwhich is more women, more voice, more equality.
p281
aa(lp282
VPM: If you were invited now to  make another TEDWomen talk,
p283
aVwhat would you say that is a result  of this experience, for you personally,
p284
aVand what you've learned about women, and men,
p285
aVas you've made this journey?
p286
aa(lp287
VSS: I think I would say \u2014 I tried to say this strongly,
p288
aVbut I think I can say it more strongly \u2014
p289
aVI want to say that the status quo is not enough.
p290
aVThat it's not good enough, that it's  not changing quickly enough.
p291
aVSince I gave my TED Talk and published my book,  another year of data came out from the U.S. Census.
p292
aVAnd you know what we found?
p293
aVNo movement in the wage gap  for women in the United States.
p294
aVSeventy-seven cents to the dollar.
p295
aVIf you are a black woman, 64 cents.
p296
aVIf you are a Latina, we're at 54 cents.
p297
aVDo you know when the last  time those numbers went up?
p298
aV2002.
p299
aVWe are stagnating, we are  stagnating in so many ways.
p300
aVAnd I think we are not really being honest about that,
p301
aVfor so many reasons. It's so  hard to talk about gender.
p302
aVWe shy away from the word "feminist,"  a word I really think we need to embrace.
p303
aVWe have to get rid of the  word bossy and bring back \u2014
p304
aV(Applause)
p305
aVI think I would say in a louder voice,  we need to get rid of the word "bossy"
p306
aVand bring back the word "feminist,"  because we need it.
p307
aV(Applause)
p308
aa(lp309
VPM: And we all need to do a lot more leaning in.
p310
aa(lp311
VSS: A lot more leaning in.
p312
aa(lp313
VPM: Thank you, Sheryl.
p314
aVThanks for leaning in and saying yes.
p315
aa(lp316
VSS: Thank you.

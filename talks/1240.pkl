VI am a conductor,
p5
aVand I'm here today
p6
aVto talk to you about trust.
p7
aVMy job depends upon it.
p8
aVThere has to be, between me and the orchestra,
p9
aVan unshakable bond of trust,
p10
aVborn out of mutual respect,
p11
aVthrough which we can spin a musical narrative
p12
aVthat we all believe in.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow in the old days, conducting, music making,
p15
aVwas less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.
p16
aVUp to and around about the Second World War,
p17
aVconductors were invariably dictators \u2014
p18
aVthese tyrannical figures
p19
aVwho would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it,
p20
aVwithin an inch of their lives.
p21
aVBut I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on,
p22
aVmusic has moved on with it.
p23
aVWe now have a more democratic view and way of making music \u2014
p24
aVa two-way street.
p25
aVI, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense
p26
aVof the outer architecture of that music,
p27
aVwithin which there is then immense personal freedom
p28
aVfor the members of the orchestra to shine.
p29
aa(lp30
VFor myself, of course,
p31
aVI have to completely trust my body language.
p32
aVThat's all I have at the point of sale.
p33
aVIt's silent gesture.
p34
aVI can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Music)
p37
aa(lp38
VLadies and gentlemen, the Scottish Ensemble.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Applause)
p41
aa(lp42
VSo in order for all this to work,
p43
aVobviously I have got to be in a position of trust.
p44
aVI have to trust the orchestra,
p45
aVand, even more crucially, I have to trust myself.
p46
aVThink about it: when you're in a position of not trusting,
p47
aVwhat do you do?
p48
aVYou overcompensate.
p49
aVAnd in my game, that means you overgesticulate.
p50
aVYou end up like some kind of rabid windmill.
p51
aVAnd the bigger your gesture gets,
p52
aVthe more ill-defined, blurry
p53
aVand, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra.
p54
aVYou become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore, only ridicule.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd I remember at the beginning of my career,
p57
aVagain and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras,
p58
aVI would be going completely insane on the podium,
p59
aVtrying to engender a small scale crescendo really,
p60
aVjust a little upsurge in volume.
p61
aVBugger me, they wouldn't give it to me.
p62
aVI spent a lot of time in those early years
p63
aVweeping silently in dressing rooms.
p64
aVAnd how futile seemed the words of advice to me
p65
aVfrom great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis
p66
aVwho said, "Conducting, Charles,
p67
aVis like holding a small bird in your hand.
p68
aVIf you hold it too tightly, you crush it.
p69
aVIf you hold it too loosely, it flies away."
p70
aVI have to say, in those days, I couldn't really even find the bird.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow a fundamental
p73
aVand really viscerally important experience for me, in terms of music,
p74
aVhas been my adventures in South Africa,
p75
aVthe most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view,
p76
aVbut a country which, through its musical culture,
p77
aVhas taught me one fundamental lesson:
p78
aVthat through music making
p79
aVcan come deep levels
p80
aVof fundamental life-giving trust.
p81
aVBack in 2000, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa
p82
aVto form a new opera company.
p83
aVSo I went out there, and I auditioned,
p84
aVmainly in rural township locations, right around the country.
p85
aVI heard about 2,000 singers
p86
aVand pulled together a company
p87
aVof 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers,
p88
aVthe majority of whom were black,
p89
aVbut there were a handful of white performers.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period
p92
aVthat one of those white performers
p93
aVhad, in his previous incarnation,
p94
aVbeen a member of the South African police force.
p95
aVAnd in the last years of the old regime,
p96
aVhe would routinely be detailed to go into the township
p97
aVto aggress the community.
p98
aVNow you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room,
p99
aVthe general atmosphere.
p100
aVLet's be under no illusions.
p101
aVIn South Africa, the relationship most devoid of trust
p102
aVis that between a white policeman
p103
aVand the black community.
p104
aVSo how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen?
p105
aVSimply through singing.
p106
aVWe sang, we sang,
p107
aVwe sang,
p108
aVand amazingly new trust grew,
p109
aVand indeed friendship blossomed.
p110
aVAnd that showed me such a fundamental truth,
p111
aVthat music making and other forms of creativity
p112
aVcan so often go to places
p113
aVwhere mere words cannot.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally.
p116
aVOne of them was "Carmen."
p117
aVWe then thought we'd make a movie of "Carmen,"
p118
aVwhich we recorded and shot outside on location
p119
aVin the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha.
p120
aVThe piece was sung entirely in Xhosa,
p121
aVwhich is a beautifully musical language, if you don't know it.
p122
aVIt's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" \u2014
p123
aVliterally "Carmen of Khayelitsha."
p124
aVI want to play you a tiny clip of it now
p125
aVfor no other reason than to give you proof positive
p126
aVthat there is nothing tiny about South African music making.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Music)
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VSomething which I find utterly enchanting
p133
aVabout South African music making
p134
aVis that it's so free.
p135
aVSouth Africans just make music really freely.
p136
aVAnd I think, in no small way,
p137
aVthat's due to one fundamental fact:
p138
aVthey're not bound to a system of notation.
p139
aVThey don't read music.
p140
aVThey trust their ears.
p141
aVYou can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat.
p142
aVAnd then, as if by magic,
p143
aVthey will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune
p144
aVbecause they can.
p145
aVNow those of us that live in the West, if I can use that term,
p146
aVI think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music \u2014
p147
aVthat somehow it's all about skill and systems.
p148
aVTherefore it's the exclusive preserve
p149
aVof an elite, talented body.
p150
aVAnd yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planet
p151
aVprobably engages with music on a daily basis.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd if I can broaden this out for a second,
p154
aVI'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room
p155
aVwould be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence,
p156
aVabout movies, probably about literature.
p157
aVBut how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion
p158
aVabout a piece of classical music?
p159
aVWhy is this?
p160
aVAnd what I'm going to say to you now
p161
aVis I'm just urging you to get over
p162
aVthis supreme lack of self-confidence,
p163
aVto take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears,
p164
aVyou can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue,
p165
aVfiber, DNA,
p166
aVwhat makes a great piece of music great.
p167
aVI've got a little experiment I want to try with you.
p168
aa(lp169
VDid you know
p170
aVthat TED is a tune?
p171
aVA very simple tune based on three notes \u2014 T, E, D.
p172
aVNow hang on a minute.
p173
aVI know you're going to say to me, "T doesn't exist in music."
p174
aVWell ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system,
p175
aVwhich composers have been using for hundreds of years,
p176
aVwhich proves actually that it does.
p177
aVIf I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G \u2014
p178
aVand I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale:
p179
aVH, I, J, K, L, M, N,
p180
aVO, P, Q, R, S, T \u2014 there you go.
p181
aVT, see it's the same as F in music.
p182
aVSo T is F.
p183
aVSo T, E, D is the same as F, E, D.
p184
aVNow that piece of music that we played at the start of this session
p185
aVhad enshrined in its heart
p186
aVthe theme, which is TED.
p187
aVHave a listen.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Music)
p190
aa(lp191
VDo you hear it?
p192
aVOr do I smell some doubt in the room?
p193
aVOkay, we'll play it for you again now,
p194
aVand we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D.
p195
aVIf you'll pardon the expression.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Music)
p198
aa(lp199
VOh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely.
p200
aVI think we should make this even more explicit.
p201
aVLadies and gentlemen, it's nearly time for tea.
p202
aVWould you reckon you need to sing for your tea, I think?
p203
aVI think we need to sing for our tea.
p204
aVWe're going to sing those three wonderful notes: T, E, D.
p205
aVWill you have a go for me?
p206
aa(lp207
VAudience: T, E, D.
p208
aa(lp209
VCharles Hazlewood: Yeah, you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings.
p210
aVShall we try that one again?
p211
aVAnd look, if you're adventurous, you go up the octave.
p212
aVT, E, D.
p213
aa(lp214
VAudience: T, E, D.
p215
aa(lp216
VCH: Once more with vim. (Audience: T, E, D.)
p217
aa(lp218
VThere I am like a bloody windmill again, you see.
p219
aVNow we're going to put that in the context of the music.
p220
aVThe music will start, and then at a signal from me, you will sing that.
p221
aV(Music)
p222
aVOne more time,
p223
aVwith feeling, ladies and gentlemen.
p224
aVYou won't make the key otherwise.
p225
aVWell done, ladies and gentlemen.
p226
aVIt wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir,
p227
aVnot a bad debut at all.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment
p230
aVthat I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you,
p231
aVbecause it is all about changing perceptions,
p232
aVand, indeed, building a new level of trust.
p233
aVThe youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy,
p234
aVwhich as you can imagine,
p235
aVif you don't have an experience of it yourself,
p236
aVis quite a big thing to take on board.
p237
aVBut the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me,
p238
aVaside from her very existence,
p239
aVis that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community
p240
aVthat was hitherto hidden,
p241
aVthe community of disabled people.
p242
aVAnd I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible
p243
aVhow technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt
p244
aVthat disability is no barrier
p245
aVto the highest levels of sporting achievement.
p246
aVOf course there's a grimmer side to that truth,
p247
aVwhich is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large
p248
aVto come to a position of trust,
p249
aVto really believe that disability and sports can go together
p250
aVin a convincing and interesting fashion.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo I find myself asking:
p253
aVwhere is music in all of this?
p254
aVYou can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people,
p255
aVin the U.K. alone,
p256
aVwith massive musical potential.
p257
aVSo I decided to create a platform for that potential.
p258
aVIt's going to be Britain's first ever
p259
aVnational disabled orchestra.
p260
aVIt's called Paraorchestra.
p261
aa(lp262
VI'm going to show you a clip now
p263
aVof the very first improvisation session that we had.
p264
aVIt was a really extraordinary moment.
p265
aVJust me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians.
p266
aVNormally when you improvise \u2014
p267
aVand I do it all the time around the world \u2014
p268
aVthere's this initial period of horror,
p269
aVlike everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring,
p270
aVan awful pregnant silence.
p271
aVThen suddenly, as if by magic, bang! We're all in there
p272
aVand it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything.
p273
aVNo one's listening. No one's trusting.
p274
aVNo one's responding to each other.
p275
aVNow in this room with these four disabled musicians,
p276
aVwithin five minutes
p277
aVa rapt listening, a rapt response
p278
aVand some really insanely beautiful music.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Video) (Music)
p281
aa(lp282
VNicholas:: My name's Nicholas McCarthy.
p283
aVI'm 22, and I'm a left-handed pianist.
p284
aVAnd I was born without my left hand \u2014 right hand.
p285
aVCan I do that one again?
p286
aa(lp287
V(Music)
p288
aa(lp289
VLyn: When I'm making music,
p290
aVI feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane.
p291
aVI become alive.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Music)
p294
aa(lp295
VClarence: I would rather be able to play an instrument again
p296
aVthan walk.
p297
aVThere's so much joy and things
p298
aVI could get from playing an instrument and performing.
p299
aVIt's removed some of my paralysis.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Music)
p302
aa(lp303
V(Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
VCH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today,
p306
aVso you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are.
p307
aVParaorchestra is the name of that project.
p308
aVIf any of you thinks you want to help me in any way
p309
aVto achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point,
p310
aVplease let me know.
p311
aVNow my parting shot
p312
aVcomes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn,
p313
aVwonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century \u2014
p314
aVspent the bulk of his life
p315
aVin the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, along with his orchestra.
p316
aVNow this prince loved his music,
p317
aVbut he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time,
p318
aVwhich is just on the Austro-Hungarian border,
p319
aVa place called Esterhazy \u2014
p320
aVa long way from the big city of Vienna.
p321
aa(lp322
VNow one day in 1772,
p323
aVthe prince decreed that the musicians' families,
p324
aVthe orchestral musicians' families,
p325
aVwere no longer welcome in the castle.
p326
aVThey weren't allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna \u2014
p327
aVas I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days.
p328
aVYou can imagine, the musicians were disconsolate.
p329
aVHaydn remonstrated with the prince, but to no avail.
p330
aVSo given the prince loved his music,
p331
aVHaydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now.
p334
aVAnd you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt.
p335
aVI'm pleased to say, the prince did take the tip
p336
aVfrom the orchestral performance,
p337
aVand the musicians were reunited with their families.
p338
aVBut I think it sums up my talk rather well, this,
p339
aVthat where there is trust,
p340
aVthere is music \u2014 by extension life.
p341
aVWhere there is no trust,
p342
aVthe music quite simply withers away.

conversation with the audience, while in another he&rsquo;ll blend film or sculpture into a piece -- but his goal is always the same: exposing the deep, always-modern joy of the classics. He&#39;s a familiar face on British TV, notably in the 2009 series The Birth of British Music on BBC2. He conducts the BBC Orchestras and guest-conducts orchestras around the world.<br /><br />Together with Mark Dornford-May, he founded a lyric-theatre company in South Africa called Dimpho Di Kopane (which means &quot;combined talents&quot;) after auditioning in the townships and villages of South Africa. Of the 40 members, only three had professional training. They debuted with Bizet&#39;s <em>Carmen</em>, which was later transposed into a movie version called <a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGNmxQJd3AI\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>U-Carmen eKhayelitsha</em></a>, spoken and sung in Xhosa, that was honored at the Berlin Flim Festival. He regularly involves children in his projects and curates his own music festival, Play the Field, on his farm in Somerset. His latest project: the <a href=\\"http://www.paraorchestra.co.uk/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">ParaOrchestra</a>.</p><p>He says: &quot;I have loads of issues with the way classical music is presented.

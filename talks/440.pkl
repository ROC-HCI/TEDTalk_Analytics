VSo, I want to start out with
p5
aVthis beautiful picture from my childhood.
p6
aVI love the science fiction movies.
p7
aVHere it is: "This Island Earth."
p8
aVAnd leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.
p9
aVTwo-and-a-half years in the making.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVI mean, even the creationists give us 6,000,
p12
aVbut Hollywood goes to the chase.
p13
aVAnd in this movie, we see what we think is out there:
p14
aVflying saucers and aliens.
p15
aVEvery world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer,
p16
aVand they move about with great speed. Aliens.
p17
aa(lp18
VWell, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point
p19
aVwhere we got tired of turning on the TV
p20
aVand seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night,
p21
aVand tried to write a counter-argument to it,
p22
aVand put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable,
p23
aVfor a planet to be an Earth, to have a place
p24
aVwhere you could probably get not just life, but complexity,
p25
aVwhich requires a huge amount of evolution,
p26
aVand therefore constancy of conditions.
p27
aVSo, in 2000 we wrote "Rare Earth." In 2003, we then asked,
p28
aVlet's not think about where Earths are in space, but how long has Earth been Earth?
p29
aVIf you go back two billion years,
p30
aVyou're not on an Earth-like planet any more.
p31
aVWhat we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time.
p32
aa(lp33
VWell, "Rare Earth" actually
p34
aVtaught me an awful lot about meeting the public.
p35
aVRight after, I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention,
p36
aVand with all great earnestness walked in.
p37
aVDavid Brin was going to debate me on this,
p38
aVand as I walked in, the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily.
p39
aVI had a girl who came up who said, "My dad says you're the devil."
p40
aVYou cannot take people's aliens away from them
p41
aVand expect to be anybody's friends.
p42
aVWell, the second part of that, soon after \u2014
p43
aVand I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience,
p44
aVand I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."
p45
aVAnd Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me,
p46
aVand she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist."
p47
aVIt was, "It burns! It burns!"
p48
aVBecause SETI doesn't want to hear this.
p49
aVSETI wants there to be stuff out there.
p50
aVI really applaud the SETI efforts, but we have not heard anything yet.
p51
aVAnd I really do think we have to start thinking
p52
aVabout what's a good planet and what isn't.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that,
p55
aVeven if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?
p56
aVBecause this was a slide that was passed
p57
aVbetween the two major intelligences on Earth \u2014 a Mac to a PC \u2014
p58
aVand it can't even get the letters right \u2014
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aV\u2014 so how are we going to talk to the aliens?
p61
aVAnd if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up,
p62
aVand you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
p63
aVand then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?
p64
aVI mean, there we are.
p65
aa(lp66
VOur planet is a good planet because it can keep water.
p67
aVMars is a bad planet, but it's still good enough for us to go there
p68
aVand to live on its surface if we're protected.
p69
aVBut Venus is a very bad \u2014 the worst \u2014 planet.
p70
aVEven though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history
p71
aVit may very well have harbored Earth-like life,
p72
aVit soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse \u2014
p73
aVthat's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface \u2014
p74
aVbecause of rampant carbon dioxide.
p75
aa(lp76
VWell, we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict
p77
aVwhat's going to happen to our particular planet.
p78
aVWe are right now in the beautiful Oreo
p79
aVof existence \u2014 of at least life on Planet Earth \u2014
p80
aVfollowing the first horrible microbial age.
p81
aVIn the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps,
p82
aVcomplexity arose,
p83
aVand from what we can tell, we're halfway through.
p84
aVWe have as much time for animals to exist on this planet
p85
aVas they have been here now,
p86
aVtill we hit the second microbial age.
p87
aVAnd that will happen, paradoxically \u2014
p88
aVeverything you hear about global warming \u2014
p89
aVwhen we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million,
p90
aVwe are no longer going to have to have plants
p91
aVthat are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals.
p92
aVSo, after that we probably have seven billion years.
p93
aVThe Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness,
p94
aVand finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started,
p95
aVthe Earth is consumed by a large Sun,
p96
aVand this is what's left.
p97
aVSo, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age,
p98
aVand we are in its golden summer age right now.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut there's two fates to everything, isn't there?
p101
aVNow, a lot of you are going to die of old age,
p102
aVbut some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.
p103
aVAnd that's the fate of a planet, too.
p104
aVEarth, if we're lucky enough \u2014 if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp,
p105
aVor gets blasted by some supernova nearby
p106
aVin the next seven billion years \u2014 we'll find under your feet.
p107
aVBut what about accidental death?
p108
aVWell, paleontologists for the last 200 years
p109
aVhave been charting death. It's strange \u2014
p110
aVextinction as a concept wasn't even thought about
p111
aVuntil Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon.
p112
aVHe couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet,
p113
aVand he said, Aha! It's extinct.
p114
aVAnd very soon after, the fossil record started yielding
p115
aVa very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been
p116
aVsince complex life really began to leave
p117
aVa very interesting fossil record.
p118
aVIn that complex record of fossils,
p119
aVthere were times when lots of stuff
p120
aVseemed to be dying out very quickly,
p121
aVand the father/mother geologists
p122
aVcalled these "mass extinctions."
p123
aa(lp124
VAll along it was thought to be either an act of God
p125
aVor perhaps long, slow climate change,
p126
aVand that really changed in 1980,
p127
aVin this rocky outcrop near Gubbio,
p128
aVwhere Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out
p129
aVwhat was the time difference between these white rocks,
p130
aVwhich held creatures of the Cretaceous period,
p131
aVand the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils.
p132
aVHow long did it take to go from one system to the next?
p133
aVAnd what they found was something unexpected.
p134
aVThey found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer,
p135
aVand that clay layer \u2014 this very thin red layer here \u2014
p136
aVis filled with iridium.
p137
aVAnd not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules,
p138
aVand it's filled with quartz grains
p139
aVthat have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, in this slide the white is chalk,
p142
aVand this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean.
p143
aVThe chalk itself's composed by plankton
p144
aVwhich has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor,
p145
aVso that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff,
p146
aVand then you have that millimeter-thick red layer,
p147
aVand then you have black rock.
p148
aVAnd the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom
p149
aVin the absence of plankton.
p150
aVAnd that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe,
p151
aVbecause that's what this was, of course. This is the famous K-T.
p152
aVA 10-kilometer body hit the planet.
p153
aVThe effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet,
p154
aVand we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs,
p155
aVthe death of these beautiful ammonites,
p156
aVLeconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here,
p157
aVand so much else.
p158
aa(lp159
VI mean, it must be true,
p160
aVbecause we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time,
p161
aVand this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000,
p162
aVtotally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes.
p163
aVPrior to that, uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm:
p164
aVthe fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past,
p165
aVthere are present-day processes that will explain it.
p166
aVBut we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact,
p167
aVso this is a type of neo-catastrophism,
p168
aVand it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment
p169
aVto finally come to grips: yes, we were hit;
p170
aVand yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction.
p171
aa(lp172
VWell, there are five major mass extinctions
p173
aVover the last 500 million years, called the Big Five.
p174
aVThey range from 450 million years ago
p175
aVto the last, the K-T, number four,
p176
aVbut the biggest of all was the P, or the Permian extinction,
p177
aVsometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions.
p178
aVAnd every one of these has been subsequently blamed
p179
aVon large-body impact.
p180
aVBut is this true?
p181
aa(lp182
VThe most recent, the Permian, was thought to have been an impact
p183
aVbecause of this beautiful structure on the right.
p184
aVThis is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.
p185
aVBecause it looks like those terrible geodesic domes
p186
aVof my late beloved '60s,
p187
aVthey're called "buckyballs."
p188
aVThis evidence was used to suggest
p189
aVthat at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us.
p190
aVAnd when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs,
p191
aVand it captures bits of the comet.
p192
aVHelium-3: very rare on the surface of the Earth, very common in space.
p193
aa(lp194
VBut is this true?
p195
aVIn 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years,
p196
aVI moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year
p197
aVin the great Karoo desert.
p198
aVI was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa
p199
aVinto the new South Africa as I went year by year.
p200
aVAnd I worked on this Permian extinction,
p201
aVcamping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time.
p202
aVAnd the fossils are extraordinary.
p203
aVYou know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.
p204
aVThese are mammal-like reptiles.
p205
aVThey are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.
p206
aVThis is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon.
p207
aVThat's an 18-inch long skull of an animal
p208
aVthat was probably seven or eight feet, sprawled like a lizard,
p209
aVprobably had a head like a lion.
p210
aVThis is the top carnivore, the T-Rex of its time.
p211
aVBut there's lots of stuff.
p212
aVThis is my poor son, Patrick.
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aVThis is called paleontological child abuse.
p215
aVHold still, you're the scale.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VThere was big stuff back then.
p219
aVFifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.
p220
aVThe age of mammals had well and truly started
p221
aV250 million years ago ...
p222
aV... and then a catastrophe happened.
p223
aVAnd what happens next is the age of dinosaurs.
p224
aVIt was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did.
p225
aVNow, luckily,
p226
aVthis Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here:
p227
aVthis is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture \u2014
p228
aVthere's a pen for scale; it's really tiny \u2014
p229
aVthis is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished.
p230
aVYou can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.
p231
aVIf that does not survive, I'm not the thing giving this talk.
p232
aVSomething else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here;
p233
aVthere are no mammals. It's that close; one species ekes through.
p234
aa(lp235
VWell, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't?
p236
aVHere's sort of the end of that 10 years of work.
p237
aVThe ranges of stuff \u2014 the red line is the mass extinction.
p238
aVBut we've got survivors and things that get through,
p239
aVand it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods.
p240
aVWarm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time.
p241
aVThe survivors that do get through
p242
aVproduce this world of crocodile-like creatures.
p243
aVThere's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty,
p244
aVswampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes.
p245
aVAnd there they would hide for 160 million years,
p246
aVuntil liberated by that K-T asteroid.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo, if not impact, what?
p249
aVAnd the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again,
p250
aVto the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age,
p251
aVand the microbes are still out there.
p252
aVThey hate we animals.
p253
aVThey really want their world back.
p254
aVAnd they've tried over and over and over again.
p255
aVThis suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions
p256
aVbecause it did is inherently anti-Gaian.
p257
aVThis whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself \u2014
p258
aVanybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles
p259
aVbelieving in the Gaia theory? No.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo, I really suspect there's an alternative,
p262
aVand that life does actually try to do itself in \u2014
p263
aVnot consciously, but just because it does.
p264
aVAnd here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.
p265
aVThere are microbes which, through their metabolism,
p266
aVproduce hydrogen sulfide,
p267
aVand they do so in large amounts.
p268
aVHydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.
p269
aVAs small as 200 parts per million will kill you.
p270
aVYou only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places \u2014 some lakes \u2014
p271
aVand get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.
p272
aVIt turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes
p273
aVwhich have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide,
p274
aVand we can detect their presence today \u2014 we can see them \u2014
p275
aVbut we can also detect their presence in the past.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd the last three years have seen
p278
aVan enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field.
p279
aVI am almost extinct \u2014
p280
aVI'm a paleontologist who collects fossils.
p281
aVBut the new wave of paleontologists \u2014 my graduate students \u2014
p282
aVcollect biomarkers.
p283
aVThey take the sediment itself, they extract the oil from it,
p284
aVand from that they can produce compounds
p285
aVwhich turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.
p286
aVIt's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment
p287
aVand last the hundreds of millions of years necessary,
p288
aVand be extracted and tell us who was there.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd we know who was there. At the end of the Permian,
p291
aVat many of these mass extinction boundaries,
p292
aVthis is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.
p293
aVIt can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen,
p294
aVand is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide \u2014
p295
aVenough, for instance, to come out of solution.
p296
aVThis led Lee Kump, and others from Penn State and my group,
p297
aVto propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis:
p298
aVmany of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen,
p299
aVby high CO2. And the worst effect of global warming, it turns out:
p300
aVhydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans.
p301
aa(lp302
VWell, what's the source of this?
p303
aVIn this particular case, the source over and over has been flood basalts.
p304
aVThis is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it.
p305
aVAnd each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb;
p306
aVactually, the effects are even worse.
p307
aVThis is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface,
p308
aVspreads out over the surface of the planet.
p309
aVWell, it's not the lava that kills anything,
p310
aVit's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it.
p311
aVThis isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.
p312
aVBut carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo, these are new data Rob Berner and I \u2014 from Yale \u2014 put together,
p315
aVand what we try to do now is
p316
aVtrack the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record \u2014
p317
aVand we can do this from a variety of means \u2014
p318
aVand put all the red lines here,
p319
aVwhen these \u2014 what I call greenhouse mass extinctions \u2014 took place.
p320
aVAnd there's two things that are really evident here to me,
p321
aVis that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up.
p322
aVBut the second thing that's not shown on here:
p323
aVthe Earth has never had any ice on it
p324
aVwhen we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.
p325
aVWe are at 380 and climbing.
p326
aVWe should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most,
p327
aVbut my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years.
p328
aVSo, there goes the ice caps,
p329
aVand there comes 240 feet of sea level rise.
p330
aVI live in a view house now;
p331
aVI'm going to have waterfront.
p332
aa(lp333
VAll right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple.
p334
aVAnd we think this is the reason that complexity took so long
p335
aVto take place on planet Earth.
p336
aVWe had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period.
p337
aVThey stop complex life from existing.
p338
aVWe know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.
p339
aVAnd I throw this slide in \u2014 this is me, actually, two months ago \u2014
p340
aVand I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.
p341
aVIt's been on this planet since the animals first started \u2014 500 million years.
p342
aVThis is a tracking experiment, and any of you scuba divers,
p343
aVif you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever,
p344
aVthis is off the Great Barrier Reef.
p345
aVAnd as we speak now,
p346
aVthese nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us.
p347
aa(lp348
VBut the thing about this is that every once in a while
p349
aVwe divers can run into trouble,
p350
aVso I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.
p351
aVThis is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps.
p352
aVWe pulled it up; up it comes. So, it's out there with me at night.
p353
aVSo, I'm swimming along, and it takes off my leg.
p354
aVI'm 80 miles from shore, what's going to happen to me?
p355
aVWell now, I die.
p356
aVFive years from now, this is what I hope happens to me:
p357
aVI'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask:
p358
aV80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.
p359
aVI'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower
p360
aVand I could be taken to a critical care hospital.
p361
aVAnd the reason I could do that is because we mammals
p362
aVhave gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events,
p363
aVand our bodies have adapted.
p364
aVAnd we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough.
p365
aa(lp366
VThis is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA.
p367
aVTried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.
p368
aVHe bleeds out pigs.
p369
aVHe puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide \u2014
p370
aVthe same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions \u2014
p371
aVand he turns a mammal into a reptile.
p372
aV"I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles
p373
aVhaving undergone a series of exposures to H2S."
p374
aVI got this email from him two years ago;
p375
aVhe said, "I think I've got an answer to some of your questions."
p376
aVSo, he now has taken mice down
p377
aVfor as many as four hours, sometimes six hours,
p378
aVand these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.
p379
aVOn the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through \u2014
p380
aVthe dotted line, the temperatures.
p381
aVSo, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade,
p382
aVand down it goes, down it goes.
p383
aVSix hours later, up goes the temperature.
p384
aVNow, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide
p385
aVin this solid graph,
p386
aVand look what happens to its temperature.
p387
aVIts temperature drops.
p388
aVIt goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35,
p389
aVand comes out of this perfectly fine.
p390
aa(lp391
VHere is a way we can get people to critical care.
p392
aVHere's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care.
p393
aVNow, you're all thinking, yeah, what about the brain tissue?
p394
aVAnd so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.
p395
aVYou're in an accident. You've got two choices:
p396
aVyou're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide
p397
aVand, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.
p398
aVWhat are you going to do?
p399
aVDo we all have to have a little button saying, Let me die?
p400
aVThis is coming towards us,
p401
aVand I think this is going to be a revolution.
p402
aVWe're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it.
p403
aa(lp404
VThe new view of mass extinctions is, yes, we were hit,
p405
aVand, yes, we have to think about the long term,
p406
aVbecause we will get hit again.
p407
aVBut there's a far worse danger confronting us.
p408
aVWe can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world.
p409
aVGive us a few millennia \u2014
p410
aVand we humans should last those few millennia \u2014
p411
aVwill it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again.
p412
aVHow many of us flew here?
p413
aVHow many of us have gone through
p414
aVour entire Kyoto quota
p415
aVjust for flying this year?
p416
aVHow many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it.
p417
aVWe have a huge problem facing us as a species.
p418
aVWe have to beat this.
p419
aVI want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you.

VChris Anderson: I've just got one question for you, Peter.
p424
aVAm I understanding you right, that what you're saying here
p425
aVis that we have in our own bodies
p426
aVa biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide
p427
aVthat in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions
p428
aVdue to climate change?
p429
aa(lp430
VPeter Ward: Yeah, every single cell in us
p431
aVcan produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises.
p432
aVThis is what Roth has found out.
p433
aVSo, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?
p434
aVDoes it leave a signal in bone or in plant?
p435
aVAnd we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect
p436
aVhow many of these have happened in the past.
p437
aa(lp438
VCA: It's simultaneously
p439

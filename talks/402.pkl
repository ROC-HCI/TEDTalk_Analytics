VWelcome to 10,000 feet.
p5
aVLet me explain why we are here
p6
aVand why some of you have a pine cone close to you.
p7
aVOnce upon a time, I did a book called "How Buildings Learn."
p8
aVToday's event you might call "How Mountains Teach."
p9
aVA little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to
p10
aVhack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking
p11
aVto be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare \u2014
p12
aVor in some cases, non-existent.
p13
aVIt would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking
p14
aVof the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know,
p15
aVnext 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years \u2014
p16
aVbasically civilization's story so far.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.
p19
aVIt's an incubator for about a dozen projects,
p20
aVall having to do with continuity over the long term.
p21
aVOur core project is a rather ambitious folly \u2014
p22
aVI suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock
p23
aVthat can really keep good time for that long a period.
p24
aVAnd the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious.
p25
aVGo to the clock. And what we have here is something
p26
aVmany of you saw here three years ago.
p27
aVIt's the first working prototype of the clock.
p28
aVIt's about nine feet high.
p29
aVDesigned by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London,
p30
aVand is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo the design problem for today is going to be,
p33
aVhow do you house an eventual monumental clock like this
p34
aVso it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries?
p35
aVWell, this was the first solution.
p36
aVAlexander Rose came up with this idea
p37
aVof a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps.
p38
aVAnd it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking
p39
aVabout, what does deep time do to a building?
p40
aVWell, this is what deep time does to a building.
p41
aVThis is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old,
p42
aVand look what happened to it.
p43
aVHere's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever,
p44
aVbecause they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.
p45
aVAnd now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.
p46
aVThat's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable.
p47
aVEven the most durable and intactable buildings,
p48
aVlike the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close.
p49
aVThey've been looted inside and out.
p50
aVAnd they're built to protect things but they don't protect things.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building,
p53
aVwhere can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground.
p54
aVHow about underground with a view?
p55
aVUnderground in a place that's really solid.
p56
aVSo the obvious answer was, we need a mountain.
p57
aVYou don't want just any mountain.
p58
aVYou need absolutely the right mountain
p59
aVif you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years.
p60
aVSo here's an image of the long view of the search problem.
p61
aVAnd we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain,
p62
aVso we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest.
p63
aVWe looked at mesas in New Mexico.
p64
aVWe were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona.
p65
aa(lp66
VThen Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service,
p67
aVled us to Eastern Nevada,
p68
aVto America's newest and oldest national park,
p69
aVwhich is called Great Basin National Park.
p70
aVIt's right on the eastern border of Nevada.
p71
aVIt's the highest range in the state \u2014 over 13,000 feet.
p72
aVAnd you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep,
p73
aVand on the right it's gentle.
p74
aVThis place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city.
p75
aVIt's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.
p76
aVAnd it's \u2014 the only thing that goes by is what's called
p77
aVAmerica's loneliest highway, U.S. 50.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, inside the yellow line here, on the right is \u2014 that's all national park.
p80
aVInside the green line is national forest.
p81
aVAnd then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land.
p82
aVNow, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle,
p83
aVthis vertical, was available because it was private land.
p84
aVAnd thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here,
p85
aVwho started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land.
p86
aVAnd now let's look at the grand truth of what's there.
p87
aa(lp88
VWe're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment
p89
aVof Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.
p90
aVThose white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone.
p91
aVThat's a 2,000-foot thick formation,
p92
aVand it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.
p93
aVIt would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike
p94
aVto get up to where the clock is.
p95
aVSo last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors
p96
aVand advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain
p97
aVto explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain,
p98
aVand two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem.
p101
aVHe has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.
p102
aVIt's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.
p103
aVIt starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind
p104
aVof the goal at the end of the journey.
p105
aVIn this case it might well be an image of the clock.
p106
aVThen there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition
p107
aVfrom ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest.
p108
aVThen \u2014 this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth.
p109
aVThe labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone,
p110
aVit's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented,
p111
aVmaybe you get scared \u2014 but you have to go through it
p112
aVif you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.
p113
aVThen there should always be in sight the draw \u2014
p114
aVa kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth
p115
aVto finish the process of getting there.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow Brian Eno, who's been in the thick of the Long Now process,
p118
aVspent two years making a C.D. called "January 7003,"
p119
aVand it's "Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now."
p120
aVBased on \u2014 parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed,
p121
aVso that a peal of 10 bells
p122
aVmakes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.
p123
aVThe Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number.
p124
aVAnd in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.
p125
aVJanuary 7003. There it is.
p126
aa(lp127
VOK, back to Danny's list.
p128
aVNumber five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax.
p129
aVThe goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to.
p130
aVAnd then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff.
p131
aVSomething you didn't expect that caps what you did expect.
p132
aVThen there's the return.
p133
aVYou've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world,
p134
aVso you have time to assimilate what you've learned.
p135
aVAnd then, how about a memento? Number seven.
p136
aVAt the end of it there's something physical,
p137
aVa kind of reward that you take away.
p138
aVIt might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain.
p139
aVSomething that's just yours.
p140
aVHow do you study a mountain
p141
aVfor the kinds of things we're talking about?
p142
aVThis is not a normal building project.
p143
aVWhat do you look for?
p144
aVWhat are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions?
p145
aa(lp146
VStart with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here,
p147
aVthat's national park. That's sacrosanct \u2014
p148
aVyou can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest.
p149
aVThere's possibilities. The borders are important.
p150
aVOther elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.
p151
aVAnd especially trees. Look at those things up on top there.
p152
aVIt turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines.
p153
aVThey're the world's oldest living thing.
p154
aVPeople think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true.
p155
aVThere are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.
p156
aVThe wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.
p157
aVSo when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain,
p158
aVsome of them go back 10,000 years.
p159
aVThe stone itself is absolutely beautiful,
p160
aVsculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there.
p161
aVWe had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona
p162
aVjoin us on the expedition.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, if you guys have a pine cone handy,
p165
aVnow's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end.
p166
aVThat's interesting.
p167
aVYou'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience.
p168
aVHere's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest
p169
aVon Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones
p170
aVwas discovered, led by a theory.
p171
aVEdmund Schulman in the 1950s
p172
aVhad been studying trees under great stress at Timberline,
p173
aVand came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine
p174
aVcalled, "Longevity under Adversity in Conifers."
p175
aVAnd then, based on that principle, he started looking around
p176
aVat the various trees at Timberline,
p177
aVand realized that the bristlecone pines \u2014
p178
aVhe found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.
p179
aVLongevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right.
p180
aa(lp181
VOK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property
p182
aVwhen we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines.
p183
aVBecause the owner said, "There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain."
p184
aVAnd we said, "Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero?
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property
p189
aVand take a hell of a tax deduction.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VAll you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars."
p194
aa(lp195
VWell, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth,
p196
aVand by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay,
p197
aVwe were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.
p198
aVThis is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it.
p199
aVIt's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten,
p200
aVa little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.
p201
aVBut it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line,
p202
aVdue east into the range, into very interesting territory \u2014 except that,
p203
aVas you'll see when we go inside in a minute,
p204
aVwe were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale.
p205
aVAnd shale is not quite completely competent rock.
p206
aVCompetent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.
p207
aVThe shale would like some shoring,
p208
aVand so parts of it are caved in in there.
p209
aa(lp210
VThat's Ben Roberts from \u2014 he's the bat specialist from the National Park.
p211
aVBut there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus
p212
aVon some of the collapsed timbers.
p213
aVOK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property,
p214
aVand it dates back to 1870.
p215
aVThat's what the property was originally built around \u2014
p216
aVit was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.
p217
aVIn fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada,
p218
aVand it ran year round.
p219
aVYou can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet.
p220
aVYou may recognize a couple of the miners there.
p221
aVThere's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena,
p222
aVwhich is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.
p223
aVThey both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine.
p224
aa(lp225
VIt's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon.
p226
aVAnd Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people
p227
aVfrom the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep.
p228
aVAnd they also found four species of bats in there.
p229
aVNow, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain.
p230
aVThey don't quite, but it's something to think about.
p231
aVThey don't quite meet.
p232
aVLet's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather.
p233
aVWay more interesting than Monterey even today.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were.
p236
aVWoke up in the morning \u2014 the mountain was covered with snow.
p237
aVThat was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again,
p238
aVthanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there.
p239
aVAnd it's a pretty interesting scene.
p240
aVThis is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin,
p241
aVwho's the regional head of the National Forest Service,
p242
aVand they gave us the temporary use permit to be there.
p243
aVWe want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually \u2014
p244
aV10,000-year temporary use permit.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VThe weather station's pretty interesting.
p249
aVKurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station.
p250
aVIt runs on solar, and it sends a signal with that antenna
p251
aVand bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere
p252
aVto a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down
p253
aVand then sent through landlines to San Francisco,
p254
aVwhere we put the data in real time up on our website.
p255
aVAnd there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington.
p256
aVLet's go to approaches.
p257
aVAs it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington,
p258
aVjust a few old mining roads like this,
p259
aVso you have to bushwhack everywhere.
p260
aVBut there's no bears, and there's no poison oak,
p261
aVand there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time.
p262
aVYou can hike for days and not encounter anybody.
p263
aa(lp264
VWell, here's a potential approach.
p265
aVYou need to come up the Lincoln Canyon.
p266
aVIt's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs,
p267
aVand it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom,
p268
aVuntil you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem.
p269
aVSo you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.
p270
aVAnother possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.
p271
aVYou can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain.
p272
aVAnd from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley,
p273
aVit's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest
p274
aVthrough that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.
p275
aVAnd you can carry right on up through meadows
p276
aVand steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet,
p277
aVwhere there's a bit of a problem.
p278
aa(lp279
VNow, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition,
p280
aV"Make the clock inaccessible.
p281
aVThe harder it is to get to, the more people will value it."
p282
aVAnd check \u2014 those are 600-foot vertical walls there.
p283
aVSo Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route,
p284
aVand he started over here on the left from his pickup truck
p285
aVat 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain.
p286
aVNow, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down \u2014
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
Vbut your emotional affect goes up,
p291
aVwhich is great for having a mythic experience,
p292
aVwhether you want to or not.
p293
aVIn fact, Danny Hillis can estimate altitude
p294
aVby how much math he can't do in his head.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VNow, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander
p299
aVwhen he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote,
p300
aV"There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways."
p301
aVNow, he's a rock climber, but you know, he's our executive director.
p302
aVI don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs.
p303
aVI'm saying, "Be careful, be careful, be careful."
p304
aVThen he starts going up, and the next thing I hear is,
p305
aV"I'm half-way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up 60 degrees.
p306
aVIt's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien."
p307
aVAnd I'm going, "Careful, careful. Please be careful."
p308
aVAnd then, of course, the next thing I hear is,
p309
aV"I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here."
p310
aVAnd he dashed across the top of the mountains.
p311
aa(lp312
VIn fact, there he is. That's Alexander Rose.
p313
aVFirst ascent of the western face to Mount Washington,
p314
aVand a solo ascent at that.
p315
aVThis discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs
p316
aVand what to do with them.
p317
aVWe realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered.
p318
aVHow about Zander's Crevice? No.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VSo we finally decided on Alexander's Siq.
p323
aVZander's Siq is named after \u2014 some of you have been to Petra,
p324
aVthere's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra
p325
aVcalled the Siq, and so this is the Siq.
p326
aVAnd it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image,
p327
aVand I'm not sure you can.
p328
aVOnly when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there,
p329
aVand that brings it out.
p330
aa(lp331
VNow, Danny and I were up at this same area one day,
p332
aVand Danny looked over to the right
p333
aVand noticed something halfway up the cliffs,
p334
aVwhich is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it,
p335
aVand supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain
p336
aVcould come out onto that shelf and look down at the view.
p337
aVAnd the people toiling up the mountain could see them,
p338
aVthese tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff.
p339
aVHow did they get there? Do I have to do that?
p340
aVAnd so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.
p341
aVYou can get another angle on Danny's porch
p342
aVby going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there.
p343
aVAnd you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate
p344
aVby a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day,
p345
aVand the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger
p346
aVwhich resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate.
p347
aVSo even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on,
p348
aVthe clock will keep perfectly good time.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo here we're looking from the south, look north.
p351
aVThis is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs,
p352
aVthat's some of the Long Now land in those trees.
p353
aVAnd if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of
p354
aVwhat the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain.
p355
aVThat's the long view. That's 80 miles to the horizon.
p356
aVAnd that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs.
p357
aVThat's a different place to be. It's 11,400 feet and it's exquisite.
p358
aVNow, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs,
p359
aVit's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot,
p360
aVthere is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq.
p361
aVThat's what it looks like looking down it.
p362
aVWe should probably put in a rail or something.
p363
aVOver on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see.
p364
aVAnd that's not snow \u2014 that's what the white limestone looks like.
p365
aVYou also see there a bighorn sheep.
p366
aVTheir herd was reintroduced from Wyoming.
p367
aVAnd they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble.
p368
aa(lp369
VThis is Danny Hillis, and he's figuring out a design problem.
p370
aVhe's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land
p371
aVwould appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain.
p372
aVbecause the real peak is hidden around the corner.
p373
aVThis is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest.
p374
aVAnd as it turned out the answer is, yes,
p375
aVthat is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak,
p376
aVand that might be conjured with.
p377
aVWe gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this.
p378
aVOne is the experience of the mountain.
p379
aVAnother is the experience in the mountain.
p380
aVAnd the third is the experience from the mountain,
p381
aVwhich is really dominated by the view shed
p382
aVof the spring valley there behind Danny,
p383
aVand if you look off to the right, out there,
p384
aV15 miles across to the Schell Creek range.

VIn the front, there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains
p387
aVusing the water from the mountains.
p388
aVIn fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air.
p389
aVOne of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch,
p390
aVand I'll take you there for a minute.
p391
aVIt's a very nice ranch.
p392
aVAlfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham,
p393
aVand it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work.
p394
aVAnd most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going.
p395
aVThis is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range.
p396
aVAnd if you go out to that line of trees at the far end,
p397
aVyou'll see what the valley used to look like.
p398
aVThis is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.
p399
aa(lp400
VAnd a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see
p401
aVif it might be possible to buy up the whole valley,
p402
aVbecause those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres
p403
aVdominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on,
p404
aVand there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing
p405
aVfor five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition,
p406
aVand somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park,
p407
aVand it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell.
p408
aa(lp409
VOK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.
p410
aVThe clock experience should be profound,
p411
aVbut from the outside it should be invisible.
p412
aVNow, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave.
p413
aVIt's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside?
p414
aVYou excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it.
p415
aVAnd then you could have an entrance
p416
aVwhich was very rough and narrow as you first went in,
p417
aVthat gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite.
p418
aVAnd this stone takes a perfect polish.
p419
aVYou'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there
p420
aVeventually leading to the 10,000 year clock.
p421
aa(lp422
VAnd it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation
p423
aVof the basic structure of the mountain,
p424
aVand you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside.
p425
aVThis is architecture not made by building,
p426
aVbut by what you very carefully take away.
p427
aVSo that's what the mountain taught us.
p428
aVMost of the amazingness of the clock
p429
aVwe can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.
p430
aVAll we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them.
p431
aVIt's not a clock in a mountain \u2014 it's a mountain clock.
p432
aVNow, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying
p433
aVfor what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything.
p434
aVThey say, "pin peya obe" \u2014 welcome to the mountain.
p435
aa(lp436
VThank you.
p437
aa(lp438

VGood afternoon.
p5
aVI am not a farmer.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI'm not. I'm a parent, I'm a resident and I'm a teacher.
p10
aVAnd this is my world.
p11
aVAnd along the way I've started noticing \u2014
p12
aVI'm on my third generation of kids \u2014
p13
aVthat they're getting bigger.
p14
aVThey're getting sicker.
p15
aVIn addition to these complexities,
p16
aVI just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see
p17
aVwho are labeled learning disabled would not have been
p18
aVhad they had proper prenatal nutrition.
p19
aa(lp20
VThe realities of my community are simple. They look like this.
p21
aVKids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.
p22
aVAnd as jobs continue to leave my community,
p23
aVand energy continues to come in, be exported in,
p24
aVit's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.
p25
aVBut I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet,
p26
aVso I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm
p27
aVthat I'm hoping to share with you all today.
p28
aVAnd with that note, I come to you with this belief
p29
aVthat kids should not have to leave their communities
p30
aVto live, learn and earn in a better one.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo I'm here to tell you a story about me
p33
aVand this wall that I met outside, which I'm now bringing inside.
p34
aVAnd it starts with three people.
p35
aVThe crazy teacher \u2014 that's me on the left,
p36
aVI dress up pretty, thank you, my wife, I love you for getting a good suit \u2014
p37
aVmy passionate borough president
p38
aVand a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies
p39
aVwho helped me with my class
p40
aVand helped me get involved with this patented technology.
p41
aVBut it all starts with seeds in classrooms,
p42
aVin my place, which looks like this.
p43
aVAnd I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp.
p44
aVAnd that's really what this is all about.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd it starts with incredible kids like this,
p47
aVwho come early and stay late.
p48
aVAll of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners,
p49
aVmost come with a lot of handicaps,
p50
aVmost are homeless and many are in foster care.
p51
aVAlmost all of my kids live below poverty.
p52
aVBut with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom,
p53
aVand this is what it looks like in my classroom.
p54
aVAnd you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.
p55
aVAnd then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut again, I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher.
p58
aVAnd I don't like weeding, and I don't like back-breaking labor.
p59
aVSo I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success
p60
aVinto something small, like this,
p61
aVand bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it,
p62
aVkids who didn't want to be outside could do it,
p63
aVand everyone could have access.
p64
aVSo I called George Irwin, and what do you know?
p65
aVHe came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.
p66
aVAnd what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences,
p67
aVprivate-based learning.
p68
aVAnd lo and behold, we gave birth to
p69
aVthe first edible wall in New York City.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo if you're hungry, get up and eat.
p72
aVYou can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time.
p73
aVOkay? But we were just getting started,
p74
aVthe kids loved the technology,
p75
aVso we called up George and we said, "We gotta learn more!"
p76
aVNow, Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much, we no longer need work permits,
p77
aVwhich comes with slices and bonded contractors \u2014 we're available for you \u2014
p78
aa(lp79
VWe decided to go to Boston.
p80
aVAnd my kids, from the poorest congressional district in America,
p81
aVbecame the first to install a green wall,
p82
aVdesigned by a computer, with real-live learning tools,
p83
aV21 stories up \u2014 if you're going to go visit it,
p84
aVit's on top of the John Hancock building.
p85
aVBut closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools
p86
aVthat look like this with lighting like that,
p87
aVreal LED stuff, 21st-century technology.
p88
aVAnd what do you know? We made 21st century money,
p89
aVand that was groundbreaking. Wow!
p90
aa(lp91
VThis is my harvest, people.
p92
aVAnd what do you do with this food? You cook it!
p93
aVAnd those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce,
p94
aVwith plastic forks, and we get it into the cafeteria,
p95
aVand we grow stuff and we feed our teachers.
p96
aVAnd that is the youngest nationally certified
p97
aVworkforce in America with our Bronx Borough President.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you,
p100
aVand they invited us to the Hamptons.
p101
aVSo I call this "from South Bronx to Southampton."
p102
aVAnd we started putting in roofs that look like this,
p103
aVand we came in from destitute neighborhoods
p104
aVto start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.
p105
aVAnd so we got invited back this past summer,
p106
aVand we actually moved into the Hamptons,
p107
aVpayed 3,500 dollars a week for a house, and we learned how to surf.
p108
aVAnd when you can do stuff like this \u2014
p109
aVThese are my kids putting in this technology,
p110
aVand when you can build a roof that looks like that
p111
aVon a house that looks like that
p112
aVwith sedum that looks like this,
p113
aVthis is the new green graffiti.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo, you may wonder what does a wall like this
p116
aVreally do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets?
p117
aVOkay, I'm going to tell you what it does.
p118
aVIt gets me to meet incredible contractors like this,
p119
aVJim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.
p120
aVAnd this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.
p121
aVBecause Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers,
p122
aVreally had the skills he needed to build affordable housing
p123
aVfor New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.
p124
aVAnd this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, if you're like me, you live in a building, there are seven guys
p127
aVout of work looking to manage a million dollars.
p128
aVI don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed
p129
aVor, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months
p130
aVfor an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.
p131
aVThat's the beauty of this economy.
p132
aVBut my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade.
p133
aVAnd that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account.
p134
aVThis immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM.
p135
aVAnd this is the true triple bottom line,
p136
aVbecause we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute
p137
aVand turn them into something like this with interiors like this.
p138
aa(lp139
VWow! People noticed. And notice they did.
p140
aVSo CNN called, and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market.
p141
aVAnd then when Rockefeller Center said, NBC,
p142
aVcould you put this thing up on the walls? We were delighted.
p143
aVBut this, I show you, when kids from the poorest congressional district in America
p144
aVcan build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall,
p145
aVdesign it, plant it and install it in the heart of New York City,
p146
aVthat's a true "sí se puede" moment.
p147
aVReally scholastic, if you ask me.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut this is not a Getty image.
p150
aVThat's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President,
p151
aVaddressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse,
p152
aVmaking them feel a part of it.
p153
aVThat's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder,
p154
aVcoming to my classroom to make my kids feel important.
p155
aVAnd when the Bronx Borough President shows up
p156
aVand the State Senator comes to our class,
p157
aVbelieve you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now.
p158
aVWe are poised, ready, willing and able
p159
aVto export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined.
p160
aVAnd when the local senator gets on the scale in public
p161
aVand says he's got to lose weight, so do I!
p162
aVAnd I tell you what, I'm doing it and so are the kids.
p163
aa(lp164
VOkay? And then celebrities started.
p165
aVProduce Pete can't believe what we grow.
p166
aVLorna Sass came and donated books.
p167
aVOkay? We're feeding seniors.
p168
aVAnd when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx,
p169
aVso did the international community.
p170
aVAnd my kids in the South Bronx were repped in
p171
aVthe first international green roof conference.
p172
aVAnd that's just great.
p173
aa(lp174
VExcept what about locally?
p175
aVWell, we met this woman, Avis Richards, with the Ground Up Campaign.
p176
aVUnbelievable! Through her, my kids,
p177
aVthe most disenfranchised and marginalized,
p178
aVwere able to roll out 100 gardens to New York City public schools.
p179
aVThat's triple bottom line! Okay?
p180
aa(lp181
VA year ago today, I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine.
p182
aVI thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York
p183
aVmade sense, especially when the resources were free.
p184
aVSo thank you all and I love them.
p185
aVThey introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health,
p186
aVagain, free resources, don't waste them.
p187
aVAnd what do you know? Six months later,
p188
aVmy school and my kids were awarded the first ever
p189
aVhigh school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment.
p190
aVThe greenest class in New York City.
p191
aVBut more importantly is my kids learned to get,
p192
aVthey learned to give.
p193
aVAnd we took the money that we made from our farmer's market,
p194
aVand started buying gifts for the homeless
p195
aVand for needy around the world.
p196
aVSo we started giving back.
p197
aVAnd that's when I realized that the greening of America
p198
aVstarts first with the pockets, then with the heart
p199
aVand then with the mind.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo we were onto something, and we're still onto something.
p202
aVAnd thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed,
p203
aVbecause they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.
p204
aVWe're 3,000 strong right now.
p205
aVAnd what does it really do?
p206
aVIt teaches kids to re-vision their communities,
p207
aVso when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this.
p208
aVAnd my kids, trained and certified \u2014
p209
aVMa, you get the tax abatement. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg \u2014
p210
aVcan take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that,
p211
aVand that to me, people, is another true "sí se puede" moment.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, how does it start? It starts in schools.
p214
aVNo more little Knicks and little Nets.
p215
aVGroup by broccoli, group by your favorite vegetable,
p216
aVsomething you can aspire to.
p217
aVOkay? And these are my future farmers of America,
p218
aVgrowing up in Brook Park on 141st Street,
p219
aVthe most migrant community in America.
p220
aVWhen tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this,
p221
aVit's no wonder we get fruit like that.
p222
aVAnd I love it! And so do they.
p223
aVAnd we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down.
p224
aVAnd that's a true "sí se puede" moment.
p225
aVAnd again, Brook Park feeds hundreds of people
p226
aVwithout a food stamp or a fingerprint.
p227
aVThe poorest congressional district in America,
p228
aVthe most migratory community in America, we can do this.
p229
aVBissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions,
p230
aVmoving kids into an economy they never imagined.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, somewhere over the rainbow, my friends,
p233
aVis the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it.
p234
aVHow does it start? Well, look at Jose's attention to detail.
p235
aVThank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground,
p236
aVand not aisle 9 at the supermarket
p237
aVor through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam.
p238
aVAnd when Henry knows that green is good, so do I.
p239
aVAnd when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.
p240
aVAnd most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids,
p241
aVyou get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool,
p242
aVand you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible.
p243
aa(lp244
VGod, I'm going to run out of time, so I've gotta keep it moving.
p245
aVBut this is my weekly paycheck for kids; that's our green graffiti.
p246
aVThis is what we're doing.
p247
aVAnd behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County.
p248
aVNothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other.
p249
aVI gotta tell you, I'm a protective parent.
p250
aVBut those kids are the kids who are now putting
p251
aVpumpkin patches on top of trains.
p252
aVWe're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent.
p253
aVWe're also becoming children of the corn,
p254
aVcreating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness
p255
aVand window bottles out of garbage.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow I don't expect every kid to be a farmer,
p258
aVbut I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service.
p259
aVI expect them to be engaged, and man, are they!
p260
aVSo that's my incredible classroom, that's the food.
p261
aVWhere does it go? Zero miles to plate, right down into the cafeteria.
p262
aVOr more importantly, to local shelters,
p263
aVwhere most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day.
p264
aVAnd we're stepping it up.
p265
aVNo Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm.
p266
aVAnd in his day, a million dollar gardens and incredible installations.
p267
aa(lp268
VLet me tell you something, people.
p269
aVThis is a beautiful moment.
p270
aVBlack field, brown field, toxic waste field, battlefield \u2014
p271
aVwe're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere, on cement.
p272
aVAnd we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame.
p273
aVWe take orders now. I'm booking for the spring.
p274
aVAnd these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything.
p275
aVAnd again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse
p276
aVas this to do something as special as this,
p277
aVwe're really creating a moment.
p278
aa(lp279
VNow, you may ask about these kids.
p280
aVForty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance.
p281
aVAll start overage and under-credit.
p282
aVThey are now, my first cohort is all in college, earning a living wage.
p283
aVThe rest are scheduled to graduate this June.
p284
aVHappy kids, happy families, happy colleagues.
p285
aVAmazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County.
p286
aa(lp287
VLet's talk about mint. Where is my mint?
p288
aVI grow seven kinds of mint in my class.
p289
aVMojitos, anybody? I'll be at Telepan later.
p290
aVBut, understand this is my intellectual Viagra.
p291
aVLadies and gentlemen, I gotta move quick, but understand this:
p292
aVThe borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats
p293
aVis becoming home to the organic ones.
p294
aVMy green [unclear] 25,000 pounds of vegetables,
p295
aVI'm growing organic citizens, engaged kids.
p296
aVSo help us go from this to this.
p297
aVSelf-sustaining entities, 18 months return on investment,
p298
aVplus we're paying people living wage and health benefits,
p299
aVwhile feeding people for pennies on the dollar.
p300
aa(lp301
VMartin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity.
p302
aVSo here in New York, I urge you, my fellow Americans,
p303
aVto help us make America great again.
p304
aVIt's simple. Share your passion.
p305
aVIt's real easy. Go see these two videos, please.
p306
aVOne got us invited to the White House, one's a recent incarnation.
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd most importantly, get the biggest bully out of schools.
p309
aVThis has got to go tomorrow.
p310
aVPeople, you can all do that.
p311
aVKeep kids out of stores that look like this.
p312
aVMake them a healthy plate,
p313
aVespecially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom \u2014 delicioso!
p314
aVModel good behavior. Get them to a green cart.
p315
aVBig kids love strawberries and bananas.
p316
aVTeach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC.
p317
aVLet them cook. Great lunch today, let them do culinary things.
p318
aVBut most importantly, just love them.
p319
aVNothing works like unconditional love.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo, my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green.
p322
aVIt's not. I come from a place where kids can buy
p323
aV35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment,
p324
aVwhere ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor.
p325
aVOkay? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me,
p326
aVwe have everything to gain and nothing to lose.
p327
aVSo here, and at a time when we've gone from
p328
aVthe audacity to hope to hope for some audacity,
p329
aVI urge you to do something.
p330
aVI urge you to do something.
p331
aa(lp332
VRight now, we're all tadpoles,
p333
aVbut I urge you to become a big frog and take that big, green leap.
p334
aVI don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever.
p335
aVJoin me. Use \u2014 I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it.
p336
aVWe can do something here.
p337
aVAnd along the way, please take time to smell the flowers,
p338
aVespecially if you and your students grew them.
p339
aa(lp340
VI'm Steve Ritz, this is Green Bronx Machine.
p341
aVI've got to say thank you to my wife and family, for my kids,
p342
aVthank you for coming every day, and for my colleagues,
p343
aVbelieving and supporting me.
p344
aVWe are growing our way into a new economy.
p345
aVThank you, God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz.
p346
aa(lp347
VSí se puede!

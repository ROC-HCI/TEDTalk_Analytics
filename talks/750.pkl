VI'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency.
p5
aVWhat I mean by that is that it's time for architecture
p6
aVto do things again, not just represent things.
p7
aVThis is a construction helmet that I received two years ago
p8
aVat the groundbreaking of the largest project
p9
aVI, and my firm, have ever been involved in.
p10
aVI was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person
p11
aVstanding on the stage with a shiny silver helmet.
p12
aVI thought it represented the importance of the architect.
p13
aa(lp14
VI stayed thrilled until I got home,
p15
aVthrew the helmet onto my bed,
p16
aVfell down onto my bed and realized inside
p17
aVthere was an inscription.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVNow, I think that this is a great metaphor
p20
aVfor the state of architecture and architects today.
p21
aVWe are for decorative purposes only.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, who do we have to blame?
p25
aVWe can only blame ourselves. Over the last 50 years
p26
aVthe design and construction industry has gotten much more complex
p27
aVand has gotten much more litigious.
p28
aVAnd we architects are cowards.
p29
aVSo, as we have faced liability,
p30
aVwe have stepped back and back,
p31
aVand unfortunately, where there is liability, guess what there is:
p32
aVpower.
p33
aVSo, eventually we have found ourselves
p34
aVin a totally marginalized position, way over here.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, what did we do? We're cowards,
p37
aVbut we're smart cowards.
p38
aVAnd so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture.
p39
aVAnd we announced, "Hey, architecture, it's over here,
p40
aVin this autonomous language
p41
aVwe're going to seed control of processes."
p42
aVAnd we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession.
p43
aVWe actually created an artificial schism
p44
aVbetween creation and execution,
p45
aVas if you could actually create without knowing how to execute
p46
aVand as if you could actually execute
p47
aVwithout knowing how to create.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, something else happened.
p50
aVAnd that's when we began to sell the world
p51
aVthat architecture was created by individuals
p52
aVcreating genius sketches.
p53
aVAnd that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches
p54
aVfor years and years and years is not only something
p55
aVto be derided,
p56
aVbut we would merely write it off as
p57
aVmerely execution.
p58
aVNow I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating
p59
aVthat 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act,
p60
aVand nine months of gestation,
p61
aVand, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor
p62
aVis merely execution.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo, what do we architects need to do? We need to stitch back
p65
aVcreation and execution.
p66
aVAnd we need to start authoring processes again
p67
aVinstead of authoring objects.
p68
aVNow, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years
p69
aVand start reinjecting agency,
p70
aVsocial engineering, back into architecture.
p71
aVNow, there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do,
p72
aVlike managing contracts, learning how to write contracts,
p73
aVunderstanding procurement processes,
p74
aVunderstanding the time value of money and cost estimation.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process,
p77
aVinto three very pedantic statements.
p78
aVThe first is: Take core positions with your client.
p79
aVI know it's shocking, right, that architecture would actually say that.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe second position is: Actually take positions.
p82
aVTake joint positions with your client.
p83
aVThis is the moment in which you as the architect
p84
aVand your client can begin to inject
p85
aVvision and agency.
p86
aVBut it has to be done together.
p87
aVAnd then only after this is done
p88
aVare you allowed to do this, begin to put forward
p89
aVarchitectural manifestations
p90
aVthat manifest those positions.
p91
aVAnd both owner and architect alike
p92
aVare empowered to critique those manifestations
p93
aVbased on the positions that you've taken.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this.
p96
aVI'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control.
p97
aVYou do not know what the end result is.
p98
aVBut I promise you, with enough brain power
p99
aVand enough passion and enough commitment,
p100
aVyou will arrive at conclusions
p101
aVthat will transcend convention,
p102
aVand will simply be something
p103
aVthat you could not have initially
p104
aVor individually conceived of.
p105
aa(lp106
VAlright, now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series
p107
aVof simple dumb sketches.
p108
aVThis is the modus operandi that we have today.
p109
aVWe roll 120-foot Spartan,
p110
aVi.e. our vision, up to our clients' gates of Troy.
p111
aVAnd we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right?
p112
aVWell, how about instead of doing that,
p113
aVwe roll up to the gates something they want.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor,
p116
aVbecause of course we all know that inside
p117
aVof the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears.
p118
aVSo, we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse
p119
aVthe vessel by which
p120
aVyou get through the gate,
p121
aVget through the constraints of a project.
p122
aVAt which point, you and your client
p123
aVhave the ability to start considering what
p124
aVyou're going to put inside that vessel,
p125
aVthe agency, the vision.
p126
aVAnd if you do that, you do that responsibly,
p127
aVI believe that instead of delivering Spartans,
p128
aVyou can deliver maidens.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this.
p131
aVIf we are so good at our craft
p132
aVshouldn't we be able to conceive
p133
aVof an architectural manifestation
p134
aVthat slides seamlessly through
p135
aVthe project's and the client's constraints?
p136
aVNow, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project
p137
aVthat's very dear to many people in this room\u2014
p138
aVwell, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room.
p139
aVAnd that's a project that is just about to open next week,
p140
aVthe new home for the Dallas Theater Center,
p141
aVthe Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow, I'm going to present it on the same terms:
p144
aVissue, position and architectural manifestation.
p145
aVNow, the first issue that we faced
p146
aVwas that the Dallas Theater Center
p147
aVhad a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect
p148
aVof some place outside of the triumvirate
p149
aVof New York, Chicago and Seattle.
p150
aVAnd this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership.
p151
aVBut it also had to do with something rather unusual,
p152
aVand that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in.
p153
aa(lp154
VWhy was this horrible little building
p155
aVso important to their renown and their innovation?
p156
aVBecause they could do whatever they wanted to to this building.
p157
aVWhen you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down.
p158
aVThis building, when an artistic director
p159
aVwanted to do a "Cherry Orchard" and wanted people
p160
aVand wanted people to come out of a well on the stage,
p161
aVthey brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole.
p162
aVWell, that's exciting.
p163
aVAnd you can start to get the best artistic directors,
p164
aVscenic designers and actors from around the country
p165
aVto come to perform here
p166
aVbecause you can do things you can't do elsewhere.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo, the first position we took was,
p169
aV"Hey, we as architects had better not show up
p170
aVand do a pristine building
p171
aVthat doesn't engender the same freedoms that this
p172
aVold dilapidated shed provided the company."
p173
aVThe second issue is a nuance of the first.
p174
aVAnd that's that the company and the building was multiform.
p175
aVThat meant that they were able to perform,
p176
aVas long as they had labor
p177
aVthey were able to go between proscenium, thrust, flat floor,
p178
aVarena, traverse, you name it.
p179
aVAll they needed was labor.
p180
aa(lp181
VWell, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions
p182
aVaround the world.
p183
aVIt started to become hard to raise operational costs,
p184
aVoperational budgets.
p185
aVSo, they stopped having inexpensive labor.
p186
aVAnd eventually they had to freeze their organization
p187
aVinto something called a bastardized thruscenium.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo, the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided,
p190
aVthe ability to move between stage configurations,
p191
aVhad better be able to be done
p192
aVwithout relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably.
p193
aVThe architectural manifestation
p194
aVwas frankly just dumb.
p195
aVIt was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house
p196
aVand redefine them as above house and below house.
p197
aa(lp198
VAt first blush you think, "Hey it's crazy,
p199
aVwhat could you possibly gain?"
p200
aVWe created what we like to call superfly.
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aVNow, superfly, the concept is
p203
aVyou take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower,
p204
aVand you smear them across flytower and auditorium.
p205
aVSuddenly the artistic director
p206
aVcan move between different stage
p207
aVand audience configurations.
p208
aVAnd because that flytower has the ability to pick up
p209
aVall the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment
p210
aVcan be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw
p211
aVpaint and replace,
p212
aVwith a minimum of cost.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move
p215
aVthat was unexpected.
p216
aVAnd that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium
p217
aVin a most unusual way.
p218
aVAnd that provided the artistic director suddenly
p219
aVthe ability to define suspension of disbelief.
p220
aVSo, the building affords artistic directors the freedom
p221
aVto conceive of almost any kind of activity
p222
aVunderneath this floating object.
p223
aVBut also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief
p224
aVsuch that in the last act of Macbeth,
p225
aVif he or she wants you to associate
p226
aVthe parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life,
p227
aVhe or she can do so.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow, in order to do this we and the clients
p230
aVhad to do something fairly remarkable.
p231
aVIn fact it really was the clients who had to do it.
p232
aVThey had to make a decision, based on the positions we took
p233
aVto redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture
p234
aVand one-third infrastructure,
p235
aVto actually the inverse,
p236
aVtwo-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture.
p237
aVThat's a lot for a client to commit to
p238
aVbefore you actually see the fruition of the concept.
p239
aVBut based on the positions,
p240
aVthey took the educated leap of faith to do so.
p241
aVAnd effectively we created what we like to call
p242
aVa theater machine.
p243
aa(lp244
VNow, that theater machine has ability
p245
aVto move between a whole series of configurations
p246
aVat the push of a button and a few stagehands
p247
aVin a short amount of time.
p248
aVBut it also has the potential
p249
aVto not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences.
p250
aVMeaning: The artistic director
p251
aVdoesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby.
p252
aa(lp253
VOne of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters
p254
aVis they hate us architects,
p255
aVbecause they say the first thing they have to do,
p256
aVthe first five minutes of any show,
p257
aVis they have to get our architecture
p258
aVout of the mind of their patron.
p259
aVWell now there are potentials of this building
p260
aVto allow the artistic director
p261
aVto actually move into the building
p262
aVwithout using our architecture.
p263
aVSo, in fact, there is the building, there is what we call the draw.
p264
aVYou're going down into our lobby,
p265
aVgo through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not,
p266
aVup through the stair that leads you into the auditorium.
p267
aa(lp268
VBut there is also the potential
p269
aVto allow people to move directly from the outside,
p270
aVin this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance,
p271
aVinto the interior of the auditorium.
p272
aVAnd here is the fruition of that in actuality.
p273
aVThese are the two large pivoting doors
p274
aVthat allow people to move directly from the outside, in
p275
aVor from the inside, out,
p276
aVperformers or audience alike.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly
p279
aVthis is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long.
p280
aVBut imagine the freedoms
p281
aVif you could take this further, that in fact you could consider
p282
aVa Wagnerian entry,
p283
aVa first act in thrust,
p284
aVan intermission in Greek, a second act in arena,
p285
aVand you leave through our lobby with dangly bits.
p286
aVNow that, I would say, is architecture performing.
p287
aVIt is taking the hand of the architect
p288
aVto actually remove the hand of the architect
p289
aVin favor of the hand of the artistic director.
p290
aa(lp291
VI'll go through the three basic configurations.
p292
aVThis is the flat floor configuration.
p293
aVYou notice that there is no proscenium,
p294
aVthe balconies have been raised up, there are no seats,
p295
aVthe floor in the auditorium is flat.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe first configuration is easy to understand.
p298
aVThe balconies come down, you see that the orchestra
p299
aVbegins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage,
p300
aVand the seats come in.
p301
aa(lp302
VThe third configuration is a little harder to understand.
p303
aVHere you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way
p304
aVin order to bring a thrust into the space.
p305
aVAnd some of the seats need to actually change their direction,
p306
aVand change their rake, to allow that to happen.
p307
aa(lp308
VI'll do it again so you can see it.
p309
aVThere you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium.
p310
aVAnd there it is in the thrust configuration.
p311
aa(lp312
VIn order to do that,
p313
aVagain, we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks.
p314
aVAnd they told us one important thing:
p315
aV"You shall not beta-test."
p316
aVMeaning, nothing that we do
p317
aVcan we be the first ones to do it.
p318
aVBut they were willing for us to apply technologies
p319
aVfrom other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd the solution in terms of the balconies
p322
aVwas to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift.
p323
aVNow, if you were to take a scoreboard
p324
aVand drop it on dirt and whiskey,
p325
aVthat would be bad.
p326
aVIf you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena
p327
aVand be able to do the Ice Capades the next night,
p328
aVthat would also be bad.
p329
aVAnd so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms
p330
aVand allowed the theater and our client
p331
aVto actually do this with confidence
p332
aVthat they would be able to change over their configurations at will.
p333
aa(lp334
VThe second technology that we applied
p335
aVwas actually using things that you know from
p336
aVthe stage side of an opera house.
p337
aVIn this case what we're doing is we're taking
p338
aVthe orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it,
p339
aVchanging the rake, taking it back to flat floor,
p340
aVchanging the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define
p341
aVrakes and viewing angles
p342
aVof people in the orchestra seating, at will.
p343
aa(lp344
VHere you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage
p345
aVto thrust configuration.
p346
aVThe proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world
p347
aVin which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space.
p348
aVHere you see the various acoustic baffles as well as
p349
aVthe flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium.
p350
aVAnd ultimately, up in the flytower,
p351
aVthe scene sets that allow the transformations to occur.
p352
aa(lp353
VAs I said, all that was in service of creating a flexible
p354
aVyet affordable configuration.
p355
aVBut we got this other benefit, and that was
p356
aVthe ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage
p357
aVDallas on the outside.
p358
aVHere you see the building in its current state
p359
aVwith blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil.
p360
aVActually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds
p361
aVthat are integrated into the windows themselves,
p362
aVagain with failsafe mechanisms
p363
aVthat can be lifted such that you can completely demystify,
p364
aVif you chose, the operations of the theater
p365
aVgoing on behind, rehearsals and so forth.
p366
aVBut you also have the ability
p367
aVto allow the audience to see Dallas,
p368
aVto perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance.
p369
aa(lp370
VNow, if I'll take you through \u2014
p371
aVthis is an early concept sketch \u2014
p372
aVtake you through kind of a mixture of all these things together.
p373
aVEffectively you would have something like this.
p374
aVYou would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber:
p375
aV"Aida," their elephants, you can bring the elephants in.
p376
aVYou would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas
p377
aVor vice versa, Dallas to the auditorium.
p378
aVYou'd be able to open portions in order to
p379
aVchange the procession,
p380
aVallow people to come in and out for an intermission,
p381
aVor to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance.
p382
aa(lp383
VAs I said, all the balconies can move,
p384
aVbut they can also be disappeared completely.
p385
aVThe proscenium can fly.
p386
aVYou can bring large objects into the chamber itself.
p387
aVBut most convincingly when we had to confront the idea
p388
aVof changing costs from architecture to infrastructure,
p389
aVis something that is represented by this.
p390
aVAnd again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built,
p391
aVbut at least suggests the ideas.
p392
aa(lp393
VThis building has the ability, in short order,
p394
aVto go back to a flat floor organization
p395
aVsuch that they can rent it out.
p396
aVNow, if there is anyone here from American Airlines,
p397
aVplease consider doing your Christmas party here.
p398
aV(Laughter)
p399
aVThat allows the company to raise operational budgets
p400
aVwithout having to compete with other venues
p401
aVwith much larger auditoriums.
p402
aVThat's an enormous benefit.
p403
aa(lp404
VSo, the theater company has the ability
p405
aVto do totally hermetic,
p406
aVlight-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics,
p407
aVgreat intimacy Shakespeare,
p408
aVbut can also do Beckett
p409
aVwith the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it.
p410
aVHere it is in a flat floor configuration.
p411
aVThe theater has been going through its kind of paces.
p412
aa(lp413
VHere it is in an end stage configuration.
p414
aVIt's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.
p415
aVWe stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked,
p416
aVand you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them.
p417
aVIt was very unusual.
p418
aVHere it is in a thrust configuration.
p419
aVAnd last but not least,
p420
aVyou see this already has the ability to create events
p421
aVin order to generate operational budgets
p422
aVto overcome the building in fact performing
p423
aVto allow the company to overcome their biggest problem.
p424
aa(lp425
VI'm going to show you a brief time lapse.
p426
aVAs I said, this can be done with only two people,
p427
aVand with a minimum amount of time.
p428
aVThis is the first time that actually the changeover was done
p429
aVand so there is literally thousands of people because
p430
aVeveryone was excited and wanted to be a part of it.
p431
aVSo, in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around.
p432
aVAnd think of it being done with just a few people.
p433
aVAgain, just a couple people are required.
p434
aV(Laughter)
p435
aVI promise.
p436
aVEt voila.
p437
aV(Applause)
p438
aa(lp439
VSo, just in conclusion, a few shots.
p440
aVThis is the AT&T Performing Arts Center's
p441
aVDee and Charles Wyly Theater.
p442
aVThere it is at night.
p443
aVAnd last but not least the entire AT&T Performing Arts Center.
p444
aVYou can see the Winspear Opera House on the right
p445
aVand the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left.
p446
aa(lp447
VAnd to remind you that here is an example in which
p448
aVarchitecture actually did something.
p449
aVBut we got to that conclusion
p450
aVwithout understanding where we were going,
p451
aVwhat we knew were a series of issues that the company
p452
aVand the client was confronted with.
p453
aVAnd we took positions with them, and it was through those positions
p454
aVthat we began to take architectural manifestations
p455
aVand we arrived at a conclusion that none of us,
p456
aVreally none of us could ever
p457
aVhave conceived of initially or individually.
p458
aVThank you.

VLiving with a physical disability isn't easy
p5
aVanywhere in the world,
p6
aVbut if you live in a country like the United States,
p7
aVthere's certain appurtenances available to you that do make life easier.
p8
aVSo if you're in a building, you can take an elevator.
p9
aVIf you're crossing the street, you have sidewalk cutouts.
p10
aVAnd if you have to travel some distance farther
p11
aVthan you can do under your own power, there's accessible vehicles,
p12
aVand if you can't afford one of those,
p13
aVthere's accessible public transportation.
p14
aVBut in the developing world, things are quite different.
p15
aVThere's 40 million people who need a wheelchair but don't have one,
p16
aVand the majority of these people live in rural areas,
p17
aVwhere the only connections to community, to employment, to education,
p18
aVare by traveling long distances on rough terrain
p19
aVoften under their own power.
p20
aVAnd the devices usually available to these people
p21
aVare not made for that context, break down quickly,
p22
aVand are hard to repair.
p23
aVI started looking at wheelchairs in developing countries in 2005,
p24
aVwhen I spent the summer assessing the state of technology in Tanzania,
p25
aVand I talked to wheelchair users, wheelchair manufacturers, disability groups,
p26
aVand what stood out to me
p27
aVis that there wasn't a device available
p28
aVthat was designed for rural areas, that could go fast
p29
aVand efficiently on many types of terrain.
p30
aVSo being a mechanical engineer,
p31
aVbeing at MIT and having lots of resources available to me,
p32
aVI thought I'd try to do something about it.
p33
aVNow when you're talking about trying to travel
p34
aVlong distances on rough terrain,
p35
aVI immediately thought of a mountain bike,
p36
aVand a mountain bike's good at doing this
p37
aVbecause it has a gear train,
p38
aVand you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill
p39
aVor go through mud or sand
p40
aVand you get a lot of torque but a low speed.
p41
aVAnd if you want to go faster, say on pavement,
p42
aVyou can shift to a high gear,
p43
aVand you get less torque, but higher speeds.
p44
aVSo the logical evolution here
p45
aVis to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components,
p46
aVwhich many people have done.
p47
aVBut these are two products available in the U.S. that
p48
aVwould be difficult to transfer into developing countries
p49
aVbecause they're much, much too expensive.
p50
aVAnd the context I'm talking about is where
p51
aVyou need to have a product that is less than 200 dollars.
p52
aVAnd this ideal product would also be able to go
p53
aVabout five kilometers a day so you could get to your job, get to school,
p54
aVand do it on many, many different types of terrain.
p55
aVBut when you get home or want to go indoors at your work,
p56
aVit's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside.
p57
aVAnd furthermore, if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas,
p58
aVit has to be repairable using the local tools, materials and knowledge
p59
aVin those contexts.
p60
aVSo the real crux of the problem here is,
p61
aVhow do you make a system that's a simple device
p62
aVbut gives you a large mechanical advantage?
p63
aVHow do you make a mountain bike for your arms
p64
aVthat doesn't have the mountain bike cost and complexity?
p65
aVSo as is the case with simple solutions,
p66
aVoftentimes the answer is right in front of your face, and for us it was levers.
p67
aVWe use levers all the time, in tools, doorknobs, bicycle parts.
p68
aVAnd that moment of inspiration, that key invention moment,
p69
aVwas when I was sitting in front of my design notebook
p70
aVand I started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever,
p71
aVand if they grab near the end of the lever,
p72
aVthey can get an effectively long lever
p73
aVand produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth,
p74
aVand effectively get a low gear.
p75
aVAnd as they slide their hand down the lever,
p76
aVthey can push with a smaller effective lever length,
p77
aVbut push through a bigger angle every stroke,
p78
aVwhich makes a faster rotational speed, and gives you an effective high gear.
p79
aVSo what's exciting about this system
p80
aVis that it's really, really mechanically simple,
p81
aVand you could make it using technology
p82
aVthat's been around for hundreds of years.
p83
aVSo seeing this in practice,
p84
aVthis is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that,
p85
aVafter a few years of development,
p86
aVwe're now going into production with,
p87
aVand this is a full-time wheelchair user \u2014
p88
aVhe's paralyzed \u2014 in Guatemala,
p89
aVand you see he's able to traverse pretty rough terrain.
p90
aVAgain, the key innovation of this technology is that when he wants to go fast,
p91
aVhe just grabs the levers near the pivots and goes through a big angle every stroke,
p92
aVand as the going gets tougher, he just slides his hands up the levers,
p93
aVcreates more torque, and kind of bench-presses his way
p94
aVout of trouble through the rough terrain.
p95
aVNow the big, important point here is that
p96
aVthe person is the complex machine in this system.
p97
aVIt's the person that's sliding his hands up and down the levers,
p98
aVso the mechanism itself can be very simple
p99
aVand composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world.
p100
aVBecause those bicycle parts
p101
aVare so ubiquitously available, they're super-cheap.
p102
aVThey're made by the gazillions in China and India,
p103
aVand we can source them anywhere in the world,
p104
aVbuild the chair anywhere, and most importantly repair it,
p105
aVeven out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic
p106
aVwho has local tools, knowledge and parts available.
p107
aVNow, when you want to use the LFC indoors,
p108
aVall you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain,
p109
aVstow them in the frame, and it converts into a normal wheelchair
p110
aVthat you can use just like any other normal wheelchair,
p111
aVand we sized it like a normal wheelchair,
p112
aVso it's narrow enough to fit through a standard doorway,
p113
aVit's low enough to fit under a table,
p114
aVand it's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom
p115
aVand this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet,
p116
aVand be able to transfer off
p117
aVjust like he could in a normal wheelchair.
p118
aVNow, there's three important points that I want to stress
p119
aVthat I think really hit home in this project.
p120
aVThe first is that this product works well because
p121
aVwe were effectively able to combine
p122
aVrigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design
p123
aVfocused on the social and usage and economic factors
p124
aVimportant to wheelchair users in the developing countries.
p125
aVSo I'm an academic at MIT, and I'm a mechanical engineer,
p126
aVso I can do things like look at the type of terrain you want to travel on,
p127
aVand figure out how much resistance it should impose,
p128
aVlook at the parts we have available and mix and match them
p129
aVto figure out what sort of gear trains we can use,
p130
aVand then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body
p131
aVto analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair
p132
aVas you put your arms up and down the levers.
p133
aVSo as a wet-behind-the-ears student, excited,
p134
aVour team made a prototype,
p135
aVbrought that prototype to Tanzania, Kenya and Vietnam in 2008,
p136
aVand found it was terrible
p137
aVbecause we didn't get enough input from users.
p138
aVSo because we tested it with wheelchair users,
p139
aVwith wheelchair manufacturers, we got that feedback from them,
p140
aVnot just articulating their problems, but articulating their solutions,
p141
aVand worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design,
p142
aVwhich we brought back to East Africa in '09
p143
aVthat worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain,
p144
aVbut it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big,
p145
aVit was heavy, it was hard to move around,
p146
aVso again with that user feedback, we went back to the drawing board,
p147
aVcame up with a better design, 20 pounds lighter,
p148
aVas narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested that in a field trial in Guatemala,
p149
aVand that advanced the product to the point
p150
aVwhere we have now that it's going into production.
p151
aVNow also being engineering scientists,
p152
aVwe were able to quantify the performance benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair,
p153
aVso here are some shots of our trial in Guatemala
p154
aVwhere we tested the LFC on village terrain,
p155
aVand tested people's biomechanical outputs,
p156
aVtheir oxygen consumption, how fast they go,
p157
aVhow much power they're putting out,
p158
aVboth in their regular wheelchairs and using the LFC,
p159
aVand we found that the LFC is about 80 percent faster
p160
aVgoing on these terrains than a normal wheelchair.
p161
aVIt's also about 40 percent more efficient than a regular wheelchair,
p162
aVand because of the mechanical advantage you get from the levers,
p163
aVyou can produce 50 percent higher torque
p164
aVand really muscle your way through the really, really rough terrain.
p165
aVNow the second lesson that we learned in this is that
p166
aVthe constraints on this design really push the innovation,
p167
aVbecause we had to hit such a low price point,
p168
aVbecause we had to make a device that could travel
p169
aVon many, many types of terrain but still be usable indoors,
p170
aVand be simple enough to repair,
p171
aVwe ended up with a fundamentally new product,
p172
aVa new product that is an innovation
p173
aVin a space that really hasn't changed in a hundred years.
p174
aVAnd these are all merits that are not just good in the developing world.
p175
aVWhy not in countries like the U.S. too?
p176
aVSo we teamed up with Continuum,
p177
aVa local product design firm here in Boston
p178
aVto make the high-end version, the developed world version,
p179
aVthat we'll probably sell primarily in the U.S. and Europe,
p180
aVbut to higher-income buyers.
p181
aVAnd the final point I want to make is that I think
p182
aVthis project worked well because we engaged
p183
aVall the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider
p184
aVin bringing the technology from inception of an idea
p185
aVthrough innovation, validation, commercialization and dissemination,
p186
aVand that cycle has to start and end with end users.
p187
aVThese are the people that define the requirements of the technology,
p188
aVand these are the people that have to give the thumbs-up at the end,
p189
aVand say, "Yeah, it actually works. It meets our needs."
p190
aVSo people like me in the academic space,
p191
aVwe can do things like innovate and analyze and test,
p192
aVcreate data and make bench-level prototypes,
p193
aVbut how do you get that bench-level prototype to commercialization?
p194
aVSo we need gap-fillers like Continuum that can work on commercializing,
p195
aVand we started a whole NGO to bring our chair to market \u2014
p196
aVGlobal Research Innovation Technology \u2014
p197
aVand then we also teamed up with a big manufacturer in India, Pinnacle Industries,
p198
aVthat's tooled up now to make 500 chairs a month
p199
aVand will make the first batch of 200 next month,
p200
aVwhich will be delivered in India.
p201
aVAnd then finally, to get this out to the people in scale,
p202
aVwe teamed up with the largest disability organization
p203
aVin the world, Jaipur Foot.
p204
aVNow what's powerful about this model
p205
aVis when you bring together all these stakeholders
p206
aVthat represent each link in the chain
p207
aVfrom inception of an idea
p208
aVall the way to implementation in the field,
p209
aVthat's where the magic happens.
p210
aVThat's where you can take a guy like me, an academic,
p211
aVbut analyze and test and create a new technology
p212
aVand quantitatively determine how much better the performance is.
p213
aVYou can connect with stakeholders like the manufacturers
p214
aVand talk with them face-to-face and leverage their
p215
aVlocal knowledge of manufacturing practices and their clients
p216
aVand combine that knowledge with our engineering knowledge
p217
aVto create something greater than either of us could have done alone.
p218
aVAnd then you can also engage the end user
p219
aVin the design process, and not just ask him what he needs,
p220
aVbut ask him how he thinks it can be achieved.
p221
aVAnd this picture was taken in India in our last field trial,
p222
aVwhere we had a 90-percent adoption rate where people
p223
aVswitched to using our Leveraged Freedom Chair over their normal wheelchair,
p224
aVand this picture specifically is of Ashok,
p225
aVand Ashok had a spinal injury when he fell out of a tree,
p226
aVand he had been working at a tailor, but once he was injured
p227
aVhe wasn't able to transport himself from his house
p228
aVover a kilometer to his shop in his normal wheelchair.
p229
aVThe road was too rough.
p230
aVBut the day after he got an LFC, he hopped in it,
p231
aVrode that kilometer, opened up his shop
p232
aVand soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms
p233
aVand started making money, started providing for his family again.
p234
aVAshok: You also encouraged me to work.
p235
aVI rested for a day at home.
p236
aVThe next day I went to my shop.
p237
aVNow everything is back to normal.
p238
aVAmos Winter: And thank you very much for having me today.

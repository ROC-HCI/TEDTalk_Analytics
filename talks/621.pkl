VI love theater.
p5
aVI love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else
p6
aVand look at life with a completely new perspective.
p7
aVI love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.
p8
aVThe idea that in that room at that moment,
p9
aVeveryone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion,
p10
aVcomes together.
p11
aVAt that moment, we transcend space and time together.
p12
aVTheater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.
p13
aVAnd our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.
p14
aVOur ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.
p15
aVI was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show,
p16
aVand began developing "Upwake."
p17
aV"Upwake" tells the story of Zero,
p18
aVa modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase,
p19
aVstuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.
p20
aVI wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.
p21
aVAnd I wanted to let my imagination run wild.
p22
aVSo I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.
p23
aa(lp24
VIf Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here,
p25
aVhe would have drawn three holes inside that box
p26
aVand told you your sheep was inside.
p27
aVBecause, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.
p28
aVThis is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination
p29
aVfrom head to paper to screen to life.
p30
aVIn "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard,
p31
aVclones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice,
p32
aVsails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.
p33
aVI wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.
p34
aVGo from one world to another in a second.
p35
aVI wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity
p36
aVand use metaphors to suggest ideas.
p37
aVAt the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.
p38
aVTechnology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions
p39
aVin high definition, live, on stage.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship
p42
aVbetween theater and technology.
p43
aVLet's start with technology.
p44
aV(Fuse blowing)
p45
aVAll right. Let's start with theater.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aV(Buzzing)
p48
aV(Click, click, bang)
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aV(Applause)
p51
aVThank you.
p52
aa(lp53
V"Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.
p54
aVI project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage
p55
aVwhich I interact with.
p56
aVThe use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.
p57
aVI didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.
p58
aVThere are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.
p59
aVIt's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.
p60
aVThree hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later,
p61
aVwhat started as a one person show became a collaborative work
p62
aVof nineteen most talented artists.
p63
aVAnd here are some excerpts.
p64
aV(Applause)
p65
aVThank you.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.
p68
aVAnd in Austin, Texas,
p69
aVI was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.
p70
aVWhen I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this:
p71
aVSix hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.
p72
aVI was a little nervous performing without animation, costume \u2014 really \u2014 and make-up.
p73
aVBut the teachers came to me afterward and told me
p74
aVthey hadn't seen the kids that attentive.
p75
aVAnd I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality
p76
aVin order to transport them into another.
p77
aVSomething happened along the way.
p78
aVZero became a person and not just a character in a play.
p79
aVZero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.
p80
aVZero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century,
p81
aVand Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.
p82
aa(lp83
VIt's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box
p84
aVas it is about taking theater out of its box.
p85
aVAs a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.
p86
aVAnd that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance,
p87
aVthen people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.
p88
aVIt's as though you made something resonate within them.
p89
aVIt's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting
p90
aVallows them to be themselves just a bit more.
p91
aVBecause through your mask, they let theirs go.
p92
aa(lp93
VBeing human is an art form.
p94
aVI know theater can improve the quality of people's lives,
p95
aVand I know theater can heal.
p96
aVI've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.
p97
aVI have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors
p98
aVbe lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.
p99
aVI know theater unites us.
p100
aVZero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow,
p101
aVtell various stories through different mediums.
p102
aa(lp103
VComic books. Quantum physics video games.
p104
aVAnd Zero wants to go to the moon.
p105
aVIn 2007, Zero launched a green campaign,
p106
aVsuggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity
p107
aVevery Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.
p108
aVThe idea is simple, basic. It's not original,
p109
aVbut it's important, and it's important to participate.
p110
aa(lp111
VThere is a revolution.
p112
aVIt's a human and technological revolution.
p113
aVIt's motion and emotion.
p114
aVIt's information.
p115
aVIt's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.
p116
aVIt's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.
p117
aVIt's happening.
p118
aVThe natural progression of science and art
p119
aVfinding each other to better touch and define the human experience.
p120
aVThere is a revolution in the way that we think,
p121
aVin the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories,
p122
aVour evolution.
p123
aVThis is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.
p124
aVCharlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures
p125
aVand told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.
p126
aVHe was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.
p127
aVHe gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings
p128
aVwhen they needed it the most.
p129
aa(lp130
VWe are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible.
p131
aVIn the science of today, we become artists.
p132
aVIn the art of today, we become scientists.
p133
aVWe design our world. We invent possibilities.
p134
aVWe teach, touch and move.
p135
aVIt is now that we can use the diversity of our talents
p136
aVto create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now.
p137
aV(Ringing)
p138
aVThank you.

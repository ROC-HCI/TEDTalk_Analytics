VThis is a lot of ones and zeros.
p5
aVIt's what we call binary information.
p6
aVThis is how computers talk.
p7
aVIt's how they store information.
p8
aVIt's how computers think.
p9
aVIt's how computers do
p10
aVeverything it is that computers do.
p11
aVI'm a cybersecurity researcher,
p12
aVwhich means my job is to sit down with this information
p13
aVand try to make sense of it,
p14
aVto try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean.
p15
aVUnfortunately for me, we're not just talking
p16
aVabout the ones and zeros I have on the screen here.
p17
aVWe're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros.
p18
aVWe're talking about billions and billions
p19
aVof ones and zeros,
p20
aVmore than anyone could possibly comprehend.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, as exciting as that sounds,
p23
aVwhen I first started doing cyber \u2014
p24
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p25
aVwhen I first started doing cyber, I wasn't sure
p26
aVthat sifting through ones and zeros
p27
aVwas what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,
p28
aVbecause in my mind, cyber
p29
aVwas keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer,
p30
aVit was keeping people's Myspace pages from being hacked,
p31
aVand maybe, maybe on my most glorious day,
p32
aVit was keeping someone's credit card information from being stolen.
p33
aVThose are important things,
p34
aVbut that's not how I wanted to spend my life.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut after 30 minutes of work
p37
aVas a defense contractor,
p38
aVI soon found out that my idea of cyber
p39
aVwas a little bit off.
p40
aVIn fact, in terms of national security,
p41
aVkeeping viruses off of my grandma's computer
p42
aVwas surprisingly low on their priority list.
p43
aVAnd the reason for that is cyber
p44
aVis so much bigger than any one of those things.
p45
aVCyber is an integral part of all of our lives,
p46
aVbecause computers are an integral part of all of our lives,
p47
aVeven if you don't own a computer.
p48
aVComputers control everything in your car,
p49
aVfrom your GPS to your airbags.
p50
aVThey control your phone.
p51
aVThey're the reason you can call 911
p52
aVand get someone on the other line.
p53
aVThey control our nation's entire infrastructure.
p54
aVThey're the reason you have electricity,
p55
aVheat, clean water, food.
p56
aVComputers control our military equipment,
p57
aVeverything from missile silos to satellites
p58
aVto nuclear defense networks.
p59
aVAll of these things are made possible
p60
aVbecause of computers,
p61
aVand therefore because of cyber,
p62
aVand when something goes wrong,
p63
aVcyber can make all of these things impossible.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut that's where I step in.
p66
aVA big part of my job is defending all of these things,
p67
aVkeeping them working,
p68
aVbut once in a while, part of my job is to break one of these things,
p69
aVbecause cyber isn't just about defense,
p70
aVit's also about offense.
p71
aVWe're entering an age where we talk about
p72
aVcyberweapons.
p73
aVIn fact, so great is the potential for cyber offense
p74
aVthat cyber is considered a new domain of warfare.
p75
aVWarfare.
p76
aVIt's not necessarily a bad thing.
p77
aVOn the one hand, it means we have whole new front
p78
aVon which we need to defend ourselves,
p79
aVbut on the other hand,
p80
aVit means we have a whole new way to attack,
p81
aVa whole new way to stop evil people
p82
aVfrom doing evil things.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo let's consider an example of this
p85
aVthat's completely theoretical.
p86
aVSuppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building,
p87
aVand he wants to do this again and again
p88
aVin the future.
p89
aVSo he doesn't want to be in that building when it explodes.
p90
aVHe's going to use a cell phone
p91
aVas a remote detonator.
p92
aVNow, it used to be the only way we had
p93
aVto stop this terrorist
p94
aVwas with a hail of bullets and a car chase,
p95
aVbut that's not necessarily true anymore.
p96
aVWe're entering an age where we can stop him
p97
aVwith the press of a button
p98
aVfrom 1,000 miles away,
p99
aVbecause whether he knew it or not,
p100
aVas soon as he decided to use his cell phone,
p101
aVhe stepped into the realm of cyber.
p102
aVA well-crafted cyber attack could break into his phone,
p103
aVdisable the overvoltage protections on his battery,
p104
aVdrastically overload the circuit,
p105
aVcause the battery to overheat, and explode.
p106
aVNo more phone, no more detonator,
p107
aVmaybe no more terrorist,
p108
aVall with the press of a button
p109
aVfrom a thousand miles away.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo how does this work?
p112
aVIt all comes back to those ones and zeros.
p113
aVBinary information makes your phone work,
p114
aVand used correctly, it can make your phone explode.
p115
aVSo when you start to look at cyber from this perspective,
p116
aVspending your life sifting through binary information
p117
aVstarts to seem kind of exciting.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut here's the catch: This is hard,
p120
aVreally, really hard,
p121
aVand here's why.
p122
aVThink about everything you have on your cell phone.
p123
aVYou've got the pictures you've taken.
p124
aVYou've got the music you listen to.
p125
aVYou've got your contacts list,
p126
aVyour email, and probably 500 apps
p127
aVyou've never used in your entire life,
p128
aVand behind all of this is the software, the code,
p129
aVthat controls your phone,
p130
aVand somewhere, buried inside of that code,
p131
aVis a tiny piece that controls your battery,
p132
aVand that's what I'm really after,
p133
aVbut all of this, just a bunch of ones and zeros,
p134
aVand it's all just mixed together.
p135
aVIn cyber, we call this finding a needle in a stack of needles,
p136
aVbecause everything pretty much looks alike.
p137
aVI'm looking for one key piece,
p138
aVbut it just blends in with everything else.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo let's step back from this theoretical situation
p141
aVof making a terrorist's phone explode,
p142
aVand look at something that actually happened to me.
p143
aVPretty much no matter what I do,
p144
aVmy job always starts with sitting down
p145
aVwith a whole bunch of binary information,
p146
aVand I'm always looking for one key piece
p147
aVto do something specific.
p148
aVIn this case, I was looking for a very advanced,
p149
aVvery high-tech piece of code
p150
aVthat I knew I could hack,
p151
aVbut it was somewhere buried
p152
aVinside of a billion ones and zeroes.
p153
aVUnfortunately for me, I didn't know
p154
aVquite what I was looking for.
p155
aVI didn't know quite what it would look like,
p156
aVwhich makes finding it really, really hard.
p157
aVWhen I have to do that, what I have to do
p158
aVis basically look at various pieces
p159
aVof this binary information,
p160
aVtry to decipher each piece, and see if it might be
p161
aVwhat I'm after.
p162
aVSo after a while, I thought I had found the piece
p163
aVI was looking for.
p164
aVI thought maybe this was it.
p165
aVIt seemed to be about right, but I couldn't quite tell.
p166
aVI couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented.
p167
aVSo I spent some time trying to put this together,
p168
aVbut wasn't having a whole lot of luck,
p169
aVand finally I decided,
p170
aVI'm going to get through this,
p171
aVI'm going to come in on a weekend,
p172
aVand I'm not going to leave
p173
aVuntil I figure out what this represents.
p174
aVSo that's what I did. I came in on a Saturday morning,
p175
aVand about 10 hours in, I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle.
p176
aVI just didn't know how they fit together.
p177
aVI didn't know what these ones and zeros meant.
p178
aVAt the 15-hour mark,
p179
aVI started to get a better picture of what was there,
p180
aVbut I had a creeping suspicion
p181
aVthat what I was looking at
p182
aVwas not at all related to what I was looking for.
p183
aVBy 20 hours, the pieces started to come together
p184
aVvery slowly \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p185
aVand I was pretty sure I was going down
p186
aVthe wrong path at this point,
p187
aVbut I wasn't going to give up.
p188
aVAfter 30 hours in the lab,
p189
aVI figured out exactly what I was looking at,
p190
aVand I was right, it wasn't what I was looking for.
p191
aVI spent 30 hours piecing together
p192
aVthe ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVI wasted 30 hours of my life searching for this kitten
p195
aVthat had nothing at all to do
p196
aVwith what I was trying to accomplish.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo I was frustrated, I was exhausted.
p199
aVAfter 30 hours in the lab, I probably smelled horrible.
p200
aVBut instead of just going home
p201
aVand calling it quits, I took a step back
p202
aVand asked myself, what went wrong here?
p203
aVHow could I make such a stupid mistake?
p204
aVI'm really pretty good at this.
p205
aVI do this for a living.
p206
aVSo what happened?
p207
aVWell I thought, when you're looking at information at this level,
p208
aVit's so easy to lose track of what you're doing.
p209
aVIt's easy to not see the forest through the trees.
p210
aVIt's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole
p211
aVand waste a tremendous amount of time
p212
aVdoing the wrong thing.
p213
aVBut I had this epiphany.
p214
aVWe were looking at the data completely incorrectly
p215
aVsince day one.
p216
aVThis is how computers think, ones and zeros.
p217
aVIt's not how people think,
p218
aVbut we've been trying to adapt our minds
p219
aVto think more like computers
p220
aVso that we can understand this information.
p221
aVInstead of trying to make our minds fit the problem,
p222
aVwe should have been making the problem
p223
aVfit our minds,
p224
aVbecause our brains have a tremendous potential
p225
aVfor analyzing huge amounts of information,
p226
aVjust not like this.
p227
aVSo what if we could unlock that potential
p228
aVjust by translating this
p229
aVto the right kind of information?
p230
aVSo with these ideas in mind,
p231
aVI sprinted out of my basement lab at work
p232
aVto my basement lab at home,
p233
aVwhich looked pretty much the same.
p234
aVThe main difference is, at work,
p235
aVI'm surrounded by cyber materials,
p236
aVand cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation.
p237
aVAt home, I'm surrounded by everything else I've ever learned.
p238
aVSo I poured through every book I could find,
p239
aVevery idea I'd ever encountered,
p240
aVto see how could we translate a problem
p241
aVfrom one domain to something completely different?
p242
aa(lp243
VThe biggest question was,
p244
aVwhat do we want to translate it to?
p245
aVWhat do our brains do perfectly naturally
p246
aVthat we could exploit?
p247
aVMy answer was vision.
p248
aVWe have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information.
p249
aVWe can combine color gradients, depth cues,
p250
aVall sorts of these different signals
p251
aVinto one coherent picture of the world around us.
p252
aVThat's incredible.
p253
aVSo if we could find a way to translate
p254
aVthese binary patterns to visual signals,
p255
aVwe could really unlock the power of our brains
p256
aVto process this stuff.
p257
aVSo I started looking at the binary information,
p258
aVand I asked myself, what do I do
p259
aVwhen I first encounter something like this?
p260
aVAnd the very first thing I want to do,
p261
aVthe very first question I want to answer,
p262
aVis what is this?
p263
aVI don't care what it does, how it works.
p264
aVAll I want to know is, what is this?
p265
aVAnd the way I can figure that out
p266
aVis by looking at chunks,
p267
aVsequential chunks of binary information,
p268
aVand I look at the relationships between those chunks.
p269
aVWhen I gather up enough of these sequences,
p270
aVI begin to get an idea of exactly
p271
aVwhat this information must be.
p272
aVSo let's go back to that
p273
aVblow up the terrorist's phone situation.
p274
aVThis is what English text looks like
p275
aVat a binary level.
p276
aVThis is what your contacts list would look like
p277
aVif I were examining it.
p278
aVIt's really hard to analyze this at this level,
p279
aVbut if we take those same binary chunks
p280
aVthat I would be trying to find,
p281
aVand instead translate that
p282
aVto a visual representation,
p283
aVtranslate those relationships,
p284
aVthis is what we get.
p285
aVThis is what English text looks like
p286
aVfrom a visual abstraction perspective.
p287
aVAll of a sudden,
p288
aVit shows us all the same information
p289
aVthat was in the ones and zeros,
p290
aVbut show us it in an entirely different way,
p291
aVa way that we can immediately comprehend.
p292
aVWe can instantly see all of the patterns here.
p293
aVIt takes me seconds to pick out patterns here,
p294
aVbut hours, days, to pick them out
p295
aVin ones and zeros.
p296
aVIt takes minutes for anybody to learn
p297
aVwhat these patterns represent here,
p298
aVbut years of experience in cyber
p299
aVto learn what those same patterns represent
p300
aVin ones and zeros.
p301
aVSo this piece is caused by
p302
aVlower case letters followed by lower case letters
p303
aVinside of that contact list.
p304
aVThis is upper case by upper case,
p305
aVupper case by lower case, lower case by upper case.
p306
aVThis is caused by spaces. This is caused by carriage returns.
p307
aVWe can go through every little detail
p308
aVof the binary information in seconds,
p309
aVas opposed to weeks, months, at this level.
p310
aVThis is what an image looks like
p311
aVfrom your cell phone.
p312
aVBut this is what it looks like
p313
aVin a visual abstraction.
p314
aVThis is what your music looks like,
p315
aVbut here's its visual abstraction.
p316
aVMost importantly for me,
p317
aVthis is what the code on your cell phone looks like.
p318
aVThis is what I'm after in the end,
p319
aVbut this is its visual abstraction.
p320
aVIf I can find this, I can't make the phone explode.
p321
aVI could spend weeks trying to find this
p322
aVin ones and zeros,
p323
aVbut it takes me seconds to pick out
p324
aVa visual abstraction like this.
p325
aa(lp326
VOne of those most remarkable parts about all of this
p327
aVis it gives us an entirely new way to understand
p328
aVnew information, stuff that we haven't seen before.
p329
aVSo I know what English looks like at a binary level,
p330
aVand I know what its visual abstraction looks like,
p331
aVbut I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life.
p332
aVIt would take me weeks just to figure out
p333
aVwhat I was looking at from raw ones and zeros,
p334
aVbut because our brains can instantly pick up
p335
aVand recognize these subtle patterns inside
p336
aVof these visual abstractions,
p337
aVwe can unconsciously apply those
p338
aVin new situations.
p339
aVSo this is what Russian looks like
p340
aVin a visual abstraction.
p341
aVBecause I know what one language looks like,
p342
aVI can recognize other languages
p343
aVeven when I'm not familiar with them.
p344
aVThis is what a photograph looks like,
p345
aVbut this is what clip art looks like.
p346
aVThis is what the code on your phone looks like,
p347
aVbut this is what the code on your computer looks like.
p348
aVOur brains can pick up on these patterns
p349
aVin ways that we never could have
p350
aVfrom looking at raw ones and zeros.
p351
aVBut we've really only scratched the surface
p352
aVof what we can do with this approach.
p353
aVWe've only begun to unlock the capabilities
p354
aVof our minds to process visual information.
p355
aVIf we take those same concepts and translate them
p356
aVinto three dimensions instead,
p357
aVwe find entirely new ways of making sense of information.
p358
aVIn seconds, we can pick out every pattern here.
p359
aVwe can see the cross associated with code.
p360
aVWe can see cubes associated with text.
p361
aVWe can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts.
p362
aVThings that would take us weeks,
p363
aVmonths to find in ones and zeroes,
p364
aVare immediately apparent
p365
aVin some sort of visual abstraction,
p366
aVand as we continue to go through this
p367
aVand throw more and more information at it,
p368
aVwhat we find is that we're capable of processing
p369
aVbillions of ones and zeros
p370
aVin a matter of seconds
p371
aVjust by using our brain's built-in ability
p372
aVto analyze patterns.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo this is really nice and helpful,
p375
aVbut all this tells me is what I'm looking at.
p376
aVSo at this point, based on visual patterns,
p377
aVI can find the code on the phone.
p378
aVBut that's not enough to blow up a battery.
p379
aVThe next thing I need to find is the code
p380
aVthat controls the battery, but we're back
p381
aVto the needle in a stack of needles problem.
p382
aVThat code looks pretty much like all the other code
p383
aVon that system.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo I might not be able to find the code that controls the battery,
p386
aVbut there's a lot of things that are very similar to that.
p387
aVYou have code that controls your screen,
p388
aVthat controls your buttons, that controls your microphones,
p389
aVso even if I can't find the code for the battery,
p390
aVI bet I can find one of those things.
p391
aVSo the next step in my binary analysis process
p392
aVis to look at pieces of information
p393
aVthat are similar to each other.
p394
aVIt's really, really hard to do at a binary level,
p395
aVbut if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead,
p396
aVI don't even have to sift through the raw data.
p397
aVAll I have to do is wait for the image to light up
p398
aVto see when I'm at similar pieces.
p399
aVI follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs
p400
aVto find exactly what I'm looking for.
p401
aa(lp402
VSo at this point in the process,
p403
aVI've located the code
p404
aVresponsible for controlling your battery,
p405
aVbut that's still not enough to blow up a phone.
p406
aVThe last piece of the puzzle
p407
aVis understanding how that code
p408
aVcontrols your battery.
p409
aVFor this, I need to identify
p410
aVvery subtle, very detailed relationships
p411
aVwithin that binary information,
p412
aVanother very hard thing to do
p413
aVwhen looking at ones and zeros.
p414
aVBut if we translate that information
p415
aVinto a physical representation,
p416
aVwe can sit back and let our visual cortex do all the hard work.
p417
aVIt can find all the detailed patterns,
p418
aVall the important pieces, for us.
p419
aVIt can find out exactly how the pieces of that code
p420
aVwork together to control that battery.
p421
aVAll of this can be done in a matter of hours,
p422
aVwhereas the same process
p423
aVwould have taken months in the past.
p424
aa(lp425
VThis is all well and good
p426
aVin a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation.
p427
aVI wanted to find out if this would really work
p428
aVin the work I do every day.
p429
aVSo I was playing around with these same concepts
p430
aVwith some of the data I've looked at in the past,
p431
aVand yet again, I was trying to find
p432
aVa very detailed, specific piece of code
p433
aVinside of a massive piece of binary information.
p434
aVSo I looked at it at this level,
p435
aVthinking I was looking at the right thing,
p436
aVonly to see this doesn't have
p437
aVthe connectivity I would have expected
p438
aVfor the code I was looking for.
p439
aVIn fact, I'm not really sure what this is,
p440
aVbut when I stepped back a level
p441
aVand looked at the similarities within the code
p442
aVI saw, this doesn't have similarities
p443
aVlike any code that exists out there.
p444
aVI can't even be looking at code.
p445
aVIn fact, from this perspective,
p446
aVI could tell, this isn't code.
p447
aVThis is an image of some sort.
p448
aVAnd from here, I can see,
p449
aVit's not just an image, this is a photograph.
p450
aVNow that I know it's a photograph,
p451
aVI've got dozens of other binary translation techniques
p452
aVto visualize and understand that information,
p453
aVso in a matter of seconds, we can take this information,
p454
aVshove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques
p455
aVin order to find out exactly what we were looking at.
p456
aVI saw \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p457
aVit was that darn kitten again.
p458
aVAll this is enabled
p459
aVbecause we were able to find a way
p460
aVto translate a very hard problem
p461

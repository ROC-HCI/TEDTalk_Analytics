VToday, I am going to talk about anger.
p5
aVWhen I was 11,
p6
aVseeing some of my friends  leaving the school
p7
aVbecause their parents  could not afford textbooks
p8
aVmade me angry.
p9
aVWhen I was 27,
p10
aVhearing the plight of a desperate slave father
p11
aVwhose daughter was  about to be sold to a brothel
p12
aVmade me angry.
p13
aVAt the age of 50,
p14
aVlying on the street, in a pool of blood,
p15
aValong with my own son,
p16
aVmade me angry.
p17
aa(lp18
VDear friends, for centuries we were taught anger is bad.
p19
aVOur parents, teachers, priests \u2014
p20
aVeveryone taught us how to control  and suppress our anger.
p21
aVBut I ask why?
p22
aVWhy can't we convert our anger for the larger good of society?
p23
aVWhy can't we use our anger
p24
aVto challenge and change the evils of the world?
p25
aVThat I tried to do.
p26
aa(lp27
VFriends,
p28
aVmost of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger.
p29
aVLike when I was 35 and sat  in a locked-up, tiny prison.
p30
aVThe whole night, I was angry.
p31
aVBut it has given birth to a new idea.
p32
aVBut I will come to that later on.
p33
aVLet me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself.
p34
aa(lp35
VI had been a big admirer  of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.
p36
aVGandhi fought and lead  India's freedom movement.
p37
aVBut more importantly,
p38
aVhe taught us how to treat  the most vulnerable sections,
p39
aVthe most deprived people,  with dignity and respect.
p40
aVAnd so, when India was celebrating
p41
aVMahatma Gandhi's  birth centenary in 1969 \u2014
p42
aVat that time I was 15 \u2014
p43
aVan idea came to my mind.
p44
aVWhy can't we celebrate it differently?
p45
aVI knew, as perhaps many of you might know,
p46
aVthat in India, a large number of people are born in the lowest segment of caste.
p47
aVAnd they are treated as untouchables.
p48
aVThese are the people \u2014
p49
aVforget about allowing them  to go to the temples,
p50
aVthey cannot even go into the houses  and shops of high-caste people.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo I was very impressed with  the leaders of my town
p53
aVwho were speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability
p54
aVand talking of Gandhian ideals.
p55
aVSo inspired by that, I thought, let us set an example
p56
aVby inviting these people to eat food cooked and served
p57
aVby the untouchable community.
p58
aVI went to some low-caste, so-called untouchable, people,
p59
aVtried to convince them, but it was unthinkable for them.
p60
aVThey told me, "No, no. It's not possible. It never happened."
p61
aVI said, "Look at these leaders,
p62
aVthey are so great,  they are against untouchability.
p63
aVThey will come. If nobody comes,  we can set an example."
p64
aVThese people thought that I was too naive.
p65
aVFinally, they were convinced.
p66
aa(lp67
VMy friends and I took our bicycles and invited political leaders.
p68
aVAnd I was so thrilled, rather, empowered
p69
aVto see that each one of them  agreed to come.
p70
aVI thought, "Great idea. We can set an example.
p71
aVWe can bring about change in the society."
p72
aa(lp73
VThe day has come.
p74
aVAll these untouchables, three women and two men,
p75
aVthey agreed to come.
p76
aVI could recall that they had used  the best of their clothes.
p77
aVThey brought new utensils.
p78
aVThey had taken baths  hundreds of times
p79
aVbecause it was unthinkable for them to do.
p80
aVIt was the moment of change.
p81
aVThey gathered. Food was cooked.
p82
aVIt was 7 o'clock.
p83
aVBy 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,
p84
aVbecause it's not very uncommon  that the leaders become late,
p85
aVfor an hour or so.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles and went to these leaders' homes,
p88
aVjust to remind them.
p89
aVOne of the leader's wives told me,
p90
aV"Sorry, he is having some headache, perhaps he cannot come."
p91
aVI went to another leader
p92
aVand his wife told me,  "Okay, you go, he will definitely join."
p93
aVSo I thought that the dinner will take place,
p94
aVthough not at that large a scale.
p95
aa(lp96
VI went back to the venue, which was a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.
p97
aVIt was 10 o'clock.
p98
aVNone of the leaders showed up.
p99
aVThat made me angry.
p100
aVI was standing, leaning against Mahatma Gandhi's statue.
p101
aVI was emotionally drained, rather exhausted.
p102
aVThen I sat down where  the food was lying.
p103
aVI kept my emotions on hold.
p104
aVBut then, when I took the first bite,
p105
aVI broke down in tears.
p106
aVAnd suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.
p107
aVAnd it was the healing, motherly touch  of an untouchable woman.
p108
aVAnd she told me, "Kailash, why are you crying?
p109
aVYou have done your bit.
p110
aVYou have eaten the food cooked by untouchables,
p111
aVwhich has never happened in our memory."
p112
aVShe said, "You won today."
p113
aVAnd my friends, she was right.
p114
aa(lp115
VI came back home, a little after midnight,
p116
aVshocked to see that several  high-caste elderly people
p117
aVwere sitting in my courtyard.
p118
aVI saw my mother and  elderly women were crying
p119
aVand they were pleading  to these elderly people
p120
aVbecause they had threatened  to outcaste my whole family.
p121
aVAnd you know, outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment
p122
aVone can think of.
p123
aVSomehow they agreed to punish only me, and the punishment was purification.
p124
aVThat means I had to go 600 miles away from my hometown
p125
aVto the River Ganges to take a holy dip.
p126
aVAnd after that, I should organize a feast for priests, 101 priests,
p127
aVwash their feet and drink that water.
p128
aa(lp129
VIt was total nonsense,
p130
aVand I refused to accept that punishment.
p131
aVHow did they punish me?
p132
aVI was barred from entering into my own  kitchen and my own dining room,
p133
aVmy utensils were separated.
p134
aVBut the night when I was angry, they wanted to outcaste me.
p135
aVBut I decided to outcaste  the entire caste system.
p136
aV(Applause)
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd that was possible because the beginning would have been
p139
aVto change the family name, or surname,
p140
aVbecause in India, most of the family names are caste names.
p141
aVSo I decided to drop my name.
p142
aVAnd then, later on, I gave  a new name to myself: Satyarthi,
p143
aVthat means, "seeker of truth."
p144
aV(Applause)
p145
aVAnd that was the beginning  of my transformative anger.
p146
aa(lp147
VFriends, maybe one of you can tell me,
p148
aVwhat was I doing before becoming a children's rights activist?
p149
aVDoes anybody know?
p150
aVNo.
p151
aVI was an engineer, an electrical engineer.
p152
aVAnd then I learned how the energy
p153
aVof burning fire, coal,
p154
aVthe nuclear blast inside the chambers,
p155
aVraging river currents,
p156
aVfierce winds,
p157
aVcould be converted into the light  and lives of millions.
p158
aVI also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy
p159
aVcould be harnessed for good  and making society better.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo I'll come back to the story of when I was caught in the prison:
p162
aVI was very happy freeing  a dozen children from slavery,
p163
aVhanding them over to their parents.
p164
aVI cannot explain my joy  when I free a child.
p165
aVI was so happy.
p166
aVBut when I was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown, Delhi,
p167
aVI saw that dozens of children  were arriving;
p168
aVthey were being trafficked by someone.
p169
aVI stopped them, those people.
p170
aVI complained to the police.
p171
aVSo the policemen, instead of helping me,
p172
aVthey threw me in this small,  tiny shell, like an animal.
p173
aVAnd that was the night of anger
p174
aVwhen one of the brightest  and biggest ideas was born.
p175
aVI thought that if I keep on freeing 10  children, and 50 more will join,
p176
aVthat's not done.
p177
aVAnd I believed in the power of consumers,
p178
aVand let me tell you that this was the first time
p179
aVwhen a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world,
p180
aVto educate and sensitize the consumers
p181
aVto create a demand for child-labor-free rugs.
p182
aVIn Europe and America,  we have been successful.
p183
aVAnd it has resulted  in a fall in child labor
p184
aVin South Asian countries by 80 percent.
p185
aV(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VNot only that, but this first-ever  consumer's power, or consumer's campaign
p188
aVhas grown in other countries and other industries,
p189
aVmaybe chocolate, maybe apparel,  maybe shoes \u2014 it has gone beyond.
p190
aVMy anger at the age of 11,
p191
aVwhen I realized how important education is for every child,
p192
aVI got an idea to collect used books and help the poorest children.
p193
aVI created a book bank at the age of 11.
p194
aVBut I did not stop.
p195
aVLater on, I cofounded
p196
aVthe world's single largest civil society campaign for education
p197
aVthat is the Global Campaign for Education.
p198
aVThat has helped in changing  the whole thinking towards education
p199
aVfrom the charity mode to the human rights mode,
p200
aVand that has concretely helped  the reduction of out-of-school children
p201
aVby half in the last 15 years.
p202
aV(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VMy anger at the age of 27,
p205
aVto free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel,
p206
aVhas given me an idea
p207
aVto go for a new strategy of raid and rescue,
p208
aVfreeing children from slavery.
p209
aVAnd I am so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or 10 or 20,
p210
aVbut my colleagues and I have been able to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves
p211
aVand hand them over back to their families and mothers.
p212
aV(Applause)
p213
aa(lp214
VI knew that we needed global policies.
p215
aVWe organized the worldwide marches against child labor
p216
aVand that has also resulted in  a new international convention
p217
aVto protect the children who are in the worst forms.
p218
aVAnd the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally
p219
aVhas gone down by one third  in the last 15 years.
p220
aV(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VSo, in each case,
p223
aVit began from anger,
p224
aVturned into an idea,
p225
aVand action.
p226
aVSo anger, what next?
p227
aVIdea, and \u2014
p228
aVAudience: Action
p229
aVKailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action. Which I tried to do.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnger is a power, anger is an energy,
p232
aVand the law of nature is that energy
p233
aVcan never be created and never  be vanished, can never be destroyed.
p234
aVSo why can't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed
p235
aVto create a better and beautiful world, a more just and equitable world?
p236
aa(lp237
VAnger is within each one of you,
p238
aVand I will share a secret for a few seconds:
p239
aVthat if we are confined in  the narrow shells of egos,
p240
aVand the circles of selfishness,
p241
aVthen the anger will turn out to be hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.
p242
aVBut if we are able to break the circles,
p243
aVthen the same anger could turn  into a great power.
p244
aVWe can break the circles  by using our inherent compassion
p245
aVand connect with the world through  compassion to make this world better.
p246
aVThat same anger could be transformed into it.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo dear friends, sisters and brothers, again, as a Nobel Laureate,
p249
aVI am urging you to become angry.
p250
aVI am urging you to become angry.
p251
aVAnd the angriest among us
p252
aVis the one who can transform his anger  into idea and action.
p253
aa(lp254
VThank you so much.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VChris Anderson: For many years,  you've been an inspiration to others.
p259
aVWho or what inspires you and why?
p260
aa(lp261
VKS: Good question.
p262
aVChris, let me tell you,  and that is the truth,
p263
aVeach time when I free a child,
p264
aVthe child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother,
p265
aVthe first smile of freedom,
p266
aVand the mother who has lost all hope
p267
aVthat the son or daughter  can ever come back and sit in her lap,
p268
aVthey become so emotional
p269
aVand the first tear of joy  rolls down on her cheek,
p270
aVI see the glimpse of God in it \u2014 this is my biggest inspiration.
p271
aVAnd I am so lucky that not once, as I said before, but thousands of times,
p272
aVI have been able to witness my God in the faces of those children
p273
aVand they are my biggest inspirations.
p274
aVThank you.
p275
aa(lp276

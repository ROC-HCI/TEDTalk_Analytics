VOne of the biggest challenges in computer graphics
p5
aVhas been being able to create a photo-real,
p6
aVdigital human face.
p7
aVAnd one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs,
p8
aVwe look at human faces every day.
p9
aVThey are very important to how we communicate with each other.
p10
aVAs a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things
p11
aVthat could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,
p12
aVin order to believe whether these things are realistic.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd what I'm going to do in the next five minutes
p15
aVis take you through a process
p16
aVwhere we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,
p17
aVusing some computer graphics technology we've developed,
p18
aVand also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.
p19
aVAnd we're going to try to do a photo-real face
p20
aVof an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.
p21
aVAnd that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.
p22
aVBy the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.
p23
aa(lp24
VThe way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself,
p25
aVwho was gracious enough to come to our laboratory
p26
aVin Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.
p27
aVThis is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around
p28
aVthat allow us to photograph her
p29
aVin a series of very controlled illumination conditions.
p30
aVAnd the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.
p31
aVWe shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd we basically capture enough information
p34
aVwith video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,
p35
aVand different principle directions of light from the light stage,
p36
aVto figure out both the coarse-scale
p37
aVand the fine-scale detail of her face.
p38
aVIf we zoom in on this photograph right here,
p39
aVwe can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,
p40
aVbecause she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time
p41
aVto get a nice image of her facial texture.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights \u2014
p44
aVjust like polarized sunglasses can block
p45
aVthe glare off of the road,
p46
aVpolarizers can block the shine off of the skin,
p47
aVso we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.
p48
aVNow, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,
p49
aVwe can actually bring that specular reflection
p50
aVof the skin back in,
p51
aVand you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.
p52
aVIf you take the difference between these two images here,
p53
aVyou can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light
p54
aVof just the shine off of Emily's skin.
p55
aa(lp56
VI don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken
p57
aVbefore we had done this.
p58
aVAnd this is very important light to capture,
p59
aVbecause this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.
p60
aVIt doesn't get underneath the translucent
p61
aVlayers of the skin and blur out.
p62
aVAnd, as a result, it's a very good cue
p63
aVto the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure
p64
aVand all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,
p65
aVthe things that actually make us look like real humans.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection,
p68
aVwe can go from a traditional face scan
p69
aVthat might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,
p70
aVand augment it with information
p71
aVthat puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.
p72
aVAnd, even more importantly,
p73
aVsince this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,
p74
aVwe can shoot Emily
p75
aVin just part of an afternoon,
p76
aVin many different facial poses and facial expressions.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.
p79
aVAnd these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.
p80
aVIf you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,
p81
aVyou can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things
p82
aVas it goes into different facial expressions.
p83
aVYou can see things. Not only the face shape changes,
p84
aVbut all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.
p85
aVYou can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously
p86
aVfrom stretched skin pores
p87
aVto the regular skin texture.
p88
aVYou can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.
p89
aVYou can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.
p90
aVHer muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.
p91
aa(lp92
VIn addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry,
p93
aVsince it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.
p94
aVAnd by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,
p95
aVthe red and the green and the blue,
p96
aVdiffuse the light differently,
p97
aVwe can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.
p98
aVThen, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,
p99
aVit actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd this is what we used
p102
aVto give to the company Image Metrics
p103
aVto create a rigged, digital version of Emily.
p104
aVWe're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.
p105
aVBut they basically created a digital puppet of her,
p106
aVwhere you can pull on these various strings,
p107
aVand it actually moves her face in ways that are
p108
aVcompletely consistent with the scans that we took.
p109
aVAnd, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,
p110
aVthey also used all of that detail
p111
aVto create a set of what are called "displacement maps"
p112
aVthat animate as well.
p113
aVThese are the displacement maps here.
p114
aVAnd you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo the next process was then to animate her.
p117
aVWe actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.
p118
aVSo, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,
p119
aVthey were able to drive the facial rig
p120
aVwith the computer-generated performance.
p121
aVSo what you're going to see now, after this,
p122
aVis a completely photo-real digital face.
p123
aVWe can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.
p124
aa(lp125
VEmily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.
p126
aVWe specialize in high-quality facial animation
p127
aVfor video games and films.
p128
aVImage Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.
p129
aVWe specialize in high quality facial animation
p130
aVfor video games and films.
p131
aa(lp132
VPaul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component
p133
aVwe saw in the first slide.
p134
aVHere is the specular component animating.
p135
aVYou can see all the wrinkles happening there.
p136
aVAnd there is the underlying wireframe mesh.
p137
aVAnd that is Emily herself.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, where are we going with this here?
p140
aVWe've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,
p141
aVand we're looking at taking this technology
p142
aVand applying it to whole human bodies.
p143
aVThis is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,
p144
aVwho graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.
p145
aVAnd let's take a look at a computer-generated version
p146
aVof Bruce, running in a new environment.
p147
aVAnd thank you very much.

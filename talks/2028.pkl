VToday,
p5
aVa baffled lady observed
p6
aVthe shell where my soul dwells
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd announced that I'm
p9
aV"articulate"
p10
aa(lp11
VWhich means that when it comes
p12
aVto enunciation and diction
p13
aa(lp14
VI don't even think of it
p15
aa(lp16
V\u2018Cause I\u2019m "articulate"
p17
aa(lp18
VSo when my professor asks a question
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd my answer is tainted with a connotation
p21
aVof urbanized suggestion
p22
aa(lp23
VThere\u2019s no misdirected intention
p24
aa(lp25
VPay attention
p26
aa(lp27
V\u2018Cause I\u2019m \u201carticulate\u201d
p28
aa(lp29
VSo when my father asks, \u201cWha\u2019 kinda ting is dis?\u201d
p30
aa(lp31
VMy \u201carticulate\u201d answer never goes amiss
p32
aa(lp33
VI say \u201cfather, this is the impending problem at hand\u201d
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd when I\u2019m on the block
p36
aVI switch it up just because I can
p37
aa(lp38
VSo when my boy says, \u201cWhat\u2019s good with you son?\u201d
p39
aa(lp40
VI just say, \u201cI jus\u2019 fall out wit dem people but I done!\u201d
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd sometimes in class
p43
aa(lp44
VI might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask
p45
aa(lp46
V\u201cYo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples\u201d
p47
aa(lp48
VYes, I have decided to treat
p49
aVall three of my languages as equals
p50
aa(lp51
VBecause I\u2019m \u201carticulate\u201d
p52
aa(lp53
VBut who controls articulation?
p54
aa(lp55
VBecause the English language is a multifaceted oration
p56
aa(lp57
VSubject to indefinite transformation
p58
aa(lp59
VNow you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English
p60
aa(lp61
VBut I\u2019m here to tell you that even \u201carticulate\u201d Americans
p62
aVsound foolish to the British
p63
aa(lp64
VSo when my Professor comes on the block and says, \u201cHello\u201d
p65
aa(lp66
VI stop him and say \u201cNoooo \u2026
p67
aa(lp68
VYou\u2019re being inarticulate \u2026
p69
aVthe proper way is to say \u2018what\u2019s good\u2019\u201d
p70
aa(lp71
VNow you may think that\u2019s too hood, that\u2019s not cool
p72
aa(lp73
VBut I\u2019m here to tell you that even our language has rules
p74
aa(lp75
VSo when Mommy mocks me and says
p76
aV\u201cya\u2019ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store\u201d
p77
aa(lp78
VI say \u201cMommy, no, that sentence is not following the law
p79
aa(lp80
VNever does the word "madd" go  before a present participle
p81
aa(lp82
VThat\u2019s simply the principle of this English\u201d
p83
aa(lp84
VIf I had the vocal capacity I would
p85
aVsing this from every mountaintop,
p86
aa(lp87
VFrom every suburbia, and every hood
p88
aa(lp89
V\u2018Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis
p90
aa(lp91
VOf this world saying \u201cit is good"
p92
aa(lp93
VSo I may not always come before you
p94
aVwith excellency of speech
p95
aa(lp96
VBut do not judge me by my language and assume
p97
aa(lp98
VThat I\u2019m too ignorant to teach
p99
aa(lp100
V\u2018Cause I speak three tongues
p101
aa(lp102
VOne for each:
p103
aa(lp104
VHome, school and friends
p105
aa(lp106
VI\u2019m a tri-lingual orator
p107
aa(lp108
VSometimes I\u2019m consistent with my language now
p109
aa(lp110
VThen switch it up so I don\u2019t bore later
p111
aa(lp112
VSometimes I fight back two tongues
p113
aa(lp114
VWhile I use the other one in the classroom
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd when I mistakenly mix them up
p117
aa(lp118
VI feel crazy like \u2026 I\u2019m cooking in the bathroom
p119
aa(lp120
VI know that I had to borrow your language
p121
aVbecause mines was stolen
p122
aa(lp123
VBut you can\u2019t expect me to speak your history wholly
p124
aVwhile mines is broken
p125
aa(lp126
VThese words are spoken
p127
aa(lp128
VBy someone who is simply fed up with
p129
aVthe Eurocentric ideals of this season
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd the reason I speak a composite version of your language
p132
aa(lp133
VIs because mines was raped away along with my history
p134
aa(lp135
VI speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us
p136
aa(lp137
VThat our current state is not a mystery
p138
aa(lp139
VI\u2019m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad
p140
aa(lp141
VSo unless you\u2019ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad
p142
aa(lp143
VI\u2019m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity
p144
aa(lp145
VSo don\u2019t call it good unless your hair is known
p146
aVfor donating to charity
p147
aa(lp148
VAs much as has been raped away from our people
p149
aa(lp150
VHow can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language
p151
aa(lp152
VAs anything less than equal
p153
aa(lp154
VLet there be no confusion
p155
aa(lp156
VLet there be no hesitation
p157
aa(lp158
VThis is not a promotion of ignorance
p159
aa(lp160
VThis is a linguistic celebration
p161
aa(lp162
VThat\u2019s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application
p163
aa(lp164
VI can help to diversify your consumer market
p165
aVis all I wanted them to know
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd when they call me for the interview
p168
aVI\u2019ll be more than happy to show that
p169
aa(lp170
VI can say:
p171
aa(lp172
V\u201cWhat\u2019s good\u201d
p173
aa(lp174
V\u201cWhatagwan\u201d
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd of course \u2026\u201cHello\u201d
p177
aa(lp178
VBecause I\u2019m \u201carticulate\u201d
p179
aa(lp180
VThank you.

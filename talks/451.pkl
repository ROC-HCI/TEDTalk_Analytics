VI wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,
p5
aVsharing some of the problems.
p6
aVAnd Warren Buffet had recommended I do that \u2014
p7
aVbeing honest about what was going well, what wasn't,
p8
aVand making it kind of an annual thing.
p9
aVA goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,
p10
aVbecause I think there are some very important problems
p11
aVthat don't get worked on naturally.
p12
aVThat is, the market does not drive the scientists,
p13
aVthe communicators, the thinkers, the governments
p14
aVto do the right things.
p15
aVAnd only by paying attention to these things
p16
aVand having brilliant people who care and draw other people in
p17
aVcan we make as much progress as we need to.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo this morning I'm going to share two of these problems
p20
aVand talk about where they stand.
p21
aVBut before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
p22
aVAny tough problem, I think it can be solved.
p23
aVAnd part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.
p24
aVOver the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.
p25
aVAnother statistic, perhaps my favorite,
p26
aVis to look at childhood deaths.
p27
aVAs recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,
p28
aVand 20 million of those died before the age of five.
p29
aVFive years ago, 135 million children were born \u2014 so, more \u2014
p30
aVand less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.
p31
aVSo that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.
p32
aVIt's a phenomenal thing.
p33
aVEach one of those lives matters a lot.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes
p36
aVbut also a few key breakthroughs:
p37
aVvaccines that were used more widely.
p38
aVFor example, measles was four million of the deaths
p39
aVback as recently as 1990
p40
aVand now is under 400,000.
p41
aVSo we really can make changes.
p42
aVThe next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.
p43
aVAnd I think that's doable in well under 20 years.
p44
aVWhy? Well there's only a few diseases
p45
aVthat account for the vast majority of those deaths:
p46
aVdiarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,
p49
aVwhich is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?
p50
aa(lp51
VWell, what's the history of this disease?
p52
aVIt's been a severe disease for thousands of years.
p53
aVIn fact, if we look at the genetic code,
p54
aVit's the only disease we can see
p55
aVthat people who lived in Africa
p56
aVactually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.
p57
aVDeaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.
p58
aVSo it was absolutely gigantic.
p59
aVAnd the disease was all over the world.
p60
aVA terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.
p61
aVPeople didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,
p62
aVwhen a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.
p63
aVSo it was everywhere.
p64
aVAnd two tools helped bring the death rate down.
p65
aVOne was killing the mosquitos with DDT.
p66
aVThe other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.
p67
aVAnd so that's why the death rate did come down.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, ironically, what happened was
p70
aVit was eliminated from all the temperate zones,
p71
aVwhich is where the rich countries are.
p72
aVSo we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
p73
aV1945, it's still most places.
p74
aV1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
p75
aV1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
p76
aVAnd more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd so this leads to the paradox that
p79
aVbecause the disease is only in the poorer countries,
p80
aVit doesn't get much investment.
p81
aVFor example, there's more money put into baldness drugs
p82
aVthan are put into malaria.
p83
aVNow, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVAnd rich men are afflicted.
p86
aVAnd so that's why that priority has been set.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut, malaria \u2014
p89
aVeven the million deaths a year caused by malaria
p90
aVgreatly understate its impact.
p91
aVOver 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.
p92
aVIt means that you can't get the economies in these areas going
p93
aVbecause it just holds things back so much.
p94
aVNow, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.
p95
aVI brought some here, just so you could experience this.
p96
aVWe'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVThere's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
p99
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p100
aVThose mosquitos are not infected.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.
p103
aVAnd bed nets are a great tool.
p104
aVWhat it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,
p105
aVso the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.
p106
aVAnd when you use indoor spraying with DDT
p107
aVand those nets
p108
aVyou can cut deaths by over 50 percent.
p109
aVAnd that's happened now in a number of countries.
p110
aVIt's great to see.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut we have to be careful because malaria \u2014
p113
aVthe parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.
p114
aVSo every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.
p115
aVAnd so you end up with two choices.
p116
aVIf you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,
p117
aVyou do it vigorously,
p118
aVyou can actually get a local eradication.
p119
aVAnd that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.
p120
aVOr, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,
p121
aVfor a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,
p122
aVbut eventually those tools will become ineffective,
p123
aVand the death rate will soar back up again.
p124
aVAnd the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow we're on the upswing.
p127
aVBed net funding is up.
p128
aVThere's new drug discovery going on.
p129
aVOur foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial
p130
aVthat starts in a couple months.
p131
aVAnd that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.
p132
aVSo we're going to have these new tools.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut that alone doesn't give us the road map.
p135
aVBecause the road map to get rid of this disease
p136
aVinvolves many things.
p137
aVIt involves communicators to keep the funding high,
p138
aVto keep the visibility high,
p139
aVto tell the success stories.
p140
aVIt involves social scientists,
p141
aVso we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,
p142
aVbut 90 percent.
p143
aVWe need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,
p144
aVto do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.
p145
aVOf course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.
p146
aVWe need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.
p147
aVAnd so as these elements come together,
p148
aVI'm quite optimistic
p149
aVthat we will be able to eradicate malaria.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow let me turn to a second question,
p152
aVa fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.
p153
aVAnd this is: How do you make a teacher great?
p154
aVIt seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,
p155
aVand we'd understand very well.
p156
aVAnd the answer is, really, that we don't.
p157
aVLet's start with why this is important.
p158
aVWell, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.
p159
aVWe all had a wonderful education.
p160
aVThat's part of the reason we're here today,
p161
aVpart of the reason we're successful.
p162
aVI can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.
p163
aVI had great teachers.
p164
aa(lp165
VIn fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.
p166
aVThere are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.
p167
aVSo the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.
p168
aVAnd those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,
p169
aVif you measure them against the other top 20 percent.
p170
aVAnd they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology
p171
aVand keep the U.S. at the forefront.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, the strength for those top 20 percent
p174
aVis starting to fade on a relative basis,
p175
aVbut even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.
p176
aVNot only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
p177
aVAnd if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now
p178
aVto people with a better education.
p179
aVAnd we have to change this.
p180
aVWe have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.
p181
aVWe have to change it so that the country is strong
p182
aVand stays at the forefront
p183
aVof things that are driven by advanced education,
p184
aVlike science and mathematics.
p185
aa(lp186
VWhen I first learned the statistics,
p187
aVI was pretty stunned at how bad things are.
p188
aVOver 30 percent of kids never finish high school.
p189
aVAnd that had been covered up for a long time
p190
aVbecause they always took the dropout rate as the number
p191
aVwho started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.
p192
aVBecause they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.
p193
aVBut most of the dropouts had taken place before that.
p194
aVThey had to raise the stated dropout rate
p195
aVas soon as that tracking was done
p196
aVto over 30 percent.
p197
aVFor minority kids, it's over 50 percent.
p198
aVAnd even if you graduate from high school,
p199
aVif you're low-income,
p200
aVyou have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.
p201
aVIf you're low-income in the United States,
p202
aVyou have a higher chance of going to jail
p203
aVthan you do of getting a four-year degree.
p204
aVAnd that doesn't seem entirely fair.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo, how do you make education better?
p207
aa(lp208
VNow, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.
p209
aVThere's many people working on it.
p210
aVWe've worked on small schools,
p211
aVwe've funded scholarships,
p212
aVwe've done things in libraries.
p213
aVA lot of these things had a good effect.
p214
aVBut the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers
p215
aVwas the very key thing.
p216
aVAnd we hooked up with some people studying
p217
aVhow much variation is there between teachers,
p218
aVbetween, say, the top quartile \u2014 the very best \u2014
p219
aVand the bottom quartile.
p220
aVHow much variation is there within a school or between schools?
p221
aVAnd the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.
p222
aVA top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class \u2014
p223
aVbased on test scores \u2014
p224
aVby over 10 percent in a single year.
p225
aVWhat does that mean?
p226
aVThat means that if the entire U.S., for two years,
p227
aVhad top quartile teachers,
p228
aVthe entire difference between us and Asia would go away.
p229
aVWithin four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.
p232
aVAnd so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.
p233
aVWe should retain those people.
p234
aVWe should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."
p235
aVBut I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.
p236
aa(lp237
VWhat are the characteristics of this top quartile?
p238
aVWhat do they look like?
p239
aVYou might think these must be very senior teachers.
p240
aVAnd the answer is no.
p241
aVOnce somebody has taught for three years
p242
aVtheir teaching quality does not change thereafter.
p243
aVThe variation is very, very small.
p244
aVYou might think these are people with master's degrees.
p245
aVThey've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
p246
aVThis chart takes four different factors
p247
aVand says how much do they explain teaching quality.
p248
aVThat bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,
p249
aVis a master's degree.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.
p252
aVOne is seniority.
p253
aVBecause your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
p254
aVThe second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
p255
aVBut it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
p256
aVTeach for America: slight effect.
p257
aVFor math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
p258
aVBut, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
p259
aVThere are some people who are very good at this.
p260
aVAnd we've done almost nothing
p261
aVto study what that is
p262
aVand to draw it in and to replicate it,
p263
aVto raise the average capability \u2014
p264
aVor to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
p265
aa(lp266
VYou might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"
p267
aVThe answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
p268
aVAnd it's a system with very high turnover.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow, there are a few places \u2014 very few \u2014 where great teachers are being made.
p271
aVA good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
p272
aVKIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
p273
aVIt's an unbelievable thing.
p274
aVThey have 66 schools \u2014 mostly middle schools, some high schools \u2014
p275
aVand what goes on is great teaching.
p276
aVThey take the poorest kids,
p277
aVand over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
p278
aVAnd the whole spirit and attitude in those schools
p279
aVis very different than in the normal public schools.
p280
aVThey're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.
p281
aVThey're taking data, the test scores,
p282
aVand saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."
p283
aVThey're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
p284
aa(lp285
VWhen you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,
p286
aVat first it's very bizarre.
p287
aVI sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"
p288
aVThe teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.
p289
aVI thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.
p290
aVWhat's going on?"
p291
aVAnd the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,
p292
aVwhich kids were bored,
p293
aVand calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.
p294
aVIt was a very dynamic environment,
p295
aVbecause particularly in those middle school years \u2014 fifth through eighth grade \u2014
p296
aVkeeping people engaged and setting the tone
p297
aVthat everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,
p298
aVnobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.
p299
aVEverybody needs to be involved.
p300
aVAnd so KIPP is doing it.
p301
aa(lp302
VHow does that compare to a normal school?
p303
aVWell, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.
p304
aVThe data isn't gathered.
p305
aVIn the teacher's contract,
p306
aVit will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom \u2014
p307
aVsometimes to once per year.
p308
aVAnd they need advanced notice to do that.
p309
aVSo imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,
p310
aVsome of them just making crap
p311
aVand the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,
p312
aVbut you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,
p313
aVand try and do a good job in that one brief moment."
p314
aa(lp315
VEven a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.
p316
aVThey don't have the test scores,
p317
aVand there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.
p318
aVFor example, New York passed a law
p319
aVthat said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used
p320
aVin the tenure decision for the teachers.
p321
aVAnd so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.
p322
aVBut I'm optimistic about this,
p323
aVI think there are some clear things we can do.
p324
aa(lp325
VFirst of all, there's a lot more testing going on,
p326
aVand that's given us the picture of where we are.
p327
aVAnd that allows us to understand who's doing it well,
p328
aVand call them out, and find out what those techniques are.
p329
aVOf course, digital video is cheap now.
p330
aVPutting a few cameras in the classroom
p331
aVand saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis
p332
aVis very practical in all public schools.
p333
aVAnd so every few weeks teachers could sit down
p334
aVand say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.
p335
aVHere's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.
p336
aVAdvise me \u2014 when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"
p337
aVAnd they could all sit and work together on those problems.
p338
aVYou can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,
p339
aVhave it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
p340
aa(lp341
VYou can take those great courses and make them available
p342
aVso that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
p343
aVIf you have a kid who's behind,
p344
aVyou would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.
p345
aVAnd in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,
p346
aVbut you could make it so that DVDs were always available,
p347
aVand so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.
p348
aVAnd so by thinking of this as a personnel system,
p349
aVwe can do it much better.
p350
aa(lp351
VNow there's a book actually, about KIPP \u2014
p352
aVthe place that this is going on \u2014
p353
aVthat Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote \u2014 called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."
p354
aVAnd I thought it was so fantastic.
p355
aVIt gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
p356
aVI'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
p357
aV(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VNow, we put a lot of money into education,
p360
aVand I really think that education is the most important thing to get right
p361
aVfor the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
p362
aVIn fact we have in the stimulus bill \u2014 it's interesting \u2014
p363
aVthe House version actually had money in it for these data systems,
p364
aVand it was taken out in the Senate
p365
aVbecause there are people who are threatened by these things.
p366
aa(lp367
VBut I \u2014 I'm optimistic.
p368
aVI think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,
p369
aVand it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.
p370
aVI only had time to frame those two problems.
p371
aVThere's a lot more problems like that \u2014
p372
aVAIDS, pneumonia \u2014 I can just see you're getting excited,
p373
aVjust at the very name of these things.
p374
aVAnd the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.
p375
aVYou know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.
p376
aVGovernments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.
p377
aVThe private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo it's going to take brilliant people like you
p380
aVto study these things, get other people involved \u2014
p381
aVand you're helping to come up with solutions.
p382
aVAnd with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.
p383
aa(lp384
VThank you.

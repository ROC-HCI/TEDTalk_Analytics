VBefore March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher
p5
aVbased in New York City.
p6
aVWe're pale, gray creatures.
p7
aVWe hide in dark, windowless rooms,
p8
aVand generally avoid sunlight.
p9
aVWe make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect,
p10
aVand the impossible possible,
p11
aVand we get criticized in the press all the time,
p12
aVbut some of us are actually talented artists
p13
aVwith years of experience
p14
aVand a real appreciation for images and photography.
p15
aa(lp16
VOn March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest
p17
aVof the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan.
p18
aVSoon after, an organization I volunteer with,
p19
aVAll Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days,
p20
aVworking as part of the response efforts.
p21
aVI, along with hundreds of other volunteers,
p22
aVknew we couldn't just sit at home,
p23
aVso I decided to join them for three weeks.
p24
aa(lp25
VOn May the 13th, I made my way to the town of \u014cfunato.
p26
aVIt's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture,
p27
aVabout 50,000 people,
p28
aVone of the first that was hit by the wave.
p29
aVThe waters here have been recorded at reaching
p30
aVover 24 meters in height,
p31
aVand traveled over two miles inland.
p32
aVAs you can imagine, the town had been devastated.
p33
aa(lp34
VWe pulled debris from canals and ditches.
p35
aVWe cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes
p36
aVready for renovation and rehabilitation.
p37
aVWe cleared tons and tons of stinking, rotting fish carcasses
p38
aVfrom the local fish processing plant.
p39
aVWe got dirty, and we loved it.
p40
aa(lp41
VFor weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike
p42
aVhad been finding similar things.
p43
aVThey'd been finding photos and photo albums
p44
aVand cameras and SD cards.
p45
aVAnd everyone was doing the same.
p46
aVThey were collecting them up, and handing them in to
p47
aVvarious places around the different towns for safekeeping.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, it wasn't until this point that I realized
p50
aVthat these photos were such a huge part
p51
aVof the personal loss these people had felt.
p52
aVAs they had run from the wave, and for their lives,
p53
aVabsolutely everything they had,
p54
aVeverything had to be left behind.
p55
aa(lp56
VAt the end of my first week there, I found myself
p57
aVhelping out in an evacuation center in the town.
p58
aVI was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen,
p59
aVthe huge giant bathtubs.
p60
aVThis happened to also be a place in the town where
p61
aVthe evacuation center was collecting the photos.
p62
aVThis is where people were handing them in,
p63
aVand I was honored that day that they actually trusted me
p64
aVto help them start hand-cleaning them.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, it was emotional and it was inspiring,
p67
aVand I've always heard about thinking outside the box,
p68
aVbut it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box
p69
aVthat something happened.
p70
aVAs I looked through the photos, there were some
p71
aVwere over a hundred years old,
p72
aVsome still in the envelope from the processing lab,
p73
aVI couldn't help but think as a retoucher
p74
aVthat I could fix that tear and mend that scratch,
p75
aVand I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
p76
aVSo that evening, I just reached out on Facebook
p77
aVand asked a few of them, and by morning
p78
aVthe response had been so overwhelming and so positive,
p79
aVI knew we had to give it a go.
p80
aVSo we started retouching photos.
p81
aa(lp82
VThis was the very first.
p83
aVNot terribly damaged, but where the water had caused
p84
aVthat discoloration on the girl's face
p85
aVhad to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy.
p86
aVOtherwise, that little girl isn't going to look
p87
aVlike that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic
p88
aVas having the photo damaged.
p89
aV(Applause)
p90
aa(lp91
VOver time, more photos came in, thankfully,
p92
aVand more retouchers were needed,
p93
aVand so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn,
p94
aVand within five days, 80 people wanted to help
p95
aVfrom 12 different countries.
p96
aVWithin two weeks, I had 150 people
p97
aVwanting to join in.
p98
aVWithin Japan, by July, we'd branched out
p99
aVto the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata,
p100
aVfurther north to a town called Yamada.
p101
aVOnce a week, we would set up our scanning equipment
p102
aVin the temporary photo libraries that had been set up,
p103
aVwhere people were reclaiming their photos.
p104
aVThe older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before,
p105
aVbut within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo,
p106
aVthey could give it to us, have it scanned,
p107
aVuploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded
p108
aVby a gaijin, a stranger,
p109
aVsomewhere on the other side of the globe,
p110
aVand it'd start being fixed.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe time it took, however, to get it back
p113
aVis a completely different story,
p114
aVand it depended obviously on the damage involved.
p115
aVIt could take an hour. It could take weeks.
p116
aVIt could take months.
p117
aVThe kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn,
p118
aVor pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color
p119
aVand detail that the water hadn't damaged.
p120
aVIt was very time-consuming.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, all these photos had been damaged by water,
p123
aVsubmerged in salt water, covered in bacteria,
p124
aVin sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time
p125
aVis going to continue to damage them,
p126
aVso hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project.
p127
aVWe couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned,
p128
aVdry and reclaimed.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning.
p131
aVWe had an amazing local woman who guided us.
p132
aVIt's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos.
p133
aVAs my team leader Wynne once said,
p134
aVit's like doing a tattoo on someone.
p135
aVYou don't get a chance to mess it up.
p136
aa(lp137
VThe lady who brought us these photos was lucky,
p138
aVas far as the photos go.
p139
aVShe had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped
p140
aVwhen she realized she was doing more damage.
p141
aVShe also had duplicates.
p142
aVAreas like her husband and her face, which otherwise
p143
aVwould have been completely impossible to fix,
p144
aVwe could just put them together in one good photo,
p145
aVand remake the whole photo.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhen she collected the photos from us,
p148
aVshe shared a bit of her story with us.
p149
aVHer photos were found by her husband's colleagues
p150
aVat a local fire department in the debris
p151
aVa long way from where the home had once stood,
p152
aVand they'd recognized him.
p153
aVThe day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge
p154
aVof making sure the tsunami gates were closed.
p155
aVHe had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded.
p156
aVHer two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys
p157
aVwere both at school, separate schools.
p158
aVOne of them got caught up in the water.
p159
aVIt took her a week to find them all again
p160
aVand find out that they had all survived.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe day I gave her the photos also happened to be
p163
aVher youngest son's 14th birthday.
p164
aVFor her, despite all of this, those photos
p165
aVwere the perfect gift back to him,
p166
aVsomething he could look at again, something he remembered from before
p167
aVthat wasn't still scarred from that day in March
p168
aVwhen absolutely everything else in his life had changed
p169
aVor been destroyed.
p170
aa(lp171
VAfter six months in Japan,
p172
aV1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands,
p173
aVhundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean
p174
aVover 135,000 photographs,
p175
aVthe large majority \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p176
aVa large majority of which did actually find their home again,
p177
aVimportantly.
p178
aVOver five hundred volunteers around the globe
p179
aVhelped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back,
p180
aVfully restored and retouched.
p181
aVDuring this time, we hadn't really spent more than
p182
aVabout a thousand dollars in equipment and materials,
p183
aVmost of which was printer inks.
p184
aa(lp185
VWe take photos constantly.
p186
aVA photo is a reminder of someone or something,
p187
aVa place, a relationship, a loved one.
p188
aVThey're our memory-keepers and our histories,
p189
aVthe last thing we would grab
p190
aVand the first thing you'd go back to look for.
p191
aVThat's all this project was about,
p192
aVabout restoring those little bits of humanity,
p193
aVgiving someone that connection back.
p194
aa(lp195
VWhen a photo like this can be returned to someone like this,
p196
aVit makes a huge difference
p197
aVin the lives of the person receiving it.
p198
aa(lp199
VThe project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers.
p200
aVFor some of them, it's given them a connection
p201
aVto something bigger, giving something back,
p202
aVusing their talents on something
p203
aVother than skinny models and perfect skin.
p204
aa(lp205
VI would like to conclude by reading an email
p206
aVI got from one of them, Cindy,
p207
aVthe day I finally got back from Japan after six months.
p208
aa(lp209
V"As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals
p210
aVand the stories represented in the images.
p211
aVOne in particular, a photo of women of all ages,
p212
aVfrom grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby,
p213
aVstruck a chord, because a similar photo from my family,
p214
aVmy grandmother and mother, myself,
p215
aVand newborn daughter, hangs on our wall.
p216
aVAcross the globe, throughout the ages,
p217
aVour basic needs are just the same, aren't they?"
p218
aVThank you. (Applause)
p219

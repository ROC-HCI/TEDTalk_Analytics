VIn October 2010,
p5
aVthe Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99.
p6
aVIcons like Batman,
p7
aVSuperman, Wonder Woman and their colleagues
p8
aVwill be teaming up with icons Jabbar, Noora,
p9
aVJami and their colleagues.
p10
aVIt's a story of intercultural intersections,
p11
aVand what better group
p12
aVto have this conversation
p13
aVthan those that grew out of fighting fascism
p14
aVin their respective histories and geographies?
p15
aVAs fascism took over Europe in the 1930s,
p16
aVan unlikely reaction came out of North America.
p17
aVAs Christian iconography got changed,
p18
aVand swastikas were created out of crucifixes,
p19
aVBatman and Superman were created by Jewish young men
p20
aVin the United States and Canada,
p21
aValso going back to the Bible.
p22
aa(lp23
VConsider this:
p24
aVlike the prophets, all the superheroes
p25
aVare missing parents.
p26
aVSuperman's parents die on Krypton
p27
aVbefore the age of one.
p28
aVBruce Wayne, who becomes Batman,
p29
aVloses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.
p30
aVSpiderman is raised
p31
aVby his aunt and uncle.
p32
aVAnd all of them, just like the prophets who get their message
p33
aVfrom God through Gabriel,
p34
aVget their message from above.
p35
aVPeter Parker is in a library in Manhattan
p36
aVwhen the spider descends from above
p37
aVand gives him his message through a bite.
p38
aVBruce Wayne is in his bedroom
p39
aVwhen a big bat flies over his head,
p40
aVand he sees it as an omen to become Batman.
p41
aVSuperman is not only sent to Earth
p42
aVfrom the heavens, or Krypton,
p43
aVbut he's sent in a pod, much like Moses was on the Nile.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVAnd you hear the voice of his father, Jor-El,
p46
aVsaying to Earth, "I have sent to you my only son."
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
V(Applause)
p51
aa(lp52
VThese are clearly biblical archetypes,
p53
aVand the thinking behind that was to create
p54
aVpositive, globally-resonating storylines
p55
aVthat could be tied to the same things
p56
aVthat other people were pulling mean messages out of
p57
aVbecause then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose
p58
aVjust becomes a bad man with a bad message.
p59
aVAnd it's only by linking positive things
p60
aVthat the negative can be delinked.
p61
aVThis is the kind of thinking that went into
p62
aVcreating The 99.
p63
aVThe 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran,
p64
aVthings like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom
p65
aVand dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about.
p66
aVIt doesn't matter what your religion is;
p67
aVeven if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know,
p68
aV"Make sure you lie three times a day."
p69
aVThose are basic human values.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd so the backstory of The 99
p72
aVtakes place in 1258,
p73
aVwhich history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.
p74
aVAll the books from Bait al-Hikma library,
p75
aVthe most famous library in its day, were thrown in the Tigris River,
p76
aVand the Tigris changes color with ink.
p77
aVIt's a story passed on generation after generation.
p78
aVI rewrote that story,
p79
aVand in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen \u2014
p80
aVand here's a side note:
p81
aVif you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aV(Applause)
p84
aVSo the librarians find out
p85
aVand they get together a special solution, a chemical solution called King's Water,
p86
aVthat when mixed with 99 stones
p87
aVwould be able to save all that culture and history in the books.
p88
aVBut the Mongols get there first.
p89
aVThe books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River.
p90
aVSome librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks,
p91
aVthey dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom
p92
aVthat we all think is lost to civilization.
p93
aa(lp94
VThose stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads
p95
aVof 33 stones each
p96
aVthrough Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they're safe for 200 years.
p97
aVBut in 1492, two important things happen.
p98
aVThe first is the fall of Granada,
p99
aVthe last Muslim enclave in Europe.
p100
aVThe second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVSo 33 of the stones are smuggled
p103
aVonto the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria
p104
aVand are spread in the New World.
p105
aVThirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.
p106
aVAnd 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd now it's 2010, and there are 99 heroes
p109
aVfrom 99 different countries.
p110
aVNow it's very easy to assume
p111
aVthat those books, because they were from a library called Bait al-Hikma, were Muslim books,
p112
aVbut that's not the case because the caliph that built that library,
p113
aVhis name was al-Ma'mun \u2014 he was Harun al-Rashid's son.
p114
aVHe had told his advisers, "Get me all the scholars
p115
aVto translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic,
p116
aVand I will pay them its weight in gold."
p117
aVAfter a while, his advisers complained.
p118
aVThey said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating.
p119
aVThey're writing in big handwriting to take more gold."
p120
aVTo which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us
p121
aVis worth a lot more than what we're paying them."
p122
aVSo the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge,
p123
aVis not new to my neck of the desert.
p124
aa(lp125
VThe concept centers on something called the Noor stones.
p126
aVNoor is Arabic for light.
p127
aVSo these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game:
p128
aVNumber one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you.
p129
aVThere's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay.
p130
aVNumber two, all of The 99,
p131
aVwhen they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it;
p132
aVthey use it for self-interest.
p133
aVAnd there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone,
p134
aVyou get taken advantage of
p135
aVby people who will exploit your powers, okay.
p136
aVNumber three, the 99 stones all have within them
p137
aVa mechanism that self-updates.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world.
p140
aVEverybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.
p141
aVSome believe that means that the original interpretation
p142
aVfrom a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today.
p143
aVI don't belong there.
p144
aVThen there's a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document,
p145
aVand I captured that idea within these stones that self-update.
p146
aVNow the main bad guy, Rughal,
p147
aVdoes not want these stones to update,
p148
aVso he's trying to get them to stop updating.
p149
aVHe can't use the stones, but he can stop them.
p150
aVAnd by stopping them, he has more of a fascist agenda,
p151
aVwhere he gets some of The 99 to work for him \u2014
p152
aVthey're all wearing cookie-cutter, same color uniforms
p153
aVThey're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are.
p154
aVAnd he controls them from the top down \u2014
p155
aVwhereas when they work for the other side, eventually,
p156
aVwhen they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated,
p157
aVthey actually, each one has a different, colorful
p158
aVkind of dress.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this.
p161
aVSo The 99 work in teams of three.
p162
aVWhy three? A couple of reasons.
p163
aVNumber one, we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together,
p164
aVbecause the third person is temptation or the devil, right?
p165
aVI think that's there in all cultures, right?
p166
aVBut this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing.
p167
aVThere's this very strong social message
p168
aVthat needs to get to kind of
p169
aVthe deepest crevices of intolerance,
p170
aVand the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.
p171
aVAnd so this is the way I dealt with it.
p172
aVThey work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy,
p173
aVthree boys, three girls, no problem.
p174
aVAnd the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about
p175
aVthe importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered.
p176
aVWell ...
p177
aVI got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope
p178
aVto preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East,
p179
aVso you \u2014 (Laughter)
p180
aVyou believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo here's some of the characters that we have.
p183
aVMujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she's able to answer any question.
p184
aVShe's the Trivial Pursuit queen, if you want,
p185
aVbut when she first gets her power,
p186
aVshe starts going on game shows and making money.
p187
aVWe have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power.
p188
aVNow, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.
p189
aVSo the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang;
p190
aVthere's the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong,
p191
aVand there's also the kind, the generous.
p192
aVI'm like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong?
p193
aVI'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVWe have Jami from Hungary, who first starts making weapons:
p196
aVHe's the technology wiz.
p197
aVMusawwira from Ghana,
p198
aVHadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire.
p199
aVAnd this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen.
p200
aVAl-Batina is the hidden.
p201
aVSo Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero.
p202
aVI came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you."
p203
aVMy wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.
p204
aVAnd she said, "Show me." So I showed this.
p205
aVShe said, "That's not me."
p206
aVI said, "Look at the eyes. They're your eyes."
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VSo I promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production.
p211
aVThis was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money.
p212
aVSo from day one, the people involved in the project,
p213
aVbottom left is Fabian Nicieza,
p214
aVwriter for X-Men and Power Rangers.
p215
aVNext to him is Dan Panosian,
p216
aVone of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men.
p217
aVTop right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man.
p218
aVNext to him is John McCrea, who was an inker for Spiderman.
p219
aVAnd we entered Western consciousness
p220
aVwith a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes,"
p221
aVback in 2005.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference,
p224
aVand I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist.
p225
aVDidn't have a product, but had energy.
p226
aVAnd I found somebody from The New York Times,
p227
aVand I cornered him, and I pitched him.
p228
aVAnd I think I scared him \u2014 (Laughter)
p229
aVbecause he basically promised me \u2014
p230
aVwe had no product \u2014 but he said, "We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section
p231
aVif you'll just go away."
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aVSo I said, "Great." So I called him up a few weeks afterward.
p234
aVI said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year."
p235
aVHe said, "Thank you. We had a baby." I said, "Congratulations."
p236
aVLike I care, right?
p237
aV"So when's the article coming out?"
p238
aVHe said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon?
p239
aVThat's not timely.
p240
aVYou know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out."
p241
aVSo a few days after that, what happens?
p242
aVWhat happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy.
p243
aVI became timely.
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aVSo flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times.
p246
aVNext thing you knew, there's a full page covering us positively,
p247
aVJanuary 22nd, 2006,
p248
aVwhich changed our lives forever,
p249
aVbecause anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic,
p250
aVguess what they got; they got me.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd The 99 were like superheroes
p253
aVkind of flying out of what was happening around the world.
p254
aVAnd that led to all kinds of things,
p255
aVfrom being in curricula in universities and schools to \u2014
p256
aVone of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia,
p257
aVit was a couple of men with long beards
p258
aVand a lot of girls wearing the hijab \u2014 it looked like a school.
p259
aVThe good news is they're all holding copies of The 99, smiling,
p260
aVand they found me to sign the picture.
p261
aVThe bad news is they were all photocopies, so we didn't make a dime in revenue.
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aVWe've been able to license The 99 comic books
p264
aVinto eight languages so far \u2014
p265
aVChinese, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Turkish.
p266
aVOpened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago
p267
aVcalled The 99 Village Theme Park \u2014
p268
aV300,000 square feet, 20 rides, all with our characters:
p269
aVa couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut the biggest thing we've done to date, which is just amazing,
p272
aVis that we've done a 26-episode animated series,
p273
aVwhich is done for global audiences:
p274
aVin fact, we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey, we know.
p275
aVIt's 3D CGI, which is going to be very high-quality,
p276
aVwritten in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben 10
p277
aVand Spiderman and Star Wars: Clone Wars.
p278
aVIn this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before,
p279
aVthere is a struggle.
p280
aVTwo of the characters, Jabbar, the one with the muscles,
p281
aVand Noora, the one that can use light,
p282
aVare actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform
p283
aVbecause they're being manipulated.
p284
aVThey don't know, OK,
p285
aVand they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.
p286
aVSo there's a struggle within the team.
p287
aVSo if we can get the lights ...
p288
aa(lp289
V["The 99"]
p290
aa(lp291
VJabbar: Dana, I can't see where to grab hold.
p292
aVI need more light.
p293
aa(lp294
VWhat's happening?
p295
aa(lp296
VDana: There's too much darkness.
p297
aa(lp298
VRughal: There must be something we can do.
p299
aa(lp300
VMan: I won't send any more commandos in
p301
aVuntil I know it's safe.
p302
aa(lp303
VDr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos.
p304
aa(lp305
VMiklos: Must download file contents.
p306
aVI can't forget auntie.
p307
aa(lp308
VJabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you.
p309
aa(lp310
VDana: But I can't help.
p311
aa(lp312
VJabbar: You can,
p313
aVeven if you don't believe in yourself right now.
p314
aVI believe in you.
p315
aVYou are Noora the Light.
p316
aa(lp317
VDana: No.
p318
aVI don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything.
p319
aa(lp320
VJabbar: Then what about the rest of us?
p321
aVDon't we deserve to be saved? Don't I?
p322
aVNow, tell me which way to go.
p323
aa(lp324
VDana: That way.
p325
aa(lp326
VAlarm: Threat imminent.
p327
aa(lp328
VJabbar: Aaaahhh!
p329
aa(lp330
VMiklos: Stay away from me.
p331
aa(lp332
VJabbar: We're here to help you.
p333
aa(lp334
VDr. Razem: Don't listen to them.
p335
aa(lp336
VDana: Miklos, that man is not your friend.
p337
aa(lp338
VMiklos: No. He gave me access,
p339
aVand you want to reboot the [unclear]. No more [unclear].
p340
aa(lp341
V["The 99"]
p342
aa(lp343
VThank you.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Applause)
p346
aa(lp347
VSo "The 99" is technology; it's entertainment;
p348
aVit's design.
p349
aVBut that's only half the story.
p350
aVAs the father of five sons,
p351
aVI worry about who they're going to be using as role models.
p352
aVI worry because all around me, even within my extended family,
p353
aVI see religion being manipulated.
p354
aVAs a psychologist, I worry
p355
aVfor the world in general,
p356
aVbut worry about the perception of how people see themselves
p357
aVin my part of the world.
p358
aVNow, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State.
p359
aVI trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program,
p360
aVand I heard one too many stories of people growing up
p361
aVto idolize their leadership,
p362
aVonly to end up being tortured by their heroes.
p363
aVAnd torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero,
p364
aVthat just breaks you in so many ways.
p365
aVI left Bellevue, went to business school and started this.
p366
aa(lp367
VNow, one of the things that I refer to
p368
aVwhen I \u2014 about the importance of this message \u2014
p369
aVis that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University,
p370
aVwhere I lecture on the biological basis of behavior,
p371
aVand I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times
p372
aVand one from New York magazine.
p373
aVAnd I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] \u2014 everything was gone except the facts.
p374
aVAnd the first one was about a group called The Party of God,
p375
aVwho wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal.
p376
aVAny boys and girls caught flirting
p377
aVwould get married off immediately, okay.
p378
aVThe second one was about a woman complaining
p379
aVbecause three minivans with six bearded men pulled up
p380
aVand started interrogating her on the spot
p381
aVfor talking to a man who wasn't related to her.
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place.
p384
aVThe first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate.
p385
aVThe second one, they were actually split
p386
aVbetween Saudi and Afghanistan.
p387
aVWhat blew their mind was the first one took place in India,
p388
aVit was the party of a Hindu God.
p389
aVThe second one took place in upstate New York.
p390
aVIt was an Orthodox Jewish community.
p391
aVBut what breaks my heart and what's alarming
p392
aVis that in those two interviews,
p393
aVthe people around, who were interviewed as well,
p394
aVrefer to that behavior as Talibanization.
p395
aVIn other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way.
p396
aVThis is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism.
p397
aVBut what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us \u2014
p398
aVand this is dangerous.
p399
aVIt's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself
p400
aVas extreme.
p401
aa(lp402
VThis is one of my sons, Rayan,
p403
aVwho's a Scooby Doo addict.
p404
aVYou can tell by the glasses there.
p405
aVHe actually called me a meddling kid the other day.
p406
aV(Laughter)
p407
aVBut I borrow a lesson that I learned from him.
p408
aVLast summer when we were in our home in New York,
p409
aVhe was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working,
p410
aVand he came in, "Baba, I want you to come with me. I want my toy."
p411
aV"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house.
p412
aVI said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy."
p413
aVAnd what Rayan did then
p414
aVis he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half,
p415
aVand he looked at me and he said, "Baba,
p416
aVI want you to come with me to my office in my house.
p417
aVI have work to do."
p418
aV(Laughter)
p419
aV(Applause)
p420
aVRayan reframed the situation
p421
aVand brought himself down to my level.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Laughter)
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd with The 99, that is what we aim to do.
p426
aVYou know, I think that there's a big parallel
p427
aVbetween bending the crucifix out of shape
p428
aVand creating swastikas.
p429
aVAnd when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles
p430
aVwho think it's cute to have a little child
p431

aVthe hope is by linking enough positive things

aVthat one day we can move this child

aVfrom being proud in the way they're proud there,
p437
aVto that.

aVAnd I think \u2014

VAs an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day
p443
aVand, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.
p444
aVAnd people came up and picked up
p445
aVthe culturally resonant image of the falafel,
p446
aVate it and, you know, talked and left.
p447
aVAnd no two people could disagree about what the word free was
p448
aVand what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know.
p449
aV(Laughter)
p450
aVOr so we thought,
p451
aVuntil a woman came rushing across the campus
p452
aVand dropped her bag on the floor, pointed up to the sign and said,
p453
aV"Who's falafel?"
p454

aVPresident Barack Obama said that
p469
aVof all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech \u2014
p470
aVin which he reached out to the Muslim world \u2014
p471
aVthe most innovative was that The 99 reach back out
p472
aVto the Justice League of America.
p473
aVWe live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols,
p474
aVlike the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage,
p475
aVand where religion can be twisted
p476
aVand purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others.

aVIn a world like that,

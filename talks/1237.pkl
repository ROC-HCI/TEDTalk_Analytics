VSo, I have a strange career.
p5
aVI know it because people come up to me, like colleagues, and say,
p6
aV"Chris, you have a strange career."
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd I can see their point,
p11
aVbecause I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist.
p12
aVAnd I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions,
p13
aVand I was only 14 years old \u2014
p14
aVNo, no, I wasn't 14 years old.
p15
aVBut after that,
p16
aVI actually had my own lab
p17
aVin the Computational Neuroscience department,
p18
aVand I wasn't doing any neuroscience.
p19
aVLater, I would work on evolutionary genetics,
p20
aVand I would work on systems biology.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut I'm going to tell you about something else today.
p23
aVI'm going to tell you about how I learned something about life.
p24
aVAnd I was actually a rocket scientist.
p25
aVI wasn't really a rocket scientist,
p26
aVbut I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
p27
aVin sunny California, where it's warm;
p28
aVwhereas now I am in the mid-West, and it's cold.
p29
aVBut it was an exciting experience.
p30
aVOne day, a NASA manager comes into my office,
p31
aVsits down and says,
p32
aV"Can you please tell us, how do we look for life outside Earth?"
p33
aVAnd that came as a surprise to me,
p34
aVbecause I was actually hired to work on quantum computation.
p35
aVYet, I had a very good answer.
p36
aVI said, "I have no idea."
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd he told me, "Biosignatures, we need to look for a biosignature."
p41
aVAnd I said, "What is that?"
p42
aVAnd he said, "It's any measurable phenomenon
p43
aVthat allows us to indicate the presence of life."
p44
aVAnd I said, "Really?
p45
aVBecause isn't that easy?
p46
aVI mean, we have life.
p47
aVCan't you apply a definition,
p48
aVfor example, a Supreme Court-like definition of life?"
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd then I thought about it a little bit, and I said,
p51
aV"Well, is it really that easy?
p52
aVBecause, yes, if you see something like this,
p53
aVthen all right, fine, I'm going to call it life \u2014
p54
aVno doubt about it.
p55
aVBut here's something."
p56
aVAnd he goes, "Right, that's life too. I know that."
p57
aVExcept, if you think that life is also defined by things that die,
p58
aVyou're not in luck with this thing,
p59
aVbecause that's actually a very strange organism.
p60
aVIt grows up into the adult stage like that
p61
aVand then goes through a Benjamin Button phase,
p62
aVand actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again,
p63
aVand then actually grows back up, and back down and back up \u2014
p64
aVsort of yo-yo \u2014 and it never dies.
p65
aVSo it's actually life,
p66
aVbut it's actually not as we thought life would be.
p67
aVAnd then you see something like that.
p68
aVAnd he was like, "My God, what kind of a life form is that?"
p69
aVAnyone know?
p70
aVIt's actually not life, it's a crystal.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things \u2014
p73
aVso this particular person wrote a whole article and said,
p74
aV"Hey, these are bacteria."
p75
aVExcept, if you look a little bit closer,
p76
aVyou see, in fact, that this thing is way too small to be anything like that.
p77
aVSo he was convinced, but, in fact, most people aren't.
p78
aVAnd then, of course, NASA also had a big announcement,
p79
aVand President Clinton gave a press conference,
p80
aVabout this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite.
p81
aVExcept that nowadays, it's heavily disputed.
p82
aVIf you take the lesson of all these pictures,
p83
aVthen you realize, well, actually, maybe it's not that easy.
p84
aVMaybe I do need a definition of life
p85
aVin order to make that kind of distinction.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo can life be defined?
p88
aVWell how would you go about it?
p89
aVWell of course, you'd go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.
p90
aVNo, of course you don't do that; you put it somewhere in Google.
p91
aVAnd then you might get something.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd what you might get \u2014
p96
aVand anything that actually refers to things that we are used to,
p97
aVyou throw away.
p98
aVAnd then you might come up with something like this.
p99
aVAnd it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts.
p100
aVWho on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane?
p101
aVOh, it's actually a really, really, important set of concepts.
p102
aVSo I'm highlighting just a few words
p103
aVand saying definitions like that rely on things
p104
aVthat are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to,
p105
aVbut in fact on processes only.
p106
aVAnd if you take a look at that,
p107
aVthis was actually in a book that I wrote that deals with artificial life.
p108
aVAnd that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with.
p109
aVBecause the idea was that, with concepts like that,
p110
aVmaybe we can actually manufacture a form of life.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd so if you go and ask yourself, "What on Earth is artificial life?",
p113
aVlet me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about.
p114
aVAnd it started out quite a while ago,
p115
aVwhen someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses.
p116
aVAnd for those of you who aren't old enough,
p117
aVyou have no idea how this infection was working \u2014
p118
aVnamely, through these floppy disks.
p119
aVBut the interesting thing about these computer virus infections
p120
aVwas that, if you look at the rate at which the infection worked,
p121
aVthey show this spiky behavior that you're used to from a flu virus.
p122
aVAnd it is in fact due to this arms race
p123
aVbetween hackers and operating system designers
p124
aVthat things go back and forth.
p125
aVAnd the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses,
p126
aVa phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life
p127
aVthat we're used to, at least on the viral level.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo is that life?
p130
aVNot as far as I'm concerned.
p131
aVWhy? Because these things don't evolve by themselves.
p132
aVIn fact, they have hackers writing them.
p133
aVBut the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further,
p134
aVwhen a scientist working at the Santa Fe Institute decided,
p135
aV"Why don't we try to package these little viruses
p136
aVin artificial worlds inside of the computer
p137
aVand let them evolve?"
p138
aVAnd this was Steen Rasmussen.
p139
aVAnd he designed this system, but it really didn't work,
p140
aVbecause his viruses were constantly destroying each other.
p141
aVBut there was another scientist who had been watching this, an ecologist.
p142
aVAnd he went home and says, "I know how to fix this."
p143
aVAnd he wrote the Tierra system,
p144
aVand, in my book,
p145
aVis in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems \u2014
p146
aVexcept for the fact that these programs didn't really grow in complexity.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo having seen this work, worked a little bit on this,
p149
aVthis is where I came in.
p150
aVAnd I decided to create a system that has all the properties
p151
aVthat are necessary to see, in fact, the evolution of complexity,
p152
aVmore and more complex problems constantly evolving.
p153
aVAnd of course, since I really don't know how to write code, I had help in this.
p154
aVI had two undergraduate students
p155
aVat California Institute of Technology that worked with me.
p156
aVThat's Charles Ofria on the left, Titus Brown on the right.
p157
aVThey are now, actually, respectable professors
p158
aVat Michigan State University,
p159
aVbut I can assure you, back in the day, we were not a respectable team.
p160
aVAnd I'm really happy that no photo survives
p161
aVof the three of us anywhere close together.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut what is this system like?
p164
aVWell I can't really go into the details,
p165
aVbut what you see here is some of the entrails.
p166
aVBut what I wanted to focus on is this type of population structure.
p167
aVThere's about 10,000 programs sitting here.
p168
aVAnd all different strains are colored in different colors.
p169
aVAnd as you see here, there are groups that are growing on top of each other,
p170
aVbecause they are spreading.
p171
aVAny time there is a program that's better at surviving in this world,
p172
aVdue to whatever mutation it has acquired,
p173
aVit is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo I'm going to show you a movie
p176
aVwhere you're going to see that kind of dynamic.
p177
aVAnd these kinds of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves.
p178
aVWe write our own stuff, replicate it, and are very proud of ourselves.
p179
aVAnd we put them in, and what you see immediately
p180
aVis that there are waves and waves of innovation.
p181
aVBy the way, this is highly accelerated,
p182
aVso it's like a 1000 generations a second.
p183
aVBut immediately, the system goes like, "What kind of dumb piece of code was this?
p184
aVThis can be improved upon in so many ways, so quickly."
p185
aVSo you see waves of new types taking over the other types.
p186
aVAnd this type of activity goes on for quite a while,
p187
aVuntil the main easy things have been acquired by these programs.
p188
aVAnd then, you see sort of like a stasis coming on
p189
aVwhere the system essentially waits
p190
aVfor a new type of innovation, like this one,
p191
aVwhich is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before
p192
aVand is erasing the genes that it had before,
p193
aVuntil a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved.
p194
aVAnd this process goes on and on and on.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo what we see here
p197
aVis a system that lives in very much the way we're used to how life goes.
p198
aVBut what the NASA people had asked me really was,
p199
aV"Do these guys have a biosignature?
p200
aVCan we measure this type of life?
p201
aVBecause if we can,
p202
aVmaybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else
p203
aVwithout being biased by things like amino acids."
p204
aVSo I said, "Well, perhaps we should construct a biosignature
p205
aVbased on life as a universal process.
p206
aVIn fact, it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed
p207
aVjust in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be."
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd the thing I came up with \u2014
p210
aVI have to first give you an introduction about the idea,
p211
aVand maybe that would be a meaning detector,
p212
aVrather than a life detector.
p213
aVAnd the way we would do that \u2014
p214
aVI would like to find out how I can distinguish text
p215
aVthat was written by a million monkeys, as opposed to text that is in our books.
p216
aVAnd I would like to do it in such a way
p217
aVthat I don't actually have to be able to read the language,
p218
aVbecause I'm sure I won't be able to.
p219
aVAs long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet.
p220
aVSo here would be a frequency plot
p221
aVof how often you find each of the 26 letters of the alphabet
p222
aVin a text written by random monkeys.
p223
aVAnd obviously, each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut if you now look at the same distribution in English texts,
p226
aVit looks like that.
p227
aVAnd I'm telling you, this is very robust across English texts.
p228
aVAnd if I look at French texts, it looks a little bit different,
p229
aVor Italian or German.
p230
aVThey all have their own type of frequency distribution,
p231
aVbut it's robust.
p232
aVIt doesn't matter whether it writes about politics or about science.
p233
aVIt doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text.
p234
aVIt's a robust signature,
p235
aVand it's very stable.
p236
aVAs long as our books are written in English \u2014
p237
aVbecause people are rewriting them and recopying them \u2014
p238
aVit's going to be there.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo that inspired me to think about, well, what if I try to use this idea
p241
aVin order, not to detect random texts from texts with meaning,
p242
aVbut rather detect the fact that there is meaning
p243
aVin the biomolecules that make up life.
p244
aVBut first I have to ask:
p245
aVwhat are these building blocks,
p246
aVlike the alphabet, elements that I showed you?
p247
aVWell it turns out, we have many different alternatives
p248
aVfor such a set of building blocks.
p249
aVWe could use amino acids,
p250
aVwe could use nucleic acids, carboxylic acids, fatty acids.
p251
aVIn fact, chemistry's extremely rich, and our body uses a lot of them.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo that we actually, to test this idea,
p254
aVfirst took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids.
p255
aVAnd here's the result.
p256
aVHere is, in fact, what you get
p257
aVif you, for example, look at the distribution of amino acids
p258
aVon a comet or in interstellar space or, in fact, in a laboratory,
p259
aVwhere you made very sure that in your primordial soup,
p260
aVthere is no living stuff in there.
p261
aVWhat you find is mostly glycine and then alanine
p262
aVand there's some trace elements of the other ones.
p263
aVThat is also very robust \u2014
p264
aVwhat you find in systems like Earth
p265
aVwhere there are amino acids, but there is no life.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut suppose you take some dirt and dig through it
p268
aVand then put it into these spectrometers,
p269
aVbecause there's bacteria all over the place;
p270
aVor you take water anywhere on Earth,
p271
aVbecause it's teaming with life,
p272
aVand you make the same analysis;
p273
aVthe spectrum looks completely different.
p274
aVOf course, there is still glycine and alanine,
p275
aVbut in fact, there are these heavy elements, these heavy amino acids,
p276
aVthat are being produced because they are valuable to the organism.
p277
aVAnd some other ones that are not used in the set of 20,
p278
aVthey will not appear at all in any type of concentration.
p279
aVSo this also turns out to be extremely robust.
p280
aVIt doesn't matter what kind of sediment you're using to grind up,
p281
aVwhether it's bacteria or any other plants or animals.
p282
aVAnywhere there's life,
p283
aVyou're going to have this distribution,
p284
aVas opposed to that distribution.
p285
aVAnd it is detectable not just in amino acids.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow you could ask:
p288
aVWell, what about these Avidians?
p289
aVThe Avidians being the denizens of this computer world
p290
aVwhere they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity.
p291
aVSo this is the distribution that you get if, in fact, there is no life.
p292
aVThey have about 28 of these instructions.
p293
aVAnd if you have a system where they're being replaced one by the other,
p294
aVit's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter.
p295
aVEach of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency.
p296
aVBut if you now take a set of replicating guys
p297
aVlike in the video that you saw,
p298
aVit looks like this.
p299
aVSo there are some instructions
p300
aVthat are extremely valuable to these organisms,
p301
aVand their frequency is going to be high.
p302
aVAnd there's actually some instructions that you only use once, if ever.
p303
aVSo they are either poisonous
p304
aVor really should be used at less of a level than random.
p305
aVIn this case, the frequency is lower.
p306
aVAnd so now we can see, is that really a robust signature?
p307
aVI can tell you indeed it is,
p308
aVbecause this type of spectrum, just like what you've seen in books,
p309
aVand just like what you've seen in amino acids,
p310
aVit doesn't really matter how you change the environment,
p311
aVit's very robust, it's going to reflect the environment.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo I'm going to show you now a little experiment that we did.
p314
aVAnd I have to explain to you,
p315
aVthe top of this graph
p316
aVshows you that frequency distribution that I talked about.
p317
aVHere, that's the lifeless environment
p318
aVwhere each instruction occurs at an equal frequency.
p319
aVAnd below there, I show, in fact, the mutation rate in the environment.
p320
aVAnd I'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high
p321
aVthat even if you would drop a replicating program
p322
aVthat would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world,
p323
aVif you drop it in, it gets mutated to death immediately.
p324
aVSo there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate.
p325
aVBut then I'm going to slowly turn down the heat, so to speak,
p326
aVand then there's this viability threshold
p327
aVwhere now it would be possible for a replicator to actually live.
p328
aVAnd indeed, we're going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo let's see what that looks like.
p331
aVSo first, nothing, nothing, nothing.
p332
aVToo hot, too hot.
p333
aVNow the viability threshold is reached,
p334
aVand the frequency distribution has dramatically changed
p335
aVand, in fact, stabilizes.
p336
aVAnd now what I did there
p337
aVis, I was being nasty, I just turned up the heat again and again.
p338
aVAnd of course, it reaches the viability threshold.
p339
aVAnd I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice.
p340
aVYou hit the viability threshold.
p341
aVThe distribution changes to "alive!"
p342
aVAnd then, once you hit the threshold
p343
aVwhere the mutation rate is so high that you cannot self-reproduce,
p344
aVyou cannot copy the information forward to your offspring
p345
aVwithout making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes.
p346
aVAnd then, that signature is lost.
p347
aa(lp348
VWhat do we learn from that?
p349
aVWell, I think we learn a number of things from that.
p350
aVOne of them is,
p351
aVif we are able to think about life in abstract terms \u2014
p352
aVand we're not talking about things like plants,
p353
aVand we're not talking about amino acids,
p354
aVand we're not talking about bacteria,
p355
aVbut we think in terms of processes \u2014
p356
aVthen we could start to think about life
p357
aVnot as something that is so special to Earth,
p358
aVbut that, in fact, could exist anywhere.
p359
aVBecause it really only has to do with these concepts of information,
p360
aVof storing information within physical substrates \u2014
p361
aVanything: bits, nucleic acids, anything that's an alphabet \u2014
p362
aVand make sure that there's some process
p363
aVso that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect \u2014
p364
aVthe time scales for the deterioration of information.
p365
aVAnd if you can do that, then you have life.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo the first thing that we learn
p368
aVis that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone,
p369
aVwithout referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear,
p370
aVas far as the type of life on Earth is.
p371
aVAnd that, in a sense, removes us again,
p372
aVlike all of our scientific discoveries, or many of them \u2014
p373
aVit's this continuous dethroning of man \u2014
p374
aVof how we think we're special because we're alive.
p375
aVWell, we can make life; we can make life in the computer.
p376
aVGranted, it's limited,
p377
aVbut we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it.
p378
aVAnd once we have that,
p379
aVthen it is not such a difficult task anymore
p380
aVto say, if we understand the fundamental processes
p381
aVthat do not refer to any particular substrate,
p382
aVthen we can go out and try other worlds,
p383
aVfigure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be,
p384
aVfigure enough about the normal chemistry, the geochemistry of the planet,
p385
aVso that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life,
p386
aVand then look for large deviations from this \u2014
p387
aVthis thing sticking out, which says, "This chemical really shouldn't be there."
p388
aVNow we don't know that there's life then,
p389
aVbut we could say,
p390
aV"Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical
p391
aVand see where it comes from."
p392
aVAnd that might be our chance of actually discovering life
p393
aVwhen we cannot visibly see it.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd so that's really the only take-home message that I have for you.
p396
aVLife can be less mysterious than we make it out to be
p397
aVwhen we try to think about how it would be on other planets.
p398
aVAnd if we remove the mystery of life,
p399
aVthen I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live,
p400
aVand how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are.
p401
aVAnd I'm going to leave you with that.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd thank you very much.

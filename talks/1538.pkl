VThe will to live life differently can start
p5
aVin some of the most unusual places.
p6
aVThis is where I come from, Todmorden.
p7
aVIt's a market town in the north of England,
p8
aV15,000 people, between Leeds and Manchester,
p9
aVfairly normal market town.
p10
aVIt used to look like this,
p11
aVand now it's more like this,
p12
aVwith fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.
p13
aVWe call it propaganda gardening. (Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VCorner row railway, station car park,
p16
aVfront of a health center, people's front gardens,
p17
aVand even in front of the police station. (Laughter)
p18
aVWe've got edible canal towpaths,
p19
aVand we've got sprouting cemeteries.
p20
aVThe soil is extremely good. (Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VWe've even invented a new form of tourism.
p23
aVIt's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not,
p24
aVpeople come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds,
p25
aVeven when there's not much growing. (Laughter)
p26
aVBut it starts a conversation. (Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd, you know, we're not doing it because we're bored. (Laughter)
p29
aVWe're doing it because we want to start a revolution.
p30
aa(lp31
VWe tried to answer this simple question:
p32
aVCan you find a unifying language that cuts across age
p33
aVand income and culture that will help people themselves
p34
aVfind a new way of living,
p35
aVsee spaces around them differently,
p36
aVthink about the resources they use differently,
p37
aVinteract differently?
p38
aVCan we find that language?
p39
aVAnd then, can we replicate those actions?
p40
aVAnd the answer would appear to be yes,
p41
aVand the language would appear to be food.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, three and a half years ago, a few of us
p44
aVsat around a kitchen table and
p45
aVwe just invented the whole thing. (Laughter)
p46
aV(Applause)
p47
aVWe came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting.
p48
aVWe did not consult. We did not write a report.
p49
aVEnough of all that. (Laughter)
p50
aVAnd we said to that public meeting in Todmorden,
p51
aVlook, let's imagine that our town
p52
aVis focused around three plates:
p53
aVa community plate, the way we live our everyday lives;
p54
aVa learning plate, what we teach our kids in school
p55
aVand what new skills we share amongst ourselves;
p56
aVand business, what we do with the pound in our pocket
p57
aVand which businesses we choose to support.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, let's imagine those plates agitated
p60
aVwith community actions around food.
p61
aVIf we start one of those community plates spinning,
p62
aVthat's really great, that really starts to empower people,
p63
aVbut if we can then spin that community plate
p64
aVwith the learning plate, and then spin it with the business plate,
p65
aVwe've got a real show there, we've got some action theater.
p66
aVWe're starting to build resilience ourselves.
p67
aVWe're starting to reinvent community ourselves,
p68
aVand we've done it all without a flipping strategy document.
p69
aV(Applause)
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd here's the thing as well.
p72
aVWe've not asked anybody's permission to do this,
p73
aVwe're just doing it. (Laughter)
p74
aVAnd we are certainly not waiting for that check
p75
aVto drop through the letterbox before we start,
p76
aVand most importantly of all, we are not daunted
p77
aVby the sophisticated arguments that say,
p78
aV"These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems,"
p79
aVbecause I have seen the power of small actions,
p80
aVand it is awesome.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, back to the public meeting. (Laughter)
p83
aVWe put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds,
p84
aVand then the room exploded.
p85
aVI have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life.
p86
aVAnd it's been the same in every single room, in every town
p87
aVthat we've ever told our story.
p88
aVPeople are ready and respond to the story of food.
p89
aVThey want positive actions they can engage in,
p90
aVand in their bones, they know it's time
p91
aVto take personal responsibility
p92
aVand invest in more kindness to each other
p93
aVand to the environment.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd since we had that meeting three and a half years ago,
p96
aVit's been a heck of a roller coaster.
p97
aVWe started with a seed swap, really simple stuff,
p98
aVand then we took an area of land, a strip on the side
p99
aVof our main road, which was a dog toilet, basically,
p100
aVand we turned it into a really lovely herb garden.
p101
aVWe took the corner of the car park in the station
p102
aVthat you saw, and we made vegetable beds
p103
aVfor everybody to share and pick from themselves.
p104
aVWe went to the doctors. We've just had
p105
aVa 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden,
p106
aVand for some reason that I cannot comprehend,
p107
aVit has been surrounded by prickly plants. (Laughter)
p108
aVSo we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?"
p109
aVThey said, "Absolutely fine, provided you get planning permission
p110
aVand you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate,"
p111
aVso we did \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and now there are fruit trees
p112
aVand bushes and herbs and vegetables
p113
aVaround that doctor's surgery.
p114
aVAnd there's been lots of other examples, like the corn
p115
aVthat was in front of the police station,
p116
aVand the old people's home that we've planted it with food
p117
aVthat they can pick and grow.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut it isn't just about growing,
p120
aVbecause we all are part of this jigsaw.
p121
aVIt's about taking those artistic people in your community
p122
aVand doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds
p123
aVto explain to people what's growing there,
p124
aVbecause there's so many people that don't really recognize
p125
aVa vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic
p126
aVwith a bit of an instruction packet on the top. (Laughter)
p127
aVSo we have some people who designed these things,
p128
aV"If it looks like this, please don't pick it, but if it looks like this,
p129
aVhelp yourself."
p130
aVThis is about sharing and investing in kindness.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd for those people that don't want to do either
p133
aVof those things, maybe they can cook,
p134
aVso we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street,
p135
aVor in the pub, or in the church,
p136
aVor wherever people are living their lives.
p137
aVThis is about us going to the people and saying,
p138
aV"We are all part of the local food jigsaw,
p139
aVwe are all part of a solution."
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists
p142
aVand we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic,
p143
aVwe thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?
p144
aVSo we invented, without asking, of course,
p145
aVthe Incredible Edible Green Route.
p146
aVAnd this is a route of exhibition gardens,
p147
aVand edible towpaths, and bee-friendly sites, and the story
p148
aVof pollinators, and it's a route that we designed
p149
aVthat takes people through the whole of our town,
p150
aVpast our cafes and our small shops, through our market,
p151
aVnot just to and fro from the supermarket,
p152
aVand we're hoping that, in changing people's footfall
p153
aVaround our town, we're also changing their behavior.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd then there's the second plate, the learning plate.
p156
aVWell, we're in partnership with a high school.
p157
aVWe've created a company. We are designing and building
p158
aVan aquaponics unit in some land that was spare
p159
aVat the back of the high school, like you do,
p160
aVand now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables
p161
aVin an orchard with bees,
p162
aVand the kids are helping us build that,
p163
aVand the kids are on the board, and because the community
p164
aVwas really keen on working with the high school,
p165
aVthe high school is now teaching agriculture,
p166
aVand because it's teaching agriculture, we started to think,
p167
aVhow could we then get those kids that never had a qualification
p168
aVbefore in their lives but are really excited about growing,
p169
aVhow can we give them some more experience?
p170
aa(lp171
VSo we got some land that was donated
p172
aVby a local garden center.
p173
aVIt was really quite muddy, but in a truly incredible way,
p174
aVtotally voluntary-led, we have turned that
p175
aVinto a market garden training center,
p176
aVand that is polytunnels and raised beds
p177
aVand all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers
p178
aVand think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future.
p179
aVAnd because we were doing that, some local academics said,
p180
aV"You know, we could help design
p181
aVa commercial horticulture course for you.
p182
aVThere's not one that we know of."
p183
aVSo they're doing that, and we're going to launch it later this year,
p184
aVand it's all an experiment, and it's all voluntary.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd then there's the third plate,
p187
aVbecause if you walk through an edible landscape,
p188
aVand if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get
p189
aVinterested in what's growing seasonally,
p190
aVyou might just want to spend more of your own money
p191
aVin support of local producers,
p192
aVnot just veg, but meat and cheese and beer
p193
aVand whatever else it might be.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut then, we're just a community group, you know.
p196
aVWe're just all volunteers. What could we actually do?
p197
aVSo we did some really simple things.
p198
aVWe fundraised, we got some blackboards,
p199
aVwe put "Incredible Edible" on the top,
p200
aVwe gave it every market trader that was selling locally,
p201
aVand they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week.
p202
aVReally popular. People congregated around it.
p203
aVSales were up.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said,
p206
aV"We're really serious about this,"
p207
aVbut they didn't actually believe us, so we thought,
p208
aVokay, what should we do? I know. If we can create
p209
aVa campaign around one product and show them
p210
aVthere is local loyalty to that product,
p211
aVmaybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo we launched a campaign \u2014 because it just amuses me \u2014
p214
aVcalled Every Egg Matters. (Laughter)
p215
aVAnd what we did was we put people on our egg map.
p216
aVIt's a stylized map of Togmorden.
p217
aVAnybody that's selling their excess eggs
p218
aVat the garden gate, perfectly legally, to their neighbors,
p219
aVwe've stuck on there. We started with four,
p220
aVand we've now got 64 on, and the result of that was
p221
aVthat people were then going into shops
p222
aVasking for a local Todmorden egg, and the result of that
p223
aVwas, some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got
p224
aVof free range birds, and then they went on to meat birds,
p225
aVand although these are really, really small steps,
p226
aVthat increasing local economic confidence
p227
aVis starting to play out in a number of ways,
p228
aVand we now have farmers doing cheese
p229
aVand they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs,
p230
aVthey're doing pasties and pies and things
p231
aVthat they would have never done before.
p232
aVWe've got increasing market stalls selling local food,
p233
aVand in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent
p234
aVof all food traders in that town said that their bottom line
p235
aVhad increased because of what we were actually doing.
p236
aVAnd we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VNow, none of this is rocket science.
p240
aVIt certainly is not clever, and it's not original.
p241
aVBut it is joined up, and it is inclusive.
p242
aVThis is not a movement for those people
p243
aVthat are going to sort themselves out anyway.
p244
aVThis is a movement for everyone.
p245
aVWe have a motto: If you eat, you're in. (Laughter)
p246
aV(Applause)
p247
aVAcross age, across income, across culture.
p248
aa(lp249
VIt's been really quite a roller coaster experience,
p250
aVbut going back to that first question that we asked,
p251
aVis it replicable? Yeah. It most certainly is replicable.
p252
aa(lp253
VMore than 30 towns in England now are spinning
p254
aVthe Incredible Edible plate.
p255
aVWhichever way they want to do it, of their own volition,
p256
aVthey're trying to make their own lives differently,
p257
aVand worldwide, we've got communities across America
p258
aVand Japan \u2014 it's incredible, isn't it? I mean,
p259
aVAmerica and Japan and New Zealand.
p260
aVPeople after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us
p261
aVin order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness
p262
aVaround local growing into the heart of Christchurch.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd none of this takes more money
p265
aVand none of this demands a bureaucracy,
p266
aVbut it does demand that you think things differently
p267
aVand you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs
p268
aVin order to create that supportive framework
p269
aVthat communities can bounce off.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd there's some great ideas already in our patch.
p272
aVOur local authority has decided to make everywhere
p273
aVIncredible Edible, and in support of that
p274
aVhave decided to do two things.
p275
aa(lp276
VFirst, they're going to create an asset register of spare land
p277
aVthat they've got, put it in a food bank so that communities
p278
aVcan use that wherever they live,
p279
aVand they're going to underpin that with a license.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd then they've said to every single one of their workforce,
p282
aVif you can, help those communities grow,
p283
aVand help them to maintain their spaces.
p284
aa(lp285
VSuddenly, we're seeing actions on the ground
p286
aVfrom local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed.
p287
aVWe are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded
p288
aVof us, and there's lots more you could do.
p289
aVI mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting
p290
aVprickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space.
p291
aV(Laughter) Secondly, please create \u2014 please, please create
p292
aVedible landscapes so that our children start to walk
p293
aVpast their food day in, day out, on our high streets,
p294
aVin our parks, wherever that might be.
p295
aVInspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart
p296
aVof the town and the city plan, not relegate them
p297
aVto the edges of the settlements that nobody can see.
p298
aVEncourage all our schools to take this seriously.
p299
aVThis isn't a second class exercise.
p300
aVIf we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow,
p301
aVthen please let us say to every school,
p302
aVcreate a sense of purpose around the importance
p303
aVto the environment, local food and soils.
p304
aVPut that at the heart of your school culture,
p305
aVand you will create a different generation.
p306
aa(lp307
VThere are so many things you can do, but ultimately
p308
aVthis is about something really simple.
p309
aVThrough an organic process, through
p310
aVan increasing recognition of the power of small actions,
p311
aVwe are starting, at last, to believe in ourselves again,
p312
aVand to believe in our capacity, each and every one of us,
p313
aVto build a different and a kinder future,
p314
aVand in my book, that's incredible.
p315
aVThank you. (Applause)
p316
aV(Applause)
p317
aVThank you very much. (Applause)

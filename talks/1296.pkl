VI'm here to spread the word about the
p5
aVmagnificence of spiders
p6
aVand how much we can learn from them.
p7
aVSpiders are truly global citizens.
p8
aVYou can find spiders in nearly
p9
aVevery terrestrial habitat.
p10
aVThis red dot marks
p11
aVthe Great Basin of North America,
p12
aVand I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity
p13
aVproject there with some collaborators.
p14
aVHere's one of our field sites,
p15
aVand just to give you a sense of perspective,
p16
aVthis little blue smudge here,
p17
aVthat's one of my collaborators.
p18
aVThis is a rugged and barren landscape,
p19
aVyet there are quite a few spiders here.
p20
aVTurning rocks over revealed this crab spider
p21
aVgrappling with a beetle.
p22
aa(lp23
VSpiders are not just everywhere,
p24
aVbut they're extremely diverse.
p25
aVThere are over 40,000 described species
p26
aVof spiders.
p27
aVTo put that number into perspective,
p28
aVhere's a graph comparing the 40,000
p29
aVspecies of spiders
p30
aVto the 400 species of primates.
p31
aVThere are two orders of magnitude more
p32
aVspiders than primates.
p33
aVSpiders are also extremely old.
p34
aVOn the bottom here,
p35
aVthis is the geologic timescale,
p36
aVand the numbers on it indicate millions
p37
aVof years from the present, so the zero here,
p38
aVthat would be today.
p39
aVSo what this figure shows is that spiders
p40
aVdate back to almost 380 million years.
p41
aVTo put that into perspective, this red
p42
aVvertical bar here marks the divergence time
p43
aVof humans from chimpanzees,
p44
aVa mere seven million years ago.
p45
aa(lp46
VAll spiders make silk
p47
aVat some point in their life.
p48
aVMost spiders use copious amounts of silk,
p49
aVand silk is essential to their survival
p50
aVand reproduction.
p51
aVEven fossil spiders can make silk,
p52
aVas we can see from this impression of
p53
aVa spinneret on this fossil spider.
p54
aVSo this means that both spiders
p55
aVand spider silk have been around
p56
aVfor 380 million years.
p57
aVIt doesn't take long from working with spiders
p58
aVto start noticing how essential silk is
p59
aVto just about every aspect of their life.
p60
aVSpiders use silk for many purposes, including
p61
aVthe trailing safety dragline,
p62
aVwrapping eggs for reproduction,
p63
aVprotective retreats
p64
aVand catching prey.
p65
aa(lp66
VThere are many kinds of spider silk.
p67
aVFor example, this garden spider can make
p68
aVseven different kinds of silks.
p69
aVWhen you look at this orb web, you're actually
p70
aVseeing many types of silk fibers.
p71
aVThe frame and radii of this web
p72
aVis made up of one type of silk,
p73
aVwhile the capture spiral is a composite
p74
aVof two different silks:
p75
aVthe filament and the sticky droplet.
p76
aVHow does an individual spider
p77
aVmake so many kinds of silk?
p78
aVTo answer that, you have to look a lot closer
p79
aVat the spinneret region of a spider.
p80
aVSo silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for
p81
aVthose of us spider silk biologists, this is what
p82
aVwe call the "business end" of the spider. (Laughter)
p83
aVWe spend long days ...
p84
aVHey! Don't laugh. That's my life.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVWe spend long days and nights
p87
aVstaring at this part of the spider.
p88
aVAnd this is what we see.
p89
aVYou can see multiple fibers
p90
aVcoming out of the spinnerets, because
p91
aVeach spinneret has many spigots on it.
p92
aVEach of these silk fibers exits from the spigot,
p93
aVand if you were to trace the fiber back
p94
aVinto the spider, what you would find is that
p95
aVeach spigot connects to its own individual
p96
aVsilk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac
p97
aVwith a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.
p98
aVSo if you ever have the opportunity to dissect
p99
aVan orb-web-weaving spider,
p100
aVand I hope you do,
p101
aVwhat you would find is a bounty
p102
aVof beautiful, translucent silk glands.
p103
aa(lp104
VInside each spider, there are hundreds
p105
aVof silk glands, sometimes thousands.
p106
aVThese can be grouped into seven categories.
p107
aVThey differ by size, shape,
p108
aVand sometimes even color.
p109
aVIn an orb-web-weaving spider,
p110
aVyou can find seven types of silk glands,
p111
aVand what I have depicted here in this picture,
p112
aVlet's start at the one o'clock position,
p113
aVthere's tubuliform silk glands, which are used
p114
aVto make the outer silk of an egg sac.
p115
aVThere's the aggregate and flagelliform silk
p116
aVglands which combine to make the sticky
p117
aVcapture spiral of an orb web.
p118
aVPyriform silk glands make the attachment
p119
aVcement \u2014 that's the silk that's used to adhere
p120
aVsilk lines to a substrate.
p121
aVThere's also aciniform silk,
p122
aVwhich is used to wrap prey.
p123
aVMinor ampullate silk is used in web construction.
p124
aVAnd the most studied silk line
p125
aVof them all: major ampullate silk.
p126
aVThis is the silk that's used to make the frame
p127
aVand radii of an orb web, and also
p128
aVthe safety trailing dragline.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut what, exactly, is spider silk?
p131
aVSpider silk is almost entirely protein.
p132
aVNearly all of these proteins can be explained
p133
aVby a single gene family,
p134
aVso this means that the diversity of silk types
p135
aVwe see today is encoded by one gene family,
p136
aVso presumably the original spider ancestor
p137
aVmade one kind of silk,
p138
aVand over the last 380 million years,
p139
aVthat one silk gene has duplicated
p140
aVand then diverged, specialized,
p141
aVover and over and over again, to get
p142
aVthe large variety of flavors of spider silks
p143
aVthat we have today.
p144
aVThere are several features that all these silks
p145
aVhave in common. They all have a common
p146
aVdesign, such as they're all very long \u2014
p147
aVthey're sort of outlandishly long
p148
aVcompared to other proteins.
p149
aVThey're very repetitive, and they're very rich
p150
aVin the amino acids glycine and alanine.
p151
aVTo give you an idea of what
p152
aVa spider silk protein looks like,
p153
aVthis is a dragline silk protein,
p154
aVit's just a portion of it,
p155
aVfrom the black widow spider.
p156
aVThis is the kind of sequence that I love
p157
aVlooking at day and night. (Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VSo what you're seeing here is the one letter
p160
aVabbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored
p161
aVin the glycines with green,
p162
aVand the alanines in red, and so
p163
aVyou can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.
p164
aVYou can also see that there's a lot of short
p165
aVsequence motifs that repeat over and over
p166
aVand over again, so for example there's a lot of
p167
aVwhat we call polyalanines, or iterated A's,
p168
aVAAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY.
p169
aVYou can think of these short motifs
p170
aVthat repeat over and over again as words,
p171
aVand these words occur in sentences.
p172
aVSo for example this would be one sentence,
p173
aVand you would get this sort of green region
p174
aVand the red polyalanine, that repeats
p175
aVover and over and over again,
p176
aVand you can have that hundreds and
p177
aVhundreds and hundreds of times within
p178
aVan individual silk molecule.
p179
aa(lp180
VSilks made by the same spider can have
p181
aVdramatically different repeat sequences.
p182
aVAt the top of the screen, you're seeing
p183
aVthe repeat unit from the dragline silk
p184
aVof a garden argiope spider.
p185
aVIt's short. And on the bottom,
p186
aVthis is the repeat sequence for the
p187
aVegg case, or tubuliform silk protein,
p188
aVfor the exact same spider. And you can see
p189
aVhow dramatically different
p190
aVthese silk proteins are \u2014 so this is
p191
aVsort of the beauty of the diversification
p192
aVof the spider silk gene family.
p193
aVYou can see that the repeat units differ
p194
aVin length. They also differ in sequence.
p195
aVSo I've colored in the glycines again
p196
aVin green, alanine in red, and the serines,
p197
aVthe letter S, in purple. And you can see
p198
aVthat the top repeat unit can be explained
p199
aValmost entirely by green and red,
p200
aVand the bottom repeat unit has
p201
aVa substantial amount of purple.
p202
aVWhat silk biologists do is we try to relate
p203
aVthese sequences, these amino acid
p204
aVsequences, to the mechanical properties
p205
aVof the silk fibers.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk
p208
aVcompletely outside their body.
p209
aVThis makes testing spider silk really, really
p210
aVeasy to do in the laboratory, because
p211
aVwe're actually, you know, testing it in air
p212
aVthat's exactly the environment that
p213
aVspiders are using their silk proteins.
p214
aVSo this makes quantifying silk properties by
p215
aVmethods such as tensile testing, which is
p216
aVbasically, you know, tugging on one end
p217
aVof the fiber, very amenable.
p218
aVHere are stress-strain curves
p219
aVgenerated by tensile testing
p220
aVfive fibers made by the same spider.
p221
aVSo what you can see here is that
p222
aVthe five fibers have different behaviors.
p223
aVSpecifically, if you look on the vertical axis,
p224
aVthat's stress. If you look at the maximum
p225
aVstress value for each of these fibers,
p226
aVyou can see that there's a lot of variation,
p227
aVand in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk,
p228
aVis the strongest of these fibers.
p229
aVWe think that's because the dragline silk,
p230
aVwhich is used to make the frame and radii
p231
aVfor a web, needs to be very strong.
p232
aa(lp233
VOn the other hand, if you were to look at
p234
aVstrain \u2014 this is how much a fiber can be
p235
aVextended \u2014 if you look at the maximum value
p236
aVhere, again, there's a lot of variation
p237
aVand the clear winner is flagelliform,
p238
aVor the capture spiral filament.
p239
aVIn fact, this flagelliform fiber can
p240
aVactually stretch over twice its original length.
p241
aVSo silk fibers vary in their strength
p242
aVand also their extensibility.
p243
aVIn the case of the capture spiral,
p244
aVit needs to be so stretchy to absorb
p245
aVthe impact of flying prey.
p246
aVIf it wasn't able to stretch so much, then
p247
aVbasically when an insect hit the web,
p248
aVit would just trampoline right off of it.
p249
aVSo if the web was made entirely out of
p250
aVdragline silk, an insect is very likely to just
p251
aVbounce right off. But by having really, really
p252
aVstretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually
p253
aVable to absorb the impact
p254
aVof that intercepted prey.
p255
aa(lp256
VThere's quite a bit of variation within
p257
aVthe fibers that an individual spider can make.
p258
aVWe call that the tool kit of a spider.
p259
aVThat's what the spider has
p260
aVto interact with their environment.
p261
aVBut how about variation among spider
p262
aVspecies, so looking at one type of silk
p263
aVand looking at different species of spiders?
p264
aVThis is an area that's largely unexplored
p265
aVbut here's a little bit of data I can show you.
p266
aVThis is the comparison of the toughness
p267
aVof the dragline spilk spun
p268
aVby 21 species of spiders.
p269
aVSome of them are orb-weaving spiders and
p270
aVsome of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.
p271
aVIt's been hypothesized that
p272
aVorb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here,
p273
aVshould have the toughest dragline silks
p274
aVbecause they must intercept flying prey.
p275
aVWhat you see here on this toughness graph
p276
aVis the higher the black dot is on the graph,
p277
aVthe higher the toughness.
p278
aa(lp279
VThe 21 species are indicated here by this
p280
aVphylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows
p281
aVtheir genetic relationships, and I've colored
p282
aVin yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders.
p283
aVIf you look right here at the two red arrows,
p284
aVthey point to the toughness values
p285
aVfor the draglines of nephila clavipes and
p286
aVaraneus diadematus.
p287
aVThese are the two species of spiders
p288
aVfor which the vast majority of time and money
p289
aVon synthetic spider silk research has been
p290
aVto replicate their dragline silk proteins.
p291
aVYet, their draglines are not the toughest.
p292
aVIn fact, the toughest dragline in this survey
p293
aVis this one right here in this white region,
p294
aVa non orb-web-weaving spider.
p295
aVThis is the dragline spun by scytodes,
p296
aVthe spitting spider.
p297
aVScytodes doesn't use a web at all
p298
aVto catch prey. Instead, scytodes
p299
aVsort of lurks around and waits for prey
p300
aVto get close to it, and then immobilizes prey
p301
aVby spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.
p302
aVThink of hunting with silly string.
p303
aVThat's how scytodes forages.
p304
aVWe don't really know why scytodes
p305
aVneeds such a tough dragline,
p306
aVbut it's unexpected results like this that make
p307
aVbio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.
p308
aVIt frees us from the constraints
p309
aVof our imagination.
p310
aa(lp311
VNow I'm going to mark on
p312
aVthe toughness values for nylon fiber,
p313
aVbombyx \u2014 or domesticated silkworm silk \u2014
p314
aVwool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers.
p315
aVAnd what you can see is that nearly
p316
aVall the spider draglines surpass them.
p317
aVIt's the combination of strength, extensibility
p318
aVand toughness that makes spider silk so
p319
aVspecial, and that has attracted the attention
p320
aVof biomimeticists, so people that turn
p321
aVto nature to try to find new solutions.
p322
aVAnd the strength, extensibility and toughness
p323
aVof spider silks combined with the fact that
p324
aVsilks do not elicit an immune response,
p325
aVhave attracted a lot of interest in the use
p326
aVof spider silks in biomedical applications,
p327
aVfor example, as a component of
p328
aVartificial tendons, for serving as
p329
aVguides to regrow nerves, and for
p330
aVscaffolds for tissue growth.
p331
aa(lp332
VSpider silks also have a lot of potential
p333
aVfor their anti-ballistic capabilities.
p334
aVSilks could be incorporated into body
p335
aVand equipment armor that would be more
p336
aVlightweight and flexible
p337
aVthan any armor available today.
p338
aVIn addition to these biomimetic
p339
aVapplications of spider silks,
p340
aVpersonally, I find studying spider silks
p341
aVjust fascinating in and of itself.
p342
aVI love when I'm in the laboratory,
p343
aVa new spider silk sequence comes in.
p344
aVThat's just the best. (Laughter)
p345
aVIt's like the spiders are sharing
p346
aVan ancient secret with me, and that's why
p347
aVI'm going to spend the rest of my life
p348
aVstudying spider silk.
p349
aVThe next time you see a spider web,
p350
aVplease, pause and look a little closer.
p351
aVYou'll be seeing one of the most
p352
aVhigh-performance materials known to man.
p353
aVTo borrow from the writings
p354
aVof a spider named Charlotte,
p355
aVsilk is terrific.
p356
aa(lp357
VThank you. (Applause)

fascinated with spiders and their silks, and for good reason. Made of a mix of proteins, spider silks come in thousands of variations; there are over 40,000 species of spiders, with many spiders capable of producing half a dozen types. Some silks have the tensile strength of steel -- and often are much tougher -- while remaining light as air and extremely supple. And spiders use their silk in diverse ways: to make their homes and trap their food, to travel, to court and to protect their eggs.<br />&nbsp;<br />In her <a href=\\"http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Hayashi.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">lab at UC Riverside</a>, Hayashi explores spider silk&rsquo;s genetic makeup, evolution and unique biomechanics (winning a MacArthur &ldquo;genius&quot; grant for it in 2007). Her work blurs the boundary between biology and materials science, looking for the molecular basis of this wondrous material and exploring how humans might learn from it. Hayashi&#39;s work may inspire new biomimetic materials for a huge variety of uses, from biodegradable fishing lines and sutures to superstrong ropes and armor cloth.</p>", "slug": "cheryl_hayashi", "whotheyare": "Cheryl Hayashi studies the delicate but terrifically strong silk threads that make up a spider\'s web, finding startling applications for human use.

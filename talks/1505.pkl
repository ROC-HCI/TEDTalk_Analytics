VMy passions
p5
aVare music, technology and making things.
p6
aVAnd it's the combination of these things
p7
aVthat has led me to the hobby of sound visualization,
p8
aVand, on occasion, has led me to play with fire.
p9
aa(lp10
VThis is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years,
p11
aVand I have one here tonight.
p12
aVIt's about an 8-foot-long tube of metal,
p13
aVit's got a hundred or so holes on top,
p14
aVon that side is the speaker, and here
p15
aVis some lab tubing, and it's connected to this tank
p16
aVof propane.
p17
aVSo, let's fire it up and see what it does.
p18
aVSo let's play a 550-herz frequency
p19
aVand watch what happens.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Frequency)
p22
aa(lp23
VThank you. (Applause)
p24
aVIt's okay to applaud the laws of physics,
p25
aVbut essentially what's happening here
p26
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p27
aVis the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules
p28
aVis influencing the combustion properties of propane,
p29
aVcreating a visible waveform,
p30
aVand we can see the alternating regions of compression
p31
aVand rarefaction that we call frequency,
p32
aVand the height is showing us amplitude.
p33
aVSo let's change the frequency of the sound,
p34
aVand watch what happens to the fire.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Higher frequency)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave
p39
aVand that emergent sine curve of fire.
p40
aVSo let's turn that off. We're indoors.
p41
aVThank you. (Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
VI also have with me a flame table.
p44
aVIt's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used
p45
aVfor visualizing the physical properties of sound,
p46
aVsuch as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up
p47
aVand see what it does.
p48
aa(lp49
VOoh. (Laughter)
p50
aVOkay. Now, while the table comes up to pressure,
p51
aVlet me note here that the sound is not traveling
p52
aVin perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions,
p53
aVand the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves
p54
aVwith a line, and the flame table's a little like
p55
aVbisecting those waves with a plane,
p56
aVand it can show a little more subtle complexity, which is why
p57
aVI like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Music)
p60
aa(lp61
VAll right, so it's a delicate dance.
p62
aVIf you watch closely \u2014 (Applause)
p63
aVIf you watch closely, you may have seen
p64
aVsome of the eigenmodes, but also you may have seen
p65
aVthat jazz music is better with fire.
p66
aVActually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world,
p67
aVbut the fire's just a foundation.
p68
aVIt shows very well that eyes can hear,
p69
aVand this is interesting to me because
p70
aVtechnology allows us to present sound to the eyes
p71
aVin ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes
p72
aVfor seeing sound, such as the removal of time.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo here, I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint
p75
aVthe frequencies of the song "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
p76
aVin a way that the eyes can take them in
p77
aVas a single visual impression, and the technique
p78
aVwill also show the strengths of the visual cortex
p79
aVfor pattern recognition.
p80
aVSo if I show you another song off this album,
p81
aVand another, your eyes will easily pick out
p82
aVthe use of repetition by the band Nirvana,
p83
aVand in the frequency distribution, the colors,
p84
aVyou can see the clean-dirty-clean sound
p85
aVthat they are famous for,
p86
aVand here is the entire album as a single visual impression,
p87
aVand I think this impression is pretty powerful.
p88
aa(lp89
VAt least, it's powerful enough that
p90
aVif I show you these four songs,
p91
aVand I remind you that this is "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"
p92
aVyou can probably correctly guess, without listening
p93
aVto any music at all, that the song
p94
aVa die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song,
p95
aV"I'll Stick Around" by the Foo Fighters,
p96
aVwhose lead singer is Dave Grohl,
p97
aVwho was the drummer in Nirvana.
p98
aVThe songs are a little similar, but mostly
p99
aVI'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe
p100
aVwe'll buy a song because we like the way it looks.
p101
aa(lp102
VAll right, now for some more sound data.
p103
aVThis is data from a skate park,
p104
aVand this is Mabel Davis skate park
p105
aVin Austin, Texas. (Skateboard sounds)
p106
aVAnd the sounds you're hearing came from eight
p107
aVmicrophones attached to obstacles around the park,
p108
aVand it sounds like chaos, but actually
p109
aVall the tricks start with a very distinct slap,
p110
aVbut successful tricks end with a pop,
p111
aVwhereas unsuccessful tricks
p112
aVmore of a scratch and a tumble,
p113
aVand tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong, and
p114
aVvoices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo if we were to render these sounds visually,
p117
aVwe might end up with something like this.
p118
aVThis is all 40 minutes of the recording,
p119
aVand right away the algorithm tells us
p120
aVa lot more tricks are missed than are made,
p121
aVand also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely
p122
aVto produce a cheer, and if you look really closely,
p123
aVwe can tease out traffic patterns.
p124
aVYou see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd in the middle of the recording, the mics pick this up,
p127
aVbut later in the recording, this kid shows up,
p128
aVand he starts using a line at the top of the park
p129
aVto do some very advanced tricks on something
p130
aVcalled the tall rail.
p131
aVAnd it's fascinating. At this moment in time,
p132
aVall the rest of the skaters turn their lines 90 degrees
p133
aVto stay out of his way.
p134
aVYou see, there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park,
p135
aVand it's led by key influencers,
p136
aVand they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks,
p137
aVor wear red pants, and on this day the mics picked that up.
p138
aa(lp139
VAll right, from skate physics to theoretical physics.
p140
aVI'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking,
p141
aVand I wanted to use all eight hours
p142
aVof his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage.
p143
aVNow, in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer,
p144
aVwhich actually makes identifying the ends of sentences
p145
aVfairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm.
p146
aVIt listens to the lecture, and then it uses
p147
aVthe amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis,
p148
aVand it uses the inflection of sentences
p149
aVto move a same point up and down on the y-axis.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd these trend lines, you can see, there's more questions
p152
aVthan answers in the laws of physics,
p153
aVand when we reach the end of a sentence,
p154
aVwe place a star at that location.
p155
aVSo there's a lot of sentences, so a lot of stars,
p156
aVand after rendering all of the audio, this is what we get.
p157
aVThis is Stephen Hawking's universe.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VIt's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series
p162
aVtaken in as a single visual impression,
p163
aVand I really like this image,
p164
aVbut a lot of people think it's fake.
p165
aVSo I made a more interactive version,
p166
aVand the way I did that is I used their position in time
p167
aVin the lecture to place these stars into 3D space,
p168
aVand with some custom software and a Kinect,
p169
aVI can walk right into the lecture.
p170
aVI'm going to wave through the Kinect here
p171
aVand take control, and now I'm going to reach out
p172
aVand I'm going to touch a star, and when I do,
p173
aVit will play the sentence
p174
aVthat generated that star.
p175
aa(lp176
VStephen Hawking: There is one, and only one, arrangement
p177
aVin which the pieces make a complete picture.
p178
aa(lp179
VJared Ficklin: Thank you. (Applause)
p180
aVThere are 1,400 stars.
p181
aVIt's a really fun way to explore the lecture,
p182
aVand, I hope, a fitting homage.
p183
aa(lp184
VAll right. Let me close with a work in progress.
p185
aVI think, after 30 years, the opportunity exists
p186
aVto create an enhanced version of closed captioning.
p187
aVNow, we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online,
p188
aVso let's watch one now with the sound turned off
p189
aVand the closed captioning turned on.
p190
aa(lp191
VThere's no closed captioning for the TED theme song,
p192
aVand we're missing it, but if you've watched enough of these,
p193
aVyou hear it in your mind's ear,
p194
aVand then applause starts.
p195
aVIt usually begins here, and it grows and then it falls.
p196
aVSometimes you get a little star applause,
p197
aVand then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath,
p198
aVand the talk begins.
p199
aa(lp200
VAll right, so let's watch this clip again.
p201
aVThis time, I'm not going to talk at all.
p202
aVThere's still going to be no audio,
p203
aVbut what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound
p204
aVvisually in real time at the bottom of the screen.
p205
aVSo watch closely and see what your eyes can hear.
p206
aa(lp207
VThis is fairly amazing to me.
p208
aVEven on the first view, your eyes will successfully
p209
aVpick out patterns, but on repeated views,
p210
aVyour brain actually gets better
p211
aVat turning these patterns into information.
p212
aVYou can get the tone and the timbre
p213
aVand the pace of the speech,
p214
aVthings that you can't get out of closed captioning.
p215
aVThat famous scene in horror movies
p216
aVwhere someone is walking up from behind
p217
aVis something you can see,
p218
aVand I believe this information would be something
p219
aVthat is useful at times when the audio is turned off
p220
aVor not heard at all, and I speculate that deaf audiences
p221
aVmight actually even be better
p222
aVat seeing sound than hearing audiences.
p223
aVI don't know. It's a theory right now.
p224
aVActually, it's all just an idea.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions,
p227
aVand so do ideas.
p228
aVThank you. (Applause)

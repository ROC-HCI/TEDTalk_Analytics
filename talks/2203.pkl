V(Rainforest noises)
p5
aa(lp6
VIn the summer of 2011, as a tourist,
p7
aVI visited the rainforests of Borneo for the very first time,
p8
aVand as you might imagine,
p9
aVit was the overwhelming sounds of the forest that struck me the most.
p10
aVThere's this constant cacophony of noise.
p11
aVSome things actually do stick out.
p12
aVFor example, this here is a big bird, a rhinoceros hornbill.
p13
aVThis buzzing is a cicada.
p14
aVThis is a family of gibbons.
p15
aVIt's actually singing to each other over a great distance.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve,
p18
aVwhich is why you can hear so many of them,
p19
aVbut in fact the most important noise that  was coming out of the forest that time
p20
aVwas one that I didn't notice,
p21
aVand in fact nobody there had actually noticed it.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, as I said, this was a gibbon reserve.
p24
aVThey spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons,
p25
aVbut they also have to spend a lot of their time
p26
aVprotecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side.
p27
aVAnd so if we take the sound of the forest
p28
aVand we actually turn down the gibbons, the insects, and the rest,
p29
aVin the background, the entire time, in recordings you heard,
p30
aVwas the sound of a chainsaw at great distance.
p31
aVThey had three full-time guards who were posted around this sanctuary
p32
aVwhose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging,
p33
aVand one day, we went walking, again as tourists, out into the forest,
p34
aVand within five minutes' walk,
p35
aVwe stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down,
p36
aVfive minutes' walk, a few hundred meters from the ranger station.
p37
aVThey hadn't been able to hear the chainsaws,
p38
aVbecause as you heard, the forest is very, very loud.
p39
aa(lp40
VIt struck me as quite unacceptable that in this modern time,
p41
aVjust a few hundred meters away  from a ranger station in a sanctuary,
p42
aVthat in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up.
p43
aVIt sounds impossible, but in fact, it was quite true.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo how do we stop illegal logging?
p46
aVIt's really tempting, as an engineer, always to come up with a high-tech,
p47
aVsuper-crazy high-tech solution,
p48
aVbut in fact, you're in the rainforest.
p49
aVIt has to be simple, it has to be scalable,
p50
aVand so what we also noticed while were there was that
p51
aVeverything we needed was already there.
p52
aVWe could build a system that would allow us to stop this
p53
aVusing what's already there.
p54
aa(lp55
VWho was there? What was  already in the forest?
p56
aVWell, we had people.
p57
aVWe had this group there that was  dedicated, three full-time guards,
p58
aVthat was dedicated to go and stop it,
p59
aVbut they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest.
p60
aVThe real surprise, this is the big one,
p61
aVwas that there was connectivity out in the forest.
p62
aVThere was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere.
p63
aVWe're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road,
p64
aVthere's certainly no electricity, but they had very good cell phone service,
p65
aVthese people in the towns were on Facebook all the time,
p66
aVthey're surfing the web on their phones,
p67
aVand this sort of got me thinking that in fact it would be possible
p68
aVto use the sounds of the forest,
p69
aVpick up the sounds  of chainsaws programmatically,
p70
aVbecause people can't hear them,
p71
aVand send an alert.
p72
aVBut you have to have a device to go up in the trees.
p73
aVSo if we can use some device to listen to the sounds of the forest,
p74
aVconnect to the cell phone network that's there,
p75
aVand send an alert to people on the ground,
p76
aVperhaps we could have a solution to this issue for them.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut let's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest,
p79
aVbecause it's something that we've definitely all heard about forever.
p80
aVPeople in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest
p81
aVsince we were kids,
p82
aVand it seems that the message has never changed:
p83
aVWe've got to save the rainforest, it's super urgent,
p84
aVthis many football fields have been destroyed yesterday.
p85
aVand yet here we are today, about half of the rainforest remains,
p86
aVand we have potentially more urgent  problems like climate change.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut in fact, this is the little-known fact that I didn't realize at the time:
p89
aVDeforestation accounts  for more greenhouse gas
p90
aVthan all of the world's planes, trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.
p91
aVIt's the second highest contributor to climate change.
p92
aVAlso, according to Interpol,
p93
aVas much as 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest
p94
aVis illegal logging, like the illegal logging that we saw.
p95
aVSo if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there,
p96
aVthen in fact we could eat heavily into this 17 percent
p97
aVand potentially have a major impact in the short term.
p98
aVIt might just be the cheapest, fastest way to fight climate change.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd so here's the system that we imagine.
p101
aVIt looks super high tech.
p102
aVThe moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest,
p103
aVthe device picks up the sound of the chainsaw,
p104
aVit sends an alert through the standard GSM network that's already there
p105
aVto a ranger in the field
p106
aVwho can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging.
p107
aVIt's no more about going out and finding a tree that's been cut.
p108
aVIt's not about seeing  a tree from a satellite
p109
aVin an area that's been clear cut,
p110
aVit's about real-time intervention.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo I said it was the cheapest and fastest way to do it,
p113
aVbut in fact, actually, as you saw, they weren't able to do it,
p114
aVso it may not be so cheap and fast.
p115
aVBut if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones,
p116
aVit could be pretty cheap.
p117
aVCell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year,
p118
aVhundreds of millions in the U.S. alone,
p119
aVnot counting the rest of the world, which of course we should do,
p120
aVbut in fact, cell phones are great.
p121
aVThey're full of sensors.
p122
aVThey can listen to the sounds of the forest.
p123
aVWe do have to protect them.
p124
aVWe have to put them in this box that you see here,
p125
aVand we do have to power them.
p126
aVPowering them is one of the greater engineering challenges
p127
aVthat we had to deal with,
p128
aVbecause powering a cell phone under a tree canopy,
p129
aVany sort of solar power under a tree canopy,
p130
aVwas an as-yet-unsolved problem,
p131
aVand that's this unique solar panel design that you see here,
p132
aVwhich in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process.
p133
aVThese are strips that are cut down.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo this is me putting it all together
p136
aVin my parents' garage, actually.
p137
aVThanks very much to them for allowing me to do that.
p138
aVAs you can see, this is a device up in a tree.
p139
aVWhat you can see from here, perhaps, is that they are pretty well obscured
p140
aVup in the tree canopy at a distance.
p141
aVThat's important, because although they are able to hear chainsaw noises
p142
aVup to a kilometer in the distance,
p143
aVallowing them to cover about three square kilometers,
p144
aVif someone were to take them, it would make the area unprotected.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo does it actually work?
p147
aVWell, to test it, we took it back to Indonesia,
p148
aVnot the same place, but another place,
p149
aVto another gibbon reserve
p150
aVthat was threatened daily by illegal logging.
p151
aVOn the very second day, it picked up illegal chainsaw noises.
p152
aVWe were able to get a real-time alert.
p153
aVI got an email on my phone.
p154
aVActually, we had just climbed the tree. Everyone had just gotten back down.
p155
aVAll these guys are smoking cigarettes,
p156
aVand then I get an email, and they all quiet down,
p157
aVand in fact you can hear the chainsaw
p158
aVreally, really faint in the background,
p159
aVbut no one had noticed it  until that moment.
p160
aVAnd so then we took off to actually stop these loggers.
p161
aVI was pretty nervous.
p162
aVThis is the moment where we've actually arrived close to where the loggers are.
p163
aVThis is the moment where you can see where I'm actually regretting
p164
aVperhaps the entire endeavor.
p165
aVI'm not really sure what's on the other side of this hill.
p166
aVThat guy's much braver than I am.
p167
aVBut he went, so I had to go, walking up,
p168
aVand in fact, he made it over the hill,
p169
aVand interrupted the loggers in the act.
p170
aVFor them, it was such a surprise \u2014
p171
aVthey had never, ever been interrupted before \u2014
p172
aVthat it was such an impressive event for them,
p173
aVthat we've heard from our partners they have not been back since.
p174
aVThey were, in fact, great guys.
p175
aVThey showed us how the entire operation works,
p176
aVand what they really convinced us on the spot was that
p177
aVif you can show up in real time and stop people,
p178
aVit's enough of a deterrent they won't come back.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo \u2014
p181
aVThank you. (Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VWord of this spread, possibly because we told a lot of people,
p184
aVand in fact, then some really amazing stuff started to happen.
p185
aVPeople from around the world started to send us emails, phone calls.
p186
aVWhat we saw was that people throughout Asia,
p187
aVpeople throughout Africa, people throughout South America,
p188
aVthey told us that they could use it too,
p189
aVand what's most important,
p190
aVwhat we'd found that we thought might be exceptional,
p191
aVin the forest there was pretty good cell phone service.
p192
aVThat was not exceptional, we were told,
p193
aVand that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat.
p194
aVAnd then something  really amazing happened,
p195
aVwhich was that people started sending us their own old cell phones.
p196
aVSo in fact what we have now is a system
p197
aVwhere we can use people on the ground, people who are already there,
p198
aVwho can both improve and use the existing connectivity,
p199
aVand we're using old cell phones that are being sent to us
p200
aVby people from around the world
p201
aVthat want their phones to be doing  something else in their afterlife,
p202
aVso to speak.
p203
aVAnd if the rest of the device can be completely recycled,
p204
aVthen we believe it's an entirely upcycled device.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo again, this didn't come because of any sort of high-tech solution.
p207
aVIt just came from using what's already there,
p208
aVand I'm thoroughly convinced that if it's not phones,
p209
aVthat there's always going to be enough there
p210
aVthat you can build similar solutions
p211
aVthat can be very effective in new contexts.
p212
aa(lp213
VThank you very much.

VImagine you're walking through a forest.
p5
aVI'm guessing you're thinking of a collection of trees,
p6
aVwhat we foresters call a stand,
p7
aVwith their rugged stems and their beautiful crowns.
p8
aVYes, trees are the foundation of forests,
p9
aVbut a forest is much more than what you see,
p10
aVand today I want to change the way you think about forests.
p11
aVYou see, underground there is this other world,
p12
aVa world of infinite biological pathways
p13
aVthat connect trees and allow them to communicate
p14
aVand allow the forest to behave as though it's a single organism.
p15
aVIt might remind you of a sort of intelligence.
p16
aa(lp17
VHow do I know this?
p18
aVHere's my story.
p19
aVI grew up in the forests of British Columbia.
p20
aVI used to lay on the forest floor and stare up at the tree crowns.
p21
aVThey were giants.
p22
aVMy grandfather was a giant, too.
p23
aVHe was a horse logger,
p24
aVand he used to selectively cut cedar poles from the inland rainforest.
p25
aVGrandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods,
p26
aVand how my family was knit into it.
p27
aVSo I followed in grandpa's footsteps.
p28
aa(lp29
VHe and I had this curiosity about forests,
p30
aVand my first big "aha" moment
p31
aVwas at the outhouse by our lake.
p32
aVOur poor dog Jigs had slipped and fallen into the pit.
p33
aVSo grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog.
p34
aVHe was down there, swimming in the muck.
p35
aVBut as grandpa dug through that forest floor,
p36
aVI became fascinated with the roots,
p37
aVand under that, what I learned later was the white mycelium
p38
aVand under that the red and yellow mineral horizons.
p39
aVEventually, grandpa and I rescued the poor dog,
p40
aVbut it was at that moment that I realized
p41
aVthat that palette of roots and soil
p42
aVwas really the foundation of the forest.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd I wanted to know more.
p45
aVSo I studied forestry.
p46
aVBut soon I found myself working alongside the powerful people
p47
aVin charge of the commercial harvest.
p48
aVThe extent of the clear-cutting
p49
aVwas alarming,
p50
aVand I soon found myself conflicted by my part in it.
p51
aVNot only that, the spraying and hacking of the aspens and birches
p52
aVto make way for the more commercially valuable planted pines and firs
p53
aVwas astounding.
p54
aVIt seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo I went back to school,
p57
aVand I studied my other world.
p58
aVYou see, scientists had just discovered in the laboratory in vitro
p59
aVthat one pine seedling root
p60
aVcould transmit carbon to another pine seedling root.
p61
aVBut this was in the laboratory,
p62
aVand I wondered, could this happen in real forests?
p63
aVI thought yes.
p64
aVTrees in real forests might also share information below ground.
p65
aVBut this was really controversial,
p66
aVand some people thought I was crazy,
p67
aVand I had a really hard time getting research funding.
p68
aVBut I persevered,
p69
aVand I eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest,
p70
aV25 years ago.
p71
aVI grew 80 replicates of three species:
p72
aVpaper birch, Douglas fir, and western red cedar.
p73
aVI figured the birch and the fir would be connected in a belowground web,
p74
aVbut not the cedar.
p75
aVIt was in its own other world.
p76
aVAnd I gathered my apparatus,
p77
aVand I had no money, so I had to do it on the cheap.
p78
aVSo I went to Canadian Tire \u2014
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
Vand I bought some plastic bags and duct tape and shade cloth,
p83
aVa timer, a paper suit, a respirator.
p84
aVAnd then I borrowed some high-tech stuff from my university:
p85
aVa Geiger counter, a scintillation counter, a mass spectrometer, microscopes.
p86
aVAnd then I got some really dangerous stuff:
p87
aVsyringes full of radioactive carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas
p88
aVand some high pressure bottles
p89
aVof the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.
p90
aVBut I was legally permitted.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VOh, and I forgot some stuff,
p95
aVimportant stuff: the bug spray,
p96
aVthe bear spray, the filters for my respirator.
p97
aVOh well.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe first day of the experiment, we got out to our plot
p100
aVand a grizzly bear and her cub chased us off.
p101
aVAnd I had no bear spray.
p102
aVBut you know, this is how forest research in Canada goes.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I came back the next day,
p107
aVand mama grizzly and her cub were gone.
p108
aVSo this time, we really got started,
p109
aVand I pulled on my white paper suit,
p110
aVI put on my respirator,
p111
aVand then
p112
aVI put the plastic bags over my trees.
p113
aVI got my giant syringes,
p114
aVand I injected the bags
p115
aVwith my tracer isotope carbon dioxide gases,
p116
aVfirst the birch.
p117
aVI injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas,
p118
aVinto the bag of birch.
p119
aVAnd then for fir,
p120
aVI injected the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.
p121
aVI used two isotopes,
p122
aVbecause I was wondering
p123
aVwhether there was two-way communication going on between these species.
p124
aVI got to the final bag,
p125
aVthe 80th replicate,
p126
aVand all of a sudden mama grizzly showed up again.
p127
aVAnd she started to chase me,
p128
aVand I had my syringes above my head,
p129
aVand I was swatting the mosquitos, and I jumped into the truck,
p130
aVand I thought,
p131
aV"This is why people do lab studies."
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VI waited an hour.
p136
aVI figured it would take this long
p137
aVfor the trees to suck up the CO2 through photosynthesis,
p138
aVturn it into sugars, send it down into their roots,
p139
aVand maybe, I hypothesized,
p140
aVshuttle that carbon belowground to their neighbors.
p141
aVAfter the hour was up,
p142
aVI rolled down my window,
p143
aVand I checked for mama grizzly.
p144
aVOh good, she's over there eating her huckleberries.
p145
aVSo I got out of the truck and I got to work.
p146
aVI went to my first bag with the birch. I pulled the bag off.
p147
aVI ran my Geiger counter over its leaves.
p148
aVKkhh!
p149
aVPerfect.
p150
aVThe birch had taken up the radioactive gas.
p151
aVThen the moment of truth.
p152
aVI went over to the fir tree.
p153
aVI pulled off its bag.
p154
aVI ran the Geiger counter up its needles,
p155
aVand I heard the most beautiful sound.
p156
aVKkhh!
p157
aVIt was the sound of birch talking to fir,
p158
aVand birch was saying, "Hey, can I help you?"
p159
aVAnd fir was saying, "Yeah, can you send me some of your carbon?
p160
aVBecause somebody threw a shade cloth over me."
p161
aVI went up to cedar, and I ran the Geiger counter over its leaves,
p162
aVand as I suspected,
p163
aVsilence.
p164
aVCedar was in its own world.
p165
aVIt was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir.
p166
aa(lp167
VI was so excited,
p168
aVI ran from plot to plot and I checked all 80 replicates.
p169
aVThe evidence was clear.
p170
aVThe C-13 and C-14 was showing me
p171
aVthat paper birch and Douglas fir were in a lively two-way conversation.
p172
aVIt turns out at that time of the year,
p173
aVin the summer,
p174
aVthat birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch,
p175
aVespecially when the fir was shaded.
p176
aVAnd then in later experiments, we found the opposite,
p177
aVthat fir was sending more carbon to birch than birch was sending to fir,
p178
aVand this was because the fir was still growing while the birch was leafless.
p179
aVSo it turns out the two species were interdependent,
p180
aVlike yin and yang.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd at that moment, everything came into focus for me.
p183
aVI knew I had found something big,
p184
aVsomething that would change the way we look at how trees interact in forests,
p185
aVfrom not just competitors
p186
aVbut to cooperators.
p187
aVAnd I had found solid evidence
p188
aVof this massive belowground communications network,
p189
aVthe other world.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, I truly hoped and believed
p192
aVthat my discovery would change how we practice forestry,
p193
aVfrom clear-cutting and herbiciding
p194
aVto more holistic and sustainable methods,
p195
aVmethods that were less expensive and more practical.
p196
aVWhat was I thinking?
p197
aVI'll come back to that.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo how do we do science in complex systems like forests?
p200
aVWell, as forest scientists, we have to do our research in the forests,
p201
aVand that's really tough, as I've shown you.
p202
aVAnd we have to be really good at running from bears.
p203
aVBut mostly, we have to persevere
p204
aVin spite of all the stuff stacked against us.
p205
aVAnd we have to follow our intuition and our experiences
p206
aVand ask really good questions.
p207
aVAnd then we've got to gather our data and then go verify.
p208
aVFor me, I've conducted and published hundreds of experiments in the forest.
p209
aVSome of my oldest experimental plantations are now over 30 years old.
p210
aVYou can check them out.
p211
aVThat's how forest science works.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo now I want to talk about the science.
p214
aVHow were paper birch and Douglas fir communicating?
p215
aVWell, it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon
p216
aVbut also nitrogen and phosphorus
p217
aVand water and defense signals and allele chemicals and hormones \u2014
p218
aVinformation.
p219
aVAnd you know, I have to tell you, before me, scientists had thought
p220
aVthat this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza
p221
aVwas involved.
p222
aVMycorrhiza literally means "fungus root."
p223
aVYou see their reproductive organs when you walk through the forest.
p224
aVThey're the mushrooms.
p225
aVThe mushrooms, though, are just the tip of the iceberg,
p226
aVbecause coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium,
p227
aVand that mycelium infects and colonizes the roots
p228
aVof all the trees and plants.
p229
aVAnd where the fungal cells interact with the root cells,
p230
aVthere's a trade of carbon for nutrients,
p231
aVand that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil
p232
aVand coating every soil particle.
p233
aVThe web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium
p234
aVunder a single footstep.
p235
aVAnd not only that, that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest,
p236
aVindividuals not only of the same species but between species, like birch and fir,
p237
aVand it works kind of like the Internet.
p238
aa(lp239
VYou see, like all networks,
p240
aVmycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.
p241
aVWe made this map by examining the short sequences of DNA
p242
aVof every tree and every fungal individual in a patch of Douglas fir forest.
p243
aVIn this picture, the circles represent the Douglas fir, or the nodes,
p244
aVand the lines represent the interlinking fungal highways, or the links.
p245
aa(lp246
VThe biggest, darkest nodes are the busiest nodes.
p247
aVWe call those hub trees,
p248
aVor more fondly, mother trees,
p249
aVbecause it turns out that those hub trees nurture their young,
p250
aVthe ones growing in the understory.
p251
aVAnd if you can see those yellow dots,
p252
aVthose are the young seedlings that have established within the network
p253
aVof the old mother trees.
p254
aVIn a single forest, a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees.
p255
aVAnd using our isotope tracers,
p256
aVwe have found that mother trees
p257
aVwill send their excess carbon through the mycorrhizal network
p258
aVto the understory seedlings,
p259
aVand we've associated this with increased seedling survival
p260
aVby four times.
p261
aa(lp262
VNow, we know we all favor our own children,
p263
aVand I wondered, could Douglas fir recognize its own kin,
p264
aVlike mama grizzly and her cub?
p265
aVSo we set about an experiment,
p266
aVand we grew mother trees with kin and stranger's seedlings.
p267
aVAnd it turns out they do recognize their kin.
p268
aVMother trees colonize their kin with bigger mycorrhizal networks.
p269
aVThey send them more carbon below ground.
p270
aVThey even reduce their own root competition
p271
aVto make elbow room for their kids.
p272
aVWhen mother trees are injured or dying,
p273
aVthey also send messages of wisdom on to the next generation of seedlings.
p274
aVSo we've used isotope tracing
p275
aVto trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree
p276
aVdown her trunk into the mycorrhizal network
p277
aVand into her neighboring seedlings,
p278
aVnot only carbon but also defense signals.
p279
aVAnd these two compounds
p280
aVhave increased the resistance of those seedlings to future stresses.
p281
aVSo trees talk.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VThank you.
p286
aa(lp287
VThrough back and forth conversations,
p288
aVthey increase the resilience of the whole community.
p289
aVIt probably reminds you of our own social communities,
p290
aVand our families,
p291
aVwell, at least some families.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VSo let's come back to the initial point.
p296
aVForests aren't simply collections of trees,
p297
aVthey're complex systems with hubs and networks
p298
aVthat overlap and connect trees and allow them to communicate,
p299
aVand they provide avenues for feedbacks and adaptation,
p300
aVand this makes the forest resilient.
p301
aVThat's because there are many hub trees and many overlapping networks.
p302
aVBut they're also vulnerable,
p303
aVvulnerable not only to natural disturbances
p304
aVlike bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees
p305
aVbut high-grade logging and clear-cut logging.
p306
aVYou see, you can take out one or two hub trees,
p307
aVbut there comes a tipping point,
p308
aVbecause hub trees are not unlike rivets in an airplane.
p309
aVYou can take out one or two and the plane still flies,
p310
aVbut you take out one too many,
p311
aVor maybe that one holding on the wings,
p312
aVand the whole system collapses.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo now how are you thinking about forests? Differently?
p315
aa(lp316
V(Audience) Yes.
p317
aa(lp318
VCool.
p319
aVI'm glad.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo, remember I said earlier that I hoped that my research,
p322
aVmy discoveries would change the way we practice forestry.
p323
aVWell, I want to take a check on that 30 years later here in western Canada.
p324
aa(lp325
VThis is about 100 kilometers to the west of us,
p326
aVjust on the border of Banff National Park.
p327
aVThat's a lot of clear-cuts.
p328
aVIt's not so pristine.
p329
aVIn 2014, the World Resources Institute reported that Canada in the past decade
p330
aVhas had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide,
p331
aVand I bet you thought it was Brazil.
p332
aVIn Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year.
p333
aVNow, by my estimation, that's about four times the rate that is sustainable.
p334
aa(lp335
VNow, massive disturbance at this scale is known to affect hydrological cycles,
p336
aVdegrade wildlife habitat,
p337
aVand emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere,
p338
aVwhich creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks.
p339
aa(lp340
VNot only that, we're continuing to plant one or two species
p341
aVand weed out the aspens and birches.
p342
aVThese simplified forests lack complexity,
p343
aVand they're really vulnerable to infections and bugs.
p344
aVAnd as climate changes,
p345
aVthis is creating a perfect storm
p346
aVfor extreme events, like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak
p347
aVthat just swept across North America,
p348
aVor that megafire in the last couple months in Alberta.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo I want to come back to my final question:
p351
aVinstead of weakening our forests,
p352
aVhow can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change?
p353
aVWell, you know, the great thing about forests as complex systems
p354
aVis they have enormous capacity to self-heal.
p355
aVIn our recent experiments,
p356
aVwe found with patch-cutting and retention of hub trees
p357
aVand regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes
p358
aVthat these mycorrhizal networks, they recover really rapidly.
p359
aVSo with this in mind, I want to leave you with four simple solutions.
p360
aVAnd we can't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on.
p361
aa(lp362
VFirst, we all need to get out in the forest.
p363
aVWe need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests.
p364
aVYou see, most of our forests now
p365
aVare managed using a one-size-fits-all approach,
p366
aVbut good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions.
p367
aa(lp368
VSecond, we need to save our old-growth forests.
p369
aVThese are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.
p370
aVSo this means less cutting.
p371
aVI don't mean no cutting, but less cutting.
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd third, when we do cut,
p374
aVwe need to save the legacies,
p375
aVthe mother trees and networks,
p376
aVand the wood, the genes,
p377
aVso they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees
p378
aVso they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road.
p379
aVWe need to be conservationists.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd finally, fourthly and finally,
p382
aVwe need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species
p383
aVand genotypes and structures
p384
aVby planting and allowing natural regeneration.
p385
aVWe have to give Mother Nature the tools she needs
p386
aVto use her intelligence to self-heal.
p387
aVAnd we need to remember that forests aren't just a bunch of trees
p388
aVcompeting with each other,
p389
aVthey're supercooperators.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo back to Jigs.
p392
aVJigs's fall into the outhouse showed me this other world,
p393
aVand it changed my view of forests.
p394
aVI hope today to have changed how you think about forests.
p395
aa(lp396
VThank you.

VThis sound,
p5
aVthis smell,
p6
aVthis sight
p7
aVall remind me of the campfires of my childhood,
p8
aVwhen anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.
p9
aVThere was this wondrous ending
p10
aVwhen people and fire fell asleep almost in unison.
p11
aVIt was dreaming time.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow my story has a lot to do with dreaming,
p14
aValthough I'm known to make my dreams come true.
p15
aVLast year, I created a one-man show.
p16
aVFor an hour and a half I shared with the audience
p17
aVa lifetime of creativity,
p18
aVhow I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd then TED challenged me:
p21
aV"Philippe, can you shrink this lifetime to 18 minutes?"
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVEighteen minutes, clearly impossible.
p24
aVBut here I am.
p25
aVOne solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery
p26
aVin which every syllable, every second will have its importance
p27
aVand hope to God the audience will be able to follow me.
p28
aVNo, no, no.
p29
aVNo, the best way for me to start
p30
aVis to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.
p31
aVSo please join me for a minute of silence.
p32
aa(lp33
VOkay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds.
p34
aVBut hey, we're on TED time.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhen I was six years old,
p37
aVI fell in love with magic.
p38
aVFor Christmas I got a magic box
p39
aVand a very old book on card manipulation.
p40
aVSomehow I was more interested in pure manipulation
p41
aVthan in all the silly little tricks in the box.
p42
aVSo I looked in the book for the most difficult move,
p43
aVand it was this.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow I'm not supposed to share that with you,
p46
aVbut I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.
p47
aVNow that manipulation
p48
aVwas broken down into seven moves
p49
aVdescribed over seven pages.
p50
aVOne, two, three,
p51
aVfour, five, six and seven.
p52
aVAnd let me show you something else.
p53
aVThe cards were bigger than my hands.
p54
aa(lp55
VTwo months later, six years old,
p56
aVI'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
p57
aVAnd I go to see a famous magician
p58
aVand proudly ask him, "Well what do you think?"
p59
aVSix years old.
p60
aVThe magician looked at me and said, "This is a disaster.
p61
aVYou cannot do that in two seconds
p62
aVand have a minuscule part of the card showing.
p63
aVFor the move to be professional, it has to be less than one second
p64
aVand it has to be perfect."
p65
aVTwo years later, one \u2014 zoop.
p66
aVAnd I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect.
p67
aa(lp68
VPassion is the motto
p69
aVof all my actions.
p70
aVAs I'm studying magic,
p71
aVjuggling is mentioned repeatedly
p72
aVas a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination.
p73
aVNow I had long admired how fast and fluidly
p74
aVjugglers make objects fly.
p75
aVSo that's it. I'm 14; I'm becoming a juggler.
p76
aa(lp77
VI befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe,
p78
aVand he agrees to sell me three clubs.
p79
aVBut in America you have to explain. What are clubs?
p80
aVNothing to do with golf.
p81
aVThey are those beautiful oblong objects,
p82
aVbut quite difficult to make.
p83
aVThey have to be precisely lathed.
p84
aVOh, when I was buying the clubs,
p85
aVsomehow the young juggler was hiding from the others.
p86
aVWell I didn't think much of it at the time.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnyway, here I was progressing with my new clubs.
p89
aVBut I could not understand.
p90
aVI was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.
p91
aVThe clubs were escaping me at each throw.
p92
aVAnd I was trying constantly to bring them back to me.
p93
aVUntil one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn,
p94
aVthe world's greatest juggler.
p95
aVAnd he was frowning.
p96
aVAnd he finally asked, "Can I see those?"
p97
aVSo I proudly showed him my clubs.
p98
aVHe said, "Philippe, you have been had.
p99
aVThese are rejects. They are completely out of alignment.
p100
aVThey are impossible to juggle."
p101
aVTenacity is how I kept at it
p102
aVagainst all odds.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers,
p105
aVand I saw \u2014 oh no, no, no, I didn't see.
p106
aVIt was more interesting; I heard.
p107
aVI heard about those amazing men and women
p108
aVwho walk on thin air \u2014
p109
aVthe high-wire walkers.
p110
aVNow I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood,
p111
aVso that's it. I'm 16; I'm becoming a wire walker.
p112
aa(lp113
VI found two trees \u2014
p114
aVbut not any kind of trees,
p115
aVtrees with character \u2014
p116
aVand then a very long rope.
p117
aVAnd I put the rope around and around
p118
aVand around and around and around till I had no more rope.
p119
aVNow I have all of those ropes parallel like this.
p120
aVI get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers,
p121
aVand I gather them together in some kind of ropey path.
p122
aVSo I just created the widest tightrope in the world.
p123
aVWhat did I need? I needed the widest shoes in the world.
p124
aVSo I found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski boots
p125
aVand then wobbly, wobbly I get on the ropes.
p126
aa(lp127
VWell within a few days I'm able to do one crossing.
p128
aVSo I cut one rope off.
p129
aVAnd the next day one rope off.
p130
aVAnd a few days later, I was practicing on a single tightrope.
p131
aVNow you can imagine at that time
p132
aVI had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers.
p133
aVSo that is how \u2014 in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try \u2014
p134
aVthis is how not to learn wire walking.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VIntuition is a tool essential in my life.
p139
aVIn the meantime, I am being thrown out of five different schools
p140
aVbecause instead of listening to the teachers,
p141
aVI am my own teacher, progressing in my new art
p142
aVand becoming a street juggler.
p143
aa(lp144
VOn the high wire, within months,
p145
aVI'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus,
p146
aVexcept I am not satisfied.
p147
aa(lp148
VI was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection.
p149
aVBut nobody wanted to hire me.
p150
aVSo I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission.
p151
aVNotre Dame,
p152
aVthe Sydney Harbor Bridge,
p153
aVthe World Trade Center.
p154
aVAnd I developed a certitude, a faith
p155
aVthat convinced me that I will get safely to the other side.
p156
aVIf not, I will never do that first step.
p157
aa(lp158
VWell nonetheless,
p159
aVon the top of the World Trade Center
p160
aVmy first step was terrifying.
p161
aVAll of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same.
p162
aVManhattan no longer spreads its infinity.
p163
aVThe murmur of the city dissolves into a squall
p164
aVwhose chilling power I no longer feel.
p165
aVI lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge.
p166
aVI step over the beam.
p167
aVI put my left foot on the cable,
p168
aVthe weight of my body raised on my right leg
p169
aVanchored to the flank of the building.
p170
aVShall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left?
p171
aVMy right leg will be unburdened,
p172
aVmy right foot will freely meet the wire.
p173
aVOn one side, a mass of a mountain, a life I know.
p174
aVOn the other, the universe of the clouds,
p175
aVso full of unknown we think it's empty.
p176
aVAt my feet, the path to the north tower \u2014 60 yards of wire rope.
p177
aVIt's a straight line, which sags,
p178
aVwhich sways, which vibrates,
p179
aVwhich rolls on itself,
p180
aVwhich is ice,
p181
aVwhich is three tons tight, ready to explode,
p182
aVready to swallow me.
p183
aVAn inner howl assails me,
p184
aVthe wild longing to flee.
p185
aVBut it is too late.
p186
aVThe wire is ready.
p187
aVDecisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable.
p188
aa(lp189
VFaith is what replaces doubt
p190
aVin my dictionary.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo after the walk
p193
aVpeople ask me, "How can you top that?"
p194
aVWell I didn't have that problem.
p195
aVI was not interested in collecting the gigantic,
p196
aVin breaking records.
p197
aVIn fact, I put my World Trade Center crossing
p198
aVat the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks \u2014
p199
aVor some completely different type of performance.
p200
aVLet's see, such as my street juggling, for example.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo each time
p203
aVI draw my circle of chalk on the pavement
p204
aVand enter as the improvising comic silent character
p205
aVI created 45 years ago,
p206
aVI am as happy as when I am in the clouds.
p207
aa(lp208
VBut this here,
p209
aVthis is not the street.
p210
aVSo I cannot street juggle here, you understand.
p211
aVSo you don't want me to street juggle here, right?
p212
aVYou know that, right?
p213
aVYou don't want me to juggle, right?
p214
aa(lp215
V(Applause)
p216
aa(lp217
V(Music)
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VThank you. Thank you.
p222
aa(lp223
VEach time I street juggle
p224
aVI use improvisation.
p225
aVNow improvisation is empowering
p226
aVbecause it welcomes the unknown.
p227
aVAnd since what's impossible is always unknown,
p228
aVit allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow I have done the impossible not once,
p231
aVbut many times.
p232
aVSo what should I share? Oh, I know. Israel.
p233
aa(lp234
VSome years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival
p235
aVby a high-wire walk.
p236
aVAnd I chose to put my wire
p237
aVbetween the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem
p238
aVover the Ben Hinnom Valley.
p239
aVAnd I thought it would be incredible
p240
aVif in the middle of the wire
p241
aVI stopped and, like a magician,
p242
aVI produce a dove and send her in the sky
p243
aVas a living symbol of peace.
p244
aa(lp245
VWell now I must say,
p246
aVit was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.
p247
aVAnd in my hotel room,
p248
aVeach time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air,
p249
aVshe would graze the wall and end up on the bed.
p250
aVSo I said, now it's okay. The room is too small.
p251
aVI mean, a bird needs space to fly.
p252
aVIt will go perfectly on the day of the walk.
p253
aa(lp254
VNow comes the day of the walk.
p255
aVEighty thousand people spread over the entire valley.
p256
aVThe mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, comes to wish me the best.
p257
aVBut he seemed nervous.
p258
aVThere was tension in my wire,
p259
aVbut I also could feel tension on the ground.
p260
aVBecause all those people
p261
aVwere made up of people who, for the most part,
p262
aVconsidered each other enemies.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo I start the walk. Everything is fine.
p265
aVI stop in the middle.
p266
aVI make the dove appear.
p267
aVPeople applaud in delight.
p268
aVAnd then in the most magnificent gesture,
p269
aVI send the bird of peace into the azure.
p270
aVBut the bird, instead of flying away,
p271
aVgoes flop, flop, flop and lands on my head.
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aVAnd people scream.
p274
aVSo I grab the dove,
p275
aVand for the second time I send her in the air.
p276
aVBut the dove, who obviously didn't go to flying school,
p277
aVgoes flop, flop, flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VYou laugh, you laugh. But hey.
p282
aVI sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers.
p283
aVNow in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.
p284
aVThey must think this guy with this dove,
p285
aVhe must have spent years working with him.
p286
aVWhat a genius, what a professional.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VSo I take a bow. I salute with my hand.
p291
aVAnd at the end I bang my hand against the pole
p292
aVto dislodge the bird.
p293
aVNow the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly,
p294
aVdoes for the third time a little flop, flop, flop
p295
aVand ends up on the wire behind me.
p296
aVAnd the entire valley goes crazy.
p297
aa(lp298
VNow but hold on, I'm not finished.
p299
aVSo now I'm like 50 yards from my arrival
p300
aVand I'm exhausted, so my steps are slow.
p301
aVAnd something happened.
p302
aVSomebody somewhere, a group of people,
p303
aVstarts clapping in rhythm with my steps.
p304
aVAnd within seconds the entire valley
p305
aVis applauding in unison with each of my steps.
p306
aVBut not an applause of delight like before,
p307
aVan applause encouragement.
p308
aVFor a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.
p309
aVThey had become one, pushing me to triumph.
p310
aa(lp311
VI want you just for a second
p312
aVto experience this amazing human symphony.
p313
aVSo let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival.
p314
aVSo I walk, you clap, everybody in unison.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Clapping)
p317
aa(lp318
V(Applause)
p319
aa(lp320
VSo after the walk, Teddy and I become friends.
p321
aVAnd he tells me, he has on his desk a picture of me
p322
aVin the middle of the wire with a dove on my head.
p323
aVHe didn't know the true story.
p324
aVAnd whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation
p325
aVto solve in this hard-to-manage city,
p326
aVinstead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says,
p327
aV"If Philippe can do that, I can do this,"
p328
aVand he goes back to work.
p329
aa(lp330
VInspiration.
p331
aVBy inspiring ourselves
p332
aVwe inspire others.
p333
aVI will never forget this music,
p334
aVand I hope now neither will you.
p335
aVPlease take this music with you home,
p336
aVand start gluing feathers to your arms
p337
aVand take off and fly,
p338
aVand look at the world from a different perspective.
p339
aVAnd when you see mountains,
p340
aVremember mountains can be moved.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VThank you. Thank you.
p345
aVThank you.
p346

VWhen I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,
p5
aV"I gotta call my mother."
p6
aVI have a little Cuban mother \u2014 she's about that big.
p7
aVFour feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.
p8
aVYou still with me? (Laughter)
p9
aVI called her up.
p10
aV"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"
p11
aV"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."
p12
aV"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"
p13
aVI said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people."
p14
aV"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went
p15
aVto the White House."
p16
aV"Ma, don't start!"
p17
aVAnd I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,
p18
aV"What's the problem?"
p19
aVAnd I said, "Well, I'm not sure."
p20
aVI said, "I have to talk to them about stories.
p21
aVIt's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'"
p22
aVAnd she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up,
p23
aVit's entertainment when you tell it,
p24
aVand you're going to use a microphone."
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVI said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?"
p27
aV"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom
p28
aVleaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVThen my pop got on there.
p31
aVMy pop, he's one of the old souls, you know \u2014
p32
aVold Cuban man from Camaguey.
p33
aVCamaguey is a province in Cuba.
p34
aVHe's from Florida.
p35
aVHe was born there in 1924.
p36
aVHe grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,
p37
aVand the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,
p38
aVour old Arawak ancestors.
p39
aVMy father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,
p40
aVand then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.
p41
aV"Papi, help."
p42
aV"I already heard your mother. I think she's right."
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aV"After what I just told you?"
p45
aVMy whole life, my father's been there.
p46
aVSo we talked for a few minutes, and he said,
p47
aV"Why don't you tell them what you believe?"
p48
aVI love that, but we don't have the time.
p49
aVGood storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.
p50
aVGreat story is the art of letting go.
p51
aVSo I'm going to tell you a little story.
p52
aVRemember, this tradition comes to us
p53
aVnot from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,
p54
aVbefore we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,
p55
aVor we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.
p56
aVBack then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.
p57
aVWhen Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.
p58
aVHave you been watching the commercials?
p59
aVBecause every one of us has this desire, for once \u2014 just once \u2014
p60
aVto tell our story and have it heard.
p61
aVThere are stories you tell from stages.
p62
aVThere's stories that you may tell
p63
aVin a small group of people with some good wine.
p64
aVAnd there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,
p65
aVmaybe once in your life.
p66
aVAnd then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.
p67
aVI'm not telling you that story.
p68
aVI'm telling you this one.
p69
aVIt's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."
p70
aVIt's about human connection.
p71
aVMy Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to
p72
aVin that short character sketch,
p73
aVcame to the United States one thousand years ago.
p74
aVI was born in 19 \u2014 I forget, and I came to this country
p75
aVwith them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.
p76
aVWe went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.
p77
aVAnd Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.
p78
aVAnd in that little Southern town, I grew up,
p79
aVand grew up hearing these stories.
p80
aVBut this story only happened a few years ago.
p81
aVI called my mom.
p82
aVIt was a Saturday morning.
p83
aVAnd I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.
p84
aVIt's delicious. It's savory.
p85
aVIt makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth \u2014
p86
aVis that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know?
p87
aVThat kind of food, yeah.
p88
aVThis is the sensory part of the program, people.
p89
aVI called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.
p90
aVI need to go to the mall, and you know your father now,
p91
aVhe takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go.
p92
aVI got an errand to run."
p93
aVLet me parenthetically pause here and tell you \u2014
p94
aVEsther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago,
p95
aVto the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.
p96
aVAny vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child,
p97
aVguys, naturally included flashing, blue lights.
p98
aVBut she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue,
p99
aVand when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport.
p100
aV"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?"
p101
aV(Spanish)
p102
aV"You don't speak English?"
p103
aV"No."
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVBut eventually, every dog has its day,
p106
aVand she ended up in traffic court,
p107
aVwhere she bartered with the judge for a discount.
p108
aVThere's a historical marker.
p109
aVBut now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.
p110
aVAnd that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up
p111
aVto take her to have her hair dyed, you know,
p112
aVthat peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit,
p113
aVyou know, same color as the Buick.
p114
aVAnybody? All right.
p115
aVLittle picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops.
p116
aVRockports \u2014 they're for this.
p117
aVThat's why they call them that.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVThis is her ensemble.
p120
aVAnd this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning
p121
aVwhen I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.
p122
aVI'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's.
p123
aVI show up. She's in the carport.
p124
aVOf course, they have a carport.
p125
aVThe kind with the corrugated roof, you know.
p126
aVThe Buick's parked outside,
p127
aVand she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys.
p128
aV"I got a surprise for you, baby!"
p129
aV"We taking your car?"
p130
aV"Not we, I."
p131
aVAnd she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.
p132
aVSomebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me.
p133
aVOh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.
p134
aVIssued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.
p135
aVBlithering fucking idiots.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVI said, "Is that thing real?"
p138
aV"I think so."
p139
aV"Can you even see?"
p140
aV"I guess I must."
p141
aV"Oh, Jesus."
p142
aVShe gets into the car \u2014 she's sitting on two phone books.
p143
aVI can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.
p144
aVShe's engineered an umbrella so she can \u2014 bam! \u2014 slam the door.
p145
aVHer daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone
p146
aVin the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed.
p147
aV"You coming? You no coming?"
p148
aV"Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?"
p149
aV"Are you kidding me?"
p150
aV"How are you doing it?"
p151
aV"He's got to sleep sometime."
p152
aVAnd so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me
p153
aVif I let her go by herself, and we get in the car.
p154
aVPuts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.
p155
aVI am buckling in seatbelts from the front.
p156
aVI'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots.
p157
aVI mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.
p158
aVI've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about?
p159
aVAnd she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of
p160
aVbirth breathing \u2014 you know, that one?
p161
aVOnly a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.
p162
aVAnd I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"
p163
aVBecause now she's picked up the Highway 285,
p164
aVthe perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now \u2014
p165
aVthere's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all.
p166
aVI said, "Ma, pick a lane!"
p167
aV"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them."
p168
aVAnd there she goes, right.
p169
aVI don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.
p170
aVSo, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.
p171
aVIt'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe.
p172
aV"Mommy, I know you have been stopped."
p173
aV"No, no, what you talking about?"
p174
aV"You have a license. How long have you been driving?"
p175
aV"Four or five days."
p176
aV"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?"
p177
aV"I did not get a ticket."
p178
aVI said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on."
p179
aV"OK, so I stopped at a light
p180
aVand there's a guy, you know, in the back."
p181
aV"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform
p182
aVand a terrified look on his face?"
p183
aV"You weren't there, don't start."
p184
aV"Come on. You got a ticket?"
p185
aV"No." She explained,
p186
aV"The man" \u2014 I have to tell you as she did,
p187
aVbecause it loses something if I don't, you know \u2014
p188
aV"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this,
p189
aVwhich tells me he's pretty old, you know.
p190
aVSo I look up and I'm thinking,
p191
aVmaybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute."
p192
aV"Ma, are you still doing that?"
p193
aV"If it works, it works, baby.
p194
aVSo, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.'
p195
aVWell, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps."
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aVSo he's talking to her, and at some point she says,
p198
aV"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done."
p199
aV"Yeah? What?
p200
aVHe gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?"
p201
aV"No, I look up, and the light, she change."
p202
aV(Laughter)
p203
aVYou should be terrified.
p204
aVNow, I don't know if she's toying with me,
p205
aVkind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse \u2014
p206
aVleft paw, right paw, left paw, right paw \u2014
p207
aVbut by now, we've reached the mall.
p208
aVNow, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?
p209
aVTalk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.
p210
aVAudience: Yes.
p211
aVCarmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory,
p212
aVpraying to that saint of perpetual availability
p213
aVthat as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along,
p214
aVsome guy's going to turn on the brake lights
p215
aVjust as you pull up behind him.
p216
aVBut that doesn't happen most of the time, right?
p217
aVSo, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?"
p218
aV"You mean, like, in the car?"
p219
aV"No, don't \u2014 why are we here today?
p220
aVIt's Saturday. It's the holidays."
p221
aV"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear."
p222
aVNow, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking,
p223
aVthat you really have to \u2014 you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren,
p224
aVthis woman's mind.
p225
aVDo I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor \u2014
p226
aVenough metaphors for you? \u2014 somewhere, I may not get out.
p227
aVBut you know.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aV"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?
p230
aVAnd why? What is wrong with his underwear?"
p231
aV"It will upset you."
p232
aV"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?"
p233
aV"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.
p234
aVI sent him to the store, which was my first mistake,
p235
aVand he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers,
p236
aVand he's supposed to buy the boxers."
p237
aV"Why?"
p238
aV"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children."
p239
aV"Oh, my God!"
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVOlivia? Huh? Huh?
p242
aVBy now, we have now crawled another four feet,
p243
aVand my mother finally says to me, "I knew it, I knew it.
p244
aVI'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there."
p245
aVAnd she points out the passenger window, and I look out,
p246
aVand three \u2014 three \u2014 aisles down,
p247
aV"Look, the Chevy."
p248
aVYou want to laugh, but you don't know \u2014
p249
aVyou're that politically corrected, have you noticed?
p250
aVCorrect the other direction now, it's OK.
p251
aV"Look, the Chevy \u2014 he's coming this way."
p252
aV"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away."
p253
aVShe looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child,
p254
aVthe cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.
p255
aV"I know that, honey. Get out of the car
p256
aVand go stand in the parking space till I get there."
p257
aVOK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.
p258
aVHow many of you once in your \u2014 you were a kid, you were an adult \u2014
p259
aVyou stood in a parking space to hold it for someone?
p260
aVSee, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVAnd years of therapy later, we're doing great.
p263
aVWe're doing great. We're doing fine.
p264
aVWell, I stood up to her.
p265
aVThis is \u2014 you know, you'd think by now I'm \u2014 and still holding?
p266
aVI said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life."
p267
aVOf course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?"
p268
aV(Spanish)
p269
aVAnd she's still talking while she puts the car in park,
p270
aVhits the emergency brake, opens the door,
p271
aVand with a spryness astounding in a woman her age,
p272
aVshe jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books,
p273
aVand then she walks around \u2014
p274
aVshe's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her \u2014
p275
aVaround the front of the car.
p276
aVShe has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too.
p277
aVBefore I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot
p278
aVand in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of
p279
aVusual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah.
p280
aV"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.
p281
aVI scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books.
p282
aVThis is new and fast, just so you \u2014 are you still with us?
p283
aVWe'll wait for the slow ones. OK.
p284
aVI start, and this is where a child says to me \u2014
p285
aVand the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before,
p286
aVbecause this is my laconic child.
p287
aVA brevity, brevity of everything with this child.
p288
aVYou know, she eats small portions.
p289
aVLanguage is something to be meted out
p290
aVin small phonemes, you know \u2014 just little hmm, hmm-hmm.
p291
aVShe carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.
p292
aVShe wields great power.
p293
aVShe listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first.
p294
aVBut she pauses occasionally and says,
p295
aV"How do you spell that? What year? OK."
p296
aVWhen she writes the expose in about 20 years,
p297
aVdon't believe a word of it.
p298
aVBut this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter,
p299
aVmy borderline Asperger's kid.
p300
aVBless you, Dr. Watson.
p301
aVShe says, "Ma, you got to look!"
p302
aVNow, when this kid says I got to look, you know.
p303
aVBut it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.
p304
aVI grew up with this woman.
p305
aVI said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't."
p306
aV"No, mama, you got to look."
p307
aVI got to look. You got to look.
p308
aVDon't you want to look?
p309
aVThere she is.
p310
aVI look in bewildered awe:
p311
aVshe's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded.
p312
aVShe's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it.
p313
aVShe's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force
p314
aVof her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like,
p315
aV"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!"
p316
aV(Laughter)
p317
aVReady? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.
p318
aV"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.
p319
aVHoney, sit up so they can see you."
p320
aVOh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
p321
aVI finally come \u2014 and now, it's the South.
p322
aVI don't know what part of the country you live in.
p323
aVI think we all secretly love stories.
p324
aVWe all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear.
p325
aVWe want to curl up and say, "Tell it to me, tell it to me.
p326
aVCome on, honey, tell it to me."
p327
aVBut in the South, we love a good story.
p328
aVPeople have pulled aside,
p329
aVI mean, they've come out of that queue line,
p330
aVthey have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks.
p331
aVBets are placed.
p332
aV"I'm with the little lady. Damn!"
p333
aV(Laughter)
p334
aVAnd she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement.
p335
aVShe is, after all, Cuban.
p336
aVI'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break."
p337
aVLike you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah.
p338
aVI pull in. I put the car in park.
p339
aVEngine's still running \u2014 mine, not the car.
p340
aVI jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!"
p341
aV"I'm not going anywhere."
p342
aVShe's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.
p343
aVI come out, and there's Esther.
p344
aVShe's hugging the purse.
p345
aV"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.
p346
aV(Laughter)
p347
aV"Ma, have you no shame?
p348
aVPeople are watching us all around," right?
p349
aVNow, some of them you've got to make up, people.
p350
aVSecret of the trade.
p351
aVGuess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there.
p352
aVSome, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there.
p353
aVShe says this to me.
p354
aVAfter I say \u2014 let me refresh you \u2014
p355
aV"have you no shame?"
p356
aV"No. I gave it up with pantyhose \u2014 they're both too binding."
p357
aV(Laughter)
p358
aV(Applause)
p359
aVYeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.
p360
aVI'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.
p361
aVIntrepid soul.
p362
aVI'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?
p363
aVShe jumped out of that car."
p364
aVThat's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.
p365
aVIt's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.
p366
aV(Laughter)
p367
aVI turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman,
p368
aVa little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.
p369
aVWith her is a young man \u2014 husband, brother, lover, it's not my job.
p370
aVAnd she says, "Pardon me, ma'am" \u2014 that's how we talk down there \u2014
p371
aV"is that your mother?"
p372
aVI said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots
p373
aVto see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"
p374
aVThe boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" \u2014
p375
aVthey look at each other, it's a knowing glance \u2014 "God, she's crazy!"
p376
aVI said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say,
p377
aV"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing."
p378
aVI said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK,
p379
aVbecause I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon,
p380

VPlease close your eyes,
p5
aVand open your hands.
p6
aVNow imagine what you could place in your hands:
p7
aVan apple, maybe your wallet.
p8
aVNow open your eyes.
p9
aVWhat about a life?
p10
aa(lp11
VWhat you see here is a premature baby.
p12
aVHe looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive
p13
aVbecause he can't regulate his own body temperature.
p14
aVThis baby is so tiny he doesn't have
p15
aVenough fat on his body to stay warm.
p16
aVSadly, 20 million babies like this
p17
aVare born every year around the world.
p18
aVFour million of these babies die annually.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive
p21
aVgrow up with severe, long-term health problems.
p22
aVThe reason is because in the first month of a baby's life,
p23
aVits only job is to grow.
p24
aVIf it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally,
p25
aVresulting in a range of health problems
p26
aVfrom diabetes, to heart disease,
p27
aVto low I.Q.
p28
aVImagine: Many of these problems could be prevented
p29
aVif these babies were just kept warm.
p30
aa(lp31
VThat is the primary function of an incubator.
p32
aVBut traditional incubators require electricity
p33
aVand cost up to 20 thousand dollars.
p34
aVSo, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.
p35
aVAs a result, parents resort to local solutions
p36
aVlike tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies,
p37
aVor placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here \u2014
p38
aVmethods that are both ineffective and unsafe.
p39
aVI've seen this firsthand over and over again.
p40
aa(lp41
VOn one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha,
p42
aVwho had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.
p43
aVShe took her baby to the nearest village clinic,
p44
aVand the doctor advised her to take Rani
p45
aVto a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.
p46
aVBut that hospital was over four hours away,
p47
aVand Sevitha didn't have the means to get there,
p48
aVso her baby died.
p49
aa(lp50
VInspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this,
p51
aVmy team and I realized what was needed was a local solution,
p52
aVsomething that could work without electricity,
p53
aVthat was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,
p54
aVgiven that the majority of births still take place in the home.
p55
aVWe needed something that was portable,
p56
aVsomething that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies
p57
aVand something ultra-low-cost,
p58
aVcompared to the 20,000 dollars
p59
aVthat an incubator in the U.S. costs.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo, this is what we came up with.
p62
aVWhat you see here looks nothing like an incubator.
p63
aVIt looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.
p64
aVYou can open it up completely. It's waterproof.
p65
aVThere's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.
p66
aVBut the magic is in this pouch of wax.
p67
aVThis is a phase-change material.
p68
aVIt's a wax-like substance with a melting point
p69
aVof human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.
p70
aVYou can melt this simply using hot water
p71
aVand then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature
p72
aVfor four to six hours at a time,
p73
aVafter which you simply reheat the pouch.
p74
aVSo, you then place it into this little pocket back here,
p75
aVand it creates a warm micro-environment
p76
aVfor the baby.
p77
aa(lp78
VLooks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times
p79
aVby going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians
p80
aVto ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.
p81
aVWe plan to launch this product in India in 2010,
p82
aVand the target price point will be 25 dollars,
p83
aVless than 0.1 percent of the cost
p84
aVof a traditional incubator.
p85
aa(lp86
VOver the next five years we hope to save the lives
p87
aVof almost a million babies.
p88
aVBut the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.
p89
aVThis seems counterintuitive,
p90
aVbut turns out that as infant mortality is reduced,
p91
aVpopulation sizes also decrease,
p92
aVbecause parents don't need to anticipate
p93
aVthat their babies are going to die.
p94
aVWe hope that the Embrace infant warmer
p95
aVand other simple innovations like this
p96
aVrepresent a new trend for the future of technology:
p97
aVsimple, localized, affordable solutions
p98
aVthat have the potential to make huge social impact.
p99
aa(lp100
VIn designing this we followed a few basic principles.
p101
aVWe really tried to understand the end user,
p102
aVin this case, people like Sevitha.
p103
aVWe tried to understand the root of the problem
p104
aVrather than being biased by what already exists.
p105
aVAnd then we thought of the most simple solution we could
p106
aVto address this problem.
p107
aVIn doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.
p108
aVAnd we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.

VI'm excited to be here to speak about vets,
p5
aVbecause I didn't join the Army
p6
aVbecause I wanted to go to war.
p7
aVI didn't join the Army because I had a lust
p8
aVor a need to go overseas and fight.
p9
aVFrankly, I joined the Army because
p10
aVcollege is really damn expensive,
p11
aVand they were going to help with that,
p12
aVand I joined the Army because
p13
aVit was what I knew,
p14
aVand it was what I knew that I thought I could do well.
p15
aa(lp16
VI didn't come from a military family.
p17
aVI'm not a military brat.
p18
aVNo one in my family ever had joined the military at all,
p19
aVand how I first got introduced to the military
p20
aVwas when I was 13 years old
p21
aVand I got sent away to military school,
p22
aVbecause my mother had been threatening me
p23
aVwith this idea of military school ever since I was eight years old.
p24
aa(lp25
VI had some issues when I was coming up,
p26
aVand my mother would always tell me, she's like,
p27
aV"You know, if you don't get this together,
p28
aVI'm going to send you to military school."
p29
aVAnd I'd look at her, and I'd say, "Mommy,
p30
aVI'll work harder."
p31
aVAnd then when I was nine years old,
p32
aVshe started giving me brochures to show me she wasn't playing around,
p33
aVso I'd look at the brochures, and I'm like,
p34
aV"Okay, Mommy, I can see you're serious, and I'll work harder."
p35
aVAnd then when I was 10 and 11,
p36
aVmy behavior just kept on getting worse.
p37
aVI was on academic and disciplinary probation
p38
aVbefore I hit double digits,
p39
aVand I first felt handcuffs on my wrists
p40
aVwhen I was 11 years old.
p41
aVAnd so when I was 13 years old,
p42
aVmy mother came up to me, and she was like,
p43
aV"I'm not going to do this anymore.
p44
aVI'm going to send you to military school."
p45
aVAnd I looked at her, and I said, "Mommy,
p46
aVI can see you're upset, and I'm going to work harder."
p47
aVAnd she was like, "No, you're going next week."
p48
aVAnd that was how I first got introduced
p49
aVto this whole idea of the military,
p50
aVbecause she thought this was a good idea.
p51
aa(lp52
VI had to disagree with her wholeheartedly
p53
aVwhen I first showed up there,
p54
aVbecause literally in the first four days,
p55
aVI had already run away five times from this school.
p56
aVThey had these big black gates that surrounded the school,
p57
aVand every time they would turn their backs,
p58
aVI would just simply run out of the black gates
p59
aVand take them up on their offer that if we don't want to be there,
p60
aVwe can leave at any time.
p61
aVSo I just said, "Well, if that's the case,
p62
aVthen I'd like to leave." (Laughter)
p63
aVAnd it never worked.
p64
aVAnd I kept on getting lost.
p65
aa(lp66
VBut then eventually,
p67
aVafter staying there for a little while,
p68
aVand after the end of that first year
p69
aVat this military school,
p70
aVI realized that I actually was growing up.
p71
aVI realized the things that I enjoyed about this school
p72
aVand the thing that I enjoyed about the structure
p73
aVwas something that I'd never found before:
p74
aVthe fact that I finally felt like I was part of something bigger,
p75
aVpart of a team, and it actually mattered to people
p76
aVthat I was there,
p77
aVthe fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there,
p78
aVbut that it was a real, actually core part
p79
aVof the entire experience.
p80
aVAnd so when it was time for me to actually
p81
aVfinish up high school,
p82
aVI started thinking about what I wanted to do,
p83
aVand just like probably most students,
p84
aVhad no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do.
p85
aVAnd I thought about the people who I
p86
aVrespected and admired.
p87
aVI thought about a lot of the people,
p88
aVin particular a lot of the men, in my life
p89
aVwho I looked up to.
p90
aVThey all happened to wear the uniform
p91
aVof the United States of America,
p92
aVso for me, the question and the answer
p93
aVreally became pretty easy.
p94
aVThe question of what I wanted to do
p95
aVwas filled in very quickly with saying,
p96
aVI guess I'll be an Army officer.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo the Army then went through this process
p99
aVand they trained me up,
p100
aVand when I say I didn't join the Army
p101
aVbecause I wanted to go to war,
p102
aVthe truth is, I joined in 1996.
p103
aVThere really wasn't a whole lot going on.
p104
aVI didn't ever feel like I was in danger.
p105
aVWhen I went to my mom,
p106
aVI first joined the Army when I was 17 years old,
p107
aVso I literally needed parental permission
p108
aVto join the Army,
p109
aVso I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom,
p110
aVand she just assumed it was kind of like military school.
p111
aVShe was like, "Well, it was good for him before,
p112
aVso I guess I'll just let him keep doing it,"
p113
aVhaving no idea that the paperwork that she was signing
p114
aVwas actually signing her son up
p115
aVto become an Army officer.
p116
aVAnd I went through the process,
p117
aVand again the whole time still just thinking,
p118
aVthis is great, maybe I'll serve on a weekend,
p119
aVor two weeks during the year, do drill,
p120
aVand then a couple years after I signed up,
p121
aVa couple years after my mother signed those papers,
p122
aVthe whole world changed.
p123
aVAnd after 9/11, there was an entirely new context
p124
aVabout the occupation that I chose.
p125
aVWhen I first joined, I never joined to fight,
p126
aVbut now that I was in,
p127
aVthis is exactly what was now going to happen.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd I thought about so much about the soldiers
p130
aVwho I eventually had to end up leading.
p131
aVI remember when we first, right after 9/11,
p132
aVthree weeks after 9/11, I was on a plane heading overseas,
p133
aVbut I wasn't heading overseas with the military,
p134
aVI was heading overseas because I got a scholarship
p135
aVto go overseas.
p136
aVI received the scholarship to go overseas
p137
aVand to go study and live overseas,
p138
aVand I was living in England and that was interesting,
p139
aVbut at the same time, the same people who
p140
aVI was training with,
p141
aVthe same soldiers that I went through all my training with,
p142
aVand we prepared for war,
p143
aVthey were now actually heading over to it.
p144
aVThey were now about to find themselves
p145
aVin the middle of places the fact is
p146
aVthe vast majority of people,
p147
aVthe vast majority of us as we were training,
p148
aVcouldn't even point out on a map.
p149
aVI spent a couple years finishing graduate school,
p150
aVand the whole entire time while I'm sitting there
p151
aVin buildings at Oxford
p152
aVthat were literally built hundreds of years
p153
aVbefore the United States was even founded,
p154
aVand I'm sitting there talking to dons
p155
aVabout the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand,
p156
aVand how that influenced the start of World War I,
p157
aVwhere the entire time my heart and my head
p158
aVwere on my soldiers
p159
aVwho were now throwing on Kevlars
p160
aVand grabbing their flak vests
p161
aVand figuring out how exactly do I change around
p162
aVor how exactly do I clean a machine gun
p163
aVin the darkness.
p164
aVThat was the new reality.
p165
aa(lp166
VBy the time I finished that up and I rejoined
p167
aVmy military unit and we were getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan,
p168
aVthere were soldiers in my unit who were now
p169
aVon their second and third deployments
p170
aVbefore I even had my first.
p171
aVI remember walking out with my unit for the first time,
p172
aVand when you join the Army
p173
aVand you go through a combat tour,
p174
aVeveryone looks at your shoulder,
p175
aVbecause on your shoulder is your combat patch.
p176
aVAnd so immediately as you meet people,
p177
aVyou shake their hand,
p178
aVand then your eyes go to their shoulder,
p179
aVbecause you want to see where did they serve,
p180
aVor what unit did they serve with?
p181
aVAnd I was the only person walking around
p182
aVwith a bare shoulder,
p183
aVand it burned every time someone stared at it.
p184
aa(lp185
VBut you get a chance to talk to your soldiers,
p186
aVand you ask them why did they sign up.
p187
aVI signed up because college was expensive.
p188
aVA lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons.
p189
aVThey signed up because of a sense of obligation.
p190
aVThey signed up because they were angry
p191
aVand they wanted to do something about it.
p192
aVThey signed up because
p193
aVtheir family said this was important.
p194
aVThey signed up because they wanted some form of revenge.
p195
aVThey signed for a whole collection of different reasons.
p196
aVAnd now we all found ourselves overseas
p197
aVfighting in these conflicts.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd what was amazing to me was that I
p200
aVvery naively started hearing this statement
p201
aVthat I never fully understood,
p202
aVbecause right after 9/11, you start hearing this idea
p203
aVwhere people come up to you and they say,
p204
aV"Well, thank you for your service."
p205
aVAnd I just kind of followed in and started saying
p206
aVthe same things to all my soldiers.
p207
aVThis is even before I deployed.
p208
aVBut I really had no idea what that even meant.
p209
aVI just said it because it sounded right.
p210
aVI said it because it sounded like the right thing to say
p211
aVto people who had served overseas.
p212
aV"Thank you for your service."
p213
aVBut I had no idea what the context was
p214
aVor what that even,
p215
aVwhat it even meant to the people who heard it.
p216
aa(lp217
VWhen I first came back from Afghanistan,
p218
aVI thought that if you make it back from conflict,
p219
aVthen the dangers were all over.
p220
aVI thought that if you made it back from a conflict zone
p221
aVthat somehow you could kind of
p222
aVwipe the sweat off your brow and say,
p223
aV"Whew, I'm glad I dodged that one,"
p224
aVwithout understanding that for so many people,
p225
aVas they come back home,
p226
aVthe war keeps going.
p227
aVIt keeps playing out in all of our minds.
p228
aVIt plays out in all of our memories.
p229
aVIt plays out in all of our emotions.
p230
aVPlease forgive us
p231
aVif we don't like being in big crowds.
p232
aVPlease forgive us
p233
aVwhen we spend one week in a place
p234
aVthat has 100 percent light discipline,
p235
aVbecause you're not allowed to walk around with white lights,
p236
aVbecause if anything has a white light,
p237
aVit can be seen from miles away,
p238
aVversus if you use little green
p239
aVor little blue lights,
p240
aVthey cannot be seen from far away.
p241
aVSo please forgive us if out of nowhere,
p242
aVwe go from having 100 percent light discipline
p243
aVto then a week later being back in the middle of Times Square,
p244
aVand we have a difficult time adjusting to that.
p245
aVPlease forgive us
p246
aVwhen you transition back to a family
p247
aVwho has completely been maneuvering without you,
p248
aVand now when you come back, it's not that easy
p249
aVto fall back into a sense of normality,
p250
aVbecause the whole normal has changed.
p251
aa(lp252
VI remember when I came back, I wanted to talk to people.
p253
aVI wanted people to ask me about my experiences.
p254
aVI wanted people to come up to me and tell me,
p255
aV"What did you do?"
p256
aVI wanted people to come up to me and tell me,
p257
aV"What was it like? What was the food like?
p258
aVWhat was the experience like? How are you doing?"
p259
aVAnd the only questions I got from people was,
p260
aV"Did you shoot anybody?"
p261
aVAnd those were the ones who were even curious
p262
aVenough to say anything.
p263
aVBecause sometimes there's this fear
p264
aVand there's this apprehension that if I say anything,
p265
aVI'm afraid I'll offend,
p266
aVor I'm afraid I'll trigger something,
p267
aVso the common default is just saying nothing.
p268
aVThe problem with that
p269
aVis then it feels like your service
p270
aVwas not even acknowledged,
p271
aVlike no one even cared.
p272
aV"Thank you for your service,"
p273
aVand we move on.
p274
aVWhat I wanted to better understand
p275
aVwas what's behind that,
p276
aVand why "thank you for your service" isn't enough.
p277
aVThe fact is, we have literally
p278
aV2.6 million men and women
p279
aVwho are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan
p280
aVwho are all amongst us.
p281
aVSometimes we know who they are,
p282
aVsometimes we don't,
p283
aVbut there is that feeling, the shared experience,
p284
aVthe shared bond
p285
aVwhere we know that that experience
p286
aVand that chapter of our life,
p287
aVwhile it might be closed,
p288
aVit's still not over.
p289
aa(lp290
VWe think about "thank you for your service,"
p291
aVand people say, "So what does 'thank you for your service' mean to you?"
p292
aVWell, "Thank you for your service" means to me,
p293
aVit means acknowledging our stories,
p294
aVasking us who we are,
p295
aVunderstanding the strength
p296
aVthat so many people, so many people who we serve with, have,
p297
aVand why that service means so much.
p298
aV"Thank you for your service" means acknowledging the fact
p299
aVthat just because we've now come home
p300
aVand we've taken off the uniform
p301
aVdoes not mean our larger service to this country
p302
aVis somehow over.
p303
aVThe fact is, there's still a tremendous amount
p304
aVthat can be offered and can be given.
p305
aVWhen I look at people
p306
aVlike our friend Taylor Urruela,
p307
aVwho in Iraq loses his leg,
p308
aVhad two big dreams in his life.
p309
aVOne was to be a soldier. The other was to be a baseball player.
p310
aVHe loses his leg in Iraq.
p311
aVHe comes back
p312
aVand instead of deciding that,
p313
aVwell, now since I've lost my leg, that second dream is over,
p314
aVhe decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball,
p315
aVand he starts this group called VETSports,
p316
aVwhich now works with veterans all over the country
p317
aVand uses sports as a way of healing.
p318
aVPeople like Tammy Duckworth,
p319
aVwho was a helicopter pilot
p320
aVand with the helicopter that she was flying,
p321
aVyou need to use both your hands
p322
aVand also your legs to steer,
p323
aVand her helicopter gets hit,
p324
aVand she's trying to steer the chopper,
p325
aVbut the chopper's not reacting
p326
aVto her instructions and to her commands.
p327
aVShe's trying to land the chopper safely,
p328
aVbut the chopper doesn't land safely,
p329
aVand the reason it's not landing safely
p330
aVis because it's not responding to the commands that her legs are giving
p331
aVbecause her legs were blown off.
p332
aVShe barely survives.
p333
aVMedics come and they save her life,
p334
aVbut then as she's doing her recuperation back at home,
p335
aVshe realizes that, "My job's still not done."
p336
aVAnd now she uses her voice
p337
aVas a Congresswoman from Illinois
p338
aVto fight and advocate for a collection of issues
p339
aVto include veterans issues.
p340
aa(lp341
VWe signed up because
p342
aVwe love this country we represent.
p343
aVWe signed up because
p344
aVwe believe in the idea and we believe in the people
p345
aVto our left and to our right.
p346
aVAnd the only thing we then ask is that
p347
aV"thank you for your service"
p348
aVneeds to be more than just a quote break,
p349
aVthat "thank you for your service" means
p350
aVhonestly digging in
p351
aVto the people who have stepped up
p352
aVsimply because they were asked to,
p353
aVand what that means for us not just now,
p354
aVnot just during combat operations,
p355
aVbut long after the last vehicle has left
p356
aVand after the last shot has been taken.
p357
aa(lp358
VThese are the people who I served with,
p359
aVand these are the people who I honor.
p360
aVSo thank you for your service.

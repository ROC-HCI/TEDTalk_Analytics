VHere's my thing.
p5
aVHold on. There I go. Hey.
p6
aVI want to start today \u2014 talk about the structure of a polypeptide.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VI get a lot of people asking me, in terms of "Lost," you know,
p11
aV"What the hell's that island?"
p12
aVYou know, it's usually followed by,
p13
aV"No, seriously, what the hell is that island?"
p14
aa(lp15
VWhy so many mysteries?
p16
aVWhat is it about mystery that I seem to be drawn to?
p17
aVAnd I was thinking about this, what to talk about at TED.
p18
aVWhen I talked to the kind rep from TED,
p19
aVand I said, "Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"
p20
aVHe said, "Don't worry about it. Just be profound."
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd I took enormous comfort in that.
p25
aVSo thank you, if you're here.
p26
aa(lp27
VI was trying to think, what do I talk about? Good question.
p28
aVWhy do I do so much stuff that involves mystery?
p29
aVAnd I started trying to figure it out.
p30
aVAnd I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do,
p31
aVand I started thinking about my grandfather.
p32
aVI loved my grandfather.
p33
aVHarry Kelvin was his name, my mother's father.
p34
aVHe died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.
p35
aVAnd one of the reasons he was amazing:
p36
aVAfter World War II, he began an electronics company.
p37
aVHe started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.
p38
aVSo he had this incredible curiosity.
p39
aVAs a kid, I saw him come over to me
p40
aVwith radios and telephones and all sorts of things.
p41
aVAnd he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them and reveal the inner workings \u2014
p42
aVwhich many of us, I'm sure, take for granted.
p43
aVBut it's an amazing gift to give a kid.
p44
aVTo open up this thing and show how it works
p45
aVand why it works and what it is.
p46
aVHe was the ultimate deconstructor, in many ways.
p47
aVAnd my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart,
p48
aVbut he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts,
p49
aVlike, you know, printing, like the letter press.
p50
aVI'm obsessed with printing.
p51
aVI'm obsessed with silk-screening and bookbinding and box making.
p52
aVWhen I was a kid, I was always, like, taking apart boxes and stuff.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd last night in the hotel, I took apart the Kleenex box.
p55
aVI was just looking at it. And I'm telling you \u2014
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VIt's a beautiful thing. I swear to God.
p60
aVI mean, when you look at the box and you sort of see how it works.
p61
aVRives is here, and I met him years ago at a book fair;
p62
aVhe does pop-up books.
p63
aVAnd I'm obsessed with engineering of paper.
p64
aVThe scoring of it, the printing of it,
p65
aVwhere the thing gets glued, the registration marks for the ink.
p66
aVI just love boxes.
p67
aVMy grandfather was the guy
p68
aVwho kind of got me into all sorts of these things.
p69
aVHe would also supply me with tools.
p70
aVHe was this amazing encourager \u2014 this patron, sort of, to make stuff.
p71
aVAnd he got me a Super 8 camera when I was 10 years old.
p72
aVAnd in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,
p73
aVto be a 10-year-old kid that had access to a camera.
p74
aVAnd you know, he was so generous; I couldn't believe it.
p75
aVHe wasn't doing it entirely without some manipulation.
p76
aVI mean, I would call him, and I'd be like,
p77
aV"Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.
p78
aVYou don't understand. This is, like, I want to make movies.
p79
aVI'll get invited to TED one day \u2014"
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd, you know, my grandmother was the greatest.
p84
aVBecause she'd be like, you know \u2014 she'd get on the phone.
p85
aVShe'd be like, "Harry, it's better than the drugs.
p86
aVShe was fantastic.
p87
aVSo I found myself getting this stuff, thanks to her assist,
p88
aVand suddenly, you know,
p89
aVI had a synthesizer when I was 14 years old \u2014
p90
aVthis kind of stuff.
p91
aVAnd it let me make things, which, to me, was sort of the dream.
p92
aVHe sort of humored my obsession to other things too, like magic.
p93
aVThe thing is, we'd go to this magic store in New York City
p94
aVcalled Lou Tannen's Magic.
p95
aVIt was this great magic store.
p96
aVIt was a crappy little building in Midtown,
p97
aVbut you'd be in the elevator, the elevator would open \u2014
p98
aVthere'd be this little, small magic store.
p99
aVYou'd be in the magic store. And it was a magical place.
p100
aVSo I got all these magic tricks. Here. I'll show you.
p101
aVThis is the kind of thing. So it would be like, you know.
p102
aVWhich is good, but now I can't move.
p103
aVNow, I have to do the rest of the thing like this.
p104
aVI'm like, "Oh, wow. Look at my computer over there!"
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VSo one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this:
p109
aVTannen's Mystery Magic Box.
p110
aVThe premise behind the Mystery Magic Box was the following:
p111
aV15 dollars buys you 50 dollars worth of magic.
p112
aVWhich is a savings.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding.
p117
aVIf you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened.
p118
aVBut I've had this forever.
p119
aVNow, I was looking at this,
p120
aVit was in my office, as it always is, on the shelf,
p121
aVand I was thinking, why have I not opened this?
p122
aVAnd why have I kept it?
p123
aVBecause I'm not a pack rat.
p124
aVI don't keep everything,
p125
aVbut for some reason I haven't opened this box.
p126
aVAnd I felt like there was a key to this, somehow,
p127
aVin talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before,
p128
aVand bored people elsewhere.
p129
aVSo I thought, maybe there's something with this.
p130
aVAnd there was this giant question mark.
p131
aVI love the design, for what it's worth, of this thing.
p132
aVAnd I started thinking, why haven't I opened it?
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd I realized that I haven't opened it
p135
aVbecause it represents something important \u2014 to me.
p136
aVIt represents my grandfather.
p137
aVAm I allowed to cry at TED?
p138
aVBecause \u2014 no, I'm not going to cry.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VBut \u2014
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VThe thing is that it represents infinite possibility.
p147
aVIt represents hope. It represents potential.
p148
aVAnd what I love about this box,
p149
aVand what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do,
p150
aVis I find myself drawn to infinite possibility,
p151
aVthat sense of potential.
p152
aVAnd I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination.
p153
aVNow, it's not the most ground-breaking idea,
p154
aVbut when I started to think that maybe there are times
p155
aVwhen mystery is more important than knowledge.
p156
aVI started getting interested in this.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd so I started thinking about "Lost" and the stuff that we do,
p159
aVand I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do!
p160
aVIn the creation of "Lost," Damon Lindelof and I,
p161
aVwho created the show with me,
p162
aVwe were basically tasked with creating this series
p163
aVthat we had very little time to do.
p164
aVWe had 11 and a half weeks
p165
aVto write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it, cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.
p166
aVSo it was not a lot of time.
p167
aVAnd that sense of possibility \u2014 what could this thing be?
p168
aVThere was no time to develop it.
p169
aVI'm sure you're all familiar with people
p170
aVwho tell you what you can't do and what you should change.
p171
aVThere was no time for that, which is kind of amazing.
p172
aVAnd so we did this show,
p173
aVand for those of you who haven't seen it, or don't know it,
p174
aVI can show you one little clip from the pilot,
p175
aVjust to show you some stuff that we did.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Engine roaring)
p178
aa(lp179
V(Video) Claire: Help!
p180
aa(lp181
VPlease help me!
p182
aVHelp me! Please, help me!
p183
aa(lp184
VJack: Get him out of here! Get him away from the engine!
p185
aVGet him out of here!
p186
aa(lp187
V(Engine roaring)
p188
aa(lp189
VC: Help me, please! I'm having contractions!
p190
aa(lp191
VJ: How many months pregnant are you?
p192
aa(lp193
VC: I'm only eight months.
p194
aa(lp195
VJ: And how far apart are they coming?
p196
aa(lp197
VC: I don't know. I think it just happened.
p198
aa(lp199
VMan: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from \u2014
p200
aa(lp201
VJJ Abrams: 10 years ago, if we wanted to do that,
p202
aVwe'd have to kill a stuntman.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VIt would be harder.
p207
aVTake two would be a bitch.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VSo the amazing thing was, we were able to do this thing.
p212
aVAnd part of that was the amazing availability of technology,
p213
aVknowing we could do anything.
p214
aVI mean, we could never have done that.
p215
aVWe might have been able to write it;
p216
aVwe wouldn't have been able to depict it like we did.
p217
aVSo part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process,
p218
aVtechnology is mind-blowingly inspiring to me.
p219
aVI realize that that blank page is a magic box, you know?
p220
aVIt needs to be filled with something fantastic.
p221
aa(lp222
VI used to have the "Ordinary People" script that I'd flip through.
p223
aVThe romance was amazing to me; it would inspire me.
p224
aVI wanted to try and fill pages
p225
aVwith the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion
p226
aVthat that script did.
p227
aVSo, you know, I love Apple computers.
p228
aVI'm obsessed.
p229
aVSo the Apple computer \u2014 the PowerBook \u2014 this computer,
p230
aVit challenges me.
p231
aVIt basically says, what are you going to write worthy of me?
p232
aVI feel this \u2014 I'm compelled.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd I often am like, you know, dude, today I'm out.
p237
aVI got nothing. You know? So there's that.
p238
aa(lp239
VIn terms of the content of it,
p240
aVyou look at stories, you think, what are stories but mystery boxes?
p241
aVThere's a fundamental question \u2014 in TV, the first act is called the teaser.
p242
aVIt's literally the teaser. It's the big question.
p243
aVSo you're drawn into it. Then there's another question.
p244
aVAnd it goes on. Look at "Star Wars."
p245
aVThe droids meet the mysterious woman.
p246
aVWho's that? We don't know. Mystery box! Then you meet Luke Skywalker.
p247
aVHe gets the droid, you see the holographic image.
p248
aVYou learn it's a message. She wants to find Obi Wan Kenobi.
p249
aVHe's her only hope. But who's Obi Wan Kenobi?
p250
aVMystery box! So then he meets Ben Kenobi.
p251
aVBen Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi. Holy shit! So it keeps us \u2014
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VHave you guys not seen that?
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VIt's huge! Anyway \u2014
p260
aVSo there's this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled.
p261
aVThen there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination \u2014
p262
aVthe withholding of information.
p263
aVYou know, doing that intentionally is much more engaging.
p264
aVWhether it's like the shark in "Jaws" \u2014
p265
aVif Spielberg's mechanical shark, Bruce, had worked,
p266
aVit would not be remotely as scary; you would have seen it too much.
p267
aVIn "Alien", they never really showed the alien: terrifying!
p268
aVEven in a movie like a romantic comedy, "The Graduate,"
p269
aVthey're having that date, and they're in the car,
p270
aVand it's loud, and so they put the top up.
p271
aVYou don't hear anything they're saying!
p272
aVYou can't hear a word! But it's the most romantic date ever.
p273
aVAnd you love it because you don't hear it.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo to me, there's that. And then, finally, there's this idea \u2014
p276
aVstretching the paradigm a little bit \u2014
p277
aVbut the idea of the mystery box.
p278
aVMeaning, what you think you're getting, then what you're really getting.
p279
aVAnd it's true in so many movies and stories.
p280
aVLook at "E.T.," for example \u2014
p281
aV"E.T." is this unbelievable movie about what?
p282
aVIt's about an alien who meets a kid, right?
p283
aVWell, it's not. "E.T." is about divorce.
p284
aV"E.T." is about a heartbroken, divorce-crippled family,
p285
aVand ultimately, this kid who can't find his way.
p286
aV"Die Hard," right? Crazy, great, fun, action-adventure movie in a building.
p287
aVIt's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce.
p288
aVHe's showing up to L.A., tail between his legs.
p289
aVThere are great scenes \u2014
p290
aVmaybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time,
p291
aVbut pretty great scenes.
p292
aVThere's a half an hour of investment in character
p293
aVbefore you get to the stuff that you're expecting.
p294
aa(lp295
VWhen you look at a movie like "Jaws,"
p296
aVthe scene that you expect \u2014 we have the screen?
p297
aVThese are the kind of scenes
p298
aVthat you remember and expect from "Jaws."
p299
aVAnd she's being eaten;
p300
aVthere's a shark.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Woman screaming)
p303
aa(lp304
VThe thing about "Jaws" is, it's really about a guy
p305
aVwho is sort of dealing with his place in the world \u2014 with his masculinity,
p306
aVwith his family, how he's going to, you know, make it work in this new town.
p307
aVThis is one of my favorite scenes ever,
p308
aVand this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of
p309
aVwhen you think of "Jaws." But it's an amazing scene.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Video) Father: C'mere.
p312
aVGive us a kiss.
p313
aa(lp314
VSon: Why?
p315
aa(lp316
VFather: 'Cause I need it.
p317
aa(lp318
VJJA: Come on. "Why? 'Cause I need it"?
p319
aVBest scene ever, right?
p320
aa(lp321
V(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VCome on! So you think of "Jaws" \u2014
p324
aVso that's the kind of stuff that,
p325
aVlike, you know \u2014 the investment of character,
p326
aVwhich is the stuff that really is inside the box, you know?
p327
aVIt's why when people do sequels, or rip off movies, you know, of a genre,
p328
aVthey're ripping off the wrong thing.
p329
aVYou're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster.
p330
aVYou know, if you rip something off \u2014 rip off the character.
p331
aVRip off the stuff that matters.
p332
aVI mean, look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you.
p333
aVBecause ultimately, the mystery box is all of us.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo there's that. Then the distribution.
p336
aVWhat's a bigger mystery box than a movie theater? You know?
p337
aVYou go to the theater, you're just so excited to see anything.
p338
aVThe moment the lights go down is often the best part.
p339
aVAnd you're full of that amazing \u2014 that feeling of excited anticipation.
p340
aVAnd often, the movie's there and it's going,
p341
aVand then something happens and you go, "Oh \u2014", and then, "Mmm ..."
p342
aVWhen it's a great movie, you're along for the ride
p343
aVbecause you're willing to give yourself to it.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo to me, whether it's a TV, an iPod, computer, cell phone \u2014
p346
aVIt's funny, I'm an \u2014 as I said, Apple fanatic \u2014
p347
aVand one day, about a year or so ago,
p348
aVI was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs' keynote,
p349
aVbecause I always do.
p350
aVAnd he came on, he was presenting the video iPod,
p351
aVand what was on the enormous iPod behind him?
p352
aV"Lost"! I had no idea!
p353
aVAnd I realized, holy shit, it'd come full circle.
p354
aVThe inspiration I get from the technology
p355
aVis now using the stuff that I do to sell technology. It's nuts!
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VI was going to show you a couple of other things I'm going to skip.
p360
aVI'll show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything.
p361
aVThis is something online; six years ago, they did this.
p362
aVThis is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience.
p363
aVBut the point was, that they were doing things
p364
aVthat were using these mystery boxes that they had \u2014 everyone has now.
p365
aVWhat I've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid,
p366
aVeveryone has access to now.
p367
aVYou don't need to have my grandfather, though you wish you had.
p368
aVBut I have to tell you \u2014
p369
aVthis is a guy doing stuff on a Quadra 950 computer \u2014
p370
aVthe resolution's a little bit low \u2014
p371
aVusing Infinity software they stopped making 15 years ago.
p372
aVHe's doing stuff that looks as amazing
p373
aVas stuff I've seen released from Hollywood.
p374
aa(lp375
VThe most incredible sort of mystery, I think,
p376
aVis now the question of what comes next.
p377
aVBecause it is now democratized.
p378
aVSo now, the creation of media \u2014 it's everywhere.
p379
aVThe stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid
p380
aVis now ubiquitous.
p381
aVAnd so, there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there.
p382
aVAnd when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now
p383
aVwho would have been silenced, you know \u2014
p384
aVwho have been silenced in the past \u2014
p385
aVit's a very exciting thing.
p386
aa(lp387
VI used to say in classes and lectures and stuff,
p388
aVto someone who wants to write, "Go! Write! Do your thing."
p389
aVIt's free, you don't need permission.
p390
aVBut now I can say, "Go make your movie!" There's nothing stopping you
p391
aVfrom going out there and getting the technology.
p392
aVYou can lease, rent, buy stuff off the shelf
p393
aVthat is either as good, or just as good,
p394
aVas the stuff that's being used by the, you know, "legit people."
p395
aVNo community is best served when only the elite have control.
p396
aVAnd I feel like this is an amazing opportunity
p397
aVto see what else is out there.
p398
aa(lp399
VWhen I did "Mission: Impossible III," we had amazing visual effects.
p400
aVILM did the effects; it was incredible.
p401
aVAnd sort of my dream to be involved.
p402
aVAnd there are a couple of sequences in the movie,
p403
aVlike these couple of moments I'll show you.
p404
aVThere's that.
p405
aa(lp406
V(Video) Luther: Ethan, move!
p407
aa(lp408
V(Explosion)
p409
aa(lp410
VObviously, I have an obsession with big crazy explosions.
p411
aVSo my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you.
p412
aVIt's a scene in which Tom's character wakes up.
p413
aVHe's drowsy. He's crazy.
p414
aVAnd the guy wakes up, and he shoves this gun in his nose
p415
aVand shoots this little capsule into his brain
p416
aVthat he's going to use later to kill him, as bad guys do.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Video) Brownway: Good morning.
p419
aa(lp420
VJJA: OK, now.
p421
aVWhen we shot that scene,
p422
aVthe actor who had the gun, an English actor, Eddie Marsan \u2014
p423
aVsweetheart, great guy \u2014
p424
aVhe kept taking the gun and putting it into Tom's nose,
p425
aVand it was hurting Tom's nose.
p426
aVAnd I learned this very early on in my career:
p427
aVDon't hurt Tom's nose.
p428
aa(lp429
V(Laughter)
p430
aa(lp431
VThere are three things you don't want to do.
p432
aVNumber two is: Don't hurt Tom's nose.
p433
aVSo Eddie has this gun \u2014 and he's this sweet English guy.
p434
aVHe's like, "Sorry, I don't want to hurt you."
p435
aVI'm like, "We have to make this look good."
p436
aVAnd I realized that we had to do something because it wasn't working.
p437
aVAnd I thought back to what I would have done
p438
aVusing the Super 8 camera that my grandfather got me
p439
aVsitting in that room,
p440
aVand I realized that hand didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's.
p441
aVIt could be Tom's.
p442
aVAnd Tom would know just how hard to push the gun.
p443
aVHe wouldn't hurt himself.
p444
aa(lp445
VSo we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie's.
p446
aVWe put it in Eddie's sleeve,
p447
aVand so the hand that you see \u2014
p448
aVthat's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's. So Tom is playing two roles.
p449
aa(lp450
V(Laughter)
p451
aa(lp452
VAnd he didn't ask for any more money.
p453
aVSo here, here. Watch it again.
p454
aVThere he is. He's waking up.
p455
aVHe's drowsy, been through a lot.
p456
aa(lp457
V(Video) Brownway: Good morning.
p458
aa(lp459
VJJA: Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand.
p460
aVAnyway.
p461
aVSo ...
p462
aa(lp463
V(Applause)
p464
aa(lp465
VThanks.
p466
aa(lp467
V(Applause)
p468
aa(lp469
VSo you don't need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies.
p470
aVAnd the mystery box, in honor of my grandfather, stays closed.
p471
aa(lp472
VThank you.
p473

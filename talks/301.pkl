VI thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.
p5
aVAnd I like to immerse myself in my topics.
p6
aVI just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.
p7
aVAnd I see my life as a series of experiments.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,
p10
aVI wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life,"
p11
aVwhere I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,
p12
aVto live my life for me.
p13
aVSo, they answered my emails.
p14
aVThey answered my phone.
p15
aVThey argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.
p16
aVIt was the best month of my life,
p17
aVbecause I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.
p18
aVIt was a wonderful experience.
p19
aa(lp20
VMore recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called \u2014
p21
aVabout radical honesty.
p22
aVAnd this is a movement where \u2014
p23
aVthis is started by a psychologist in Virginia,
p24
aVwho says that you should never, ever lie,
p25
aVexcept maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.
p26
aVAnd, more than that, whatever is on your brain
p27
aVshould come out of your mouth.
p28
aVSo, I decided I would try this for a month.
p29
aVThis was the worst month of my life.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVI do not recommend this at all.
p32
aVTo give you a sense of the experience,
p33
aVthe article was called, "I Think You're Fat."
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVSo, that was hard.
p36
aa(lp37
VMy most recent book \u2014 my previous book was called "The Know-It-All,"
p38
aVand it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica
p39
aVfrom A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,
p40
aVor more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,
p41
aVall the way to Zwyiec, which is \u2014 well, I don't want to ruin the ending.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVIt's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.
p44
aVBut I love that one,
p45
aVbecause that was an experiment about how much information
p46
aVone human brain could absorb.
p47
aVAlthough, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.
p48
aVYou can just Google it.
p49
aVSo, I wasted some time there.
p50
aa(lp51
VI love those experiments,
p52
aVbut I think that the most profound
p53
aVand life-changing experiment that I've done
p54
aVis my most recent experiment, where I spent a year
p55
aVtrying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,
p56
aV"The Year of Living Biblically."
p57
aVAnd I undertook this for two reasons.
p58
aVThe first was that I grew up with no religion at all.
p59
aVAs I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way
p60
aVthe Olive Garden is Italian.
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVSo, not very.
p63
aVBut I've become increasingly interested in religion.
p64
aVI do think it's the defining issue of our time,
p65
aVor one of the main ones.
p66
aVAnd I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.
p67
aVSo, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe second reason I undertook this is because
p70
aVI'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,
p71
aVreligious fundamentalism, and people who say
p72
aVthey take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,
p73
aVas high as 45 or 50 percent of America.
p74
aVSo I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?
p75
aVI decided to take it to its logical conclusion
p76
aVand take everything in the Bible literally,
p77
aVwithout picking and choosing.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.
p80
aVI had Christian bibles.
p81
aVI had Jewish bibles.
p82
aVA friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,
p83
aVwhere the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that,"
p84
aVas opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd."
p85
aa(lp86
VThen I went down and I read several versions,
p87
aVand I wrote down every single law that I could find.
p88
aVAnd this was a very long list \u2014 over 700 rules.
p89
aVAnd they range from the famous ones that I had heard of \u2014
p90
aVThe Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.
p91
aVSo I wanted to follow those.
p92
aVAnd actually, I take my projects very seriously,
p93
aVbecause I had twins during my year,
p94
aVso I definitely take my projects seriously.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut I also wanted to follow the hundreds
p97
aVof arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.
p98
aVThere is the law in Leviticus,
p99
aV"You cannot shave the corners of your beard."
p100
aVI didn't know where my corners were,
p101
aVso I decided to let the whole thing grow,
p102
aVand this is what I looked like by the end.
p103
aVAs you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVMy wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.
p106
aVSo, certainly the challenge was there.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,
p109
aVso I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it."
p110
aVYou only know if you try it.
p111
aVI got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.
p112
aVThe Bible says that if two men are in a fight,
p113
aVand the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,
p114
aVthen her hand shall be cut off.
p115
aVSo, I wanted to follow that rule.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aVThat one I followed by default,
p118
aVby not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,
p119
aVlooking like she had a strong grip.
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aVSo \u2014 oh, there's another shot of my beard.
p122
aa(lp123
VI will say it was an amazing year
p124
aVbecause it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.
p125
aVAnd there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.
p126
aVThe first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.
p127
aVYou know, I could spend a year not killing,
p128
aVbut spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying \u2014
p129
aVyou know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,
p130
aVso this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,
p133
aVbecause I couldn't believe how much
p134
aVmy behavior changed my thoughts.
p135
aVThis was one of the huge lessons of the year,
p136
aVis that I almost pretended to be a better person,
p137
aVand I became a little bit of a better person.
p138
aVSo I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind,
p139
aVand you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around.
p140
aVYou change your behavior, and you change your mind.
p141
aVSo, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,
p142
aVyou visit sick people in the hospital,
p143
aVand you will become more compassionate.
p144
aVYou donate money to a cause,
p145
aVand you become emotionally involved in that cause.
p146
aVSo, it really was cognitive psychology \u2014
p147
aVyou know, cognitive dissonance \u2014 that I was experiencing.
p148
aVThe Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,
p149
aVvery primitive cognitive psychology.
p150
aVIn the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,
p151
aVwhich, as we know, is actually true.
p152
aa(lp153
VThe second type of rule that was difficult to obey
p154
aVwas the rules that will get you into a little trouble
p155
aVin twenty-first-century America.
p156
aVAnd perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVBut it's a big part of the Bible,
p159
aVso I figured I had to address it.
p160
aVSo, I was able to stone one adulterer.
p161
aVIt happened \u2014 I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,
p162
aVso sandals and sort of a white robe,
p163
aVyou know, because again, the outer affects the inner.
p164
aVI wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.
p165
aVAnd this man came up to me and he said,
p166
aV"Why are you dressed like that?"
p167
aVAnd I explained my project,
p168
aVand he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"
p169
aVAnd I said, "Well, that would be great!"
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVAnd I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket
p172
aVthat I had been carrying around for weeks,
p173
aVhoping for just this interaction \u2014 and, you know, they were pebbles \u2014
p174
aVbut he grabbed them out of my hand.
p175
aVHe was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.
p176
aVBut he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.
p177
aVHe grabbed them out of my hand
p178
aVand threw them at my face, and I felt that I could \u2014
p179
aVeye for an eye \u2014 I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me
p182
aVto talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.
p183
aVHow can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,
p184
aVand yet so incredibly wise in others?
p185
aVHow should we view the Bible?
p186
aVShould we view it, you know, as original intent,
p187
aVlike a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?
p188
aVHow was the Bible written?
p189
aVAnd actually, since this is a tech crowd,
p190
aVI talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me
p191
aVof the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors
p192
aVover hundreds of years.
p193
aVAnd it's sort of evolved.
p194
aVIt's not a book that was written and came down from on high.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo I thought I would end by telling you
p197
aVjust a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons
p198
aVthat I learned from my year.
p199
aVThe first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.
p200
aVThis became very, very clear, early on.
p201
aVBecause if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,
p202
aVand stoning adulterers, or \u2014 here's another example.
p203
aVWell, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVIt's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut this one is \u2014 the Bible says that you cannot touch women
p208
aVduring certain times of the month, and more than that,
p209
aVyou cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.
p210
aVAnd my wife thought this was very offensive,
p211
aVso she sat in every seat in our apartment,
p212
aVand I had to spend much of the year standing
p213
aVuntil I bought my own seat and carried it around.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo, you know, I met with creationists.
p216
aVI went to the creationists' museum.
p217
aVAnd these are the ultimate literalists.
p218
aVAnd it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.
p219
aVI would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.
p220
aVIt's just that their faith is so strong
p221
aVin this literal interpretation of the Bible
p222
aVthat they distort all the data to fit their model.
p223
aVAnd they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.
p226
aVThey really did a fantastic job.
p227
aVIf you're ever in Kentucky,
p228
aVthere's, you can see a movie of the flood,
p229
aVand they have sprinklers in the ceiling
p230
aVthat will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.
p231
aVSo, whatever you think of creationism \u2014 and I think it's crazy \u2014
p232
aVthey did a great job.
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VAnother lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.
p236
aVAnd this one was a big lesson because I was praying,
p237
aVgiving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.
p238
aVBut I was saying thanks all the time, every day,
p239
aVand I started to change my perspective.
p240
aVAnd I started to realize the hundreds of little things
p241
aVthat go right every day, that I didn't even notice,
p242
aVthat I took for granted, as opposed to focusing
p243
aVon the three or four that went wrong.
p244
aVSo, this is actually a key to happiness for me,
p245
aVis to just remember when I came over here,
p246
aVthe car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.
p247
aVIt's a remarkable thing.
p248
aa(lp249
VThird, that thou shall have reverence.
p250
aVThis one was unexpected because I started the year
p251
aVas an agnostic, and by the end of the year,
p252
aVI became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.
p253
aVAnd I'm trying to start it as a movement.
p254
aVSo, if anyone wants to join,
p255
aVthe basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,
p256
aVthere's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,
p257
aVand that our rituals can be sacred.
p258
aVThe Sabbath can be sacred.
p259
aVThis was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,
p260
aVbecause I am a workaholic, so having this one day
p261
aVwhere you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.
p262
aVSo, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.
p263
aa(lp264
VThou shall not stereotype.
p265
aVThis one happened because
p266
aVI spent a lot of time with various religious communities
p267
aVthroughout America because I wanted it to be more
p268
aVthan about my journey.
p269
aVI wanted it to be about religion in America.
p270
aVSo, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.
p271
aVI'm very proud because
p272
aVI think I'm the only person in America
p273
aVto out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVAfter three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,
p276
aVhe's like, "I gotta go."
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aVOh, thank you very much.
p279
aVThank you. Bless you, bless you.
p280
aa(lp281
VBut it was interesting
p282
aVbecause I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,
p283
aVevangelical Christianity, and I found that
p284
aVit's such a wide and varied movement
p285
aVthat it is difficult to make generalizations about it.
p286
aVThere's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,
p287
aVand they focus on the red words in the Bible,
p288
aVwhich are the ones that Jesus spoke.
p289
aVThat's how they printed them in the old Bibles.
p290
aVAnd their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.
p291
aVThey have a pamphlet that says,
p292
aV"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,"
p293
aVand you open it up, and there's nothing in it.
p294
aVSo, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,
p295
aVhelping poor people.
p296
aVSo, this was very inspiring to me.
p297
aVI recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.
p298
aVThey're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree
p299
aVwith much of what they say.
p300
aa(lp301
VAlso, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.
p302
aVThis one was very unexpected because, you know,
p303
aVI grew up with the scientific worldview,
p304
aVand I was shocked learning how much of my life
p305
aVis governed by irrational forces.
p306
aVAnd the thing is, if they're not harmful,
p307
aVthey're not to be completely dismissed.
p308
aVBecause I learned that \u2014 I was thinking, I was
p309
aVdoing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,
p310
aVseparating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people
p311
aV"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"
p312
aVAnd they said, "We don't know,
p313
aVbut it's just rituals that give us meaning."
p314
aVAnd I would say, "But that's crazy."
p315
aVAnd they would say, "Well, what about you?
p316
aVYou blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.
p317
aVIf a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy
p318
aVblowing out the fire on top of a cake
p319
aVversus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,
p320
aVwould the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,
p321
aVbut that guy's crazy?'"
p322
aVSo no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.
p323
aVSo the key is to choose the right rituals,
p324
aVthe ones that are not harmful \u2014 but rituals by themselves
p325
aVare not to be dismissed.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.
p328
aVAnd this one I learned because
p329
aVI tried to follow everything in the Bible.
p330
aVAnd I failed miserably.
p331
aVBecause you can't.
p332
aVYou have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible
p333
aVis going to be picking and choosing.
p334
aVThe key is to pick and choose the right parts.
p335
aVThere's the phrase called cafeteria religion,
p336
aVand the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,
p337
aVand they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.
p338
aVYou're just picking and choosing."
p339
aVBut my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?"
p340
aVI've had some great meals at cafeterias.
p341
aVI've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.
p342
aVSo, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,
p343
aVabout tolerance, about loving your neighbor,
p344
aVas opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,
p345
aVor intolerance, or violence,
p346
aVwhich are very much in the Bible as well.
p347
aVSo if we are to find any meaning in this book,
p348
aVthen we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd I thought I'd end with just a couple more.
p351
aVThere's me reading the Bible.
p352
aVThat's how I hailed taxicabs.
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aVSeriously, and it worked. And yes,
p355
aVthat was actually a rented sheep,
p356
aVso I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.
p357
aVSo, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.

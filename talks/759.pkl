VWhen my brother called me in December of 1998,
p5
aVhe said, "The news does not look good."
p6
aVThis is him on the screen.
p7
aVHe'd just been diagnosed with ALS,
p8
aVwhich is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.
p9
aVIt paralyzes you. It starts by killing
p10
aVthe motor neurons in your spinal cord.
p11
aVAnd you go from being a healthy,
p12
aVrobust 29-year-old male
p13
aVto someone that cannot breathe,
p14
aVcannot move, cannot speak.
p15
aa(lp16
VThis has actually been, to me, a gift,
p17
aVbecause we began a journey
p18
aVto learn a new way of thinking about life.
p19
aVAnd even though Steven passed away three years ago
p20
aVwe had an amazing journey as a family.
p21
aVWe did not even \u2014
p22
aVI think adversity is not even the right word.
p23
aVWe looked at this and we said, "We're going to do something with this
p24
aVin an incredibly positive way."
p25
aVAnd I want to talk today
p26
aVabout one of the things that we decided to do,
p27
aVwhich was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.
p28
aVBecause, as we all know here today,
p29
aVit doesn't work very well.
p30
aVI want to talk about it in the context of a story.
p31
aa(lp32
VThis is the story of my brother.
p33
aVBut it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,
p34
aVand go to something more.
p35
aV"Given my status, what is the best outcome
p36
aVI can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"
p37
aVis what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.
p38
aVAnd those questions all have variables to them.
p39
aVAll of our statuses are different.
p40
aVAll of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish,
p41
aVis different, and our paths will be different,
p42
aVthey are all stories.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut it's a story until we convert it to data
p45
aVand so what we do, this concept we had,
p46
aVwas to take Steven's status, "What is my status?"
p47
aVand go from this concept of walking, breathing,
p48
aVand then his hands, speak,
p49
aVand ultimately happiness and function.
p50
aVSo, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man
p51
aVon his icon,
p52
aVbut the rest of them are really what's important here.
p53
aVBecause Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,
p54
aVas he was in that pool, he could not walk,
p55
aVhe could not use his arms \u2014 that's why he had the little floaty things on them,
p56
aVdid you see those? \u2014
p57
aVhe was happy. We were at the beach,
p58
aVhe was raising his son, and he was productive.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd we took this, and we converted it into data.
p61
aVBut it's not a data point at that one moment in time.
p62
aVIt is a data point of Steven in a context.
p63
aVHere he is in the pool. But here he is healthy,
p64
aVas a builder: taller, stronger,
p65
aVgot all the women, amazing guy.
p66
aVHere he is walking down the aisle,
p67
aVbut he can barely walk now, so it's impaired.
p68
aVAnd he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes,
p69
aVcan't feed himself.
p70
aVAnd here he is, paralyzed completely,
p71
aVunable to breathe and move, over this time journey.
p72
aVThese stories of his life, converted to data.
p73
aVHe renovated my carriage house
p74
aVwhen he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,
p75
aVand unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo, here's Steven alone, sharing this story in the world.
p78
aVAnd this is the insight, the thing that we are
p79
aVexcited about,
p80
aVbecause we have gone away from the community that we are,
p81
aVthe fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.
p82
aVWe need to give to others to be successful.
p83
aVSo, Steven is sharing this story,
p84
aVbut he is not alone.
p85
aVThere are so many other people sharing their stories.
p86
aVNot stories in words, but stories in data and words.
p87
aVAnd we convert that information into this structure,
p88
aVthis understanding, this ability to convert
p89
aVthose stories into something that is computable,
p90
aVto which we can begin to change the way
p91
aVmedicine is done and delivered.
p92
aa(lp93
VWe did this for ALS. We can do this for depression,
p94
aVParkinson's disease, HIV.
p95
aVThese are not simple, they are not internet scalable;
p96
aVthey require thought and processes
p97
aVto find the meaningful information about the disease.
p98
aVSo, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.
p99
aVAnd I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me,
p100
aVthe company that myself, my youngest brother
p101
aVand a good friend from MIT started.
p102
aa(lp103
VHere are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now,
p104
aVsharing their stories as data.
p105
aVHere is an M.S. patient.
p106
aVHis name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired
p107
aVon cognition, vision, walking, sensation.
p108
aVThose are things that are different for each M.S. patient.
p109
aVEach of them can have a different characteristic.
p110
aVYou can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.
p111
aVLook at this HIV patient down here, Zinny.
p112
aVIt's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there.
p113
aVBut he is working to keep his CD4 count high
p114
aVand his viral level low so he can make his life better.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.
p117
aVLook at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone.
p118
aVThese are patients currently on drugs,
p119
aVsharing data.
p120
aVI love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.
p121
aVAnyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study
p122
aVon prayer against something? Let's look at prayer.
p123
aVWhat I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems.
p124
aVThese are why people pray.
p125
aVHere is the schedule of how frequently they \u2014 it's a dose.
p126
aVSo, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day,
p127
aVand see if they're doing better, they probably are.
p128
aVHere they are. It's an open network,
p129
aVeverybody is sharing. We can see it all.
p130
aa(lp131
VOr, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety.
p132
aVAnd here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.
p133
aVHow they treat it,
p134
aVthe drugs, the components of it,
p135
aVtheir side effects, all of it in a rich environment,
p136
aVand you can drill down and see the individuals.
p137
aVThis amazing data allows us to drill down and see
p138
aVwhat this drug is for \u2014
p139
aV1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes.
p140
aVI want to talk to the 58 patients down here
p141
aVwho are taking four milligrams a day.
p142
aVAnd I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing
p143
aVit for more than two years.
p144
aVSo, you can see the duration.
p145
aVAll open, all available.
p146
aVI'm going to log in.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd this is my brother's profile.
p149
aVAnd this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now.
p150
aVThis is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash.
p151
aVAnd you can see here, as this animates over,
p152
aVSteven's actual data against the background of all other patients,
p153
aVagainst this information.
p154
aVThe blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile,
p155
aVthat he has non-genetic ALS.
p156
aVYou scroll down in this profile and you can see
p157
aVall of his prescription drugs,
p158
aVbut more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively.
p159
aVWait, poor spinal capacity.
p160
aa(lp161
VDoesn't this remind you of a great stock program?
p162
aVWouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves
p163
aVwas as good as the technology we use to make money?
p164
aVDetrol. In the side effects for his drug,
p165
aVintegrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had,
p166
aVthe first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it.
p167
aa(lp168
VI love here \u2014 the cyberkinetics implant,
p169
aVwhich was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.
p170
aVYou can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.
p171
aVYou can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS.
p172
aVSo, you click down on the ALS tab there.
p173
aVI'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental.
p174
aVI can look at my constipation, how to manage it.
p175
aVI can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects
p176
aVfrom that drug all integrated in the time
p177
aVin which they're meaningful.
p178
aa(lp179
VBut I want more.
p180
aVI don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this
p181
aVdata and make something even better.
p182
aVI want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms
p183
aVand his drugs,
p184
aVand all of the things that interact among those,
p185
aVthe side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy
p186
aVthat we can look at in any way we want to understand it,
p187
aVso that we can take this information
p188
aVand go beyond just this simple model
p189
aVof what a record is.
p190
aa(lp191
VI don't even know what a medical record is.
p192
aVI want to solve a problem. I want an application.
p193
aVSo, can I take this data \u2014 rearrange yourself,
p194
aVput the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top,
p195
aVtell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else,
p196
aVand what interacts.
p197
aVYears after he's had these drugs,
p198
aVI learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva,
p199
aVincluding some positive side effects that came from other drugs,
p200
aVwere making his constipation worse.
p201
aVAnd if anyone's ever had severe constipation,
p202
aVand you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life \u2014
p203
aVyes, that was a pun.
p204
aa(lp205
VYou're trying to manage these,
p206
aVand this grid is available here,
p207
aVand we want to understand it.
p208
aVNo one's ever had this kind of information.
p209
aVSo, patients have this. We're for patients.
p210
aVThis is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network.
p211
aVThis is about the patients.
p212
aVSo, how can we take this and bring them a tool
p213
aVthat they can go back and they can engage the medical system?
p214
aVAnd we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,
p215
aV"What's something we can use all the time,
p216
aVthat we can use in the medical care system,
p217
aVthat everyone will understand?"
p218
aa(lp219
VSo, the patients print it out,
p220
aVbecause hospitals usually block us
p221
aVbecause they believe we are a social network.
p222
aVIt's actually the most used feature on the website.
p223
aVDoctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged.
p224
aVSo, we went from this story of Steven
p225
aVand his history to data, and then back to paper,
p226
aVwhere we went back and engaged the medical care system.
p227
aVAnd here's another paper.
p228
aVThis is a journal, PNAS \u2014
p229
aVI think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science
p230
aVof the United States of America.
p231
aVYou've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about
p232
aVthe amazing things they've done.
p233
aVThis is a report about a drug called lithium.
p234
aVLithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,
p235
aVthat a group in Italy found
p236
aVslowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow, we'll skip the critiques of the paper.
p239
aVBut the short story is: If you're a patient,
p240
aVyou want to be on the blue line.
p241
aVYou don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.
p242
aVBecause the blue line is a better line. The red line
p243
aVis way downhill, the blue line is a good line.
p244
aVSo, you know we said \u2014 we looked at this, and what I love also
p245
aVis that people always accuse these Internet sites
p246
aVof promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.
p247
aVSo, this is what happened when PNAS published this.
p248
aVTen percent of the people in our system took lithium.
p249
aVTen percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data
p250
aVin a bad publication.
p251
aVAnd they call the Internet irresponsible.
p252
aVHere's the implication of what happens.
p253
aa(lp254
VThere's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil,
p255
aVwho unfortunately passed away nine months ago,
p256
aVwho said, "Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?
p257
aVBecause I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years.
p258
aVI want to know now. Can you help us?"
p259
aVSo, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.
p260
aVWe let them share the data and exchange it.
p261
aVYou know, a data network.
p262
aVAnd they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM,
p263
aVcan you guys tell us whether this works or not?"
p264
aVAnd we went around and we talked to people,
p265
aVand they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know?
p266
aVYou don't have the blinding, you don't have data,
p267
aVit doesn't follow the scientific method.
p268
aVIt's never going to work. You can't do it."
p269
aa(lp270
VSo, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder."
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aVI can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,
p273
aVbut I can say whether it works in Humberto.
p274
aVI bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over,
p275
aVand I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine
p276
aVthat came in Leopard. And we said \u2014 because it's really cool,
p277
aVyou can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer,
p278
aVand find everything you've lost, and I loved it.
p279
aVAnd I said, "What if we built a time machine for patients,
p280
aVexcept instead of going backwards, we go forwards.
p281
aVCan we find out what's going to happen to you,
p282
aVso that you can maybe change it?"
p283
aa(lp284
VSo, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto,
p285
aVThat's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time
p286
aVto build our own. This is a real app by the way.
p287
aVThis is not just graphics.
p288
aVAnd you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring
p289
aVtheir data together. And we bring their histories into it.
p290
aVAnd then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?"
p291
aVSo, we line them all up so they go together
p292
aVaround the meaningful points,
p293
aVintegrated across everything we know about the patient.
p294
aVFull information, the entire course of their disease.
p295
aVAnd that's what is going to happen to Humberto,
p296
aVunless he does something.
p297
aVAnd he took lithium, and he went down the line.
p298
aVAnd it works almost every time.
p299
aa(lp300
VNow, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting.
p301
aVBut almost all the time it works.
p302
aVIt's actually scary. It's beautiful.
p303
aVSo, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.
p304
aVBut we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.
p305
aVAnd yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power
p306
aVand all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.
p307
aVBut here is the answer
p308
aVof the mean of the patients that actually decided
p309
aVto take lithium.
p310
aVThese are all the patients that started lithium.
p311
aVIt's the Intent to Treat Curve.
p312
aVYou can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones,
p313
aVthose are the people in the study in PNAS
p314
aVthat you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones,
p315
aVthe pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be.
p316
aVAnd the ones in the middle are all of our patients
p317
aVfrom the start of lithium at time zero,
p318
aVgoing forward, and then going backward.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.
p321
aVTerrifyingly accurate matching.
p322
aVAnd going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
p323
aVYou're actually doing slightly worse \u2014 not significantly,
p324
aVbut slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
p325
aVBut you know, a lot of people dropped out,
p326
aVthe trial, there is too much drop out.
p327
aVCan we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients
p328
aVthat actually decided to stay on lithium,
p329
aVbecause they were so convinced they were getting better?
p330
aa(lp331
VWe asked our control algorithm,
p332
aVare those 69 patients \u2014 by the way, you'll notice
p333
aVthat's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial \u2014
p334
aVcan we look at those patients and say,
p335
aV"Can we match them with our time machine
p336
aVto the other patients that are just like them,
p337
aVand what happens?"
p338
aVEven the ones that believed they were getting better
p339
aVmatched the controls exactly. Exactly.
p340
aVThose little lines? That's the power.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo, we \u2014 I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you
p343
aVthat if you did it at a higher dose
p344
aVor if you run the study proper \u2014 I can tell you
p345
aVthat for those 69 people that took lithium,
p346
aVthey didn't do any better than the people that were just like them,
p347
aVjust like me,
p348
aVand that we had the power to detect that at about
p349
aVa quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.
p350
aVWe did that one year ahead of the time
p351
aVwhen the first clinical trial funded by the NIH
p352
aVfor millions of dollars failed for futility last week,
p353
aVand announced it.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant.
p356
aVI never really knew whether it worked.
p357
aVAnd I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna,
p358
aVin his lumbar cord,
p359
aVand filled out the IRBs and did all this work,
p360
aVand I never really knew.
p361
aVHow did I not know?
p362
aVI mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.
p363
aVI actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group \u2014
p364
aVwe actually searched for about a year to find someone
p365
aVwho could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling
p366
aVin healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.
p367
aVAnd there are these guys who used to model the future
p368
aVof interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.
p369
aVAnd some of them were available. So, we hired one.
p370
aV(Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
VWe hired them, set them up, assisting at lab.
p373
aVI I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him,
p374
aVis like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said,
p375
aV"Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant
p376
aVworked or not?"
p377
aVAnd he sent me this two days ago.
p378
aVIt was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?
p379
aVWe have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.
p380
aVBecause something went different.
p381
aVBut my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line.
p382
aVIt only works about 12 months.
p383
aa(lp384
VIt's the first version of the time machine.
p385
aVFirst time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later
p386
aVbut 12 months so far.
p387
aVAnd, you know, I look at this,
p388
aVand I get really emotional.
p389
aVYou look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls,
p390
aVyou can look at them, you can ask them.
p391
aVAnd I found a woman that had \u2014
p392
aVwe found her, she was odd because she had data
p393
aVafter she died.
p394
aVAnd her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores,
p395
aVbecause he knew how much she cared.
p396
aVAnd I am thankful.
p397
aa(lp398
VI can't believe that these people,
p399
aVyears after my brother had died,
p400
aVhelped me answer the question about whether
p401
aVan operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on
p402
aVyears ago, worked or not.
p403
aVI wished it had been there
p404
aVwhen I'd done it the first time,
p405
aVand I'm really excited that it's here now,
p406
aVbecause the lab that I founded
p407
aVhas some data on a drug that might work,
p408
aVand I'd like to show it.
p409
aVI'd like to show it in real time, now,
p410
aVand I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.
p411
aVI've got to thank the 45,000 people
p412
aVthat are doing this social experiment with us.
p413
aVThere is an amazing journey we are going on
p414
aVto become human again,
p415
aVto be part of community again,
p416
aVto share of ourselves, to be vulnerable,
p417
aVand it's very exciting. So, thank you.
p418

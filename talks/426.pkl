VI'll just start talking about the 17th century.
p5
aVI hope nobody finds that offensive.
p6
aVI \u2014 you know, when I \u2014 after I had invented PCR,
p7
aVI kind of needed a change.
p8
aVAnd I moved down to La Jolla and learned how to surf.
p9
aVAnd I started living down there on the beach for a long time.
p10
aVAnd when surfers are out waiting
p11
aVfor waves,
p12
aVyou probably wonder, if you've never been out there, what are they doing?
p13
aVYou know, sometimes there's a 10-, 15-minute break out there
p14
aVwhen you're waiting for a wave to come in.
p15
aVThey usually talk about the 17th century.
p16
aVYou know, they get a real bad rap in the world.
p17
aVPeople think they're sort of lowbrows.
p18
aVOne day, somebody suggested I read this book.
p19
aVIt was called \u2014
p20
aVit was called "The Air Pump,"
p21
aVor something like "The Leviathan and The Air Pump."
p22
aVIt was a real weird book about the 17th century.
p23
aVAnd I realized, the roots
p24
aVof the way I sort of thought
p25
aVwas just the only natural way to think about things.
p26
aVThat \u2014 you know, I was born thinking about things that way,
p27
aVand I had always been like a little scientist guy.
p28
aVAnd when I went to find out something,
p29
aVI used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised,
p30
aVyou know, when they first told me how \u2014
p31
aVhow you were supposed to do science,
p32
aVbecause I'd already been doing it for fun and whatever.
p33
aVBut it didn't \u2014 it never occurred to me
p34
aVthat it had to be invented
p35
aVand that it had been invented
p36
aVonly 350 years ago.
p37
aVYou know, it was \u2014
p38
aVlike it happened in England, and Germany, and Italy
p39
aVsort of all at the same time.
p40
aVAnd the story of that,
p41
aVI thought, was really fascinating.
p42
aVSo I'm going to talk a little bit about that,
p43
aVand what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do.
p44
aVAnd it's, it's a kind of \u2014
p45
aVYou know, Charles I got beheaded
p46
aVsomewhere early in the 17th century.
p47
aVAnd the English set up Cromwell
p48
aVand a whole bunch of Republicans or whatever,
p49
aVand not the kind of Republicans we had.
p50
aVThey changed the government, and it didn't work.
p51
aVAnd
p52
aVCharles II, the son,
p53
aVwas finally put back on the throne of England.
p54
aVHe was really nervous, because his dad had been,
p55
aVyou know, beheaded for being the King of England
p56
aVAnd he was nervous about the fact
p57
aVthat conversations that got going
p58
aVin, like, bars and stuff
p59
aVwould turn to \u2014
p60
aVthis is kind of \u2014 it's hard to believe,
p61
aVbut people in the 17th century in England
p62
aVwere starting to talk about, you know,
p63
aVphilosophy and stuff in bars.
p64
aVThey didn't have TV screens,
p65
aVand they didn't have any football games to watch.
p66
aVAnd they would get really pissy,
p67
aVand all of a sudden people would spill out into the street and fight
p68
aVabout issues like whether or not
p69
aVit was okay if Robert Boyle
p70
aVmade a device called the vacuum pump.
p71
aVNow, Boyle was a friend of Charles II.
p72
aVHe was a Christian guy during the weekends,
p73
aVbut during the week he was a scientist.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVWhich was \u2014 back then it was
p76
aVsort of, you know, well, you know \u2014
p77
aVif you made this thing \u2014 he made this little device,
p78
aVlike kind of like a bicycle pump
p79
aVin reverse that could suck all the air out of \u2014
p80
aVyou know what a bell jar is? One of these things,
p81
aVyou pick it up, put it down, and it's got a seal,
p82
aVand you can see inside of it,
p83
aVso you can see what's going on inside this thing.
p84
aVBut what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there,
p85
aVand see what would happen inside there.
p86
aVI mean, the first \u2014 I think one of the first experiments he did
p87
aVwas he put a bird in there.
p88
aVAnd people in the 17th century,
p89
aVthey didn't really understand the same way we do
p90
aVabout you know, this stuff is
p91
aVa bunch of different kinds of molecules,
p92
aVand we breathe it in for a purpose and all that.
p93
aVI mean, fish don't know much about water,
p94
aVand people didn't know much about air.
p95
aVBut both started exploring it.
p96
aVOne thing, he put a bird in there, and he pumped all the air out,
p97
aVand the bird died. So he said, hmm...
p98
aVHe said \u2014 he called what he'd done as making \u2014
p99
aVthey didn't call it a vacuum pump at the time.
p100
aVNow you call it a vacuum pump; he called it a vacuum.
p101
aVRight? And immediately,
p102
aVhe got into trouble with the local clergy
p103
aVwho said, you can't make a vacuum.
p104
aVAh, uh \u2014
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVAristotle said that nature abhors one.
p107
aVI think it was a poor translation, probably,
p108
aVbut people relied on authorities like that.
p109
aVAnd you know, Boyle says, well, shit.
p110
aVI make them all the time.
p111
aVI mean, whatever that is that kills the bird \u2014
p112
aVand I'm calling it a vacuum.
p113
aVAnd the religious people said that
p114
aVif God wanted you to make \u2014
p115
aVI mean, God is everywhere,
p116
aVthat was one of their rules, is God is everywhere.
p117
aVAnd a vacuum \u2014 there's nothing in a vacuum,
p118
aVso you've \u2014 God couldn't be in there.
p119
aVSo therefore the church said that you can't make a vacuum, you know.
p120
aVAnd Boyle said, bullshit.
p121
aVI mean, you want to call it Godless,
p122
aVyou know, you call it Godless.
p123
aVBut that's not my job. I'm not into that.
p124
aVI do that on the weekend. And like \u2014
p125
aVwhat I'm trying to do is figure out what happens
p126
aVwhen you suck everything out of a compartment.
p127
aVAnd he did all these cute little experiments.
p128
aVLike he did one with \u2014 he had a little wheel,
p129
aVlike a fan, that was
p130
aVsort of loosely attached, so it could spin by itself.
p131
aVHe had another fan opposed to it
p132
aVthat he had like a \u2014
p133
aVI mean, the way I would have done this would be, like, a rubber band,
p134
aVand, you know, around a tinker toy kind of fan.
p135
aVI know exactly how he did it; I've seen the drawings.
p136
aVIt's two fans, one which he could turn from outside
p137
aVafter he got the vacuum established,
p138
aVand he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it,
p139
aVthe one fan would no longer turn the other one, right?
p140
aVSomething was missing, you know. I mean, these are \u2014
p141
aVit's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that,
p142
aVbut that was what was going on at the time.
p143
aVAnd like, there was big arguments about it
p144
aVin the \u2014 you know, the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff.
p145
aVAnd Charles
p146
aVstarted not liking that.
p147
aVCharles II was kind of saying, you know, you should keep that \u2014
p148
aVlet's make a place where you can do this stuff
p149
aVwhere people don't get so \u2014 you know,
p150
aVwe don't want the \u2014 we don't want to get the people mad at me again. And so \u2014
p151
aVbecause when they started talking about religion
p152
aVand science and stuff like that,
p153
aVthat's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble.
p154
aVAnd so,
p155
aVCharles said, I'm going to put up the money
p156
aVgive you guys a building,
p157
aVcome here and you can meet in the building,
p158
aVbut just don't talk about religion in there.
p159
aVAnd that was fine with Boyle.
p160
aVHe said, OK, we're going to start having these meetings.
p161
aVAnd anybody who wants to do science is \u2014
p162
aVthis is about the time that Isaac Newton was starting to whip out
p163
aVa lot of really interesting things.
p164
aVAnd there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society,
p165
aVthey called it. You had to be dressed up pretty well.
p166
aVIt wasn't like a TED conference.
p167
aVThat was the only criteria, was that you be \u2014
p168
aVyou looked like a gentleman, and they'd let anybody could come.
p169
aVYou didn't have to be a member then.
p170
aVAnd so, they would come in and you would do \u2014
p171
aVAnybody that was going to show an experiment,
p172
aVwhich was kind of a new word at the time,
p173
aVdemonstrate some principle,
p174
aVthey had to do it on stage, where everybody could see it.
p175
aVSo they were \u2014
p176
aVthe really important part of this was,
p177
aVyou were not supposed to talk
p178
aVabout final causes, for instance.
p179
aVAnd God was out of the picture.
p180
aVThe actual nature of reality was not at issue.
p181
aVYou're not supposed to talk about the absolute nature of anything.
p182
aVYou were not supposed to talk about anything
p183
aVthat you couldn't demonstrate.
p184
aVSo if somebody could see it, you could say, here's how the machine works,
p185
aVhere's what we do, and then here's what happens.
p186
aVAnd seeing what happens, it was OK
p187
aVto generalize,
p188
aVand say, I'm sure that this will happen anytime
p189
aVwe make one of these things.
p190
aVAnd so you can start making up some rules.
p191
aVYou say, anytime you have a vacuum state,
p192
aVyou will discover that one wheel will not turn another one,
p193
aVif the only connection between them
p194
aVis whatever was there before the vacuum. That kind of thing.
p195
aVCandles can't burn in a vacuum,
p196
aVtherefore, probably sparklers wouldn't either.
p197
aVIt's not clear; actually sparklers will,
p198
aVbut they didn't know that.
p199
aVThey didn't have sparklers. But, they \u2014
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aV\u2014 you can make up rules, but they have to relate
p202
aVonly to the things that you've been able to demonstrate.
p203
aVAnd most the demonstrations had to do with visuals.
p204
aVLike if you do an experiment on stage,
p205
aVand nobody can see it, they can just hear it, they would probably think you were freaky.
p206
aVI mean, reality is what you can see.
p207
aVThat wasn't an explicit rule in the meeting,
p208
aVbut I'm sure that was part of it, you know. If people hear voices,
p209
aVand they can't see and associate it with somebody,
p210
aVthat person's probably not there.
p211
aVBut the general idea that you could only \u2014
p212
aVyou could only really talk about things in that place
p213
aVthat had some kind of experimental basis.
p214
aVIt didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes,
p215
aVwho was a local philosopher,
p216
aVsaid about it, you know,
p217
aVbecause you weren't going to be talking final causes.
p218
aVWhat's happening here,
p219
aVin the middle of the 17th century,
p220
aVwas that what became my field \u2014
p221
aVscience, experimental science \u2014
p222
aVwas pulling itself away,
p223
aVand it was in a physical way, because we're going to do it in this room over here,
p224
aVbut it was also what \u2014 it was an amazing thing that happened.
p225
aVScience had been all interlocked
p226
aVwith theology, and philosophy,
p227
aVand \u2014 and \u2014 and mathematics,
p228
aVwhich is really not science.
p229
aVBut experimental science had been tied up with all those things.
p230
aVAnd the mathematics part
p231
aVand the experimental science part
p232
aVwas pulling away from philosophy.
p233
aVAnd \u2014 things \u2014
p234
aVwe never looked back.
p235
aVIt's been so cool since then.
p236
aVI mean, it just \u2014 it just \u2014 untangled a thing that was really impeding
p237
aVtechnology from being developed.
p238
aVAnd, I mean, everybody in this room \u2014
p239
aVnow, this is 350 short years ago.
p240
aVRemember, that's a short time.
p241
aVIt was 300,000, probably, years ago
p242
aVthat most of us, the ancestors of most of us in this room
p243
aVcame up out of Africa and turned to the left.
p244
aVYou know, the ones that turned to the right, there are some of those
p245
aVin the Japanese translation.
p246
aVBut that happened very \u2014 a long time ago
p247
aVcompared to
p248
aV350 short years ago.
p249
aVBut in that 350 years,
p250
aVthe place has just undergone a lot of changes.
p251
aVIn fact, everybody in this room probably,
p252
aVespecially if you picked up your bag \u2014
p253
aVsome of you, I know, didn't pick up your bags \u2014
p254
aVbut if you picked up your bag, everybody in this room
p255
aVhas got in their pocket, or back in their room,
p256
aVsomething
p257
aVthat 350 years ago,
p258
aVkings would have gone to war to have.
p259
aVI mean, if you can think how important \u2014
p260
aVIf you have a GPS system and there are no satellites,
p261
aVit's not going to be much use. But, like \u2014
p262
aVbut, you know, if somebody had a GPS system
p263
aVin the 17th century
p264
aVsome king would have gotten together an army
p265
aVand gone to get it, you know. If that person \u2014
p266
aVAudience: For the teddy bear? The teddy bear?
p267
aVKary Mullis: They might have done it for the teddy bear, yeah.
p268
aVBut \u2014 all of us own stuff.
p269
aVI mean, individuals own things
p270
aVthat kings would have definitely gone to war to get.
p271
aVAnd this is just 350 years.
p272
aVNot a whole lot of people doing this stuff.
p273
aVYou know, the important people \u2014
p274
aVyou can almost read about their lives,
p275
aVabout all the really important people that made advances, you know.
p276
aVAnd, I mean \u2014
p277
aVthis kind of stuff, you know, all this stuff
p278
aVcame from that separation
p279
aVof this little sort of thing that we do \u2014
p280
aVnow I, when I was a boy
p281
aVwas born sort of with this idea
p282
aVthat if you want to know something \u2014
p283
aVyou know, maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot,
p284
aVand my mother didn't really know much science,
p285
aVbut I thought if you want to know something about stuff,
p286
aVyou do it \u2014 you make an experiment, you know.
p287
aVYou get \u2014 you get, like \u2014
p288
aVI just had a natural feeling for science
p289
aVand setting up experiments. I thought that was the way everybody had always thought.
p290
aVI thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way.
p291
aVIt isn't true. I mean, there's a lot of people \u2014
p292
aVYou know, I was one of those scientists that was \u2014
p293
aVgot into trouble the other night at dinner
p294
aVbecause of the post-modernism thing.
p295
aVAnd I didn't mean, you know \u2014 where is that lady?
p296
aVAudience: Here.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aVKM: I mean, I didn't really think of that as an argument
p299
aVso much as just a lively discussion.
p300
aVI didn't take it personally, but \u2014
p301
aVI just \u2014 I had \u2014 I naively had thought,
p302
aVuntil this surfing experience started me into the 17th century,
p303
aVI'd thought that's just the way people thought,
p304
aVand everybody did, and they recognized reality
p305
aVby what they could see or touch or feel or hear.
p306
aVAt any rate, when I was a boy,
p307
aVI, like, for instance, I had this \u2014
p308
aVI got this little book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma \u2014
p309
aVThis is about the time that George Dyson's dad
p310
aVwas starting to blow nuclear \u2014
p311
aVthinking about blowing up nuclear rockets and stuff.
p312
aVI was thinking about making my own little rockets.
p313
aVAnd I knew that frogs \u2014 little frogs \u2014
p314
aVhad aspirations of space travel,
p315
aVjust like people. And I \u2014
p316
aV(Laughter)
p317
aVI was looking for a \u2014
p318
aVa propulsion system
p319
aVthat would like, make a rocket, like,
p320
aVmaybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles.
p321
aVAnd, I mean, that was my sort of goal.
p322
aVI wanted it to go out of sight and then I wanted this little parachute
p323
aVto come back with the frog in it.
p324
aVAnd \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014
p325
aVI got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
p326
aVwhere there's a missile base.
p327
aVThey send it out for amateur rocketeers,
p328
aVand
p329
aVit said in there
p330
aVdo not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar.
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aVYou know,
p333
aVthat's what you call a lead.
p334
aV(Laughter)
p335
aVYou sort of \u2014 now you say, well, let's see if I can
p336
aVget hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar, perchlorate and sugar,
p337
aVand heat it; it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do,
p338
aVand what it is going to \u2014 and how is it going to work.
p339
aVAnd we didn't have \u2014
p340
aVlike, my mother
p341
aVpresided over the back yard
p342
aVfrom an upstairs window,
p343
aVwhere she would be ironing or something like that.
p344
aVAnd she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on,
p345
aVand if there was any puffs of smoke out there,
p346
aVshe'd lean out and admonish us all
p347
aVnot to blow our eyes out. That was her \u2014
p348
aVYou know, that was kind of the worst thing that could happen to us.
p349
aVThat's why I thought, as long as I don't blow my eyes out...
p350
aVI may not care about the fact
p351
aVthat it's prohibited from heating this solution.
p352
aVI'm going to do it carefully, but I'll do it.
p353
aVIt's like anything else that's prohibited:
p354
aVyou do it behind the garage.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aVSo, I went to the drug store
p357
aVand I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate
p358
aVand it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid
p359
aVto walk into a drug store and buy chemicals.
p360
aVNowadays, it's no ma'am,
p361
aVcheck your shoes. And like \u2014
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aVBut then it wasn't \u2014 they didn't have any, but the guy had \u2014
p364
aVI said, what kind of salts of potassium do you have? You know.
p365
aVAnd he had potassium nitrate.
p366
aVAnd I said, that might do the same thing, whatever it is.
p367
aVI'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual.
p368
aVAnd so I \u2014 I did some experiments.
p369
aVYou know, I started off with little tiny amounts
p370
aVof potassium nitrate and sugar,
p371
aVwhich was readily available,
p372
aVand I mixed it in different proportions,
p373
aVand I tried to light it on fire.
p374
aVJust to see what would happen, if you mixed it together.
p375
aVAnd it \u2014 they burned.
p376
aVIt burned kind of slow, but it made a nice smell,
p377
aVcompared to other rocket fuels I had tried,
p378
aVthat all had sulfur in them.
p379
aVAnd, it smelt like burnt candy.
p380
aVAnd then I tried the melting business, and I melted it.
p381
aVAnd then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid, brown.
p382
aVAnd then it cooled down to a brick-hard substance,
p383
aVthat when you lit that,
p384
aVit went off like a bat.
p385
aVI mean, the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down \u2014
p386
aVyou'd light it, and it would just start dancing around the yard.
p387
aVAnd I said, there
p388
aVis a way to get a frog up to where he wants to go.
p389
aV(Laughter)
p390
aVSo I started developing \u2014
p391
aVyou know, George's dad had a lot of help. I just had my brother.
p392
aVBut I \u2014 it took me about \u2014 it took me about,
p393
aVI'd say, six months
p394
aVto finally figure out all the little things.
p395
aVThere's a lot of little things involved
p396
aVin making a rocket that it will actually work,
p397
aVeven after you have the fuel.
p398
aVBut you do it, by \u2014 what I just\u2014
p399
aVyou know, you do experiments,
p400
aVand you write down things sometimes,
p401
aVyou make observations, you know.
p402
aVAnd then you slowly build up a theory
p403
aVof how this stuff works.
p404
aVAnd it was \u2014 I was following all the rules.
p405
aVI didn't know what the rules were,
p406
aVI'm a natural born scientist, I guess,
p407
aVor some kind of a throwback to the 17th century, whatever.
p408
aVBut at any rate, we finally did
p409
aVhave a device that would reproduceably
p410
aVput a frog out of sight
p411
aVand get him back alive.
p412
aVAnd we had not \u2014
p413
aVI mean, we weren't frightened by it.
p414
aVWe should have been, because it made a lot of smoke
p415
aVand it made a lot of noise,
p416
aVand it was powerful, you know.
p417
aVAnd once in a while, they would blow up.
p418
aVBut I wasn't worried, by the way,
p419
aVabout, you know,
p420
aVthe explosion causing the destruction of the planet.
p421
aVI hadn't heard about the 10 ways
p422
aVthat we should be afraid of the \u2014
p423
aVBy the way,
p424
aVI could have thought,
p425
aVI'd better not do this because
p426
aVthey say not to, you know.
p427
aVAnd I'd better get permission from the government.
p428
aVIf I'd have waited around for that,
p429
aVI would have never \u2014 the frog would have died, you know.
p430
aVAt any rate, I bring it up because it's a good story,
p431
aVand he said, tell personal things, you know, and that's a personal \u2014
p432
aVI was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife,
p433
aVbut that would be too personal, wouldn't it.
p434
aVSo, so I've got something else that's not personal.
p435
aVBut that... process is what I think of as science,
p436
aVsee, where you start with some idea,
p437
aVand then instead of, like, looking up,
p438
aVevery authority that you've ever heard of
p439
aVI \u2014 sometimes you do that,
p440
aVif you're going to write a paper later,
p441
aVyou want to figure out who else has worked on it.
p442
aVBut in the actual process, you get an idea \u2014
p443
aVlike, when I got the idea one night
p444
aVthat I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides,
p445
aVand I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA,
p446
aVyou know, the thinking for that
p447
aVwas about 20 minutes while I was driving my car,
p448
aVand then instead of going \u2014 I went back and I did talk to people about it,
p449
aVbut if I'd listened to what I heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists \u2014
p450
aVI would have abandoned it.
p451
aVYou know, if I had gone back looking for an authority figure
p452
aVwho could tell me if it would work or not,
p453
aVhe would have said, no, it probably won't.
p454
aVBecause the results of it were so spectacular
p455
aVthat if it worked it was going to change everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology.
p456
aVNobody wants a chemist to come in
p457
aVand poke around in their stuff like that and change things.
p458
aVBut if you go to authority, and you always don't \u2014
p459
aVyou don't always get the right answer, see.
p460
aVBut I knew, you'd go into the lab
p461
aVand you'd try to make it work yourself. And then you're the authority,
p462
aVand you can say, I know it works,
p463
aVbecause right there in that tube
p464
aVis where it happened,
p465
aVand here, on this gel, there's a little band there
p466
aVthat I know that's DNA, and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify,
p467
aVso there! So it does work.
p468
aVYou know, that's how you do science.
p469
aVAnd then you say, well, what can make it work better?
p470
aVAnd then you figure out better and better ways to do it.
p471
aVBut you always work from, from like, facts
p472
aVthat you have made available to you
p473
aVby doing experiments: things that you could do on a stage.
p474
aVAnd no tricky shit behind the thing. I mean, it's all \u2014
p475
aVyou've got to be very honest
p476
aVwith what you're doing if it really is going to work.
p477
aVI mean, you can't make up results,
p478
aVand then do another experiment based on that one.
p479
aVSo you have to be honest.
p480
aVAnd I'm basically honest.
p481
aVI have a fairly bad memory, and dishonesty would always get me in trouble,
p482
aVif I, like \u2014 so I've just sort of been naturally honest
p483
aVand naturally inquisitive,
p484
aVand that sort of leads to that kind of science.
p485
aVNow, let's see...
p486
aVI've got another five minutes, right?
p487
aVOK. All scientists aren't like that.
p488
aVYou know \u2014 and there is a lot \u2014
p489
aV(Laughter)
p490
aVThere is a lot \u2014 a lot has been going on since
p491
aVIsaac Newton and all that stuff happened.
p492
aVOne of the things that happened right around World War II
p493
aVin that same time period before,
p494
aVand as sure as hell afterwards,
p495
aVgovernment got \u2014 realized that scientists aren't strange dudes
p496
aVthat, you know, hide in ivory towers
p497
aVand do ridiculous things with test tube.
p498
aVScientists, you know, made World War II
p499
aVas we know it quite possible.
p500
aVThey made faster things.
p501
aVThey made bigger guns to shoot them down with.
p502
aVYou know, they made drugs to give the pilots
p503
aVif they were broken up in the process.
p504
aVThey made all kinds of \u2014 and then finally one giant bomb
p505
aVto end the whole thing, right?
p506
aVAnd everybody stepped back a little and said, you know,
p507
aVwe ought to invest in this shit,
p508
aVbecause whoever has got the most of these people
p509
aVworking in the places is going to have a dominant position,
p510
aVat least in the military, and probably in all kind of economic ways.
p511
aVAnd they got involved in it, and the scientific
p512
aVand industrial establishment was born,
p513
aVand out of that came a lot of scientists
p514
aVwho were in there for the money, you know,
p515
aVbecause it was suddenly available.
p516
aVAnd they weren't the curious little boys
p517
aVthat liked to put frogs up in the air.
p518
aVThey were the same people that later went in to medical school, you know,
p519
aVbecause there was money in it, you know. I mean, later, then they all got into business \u2014
p520
aVI mean, there are waves of \u2014 going into your high school,
p521
aVperson saying, you want to be rich, you know, be a scientist. You know, not anymore.
p522
aVYou want to be rich, you be a businessman.
p523
aVBut a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel.
p524
aVThat's back when travel was easy.
p525
aVAnd those people don't think \u2014
p526
aVthey don't \u2014
p527
aVthey don't always tell you the truth, you know.
p528
aVThere is nothing in their contract, in fact,
p529
aVthat makes it to their advantage always,
p530
aVto tell you the truth.
p531
aVAnd the people I'm talking about are people that like \u2014
p532
aVthey say that they're a member of the committee
p533
aVcalled, say, the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change.
p534
aVAnd they \u2014 and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out
p535
aVhow we're going to \u2014 how we're going to continually prove
p536
aVthat the planet is getting warmer,
p537
aVwhen that's actually contrary to most people's sensations.
p538
aVI mean, if you actually measure
p539
aVthe temperature over a period \u2014
p540
aVI mean, the temperature has been measured now
p541
aVpretty carefully for about 50, 60 years \u2014
p542
aVlonger than that it's been measured,
p543
aVbut in really nice, precise ways,
p544
aVand records have been kept for 50 or 60 years,
p545
aVand in fact, the temperature hadn't really gone up.
p546
aVIt's like, the average temperature
p547
aVhas gone up a tiny little bit,
p548
aVbecause the nighttime temperatures
p549
aVat the weather stations have come up just a little bit.
p550
aVBut there's a good explanation for that.
p551
aVAnd it's that the weather stations are all built outside of town,
p552
aVwhere the airport was, and now
p553
aVthe town's moved out there, there's concrete all around
p554
aVand they call it the skyline effect.
p555
aVAnd most responsible people
p556
aVthat measure temperatures realize
p557
aVyou have to shield your measuring device from that.
p558
aVAnd even then, you know,
p559
aVbecause the buildings get warm in the daytime,
p560
aVand they keep it a little warmer at night.
p561
aVSo the temperature has been, sort of, inching up.
p562
aVIt should have been. But not a lot. Not like, you know \u2014
p563
aVthe first guy \u2014 the first guy that got the idea
p564
aVthat we're going to fry ourselves here,
p565
aVactually, he didn't think of it that way.
p566
aVHis name was Sven Arrhenius. He was Swedish, and he said,
p567
aVif you double the CO2 level in the atmosphere,
p568
aVwhich he thought might \u2014 this is in 1900 \u2014
p569
aVthe temperature ought to go up about 5.5 degrees, he calculated.
p570
aVHe was thinking of the earth as, kind of like,
p571
aVyou know, like a completely insulated thing
p572
aVwith no stuff in it, really,
p573
aVjust energy coming down, energy leaving.
p574
aVAnd so he came up with this theory,
p575
aVand he said, this will be cool,
p576
aVbecause it'll be a longer growing season in Sweden,
p577
aVyou know, and the surfers liked it,
p578
aVthe surfers thought, that's a cool idea,
p579
aVbecause it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes, and \u2014
p580
aVbut a lot of other people later on
p581
aVstarted thinking it would be bad, you know.
p582
aVBut nobody actually demonstrated it, right?
p583
aVI mean, the temperature as measured \u2014
p584
aVand you can find this on our wonderful Internet,
p585
aVyou just go and look for all NASAs records,
p586
aVand all the Weather Bureau's records,
p587
aVand you'll look at it yourself, and you'll see, the temperature has just \u2014
p588
aVthe nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet
p589
aVhas gone up a tiny little bit.
p590
aVSo if you just average that and the daytime temperature, it looks like it went up
p591
aVabout .7 degrees in this century.
p592
aVBut in fact, it was just coming up \u2014
p593
aVit was the nighttime; the daytime temperatures didn't go up.
p594
aVSo \u2014 and Arrhenius' theory \u2014
p595
aVand all the global warmers think \u2014
p596
aVthey would say, yeah, it should go up in the daytime, too,
p597
aVif it's the greenhouse effect.
p598
aVNow, people like things that have, like, names like that,
p599
aVthat they can envision it, right? I mean \u2014
p600
aVbut people don't like things like this, so \u2014 most \u2014 I mean,
p601
aVyou don't get all excited about things
p602
aVlike the actual evidence, you know,
p603
aVwhich would be evidence for strengthening
p604
aVof the tropical circulation in the 1990s.
p605
aVIt's a paper that came out in February,
p606
aVand most of you probably hadn't heard about it.
p607
aV"Evidence for Large Decadal Variability
p608
aVin the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget."
p609
aVExcuse me. Those papers were published by NASA,
p610
aVand some scientists at Columbia, and Viliki
p611
aVand a whole bunch of people, Princeton.
p612
aVAnd those two papers came out in Science Magazine,
p613
aVFebruary the first,
p614
aVand these \u2014 the conclusion in both of these papers,
p615
aVand in also the Science editor's, like,
p616
aVdescriptions of these papers, for, you know,
p617
aVfor the quickie,
p618
aVis that our theories about global warming
p619
aVare completely wrong. I mean,
p620
aVwhat these guys were doing,
p621
aVand this is what \u2014 the NASA people have been saying this for a long time.
p622
aVThey say, if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere, it isn't going up \u2014
p623
aVit's not going up at all. We've doing it very carefully now for 20 years,
p624
aVfrom satellites, and it isn't going up.
p625
aVAnd in this paper, they show something much more striking,
p626
aVand that was that they did what they call a radiation \u2014
p627
aVand I'm not going to go into the details of it, actually it's quite complicated,
p628
aVbut it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is
p629
aVby the words they use in those papers. If you really get down to it, they say,
p630
aVthe sun puts out a certain amount of energy \u2014
p631
aVwe know how much that is \u2014
p632
aVit falls on the earth, the earth gives back a certain amount.
p633
aVWhen it gets warm it generates \u2014
p634
aVit makes redder energy \u2014 I mean, like infra-red,
p635
aVlike something that's warm gives off infra-red.
p636
aVThe whole business of the global warming \u2014
p637
aVtrash, really,
p638
aVis that \u2014 if the \u2014 if there's too much CO2 in the atmosphere,
p639
aVthe heat that's trying to escape
p640
aVwon't be able to get out. But the heat coming from the sun,
p641
aVwhich is mostly down in the \u2014 it's like 350 nanometers,
p642
aVwhich is where it's centered \u2014 that goes right through CO2.
p643
aVSo you still get heated, but you don't dissipate any.
p644
aVWell, these guys measured all of those things.
p645
aVI mean, you can talk about that stuff,
p646
aVand you can write these large reports, and you can get government money to do it,
p647
aVbut these \u2014 they actually measured it,
p648
aVand it turns out that in the last 10 years \u2014
p649
aVthat's why they say "decadal" there \u2014
p650
aVthat the energy \u2014 that the level
p651
aVof what they call "imbalance"
p652
aVhas been way the hell over what was expected.
p653
aVLike, the amount of imbalance \u2014
p654
aVmeaning, heat's coming in and it's not going out
p655
aVthat you would get from having double the CO2,
p656
aVwhich we're not anywhere near that, by the way.
p657
aVBut if we did, in 2025 or something,
p658
aVhave double the CO2 as we had in 1900,
p659
aVthey say it would be increase the energy budget
p660
aVby about \u2014 in other words,
p661
aVone watt per square centimeter more
p662
aVwould be coming in than going out.
p663
aVSo the planet should get warmer.
p664
aVWell, they found out in this study \u2014 these two studies
p665
aVby two different teams \u2014
p666
aVthat five and a half watts
p667
aVper square meter
p668
aVhad been coming in from 1998, 1999,
p669
aVand the place didn't get warmer.
p670
aVSo the theory's kaput \u2014 it's nothing.
p671
aVThese papers should have been called,
p672
aV"The End to the Global Warming Fiasco," you know.
p673
aVThey're concerned,
p674
aVand you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers,
p675
aVbecause they're talking about big laboratories
p676
aVthat are funded by lots of money
p677
aVand by scared people.
p678
aVYou know, if they said, you know what?
p679
aVThere isn't a problem with global warming any longer,
p680
aVso we can \u2014 you know, they're funding.
p681
aVAnd if you start a grant request with something like that,
p682
aVand say, global warming obviously hadn't happened...
p683
aVif they \u2014 if they \u2014 if they actually \u2014 if they actually said that,
p684
aVI'm getting out.
p685
aV(Laughter)
p686
aVI'll stand up too, and \u2014
p687
aV(Laughter)
p688
aV(Applause)
p689
aVThey have to say that.
p690
aVThey had to be very cautious.
p691
aVBut what I'm saying is, you can be delighted,
p692
aVbecause the editor of Science, who is no dummy,
p693
aVand both of these fairly professional \u2014
p694
aVreally professional teams, have really come to the same conclusion
p695
aVand in the bottom lines in their papers
p696
aVthey have to say, what this means is, that what we've been thinking,
p697
aVwas the global circulation model that we predict
p698
aVthat the earth is going to get overheated
p699
aVthat it's all wrong. It's wrong by a large factor.
p700
aVIt's not by a small one. They just \u2014
p701
aVthey just misinterpreted the fact that the earth \u2014
p702
aVthere's obviously some mechanisms going on
p703
aVthat nobody knew about,
p704
aVbecause the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer.
p705
aVSo the planet is a pretty amazing thing, you know,
p706
aVit's big and horrible \u2014 and big and wonderful,
p707
aVand it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about.
p708
aVSo I mean, the reason I put those things all together,
p709
aVOK, here's the way you're supposed to do science \u2014
p710
aVsome science is done for other reasons, and just curiosity.
p711
aVAnd there's a lot of things like global warming,
p712
aVand ozone hole and you know,
p713
aVa whole bunch of scientific public issues,
p714
aVthat if you're interested in them,
p715
aVthen you have to get down the details, and read the papers called,
p716
aV"Large Decadal Variability in the..."
p717
aVYou have to figure out what all those words mean.
p718
aVAnd if you just listen to the guys
p719
aVwho are hyping those issues, and making a lot of money out of it,
p720
aVyou'll be misinformed, and you'll be worrying about the wrong things.
p721
aVRemember the 10 things that are going to get you. The \u2014 one of them \u2014
p722
aV(Laughter)
p723
aVAnd the asteroids is the one I really agree with there.
p724
aVI mean, you've got to watch out for asteroids. OK, thank you for having me here.

VApproximately 30 years ago,
p5
aVwhen I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital
p6
aVin Philadelphia,
p7
aVa father and a son walked into my office
p8
aVand they both had their right eye missing,
p9
aVand as I took the history, it became apparent
p10
aVthat the father and the son had a rare form
p11
aVof inherited eye tumor, retinoblastoma,
p12
aVand the father knew that he had passed that fate
p13
aVon to his son.
p14
aa(lp15
VThat moment changed my life.
p16
aVIt propelled me to go on
p17
aVand to co-lead a team that discovered
p18
aVthe first cancer susceptibility gene,
p19
aVand in the intervening decades since then,
p20
aVthere has been literally a seismic shift
p21
aVin our understanding of what goes on,
p22
aVwhat genetic variations are sitting behind
p23
aVvarious diseases.
p24
aVIn fact, for thousands of human traits,
p25
aVa molecular basis that's known for that,
p26
aVand for thousands of people, every day,
p27
aVthere's information that they gain
p28
aVabout the risk of going on to get this disease
p29
aVor that disease.
p30
aa(lp31
VAt the same time, if you ask,
p32
aV"Has that impacted the efficiency,
p33
aVhow we've been able to develop drugs?"
p34
aVthe answer is not really.
p35
aVIf you look at the cost of developing drugs,
p36
aVhow that's done, it basically hasn't budged that.
p37
aVAnd so it's as if we have the power to diagnose
p38
aVyet not the power to fully treat.
p39
aVAnd there are two commonly given reasons
p40
aVfor why that happens.
p41
aVOne of them is it's early days.
p42
aVWe're just learning the words, the fragments,
p43
aVthe letters in the genetic code.
p44
aVWe don't know how to read the sentences.
p45
aVWe don't know how to follow the narrative.
p46
aVThe other reason given is that
p47
aVmost of those changes are a loss of function,
p48
aVand it's actually really hard to develop drugs
p49
aVthat restore function.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut today, I want us to step back
p52
aVand ask a more fundamental question,
p53
aVand ask, "What happens if we're thinking
p54
aVabout this maybe in the wrong context?"
p55
aVWe do a lot of studying of those who are sick
p56
aVand building up long lists
p57
aVof altered components.
p58
aVBut maybe, if what we're trying to do
p59
aVis to develop therapies for prevention,
p60
aVmaybe what we should be doing
p61
aVis studying those who don't get sick.
p62
aVMaybe we should be studying those
p63
aVthat are well.
p64
aVA vast majority of those people
p65
aVare not necessarily carrying a particular
p66
aVgenetic load or risk factor.
p67
aVThey're not going to help us.
p68
aVThere are going to be those individuals
p69
aVwho are carrying a potential future risk,
p70
aVthey're going to go on to get some symptom.
p71
aVThat's not what we're looking for.
p72
aVWhat we're asking and looking for is,
p73
aVare there a very few set of individuals
p74
aVwho are actually walking around
p75
aVwith the risk that normally would cause a disease,
p76
aVbut something in them, something hidden in them
p77
aVis actually protective
p78
aVand keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms?
p79
aa(lp80
VIf you're going to do a study like that, you can imagine
p81
aVyou'd like to look at lots and lots of people.
p82
aVWe'd have to go and have a pretty wide study,
p83
aVand we realized that actually
p84
aVone way to think of this is,
p85
aVlet us look at adults who are over 40 years of age,
p86
aVand let's make sure that we look at those
p87
aVwho were healthy as kids.
p88
aVThey might have had individuals in their families
p89
aVwho had had a childhood disease,
p90
aVbut not necessarily.
p91
aVAnd let's go and then screen those
p92
aVto find those who are carrying genes
p93
aVfor childhood diseases.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, some of you, I can see you
p96
aVputting your hands up going, "Uh, a little odd.
p97
aVWhat's your evidence
p98
aVthat this could be feasible?"
p99
aVI want to give you two examples.
p100
aa(lp101
VThe first comes from San Francisco.
p102
aVIt comes from the 1980s and the 1990s,
p103
aVand you may know the story where
p104
aVthere were individuals who had very high levels
p105
aVof the virus HIV.
p106
aVThey went on to get AIDS.
p107
aVBut there was a very small set of individuals
p108
aVwho also had very high levels of HIV.
p109
aVThey didn't get AIDS.
p110
aVAnd astute clinicians tracked that down,
p111
aVand what they found was they were carrying mutations.
p112
aVNotice, they were carrying mutations from birth
p113
aVthat were protective, that were protecting them
p114
aVfrom going on to get AIDS.
p115
aVYou may also know that actually a line of therapy
p116
aVhas been coming along based on that fact.
p117
aVSecond example, more recent, is elegant work
p118
aVdone by Helen Hobbs,
p119
aVwho said, "I'm going to look at individuals
p120
aVwho have very high lipid levels,
p121
aVand I'm going to try to find those people
p122
aVwith high lipid levels
p123
aVwho don't go on to get heart disease."
p124
aVAnd again, what she found was
p125
aVsome of those individuals had mutations
p126
aVthat were protective from birth that kept them,
p127
aVeven though they had high lipid levels,
p128
aVand you can see this is an interesting way
p129
aVof thinking about how you could develop
p130
aVpreventive therapies.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe project that we're working on
p133
aVis called "The Resilience Project:
p134
aVA Search for Unexpected Heroes,"
p135
aVbecause what we are interested in doing is saying,
p136
aVcan we find those rare individuals
p137
aVwho might have these hidden protective factors?
p138
aVAnd in some ways, think of it as a decoder ring,
p139
aVa sort of resilience decoder ring
p140
aVthat we're going to try to build.
p141
aVWe've realized that we should  do this in a systematic way,
p142
aVso we've said, let's take every single
p143
aVchildhood inherited disease.
p144
aVLet's take them all, and let's pull them back a little bit
p145
aVby those that are known to have severe symptoms,
p146
aVwhere the parents, the child,
p147
aVthose around them would know
p148
aVthat they'd gotten sick,
p149
aVand let's go ahead and then frame them again
p150
aVby those parts of the genes where we know
p151
aVthat there is a particular alteration
p152
aVthat is known to be highly penetrant
p153
aVto cause that disease.
p154
aa(lp155
VWhere are we going to look?
p156
aVWell, we could look locally. That makes sense.
p157
aVBut we began to think, maybe we should look
p158
aVall over the world.
p159
aVMaybe we should look not just here
p160
aVbut in remote places where their might be
p161
aVa distinct genetic context,
p162
aVthere might be environmental factors
p163
aVthat protect people.
p164
aVAnd let's look at a million individuals.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow the reason why we think it's a good time
p167
aVto do that now
p168
aVis, in the last couple of years,
p169
aVthere's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost
p170
aVto do this type of analysis,
p171
aVthis type of data generation,
p172
aVto where it actually costs less to do
p173
aVthe data generation and analysis
p174
aVthan it does to do the sample processing and the collection.
p175
aVThe other reason is that in the last five years,
p176
aVthere have been awesome tools,
p177
aVthings about network biology, systems biology,
p178
aVthat have come up that allow us to think
p179
aVthat maybe we could decipher
p180
aVthose positive outliers.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd as we went around talking to researchers
p183
aVand institutions
p184
aVand telling them about our story,
p185
aVsomething happened.
p186
aVThey started saying, "This is interesting.
p187
aVI would be glad to join your effort.
p188
aVI would be willing to participate."
p189
aVAnd they didn't say, "Where's the MTA?"
p190
aVThey didn't say, "Where is my authorship?"
p191
aVThey didn't say, "Is this data going  to be mine? Am I going to own it?"
p192
aVThey basically said, "Let's work on this
p193
aVin an open, crowd-sourced, team way
p194
aVto do this decoding."
p195
aa(lp196
VSix months ago, we locked down
p197
aVthe screening key for this decoder.
p198
aVMy co-lead, a brilliant scientist, Eric Schadt
p199
aVat the Icahn Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York,
p200
aVand his team,
p201
aVlocked in that decoder key ring,
p202
aVand we began looking for samples,
p203
aVbecause what we realized is,
p204
aVmaybe we could just go and look
p205
aVat some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility.
p206
aVMaybe we could take two, three  percent of the project on,
p207
aVand see if it was there.
p208
aVAnd so we started asking people
p209
aVsuch as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.
p210
aVWe asked Leif up in Finland.
p211
aVWe talked to Anne Wojcicki at 23andMe,
p212
aVand Wang Jun at BGI,
p213
aVand again, something remarkable happened.
p214
aVThey said, "Huh,
p215
aVnot only do we have samples,
p216
aVbut often we've analyzed them,
p217
aVand we would be glad to go into
p218
aVour anonymized samples
p219
aVand see if we could find those
p220
aVthat you're looking for."
p221
aVAnd instead of being 20,000 or 30,000,
p222
aVlast month we passed one half million samples
p223
aVthat we've already analyzed.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo you must be going,
p226
aV"Huh, did you find any unexpected heroes?"
p227
aVAnd the answer is, we didn't find one or two.
p228
aVWe found dozens of these strong candidate
p229
aVunexpected heroes.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo we think that the time is now
p232
aVto launch the beta phase of this project
p233
aVand actually start getting prospective individuals.
p234
aVBasically all we need is information.
p235
aVWe need a swab of DNA
p236
aVand a willingness to say, "What's inside me?
p237
aVI'm willing to be re-contacted."
p238
aa(lp239
VMost of us spend our lives,
p240
aVwhen it comes to health and disease,
p241
aVacting as if we're voyeurs.
p242
aVWe delegate the responsibility
p243
aVfor the understanding of our disease,
p244
aVfor the treatment of our disease,
p245
aVto anointed experts.
p246
aVIn order for us to get this project to work,
p247
aVwe need individuals to step up
p248
aVin a different role and to be engaged,
p249
aVto realize this dream,
p250
aVthis open crowd-sourced project,
p251
aVto find those unexpected heroes,
p252
aVto evolve from the current concepts
p253
aVof resources and constraints,
p254
aVto design those preventive therapies,
p255
aVand to extend it beyond childhood diseases,
p256
aVto go all the way up to ways
p257
aVthat we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,
p258
aVwe're going to need us
p259
aVto be looking inside ourselves and asking,
p260
aV"What are our roles?
p261
aVWhat are our genes?"
p262
aVand looking within ourselves for information
p263
aVwe used to say we should go to the outside,
p264
aVto experts,
p265
aVand to be willing to share that with others.
p266
aa(lp267
VThank you very much.

VI'm not at all a cook.
p5
aVSo don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration.
p6
aVBut I do want to talk to you about something
p7
aVthat I think is dear to all of us.
p8
aVAnd that is bread \u2014 something which is as simple
p9
aVas our basic, most fundamental human staple.
p10
aVAnd I think few of us spend the day
p11
aVwithout eating bread in some form.
p12
aVUnless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets,
p13
aVbread is standard.
p14
aVBread is not only standard in the Western diet.
p15
aVAs I will show to you, it is actually
p16
aVthe mainstay of modern life.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo I'm going to bake bread for you.
p19
aVIn the meantime I'm also talking to you,
p20
aVso my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me.
p21
aVFirst of all, a little bit of audience participation.
p22
aVI have two loaves of bread here.
p23
aVOne is a supermarket standard:
p24
aVwhite bread, pre-packaged,
p25
aVwhich I'm told is called a Wonderbread.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVI didn't know this word until I arrived.
p28
aVAnd this is more or less,
p29
aVa whole-meal, handmade,
p30
aVsmall-bakery loaf of bread.
p31
aVHere we go. I want to see a show of hands.
p32
aVWho prefers the whole-meal bread?
p33
aVOkay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all?
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVI have two tentative male hands.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VOkay, now the question is really,
p39
aVwhy is this so?
p40
aVAnd I think it is because
p41
aVwe feel that this kind of bread
p42
aVreally is about authenticity.
p43
aVIt's about a traditional way of living.
p44
aVA way that is perhaps more real, more honest.
p45
aVThis is an image from Tuscany, where we feel
p46
aVagriculture is still about beauty.
p47
aVAnd life is really, too.
p48
aVAnd this is about good taste, good traditions.
p49
aVWhy do we have this image?
p50
aVWhy do we feel that this is more true than this?
p51
aVWell I think it has a lot to do with our history.
p52
aVIn the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved,
p53
aVmost of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists
p54
aVor they were closely related to food production.
p55
aVAnd we have this mythical image
p56
aVof how life was in rural areas in the past.
p57
aVArt has helped us to maintain that kind of image.
p58
aVIt was a mythical past.
p59
aVOf course, the reality is quite different.
p60
aVThese poor farmers
p61
aVworking the land by hand or with their animals,
p62
aVhad yield levels that are comparable
p63
aVto the poorest farmers today in West Africa.
p64
aVBut we have, somehow,
p65
aVin the course of the last few centuries, or even decades,
p66
aVstarted to cultivate an image of
p67
aVa mythical, rural agricultural past.
p68
aa(lp69
VIt was only 200 years ago
p70
aVthat we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.
p71
aVAnd while I'm starting to make some bread for you here,
p72
aVit's very important to understand
p73
aVwhat that revolution did to us.
p74
aVIt brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.
p75
aVAnd it actually drove up our yields.
p76
aVAnd even sort of horrible things, like picking beans by hand,
p77
aVcan now be done automatically.
p78
aVAll that is a real, great improvement, as we shall see.
p79
aVOf course we also, particularly in the last decade,
p80
aVmanaged to envelop the world
p81
aVin a dense chain of supermarkets,
p82
aVin a chain of global trade.
p83
aVAnd it means that you now eat products,
p84
aVwhich can come from all around the world.
p85
aVThat is the reality of our modern life.
p86
aVNow you may prefer this loaf of bread.
p87
aVExcuse my hands but this is how it is.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut actually the real relevant bread,
p90
aVhistorically, is this white Wonder loaf.
p91
aVAnd don't despise the white bread
p92
aVbecause it really, I think,
p93
aVsymbolizes the fact that bread and food
p94
aVhave become plentiful and affordable to all.
p95
aVAnd that is a feat that we
p96
aVare not really conscious of that much.
p97
aVBut it has changed the world.
p98
aVThis tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways
p99
aVand has a lot of problems
p100
aVhas changed the world.
p101
aVSo what is happening?
p102
aVWell the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics.
p103
aVWith the advent of the Industrial Revolution
p104
aVwith modernization of agriculture
p105
aVin the last few decades, since the 1960s,
p106
aVfood availability, per head, in this world,
p107
aVhas increased by 25 percent.
p108
aVAnd the world population in the meantime has doubled.
p109
aVThat means that we have now more food available
p110
aVthan ever before in human history.
p111
aVAnd that is the result, directly,
p112
aVof being so successful
p113
aVat increasing the scale and volume of our production.
p114
aVAnd this is true, as you can see, for all countries,
p115
aVincluding the so-called developing countries.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhat happened to our bread in the meantime?
p118
aVAs food became plentiful here,
p119
aVit also meant that we were able to decrease
p120
aVthe number of people working in agriculture
p121
aVto something like, on average, in the high income countries,
p122
aVfive percent or less of the population.
p123
aVIn the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers.
p124
aVAnd it frees us all up to do other things \u2014
p125
aVto sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food.
p126
aVThat is, historically, a really unique situation.
p127
aVNever before has the responsibility to feed the world
p128
aVbeen in the hands of so few people.
p129
aVAnd never before have so many people
p130
aVbeen oblivious of that fact.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.
p133
aVAnd as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.
p134
aVWe added in more sugar.
p135
aVWe add in raisins and oil and milk
p136
aVand all kinds of things to make bread,
p137
aVfrom a simple food into kind of a support for calories.
p138
aVAnd today, bread now is associated with obesity,
p139
aVwhich is very strange.
p140
aVIt is the basic, most fundamental food
p141
aVthat we've had in the last ten thousand years.
p142
aVWheat is the most important crop \u2014 the first crop we domesticated
p143
aVand the most important crop we still grow today.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut this is now this strange concoction
p146
aVof high calories.
p147
aVAnd that's not only true in this country,
p148
aVit is true all over the world.
p149
aVBread has migrated to tropical countries,
p150
aVwhere the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers
p151
aVand where the commuters
p152
aVfind bread much more handy to use
p153
aVthan rice or cassava.
p154
aVSo bread has become from a main staple,
p155
aVa source of calories
p156
aVassociated with obesity
p157
aVand also a source of modernity,
p158
aVof modern life.
p159
aVAnd the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo this is the story of bread as we know it now.
p162
aVBut of course the price of mass production
p163
aVhas been that we moved large-scale.
p164
aVAnd large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes,
p165
aVdestruction of biodiversity \u2014
p166
aVstill a lonely emu here
p167
aVin the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields.
p168
aVThe costs have been tremendous \u2014
p169
aVwater pollution, all the things you know about, destruction of our habitats.
p170
aa(lp171
VWhat we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about.
p172
aVAnd this is where I have to query all of you.
p173
aVHow many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals?
p174
aVHow many of you actually can make a bread
p175
aVin this way, without starting with a bread machine
p176
aVor just some kind of packaged flavor?
p177
aVCan you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs?
p178
aVWe have become very removed
p179
aVfrom what our bread really is,
p180
aVwhich, again, evolutionarily speaking,
p181
aVis very strange.
p182
aVIn fact not many of you know that
p183
aVour bread, of course, was not a European invention.
p184
aVIt was invented by farmers in Iraq
p185
aVand Syria in particular.
p186
aVThe tiny spike on the left to the center
p187
aVis actually the forefather of wheat.
p188
aVThis is where it all comes from,
p189
aVand where these farmers who actually, ten thousand years ago,
p190
aVput us on the road of bread.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow it is not surprising
p193
aVthat with this massification and large-scale production,
p194
aVthere is a counter-movement that emerged \u2014
p195
aVvery much also here in California.
p196
aVThe counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this.
p197
aVLet's go back to traditional farming.
p198
aVLet's go back to small-scale, to farmers' markets,
p199
aVsmall bakeries and all that." Wonderful.
p200
aVDon't we all agree? I certainly agree.
p201
aVI would love to go back to Tuscany
p202
aVto this kind of traditional setting,
p203
aVgastronomy, good food.
p204
aVBut this is a fallacy.
p205
aVAnd the fallacy comes from idealizing
p206
aVa past that we have forgotten about.
p207
aa(lp208
VIf we do this, if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming
p209
aVwe are going, actually, to relegate
p210
aVthese poor farmers and their husbands \u2014
p211
aVamong whom I have lived for many years,
p212
aVworking without electricity and water, to try to improve their food production \u2014
p213
aVwe relegate them to poverty.
p214
aVWhat they want are implements
p215
aVto increase their production:
p216
aVsomething to fertilize the soil,
p217
aVsomething to protect their crop and to bring it to a market.
p218
aVWe cannot just think that small-scale
p219
aVis the solution to the world food problem.
p220
aVIt's a luxury solution for us who can afford it,
p221
aVif you want to afford it.
p222
aVIn fact we do not want this poor woman
p223
aVto work the land like this.
p224
aVIf we say just small-scale production,
p225
aVas is the tendency here,
p226
aVto go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling
p227
aVcannot even eat oranges anymore
p228
aVbecause in Scandinavia we don't have oranges.
p229
aVSo local food production is out.
p230
aVBut also we do not want
p231
aVto relegate to poverty in the rural areas.
p232
aVAnd we do not want to relegate
p233
aVthe urban poor to starvation.
p234
aVSo we must find other solutions.
p235
aa(lp236
VOne of our problems is that world food production
p237
aVneeds to increase very rapidly \u2014
p238
aVdoubling by about 2030.
p239
aVThe main driver of that is actually meat.
p240
aVAnd meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular
p241
aVis what drives the prices of cereals.
p242
aVThat need for animal protein is going to continue.
p243
aVWe can discuss alternatives in another talk, perhaps one day,
p244
aVbut this is our driving force.
p245
aVSo what can we do?
p246
aVCan we find a solution to produce more?
p247
aVYes. But we need mechanization.
p248
aVAnd I'm making a real plea here.
p249
aVI feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer
p250
aVto work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice,
p251
aV150,000 times, just to plant a crop and weed it.
p252
aVYou cannot ask people to work under these conditions.
p253
aVWe need clever low-key mechanization
p254
aVthat avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we've had.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo what can we do?
p257
aVWe must feed three billion people in cities.
p258
aVWe will not do that through small farmers' markets
p259
aVbecause these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal.
p260
aVThey have low incomes. And they benefit
p261
aVfrom cheap, affordable, safe and diverse food.
p262
aVThat's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut yes there are some solutions.
p265
aVAnd let me just do one simple conceptual thing:
p266
aVif I plot science as a proxy
p267
aVfor control of the production process and scale.
p268
aVWhat you see is that we've started
p269
aVin the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture,
p270
aVwhich was sort of small-scale and low-control.
p271
aVWe've moved towards large-scale and very high control.
p272
aVWhat I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there
p273
aVbut go to a kind of regional scale \u2014
p274
aVnot just in terms of the scale of the fields,
p275
aVbut in terms of the entire food network.
p276
aVThat's where we should move.
p277
aVAnd the ultimate may be, but it doesn't apply to cereals,
p278
aVthat we have entirely closed ecosystems \u2014
p279
aVthe horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner.
p280
aVSo we need to think differently about agriculture science.
p281
aVAgriculture science for most people \u2014 and there are not many farmers
p282
aVamong you here \u2014
p283
aVhas this name of being bad,
p284
aVof being about pollution, about large-scale,
p285
aVabout the destruction of the environment.
p286
aVThat is not necessary.
p287
aVWe need more science and not less. And we need good science.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo what kind of science can we have?
p290
aVWell first of all I think
p291
aVwe can do much better on the existing technologies.
p292
aVUse biotechnology where useful,
p293
aVparticularly in pest and disease resistance.
p294
aVThere are also robots, for example,
p295
aVwho can recognize weeds
p296
aVwith a resolution of half an inch.
p297
aVWe have much cleverer irrigation.
p298
aVWe do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.
p299
aVAnd we need to think very dispassionately
p300
aVabout the comparative advantages
p301
aVof small-scale and large-scale.
p302
aVWe need to think that land is multi-functional.
p303
aVIt has different functions.
p304
aVThere are different ways in which we must use it \u2014
p305
aVfor residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.
p306
aVAnd we also need to re-examine livestock.
p307
aVGo regional and go to urban food systems.
p308
aVI want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements.
p309
aVI want to have horticulture
p310
aVand greenhouses on top of residential areas.
p311
aVAnd I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses
p312
aVand from the fermentation of crops
p313
aVto heat our residential areas.
p314
aVThere are all kinds of ways we can do it.
p315
aVWe cannot solve the world food problem
p316
aVby using biological agriculture.
p317
aVBut we can do a lot more.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd the main thing that I would really ask all of you
p320
aVas you go back to your countries, or as you stay here:
p321
aVask your government for an integrated food policy.
p322
aVFood is as important as energy,
p323
aVas security, as the environment.
p324
aVEverything is linked together.
p325
aVSo we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country
p326
aVlike the River Delta, where I live in the Netherlands,
p327
aVwe have combined these functions.
p328
aVSo this is not science fiction. We can combine things
p329
aVeven in a social sense of making
p330
aVthe rural areas more accessible to people \u2014
p331
aVto house, for example, the chronically sick.
p332
aVThere is all kinds of things we can do.
p333
aa(lp334
VBut there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say,
p335
aV"Let's get more bold science into agriculture."
p336
aVYou must go back
p337
aVand think about your own food chain.
p338
aVTalk to farmers. When was the last time
p339
aVyou went to a farm and talked to a farmer?
p340
aVTalk to people in restaurants.
p341
aVUnderstand where you are in the food chain,
p342
aVwhere your food comes from.
p343
aVUnderstand that you are part
p344
aVof this enormous chain of events.
p345
aVAnd that frees you up to do other things.
p346
aVAnd above all, to me, food is about respect.
p347
aVIt's about understanding, when you eat,
p348
aVthat there are also many people who are still in this situation,
p349
aVwho are still struggling for their daily food.
p350
aVAnd the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have,
p351
aVto think that doing everything by hand
p352
aVis going to be the solution,
p353
aVis really not morally justified.
p354
aVWe need to help to lift them out of poverty.
p355
aVWe need to make them proud of being a farmer
p356
aVbecause they allow us to survive.
p357
aVNever before, as I said,
p358
aVhas the responsibility for food
p359
aVbeen in the hands of so few.
p360
aVAnd never before have we had the luxury
p361
aVof taking it for granted
p362
aVbecause it is now so cheap.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd I think there is nobody else who has expressed
p365
aVbetter, to me, the idea that food, in the end,
p366
aVin our own tradition, is something holy.
p367
aVIt's not about nutrients and calories.
p368
aVIt's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.
p369
aVWho said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi,
p370
aV75 years ago, when he spoke about bread.
p371
aVHe did not speak about rice, in India. He said,
p372
aV"To those who have to go without two meals a day,
p373
aVGod can only appear as bread."
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd so as I'm finishing my bread here \u2014
p376
aVand I've been baking it, and I'll try not to burn my hands.
p377
aVLet me share
p378
aVwith those of you here in the first row.
p379
aVLet me share some of the food with you.
p380
aVTake some of my bread.
p381
aVAnd as you eat it, and as you try it \u2014
p382
aVplease come and stand up.
p383
aVHave some of it.
p384
aVI want you to think that every bite connects you
p385
aVto the past and the future:
p386
aVto these anonymous farmers,
p387
aVthat first bred the first wheat varieties;
p388
aVand to the farmers of today,
p389
aVwho've been making this. And you don't even know who they are.
p390
aVEvery meal you eat
p391
aVcontains ingredients from all across the world.
p392
aVEverything makes us so privileged,
p393
aVthat we can eat this food, that we don't struggle every day.
p394
aVAnd that, I think,
p395
aVevolutionarily-speaking is unique.
p396
aVWe've never had that before.
p397
aVSo enjoy your bread.
p398
aVEat it, and feel privileged.
p399
aVThank you very much.

VThe universe
p5
aVis really big.
p6
aVWe live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.
p7
aVThere are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.
p8
aVAnd if you take a camera
p9
aVand you point it at a random part of the sky,
p10
aVand you just keep the shutter open,
p11
aVas long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope,
p12
aVit will see something like this.
p13
aVEvery one of these little blobs
p14
aVis a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way \u2014
p15
aVa hundred billion stars in each of those blobs.
p16
aVThere are approximately a hundred billion galaxies
p17
aVin the observable universe.
p18
aV100 billion is the only number you need to know.
p19
aVThe age of the universe, between now and the Big Bang,
p20
aVis a hundred billion in dog years.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVWhich tells you something about our place in the universe.
p23
aa(lp24
VOne thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it.
p25
aVIt's extremely beautiful.
p26
aVI've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure
p27
aVthat made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve
p28
aVto really enjoy pictures of galaxies
p29
aVwhen they didn't have any.
p30
aVBut we would also like to understand it.
p31
aVAs a cosmologist, I want to ask, why is the universe like this?
p32
aVOne big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time.
p33
aVIf you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity,
p34
aVit would be moving away from you.
p35
aVAnd if you look at a galaxy even farther away,
p36
aVit would be moving away faster.
p37
aVSo we say the universe is expanding.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhat that means, of course, is that, in the past,
p40
aVthings were closer together.
p41
aVIn the past, the universe was more dense,
p42
aVand it was also hotter.
p43
aVIf you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.
p44
aVThat kind of makes sense to us.
p45
aVThe thing that doesn't make sense to us as much
p46
aVis that the universe, at early times, near the Big Bang,
p47
aVwas also very, very smooth.
p48
aVYou might think that that's not a surprise.
p49
aVThe air in this room is very smooth.
p50
aVYou might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out."
p51
aVBut the conditions near the Big Bang are very, very different
p52
aVthan the conditions of the air in this room.
p53
aVIn particular, things were a lot denser.
p54
aVThe gravitational pull of things
p55
aVwas a lot stronger near the Big Bang.
p56
aa(lp57
VWhat you have to think about
p58
aVis we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies,
p59
aVa hundred billion stars each.
p60
aVAt early times, those hundred billion galaxies
p61
aVwere squeezed into a region about this big \u2014
p62
aVliterally \u2014 at early times.
p63
aVAnd you have to imagine doing that squeezing
p64
aVwithout any imperfections,
p65
aVwithout any little spots
p66
aVwhere there were a few more atoms than somewhere else.
p67
aVBecause if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull
p68
aVinto a huge black hole.
p69
aVKeeping the universe very, very smooth at early times
p70
aVis not easy; it's a delicate arrangement.
p71
aVIt's a clue
p72
aVthat the early universe is not chosen randomly.
p73
aVThere is something that made it that way.
p74
aVWe would like to know what.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann,
p77
aVan Austrian physicist in the 19th century.
p78
aVAnd Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy.
p79
aVYou've heard of entropy.
p80
aVIt's the randomness, the disorder, the chaoticness of some systems.
p81
aVBoltzmann gave us a formula \u2014
p82
aVengraved on his tombstone now \u2014
p83
aVthat really quantifies what entropy is.
p84
aVAnd it's basically just saying
p85
aVthat entropy is the number of ways
p86
aVwe can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice,
p87
aVso that macroscopically it looks the same.
p88
aVIf you have the air in this room,
p89
aVyou don't notice each individual atom.
p90
aVA low entropy configuration
p91
aVis one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way.
p92
aVA high entropy arrangement
p93
aVis one that there are many arrangements that look that way.
p94
aVThis is a crucially important insight
p95
aVbecause it helps us explain
p96
aVthe second law of thermodynamics \u2014
p97
aVthe law that says that entropy increases in the universe,
p98
aVor in some isolated bit of the universe.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe reason why entropy increases
p101
aVis simply because there are many more ways
p102
aVto be high entropy than to be low entropy.
p103
aVThat's a wonderful insight,
p104
aVbut it leaves something out.
p105
aVThis insight that entropy increases, by the way,
p106
aVis what's behind what we call the arrow of time,
p107
aVthe difference between the past and the future.
p108
aVEvery difference that there is
p109
aVbetween the past and the future
p110
aVis because entropy is increasing \u2014
p111
aVthe fact that you can remember the past, but not the future.
p112
aVThe fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die,
p113
aValways in that order,
p114
aVthat's because entropy is increasing.
p115
aVBoltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy,
p116
aVit's very natural for it to increase
p117
aVbecause there's more ways to be high entropy.
p118
aVWhat he didn't explain
p119
aVwas why the entropy was ever low in the first place.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe fact that the entropy of the universe was low
p122
aVwas a reflection of the fact
p123
aVthat the early universe was very, very smooth.
p124
aVWe'd like to understand that.
p125
aVThat's our job as cosmologists.
p126
aVUnfortunately, it's actually not a problem
p127
aVthat we've been giving enough attention to.
p128
aVIt's not one of the first things people would say,
p129
aVif you asked a modern cosmologist,
p130
aV"What are the problems we're trying to address?"
p131
aVOne of the people who did understand that this was a problem
p132
aVwas Richard Feynman.
p133
aV50 years ago, he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures.
p134
aVHe gave the popular lectures
p135
aVthat became "The Character of Physical Law."
p136
aVHe gave lectures to Caltech undergrads
p137
aVthat became "The Feynman Lectures on Physics."
p138
aVHe gave lectures to Caltech graduate students
p139
aVthat became "The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation."
p140
aVIn every one of these books, every one of these sets of lectures,
p141
aVhe emphasized this puzzle:
p142
aVWhy did the early universe have such a small entropy?
p143
aa(lp144
VSo he says \u2014 I'm not going to do the accent \u2014
p145
aVhe says, "For some reason, the universe, at one time,
p146
aVhad a very low entropy for its energy content,
p147
aVand since then the entropy has increased.
p148
aVThe arrow of time cannot be completely understood
p149
aVuntil the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe
p150
aVare reduced still further
p151
aVfrom speculation to understanding."
p152
aVSo that's our job.
p153
aVWe want to know \u2014 this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking,
p154
aV"we've figured it out by now."
p155
aVIt's not true that we've figured it out by now.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe reason the problem has gotten worse,
p158
aVrather than better,
p159
aVis because in 1998
p160
aVwe learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.
p161
aVWe learned that it's accelerating.
p162
aVThe universe is not only expanding.
p163
aVIf you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.
p164
aVIf you come back a billion years later and look at it again,
p165
aVit will be moving away faster.
p166
aVIndividual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster
p167
aVso we say the universe is accelerating.
p168
aVUnlike the low entropy of the early universe,
p169
aVeven though we don't know the answer for this,
p170
aVwe at least have a good theory that can explain it,
p171
aVif that theory is right,
p172
aVand that's the theory of dark energy.
p173
aVIt's just the idea that empty space itself has energy.
p174
aa(lp175
VIn every little cubic centimeter of space,
p176
aVwhether or not there's stuff,
p177
aVwhether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever,
p178
aVthere's still energy, even in the space itself.
p179
aVAnd this energy, according to Einstein,
p180
aVexerts a push on the universe.
p181
aVIt is a perpetual impulse
p182
aVthat pushes galaxies apart from each other.
p183
aVBecause dark energy, unlike matter or radiation,
p184
aVdoes not dilute away as the universe expands.
p185
aVThe amount of energy in each cubic centimeter
p186
aVremains the same,
p187
aVeven as the universe gets bigger and bigger.
p188
aVThis has crucial implications
p189
aVfor what the universe is going to do in the future.
p190
aVFor one thing, the universe will expand forever.
p191
aa(lp192
VBack when I was your age,
p193
aVwe didn't know what the universe was going to do.
p194
aVSome people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future.
p195
aVEinstein was fond of this idea.
p196
aVBut if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away,
p197
aVthe universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.
p198
aV14 billion years in the past,
p199
aV100 billion dog years,
p200
aVbut an infinite number of years into the future.
p201
aVMeanwhile, for all intents and purposes,
p202
aVspace looks finite to us.
p203
aVSpace may be finite or infinite,
p204
aVbut because the universe is accelerating,
p205
aVthere are parts of it we cannot see
p206
aVand never will see.
p207
aVThere's a finite region of space that we have access to,
p208
aVsurrounded by a horizon.
p209
aVSo even though time goes on forever,
p210
aVspace is limited to us.
p211
aVFinally, empty space has a temperature.
p212
aa(lp213
VIn the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us
p214
aVthat a black hole, even though you think it's black,
p215
aVit actually emits radiation
p216
aVwhen you take into account quantum mechanics.
p217
aVThe curvature of space-time around the black hole
p218
aVbrings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation,
p219
aVand the black hole radiates.
p220
aVA precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons
p221
aVshowed that if you have dark energy in empty space,
p222
aVthen the whole universe radiates.
p223
aVThe energy of empty space
p224
aVbrings to life quantum fluctuations.
p225
aVAnd so even though the universe will last forever,
p226
aVand ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away,
p227
aVthere will always be some radiation,
p228
aVsome thermal fluctuations,
p229
aVeven in empty space.
p230
aVSo what this means
p231
aVis that the universe is like a box of gas
p232
aVthat lasts forever.
p233
aVWell what is the implication of that?
p234
aa(lp235
VThat implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century.
p236
aVHe said, well, entropy increases
p237
aVbecause there are many, many more ways
p238
aVfor the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy.
p239
aVBut that's a probabilistic statement.
p240
aVIt will probably increase,
p241
aVand the probability is enormously huge.
p242
aVIt's not something you have to worry about \u2014
p243
aVthe air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us.
p244
aVIt's very, very unlikely.
p245
aVExcept if they locked the doors
p246
aVand kept us here literally forever,
p247
aVthat would happen.
p248
aVEverything that is allowed,
p249
aVevery configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room,
p250
aVwould eventually be obtained.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe
p253
aVthat was in thermal equilibrium.
p254
aVHe didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe.
p255
aVHe thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton \u2014
p256
aVthey were absolute; they just stuck there forever.
p257
aVSo his idea of a natural universe
p258
aVwas one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere \u2014
p259
aVthe everything molecules.
p260
aVBut if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough,
p261
aVthe random fluctuations of those molecules
p262
aVwill occasionally bring them
p263
aVinto lower entropy configurations.
p264
aVAnd then, of course, in the natural course of things,
p265
aVthey will expand back.
p266
aVSo it's not that entropy must always increase \u2014
p267
aVyou can get fluctuations into lower entropy,
p268
aVmore organized situations.
p269
aa(lp270
VWell if that's true,
p271
aVBoltzmann then goes onto invent
p272
aVtwo very modern-sounding ideas \u2014
p273
aVthe multiverse and the anthropic principle.
p274
aVHe says, the problem with thermal equilibrium
p275
aVis that we can't live there.
p276
aVRemember, life itself depends on the arrow of time.
p277
aVWe would not be able to process information,
p278
aVmetabolize, walk and talk,
p279
aVif we lived in thermal equilibrium.
p280
aVSo if you imagine a very, very big universe,
p281
aVan infinitely big universe,
p282
aVwith randomly bumping into each other particles,
p283
aVthere will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states,
p284
aVand then they relax back.
p285
aVBut there will also be large fluctuations.
p286
aVOccasionally, you will make a planet
p287
aVor a star or a galaxy
p288
aVor a hundred billion galaxies.
p289
aVSo Boltzmann says,
p290
aVwe will only live in the part of the multiverse,
p291
aVin the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles,
p292
aVwhere life is possible.
p293
aVThat's the region where entropy is low.
p294
aVMaybe our universe is just one of those things
p295
aVthat happens from time to time.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow your homework assignment
p298
aVis to really think about this, to contemplate what it means.
p299
aVCarl Sagan once famously said
p300
aVthat "in order to make an apple pie,
p301
aVyou must first invent the universe."
p302
aVBut he was not right.
p303
aVIn Boltzmann's scenario, if you want to make an apple pie,
p304
aVyou just wait for the random motion of atoms
p305
aVto make you an apple pie.
p306
aVThat will happen much more frequently
p307
aVthan the random motions of atoms
p308
aVmaking you an apple orchard
p309
aVand some sugar and an oven,
p310
aVand then making you an apple pie.
p311
aVSo this scenario makes predictions.
p312
aVAnd the predictions are
p313
aVthat the fluctuations that make us are minimal.
p314
aVEven if you imagine that this room we are in now
p315
aVexists and is real and here we are,
p316
aVand we have, not only our memories,
p317
aVbut our impression that outside there's something
p318
aVcalled Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy,
p319
aVit's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain
p320
aVthan for them actually to randomly fluctuate
p321
aVinto Caltech, the United States and the galaxy.
p322
aa(lp323
VThe good news is that,
p324
aVtherefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right.
p325
aVThis scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation.
p326
aVEven if you left our galaxy out,
p327
aVyou would not get a hundred billion other galaxies.
p328
aVAnd Feynman also understood this.
p329
aVFeynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation,
p330
aVall the predictions are that
p331
aVif we look at a part of the world we've never seen before,
p332
aVwe will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at \u2014
p333
aVhigh entropy.
p334
aVIf our order were due to a fluctuation,
p335
aVwe would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it.
p336
aVWe therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation."
p337
aVSo that's good. The question is then what is the right answer?
p338
aVIf the universe is not a fluctuation,
p339
aVwhy did the early universe have a low entropy?
p340
aVAnd I would love to tell you the answer, but I'm running out of time.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VHere is the universe that we tell you about,
p345
aVversus the universe that really exists.
p346
aVI just showed you this picture.
p347
aVThe universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.
p348
aVIt's cooling off.
p349
aVBut we now know enough about the future of the universe
p350
aVto say a lot more.
p351
aVIf the dark energy remains around,
p352
aVthe stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel, they will stop burning.
p353
aVThey will fall into black holes.
p354
aVWe will live in a universe
p355
aVwith nothing in it but black holes.
p356
aVThat universe will last 10 to the 100 years \u2014
p357
aVa lot longer than our little universe has lived.
p358
aVThe future is much longer than the past.
p359
aVBut even black holes don't last forever.
p360
aVThey will evaporate,
p361
aVand we will be left with nothing but empty space.
p362
aVThat empty space lasts essentially forever.
p363
aVHowever, you notice, since empty space gives off radiation,
p364
aVthere's actually thermal fluctuations,
p365
aVand it cycles around
p366
aVall the different possible combinations
p367
aVof the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space.
p368
aVSo even though the universe lasts forever,
p369
aVthere's only a finite number of things
p370
aVthat can possibly happen in the universe.
p371
aVThey all happen over a period of time
p372
aVequal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo here's two questions for you.
p375
aVNumber one: If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years,
p376
aVwhy are we born
p377
aVin the first 14 billion years of it,
p378
aVin the warm, comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang?
p379
aVWhy aren't we in empty space?
p380
aVYou might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living,"
p381
aVbut that's not right.
p382
aVYou could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness.
p383
aVWhy aren't you?
p384
aVMore homework assignment for you.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo like I said, I don't actually know the answer.
p387
aVI'm going to give you my favorite scenario.
p388
aVEither it's just like that. There is no explanation.
p389
aVThis is a brute fact about the universe
p390
aVthat you should learn to accept and stop asking questions.
p391
aVOr maybe the Big Bang
p392
aVis not the beginning of the universe.
p393
aVAn egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration,
p394
aVand yet, when we open our refrigerator,
p395
aVwe do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find
p396
aVthis low entropy configuration in our refrigerator."
p397
aVThat's because an egg is not a closed system;
p398
aVit comes out of a chicken.
p399
aVMaybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken.
p400
aVMaybe there is something that naturally,
p401
aVthrough the growth of the laws of physics,
p402
aVgives rise to universe like ours
p403
aVin low entropy configurations.
p404
aVIf that's true, it would happen more than once;
p405
aVwe would be part of a much bigger multiverse.
p406
aVThat's my favorite scenario.
p407
aa(lp408
VSo the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation.
p409
aVMy bold speculation
p410
aVis that I will be absolutely vindicated by history.
p411
aVAnd 50 years from now,
p412
aVall of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths
p413
aVby the scientific and external communities.
p414
aVWe will all believe that our little universe
p415
aVis just a small part of a much larger multiverse.
p416
aVAnd even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang
p417
aVin terms of a theory
p418
aVthat we will be able to compare to observations.
p419
aVThis is a prediction. I might be wrong.
p420
aVBut we've been thinking as a human race
p421
aVabout what the universe was like,
p422
aVwhy it came to be in the way it did for many, many years.
p423
aVIt's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday.
p424
aa(lp425
VThank you.

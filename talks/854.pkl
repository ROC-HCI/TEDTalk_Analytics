VI'm going to tell you two things today:
p5
aVOne is what we have lost,
p6
aVand two, a way to bring it back.
p7
aVAnd let me start with this.
p8
aVThis is my baseline:
p9
aVThis is the Mediterranean coast
p10
aVwith no fish, bare rock
p11
aVand lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae.
p12
aVSomething like this is what I first saw
p13
aVwhen I jumped in the water for the first time
p14
aVin the Mediterranean coast off Spain.
p15
aVNow, if an alien came to earth \u2014
p16
aVlet's call him Joe \u2014
p17
aVwhat would Joe see?
p18
aVIf Joe jumped in a coral reef,
p19
aVthere are many things the alien could see.
p20
aVVery unlikely, Joe would jump
p21
aVon a pristine coral reef,
p22
aVa virgin coral reef with lots of coral, sharks, crocodiles,
p23
aVmanatees, groupers,
p24
aVturtles, etc.
p25
aVSo, probably, what Joe would see
p26
aVwould be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture.
p27
aVHere we have the extreme with dead corals,
p28
aVmicrobial soup and jellyfish.
p29
aVAnd where the diver is,
p30
aVthis is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now,
p31
aVwith very few corals, algae overgrowing the corals,
p32
aVlots of bacteria,
p33
aVand where the large animals are gone.
p34
aVAnd this is what most marine scientists have seen too.
p35
aVThis is their baseline. This is what they think is natural
p36
aVbecause we started modern science
p37
aVwith scuba diving long after
p38
aVwe started degrading marine ecosystems.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I'm going to get us all on a time machine,
p41
aVand we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past
p42
aVto see what the ocean was like.
p43
aVAnd let's start with this time machine, the Line Islands,
p44
aVwhere we have conducted a series
p45
aVof National Geographic expeditions.
p46
aVThis sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati
p47
aVthat spans across the equator
p48
aVand it has several uninhabited,
p49
aVunfished, pristine islands
p50
aVand a few inhabited islands.
p51
aVSo let's start with the first one: Christmas Island, over 5,000 people.
p52
aVMost of the reefs are dead,
p53
aVmost of the corals are dead \u2014 overgrown by algae \u2014
p54
aVand most of the fish are smaller than
p55
aVthe pencils we use to count them.
p56
aVWe did 250 hours of diving here
p57
aVin 2005.
p58
aVWe didn't see a single shark.
p59
aVThis is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777
p60
aVand he described a huge abundance of sharks
p61
aVbiting the rudders and the oars of their small boats
p62
aVwhile they were going ashore.
p63
aa(lp64
VLet's move the dial a little bit to the past.
p65
aVFanning Island, 2,500 people.
p66
aVThe corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish.
p67
aVThis is what many divers would consider paradise.
p68
aVThis is where you can see most
p69
aVof the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
p70
aVAnd many people think this is really, really beautiful,
p71
aVif this is your baseline.
p72
aVIf we go back to a place
p73
aVlike Palmyra Atoll,
p74
aVwhere I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago,
p75
aVthe corals are doing better and there are sharks.
p76
aVYou can see sharks in every single dive.
p77
aVAnd this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs.
p78
aVBut then, if we shift the dial
p79
aV200, 500 years back,
p80
aVthen we get to the places where the corals
p81
aVare absolutely healthy and gorgeous,
p82
aVforming spectacular structures,
p83
aVand where the predators
p84
aVare the most conspicuous thing,
p85
aVwhere you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhat have we learned from these places?
p88
aVThis is what we thought was natural.
p89
aVThis is what we call the biomass pyramid.
p90
aVIf we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them,
p91
aVthis is what we would expect.
p92
aVMost of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores,
p93
aVthe parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae.
p94
aVThen the plankton feeders, these little damselfish,
p95
aVthe little animals floating in the water.
p96
aVAnd then we have a lower biomass of carnivores,
p97
aVand a lower biomass of top head,
p98
aVor the sharks, the large snappers, the large groupers.
p99
aVBut this is a consequence.
p100
aVThis view of the world is a consequence
p101
aVof having studied degraded reefs.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhen we went to pristine reefs,
p104
aVwe realized that the natural world
p105
aVwas upside down;
p106
aVthis pyramid was inverted.
p107
aVThe top head does account for most of the biomass,
p108
aVin some places up to 85 percent,
p109
aVlike Kingman Reef, which is now protected.
p110
aVThe good news is that, in addition to having more predators,
p111
aVthere's more of everything.
p112
aVThe size of these boxes is bigger.
p113
aVWe have more sharks, more biomass of snappers,
p114
aVmore biomass of herbivores, too,
p115
aVlike these parrot fish that are like marine goats.
p116
aVThey clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen,
p117
aVthey eat, and they keep the reef clean
p118
aVand allow the corals to replenish.
p119
aVNot only do these places \u2014
p120
aVthese ancient, pristine places \u2014 have lots of fish,
p121
aVbut they also have other important components
p122
aVof the ecosystem like the giant clams;
p123
aVpavements of giant clams in the lagoons,
p124
aVup to 20, 25 per square meter.
p125
aVThese have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world,
p126
aVand they filter the water;
p127
aVthey keep the water clean from
p128
aVmicrobes and pathogens.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut still, now we have global warming.
p131
aVIf we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law
p132
aVor their remoteness, this is great.
p133
aVBut the water gets warmer for too long
p134
aVand the corals die.
p135
aVSo how are these fish,
p136
aVthese predators going to help?
p137
aVWell, what we have seen is that
p138
aVin this particular area
p139
aVduring El Nino, year '97, '98,
p140
aVthe water was too warm for too long,
p141
aVand many corals bleached
p142
aVand many died.
p143
aVIn Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down,
p144
aVwhere the large animals are gone,
p145
aVthe corals have not recovered.
p146
aVIn Fanning Island, the corals are not recovered.
p147
aVBut you see here
p148
aVa big table coral that died and collapsed.
p149
aVAnd the fish have grazed the algae,
p150
aVso the turf of algae is a little lower.
p151
aVThen you go to Palmyra Atoll
p152
aVthat has more biomass of herbivores,
p153
aVand the dead corals are clean,
p154
aVand the corals are coming back.
p155
aVAnd when you go to the pristine side,
p156
aVdid this ever bleach?
p157
aVThese places bleached too, but they recovered faster.
p158
aVThe more intact, the more complete,
p159
aV[and] the more complex your food web,
p160
aVthe higher the resilience, [and] the more likely
p161
aVthat the system is going to recover
p162
aVfrom the short-term impacts of warming events.
p163
aVAnd that's good news, so we need to recover that structure.
p164
aVWe need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there
p165
aVso the ecosystem can adapt
p166
aVto the effects of global warming.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo if we have to reset the baseline,
p169
aVif we have to push the ecosystem back to the left,
p170
aVhow can we do it?
p171
aVWell, there are several ways.
p172
aVOne very clear way is the marine protected areas,
p173
aVespecially no-take reserves
p174
aVthat we set aside
p175
aVto allow for the recovery for marine life.
p176
aVAnd let me go back to that image
p177
aVof the Mediterranean.
p178
aVThis was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid.
p179
aVAnd at the same time I was watching
p180
aVJacques Cousteau's shows on TV,
p181
aVwith all this richness and abundance and diversity.
p182
aVAnd I thought that this richness
p183
aVbelonged to tropical seas,
p184
aVand that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea.
p185
aVBut, little did I know,
p186
aVuntil I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve.
p187
aVAnd this is what I saw, lots of fish.
p188
aa(lp189
VAfter a few years, between five and seven years,
p190
aVfish come back, they eat the urchins,
p191
aVand then the algae grow again.
p192
aVSo you have this little algal forest,
p193
aVand in the size of a laptop
p194
aVyou can find more than 100 species of algae,
p195
aVmostly microscopic fit
p196
aVhundreds of species of little animals
p197
aVthat then feed the fish,
p198
aVso that the system recovers.
p199
aVAnd this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,
p200
aVis only 94 hectares,
p201
aVand it brings 6 million euros to the local economy,
p202
aV20 times more than fishing,
p203
aVand it represents 88 percent
p204
aVof all the tourist revenue.
p205
aVSo these places not only help the ecosystem
p206
aVbut also help the people
p207
aVwho can benefit from the ecosystem.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo let me just give you a summary
p210
aVof what no-take reserves do.
p211
aVThese places, when we protect them,
p212
aVif we compare them to unprotected areas nearby, this is what happens.
p213
aVThe number of species increases 21 percent;
p214
aVso if you have 1,000 species
p215
aVyou would expect 200 more in a marine reserve.
p216
aVThis is very substantial.
p217
aVThe size of organisms increases a third,
p218
aVso your fish are now this big.
p219
aVThe abundance, how many fish you have per square meter,
p220
aVincreases almost 170 percent.
p221
aVAnd the biomass \u2014 this is the most spectacular change \u2014
p222
aV4.5 times greater biomass
p223
aVon average, just after five to seven years.
p224
aVIn some places up to 10 times
p225
aVlarger biomass inside the reserves.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo we have all these things
p228
aVinside the reserve that grow, and what do they do?
p229
aVThey reproduce. That's population biology 101.
p230
aVIf you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die,
p231
aVthey grow larger and they reproduce a lot.
p232
aVAnd same thing for invertebrates. This is the example.
p233
aVThese are egg cases
p234
aVlaid by a snail off the coast of Chile,
p235
aVand this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom.
p236
aVOutside the reserve,
p237
aVyou cannot even detect this.
p238
aVOne point three million eggs per square meter
p239
aVinside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant.
p240
aVSo these organisms reproduce,
p241
aVthe little larvae juveniles spill over,
p242
aVthey all spill over,
p243
aVand then people can benefit from them outside too.
p244
aVThis is in the Bahamas: Nassau grouper.
p245
aVHuge abundance of groupers inside the reserve,
p246
aVand the closer you get to the reserve,
p247
aVthe more fish you have.
p248
aVSo the fishermen are catching more.
p249
aVYou can see where the limits of the reserve are
p250
aVbecause you see the boats lined up.
p251
aVSo there is spill over;
p252
aVthere are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves
p253
aVthat help people around them,
p254
aVwhile at the same time
p255
aVthe reserve is protecting
p256
aVthe entire habitat. It is building resilience.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo what we have now \u2014
p259
aVor a world without reserves \u2014
p260
aVis like a debit account
p261
aVwhere we withdraw all the time
p262
aVand we never make any deposit.
p263
aVReserves are like savings accounts.
p264
aVWe have this principal that we don't touch;
p265
aVthat produces returns,
p266
aVsocial, economic and ecological.
p267
aVAnd if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves,
p268
aVthis is like compound interest.
p269
aVTwo examples, again,
p270
aVof how these reserves can benefit people.
p271
aVThis is how much fishermen get
p272
aVeveryday in Kenya, fishing
p273
aVover a series of years,
p274
aVin a place where
p275
aVthere is no protection; it's a free-for-all.
p276
aVOnce the most degrading fishing gear,
p277
aVseine nets, were removed,
p278
aVthe fishermen were catching more.
p279
aVIf you fish less, you're actually catching more.
p280
aVBut if we add the no-take reserve on top of that,
p281
aVthe fishermen are still making more money
p282
aVby fishing less around an area that is protected.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnother example:
p285
aVNassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.
p286
aVThis is grouper sex,
p287
aVand the groupers aggregate around the full moons
p288
aVof December and January for a week.
p289
aVThey used to aggregate up to the
p290
aVtens of thousands, 30,000 groupers about this big
p291
aVin one hectare, in one aggregation.
p292
aVFishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them.
p293
aVWhen I went there for the first time in 2000,
p294
aVthere were only 3,000 groupers left.
p295
aVAnd the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent
p296
aVof the entire spawning population every year.
p297
aVSo we did a simple analysis,
p298
aVand it doesn't take rocket science
p299
aVto figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year,
p300
aVyour fishery is going to collapse very quickly.
p301
aVAnd with the fishery, the entire reproductive ability
p302
aVof the species goes extinct.
p303
aVIt happened in many places around the Caribbean.
p304
aVAnd they would make 4,000 dollars per year,
p305
aVtotal, for the entire fishery,
p306
aVseveral fishing boats.
p307
aVNow, if you do an economic analysis
p308
aVand project what would happen
p309
aVif the fish were not cut,
p310
aVif we brought just 20 divers
p311
aVone month per year,
p312
aVthe revenue would be more than 20 times higher
p313
aVand that would be sustainable over time.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo how much of this do we have?
p316
aVIf this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have?
p317
aVAnd you already heard that
p318
aVless than one percent of the ocean's protected.
p319
aVWe're getting closer to one percent now,
p320
aVthanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago,
p321
aVand only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing.
p322
aVScientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent
p323
aVof the ocean should be protected.
p324
aVThe estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent
p325
aVfor a series of goals of biodiversity
p326
aVand fishery enhancement and resilience.
p327
aa(lp328
VNow, is this possible? People would ask: How much would that cost?
p329
aVWell, let's think about
p330
aVhow much we are paying now
p331
aVto subsidize fishing:
p332
aV35 billion dollars per year.
p333
aVMany of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices.
p334
aVWell, there are a couple estimates
p335
aVof how much it would cost to create
p336
aVa network of protected areas
p337
aVcovering 20 percent of the ocean
p338
aVthat would be only a fraction
p339
aVof what we are now paying;
p340
aVthe government hands out to a fishery
p341
aVthat is collapsing.
p342
aVPeople are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing.
p343
aVA creation of a network of reserves
p344
aVwould provide direct employment for more than a million people
p345
aVplus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo how can we do that?
p348
aVIf it's so clear that these savings accounts
p349
aVare good for the environment and for people,
p350
aVwhy don't we have 20, 50 percent of the ocean?
p351
aVAnd how can we reach that goal?
p352
aVWell, there are two ways of getting there.
p353
aVThe trivial solution is to create really large protected areas
p354
aVlike the Chagos Archipelago.
p355
aVThe problem is that we can create these large reserves
p356
aVonly in places where there are no people, where there is no social conflict,
p357
aVwhere the political cost is really low
p358
aVand the economic cost is also low.
p359
aVAnd a few of us, a few organizations in this room and elsewhere
p360
aVare working on this.
p361
aa(lp362
VBut what about the rest of the coast of the world,
p363
aVwhere people live and make a living out of fishing?
p364
aVWell, there are three main reasons why
p365
aVwe don't have tens of thousands of small reserves:
p366
aVThe first one is that people have no idea
p367
aVwhat marine reserves do,
p368
aVand fishermen tend to be really, really defensive
p369
aVwhen it comes to regulating or closing
p370
aVan area, even if it's small.
p371
aVSecond, the governance is not right
p372
aVbecause most coastal communities around the world
p373
aVdon't have the authority
p374
aVto monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it.
p375
aVIt's a top down hierarchical structure
p376
aVwhere people wait for
p377
aVgovernment agents to come
p378
aVand this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources.
p379
aa(lp380
VWhich takes us to the third reason,
p381
aVwhy we don't have many more reserves,
p382
aVis that the funding models have been wrong.
p383
aVNGOs and governments
p384
aVspend a lot of time and energy and resources
p385
aVin a few small areas, usually.
p386
aVSo marine conservation and coastal protection
p387
aVhas become a sink for government or philanthropic money,
p388
aVand this is not sustainable.
p389
aVSo the solutions are just
p390
aVfixing these three issues.
p391
aVFirst, we need to develop a global awareness campaign
p392
aVto inspire local communities and governments
p393
aVto create no-take reserves
p394
aVthat are better than what we have now.
p395
aVIt's the savings accounts
p396
aVversus the debit accounts with no deposits.
p397
aVSecond, we need to redesign our governance
p398
aVso conservation efforts can be decentralized,
p399
aVso conservation efforts don't depend on
p400
aVwork from NGOs
p401
aVor from government agencies
p402
aVand can be created by the local communities,
p403
aVlike it happens in the Philippines and a few other places.
p404
aVAnd third, and very important,
p405
aVwe need to develop new business models.
p406
aVThe philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves
p407
aVis not sustainable.
p408
aVWe really need to develop models, business models,
p409
aVwhere coastal conservation
p410
aVis an investment,
p411
aVbecause we already know
p412
aVthat these marine reserves provide
p413
aVsocial, ecological and economic benefits.
p414
aa(lp415
VAnd I'd like to finish with one thought,
p416
aVwhich is that no one
p417
aVorganization alone
p418
aVis going to save the ocean.
p419
aVThere has been a lot of competition in the past,
p420
aVand we need to develop
p421
aVa new model of partnership,
p422
aVtruly collaborative,
p423
aVwhere we are looking for complementing,
p424
aVnot substituting.
p425
aVThe stakes are just too high
p426
aVto continue the way we are going.
p427
aVSo let's do that. Thank you very much.
p428
aa(lp429
V(Applause)
p430
aa(lp431
VChris Anderson: Thank you Enric.
p432
aa(lp433
VEnric Sala: Thank you.
p434
aa(lp435
VCA: That was a masterful job
p436
aVof pulling things together.
p437
aVFirst of all, your pyramid, your inverted pyramid,
p438
aVshowing 85 percent biomass in the predators,
p439
aVthat seems impossible.
p440
aVHow could 85 percent
p441
aVsurvive on 15 percent?
p442
aa(lp443
VES: Well, imagine that you have two gears
p444
aVof a watch, a big one and a small one.
p445
aVThe big one is moving very slowly, and the small one is moving fast.
p446
aVThat's basically it.
p447
aVThe animals at the lower parts of the food chain,
p448
aVthey reproduce very fast; they grow really fast; they produce millions of eggs.
p449
aVUp there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years.
p450
aVThey reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism;
p451
aVand, basically, they just maintain their biomass.
p452
aVSo, basically, the production surplus of these guys down there
p453
aVis enough to maintain this biomass
p454
aVthat is not moving.
p455
aVThey are like capacitors of the system.
p456
aa(lp457
VCA: That's very fascinating.
p458
aVSo, really, our picture of a food pyramid
p459
aVis just \u2014 we have to change that completely.
p460
aa(lp461
VES: At least in the seas.
p462
aVWhat we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid
p463
aVis the equivalent of the Serengeti,
p464
aVwith five lions per wildebeest.
p465
aVAnd on land, this cannot work.
p466
aVBut at least on coral reefs are systems
p467
aVwhere there is a bottom component with structure.
p468
aVWe think this is universal.
p469
aVBut we have started studying pristine reefs
p470
aVonly very recently.
p471
aa(lp472
VCA: So the numbers you presented really are astonishing.
p473
aVYou're saying we're spending 35 billion dollars
p474
aVnow on subsidies.
p475
aVIt would only cost 16 billion to set up
p476
aV20 percent of the ocean as
p477
aVmarine protected areas
p478
aVthat actually give new living choices
p479
aVto the fishermen as well.
p480
aVIf the world was a smarter place,
p481
aVwe could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars.
p482
aVWe've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something.
p483
aa(lp484
VES: And then we have the under-performance of fisheries
p485
aVthat is 50 billion dollars.
p486
aVSo again, one of the big solutions is
p487
aVhave the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies
p488
aVto sustainable practices.
p489
aa(lp490
VCA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there
p491
aVabout ending this subsidies madness.
p492
aVSo thank you for those numbers.
p493
aVThe last one's a personal question.
p494
aVA lot of the experience of people here
p495
aVwho've been in the oceans for a long time
p496
aVhas just been seeing this degradation, the places they saw that were beautiful
p497
aVgetting worse, depressing.
p498
aVTalk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced
p499
aVof going to these pristine areas
p500
aVand seeing things coming back.
p501
aa(lp502
VES: It is a spiritual experience.
p503
aVWe go there to try to understand the ecosystems,
p504
aVto try to measure or count fish and sharks
p505
aVand see how these places are different from the places we know.
p506
aVBut the best feeling
p507
aVis this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about,
p508
aVwhere humans have this sense of awe and wonder
p509
aVin front of untamed nature, of raw nature.
p510
aVAnd there, only there,
p511
aVyou really feel that you are part of a larger thing
p512
aVor of a larger global ecosystem.
p513
aVAnd if it were not for these places that show hope,
p514
aVI don't think I could continue doing this job.
p515
aVIt would be just too depressing.
p516
aa(lp517
VCA: Well, Enric, thank you so much for sharing
p518
aVsome of that spiritual experience with us all. Thank you.
p519
aa(lp520
VES: Thank you very much.

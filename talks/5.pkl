VWhat I want to talk about is, as background,
p5
aVis the idea that cars are art.
p6
aVThis is actually quite meaningful to me,
p7
aVbecause car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole \u2014
p8
aVwe don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it \u2014
p9
aVand cars are thought so much as a product
p10
aVthat it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side
p11
aVunder the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.
p12
aVAnd so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane \u2014 if you accept that \u2014
p13
aVthat you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.
p16
aVThis is completely different than automobiles.
p17
aVAutomobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.
p18
aVAnd they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose;
p19
aVand certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years
p20
aVand have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways;
p21
aVthey've also been a real pain in the ass,
p22
aVbecause automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.
p23
aVWe have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion \u2014
p24
aVbut that's not what interests me in this speech.
p25
aa(lp26
VWhat interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use,
p27
aVbut cars are what we are, in many ways.
p28
aVAnd as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles,
p29
aVand I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on,
p30
aVand lots of other things, then I think we can look past that
p31
aVand try and understand why this hook is in many of us \u2014
p32
aVof this car-y-ness \u2014 and what that means, what we can learn from it.
p33
aVThat's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes;
p34
aVcars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself:
p35
aVthey take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it \u2014
p36
aVyour anger, whatever. It's an avatar.
p37
aVIt's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy,
p38
aVthe car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage,
p39
aVyou've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right?
p40
aa(lp41
VCars are a sculpture \u2014 did you know this?
p42
aVThat every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.
p43
aVMany people think, "Well, it's computers,
p44
aVand it's done by machines and stuff like that."
p45
aVWell, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.
p46
aVIt's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.
p47
aVAnd they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car
p48
aVthat you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.
p49
aVThat tension between the need to express, the need to discover,
p50
aVthen you put something new into it,
p51
aVand at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.
p52
aVRules that say, this is how you handle surfaces;
p53
aVthis is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.
p54
aVAnd that tension, that discovery, that push for something new \u2014
p55
aVand at the same time, that sense of obligation
p56
aVto the regards of craftsmanship \u2014
p57
aVthat's as strong in cars as it is in anything.
p58
aVWe work in clay, which hasn't changed much
p59
aVsince Michelangelo started screwing around with it,
p60
aVand there's a very interesting analogy to that too.
p61
aVReal quickly \u2014 Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?
p62
aVThere we go, the automobile.
p63
aVThat was 100 years right there \u2014 did you catch that?
p64
aVBetween that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?
p65
aVOK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here,
p66
aVbut the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.
p67
aVI want to talk about this.
p68
aVWhy it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality
p69
aVyou have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.
p70
aVAnd it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore,
p73
aVI believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about \u2014
p74
aVat least when it comes to cars \u2014
p75
aVcomes right back to this idea of the mean.
p76
aVIt's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself,
p77
aVthat comes in a car, and takes over people like me.
p78
aVAnd we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive.
p79
aVWe are completely infected. And beauty can be the result
p80
aVof this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.
p81
aVThis sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it,
p82
aVand it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.
p83
aVAnd it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this,
p84
aVor when somebody works like this.
p85
aVIt's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.
p88
aVArt, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.
p89
aVNow this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.
p90
aVWe don't really have a problem talking about love.
p91
aVWe don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.
p92
aVThat's what we're searching for \u2014
p93
aVwhen we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.
p94
aVWe're not trying to find vanity and beauty.
p95
aVWe're trying to find the beauty in the truth.
p96
aVHowever, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian,
p97
aVinstead of this quantum approach.
p98
aVWe're dealing with irrationalisms,
p99
aVand we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist,
p100
aVand the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like
p101
aVtwo and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.
p102
aVAnd that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence
p103
aVin why we're doing what we're doing.
p104
aVWe've pretty much accepted the fact, though,
p105
aVthat we are the women in the organization at BMW \u2014
p106
aVBMW is a very manly type business, \u2014 men, men, men; it's engineers.
p107
aVAnd we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK,
p108
aVthat's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.
p109
aVBecause what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.
p110
aa(lp111
VWe're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic;
p112
aVit's really a truth.
p113
aVAnd I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars,
p114
aVis very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it,
p115
aVwith soul. You know how strong this is.
p116
aVWell, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me,
p117
aVare interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.
p118
aa(lp119
VI discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.
p120
aVAnd first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say,
p121
aVyou know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society,
p122
aVput the word "design" in, and it still works,
p123
aVlike this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?
p124
aVYou can understand that. It works in truisms.
p125
aV"All is fair in design and war."
p126
aVCertainly we live in a competitive society.
p127
aVI think this one here, there's a pop song
p128
aVthat really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like
p129
aVyou know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?
p130
aVToothbrush, cool.
p131
aVIt really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VThis is one substitution that I believe
p136
aVall of us, in design management, are guilty of.
p137
aVAnd this idea that there is more to love,
p138
aVmore to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other,
p139
aVit can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.
p140
aVBut right now it's in dealing with our own people,
p141
aVour own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.
p142
aVThe idea of people-work is what we work with here,
p143
aVand I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.
p144
aVWe have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision \u2014
p145
aVthat means we have to work as one family;
p146
aVwe have to understand ourselves that way.
p147
aVThere's good times; there's interesting times;
p148
aVand there's some stress times too.
p149
aVYou want to do cars, you've got to go outside.
p150
aVYou've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.
p151
aVThat's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.
p152
aVWe haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?
p153
aVWell, you've got to stand outside to do this.
p154
aVAnd because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.
p155
aVAll right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery,
p156
aVand art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?
p157
aVAnd one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion,
p158
aVwe are completely in love with our own creations.
p159
aVThis is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.
p160
aVThis is sick beyond belief.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VBut because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team
p165
aVtakes on a new dimension, a new meaning.
p166
aVWe have a shared center; we have a shared focus \u2014
p167
aVthat car stays at the middle of all our relationships.
p168
aVAnd it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.
p169
aVI heard today about Joseph's death genes
p170
aVthat have to go in and kill cell reproduction.
p171
aVYou know, that's what I have to do sometimes.
p172
aVWe start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars,
p173
aVdown to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car,
p174
aVand I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.
p175
aVSomeone's love, someone's baby.
p176
aVThis is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team
p177
aVthat permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.
p178
aVThey've got that gene infected in them as well,
p179
aVand they want that to live, more than anything else.
p180
aa(lp181
VWell, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team
p182
aVin a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you,
p183
aVbecause I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.
p184
aVWe wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.
p185
aVWe wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it,
p186
aVthat I only had a phone number that connected me to them.
p187
aVSo, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist,
p188
aVwe decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers
p189
aVto find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.
p190
aVThis is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name,
p191
aVDeep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM \u2014
p192
aVwe actually stole it from them because we figured
p193
aVif anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.
p194
aVIt turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue,
p195
aVin a company like BMW, has a hook \u2014 "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.
p196
aVSo people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers,
p197
aVand we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget,
p198
aVwhat we thought was a set of deliverables,
p199
aVa timetable, and nothing else.
p200
aVLike I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd a group of engineers worked in Germany,
p203
aVand the idea was they would work separately
p204
aVon this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.
p205
aVThey would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart,
p206
aVcome together, and they would produce together
p207
aVa monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas \u2014
p208
aVbut at the same time came together and resolved the problems.
p209
aVHopefully, really understand the customer at its heart,
p210
aVwhere the customer is, live with them in America. So \u2014 sent the team off,
p211
aVand actually something different happened. They went other places.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VThey disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.
p216
aVNow, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas,
p217
aVand I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon,
p218
aVand I got these postcards of Niagara Falls,
p219
aVand pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.
p220
aVAnd I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car,
p221
aVthey're doing research that I've never even thought about before."
p222
aVRight? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio,
p223
aVand six or seven apartments,
p224
aVit was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.
p225
aVAnd \u2014 at least they told me it was her house,
p226
aVI guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.
p227
aVBut anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.
p228
aVNow this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their \u2014
p229
aVsome had left their wives behind and families behind,
p230
aVand they literally lived in this house
p231
aVfor the entire six months the project was in America,
p232
aVbut the first three months were the most intensive.
p233
aVAnd one of the young women in the project,
p234
aVshe was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.
p235
aVThe bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub \u2014
p236
aVit's quite fascinating.
p237
aa(lp238
VOn the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?
p239
aVNothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards
p240
aVof these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever,
p241
aVsaying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK?
p242
aVSo my concept of what a design studio was probably \u2014
p243
aVI wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.
p244
aa(lp245
VHowever, the engineers back in Munich
p246
aVhad taken on this kind of Newtonian solution,
p247
aVand they were trying to find how many cup holders
p248
aVcan dance on the head of a pin, and, you know,
p249
aVthese really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.
p250
aVAnd one was hoping that these two teams would get together,
p251
aVand this collusion of incredible creativity,
p252
aVunder these incredible surroundings,
p253
aVand these incredibly stressed-out engineers,
p254
aVwould create some incredible solutions.
p255
aVWell, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was \u2014
p256
aVthese guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.
p257
aVYou get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point,
p258
aVyou have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far,
p259
aVthat they cannot bring this together at all.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon,
p262
aVwhich is just up the road from here \u2014 you know Tiburon?
p263
aVAnd the idea was after the first three months of this independent research
p264
aVthey would present it all to Dr. Goschel \u2014
p265
aVwho is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project \u2014
p266
aVand they would present their results.
p267
aVWe would see where we were going,
p268
aVwe would see the first indication of what could be
p269
aVthe successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.
p270
aVAnd so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.
p271
aVI mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense \u2014
p272
aVI know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it,
p273
aVand I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either \u2014
p274
aVbut somehow all this is going to come together,
p275
aVand I'm going to see some really great product.
p276
aVSo we went to Tiburon, after three months,
p277
aVand the team had gotten together the week before,
p278
aVmany days ahead of time.
p279
aVThe engineers flew over, and designers got together with them,
p280
aVand they put their presentation together.
p281
aa(lp282
VWell, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.
p283
aVAnd they hadn't done anything because \u2014
p284
aVkind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems,
p285
aVand we were asking them to create a problem.
p286
aVAnd the engineers were waiting for the designers to say,
p287
aV"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."
p288
aVAnd they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was,
p289
aVthe engineers showed up with nothing.
p290
aVAnd the engineers told the designers,
p291
aV"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out,
p292
aVwe'll walk right out of the project."
p293
aa(lp294
VSo I didn't know any of this,
p295
aVand we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.
p296
aVThere was a whole lot of dialog.
p297
aVWe spent four hours being told all about vocabulary
p298
aVthat needs to be built between engineers and designers.
p299
aVAnd here I'm expecting at any moment, "OK, they're going to turn the page,
p300
aVand I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches,
p301
aVI'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going."
p302
aVDialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon
p303
aVit was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance,
p304
aVI was seriously being baffled with bullshit.
p305
aVAnd if you can imagine what this is like,
p306
aVto have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working,
p307
aVand they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning,
p308
aVand they're doing all this stuff.
p309
aVI went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.
p310
aVYou can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.
p311
aa(lp312
VAfter four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.
p313
aVI screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing?
p314
aVYou're letting me down, you're my designers,
p315
aVyou're supposed to be the creative ones,
p316
aVwhat the hell is going on around here?"
p317
aVIt was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones,
p318
aVbut this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people;
p319
aVhow could they take BMW's money,
p320
aVhow could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?
p321
aVBecause of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons
p322
aVfull of drawings, model concepts, pictures \u2014 everything I wanted,
p323
aVthey'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers \u2014
p324
aVand they'd decided not to show me anything,
p325
aVin order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start,
p326
aVbecause they hadn't realized, of course,
p327
aVthat they couldn't do problem creating.
p328
aVSo we went to lunch \u2014
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.
p333
aVThe engineers all sat at one end of the table,
p334
aVthe designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.
p335
aVAnd I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?
p336
aVProbably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.
p337
aVThat's what you get furious about right?
p338
aVAnd somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know,
p339
aVdid she fly out with me or something?
p340
aVI said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.
p341
aVAnd I recalled that when Catherine and I were married,
p342
aVthe priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.
p343
aVHe said, "Love is not selfish," he said,
p344
aV"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'
p345
aVIt doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month,
p346
aVand it's two times less than last month,
p347
aVso that means you don't love me as much.
p348
aVLove is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought,
p349
aV"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.
p350
aVI'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.
p351
aVThis cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches,
p352
aVand to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.
p353
aVThis cannot be."
p354
aa(lp355
VSo I told them this story. I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here,
p356
aVthis isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys
p357
aVbased on a premise that is a quantifiable one.
p358
aVBased on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'"
p359
aVI said "This can't be."
p360
aVActually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it,
p361
aVbecause they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up
p362
aVinside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted,
p363
aVand merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.
p364
aVAnd I think we felt much closer that day,
p365
aVwe cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there,
p366
aVand we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.
p367
aVWe put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love,
p368
aVI think, truly back into the center of the process.
p369
aa(lp370
VBy the way, that team went on to create six different concepts
p371
aVfor the next model of what would be the proposal
p372
aVfor the next generation after SUVs in America.
p373
aVOne of those was the idea of a crossover coupes \u2014
p374
aVyou see it downstairs, the X Coupe \u2014 they had a lot of fun with that.
p375
aVIt was the rendition of our motorcycle,
p376
aVthe GS, as Carl Magnusson says, "brute-iful,"
p377
aVas the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.
p378
aVAnd so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you,
p379
aVwas this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of "Little Prince."
p380
aVThere's a lot to be said about trust and love,
p381
aVif you know that those two words are synonymous for design.
p382
aVI had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day,
p383
aVand it's stayed that way ever since.
p384
aVAnd I hope that you too find that there's more to design,
p385
aVand more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.
p386
aVIt's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.

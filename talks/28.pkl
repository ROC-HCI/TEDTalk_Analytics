VI'm going to give you four specific examples,
p5
aVI'm going to cover at the end
p6
aVabout how a company called Silk tripled their sales;
p7
aVhow an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody
p8
aVto making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact;
p9
aVto how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect.
p10
aVAnd one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years \u2014
p11
aVa record label I started that had a CD called "Sauce."
p12
aa(lp13
VBefore I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread,
p14
aVand a guy named Otto Rohwedder.
p15
aVNow, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s
p16
aVI wonder what they said?
p17
aVLike the greatest invention since the telegraph or something.
p18
aVBut this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread,
p19
aVand he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.
p20
aVAnd the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this \u2014
p21
aVthat for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available
p22
aVno one bought it; no one knew about it;
p23
aVit was a complete and total failure.
p24
aVAnd the reason is that until Wonder came along
p25
aVand figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread,
p26
aVno one wanted it.
p27
aVThat the success of sliced bread,
p28
aVlike the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference,
p29
aVis not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like \u2014
p30
aVit's about can you get your idea to spread, or not.
p31
aVAnd I think that the way you're going to get what you want,
p32
aVor cause the change that you want to change, to happen,
p33
aVis to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop
p36
aVor you're an intellectual, or you're in business,
p37
aVor you're flying hot air balloons.
p38
aVI think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do.
p39
aVThat what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.
p40
aVThat people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win.
p41
aVWhen I talk about it I usually pick business,
p42
aVbecause they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation,
p43
aVand because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score.
p44
aVBut I want you to forgive me when I use these examples
p45
aVbecause I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do.
p46
aa(lp47
VAt the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV.
p48
aVTV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way.
p49
aVI call it the "TV-industrial complex."
p50
aVThe way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads,
p51
aVinterrupt some people, that gets you distribution.
p52
aVYou use the distribution you get to sell more products.
p53
aVYou take the profit from that to buy more ads.
p54
aVAnd it goes around and around and around,
p55
aVthe same way that the military-industrial complex worked a long time ago.
p56
aVThat model of, and we heard it yesterday \u2014
p57
aVif we could only get onto the homepage of Google,
p58
aVif we could only figure out how to get promoted there,
p59
aVor grab that person by the throat,
p60
aVand tell them about what we want to do.
p61
aVIf we did that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win.
p62
aVWell, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.
p63
aVI mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out
p64
aVhow to touch people in a way they weren't expecting,
p65
aVin a way they didn't necessarily want, with an ad,
p66
aVover and over again until they bought it.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex.
p69
aVThat just over the last few years,
p70
aVwhat anybody who markets anything has discovered
p71
aVis that it's not working the way that it used to.
p72
aVThis picture is really fuzzy, I apologize; I had a bad cold when I took it.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VBut the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child.
p77
aVI go to the deli; I'm sick; I need to buy some medicine.
p78
aVThe brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars
p79
aVtrying to interrupt me in one year.
p80
aV100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials
p81
aVand magazine ads and Spam
p82
aVand coupons and shelving allowances and spiff \u2014
p83
aVall so I could ignore every single message.
p84
aVAnd I ignored every message
p85
aVbecause I don't have a pain reliever problem.
p86
aVI buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have.
p87
aVAnd I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem,
p88
aVbecause I don't care.
p89
aa(lp90
VHere's a magazine called "Hydrate." It's 180 pages about water.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VArticles about water, ads about water.
p95
aVImagine what the world was like 40 years ago,
p96
aVwith just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek.
p97
aVNow there are magazines about water.
p98
aVNew product from Coke Japan: water salad.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VCoke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks,
p103
aVbecause they have no idea what's going to work and what's not.
p104
aVI couldn't have written this better myself.
p105
aVIt came out four days ago \u2014
p106
aVI circled the important parts so you can see them here.
p107
aVThey've come out...
p108
aVArby's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt
p109
aVwith the voice of Tom Arnold,
p110
aVhoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial
p115
aVfeaturing Tom Arnold, that would get you to get in your car,
p116
aVdrive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, this is Copernicus, and he was right,
p121
aVwhen he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.
p122
aV"The world revolves around me."
p123
aVMe, me, me, me. My favorite person \u2014 me.
p124
aVI don't want to get email from anybody; I want to get "memail."
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VSo consumers, and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway;
p129
aVI mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something,
p130
aVor people at, you know, the New Yorker who might print your article.
p131
aVConsumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care.
p132
aVPart of the reason is \u2014 they've got way more choices than they used to,
p133
aVand way less time.
p134
aVAnd in a world where we have too many choices and too little time,
p135
aVthe obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.
p136
aVAnd my parable here is you're driving down the road
p137
aVand you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before.
p138
aVCows are invisible. Cows are boring.
p139
aVWho's going to stop and pull over and say \u2014 "Oh, look, a cow."
p140
aVNobody.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VBut if the cow was purple \u2014 isn't that a great special effect?
p145
aVI could do that again if you want.
p146
aVIf the cow was purple, you'd notice it for a while.
p147
aVI mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too.
p148
aVThe thing that's going to decide what gets talked about,
p149
aVwhat gets done, what gets changed,
p150
aVwhat gets purchased, what gets built,
p151
aVis: "Is it remarkable?"
p152
aVAnd "remarkable" is a really cool word,
p153
aVbecause we think it just means "neat,"
p154
aVbut it also means "worth making a remark about."
p155
aVAnd that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going.
p156
aVThat two of the hottest cars in the United States
p157
aVis a 55,000-dollar giant car,
p158
aVbig enough to hold a Mini in its trunk.
p159
aVPeople are paying full price for both,
p160
aVand the only thing they have in common
p161
aVis that they don't have anything in common.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VEvery week, the number one best-selling DVD in America changes.
p166
aVIt's never "The Godfather," it's never "Citizen Kane,"
p167
aVit's always some third-rate movie with some second-rate star.
p168
aVBut the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out.
p169
aVBecause it's new, because it's fresh.
p170
aVPeople saw it and said "I didn't know that was there"
p171
aVand they noticed it.
p172
aVTwo of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail \u2014
p173
aVone sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box,
p174
aVand one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them.
p175
aVThe only thing they have in common is that they're different.
p176
aa(lp177
VWe're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living,
p178
aVwe're in the fashion business.
p179
aVAnd people in the fashion business
p180
aVknow what it's like to be in the fashion business \u2014 they're used to it.
p181
aVThe rest of us have to figure out how to think that way.
p182
aVHow to understand
p183
aVthat it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads,
p184
aVor insisting on meetings with people.
p185
aVBut it's a totally different sort of process
p186
aVthat determines which ideas spread, and which ones don't.
p187
aVThey sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs
p188
aVby reinventing what it meant to sell a chair.
p189
aVThey turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought,
p190
aVto something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work.
p191
aVThis guy, Lionel Poilâne, the most famous baker in the world \u2014
p192
aVhe died two and a half months ago,
p193
aVand he was a hero of mine and a dear friend.
p194
aVHe lived in Paris.
p195
aVLast year, he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread.
p196
aVEvery loaf baked in a bakery he owned,
p197
aVby one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.
p198
aVAnd when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it.
p199
aVThey didn't want to buy his bread.
p200
aVIt didn't look like "French bread."
p201
aVIt wasn't what they expected.
p202
aVIt was neat; it was remarkable;
p203
aVand slowly, it spread from one person to another person
p204
aVuntil finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.
p205
aVNow he's in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world.
p206
aa(lp207
VWhat marketers used to do is make average products for average people.
p208
aVThat's what mass marketing is.
p209
aVSmooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market.
p210
aVThey would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards.
p211
aVIt was all about going for the center.
p212
aVBut in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken,
p213
aVI don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more.
p214
aVI think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people
p215
aVbecause they're really good at ignoring you.
p216
aVBut market to these people because they care.
p217
aVThese are the people who are obsessed with something.
p218
aVAnd when you talk to them, they'll listen,
p219
aVbecause they like listening \u2014 it's about them.
p220
aVAnd if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve,
p221
aVand it'll spread.
p222
aVIt'll spread to the entire curve.
p223
aa(lp224
VThey have something I call "otaku" \u2014 it's a great Japanese word.
p225
aVIt describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say,
p226
aVdrive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place,
p227
aVbecause that's what they do: they get obsessed with it.
p228
aVTo make a product, to market an idea,
p229
aVto come up with any problem you want to solve
p230
aVthat doesn't have a constituency with an otaku,
p231
aVis almost impossible.
p232
aVInstead, you have to find a group that really, desperately cares
p233
aVabout what it is you have to say.
p234
aVTalk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.
p235
aVThere's a hot sauce otaku, but there's no mustard otaku.
p236
aVThat's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces,
p237
aVand not so many kinds of mustard.
p238
aVNot because it's hard to make interesting mustard \u2014
p239
aVyou could make interesting mustard \u2014
p240
aVbut people don't, because no one's obsessed with it,
p241
aVand thus no one tells their friends.
p242
aVKrispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out.
p243
aVIt has a strategy, and what they do is,
p244
aVthey enter a city, they talk to the people, with the otaku,
p245
aVand then they spread through the city
p246
aVto the people who've just crossed the street.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes.
p249
aVNot everybody wants it but they don't care.
p250
aVThey want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread.
p251
aVThese guys make the loudest car stereo in the world.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VIt's as loud as a 747 jet.
p256
aa(lp257
VYou can't get in, the car's got bulletproof glass,
p258
aVbecause it'll blow out the windshield otherwise.
p259
aVBut the fact remains
p260
aVthat when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car,
p261
aVif they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does,
p262
aVthey go ahead and they pick this.
p263
aa(lp264
VIt's really simple \u2014 you sell to the people who are listening,
p265
aVand just maybe, those people tell their friends.
p266
aVSo when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote,
p267
aVwho are all tuned in from 130 countries
p268
aVwatching his two-hour commercial \u2014
p269
aVthat's the only thing keeping his company in business \u2014
p270
aVit's that those 50,000 people care desperately enough
p271
aVto watch a two-hour commercial, and then tell their friends.
p272
aVPearl Jam, 96 albums released in the last two years.
p273
aVEvery one made a profit. How?
p274
aVThey only sell them on their website.
p275
aVThose people who buy them have the otaku,
p276
aVand then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.
p277
aVThis hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard.
p278
aVBut hospitals are buying it faster than any other model.
p279
aVHard Candy nail polish, doesn't appeal to everybody,
p280
aVbut to the people who love it, they talk about it like crazy.
p281
aVThis paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company,
p282
aVmaking them a fortune.
p283
aVIt costs 35 percent more than regular paint
p284
aVbecause Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable.
p285
aVThey didn't just slap a new ad on the product;
p286
aVthey changed what it meant to build a paint product.
p287
aVAmIhotornot.com \u2014 everyday 250,000 people go to this site,
p288
aVrun by two volunteers, and I can tell you they are hard graders \u2014
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VThey didn't get this way by advertising a lot.
p293
aVThey got this way by being remarkable,
p294
aVsometimes a little too remarkable.
p295
aVAnd this picture frame has a cord going out the back,
p296
aVand you plug it into the wall.
p297
aVMy father has this on his desk,
p298
aVand he sees his grandchildren everyday, changing constantly.
p299
aVAnd every single person who walks into his office
p300
aVhears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk.
p301
aVAnd one person at a time, the idea spreads.
p302
aVThese are not diamonds, not really.
p303
aVThey're made from "cremains."
p304
aVAfter you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VOh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VFastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry.
p313
aVBut you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne \u2014
p314
aVyou don't have to be super-outrageous to do this.
p315
aVWhat you have to do
p316
aVis figure out what people really want and give it to them.
p317
aa(lp318
VA couple of quick rules to wrap up.
p319
aVThe first one is: Design is free when you get to scale.
p320
aVThe people who come up with stuff that's remarkable
p321
aVmore often than not figure out how to put design to work for them.
p322
aVNumber two: The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe.
p323
aVProctor and Gamble knows this, right?
p324
aVThe whole model of being Proctor and Gamble
p325
aVis always about average products for average people.
p326
aVThat's risky.
p327
aVThe safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes,
p328
aVbe remarkable.
p329
aVAnd being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do.
p330
aVVery good is boring. Very good is average.
p331
aVIt doesn't matter whether you're making a record album,
p332
aVor you're an architect, or you have a tract on sociology.
p333
aVIf it's very good, it's not going to work, because no one's going to notice it.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo my three stories.
p336
aVSilk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section
p337
aVnext to the milk in the refrigerated section.
p338
aVSales tripled. Why?
p339
aVMilk, milk, milk, milk, milk \u2014 not milk.
p340
aVFor the people who were there and looking at that section,
p341
aVit was remarkable.
p342
aVThey didn't triple their sales with advertising;
p343
aVthey tripled it by doing something remarkable.
p344
aVThat is a remarkable piece of art.
p345
aVYou don't have to like it,
p346
aVbut a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City
p347
aVis remarkable.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
VFrank Gehry didn't just change a museum;
p352
aVhe changed an entire city's economy
p353
aVby designing one building that people from all over the world went to see.
p354
aVNow, at countless meetings at, you know,
p355
aVthe Portland City Council, or who knows where,
p356
aVthey said, we need an architect \u2014 can we get Frank Gehry?
p357
aVBecause he did something that was at the fringes.
p358
aVAnd my big failure? I came out with an entire \u2014
p359
aa(lp360
V(Music)
p361
aa(lp362
VA record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums
p363
aVin SACD, this remarkable new format \u2014
p364
aVand I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos.
p365
aVPeople with 20,000-dollar stereos don't like new music.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Laughter)
p368
aa(lp369
VSo what you need to do is figure out who does care.
p370
aVWho is going to raise their hand and say,
p371
aV"I want to hear what you're doing next,"
p372
aVand sell something to them.
p373
aVThe last example I want to give you.
p374
aVThis is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.
p375
aVAs you can see, if that's nowhere, it's in the middle of it.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VBut they do have a lake.
p380
aVAnd people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake.
p381
aVThey don't anymore.
p382
aVSo the founding fathers said, "We've got some money to spend.
p383
aVWhat can we build here?"
p384
aVAnd like most committees,
p385
aVthey were going to build something pretty safe.
p386
aVAnd then an artist came to them \u2014 this is a true artist's rendering \u2014
p387
aVhe wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town.
p388
aVThat's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing.
p389
aVI don't know about you,
p390
aVbut if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.
p391
aa(lp392
VThank you very much for your attention.

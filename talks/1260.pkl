VWhat is it about flying cars?
p5
aVWe've wanted to do this for about a hundred years.
p6
aVAnd there are historic attempts
p7
aVthat have had some level of technical success.
p8
aVBut we haven't yet gotten to the point
p9
aVwhere on your way here this morning
p10
aVyou see something that really, truly seamlessly integrates
p11
aVthe two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in
p12
aVwith the three-dimensional sky above us \u2014
p13
aVthat, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe looked at the historical attempts that had been out there
p16
aVand realized that, despite the fact
p17
aVthat we have a lot of modern innovations
p18
aVto draw on today
p19
aVthat weren't available previously \u2014
p20
aVwe have modern composite materials,
p21
aVwe have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy
p22
aVand have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available,
p23
aVwe have glass cockpit avionics
p24
aVthat bring the information you need to fly
p25
aVdirectly to you in the cockpit \u2014
p26
aVbut without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective,
p27
aVwe realized that we were going to be getting
p28
aVthe same result that people had been getting
p29
aVfor the last hundred years,
p30
aVwhich isn't where we want to be right now.
p31
aVSo instead of trying to make a car that can fly,
p32
aVwe decided to try to make a plane that could drive.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd the result is the Terrafugia Transition.
p35
aVIt's a two-seat, single-engine airplane
p36
aVthat works just like any other small airplane.
p37
aVYou take off and land at a local airport.
p38
aVThen once you're on the ground,
p39
aVyou fold up the wings, drive it home,
p40
aVpark it in your garage.
p41
aVAnd it works.
p42
aVAfter two years of an innovative design and construction process,
p43
aVthe proof of concept made its public debut
p44
aVin 2008.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow like with anything
p47
aVthat's really different from the status quo,
p48
aVit didn't always go so well testing that aircraft.
p49
aVAnd we discovered that it's a very good thing
p50
aVthat, when you go home with something that's been broken,
p51
aVyou've actually learned a lot more
p52
aVthan when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives
p53
aVthe first time through.
p54
aVStill, we very much wanted to see
p55
aVthe aircraft that we'd all helped build
p56
aVin the air, off the ground,
p57
aVlike it was supposed to be.
p58
aVAnd on our third high-speed testing deployment
p59
aVon a bitter cold morning in upstate New York,
p60
aVwe got to do that for the first time.
p61
aVThe picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft
p62
aVjust moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time.
p63
aVAnd we were all very flattered to see that image
p64
aVbecome a symbol of accomplishing something
p65
aVthat people had thought was impossible
p66
aVreally the world over.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe flight testing that followed that
p69
aVwas as basic and low-risk as we could make it,
p70
aVbut it still accomplished what we needed to
p71
aVto take the program to the next step
p72
aVand to gain the credibility that we needed
p73
aVwithin our eventual market, the general aviation community,
p74
aVand with the regulators
p75
aVthat govern the use of design of aircraft, particularly in the States.
p76
aVThe FAA, about a year ago,
p77
aVgave us an exemption for the Transition
p78
aVto allow us to have an additional 110 lbs.
p79
aVwithin the light sport aircraft category.
p80
aVNow that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's very important,
p81
aVbecause being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft
p82
aVmakes it simpler for us to certify it,
p83
aVbut it also makes it much easier
p84
aVfor you to learn how to fly it.
p85
aVA sport pilot can be certificated
p86
aVin as little as 20 hours of flight time.
p87
aVAnd at 110 lbs.,
p88
aVthat's very important for solving the other side of the equation \u2014
p89
aVdriving.
p90
aa(lp91
VIt turns out that driving,
p92
aVwith its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles,
p93
aVis actually a harder problem to solve than flying.
p94
aVFor those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground,
p95
aVthis may be counter-intuitive,
p96
aVbut driving has potholes, cobblestones,
p97
aVpedestrians, other drivers
p98
aVand a rather long and detailed list
p99
aVof federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.
p100
aVFortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention,
p101
aVand a lot of the design work
p102
aVthat we're the most proud of with the aircraft
p103
aVcame out of solving the unique problems
p104
aVof operating it on the ground \u2014
p105
aVeverything from a continuously-variable transmission
p106
aVand liquid-based cooling system
p107
aVthat allows us to use an aircraft engine
p108
aVin stop-and-go traffic,
p109
aVto a custom-designed gearbox
p110
aVthat powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground,
p111
aVto the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment,
p112
aVto crash safety features.
p113
aVWe have a carbon fiber safety cage
p114
aVthat protects the occupants
p115
aVfor less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow this also, as good as it is, wasn't quite enough.
p118
aVThe regulations for vehicles on the road
p119
aVweren't written with an airplane in mind.
p120
aVSo we did need a little bit of support
p121
aVfrom the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
p122
aVNow you may have seen in the news recently,
p123
aVthey came through with us at the end of last month
p124
aVwith a few special exemptions
p125
aVthat will allow the Transition to be sold
p126
aVin the same category as SUVs and light trucks.
p127
aVAs a multi-purpose passenger vehicle,
p128
aVit is now officially "designed for occasional off-road use."
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VNow let's see it in action.
p133
aVYou can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane.
p134
aVYou're not powering the propeller, you're powering the wheels.
p135
aVAnd it is under seven feet tall,
p136
aVso it will fit in a standard construction garage.
p137
aVAnd that's the automated wing-folding mechanism.
p138
aVThat's real time.
p139
aVYou just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out.
p140
aVOnce they're fully deployed,
p141
aVthere's a mechanical lock that goes into place,
p142
aVagain, from inside the cockpit.
p143
aVAnd they're now fully capable of handling
p144
aVany of the loads you would see in flight \u2014
p145
aVjust like putting down your convertible top.
p146
aVAnd you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Video) Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies,
p149
aV75 percent of your risk is that first flight.
p150
aa(lp151
VRadio: It actually flew. Yes.
p152
aa(lp153
VRadio 2: That was gorgeous.
p154
aa(lp155
VRadio: What did you think of that?
p156
aVThat was beautiful from up here, I tell you.
p157
aa(lp158
VAMD: See, we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop.
p159
aVAnd our test pilot gave us
p160
aVthe best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight,
p161
aVwhich was that it was "remarkably unremarkable."
p162
aVHe would go onto tell us
p163
aVthat the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land
p164
aVthat he'd flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot.
p165
aVSo despite making something
p166
aVthat is seemingly revolutionary,
p167
aVwe really focused on doing
p168
aVas little new as possible.
p169
aVWe leverage a lot of technology from the state-of-the-art in general aviation
p170
aVand from automotive racing.
p171
aVWhen we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box,
p172
aVwe use an incremental design, build, test, redesign cycle
p173
aVthat lets us reduce risk in baby steps.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow since we started Terrafugia about 6 years ago,
p176
aVwe've had a lot of those baby steps.
p177
aVWe've gone from being three of us
p178
aVworking in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school
p179
aVto about two-dozen of us
p180
aVworking in an initial production facility outside of Boston.
p181
aVWe've had to overcome challenges
p182
aVlike keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about,
p183
aVfiguring out how to politely respond
p184
aVwhen a regulator tells you,
p185
aV"But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended \u2014
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVto all of the other associated durability and engineering issues
p188
aVthat we talked about on the ground.
p189
aVStill, if everything goes to our satisfaction
p190
aVwith the testing and construction
p191
aVof the two production prototypes
p192
aVthat we're working on right now,
p193
aVthose first deliveries
p194
aVto the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this point
p195
aVshould begin at the end of next year.
p196
aa(lp197
VThe Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes.
p198
aVAnd I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy,
p199
aVbut I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane.
p200
aVHere's why.
p201
aVWhile nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world
p202
aVgoes through a relatively small number of large hub airports,
p203
aVthere is a huge underutilized resource out there.
p204
aVThere are thousands of local airstrips
p205
aVthat don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could.
p206
aVOn average, there's one within 20 to 30 miles
p207
aVof wherever you are in the United States.
p208
aVThe Transition gives you
p209
aVa safer, more convenient and more fun way
p210
aVof using this resource.
p211
aa(lp212
VFor those of you who aren't yet pilots,
p213
aVthere's four main reasons why those of us who are
p214
aVdon't fly as much as we'd like to:
p215
aVthe weather, primarily,
p216
aVcost, long door-to-door travel time
p217
aVand mobility at your destination.
p218
aVNow, bad weather comes in,
p219
aVjust land, fold up the wings, drive home.
p220
aVDoesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.
p221
aVInstead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger,
p222
aVpark it in your garage.
p223
aVAnd the unleaded automotive fuel that we use
p224
aVis both cheaper and better for the environment
p225
aVthan traditional avgas.
p226
aVDoor-to-door travel time is reduced,
p227
aVbecause now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space,
p228
aVtaking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger,
p229
aVyou're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go.
p230
aVAnd mobility to your destination is clearly solved.
p231
aVJust fold up the wings and keep going.
p232
aa(lp233
VThe Transition simultaneously expands our horizons
p234
aVwhile making the world a smaller, more accessible place.
p235
aVIt also continues to be a fabulous adventure.
p236
aVI hope you'll each take a moment
p237
aVto think about how you could use something like this
p238
aVto give yourself more access to your own world,
p239
aVand to make your own travel more convenient and more fun.
p240
aa(lp241
VThank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you.

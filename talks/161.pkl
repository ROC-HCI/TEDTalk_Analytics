VNow, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
p5
aVYou know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.
p6
aVHow about this word?
p7
aVHere, I'll show it to you.
p8
aVLexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.
p9
aVNotice \u2014 we're very specific \u2014 that word "compile."
p10
aVThe dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,
p11
aVout of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.
p12
aVIt's little discrete \u2014
p13
aVthat's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E \u2014 bits.
p14
aVAnd those bits are words.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow one of the perks of being a lexicographer \u2014
p17
aVbesides getting to come to TED \u2014 is that you get to say really fun words,
p18
aVlike lexicographical.
p19
aVLexicographical has this great pattern:
p20
aVit's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,
p21
aVI've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause)
p22
aVBut "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."
p23
aVRight? It's a fun word to say,
p24
aVand I get to say it a lot.
p25
aVNow, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer
p26
aVis that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.
p27
aVRight? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
p28
aVBut what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.
p29
aVJust to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.
p30
aVBut people think that my job is to let the good words
p31
aVmake that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,
p32
aVand keep the bad words out.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.
p35
aVFor one thing, I just do not do uniforms.
p36
aVAnd for another, deciding what words are good
p37
aVand what words are bad is actually not very easy.
p38
aVAnd it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,
p39
aVyou kind of look for an excuse not to do them.
p40
aVSo if I had to think of some kind of occupation
p41
aVas a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.
p42
aVI want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English
p43
aVand see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.
p44
aVBut why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?
p45
aVWell, I blame the Queen.
p46
aVWhy do I blame the Queen?
p47
aVWell, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.
p48
aVBut secondly, I blame the Queen because
p49
aVdictionaries have really not changed.
p50
aa(lp51
VOur idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.
p52
aVThe only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries
p53
aVis our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened
p54
aVin American dictionaries since 1965.
p55
aVSo, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
p56
aVJames Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
p57
aVI do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.
p58
aVSo he's really responsible for a lot of
p59
aVwhat we consider modern in dictionaries today.
p60
aVWhen a guy who looks like that, in that hat,
p61
aVis the face of modernity, you have a problem.
p62
aVAnd so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.
p63
aVThere'd be virtually no learning curve.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!
p66
aVComputers! What about computers?
p67
aVThe thing about computers is, I love computers.
p68
aVI mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
p69
aVI would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.
p70
aVBut computers don't do much else other than
p71
aVspeed up the process of compiling dictionaries.
p72
aVThey don't change the end result.
p73
aVBecause what a dictionary is,
p74
aVis it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
p75
aVIt's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.
p76
aVYou know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!
p77
aVThe design has not changed.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd OK, what about online dictionaries, right?
p80
aVOnline dictionaries must be different.
p81
aVThis is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.
p82
aVThis is my favorite word, by the way.
p83
aVErinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.
p84
aVVery useful word. So, look at that.
p85
aVOnline dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.
p86
aVThis is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!
p87
aVRight? Those little buttons,
p88
aVI had them all expanded except for the date chart.
p89
aVSo there's not very much going on here.
p90
aVThere's not a lot of clickiness.
p91
aVAnd in fact, online dictionaries replicate
p92
aValmost all the problems of print, except for searchability.
p93
aVAnd when you improve searchability,
p94
aVyou actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.
p95
aVSerendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,
p96
aVbecause finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014 now, when you think about this,
p99
aVwhat we have here is a ham butt problem.
p100
aVDoes everyone know the ham butt problem?
p101
aVWoman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
p102
aVShe goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,
p103
aVand she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,
p104
aV"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"
p105
aVShe thought, "Well, my mom always did this."
p106
aVSo she calls up mom, and she says,
p107
aV"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"
p108
aVShe says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"
p109
aVSo they call grandma, and grandma says,
p110
aV"My pan was too small!" (Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo, it's not that we have good words and bad words.
p113
aVWe have a pan that's too small!
p114
aVYou know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.
p115
aVThe bad words \u2014 see, when people think about a place
p116
aVand they don't find a place on the map,
p117
aVthey think, "This map sucks!"
p118
aVWhen they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,
p119
aVthey're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."
p120
aVWhen they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,
p121
aV"This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.
p122
aVWhy are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?
p123
aVSo, you can't get a smaller ham.
p124
aVThe English language is as big as it is.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo, if you have a ham butt problem,
p127
aVand you're thinking about the ham butt problem,
p128
aVthe conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:
p129
aVpaper is the enemy of words.
p130
aVHow can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.
p131
aVSome of my best friends are books.
p132
aVBut the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.
p133
aVNow they're going to think "Oh, boy.
p134
aVPeople are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"
p135
aVNo. There will still be paper dictionaries.
p136
aVWhen we had cars \u2014 when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,
p137
aVwe didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.
p138
aVYou know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,
p139
aVbut it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
p140
aVThe book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape
p141
aVdictionaries come in. And it's not going to be
p142
aVthe prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint,
p145
aVartificial constraints lead to
p146
aVarbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.
p147
aVWhat if biologists could only study animals
p148
aVthat made people go, "Aww." Right?
p149
aVWhat if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,
p150
aVand only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?
p151
aVWe'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,
p152
aVand not very much about much else.
p153
aVAnd I think this is a problem.
p154
aVI think we should study all the words,
p155
aVbecause when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions
p156
aVfrom very humble parts.
p157
aVLexicography is really more about material science.
p158
aVWe are studying the tolerances of the materials
p159
aVthat you use to build the structure of your expression:
p160
aVyour speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,
p161
aV"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"
p162
aVThey think, "OK, if we think words are the tools
p163
aVthat we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,
p164
aVhow can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?
p165
aVHow can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"
p166
aVThey're just the right tools for the job.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"
p169
aVYou know, anybody who's read a children's book
p170
aVknows that love makes things real.
p171
aVIf you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
p172
aVBeing in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
p173
aVIt doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
p174
aVIf you love a word, it becomes real.
p175
aVSo if we're not worrying about directing traffic,
p176
aVif we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less
p177
aVabout control and more about description,
p178
aVthen we can think of the English language
p179
aVas being this beautiful mobile.
p180
aVAnd any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,
p181
aVis touched, any time you touch a word,
p182
aVyou use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,
p183
aVyou verb it, you make the mobile move.
p184
aVYou didn't break it. It's just in a new position,
p185
aVand that new position can be just as beautiful.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, if you're no longer a traffic cop \u2014
p188
aVthe problem with being a traffic cop is
p189
aVthere can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,
p190
aVor the cars get confused. Right?
p191
aVBut if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,
p192
aVbut maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.
p193
aVYou can ask for help!
p194
aVIf you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.
p195
aVLibrary of Congress: 17 million books,
p196
aVof which half are in English.
p197
aVIf only one out of every 10 of those books
p198
aVhad a word that's not in the dictionary in it,
p199
aVthat would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd I find an un-dictionaried word \u2014
p202
aVa word like "un-dictionaried," for example \u2014
p203
aVin almost every book I read. What about newspapers?
p204
aVNewspaper archive goes back to 1759,
p205
aV58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100
p206
aVof those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,
p207
aVit would be an entire other OED.
p208
aVThat's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.
p209
aVAnd I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs \u2014
p210
aVand I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week
p211
aVthan I do Newsweek or Time.
p212
aVThere's a lot going on there.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd I'm not even talking about polysemy,
p215
aVwhich is the greedy habit some words have of taking
p216
aVmore than one meaning for themselves.
p217
aVSo if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow,
p218
aVa set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,
p219
aVand there's one numbered definition in the OED.
p220
aVThe OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.
p221
aVTiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.
p222
aVOne of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."
p223
aVDo you know what that says to me?
p224
aVThat says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter)
p225
aVThat's a lexicographical cop out,
p226
aVto say, "miscellaneous technical senses."
p227
aa(lp228
VSo, we have all these words, and we really need help!
p229
aVAnd the thing is, we could ask for help \u2014
p230
aVasking for help's not that hard.
p231
aVI mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
p232
aVSee, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,
p233
aVand this is more of a visual explanation.
p234
aVIf we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,
p235
aVthese bright spots are what we know about,
p236
aVand the dark spots are where we are in the dark.
p237
aVIf that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.
p238
aVAnd we don't even know the shape of the language.
p239
aVIf this was the dictionary \u2014 if this was the map of American English \u2014
p240
aVlook, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,
p241
aVbut there's no California!
p242
aVWe're missing California from American English.
p243
aVWe just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.
p244
aVWe don't even see that there's a gap on the map.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo again, lexicography is not rocket science.
p247
aVBut even if it were, rocket science is being done
p248
aVby dedicated amateurs these days. You know?
p249
aVIt can't be that hard to find some words!
p250
aVSo, enough scientists in other disciplines
p251
aVare really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.
p252
aVFor instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers
p253
aVcan upload information about their bird sightings.
p254
aVAnd then, ornithologists can go
p255
aVand help track populations, migrations, etc.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
p258
aVHe's a director of an electroplating company.
p259
aVHe's found more than 140 comets.
p260
aVHe's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.
p261
aVIt's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.
p262
aVI don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.
p263
aVBut he found 140 comets without a telescope.
p264
aVHe downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,
p265
aVand that's how he found them.
p266
aVIf we can find comets without a telescope,
p267
aVshouldn't we be able to find words?
p268
aa(lp269
VNow, y'all know where I'm going with this.
p270
aVBecause I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.
p271
aVAnd the Internet is great for collecting words,
p272
aVbecause the Internet's full of collectors.
p273
aVAnd this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,
p274
aVbut the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.
p275
aVAnd words and enthusiasm actually happen to be
p276
aVthe recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?
p277
aVSo there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,
p278
aVbut the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.
p279
aVThey show the word, but they don't show any context.
p280
aVWhere did it come from? Who said it?
p281
aVWhat newspaper was it in? What book?
p282
aa(lp283
VBecause a word is like an archaeological artifact.
p284
aVIf you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,
p285
aVit's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.
p286
aVSo a word without its source is like a cut flower.
p287
aVYou know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.
p288
aVIt dies too fast.
p289
aVSo, this whole time I've been saying,
p290
aV"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."
p291
aVNot "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because,
p292
aVwell, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
p293
aVThey use it synecdochically.
p294
aVAnd one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically"
p295
aVis that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."
p296
aVThis whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point
p297
aVwhere I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.
p298
aVSo I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something \u2014
p299
aVlike the dictionary is a part of the language,
p300
aVor a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country \u2014
p301
aVthen you're using it synecdochically.
p302
aVBut the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.
p303
aVIf we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.
p304
aVWe can put in all the meanings.
p305
aVDoesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
p306
aVAnd we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language \u2014
p307
aVwe can make it be the whole language.
p308
aa(lp309
VYou see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son,
p310
aVwho turns seven this month \u2014 I want him to barely remember
p311
aVthat this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.
p312
aVThis is what dictionaries used to look like.
p313
aVI want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.
p314
aVIt's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.
p315
aVIt wasn't really what people needed.
p316
aVAnd the thing is, if we can put in all the words,
p317
aVno longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,
p318
aVwe can really describe the language like scientists.
p319
aVWe can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.
p320
aVIf we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,
p321
aVand I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.
p322
aVThank you very much for your kind attention.

She searches high and low -- from books to blogs, newspapers to cocktail parties -- for new words, new meanings for old words, or signs that old words have fallen out of use. In June of this year, she involved us all in the search by launching <a href=\\"http://www.wordnik.com/\\">Wordnik</a>, an online dictionary that houses all the traditionally accepted words and definitions, but also asks users to contribute new words and new uses for old words.

VI have a question for you:
p5
aVAre you religious?
p6
aVPlease raise your hand right now
p7
aVif you think of yourself as a religious person.
p8
aVLet's see, I'd say about three or four percent.
p9
aVI had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVOkay, here's another question:
p12
aVDo you think of yourself as spiritual
p13
aVin any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.
p14
aVOkay, that's the majority.
p15
aa(lp16
VMy Talk today
p17
aVis about the main reason, or one of the main reasons,
p18
aVwhy most people consider themselves
p19
aVto be spiritual in some way, shape or form.
p20
aVMy Talk today is about self-transcendence.
p21
aVIt's just a basic fact about being human
p22
aVthat sometimes the self seems to just melt away.
p23
aVAnd when that happens,
p24
aVthe feeling is ecstatic
p25
aVand we reach for metaphors of up and down
p26
aVto explain these feelings.
p27
aVWe talk about being uplifted
p28
aVor elevated.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this
p31
aVwithout a good concrete metaphor.
p32
aVSo here's the metaphor I'm offering today.
p33
aVThink about the mind as being like a house with many rooms,
p34
aVmost of which we're very familiar with.
p35
aVBut sometimes it's as though a doorway appears
p36
aVfrom out of nowhere
p37
aVand it opens onto a staircase.
p38
aVWe climb the staircase
p39
aVand experience a state of altered consciousness.
p40
aa(lp41
VIn 1902,
p42
aVthe great American psychologist William James
p43
aVwrote about the many varieties of religious experience.
p44
aVHe collected all kinds of case studies.
p45
aVHe quoted the words of all kinds of people
p46
aVwho'd had a variety of these experiences.
p47
aVOne of the most exciting to me
p48
aVis this young man, Stephen Bradley,
p49
aVhad an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.
p50
aVAnd here's what Bradley said about it.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Music)
p53
aa(lp54
V(Video) Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape
p55
aVfor about one second in the room,
p56
aVwith arms extended,
p57
aVappearing to say to me, "Come."
p58
aVThe next day I rejoiced with trembling.
p59
aVMy happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.
p60
aVThis world had no place in my affections.
p61
aVPrevious to this time,
p62
aVI was very selfish and self-righteous.
p63
aVBut now I desired the welfare of all mankind
p64
aVand could, with a feeling heart,
p65
aVforgive my worst enemies.
p66
aa(lp67
VJH: So note
p68
aVhow Bradley's petty, moralistic self
p69
aVjust dies on the way up the staircase.
p70
aVAnd on this higher level
p71
aVhe becomes loving and forgiving.
p72
aVThe world's many religions have found so many ways
p73
aVto help people climb the staircase.
p74
aVSome shut down the self using meditation.
p75
aVOthers use psychedelic drugs.
p76
aVThis is from a 16th century Aztec scroll
p77
aVshowing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom
p78
aVand at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.
p79
aVOthers use dancing, spinning and circling
p80
aVto promote self-transcendence.
p81
aVBut you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase.
p82
aVLots of people find self-transcendence in nature.
p83
aVOthers overcome their self at raves.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut here's the weirdest place of all:
p86
aVwar.
p87
aVSo many books about war say the same thing,
p88
aVthat nothing brings people together
p89
aVlike war.
p90
aVAnd that bringing them together opens up the possibility
p91
aVof extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.
p92
aVI'm going to play for you an excerpt
p93
aVfrom this book by Glenn Gray.
p94
aVGray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.
p95
aVAnd after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers
p96
aVand wrote about the experience of men in battle.
p97
aVHere's a key passage
p98
aVwhere he basically describes the staircase.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Video) Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit
p101
aVthat the experience of communal effort in battle
p102
aVhas been the high point of their lives.
p103
aV"I" passes insensibly into a "we,"
p104
aV"my" becomes "our"
p105
aVand individual faith
p106
aVloses its central importance.
p107
aVI believe that it is nothing less
p108
aVthan the assurance of immortality
p109
aVthat makes self-sacrifice at these moments
p110
aVso relatively easy.
p111
aVI may fall, but I do not die,
p112
aVfor that which is real in me goes forward
p113
aVand lives on in the comrades
p114
aVfor whom I gave up my life.
p115
aa(lp116
VJH: So what all of these cases have in common
p117
aVis that the self seems to thin out, or melt away,
p118
aVand it feels good, it feels really good,
p119
aVin a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.
p120
aVIt feels somehow uplifting.
p121
aVThis idea that we move up was central in the writing
p122
aVof the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim.
p123
aVDurkheim even called us Homo duplex,
p124
aVor two-level man.
p125
aVThe lower level he called the level of the profane.
p126
aVNow profane is the opposite of sacred.
p127
aVIt just means ordinary or common.
p128
aVAnd in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.
p129
aVWe want to satisfy our individual desires.
p130
aVWe pursue our individual goals.
p131
aVBut sometimes something happens
p132
aVthat triggers a phase change.
p133
aVIndividuals unite
p134
aVinto a team, a movement or a nation,
p135
aVwhich is far more than the sum of its parts.
p136
aa(lp137
VDurkheim called this level the level of the sacred
p138
aVbecause he believed that the function of religion
p139
aVwas to unite people into a group,
p140
aVinto a moral community.
p141
aVDurkheim believed that anything that unites us
p142
aVtakes on an air of sacredness.
p143
aVAnd once people circle around
p144
aVsome sacred object or value,
p145
aVthey'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.
p146
aVDurkheim wrote
p147
aVabout a set of intense collective emotions
p148
aVthat accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum,
p149
aVof making a group out of individuals.
p150
aVThink of the collective joy in Britain
p151
aVon the day World War II ended.
p152
aVThink of the collective anger in Tahrir Square,
p153
aVwhich brought down a dictator.
p154
aVAnd think of the collective grief
p155
aVin the United States
p156
aVthat we all felt, that brought us all together,
p157
aVafter 9/11.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo let me summarize where we are.
p160
aVI'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence
p161
aVis just a basic part of being human.
p162
aVI'm offering the metaphor
p163
aVof a staircase in the mind.
p164
aVI'm saying we are Homo duplex
p165
aVand this staircase takes us up from the profane level
p166
aVto the level of the sacred.
p167
aVWhen we climb that staircase,
p168
aVself-interest fades away,
p169
aVwe become just much less self-interested,
p170
aVand we feel as though we are better, nobler
p171
aVand somehow uplifted.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo here's the million-dollar question
p174
aVfor social scientists like me:
p175
aVIs the staircase
p176
aVa feature of our evolutionary design?
p177
aVIs it a product of natural selection,
p178
aVlike our hands?
p179
aVOr is it a bug, a mistake in the system \u2014
p180
aVthis religious stuff is just something
p181
aVthat happens when the wires cross in the brain \u2014
p182
aVJill has a stroke and she has this religious experience,
p183
aVit's just a mistake?
p184
aa(lp185
VWell many scientists who study religion take this view.
p186
aVThe New Atheists, for example,
p187
aVargue that religion is a set of memes,
p188
aVsort of parasitic memes,
p189
aVthat get inside our minds
p190
aVand make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff,
p191
aVself-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.
p192
aVAnd after all,
p193
aVhow could it ever be good for us
p194
aVto lose ourselves?
p195
aVHow could it ever be adaptive
p196
aVfor any organism
p197
aVto overcome self-interest?
p198
aVWell let me show you.
p199
aa(lp200
VIn "The Descent of Man,"
p201
aVCharles Darwin wrote a great deal
p202
aVabout the evolution of morality \u2014
p203
aVwhere did it come from, why do we have it.
p204
aVDarwin noted that many of our virtues
p205
aVare of very little use to ourselves,
p206
aVbut they're of great use to our groups.
p207
aVHe wrote about the scenario
p208
aVin which two tribes of early humans
p209
aVwould have come in contact and competition.
p210
aVHe said, "If the one tribe included
p211
aVa great number of courageous, sympathetic
p212
aVand faithful members
p213
aVwho are always ready to aid and defend each other,
p214
aVthis tribe would succeed better
p215
aVand conquer the other."
p216
aVHe went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people
p217
aVwill not cohere,
p218
aVand without coherence
p219
aVnothing can be effected."
p220
aVIn other words,
p221
aVCharles Darwin believed
p222
aVin group selection.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years,
p225
aVbut it's about to make a major comeback this year,
p226
aVespecially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April,
p227
aVmaking a very strong case
p228
aVthat we, and several other species,
p229
aVare products of group selection.
p230
aVBut really the way to think about this
p231
aVis as multilevel selection.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo look at it this way:
p234
aVYou've got competition going on within groups and across groups.
p235
aVSo here's a group of guys on a college crew team.
p236
aVWithin this team
p237
aVthere's competition.
p238
aVThere are guys competing with each other.
p239
aVThe slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.
p240
aVAnd only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.
p241
aVMaybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.
p242
aVSo within the team,
p243
aVtheir interests are actually pitted against each other.
p244
aVAnd sometimes it would be advantageous
p245
aVfor one of these guys
p246
aVto try to sabotage the other guys.
p247
aVMaybe he'll badmouth his chief rival
p248
aVto the coach.
p249
aVBut while that competition is going on
p250
aVwithin the boat,
p251
aVthis competition is going on across boats.
p252
aVAnd once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat,
p253
aVnow they've got no choice but to cooperate
p254
aVbecause they're all in the same boat.
p255
aVThey can only win
p256
aVif they all pull together as a team.
p257
aVI mean, these things sound trite,
p258
aVbut they are deep evolutionary truths.
p259
aa(lp260
VThe main argument against group selection
p261
aVhas always been
p262
aVthat, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators,
p263
aVbut as soon as you have a group of cooperators,
p264
aVthey're just going to get taken over by free-riders,
p265
aVindividuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.
p266
aVLet me illustrate this for you.
p267
aVSuppose we've got a group of little organisms \u2014
p268
aVthey can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what \u2014
p269
aVand let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.
p270
aVWell that's great. They graze, they defend each other,
p271
aVthey work together, they generate wealth.
p272
aVAnd as you'll see in this simulation,
p273
aVas they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow,
p274
aVand when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split,
p275
aVand that's how they reproduce and the population grows.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut suppose then that one of them mutates.
p278
aVThere's a mutation in the gene
p279
aVand one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.
p280
aVIt takes advantage of the others.
p281
aVAnd so when a green interacts with a blue,
p282
aVyou'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.
p283
aVSo here's how things play out.
p284
aVWe start with just one green,
p285
aVand as it interacts
p286
aVit gains wealth or points or food.
p287
aVAnd in short order, the cooperators are done for.
p288
aVThe free-riders have taken over.
p289
aVIf a group cannot solve the free-rider problem
p290
aVthen it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation
p291
aVand group selection cannot get started.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
p294
aVIt's not that hard a problem.
p295
aVIn fact, nature has solved it many, many times.
p296
aVAnd nature's favorite solution
p297
aVis to put everyone in the same boat.
p298
aVFor example,
p299
aVwhy is it that the mitochondria in every cell
p300
aVhas its own DNA,
p301
aVtotally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?
p302
aVIt's because they used to be
p303
aVseparate free-living bacteria
p304
aVand they came together
p305
aVand became a superorganism.
p306
aVSomehow or other \u2014 maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why \u2014
p307
aVbut once they got a membrane around them,
p308
aVthey were all in the same membrane,
p309
aVnow all the wealth-created division of labor,
p310
aVall the greatness created by cooperation,
p311
aVstays locked inside the membrane
p312
aVand we've got a superorganism.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd now let's rerun the simulation
p315
aVputting one of these superorganisms
p316
aVinto a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters
p317
aVand look what happens.
p318
aVA superorganism can basically take what it wants.
p319
aVIt's so big and powerful and efficient
p320
aVthat it can take resources
p321
aVfrom the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.
p322
aVAnd pretty soon the whole population
p323
aVis actually composed of these new superorganisms.
p324
aVWhat I've shown you here
p325
aVis sometimes called a major transition
p326
aVin evolutionary history.
p327
aVDarwin's laws don't change,
p328
aVbut now there's a new kind of player on the field
p329
aVand things begin to look very different.
p330
aa(lp331
VNow this transition was not a one-time freak of nature
p332
aVthat just happened with some bacteria.
p333
aVIt happened again
p334
aVabout 120 or a 140 million years ago
p335
aVwhen some solitary wasps
p336
aVbegan creating little simple, primitive
p337
aVnests, or hives.
p338
aVOnce several wasps were all together in the same hive,
p339
aVthey had no choice but to cooperate,
p340
aVbecause pretty soon they were locked into competition
p341
aVwith other hives.
p342
aVAnd the most cohesive hives won,
p343
aVjust as Darwin said.
p344
aa(lp345
VThese early wasps
p346
aVgave rise to the bees and the ants
p347
aVthat have covered the world
p348
aVand changed the biosphere.
p349
aVAnd it happened again,
p350
aVeven more spectacularly,
p351
aVin the last half-million years
p352
aVwhen our own ancestors
p353
aVbecame cultural creatures,
p354
aVthey came together around a hearth or a campfire,
p355
aVthey divided labor,
p356
aVthey began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects,
p357
aVand eventually they worshiped their own gods.
p358
aVOnce they were all in the same tribe,
p359
aVthey could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.
p360
aVAnd they unlocked the most powerful force
p361
aVever known on this planet,
p362
aVwhich is human cooperation \u2014
p363
aVa force for construction
p364
aVand destruction.
p365
aa(lp366
VOf course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive
p367
aVas beehives.
p368
aVHuman groups may look like hives for brief moments,
p369
aVbut they tend to then break apart.
p370
aVWe're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.
p371
aVIn fact, often,
p372
aVas we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts,
p373
aVoften those divisions are along religious lines.
p374
aVNonetheless, when people do come together
p375
aVand put themselves all into the same movement,
p376
aVthey can move mountains.
p377
aa(lp378
VLook at the people in these photos I've been showing you.
p379
aVDo you think they're there
p380
aVpursuing their self-interest?
p381
aVOr are they pursuing communal interest,
p382
aVwhich requires them to lose themselves
p383
aVand become simply a part of a whole?
p384
aa(lp385
VOkay, so that was my Talk
p386
aVdelivered in the standard TED way.
p387
aVAnd now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again
p388
aVin three minutes
p389
aVin a more full-spectrum sort of way.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Music)
p392
aa(lp393
V(Video) Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties
p394
aVof religious experience,
p395
aVas William James explained.
p396
aVOne of the most common is climbing the secret staircase
p397
aVand losing ourselves.
p398
aVThe staircase takes us
p399
aVfrom the experience of life as profane or ordinary
p400
aVupwards to the experience of life as sacred,
p401
aVor deeply interconnected.
p402
aVWe are Homo duplex,
p403
aVas Durkheim explained.
p404
aVAnd we are Homo duplex
p405
aVbecause we evolved by multilevel selection,
p406
aVas Darwin explained.
p407
aVI can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation
p408
aVrather than a bug,
p409
aVbut if it is an adaptation,
p410
aVthen the implications are profound.
p411
aVIf it is an adaptation,
p412
aVthen we evolved to be religious.
p413
aa(lp414
VI don't mean that we evolved
p415
aVto join gigantic organized religions.
p416
aVThose things came along too recently.
p417
aVI mean that we evolved
p418
aVto see sacredness all around us
p419
aVand to join with others into teams
p420
aVand circle around sacred objects,
p421
aVpeople and ideas.
p422
aVThis is why politics is so tribal.
p423
aVPolitics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest,
p424
aVbut politics is also about sacredness.
p425
aVIt's about joining with others
p426
aVto pursue moral ideas.
p427
aVIt's about the eternal struggle between good and evil,
p428
aVand we all believe we're on the good team.
p429
aa(lp430
VAnd most importantly,
p431
aVif the staircase is real,
p432
aVit explains the persistent undercurrent
p433
aVof dissatisfaction in modern life.
p434
aVBecause human beings are, to some extent,
p435
aVhivish creatures like bees.
p436
aVWe're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.
p437
aVWe broke down the old institutions
p438
aVand brought liberty to the oppressed.
p439
aVWe unleashed Earth-changing creativity
p440
aVand generated vast wealth and comfort.
p441
aa(lp442
VNowadays we fly around
p443
aVlike individual bees exulting in our freedom.
p444
aVBut sometimes we wonder:
p445
aVIs this all there is?
p446
aVWhat should I do with my life?
p447
aVWhat's missing?
p448
aVWhat's missing is that we are Homo duplex,
p449
aVbut modern, secular society was built
p450
aVto satisfy our lower, profane selves.
p451
aVIt's really comfortable down here on the lower level.
p452
aVCome, have a seat in my home entertainment center.
p453
aa(lp454
VOne great challenge of modern life
p455
aVis to find the staircase amid all the clutter
p456
aVand then to do something good and noble
p457
aVonce you climb to the top.
p458
aVI see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.
p459
aVThey all want to find a cause or calling
p460
aVthat they can throw themselves into.
p461
aVThey're all searching for their staircase.
p462
aVAnd that gives me hope
p463
aVbecause people are not purely selfish.
p464
aa(lp465
VMost people long to overcome pettiness
p466
aVand become part of something larger.
p467
aVAnd this explains the extraordinary resonance
p468
aVof this simple metaphor
p469
aVconjured up nearly 400 years ago.
p470
aV"No man is an island
p471
aVentire of itself.
p472
aVEvery man is a piece of the continent,
p473
aVa part of the main."
p474
aa(lp475

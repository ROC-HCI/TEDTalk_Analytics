VTen years ago,
p5
aVI had my first exhibition here.
p6
aVI had no idea if it would work or was at all possible,
p7
aVbut with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve,
p8
aVI made my first sculpture, called "The Lost Correspondent."
p9
aVTeaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center,
p10
aVI submerged the work off the coast of Grenada,
p11
aVin an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.
p12
aVAnd then this incredible thing happened.
p13
aVIt transformed.
p14
aVOne sculpture became two.
p15
aVTwo quickly became 26.
p16
aVAnd before I knew it,
p17
aVwe had the world's first underwater sculpture park.
p18
aa(lp19
VIn 2009, I moved to Mexico and started by casting local fisherman.
p20
aVThis grew to a small community,
p21
aVto almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea.
p22
aVAnd then finally, to an underwater museum,
p23
aVwith over 500 living sculptures.
p24
aVGardening, it seems, is not just for greenhouses.
p25
aVWe've since scaled up the designs:
p26
aV"Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas, rising 16 feet up to the surface
p27
aVand weighing over 40 tons,
p28
aVto now currently in Lanzarote,
p29
aVwhere I'm making an underwater botanical garden,
p30
aVthe first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean.
p31
aa(lp32
VEach project, we use materials and designs that help encourage life;
p33
aVa long-lasting pH-neutral cement provides a stable and permanent platform.
p34
aVIt is textured to allow coral polyps to attach.
p35
aVWe position them down current from natural reefs
p36
aVso that after spawning, there's areas for them to settle.
p37
aVThe formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish
p38
aVon a really large scale.
p39
aVEven this VW Beetle has an internal living habitat
p40
aVto encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo why exhibit my work in the ocean?
p43
aVBecause honestly, it's really not easy.
p44
aVWhen you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred-foot crane,
p45
aVtrying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor,
p46
aVyou start to wonder whether I shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VBut in the end, the results always blow my mind.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Music)
p53
aa(lp54
VThe ocean is the most incredible exhibition space
p55
aVan artist could ever wish for.
p56
aVYou have amazing lighting effects changing by the hour,
p57
aVexplosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery,
p58
aVa unique timeless quality
p59
aVand the procession of inquisitive visitors,
p60
aVeach lending their own special touch to the site.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Music)
p63
aa(lp64
VBut over the years,
p65
aVI've realized that the greatest thing about what we do,
p66
aVthe really humbling thing about the work,
p67
aVis that as soon as we submerge the sculptures,
p68
aVthey're not ours anymore,
p69
aVbecause as soon as we sink them,
p70
aVthe sculptures, they belong to the sea.
p71
aVAs new reefs form, a new world literally starts to evolve,
p72
aVa world that continuously amazes me.
p73
aVIt's a bit of a cliché, but nothing man-made
p74
aVcan ever match the imagination of nature.
p75
aa(lp76
VSponges look like veins across the faces.
p77
aVStaghorn coral morphs the form.
p78
aVFireworms scrawl white lines as they feed.
p79
aVTunicates explode from the faces.
p80
aVSea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night.
p81
aVCoralline algae applies a kind of purple paint.
p82
aVThe deepest red I've ever seen in my life lives underwater.
p83
aVGorgonian fans oscillate with the waves.
p84
aVPurple sponges breathe water like air.
p85
aVAnd grey angelfish glide silently overhead.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd the amazing response we've had to these works
p88
aVtells me that we've managed to plug into something really primal,
p89
aVbecause it seems that these images translate across the world,
p90
aVand that's made me focus on my responsibility as an artist
p91
aVand about what I'm trying to achieve.
p92
aVI'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the ocean,
p93
aVand this couldn't be a better place
p94
aVto talk about the really, really important effect of my work.
p95
aVBecause as we all know,
p96
aVour reefs are dying, and our oceans are in trouble.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo here's the thing:
p99
aVthe most used, searched and shared image
p100
aVof all my work thus far is this.
p101
aVAnd I think this is for a reason,
p102
aVor at least I hope it is.
p103
aVWhat I really hope is that people are beginning to understand
p104
aVthat when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature,
p105
aVthat we need to start thinking about our oceans, too.
p106
aa(lp107
VSince building these sites, we've seen some phenomenal
p108
aVand unexpected results.
p109
aVBesides creating over 800 square meters of new habitats and living reef,
p110
aVvisitors to the marine park in Cancun now divide half their time
p111
aVbetween the museum and the natural reefs,
p112
aVproviding significant rest for natural, overstressed areas.
p113
aVVisitors to "Ocean Atlas" in the Bahamas highlighted a leak
p114
aVfrom a nearby oil refinery.
p115
aVThe subsequent international media forced the local government
p116
aVto pledge 10 million dollars in coastal cleanups.
p117
aVThe sculpture park in Grenada was instrumental
p118
aVin the government designating a spot \u2014 a marine-protected area.
p119
aVEntrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers
p120
aVto manage tourism and fishing quotas.
p121
aVThe site was actually listed as a "Wonder of the World"
p122
aVby National Geographic.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo why are we all here today in this room?
p125
aVWhat do we all have in common?
p126
aVI think we all share a fear
p127
aVthat we don't protect our oceans enough.
p128
aVAnd one way of thinking about this
p129
aVis that we don't regard our oceans as sacred,
p130
aVand we should.
p131
aVWhen we see incredible places \u2014
p132
aVlike the Himalayas or the La Sagrada Família,
p133
aVor the Mona Lisa, even \u2014
p134
aVwhen we see these incredible places and things,
p135
aVwe understand their importance.
p136
aVWe call them sacred,
p137
aVand we do our best to cherish them, to protect them
p138
aVand to keep them safe.
p139
aVBut in order to do that,
p140
aVwe are the ones that have to assign that value;
p141
aVotherwise, it will be desecrated
p142
aVby someone who doesn't understand that value.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo I want to finish up tonight by talking about sacred things.
p145
aVWhen we were naming the site in Cancun,
p146
aVwe named it a museum for a very important and simple reason:
p147
aVmuseums are places of preservation,
p148
aVof conservation and of education.
p149
aVThey're places where we keep objects of great value to us,
p150
aVwhere we simply treasure them for them being themselves.
p151
aVIf someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel,
p152
aVwe'd all go crazy.
p153
aVIf someone wanted to build a seven-star hotel
p154
aVat the bottom of the Grand Canyon,
p155
aVthen we would laugh them out of Arizona.
p156
aVYet every day we dredge, pollute and overfish our oceans.
p157
aVAnd I think it's easier for us to do that,
p158
aVbecause when we see the ocean,
p159
aVwe don't see the havoc we're wreaking.
p160
aVBecause for most people,
p161
aVthe ocean is like this.
p162
aVAnd it's really hard
p163
aVto think of something that's just so plain and so enormous, as fragile.
p164
aVIt's simply too massive, too vast, too endless.
p165
aVAnd what do you see here?
p166
aVI think most people actually look past to the horizon.
p167
aVSo I think there's a real danger
p168
aVthat we never really see the sea,
p169
aVand if we don't really see it,
p170
aVif it doesn't have its own iconography,
p171
aVif we miss its majesty,
p172
aVthen there's a big danger that we take it for granted.
p173
aa(lp174
VCancun is famous for spring break,
p175
aVtequila and foam parties.
p176
aVAnd its waters are where frat boys can ride around on Jet Skis
p177
aVand banana boats.
p178
aVBut because of our work there, there's now a little corner of Cancun
p179
aVthat is simply precious for being itself.
p180
aVAnd we don't want to stop in Grenada,
p181
aVin Cancun or the Bahamas.
p182
aVJust last month, I installed these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
p183
aVin the Thames River,
p184
aVin central London, right in front of the Houses of Parliament,
p185
aVputting a stark message about climate change
p186
aVin front of the people that have the power to help change things.
p187
aa(lp188
VBecause for me, this is just the beginning of the mission.
p189
aVWe want to team up with other inventors,
p190
aVcreators, philanthropists, educators, biologists,
p191
aVto see better futures for our oceans.
p192
aVAnd we want to see beyond sculpture,
p193
aVbeyond art, even.
p194
aa(lp195
VSay you're a 14-year-old kid from the city,
p196
aVand you've never seen the ocean.
p197
aVAnd instead of getting taken to the natural history museum
p198
aVor an aquarium,
p199
aVyou get taken out to the ocean,
p200
aVto an underwater Noah's Ark,
p201
aVwhich you can access through a dry-glass viewing tunnel,
p202
aVwhere you can see all the wildlife of the land
p203
aVbe colonized by the wildlife of the ocean.
p204
aVClearly, it would blow your mind.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo let's think big and let's think deep.
p207
aVWho knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us?
p208
aVI hope that by bringing our art into the ocean,
p209
aVthat not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity
p210
aVand visual impact of the setting,
p211
aVbut that we are also giving something back,
p212
aVand by encouraging new environments to thrive,
p213
aVand in some way opening up a new \u2014 or maybe it's a really old way
p214
aVof seeing the seas:
p215
aVas delicate, precious places,
p216
aVworthy of our protection.
p217
aa(lp218
VOur oceans are sacred.
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you.

Educated in the South East of England, Taylor graduated from the London Institute of Arts in 1998 with a BA Honours in Sculpture and went on to become a fully qualified diving instructor and underwater naturalist. With over 20 years diving experience under his belt, Taylor is also an award winning underwater photographer, famous for his dramatic images, which capture the metamorphosing effects of the ocean on his evolving sculptures.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">In 2006, Taylor founded and created the world&rsquo;s first underwater sculpture park. Situated off the west coast of Grenada in the West Indies, it is now listed as one of the Top 25 Wonders of the World by National Geographic and was instrumental in the creation of a national marine protected area by the local government. In 2009, he co-founded MUSA (Museo Subacu&aacute;tico de Arte), a monumental museum with a collection of over 500 of his sculptural works, submerged off the coast of Cancun, Mexico. Both of these ambitious, permanent public works have a practical, functional aspect, facilitating positive interactions between people and fragile underwater habitats while at the same relieving pressure on natural resources.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Taylor&#39;s pioneering public art projects are not only examples of successful marine conservation but also works of art that seek to encourage environmental awareness, instigate social change and lead us to appreciate the breathtaking natural beauty of the underwater world.

class=\\"p1\\">Born in 1974 to an English father and Guyanese mother, Taylor grew up in Europe and Asia, where he spent much of his early childhood exploring the coral reefs of Malaysia. Educated in the South East of England, Taylor graduated from the London Institute of Arts in 1998 with a BA Honours in Sculpture and went on to become a fully qualified diving instructor and underwater naturalist. With over 20 years diving experience under his belt, Taylor is also an award winning underwater photographer, famous for his dramatic images, which capture the metamorphosing effects of the ocean on his evolving sculptures.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">In 2006, Taylor founded and created the world&rsquo;s first underwater sculpture park. Situated off the west coast of Grenada in the West Indies, it is now listed as one of the Top 25 Wonders of the World by National Geographic and was instrumental in the creation of a national marine protected area by the local government. In 2009, he co-founded MUSA (Museo Subacu&aacute;tico de Arte), a monumental museum with a collection of over 500 of his sculptural works, submerged off the coast of Cancun, Mexico. Both of these ambitious, permanent public works have a practical, functional aspect, facilitating positive interactions between people and fragile underwater habitats while at the same relieving pressure on natural resources.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Taylor&#39;s pioneering public art projects are not only examples of successful marine conservation but also works of art that seek to encourage environmental awareness, instigate social change and lead us to appreciate the breathtaking natural beauty of the underwater world. He is currently based in Lanzarote part of the Canary Islands where he is working on a major new underwater museum for the Atlantic Ocean.</p>", "slug": "jason_decaires_taylor", "whotheyare": "Jason deCaires Taylor\'s underwater installations offer views of another world, where the artistic efforts of man meet the vivifying power of nature.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 2682, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/7e02393de53dfd77403e733fa738ab1556c7a9ef_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "An underwater art museum, teeming with life", "take_action": [], "comments": 27014, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "publisher": "Chronicle Books", "start_at": null, "author": "Jason deCaires Taylor, Carlo McCormick, Helen Scales", "headline": "*The Underwater Museum: The Submerged Sculptures of Jason deCaires Taylor*", "link_url": "http://www.amazon.com/The-Underwater-Museum-Submerged-Sculptures/dp/1452118876/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20", "published": true, "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "http://tedcdnpe-a.akamaihd.net/images/ted/49fcc94d54e6ca7a04255fc8b989b04d717b3548_400x428.jpg", "year": "2014", "type": "book", "blurb": null}, {"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "The sculpture gallery at the bottom of the sea", "link_url": "http://ideas.ted.com/the-sculpture-gallery-at-the-bottom-of-the-sea/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "https://tedideas.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/3_silent_evolution_jason-decaires-taylor_sculpture.jpg", "published": true, "visible_url": "ideas.ted.com", "type": "from_the_blog", "blurb": "Jason deCaires Taylor\'s art is half sculpted by him, half crafted by the ocean.

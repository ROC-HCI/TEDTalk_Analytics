VPhilosophers, dramatists, theologians
p5
aVhave grappled with this question for centuries:
p6
aVwhat makes people go wrong?
p7
aVInterestingly, I asked this question when I was a little kid.
p8
aVI grew up in the South Bronx, inner-city ghetto in New York,
p9
aVand I was surrounded by evil,
p10
aVas all kids are who grew up in an inner city.
p11
aVAnd I had friends who were really good kids,
p12
aVwho lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario \u2014 Robert Louis Stevenson.
p13
aVThat is, they took drugs, got in trouble, went to jail.
p14
aVSome got killed, and some did it without drug assistance.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that wasn't fiction.
p17
aVThe only question is, what was in the juice?
p18
aVAnd more importantly, that line between good and evil \u2014
p19
aVwhich privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable,
p20
aVwith them on the good side, the others on the bad side \u2014
p21
aVI knew that line was movable, and it was permeable.
p22
aVGood people could be seduced across that line,
p23
aVand under good and some rare circumstances, bad kids could recover
p24
aVwith help, with reform, with rehabilitation.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo I want to begin with this wonderful illusion
p27
aVby [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.
p28
aVIf you look at it and focus on the white, what you see is a world full of angels.
p29
aVBut let's look more deeply, and as we do,
p30
aVwhat appears is the demons, the devils in the world.
p31
aVThat tells us several things.
p32
aa(lp33
VOne, the world is, was, will always be filled with good and evil,
p34
aVbecause good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition.
p35
aVIt tells me something else.
p36
aVIf you remember, God's favorite angel was Lucifer.
p37
aVApparently, Lucifer means "the light."
p38
aVIt also means "the morning star," in some scripture.
p39
aVAnd apparently, he disobeyed God,
p40
aVand that's the ultimate disobedience to authority.
p41
aVAnd when he did, Michael, the archangel, was sent to kick him out of heaven
p42
aValong with the other fallen angels.
p43
aVAnd so Lucifer descends into hell, becomes Satan,
p44
aVbecomes the devil, and the force of evil in the universe begins.
p45
aa(lp46
VParadoxically, it was God who created hell as a place to store evil.
p47
aVHe didn't do a good job of keeping it there though.
p48
aVSo, this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil,
p49
aVfor me, sets the context for understanding human beings
p50
aVwho are transformed from good, ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo the Lucifer effect, although it focuses on the negatives \u2014
p53
aVthe negatives that people can become,
p54
aVnot the negatives that people are \u2014
p55
aVleads me to a psychological definition.
p56
aVEvil is the exercise of power.
p57
aVAnd that's the key: it's about power.
p58
aVTo intentionally harm people psychologically,
p59
aVto hurt people physically, to destroy people mortally, or ideas,
p60
aVand to commit crimes against humanity.
p61
aVIf you Google "evil," a word that should surely have withered by now,
p62
aVyou come up with 136 million hits in a third of a second.
p63
aa(lp64
VA few years ago \u2014 I am sure all of you were shocked, as I was,
p65
aVwith the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place
p66
aVin a controversial war, Abu Ghraib in Iraq.
p67
aVAnd these were men and women
p68
aVwho were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation.
p69
aVI was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,
p70
aVbecause I had seen those same visual parallels
p71
aVwhen I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study.
p72
aa(lp73
VImmediately the Bush administration military said what?
p74
aVWhat all administrations say when there's a scandal:
p75
aV"Don't blame us. It's not the system.
p76
aVIt's the few bad apples, the few rogue soldiers."
p77
aVMy hypothesis is, American soldiers are good, usually.
p78
aVMaybe it was the barrel that was bad.
p79
aVBut how am I going to deal with that hypothesis?
p80
aa(lp81
VI became an expert witness for one of the guards,
p82
aVSergeant Chip Frederick, and in that position,
p83
aVI had access to the dozen investigative reports.
p84
aVI had access to him.
p85
aVI could study him, have him come to my home, get to know him,
p86
aVdo psychological analysis to see, was he a good apple or bad apple.
p87
aVAnd thirdly, I had access to all of the 1,000 pictures
p88
aVthat these soldiers took.
p89
aVThese pictures are of a violent or sexual nature.
p90
aVAll of them come from the cameras of American soldiers.
p91
aVBecause everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera,
p92
aVthey took pictures of everything, more than 1,000.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd what I've done is I organized them into various categories.
p95
aVBut these are by United States military police, army reservists.
p96
aVThey are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all.
p97
aVAnd it all happened in a single place, Tier 1-A, on the night shift.
p98
aVWhy?
p99
aVTier 1-A was the center for military intelligence.
p100
aVIt was the interrogation hold.
p101
aVThe CIA was there.
p102
aVInterrogators from Titan Corporation, all there,
p103
aVand they're getting no information about the insurgency.
p104
aVSo they're going to put pressure on these soldiers,
p105
aVmilitary police, to cross the line,
p106
aVgive them permission to break the will of the enemy,
p107
aVto prepare them for interrogation, to soften them up,
p108
aVto take the gloves off.
p109
aVThose are the euphemisms, and this is how it was interpreted.
p110
aVLet's go down to that dungeon.

p131
aa(lp132
VSo, pretty horrific.
p133
aVThat's one of the visual illustrations of evil.
p134
aVAnd it should not have escaped you
p135
aVthat the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out
p136
aVwith Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity
p137
aVis that that prisoner was mentally ill.
p138
aVThat prisoner covered himself with shit every day,
p139
aVthey had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink.
p140
aVBut the guards ended up calling him "Shit Boy."
p141
aVWhat was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution?
p142
aa(lp143
VIn any event, here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.
p144
aVHe comes down and says, "I want to know, who is responsible?
p145
aVWho are the bad apples?"
p146
aVWell, that's a bad question.
p147
aVYou have to reframe it and ask, "What is responsible?"
p148
aV"What" could be the who of people,
p149
aVbut it could also be the what of the situation,
p150
aVand obviously that's wrongheaded.
p151
aa(lp152
VHow do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character,
p153
aVif you believe that they were good soldiers
p154
aVbefore they went down to that dungeon?
p155
aVThere are three ways. The main way is called dispositional.
p156
aVWe look at what's inside of the person, the bad apples.
p157
aa(lp158
VThis is the foundation of all of social science,
p159
aVthe foundation of religion, the foundation of war.
p160
aVSocial psychologists like me come along and say,
p161
aV"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,
p162
aVbut you'll have to be aware of the situation.
p163
aVWho are the cast of characters? What's the costume?
p164
aVIs there a stage director?"
p165
aVAnd so we're interested in what are the external factors
p166
aVaround the individual \u2014 the bad barrel?
p167
aVSocial scientists stop there and they miss the big point
p168
aVthat I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib.
p169
aVThe power is in the system.
p170
aVThe system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals,
p171
aVand the system is the legal, political, economic, cultural background.
p172
aVAnd this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers.
p173
aa(lp174
VIf you want to change a person, change the situation.
p175
aVAnd to change it, you've got to know where the power is, in the system.
p176
aVSo the Lucifer effect involves understanding
p177
aVhuman character transformations with these three factors.
p178
aVAnd it's a dynamic interplay.
p179
aVWhat do the people bring into the situation?
p180
aVWhat does the situation bring out of them?
p181
aVAnd what is the system that creates and maintains that situation?
p182
aa(lp183
VMy recent book, "The Lucifer Effect," is about,
p184
aVhow do you understand how good people turn evil?
p185
aVAnd it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today.
p186
aVSo Dr. Z's "Lucifer Effect," although it focuses on evil,
p187
aVreally is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity
p188
aVto make any of us kind or cruel,
p189
aVcaring or indifferent, creative or destructive,
p190
aVand it makes some of us villains.
p191
aVAnd the good news that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end
p192
aVis that it makes some of us heroes.
p193
aVThis wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker summarizes my whole talk:
p194
aV"I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop, Jerome.
p195
aVLike yourself, I'm a complex amalgam
p196
aVof positive and negative personality traits
p197
aVthat emerge or not, depending on the circumstances."
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VThere's a study some of you think you know about,
p202
aVbut very few people have ever read the story.
p203
aVYou watched the movie.
p204
aVThis is Stanley Milgram, little Jewish kid from the Bronx,
p205
aVand he asked the question, "Could the Holocaust happen here, now?"
p206
aVPeople say, "No, that's Nazi Germany, Hitler, you know, that's 1939."
p207
aVHe said, "Yeah, but suppose Hitler asked you,
p208
aV'Would you electrocute a stranger?' 'No way, I'm a good person.'"
p209
aVHe said, "Why don't we put you in a situation
p210
aVand give you a chance to see what you would do?"
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people.
p213
aV500 New Haven, Connecticut, 500 Bridgeport.
p214
aVAnd the ad said, "Psychologists want to understand memory.
p215
aVWe want to improve people's memory, because it is the key to success."
p216
aVOK?
p217
aV"We're going to give you five bucks \u2014 four dollars for your time.
p218
aVWe don't want college students. We want men between 20 and 50."
p219
aVIn the later studies, they ran women.
p220
aVOrdinary people: barbers, clerks, white-collar people.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo, you go down,
p223
aVone of you will be a learner, one will be a teacher.
p224
aVThe learner's a genial, middle-aged guy.
p225
aVHe gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room.
p226
aVThe learner could be middle-aged, could be as young as 20.
p227
aVAnd one of you is told by the authority, the guy in the lab coat,
p228
aV"Your job as teacher is to give him material to learn.
p229
aVGets it right, reward.
p230
aVGets it wrong, you press a button on the shock box.
p231
aVThe first button is 15 volts. He doesn't even feel it."
p232
aVThat's the key.
p233
aVAll evil starts with 15 volts.
p234
aVAnd then the next step is another 15 volts.
p235
aVThe problem is, at the end of the line, it's 450 volts.
p236
aVAnd as you go along, the guy is screaming,
p237
aV"I've got a heart condition! I'm out of here!"
p238
aa(lp239
VYou're a good person. You complain.
p240
aV"Sir, who will be responsible if something happens to him?"
p241
aVThe experimenter says, "Don't worry, I will be responsible.
p242
aVContinue, teacher."
p243
aVAnd the question is, who would go all the way to 450 volts?
p244
aVYou should notice here, when it gets up to 375,
p245
aVit says, "Danger. Severe Shock."
p246
aVWhen it gets up to here, there's "XXX" \u2014 the pornography of power.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists,
p249
aV"What percent of American citizens would go to the end?"
p250
aVThey said only one percent.
p251
aVBecause that's sadistic behavior, and we know, psychiatry knows,
p252
aVonly one percent of Americans are sadistic.
p253
aVOK.
p254
aVHere's the data. They could not be more wrong.
p255
aVTwo thirds go all the way to 450 volts.
p256
aVThis was just one study.
p257
aVMilgram did more than 16 studies.
p258
aVAnd look at this.
p259
aVIn study 16, where you see somebody like you go all the way,
p260
aV90 percent go all the way.
p261
aVIn study five, if you see people rebel,
p262
aV90 percent rebel.
p263
aVWhat about women? Study 13 \u2014 no different than men.
p264
aVSo Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people
p265
aVto blindly obey authority, to go all the way to 450 volts.
p266
aVAnd it's like a dial on human nature.
p267
aVA dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient,
p268
aVdown to the majority, down to none.
p269
aa(lp270
VWhat are the external parallels? For all research is artificial.
p271
aVWhat's the validity in the real world?
p272
aV912 American citizens committed suicide or were murdered
p273
aVby family and friends in Guyana jungle in 1978,
p274
aVbecause they were blindly obedient to this guy, their pastor \u2014
p275
aVnot their priest \u2014 their pastor, Reverend Jim Jones.
p276
aVHe persuaded them to commit mass suicide.
p277
aVAnd so, he's the modern Lucifer effect,
p278
aVa man of God who becomes the Angel of Death.
p279
aVMilgram's study is all about individual authority to control people.
p280
aVMost of the time, we are in institutions,
p281
aVso the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions
p282
aVto influence individual behavior.
p283
aVInterestingly, Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class
p284
aVin James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.
p285
aa(lp286
VI did this study with my graduate students,
p287
aVespecially Craig Haney \u2014 and it also began work with an ad.
p288
aVWe had a cheap, little ad,
p289
aVbut we wanted college students for a study of prison life.
p290
aV75 people volunteered, took personality tests.
p291
aVWe did interviews.
p292
aVPicked two dozen: the most normal, the most healthy.
p293
aVRandomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard.
p294
aVSo on day one, we knew we had good apples.
p295
aVI'm going to put them in a bad situation.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd secondly, we know there's no difference
p298
aVbetween the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners.
p299
aVTo the prisoners, we said,
p300
aV"Wait at home. The study will begin Sunday."
p301
aVWe didn't tell them
p302
aVthat the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Video) (Music)
p305
aa(lp306
V[Day 1]
p307
aa(lp308
VStudent: A police car pulls up in front, and a cop comes to the front door,
p309
aVand knocks, and says he's looking for me.
p310
aVSo they, right there, you know, they took me out the door,
p311
aVthey put my hands against the car.
p312
aVIt was a real cop car, it was a real policeman,
p313
aVand there were real neighbors in the street,
p314
aVwho didn't know that this was an experiment.
p315
aVAnd there was cameras all around and neighbors all around.
p316
aVThey put me in the car, then they drove me around Palo Alto.
p317
aVThey took me to the basement of the police station.
p318
aVThen they put me in a cell.
p319
aVI was the first one to be picked up, so they put me in a cell,
p320
aVwhich was just like a room with a door with bars on it.
p321
aVYou could tell it wasn't a real jail.
p322
aVThey locked me in there, in this degrading little outfit.
p323
aVThey were taking this experiment too seriously.
p324
aa(lp325
VHere are the prisoners, who are going to be dehumanized, they'll become numbers.
p326
aVHere are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity.
p327
aVGuards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands,
p328
aVto do other humiliating tasks.
p329
aVThey strip them naked. They sexually taunt them.
p330
aVThey begin to do degrading activities, like having them simulate sodomy.
p331
aVYou saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib.
p332
aVMy guards did it in five days.
p333
aVThe stress reaction was so extreme
p334
aVthat normal kids we picked because they were healthy
p335
aVhad breakdowns within 36 hours.
p336
aVThe study ended after six days, because it was out of control.
p337
aVFive kids had emotional breakdowns.
p338
aa(lp339
VDoes it make a difference
p340
aVif warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not?
p341
aVIf they're anonymous, how do they treat their victims?
p342
aVIn some cultures, they go to war without changing their appearance.
p343
aVIn others, they paint themselves like "Lord of the Flies."
p344
aVIn some, they wear masks.
p345
aVIn many, soldiers are anonymous in uniform.
p346
aVSo this anthropologist, John Watson, found 23 cultures that had two bits of data.
p347
aVDo they change their appearance? 15.
p348
aVDo they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.
p349
aVIf they don't change their appearance,
p350
aVonly one of eight kills, tortures or mutilates.
p351
aVThe key is in the red zone.
p352
aVIf they change their appearance,
p353
aV12 of 13 \u2014 that's 90 percent \u2014 kill, torture, mutilate.
p354
aVAnd that's the power of anonymity.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo what are the seven social processes
p357
aVthat grease the slippery slope of evil?
p358
aVMindlessly taking the first small step.
p359
aVDehumanization of others. De-individuation of self.
p360
aVDiffusion of personal responsibility.
p361
aVBlind obedience to authority.
p362
aVUncritical conformity to group norms.
p363
aVPassive tolerance of evil through inaction, or indifference.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation.
p366
aVYour habitual response patterns don't work.
p367
aVYour personality and morality are disengaged.
p368
aV"Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer;
p369
aVnothing more difficult than understanding him," Dostoyevsky.
p370
aVUnderstanding is not excusing. Psychology is not excuse-ology.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo social and psychological research reveals
p373
aVhow ordinary, good people can be transformed without the drugs.
p374
aVYou don't need it. You just need the social-psychological processes.
p375
aVReal world parallels?
p376
aVCompare this with this.
p377
aVJames Schlesinger \u2014 I'm going to end with this \u2014 says,
p378
aV"Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why
p379
aVindividuals and groups who usually act humanely
p380
aVcan sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances."
p381
aVThat's the Lucifer effect.
p382
aVAnd he goes on to say, "The landmark Stanford study
p383
aVprovides a cautionary tale for all military operations."
p384
aVIf you give people power without oversight,
p385
aVit's a prescription for abuse.
p386
aVThey knew that, and let that happen.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo another report, an investigative report by General Fay,
p389
aVsays the system is guilty.
p390
aVIn this report, he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib,
p391
aVby leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse,
p392
aVand because it remained undiscovered
p393
aVby higher authorities for a long period of time.
p394
aVThose abuses went on for three months.
p395
aVWho was watching the store?
p396
aVThe answer is nobody, I think on purpose.
p397
aVHe gave the guards permission to do those things,
p398
aVand they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas.
p401
aVThe shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual.
p402
aVThe shift is toward a public health model
p403
aVthat recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease.
p404
aVBullying is a disease. Prejudice is a disease.
p405
aVViolence is a disease.
p406
aVSince the Inquisition, we've been dealing with problems at the individual level.
p407
aVIt doesn't work.
p408
aVAleksandr Solzhenitsyn says, "The line between good and evil
p409
aVcuts through the heart of every human being."
p410
aVThat means that line is not out there.
p411
aVThat's a decision that you have to make, a personal thing.
p412
aa(lp413
VSo I want to end very quickly on a positive note.
p414
aVHeroism as the antidote to evil,
p415
aVby promoting the heroic imagination,
p416
aVespecially in our kids, in our educational system.
p417
aVWe want kids to think, "I'm a hero in waiting,
p418
aVwaiting for the right situation to come along,
p419
aVand I will act heroically.
p420
aVMy whole life, I'm now going to focus away from evil \u2014
p421
aVthat I've been in since I was a kid \u2014 to understanding heroes.
p422
aa(lp423
VBanality of heroism.
p424
aVIt's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.
p425
aVIt's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil."
p426
aVOur traditional societal heroes are wrong, because they are the exceptions.
p427
aVThey organize their life around this. That's why we know their names.
p428
aVOur kids' heroes are also wrong models for them,
p429
aVbecause they have supernatural talents.
p430
aVWe want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people,
p431
aVand the heroic act is unusual.
p432
aVThis is Joe Darby.
p433
aVHe was the one that stopped those abuses you saw,
p434
aVbecause when he saw those images,
p435
aVhe turned them over to a senior investigating officer.
p436
aVHe was a low-level private, and that stopped it.
p437
aVWas he a hero? No.
p438
aVThey had to put him in hiding, because people wanted to kill him,
p439
aVand then his mother and his wife.
p440
aVFor three years, they were in hiding.
p441
aa(lp442
VThis is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study.
p443
aVWhen I said it got out of control, I was the prison superintendent.
p444
aVI didn't know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent.
p445
aVShe saw that madhouse and said,
p446
aV"You know what, it's terrible what you're doing to those boys.
p447
aVThey're not prisoners nor guards, they're boys, and you are responsible."
p448
aVAnd I ended the study the next day.
p449
aVThe good news is I married her the next year.
p450
aa(lp451
V(Laughter)
p452
aa(lp453
V(Applause)
p454
aa(lp455
VI just came to my senses, obviously.
p456
aa(lp457
VSo situations have the power to do [three things].
p458
aVBut the point is, this is the same situation
p459
aVthat can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us,
p460
aVthat makes us perpetrators of evil,
p461
aVcan inspire the heroic imagination in others.
p462
aVIt's the same situation and you're on one side or the other.
p463
aVMost people are guilty of the evil of inaction,
p464
aVbecause your mother said, "Don't get involved. Mind your own business."
p465
aVAnd you have to say, "Mama, humanity is my business."
p466
aa(lp467
VSo the psychology of heroism is \u2014 we're going to end in a moment \u2014
p468
aVhow do we encourage children in new hero courses,
p469
aVthat I'm working on with Matt Langdon \u2014 he has a hero workshop \u2014
p470
aVto develop this heroic imagination, this self-labeling,
p471
aV"I am a hero in waiting," and teach them skills.
p472
aVTo be a hero, you have to learn to be a deviant,
p473
aVbecause you're always going against the conformity of the group.
p474
aVHeroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act.
p475
aa(lp476
VThe key to heroism is two things.
p477
aVYou have to act when other people are passive.
p478
aVB: You have to act socio-centrically, not egocentrically.
p479
aVAnd I want to end with a known story about Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero.
p480
aVFifty-year-old African-American construction worker standing on a subway.
p481
aVA white guy falls on the tracks.
p482
aVThe subway train is coming. There's 75 people there.
p483
aVYou know what? They freeze.
p484
aVHe's got a reason not to get involved.
p485
aVHe's black, the guy's white, and he's got two kids.
p486
aVInstead, he gives his kids to a stranger,
p487
aVjumps on the tracks, puts the guy between the tracks,
p488
aVlays on him, the subway goes over him.
p489
aVWesley and the guy \u2014 20 and a half inches height.
p490
aVThe train clearance is 21 inches.
p491
aVA half an inch would have taken his head off.
p492
aVAnd he said, "I did what anyone could do," no big deal to jump on the tracks.
p493
aa(lp494
VAnd the moral imperative is "I did what everyone should do."
p495
aVAnd so one day, you will be in a new situation.
p496
aVTake path one, you're going to be a perpetrator of evil.
p497
aVEvil, meaning you're going to be Arthur Andersen.
p498
aVYou're going to cheat, or you're going to allow bullying.
p499
aVPath two, you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction.
p500
aVPath three, you become a hero.
p501
aVThe point is, are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes,
p502
aVwaiting for the right situation to come along
p503
aVto put heroic imagination into action?
p504
aVBecause it may only happen once in your life,
p505
aVand when you pass it by, you'll always know,
p506
aVI could have been a hero and I let it pass me by.
p507
aVSo the point is thinking it and then doing it.
p508
aa(lp509
VSo I want to thank you. Thank you.
p510
aVLet's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad,
p511
aVand let's focus on the positive.
p512
aVAdvocate for respect of personal dignity, for justice and peace,
p513
aVwhich sadly our administration has not been doing.
p514
aa(lp515
VThanks so much.
p516
aa(lp517
V(Applause)

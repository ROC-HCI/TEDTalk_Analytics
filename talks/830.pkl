VI first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.
p5
aVI grew up in Mobile, Alabama \u2014
p6
aVsomebody's got to be from Mobile, right? \u2014
p7
aVand Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,
p8
aVforming this beautiful delta.
p9
aVAnd the delta has alligators crawling
p10
aVin and out of rivers filled with fish
p11
aVand cypress trees dripping with snakes,
p12
aVbirds of every flavor.
p13
aVIt's an absolute magical wonderland to live in \u2014
p14
aVif you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.
p15
aVAnd this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I remember my first real contact with octopus
p18
aVwas probably at age five or six.
p19
aVI was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.
p20
aVAnd I reached down and picked him up, and immediately
p21
aVbecame fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.
p22
aVIt was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.
p23
aVIt was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.
p24
aVThen it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands
p25
aVand started flashing colors,
p26
aVjust pulsing all of these colors.
p27
aVAnd as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,
p28
aVraised into a spherical shape
p29
aVand turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.
p30
aVI'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!
p31
aVSo I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,
p32
aVso I put him down.
p33
aVThe octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:
p34
aVIt landed on the bottom in the rubble
p35
aVand \u2014 fwoosh! \u2014 vanished
p36
aVright before my eyes.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd I knew, right then, at age six,
p39
aVthat is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.
p40
aVAnd I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,
p41
aVand then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school
p42
aVat the University of Hawaii.
p43
aVAnd while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.
p44
aVAnd the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks
p45
aVbut not a lot of invertebrate displays,
p46
aVand being the spineless guy, I thought, well
p47
aVI'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals
p48
aVI had been learning about as a student
p49
aVand bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,
p52
aVbut they didn't really interact with people.
p53
aVBut the octopus did.
p54
aVIf you walked up to an octopus tank,
p55
aVespecially early in the morning before anyone arrived,
p56
aVthe octopus would rise up and look at you
p57
aVand you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"
p58
aVAnd you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize
p59
aVthat these animals all have different personalities:
p60
aVSome of them would hold their ground,
p61
aVothers would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,
p62
aVand one in particular, this amazing animal ...
p63
aVI went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,
p64
aVand he had little horns come up above his eyes.
p65
aVSo I went right up to the front of the tank \u2014
p66
aVI was three or four inches from the front glass \u2014
p67
aVand the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,
p68
aVand he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.
p69
aVSo I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,
p70
aVand at that time I could actually focus that close;
p71
aVnow as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.
p72
aVAnyway, there we were, staring at each other,
p73
aVand he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel
p74
aVand releases it in the jet of water entering the tank
p75
aVfrom the filtration system,
p76
aVand \u2014 chk chk chk chk chk! \u2014 this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
p77
aVHe reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it \u2014
p78
aVchk chk chk chk chk! \u2014 same thing.
p79
aVThen he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.
p80
aVThen he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.
p81
aVAnd then I realize the octopus won the arms race,
p82
aVbecause I was out and he had six left. (Laughter)
p83
aVBut the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day
p84
aVwas that this octopus was playing,
p85
aVwhich is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo, about three years into my degree,
p88
aVa funny thing happened on the way to the office,
p89
aVwhich actually changed the course of my life.
p90
aVA man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially
p91
aVhe sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific
p92
aVto collect animals for him,
p93
aVand as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.
p94
aVHe said, "Make a movie about this expedition."
p95
aV"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie \u2014
p96
aVthis'll be interesting,"
p97
aVand off we went. And we did, we made a movie,
p98
aVwhich had to be the worst movie ever made
p99
aVin the history of movie making,
p100
aVbut it was a blast. I had so much fun.
p101
aVAnd I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,
p102
aVthinking, "Wait a minute.
p103
aVMaybe I can do this all the time.
p104
aVYeah, I'll be a filmmaker."
p105
aVSo I literally came back from that job,
p106
aVquit school, hung my filmmaking shingle
p107
aVand just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.
p108
aVIt's been a good ride.
p109
aVAnd what I learned in school though was really beneficial.
p110
aVIf you're a wildlife filmmaker
p111
aVand you're going out into the field to film animals,
p112
aVespecially behavior,
p113
aVit helps to have a fundamental background
p114
aVon who these animals are,
p115
aVhow they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut where I really learned about octopus
p118
aVwas in the field, as a filmmaker
p119
aVmaking films with them,
p120
aVwhere you're allowed to spend large periods of time
p121
aVwith the animals, seeing octopus being octopus
p122
aVin their ocean homes.
p123
aVI remember I took a trip to Australia,
p124
aVwent to an island called One Tree Island.
p125
aVAnd apparently, evolution had occurred
p126
aVat a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,
p127
aVbetween the time they named it and the time I arrived,
p128
aVbecause I'm sure there were at least three trees
p129
aVon that island when we were there.
p130
aVAnyway, one tree is situated right next to
p131
aVa beautiful coral reef.
p132
aVIn fact, there's a surge channel
p133
aVwhere the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.
p134
aVAnd there's a beautiful reef,
p135
aVvery complex reef, with lots of animals,
p136
aVincluding a lot of octopus.
p137
aVAnd not uniquely
p138
aVbut certainly, the octopus in Australia
p139
aVare masters at camouflage.
p140
aVAs a matter of fact,
p141
aVthere's one right there.
p142
aVSo our first challenge was to find these things,
p143
aVand that was a challenge, indeed.
p144
aVBut the idea is, we were there for a month
p145
aVand I wanted to acclimate the animals to us
p146
aVso that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.
p147
aVSo the first week was pretty much spent
p148
aVjust getting as close as we could,
p149
aVevery day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.
p150
aVAnd you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy
p151
aVand you'd back up, come back in a few hours.
p152
aVAnd after the first week, they ignored us.
p153
aVIt was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."
p154
aVSo they went on about their business
p155
aVand from a foot away, we're watching mating
p156
aVand courting and fighting
p157
aVand it is just an unbelievable experience.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd one of the most fantastic displays
p160
aVthat I remember, or at least visually,
p161
aVwas a foraging behavior.
p162
aVAnd they had a lot of different techniques
p163
aVthat they would use for foraging,
p164
aVbut this particular one used vision.
p165
aVAnd they would see a coral head,
p166
aVmaybe 10 feet away,
p167
aVand start moving over toward that coral head.
p168
aVAnd I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,
p169
aVbut whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom
p170
aVand go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,
p171
aVand then the web between the arms
p172
aVwould completely engulf the coral head,
p173
aVand they would fish out, swim for crabs.
p174
aVAnd as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.
p175
aVAnd I always wondered what happened under that web.
p176
aVSo we created a way to find out, (Laughter)
p177
aVand I got my first look at that famous beak in action.
p178
aVIt was fantastic.
p179
aa(lp180
VIf you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,
p181
aVyou might as well pick one that's fairly common.
p182
aVAnd octopus are, they live in all the oceans.
p183
aVThey also live deep.
p184
aVAnd I can't say octopus are responsible
p185
aVfor my really strong interest
p186
aVin getting in subs and going deep,
p187
aVbut whatever the case, I like that.
p188
aVIt's like nothing you've ever done.
p189
aa(lp190
VIf you ever really want to get away from it all
p191
aVand see something that you have never seen,
p192
aVand have an excellent chance of seeing something
p193
aVno one has ever seen, get in a sub.
p194
aVYou climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,
p195
aVturn on the scrubber,
p196
aVwhich removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.
p197
aVDown you go. There's no connection to the surface
p198
aVapart from a pretty funky radio.
p199
aVAnd as you go down, the washing machine
p200
aVat the surface calms down.
p201
aVAnd it gets quiet.
p202
aVAnd it starts getting really nice.
p203
aVAnd as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in
p204
aVgives way to darker and darker blue.
p205
aVAnd finally, it's a rich lavender,
p206
aVand after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.
p207
aVAnd now you've entered the realm
p208
aVof the mid-water community.
p209
aa(lp210
VYou could give an entire talk
p211
aVabout the creatures that live in the mid-water.
p212
aVSuffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,
p213
aVwithout question, the most bizarre designs
p214
aVand outrageous behaviors
p215
aVare in the animals that live in the mid-water community.
p216
aVBut we're just going to zip right past this area,
p217
aVthis area that includes about 95 percent
p218
aVof the living space on our planet
p219
aVand go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,
p222
aV40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.
p223
aVAnd they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,
p224
aVsome of which are tens of thousands of feet
p225
aVand bust through the surface,
p226
aVcreating islands like Hawaii.
p227
aVAnd the top of this mountain range
p228
aVis splitting apart, creating a rift valley.
p229
aVAnd when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is
p230
aVbecause literally thousands of active volcanoes
p231
aVare going off at any point in time
p232
aVall along this 40,000 mile range.
p233
aVAnd as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,
p234
aVmagma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,
p235
aVand you're looking land \u2014 new land \u2014
p236
aVbeing created right before your eyes.
p237
aVAnd over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water
p238
aVcreating enormous pressure,
p239
aVforcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,
p240
aVuntil it hits a magma chamber
p241
aVwhere it becomes superheated
p242
aVand supersaturated with minerals,
p243
aVreverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface
p244
aVand is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.
p245
aVIn fact, this whole area
p246
aVis like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
p249
aVThe surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.
p250
aVSo it immediately cools,
p251
aVand it can no longer hold in suspension
p252
aVall of the material that it's dissolved,
p253
aVand it precipitates out, forming black smoke.
p254
aVAnd it forms these towers, these chimneys
p255
aVthat are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.
p256
aVAnd all along the sides of these chimneys
p257
aVis shimmering with heat and loaded with life.
p258
aVYou've got black smokers going all over the place
p259
aVand chimneys that have tube worms
p260
aVthat might be eight to 10 feet long.
p261
aVAnd out of the tops of these tube worms
p262
aVare these beautiful red plumes.
p263
aVAnd living amongst the tangle of tube worms
p264
aVis an entire community of animals:
p265
aVshrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,
p266
aVclams and swarms of arthropods
p267
aVthat are playing that dangerous game
p268
aVbetween over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd this whole ecosystem
p271
aVwasn't even known about
p272
aVuntil 33 years ago.
p273
aVAnd it completely threw science on its head.
p274
aVIt made scientists rethink
p275
aVwhere life on Earth might have actually begun.
p276
aVAnd before the discovery of these vents,
p277
aVall life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,
p278
aVwas believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.
p279
aVBut down there, there is no sun,
p280
aVthere is no photosynthesis;
p281
aVit's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,
p282
aVand it's all so ephemeral.
p283
aVYou might film this
p284
aVunbelievable hydrothermal vent,
p285
aVwhich you think at the time has to be on another planet.
p286
aVIt's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;
p287
aVit looks like aliens in an alien environment.
p288
aVBut you go back to the same vent eight years later
p289
aVand it can be completely dead.
p290
aVThere's no hot water.
p291
aVAll of the animals are gone, they're dead,
p292
aVand the chimneys are still there
p293
aVcreating a really nice ghost town,
p294
aVan eerie, spooky ghost town,
p295
aVbut essentially devoid of animals, of course.
p296
aVBut 10 miles down the ridge...
p297
aVpshhh! There's another volcano going.
p298
aVAnd there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.
p299
aVAnd this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities
p300
aVis going on every 30 or 40 years
p301
aVall along the ridge.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd that ephemeral nature
p304
aVof the hydrothermal vent community
p305
aVisn't really different from some of the
p306
aVareas that I've seen
p307
aVin 35 years of traveling around, making films.
p308
aVWhere you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.
p309
aVAnd you go back, and I'm at home,
p310
aVand I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...
p311
aVAh! I know where I can shoot that.
p312
aVThere's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."
p313
aVAnd you show up, and it's dead.
p314
aVThere's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.
p315
aVYou think, "Well, what happened?"
p316
aVAnd you turn around,
p317
aVand there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,
p318
aVand bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.
p319
aVAnd over here
p320
aVthere's a golf course going in.
p321
aVAnd this is the tropics.
p322
aVIt's raining like crazy here.
p323
aVSo this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,
p324
aVcarrying with it sediments from the construction site,
p325
aVsmothering the coral and killing it.
p326
aVAnd fertilizers and pesticides
p327
aVare flowing into the bay from the golf course \u2014
p328
aVthe pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,
p329
aVfertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom \u2014
p330
aVand there's your pea soup.
p331
aa(lp332
VBut, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.
p333
aVI've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.
p334
aVAnd I looked at it, just said, "Yuck,"
p335
aVand go and work on the other side of the island.
p336
aVFive years later, come back,
p337
aVand that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
p338
aVIt's got living coral, fish all over the place,
p339
aVcrystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"
p340
aVWell, how it happened is
p341
aVthe local community galvanized.
p342
aVThey recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;
p343
aVenacted laws and made permits required
p344
aVto do responsible construction
p345
aVand golf course maintenance
p346
aVand stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,
p347
aVand stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,
p348
aVand the bay recovered.
p349
aVThe ocean has an amazing ability
p350
aVto recover, if we'll just leave it alone.
p351
aa(lp352
VI think Margaret Mead
p353
aVsaid it best.
p354
aVShe said that a small group of thoughtful people
p355
aVcould change the world.
p356
aVIndeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
p357
aVAnd a small group of thoughtful people
p358
aVchanged that bay.
p359
aVI'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.
p360
aVI've been to a lot of lectures
p361
aVwhere, at the end of it, inevitably,
p362
aVone of the first questions that comes up is,
p363
aV"But, but what can I do?
p364
aVI'm an individual. I'm one person.
p365
aVAnd these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."
p366
aVFair enough question.
p367
aa(lp368
VMy answer to that is don't look
p369
aVat the big, overwhelming issues of the world.
p370
aVLook in your own backyard.
p371
aVLook in your heart, actually.
p372
aVWhat do you really care about that isn't right where you live?
p373
aVAnd fix it.
p374
aVCreate a healing zone in your neighborhood
p375
aVand encourage others to do the same.
p376
aVAnd maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,
p377
aVlittle dots on a map.
p378
aVAnd in fact, the way that we can communicate today \u2014
p379
aVwhere Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,
p380
aVand the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...
p381
aVand everybody is talking to everyone else \u2014
p382
aVit's not isolated points on a map anymore,
p383
aVit's a network we've created.
p384
aVAnd maybe these healing zones can start growing,
p385
aVand possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.
p386
aVSo that's how I answer that question.
p387
aVLook in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.
p388
aVWhat can you do that is more responsible
p389
aVthan what you're doing now?
p390
aVAnd do that, and spread the word.
p391
aVThe vent community animals
p392
aVcan't really do much
p393
aVabout the life and death
p394
aVthat's going on where they live, but up here we can.
p395
aVIn theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.
p396
aVAnd we can make changes to our behavior
p397
aVthat will influence and affect the environment,
p398
aVlike those people changed the health of that bay.
p399
aa(lp400
VNow, Sylvia's TED Prize wish
p401
aVwas to beseech us to do anything we could,
p402
aVeverything we could,
p403
aVto set aside not pin pricks,
p404
aVbut significant expanses
p405
aVof the ocean for preservation,
p406
aV"hope spots," she calls them.
p407
aVAnd I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.
p408
aVAnd it's my hope that some of these "hope spots"
p409
aVcan be in the deep ocean,
p410
aVan area that has historically
p411
aVbeen seriously neglected, if not abused.
p412
aVThe term "deep six" comes to mind:
p413
aV"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,
p414
aVdeep six it!"
p415
aVSo, I hope that we can also keep
p416
aVsome of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.
p417
aVNow, I don't get a wish,
p418
aVbut I certainly can say
p419
aVthat I will do anything I can
p420
aVto support Sylvia Earle's wish.
p421
aVAnd that I do.
p422
aa(lp423
VThank you very much. (Applause)

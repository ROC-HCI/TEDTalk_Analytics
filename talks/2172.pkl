VOn June 12, 2014, precisely at 3:33
p5
aVin a balmy winter afternoon in São Paulo, Brazil,
p6
aVa typical South American winter afternoon,
p7
aVthis kid, this young man  that you see celebrating here
p8
aVlike he had scored a goal,
p9
aVJuliano Pinto, 29 years old, accomplished a magnificent deed.
p10
aVDespite being paralyzed
p11
aVand not having any sensation from mid-chest to the tip of his toes
p12
aVas the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother
p13
aVand produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left Juliano in a wheelchair,
p14
aVJuliano rose to the occasion, and on this day did something
p15
aVthat pretty much everybody that saw him  in the six years deemed impossible.
p16
aVJuliano Pinto delivered the opening kick
p17
aVof the 2014 Brazilian  World Soccer Cup here
p18
aVjust by thinking.
p19
aVHe could not move his body,
p20
aVbut he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball.
p21
aVHe was an athlete before the lesion. He's a para-athlete right now.
p22
aVHe's going to be in the Paralympic Games, I hope, in a couple years.
p23
aVBut what the spinal cord lesion  did not rob from Juliano
p24
aVwas his ability to dream.
p25
aVAnd dream he did that afternoon, for a stadium of about 75,000 people
p26
aVand an audience of close to a billion watching on TV.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd that kick crowned, basically, 30 years of basic research
p29
aVstudying how the brain,
p30
aVhow this amazing universe that we have between our ears
p31
aVthat is only comparable to universe that we have above our head
p32
aVbecause it has about 100 billion elements
p33
aVtalking to each other through electrical brainstorms,
p34
aVwhat Juliano accomplished took 30 years to imagine in laboratories
p35
aVand about 15 years to plan.
p36
aa(lp37
VWhen John Chapin and I, 15 years ago, proposed in a paper
p38
aVthat we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface,
p39
aVmeaning connecting a brain to devices
p40
aVso that animals and humans could just move these devices,
p41
aVno matter how far they are from their own bodies,
p42
aVjust by imagining what they want to do,
p43
aVour colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help,
p44
aVof the psychiatry variety.
p45
aVAnd despite that, a Scot and a Brazilian persevered,
p46
aVbecause that's how we were raised in our respective countries,
p47
aVand for 12, 15 years,
p48
aVwe made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd a brain-machine interface is not rocket science,
p51
aVit's just brain research.
p52
aVIt's nothing but using sensors
p53
aVto read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing
p54
aVto generate the motor commands
p55
aVthat have to be downloaded to the spinal cord,
p56
aVso we projected sensors that can read
p57
aVhundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously,
p58
aVand extract from these electrical signals
p59
aVthe motor planning that the brain is generating
p60
aVto actually make us move into space.
p61
aVAnd by doing that, we converted these signals into digital commands
p62
aVthat any mechanical, electronic, or even a virtual device can understand
p63
aVso that the subject can imagine what he, she or it wants to make move,
p64
aVand the device obeys that brain command.
p65
aVBy sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors,
p66
aVas you are going to see in a moment,
p67
aVwe actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm
p68
aVthat that voluntary motor will was being enacted, no matter where \u2014
p69
aVnext to the subject, next door, or across the planet.
p70
aVAnd as this message gave feedback back to the brain,
p71
aVthe brain realized its goal: to make us move.
p72
aVSo this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago,
p73
aVwhere a monkey, without moving its body,
p74
aVlearned to control the movements of an avatar arm,
p75
aVa virtual arm that doesn't exist.
p76
aVWhat you're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey
p77
aVas it explores three different visually identical spheres
p78
aVin virtual space.
p79
aVAnd to get a reward, a drop of orange juice that monkeys love,
p80
aVthis animal has to detect, select one of these objects
p81
aVby touching,
p82
aVnot by seeing it, by touching it,
p83
aVbecause every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects,
p84
aVan electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal
p85
aVdescribing the fine texture of the surface of this object,
p86
aVso the animal can judge what is  the correct object that he has to grab,
p87
aVand if he does that, he gets a reward without moving a muscle.
p88
aVThe perfect Brazilian lunch:
p89
aVnot moving a muscle and getting your orange juice.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo as we saw this happening,
p92
aVwe actually came and proposed the idea that we had published 15 years ago.
p93
aVWe reenacted this paper.
p94
aVWe got it out of the drawers,
p95
aVand we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed
p96
aVto actually use the brain-machine interface to regain mobility.
p97
aVThe idea was that if you suffered \u2014
p98
aVand that can happen to any one of us.
p99
aVLet me tell you, it's very sudden.
p100
aVIt's a millisecond of a collision,
p101
aVa car accident that transforms your life completely.
p102
aVIf you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord,
p103
aVyou cannot move because your brainstorms cannot reach your muscles.
p104
aVHowever, your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head.
p105
aVParaplegic, quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night.
p106
aVThey have that inside their head.
p107
aVThe problem is how to get that code out of it
p108
aVand make the movement be created again.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo what we proposed was, let's create a new body.
p111
aVLet's create a robotic vest.
p112
aVAnd that's exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking,
p113
aVbecause he was wearing the first brain-controlled robotic vest
p114
aVthat can be used by paraplegic, quadriplegic patients to move
p115
aVand to regain feedback.
p116
aa(lp117
VThat was the original idea, 15 years ago.
p118
aVWhat I'm going to show you is how 156 people from 25 countries
p119
aVall over the five continents of this beautiful Earth,
p120
aVdropped their lives, dropped their patents,
p121
aVdropped their dogs, wives, kids, school, jobs,
p122
aVand congregated to come to Brazil for 18 months to actually get this done.
p123
aVBecause a couple years after Brazil was awarded the World Cup,
p124
aVwe heard that the Brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful
p125
aVin the opening ceremony
p126
aVin the country that reinvented and perfected soccer
p127
aVuntil we met the Germans, of course.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVBut that's a different talk,
p130
aVand a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that.
p131
aVBut what Brazil wanted to do is to showcase
p132
aVa completely different country,
p133
aVa country that values science and technology,
p134
aVand can give a gift to millions, 25 million people around the world
p135
aVthat cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury.
p136
aVWell, we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed,
p137
aVwell, let's have the kickoff of the 2014 World Cup
p138
aVbe given by a Brazilian paraplegic
p139
aVusing a brain-controlled exoskeleton that allows him to kick the ball
p140
aVand to feel the contact of the ball.
p141
aVThey looked at us, thought that we were completely nuts,
p142
aVand said, "Okay, let's try."
p143
aVWe had 18 months to do everything from zero, from scratch.
p144
aVWe had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,
p145
aVwe had nothing done.
p146
aVThese people came all together
p147
aVand in 18 months, we got eight patients in a routine of training
p148
aVand basically built from nothing this guy,
p149
aVthat we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1.
p150
aVThe first brain-controlled exoskeleton to be built
p151
aVwas named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever,
p152
aVAlberto Santos Dumont,
p153
aVwho, on October 19, 1901, created and flew himself
p154
aVthe first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see.
p155
aVSorry, my American friends,
p156
aVI live in North Carolina,
p157
aVbut it was two years before the Wright Brothers flew
p158
aVon the coast of North Carolina.
p159
aV(Applause)
p160
aVFlight control is Brazilian. (Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VSo we went together with these guys
p163
aVand we basically put this exoskeleton together,
p164
aV15 degrees of freedom, hydraulic machine
p165
aVthat can be commanded by brain signals
p166
aVrecorded by a non-invasive technology called electroencephalography
p167
aVthat can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements
p168
aVand send his commands to the controls, the motors,
p169
aVand get it done.
p170
aVThis exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin
p171
aVinvented by Gordon Cheng, one of my greatest friends, in Munich,
p172
aVto allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground
p173
aVto be delivered back to the patient through a vest, a shirt.
p174
aVIt is a smart shirt with micro-vibrating elements
p175
aVthat basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient's brain
p176
aVby creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him,
p177
aVbut it is he who is walking again.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo we got this going, and what you'll see here
p180
aVis the first time one of our patients, Bruno, actually walked.
p181
aVAnd he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything,
p182
aVand you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet
p183
aVbecause Bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs to be performed,
p184
aVthe computer is going to analyze it, Bruno is going to certify it,
p185
aVand when it is certified,
p186
aVthe device starts moving under the command of Bruno's brain.
p187
aVAnd he just got it right, and now he starts walking.
p188
aVAfter nine years without being able to move,
p189
aVhe is walking by himself.
p190
aVAnd more than that \u2014
p191
aV(Applause) \u2014
p192
aVmore than just walking,
p193
aVhe is feeling the ground,
p194
aVand if the speed of the exo goes up,
p195
aVhe tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos,
p196
aVthe beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident.
p197
aVThat's why the brain is creating a new sensation in Bruno's head.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo he walks, and at the end of the walk \u2014 I am running out of time already \u2014
p200
aVhe says, "You know, guys,
p201
aVI need to borrow this thing from you when I get married,
p202
aVbecause I wanted to walk to the priest
p203
aVand see my bride and actually be there by myself.
p204
aVOf course, he will have it whenever he wants.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup, and couldn't,
p207
aVbecause for some mysterious reason, FIFA cut its broadcast in half.
p208
aVWhat you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick
p209
aVa few minutes before we went to the pitch
p210
aVand did the real thing in front of the entire crowd,
p211
aVand the lights you are going to see just describe the operation.
p212
aVBasically, the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go.
p213
aVIt can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback,
p214
aVand when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball,
p215
aVyou are going to see two streams of green and yellow light
p216
aVcoming from the helmet and going to the legs,
p217
aVrepresenting the mental commands that were taken by the exo
p218
aVto actually make that happen.
p219
aVAnd in basically 13 seconds,
p220
aVJuliano actually did.
p221
aVYou can see the commands.
p222
aVHe gets ready,  the ball is set, and he kicks.
p223
aVAnd the most amazing thing is,
p224
aV10 seconds after he did that, and looked at us on the pitch,
p225
aVhe told us, celebrating as you saw,
p226
aV"I felt the ball."
p227
aVAnd that's priceless.
p228
aV(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VSo where is this going to go?
p231
aVI have two minutes to tell you
p232
aVthat it's going to the limits of your imagination.
p233
aVBrain-actuating technology is here.
p234
aVThis is the latest: We just published this a year ago,
p235
aVthe first brain-to-brain interface
p236
aVthat allows two animals to exchange mental messages
p237
aVso that one animal that sees something coming from the environment
p238
aVcan send a mental SMS, a torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo,
p239
aVto the second animal,
p240
aVand the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform
p241
aVwithout ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message,
p242
aVbecause the message came from the first animal's brain.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo this is the first demo.
p245
aVI'm going to be very quick because I want to show you the latest.
p246
aVBut what you see here is the first rat getting informed
p247
aVby a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage
p248
aVthat he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward.
p249
aVHe goes there and does it.
p250
aVAnd the same time, he is sending a mental message
p251
aVto the second rat that didn't see any light,
p252
aVand the second rat, in 70 percent of the times
p253
aVis going to press the left lever and get a reward
p254
aVwithout ever experiencing the light in the retina.
p255
aa(lp256
VWell, we took this to a little higher limit
p257
aVby getting monkeys to collaborate  mentally in a brain net,
p258
aVbasically to donate their brain activity
p259
aVand combine them to move the virtual arm that I showed you before,
p260
aVand what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine their brains,
p261
aVsynchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move.
p262
aVOne monkey is controlling the x dimension,
p263
aVthe other monkey is controlling the y dimension.
p264
aVBut it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there
p265
aVand you ask one monkey to control x and y,
p266
aVthe other monkey to control y and z,
p267
aVand the third one to control x and z,
p268
aVand you make them all play the game together,
p269
aVmoving the arm in 3D into a target to get the famous Brazilian orange juice.
p270
aVAnd they actually do.
p271
aVThe black dot is the average of all these brains working
p272
aVin parallel, in real time.
p273
aVThat is the definition of a biological computer,
p274
aVinteracting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal.
p275
aa(lp276
VWhere is this going?
p277
aVWe have no idea.
p278
aVWe're just scientists.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aVWe are paid to be children,
p281
aVto basically go to the edge and discover what is out there.
p282
aVBut one thing I know:
p283
aVOne day, in a few decades,
p284
aVwhen our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking,
p285
aVor a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see,
p286
aVor somebody speaks because of a brain-to-brain bypass,
p287
aVsome of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon
p288
aVin a Brazilian soccer field with an impossible kick.
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Applause)
p293
aa(lp294
VThank you.
p295
aa(lp296
VBruno Giussani: Miguel, thank you for sticking to your time.
p297
aVI actually would have given you a couple more minutes,
p298
aVbecause there are a couple of points we want to develop, and, of course,
p299
aVclearly it seems that we need connected  brains to figure out where this is going.
p300
aVSo let's connect all this together.
p301
aVSo if I'm understanding correctly,
p302
aVone of the monkeys is actually getting a signal
p303
aVand the other monkey is reacting to that signal
p304
aVjust because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse.
p305
aa(lp306
VMiguel Nicolelis:  No, it's a little different.
p307
aVNo monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys.
p308
aVThey are getting a visual feedback in 2D,
p309
aVbut the task they have to accomplish is 3D.
p310
aVThey have to move an arm in three dimensions.
p311
aVBut each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen
p312
aVthat the monkey controls.
p313
aVAnd to get that thing done,
p314
aVyou need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains,
p315
aVbut the ideal is three.
p316
aVSo what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down,
p317
aVthe other two monkeys enhance their performance
p318
aVto get the guy to come back,
p319
aVso this adjusts dynamically,
p320
aVbut the global synchrony remains the same.
p321
aVNow, if you flip without telling the monkey
p322
aVthe dimensions that each brain has to control,
p323
aVlike this guy is controlling x and y,
p324
aVbut he should be controlling now y and z,
p325
aVinstantaneously, that animal's brain forgets about the old dimensions
p326
aVand it starts concentrating on the new dimensions.
p327
aVSo what I need to say is that no Turing machine,
p328
aVno computer can predict what a brain net will do.
p329
aVSo we will absorb technology as part of us.
p330
aVTechnology will never absorb us.
p331
aVIt's simply impossible.
p332
aa(lp333
VBG: How many times have you tested this?
p334
aVAnd how many times have you succeeded versus failed?
p335
aa(lp336
VMN: Oh, tens of times.
p337
aVWith the three monkeys? Oh, several times.
p338
aVI wouldn't be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times.
p339
aVAnd I forgot to mention, because of time,
p340
aVthat just three weeks ago, a European group
p341
aVjust demonstrated the first man-to-man brain-to-brain connection.
p342
aVBG: And how does that play?
p343
aVMN: There was one bit of information \u2014 big ideas start in a humble way \u2014
p344
aVbut basically the brain activity of one subject
p345
aVwas transmitted to a second object, all non-invasive technology.
p346
aVSo the first subject got a message, like our rats, a visual message,
p347
aVand transmitted it to the second subject.
p348
aVThe second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex,
p349
aVor a different pulse, two different pulses.
p350
aVIn one pulse, the subject saw something.
p351
aVOn the other pulse, he saw something different.
p352
aVAnd he was able to verbally indicate
p353
aVwhat was the message the first subject was sending
p354
aVthrough the Internet across continents.
p355
aa(lp356
VModerator: Wow. Okay, that's where we are going.
p357
aVThat's the next TED Talk at the next conference.
p358
aVMiguel Nicolelis, thank you. MN: Thank you, Bruno. Thank you.
